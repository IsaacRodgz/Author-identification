I wish to denounce this barbaric act and the pathetic ideology that fueled it, to disown any person from my part of the world who would justify it, and to offer my sincere condolences and sympathy to the family and countrymen of Nicholas Berg. And for Muslims, who are definitely going to say 'this isn't the real Islam': 'When you meet the unbelievers, strike off their heads; then when you have made wide slaughter among them, carefully tie up the remaining captives.'

 urlLink Amazon.com: DVD: House of Sand and Fog (2003) As you might have noticed by now, I have included links to whatever DVDs I currently have on hand from urlLink Netflix . Yeah, I have a misplaced sense of my own importance, but maybe I'll rent something you have seen or want to see, and we can talk about it. Anyway, last night I watched House of Sand and Fog and I felt compelled to blog about it. What a movie! This is how films should be made! Every person in this film is full of pain and doubt. Each character is simply trying to do what they feel is right, and as the consequences begin spinning, you have a sense of inevitability regarding the outcome. The characters are just so well portrayed. Ben Kingsley has vast reserves of dignity, and he plays an exiled Iranian Colonel to perfection. He just wants to rebuild his life and maintain the dignity of his family, while at the same time demonstrating compassion for his tormentor. Jennifer Connelly is perfect as a whacked out, depressed woman who can't accept responsibility for her own actions, desperately in need of love for herself and from others. The actress who plays Kingsley's wife is simply amazing, conveying a sense of compassion and dignity with nothing but broken english and facial expressions. It is a crime she did not receive an Oscar for her work. The entire movie is a crime, really. It recieved a total of three nominations (Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, and Music). By far, it deserved Best Picture. I've seen 21 Grams, and I liked it, but House was a better film. I really can't understand why House was so urlLink snubbed . In watching the raw pain of this film, it is obvious that no studio suit got anywhere near making 'suggestions' on how to 'improve' the bankability. I'm thankful for that. House pulls no punches, and if you are a thinking empathic person, it will really strike you. This one gets the EB stamp of approval.

 urlLink CNN.com - More pictures of prison abuse found - May 19, 2004 The Abu Ghraib 'scandal' is still the darling of the media. Who was Nick Berg? Do you think the media is overplaying this? Are you tired, or does your sense of outrage grow? I really think this is going to blow up on the Bush Haters, just as the 9/11 commision turned out to be nothing more than a stage for grandstanding politicians of both parties. The public tuned out a long time ago, which is really a shame since there could have been some value in a proper investigation of 9/11. Abu Ghraib is the new Vietnam-cadence. Those that hate us will use this to justify thier hate. Those that know better will see this for what it was and move on with life. And I think most of the great unwashed undecideds can recognize this for what it is. As for intelligence gathering, I wonder how much we've learned from these prisoners using these tactics? The recent chemical weapon attack foiled in Jordan might have come from some data out of Abu Ghraib. As someone else said - the intelligence didn't come to Queen Noor in a dream. Someone had to wring it out of a bad guy, and as a result, a lot of Jordanians are still alive. We should consider this with a little more sensibility than simple pious outrage.

 urlLink Brent Bozell: The media on Nicholas Berg: So what? : Brent Bozell on the media's complete willingness to ignore the Nick Berg story, "While NBC aired 58 stories on U.S. prison abuse in the first few weeks of that story, NBC aired only five stories over 16 months on the discovery of Saddam's mass graves. Abu Ghraib holds 1,500 prisoners, a fraction of whom were abused. Saddam's graves held as many as 300,000 people, all of whom were murdered. How is Abu Ghraib 10 times more important than that? Sadly, the distortions continued. With few exceptions, the Berg beheading was at best a two-day TV story, an obstacle to get around, a white-noise distraction from The Scandal. Berg died. The media's take: sad, but so what? That shouldn't register in public opinion. On the very night the Berg story emerged, ABC's "Nightline" couldn't spend more than a few minutes on Berg before Ted Koppel was back to soliciting John McCain to explain what horrific treatment Americans might dish out next."

 urlLink France says 35-hour week is failing This is going to be fun to watch. France is trying to come to grips with the consequences of its own failed social state. They're going to have to scrap the 35 hour work week and trim jobs. France is in for some very real problems in the future, and this is one of the reasons I worry about a future EU-USA conflict in a generation or two. Europe as a whole is facing a declining population and a contracting standard of living as a result of thier great experiment with socialism. While not as extreme as Russia, things are going to get much worse before they get better. To become more competitive in the world, unemployment will increase even more, and austerity measures must be imposed on budgets, cutting back on social services while you have a population growing more dependent on the 'safety net'. Desperate people who have grown up to believe they are entitled to a government provided standard of living can be quite violent when facing reality. This could get ugly.

Outside of Turkey, it is very hard to find moderate clerics who will stand up to Islamist terrorists, even though the majority of their victims are Muslim. In Iraq, Muqtada al-Sadr has been murdering his religious opposition and using armed gangs to establish political rule. He appears immune to anything resembling condemnation. We know that his militia receives outside support--and where would it come from other than Syria and Iran? "

 I'm sitting here after Tampa scored an empty net goal to make it 4-2. Uh, Eric nailed it! I bow down in awe.

 Pet Peeves of a Goalie. As a referee, please do me the courtesy of checking to be sure I am ready before dropping the puck to start the game, or after a goal is scored. It only takes a second to look at each end of the rink and get a nod. Hitting the post is nothing to get excited over. You missed the net, you didn't beat the goalie. Had the shot been on net, it would have been stopped. My job description says nothing about protecting the posts. When the other team is dancing around the boards, don't just stare at them. Make them make the play. They're not all Wayne Gretzky. Most of them will screw up under pressure. Go get 'em. If you're on my team and standing in the slot, you better not be watching the puck. There are enemy skaters in need of molestation. More if I think about it....

 Referee update, day 2. Well, that didn't last long.... First game I called a penalty and the guy went nuts. Screaming, bitching up and down, saying to me "just where you left off from last season!", you suck, etc.... Rightfully, I shoulda given him 10, but this kinda thing doesn't bother - I find it entertaining, actually, and he was rather creative. Still, my adrenaline was pumping, and it made the rest of the game quite interesting.... I had to give him AND his hard-ass brother more penalties at the end of the game. Stupidity....It confounds me that they have to be such assholes about it - they're not getting paid, they're not even getting trophies - hell, they're 'the best team' out there and they didn't even win the championship last year! The slightest infraction from the other team - an accidental trip or whatever - and they're ready to kick the shit out of the whole team! Inane.... Then, the second game was a blowout - the squad of kids vs the squad of central grads that've played together for 5 years or more. On play where I was the high ref, the puck was in the crease being batted around...I'm drifting in whenthe other ref blows the whistle, so I skate in hard because the puck is under the goalie somewhere. I go to stop (moments later it occurred to me that I may have been trying an ice stop) and slide onto my knee, hip, and ass-in that order. HILARIOUS, as I was the only one moving at the time! A couple of the Central grads are irredeemable asses, too. The were blowing out the kids and one accidentally got the stick up high - didn't come close to hitting him. He said something threatening, then on the next rush fired a ROCKET at the head of the other goalie - a stiff and talentless giant with neck and belly flesh sticking out of ill-fitting equipment - and CONTINUED to fire it as hard as he could from any angle regardless of who was in the way. Can't call a penalty for that, though. (I did call one last year when a jerk fired it deliberately into the other bench.) Mark, have you ever experienced that kinda play, from either side? If someone fires at your goalies head like that, what would you do? Would/did YOU ever fire it like that? These people are missing the point of the game. Sure it's grand competition, but it's supposed to be fun - especailly Inline. It's not supposed to be rough or eminently dangerous. What are they REALLY angry about? missed opportunities? bad domestic situations? Who poured vineger on YOUR fruity pebbles?! Does Tibet have a national hockey team?

 urlLink Belmont Club I doubt most of you are interested in reading this one, but if you do consider yourself a 'student' of history, particularly military history, you really should take the time to read this whole thing. It's a fascinating examination of the growing shift away from battlefield reality when it comes to determining the 'winner' of a conflict. Quote - During the campaign of 1940, Heinz Guderian's panzers bypassed many French formations, leaving them unfought, knowing that if their command structure were severed, the whole musclebound mass would fall to the ground headless. What the Left gradually discovered during the course of the Vietnam war was that Guderian had not been bold enough. Guderian still felt it necessary to win on the battlefield. He had not realized that it was possible to ignore the battlefield altogether because it was the enemy political structure, not his military capability, that was the true center of gravity of an entire campaign. It was General Giap during the Vietnam War who first planned a military operation entirely around its possible media effect.

 urlLink My Way - News A few days ago, I saw a story that revealed the US was quietly topping off the Strategic Pertoleum Reserve, buying up crude. While nothing was revealed, it suggests the US could be expecting a problem in future oil supply. Personally, it got me thinking of the post-election strategy of Syria, Iran or even Saudi Arabia.... In the wake of that story comes this story. John al-Kerry is predictably calling for Bush to begin releasing oil reserves to combat the 'high cost of gas'. There's so much wrong with this I don't know where to begin. -Why is the President responsible for gas prices? -What part of STRATEGIC RESERVE isn't understood? -Gee, maybe we should build refineries? -Or how about drilling some of our own oil? -Or how about reducing the number of gas blends from 28 to 1? But the American people will probably want these reserves released so they can save $2 a tank. It's so easy to be a Leftist when all you have to do is appeal to emotion.

 Referee Update. Last wednesday was my first night back on skates to referree. I didn't fall down. It went well, really. I was confident, made the right calls at the right time, and projected a professional attitude that announced to the players - "No bullshit this season, boys." I have a partner this time, too. It's a lot easier to feel confident when the other Ref has less experience than you. I felt more in charge, more of a mentor - more responsiblity to the job. It's also less nerve-wracking when you have the ability to share the blame for something missed. I was quickly reminded how tricky it can be to maintain your balance at highspeeds. (that's something Todd don't have to worry about!) These guys are fast, too. Most of 'em anyway. Don still plays - (Vern's cousin Don) so does Shwanger. Buck-who was on the first Central-winning purple-jerseyed team with me - also still plays.

 Hockey Update...almost forgot. I think I had mentioned that due to a schedule change, we ended up with back to back games last night. As I usually have a hard enough time with ONE game, I was certain that I would breathe my last with about 10 minutes left in game 2. I made appropriate Final Arrangements with my wife before heading to the rink. The first game went well, despite the predictable high score. We won 12-11 with the winning goal coming with 21 seconds left. We played the best team in the league so far, handing them their first loss. Again, the speed of the players here is difficult to believe. Despite giving up 11, I played solid and made numerous saves that felt like the old days. I lost count of the number of 2-1, 3-1, 3-0 and outright breakaways, and I acquited myself well. When Game 2 started, most of my guys were barely moving, especially after coming off such a close, intense game. We were down 10-5 at the end of the first half, and as evidenced by the score, I was playing quite poorly. The fatigue was certainly catching up with me, but I can, in good conscience, dish a small portion of blame to my teammates for failing to cover anybody in the slot. At least 4 of the goals were back door plays, leaving me all by myself. Things changed a little at the half when we rested, and then immediately burned our timeout for a few more minutes of rest. The quality of play improved all the way around, bring us to a score of 15-13 with two minutes left. Then 15-15 with 60 seconds to go. We took the lead at 16-15 with 40 seconds left on an amazing sequence of purely satanic give and go passes. It reminded me of the Tampa Bay goal. The final 40 seconds was a seige, with the other team just pounding away from eight feet. I have no idea how I stopped so many shots, but it was as if someone was standing there with a bag of pucks, throwing them at me as fast as they could. I don't mind to admitting luck had a great deal to do with it. So we ended up 2-0 for the day, and despite the score, I was quite pleased. I'm certainly feeling it today, but it is a pleasant sort of ache. The kind of pain where you know it has been good for you. I was invited to fill in tonight for the women again, but I passed. I'm thinking about calling the rink and agreeing to go in, but haven't decided. Looking forward to Steve's update on how many penalties he called, and how often he avoided getting in the way. After watching our ref dodging pucks, it occured to me the ref is the anti-goalie.

I spent the weekend at my parent's house and had some interesting conversation with my father. His position as of last week was Abu Ghraib was the end for us, and we had lost a war that he already did not agree with. He thought we were botching it, giving me the usual CNN litany of miserable failures and so on. This week he was of a completely different mind. The Nick Berg execution changed it all for him. Now, he isn't all that concerned about Abu Ghraib, and in fact thinks the 'torture' might have been a smart thing to do. He thinks we should escalate our involvment, and be more aggressive against al-Sadr. He also is starting to wonder if it is even possible to coexist with Islam, but I didn't go into my position there since I frankly didn't have the energy to spend an hour ranting the contents of this Blog. After all, it was the weekend and I was supposed to be relaxing. While my dad isn't a representative sample, I do get the impression that many reasonable undecided people are having their attitudes hardening with the Nick Berg murder. I hope so.

 urlLink We must carry the burden of being free The Gazette finally published my letter, and they edited it! The hacked out a few paragraphs that I thought were particularly meaningful! Here's the whole thing for those who didn't see it the first time. The recent controversy over photographs of our fallen soldiers returning to the US illustrates fundamental flaws in the positions of both sides. The Pentagon claims that they wish to protect the privacy of the families. That is a noble sentiment, but the anonymity of a flag draped coffin is assured. In fact, as a symbol, the image serves as a reminder of the integrity, honor and dedication expressed by each of our volunteer soldiers who place our nation above themselves and their family. It is our responsibility to understand the consequence of what they do for us, and to respect their sacrifice. The Pentagon’s ultimate motivation stems from the immature and cynical nature of our national media. There is little doubt that these images will be used in an attempt to destroy our resolve to see this conflict through to the end. The merchants of cynicism have little use for the larger ideas represented by those coffins, seeking only to discredit, undermine and cheapen the meaning of the sacrifice. However, the media’s failing to behave as adults is not a sufficient excuse for the Pentagon to hide these images. (Removed by Gazette) War is a brutal and nasty thing, but when a nation decides to embark on this course, it deserves the seriousness of mature adults. If our general population lacks the stomach and resolve, then we should not place our soldiers in harm’s way. If our people wish to abdicate our position in the world by demonstrating our unwillingness to defend our way of life, then we are not worthy of the sacrifice of these men and women. The best way to end these images is to treat this conflict with the seriousness it requires. We need to engage the war fully, and remove political restrictions from the calculus of combat. The lesson of Viet Nam continues to go unlearned by the majority of people in this nation. (removed by Gazette) John Stuart Mill said it best. “War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things. The decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling that thinks nothing is worth war is much worse.” These images are a reminder that there are still men and women in this country who understand the burden of being free in a largely tyrannical world, and are willing to carry that burden despite the scorn with which that idea is held by certain elements in the very society they strive to protect.

 urlLink Instapundit.com - Glenn Reynolds at InstaPundit has a good post on Media Bias.

 Settle in for a long post. For the better part of three years I’ve been beating my head against the wall over the Middle East and terrorism, trying to get beyond the surface appearance and really grok the issue from the inside out. It’s far too easy to sink into the casual racism inherent in the idea that the Arab mind is incapable of being civilized, or that they simply aren’t competent to govern themselves in peace. I can’t accept the idea that they aren’t capable, but I can examine why it appears this way. Fundamentally, I believe that all Men are capable of freedom and civilization. I heartily endorse the words of George Bush when he says that Freedom is the natural yearning of Man. The problem in the Mideast and elsewhere lies in the structure of a culture and the imposition of values that are contrary to the natural desire to be free. Nazism, Communism, and now Islam work against Freedom, and remove options from people until they no longer believe they Freedom is a viable option. I still stand by my statements of yesterday: Islam as it is today is not compatible with modern civilization, nor do I believe that Islam or the Arab culture is compatible with Freedom and Human Rights. I also believe that a lot of people need to be removed from society before we figure out a way to bring peace to the region. Nothing like this has ever been done in such a short scale, but the availability of modern technology and weapons place us under time pressure unprecedented in world history. Past lessons are still relevant, but less so than before. 1) The structure of Islam. Islam is a warrior faith. I make no moral judgment with that statement; it is simply fact. Mohamed was at war with the dominant Arabian pagan faiths of the time, striving to seize control of the region. He wrote the Koran while running from his enemies, fighting them, and eventually winning a brutal, bloody war. The Koran was a sequence of proclamations from Mohamed to his army. He sold them the Paradise of Allah in exchange for absolute loyalty to his cause. You’ve heard before that Islam means “Peace through submission to the Will of Allah”, convenient for Mohamed as the voice of Allah. I’ve read large chunks of the Koran, and you can’t deny the violence contained within those pages. As a field manual for an army surviving in a brutal era, I can’t quarrel with it. As an idea, Islam has been remarkably successful, rising from an idea to a major religion and seizing control of a large chunk of the known world in a few centuries. It is as powerful as Christianity in its ability to convert and control. However, where Christianity found a way to outgrow the horror of medieval values, Islam has changed little since its early days. It is still a faith of the persecuted minority eager to convert the world by the sword. 2) Islam as a culture Islam as the center hub of culture has manifestly failed to produce a modern society anywhere in the world. There are two notable exceptions, and both help illustrate my point. Turkey is more European than Islamic, due largely to the secularization of Islamic life in their society. The Turks have removed control of the education system from Islamic control, and largely isolated the Imans from political life. In Turkey, being a Muslim is a personal choice, existing on the outside of public life. As a result, Turkey is somewhat prosperous, stable, and have nearly earned membership in the EU. Saudi Arabia, and the various small states surrounding it, have their oil wealth to thank for any sense of a modern culture. Western influence and interest in that oil has forced them to import and accept exposure to western values, bringing with it a veneer of modern life. Beyond this thin layer of civilization, Saudi Arabia still clings to Wahabi Islam; one of the most virulent strains of Islam. Beneath the seeming modern culture, the old ways still fester, and Saudi Arabia is one large bomb away from reverting to 1979 Iran. The role of Islam as the center of Saudi life plays a large role in the fact that most of the 9/11 culprits were Saudi, Usama Bin Laden is a Saudi, and Saudi organizations continue to funnel millions of dollars to Islamic terror groups all over the world. 3) Middle East violence. Every Middle Eastern terror organization has Allah and Islam at the core. I don’t think that can be denied. They recruit from the mosque community, they draw upon the cultural and religious influence of militant imams, and they prey upon worshiper’s belief that Allah rewards the faithful soldier in his cause, returning to the themes of Mohamed as he battled for control of his region against the pagan infidels. Islam is a wonderful tool to raise armies and recruit fanaticism. It seems to be inherent in its structure. Couple this with the theocratic control over the power of the state, and you have serious problems. In the Middle East, Islam is the center of life. Being a secular Muslim means trying very hard to convince everyone around you that you are a fanatic, while trying to avoid torture or murder. The police power of the state coupled with theocratic fanaticism means you keep your head down and try to stay alive. In such an environment, there is little room for a Martin Luther, or other figure, to preach reform. Without an external influence to promote a stable and safe environment, Islamic reform is a dead issue. This brings me to my solution. It is an extension of what I mean when I say that Islam, as it is today, must die, and practitioners of Islam as it is understood today must be removed from society if they do not abandon their beliefs. The key to Islam’s compatibility with the modern world lies in the secularization and reform of the Islamic message. However it is done, Islam’s message, as a warrior faith practiced by an oppressed minority, must be changed. Islam must be removed as the center of life in the Middle East. It must be disentangled from government, and de-emphasized as the sole reason for living. My initial ideas on how to do this are as follows: 1) Secularization. a. Some sort of council of respected and credible Islamic scholars must come together under our protection and reform the message of Mohamed. The Koran needs to be examined and explained, combating the incendiary preaching of theocratic imams. This council must bring Islam into the modern age by pruning what no longer applies. The faith must be severed from its roots as a warrior religion. Essentially, they need a Red Letter King George W. Version of the Koran. It won’t be accepted immediately, but it is vitally needed as a starting point. b. Control of the Islamic Message. The new version of Islam must be preached to the masses. The old version of Islam needs to be removed from circulation. We need to make it clear: if you preach death, you don’t survive to give a second sermon. If you, as a worshiper, try to protect an Imam, you share his fate. If it brings an uprising, so be it. We cannot tolerate a faith that continues to preach death and hatred, under any circumstances. If you preach the New Islam, then not only do you benefit from our protection, you get your own satellite network. Will people listen? Perhaps. I believe a message of hope and peace will always win over a message of despair and death. Even in poverty, hope always wins. A New Islamic faith can take root, given enough time, and the suppression of competition. c. As I just touched upon, the suppression of Old Islam must be undertaken without flinching. You MUST prune it out and replace it with the new message. You do that by protecting the new Imams, giving them a forum, and demonstrating that peace begets progress. The old ways of Fatwa and Jihad must be stamped out with extreme prejudice. Muslims must be presented a choice. d. Finally, we must work to secularize both Old Islam and New Islam. We need to build equivalents to those big freakin’ Baptists Churches I saw all over Atlanta, seating thousands. We need to make worship more of a social event than a literal interaction with Allah. We need to offer incentives in a gross, base, and commercial American style: if you belong to this church, you get a leg up on jobs and contracts. You get perks. You get the secret handshake that gets you discounts. Whatever. Essentially, we need to turn the Mosque into a club. This meshes with something I’m going to get to in a moment, so suspend judgment on this for a moment. The second part of this reform is: 2) Industrialization a. Iraq has too much idle labor at the moment. They are a highly educated people, but it’s going to take too long to ramp up the types of industry that can take advantage of their skills. Therefore, we need to immediately progress to sweatshops. There is no reason Iraq shouldn’t be making our clothes, shoes and other low cost items that can be manufactured immediately. Private capital will not flow into Iraq right now with all the trouble, so the American government needs to underwrite these ventures. Begin employing the teeming mass. Give them something to do, and give them a salary while they produce goods. This will gradually raise the standard of living, and eventually, more sophisticated industries will rise up and access the Iraqi skill set. b. Further industrialization enhances the secularization of the society. As people gain employment, they begin to accumulate products and disposable income. Life becomes a little more enjoyable. A consuming middle class is a beacon of hope for those mired in poverty, especially if that middle class is grounded in the new social club of New Islam. Join the New Islamic Mosque, accept the message of peace and hope, and gain access to middle class benefactors that will give you contacts to improve your life. Attend an underground Old Islamic mosque and find yourself frozen out of access to jobs. Yeah, it’s an un-American concept, but I think it is necessary for the type of change that is needed. Consumerism brings peace. It’s hard to imagine a guy with a nice house, good job, an education for his kids, and luxury items like televisions and refrigerators going off and blowing up a bus. It’s about as likely as an American wanting to die for Catholicism. Undermining the central role of Islam, either New or Old, is essential to making this work. Here in the US, spontaneously telling someone you are a Christian usually provokes a strained moment where everyone hopes the conversation doesn’t go into your personal relationship with Christ. We need the same situation in Islamic countries. Your relationship with Allah is your business, and should remain part of your private life. I think the steps outlined above could get us there someday, perhaps in a generation. Reform proliferates through example. If this works, and a free, happy, prosperous Iraq emerges with New Islam at it’s core, other Islamic states will have to cope with their people asking – “WTF?” Avalanches start with pebbles. I’m out of gas here. I’m sure there are many things I missed that will come to me in a moment, and maybe those things will show up in the comment section. Of course this isn’t perfect, or fully detailed, but I believe the principle is sound. No one has ever had to confront a virulent religion in such a short span of time. History is clear that you can’t stamp out a faith, but it is possible to replace it through alternatives. Both Islam and Christianity have been successful in doing this in the past, over a long span of time. We don’t have the luxury, so our efforts must be direct and focused. This is what I mean when I say Islam must die, as well as those that refuse to turn away from Seventh Century values. We have to address this. Ideally, Islam itself would reform, but without the interference of the West, this change won’t occur fast enough to avoid the coming holocaust of nuclear Islamic Republics. I see no other way.

 urlLink 630 WMAL WARNING! This is the video of Nick Berg being slaughtered. I spent a lot of time last night trying to decide if I should watch it. Finally, I decided I had to confront Evil. I had to see what they did, and have my rage confirmed. I can't put words to what I've seen. It's like a wordless scream of rage and hatred boiling out of me. Nick Berg screamed as they sawed at his neck. It goes on and on, all the while these animals are chanting Allahu Akbar over and over again. It is like staring into hell. Where is this God that is so great? This is Evil. There is nothing more to say when describing it. It confirms my disgust at a culture and religion that can promote this. What sort of culture mires itself in the seventh century? Islam delenda est. Marcus Cato in the Third Punic war set out a simple concept. "Carthago delenda est." Carthage must be destroyed. The Romans razed it to the ground, killed every man, and sold every woman and child into slavery. They salted the ground and eradicated all traces of Carthage. Rome was never bothered by them again. Islam delenda est. Watch the video, and tell me how we can coexist with Islam. Explain to me how this is morally equivalent to Abu Ghraib. Explain to me why I shouldn't beat someone senseless when they say Nick Berg deserved this? There isn't much more to say that will be coherent in my current state. I believe this should be aired on TV, at least once. We should all confront this. We should all understand what we are facing in the world.

 urlLink IRAQ THE MODEL : A very long post from Ali at Iraq the Model. Just when I was getting depressed, I read through this and found a little hope. "My young cousin is a religious Sunni who goes to the mosque and listens to the cleric there every Friday and believes whatever he says, as he's still young. My uncle always teased his son about this but never prohibited him from doing that. We were talking about different stuff; the kids needs, clerics, Americans and the increase in the average income of most Iraqis. My uncle had some unusual sense of humor that didn't fit quite well in his somewhat religious family. He winked at me and turned to his son and asked him 'What do you think of the Americans?' His son answered, 'They are occupiers'. 'So you think we should fight them?' his father asked. Ibrahim said 'No, but I don't like them'. My uncle said, pretending to change the subject 'Do you like your new computer that no one shares with you?' 'Yes of course dad'. 'Ok, are you satisfied with the satellite dish receiver we have or do you need a better one?' 'This one is fine but I heard there's a better one that gets more channels' 'ok I'll get you that next week'. Then he said, 'Is there anything else you'd like to have son?' 'No dad I have all that I need'. 'Ok but how about a car?' Ibrahim was astounded and said 'Really? a..a CAR.. for me!?'. 'Of course for you! I'm too old to drive now and my eyes are not that well and you are the older son. So whom else would it be for!?' 'Oh, dad that will be great! When will that happen?' 'Just finish you're exams and you'll have it'. 'I will dad'. 'Are you happy now son?' 'Yes dad, sure I am!' 'Then why do you hate the Americans you son of a b***h!? I couldn�t get you a bicycle a year ago, I could hardly feed you and your brothers and sisters. You didn't know what an apple or a banana tasted like, I couldn't buy you a damned Pepsi bottle except in occasions, and now you can have all that you wish, and a car of your own!

 urlLink Yahoo! News - Prison Abuse Said Bigger to U.S. Than 9/11 Time for the Vatican to take that big flying leap now. Quote - In an interview published Wednesday in the Rome daily La Repubblica, Archbishop Giovanni Lajolo described the abuses as "a tragic episode in the relationship with Islam" and said the scandal would fuel hatred for the West and for Christianity. "The torture? A more serious blow to the United States than Sept. 11. Except that the blow was not inflicted by terrorists but by Americans against themselves," Lajolo was quoted as saying in La Repubblica. Back to me - "A tragic episode in the relationship with Islam"????? How about chopping off the head of a 26 year old? How about chopping off the head of a newspaper reporter? Burning western contractors and hanging the bodies while the crowd cheered? Blowing up Spanish trains? WTC...twice? Not to mention the myriad assortment of hijackings, suicide bombings and outright murder of anyone not a Muslim? Where the hell does the Vatican get off with this? I'm am so sick to death of the moral equivalence the rest of the world wallows in over Islam. I am sick of the apologies, of blaming the west, of putting the burden of coexistence upon the civilized world while indulging in the casual racism of excusing the Arabs for behaving like animals. Enough.

 urlLink Netflix: 25th Hour . I watched this last night on a DVD rental from urlLink Netflix . I'm a big fan of Ed Norton, from films such as Fight Club, Primal Fear, The Score, The Italian Job and others. So despite this being a Spike Lee movie, I decided to give it a go. I was entranced by this film. It was art. The use of the camera, the power of the soundtrack, and the near hypnotic quality of one particular voice over at the end was just masterful. This was an Oscar quality film, and I'm surprised it wasn't recognized. According to urlLink BoxOffice Mojo the film did a measly $23 million on a $5 million budget. Sure, it made money, but it should have had a wider viewing. This is not a film with a real plot in the regular sense. It is a one night examination of the moral structure of three friends, a father and a girlfriend as they try to cope with the fact that Norton's character will be reporting to prison in the morning for a seven year stretch after being busted for heroin dealing. The underlying commonality of each character revolves around their lip service to rules. Each seems to think that rules exist, but when push comes to shove, they can break them without being all that concerned. It's a long movie, clocking in at over two hours, and it might seem slow at times, but like many good movies, the real action is in what is NOT said. The interest lies in watching the characters hesitate, clearly choosing their path, yet seeing an acknowledgement that this isn't good...but I'm going to do it anyway. The movie plays over the backdrop of the World Trade Center, after the collapse. In one scene, Barry Pepper's bond trader character is in his apartment, with a direct overview of the Crater. He comments that they could bring down as many buildings as they want, but he isn't moving - he worked hard for this place, and he isn't going to be inconvenienced on the account of others. His entire attitude suggests that the Crater, for him, is nothing more than a nuisance, devoid of any meaning outside of himself. I highly recommend the film. Pay attention to the music and how it sets the tone. I'm not ready to sample other Spike Lee films, but he certainly impressed me with this one.

 The beheading of Nick Berg. Can you guys help me out today? I spent a block of time last night searching for some prominent Muslim leader condemning the murder of Nick Berg. I surfed some Islamic boards and found nothing at all. If you run into something, let me know. Same for our EU friends, who were so worked into a frenzy over Abu Ghairb. If you see some genuine outrage over Berg, let me know. As for our friends at the DU, they spent the afternoon speculating that Berg was really murdered by the CIA or some other group at the behest of Bush/Cheney. Various reasons were given: he knew something about the abuse in Abu Ghraib, Bush had it done to change the subject, or Berg was cutting in on Halliburton contracts. The argument was quite genuine - little hint of sarcasm. I know you guys get annoyed when I post DU links, but if you want this one, let me know and I'll dig it up today.

 A few moments of pathetic rumination.... I'm finding it difficult to visit book stores lately. Over vacation, I was in several stores, loitering around and trying to soak up the atmosphere. However, instead of the warm feeling of peace I normally associate in such a setting, I began to experience an itching agitation, driving me from the store as one would flee a creaky 'haunted' house in the middle of the night. In standing in front of the Science Fiction shelves, I am struck by the feeling that I am standing in front of a shadowy portal, and on the other side, the real me is gazing back, ruminating on a life stuck in an 8-5 job as one of many possible pasts, thankfully avoided through the realization of my dream of being a successful writer. I feel like the apparition, and the idea on the other side of this vision is more real than me. I am seized with an intolerable urge to flee, to turn away from the obviousness of my unhappiness. The strength of this feeling is beyond anything I've ever experienced, and I think it stems from the fact I've essentially given up on my novel, at least over the past few months. I think about it daily, and I still feel good about the potential, but I'm having trouble getting back to it. So these feelings are part of myself, angry over this abandonment of what I see as my vocational destiny and purpose. Gotta get off my rear and get on with what I want to do. Same old story, and I'm sure most of you are sick of hearing me whine about it. On with it already....

 urlLink One Hand Clapping : Tom Brokaw has the audacity to impart the Leftist lies on the Iraqi head of state in a lecturing tone. Brokaw: I know that you and others like you are grateful for the liberation of Iraq. But can't you understand why many Americans feel that so many young men and women have died here for purposes other than protecting the United States? Allawi: We know that this is an extension to what has happened in New York. And - the war have been taken out to Iraq by the same terrorists. Saddam was a potential friend and partner and natural ally of terrorism. Brokaw: Prime minister, I'm surprised that you would make the connection between 9/11 and the war in Iraq. The 9/11 commission in America says there is no evidence of a collaborative relationship between Saddam Hussein and those terrorists of al-Qaida. Allawi: No. I believe very strongly that Saddam had relations with al-Qaida. And these relations started in Sudan. ..." Maybe Tom should have taken the time to actually read the 9/11 commission report. With al Qaeda as its foundation, Bin Ladin sought to build a broader Islamic army that also included terrorist groups from Egypt, Libya, Algeria, Saudi Arabia and Oman, Tunisia, Jordan, Iraq, Lebanon, Morocco, Somalia and Eritrea. Not all groups from these states agreed to join, but at least one from each did. With a multinational council intended to promote common gooals, coordinate targeting and authorize asset sharing for terrorist operations, this Islamic force represented a new level of collaboration among diverse terrorist groups. Why does this lie that the 9/11 Commission found no link persist in the media in the face of numerous statements in the report that al-Qaeda and Saddam WERE cooperating. They had not yet launched an attack on the US, but they were in the process of sharing resources and capabilities. That is clearly in the report. The Left seems to be hung up again on the lack of connection between 9/11 and Saddam. Does the standard of defending ourselves still require us to accept the first blow from our enemy? Were we to wait until Saddam and al-Qaeda got their act together and killed a few thousand Americans before the Iraqi was was justified? The Left still seems to want to treat Terror as a law enforcement problem, confined to waiting for a crime before we can take action. Can we afford this?

 More hostages, more killing to come.... Over vacation, the animals slaughtered the South Korean hostage, and it appears last night they murdered a US soldier with a bullet to the back of the head. As of right now, they have a Pakistani, three Turks and a US Marine in custody and are threatening to behead them. Putting aside my blind rage for the moment, I'm puzzled by this new collection of hostages. If you recall a few weeks ago during the Saudi hostage siege, the terrorists made a point of releasing all muslim hostages unharmed. They've also taken great pains to paint this conflict as a religious war against the infidels. While it isn't unusual for muslims to murder muslims (take a look at Palestinian vigilente actions against anyone who tries to find a peaceful solution with Israel), it is unusual in the ongoing struggle in Iraq. Surely they have access to non-Muslim hostage candidates. They managed to snag a US Marine after all, but what are the odds they randomly get a Muslim Marine? Are they targeting a new audience? Are they growing more desperate? Nick Berg and Paul Johnson got them nowhere, and it looks like South Korea isn't going away. Is this a message to the Iraqi people that being a Muslim will no longer protect you? The five men are certainly doomed, and it still troubles me to see little outrage in the Muslim world. It will be telling if the death of Muslim men finally generates some reaction.

 urlLink Yahoo! News - Smiling Bush quietly shares Iraq handover glee with Blair While the Iraqi Sovereignty hand-off is symbolic in many ways, it still has a great deal of meaning to the real world. It's obvious that the bad guys over there were going to continue murdering, beheading and blowing things up as we approached the established date of June 30th. Anything that happens from here on is an unmistakable attack against the Iraqi people, despite whatever al-Qaeda might claim. In reading some of the Iraqi Blogs today, like urlLink Iraq the Model , the Iraqis are greeting this as more than just a symbol. It’s a great day for all the freedom lovers. No doubt is left now that we’re winning while the forces of darkness and evil are losing a key round in this war. With great delight we received th news. this is the right and important step to build the free Iraq and It’s a painful strike for terrorism and its allies. They really missed this surprising and brilliant timing. And I guess they’re deeply shocked right now. their luck couldn’t help them to scar this glorious day with a crime of theirs. .... It’s hard to appreciate the efforts of all those who helped us to get our freedom and rebuild our country. We will never forget them. We will keep them in our hearts. God bless Iraq and her people. God bless America and her people. God bless all the coalition forces who supported operation Iraqi freedom. May God bless the souls of all those who sacrificed their lives to free Iraq. It's important, even as a symbol. As I heard on Fox today, an American general said that our exit strategy was training an Iraqi police and military to secure their freedom. This is a good step in that direction. With the Iraqis now running their own courts and having a little more freedom with thier police, the bad guys have to worry about harsher consequences than Abu Ghraib in their future. The Iraqis aren't going to be as restrained when it comes to questioning their suspects. The reaction from the Left is funny and predictable. First, we would 'never' establish a viable Iraqi Government, and now we have. The handover was taking too long, and now doing it early is evidence of 'chaos and confusion'. The goalposts of success keep moving. History will judge, and I'm comfortable in hearing the truth in twenty years. When I saw Bush shake Blairs hand, both with a big grin, I shared in their moment of happiness. We did what we promised to do, and while it isn't over by a long shot, we are meeting our obligations and doing the right thing. Even if it isn't known or appreciated today. Remember the adage - character is doing the right thing even if no one knows or appreciates it. Both Bush and Blair have suffered massive electoral damage in pursuing the right course of action. Both might lose office for it, but both men understand that the office is an implement to be used to further just causes. If they lose, then at least they accomplished something meaningful.

 urlLink Happy Birthday Reagan Our daughter turned one year old on the 25th, and I can't believe it has went by so fast.

 On vacationing in Cleveland…. My wife and I spent a few days in Cleveland, Ohio after leaving our daughter with my parents in Toledo. We decided we needed a bit of a break, and since Wednesday was our ten year anniversary, it seemed as good a time as any to get away for awhile. You might be wondering why we chose Cleveland, land of the Burning River, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and the ignoble Browns. I wondered that as well, but then I recalled that my brother lives there, so we had the added bonus of being able to visit him, as well as get some decent tips about what to do in town. Since our time was limited, we really didn’t do a whole lot, at least not the sort of whirling tour you would expect from a typical vacation. Despite the relatively sedate time, I thought it was worth noting a few things that I found amusing. We visited the urlLink USS Cod moored in downtown Cleveland. The Cod is a WW II submarine that saw seven tours in the Pacific, with a fairly remarkable battle record. The boat is urlLink moored at the waterfront, with easy parking and access. As a WW II historical nut, I really looked forward to this. And at only $6, it’s a real bargain. The tour is self guided, and since it was a weekday early in the morning, Diane and I practically had the boat to ourselves. The condition of the tour is what makes it so interesting. The boat has not been altered to accommodate tourists. Entry is gained through the forward hatch, climbing in through a cramped ‘airlock’, then down through the hatch on a thin metal ladder. The opening is so tight, I had to force my shoulders through. Once I left the ladder below decks, I had to stoop slightly to get enough headroom to move around in the urlLink forward torpedo room. I won’t bore you with the blow by blow details of each compartment, but if you want to view some quicktime movies, click urlLink here. Suffice to say that the crowding on the boat is unimaginable. I didn’t bring a camera since I wasn’t sure it was permitted, but after being inside the boat, I realized it wouldn’t have mattered. I wouldn’t be able to get a coherent picture, since the subject of any picture would be too close to achieve proper focus. I tried to imagine what these guys experienced as I shuffled along in this tiny little boat, bumping my head, knees and elbows with almost any movement. 90 men lived in a space unfit for half that number, and fought a war while doing so. I wonder how they got around the boat with their enormous testicles in the way. If you are ever in the Cleveland area, take an hour and go see the Cod. You won’t regret it. Next stop was urlLink The Cleveland Museum of Art. There were two primary reasons to go to the museum – 1) it isn’t something we usually do, and 2) it was free. I put aside my entire ‘pay as you go philosophy’ for the moment and knowingly leeched from the taxpayer to go stare at objects du’art for a few hours. I wasn’t really sure what we were getting in to here, but it turned out to be an enjoyable time. The museum self guided tour started us out in the lower level, full of art from ancient Asia and India. There’s something about antiquity that draws me in, and I’m willing to stare at about anything if you tell me it is four or five thousand years old. The museum had no problems providing suitable moments where I could witness the creaking bones of time. The most remarkable thing I saw was a five thousand year old clay pot, delicate and shapely, adorned with a spiral glaze pattern that looked quite modern. I tried to imagine the circumstances that allowed it to survive 50 centuries without any significant damage. I’m surprised some drunken Asiatic potentate hadn’t smashed it over the head of a clumsy slave, shortly before having him impaled for spilling tea. We moved on through a vast collection of stone Buddhas in various states of decay. Arranged properly, they would make a good Paleolithic animation of the ravages of leprosy, if one walked along quickly. After the fifth statue, my respectful pauses to soak up the age and craftsmanship of each work degenerated to bare glances with a murmer – “Bhudda, Bhudda, Bhudda, Vishnu, Vishnu, yeah, okay…” I think art appreciation requires small doses to be effective. Next came various displays of Japanese art, running up until the Meiji era. I’ve always loved Japanese art, especially the brush paintings, which are really designated as a Chinese style. Whatever. There’s something about Japan that has always interested me. I appreciate how their culture values subtlety and understatement. At least until they tried to grab the Pacific and we blew them to hell. But we gave them Quality Control in exchange, and they turned out just fine. There was one particular piece there that caught my imagination. Upon entering the gallery, I was confronted with this massive urlLink scroll painting of a man who appeared to be in complete agony, yet with a dignified expression on his contorted face. I also noted the proportions of the subject, thinking they looked very odd. It turned out he suffered from gigantism, and stood over seven feet tall. He was a samurai who turned to Sumo when he fell upon hard times. As an added touch, the subject had placed his hand print on the canvas, just visible in the picture. I can’t exactly explain the reason, but this portrait still sticks with me. After this, the highlight of the museum, at least for me, was the Armor Court (a massive collection of European armor and arms dating from the 1200s through the 1600s), and the gallery of Baroque Art. There’s just something about European art from this era, when they painted real people and real events as they imagined them appearing. It is photo-journalism of the day, albeit at a much slower pace. I could easily spend quite a few hours wandering in a place like this, feasting on the radiance of urlLink this , or the transience of urlLink this . The gallery of modern art drove away any lingering desire to press on through my fatigue or hunger at this point. I stared at a urlLink Jackson Pollack for a few moments, trying to understand what people see in the swirling mass of dribs and drabs. With any respect that might be due Mr. Pollack, I remain an ignorant savage. I had much the similar experience with works such as urlLink this large piece of graph paper , or urlLink this...whatever . One of the funnier observations was the caption that accompanied these urlLink squares . ” Largely a self-taught painter, Mark Rothko stopped painting recognizable objects in 1940 because he wanted to "create a new language of painting" that made no reference to the kinds of things people were used to seeing in pictures. May I translate? Mr. Rothko is a talentless hack who disguises his inability to paint with an unbridled pretentiousness. Modern art gives art a bad name, and we should identify it for what it is. Famished from a long day of submarine exploration and a properly snooty art experience, we decided to go have an early dinner/late lunch at the Cheesecake Factory. If you have not yet dined at the Cheesecake Factory, I strongly recommend you take the time to do so. The food is really quite remarkable, and the portion sizes are simply ridiculous. When our waitress brought our entrees to our table, I was immediately thankful that I had ordered a lunch portion. While working my way through the first ten percent of my plate, I quickly grew weary of the fork-to-mouth action, and lost myself in the idea of opening up my own chain of restaurants with similar portion sizes. I would be honest about it, and call it Glut . Then I considered that name too obvious, wondering if a properly umlauted name such as Gl&#252t might give it that touch of Euroness to make it acceptable to the upscale coast dwellers. I fantasized about properly Germanic employees with an appropriate Teutonic dourness, operating with Prussian efficiency. I considered the Lebensraum menu option, where you would get your entree along with all adjacent items. The fantasy quickly fell apart when I contemplated the viability of German cuisine, but it was still a good image. After I consumed an insignificant portion of my meal, it was time to consider desert. After all, the name of the restaurant is the Cheesecake Factory. Duh. I had looked forward to this $7 slice of cheesecake for many days, and I wasn’t going to let a little thing like an entrée that could feed thirty get in the way. I selected the Chocolate Peanut Butter Cookie Dough Cheesecake. I’m sure many of you have had cheesecake that you might consider the equal of the cheesecake found in this blessed establishment, so I must embark on a deeper explanation of what this particular cheesecake really means to Western Civilization. Imagine a Diabolic Machine that can take several dozen ordinary cheesecakes and condense them down to one concentrated slice of pure Experience. This is a slice of cheesecake that diabetics speak about in hushed tones of awe. Overweight people within three miles find themselves leaning in the direction of the restaurant, caught up in an inexplicable urge to take a few steps closer. Small children may not be exposed to the cheesecake. I believe that specially plated forks might be appropriate utensils. I consumed half of my cheesecake slice and promptly forgot most of what happened afterwards. There are fleeting memories of feverish hallucinations involving sugar, Dr. Atkins and the inverted cross. All in all, I have to say it was a good day.

 I have some personal posts to go through, so for you hard-core political types, you may want to skip along. I've been away long enough that I thought I should register some thoughts here. For starters, my hockey season is now over. My first season at SoccerZone, and I managed to reach the semi-finals. We rushed back from Ohio on Sunday so I could make the 4 PM start time, only to see us go down in ignomious defeat. Unfortunately, our team only dressed 4 skaters plus me in the goal, while the other side had a full roster of 8 skaters. At the end of the first half, we were up 9-4. We ended up losing 13-9, with the last three goals coming in the final 90 seconds. They just wore us down to nothing and we couldn't keep up with the fresh legs. Even so, I had a good time with the game, and played fairly well despite the score. Next season starts in two weeks, and I'll be on the same team. It was nice that they asked my to come back and wanted to retain me. There's nothing like praise from one's peers, so I took it in the spirit with which it was intended.

 My Quest -- This is a two-fold quest, with the ultimate outcome being the completion of the quest and the hopeful effect (affect?) it will have on me. With all the hub-bub over the latest Moore flick, and some disturbing "You MUST see this" emails from some close friends, I have stumbled upon a new mantra for myself. "I refuse to be spun." So, I need everyone's help, I am on the look-out for Spin-free information. Any ideas? My issue is that I rail against the people who watch the Moore film and come out "spun". It's a play on their own ignorance and they are too ignorant to understand it. But then I realized, where are my beliefs rooted? Is it because I myself have been spun (maybe even from the likes Todd himself, my main source of political information?) I find myself in heated discussions re-hashing Todd's emails, not my own thoughts. So I am on the look-out, along with Steve, for my Own Opinion . No more ignoring not having it. Of course, I may have to give up this blog, and any hold on reality since it is impossible to be "spin-free". So, let me amend my quest, I want to be a regular reader of "extreme spin" news on both sides. Maybe they will cancel each other out. Ultimately, I would love to have a list of sites that will provide me with extreme spin news and some sites that are relatively spin-less. I am going to start to gather this list and implement the plan as soon as possible.

 Back to Work I'm back at the office today wading through a little over 100 emails and trying to figure out what's going on. I've decided not to spend too much time trying to catch up on the news of the past week, other than a few items I want to comment on later. If all goes well this evening, I'll have quite a few posts. And welcome to Terry Winters, who posted a few comments - notably a nice tip on a cheap hard drive for Steve. Good deal there! Anyway, none of you know Terry. He is a coworker here at Pfizer who shares the next cubicle. We had an interesting conversation on Iraq on my last day here prior to vacation, and I gave him the Blog URL. He should bring a good perspective to our ramblings. More later....

 urlLink Yahoo! News - Scientist Sees Space Elevator in 15 Years This is one of the things I want to see happen beofre I die. We must explore and utilize space. And the United States must lead the way if such exploration is to benefit mankind. Whatever nation harvests the vast bounty of the cosmos fisrt will reap a bounty so great it cannot be overcome. This is like the great voyages of discovery of Columbus, Magellan, Cook and others. Rather, the elevator is a tool as important as the compass rose. With it, we can build space vehicles with no need for non-space flight. Costs will go down and utility will rise. I ask myself how anyone can begrudge the paltry $10 billion this project is estimated to cost? This needs to be done, and the sooner the better.

 Back in town... I apologize for the quadruple post about me going on vacation. The post wouldn't submit, but it seems it really did without reporting success. I cleaned it up now. I have a few things to recount when I get some time later, so look for some postings tonight or tomorrow.

 I'm looking to buy a new Hard Drive. I want to spend only about $50. A small drive is perfectly fine.... Anyone have suggestions as to brands, online vendors, and/or specs?

 Hello, anyone out there? &nbsp; If anyone cares, I'm going on the actual vacation part of my vacation today and tomorrow.&nbsp; Diane and I are heading over to Cleveland for a few days to get away from it all.&nbsp; I'll be back on Thursday with some more posts.&nbsp; Maybe someone else will have some things for the next few days (hint hint). &nbsp; Later....

 urlLink My Way - News : "Secretary-General Kofi Annan declared on Monday there was an 'alarming resurgence' of anti-Semitism in the world and called for U.N. bodies to adopt resolutions and investigate the ancient scourge." Gee Kofi...maybe you should try checking out your own organization first?

 urlLink IRAQ THE MODEL : Mohamed at Iraq the Model has some thoughts on Paul Johnson. "Paul Johnson; you are much closer to Allah than those who kill innocents in his name. What's happening and what for!? Why would a man who has committed nothing wrong and not only that, who was giving valuable services to people who live far away from his home, get killed in such a barbarian way?? Why this extreme brutality and disgusting crime that has nothing to do with humanity and that doesn't fit with any religion or human morals? Why the persistence on using arms of the dark ages in this time and why insisting on spreading those pictures with the horrible details?" Not all Iraqis hate us. And it is nice to see the occasional Muslim speak out against those that hijack an entire faith. As I've said before, we need to protect and amplify those willing to stand up against Theocracy.

 urlLink DefenseLINK News: Iraqi Official to American Press: Report More Good Even the Iraqis recognize the bias when they see it. Too bad Americans are generally apathetic about the data they get from the networks. Barham Salih, a prominent leader from Kurdish northern Iraq, made his plea June 19 to American reporters traveling in Iraq with Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz. "I hope you from the American press will be able to tell people back home … that (through) this mission you are giving an entire nation an opportunity to be rid of their challenges," he said. "These soldiers are helping renovate schools and so on, and very, very little of that is reported," Salih continued. "We have to be grateful to those young men and women who have come from afar, sacrificing their lives to defend our security and our freedom." He said context is important, and many American papers don't put things in the proper context. For instance, he said, "Many of the op-ed writers before the war predicted that Kirkuk would become the scene of the most vicious civil war," he said, referring to the northern Iraqi city that has been the site of problems between Kurds and Arabs. "There are tensions in Kirkuk," he said, "but no civil war." New Iraqi President Ghazi al-Yawer explained his belief that 90 percent of what's happening in Iraq is good news, and 10 percent in bad. "The media is magnifying the 10 percent, ignoring the 90 percent," Yawer said. He said the scandal surrounding detainee abuses at Baghdad's Abu Ghraib prison is a perfect example. The issue is clearer to people like him who have lived in the United States and understand American values, he said. "I know this is outrageous to the American public (and) to the American administration as much as it is outrageous to the Iraqis," Yawer said. But, he added, regular Iraqis "have been breastfed hatred to the United States and Great Britain for 45 years." Yawer said he and other Iraqi leaders are working to acquaint the Iraqi people "with the real values of the American Bill of Rights and other great things you have in your constitution."

 urlLink CNN.com - Al Qaeda militants say�they were helped by Saudi forces - Jun 21, 2004 This ties in with my earlier post about Saudi Arabia. Sure, there's a chance the AQ guys could be lying about this, but would you be surprised if the Saudi's are rendering aid? When we talk about 'our friend the Saudi's', we are talking about the Royal Family, not the nation as a whole. Much as it used to be 'our friends, the Iranians' back when the Shah was in power. Yeah, it's ugly, and certainly lacks the idealism that Americans seem to prefer, but the reality is a little darker than we want to believe. The royal family is useful to keep the Saudi's in line and keep the oil flowing. That's about it. We've managed to ignore the Wahhabi problem for decades, but as the nature of the War on Terror evolves, we're going to have to deal with the issue. Another reason why Iraq is so important. When the Saudi Revolution occurs, we need to be in a position to move quickly. The oil fields are too vital to let them fall into the wrong hands.

 urlLink In the Media As much as I bash Democrats, from time to time one of them says something that deserves praise. I picked this up on urlLink Instapundit . Joe Leiberman, in his own words. The Islamist jihadist terrorists who wage holy war against us in Iraq and elsewhere represent a system of values exactly the opposite of America's. There is no better way to know this enemy than to read their words. The father of the jihadist movement, Sayyed Qutb [KUH-tahb] of Egypt, wrote in 1952, “The death of those who are killed for the cause of God gives more impetus to the cause, which continues to thrive on their blood.” The cause of which he speaks is to “establish a [Muslim] state” that “sets moral values,” “abolish[es] man-made laws” and that would impose, by force if necessary, the Islamic system on “all human beings, whether they be rulers or ruled, black or white, poor or rich, ignorant or learned.” This is a radicalized, violent vision of Islam, as yet embraced by only a minority of Muslims. Pluralism of any kind – a diversity of views or faiths – affronts this radical minority's absolutist vision. Their theological totalitarianism leaves no room for individual freedom. Restoring the caliphate – the seat of secular and ecclesiastical power that existed for centuries across a wide territory – is their goal. You can read it in their writings: They would create a new evil empire, stretching from Istanbul to Islamabad, from Khartoum to Kabul, from Kuala Lampur to Bangkok, and beyond. Osama Bin Laden is the leading advocate of this jihadist view in the world today, the current mastermind of this malevolent movement. Every American should carefully read his clearly stated words of intention to know why we must defeat him. In his “Declaration of the World Islamic Front for Jihad,” issued in February 1998, Bin Laden says that “to kill Americans and their allies, both civil and military, is an individual duty of every Muslim… every Muslim who believes in God and hopes for reward [must] obey God's command to kill the Americans and plunder their possessions wherever he finds them and whenever he can.” In his November 1998 “Letter to America,” Bin Laden condemned the United States because, he said, like all democracies, it is a “nation who, rather than ruling by the Sharia of Allah in its Constitution and Laws, chooses to invent your own laws as you will and desire.” After September 11th attacks, he gloated triumphantly that “the values of Western civilization… of liberty, human rights, and humanity, have been destroyed.” In this war of ideas and values, Bin Laden is the quintessential anti-American. . . . The prison abuse scandal has caused many to question our moral standing in Iraq and to use it as an excuse to pull our troops out. That is thoroughly unjustified and profoundly dangerous. As I said earlier, the terrorists will never defeat us militarily. We cannot let them defeat us politically. Here here! Too bad people like Joe are driven from their party, much as Zell Miller in Georgia. If the democrats could embrace rationality, then the nation as a whole would be better served.

 urlLink United Press International: 9/11 panel: New evidence on Iraq-Al-Qaida Here's another reason why I think the harshest critics on the Left might be digging thier own metaphorical mass grave when it comes to the assertions that 'there are no WMD', or 'there is no connection between Iraq and al-Qaeda'. Excerpt - The commission investigating the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks has received new information indicating that a senior officer in an elite unit of the security services of deposed Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein may have been a member of al-Qaida involved in the planning of the suicide hijackings, panel members said Sunday. News will continue to come out, and I think the case of the Left will continue to decay as we approach the election. Unfortunately, the media will continue to grind away with their slant. Here's an excerpt from urlLink Boortz this morning. Excerpt - The 9/11 Commission found there was a connection between Iraq and Al Qaeda. Maybe not actual collaboration, but there was a connection. Now ... read the headlines: "Saddam, al-Qaeda Not Linked. Sept. 11 Panel's Conclusion at Odds with Administration." Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. "9/11 Panel Debunks Saddam Link. Report: No Evidence of al-Qaeda Ties." Pittsburgh Tribune-Review Now listen to the words of Keith Olberman of MSNBC last Wednesday. "Memo to vice president: 9/11 Commission finds 'no credible evidence' of any link between al-Qaeda and Iraq." You've already seen the stories ran by The Washington Post, the New York Times, CNN, Associated Press and more, all saying the same thing; all saying that the panel had found no link between Iraq and al Qaeda. Now ... what does the Vice Chairman of the Panel say? Lee Hamilton says "There were connections between al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein's government. We don't disagree with that. What we have said is that we don't have any evidence of a cooperative or a collaborative relationship between Saddam Hussein's government and these al-Qaeda operatives with regard to attacks on the United States." So the media is blasting Bush for something he didn't say, contorting his words of a connection between Iraq and AQ as a statement that Iraq had a leading role in 9/11. Who knows, before this is all over, we might just find out that there was some connection, but for the moment, the US Administration hasn't made any such statement. When will the media do their job?

 urlLink No One Asked Us Major Stan Coerr is a Marine that served in Iraq, and has some things to say about why we fight. Semper Fi. Read the whole thing. Excerpt- "I stood on the bloody sand where Marine Second Lieutenant Therrel Childers was the first American killed on the ground. I pointed a loaded weapon at another man for the first time in my life. I did what I had spent 14 years training to do, and my Marines - your Marines - performed so well it still brings tears to my eyes to think about it. I was proud of what we did then, and I am proud of it now. Along with the violence, I saw many things that lifted my heart. I saw thousands of Iraqis in cities like Qurnah and Medinah - men, women, children, grandparents carrying babies - running into the streets at the sight of us, the first Western army to arrive. I saw them screaming, crying, waving, cheering. They ran from their homes at the sound of our Humvee tires roaring in from the south, bringing bread and tea and cigarettes and photos of their children. They chattered at us in Arabic, and we spoke to them in English, and neither understood the other. The entire time I was in Iraq, I had one impression from the civilians I met: Thank God, finally someone has arrived with bigger men and bigger guns to be, at last, on our side."

 urlLink Hammorabi : The Hammorabi Blog is another originating from inside Iraq, written by a native Iraqi. It's gratifying to see his reaction to the murder of Paul Johnson and the subsequent killing of the thugs who murdered him, even if the Saudis acted too late. Excerpt- "It is confirmed now that Abd-Alaziz Bin-Essa Bin-Hammad Al-Muqrin (33 years) the leader of the Qaeda in KSA and top two of his thugs (Faisal & Abdulaziz Al-Dakheel) have been send to HELL killed. He was most likely the one who appeared in the video of Falluja Brigade which threatned to kill PJ. The question is not how he was killed but why not have been captured before or killed? And is this means the Saudi securty have not done enough to crak down the terrorist? Now the Saudi securty received the orders to finish Muqrin only now to avoid the wrath of the civilized people! Why not before!? Why not before? A big question need not answers but millions of answers! Finish the Wahabism which is the doctrine and ideology feeds the terrorists! Hell is the place of Muqriin and soon for Zarqawi! "

 urlLink CNN.com - Hospital: 17 Iraqis killed in Fallujah airstrike - Jun 19, 2004 US Forces struck a number of houses in Fallujah and killed 17 Iraqis. At the same time, CNN is now reporting that one of the houses destroyed was a safehouse of al-Zarqawi. This is encouraging news. I wonder if we got him? That would certainly be a plus. We'll see how the news develops. While the enemies of the war will certainly decry any bombing of houses in the middle of the city, I think we have to keep a historical perspective of war in general. At least we aren't looking at Dresden or Tokyo here in terms of raw carnage. I know, little consolation to the Iraqi boy playing the street when the bombs come, but I don't see how it can be helped. The enemy is engaging in asymettric warfare, using the general population to cloak the guerilla forces. The best thing the civilian population can do to help themselves is begin to stand up against those that would use them in this fashion. Evidence suggests that many Iraqis are starting to do just that - turning in their neighbors and feeding information to the coallition. I wouldn't be surprised to find out that some Iraqis dropped the dime on these safehouses. Civilian death is regretable, but the survivors will have a better life someday.

 urlLink DRUDGE REPORT FLASH 2002� I'm posting these images because I think it is important that you all have a chance to view them. Yeah, they are graphic and disturbing, but much like the Nick Berg video, I think it is important that we confront evil for what it is. Those of us who support the war have a responsibility to consider the nastiness and brutality of the conflict - it's easy to give lip service if you don't consider what it really means. Those of you who oppose the war might want to try to understand what the Islamic world has in store for us if we continue to show weakness. It's your choice.

 urlLink FOXNews.com - U.S. & World - Saudi Al Qaeda Leader Killed in Riyadh Well, at least we got one of the bastards today. Although I have to admit some surprise that a terrorist was actually killed in Saudi Arabia, but Saudis! The Saudis have a long history of not trying too hard to find Islamic terrorists on their own soil. You may recall in the hostage siege a few weeks ago, the Saudi forces allowed several of the bad guys to get away. I guess that's what you get in a country that actively supports Wahhabi Islam. Saudi Arabia will never really be a friend of ours, and we are merely uneasy dependents for now - we need their oil, they need our money. The Saudi issue is so complicated, and the longer we are beholden to their oil, the longer we're going to be forced to maintain this uneasy dance with them. All the more reason we need to return to domestic oil exploration, as well as doing all we can to help the Russians develop and export their vast oil reserves. Until then, we can't afford to let the House of Saud go under, so we are forced to play this game that we are allies. The reality is that Saudi Arabia is a ticking time bomb of potential hatred. urlLink 43% of the population of Saudi Arabia is under the age of 14. Couple young people with high unemployment, radical Wahhabi Islam, and a festering hatred for all things Western, and the result are quite predictable. So for now, we have to help the Saudi family remain in power, stabilize the oil supply, and build up Iraq as a nice convenient staging point to exert influence on the region for that inevitable day when the Islamic revolution takes over a sizable percentage of the world oil supply. The war in Iraq extends well beyond the War on Terror. This is just the first stage in a radical strategy to finally confront the mess in the Middle East.

 urlLink Welcome to the Mojave Airport and the Civilian Flight Test Center From an earlier blog topic a few weeks ago. The Mojave Airport has been officially certified by the FAA as a spaceport.

 Why am I always so nervous meeting people? I guess I'm surprised at how timid I can be when it comes to strangers. Several months ago, I saw a guy here at work reading a book about screenwriting during lunch. I quietly filed the observation away and didn't act on it, until recently. A few weeks ago I sent him an email (after figuring out his identity), and introduced myself as someone also interested in writing. We had a good exchange, but business at work and a vacation on his part prevented us from actually meeting face to face. Until today. I'm about to go have lunch with him, and try to figure out what we have in common with the hopes of finding someone who has a strong interest in writing. Hopefully the email exchanges are some indication of a positive conversation. I'm also taking a sample of Wrecks with me to pawn off on him. I'll report back later.

 Might as well post two films tonight. Diane and I watched Mystic River tonight, and I should comment on how good it was. As much as I'd love to stuff both Tim Robbins and Sean Penn in a deep dark hole, I usually enjoy their films. They continue with their strings of fine work with this one. Mystic River was directed by Clint Eastwood, who continues to demonstrate his outstanding ability to craft films. What struck me about this one was the pacing - the story can get quite convoluted, and at 2 hours and 15 minutes, it's pretty long. But all of the details, and all the development never escaped me. I never once had to stop and think "who is this guy again? What was his name?" It flowed along like a great novel, and when the tragic inevitability began to loom in the distance, I could see it while still hoping it could be avoided. Like House of Sand and Fog, the characters in this story are all flawed, and essentially aren't bad human beings. An argument can be made about Sean Penn, but I still found him sympathetic - a man living by a rough code, doing what he sees as right. Everyone has a big jagged piece of glass in their soul here, and the pain propels them along in ever tightening circles, leading to mistakes that can't be undone. The only weakness is in the Kevin Bacon character...not in Bacon's performance, but in the way the story manufactures his own little subset of pain that really has little to do with the story. Maybe some of the meat had been cut from the film, but as it stands his issue should have been completely removed. I would recommend Mystic River with the same enthusiasm that I recommended House of Sand and Fog. Films like this work to return my optimism about cinema.

 I watched 28 Days Later on Tuesday, and I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. It's two hours long, so when I popped it in, I anticipated some impatience to get through it. My expectations weren't that high. The two hours flew by. There's nothing huge here, no wonderful effects, no Big Moments that will Alter My Life. It was just a fun, entertaining, well written, wonderfully filmed piece of work, even for an $8 million dollar budget. urlLink The Mojo reveals the film made $82 million on $15 million in expenses. That made me happy, because it deserves to make some cash. 28 Days was directed by the guy who directed Trainspotting (which is another great film), and his use of digital video was a great choice for this particular story. It has a grittiness that works well for the subject material. The DVD includes two alternate endings, plus one radical alternate ending that changes the movie from the halfway point. The radical ending is told with storyboards and dialogue, similar to one of the alternate endings on the Se7en DVD. For once, the primary ending, despite being upbeat, was perfect for the tone of the film. If you know anything about me, I love films that give you a good swift kick on the nether regions on the way out, but in this case, I liked it better with the 'happy' conclusion. Call me soft, but it worked well here. No, it isn't a typical Elite Bastard film. It isn't the archetype of all films of this genre, and it won't whiten your teeth...but I really enjoyed it despite being skeptical. Give it a view, and watch the different endings.

In China, which saw surging economic growth last year, the number of high-net-worth individuals rose 12 percent and India 22 percent. Europe showed a more modest increase, with the number of millionaires up 2.4 percent to 2.6 million. �That partly can be attributed to the more restrictive European income-tax policies which impeded personal wealth accumulation,� the report said."

 More UNMOVIC stuff... I ran a search on both CNN and Fox News, using the words "UNMOVIC Quarterly report".

Indeed, as Kass has repeatedly stated, "the finitude of human life is a blessing for every individual, whether he knows it or not." And frighteningly, when asked by Brian Alexander, the author of Rapture: How Biotechnology Became the New Religion, if the government has a right to tell its citizens that they have to die, Fukuyama answered, "Yes, absolutely."

 urlLink UNMOVIC Quarterly Briefing This is in relation to the previous post, and the comments about the news report not being true. I've linked here the Quarterly Briefing to the Security Council by UNMOVIC. Excerpts - The Commission’s experts are conducting an investigation in parallel with the IAEA Iraq Nuclear Verification Office regarding the discovery of items from Iraq that are relevant to the mandates of UNMOVIC and IAEA at a scrapyard in the Netherlands. In particular, following a visit of IAEA to a scrapyard in Rotterdam to investigate increased radiation readings, it was discovered, through photographs taken at the time, that engines of SA-2 surface-to-air missiles were among the scrap (see figure below). They are the type of engines used in the Al Samoud 2 proscribed missile programme. In addition, a number of items and equipment that may also be relevant to the UNMOVIC mandate were seen among the scrap. The existence of missile engines originating in Iraq among scrap in Europe may affect the accounting of proscribed engines known to have been in Iraq’s possession in March 2003. Both IAEA and UNMOVIC have kept the Security Council informed of this matter. ... Representatives of the scrapyard company indicated that a number of similar engines (5 to 12) had been seen in the scrapyard in January and February of this year. More engines could have been processed and passed through the yard unnoticed. Company staff confirmed that other items made of stainless steel and other corrosion-resistant metal alloys bearing the inscription “Iraq” or “Baghdad” had been observed in shipments delivered from the Middle East since November 2003. ... It should also be noted that the scrapyard that was visited by UNMOVIC deals in high-quality stainless steel. Items and equipment made of dual-use materials subject to the provisions of the monitoring plan may also be coming out of Iraq to other destinations. The Commission is continuing its investigation. ... In addition, the Commission is aware from comparative analysis of recent satellite imagery that a number of sites previously known to have contained equipment and materials subject to monitoring have been either cleaned out or destroyed. ... There is much evidence that from 1999 to 2002 Iraq procured materials, equipment and components for use in its missile programmes. In several instances, the items procured were used by Iraq for programmes, such as the production of Al Samoud 2 missiles, that were determined by UNMOVIC in February 2003 to be proscribed. ... The same Iraqi governmental trading company was involved, through a contract with two foreign private companies, in procuring components and equipment for the manufacture and testing of missile guidance and control systems, including inertial navigation systems with fibre-optic and laser ring gyroscopes and Global Positioning System equipment, accelerometers, ancillary items and a variety of production and testing equipment. The list of items sought includes several that were not declared or shown to UNMOVIC during the course of its inspections. There's plenty more. Read the whole thing - it's only 15 pages. The evidence is clear that Iraq was 1) not revealing what they had, 2) pursuing proscribed technology, 3) violating UN mandates on weapons tech, and 4) making false statements about disarming. Sure, as far as we know, we don't have the smoking gun of a nuclear weapon, but the UN mandate extended to many banned technologies, all of which Iraq had continued to pursue. Do you really think he wasn't trying to get WMD tech?

For the fourth time, a court in France has fined her for saying something bad about Muslims. Quote - “Mme. Bardot presents Muslims as barbaric and cruel invaders, responsible for terrorist acts and eager to dominate the French to the extent of wanting to exterminate them,” the court said." Uh, yeah. And what part of that isn't true? Anyway, remember that France is a model nation of the Leftist cause. They want us to be more like that.

Here is what appears on the Georgia Department of Revenue web site regarding the Real Estate Transfer tax. "The real estate transfer tax is not a property tax. It is an excise tax on the privilege of selling property." Privilege??? Granted by whom? Do we or do we not own our own land (unfortunately, the answer is 'no, we don't'). This is the kind of thing that is all too common nowadays, akin to Mark's post about 'Mandatory Registration'. We just accept it and move on, without really considering what it means on a deeper level. If you accept this statement, you endorse the idea that the State government owns your property, since they grant the 'privilege' of selling it. Welcome to serfdom. And thank a Leftist....

 urlLink Stem Cell Research OK, here is an issue that completely sets me against GWB and the GOP position. Any curtailment of bioresearch is unacceptable to me, and I'll speak out any time I have the chance. The fact is - I want to live as long as possible, and if medical science has a shot at extending my life, then I want that research to happen. There have been some promising finds in anti-aging research, and it isn't a fantasy to beleive that a child born today could live 150-200 years baring an accident. By the time they finally pass on, children born in that year might live three times as long, or even have a reasonable life expectency measured in millenia, given body replacement technology. Glenn Reynolds of Instapundit had a column at TechCentralStarion today, linked urlLink here about longevity. It raises some intersting questions - notably, how will people react to research that might one day make death an accident? And how do we meet the objections of the religious who might oppose the idea that we can 'escape God's judgment' by avoiding death? Or how about the environmental people who complain about overcrowding (which is a myth) and wish to preserve our 'natural' life span? I'm with Mr. Reynolds - death sucks, and natural is not always good. Anto-aging research, as well as death prevention technology, is a moral requirement. Anyone care to argue that we have a duty to die? I'm loaded for bear on this one, so bring it on....(spoiling for a good argument too, so help me out here.)

Note that he built this whole thing for one specific scenario - it isn't usable for any other. An example of the typical level of dedication you will find in ASL players, and yes, I would love to start building my own maps when I can accumulate some supplies. The scenario revovled around an attempted capture of Tito by German SS Fallshirmjagers (paratroopers) arriving by both chute and glider. It was an amazing scenario! Particularly when a stick of SS men mis-dropped right into the center of town, only to be whacked by Partisans before they could even touch the ground. On the other side of the map, another group of SS managed to come down right on top of my defensive position and engaged in Hand to Hand combat practically while still wearing parachutes. They slaughtered some of my men and secured the flank. Ubermenschen in action. Anyway, most of you don't really care, but my enthusiasm for the game knows no bounds. It is the ultimate game system - really more of a lifestyle. And I'll be glad to run demos at a moments notice....

 urlLink New England Republican: Tom Brokaw Interviews President Bush Media bias? New England Republican compared a video of an interview by Tom Brokaw with President Bush, then compared it to the transcript. Take a look at this sample (bold items were excised from the video). Brokaw: “And you were not greeted as liberators like Vice President Cheney said that you would be.” Bush: “Well, I think we've been -- let me just -- I think we've been thanked by the people of Iraq. And I think you'll hear more of that from people like Prime Minister Alawi and the foreign minister, who both have repeatedly, ‘Thank you for what you've done, and by the way, help us.’ “It's not easy work to take a country from tyranny to a free society. And we'd been there a little over a year. And it's-- you might recall if you're looking for parallels in World War II, it took about four years to get an active reconstruction effort going. “And in my speech that you referred to, I make-- pointed out that in the immediate aftermath of World War II, there was a-- the Soviet Union exploded a bomb, that China went communist. It was a question of whether or not the Greek government would go communist. “The reconstruction effort was halting at best. The marshal plan hadn't been started. And I-- my only point is, these are difficult assignments. It was a difficult assignment then. It's a difficult assignment now. And what America must do is understand the consequences of getting it right. And the consequences of getting right is that a free society in the Middle East is going to help change the country, change the countries in the Middle East and make us more secure and the world more peaceful.” Remember this next time you see a taped interview of the President. They don't seem to have a problem taking out portions of his answers that might actually help bolster his case for going into Iraq.

 The saddest thing you could ever experience, even from a distance.... My brother Mark and his wife Amber lost their baby. She was about 6 months pregnant. The cause is still uncertain, but an infection seems to be the likely culprit. They were in the hospital on Sunday and all seemed OK. They went back Sunday night and he was gone. She gave birth to Aiden Curick Mayo on Monday morning. He was about 2.5 lbs, about 13 inches long. He had Mark's mouth and Amber's dark hair. Curick (sp?) is for both his grandfathers' middle names - Curtis and Frederick. I was there on Monday afternoon and got to hold him. He was bundled up in blankets and wore a knitted blue cap. At first it was difficult to touch his downy little face - my fingers just wouldn't go down all the way - but Mark unbundled him to show me his long fingers and encouraged me silently... The hardest part, for the interlopers at least, is verbalizing. What to say, what not to say. How much to give without getting in the way. Immediate plans, insipid details, emotional platitudes...it seems impossibly and simultaneously both vital and futile. Though I am still uncertain as to what role the Lord has in my own life, I'm thankful that He is in my childrens' life. It is such a fragile existence....I am eternally grateful that my two are healthy and intelligent - and more spiritual than I.

"Looking back now, we can trace some of the flaws of the current Washington mindset — the tax-cut-driven deficits, the slogan-driven foreign policy — to Mr. Reagan's example...." "He profited from good timing and good luck, coming along when the country was tired of the dour pedantry of the Carter administration, wounded by the Iranian hostage crisis, frustrated by rising unemployment and unyielding inflation. Mr. Reagan's stubborn refusal to accept the permanence of Communism helped end the cold war. He was fortunate to have as his counterpart Mikhail Gorbachev, a Soviet leader ready to acknowledge his society's failings and interested in reducing international tensions." "...The flawed theory behind the Reagan tax cuts, that the ensuing jolt to the economy would bring in enough money to balance the budget, is still espoused by many of the Republican faithful, including President Bush..." "...Today, we live in an era defined by that particular kind of simplicity, which expresses itself in semi-detached leadership and a black-and-white view of the world.

 urlLink From Revolution to Reconstruction: Presidents: Ronald Wilson Reagan: Speech at Pointe de Hoc : Twenty years ago, Reagan gave a speech at Pointe-du-Hoc. Since we've addressed both of them today, I went looking for the text of the speech. It's worth reading the whole thing, but here is a taste. "We stand on a lonely, windswept point on the northern shore of France. The air is soft, but forty years ago at this moment, the air was dense with smoke and the cries of men, and the air was filled with the crack of rifle fire and the roar of cannon. At dawn, on the morning of the 6th of June 1944, 225 Rangers jumped off the British landing craft and ran to the bottom of these cliffs. Their mission was one of the most difficult and daring of the invasion: to climb these sheer and desolate cliffs and take out the enemy guns. The Allies had been told that some of the mightiest of these guns were here and they would be trained on the beaches to stop the Allied advance. The Rangers looked up and saw the enemy soldiers -- at the edge of the cliffs shooting down at them with machine-guns and throwing grenades. And the American Rangers began to climb. They shot rope ladders over the face of these cliffs and began to pull themselves up. When one Ranger fell, another would take his place. When one rope was cut, a Ranger would grab another and begin his climb again. They climbed, shot back, and held their footing. Soon, one by one, the Rangers pulled themselves over the top, and in seizing the firm land at the top of these cliffs, they began to seize back the continent of Europe. Two hundred and twenty-five came here. After two days of fighting only ninety could still bear arms. "

Oh, and 9/11? That was his. Osama bin Laden and his fellow Afghan 'freedom fighters' got their funding, and nasty weapons, from Reagan. A real piece of work, Reagan ruined the federal budget, trashed education, alienated our friends and allies and made us a laughing stock around the world. Hmmmm...sounds familiar. Anyway, I'm sure he's turning crispy brown right about now."

 Ronald Reagan: Greatest President of the 20th Century Forgive me if this is meandering and overly sappy. Reagan is the greatest President of the 20th century because he showed us the truth of what we could be. He was our messiah in a time of great danger. A Moses who parted the Red Sea of Communism and lead the world to the prmised land. Do not scoff or roll your eyes. If you were in front of me I would slap you. Communism was Reagan's great focus. I agree with him that collectivism is the greatest threat to humanity that has ever existed. Reagan led the world in the fight against it. People decry the spending and tax cuts that Reagan forced througha begrudging Democrat Congress. They say victory against Communism was a forgone conclusion. They say Reagan ruined the economy. They reduce Reagan to a clever actor in over his head. They are liars. The President is the most important man in the world. He sets the tone for all of humanity. Nixon, Ford, Carter: these were weak men with small and timid ideas. Reagan had big ideas and the will to make them happen. Cutting taxes on the wealthy led to the greatest prosperity the world has ever seen. Building up our armed forces to undefeatable heights forced the Soviets to implode. Reagan's love of America, of freedom, and of the human spirit changed the face of the earth. Imagine the world if Reagan lost to Carter? You can't, and thats a good thing. Reagan gave us hope in a time of hopelessness. He solved our problems by reducing them to insignifigance. Our spirits were lifted above them. We destroyed Communism in Europe and continue to do so In China because we refuse to stop being who we should be. We are now no longer afraid of petty tyrants and despots. There is no sense of hopelessness and defeatism in America today. At least not in the "real" America of the urlLink Red states. My first recollection of Reagan was after the Challenger disaster. I remember being heartbroken, even at the tender age of 8. I don't remember what he said, but I do remember seeing Reagan on TV comforting the nation. I remember a few other of his speeches and conferences. Of course I was too young to appreciate it but I use Reagan as my reference for Presidents. I can tell you no man since has been his equal. George W. Bush is the inheritor of Reagan's spirit, but he cannot equal his progenitor. I love Reagan and I believe the rest of America loves him because he was the best of us. What other President can be seen as so American? Honest, compassionate, dilligent, eloquent, steadfast, brave, and proud. He saw us as the beacon of freedom, the greatest hope of humanity. his legacy will carry on with us for the rest of our lives. How many other men can lay claim to such greatness? I consider myself fortunate to be able to look back and appreciate what those who came before have left for me. We should all seek to leave the world better than when we found it, as Ronald Reagan did.

 I can’t let D-Day get away from me without some sort of post. As a World War II fanatic, yesterday had particular importance to me. I can easily stand behind the idea that June 6, 1944 was the single most important day in the 20th century, and the outcome was far from certain. While many may argue that Nazi Germany couldn’t possibly hold out against the combined might of the Allies, imagine what would have happened if this assault had failed? Imagine fifty thousand dead, with a follow up invasion put off by another year, or even two. Imagine the possibility that an exhausted England could have lost the will to fight, and would have given Hitler the peace he so wanted in the west. Or imagine an America that lost interest during the delay, and decided that if England wanted peace, then perhaps America should pay more attention to the Pacific. The days after June 6th were far from certain. In light of the troubles we face today, it is difficult to imagine any current generation meeting this challenge the way they did back then. While the 1940s generation made a decision over what was worth dying for, the current generations have a hard enough time figuring out what to live for. These men (and women) accepted the situation and went out and got the job done in ways that still brings tears to my eyes. I see these veterans on TV and I get emotional, knowing that all the adulation and praise being heaped at their feet on the part of the media is mostly phony. Yeah, phony. We praise their sacrifice and bravery while at the same time allowing our own children to fail learning the lessons they teach. Children come out of school understanding that the American’s interred Japanese-Americans in camps, but they don’t recognize the name Iwo Jima or Tarawa. They can’t name the date of the Normandy Invasion, but they understand that we dropped nuclear bombs on Japan when ‘the war was all but over’. If we really honored the men of WW II, we would fix this. I for one plan on making my kids sick with information about these men, and if they don’t also tear up when they see the graveyards in France, then I have failed as a parent. Watching the D-Day clips on TV, I think about the rangers at Pointe du Hoc (climbing a 100 ft cliff in broad daylight while the Germans stood up on top and shot down at them), or Major Howard’s Englishmen at Pegasus Bridge, seizing a vital crossroads in a night glider landing in the early morning hours, or of St Mere-Eligse and the Airborne soldier hanging on the steeple, helpless as the Germans gunned him down. I think about the miracle of the FUSAG deception, using the name of Patton to freeze two Panzer divisions at Calais, buying valuable time for the beachhead to gain a hold on the thin sliver of bloody sand. And I think about the individual soldiers, nineteen years old, dropping from the sky or wading through five feet of water in a hail of gunfire, knowing only that this was probably his last moment on earth, yet filled with a resolve not to let his buddies down. Where do such men come from? They spring from a free society, but I’m not sure we’re making them anymore.

 urlLink The Washington Times: AP As is usual, those directly effected understand the truth. Reagan's death is being particular felt in Eastern Europe. They get it. "'For us, Reagan was important because we knew he was really anti-communist, emotionally anti-communist,' said Zdenek Kosina, 65, a Czech computer specialist. 'For us, he was a symbol of the United States' genuine determination to bring communism to an end.' Laurentiu Ivan, 35, a customs officer in the Romanian capital, struggled to describe Reagan's legacy and then said: 'It is due to him that we are free.'" I think in another ten years, we will see similar reactions from the Middle East.

 Ronaldus Magnus 1911-2004 When someone of importance dies, it is fashionable for all the columnists and news outfits to begun running eulogies or other commentaries about the life of whomever just died. The web is choking with summaries of Reagan’s life and accomplishments, and I’m sure you’ve had your fill of them this weekend. Instead, I feel compelled to focus on what Reagan meant to me personally. The news of his death isn’t really a surprise, and in many ways, it is a relief to know that the body has followed the mind, years late. I can’t fathom the experience of the past decade for his family, and particularly for Mrs. Reagan. It must be a particular form of hell to watch someone drift away from you in slow motion, knowing that he isn’t really in there anymore, yet the body still demands attention. If there is a God, surely Reagan has been restored, and that’s a thought that fills me with some hope. Early on Saturday morning, I read on Drudge that Reagan wasn’t likely to make it through the day (how does Drudge do it?). I went on to my day of ASL, but my thoughts were already turning toward the 80s and what it meant for the nation and the world. When I left ASL at 4 PM, the news had broke on the car radio, so I had another hour of drive time to really think about things as the fading AM station began a long, detailed summary of Reagan’s life, complete with sound bites. In fact, there were so many quality pieces both on the radio and Fox News later; I suspect people had been quite busy getting this stuff together for quite some time. I’m sure they have prepared packages for a lot of public figures… My reactions in the car surprised me. Like I had said, this wasn’t a surprise. Yet I still felt waves of sadness, while at the same time, a fierce appreciation that a man like this had lived, and had risen to office precisely when the world needed him. History has a way of producing the right men at the right time, introducing them to us at the very moment we most need whatever quality they bring along. With Reagan, history provided. Listening to portions of speeches, I was reminded of his strength and optimism, his warmth and resolve. Here was a man who didn’t need nuance. He knew what he saw, and labeled it as such, while at the same time not letting us forget that the root of his optimism came from us – we lifted him, and he simply pointed that out to us at a time when we couldn’t see it. It is a testament to Reagan’s success that the very things he opposed have been demolished to such an extent it is easy to forget how threatening the times were. The Soviet Union a memory, the Iron Curtain a quaint historical term, the Berlin Wall nothing more than a museum piece, and the malaise of the 1970s as something we scratch our heads over in bemusement. Whether you wish to believe his policies accomplished all of these things is your personal choice, since many will refuse to credit him until their last breath. I don’t need to defend him. History will get it right, and Reagan’s stature will grow with each passing year while history places the events of his presidency in the bright light of critical examination. I trust in the final verdict. Personally, I despised Reagan while he was president. It matters little, but that is something that fills me with shame – that I was too stupid and gullible to fully understand the very times I had the fortune to witness first hand. I was a raging leftist, growing up on a steady diet of the mainstream media, wondering why America was supposed to be ‘great’ when we were so obviously flawed and corrupt. I wondered how we had the audacity to impose our way of life on other cultures, and how, after Viet Nam, we could ever have the hubris to think our military was strong enough to stand against another armed power like the Soviet Union. The Cold War was a misunderstanding, made worse by us and our pigheaded insistence that capitalism was so much better than communism. In my mind, they were morally equivalent, and one was just as good as the other. The gas lines of the 70s, and the interest rates and malaise were further indications that indeed our best days were behind us, and the best we could hope for was stasis. What does it say when an eleven year old views the world this way? I don’t recall my parent’s being very political back then. It came from what I saw on TV, and what I read at school. It came from a general sense of our culture. For people our age, it is easy to forget how bad things were, since we were so young at the time. Those slightly older have a clearer memory, and that clarity enhances the impact Reagan had when he assumed office. He strode onto the stage, full of optimism and hope for a nation that had neither. The elites hated him because he was obviously too stupid to understand the truth of where America was headed – who could be so hopeful in the face of such facts? Through his presidency, he picked us up, dusted us off, and when we asked him where he found such reservoirs of optimism, he held up a mirror to our disbelieving faces. Despite my hatred for him, a growing sense of respect had taken root in me, and when I felt that warm glow after one of his speeches; I chastised myself for ‘falling’ for his stagecraft. It took me many years to get my thinking straight, long after he had left office. The biggest moment in the Reagan presidency, for me, was the Summit at Reykjavik. The Soviets handed us a bold proposal – a 50% reduction in warheads and the elimination of an entire class of nuclear missiles (intermediate range in Europe). Imagine that. It was a tremendous step toward disarmament, and any president would be pleased to take such an agreement home and present it to the congress. Yet Reagan refused to give up SDI as a precondition. He refused to place SDI on the block, knowing that he could not morally defend abandoning a defense program that might one day offer a better form of protection to the American people. World reaction was uniformly negative. urlLink Quote - The press reported the Reykjavik "summit" as a failure. One U.S. congressman complained that Reagan had squandered "a chance to cash in 'Star Wars' for the best deal the Russians have offered us since they sold us Alaska." Others criticized Reagan for coming too close to an agreement with Gorbachev. "For a generation the security of the Western World has rested on nuclear deterrence," said James Schlesinger. "The American position at Reykjavik seems to have reflected no understanding of these simple fundamentals." Henry Kissinger warned that notions like the Zero Option undermined "the cohesion of the Western alliance." Indeed, America's NATO allies were mortified; they depended on a Western nuclear threat to defend Europe from the possibility of invasion by conventional Soviet forces. In later years, Gorbachev said it was the beginning of the end for the Soviet Union. The cynics, secure in their worldview that all that has happened was ‘inevitable’, easily dismiss his accomplishments as president. I think that is further testament to his greatness.

This will be the last time I'll point out things like this with regards to the passing of Reagan. It is sufficient to be aware of scum like this, and maybe take a moment to sadly shake my head in pity over the state of their soul. As for my thoughts on Reagan, I'll have some things to say, but not at the moment. I just don't have the time to properly lay out what I've been thinking about over the past few days. Tomorrow for sure...

 Calgary 3 Tampa Bay 2 You non-hockey people are about to get a break, because at most there are only two games left in the NHL season. I'm thinking it's going to be over on Saturday in Calgary. After all, how long can the Lightning play .500 hockey? They've been getting away with that for too long. Great game last night. Iginla is simply amazing. I am seriously getting flashes of Gretzky from him - not to say he will BE a Gretzky, but the way he can hold the puck in traffic reminds me of Wayne. Several times he just appeared in the right place at the right time, or held the puck long beyond the point where any normal person should maintain possession. That translates into scoring chances. Great hockey in the finals. No one is really screwing up, and both teams are working hard for goals. Too bad no one really cares, as they are all waiting in breathless anticipation for the start of the NBA finals. Bah!

 If Bush falls in the forest, and no one's around, can we still hear his lies? "By far the vast majority of my tax cuts go to the bottom end of the spectrum." -G.W. Bush. 02/15/2000, at a debate in South Carolina, et. al. Truth: 64.4% went to the top 5 percent of taxpayers. 7.7% to the bottom 80 percent. urlLink Source Now, Mike: Is it insufficient to say "Bush lied!" on this one? I think to proove that this is a lie would simply be restating what was above. To cover my bases, though, I'll try to proove there's a lie here before questions arrive: Here's Bush's quote again: "By far the vast majority of my tax cuts go to the bottom end of the spectrum." Now, let's look at the facts: Fact 1: The top 5 percent of American taxpayers are not on the bottom end of the spectrum. Fact 2: The majority of Bush's tax cuts went to the top five percent of American taxpayers. I suppose if you interpret "the bottom end of the spectrum" as "those earning less than the top 1%," then you might have something. Besides a mathematical intellect of Arthur Anderson bookkeepers, that is. The economy is improving, eh?

 urlLink My Way News Some of the most amazing quotes from John Kerry here. Tell me he doesn't try to have it both ways? Stepping gingerly into another social issue, Kerry reiterated that he believes that life begins at conception - and that a woman has the right to choose whether to abort. So conception means life, but killing it is just fine with Kerry. And before anyone pops a cork here, I happen to be an Atheist, and I don't really have any strong feelings about abortion. But I think Kerry should at least be consistent here! You can't have it both ways. Wait, he tries to offer a further explanation. "I don't believe personally that it's the government's job to step in and take my article of faith and transfer it to somebody who doesn't share that article of faith," said Kerry, a Roman Catholic. I wonder...is 'Thou Shall Not Murder' transferable? If life begins at conception, John, then what is an abortion? Or is infanticide just fine with you? But then we get into viability. Asked whether he believes abortion is taking a life, Kerry said a fetus is a "form of life." "The Bible itself - I mean, everything talks about different layers of development. That's what Roe v Wade does. It talks about viability. It's the law of the land." The Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v Wade ruling legalized abortion in America. So if it is simply a measure of viability, then can you give me a moral argument against euthanasia of the elderly? Removal of life support against the will of the patient? Severely handicapped? How about 'aborting' a two year old by just withholding food? Where's the line? And while we are on the subject of killing, where's Kerry on the Death Penalty? Kerry has long been an opponent of the death penalty, but in recent years has made an exception for terrorism. The former prosecutor said crimes like rape and child murder do not warrant the highest punishment. "It's certainly terrorizing to the person who's undergoing it. I understand that," Kerry said. "But terrorism is a political act to terrorize a nation, to try to challenge a way of life and a standard.. It's just a different act." Ah, so killing a child isn't as bad as 'challenging a way of life'.

 urlLink NDOL: Michael Moore's Truth Problem by Peter Ross Range Well well. This is interesting. A group called the New Democratic Leadership Council has a review of Dude, Where's My Country and it isn't too flattering. And there you have the essential Moore -- a worldview of America as a failed project and an abiding danger to the planet. No wonder they so love Moore abroad: His is a 1960s vision, hardened in the pre-NAFTA plant closings of the 1980s, of a nation hijacked by the suits, the very guys who for decades gave Moore's father a good job at General Motors. It's from this posture that all the Moorean invective flows. And who is the New Democratic Leadership Council. In keeping with our party's grand tradition, we reaffirm Jefferson's belief in individual liberty and capacity for self-government. We endorse Jackson's credo of equal opportunity for all, special privileges for none. We embrace Roosevelt's thirst for innovation and Kennedy's summons to civic duty. And we intend to carry on Clinton's insistence upon new means to achieve progressive ideals. We believe that the promise of America is equal opportunity for all and special privilege for none. We believe that economic growth generated in the private sector is the prerequisite for opportunity, and that government's role is to promote growth and to equip Americans with the tools they need to prosper in the New Economy. I'm confused...

 Mike says: "Prove he said there were no weapons in Iraq." "David Kay has found the capacity to produce weapons. And when David Kay goes in and says we haven't found stockpiles yet, and there's theories as to where the weapons went. They could have been destroyed during the war. Saddam and his henchmen could have destroyed them as we entered into Iraq. They could be hidden. They could have been transported to another country, and we'll find out." -G.W. Bush, Meet the Press, 2/7/04 So I guess I mispoke. I said that Bush admitted there were no weapons in Iraq. I should have said he admitted that he has failed to find any weapons in Iraq. Too bad you don't probe him for proof the way you do me . Mike says: "The truth is we can't really say for certain." While I think it's safe to safe to say that we're never going to find such weapons, let's look at it your way. We really can't say for certain, huh? OK, fine, we can't. However... "We found the weapons of mass destruction. We found biological laboratories...for those who say we haven't found the banned manufacturing devices or banned weapons, they're wrong, we found them." -G.W. Bush, at an interview in Poland, 5/29/03 Just because we can't say for certain doesn't mean Bush won't say for certain. Mike says: "The evidence that he had them, was planning on getting them, and used them is in the CIA report above." Well, he certainly acted on that report, didn't he? I mean, wow! He acted the hell out on it! Way to take action, Bush! Too bad he didn't do the same with urlLink this daily briefing from August 6, 2001. Mike says: "Where is your evidence? This isn't a matter of logic or ideas but of simple hard facts." Here's a hard fact: Saddam didn't plan the September 11 attack on the Twin Towers. Osama bin Laden did. And what does Bush have to say about Osama bin Laden? "I don't know where he is.You know, I just don't spend that much time on him... I truly am not that concerned about him." -G.W. Bush, at a press conference, 3/13/02 Mike says: "Bush lied!" is insufficient. He told false information to the American people, built upon our fears, and lead us into a war based on this fear he instilled. "Relaying false information that he was told was true." That's what some call it it; others call it a lie. Bill O'Reilly and Michael Moore had this very interpretation battle not long ago. I understand that you aren't particularly fond of Michael Moore. Do you really want to reinact this discussion he had? AT LEAST NO ONE DIED WHEN CLINTON LIED

 Mike asked: "Why can't we all agree on the Facts? [...] Facts like the improving economy." Oh, you can't honestly believe that! Since Bush took office we've lost 1.8 million private sector jobs. Even since the end of the recession – and even over the last 12 months – job growth has been the weakest we have seen since the 1930s. Every month, approximately 150,000 more people enter the workforce. Bush has created more than 150,000 jobs only FOUR of the past 41 months . Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Economy.com and others have all found that between 66%-90% of new jobs are being created in low-end industries and occupations (lower wage jobs), and that the growth in temporary jobs continues to outpace full-time hiring. Our economy has 7 million fewer jobs than Bush's own Council of Economic Advisors projected it would have by now. This year, more of the unemployed have been out of work for more than six months than in any year since 1983. There are over 4.5 million workers that are working part-time, getting no benefits, because they can’t find full-time work (1.3 million more than when Bush took office). Real weekly wages of average workers have actually fallen since the end of the recession.

 Just a few things to close the week here. First, I really do want to say again 'Welcome' to Danny. Despite how it might sound, I really am enjoying him here. I hope he is too, and I promise to have a little more patience with his replies. I guess I want to get in to too many things all at once. Take your time Danny. You should also know that I've received about a half dozen emails from people saying how much they like Danny being involved here. He seems to be a hit even when most people go on to say he sounds like a complete nutcase. I think that's meant as a compliment on some level. Just thought you should know you are drawing a few fans out there. So have a good weekend. Blogging will be light until Monday, but I will take the time to read anything that gets posted. Also, if Danny has any creative writing (non-political), I'd be interested in reading it and offering comments. Email me whenever. Later...

 A few probing questions for our&nbsp;newest resident Leftist: &nbsp; 1. Is a market economy, free of government control and manipulation but subject to reasonable regulation, a good thing? By reasonable I mean preventing harmful or misleading products from being sold. Or is it better to have active government intervention, such as farm subsidies, tariffs, the Federal Communications Commission, etc? &nbsp; 2. Do you favor a graduated or flat system of income taxation? Not that salex tax is an example of a flat tax that makes no distinction between rich or poor but has the rich paying more due to higher prices of goods and services. &nbsp; 3. Does the United States have a right to act unilaterally to ensure the safety of its citizens? Also, do we have a moral obligation to make the world&nbsp;a generally safer and more free place? &nbsp; 4. Why is President Bush so evil and loathsome to the Left? I can honestly see no rational reason for it, as he has implemented policies far mroe liberal than Bill Clinton was allowed to. A medicare perscription drug bill, letting Teddy Kennedy write the Education bill, No Child Left Behind, etc.&nbsp;These seem to be cornerstones of a socialist policy that the Left favors. Why isn't Bush then likable or at least tolerated? Is it merely some sort of projection - a need to blame someone for the things you don't like? &nbsp; 5. Why can't we all agree on the Facts? I refer to Facts such as Saddam's use of andpossession of WMDs and his refusal to comply with UN sanctions. Facts such as Kerry's reversal of stated positions. Facts like the improving economy. These facts are real, yet they are denied or ignored by the Left. Why? &nbsp; 6. Do you claim to understand the meaning of the National Debt and its uses? It is not simply a "Debit" column in the national ledger. It is not soem large amount of money that must actually be paid back some day. It is the obligations and securities of the Federal Government. It is simply the cost of running the Government expressed as a simple number. It cannot ever be "called in" like a home mortgage. To draw an anaolgy, Donald Trump made his fortune primarily in real estate investing. He took out gigantic lons in the hundreds of millions of dollars. He did so in the knowledge that he was&nbsp;not going to pay them back under the initial terms. So when he could not pay, the lenders were forced to give him mroe favorable terms because the sheer amount of the loan was so massive that if Trump defaulted the lenders would go bankrupt themselves. A similar situation exists in the world today. The US Dollar is so ubiquitous and necessary that to allow it to become devalued substantially (by refusing to honor the credit of the US) would collapse the global economy. &nbsp; Sorry about that tangential discussion. To put it simply, I want you to tell me why the National Debt is some sort of issue, along with the Deficit. 7.&nbsp;Why should taxpayers fund PBS/NPR? What&nbsp;clause or amendment mandates or even excuses&nbsp;raising taxrs to pay for&nbsp;some media broadcast? &nbsp; I think thats enough for now. Sorry to do a pseudo double-post with Todd's Litany of Questions. &nbsp; I make no attempt to be fair, objective, or open to your ideas. I believe you are fundamentally wrong on almsot every issue, given your previous posts. I seek to convert you, not to form some sort of consensus or compromise. This is my opening salvo. We should use current events to illustrate and discuss fundamental concepts. I don't care to discuss Michael Moore's latest stunt or Kerry's latest gaffe. Because those don't really matter. We can discuss issues such as the cost of medicine, the War on Terror, and other issues of the day but I will always try to steer it towards some basic concept. &nbsp; I want you to answer both Todd's and my questions with reason and in some depth. I may be wrong, but I wager you have never truly pondered the ideas behind your stands on issues. &nbsp; Don't dissapoint me and refuse to take up my challenge.

 This again proves my political ignorance, but what exactly are these (party) National Conventions for? How does the election process work from this point on? Why do they cost so much money, and who pays for them?! Point me to a link, if yer fingers are too tired....

 I would like to hear, from both sides in 100 words or less, how 'Clinton' created a budget surples in some 8 years, after the nation has been in the red for, I suspect, nearly 200 years. First of all, is that last assumption true? When I say 'Clinton', I mean Bill himself, the Clinton administration, and/or federal leadership at the time.

 Now that we have an intelligent Leftist on board (and I'm genuine about that...I think Danny is a smart, articulate guy even if I have just met him), I'd like to ask some questions. Many times, it is difficult to understand exactly what the Left believes and why. We get bogged down in the details without really addressing the Big Picture. So I'd lile to ask some fundamental questions and get Danny's perspective, and then maybe we can get to some real debate about political philosophy. So if you could take a few minutes and answer the following, I think we would appreciate it. 1). Do you believe health care is a fundamental right? How would you address the cost of drugs or medical care? 2). Do you believe in hate crimes legislation, and why? 3). Do you believe in the free market? How much regulation is required? 4). What is more important - that we live for ourselves or that we live for others? 5). What is your position on the tenth amendment and what it says about 90% of all Federal regulation? That should give us a good start to have a real discussion about philosophy, rather than sounding like a poor version of Hannity and Colmes.

 urlLink GeorgeWBush.com :: Kerry on Iraq it's the cold hard facts on the flip-flop artist.

 A Numbers Game! With Clinton in office: For fiscal year 1999, the federal budget surplus was $122.7 billion. urlLink Proof With Bush in office: For fiscal year 2004, the annual federal budget deficit is $639 billion, [...] a near-record level for the post-World War II era. urlLink Proof According to the U.S. National Debt Clock, right now, Outstanding Public Debt is $7,295,929,465,739.86. Still, that number is not quite accurate because, in the time it took me to type this large number, the Deficit has already grown. It's impossible to keep up with. For the current amount, please visit the U.S. National Debt Clock at http://www.brillig.com/debt_clock/ .

 First off, I'm glad Danny came on board, because I'm going to enjoy this, in a Ken Jennings way. I am a little disappointed that Danny chose to post essentially what is a Michael Moore screed from Stupid White Men. If you look point for point, it bears a striking semblance to urlLink this . But Danny did say he was posting 'talking points', so it isn't like he was passing off some other work as his own. In the future, I'm looking forward to hearing HIS views, especially when we start to dissect them on the cold table of logic. Just to re-iterate for Danny's benefit - I haven't been too happy with Bush. I'm more of a conservative than a Republican, and if it wasn't for the War on Terror (WOT in this forum), I'd be sitting out this election. Bush hasn't earned my vote on the domestic side, even though the tax cuts were a big help. Bush isn't my horse, and aside from WOT, I wouldn't be all that upset to see him lose. But the WOT is real, so I'll do what I can to get him re-elected (or elected for the first time if you prefer...sigh). Let's stipulate for a moment about the criminal charges made here. Let me grant you in theory that all of this is true and ask you a follow up question. Why does it matter to Danny? I'm not saying it is not relevant...I just want to know specifically why it might anger you. I want to know what you think about it, and why. You might certainly question the man's judgment for covering up a checkered past, but I find it amusing that you defend Gore for the pot admission, when I very much doubt there was a problem with "I didn't inhale". Truth be told, that didn't really bother me about Clinton, beyond it being a laughable excuse. I'd just like to know where you are coming from on this issue. Then I'll be glad to discuss specifics. Now for the funding cuts. I'm reading your list of 'cuts' and I'm getting excited. Oh how I wish they went even deeper. But for the sake of argument, let's take one at random and run it through the Google Machine. "Cut $700 million dollars in funds for public housing repairs." Well, according to the urlLink Council of Large Public Housing Authorities , it's even 'worse' then you say. Eight and a half months after President Bush released his Federal budget blueprint, which proposed cutting the Public Housing Capital Fund by $800 million and eliminating the $310 million Public Housing Drug Elimination Grant program, Congress finally passed a HUD budget that will result in a funding reduction for all public housing of approximately 3% from last years' amounts. On November 6, the VA-HUD Conference Committee agreed to the Conference Report on the FY 2002 VA-HUD Appropriations. The House overwhelmingly passed the bill, 401-18, on Thursday, November 8, 2001. That same day, the Senate passed the measure, 87-7. Wow, so it was $800 million, and it passed the House and Senate by a nail biting 383 and 80 votes respectfully. Damn Republicans! But then we read on... While the bill is an improvement over the original HUD request for public housing, it still leaves agencies and their residents woefully shortchanged. The Conference Committee rejected the President's proposed dramatic cuts to the Public Housing Capital Fund and appropriated $550 million more than the President requested, however, the result is a $ 150 million reduction over last years' level. So looks like they got a big chunk of the money back later. Too bad. So the real problem isn't that Bush tried to cut the budget...it's that he FAILED to cut the budget. I'm upset with him over that. I want REAL cuts in all of these programs. But I still think it is unfair to criticize Bush for cuts that never happened, or at least do the research to see how the Congress voted on each proposed cut. As I'm sure you know, Congress spends the money...the President just suggests how to spend it. Try it out. Pick a random 'cut' and start looking into it. It's like a party game. Take a drink when you find hypocrisy. Philosophically though, I'd like Danny to explain how any of these programs are legally the mandate of the Federal Government. Where does the government draw the authority to spend money on advanced pediatric training for doctors? Or why does the Government feel it has the mandate to fund libraries (some day we will talk about libraries in great detail, and many will rue the day). This cuts at the heart of political philosophy, and I'd like to hear the new guy's perspective on why the government should fund these things. And lets talk about glorious Kyoto. According to this urlLink CBS News story... It will be the first such vote since the Senate voted 95-0 in 1997 to reject many of the principles behind an international climate treaty negotiated in Kyoto, Japan. The treaty was signed later that year by then-Vice President Al Gore but the Senate never ratified it. So Clinton's failure to get the Senate to ratify a treaty (95-0...damn Republicans), becomes Bush's failure to implement the provisions? Actually, even if the vote was 50-50 with Dick Cheney casting the tie breaker while rubbing a bust of Machiavelli, I would still be pleased that this thing was killed. But shove that aside for a moment and let's talk about the specifics of Kyoto. Kyoto is not the ultimate solution to CO2 emissions. There are other ways of doing it, and most of them are market driven. The major flaw in Kyoto is the exemptions offered to developing countries, which routinely employ less efficient technologies for energy production, resulting in a high per capita emission. By exemption developing countries for the foreseeable future, Kyoto ignores what will be a massive contribution to the CO2 levels over the coming decades. The economic costs imposed upon the developed world, such as the US, is not an acceptable solution in light of these exemptions. If a true environmentalist wants to see a reduction in gas, he should support the development of nuclear power, but somehow I don't think that's going to fly. In the mean time, signing on to a treaty of dubious value, and accepting the resulting economic impact, isn't a sane thing to do. There are other ways, Take a look at this urlLink DOE study on carbon emission in the US. The graph is particularly interesting. As discussed below, factors such as a drop in carbon intensity in the electric power sector kept emissions growth in 2002 to less than the average annual growth rate since 1990... Between 1990 and 2002, U.S. economic growth averaged 2.9 percent per year. Energy-related carbon dioxide emissions, however, grew by an average of 1.2 percent annually. We are getting more efficient at power production, and we are doing it without Kyoto. Imagine that....Go on, read the whole report and let's dissect it. Finally, I have to go back to a urlLink Michael Moore criticism that struck me as amusing. Pushed for development of "mini-nukes," designed to attack deeply buried targets-a violation of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Well, if you go look at the urlLink Treaty web site and do some poking around, you'll find the following - (And I can't link directly to it because it is some sort of Java thing. You can find it on your own, it's easy.) State Information United States of America Annex 2 State* Yes Signature Date 24-SEP-1996 Ratification Date Not Ratified Hmmm....we should honor a treaty that isn't ratified? Between the Test Ban and Kyoto, it seems Bush's biggest crime is honoring the Congressional power to ratify treaties. Damn Bush for following the Constitution. See, the urlLink Senate voted down the treaty in 1999, by a 51-49 vote (okay, now you can say Damn Republicans). So it has no force of law. Why should we restrict ourselves to something that has no legal standing? Oh yeah, it's kind of like the 'unilateral' argument with the UN, isn't it? So, in the words of a great man...Bring it on!

 Hey, everyone! Full-blooded Lefty here to defend his fellow liberals. I'll apologize in advance if I happen to say something that has already been covered in this blog. While I've read several postings, it's very likely that I may unintentionally repeat something. After all, I haven't been here as long as the rest of you. For now, I'll hold off on my comments regarding Iraq, just because I'm pretty confident that that topic has been brought up a lot already. For my first contribution, here are a few talking points regarding our President. (Note: It is not out of sloth that I don't bother to spell out his full title, "President-elect." I just call 'em as I see 'em.) *When asked in 1999 about his alleged cocaine use, he responded that he has had "no felonies in the last 25 years." What do you suppose that tells you about his life prior to 1975? *He's been arrested three times, including a time in 1976 when he was found DUI. I'm not saying that something that happened twenty-four years before his campaign for President should keep him from running for office. I just wonder why he and everyone involved in his campaign lied about it and covered up the truth for so long. Al Gore was man enough to admit that he had smoked pot as a teenager, and he still managed to get 500,000 more individual votes than Bush. *Later on, when people found out why he really was arrested in 1976 (drunk driving, not "driving too slow" like he proclaimed), he responded "It was back in my youth." His youth? He was 30! As for stuff that happened after within the first few months after he took office: *"It's amazing I won. I was running againnst peace, prosperit, and incumbency." -George W. Bush, July 14, 2001. Speaking to Swedish Prime Minister Goran Perrson, unaware that a live TV camera was still rolling. All kinds of funding cuts: *Cut $35 million in funding for advanced pediatric training for doctors. *Cut $39 million from federal spending on libraries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fun side-note: He actually proposed eliminating the "Reading is Fundamental" program, which gives free books to poor children. *Cut funding for research into cleaner, more efficient cars and trucks by 28%. *Reduced, by 86%, the Community Access Program, which coordinated care for people without health insurance among hospitals, clinics, and other health care providers. *Cut funding for the Girls and Boys Clubs of America programs in public housing by $60 million. *Cut $200 million from workforce training programs for dislocated workers. *Cut $200 million from the Childcare and Development grant, a program that provides child care to low-income families as they are forced from welfare to work. *Cut $700 million dollars in funds for public housing repairs. *Cut $500 million from the Environmental Protection Agency's budget. *Cut $15.7 million from programs dealing with child abuse and neglect. Among his broken campaign promises: *He did not invest $100 million per year in rain forest conservation *He has not regulated carbon dioxide emissions, a major contributor to global warming. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fun side-note: He actually pulled America out of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol agreement on global warming, ultimately signed by 178 other countries Ooh, and here's a goody: He denied college financial aid to students convicted of misdemeanor drug charges, though convicted murderers are still eligible. Yes, all of that happened just within the first few months of his administration, but he still managed to spend 42% of his first seven months on vacation. Any rebuttles?

 urlLink Captain's Quarters : From Captain's Quarters. "As if that weren't bad enough, former Denver mayor Wellington Webb then introduced singer Wyclef Jean to sing a song as a companion piece. Now, I haven't paid a lot of attention to the sideshow acts at the convention, but this one was just appalling. Who sings about being assassinated by Americans if they got elected at a nominating convention? Howard Dean's favorite singer, that's who. Wyclef Jean broke some sort of record by squeezing in as many tired political cliches as possible in a four-minute song. Try these insipid lyrics on for size:" You'll have to go there to see the lyrics. Oh, okay...how about a sample....

 urlLink Redistribution Is Theft No Matter Who Does It Terry sent me this tonight, and I think you've heard a similar argument from me in the past. I still don't think Steve buys into it though... "Regardless of the purpose, such behavior is immoral. It's a reduced form of slavery. After all, what is the essence of slavery? It's the forceful use of one person to serve the purposes of another person. When Congress, through the tax code, takes the earnings of one person and turns around to give them to another person in the forms of prescription drugs, Social Security, food stamps, farm subsidies or airline bailouts, it is forcibly using one person to serve the purposes of another. " Hard to argue with the premise.

 urlLink The Official Homepage of All Things Danny - dannycrowle.com Last night I met this guy at the writer's group.&nbsp; He had some entertaining pieces, and when I went to his site, I noted the John Kerry banners.&nbsp; Earlier today I sent him an explanation of the Blog and an invitation to jump in and give us the other side of the aisle's perspective on things.&nbsp; Maybe he'll make Eric happy... Anyway, Danny, if you are interested, jump on in!

 &nbsp; urlLink Teresa Kerry’s Remarks So I’m checking out the sites this morning and I run across an excerpt of Te-RAY-sa’s remarks to the DNC last night.&nbsp; I didn’t see her speak, but I did tune in just in time to see Fox News talking about it, and the collective attitude, even with the token Leftists, was – “What in the world just happened?”&nbsp; Chris Matthews said he half expected her to break out in “Don’t cry for me, Argentina” at the end of her speech.&nbsp; Funny stuff. So I find her remarks on Drudge, and I can’t resist a little urlLink fisking .&nbsp; I know, she’s just a candidate’s wife, but it still is kind of amusing. John believes in a bright future.He believes he can, and will, invent the technologies, new materials and conservation methods of the future. He believes that alternative fuels will guarantee that not only will no American boy or girl go to war because of our dependency on foreign oil. But also that our economic security will forever become independent of this need. We can, and we will, create good, competitive, and sustainable jobs while still protecting the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the health of our children, because good environmental policy is good economics. John, personally, will invent new technologies?&nbsp; I know he is smart, but sheesh.&nbsp; But I guess it fits the template of the Left…ALL that is good springs from the government.&nbsp; But after seeing Kerry in the NASA bunny suit, I wonder if it is a good idea to point out his nerdy uber-competence with science.&nbsp; You know, if Kerry can invent the technologies, maybe he should be spending his time in a lab and leave the presidency to someone with fewer distractions.&nbsp; For the good of the nation, I call upon Kerry to turn his awesome intellect to the problem of conservation.&nbsp; He would be of better service there. &nbsp;Isn't it time we began working to give parents more opportunity to be with their children and to afford to have a family life? Let me rephrase that – “Isn’t it time we work harder so parents can work less?”&nbsp; Hmmmmm…&nbsp; I, too, look forward to the day when people without families sacrifice so I may stay home and spend time with my family.&nbsp; It is for the good of the nation, and no call to service can be nobler.&nbsp; Mike and Eric, I expect a stronger effort from you two in the future.&nbsp; John is a fighter. He earned his medals the old-fashioned way, by putting his life on the line for his country. No one will defend this nation more vigorously than he will-and he will always be first in the line of fire. Always first in the line of fire?&nbsp; Really?&nbsp; Has he cleared that with the Secret Service?&nbsp; Do we really want the man who can single handedly solve conservation problems in a position of danger?&nbsp; Wouldn’t it be better to let the Marines do what Marines have always done?&nbsp; Maybe we can get Kerry in a Dukakis helmet on an M-1, but after he takes off the NASA bunny suit. The truth we must speak now is that America has responsibilities that it is time for us to accept again. With John Kerry as President, global climate change and other threats to the health of our planet will begin to be reversed. So while we are off confronting the biggest threat to western civilization, she thinks it is time for us to accept our responsibilities once again.&nbsp; Namely, the larger threats of climate change that Kerry is going to solve for us in his spare time.&nbsp; Hmm…&nbsp; Raving Islamofascist…greenhouse gas….yeah, I’m having trouble with that sense of perspective as well.&nbsp;

 ***Vanity Post Warning*** I'm trying out a new writing group here in town&nbsp;tonight, and I decided to take this piece in to submit.&nbsp; I read it a couple of times today, and am still quite pleased with it although it is three years old now.&nbsp; I thought 'what's the use of having a blog if you don't inflict your writing on others?', so I thought I'd try to post it with the new Blogger system and see how it handled the format.&nbsp; Turns out it isn't too bad, so here it is.&nbsp; If you aren't interested, scroll right by and ignore it, and rest assured I won't do this too often.&nbsp; &nbsp; Allgemeine Kosten &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rats celebrate the carnage.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I rest for a moment, with my back pressed against the rough plaster wall, watching the rats as they chew on the blasted remains of the man who died here last night.&nbsp; He was Russian, so I leave the rats to their feast.&nbsp; Before long, it will be my turn, so I watch them with interest as they take small bites, licking their tiny lips and cleaning their little claws. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dead man’s face gazes upon me, eyeless and empty.&nbsp; What do you leave behind, I wonder? &nbsp;Is there a family to mourn you?&nbsp; Will anyone remember what you did here?&nbsp; If we survive this city, we will write the history, and you will be forgotten. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My breath escapes in ragged plumes.&nbsp; The cold air cuts through my thin uniform.&nbsp; The light cloth was never intended to shelter us from the depths of a Russian winter, but like most of my fellow soldiers of the Reich, I endure.&nbsp; I shiver to keep my muscles warm; marshaling what little strength I have remaining. I can hear the Russians in the next room, waiting across the hallway.&nbsp; I count three men by their voices.&nbsp; In the vastness of the Russian countryside, the front line has degenerated to the hallway separating these two rooms.&nbsp; We’ve been here for a few hours, waiting on relief, waiting on a mistake.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Waiting to die. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The expected grenade through the doorframe never comes.&nbsp; The Russians have their own problems with proper supplies.&nbsp; While the Luftwaffe commands the skies, the suicidal supply convoys continue to cross the Volga, losing far more than they put ashore.&nbsp; What meager supplies that make it through are insufficient to equip the defenders of the city, but somehow they manage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other side of the hall, the Russians stir.&nbsp; I can hear a new man there now.&nbsp; He has the voice of authority.&nbsp; I thumb the safety on my gun and shift behind an overturned metal file cabinet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A burst of fire punctures the thin plaster walls, spraying the room with small powdery flakes.&nbsp; I duck behind the cabinet, waiting on the hail of gunfire to stop as I aim my weapon at the open doorway.&nbsp; The first man charges through the door, empty-handed.&nbsp; His task is to force me to expend ammunition, depleting my meager supplies.&nbsp; Such is the determination of our enemy.&nbsp; In his face, I read the all too familiar resignation I have seen in so many.&nbsp; He glances around, taking in the room in which he will die.&nbsp; His eyes close as my gun cuts him down. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A second man leaps over the body of the first, knowing where I am from the sound of my gun.&nbsp; He stumbles on a loose brick and snarls at me with contempt.&nbsp; He, too, goes down before my gun.&nbsp; A third man hurdles the bodies of the first two, screaming in terror as he fires his rifle.&nbsp; The bullets bite into the file cabinet and small metal slivers strike my face.&nbsp; I fire my final burst, and my gun is empty.&nbsp; He staggers forward despite the wounds.&nbsp; I club him down with the butt of the gun, smashing his face twice before looking up. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fourth man is on me with a knife.&nbsp; I block his thrust with my gun, and the shoulder strap tangles on the blade, tearing it from my hands.&nbsp; I back away, grabbing my own entrenching shovel.&nbsp; We circle each other, stumbling on the blasted rubble covering the small floor.&nbsp; The room is filled with our heavy breathing as we grapple, dancing around each other, feinting and attacking.&nbsp; I look into his eyes and see nothing but the blank, feral stare of determination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He lunges again and I throw the shovel, hitting him in the face.&nbsp; He stumbles back, falling down and losing the knife.&nbsp; I land on top of him, pinning his arms while my hand closes on a brick.&nbsp; As I bring it down on his face, he goes limp.&nbsp; I strike again and again, feeling the bones splinter and break, seeing the blood well up from the wounds.&nbsp; I watch from a distance as I strike over and over again, long after the Russian is dead.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is some time before I realize I have survived.&nbsp; I sit back and wipe my bloody hands on the vest of one of the Russians.&nbsp; It is only then that I feel the disappointment. Stalingrad is not finished with me yet. ******** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The war was a glorious thing to me once.&nbsp; I embraced the excitement and glory, drunk with the speed of our conquest.&nbsp; We made such rapid progress in those first few months, it seemed nothing could stop us from taking Moscow and the rich oil fields of the Ukraine.&nbsp; The greatest effort in those early days was the simple act of walking.&nbsp; We struggled to keep up with the Panzers as they blasted great lanes through the crumbling Red Army.&nbsp; Even the villagers greeted us as saviors at first, happy to be free of the lash of communism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was before the Totenkopf SS began to sterilize the countryside. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, they strap grenades to their children and send them to our camps.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are within sight of the Volga, here in Stalingrad.&nbsp; For months, we have fought house-to-house, room-to-room.&nbsp; The Russians, so deserving of our contempt in the early days, now fight like some great cast iron beast, unfeeling of pain, unmindful of death.&nbsp; All around us, the city is a flaming ruin, rubble piled upon rubble, streets covered with bodies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The battle never pauses.&nbsp; They ordeal never ends.&nbsp; There are only more buildings, more rooms, and more death.&nbsp; Many good men have died here.&nbsp; Men with whom I had crossed the steppes, driving the Russians before us.&nbsp; Men whom I would call brothers.&nbsp; We died for each other, holding to the hope that some of us would see our families again one day.&nbsp; Our deaths bought the lives of our friends and brothers, and for them we embraced our fate.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, there are new men around.&nbsp; Men I will attach myself to out of necessity, never taking the time to know their names.&nbsp; It doesn’t matter.&nbsp; The young recruits were the hardest.&nbsp; They were new to this war, transported in on rail from the Reich, not understanding what this war has become.&nbsp; Those new men insisted on talking.&nbsp; They wanted the comfort of companionship and the safety of friends.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The veterans knew this safety was an illusion, but we didn’t speak of it.&nbsp; These new men died hard, screaming for their mothers or wives, shouting out at the rude betrayal of fate.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those that had come to know the truth of Stalingrad died with relief. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I no longer think about living.&nbsp; My mind is occupied with dying.&nbsp; The months grind on, obliterating our memories of home, and erasing our hopes for life.&nbsp; One night, after the last of my friends died, I burned all of my personal items.&nbsp; I lingered over the photo of Helena and Daniella; my wife and daughter back in Munich, but it went into the fire, along with my hope of survival.&nbsp; I could not bear to be reminded every day of the things that I will loose when I die here.&nbsp; That night, I declared myself dead and accepted my fate. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I no longer remember why I fight, but I continue on.&nbsp; I fight out of joyless habit.&nbsp; I will die from mindless repetition.&nbsp; I know nothing else. ************** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, I am an ammunition bearer.&nbsp; I shoulder my weapon and help the man next to me carry the large steel box.&nbsp; Ahead, three other men wrestle with the heavy mortar.&nbsp; We move down the shattered hallway, heading for the staircase that leads up to the roof of the massive Dzerzhinsky Tractor Factory.&nbsp; We step over the decomposing bodies of both Russian and German, locked together in battle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Down below, thousands of bodies covered the factory work floor, punctuated by the burning hulks of Panzers. &nbsp;We secure the factory by day, only to have the Russians sneak back in at night.&nbsp; They travel through cellars, or they knock holes in the walls and pass through from room to room.&nbsp; An empty room suddenly becomes an enemy gun emplacement, and more men die clearing it out.&nbsp; They are like the tide, and we can’t keep them from finding the cracks in our walls.&nbsp; We kill ten of them for every one of us, and the Russians count that as a good trade.&nbsp; They will drown us in their blood. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We reach the end of the hallway and the mortar team pauses.&nbsp; The lead man opens the stairwell door.&nbsp; The explosion hurls me back and something heavy strikes my head, knocking the helmet away.&nbsp; I collapse on the floor, dazed.&nbsp; In my mouth, I can taste the bitter iron of blood; the taste of this city.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I roll over and look.&nbsp; The three men of the mortar team have been shredded.&nbsp; Parts of bodies are strewn around the narrow hallway and the walls are painted in a fresh coat of blood.&nbsp; The men shielded me from the blast.&nbsp; I run my hands over myself, surprised to find no injury.&nbsp; I recover my helmet, and the bloody smear on its side tells me I was hit by a piece of a man.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I retrieve my gun, checking to be sure that it still functions.&nbsp; The other ammo bearer moans.&nbsp; He has taken shrapnel in the gut.&nbsp; I pull his clothes aside and see the wound is fatal.&nbsp; He will bleed to death before anything can be done for him.&nbsp; I look into his eyes and see the acceptance written there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He manages to reach inside his bloody shirt and pull out his ID tag.&nbsp; He doesn’t have the strength to break the chain, so I do it for him.&nbsp; I tuck the small bit of metal into my pocket without looking at the name.&nbsp; I rise to go when he utters the phrase I was dreading.&nbsp; “Bitte.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I look down at him.&nbsp; I consider carrying him, but the reality of my situation gives me no choice.&nbsp; We both know the only option available to us. He nods as I draw my knife.&nbsp; Bullets are precious, and I have a limited supply.&nbsp; I turn him on his side and place one hand on his forehead to steady him.&nbsp; With a quick thrust to the back of the neck, I relieve him of his pain.&nbsp; I wipe the blade on his shirt and prepare to move on. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I open the steel ammo box and remove two rounds for the shattered mortar.&nbsp; A few more may fit in my pack, but they are bulky and dangerous.&nbsp; I set out with them in my hands, heading back toward the bunker built into one of the massive cold furnaces.&nbsp; There, I will get a new assignment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I round the corner and come face to face with a group of Russians creeping down the hallway. &nbsp;We stare at each other for a moment before I react.&nbsp; I hurl one of the mortar shells at them and jump back around the corner.&nbsp; The shell was not armed, but it served its purpose as I hear them shout and scatter.&nbsp; I pull the arming pin on the other shell and slam it against the wall.&nbsp; I count to three and throw it around the corner.&nbsp; The blast throws me down on the floor and I hear the splintering of timbers and the rumbling of collapsed flooring.&nbsp; The dust is thick in the air as the silence descends. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I look around the corner and see that the hallway is gone.&nbsp; The entire floor has collapsed, and I see the pile of bodies down below.&nbsp; A few still move, crawling over the dead, cradling broken limbs or gaping wounds.&nbsp; I stand on the edge of the hole and chamber a round in my pistol.&nbsp; I select the men who might survive, and begin shooting them in the head.&nbsp; The work is mechanical, and I finish within a minute.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I turn back to find another passage, I block out the cries of the mortally wounded.&nbsp; They will be quiet soon enough. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ******************** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The days blur together.&nbsp; The long battles are interrupted by brief interludes of numb sleep.&nbsp; I wonder if I will notice my own death when it comes.&nbsp; God has forsaken all of us in this shattered city.&nbsp; Our ghosts wander the streets at night, turned away from both heaven and hell by His wrath.&nbsp; Today, I am patrolling streets behind our own lines.&nbsp; When the shots ring out, the adrenaline takes over.&nbsp; I throw myself down against the rubble.&nbsp; Next to me, the flammenwerfer bearer adjusts the tank on his back.&nbsp; The steady flame from the barrel nearly burns me as he rolls over.&nbsp; I cuff him on the shoulder, shoving him away.&nbsp; He mumbles an apology. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I rise up just enough to peer through a gap in the rubble.&nbsp; A dozen meters away, a small wooden shed blocks our way.&nbsp; I can’t see the sniper, but I know he is there.&nbsp; Three dying squad mates lay twitching in the street behind us.&nbsp; I survey the scene and make a decision.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We move around to the back of the shed.&nbsp; I can’t see any cracks or openings on this side.&nbsp; The sniper can’t see us, but we must move quickly before help comes.&nbsp; My squad mate stands up and douses the dry, wooden shed with a long blast from the flammenwerfer.&nbsp; The wood begins to pop and crackle beneath the onslaught of flames.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the shed begins to burn, I move further around the pile of rubble, gaining a vantage from which to see the door of the shed.&nbsp; The sniper will exit right in front of me, and I am ready to cut him down.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The shed burns for a long time.&nbsp; I motion to my partner to move around on the opposite side of the shed, ready to burn the Russian when he comes out.&nbsp; The shed door opens and a flaming man staggers out into the snow.&nbsp; Even as he burns, he fires his gun at my partner.&nbsp; I shoot him in the back, but he continues to fire as he drops to his knees. The flammenwerfer explodes, engulfing my partner in flames.&nbsp; He runs toward me; a flaming torch of a man.&nbsp; His shrieking tears through me as I roll out of his way.&nbsp; I ignore him, firing again and again into the sniper.&nbsp; Finally, the Russian collapses onto the snow and I turn my attention to my partner.&nbsp; He is running in small circles, screaming as the flames consume his clothing.&nbsp; I can see he is doomed, so I do the only thing I can.&nbsp; I empty my entire clip into him.&nbsp; He falls to the ground, but the cries of agony continue.&nbsp; I rip open my vest pocket and search for another clip of ammunition.&nbsp; It takes me several seconds of frantic searching to find it. I step up and hold the muzzle close to his head, making sure to finish him.&nbsp; The heat from the flames singes my hands and face.&nbsp; The thick, black smoke carries the taint of burning flesh, and I fear I will never escape the smell. Once again, I find myself alone with the dead. ******************* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today we began another assault.&nbsp; Our leaders tried to inspire us with words about victory, but their voices wavered and their eyes revealed the truth.&nbsp; We have been cut off here in Stalingrad, and the Russians surround the city.&nbsp; We are to fight on, and with our deaths, buy time for our forces to fall back and fortify the lines for the coming counter attack.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I am alone.&nbsp; I have been separated from my brothers by the fury of Russian artillery.&nbsp; I sprint from crater to crater as the shells rain down from the heavens.&nbsp; The ground beneath me shakes from the explosions, and I hear the jagged metal as it screams over my head.&nbsp; The barrage behind me makes going back impossible.&nbsp; My only hope is to find shelter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were pressing onward to the Barrikady factory; yet another immense building demanding its toll in blood.&nbsp; The assault faltered as the guns on the other side of the Volga opened up upon us.&nbsp; The Luftwaffe cannot find the batteries in the thick fog, so they are free to expend all they have so carefully hoarded through the months of battle here in the city. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I fear they will let us have the factory and then smash it down around us.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I dive into a gully running beside the road and slide down to the bottom on a wave of bloody mud.&nbsp; At the bottom, a cushion of bodies breaks my descent.&nbsp; I lay there for a moment, gazing at the men who died here.&nbsp; Their slack faces reveal little of the agony they endured. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I crawl along the gully, heading back toward the German lines.&nbsp; The artillery hammers the elevated roadway, and seems to be shifting north, away from me.&nbsp; I reach a small stream running beneath the road through a large metal pipe, big enough for two men to walk abreast without stooping.&nbsp; Here is where I can rest a moment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dead are piled deep.&nbsp; Here other men have sought shelter, only to find their deaths.&nbsp; I crouch down next to one of them and lean back against the pipe.&nbsp; For the first time in days, I remove my helmet and scratch my head.&nbsp; My hair is matted and filthy, and I realize that it will never be clean again. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a fit of disgust, I hurl the helmet away.&nbsp; I am sick of this war, and I wish an end to it.&nbsp; The artillery shifts back toward me and before long the pounding shells begin to bracket both ends of the drainpipe.&nbsp; On either side, I see the eruptions of mud and blood and flesh as the shells dig down into the bloody strata of the city.&nbsp; The ground shakes beneath me, and the great pressure-wave of the explosions tear through my ears.&nbsp; I feel myself screaming, but the echoing rage of Russian ordinance drowns me out.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pounding continues for several seconds, then shifts away to the south.&nbsp; I stand and prepare to move out to the north, before the fire returns, when a small bundle of rags move in front of me.&nbsp; In the flashes of exploding shells, I make out the small form of a girl cowering next to a body.&nbsp; She holds a small sack close to her body and stares at me with cold eyes.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For an instant, I see Daniella. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The child starts to back away, and I lean forward.&nbsp; “Ich verletze Sie nicht, mein kleines Mädchen.”&nbsp; She seems to understand me, and hesitates.&nbsp; The explosions recede as the artillery moves farther away, taking this war with it.&nbsp; For a moment, I am just a man trying to comfort a little lost girl.&nbsp; I open my canteen.&nbsp; “Wasser?”&nbsp; I take a sip of the water and hold it out toward her. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She moves forward into the light and I can see her gaunt features.&nbsp; Beneath the tattered rags, she is so tiny.&nbsp; Her mouth is smeared with blood.&nbsp; She looks about ten years old.&nbsp; I open a pocket on my vest and pull out a piece of linen to clean her face.&nbsp; She moves closer to me, and I kneel down, teetering as I try to find my balance.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before I can move, she springs forward, barreling into me and knocking me on my back.&nbsp; As I try to catch myself, I feel a sharp stinging on my cheek.&nbsp; She leaps on my chest and slashes at my face with a Russian bayonet, nearly as big as she is.&nbsp; I try to shove her away, but she is like a rabid dog, shrieking as she slashes again and again.&nbsp; I take a deep cut on my forearm.&nbsp; In the flashing light, I see the blood and grime smeared all over her face.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without thought, my training takes control.&nbsp; I draw my knife and thrust upward through her chest.&nbsp; The blade catches on her ribs, and I shove harder to make sure I reach the heart.&nbsp; I watch her face spasm above me, and her bayonet falls from her hands.&nbsp; I catch her as she slumps and roll over with her body cradled in my arms.&nbsp; What have I done? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I look down at her with tears in my eyes.&nbsp; The hilt of my knife quivers in time with her heartbeat, slowing even as I watch.&nbsp; Her eyelids flutter as her life leaks away.&nbsp; As she dies, I hear her last word barely escape her lips.&nbsp;

 urlLink Activists sue to stop random MBTA bag searches I'm no Constitutional Lawyer, which should be a big relief to Eric, but I don't think this is a good idea on the part of the Civil Rights groups. Two civil rights groups filed a lawsuit in federal court to stop the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority from randomly inspecting passengers' bags, saying it's an unconstitutional violation of personal privacy. It would seem that the search is defined as a term of service, just as you are required to wear a shirt or shoes in a store. You are free not to wear said articles, but then the store is not required to srvice you. If the MTBA hasn't already done so, they need to get this condition printed upon the tickets or posted in a way to be clear to the consumer. Just like airlines require a search as a term of the flight, the transit people can and should do the same. I just don't see a problem here. No one's rights are being violated if the terms of the contract are established up front.

If not for Fox News I would not have known of this. I have also heard that Teresa has made some not so kind remarks about the Kennedy's which are set to be leaked soon, that should be fun. Also, love him or hate him, Clinton's speech was the best political speech I may have ever heard. Outstanding. He could possibly be the best pure "politician" ever.

 A few observations from the weekend. I heard some talking heads on Sunday speculating about the renewed tempo on the abduction of foreigners in Iraq. We aren't seeing any more Americans being kidnapped, and the thinking is that the insurgents are now going after soft targets. They are tired of having their butts handed to them by Marines, so they are going to get the unguarded personel of the weaker nations. This is a good thing, and further evidence that the bad guys are having problems. Also, I don't believe the bad guys have executed a muslim hostage yet. I'd rather not see them execute anyone, but it is interesting that the muslims have been spared. That would actually be in accordance with the Koran.... The History Channel has a new series called urlLink Decisive Battles . The notable thing about this series is the technology being used to illustrate the battles - a computer game. Some years back I discovered what is called the Total War series of computer games, starting with Shogun: Total War. Later, they came out with Mideivel: Total War, and coming soon is Rome: Total War. In the TW series of games, you command a large force of ground troops, appropriate for your era. The game is known for an amazing level of detail, and you can actually watch individual soldiers as they battle in large formations. Hands down, this is my favorite game. Anyway, Rome:Total War is the newest in the series, not yet released, and features a new 3D engine for rendering the battle. The History Channel is using the game engine to illustrate the battles, and what I saw was quite stunning. Screenshots of the game can be found urlLink here . I will actually upgrade my graphics card just to play this game. The Democratic National Convention starts today. Yawn. The only thing I'm curious about is the possibility of terrorism. Hopefully, nothing bad would happen, but I sort of wish we actually catch something in process. Perhaps a foiled attack would wake up the Left to the very real war we are fighting. I doubt it though....it would be part of a Bush plot to Steal The Election. My dad was in town this weekend, and since he is a Democrat, I couldn't wait to discuss Sandy Berger's pants. Unfortunately, he flat out refused to discuss it. I think he's losing interest in politics, since he's pretty much disgusted with his own party. He's turning into a Zell Miller Democrat. I guess that's a good thing, but I do miss the heated discussions. Alas....

"You see, the main story here isn't mostly about whether/why Berger surrepetitiously stole away with classified documents from 9/11 committee chambers. No, it's about whether the Justice Department should have clued in the White House regarding the investigation. The White House declined to say who beyond the counsel's office knew about the investigation, but some administration officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they believed that several top aides to Mr. Bush were informed of the investigation. President Bush himself declined to answer a question Wednesday about whether he had been told, saying: 'I'm not going to comment on this matter. This is a serious matter, and it will be fully investigated by the Justice Department.' Bush, not Berger, is not answering Qs right now! I mean, you couldn't make this stuff up folks. "

 urlLink Michael Moore to be Feted in Boston I don't normally link to Newsmax, but this one is pretty much free of spin.

If so, then what does that make the Congressional Black Caucus, composed of Congressmen and Senators who happen to be black, and all happen to be democrats?

 Maybe I’m wasting my time, but since Mike didn’t respond to Eric’s questions, I feel I should spend a little bit of time on the old Halliburton lie. It probably won’t matter to anyone, but it does to me. I’m linking here to a page on urlLink Moorewatch.com , consisting of a series of pieces from the National Review and the New York Times (gasp) about the Halliburton mythology. We’re talking 5,300 words of journalism, so if you want to continue with this idea that Cheney is darkly manipulating things to get contracts to Halliburton, you go right ahead. Here’s some excerpts, but I encourage you to take ten minutes and read it all. Last November, the Corps assigned Kellogg Brown & Root (KBR), which has been a wholly owned subsidiary of Halliburton since the 1960s, to do a classified study of potential damage and repairs in the Iraqi oil fields. Contrary to Waxman’s assertion, the work was done under a competitively awarded contract system known as the U.S. Army Logistics Civil Augmentation Program, or LOGCAP. …. LOGCAP is, in effect, a multi-year supercontract. In it, the Army makes a deal with a single contractor, in this case Halliburton, to perform a wide range of unspecified services during emergency situations in the future. The last competition for LOGCAP came in 2001, when Halliburton won the contract over several other bidders. Thus, when the oil-field study was needed, Corps officials say, Halliburton was the natural place to turn. “To invite other contractors to compete to perform a highly classified requirement that Kellogg Brown & Root was already under a competitively awarded contract to perform would have been a wasteful duplication of effort,” Corps commander Lt. Gen. Robert Flowers wrote to Waxman in April. …. “Only KBR, the contractor that developed the complex, classified contingency plans, could commence implementing them on extremely short notice,” Flowers wrote Waxman. “The timing was driven by Central Command’s operational requirement to have support available in advance of possibly imminent hostilities.” Flowers added that the contract was always intended as a temporary “bridge” to a more permanent contract that would be offered for competitive bidding. …. The LOGCAP payment method, known as a cost-plus-award, calls for KBR to be paid its costs plus a profit of 1 percent. According to the General Accounting Office, KBR could also earn “an incentive fee of up to nine percent of the cost estimate, based on the contractor’s performance in a number of areas, including cost control.” …. The first LOGCAP was awarded in 1992, as the first Bush administration (including then-Secretary of Defense Cheney) was leaving office. Four companies competed, and the winner was Brown & Root, as it was known at the time (Halliburton changed the name to Kellogg Brown & Root after an acquisition in 1998). The multi-year contract was in effect during much of the Clinton administration. During those years, Brown & Root did extensive work for the Army under the LOGCAP contract in Haiti, Somalia, and Bosnia; contract workers built base camps and provided troops with electrical power, food, and other necessities. In 1997, when LOGCAP was again put up for bid, Halliburton/Brown & Root lost the competition to another contractor, Dyncorp. But the Clinton Defense Department, rather than switch from Halliburton to Dyncorp, elected to award a separate, sole-source contract to Halliburton/Brown & Root to continue its work in the Balkans. According to a later GAO study, the Army made the choice because 1) Brown & Root had already acquired extensive knowledge of how to work in the area; 2) the company “had demonstrated the ability to support the operation”; and 3) changing contractors would have been costly. The Army’s sole-source Bosnia contract with Brown & Root lasted until 1999. At that time, the Clinton Defense Department conducted full-scale competitive bidding for a new contract. The winner was . . . Halliburton/Brown & Root. The company continued its work in Bosnia uninterrupted. …. New details are emerging that suggest the energy giant Halliburton did not overcharge the Defense Department for fuel in Iraq  contrary to the claims of critics in Congress and in the field of Democratic presidential candidates. The Pentagon is investigating allegations that Halliburton overcharged it by $61 million for gasoline and other fuels delivered to Iraq. Halliburton delivered gasoline to Iraq from Kuwait at a price of $2.27 per gallon, while it delivered gas from Turkey for $1.18 per gallon. …. But why did the Corps specify that fuel be delivered from Kuwait? The answer appears to lie with the nature of fuel shortages that swept Iraq in the late spring. After the war, the country’s oil refineries were operating far below capacity. Both gasoline and liquefied petroleum gas, which millions of Iraqis use for cooking, were in very short supply. American officials feared that the shortages might spark civil unrest. Of particular concern was Basra, the city in southern Iraq that had seen increasingly violent expressions of popular anger against coalition forces. According to a source in the Corps of Engineers, in May, Lt. General Ricardo Sanchez, leader of American forces in Iraq, demanded that fuel be supplied to Basra  fast. If you are still reading, congratulations, and go read the whole thing. If not, then I’m wasting my time and I’ll stop here. If prompted, I’m prepared to debate this with Eric or anyone else. I ENJOY this, so bring it on.

 urlLink The New York Times > Editorials & Opinion Let's see what the NYT is talking about today on the editorial page. 1). A free trade issue with Vietnam and China. 2). Giving insurance salesmen access to the military. 3). The Illinois election. 4). The firing of Linda Ronstadt. Hah. Where's the pants??? And on Ms. Ronstadt, here's further proof that they don't get it... This behavior assumes that Ms. Ronstadt had no right to express a political opinion from the stage. It implies - for some members of the audience at least - that there is a philosophical contract that says an artist must entertain an audience only in the ways that audience sees fit. It argues, in fact, that an artist like Ms. Ronstadt does not have the same rights as everyone else. Perhaps her praise for Mr. Moore, even at the very end of her show, did ruin the performance for some people. They have a right to voice their disapproval - to express their opinion as Ms. Ronstadt expressed hers and to ask for a refund. But if their intemperate behavior began to worry the management, then they were the ones who should have been thrown out and told never to return, not Ms. Ronstadt, who threatened, after all, only to sing.

 More questions about Berger's pants. It seems that Clinton knew about this all along, based upon his comments on Drudge and other outlets. Do you think he bothered to tell Kerry? Do you think Kerry might want to know, if he didn't already? Would it be useful for Kerry to realize one of his campaign advisors on National Security has 'paper-attracting pants'? If Kerry has been blindsided by this, then I wouldn't be surprised if the leak came from the Clinton camp. Kerry's poll numbers have been stronger than expected, and a Kerry win would be the end of Hillary's chances. Given Clinton's history, is it unreasonable to think this is possible?

 I should make a mention of the Linda Rondstat and Whoopi Goldberg incidents, since they illustrate the long standing differences between the Right and the Left. In case you haven't heard, Rondstat broke off in the middle of her Vegas act and praised Michael Moore, saying that he preaches the truth and called him a great American. The audience booed and many left the show. As a result, the casino owner fired her that night and asked her to vacate the hotel immediately. Maybe a little heavy handed, but it's his casino. The ever-lovable Whoopi spouted off a potty-mouth tirade against Bush during a Kerry fundraiser, with Kerry and Edwards in attendance. Slim Fast decided they didn't want to be associated with Ms. Goldberg, so they canned her the next day. In both cases, outrage Leftists are invoking the First Amendment. Not surprisingly, this demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of the guarantees of the First Amendment, as well as a fundamental disrespect for the notion of 'private property'. The First Amendment allows you to say anything you want without fear of persecution (although there are limits imposed by the general welfare clause, such as not being able to shout fire in a theater and all of that). However, this freedom of persecution does not establish a right to access private property or to require someone else to continue an association against their will. Does the Left really believe that they should be able to say anything and still force others to provide a stage or hire them to endorse a product? Note that in both cases, the Federal Government had nothing to do with the consequences of this speech. These are private citizens/entities exercising their own rights in response to activities they did not appreciate. The philosophical differences between Left and Right are vast....

Happens all the time. Sheesh.... Update - Kerry has cut Berger loose as an 'advisor' to his campaign. But this incident actually occurred six or seven months ago. How long has Kerry known about this incident? What did Berger show Kerry? Why didn't he act on this earlier? Another Update - From the urlLink NYT "Mr. Berger does not want any issue surrounding the 9/11 commission to be used for partisan purposes," Lanny Breuer, Mr. Berger's attorney, told The Associated Press late this afternoon. Pardon me while I laugh like a constipated Frenchman. The decision to step aside came after a day in which Republicans zeroed in on the disclosure that Mr. Berger, who was President Bill Clinton's national security adviser, removed classified documents from the National Archives last year. Republicans are zeroed in on this?? How about normal law abiding Americans concerned that important information is walking out of secured areas in the pants of a man who once held a post that had the word 'Security' in the title?? Is the NYT convinced that only Republicans are worried about obeying the law? While Democrats had seemed inclined to give Mr. Berger the benefit of the doubt and accept his explanation that the incident with the documents was inadvertent, Republicans were decidedly less charitable. So violating national security should be met with charity?? Unbelievable.

 urlLink TIME.com: 9/11 Commission Finds Ties Between al-Qaeda and Iran A question for Eric and other's who didn't support the Iraq war (and it's okay that you didn't...this is an honest question). The 9/11 commission is reporting.... Next week's much anticipated final report by a bipartisan commission on the origins of the 9/11 attacks will contain new evidence of contacts between al-Qaeda and Iran&#8212;just weeks after the Administration has come under fire for overstating its claims of contacts between al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein's Iraq. A senior U.S. official told TIME that the Commission has uncovered evidence suggesting that between eight and ten of the 14 "muscle" hijackers&#8212;that is, those involved in gaining control of the four 9/11 aircraft and subduing the crew and passengers&#8212;passed through Iran in the period from October 2000 to February 2001. If we have strong evidence that Iran is aiding and sheltering Al Qaeda (and I should point out again that the paralyzed guy who turned himself in last week was in Tehran), then would you support a unilateral invasion of Iran followed by the establishment of a western style democracy? Would you get behind Bush and support it in the face of UN resistance?

 urlLink A Measure of Media Bias I don't enjoy banding the media bias drum, but when something like this comes along, I feel like it needs to be banged. This study has been out there for more than a year now, but you probably haven't heard it about it through the major outlets. What's wrong with the media policing themselves? Or at least having an honest discussion about their own bias? "Our results show a very significant liberal bias. All of the news outlets except FOX score to the left of the average member of congress." All but three news media outlets (Drudge, ABC World News Tonight, and Special Report) were closer to the average Democrat in Congress than to the median member in the House of Representatives. The average Journalist is less than half as likely to have voted for Bush as the average voter in and around Berkeley, California. The average journalist is less than a third as likely to have voted for Bush as the average voter in and around Cambridge, Massachusetts. Journalists' voting habits in 1992 are more than twice as unrepresentative of the public at large as the voting habits of the residents of the most conservative state in the union, Mississippi. The news outlet with the scores closest to the median member of congress--hence the most CENTRIST news outlet, was the Drudge Report. CBS Evening News was furthest from the center. The Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, USA Today, and CBS Evening News each score closer to the score of the average Democrat in congress than they do to the median. The New York Times score is twice as far from the congressional center as Fox News. CBS Evening News scored closer to Senator Ted Kennedy than it did to Joe Biden. Right now, someone is pushing a documentary striving to illustrate Fox News as a Right wing outfit. The movie is being used heavily at Democratic fundraisers. It's interesting that Fox has done several pieces reporting on this film, and asking the question 'does it have any truth to it'. I've seen them do analysis on their own coverage while dissecting parts of the documentary. Why doesn't the NYT or CBS do the same thing? What's wrong with a little introspection?

I don't at the moment, since they are under what is essentially a 'martial law' situation over there right now. I would be troubled if this continues beyond the present crises. It's essential that Iraq adopt the rule of law as soon as it is viable. Now isn't that moment.

 urlLink Another dry run? I can't vouch for the veracity of this story, but it is well worth reading. The take-off was uneventful. But once we were in the air and the seatbelt sign was turned off, the unusual activity began. The man in the yellow T-shirt got out of his seat and went to the lavatory at the front of coach -- taking his full McDonald's bag with him. When he came out of the lavatory he still had the McDonald's bag, but it was now almost empty. He walked down the aisle to the back of the plane, still holding the bag. When he passed two of the men sitting mid-cabin, he gave a thumbs-up sign. When he returned to his seat, he no longer had the McDonald's bag. Then another man from the group stood up and took something from his carry-on in the overhead bin. It was about a foot long and was rolled in cloth. He headed toward the back of the cabin with the object. Five minutes later, several more of the Middle Eastern men began using the forward lavatory consecutively. In the back, several of the men stood up and used the back lavatory consecutively as well. For the next hour, the men congregated in groups of two and three at the back of the plane for varying periods of time. Meanwhile, in the first class cabin, just a foot or so from the cockpit door, the man with the dark suit - still wearing sunglasses - was also standing. Not one of the flight crew members suggested that any of these men take their seats.

 urlLink Kedwards Poster &nbsp; After my impassioned posts of earlier, this one just made me laugh.&nbsp; Sorry...

 An addendum to the last post. &nbsp; It occurred to me yesterday that the Left's criticism of the Bush policies all stem from one fundamental complaint: Bush isn't a psychic. Bush should have seen 9/11 coming. Bush should have spent more money on security when he came into office. Bush should have known where Bin Laden was in Afghanistan. Bush should have known that there were no large stocks of WMD, despite what the world intel services were saying. Bush should have known Iraq would take a long time to pacify. It goes on and on, all of it centered on second guessing decisions that were made before the outcome could have been known. Kedwards talks about what he would have done. How he would have handled it differently, as if that is supposed to be proof of leadership qualities. Maybe Kerry would be a good leader, but this approach isn't sufficient to illustrate that ability. What about those on the Left that predicted ten thousand dead Americans and a one year campaign to take Baghdad? What about the claims from the Left that Saddam would use the WMDs (that they knew all along he didn't have anyway) and take out whole divisions of American soldiers? Again, I can't imagine being so twisted up that I can't acknowledge that Bush has done a pretty good job given the situation and information he has had to work with. Yes, mistakes have been made, but I don't think any of those mistakes came from malfeasance, a dark desire for power, or the presence of a pentagram beneath the Oval Office carpet. Maybe if Bush was in league with Satan, that psychic ability would be part of the package. I frequently bash Bush and my own party when they do stupid things. I've praised Clinton on a few occasions. I LIKE Joe Leiberman, despite the 2000 electoral mess and his willingness to sell out his convictions for the #2 spot on the ticket. I'll praise things when I see them, even if it comes from the other side. All I ask is honesty in our handling of the War on Terror. I ask principled democrats to disavow things like Michael Moore, or comparisons of Bush and Hitler, or Ted Kennedy saying that Abu Ghraib is just like Saddam's practices. We don't need that in a reasoned debate, especially when the stakes are so high.

 Red Vs. Blue Again, since I haven't been as diligent blogging lately, I've lost the link on this particular observation. More and more, America is divided along the lines of the electoral urlLink map of the 2000 election. Each side even has their own movie now. The link I lost pointed to a distribution of where Michael Moore's F911 is making the most money, and it lines up with the Blue regions on the electoral map. Similar data was displayed for The Passion of the Christ, and of course, it lined up with the Red regions. What to make of this polarization? Obviously there are whole books worth of conjecture about why this is so. My concern is in the increasing divergence of our perception of reality, as I had posted about last week. A typical person in the Blue region believes that Bush is dishonest, Iraq is a failure, and the best course of action is to figure out how to get the world to love us. And that's just on foreign policy. Domestically, we have the old Big Government solutions of the 40s coupled with a fundamental distrust of the market and a need for government oversight to assure the prosperity of all. A typical person in the Red region believes the Iraqi war was more than justified, and our standing in the world isn't quite as important as our resolve to confront those that means us harm. Domestically, they general distrust the government, and would like to see a reduction in government size at various levels. We both can't be right. I'm young and relatively blind to the more recent trends of political history when it comes to personal experience. I can go back and read accounts of the last fifty years of politics, and I can see that many of the fundamental questions have not been resolved. Nor are they likely to be solved anytime soon, at least in a manner that forces one side to abandon their ideas. What concerns me is the inability of either side to have an honest debate. There's has always been distortion and mudslinging, but at least there seemed to be honest disagreement about what to do regarding issues, rather then the default assumption that the other side is either evil, stupid, or both. We're becoming two Americas, and not in the way that John Edwards means in his stump speech. I'm a Red state voter. I am conservative, because I believe conservatism is a good thing, and is the correct way to govern a large collection of people. I believe in our response to Terrorism, and as a matter of fact, I think we should go even farther with our application of force. These perceptions, given the facts at hand, seem the most reasonable to me. I can only imagine abandoning them if some unimaginable evidence surfaced that we're doing the wrong thing, and note the word 'unimaginable'. So I find myself entrenched in a position I can't imagine leaving, yet I look at the other side in the mirror image world and wonder 'why can't they wake up?'. I'm sure they say the same thing about me. I can't abandon my beliefs. I can't move to the mushy middle and try to pretend that both sides have merit when I see so very little on the other side of the fence that is worth defending. I can't be one of these so called high minded moderates who seem to enjoy not having any beliefs in anything, unless it is a belief in relativism. If two people are arguing about whether or not a house is on fire, it isn't 'principled' to say that 'the house could be on fire, but maybe it isn't'. So I can't embrace the middle, and the Left is the opposite of everything I believe. &nbsp; What do I do? I remain a Red Stater. And I'll continue to look at the other side like they are from another planet, so long as they refuse to embrace the bulk of evidence that they are wrong. I imagine they will pretty much do the same. Where do we go from here? Is urlLink secession a bad thing?

 urlLink John Edward's Tax Shelter Via Iraq NOW. I want to be fair when it comes to criticism of the Kedwards ticker, and this attack on John Edwards is not valid. Edwards has been accused of sheltering his income in a way to avoid paying $600,000 in 'taxes'. In fact, all that Edwards did is incorporate his business as an S Corporation, which is a standard practice in professional practices. An S Corporation provides a liability shield on personal assets, and also allows 'pass through taxation', meaning that the corporation does not pay taxes on dividends, so Edwards takes his compensation and then pays taxes as an individual. This way, Edwards doesn't have to pay Medicaid taxes on dividends. There's absolutely nothing wrong with this. It's smart, and the right thing to do. I'd rather see us be fair to Edwards on this one and hammer him on legitimate issues.

 Some thoughts. I waited too long to link to a news site, but most of you have seen the surrender of the 'spiritual advisor' to Bin Laden giving himself up under the Saudi amnesty plan. There are a few things about this that I find interesting, beyond the obvious glee at bagging another bad guy, even if he wasn't an active terrorist. 1). This guy appeared in a video with Bin Laden in December 2001, where he praised Bin Laden on the 9/11 strike. They gloated together for some time. 2). This guy is paralyzed from the waist down, confined to a wheel chair. 3). He turned himself in to the Saudi Embassy in Tehran, Iran. Now, if Bin Laden is hanging out in the Afghan mountains through late 2001 and early 2002, how does this paralyzed elderly man get to a meeting with Bin Laden? Strap him to a mule? Or is it likely that Bin Laden was or is hanging out in the outskirts of Tehran? What seems likely? And by the way, I just noticed that this is post number 1,200 in the history of this blog. I don't know if I should be proud or disturbed.

That dream has now probably evaporated. It is hard to see how a President John Kerry would now want Wilson in his inner circle. But if he desired to return to Gabon or Niger I, for one, would not be among those opposing him. Joe Wilson is going to be a huge factor in the campaign if Kerry doesn't publicly rebuke any connections with Wilson.

 A few things going on here... Blogging has been very light lately, and I hope to get back to my usual volume. I am grateful for the two or three people who do read this, and I hope I can continue to entertain or anger you depending on your particular views. I feel as if I am about to navigate out of a long and dark storm at work. I can see the light on the horizon, and the waves are subsiding as we get closer to Emancipation Day - Wednesday July 14th is the final day I will have to deal with a particular person here. I regret that things have reached this point, but based upon all that I've heard regarding her ability to interact with integrity, this isn't entirely my fault. The important thing is I will be free from a great source of stress and unhappiness, even as I wish her well on her new job. This is one of those situations where the magnitude of the unhappiness isn't obvious until it is removed, so my disposition in general has improved remarkably. I returned to hockey last night, starting another 8 game season. Unfortunately, we lost in overtime. The teams have been mixed this season, so I had to face a few of my old team mates, who seemed to have a good understanding of my weaknesses based upon how they were exploited. The humidity on the rink last night could best be described as 'Soul Rending', and I think I'm still dehydrated twelve hours later. It's just going to get worse from here on, so if blogging suddenly ceases, you know what will happen.

Well.... Wilson last year launched a public firestorm with his accusations that the administration had manipulated intelligence to build a case for war. He has said that his trip to Niger should have laid to rest any notion that Iraq sought uranium there and has said his findings were ignored by the White House. Wilson's assertions -- both about what he found in Niger and what the Bush administration did with the information -- were undermined yesterday in a bipartisan Senate intelligence committee report. The panel found that Wilson's report, rather than debunking intelligence about purported uranium sales to Iraq, as he has said, bolstered the case for most intelligence analysts. And contrary to Wilson's assertions and even the government's previous statements, the CIA did not tell the White House it had qualms about the reliability of the Africa intelligence that made its way into 16 fateful words in President Bush's January 2003 State of the Union address.

 Myself and the family are off on vacation. Won't be back till the 19th. I'm sure I'll have much to catch up on, as the world ceases to exist outside of our little bubble.....

 I'm a little worn out by political news today. I was chatting with Mike last night, and the whole weight of this campaign seemed to come crashing down on me. It's increasingly clear that we will never have a landslide election again, at least for a generation or more. It seems that all elections are now destined to be close, as each side is fully entrenched, and no real debate happens anymore. Don't get me wrong - I endorse the two party system as the best possible way of running the nation. A parliamentary system of factions coming together long enough to govern before dissolving in rancor is not the way to go. But it is clear that we have reached a point of irreconcilable differences between the two sides. And I find that sad. Particularly when we contemplate the magnitude of the challenge before us. The crater of the World Trade Center, for a moment, looked like a scar that would bring us together with a common purpose. Now, that crater has just been turned into an amphitheater, where both sides gather to hurl invective at one another. It is the cusp of the fracture that is running through the country, and that frightens and amazes me. I have honestly tried to understand those that say, to various degrees, that the WOT is unwinnable, should not be fought, should not be widened to Iraq, or should only be pursued with other nations that are clearly intending to block us on this. I have tried to remain open to the arguments, but the stacks upon stacks of hard evidence limit my ability to seriously examine the flights of fancy of the entrenched Left. Just as they believe I am a brainwashed zombie, I am now looking at them as aliens from another planet at best, and mentally damaged children at worst. How can people cling to the idea that either Bush Knew, Bush Lied, Bush is Evil, or Bush is In Bed With Terrorists? How can someone make the principled argument that Iraq is a failure in the face of so much evidence that things are going quite well there, or how can they ignore the historical precedent of occupation in Japan and Germany, with the same sort of insurgency and difficulties? How can people blind themselves to history when the stakes are so high? The other side can try to make the same argument about my positions, but for the life of me, I can't understand where they are coming from. I can't comprehend a chain of events that suggests America is at fault, or a strong response is wrong, or that the establishment of freedom in another part of the world is wrong, immoral, or simply not our problem. In the words of urlLink Tony Blair ... And I know it's hard on America, and in some small corner of this vast country, out in Nevada or Idaho or these places I've never been to, but always wanted to go... I know out there there's a guy getting on with his life, perfectly happily, minding his own business, saying to you, the political leaders of this country, "Why me? And why us? And why America?" And the only answer is, "Because destiny put you in this place in history, in this moment in time, and the task is yours to do." This is our task. And I believe we should have honest debate how to go about it. We should have honest discussion about the mechanics of war, the targets, the timing and so forth. Instead, we are consumed with a gleeful desire to see our efforts fail, in the name of political gain. In the months before the Iraqi War, we HAD a good debate on going to war, but once war is entered, the time for that debate has passed, and we must focus on making it work - not trying to see it fail so one can point to one's earlier objection. We should be asking the question - what next? We should be debating the need to strike Iran or Syria, instead of being dishonest about the occupation, the justification of war, and the ever growing evidence of WMD programs in Iraq. This is an issue that goes beyond traditional politics. If Clinton had been in office on 9/11 and he had been the strong one in the face of GOP resistance, I'd vote for him. Nothing else matters at this point in time, and despite my issues with Bush, I see him not as the best man, but as the man defending the best ideas. I don't give a crap about his affiliation, his social policies, and his economic policies, many of which I don't like. This is a single issue election. Let's be honest. On 9/12/01, how many of you thought that we would go 34 months and counting without another attack on US soil? Yet 40%+ of Americans think we are losing the War on Terror, or at best, not engaging it properly. Where is the honest introspection? Have we made mistakes in the War on Terror? Of course we have. We've blown some calls. Iraq didn't have as much as we thought, but I believe we acted with honor in our misunderstanding of the true capability. The WORLD thought Saddam had more, and I still believe that we don't yet have a good understanding of his true capabilities even now. Abu Ghraib? Yes, that was a mess. Poor PR? Absolutely. It hasn't all been roses, but to paint these errors as evidence of utter failure is simply beyond my ability to comprehend. The differences seem too great to breach. How do you have a reasonable discussion with people who refuse to believe facts, or choose to embrace the lies of Michael Moore or the New York Times? And how do you deal with it when the stakes are so very high? I'm just worn out.

 urlLink CNN.com - Reporter gets inside look at insurgency - Jul 7, 2004 : I'm not quite sure what I think about this. My first instinct is to stand up for journalism and their freedoms (even if they don't exercise responsibility). But then later, I begin to wonder if the bad guys should have this kind of access to media channels. Yeah, I know there isn't much that can be done to stop it, so I'm reduced to forming an opinion about a journalist who would serve as such a conduit. "'This video is straight from the mujahedeen,' journalist Michael Ware said as he viewed the tape at a hotel in Baghdad. 'This is the Blackwater killings. They talk about planning it. I can't believe this.' Ware, an Australian reporter working for TIME magazine, is walking a professional knife-edge, an unlikely go-between for anti-Western militants and the media." The terrorists are becoming more and more media savvy, and by providing these tapes, they demonstrate an understanding of what moves an average Westerner. Just as they calculated correctly on Spain's response to 3/11, they think they've got a handle on what makes an American react. So should we be helping them in this way? Is this responsible journalism? Or is it the same as the non-stop Abu Ghraib pictures inciting more and more hatred? I'm not sure I'm ready to render an opinion on this one.

It is a tired but true cliche that in Hollywood, all movies must be pitched in terms of other movies. Things are always described as a mating of two or three other concepts in order to get the suits to understand the concept in under eight seconds. Well, this review is a good example. "King Arthur" was directed by Antoine Fuqua, and resembles his earlier film "Training Day" in the visceral, gritty nature of its battles. It was written by David Franzoni, and resembles his earlier film "Gladiator" in its manly-manness and its obsession for historical lore. ... If "King Arthur" brings to mind any previous film that Bruckheimer produced, it's "Black Hawk Down." Both share the same cinematographer, Slawomir Idziak, and at times share a similarly bleached-out, grainy look. ... But Knightley continues to prove herself a versatile young actress: She can do comedy ("Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"), she can do romance ("Love Actually"), she can be young and fresh in a girl power movie ("Bend It Like Beckham"). ... Winstone, so excellent in "Sexy Beast," here provides sporadic, much-needed comic relief as a knight whose girlfriend has given birth to so many of their children, they've assigned them numbers rather than names. ... And Owen, so suave in the excellent noir hit "Croupier," provides weight, intelligence and heroism to go along with his dark good looks. OK, maybe it is only funny to me.

 Early morning quote from T.E. Lawrence about radical Muslims from 1922. Very applicable 80 years later and describes a cycle we are going through... "The Wahabis, followers of a fanatical Moslem heresy, had impressed their strict rules on easy and civilized Kasim. In Kasim there was but little coffee-hospitality, much prayer and fasting, no tobacco, no artistic dalliance with women, no silk clothes, no gold or silver head ropes or ornaments. Everything was forcibly pious or forcibly puritanical. It was a natural phenomenon, this periodic rise at internals of little more than a century, of ascetic creeds in Central Arabia. Always the votaries found their neighbor's beliefs cluttered with inessential things, which had become impious in the hot imagination of their preachers. Again and again they had arisen, had taken possession, soul and body, of the tribes, and had dashed themselves to pieces on the urban Semites, merchants, and concupiscent men of the world. About their comfortable possessions the new creeds ebbed and flowed like the tides or the changing seasons, each movement with the seeds of early death in its excess of rightness. Doubtless they must recur so long as the causes -- sun, moon, wind, acting in the emptiness of open spaces, weigh without check on the unhurried and unencumbered minds of the desert dwellers." --T.E. Lawrence, The Seven Pillars of Wisdom (1922)

Are the American people interested in being 'sensitive' as we try to protect our way of life? Keep talking John. I thought Bush had the monopoly on entertaining speech. Well, not to worry Todd. The president took hold of that monopoly the very next day: "Now in terms of the balance between running down intelligence and bringing people to justice obviously is -- we need to be very sensitive on that." --G.W.

 urlLink OpinionJournal - Featured Article Stem Cell Research You probably have heard and may think (as I did) that Laura Bush and the Bush administration wants to ban embryonic stem cell research. This is plainly not the case as this editorial shows. It seems all that Bush wants to prevent is the growing of embryos for the purposes of harvesting them for stem cells. I disagree with his reasons for this, but I can accept a compromise that uses the already destroyed embryos for research. This is the future of medicine, and I'm heartened immensely to learn that we are forging ahead in this field. I dream that one day we will be free of cancer, alzheimers, and a host of other ailments. Perhaps it is too much to dream, and the taxpayers should spend the money on paying unwed, unfit mothers to have babies. What do you think about this issue? I say there is nothing wrong with paying women to grow a fetus to be used as medical material. I know this sounds wrong in some way, but it seems a logical outgrowth of the pro-choice position. Yes, I am pro-choice. The only condition I have is that an arbitrary stop point must be legally enforced as to when an embryo becomes a US citizen. Until then it is a part of the woman's body. Back to the "Stem Cell Ban." Do you see how the Government's involvement in this issue (as funding research or not) has made progress less likely? Since they have been willing to fund it, they control it. Different politcal whims and expediencies could put an end to this promising new field. If the government obeyed the COnstitution, they would never been involved with this at all. Provate firms would pour money into it and breakthroughs would be more likely. Instead we have edicts from on high telling us what we can and can not research. The government is not the answer to all of life's problems!

 urlLink The American Spectator This blurb can be found at the bottom of the page. "According to a Kerry campaign source, senior campaign advisers tasked two Washington-based campaign staffers to vet the recently published Unfit for Command. 'The purpose was to compare what that book had with what we had on file from Senator Kerry,' says the campaign source, who said that the research project developed more than 75 instances where Kerry's recollections, previous remarks, or writings conflicted with the book's reporting. 'We took some of the most glaring examples, like the Christmas in Cambodia story, and presented them to senior staff, and we assume that those things were put in front of Senator Kerry,' says the source. 'We haven't heard a word about it. All we were told is that it was being taken care of.' The campaign source said that the book was not considered a 'serious' problem for the campaign, because, ' the media wouldn't have the nerve to come at us with this kind of stuff,' says the source. 'The senior staff believes the media is committed to seeing us win this thing , and that the convention inoculated us from these kinds of stories. The senior guys really think we don't have a problem here.'" Nice....no bias though...not at all.

As this issue moves along, do we really want to let Other Countries deal with the Iranians on the nuclear issue? Will the Europeans, no friends to Israel, stand firm against Iranian proliferation? And would this ever rise to the level of unilateral intervention in a Kerry administration? UPDATE - Some interesting analysis of this story over at urlLink Captain's Quarters .

 urlLink Yahoo! News - LA Council Backs Anti-Wal-Mart Measure More irrational Wal-Mart hatred. The council overwhelmingly endorsed a proposal that would require Wal-Mart and other retailers to show that their nonunion discount stores would not hurt jobs, wages or businesses in the surrounding area, as union leaders and competitors claim. Can I translate? COMPETITORS are complaining that COMPETITION is hurting them. And that requires government intervention?

 urlLink boortz.com: Nealz Nuze Today's Nuze Again, I really don't care too much about the Swift Boat Vets ad. Trying to view this from the perspective of a campaign manager, wouldn't it be far easier and more effective to just refute the charges by releasing medal citation records or other service records to set the facts straight? Seriously, trying to be non-partisan for a moment....why not just blow away the allegation rather than attack the messenger? Yeah, I know both sides do it, and I hate it when my side does it as well. But wouldn't it be better to use the facts of Kerry's service instead? "The Democratic National Committee has reportedly created a 'Brown Book' that contain what has been described as 'damaging military records, personal credit histories, medical histories, psychiatric histories, divorce records ...' A DNC insider is reported to have said 'We've got the goods on the veterans who oppose Kerry.' Word is that some of these books have already been delivered to Kerry-friendly reporters."

 urlLink CNN.com - U.S. warns militia: Quit or die - Aug 11, 2004 The headline is more like what I want to see in our handling of the insurgents. It's about time. However, I heard some interesting theories last night on one of the talk shows. The longer Sadr is alive, the more radicals flock to his cause, streaming into Najaf and mixing it up with US Marines (usually that's not the healthiest thing to be doing). Perhaps we've let Sadr hang around to serve as the lightning rod, drawing the bad guys out into open conflict. They've invested heavily in Sadr's viability as an alternative to the Provisional Government, and they're going to fight to keep him going. Crazy like a fox?

 urlLink No Oil for Pacifists If you have any interest in the "Christmas in Cambodia" mess that Kerry recently stepped in, go here and bone up. It's actually kind of funny, but still not really important in my mind.

 urlLink UN refuses to protect its own mission in Baghdad This is amusing. "The United Nations has failed to organize a special force in Iraq with the limited mission of securing its own headquarters. UN officials said member states refused to contribute to a proposed force that would protect a UN mission in Baghdad. The mission was meant to mark the return of the UN presence in Iraq after a year's absence and help organize and monitor national elections in January 2005. .... 'We haven't had much success attracting governments to sign up for the dedicated force to protect the UN personnel in Iraq and our property,' Annan said. 'So for the time being, for practical measures, we have no other choice but to rely on the multinational force.' " So Kofi can't get 'Other Countries' to protect the UN, so he has to rely on the 'multinational force'? I thought we were 'going it alone' in Iraq? Bow to the all-wise UN!

 urlLink ABCNEWS.com : Groups File Complaint Over Anti-Kerry Ad Look, I'm on record already saying I don't really care about the Swift Boat Ad. But this is just silly. Three campaign finance watchdog groups filed a complaint Tuesday accusing a group of Vietnam veterans of violating the campaign finance law by airing an ad that challenges Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry's military record. Democracy 21, the Center for Responsive Politics and the Campaign Legal Center argue that the ad by Swift Boat Veterans for Truth violates a federal ban on the use of unlimited donations, often referred to as "soft money," to influence federal elections. Uh, what about MoveOn.org ads? What about Planned Parenthood ads? Campaign Finance Reform is and was a completely laughable piece of legislation, and shame on all parties (including Bush) for pushing it through. It's absurd to restrict speech in a political season, just unbelievably absurd.

 urlLink European and Pacific Stars & Stripes Now Kerry is talking to Stars and Stripes, endorsing the war!? "They went into Iraq in a brilliant military strategy, which we all adopted and supported, but they didn't have a plan to win the peace. They didn't bring other [countries] to our side. They didn't give our troops all the equipment - the body armor and the armored Humvees and things they need and deserve." 'Other countries'? I guess England is now one of our colonies. Did France and Germany merge under the new title Other Countries? Interesting... Kerry: I can guarantee that … within my first term, I will have a substantial reduction in troops [in Iraq], yes. Stripes: Is 17,000 [troops] enough in Afghanistan? Kerry: No. Stripes: Would you put more Americans in there first? While your diplomacy works? Kerry: No, I’d like to expand the NATO presence there, and I’d like to expand other countries’ involvements. But I do think that this administration is diverting from the real war on terror, which was in Afghanistan against al-Qaida, to Iraq, and I think it’s cost us dearly. France already vetoed NATO presence in Afghanistan. Is Kerry just going to ask nicer? Stripes: Increasing end strength, even the 40,000 soldiers that you’re talking about, that takes time. We have a readership of young troops in the field right now, and I think they want to know what you’re going to do immediately to help their situation. Kerry: I will seek a much greater level of both NATO and other-nation involvement in the training of Iraqi troops and Iraqi security [forces]. We’ll provide greater Iraqi security on the ground and reduce the burden on our own troops … so it’s not an American occupation. And that will greatly reduce the risk to the soldiers in Iraq. Uh, France also vetoed using NATO to train Iraqi troops. Again, ask nicer? I thought our policy wouldn't be held hostage to other nation's interests? Elect Kerry - because the French will listen to him?

 urlLink Kerry: Still Would Have Approved Force for Iraq WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT!!!! What in the world is this?? Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry said on Monday he would have voted for the congressional resolution authorizing force against Iraq even if he had known then no weapons of mass destruction would be found. What happened to "I was mislead by Bush"?? He's now saying he would have voted for force anyway? So he votes for the use of force, now saying the so called 'BUSH LIED' evidence wasn't a big part of it, and yet he still blasts the president for using the force that Kerry authorized? What, was the authorization not really an authorization? What did it mean John?? Geez....

 OK, long post coming (surprised?). First, I'm going to start continuing what I consider the best thread of the day with Danny to a new entry at the top of the Blog each morning. It's difficult to follow the comment threads as they drift downward to the bottom of the Blog. And I'm really pleased with some of Danny's answers, because I think we're getting closer to that root I've been seeking. Addressing Danny directly, let me say a few things. I'm not here to set you up, or try to trap you in a logic puzzle. I'm not seeking out inconsistencies as a means to annihilate your entire platform. I'm not here to 'defeat' you. I really want to understand the core of your beliefs, and I appreciate the fact that you have came out and said, on one thread, that you weren't sure of the answer. I'm not always sure either, but I think exploring these uncertainties serves a few valuable functions. Notably, beliefs should be challenged, because it either exposes a flaw or strengthens them through a rational, well thought out defense. I don't really care which way we go here, as both are worthy pursuits. So I want to keep prodding your replies, as well as my own, in an attempt to find the cracks and see how that changes our views on issues. So keep that in mind as we go back and forth, at least with me. Why am I so interested? The answer might surprise you. As late as 1990, I was just like you. I was a rabid leftist. I hated Reagan. I remember being so depressed when Dukakis lost. Kennedy was a great man. I thought Ollie North should burn in hell (although I never could articulate why). I was way out there on the left, and couldn't ever imagine how someone could be so twisted as to believe in the conservative movement. So I see some of myself in your positions, and I'm really curious about your internal logic and consistency. Sometime we can talk about my own transition to where I am now, but I'd rather kick some of these things around and see where they go. And again, please don't feel like it's a trap. If you change your mind on an earlier statement, that's fine! It's the point of the exercise. I really want this to be a positive conversation - no one 'wins', we're just talking. That being said, there are a couple of things I'd like to lay out for more conversation. Well, I'm really not the best to explain this. I'm not entirely sure what all the president is supposed to do to encourage job growth. However, Bush has given tax breaks to companies that export jobs out of the United States. Kerry has stated that, if elected, he'd overturn these tax breaks and start offering tax incentives to companies that keep more of their labor force in the U.S.A. What does this mean? Bush is discouraging domestic job growth while Kerry is suggesting that we encourage domestic job growth. As a freshman in college, I'd be happy to know that the man running our country was working to increase my chances for employment, rather than the alternative. A wise person recently pointed out that the only real flaw in capitalism is the illiquid nature of labor. Capital and money can flow where they are needed almost overnight, while labor, in the form of human lives, requires a bit more effort to deploy and change as the economy alters. I acknowledge this as a limitation, but I see it as more of a problem in culture than a problem in application. We are slow to let go of industry that no longer offers a competitive advantage to our economy, and this slowness is a result of the inconvenience to the workers displaced. Speaking from the perspective of a healthy macro economy, I agree that we should not attempt to hold on to jobs that can be done elsewhere for cheaper. If a good or service can be obtained for a cheaper price, lowering the cost and making said good or service more widely available due to this lower price, then this is a good thing. And while you can take that to an immediate extreme and say that no one has a job so no one can afford the product, the economy rarely works in that way. As an example, at one time we made almost all of the steel in the world. We had the skills and labor to do so at a rate that couldn't be beat by other nations. That isn't true anymore, but we have replaced those types of jobs with higher technology applications. It's bad for the steel worker, sure. But all labor must face the possibility, the reality, that new skills must be acquired. While it isn't always reasonable to expect a 30 year steel worker to morph into a clean room worker in a medical device plant, the inconvenience does not alter the reality of economics. It isn't always possible to hang on to industries that are no longer an advantage in terms of labor and cost. In the big picture, we are healthier for moving from older technologies to new industry. How many telephone operators are employed in the US? Typists? As a nation, we are better off in the long run. The recent pain of these transitions is more of a function of the pace of technology. In the past, it took us a whole working career to transition from agriculture to manufacturing. Most people could squeeze out their working lives in their job, and the younger force coming up would take on the new industry. Manufacturing to Information Technology was a much faster transition, catching a lot of people in the middle of their career. Now these transitions are coming in the span of a few years, displacing people at a faster rate. The required adaptation of labor is harsher now, and we must all be ready to change lives two or three times in our working career. So I'm wondering, beyond the idea of creating tax incentives for retaining domestic jobs, how does this help the nation as a whole? If Mexico can build a consumer electronic for $3, and we can do it for $4, how does offering a tax incentive affect the final consumer price of said item? Should the consumer be asked to pay more to retain a job that no longer makes economic sense? Again, I'm not attacking you or your idea here. I want to understand your thinking. My perspective on this, given the difficulty in making labor liquid, is that there is opportunity in shedding these jobs that no longer make sense. Again, speaking on the macro perspective, a depressed pool of labor breeds opportunity for new products and new industry. For example, if I have invented a product, but I cannot afford to take the plunge and hire some people to build it when the going labor rate is $20, then my product doesn't take off. If a plant shuts down in my area, I may find some people willing to do it for $15, and suddenly I can afford to hire a few guys to make the product work. If I have a good product, it could take off and I'm hiring twenty, fifty, a hundred people. Wages go up to retain good labor. Efficiencies increase, allowing me to divert money to new applications, resulting in even more jobs at a higher wage. This is how the computer came about, or software publishers get started. Displacement results in people willing to try something new, which can grow into something better. The capitalism axiom of creative destruction applies to outsourcing. Yes, again it is hard on the worker, but new industry breeds security, while dying industries rarely can be saved. Of course my example is intended in general terms, from the macro perspective. And this segues into my question about Gates vs. The Mother. First, I should make it clear that I do admire and respect what she did for the poor over there. No doubt about it, I could never do it, and she deserves praise. However in terms of actual benefit for humanity (as opposed to Seattle residents vs. Calcutta residents) I think Gates is hands down the more useful human being. You said that if Gates hadn't done it, then someone else would have done it. Okay, same for the Mother. Let's talk about the Gates persona vs. the Mother Teresa persona. Someone would have done both tasks, but that doesn't change my discussion about which task is better for humanity. You've obviously grasped the thrust of my argument - job creation, but it does go a little deeper. Not only has Gates actions created jobs, but those workers went on to create products that have fundamentally altered the way business is done. The effect of their work has decreased the price of about every product imaginable, through the streamlining of distribution models, the efficiency of cash transaction, and the multiplication of R&D efforts in about every product out there. These second and third order effects have reduced cost, increased output, and raised standards of living for just about all Americans, and a good chunk of the world. So in those terms, I'm not sure what you mean when you say that Gates has done 'no good'. How is good defined? Improving the lives of others? Sure, Mother Teresa helped ease suffering for an astonishingly poor people, but her actions did not create self-sustaining conditions that offered a way out of blinding poverty in India. She couldn't do that, because that wasn't her purpose. The people she tended to do not have access to the means to improve their fundamental situation, and her actions did not address this shortcoming directly. And that isn't her fault directly. She was more concerned about immediate pain, and didn't really address the cause of such pain. So can you clarify your criteria for good vs. bad? And that brings me back to outsourcing. Lets go to India, the turf of Mother Teresa and ask some questions. Indians are figuring out how to turn the one commodity they have, brains, into a product that will attract capital and elevate their standard of living out of poverty. They have entered the world economy, peddling their people as phone workers. This is a real attempt at addressing the poverty plaguing their nation. By all the rules of Free Trade, they have the right to do this. Would you deny them this opportunity? Which should they have - ten more Mother Teresa's holding their hands as they die, or access to a job sector that can provide food, education, better housing and hope for a future? Which is the moral choice for India? I look forward to a good conversation about all of this.

 Hey, Mike. I thought you should know (in case you missed it) that I replied to your question about media bias in urlLink this thread . I'd appreciate it if you would read it.

 My movie odyssey. Saturday morning dawned with nothing much for me to do, so I decided it might be a good time to get in some movies that I've been wanting to see. Since most everything on my list didn't interest Diane, I decided to go by myself and just do a marathon of matinee showings out in Maumee, Ohio. The first thing I did was apply to the Department of Justice for a travel permit, in accordance with the draconian PATRIOT act and the martial law that had been imposed in a Bushian attempt to control our lives. After swearing allegiance to Mein Fuhrer, permission was granted for me to drive across town. The barricades and roadblocks were easily negotiable, as I am a white man - a member of the privileged class. Upon arriving at the theater, I decided to start with a 10:40 showing of I, Robot. I had fairly low expectations for this film, but I decided to view it anyway since I did love the Asimov story, and was curious about what they had done to it. I noticed no interest in F911, but that might be due to the machine gun emplacement at the theater doors, along with the Republican hate squads on the prowl for anyone even looking a little liberal - more stifling of dissent! After sitting through several public service announcements, and reciting the PATRIOT Act mandated Pledge to Our Savior, the best part of any movie going experience started - the trailers! If you are like me, this really is the purpose of seeing a movie. Each upcoming trailer is a small thrill, like a present to be unwrapped. You don't know what is going to start rolling after that green or red frame displaying the rating, and as Mark had said earlier, the previews are so much better than the resulting film. Several average movies paraded by, none really getting my attention. Until urlLink this hit the screen. This has got to be one of the best trailers I have seen in many years. If there had been a credit card machine embedded in the seat, I would have purchased tickets right there and then. I couldn't wait to hand my money to someone. I'm becoming more and more of a fan of Asian cinema, and this fulfills all the criteria of a good Asian movie. The visuals are stunning and the violence stylized. The plot might suck, but I would still be happy if the film delivers what the trailer promises. Watch the whole thing, to the very end. I Robot actually surpassed my expectations by NOT being an utter pile of garbage. It was still mostly bad, but not mindlessly bad. It had that Minority Report feel in terms of the technology - clean, functional lines and a dependence on computers even when a simple 'on' button would be better. The plot conventions are typical of Hollywood, where no one actually designs anything while thinking about what might go wrong. No Failure Mode and Effects Analysis in the future. "Gee, what if we have to shut it down? The off switch is suspended 30 stories in the air reachable only by narrow gantries and a switch guarded by the very thing we might want to shut down someday." "Be quiet, and make the gantries more flimsy." I Robot was a wonderful story about racism and the definition of life. I Robot the movie had a few moments where they could have really explored racism, especially when the two major cops were both black. Instead, they squandered a real nice chance to explore the issues that make Science Fiction such a nice medium for turning our world on it's head so we can see if from another angle. Instead, we get flash and bang, guns and bullets, and poetic scenes of Will Smith flying through the air while pumping lead into a moving target a la Neo. Too bad. After this film, I received permission from a Homeland Security agent to leave the theater and grab a quick lunch before returning for a showing of Collateral. The preview cycle for Collateral was very good, and I got a second viewing of the Hero trailer, mentioned above. Once again, I felt like waving some cash around and begging someone to give me a ticket. A mediocre trailer for Alexander offered nothing more than an instant of Alexander on a horse facing off with a mounted elephant - a great image, but gone too fast. It's an Oliver Stone film, so I'm sure Alexander travels to Viet Nam and is ultimately killed by plague introduced by the CIA. Another 'new' movie (to me) was Suspect Zero, staring Ben Kingsley. If you've seen Sexy Beast and House of Sand and Fog, then Kingsley automatically earns ticket money from me, at least until he makes something bad. He plays a remote viewer (to reach Art Bell, west of the Rockies dial 1-800....) who decides to take our serial killers on his own. So he's running from other agents while slaying his way across the country in various colorful ways. Again, I don't know if it is any good, buy you have Kingsley looking menacing and killing people while speaking with a slight British accent. What more do you need? I had mentioned on Friday that I had high expectations for Collateral. Michael Mann is a great director who isn't afraid to let a story develop at it's own pace. I'm not ready to declare Collateral as the major film of the year so far, but it was VERY good. If you are old enough to remember Miami Vice, you'll see similarities here. Mann lets the camera roll while the characters are doing what normal people do, and you get a sense of normalcy and everydayness that works well. There are a couple of long sequences where we follow the cab as it drives around LA, accompanied by whatever music is appropriate (electric, jazz, classical), all the while getting a sense of the disconnectedness of LA and the characters from one another. It's like a small music video that really sets the mood. We see Cruise and Fox in the cab through rain drizzled windows, out of focus as they drive by. A sense of regular life, which makes the events of the film more interesting. It builds a sympathy that is believable, since it is so easy to reflect on your own quiet, boring moments waiting on something to happen while driving across town, or just relaxing. It works so well. And Mann has structured the film like a bunch of smaller films all related by certain themes. Each extended scene plays like a self contained story, exploring a specific aspect of the characters. You watch Fox absorb some of the hardness of Cruise while at the same time repulsed by what his passenger does for a living. You also get a longing sense from Cruise, a man who denies life, and we wonder why. It's nice to see two actors act, just sitting in a cab talking about an improbable situation with a minimum of hysteria. The dialogue is really good, but a little hard to hear at times. My only complaint is about a shootout in a nightclub, where I'm not entirely clear about who represents whom. I can't tell the cops from the bad guys from the other bad guys. It doesn't ruin it, but it takes me out of the scene a little when I'm trying to figure out who just got capped. There is also another minor thread following a couple of cops trying to sort things out, but it seems out of place in the film, and I suspect editing disposed of a lot of footage. Collateral is a film that requires your attention. You need to pay attention, relax, and let it happen. I think you'll find your time rewarded. This isn't a film to half-watch on DVD while your kids play in the next room. You need focus. I nearly bought a ticket to the Manchurian Candidate, but Diane called and asked me to come home. After four plus hours of watching, I decided I'd probably had enough.

 urlLink FT.com / Industries / Transport - Italy orders airlines to curb fare deals An example of all that is wrong with EU policy. Italy has ordered leading European airlines, including British Airways and Germany's Lufthansa, to stop offering lower fares than Alitalia, the struggling majority state-owned Italian flag carrier, on competing long-haul services.

 I'd like to pursue this question, because I think it drives to the heart of each person's philosophy. Which person has done more good in the world - Mother Theresa or Bill Gates? And to make it easier, I'll exclude all the charity work of the Gates Foundation when making this determination. Obviously, because I'm asking when the answer appears so obvious to most, you can correctly assume I'm all for Gates over the good Mother. I think we've discussed this before, but I'd like to go over it with Danny, to get to those core values.

 On July 30th, Mike asked me, "Why can't we all agree on the Facts? [...] Facts like the improving economy." Here are a few tidbits: urlLink In Blow to Bush, Only 32,000 Jobs Created in July by David Leonhardt at the New York Times on August 7, 2004. The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 indices are at 2004 lows. The Nasdaq has fallen 9.1%, the S&P 2.8%, over the past 7 months. Source: urlLink Bulls are unfazed by long decline by Adam Shell and Matt Krantz at USA TODAY on August 5, 2004. That fact seems to conflict with the unsourced "fact" you stated. Care to elaborate, Mike? *As the print edition of this USA Today article asked, "In face of new lows, is it optimism - or denial?" Ask yourself that question, Mike, and get back to me on what you decide.

 A continuation of urlLink this thread. Mike says: I'm flabbergasted. Todd and I offer reason and facts and all you say is "Bush ignored briefings." No, Mike, if you look a little deeper into all the posts I've made in this thread, you'll probably notice that the total word count vastly surpasses 3 . Bush ignored briefings, yes, as did Rumsfeld, Ashcroft and (most of all) National Security Advisor Condi Rice. And they didn't just ignore briefings. Look back a little, and you'll surely notice that I mentioned a few other things they ignored. You asked me earlier, "You truly and honestly believe that 9/11 could have been prevented?" I responded in the affirmative. Then you said "Don't tell me there was some sort of way we could have prevented 9/11." What do you want, Mike?!? You ask me a yes or no question, I tell you "yes," and then you tell me not to tell you yes. What is your problem here? I'm not answering the way you want me to answer, obviously, but is there some other problem? Remember the first post you addressed to me? Here's a little quote from it: "I make no attempt to be fair, objective, or open to your ideas. I believe you are fundamentally wrong on almsot every issue, given your previous posts. I seek to convert you, not to form some sort of consensus or compromise." So what are we doing here then, huh? You're not converting me because I'm too well-read on the issues to vote for Bush or any other conservative. I'm not converting you because you outright said that you aren't open to what I have to say. This is becoming more and more clear, though there is a difference between 'not being open to my ideas' and 'shitting all over the facts that I present.' The way you talk to me is the same way Bill O'Reilly talks to his non-conservative guests, only I'm able to complete my statement before you can rush in to obscure it.

 I said: "Why should our tax dollars be sent to fund "The Rush Limbaugh Show"? " Mike said: They don't. HERE'S THE TRUTH: From urlLink indybay.org : "Limbaugh’s radio program is broadcast to American troops via the American Services Network, a taxpayer-funded radio and television broadcasting agency." ------- Mike said: People actually Pay Money to carry [his] show since doing so in turn makes them money. This is how success is measured and rewarded in the USA. I SAY: Not everyone believes that wealth equals success. Mother Teresa wasn't a wealthy woman, per se, but we are now considering her for sainthood. Was she not a success? ------- Mike said: Tax dollars only fund failures. I SAY: In the case of Rush Limbaugh, this is very true. ------- Mike says: If PBS was so valuable to its audience they would be worth advertisers' dollars. I SAY: Advertisers bring bias with them. That's what makes NPR great: There are no advertisers to please. Advertisers only care about ratings; about how many people will hear there ads. With advertisers, stations are pressured to pull in the biggest audience they can, which means providing programming that appeals to the lowest common denominator, which means shows like "Who Wants to Marry My Dad?". You won't find these mindless shows on PBS or NPR. And by the way, PBS and NPR are valuable to its audience. That's why, twice a year, individuals (like me) pledge their support to help fund them. ------- Mike says: Why would it matter if anything is "fair and balanced"? Fox claims it because they ahve shows like Hannity and Colmes. Hannity is conservative and Colmes is liberal. Fox claims to be free of bias, but of course being human they can't be. But they are at least making a try at it. CNN and NPR probably think they aren't biased, but they surely are. And guess which way their dishonest bias shifts? I SAY: If you want the truth about Fox News, buy urlLink Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism . I'm not even going to discuss Fox News as if it were a genuine news source. It's not. Watch this documentary. ------- Mike says: I don't care how biased any "news" source is as long as they are up-front about it. I SAY: That's a shame. So you're just going to give in to growing media consolidation, resulting in more bias, and say "I don't care"? As a media reform activist, and American citizen, this attitude offends me more than you'll ever know. ------- Mike says: The NYT and CNN are certianly not up-front with their liberal bias yet you probably think they are the most objective sources out there. Another fact you can't seem to acknowledge. I SAY: I don't think you never mentioned NYT's and CNN's bias, so how was I supposed to know you needed me to acknowledge this "fact"? But now that you brought it up, I'm going to deny that their biased until you show me proof as to what makes these news sources bias. You love to demand proof out of me, even though you just ignore or disregard any proof that I present (remember our little chat on preventing 9/11?). So now I ask you: Prove to me that CNN and NYT are bias. ------- I said that Limbaugh said: "Playground bullying is good for kids" Mike said: He specifically said that bullies, as a recent study shows, are more assertive and popular. He didn't say it was good for kids, just that bullying has 2 sides. It was in his "light-hearted stack" so it was meant to be humorous. I laughed at it myself. I SAY: If what you say he said is true (which you haven't proven, the way you demanded I prove that Bush said that they had found WMD), then it still is a mean thing to say. As a victim of bullying, I know that there is nothing humorous about it. So, Rush said this was meant to be light-hearted? You yourself laughed at this? That's a kick in the teeth for all I'm concerned. ------- I said that Limbaugh said: Environmentalists are "wacko" Mike said: Whacko environmentalists are whacko. For instance, those that support Kyoto, that say global warming will kill us all, those that would rather save trees/animals than people. Those are whackos. Greenpeace is whacko. Most of these people are really just socialists and anti-capitalists. They wield the environmentalist club to beat down their enemies. I SAY: So Limbaugh DID say this, huh? You're not denying he said it. Now you're just fanning a flag of hatred. I don't even know how to respond to these accusations you've spewed out with no regard to proof or facts. Do you have facts to support your claims here? You demand them out of me, I'll demand them out of you. ------- I said that Limbaugh said: "Corporations that set up phony headquarters in the Caribbean to avoid paying income taxes are doing the right thing" Mike said: A company's actions are never right or wrong. They merely "are." I SAY: So you're not only admitting that Rush did say this, but you're also disagreeing with what he said? Good to hear. ------- I said that Limbaugh said: "A war every 20 years or so would be a good thing so that young Americans of every generation would know what it's like to be victorious" Mike said: What's wrong with this? I SAY: Again, you are saying that these words did come from Rush, so I was not making it up. As for this question of "what's wrong with this," my reason is simple: war is meant to be the last resort. We try to resolve conflict through peaceful means before we go to war. Pearl Harbor was bombed, indicating that the Japanese were not about to listen to reason, so we went to war. Terrorists flew planes into the twin towers, so we went to war against these terrorists. Sadaam did not have anything to with 9/11, nor did he present any clear and imminent threat to America, so going to war in Iraq was uncalled for. ------- I said: "Rush expounds on education, though he never went to college." Mike said: He has experience and accomplishments to back up his advice. I SAY: Such as...? ------- I said: "He [Limbaugh] expounds on the war on drugs, though he has a drug problem and has purchased illegal drugs." Mike said: His opinions on drugs have matured over the years. You can't say for sure if he has committed a crime until he is convicted. But I'm sure a little thing like due process won't stop you. I SAY: You seem to like jumping to conclusions about how I feel about a lot of fundamental American ideas. No, I agree with due process. As for whether or not he's guilty of having a drug problem, lookey here: urlLink Limbaugh admits addiction to pain medication . It mentions in the third paragraph that these painkillers were illegal to buy/own unless prescribed by a licensed physician. What do his medical records show? urlLink Here's a peek . Looks like he was prescribed these painkillers for a while, but when his prescription ran out, he went "doctor shopping" ("trying to find a physician willing to prescribe drugs illegally," as defined by the investigators in the context of this case.) ------- I said: "You don't like the idea of the wealthiest Americans paying taxes to support the poor? Rush Limbaugh has been on welfare." Mike said: Is he on it now? We conservatives judge the success of a government program by how many people no longer need it. I SAY: Then why do "you conservatives" want to cut the funding of welfare programs, or cut them all together? Is it because you don't think people should ever get the aid of this government program? If so, what do you have to say about Limbaugh using it? ------- I said: "NPR is non-partisan; it deserves funding. Rush Limbaugh isn't; he doesn't deserve squat." Mike said: To close us out, what in the world caused you to think that Rush Limbaugh got any government funding? ------- I SAY: urlLink This, for one. ------- Mike said: The closest thing I can think of is that Armed Forces Radio does carry 1 hour of Rush every weekday. I SAY: Exactly. ------- Mike said: They pay him for this the same way they pay for all their programming. They also carry NPR. I SAY: NPR is not partisan. Rush Limbaugh is extremely partisan. Carrying NPR doesn't cancel out the fact that they carry Rush Limbaugh (which, as you've said, is a for-profit, commercial program). A right-wing radio show can't be balanced off with politically neutral programs from NPR. Maybe if they also carried Air America programming, then that would be fair.

 urlLink COLLATERAL / ***1/2 (R) I've always liked Michael Mann products, most notably the movie "Heat" with DeNiro and Pacino (and if memory serves, this is the only movie where they appear on screen at the same time). Mann has some talent, and Miami Vice was no accident. I'm looking forward to this one.

I might pay full price for this one.

 urlLink Kerry's remarks at the UNITY 2004 Conference Stereotypes lurk on both sides of the aisle. Conservatives must be wary of appearing callous and cruel, while Liberals have to be wary of being way too granola and weak on defense. I think any smart politician is aware of this. So what's up with John? I believe I can fight a more effective, more thoughtful, more strategic, more proactive, more sensitive war on terror that reaches out to other nations and brings them to our side and lives up to American values in history. Regardless of what he meant, does he really want to tie the words 'sensitive' and 'war' together in one neat little bundle? Are the American people interested in being 'sensitive' as we try to protect our way of life? Keep talking John. I thought Bush had the monopoly on entertaining speech.

 urlLink Yahoo! News - Bush Misspeak Cites U.S. Readiness to Harm U.S. : Okay, this is just as funny as some of the Kerry stuff. "'Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we. They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we,' Bush said."

 urlLink DRUDGE REPORT 2004? Well, Kerry's fellow war vets are speaking out in a new book, and they aren't painting a good portrait of the Senator. George Bates, an officer in Coastal Division 11, participated in numerous operations with Kerry. In UNFIT FOR COMMAND, Bates recalls a particular patrol with Kerry on the Song Bo De River. He is still "haunted" by the incident: With Kerry in the lead, the boats approached a small hamlet with three or four grass huts. Pigs and chickens were milling around peacefully. As the boats drew closer, the villagers fled. There were no political symbols or flags in evidence in the tiny village. It was obvious to Bates that existing policies, decency, and good sense required the boats to simply move on. Instead, Kerry beached his boat directly in the small settlement. Upon his command, the numerous small animals were slaughtered by heavy-caliber machine guns. Acting more like a pirate than a naval officer, Kerry disembarked and ran around with a Zippo lighter, burning up the entire hamlet. Bates has never forgotten Kerry's actions. You wanna know something? I don't care. I don't care about what happened in Viet Nam, good or bad. I didn't really care about his Silver Star and Purple Heart(s), and I don't care about some questions surrounding said medals. Viet Nam was a long time ago, and it really has little bearing on today's situation. I'm much more interested in what Kerry has done in the Senate, and what he says he will do in Iraq and in the War on Terror. That gives me plenty of ammunition to oppose him. This book, and these questions about Viet Nam will have an impact, but I think the country would be better served to let this drop and focus on TODAY.

 urlLink An Overview of the U.S. Department of Education-- Pg 4 I'm starting a new thread on the Financial Aid issue found below. I looked this up during lunch, and I thought it would be interesting. First, check out urlLink this page titled "What the Department of Education does NOT do". Under the Tenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution: "The powers not delegated to the United States by the constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people." Nothing specific is said about education in the Constitution; therefore it falls outside federal authority. In creating the Department of Education, Congress made clear its intention that the secretary of education and other Department officials be prohibited from exercising "any direction, supervision, or control over the curriculum program of instruction, administration, or personnel of any educational institution, school, or school system." The establishment of schools and colleges, the development of curricula, the setting of requirements for enrollment and graduation -- these are responsibilities handled by the various states and communities, as well as by public and private organizations of all kinds, not by the U.S. Department of Education. Well, that's a relief. At least they acknowledged the Tenth Amendment. However, urlLink here is what they think they are allowed to do. 1. The Department of Education — establishes policies relating to federal financial aid for education, administers distribution of those funds, and monitors their use. 2. The Department of Education— collects data and oversees research on America's schools and disseminates this information to educators and the general public. 3. The Department of Education— identifies the major issues and problems in education and focuses national attention on them. 4. The Department of Education— enforces federal statutes prohibiting discrimination in programs and activities receiving federal funds and ensures equal access to education for every individual. How do these activities differ from the prohibitions acknowledged in the Tenth Amendment? They hand out money, collect data and 'focus attention'. All for urlLink $63 billion per year. $63 billion for an organization that really has no right to exist. Why can't we abolish it? What vital service does it provide that can't be done by the states, where it belongs?

 urlLink The New York Times > International > Europe > The Allies: Europeans Mostly Rally to Kerry, but With Few Illusions : In light of this passage, I have to ask once again - why do we give a crap about what Europe thinks? "'Europeans are surprised to hear that John Kerry is talking about America the same way as George W. Bush does,' the paper said. 'They are amazed that at the Democratic Convention in Boston, he saluted like a soldier, one hand up at his temple. They would prefer not to hear it when Kerry promises that he would never hesitate to use force in case America is under threat. They are disappointed.'" Get that? Europe is disappointed that we would use force when America is under threat. You really want any administration that spends more than two minutes worrying about European concerns expressed as they are here?

 The Village. Diane and I went to see this last night, despite the reviews from Ebert and other places. I decided that my desire and blind hope for a good film outweighed the risk of wasting my money on crap. Unfortunately, Ebert was mostly right. That isn't to say there are some moments of redemption in the movie, but if you added the good together it would make a solid trailer. The rest of the film was mostly forgettable. I found myself thinking about work, the Blog, housework, my own writing and so forth, even during some of the more dramatic moments in the film. The pace was ponderous, the tension flat, and the characters mostly empty. When the Big Reveal comes, I had a Matrix Reloaded moment in miniature. That being said, there were some positives in the film, but not enough positives for me to recommend seeing it. And it pains me to say that, because unlike Mike, I've mostly enjoyed Night's films. I enjoyed William Hurt's character - a man who wanders around the film with a woodenness that is actually appropriate. I liked the formality and stiffness of the dialogue, which certainly gave it an antique feel. We witness one of the most visceral and disturbing stabbings I think I've seen, remarkable for the casualness with which it occurs. And finally, Bryce Dallas Howard, the daughter of Ron Howard, makes what is essentially her debut in a major role, and she's going to be something to watch in the future. Her performance was one of few things that made the film watchable, and I think she's going to be commanding relatively large salary in the future. She has some real acting talent, well beyond the current crop of 'I'm just a pretty face' actresses making the rounds today. It's really a shame that this film suffered from such a weak story when you get right down to it. I've been thinking about it now for a few hours, and it isn't too difficult to come up with a great many improved twists and story arcs from the original material. I don't know much about Night and how he works, but I'm thinking that he should dump the 'Written, Produced and Directed by' trend and bring in some help. He dreamed up some real potential here, but it needed an outside hand to help shape it into something stronger. There was something here at the core, but he didn't bring it to the screen. Too bad. Night doesn't have to be 'the trick ending guy'. I do believe he has a valid claim to Hitchcock, and he should stay with this type of material. But he should also recognize his limits and bring in some fresh perspectives to help restore the meat to his projects. I'll still see his films without hesitation, at least for the near future, but if he strings off another Village, I'll have to put him on my rental list.

 urlLink The New York Times > Washington > Campaign 2004 > Political Points: Finding Biases on the Bus : I know this shouldn't be a surprise to many of you, but I feel like I have to keep pointing this out. Tell me again why I'm supposed to swallow the major media line without doing my own checking? "When asked who would be a better president, the journalists from outside the Beltway picked Mr. Kerry 3 to 1, and the ones from Washington favored him 12 to 1. Those results jibe with previous surveys over the past two decades showing that journalists tend to be Democrats, especially the ones based in Washington. Some surveys have found that more than 80 percent of the Beltway press corps votes Democratic."

 urlLink Walter E. Williams: Socialism is evil : Walt Williams is an undisputable great man (but I'm sure it will be disputed by someone...) Does this sound familiar? "Regardless of the purpose, such behavior [socialism] is immoral. It's a reduced form of slavery. After all, what is the essence of slavery? It's the forceful use of one person to serve the purposes of another person. When Congress, through the tax code, takes the earnings of one person and turns around to give it to another person in the forms of prescription drugs, Social Security, food stamps, farm subsidies or airline bailouts, it is forcibly using one person to serve the purposes of another. ... Some might rejoin that all of this is a result of a democratic process and it's legal. Legality alone is no guide for a moral people. There are many things in this world that have been, or are, legal but clearly immoral. Slavery was legal. Did that make it moral? South Africa's apartheid, Nazi persecution of Jews, and Stalinist and Maoist purges were all legal, but did that make them moral? " Indeed.

 urlLink CNN.com - Poll: No 'bounce' for Kerry so far - Aug 1, 2004 I'm going to try to step out of my partisan mold for just a moment and talk about this. Kerry didn't seem to pick up any convention bounce whatsoever. That's not a partisan statement. It just is. What does this mean? The last time a major party convention failed to generate a bounce was 1972 McGovern convention, which resulted in a 520-17 loss for McGovern in the all important (and rightly so) Electoral College. Now, I don't think for a moment that this election is going to be anything BUT close. We aren't going to see a landslide either way. But I do think this is really a significant problem for Kerry. This was his big chance to introduce himself on his own terms, and it seems to have not had much of an impact. I'm not making a judgment on his speech, just reacting to the polls. Now, if Bush fails to get a bounce, then all it means is the electorate doesn't give a crap about the election this year. Or alternate, you can try to argue that almost every single voter has already decided which way to vote, but the data doesn't support that interpretation. It's going to be an interesting finish.
