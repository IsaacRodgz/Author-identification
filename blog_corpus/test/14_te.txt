 urlLink This story will be around here for awhile. Middle Tennessee State University student Micah Jones was crossing Division Street to get into a cab early Friday when she was struck by Gooch, who did not immediately stop, police said. Jones remained in a coma at Vanderbilt University Medical Center yesterday, an attorney for her family said. &nbsp; Off duty police with twice the legal BAC struck this girl.&nbsp; A tragedy, no doubt.&nbsp; The officer who was driving, Gooch, has obtained perhaps the best representation in the state of Tennessee with criminal defense attorney David Raybin.&nbsp; I'll be watching this one and updating regularly.

 I swear. They have a mountain of good ideas, but are about as urlLink squirrely as a hound dog after a hunting accident. &nbsp; Here's some advice. Screen your candidates.&nbsp; Here's some more advice - stop running for president! &nbsp; We have a local candidate in the Nashville area, over in Wilson County named Heather Scott.&nbsp; She's a county commissioner and she's savvy.&nbsp;&nbsp;She's&nbsp;an&nbsp;excellent representative of the people, and most importantly, she actually holds office !&nbsp; Until local elections are won, the bigger contests will always be futile.&nbsp;&nbsp; Geeze. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

 If you live in Davidson County/ Metro Nashville, early voting starts tomorrow for primaries and local offices. The only one in play that matters, though, is the race for general sessions judge. The Republican, Neil Flit, is well financed and has a sleu of volunteers.&nbsp; In an election that culminates on August 5th, in an election year where everyone is focused on the prize in November, raw turnout will be the key. &nbsp; I was just on Bill Cisco's show on WLAC plugging Neil.&nbsp; If anyone was listening, I hope I wasn't too, too horrible.&nbsp; &nbsp; If I was, I get another chance to make it tomorrow night. Cisco will be broadcasting live from the Statesman's Dinner (the largest Tennessee GOP fundraiser of the year). I will be on the air with Cisco sometime after 9pm plugging for local Republican candidates and the Davidson County Young Republicans. Listen if you can!

 So what.&nbsp; The Hillary card is a little, well, unnecessary.&nbsp; If Kerry is looking for another speaker (besides Al Gore and Al Sharpton) to put a good face on the Democratic party, he's made yet another fatal error. &nbsp; The Democratic Convention, and its speakers, are weighted heavily to the left.&nbsp; Let them continue into the general direction of oblivion, I say.

 Kerry is urlLink pulling ad time in the South, Missouri, and Arizona. I feel neglected, and don't think I'm going to vote for him now.

 Something about urlLink maggots and Michael Moore . Sure doesn't seem like an unlikely combination to me.

 Just wait. With today's news, it's only a matter of time before Kerry and company begin blaming urlLink Big Casino for everything!

 The last day or two have been quite hectic. These things happen, especially to attorneys with limited support staff. Today shouldn't be too bad, though. Registered voter polls - we know how I feel about them - can also be encouraging. Since they lean left, ties are a good thing. LA Times did another one of their polls (who knows, maybe communist monocled monkeys were part of the sample this time) that had Wisconsin tied, and Bush up twelve in Missouri. All a good thing. I'm still trying to get my mind around that huge lead in North Carolina for Bush after the Edwards selection for VP. If that's the way Edwards is going to carry the South for Kerry, we're in fantastic shape. Bring on Arkansas, which seems to be the only competitive southern state (Florida, for those of you who do not know, is not southern).

 Had to do some crack research this morning, so no good blogging. I will be back around after court this afternoon. More quality to follow. I promise. Now off to pursue justice.

 The Second Circuit has urlLink certified the question of the constitutionality of the federal sentencing guidelines to the Supreme Court of the United States. I was unaware that this could be done, as to an extent such certifications could qualify as advisory opinions, and thus unconstitutional. Apparently, the practice used to be more common. A good history of the procedure is discussed by Volokh urlLink here , and further by SCOTUS blog, urlLink here . If the Court will take the certification, an immense amount of confusion and judicial experimentation will have been avoided.

 Volokh has a great stream of posts on what NYC and Boston, among others, did when 9/11 occurred. Elections scheduled on that day were obviously thrown into chaos in New York, but not necessarily so in Boston, etc. Check the site urlLink today .

 Nothing, except that they both happened to catch Dowd's fancy that week.

 I opposed the lottery in Tennessee personally. Not because I have this phobic view on gambling, but because I don't care for the idea of giving the state legislature billions of dollars to spend. Somehow I don't trust them to spend it all on education. Plus, it's a tax on the poor. Go to your local Mapco and see who are the majority of people buying the tickets. But to squabble over the salaries and compensation packages of lottery execs, which are low in view of the size of the operation and what is comparable in the private sector, is innane. State Sen. Steve Cohen, D-Memphis, the chief sponsor of the lottery, said the executives free-loaded off the lottery too long in temporary housing. ''I think these moving expenses are just part of a condition that needs to be reined in,'' he said. ''All the expenses of the lottery need to be examined closely and re-examined. They've not done a good enough job to keep expenses low.'' Right. Because this doesn't matter But the lottery, which started Jan. 20, began 16 days ahead of schedule and kicked off the multistate Powerball game earlier than anyone thought possible, Hill said. Only because every day started early meant a gain in $800,000 to $1,000,000 in revenue. The total in "moving expenses" that Senator Cohen and others are so maturely complaining about totaled $50,000.00. Geeze. Get some perspective. I'm not a fan of the lottery, but the supporters of it have no clue what they're doing. If they're going to get bent out of shape about a conservative gain of $12.8 million for a cost of $50,000, they don't need to be in government. I'm not sure where they should be, or who would hire them, but they shouldn't be in government. In other words, urlLink this justifies urlLink this .

 It's not indicative of future results, but it's urlLink worth a look anyhow. Nothing is really surprising. The most noted contrast between Bush and Kerry in this poll is the perception that the candidate is intelligent. Even in that, for all the liberal slamming, Bush garners a 63% "yes" to the "Is he intelligent?" question. And for some reason, more people think Bush is wealthy than Kerry. Those five percent are perhaps the most oblivious non-ketchup eating people in the nation. Oh, and only eighty percent of the sample were even registered voters. Enjoy with a grain of salt.

 urlLink Tyler Cowen weighs in on urlLink Jacob Levy's proposal to vote libertarian. I take issue with his first point in his analysis. 1. Your vote will not count, no matter what. If the election is close, the courts will decide it. "They" won't let me (or Jacob) decide an election. 2. The most important effect of your vote is on yourself. Over time people come to identify with their previous political commitments. "Digging in" is a much more frequent phenomenon than is "conversion." If you vote libertarian [fill in another other party name here], you will likely become more libertarian over time. 3. So ask yourself whether you wish to become, both publicly and privately, more toward the mainstream or more toward your potential third party vote. Make your decision accordingly. Only because there is already one instance where point number one does not apply: the 2000 election. The electors were already certified, and would have been certified by Florida legislature, regardless. The SCOTUS intervened to stop the bleeding, not decide the election. If the Court had stayed out (which would have been the preferable option), the House would get to decide whether to accept the Bush electors. So, in effect, if you lived anywhere else in the country, you would have gotten two votes. One for president, and one for your congressman who would have decided the election. If you lived in Florida, you got up to three votes. One for president, one for your congressman who would have decided the election, and one for your state legislator who voted to certify the electors. The second two points are completely valid, but the natural scenario is no court involvement whatsoever, even in a close race for president. Of course, races for lesser offices are entirely different, and point one might well apply.

 Now that the former ambassador is well into his delicious meal of crow, it's time we took a look at the whole picture, Plame and all. urlLink Pejmanesque has a great roundup. UPDATE: Out of all the links in the roundup, I thought urlLink Ed Moltzen's the best written.

 The Nashville Predators, on the heels of their most successful season yet, have a urlLink bright future ahead . The Preds farm system is one of the best in the NHL, and with many teams facing a severe amount of red over player salaries, this pipeline of talent could keep Nashville competitive while other teams lose their edge in an effort to balance their ledgers. And to top it off - and this was clear to anyone going to a Preds game last year (especially the playoff games) - Nashville is, in fact, a hockey town. OK. To the NHLPA and the owners. Please, please, please DO NOT STRIKE!

 It's the urlLink Children’s Entrepreneurial Opportunities Academy, Inc. (CEO Academy) . This scholarship program that the Nashville Metro Council is helping fund is a good idea. Encouraging entrepreneurism in our young people is something we don't do enough of. Instilling self-reliance at the most basic level would solve almost all of society's ills. I wonder who the anonymous donor contributing half of the funds is. This kind of program builds values that other programs and scholarships, such as race-based scholarships and sex-based scholarships, do not. I am holding my breath, though - it has not yet been announced whether the CEO Academy has an affirmative action plan or not.

 Just submitted this a moment ago. Kerry / Edwards? To the Editor: President Bush has little to be concerned about with the Kerry / Edwards ticket. There have been various theories advanced as to whether the choice of Edwards will mean anything in the upcoming election. The answer, it seems to be, is a resounding “no.” The latest poll by Newsweek, which was released Saturday after the pick of Edwards, is a testament to this fact. Though a registered voter poll (which, typically makes for a useless poll), the left-leaning sample still does not give the John ticket a statistically significant lead. Further, half of all registered voters don’t vote. The telling number is that the majority of the those who don’t vote think that a majority of those who do vote will vote for President Bush. Senator Edwards, thanks for playing. Nathan Moore Chairman Davidson County Young Republicans chairman@dcyr.org

 urlLink Armadillos are now a force in Middle Tennessee. My first experience with the armadillo was when the began to invade south Georgia many years ago. "Georgia Speedbumps" were their local name. My teenage driving was certainly responsible for curtailing the armadillo population between Bryan and Chatham County. It's only a matter of time before the local Democratic Party starts registered the new residents to vote. Hey, in Davidson County, you don't even need an address to vote - between the median and the passing lane ought to be just fine.

 I hate them. They are useless and should never be done. Registered voters are not likely voters. In fact, half of registered voters don't vote for president, and the further you move down the ballot, the more remote is the possibility that a significant number of registered voters will vote at all. I only rant on this subject because CNN International has been reporting regularly on that silly urlLink Newsweek Registered Voter poll for the last hour or so. I know - that's what I get for watching CNN International . The poll is well within the margin of error of 3 points, and it's slanted left because of the sample. Additionally, it was only done over two days. Too much attention for too little substance. The real story, as Newsweek itself points out, is that the choice of John Edwards has meant nothing to Kerry's chances. Although the John Kerry campaign enjoyed a rush of positive media coverage after announcing that John Edwards would be the Democratic candidate’s running mate, it is still locked in a dead heat with the Republican ticket, according to the first NEWSWEEK poll conducted since Edwards was tapped. And then there is this The survey also found that more voters think President George W. Bush will be re-elected than think Kerry will take the White House. So there. A lot of people who don't vote think that a lot of people who do vote will vote for George W. Bush.

 Isn't it always, really? The U.N., under its inauspicious leader, has kicked off an urlLink AIDS conference in Bangkok (with an 80s song and chess references now running through my head), having the gaul to challenge the world to tackle the problem of HIV and AIDS in Africa. Not because it's not a world problem - it is, but because the man with the least credibility for action on anything is demanding action from those enabling him to have the least credibility for action on anything. The Thai prime minister, as the good host, has announced that Thailand will contribute $5 million over 5 years to the U.N. to fight AIDS. Gee. Wow. AIDS in Thailand is enough of a problem. I'm not sure it's good policy for Thailand to send money out-of-country. All that $5 million is doing is gaining favor with largest network of con-men and thieves in the history of the civilized world. And there is a good argument that most of the UN member countries are far from civilized. The United Nations is one giant RICO violation waiting to happen. The question is whether the US Attorney in the Southern District of New York has the cahoonas to seek an indictment. But here's how the United States, the leader in fighting AIDS worldwide, was treated Organizers criticized a U.S. decision to send a pared-down delegation that forced some researchers to cancel presentations, with delegates saying they believe it was a message that the conference wasn't focused enough on abstinence. The U.S. stance sends "a strange signal" from the largest donor nation to anti-AIDS efforts, conference co-chairman Joep Lange said. "These ideological games are very counterproductive," he said. Ideological games? urlLink $15 billion over five years has been earmarked to fight the world AIDS epidemic. AIDS spreads in the third world precisely because of promiscuity, not despite it. If anyone is playing ideological games, it's the United Nations. They debate purposelessly, and we act decisively. We put out money where our mouth is. They take money out of the mouths of Iraqi children. If AIDS will be defeated, it will be defeated like any other encroaching destructive force on this planet. It will be defeated by the United States. There is certainly a good urlLink national security and economics argument for controlling and rolling back the AIDS epidemic (which I will write more on later). And we are currently doing a lot right now to make sure that urlLink happens . UPDATE: It's quite possible urlLink Bill Gates (who, by the way, is an American) has spent more money fighting AIDs than the rest of the world combined. UPDATE: If it wasn't for the picture, I would have thought I had found Bill Gates urlLink pseudonym .

 urlLink Al Hunt has an article in the Wall Street Journal today. If sycophancy were a kingdom, Mr. Hunt would rule it as a true believer.&nbsp; About the upcoming Democratic convention and the party legacy (pun intended) of Bill Clinton, Hunt espouses the following He moved the Democrats to the center while keeping the party's political base energized and committed. That is manifest in the lack of any controversy at the 44th convention of the world's oldest political party; Democrats have put aside their penchant for fractious--often irrelevant--fights over the platform or party rules. The Clinton agenda is the agenda of Democrats of most every stripe. First of all, the position Hunt stakes out is completely amorphus, which is certainly an appropriate tact to take with his subject.&nbsp; Which agenda is he referring to? Winning at any cost? It seems so Politically, says former Clinton aide and now Congressman Rahm Emanuel, "We're the Vince Lombardi party. Winning is everything." &nbsp; Of course.&nbsp; What a worthwhile agenda.&nbsp;&nbsp;In football, winning is indeed everything. In politics, adults understand the stakes are&nbsp;a little higher.&nbsp; Seeking power for the sole sake of exercising it is a dangerous path to follow.&nbsp;&nbsp;The agenda that Hunt is describing in such glowful terms throughout his piece is&nbsp;that path.&nbsp; It is a path that&nbsp;was empaneled in Clinton's presidency, and was embodied in the effort to ensure his political survival. To be sure, others deserve credit too. As president, Bill Clinton never could have kept Democrats unified without the incalculable assistance of Newt Gingrich and Ken Starr. And John Kerry's ability to transcend the party's customary interest groups and raise unimaginable sums of money would not have been possible without George W. Bush. The current president has unified America--into two distinct and solidly partisan blocs. &nbsp; It's easier to defend the indefensible when you are unprincipled.&nbsp; Principles sometimes&nbsp;require the abandonment of an individual, because any principle worth believing in is larger than any one person.&nbsp; If your goal is power, and the means employed&nbsp; are purely Machiavellian,&nbsp;the only concern&nbsp;is with the vehicle that gets you where you want to be.&nbsp;&nbsp;When your agenda is held together&nbsp;with a&nbsp;hate based adhesive, you have no agenda worth having. The Democrats of today are not the heirs of the previous generations.&nbsp; Democrats today are no more related to FDR or Kennedy than a bullfrog is to an elephant. More unbelievably, Mr. Hunt believes that Bill Clinton strengthened the Democratic Party, allegedly by moving it to the center.&nbsp; Bill Clinton strengthened himself by moving to the center - but he used the members of his party as political bodyguards, all of whom were expected to take a bullet for him.&nbsp; And many bullets did they take.&nbsp; His presidency saw the loss of the House of Representatives, the Senate, the majority of governorships, and a significant number of state legislatures.&nbsp; His vice president lost an election that he should have easily won.&nbsp; Most of his former cabinet members who ran for office were defeated (Bill Richardson being the more significant exception).&nbsp; So, by Al Hunt's twisted logic, the more Democrats lose, the stronger they become.&nbsp; Come back to reality, Al - we're waiting on you.

 Looks like something out of Bladerunner.&nbsp; The protesters in Boston will be confined to a urlLink cage &nbsp;in a specially designated protest zone.&nbsp; People like urlLink this and urlLink this &nbsp; are protesting the protest zone, saying, ostensibly, that the caged zone is compromising their ability to make their point (the AP says they're different people, but they look remarkably the same to me.&nbsp; Who knows - they all look alike).&nbsp; At least it's a mesh fencing, so they can still see.&nbsp; Though drainage seems to be a legitimate issue. UPDATE They are different - here's the urlLink third one.&nbsp; It seems that if you add water, they multiply!

 Check out this email that came in&nbsp;from the urlLink Davidson County Young Republicans website (no editing done) hey guys... was browsing the web...&nbsp; you know&nbsp; keep your enemies close....&nbsp; letting you know my name is kenny&nbsp;and i am working harder than anyone, i mean anyone you have to get bush out of office....&nbsp; he has ruined the airline business's with his allowing oil prices to soar...&nbsp; i was laid off after 19 years of service to a major airline....&nbsp;bush has also ruined our nations standing in the world community as the world's leader.... we are now the most hated&nbsp;nation in the world and most obnoxious ......oh, yea he cut taxes for the wealthest 1% they should be happy...but his brother wont be able to steal this election not this time....i would love to debate more....&nbsp; but im proud to say as an individual&nbsp;i have signed up 310 new voters so far this year all to vote for the next president of the united states of america&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JOHN KERRY.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; good luck in your campaign, only an act of god can win it for you and&nbsp;lets face it&nbsp; even jesus was a democrat...&nbsp; he was a working man and took care of the homeless, the drunks, those with disease and no health care, unlike our president today...&nbsp;&nbsp; happy campaigning&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; kenny defriese &nbsp;&nbsp; So, obviously, Mr. Defriese is in need of some psychological assistance and a few primers on history.&nbsp; But most importantly, this demonstrates what we're up against in this election.&nbsp; The enemy is not Al Qaeda, nor was it Saddam Hussein.&nbsp; The worst possible enemy is George W. Bush.&nbsp; &nbsp; Now for just a little fun.&nbsp; Everyone I know got a tax cut (including Mr. Defriese). The&nbsp;wealthiest 1% must be huge -&nbsp;a lot bigger than I originally thought.&nbsp; Maybe it's just been too hot lately,&nbsp;and the Ford Explorer in my driveway is really a mirage.&nbsp; I actually own a 2004 Escalade, and my a/c isn't about to kick out on me.&nbsp; My house must be twice as big, but as a Republican I'm just not smart enough to find the other half.&nbsp; If I'm in the top 1%, and rich, we all really are in trouble. Hated by who? France? Germany? There's a psychological term for that hatred, which can be metaphorically&nbsp;described as&nbsp;"missile envy". And as a final tidbit, I imagine that nationalized healthcare in Jesus' day would have been, well, interesting at best.&nbsp; I would be all for a national system if the method of treatment consisted solely of miracle healing.&nbsp; Unfortunately, in the 21st century, the era for that method has long since passed.&nbsp; To stress the comparison a little more beyond the absurd, it should be noted that&nbsp;Jesus acted as a private citizen, not as a Roman bureaucrat administering a compulsory healthcare system.&nbsp; Unless Mr. Defriese can prove otherwise, I will continue to hold to my&nbsp; doubts that&nbsp;at any time in His ministry that Jesus was on the Roman payroll. Oh yes - Bush won Florida by 537 votes - 310 just won't be enough. Cheers! UPDATE&nbsp; Further research and commentary, courtesy of my good&nbsp;friend Bob Krumm,&nbsp;has shown that Mr. Defriese lives in Franklin, just south of Nashville, in one of the most Republican areas of the state.&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly, he has further lied.&nbsp; We'll find Osama Bin Laden having&nbsp;cocktails with Ariel Sharon&nbsp;&nbsp;before we'll find&nbsp;310 Democrats in Franklin. It also seems he gave money to what must have been a relative who ran unsuccessfully in the Republican primary against now State Senator Jim Bryson.&nbsp;&nbsp; Interesting. Google is a glorious thing.

 Hmm....wouldn't it be better if we declared war on urlLink genocide &nbsp;in Sudan?

 Apparently, the United States and the United Nations, per the request of Sudan's nondemocratically unelected leadership, are urlLink not to interfere in the internal affairs of Sudan. Two things to address here.&nbsp; First, I think the United States has the capacity to&nbsp;decide whether or not the United States will be involved in Sudan's internal affairs.&nbsp; If the government in Sudan was somewhat legitimate, there may be a leg to stand on.&nbsp; Unfortunately for them, no such leg exists.&nbsp; Indeed, every leg on that bar stool has already been kicked out. Second, the Sudan's efforts to warn the UN away are just silly.&nbsp; Of course you don't have to ask for that.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just ask the urlLink Iraqis .

 According to the urlLink AP, there hasn't yet been any such tension.&nbsp; Geeze. Talk about the most useless of understatements.

 The New York Times, apparently an avid supporter of Linda Ronstadt (who knew?) has decided to urlLink rewrite the First Amendment . Here's the moneyquote of utter ignorance This behavior assumes that Ms. Ronstadt had no right to express a political opinion from the stage. It implies - for some members of the audience at least - that there is a philosophical contract that says an artist must entertain an audience only in the ways that audience sees fit. It argues, in fact, that an artist like Ms. Ronstadt does not have the same rights as everyone else. &nbsp; I know not where to begin.&nbsp; Guess what? Ms. Ronstadt indeed did not have a right to express a political opinion from the stage.&nbsp; In fact, she did not have a constitutional right to even be on that stage. She certainly had a contractual right to be there (weakened somewhat by the fall of Lochner , a constitutional doctrine that the editorial board at the NYT certainly would oppose if they knew what it was), but when she uttered those assinine remarks about the demigod status of Michael Moore she likely violated the terms of her contract, which was to entertain, not offend.&nbsp; Whew.&nbsp; That was just on the first sentence of that excerpt. Second sentence.&nbsp; So, the entertainer had more "rights" than the audience.&nbsp; I'm not sure why, exactly, unless one holds an overinflated view of people who are blessed with well choreographed vocal cords.&nbsp; The wording used is bothersome.&nbsp; If the audience is not entertained in a way they see fit, they are in fact not entertained at all.&nbsp;&nbsp; In short, sentence number two makes as much sense as a barrcuda urlLink attending a G8 Summit protest .&nbsp; Finally, sentence number three. The whopper of them all.&nbsp; What rights do the rest of us have, or more particularly, what rights did that audience have, that Ms. Ronstadt did not?&nbsp; If someone comes into my home, and insults my wife, or my dog, I certainly have a right to not let them sleep in my spare bedroom.&nbsp; In fact, they don't get the futon.&nbsp; They get kicked out (and can stay at that luxurious Family Inn just down the road).&nbsp; What rights have been denied? In fact, private property rights&nbsp;have been&nbsp;vindicated, as are my free speech rights. Why would someone else's free speech rights be superior to mine? If the rights wash out, as they should,&nbsp;you go to the subquestion - is their a private property factor.&nbsp; Then&nbsp;who trumps?&nbsp; The metaphor extends precisely to Ms. Ronstadt's utterly stupid comments, and her breach of her contract with the Aladdin Hotel.&nbsp; The New York Times - always underperforming.

 And I thought I had a decent and sarcastic rant about Bergergate.&nbsp; Check it out urlLink here .

 The answer seems, well, elementary.&nbsp; But Kerry and his surrogates are in fact urlLink blaming Bush .&nbsp; The timing, you know, it's all about the timing.&nbsp; The timing is so political.&nbsp; According to Kerry et al, uber breaches of national security should come without the added bonus of political humiliation.&nbsp; Somehow, the theft (and destruction) of every known copy of a report that is hypercritical of his boss right before a federal commission interviews said boss is of no import.&nbsp; The squelching of the most top secret information for political gain should, well, be brushed under the rug.&nbsp; The carrying around of said documents like spare toilet paper is no big deal.&nbsp; In fact, it was Bush who made Berger do it.&nbsp; A seance at the White House was conducted, I'm sure, to invigorate Sandy Berger's being with the spirit of Lee Atwater, in an attempt to humiliate yet another Massachusetts liberal.&nbsp; It all makes perfect sense in the la la land of Democratic politics where&nbsp;Kerry and Edwards are the new Sonny and Cher.&nbsp; Upon discussing zippergate with a friend last night, the&nbsp;conversation turned to how exactly one "incidentally" or "accidentally" inserts documents in one's pants.&nbsp; The more you think about it, the odder the thought becomes. &nbsp;So a trial experiment was conducted.&nbsp; Documents were on the table, and a&nbsp;trial&nbsp;insertion was&nbsp;successfully attempted.&nbsp; In fairness, it looked damned funny.&nbsp; To imagine the guy who used to have Condoleeza Rice's job do it,&nbsp;though,&nbsp;wasn't funny - it was alarming.&nbsp; And his denials! Plausible deniability from the national security advisor regarding classified documents? Hardly.&nbsp; I'm an attorney.&nbsp; There are certain things you can't claim ignorance on once you achieve a certain level of expertise.&nbsp; For instance, I can never plausibly say I didn't know the law.&nbsp; I should know better.&nbsp; Sandy Berger cannot say he didn't know he wasn't supposed to stuff classified documents in his classified areas.&nbsp; He certainly should know better.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is bigger than anyone thinks.&nbsp; Just stay tuned.

 urlLink Edward Feser over at Tech Central Station has a good article on the uneasy alliance between libertarianism and modern conservatism, and the common classically liberal roots of both.&nbsp; I always find this subject fascinating.&nbsp;&nbsp; Conservatives and libertarians share many things in common, but are subject to a rift over some significant differences.&nbsp; I still predict that the rift will never happen.&nbsp; The one thing conservatives have that libertarians do not is the ability to organize.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's&nbsp;almost as though it's a naturally selecting flaw in their political nature. &nbsp;For that reason alone, libertarians have nowhere to go.&nbsp; The conservative movement will continue to have the libertarian tag-along, and will continue to feel comfortably at home in the Republican Party for the foreseeable future.

 urlLink Jonah Goldberg puts "undecideds"and the like&nbsp;in the proper perspective But as a matter of gross generalization, no segment of voters is less deserving of the high esteem they get from the media and politicians than independents, centrists, moderates, swing voters, undecideds, and others we generally call middle-of-the-roaders. Nicely done.

 The braintrust commonly referred to as Bonnie Raitt makes herself urlLink known .&nbsp; With the utmost courage and resolve, she denounces President George W. Bush in front of a crowd full of... urlLink Swedes .&nbsp; In front of a country the size of North Carolina, she stakes her position, steadfast and unwavering.&nbsp; What courage. What bravado. What a joke. Too bad Swedes don't vote in US presidential elections - the Dems might have had an angle here.

 Kofi Annan has decided that the urlLink world is not safer without Saddam Hussein.&nbsp; Certainly, Annan is not wealthier now that Hussein has been deposed. The rest of the world, however, may be of a different opinion.&nbsp; Of course, it comes down to this Annan, at a news conference, also criticized a Bush administration decision to withhold $34 million from the U.N. Population Fund, saying the agency was saving women's lives. Bush would not support funding for worldwide abortion, therefore the world is not a safer place.&nbsp; Let Kofi Annan point to anything he has done to make the world safer.

 urlLink Spitting at Lance Armstrong.&nbsp; That's what some French are doing as the best cyclist in the history of man enters the home stretch of the Tour de France.&nbsp;&nbsp; Very classy.&nbsp; Very sophisticated.&nbsp; Indeed, not at all simple, when compared to we unidimensional cavemen on the other side of the Atlantic. It's little insignificant things like this that put things in perspective.&nbsp; We are, in all forms, morally and intellectually superior.&nbsp; Not because we're arrogant, but because our nation and the People who rule it have created an atmosphere coducice to progress.&nbsp; Spitting at a cyclist, whose origin, quite frankly, is irrelevant, smacks of pettiness sauted in ignorance (too metaphorical, perhaps?). Ahh, the French.&nbsp; Damn them for having good wine.

 Sympathy is always in short supply.&nbsp; Especially for dolts like urlLink this .&nbsp; The guy wheels out in the path of an oncoming train and flicks it the bird. I know where my money is.

 I love this urlLink quote from Linda Ronstadt:&nbsp; "I want people to get their head up out of their mashed potatoes and learn something about the issues and go and vote. "&nbsp; First of all, people who do read the paper regularly are certainly aware of the Atkins diet and therefore would be eating a steak or perhaps a pile of fried wolf intestines (first animal I thought of), not a plate of carbohydrates!&nbsp; Second, does Ms. Ronstadt really want to harp on someone who enjoys diving head first into a plate of mashed potatoes?&nbsp; Really?&nbsp; I have the sneaking suspicion that Ms. Ronstadt does not shy away from more than her share of spuds-based products. &nbsp;

 A urlLink peculiar story , to be sure.&nbsp; The sources are sketchy, and there is at least one current Iraqi government official calling the reports "stupid," which to me sounds rather odd.&nbsp; It's one thing to avoid comment because you don't anything.&nbsp; It's quite another to strike at the substance of something said as if you knew better.&nbsp; Alas, there wasn't much of a follow-up. If nukes are found, buried under concrete, as reported, Kerry is done.&nbsp; National security will trump all in the mind of the sensible electorate, and Bush will have been right to order the invasion.

 I am saddened by the lack of knowledge that people have about history.&nbsp; A recent study revealed that nearly 40% of Americans in their 20s don't know who our allies were in World War II.&nbsp; I just don't get that.&nbsp; Everything we do today is tied to events of the past.&nbsp; I recently had a conversation with someone who argued that all wars are about money.&nbsp; He mentioned that we went into Vietnam simply because we had loaned the South Vietnamese money and wanted to make sure we got it back.&nbsp; I replied, "OK, how do you explain the Korean War, which, like Vietnam, was fought on the premise of the domino theory and the Truman Doctrine."&nbsp; Here's his response ... and, please, brace yourself: "What was that?&nbsp; I haven't heard of that war."&nbsp; And, the kicker is, he wasn't kidding .&nbsp; I understand that Korea (unfortunately) is the forgotten war, but not being aware of its existence is a bit extreme.&nbsp; He is a high school and college graduate, and simply a citizen of this country (which should be enough reason to know our history), who did not know about a major war of this century.&nbsp; Scary.

 I have an editorial published in The Tennessean today, which you can find urlLink here .&nbsp; I wrote it in response to a mother of an incoming college student who believes students deserve a second chance if they don't meet their lottery scholarship GPA after freshman year.&nbsp; If you would like to read my refutation of that belief, please check it out!

 Though a lot of lawyers are themselves entrepreneurs, sometimes the hustle and&nbsp; bustle of legal work overshadows the structure of the business.&nbsp; urlLink Matthew Homann has compiled five articles by five knowledgable&nbsp;(hence, "five by five") commentators about attorney/entrepreneurs relations.&nbsp; Worth a read. &nbsp;

 Jeff Cornwall certainly urlLink thinks so .&nbsp; The idea of "quickie mart" healthcare has its appeal.&nbsp; A lot of the increase in healthcare costs are from elective treatment.&nbsp; It may be impossible to halt patients who have been conveyed a contractual right by their insurance companies to certain dollar amount of drugs and doctor visits, but the providers can counter this (and increase their profit margin) by providing the same service with less cost.&nbsp; The kiosk concept may alleviate some of the financial strain. As Prof. Cornwall notes, this is something Ben Cunningham, of urlLink Tennessee Rax Revolt , has been advocating.&nbsp; Go Ben! &nbsp;

 I was a little critical of urlLink Bill Hobbs angle on the diminished forecast of revenue loss due to e-commerce in the state of Tennessee a few posts ago.&nbsp; As Bill has noted today, the urlLink Nashville City Paper 's article, which I&nbsp;gave a cursory read to yesterday after noting the misleading headline,&nbsp;really doesn't understand it.&nbsp; I expected more from the City Paper.&nbsp; It is often the only thinking daily in town. So much for intricate understanding of a two-level issue.&nbsp; It'd be nice to at least scratch the surface.&nbsp; The movement and direction of a story is as or more important than the&nbsp;raw&nbsp;facts, especially when those facts are not give the appropriate context.

 urlLink National security "We were all laughing about it," Clinton said about the investigation into Sandy Berger for taking classified terrorism documents from the National Archives. &nbsp; The former president is&nbsp;a&nbsp;hack or a fool, your choice.&nbsp;&nbsp;

 Per urlLink Opinion Journal .&nbsp; &nbsp; urlLink United Press International reports that David Gergen, a former aide to Clinton and other ex-presidents, told the "Today" show that he thinks Berger's action is "more innocent than it looks." It's hard to think of anything that looks less innocent than stuffing documents into his pants. Did Berger tell the 9/11 commissioners he was just glad to see them? &nbsp; James Taranto - nothing less than a brilliant comedic mind (with some good analysis to boot!)

 Sandy Berger, urlLink erstwhile document sock stuffer , has been axed from the Kerry campaign.

 I don't feel bad making these posts because I know that all of you who glaze over that mention of legal intricacy have this handy thing called a "scroll button" on your mouse.&nbsp; &nbsp; Tomorrow I'm slated to argue a post conviction petition in Judge Blackburn's court here in Davidson County.&nbsp; The crux of the argument that my client should be granted&nbsp; a new trial is that the&nbsp; Blakely v. Washington &nbsp;case the SCOTUS decided last month ought to be applied retroactively.&nbsp; I have a good argument for differentiating Blakely from&nbsp; Summerlin (where the Court&nbsp;refused to apply Ring v. Arizona retroactively), and hope for victory tomorrow.&nbsp; If Blakely does not convey a watershed rule in criminal procedure, per Teague v. Lane ,&nbsp;I'm not sure what will. &nbsp; If all fails, and it likely will, I'm on my way to the Tennessee Supreme Court (via the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals, of course).

 Of course not. But that's the story! Check it out on urlLink NRO , without a link to a&nbsp;thorough debunking of such claptrap.

 To show that they are not in fact "girlie men,"&nbsp; Californian Democrats have taken the high road and are adamant about completing the state's budget in time for the end of session.&nbsp; In a call for civility, the Senate leadership vowed to make sure that members of its caucus would work diligently to balance the&nbsp;books and secure funding for government functions&nbsp;through cuts, and&nbsp;without raising taxes. &nbsp; Yeah. And girlie men vote Republican. &nbsp; Here's what urlLink actually happened . &nbsp; "I was a little bit worried about whether Arnold thought he was elected God or elected governor," said Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco, venting the anger of Democrats. "The governor talks to us one day about working together and together we can get this done and then another day going out and insulting our masculinity." &nbsp; Apparently masculinity is easily damaged in San Francisco.&nbsp; More apparently, the&nbsp;doctrinaire&nbsp;Democrat from San Francisco has a rather twisted view on God, somehow surmising that&nbsp;God gets his joys from emasculating his subjects.&nbsp; Lots of messed up things happened in the Old Testament, but I don't believe the complete emasculation of any&nbsp;city state opposing the Jews was one of them.&nbsp; Fire from heaven maybe, trumpets turning walls to dust, sure, but mass castration....eh, don't remember that one from Sunday school. &nbsp; In spirit,&nbsp;&nbsp;Berkeley, the cradle of sane and critical thought,&nbsp;concurs &nbsp; "He is exhibiting signs of severe confusion," said Bruce Cain, a UC Berkeley professor of political science. "He's going down the path of trying to keep the (Republican) Party happy and is squandering an unprecedented opportunity for bipartisanship." &nbsp; &nbsp; Translation: projection of one's own situation onto another - the Democrats are in a tailspin.&nbsp; And in an apt analogy &nbsp; "You can't go kick somebody in the groin and then say let's ... join hands and sing 'Kumbaya,' " Burton said. "It doesn't work that way in life, it doesn't work that way in politics and it doesn't really work that way in the Capitol." &nbsp; Apparently not.&nbsp; But if you kicked a girlie man in the groin, would he notice?&nbsp; Nevertheless, the Speaker Pro Tem from San Francisco was not done&nbsp;showing his displeasure &nbsp; Burton brought to his press conference his espresso machine with a "closed until further notice" sign on it. Burton, who often brought steamed milk for the governor to meetings, said the governor would have to go without the frothy beverage. &nbsp; That'll show him.&nbsp; Senator Burton is not a girlie man because he will no longer provide the governor&nbsp;froth.&nbsp;&nbsp;By the end of the speech, however, froth was no longer scarce &nbsp; "No matter what happens there will be a Democratic majority in the Assembly and the Senate," Burton promised. &nbsp; Billions of dollars are at stake, and the California legislature makes its stand via an inapposite espresso metaphor.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nuts abound out West.&nbsp;&nbsp;But for all of&nbsp;us down South, we know a girlie man when we see it. &nbsp;

 According to urlLink Dems on the ground , Al Gore's Democratic eulogy at the Democratic Convention will be met with sorrow and gnashing of teeth.

 urlLink Brendan Miniter has a good article on OpinionJournal.com about the interplay of politics and intelligence.&nbsp; This puts it all in perspective &nbsp; We like to think of the CIA and FBI as functioning like the military--on the front lines and ready to defend against any manner of barbarian. But given the normal bureaucratic pressures on these agencies, they probably more closely resemble the Department of Motor Vehicles than the U.S. Marine Corps. &nbsp; A good read.

 But the urlLink release of that Filipino truck driver after blackmailing the Phillipine government into withdrawing its troops sets a bad precedent and will result in more death at the&nbsp;hands of the Iraqi insurgency.&nbsp; It's heartless, and I don't want to see any unnecessary death, but if the terrorists had gone ahead and killed the man anyway, the resolve of the other nations in the coalition would have been steeled. &nbsp; Appeasement breeds death and destruction.&nbsp; All the Phillipine government did today is cheapen the life of every member of the Allied force&nbsp;currently in Iraq.&nbsp; Hostage taking now&nbsp;works, and it gets the terrorists what they desire - bloodless capitulation.&nbsp; Now we will see more hostages, and more death.&nbsp; No doubt we will still win the peace, but now at the expense of more dead civilians. &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Well, urlLink Tom Smith over at urlLink The Right Coast takes a stab at it.&nbsp; Let him know what you think.

 urlLink SCOTUS Blog has sources, above and beyond what we can muster, that tell him the Solicitor General is preparing a request for cert from the SCOTUS in light of a circuit split on how Blakely applies to the federal sentencing guidelines. &nbsp; Our sources who litigate these cases and have excellent contacts (you know who you are, and we thank you) tell us that there is an excellent prospect that the Solicitor General will likely take the post-Blakely questions under the Guidelines to the Supreme Court on Wednesday. One or both of two filings are contemplated: a cert. petition in the Seventh Circuit's Booker case (in which Judges Posner and Easterbrook divided); and a petition for cert. before judgment in United States v. Fanfan (a district court decision from the District of Maine that was just appealed by the government to the First Circuit). Both cases involve drug conspiracies. The government will move to expedite both the cert. and merits stages of the cases, seeking: that any response to the petitions be filed within a week, that cert. be granted by August 2, and that merits briefing be completed by mid-September or early-October (under alternative schedules that are being discussed). Argument would be held immediately thereafter. &nbsp; I wouldn't hold my breath for a clear answer (considering that Blakely was to clarify Apprendi , ha).&nbsp; Regardless, the High Court can be clear when they want to be, and are vague when the purpose suits them.&nbsp; The Guidelines do need to be ruled upon&nbsp;- this sort of limbo is unsustainable.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Court was hoping to muddy the waters a bit with Blakely , just to see what solutions and applications the federal district courts and the circuit courts would come up with, they've gotten their wish, and can now proceed to select the best option.&nbsp; It sounds like a quasi-federalist approach to adjudication, which is peculiar, but not necessarily a bad thing.

 Looks like urlLink 35 hours (which is considered a second job in many parts of the developed world) may not be enough &nbsp; Only 2 per cent of Bosch's 820 workers refused to amend their contracts to allow themselves to work 36 hours. Jacques Chirac, the French president, and his centre-right government have been struggling to regain control of a corporate trend that is growing in political importance across continental Europe. &nbsp; The insanity of a nationally mandated work hour limit is coming to a head.&nbsp; In&nbsp;short, the capitalists will no longer stand for it.&nbsp; &nbsp; It is an affront to freedom for&nbsp;a paternalistic government to limit one's ability to work.&nbsp; What benefits a man to lounge about on another's labor? There's only so much wine and cheese a&nbsp;man can consume (theoretically).&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You want to get paid, you have to work.&nbsp; Pretending to be paid and pretending to work can only go so far in a noncommunist system.&nbsp; France may be many things, but with a straight face I cannot quite call it communist.

 Sandy Berger is under urlLink investigation .&nbsp; This should be interesting.&nbsp; I certainly was not a fan of Berger during the Clinton administration, for a variety of reasons, but this seems to be an act of utter stupidity.&nbsp; No doubt there will be details to follow.&nbsp; &nbsp; urlLink Instapundit has a more comprehensive roundup.

 Linda Ronstadt has been urlLink blackballed in Las Vegas for saying something idiotic, "Before singing 'Desperado' for an encore Saturday night, the 58-year-old rocker called Moore a 'great American patriot' and 'someone who is spreading the truth.'" &nbsp; Then, out of the rafters, dressed in an assorted array of super villian costumes, came George W. Bush, John Ashcroft, and Karl Rove, salivating and tearing away at a copy of the First Amendment they keep around for just such an occasion.&nbsp; &nbsp; The horror had just begun. &nbsp; Linda, aghast at actually being confronted for her insanity, begin to speak in tongues unknown to rational beings, crying for her freedom of speech and demanding understanding because, hey, she's on stage, so she's enlightened.&nbsp; At the direction&nbsp;of Bush, Ashcroft and Rove,&nbsp;known nationally as&nbsp;the Triumvirate of Censorship, the crowd responded &nbsp; Ronstadt's comments drew loud boos and some of the 4,500 people in attendance stormed out of the theater. People also tore down concert posters and tossed cocktails into the air. &nbsp; And then the censorship happened &nbsp; &nbsp; Aladdin President Bill Timmins decided Ronstadt had to go — for good. Timmins said he didn't allow Ronstadt back in her luxury suite and she was escorted off the property. &nbsp; Holy Government Oppression, why did this happen?? Doesn't everyone know that every celebrity has&nbsp;a right to have people still pay&nbsp;absurd amounts to watch them perform, even when they&nbsp;say ridiculous and stupid things??&nbsp; Oh, the oppression! The humanity!&nbsp; But the paying public, hey, they're just peons, right? &nbsp; Ronstadt's antics "spoiled a wonderful evening for our guests and we had to do something about it," Timmins said. &nbsp; Guess not.&nbsp; So there you have it.&nbsp; Blackballing at it's finest.&nbsp; Blackballing by the free market.

 It appears the network of individuals that allowed the United Nations to covertly fund Saddam Hussein's government is urlLink still operational &nbsp; Investigators have traced some of these accounts to banks in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and Belarus, where money was either laundered or converted into gold and routed back to Iraq or into other accounts. The network of bankers, front companies, couriers and money-launderers involved in handling Saddam's oil-for-food kickback schemes still appears to be active, investigators say. &nbsp; And then this &nbsp; Investigators found a money trail connected to Saddam's clansmen that flowed through banks in Syria. Some of these same banks, congressional investigators said, also handled the kickback depos- its during the oil-for-food program. &nbsp; So the United Nations has,&nbsp; either through the design of its highest officials or through&nbsp;the establishment of a world record for negligence, funded the terrorist opposition to the new Iraqi government.&nbsp; I believe the Bush doctrine requires the U.N.'s complete destruction.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's just&nbsp;take care of business by sending in the NYPD - I'm sure France wouldn't put up much of&nbsp;a fight.

 I'd like to see voter fraud treated as among the most serious of crimes. In reality, our system of government rests exclusively on fair and open elections.&nbsp; Any activity that compromises that necessity ought be treated harshly.&nbsp; The urlLink Election Law Blog has a link to Florida's approach. &nbsp; Of course, if voter fraud were treated harshly in places like Nashville, the entire local Democratic party would be facing hard time.&nbsp; As an advocate for smart goverment and foresight in planning, I propose the building of new prisons now, to allevate the eventual strain on the system after indictments are handed down.

 There are apparently some rumblings out there that Bush will make blocked federal judges campaign issues.&nbsp; I personally have no problem with that - the obstructionist card was played quite well against us in the 1996 election - but whether it's an effective issue is another matter entirely.&nbsp; In the grand scheme of things, from the economy, to the War on Terror, to government subsidized health care, there is little room and understanding&nbsp;in the electorate for the health of the judiciary. &nbsp; Howard Bashman has the relevant urlLink links . &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Yes, I'm ready to admit it ... I'm addicted to Rasmussen Reports ( urlLink www.rasmussenreports.com ).&nbsp; I need my fix of presidential polling, updated at noon daily!&nbsp; Today's fervent click on the favored link welcomed me with good news.&nbsp; Bush is up by two percentage points over Kerry (47% to 45%), which means the Edwards bump has landed with&nbsp;a thud.&nbsp; And, economic confidence is at its urlLink highest point in six months.&nbsp; I know that polls carry little weight before Labor Day, but these numbers made me feel warm and fuzzy on a Monday morning.&nbsp; Thanks,&nbsp;Rasmussen ... wherever and whoever you are. &nbsp;

 A new voice is entering the realm of MooreThoughts.&nbsp; And, as I am a Moore, I have determined myself to be more than qualified.&nbsp; I am the wife of this blog's wonderful creator, and have held that title for nearly two years now.&nbsp; I will use this forum to share my ideas on education, leftist hypocrisy, individual accountability, and other topics that I hold dear.&nbsp; &nbsp; Before I ask you to entertain my positions, I should introduce myself.&nbsp; I believe I can best do that by explaining my former attributes: &nbsp; 1. I am a former Democrat. &nbsp; I was the Vice-President of my College Democrats (GO TERPS ... FEAR THE TURTLE!).&nbsp; I wore all of the right buttons and had the politically-correct bumper stickers.&nbsp; And, I was a White House intern under Bill Clinton.&nbsp; Well, not literally under him.&nbsp; I was there in the Fall of 1995, in the same intern class as one Monica Lewinsky.&nbsp; Various events, and a general decision to grow up, have altered my outlook for the better.&nbsp; I plan to expand on this evolution in future entries, so hold that baited breath! &nbsp; 2. I am a former public school teacher. &nbsp; I taught high school government and history for several years.&nbsp; My frustration with the teachers' union, the lack of accountability by anyone involved in the process, and the pressure to dumb down classes to meet the dwindling attention spans of our teenagers forced me from the system.&nbsp; I could not participate in a process to which I was so fundamentally opposed.&nbsp; This experience also helped to solidify my transition to the Right. &nbsp; 3. I am former Beltway girl learning to appreciate the "flyover" states. &nbsp; I grew up just outside Washington, D.C. and moved to Nashville two years ago, just after getting married.&nbsp; My appreciation for the "Real America" (which is&nbsp;regularly discussed&nbsp;by my favorite talk radio guy, Glenn Beck) grows every day. &nbsp; I look forward to having this outlet to vent, analyze, question and challenge.&nbsp; I am now a writer by trade, and I appreciate all outlets to further my craft.&nbsp; Stay tuned!

State Sen. Sheila Kuehl said the governor had resorted to "blatant homophobia." &nbsp; Yes. Blatant homophobia.&nbsp; Oh the horror! As if it was homophobia at all.&nbsp; But lastly, the House speaker's thirteen year old daughter was distraught &nbsp; "She's a young girl who knows the governor and really likes him a lot and didn't find the term to be a positive term, and finds it to be derogatory," Nunez said. "It was no question a very, very insensitive comment to make. I personally am not intimidated or threatened by it, but I think it really is beneath Gov. Schwarzenegger." &nbsp; Certainly, having alienated the girly man vote and the thirteen year old female vote, Governor Schwarzeneggar has created an uphill battle for reelection.

 Apparently, e-commerce is not going to drain the coffers of sales tax based tax regimes after all.&nbsp; One of the biggest intellectual&nbsp;supporters of the state income tax in Tennessee, Bill Cox,&nbsp;has urlLink backtracked .&nbsp; &nbsp; The reasons are peculiar, though. The revisions in cost to the state associated&nbsp;with a sales tax regime results from slower than anticipated growth in e-commerce, not admission of an erroneous methodology (which would be preferable).&nbsp; Details are very much needed.&nbsp; Inaccurate growth projections&nbsp;in e-commerce could happen to anyone, as e-commerce is a new phenomenon. I'm not quite as quick to condemn the proponents of a&nbsp;state income&nbsp;tax&nbsp;on the basis of Prof. Fox's revisions as urlLink Bill Hobbs . It's not as if slow growth in e-commerce is a good thing, and certainly not&nbsp;anything that we as free market capitalists should be hanging our hats on to win an argument.&nbsp; My response to lost revenue from e-commerce sales is "who cares?".&nbsp;&nbsp; There are sufficient reasons to oppose a state income tax regardless of this study by Prof. Fox.&nbsp;

 Slate's Fred Kaplan still does not get it &nbsp; The key failure is that Bush said nothing—and has planned nothing—about devising a general international policy toward nonproliferation.

An effective policy must deal with the reasons certain nations want to go nuclear—and the incentives, as well as the punishments, that might deter them from doing so. &nbsp; Once more, it is up to us to search for "root causes,"&nbsp;besides, of course, for the obvious&nbsp;reason why Islamist regimes wish our demise -&nbsp; simply that we exist and we are free.&nbsp;&nbsp; His anaylsis concludes that credible force and negotiation are mutually exclusive concepts, each existing in its own vacuum.&nbsp; This formula is contrary to history and contrary to common sense.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; His quip about Iraqis wanting to leave Iraq means little, save that now, since American involvement, Iraqis are now free to leave Iraq. Prior to the liberation, they could not leave through legal means - they could only escape.&nbsp; Further, such a jab demonstrates a certain lack of perspective.&nbsp; When viewed through the lens of other reconstruction efforts, the postwar recovery in Iraq is moving along rather nicely.&nbsp; Jobs will come as stability takes hold.&nbsp; Taking back the country is beyond the insurgents capability.&nbsp; That stability is just around the corner.&nbsp; &nbsp; Anyone who thinks that the removal of Saddam Hussein, the removal of the Taliban, and the surrender of quantities of loose uranium from Libya does not make the world safer lives in a partisan fantasy world.&nbsp; Mr. Kaplan plays the role of Willy Wonka quite well.

 I tend to brush off most articles on the "culture war" in America because they all tend to say the same thing.&nbsp; urlLink Morris Fiorina has a slightly different twist, looking at the culture war in a more dynamic perspective &nbsp; If swing voters have disappeared, how did the six blue states in which George W. Bush ran most poorly in 2000 all elect Republican governors in 2002 (and how did Arnold Schwarzenegger run away with the 2003 recall in blue California)? If almost all voters have already made up their minds about their 2004 votes, then why did John Kerry surge to a 14-point trial-heat lead when polls offered voters the prospect of a Kerry-McCain ticket? If voter partisanship has hardened into concrete, why do virtually identical majorities in both red and blue states favor divided control of the presidency and Congress, rather than unified control by their party? Finally, and ironically, if voter positions have become so uncompromising, why did a recent CBS story titled "Polarization in America" report that 76% of Republicans, 87% of Democrats and 86% of independents would like to see elected officials compromise more rather than stick to their principles? &nbsp; It's worth a read.

 EJ Dionne urlLink channels Lee Atwater in today's Washington Post.

 I must take issue with the myriad urlLink posts on various blogs and articles by opinion journalists as of late questioning whether or not the Republican base is "shored up." &nbsp; It is. This is why. &nbsp; I concede the initial conservative&nbsp;problem with the Bush administration.&nbsp; It spends money domestically like it's water.&nbsp; I personally dislike Bush's spending, but in the grand geopolitical scheme, it's largely irrelevant.&nbsp; The&nbsp;conservative base of the Republican&nbsp;Party is also the staunchest supporter of Bush's foreign policy, whose importance to that same base&nbsp;dwarfs the excesses of&nbsp;free-wheeling domestic spending (er, triangulation) that Bush has pursued.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throw in significant tax cuts, whose permanence will be a primary point of contention going into November, and the neutralization of the gay marriage issue with the FMA, and the base is, well, content.&nbsp; &nbsp; A better question is whether the rabid shoring up of the liberally insane by the Democratic Party will alienate people not yet convinced that Bush is a minion of Lucifer.

 Poland stays the urlLink course .&nbsp; Germany and France, well, I haven't been able to find anything positive they've been doing.

 The urlLink New York Times makes a stab at defining young conservatism.&nbsp; I do object to the technique, however, of painting neoconservatives as intellectual bastard children of Buckley's original conservative movement.&nbsp; There is a convincing argument that neoconservatism is in fact the rightful heir of Buckley's cause, not an obstacle to it.&nbsp; To attribute ownership of&nbsp;conservatism to the paleoconservative Buchananites is inaccurate, and likely intentional. &nbsp; In all fairness, I hope the Times takes the, well, time, to address the fractuous nature of pos-hippy liberalism.&nbsp; It would make for a much more interesting read, and would shed light on a more severely divided side of the political spectrum.&nbsp; Any ideology that expresses itself through personal hatred is more of a personality cult than a movement, which modern day liberalism and the Democratic party have become.&nbsp; &nbsp; There is no doubt, though, and the article gets it right, that social conservatives and libertarians are of a different ilk.&nbsp; But then again, neither side has anywhere to go.&nbsp; As long as the Libertarian Party remains composed of unelectable kooks, the Republican Party will remain ideologically solvent.&nbsp; Regardless, the Times has created a decent summary, and it is worth a look. &nbsp; &nbsp;

 So much for visiting churches affiliated with the urlLink Presbyterian Church (USA). By the overwhelming vote of 431-62, the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church (USA) recently adopted a resolution calling for a divestment campaign from corporations doing business with Israel. Even more perplexing is that the denomination holds $7 billion in assets in communist China. The money quotes The church is not calling for divestment of its $7 billion portfolio from China, despite China's denial of the most basic political and religious rights and its particularly harsh treatment of followers of Falun Gong. It is not condemning Russia, even though Russia's policies in Chechnya are by any human-rights standard atrocious. It is not even calling for economic sanctions against Syria or Iran, whose human-rights records for their own people are egregious and whose Jewish citizens are denied the basic civil rights and liberties afforded to all Israelis, including its Arab citizens, some of whom even serve in the Knesset. Priorities are beyond misplaced. I hate to say it, but the General Assembly is either extraordinary myopic, ignorant, or anti-semitic. I say just take one's pick - they all arrive at the same place.

 The bounce from the DNC for John John? urlLink 4 points! Kerry’s four-point “bounce” is the smallest in the history of the NEWSWEEK poll. Wow. Could that be any worse? MSNBC attempts to explain it away, of course. I watched the sampling they did with the focus group after the Kerry speech - the bias with the weenie doing the focusing was extraordinary. MSNBC has no shame, though I give Chris Matthews credit for asking some tough questions over the four days. And the kicker - it was a registered voters poll, which always skews Democratic. So it's quite possible that the Johns got zero bounce from the convention. Now, that would be embarrassing. No, this would be embarassing. A likely voter poll done by urlLink Rasmussen Research shows a fall , not a bounce. In short, partisanship aside, the DNC was a bonafide failure. The longest infomercial they're going to get, and no ground is gained. Ouch. UPDATE Zogby sees urlLink no bounce for Johnx2

 I'm not a fan of Bush's urlLink new message on the campaign trail. One example "I'm asking for four more years to make our country safer, to make the economy stronger," Bush said Friday in Springfield, Mo. At least in print, it sounds more like he's pleading than leading. Perhaps the video/audio creates a different impression. I sure hope so.

 For whatever reason, I am watching Day of the Dead on SciFi. One of the dead stiffs, apparently blessed with a supernatural gift of marksmanship, shot one of the good guys, then offered a salute. He pparently felt he had just reported for duty. Am I wrong for this to remind me of John Kerry?

 urlLink Zell Miller's article is subtitled Why I Skipped the Boston Convention . I would got out on a limb and say the Senator was not given the warmest of invitations. I would go even further and say that the DNC leadership was more interested in having Bill O'Reilly wander the convention floor than the senator from Georgia. But in reality, Miller is a Democratic by association, not by belief. He is of the old school, when the South was a one-party region. The Democratic counterparts in the South were never as liberal as those in the North. The political alignment didn't really change until the early 1990s, culminating in the 1994 landslides. Anyhow, Senator Miler is more than welcome in New York. I look forward to his speech.

 Well, barely July. But my hopes for the NHL next year are high. Having lived in Washington for three years, I became a regular Washington Caps fan. To see the team as I knew it liquidate, dissolve, and implode, messily, was disappointing. The future looks a little brighter. Maybe the liquidation and utter collapse was a ploy to get the first draft pick? If so, it urlLink worked .

 There will be a Tennessee Bloggers for Bush blog upcoming soon, which this blog will be a part of. Check back often for launch updates.

 urlLink Blake Wylie investigates the problems inherent in gun control - increases in crime rates. The correlation seems obvious, which is probably why we didn't hear a peep out of the Million Mom March types at the DNC this year. It's a losing issue. It's an issue that largely cost Gore Tennessee in 2000 (in addition to wholesale abandonment of the state years before). We in the South, and elsewhere who understand how to properly use firearms have long understood this. The places where the Dems are going to win anyway, where the populace sees the gun as some mythical orb of destruction, many of whom have never actually touched a real firearm, are never going to understand the issue pragmatically anyhow. So the result? Don't mention it. Ireland has wholesale banned firearms on the island for some time now. The criminal mind, which most assuredly is more intuitive than the progressive liberal mind, has taken notice. Next time you go to Ireland, order a kevlar vest along with your pint of Smithwick's. England has a similar gun policy, and has experienced the expected rise in crime. The all-knowing officials in the UK attempt to explain the rise in crime in terms of low wages, which have created a land of inopportunity. Problem is, the lack of the most efficient method of civilian protection creates an even larger land of opportunity for those who specialize in theft and intimidation. Geeze. Sometimes it hurts the brain to be progressive.

 Interesting site and service that urlLink Jeff Cornwall links to. He discusses the importance of small business valuation and how it's done. Scroll down for some good business tips as well (in light of the premise that we in fact will suffer another terrorist attack at some point).

 Er, a roundup of Vietnam in terms of the DNC, courtesy of urlLink Matthew White .

 It seems that more and more of urlLink Moore's latest propaganda film is made of lies. Apparently, even the news in the movie was fabricated. Next thing you know we'll find out he fabricated the identities of all the grips and technical guys in the credits.

 John Kerry's speech was interesting last night.&nbsp; I wasn't sure what to expect, and was somewhat surprised, both in the content and in the nervous delivery.&nbsp; I've never seen a politician speak over his applause lines like Kerry did last night.&nbsp; It was almost disrespectful&nbsp;to his audience, and certainly was evident to those of us watching at home.&nbsp; The Democrats have attempted to move to the right on issues of national security. How well this new packaging is bought by the American electorate will become more evident in the coming days.&nbsp; The problem is, John Kerry's career in the Senate can always be used to rightfully belittle any claims he makes on being tough when it comes to America's defense.&nbsp; His dovish record is sterling, and is consistent with the stance he took upon coming back from Vietnam, before the recent&nbsp;onset of waffling fever&nbsp;for which there appears to be little chance of recovery.&nbsp; It is only when political expediency demands&nbsp;it that he toughens up his rhetoric.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the only way to see if he means what he says is to elect him president, which is a sociological experiment I'd rather not undertake.&nbsp; I don't have my tax shelters set up and haven't gotten around to getting a work permit in the Caymans yet. And he did a half-Mondale.&nbsp; He did promise to raise taxes, though he said it through the more modern Democratic moniker of "roll back the tax cuts".&nbsp; His caveat, that he only intends to raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans, is rather subjective.&nbsp; What he means is this - once he gets in office, and sees how utterly hopeless the federal budget is, the only prudent thing to do is roll back everyone's tax cuts.&nbsp; The only reason I say this is that we've seen it before, in 1992, where Clinton did a conceptually similar thing, running on tax breaks for the middle class, then reneging when the opportunity to fulfill the promise arose. &nbsp;

 Like urlLink Matthew White , I too have been disappointed with FNC's coverage of the convention.&nbsp; They've been doing exactly the opposite of what I had hoped, and what typically makes them different from the networks, CNN, etc.&nbsp; I found myself watching a lot of C-SPAN - the commentary of the news stations&nbsp;seldom added anything.&nbsp; There was a movement to catch The Daily Show's commentary in our household, which I initially opposed, but then was glad to have been overridden. Jon Stewart has had the best commentary on the convention across the board, bar none.

 The Right Coast has a urlLink take on Francis Fukayama's recent piece in the WSJ.&nbsp; The basic rules of state formation, practically, not theoretically, are discussed.&nbsp; Privatization versus the rule of law - which is more vital? I'll cop out early on this one.&nbsp; The lack of privatization frustrates the rule of law, and vice versa.&nbsp; Privatization can only occur in an atmosphere where property rights are recognized and can be expeditiously enforced.&nbsp; The rule of law is meaningless for society if there is no privatization.&nbsp; The rule of law would be the state, as there are not assets for private actors to operate through.&nbsp; Interesting question, though. More can certainly be written on it. And may be later.

 Pictures like urlLink this make me hot.&nbsp; There shouldn't be an amendment against it, but I can sure despise those foolish enough to do it.&nbsp; How disingenuous must one be to torch the very symbol allowing one the freedom to torch that symbol? What's funny is that the kind of people who do this sort of thing think they're deep, sophisticated, and worldly, which is why when they're done burning the Stars and Stripes,&nbsp;they settle down for talks about&nbsp;philosophy along the lines of "Bush sucks", while they&nbsp;&nbsp;order their coffee in&nbsp;French from an American franchised corporation. Funny. &nbsp;

 The WMD known as racism (kudos to Kucinich) can be found in large supply, ironically, in the urlLink Arab world . At a closed meeting held recently in New York, UN ambassadors from Arab and EU countries met and the Arabs made clear that they do not accept the initiative for the UN General Assembly to condemn anti-Semitism. Imagine Republicans refusing to endorse the same&nbsp;statement about black people.&nbsp; Racism, when found&nbsp;in the politically right places, is apparently OK.

 Some specifics from Governor Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania. $10 billion in tax credits for the production of hybrid vehicles, and tax credits for purchasing them. And then magically, 20% of all energy consumed in the United States will be nonoil related. God forbid the market take care of things. And don't get too excited - that's where the details end.

 If he was any more divisive, he would have a twin. What a joke.&nbsp; He speaks of the ubiquitous straw man - the black man's vote never counts - and then speaks of unity and one America.&nbsp; It is unfortunate that such tripe is considered "leadership" in the Democratic Party. &nbsp;

 According to Dennis Kucinich, we in fact did find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. racism - a weapon of mass destruction poverty-&nbsp; a weapon of mass destruction fear - a weapon of mass destruction According to the Congressman, we must defeat these weapons of mass destruction.&nbsp; Let's see - what did we find in Iraq? The Kurds, who suffered racist attacks from Saddam Hussein (er, hate crimes, in common Democratic parlance)&nbsp;with chemical weapons, have been liberated by the American invasion of&nbsp;Iraq.&nbsp; The people of Iraq, empoverished by the autocratic slave system of Saddam Hussein, have been freed to pursue commerce and employment.&nbsp; Further, no one in Iraq is any longer afraid of being&nbsp;locked in a&nbsp;rape room, shoved into a &nbsp;wood chipper, or being stolen away in the middle of the night by Saddam's Baathist thugs. According to Dennis Kucinich, the liberation of Iraq is nothing less than an unqualified success.

 According to Jesse Jackson, you might as well give up, because you're about to die, no matter where you are.&nbsp; And the Bush double entendres are getting old.&nbsp; More material, please.&nbsp; Try to find Bush looking goofy in a NASA photo-op or something.&nbsp; Eh? John Kerry sees America through a door, not a keyhole? Why are we always in the need of being healed? Who keeps getting hurt? Please make them stop. OK, now he's not making any sense.&nbsp; I think he's confusing himself.&nbsp; But everyone claps at the suggestion that Bush should go back to Texas, and all the troops should be brought home.&nbsp; Is he aware that not even Kerry advocates such a course of action? &nbsp;

 Geraldine Ferraro speaking during the intermission. I like the thought.&nbsp; Let's do&nbsp;1984 all over again...

 "One Minute With the President", a video rivaling only Fahrenheit 9/11 in sheer ridiculousness.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's like consulting Amy Carter about nuclear proliferation.&nbsp; What prompts a national party to parrot their message through a bunch of&nbsp;prepubescents?&nbsp; Very convincing....right. Wyclef Jean, with a frightening though - "If I Was President".&nbsp; And I thought that "President Kerry" sent chills through my spine.&nbsp; Something about being elected on Friday... it's 5 o'clock somewhere, I suppose. What a naive bunch of fools.&nbsp; Sure, it feels good, but would any of it work? The answer to adults is obvious.&nbsp; So far, the children seem to be producing the third day of the DNC. This is truly the party of Clinton.&nbsp; Interns in the Oval Office&nbsp;with interns making policy.

 Despite the pleas and overtures of Obama last night, the DNC is one again back to dividing the electorate among melanin lines. This is just dandy. The party of hypocrisy and black hole quality spin is in fine form. Race doesn't matter, unless by exploiting it we can get votes. If race doesn't matter, as soon-to-be senator Obama noted, the DNC would be a very different place.&nbsp; Instead of touting meaningless diversity,&nbsp;with individuals of color but no substance (and don't you dare take that&nbsp;out of context!),&nbsp;the convention would be presenting a vision of America everyone could buy into, with something worth saying. Unfortunately, the modern Democratic Party is antithetical to substance and overly condascending to race.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, the prime slots of Elijah Cummings, Jesse Jackson, and Al Sharpton, among the most racist individuals in the Democratic Party today.&nbsp; "Hating Bush" is not a winning message.&nbsp; I hope they don't figure that out before it's too late. &nbsp;

 So, only one question remains.&nbsp; Who will win for best "documentary" at the next Academy Awards?&nbsp; Will it be Michael Moore's creatively spliced film or Senator Kerry's urlLink battle recreations ?&nbsp; Acually, since they award little gold men for both short and long "documentaries", maybe they can both take home the prize that I'm sure Hollywood thinks they so richly deserve.&nbsp;

 Howard Dean listed a bunch of states, but didn't let a single primal scream escape from his progressively controlled lips.

 I must say, Barack Obama was impressive.&nbsp; His communicative skills are good.&nbsp; If Bill Clinton has an heir in the party, this is it. Unfortunately, the bulk of his message, which sounded rather Republican at times, is contradicted by his urlLink voting record in the Illinois state legislature.

 urlLink Amy Richards' story of selfish self selection is widely known in the blogosphere at this point, but watching the DNC convention, and thinking of the hypocrisy that urlLink Sarah notes below ,&nbsp;makes me even angrier at the heartlessness of a party that specializes in spinning issues of the heart.&nbsp; And more impatient with those who subscribe to such an immoral outlook.

 The reaction of the delegates to his speech is peculiar, at least to me.&nbsp; They initially seemed schizophrenic about his presence. &nbsp;His positioning of the issue relative to his audience was skillfully&nbsp;done, ie if you agree with this, you are enlightened and humane.&nbsp; The mood was precise and comfortable. I am conflicted on the issues of stem cell experimentation personally.&nbsp; Overall, I think it is a good idea, with some reservation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many thinking individuals are in a similar position.&nbsp; In fact, there are many thinking individuals on all sides of the issue, Ron Reagan's assertions notwithstanding.&nbsp; I am not sure that the DNC crowd is thoughtfully reacting to the pitch.&nbsp; Unfortunately, there's this deep gut feeling I have that they are simply cheering for what they see as another rationale to support abortion.&nbsp; In other words, that an embryo is not a life, no matter what the argument. &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Break out the red nylon running suit, but make sure it matches your mini-van!&nbsp; The Moms for Kerry have asked their members to wear urlLink red every Friday between now and election day in a sign of solidarity for their candidate.&nbsp; Red!&nbsp; I'm sure they don't recognize the humor in that, even while wearing those cute hammer and sickle earrings they found at the mall last weekend.&nbsp; Sheep.

 Wow!&nbsp; That was horrible!&nbsp; Now, I understand why Governor Vilsack's wife couldn't understand the accents of people who don't live in the Midwest.&nbsp; They weren't boring enough for her.&nbsp; I wonder if she could decipher the subtle accents of all of those delegates who were talking amongst themselves during her uninspired monotone.&nbsp; What a poor representative for the great state of Iowa, my former home.&nbsp; She has an accent all her own.

 So, I was watching the convention through RealPlayer on my computer at work today (shh ... don't tell).&nbsp; I was once again enthralled by the incredible hypocrisy of the party's mouthpieces.&nbsp; The interim president of NARAL was telling the delegates that individuals are better equipped to make decisions about their bodies and their lives than the government.&nbsp; Can you think of another topic on which the Left would defer to the individual over the nanny-state government?&nbsp; Hmmm ... hiring policies?&nbsp; Well, no.&nbsp; How about saving for retirement?&nbsp; Nope.&nbsp; People can't be trusted to plan and save.&nbsp; That's insanity!&nbsp; Certainly, at the very least,&nbsp;parents should be able to choose where to send their children to school, since individuals can make their own decisions!!&nbsp; Have I finally found one?&nbsp; Uh, no.&nbsp; Just abortion.&nbsp; It is only when it comes to terminating a pregnancy that the average American is smart enough to make her own decisions.&nbsp;

 I guess Maya Angelou made sense at one time.&nbsp; This is not that time. A lot of things are fitting.&nbsp; And more things about America are shameful, apparently.&nbsp; And who is that woman in the back? Reminds me of the Imperial Guards in the Emperor's throne room in Return of the Jedi . If you want to confuse your audience, "Send her!"

 This is urlLink awesome , and surprisingly, is on CNN's web site.

 Some people are just urlLink bad people .&nbsp; Or maybe just clueless.&nbsp; I would imagine there's some overlap here with that whole butterfly incident a few years ago On the fourth attempt (to capture the tiger), Lee and another officer waited for a tranquilizer team to come to the scene, but when the tiger lunged toward the officers, Lee fired five rounds, according to the report. The cat was dead by the time the team arrived. &nbsp; And the result? Instead of blanket praise that a 26 hour tiger hunt was over, and no people were hurt, the poor guy gets lambasted Following the shooting, the agency received so many angry e-mails and phone calls -- including at least five death threats -- that some employees were urged not to wear their uniforms for a week. &nbsp; Geeze.&nbsp; It's a tiger! A big, dangerous, on the loose, wild animal.&nbsp; I don't care how pretty it is - it would've torn off your head without thinking twice.&nbsp; Who would threaten death over a tiger? Or any animal? Besides, I hear they make good steak.&nbsp; Here's my urlLink email for those wishing to send death threats.

 Girly men are urlLink rather prevalent in the Nashville Metro Council Council members are expected to put the decision back into Mayor Bill Purcell's hands, where it started last November when the Sounds proposed a new stadium to be paid for with $38.5 million in city-issued bonds. Sales tax rebates, property tax and a ground lease with the residential and retail developer were proposed as means to cover the $2.7 million annual payment attached to the bonds. &nbsp; Dare not do anything without the approval of the mayor.&nbsp; What a body of rubber stamping, gutless, hackneyed worms, without a backbone of constituent accountability among them.&nbsp; Regardless of whether the Sounds proposal and the costs associated with it are&nbsp;good or bad for the city, the decision properly belongs to the council, not the mayor.

 and everyone is starting to notice.&nbsp; Consumer confidence reaches a urlLink two-year high .&nbsp; The recovery in 1992 started too late to save Bush #41.&nbsp; This recovery has been marching on&nbsp;for quite some time.&nbsp; Every time Dems spout off about lost jobs, the number keeps getting smaller and smaller. Additionally, John Kerry is no Bill Clinton.

 I thought it all happened in a urlLink galaxy far, far away ...

 A minion just said that "John Kerry has the best environmental record of any presidential candidate in history."&nbsp; Al Gore just can't catch a break.

 I'm searching for answers. I keep torturing myself by watching the pre-convention convention activity, with speakers who would do better&nbsp;making &nbsp;sleep-aid audio cassettes than espousing a political argument. Diana DeGette (CO-D) is especially painful.&nbsp; She likes science, which is good.&nbsp; Too bad no one but the Colorado delegation is paying attention.&nbsp; I am concerned about the elderly woman in the front row. She hasn't moved since last night. Someone please&nbsp;check her pulse.&nbsp; Dr. Dean? Paging Dr. Dean.

 Federalism is bad.&nbsp; Of course, the United States government ought to be funding local police forces. The assault weapons ban is about to lapse. So much for Democratic concern for the Constitution.&nbsp; He's on the attack. Spinning so fast I'm getting dizzy.

 needs to stop. Man, if you don't want your tax cut, give it back .

 I think he just got mad about cuts to midnight basketball.

 How long is the burning question.&nbsp; Tepid cheering for the troops. That was disappointing. Hand it to Clinton - his message is positive.&nbsp; It contrasts starkly with the negative cloud the others have been attempting to avoid, but only by skirting at its outer edges.&nbsp; So far, he's sounding like a Republican.&nbsp; It cannot last. It does not last. Can he recenter the party in one speech? I don't think the rank and file will have it.&nbsp; Here we go - Bush is bad for not ceding sovereignty to the rest of the world.&nbsp; How predictable, and how dangerous.

 I don't like him, but he does make everyone else who's been up there tonight look like a wet cub scout (or brownie, take your pick). So far, he's very honored.&nbsp; Humble is easy when you have nothing left to gain. &nbsp;

 Just on the phone talking with a Republican friend in Boston (yeah, they exist).&nbsp; He's walking home to Cambridge as I type, and there is no one around.&nbsp; The locals have fled ahead of the impending disaster.&nbsp; So much for Democrats helping the economy.

 In all fairness, she probably won't shriek. If I didn't know better, I would think that this was the nomination.&nbsp; Gee, that's a bad rendition of New York State of Mind.&nbsp; Where's Billy when you need him?&nbsp; There you have it&nbsp;- Peter Jennings called her a Democratic rock star. Bill Clinton, the last great Democratic president? As in, there won't be any more? Nice. Uh oh - she's touting her healthcare credentials.&nbsp; Yeah, that turned out well last time.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nationalize that sucker! Or, go to Canada (that's what Bill did).&nbsp; Apparently, Senator Clinton has not yet heard that Theresa Heinz Kerry thinks she and her ilk are "putrid." &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Intro by Glenn Close.&nbsp; I wonder how they'll do it without a pan or mention of Bush, or Rumsfeld, or Giuliani, or Cheney... &nbsp; &nbsp;

 John Edwards apparently has a cold.&nbsp; The delegation is confident he will make a full recovery.

 It's too early to tell, but I'm dying to know what the bump from this will be.&nbsp; I'm praying for 5.

 But we're going to FNC to see what havoc Sean is wreaking on the floor of the convention.

 Didn't Bush raise steel tariffs and take an immense amount of heat from me (among others in the capitalist camp)?&nbsp; Geeze.&nbsp; What's Kerry going to do differently? Once again, that key question goes unanswered. Blowing in the Wind is filling the time.&nbsp; Scary and sad. Fritz got a shot!!!&nbsp; Let the man speak!!!

 Subtitles please.&nbsp; It's hard enough to know what you guys are actually saying when speaking in English (my apologies to Ms. Vilsack). Oh yeah, John Kerry served in Vietnam. This is enouraging. Gloria Feldt, of the organization that urlLink sells these t-shirts , was among one of the first speakers this evening.

 It amazes me that every speaker tonight has attempted to move the Democratic Party to the right on the War on Terror.&nbsp; I'm curious as to whether it will stick.&nbsp; John Kerry will finish the job in Afghanistan? Practically forgotten once we went into Iraq? Does anyone actually believe this crap?? Newsflash, Congressman - we are winning the war.&nbsp; Kerry will not waiver or hem or haw? That'd be a first.&nbsp; Latin America? I thought he was from New Jersey. Too much Espanol.&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn't know that Univision was carrying the convention. &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Hmm...wants&nbsp;a stronger diplomatic corps over a stronger military. Peculiar mode of national defense.&nbsp; Friends standing by us, such as? UK, Poland, Czech Republic?&nbsp;Yes, we truthfully need the French.&nbsp; Geesh.&nbsp; Calling it&nbsp;the "posse" foreign policy.&nbsp; Interesting.&nbsp;

 Unrepentant, she continues to find ways to triple the size of the federal government.&nbsp; Apparently, George W. Bush is holding stem cells hostage.&nbsp; I hope no new Abu Ghraib comes out it - could be disasterous.

 Tammy Baldwin has found a right to affordable healthcare somewhere in the Constitution. I'm waiting on the cite. John Kerry has a plan to reduce insurance premiums. No word yet on details. I await them&nbsp;near the edge of my seat. Too many anecdotes! &nbsp;

 Tammy Baldwin on cue.&nbsp; Let's see what tripe she pipes.

 The intro that Bill Richardson gave Jimmy Carter made me think that a Ronald Reagan tribute was on its way.&nbsp; That's not a Carter anyone, without the assistance of mind&nbsp;reducing substances, can&nbsp;possibly remember. Always an optimist? Seemingly taking credit for pushing policies that ended the Cold War? Lecturing on foreign policy? Heck, lecturing on domestic policy? The 1980 election did not come up. No word on a speech from Mondale anytime soon.

 I believe that Stephanie Tubbs Jones' ego is above to emerge with great fanfair from the top of her head.&nbsp; Should make for good TV.&nbsp; Could this woman be any more full of herself? Shameless, really.&nbsp; She just got done talking about how depressed her congressional district is.&nbsp; Sounds like she should be worried about her job.&nbsp; If she can't get the government to provide free stuff and jobs to her district, perhaps a primary challenge is in order. Now she wants tax cuts...schizophrenic?&nbsp; That was painful.

 Chris Matthews asked a good question to the three female Democratic senators on his show this afternoon.&nbsp; The women kept building up Kerry's military service and how important it is to elect someone who showed for duty and performed heroically as opposed to President Bush, on whom they placed the evader tag.&nbsp; Matthews asked them why this wasn't important when President Bill Clinton, who worked diligently to avoid getting drafted, was running against an undeniable WWII hero.&nbsp; They had no answer.&nbsp; Of course, they didn't.&nbsp; Caught in a web of hypocrisy ... how sad for them. I applaud Kerry's service.&nbsp; But, I have no patience for the short-term memory of these Democrats who did not care about showing up to serve when drafting better fit their presidential profile.

 The economy continues to urlLink boom .

 The wife of Governer Vilsack (am I too much like a twelve-year-old boy if I find his name to be very amusing?) proved once again that the Democrats are accepting and tolerant of all of America's people.&nbsp; She urlLink made fun of the way that blacks, Southerners, New Englanders and New Jerseyians (?) speak.&nbsp;&nbsp; As you&nbsp;will recall, she gave Kerry a boost in the Iowa primary when she gave the eventual nominee her endorsement despite&nbsp;her husband's campaigning for Howard Dean.&nbsp; Now, in reality, I'm not offended&nbsp;by&nbsp;a good-natured ribbing at the expense of&nbsp;our country's varied dialects.&nbsp; However, that didn't sound like what what Mrs. Vilsack was doing.&nbsp;&nbsp;She really seemed to insinuate that the language of&nbsp;other groups was not as refined and easily understood as the&nbsp;superior Iowan accent.&nbsp; This instance brings us back to the repeated double-standard that exists for the two parties.&nbsp; Could Laura Bush vent about not being able to understand African Americans?&nbsp; Or, how about Lynn Cheney making fun of Southerners for talking slowly and with a slur?&nbsp; I don't think so.&nbsp; I must state that, personally, I love the Boston accent.&nbsp; And, since New Jersey's largest export seems to be college students (just check out the&nbsp;enrollments at schools in Maryland, D.C, Pennsylvania, and Delaware), I came to embrace the lilting cadences of the Jersey accent that were prevalent among my dormmates at the University of Maryland.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, Mrs. Vilsack (hee, hee) release yourself from the chains of intolerance and closed-mindedness that are so prevalent yet so underreported in your party and appreciate the melodious cacophony that is American speech.&nbsp; Otherwise, youz will be fixing to make some people angry down at the local bah (translate -- bar).&nbsp; Holla!

 I cannot wait for the Democratic Convention to start tonight!&nbsp; If it is as bad as the painful display they gave us in 2000, I will be a happy girl.&nbsp; I will never forget the round table discussion the brilliant leaders of the donkey party orchestrated at the Staples Center four years ago.&nbsp; Ah, yes, four boring people sitting on a stage discussing dry policy issues in a building that is used to the showmanship of Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant ... a winning concept that can't help but make for great TV.&nbsp; That's the best they could come up for prime time?!&nbsp; That was a media-savvy move that will be difficult to top.&nbsp; Perhaps they could ask Robert Byrd to read the phone book or have local artists recreate the Boston Tea Party through mime and/or balloon animals.&nbsp; Either one would capture the imagination and have me glued to my screen.&nbsp; Actually, I must admit that tonight&nbsp;promises to be quite entertaining ... Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Jimmy Carter, and Al Gore.&nbsp; Please let Al Gore go crazy with his cries of betrayal!&nbsp; Please, oh, please!!

 Sarah and I will be celebrating our anniversary north of the border this weekend (in Montreal). Won't be back until Tuesday. Blogging will be light until then. Hope all is well - if anything exciting happens, I hear the hotel has a high speed Internet connection.

 A cadre of House Democrats, who would be called nothing less than communists in a more direct and less courteous age, have urlLink threatened Fox News with unspecified government action to make them "fair and balanced." Geeze. Dave Huber asks the obvious question, but the Hollywood censorship types are apparently choosing their battles selectively, perhaps even based on ideological preference. No, not perhaps - solely because. OK - so we have concrete evidence that the censorship nuts are unserious. They can now be safely lumped in with the NARAL, NOW, etc. people who didn't say a peep during the womanization themed Clinton years. I'm sure there's some overlap - they'll get along fine.

 If the information coming out about urlLink Senator Shelby of Alabama is true, he should be dealt with accordingly. National security is too important to be played with like this. Note it here Democrats - this Republican will not help circle the wagons when national security is at stake.

 The building next to mine in downtown Nashville as evacuated today in response to a bomb threat. Hadn't heard anything else about it, but 5th Avenue was closed by TPAC and the James K. Polk Tower, as well as Deaderick. My parking is shy of the Polk tower, so I was able to leave without incident. No one seemed overly concerned. I finally got the reason for the street closing and people streaming down the sidewalk from an officer blocking 5th, but could get no more details. If anything else comes up, I will post it here.

 George W. Bush and John Kerry in the urlLink same town in Iowa? Get Shoeless Joe Jackson there and we're ready to play ball. I don't know...could be a coincidence. Surely someone's campaign plan leaked before today - who knows? I have give some thought to it, trying to determine what benefit there would be to either campaign to be in any place at the same time as the opposition - nothing immediately strikes me. They were near each other in Pennsylvania last week, too. Very interesting...

 Great urlLink article by Walter Williams on the condescencing approach that white liberals take when talking to black audiences. Opening my eyes to the way that liberals view blacks (and other minorities, but blacks in particular) -- as helpless victims who are incapable of taking responsibility for their own fates -- was one of the major factors that transformed my political leanings. The preacher tone taken on by Al Gore and others is insulting.

 Agreements have been reached, and another Arena Football team will be playing at the Gaylord Entertainment Center (the GEC) in downtown Nashville. Because of arrangements with the Nashville Predators, they will net more from the deal than the city of Nashville, which has financial obligations in maintaining the arena. The (Silly) Tennessean urlLink laments that Nashville will only make $100,000.00 off the presence of the new Nashville Kats at the GEC. What a shortsighted story. Do the people who write these kinds of things think? The presence of the Kats, though not as significant as a professional hockey team, draw people into the city. These people do not just go the event and leave - they stay and eat, and drink! The economy is positively affected to the tune of a few million. The city makes money off of everything spent. The actual impact of the Kats on the city will no doubt be into seven figures. The same goes for the Predators - the hockey team does not in a real sense cost the city anything. This kind of thinking eludes the critics, who are, it seems, primarily composed of liberals. Unsurprisingly, liberals (otherwise known as Gannett reporters) are not known for their economic acumen, which is peculiar because they tend to enjoy mining and pillaging the local economy for all kinds of ill-conceived socialistic adventures. Surely something would stick.

 urlLink Unfit for Command could be a problem for John Kerry. I haven't heard how many of his former colleages in Vietnam are involved in it, but it's safe to say that if it's more than a couple, there could be some serious ramifications. urlLink Reserve your copy today!

 The date sure jives - allegedly there is an al Qaeda attack planned to coincide with the RNC. At least that's the information that urlLink Newsday has uncovered. The leak was worded as "two months before the election", which would place the attack on the last day of the GOP convention when the President is slated to speak. Eery stuff, but good to know. Any detail is better than none, even if the information turns out to not be as precise we now think. The stepped-up level of alert and increased security will make it difficult for any attack to take place, or in the least, could lessen the impact of the attack relative to original planning. Those who know ask the question "when?", not "if?. There will be another attack - it is up to us to remain vigilant and make it harder for them to kill us.

 I believe the urlLink monkey .

 My good friend, and a solid freedom loving conservative, Bob Krumm, has had an op-ed published in The Tennessean this past Sunday. Check it out urlLink here . The rebuttal is urlLink here . It's exceeded in its silliness only by the naivete of its author Military might alone has never ensured anyone's freedom or safety — otherwise there wouldn't be over 50,000 American names inscribed on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial wall. Is there a logical disconnect here, or a lack of logic altogether? What do the two have to do with one another? I would like for Ms. Secours to tell us all what ensures freedom and safety but the credible threat of force. Diplomacy without military might is pointless. That's why we don't get much sweeping change coming out of places like Luxembourg. Her call for regime change at the end is especially touching. I guess a democratic republic is insufficient for her cliched soundbite needs. Good job, Bob.

 Every now and again I'll Google my own name to see what's out there about me (kind of like a curiosity based reputation credit check). Apparently my urlLink editorial to the Nashville City Paper last month generated a lot of, well, hate. Check the link urlLink here . I've never been accused of being a guru before, but I'll take it.

 John Kerry is referring to Bush supporters as "goons" and his wife compares living under the Bush administration to urlLink being in Hell . That's very presidential. Kerry comes off the tightly scripted convention rederict and look what happens. What happened to being the party of optimism that carries a positive message? I figured that once people actually get to know Kerry, they won't like him. Yesterday's Rasmussen Report, using interviews conducted entirely after Kerry's acceptance speech, found the democratic candidate urlLink losing ground among likely voters. Meanhile, urlLink factory production is soaring. I think that Bush needs to drop the "turning the corner" slogan because it doesn't really inspire confidence, but he is right.

 Glenn Reynolds makes an excellent point in his urlLink latest post . The age is irrelevant in light of the MO of the organization. We now know that the 9/11 plan took years to assemble. Finding documents a few years old might actually be completely on point.

 urlLink Good news out of Iraq. It's underpublicized for a reason.

 Eliot Spitzer, the self-inflated attorney general of New York, has warned the GOP not to feature 9/11 at all during its convention at the end of this month. In fact, he forbids the GOP from using it... "It would not be fair or right," the attorney general continued. "And we will not let you do it." Why it's not fair or right is not quite clear. Mr. Spitzer cites inadequacies in the 9/11 Commission's report. However, it is not evident why a flawed system should undermine the accomplishments and leadership of those who guided us through those dark days. I will go out on a limb here. I posit that Spitzer's problems are partisan. He is distraught that everyone, from the mayor and governor of New York, to the president and secretary of defense, were Republicans on that day. Consequently, any Democrats on the scene had to fall in line and at least pretend they were interested in the security of the United States for a few short months. Now that time has passed. Democrats can pretend, as they delve deeper into the world of fantasy politics, that they are more concerned with security than George W. Bush. Rudolph Guiliani said it best "The Democrats haven't been careful, or stopped from talking about September 11 (and) the President's reaction to it ... It seems to me you can't have it both ways," said Giuliani, who was dispatched to Boston on the final day of the Democratic National Convention to be part of a response team of Republicans who countered Democratic criticism. Dispatched only to keep the Dems from seizing onto something they hadn't lifted a finger to claim until political expediency demanded it. The paranoia continues Democrats have long maintained that the Republicans picked Democrat-dominated Manhattan for their convention -- the first time it will ever be held there -- to capitalize on 9/11 and remind voters of a time when Bush's poll numbers were high. They worried the rebuilding of the twin towers was being delayed to allow Bush to be present for the groundbreaking. Are they that insecure, or do they really have that little to offer? The question is irrelevant because the answer is the same. Is it somehow dishonest to point to real leadership, or is it more a partisan disgust for losing the 2000 election that has the Dems so on edge? I vote for both. Since the groundbreaking was done on July 4, 2004, the Dems have nothing to worry about but the further emphasis on substance. I am sure they will find some way to spin this as "unfair". Once again, the proof shows that one party is serious, and one can't escape the failed legacy of its last White House occupant. Politics ought never come before national security, unless of course it is used to destroy George W. Bush.

 All due respect to Cher, but John Kerry is attempted to commandeer her sentiments for use in his foreign policy Kerry repeated his argument that the Bush administration is encouraging the recruitment of terrorists. He said Bush hasn't reached out to other countries and the Muslim community. So, what they need is more hugs. Huh. Funny that no one living in the real world thinks that. Kerry further elucidates Kerry says he does not regret his vote for the war resolution, but he regrets that Bush "rushed to war" without support from more allies and without a plan to win the peace. The Kerry campaign said the president's statement was misleading. Ah yes, the long heard, yet solely mythical "rush to war". Need we go over this again and again? A nonexhaustive list of allies, in no particular order United Kingdom Poland Czech Republic Italy Spain (until it voted Democratic) Phillipines (until it voted Democratic) El Salvador Latvia No one there, of course. Well, no one there who Saddam owed money to prior to the war, anyhow. And then there is the ridiculous anti-Bush slant slathered all over this AP "story". Two examples Bush challenged Kerry, who voted to give him the authority to send troops to Iraq, to agree with him publicly that ousting Saddam Hussein was the right course of action. However, Kerry has repeatedly said that ousting Saddam was right. Except for when he didn't. Then there's this On the day that Bush announced he would create a national intelligence czar and counterterrorism center to help prevent another terrorist attack, Kerry said the self-described "war president" was not acting fast enough to protect Americans. Kerry's quote or the reporter's quote? They report - they decide.

 As if the attacks in Madrid and Bali weren't evidence enough, London is now officially in urlLink al Qaeda's sights BRITAIN’S security forces were yesterday put on "heightened readiness" for a potential terrorist attack , after detailed al-Qaeda plans to attack UK targets were uncovered. Appeasement works oh so well. Let the world take notice that all freedom loving countries, are, by the very raison d'etre of al Qaeda, to be destroyed. This was our 500th post. If you like what we're doing, send us an urlLink email .

 Sounds good to me. The Titans are looking fantastic. SI gives good props urlLink here . This is the best part "Hopefully we can split things, but I know it's Chris's job at this point," [Antowain] Smith said Sunday. "My role is to come here and help him out, give him a break when he gets tired. I'm here to give him a little advice and encourage him." Pretty good attitude for a guy with a pair of Super Bowl rings on his hand. Shouldn't every team be clamoring for a guy like that?? No Keyshawns on our team, that's for sure. Robaire Smith start cocking a little attitude, and the coaching staff, and more appropriately, the team, came down on him. Let's rock 'em in the AFC South!

 In light of recent polling data, urlLink let not your hearts be troubled In 1988, the Gallup polls showed that Michael Dukakis was ahead of GHW Bush from late April until early August and at one time the lead was 17 points. GHWB Bush took the lead over Dukakis all the way from mid August till November election. However the Gallup polls were showing a close race between Dukakis and GHW Bush where Bush was leading by few points until Mid October were Gallup showed a commanding lead of GHW Bush over Dukakis all the way to his victory on Election Day. This time there's a better Bush, and a taller Dukakis. All looks rosy ahead.

 Kerry's national security credentials seem to end somewhere between his returning to his homeland and denouncing the service he now proudly touts, and select words used last week in the most controlled setting. Neither end nor the immense amount of time in between has resulted in a John Kerry who understands foreign policy or national security. His urlLink response to the latest terror warning proves just that. At least Bill Clinton was calculated and selfish - Kerry just seems negligent. Politics used to stop at the waters' edge - with John Kerry, it never stops.

 When the senate refuses to function, urlLink skip it . Now lets see some more judges, Mr. President.

 After the attacks of 9/11, we are urlLink reminded that tall buildings are threatened.

 urlLink Little Green Footballs had awhile back put together a slideshow from 9/11. Go look at all the pics (something like 59 of them, I think). Sometimes anger is useful, a tool to retain resolve and focus. In the case of 9/11, we must do so for the rest of our lives. It is a requirement for anyone at all concerned with humanity from time to time to reinvigorate and tap into that anger.

 Seems that many urlLink in the blogosphere have taken umbrage with Kerry's repudiation of the Bush Doctrine's requirement of selective preemptive strikes. If it's been explained once, it's been explained a thousand times - nowadays war is not always conventional. There will be no marches on Washington - only Ryder trucks parked on Constitution Avenue with God knows what surprises waiting to detonate. Knowing the risks as Kerry certainly does, if we are to believe he garnered anything worthwhile from his Cold Warrior experience, and refusing to intervene anywhere preemptively is the basic tenet of a postmortem philosophy of modern nation-state survival. If that's our tactic, we're dead on our feet. Action only after a nuclear strike or a biological attack is a clear indicator of insanity, and holding true to that tact is a sure sign of unfitness to lead this country. John Kerry's inability to comprehend this is alarming. Preemptive strikes are not a sign of a man who "wants to go to war", contrary to the most hackneyed Democratic argument spouted ad nauseum at the DNC. They are instead a sign of a man comfortable with reality as it presents itself, who understands that only decisive action save lives. We have no time for a nuanced foreign policy as viewed through a gray hued lense. The luxury of negligence so prevalent in the security policies of this nation in the 1990s created the conditions that made 9/11 possible. John Kerry wants to return to this time - he wants a return to 9/10. Kerry makes fun of the administration's lack of understanding of science. He in fact ended his speech on this point. Someone needs to tell John Kerry to get a grip - that time travel is not possible, and his senate voting record does matter. National security is not a game to the Republican Party, but it is to the Democrats. I pray that the opposition party does not keep this a secret, and that the Bush campaign reveals this stark and vital difference at every opportunity.

 An eery thought, to be sure, but urlLink central to the Daschle reelection campaign against John Thune. Not only that, but into an attempt to preserve what's left of his soul, Daschle is urlLink refusing the lens himself.

 The latest likely voter poll from urlLink CNN/Gallup/USA Today (not exactly bastions of Republican sympathizers) shows absolutely no bounce for the Kerry/Edwards ticket. In the survey, taken Friday and Saturday, the Democratic ticket of Kerry and John Edwards trailed the Republican ticket of Bush and Dick Cheney 50% to 46% among likely voters, with independent candidate Ralph Nader at 2%. Before the convention, the two were essentially tied, with Kerry at 47%, Bush at 46%. I thought the convention was bad, but I didn't think it would be destructive. And the follow-up analysis But it was nonetheless a stunning result, the first time in the Gallup Poll since the 1972 Democratic convention that a candidate seemed to lose ground at his convention. A McGovernite result sounds good to me.

 The new budget in California has been lampooned by the urlLink Associated Press . Democrats are complaining about being blocked in, and that is supposed to be a bad thing. The urlLink LA Times has a similar, if not harsher, take on the budget situation. But buried in the details of the article is this nice morsel The budget Schwarzenegger signed is balanced with at least $15.6 billion of borrowing. The biggest chunk of that is $11.2 billion from the deficit bond package voters approved in March. The rest will come in several billion dollars of IOUs to various programs and a $920-million loan to make the payment into the pension fund for state workers. First, just blame the people for the bond issue. Sure, the pain is delayed, but it will eventually have to be dealt with. To hear the governor talk about the budget, the intention is to cut state government over the duration of his term. This year's budget is indeed a quick fix. However, the IOU's to "various programs" amount to $3.5 billion. This money need never be paid. You cannot owe yourself money, contrary to the most concerted spin. Point is, California didn't raise taxes - a showdown is brewing. Schwarzeneggar has purposely set up a future budget collision. Neither the Democrats nor the Republicans are happy with the budget this year. Watch California closely - this may yet be the beginning of a brilliant political stroke by the governor.
