 Or in my case, sprawled out horizontally with one dog's ass in my face. This is what happens when I have no Benadryl, vodka or Ambien lying around (thanks, V, but you don't need sleep - you're on vacation): I woke up at least four times during the night, and rolled out of bed at five a.m. Given the amount of alcohol I consume during any particular week, don't even think of suggesting Tylenol PM. Who the fuck gets up at five in the morning? Not me, not most days. I FEEL AS THOUGH SOMETHING'S MISSING And I don't know what it is. Maybe if I had urlLink this outfit , I would feel better about my life. Or maybe I'd just take a handful of Ambien with a fifth of Jack and call it a night. FRIDAY , NOT CELLAR DOOR , IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WORD IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE I don't care what that famous linguist said. It's finally here. How fucked up is this? For the Fourth of July holiday, my day off is next Friday ? WTF? I need the day off to be that following Monday, as I'll be nursing the All-American Hangover From Hell. BUNNY BETTER FEEL UP FOR COFFEE Already I am yawning. This is gonna be one a hell of a long-ass day. Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 Sorry, guys! Just a little too much information before... UPDATE It is now not letting me post comments. In reply to Bun, YES, it was a rather good idea. Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 He called to tell me that he was staring at a model. I didn't bite. The urlLink Bay Model in San Francisco. Vicente also told me I lunge at everyone. Well, shit yes , that's how we hooked up. And that is why I limit myself from exposure to Unsafe Drinking Situations . VICENTE DOESN'T HAVE TO GO TO NYC NEXT WEEK! Which means I get to see him before the offspring arrives. Yea. I told him I would model my new shoes for him...naked. Oh, wait, I'll be wearing the new mascara, too (of COURSE). IF MY ROOTS WERE FROM A TREE, THERE WOULD BE A FUCKING REDWOOD ON MY HEAD Bad, people. Very, very bad. I'm so Trailer Park right now it isn't even funny. Just throw in a lawn jockey, add my cigarette "garden" out back, toss with a few pink flamingos and we're set. "Go getcher momma a beer ...and some lotto tickets ." PLEASE, GOD, LET PADDY MAC BRING HOME MORE ALCOHOL I don't think anything else really needs to be said. BUNNY, WHERE ARE YOU AND WHY ARE YOU IGNORING MY PHONE CALLS? Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 Thanks, Walt, for a delicious lunch! I'll post about the Rubberband Man later... Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 I cannot wait for delivery of my Dior mascara. I'm wearing the sample today and it's so wonderful, it's like steaming hot sex for your eyes. My search has ended. I am victorious! Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 In fine Dedication Wednesday tradition, the title of this post is offered up to Bunny. PISSER HAS BEEN POSTING MORE OFTEN LATELY Pisser must be bored at work. Or just feeling a little more verbose these days. WHATEVER THE REASON, I am thankful. No one makes me laugh more than that bitch does. And she's fucking HOT on top of it! I HAVE A BAG FULL OF SHOES IN THE OTHER ROOM I discarded all boxes and decided it would be easier to transport new shoes in one bag. Sometimes, I dream that bags of new shoes and purses fall from the sky, and I know that God loves me, because he sends me SHOES. SHOES should be in all caps, just like CHEESE. BOW TO THE CHEESE Just don't fucking touch any of mine, ya hear? SHOPPING GALORE! And the only fun trip was for SHOES. I went to Target today, bought a shitload of cleaning supplies to try and force myself back into Clean Mode . That ended about 3.5 years ago, when Paddy Mac moved in. I'm working on a system. I'll get back to you on how that (doesn't) work. Then to Tom Thumb. I bought all kinds of fresh fruit and veggies that will inevitably rot in my refrigerator and then I'll get this hankering for them and discover I have a shitload of penicillin in my fridge. Gonorrhea anyone? YOU DON'T SEE ADS NOWADAYS IN WHICH PEOPLE RECALL, FONDLY, IMPORTANT CIGARETTE MOMENTS IN THEIR LIFE.

 I just bought four pairs of shoes at lunch. And a cute, tiny purse with shopping charms on it for my best friend, Mary/Lisa. I must not take lunch. I must not take lunch. I must not take lunch. I must not take lunch. I must not take lunch. I must not take lunch. Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 "The floor doesn't make sense." That was on a voicemail I got last night. Giggle Chick has me nervous, so I'm revising posts again. My Urban Decay Skyscraper Mascara in Gotham came in yesterday. So I got to wear the L'Oreal Lash Architect for all of one day (unless UDSM sucks, but then I have a Dior sample to try, too). I am going to continue to examine more lash choices until I find the perfect one. Buzzy's new nickname is Bonky. This should keep you straight when I am referring to the babies because, no, I did not get another dog. Not yet . I did get a new hutch last night. My parents found it marked 50% off and now I have one more place to pile shit I don't want to pick up and/or go through. Good luck to Bunny. She'll know what I mean. Well, kids, I'm off to see the Wizard. Wouldn't it be nice if I were really going to the Land of Oz? Instead, I am off to work. (Those flying monkeys always scared me. They still do.) Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 I swear, I heard at least three "Arrrr"s in that last post. Sadie has stage fright. Buzzy is just confused. Nico, however, is my Sparky Jr. - my little hambone. He'll act up anytime you want. And even when you don't. WHAT THE FUCK IS UP WITH HALOSCAN RIGHT NOW? Lots of sighs at work this afternoon. Tried my best to ignore it all, since I'M UP TO MY ASSHOLE AND HIGHER IN PROJECTS. Synchronized my computer clock with my cell phone clock since my cell phone also serves as my time-piece. I kept looking at it ( five o'clock, five o'clock, five o'clock was my mantra since I came in early AGAIN and worked my way through lunch, and since I'm salaried and figure 8.5 hours is enough soul they can steal from me today) but then I didn't freakin' leave work until after six-thirty. I think I will arm myself with a water pistol tomorrow and squirt people when they piss me off. I HATE HOUSEWORK I came up with this plan to break my goal of having a clean house that wasn't cleaned by someone else but by me down into reachable goals (as our executive coach would instruct me to do). See, I do one room each day, then quit, and soon my house will be SPARKLE MOTION . In the year 2077 (in the Tangent Universe, that is). But I'm working on it. PISSER IS THE FUNNIEST FEMALE I HAVE YET TO ENCOUNTER (ON-SCREEN AND WELL, OFF-SCREEN, AND THEN ON-SCREEN HERE ) I'm thinking of turning lesbian after I saw The Photo again. (the first one, not the second one - which looks slightly like a Captain Morgan's ad - "Put a little Captain in yeh!") And Pisser, I do NOT believe that's accurate. You're too cute to have moles with hairs growing out of them. SOMEBODY STOP ME I need to highlight my hair tonight and I've already had a vodka cocktail. I could either turn out (a) looking lovely or (b) scaring my dogs. Fuck it! I'll take my chances! I JUST SCARED THE SHIT OUT OF MYSELF! I walked into the bathroom and my hair had this horrific Dairy Queen Head thing going on. (I think I'll style it this way for work tomorrow.) Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 It appears as though Bunny and I made TWO enemies last night! Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 It feels like Monday all over again. Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 No, not really. I'm not really down, I'm not really out. Not out of it yet. Just a long-ass day and an early one at that. Then, as I'm paying for Nico's shots at the vet's office, I look down and see a medical history folder. I'm assuming it's the poor old soul who I missed (thank God) going back to be put down. His name is Sparky. Christ, that tore my mother up more than it did me. I don't know why, except that lately I've been thinking how miserable he must have been that last year. Just don't let me near a copy of The Rainbow Bridge or I'll have a fucking breakdown. ALL IS WELL IN THE WORLD OF POULTRY Got to talk to Vicente today, who had the best Father's Day with his son. Now he is off to vacation at Yosemite (that bastard) and then back to NYC to misbehave while on business (rat bastard). I'm stuck here in the hood, wondering what exciting things I can cook up for this weekend. I might even leave the house again (see, Bun? I do actually get out sometimes) SPEAKING OF COMMERCIALS, PISSER I like the United Health Care commercial where people "don't always use common sense." ESPECIALLY the one where those women go diving for the bridal bouquet and fall into the ocean. Heh heh. Serves them right. I always let it fall to the floor if someone has the audacity to actually make me stand up in that crowd. MARRIAGE? NO THANKS, I'D RATHER PUT MY RIGHT HAND IN THIS RUSTY KITCHEN MEAT GRINDER, THANK YOU. You get married to my second ex, you won't worry about the afterlife. Hell can't be much worse. NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I'm gonna go watch "Matlock." Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 I've always heard it said that alcohol is a truth serum of sorts. That cannot be said about me. When I am drunk... ...I think everyone is cute, especially me ...I become more fascinating in my own head than I am in reality ...I will tell you bold-faced lies and make up stories just to fuck with you (ask Vicente) ...I'll fall into flower beds and think it's funny ...I'll kiss you but it won't mean anything (ask a lot of people) ...I'll confess things that never really happened ...I'll probably act up, but it won't mean anything, either Keep this in mind - you can't believe a goddamned thing I say when I am drunk - most certainly "I love you" or "Wanna fuck?"

 My favorite day of the week (sigh). Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 Went swimming with Bunny and Monketo last night. Pouring that Skyy into my mango snowcone was a slight mistake. Especially after eating that bean dip and those huge M&Ms. What was I thinking? I don't think I was. Giggle Chick has scared me into deleting several posts from this past week. Sorry, Bun, but I'm a Chicken shit. LAUNDRY STILL UNDONE But I'm doing it now. Full-blown headache from the Mango Surprise last night still lingering behind my right eye. I am craving a pizza (now that I am no longer urping - sorry Bunny, about the sick bag incident in your car) and I don't feel like getting dressed so I'm gonna call Mr. Jim's. If you can't eat pizza from NYC, Mr. Jim's is the next best thing. They make the best thin crust cheese pizza, period. At least around here they do. CHEESE PIZZA Those two little words that mean so much to this girl. MYSOGYNISTIC BASTARDS This is for that shit who followed urlLink Dianarchy around, and anyone else out there like him. Fucking pigs . TO FAB D: SORRY FOR NOT GOING LAST NIGHT - I JUST REALLY WANTED TO SWIM I wish you would have joined us. I didn't even wear a swimsuit. (No, it was not that kind of party. I wore my cheerleading shorts and a nongirlfriend t-shirt. Pervs.) TO DO I hate fucking "to do" lists. They are counter-productive since I don't usually end up completing all the items on them, and then I feel like shit for being such a slacker that I watched "Caddyshack" and blogged instead of folding towels and cleaning my bathroom. 1) Buy more Tide 2) Buy more dog treats (again) - and I wonder why my babies are slightly, er, "chunky"? 3) Write long overdue thank you note 4) Eat pizza 5) Try not to throw up pizza 6) Watch another mindless movie 7) Better yet, read a mindless magazine while watching a mindless movie 8) Stay away from Sephora 9) Pay my water bill 10) Make headache go away 11) Play with the babies, who are pouting in the other room 12) Cry, because it feels like someone drove a nail through my head 13) Clean kitchen and fold those goddamned towels 14) Miss Vicente 15) REALLY miss Vicente Fuckitall, I think I'll just go take a nap.

 Just how many times did urlLink Hot Abercrombie Chick register herself on Blog Snob ? Why is it that every time I come in here to obsessively check for comments , she's there? Yeah, she's hot . She's also like 19 and obsessed with beheading. I really, truly do NOT want to read about Iraq anymore. And I don't want to be serious in here, because I have to do that far too often in my "real life." AND BY THE WAY, DON'T CALL ME "STUPID" I am not. Nor am I ignorant (either by accident or on purpose, even though I didn't know what "Chola" was, but I'm not into Street Speak). I simply do not care to fill my head with horrifying current events. I prefer the shiny, happy ones where the dog gets rescued, the man wins the lottery before declaring bankruptcy and the long-lost couple are reuinted. I'm depressed enough as it is with what really happens. So I'm going to keep my blogging to: makeup, shoes, clothes, hair, boys, fun, alcohol and my lovely Min Pins. I'll leave the serious stuff to urlLink Hot Abercrombie Chick Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 THINGS I HAVE NOTICED ABOUT BLOGGERS (Myself Included) 1) We are addicted to it, often checking for comments several times a day. 2) We like to see pictures of ourselves up, even bad ones, like Leif's (that fake picture, not the real one - he is actually quite the smokin' one). 3) We give ourselves nicknames. I used to believe it was for anonymity, but now I believe they are sort of lovey-dovey pet names for ourselves. Chicken came from Vicente, though. 4) We will review anything: movies, restaurants, makeup, shoes, clothes, bars, shoes, makeup, perfume, shoes, makeup, makeup and makeup. 5) We seem to start to know each other in a way that is intimate without being physically intimate. 6) We "hug" and support each other in here. 7) A lot of us end up with stalkers. However, mine has been lurking silently lately and that pisses me off. 8) We cuss a lot. Don't read if the following words offend you: fuck, fucking, shit, damn, slut, ho, motherfucker, muthafuckah, hell, goddamn and crap. 9) Many of us are fascinated with shit. 10) We seem to develop our own language and when we finally meet in person, we blogtalk , which has caused eavesdroppers to pause and stare. 11) Most of us end up drunk posting or posting about being drunk. There are a lot of drinkers in here. 12) We're not shy, at least not in here. Some of us aren't in "real life" (my hero, Jaden). 13) We're obsessed with our stat counters. 14) We use the word "blog" at least twice a day. In actual conversation. My friends cannot differentiate now between my friends that I actually visit and speak with, and the ones in here. 15) Many of us have insomnia. 16) The words "Donnie Darko" pop up a lot. 17) I would bet that a whole lot of us blog in our underwear. What more can you add? Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 Okay, said I would post about my day earlier, then got caught up in aunt-related duties. AEROPUERTO RUN Woke up before five thinking I was way late to pick up Vicente for the airport run. Turns out I was too early and ended up snoozing at V's for a while. LATE AS USUAL Running late due to later departure time, Bunny and I didn't meet up for coffee at the Nodding Dog until eleven. We were joined by Monketo (a very nice guy) and after he had his coffee, we went to La Calle Doce. Mmmmm, fish tacos! I didn't really care for the texture of Bunny's ceviche - it was not at all like what I expected. I wasn't about to sample Monketo's lunch, as it was not on my list of things I can eat. At one point, he asked me if he could ask me a question. I replied, "Yes, I'm very high maintenance." Monketo just looked at me and then said, "Uh, okay. But I want to know what non-girlfriend means." I just assumed he was asking the question I get more than anything else. Except for "Why are you so sparkly at 10:30 in the morning?" Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 Aieeeee! Okay, what a night. What a day. Home prego test failed so I'm thinking the perpetual vomiting is simply nerves. Why else would someone projectile you-know-what in the middle of the day? After being called twenty times on their day off and having someone slam into their car (not my car, my brother's) while their niece was in the back seat??? Luby's - that's where she wanted to go. Not Pappadeaux, and you know why? Because "Momma hasn't been there yet, and she really wants to go." What a sweet child. Then we played Dogopoly until she became bored and started tossing the money into the air. We watched Caddyshack. She played on barbie.com and drew me pictures. I had a cocktail and we went to bed. Bad Aunt Chicken. TIRED Aunt Chicken is more like it. It's those four years I worked in that day care center. Children wear me out. They are almost as high maintenance as I am. Ah, the young one is awake. I'll be toast in the a.m. for keeping her up. "This is the best day of my life." That's what she told me at least five times. No, honey, except for the accident and the throwing up, it's one of the best days of my life. Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 At least, not tonight. But maybe at 3:12 a.m. on Friday, as it seems to be my habit lately. I forgot to buy dog treats again. Well, I didn't really forget, I just wanted to come home, light a candle for the Sparkster and get plastered. I DON'T HAVE TO WORK TOMORROW Thank God, as I am sick of it. Oh, to be independently wealthy. Then I could be a classy slut like Paris Hilton. whatever Aeropuerto run early in the a.m., then off to cafe and fabu pastry delights with Bun. I'm bringing Buzzy. He's the only one of the three I can scold into submission. All he wants to do is lick your legs anyway. "HI, MY NAME IS CHICKEN, AND I'M AN..." Like you really thought I'd finish that sentence. I AM WAITING FOR THE LAUNDRY FAIRY, AND I'M RUNNING OUT OF CLEAN UNDERWEAR I'm so terribly lazy that I might go and buy new ones to prolong the time I can wait in between washes. I'm a clean person. I just don't believe in domestic duties . That's for someone else, someone I pay $75 so my house is clean. I WOULD GET MARRIED AGAIN IF I COULD HAVE A CLEAN HOUSE EVERY DAY. Well, no, I wouldn't. But sometimes I am tempted . Remember "Rock and Roll High School"? If you don't, you're too fucking young and you need to go to another blog. One that reminisces fondly about the New Kids On The Block . "I hate mousework." THERE ARE THREE FUCKING CHICKENS NEXT DOOR This ain't Utah, my fair-feathered friends. That cock is really getting some action. I'm fonder of the smaller, more colorful fowl. Or perhaps it is two roosters and a hen? LIVE: CHICKEN PORN - HOT! HOT! HOT!

 This post is dedicated to Sparky It has been one hell of a long year . I had to work at home last Fathers' Day while my poor little man was in the hospital, recovering from a blood transfusion. Had I known that I would never bring him home again (alive), I'd have taken off the next day and not have done that fucking transport when I could have had at least one more visitation with him. The day after he died, I cried so hard I started throwing up. I remember the evening of his death, sitting on my den floor, doing one shot of vodka after another while my mom kept telling me that this wasn't the way to handle it. The very next weekend I went out and got my Sparky tattoo . It took my mom an entire month to send me a sympathy card. She kept trying to write in it but couldn't, as every time she was overtaken by tears. I cried every time I read the cards I received, so I finally put them away in my memory box for the little fat guy . Paddy liked to call him "Tubbs." I once threw a complete stranger out of my house (well, bitched at him until he left) because he made a cruel remark about Sparky's weight. Sparky would come running when I'd say, "My little man" or "scratchy?" And he couldn't help it that he was fat. He ignored me when I called him by his real name. People didn't know how to handle me there for a while. I had one potential buyer for a property we owned who made a snide remark about "being upset about a dead dog" and I came this close to chewing his weasely little snarky ass out. But I needed my job. I still hate that motherfucker with a passion . Sparky's eulogy got forwarded to people across the country, people I didn't even know. There are so many people out there who understood what I was going through. And some who didn't. Those who didn't, I'd swerve to miss a squirrel if they were both in my path. And I don't really like squirrels all that much. My makeup is running down my cheeks as I type. Never a truer love have I known, not one so unconditional. Sparky always knew when I was upset. Even now, all three dogs I have don't become nearly as upset as my Sparky did when momma was crying. He tried my patience. He made me cuss up a blue streak. I would spend 100 times over what I spent to keep him alive - all VERY MUCH WORTH IT. He annoyed the hell out of Mark Pittman. Paddy loved him almost as much as I did. He was my fucking savior. And I was his for a very short time. A piece of my heart and soul was taken from me at 2:25 p.m. on June 17, 2003. Those of you who cannot understand this can FUCK OFF. Those of you who do, I love you . God bless My Little Man. How very much I loved him. Sparky December 1, 1999 - June 17, 2003 Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 I was just the recipient of one of the dirtiest looks I've ever encountered. Oh Happy Day! Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 I absolutely HATE being left alone in this office. It creeps me out. Some went to meetings, others to properties, and my assistant went to Farmers' Market with her mom to buy some fruit. Okay. The noisy-ass fax machine sounds like someone is trying to break in. I cannot concentrate. And I think my office phone is being bugged. I don't care, I'll still be calling my bookie, my crack dealer and that escort service anyway. I'M BORED It took too long at the nail salon between my fingers and toes that I had to stop them mid-pedicure and leave without polish. At least my feet are soft and smooth. And very, very slippery. I walked into Taco Cabana afterwards for (guess what) bean and cheese tacos and appeared as though I was staggering into the place in a drunken fashion. I wish. MORE ON THE LOTTERY One hundred and twenty million dollars. And Timmy, those aren't my friends, they're my co-workers. I'm with Vicente - I like to work as little as possible unless it's something I'm passionate about. nongirlfriend - that's not work. This blog - it's fun and a release. My love life? Well, sometimes it is, but usually on his part. I'm a lot of fun to put up with sometimes. IT IS WORK-RELATED I have to send a certified letter out this afternoon. Might as well go to the Main U.S. Postal Office, right down the street from Siegel's on Industrial. I'm taking orders... Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 I'm such a good nongirlfriend. I wake up at 4:55 to wake Vicente's ass up in New York. Now I cannot go back to sleep. My parents are leaving today for my uncle's funeral. If I hadn't been sick, I would have left early tomorrow to go. It's just too damned far away. Plus, then I'd have to see my aunt and her bitchy, weird daughters, and I just don't want that misery. She's the one who, after having a masectomy, decides I really need to see the scar. After much pleading to the opposite on my part. I think living in the country too long affects people in a slightly adverse manner. ARE YOU A WORKAHOLIC? Nope? Me neither. In fact, we were all having lunch at work the other day and talk of winning the lottery came up. Everyone said they would still keep working. FUCK THAT SHIT. I'd shop and travel and do whatever I wanted to, which (in the tradition of Peter Gibbons) would be NOTHING. I would also have the world's largest dressing room . Look out, Imelda Marcos. They would keep working? Please. I would do some sort of volunteer work, or have my own rescue shelter. But work for someone else? I don't think so. I'd probably also get a few more Min Pins. I'd really like to have a whole herd. FUCK IT, I'M GOING BACK TO BED Who the hell gets up at 5:00 in the morning??? Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 Try pulling off an entire set of acrylic nails with your teeth . Believe me, if I could grow my own nails, I wouldn't put up with such bullshit. But Vicente likes the feeling of fingernails on his back, and the babies love getting their "scratchy" so I keep it up. OKAY, I'M BORED. AND INSOMNIATIC. At least I'm not fucking shopping . I REALLY DON'T WANT TO GO TO WORK TOMORROW. I REALLY DON'T WANT TO WORK EVER AGAIN. Still, I have not found the answer to my dilemma. My ears hurt. My eyes are watering. However, if I want to still take Friday off to spend with my niece, I must go in. There had better be bean and cheese tacos waiting for me, goddamnit. MIN PINS IN EVERY ROOM Apparently, the grass had a relaxing effect on Sado's tum (I've heard it's helpful that way). She's now sleeping with Buzzy, and Nico is crashed out in the den. And Margie's at the Lincoln Park Inn (geez, one would hope my childhood wouldn't follow me around this way) I SWEAR TO GOD, I REALLY DO HAVE A LIFE I'm just addicted to this shit. And have trouble sleeping. Not always the best combination. Hey, but it works for me.

 blogtree.com - an interesting idea for your blog - tracing its genealogy. I have two sibling blogs, one of whom I do not know. NOT TO BEAT A DEAD HORSE BUT I finally stopped throwing up. And I was able to eat old-people-food and keep it down. ANONYMITY It is funny that some people remain anonymous and visit so often. I was speaking with urlLink Bunny earlier this evening, and that subject came up. Seems urlLink Zero had an anonymous commenter the other day. And then there's Nein . THIS IS NOT YOUR PARENTS' BLOG They would probably wash out your mouths with soap if they knew you were reading it. IT IS ALL BUNNY'S FAULT urlLink This is why I could not take a nap and try to rid myself of this horrible cold. So now I've yet another ecommerce site to go blow my $$$ (what little is left after bills, etc.). I told Bun that her email with that link was like sending an alcoholic on a beer run. Oh fuck. You know I'll end up buying it. Oh, and if anybody is in the market for buying me things , I'd like one of urlLink these in every color. However, one will suffice. I was looking for a pink purse - urlLink found one . LOOK WHAT THE CHICKEN DRUG IN Okay, folks, I was pretty well-behaved and only bought mascara at Sephora. My Bad Gal Lash is drying up (that sucker lasts a long time, though), so I thought I would try Urban Decay's Skyscraper Mascara in the only available color - Gotham. What I love about the online thing is that I always get my choice of three samples. Which is how I end up spending way too much money the next time I visit. Plus, there's that little black velvet gift bag they come in. I think I have eight or nine by now. SOMETHING'S FOWL ABOUT THAT For the record, today was not a hangover. I'm getting the feeling that most people thought it was. Believe me, I'd prefer a hangover. Actually, I don't really get them anymore. Too much practice, I'm sure. Paddy Mac told me I wasn't sick. We just won't go into that. Next time, I will save all the vomit and the sweaty clothes and dump them in his room. Hangovers don't cause your lymph glands to swell up over night. Besides that, I wasn't even drinking. Not Sunday night at least. Bunny's mom shares my affinity for vodka. You gotta love her. SICK AS A DOG Poor Sadie has a stomach ache and proceeded to graze my lawn like a goat. She still wants to go outside. How much grass is too much for a dog to eat?

SPECIAL THANKS TO E - FOR SHAMELESSLY WHORING MY T-SHIRT IN LA! You rock, sistah nongirlfriend! Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 Just when you thought the fun was over... I had to go to Seven-Eleven to pick up some more coke. And some ice, since my ice maker hasn't worked in three years and I'm just too goddamned lazy (and ignorant) to repair it. It's freaking HOT out there. Then I pull up, haul my purchases out of Ol' Red, and this fucking wasp (not like Pisser's WASPs) wouldn't let me in the house. My neighbors now have physical evidence of my insanity. NEEDLESS TO SAY, BUT I'M GONNA SAY IT ANYWAY All that running around the front yard, swatting at the little bastard and my dogs are barking incessantly inside, watching their psychotic mama do the Frantic Chicken Dance, I come inside and immediately lose the food I managed to keep down for 90 minutes. TO THE READER WHO ORDERED A SHIRT THIS WEEKEND: Thanks, and of course, I didn't get to the UPS place because I was so busy vomiting. It will set sail off to you tomorrow. BUNNY IS THE DEVIL Thanks, no REALLY , thanks!! for sending me that email about that $58 knit top at Anthropologie. Do you know how long I spent on that website (in between vomit visits, of course)? Speaking of the v word...excuse me, please. Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 Why did mashed potatoes with brown gravy seem even the least bit appetizing? Went in to work, grabbed some shit to work on at home, barely made it back before projectile vomiting those lovely fake mashed potatoes. I think macaroni and cheese might be a better plan the next time I attempt to eat. RUBBER DUCKY, YOU'RE THE ONE So now I am going to take a bath. Splish splash. VICENTE INVADES NEW YORK Good thing I didn't buy those tickets. Puking on a plane can not be a pleasant activity. LOOKS LIKE I WON'T BE TAKING THURSDAY OFF Why do I always feel guilty when I am sick? It seems since that abscessed tooth last year, I've been sick on a regular basis. I do believe the infection entered my brain. Cripey! I believe the taters are swimming upstream again. More on vomiting later... Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 Not to pull a urlLink Debbie Downer on you, but it seems I am getting the flu. Or some such shit. I feel like the bottom of an old shoe by the side of the road. Waaaah waaaahh . I really must get my ass into work or I won't be able to take off for the Sparky Weekend. Still, I'm dizzy, feverish and slightly loopy (and not for a good reason, mind you). I HATE MONDAYS. But today, I hate them even more. Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 This post is completely dedicated to Pisser , who thinks dogs stink. They do . They also bark too much. I don't need an alarm system at my house - Sadie is enough alarm for most anything. Dogs eat their own vomit and shit , but still their mouths are cleaner than ours? (Remind me never to kiss anyone again, k?) It's been proved (wait, is that an actual word?) that dogs lower humans' capacity for depression. If so, why the fuck am I on Prozac if I have three freakin' dogs ??? Pisser, all I can say is CHEESE . Or cheese pizza. My babies are the best. Right now, Rainman (Buzzy) is growling at me for some cheese pizza. Nico prances around the backyard in true Min Pin fashion. And Sadie, that Snarky Bitch, doesn't listen to a goddamned thing I say. P - stick with felines. They're much easier to deal with. I just like the frustration . Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 I had a friend named Dan once. Drove himself into a telephone pole and died. The phone call came as I had always expected it would. There are just some people you know won't make it in this world. I have eaten absolutely nothing today. I hate the weekends - there is no structure and I need a schedule or a plan or something. 12:00 - EAT SOME FOOD 5:00 - EAT SOME MORE FOOD It really isn't that difficult. I DON'T DEAL WITH DEATH WELL It's been almost a year since Sparky left me, and I still get upset. Then my uncle goes and dies after being in some sort of coma (my mom said he was "skin and bones") and I really, really wish my dad didn't have to see him that way. I don't know how I would handle my parents' deaths. Not well is what I'm thinking. NICKNAMES Isn't it funny the names we give our "beloved" ones in here. Vicente? So far from his real name I might just puke. Cranky? I'm sure there's a story behind that name, right Pisser? Who the fuck would want to be called a chicken? That's crazy . I actually like being called chicken, but I'm strange. Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 First, Erica's g-ma. Then Linda's aunt. Now my uncle. At least he had a long life. And he gave my mom another reason to bitch about me smoking (two emphysema deaths on that side of the family). I told her I wanted to wear myself out before I was old, forgetful and living through a tube. Wrong thing to say to her this morning. But it's true. I don't want to get old. I'm already forgetful, so there's no desire to become wrinkly on top of it. IN MEMORIAM My dad will chastise me for not knowing, but I am pretty sure my uncle was a war hero. I can't remember the story, but I know he was there. My grandfather (dad's dad) was in the first World War. Once, sitting on his bed at the nursing home, he thought I was another soldier, and told me of escaping captivity. Eight years old is too young to deal with that. Too bad I wasn't older...what a story I could have heard. WE'RE LOSING A GENERATION VERY VALUABLE TO US The brats of my generation and those who follow me are losing an important part of our history , and we're not even concerned . You know what? I LIKE hearing the old stories, I like hearing about school houses where you can find grades 1-12. I don't buy the "walking to school in the snow" both ways bullshit, especially here in Texas, but I like it nonetheless. I remember meeting an aunt about ten times removed who actually dipped chewing tobacco. Te-backy, as they called it. C-2 COCA COLA The low-carb alternative. Oh fuckitall, just drink the goddamned REAL THING and forget about it. I swear, the Atkins craze is BULLSHIT. I survive on carbs (among other things) and I weigh in at 120. Besides, you don't know what they've done to your meat. I wouldn't eat it if I were you . ATTENTION DEFICIT DISORDER THEATRE IS IN THE OTHER ROOM My older brother said that to me yesterday. And he is ADD all the way. We all are. I'm easily distracted by shiny things or things that are pink. I'm also easily seduced by makeup. Gay men love me but they don't want to fuck me. I'M WITH THELMA Remember that in one of my favorite movies, Thelma and Louise, where Susan Sarandon asked Geena Davis if all she was gonna do is "stay drunk all day" - "Gonna try." Her husband, Darryl, could have been my second ex. Why do people think that's a lesbian film? Because they kiss at the end? Or because they eschew men? THAT IS WHAT NONGIRLFRIEND IS ALL ABOUT. I just don't get it. BOYS ARE AN ACCESSORY If I ever won an Academy Award, I'd thank the chickens next door. At least they're "free-range." Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 For some reason, the tangent universe was not in sync last night, and Vicente left my house at 11:45 to GO HOME . I think he is on a no-poultry diet for a while. This happens about every six months. Or every time my head spins around and split pea soup comes flying out of my mouth. Which did NOT happen last night. I give up. Men cannot be understood. That's why I'm buying the Chubby G the very next opportunity I get. POOR TIMING Maybe he is just worried because he has so much to do to get ready for the next six weeks? Maybe I'm this OCD bitch who cannot just let things lie and has to obsess over a fucking voice mail message? (I think the latter AND the former apply here.) FREE-RANGE CHICKENS Pisser opened a can of bean-eating worms when she posted about United Poultry Concerns. I've gone off my eggs-over-easy-with-wheat-toast (unless they are of the free-range variety, which I am almost certain Denny's doesn't carry) and I am having nightmares about molting chickens. Perhaps I should don a nurse's uniform and shout out " Bok! " ala "The World According To Garp." DRUNK DIALING I received TWO drunk dials (count them, people, TWO) last night (this morning, whatever). The fascinating part of this is that I almost always do the DD, but rarely receive it. Mainly because most people know I'll be DD'ing them later, so they don't bother. I also got called a bitch and a see-you-next-Tuesday (those were the actual words ) for not picking up the phone. Guys, my ringer's off. I cannot hear the phone. Specifically because I do not want to speak to people at two a.m. No, not even you . I might be intoxicated. However, last night, I was not so, unfortunately. And the one voicemail I got that was not under the influence didn't use chicken terminology . So now I am sad. BITTER WITH BAGGAGE SEEKS SAME I have CHEESE on my t-shirt. Last night, I actually ate cheddar-cheese-stuffed-jalapenos. And I hate jalapenos. Or so I thought . Why did the chicken eat the mountain? Because it was THERE. This skinny bitch really can be a PIG sometimes. IF I COULD TURN BACK TIME... I would find a way to be 18 years old in physical appearance, 75 years old in wisdom and 100 years old in eccentricity. Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 After reading about urlLink Leif Wright's post on his and Soko's trip to Austin, I became nostalgic for the days Paddy Mac lived there, both during college and when he moved back afterwards. And not just because of the pot. I remember the evenings at Little Mexico, eating myself silly (probably because I was so fucked up, it never took too long). And Jason, sitting on the couch, singing along to "You Sexy Motherfucker." (Shakin' that ass, shakin' that ass) Or watching "Zulu" for the 129th time. PM's was the place to be...I could smell the patchouli in the parking lot of his apartment. SCAVENGER HUNT I know I had some around here somewhere... TOPIC DE JOUR That insane guy who tossed his girlfriend off an overpass on Central Expressway - well, all I can say is that I hope he suffered and she died instantly. It's like that fuckass who threw his puppy into traffic a few years back: hell ain't hot enough for people like that. BITCHES IN HEAT Would anyone care to adopt Mama Dog ? She lives on property at one of our apartment communities. We are still unsure if the babies' daddy is Boy Toy , her former boyfriend, or Blanco , the new guy on the scene. Motherfuckers at the City of Dallas pound won't come out to pick them up because they "are not aggressive" - they told us to tie up the dogs and they would come get them. So we just started feeding them instead. Hell, I'd take all three home if I could afford six vet bills (I can barely afford three and my addiction to sephora.com). The dogs are so sweet, but no one can catch them. MM actually felt the babies kicking when we found Mama Dog asleep under a car. HAPPY BIRTHDAY CAITY! My niece has a bday today. She is still too young to truly appreciate the spankings. Unlike her Aunt Chicken. CRAP Well, folks, it's been too long since I've posted about shit (feces, "baby mice," whatever). Due to my insomnia, I woke up in the middle of the night and watched "Donnie Darko" AGAIN. Hey, at least it kept me from buying that Dior moisturizer and "Higher Energy" perfume I've been eyeing. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE SHIT? Sorry, Jake Gyllenhaal distracted me for a moment. And then there's urlLink makeup . I think the lack of bean and cheese tacos in my diet has proven to render me a little "backed up," as Kramer would say. Then again, not eating all fucking day doesn't help, either. Or, as urlLink Pisser would say, CHEESE . [Do not worry, this is not another eating disorder - let's call it a sleeping disorder , as in I slept all day and forgot to eat until my empty belly gave me the Headache From Hell.] STALK ME I really don't have to ask, but Nein won't comment anymore even though I know he/she/it is still out there. Yesterday, someone from Iraq visited me. Well, visited Non-Girlfriend but you know what I mean. I'm sure they enjoyed my feistiness . Chicken becomes Iraq's Public Enemy Number Two (there's still Bush). Osama Bin Laden is one fugly motherfucker. It's no wonder he's hiding in caves . THE DOGS BEGIN TO SMELL HER The dingos are pestering me to go out in the backyard. I actually believe they are POUTING . Time to go. Maybe you'll all luck out and I'll do a drunk blog later on.

 Has anyone seen my fee-an-say? The poor baby. To answer Vicente's questions, No, I do not want to go out tonight. I want to be as lazy as humanly possible and watch Saturday Night Live in my underwear. And order another fucking cheese pizza. Like all the pizza I had last night wasn't enough. Ar! Hey, don't mess with Texas ! Keep yer butts in the car! (Mary/Lisa will appreciate that reference, tree-hugger that she is. She will also hunt you down if you litter, so watch out for a white Mazda whatever-the-hell-it's-called. Oh wait, it's a Tribute. Thanks Dalty!) I've seen that bitch chase people down who throw things out of their cars. Vicente is fed up with the Chicken. I have no idea why, because I'm one of the most charming people you will ever meet. It can't be the fact that I am lazier than just about anyone living. Or that I hate housework. Or that I'm terrible with money. Or that I drank all that vodka last night. Or that I chain-smoke at times. No, it couldn't be any of those reasons at all. Actually, I think he just needed a reason to get off the phone. Like, "Let me let you go, I'm busy" wasn't available. Men. What more can I say? Except that I feel like puking because I haven't eaten all day, and that seems to be counter-intuitive, you know, to puke up nothing? Maybe it's just the Red Bull. THAT'S ENTER TAIN MENT! Apparently, one can throw up nothing. And throw it up through their nose. How exciting. EVERYTHING'S BETTER WITH BLUEBONNET ON IT Except pickles. Or ice cream. Or watermelon. Or maybe Chelsea Clinton. BLAH BLAH BLAH I really have nothing to say today, as is evident by 99% of this post. So I'm going to go soak my head and watch some trashy television. Cheers to all!

 I just woke up at 2:30. After we woke up at 12:30 a.m., watched "Along Came Polly," I woke up again at 2:30. Then 5:00. Then 7:00. Christ, and I think Vicente took the Ambien. Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 I'm quite sure Van Gogh had it. And Ted Bundy. And Hitler. ALL the crazy ones had to have had it. I think it is the first of many steps down the path to insanity. Three lively Min Pins do not help.

I NEVER EAT COLD PIZZA BUT SOMEHOW NOW IT DOESN'T SEEM SO BAD I will not "rat out" Hun or any of you. The whole co-worker thing was three years of frustration finally coming to an end. Even Chickens lose their heads every now and then. I REALLY NEED A PEDICURE BUT I'M AFRAID TO GO BACK TO THE ILLEGAL-SCRAPER-THING LADIES I should just stop staring at my toes. In particular, my right big toe. If she were Captain of the Ship, there would be a mutiny. (No one gets my Seinfeld references anymore) 100% CHICKEN...24 HOURS A DAY, 7 DAYS A WEEK No, no Johnnie, you didn't wake up and found it was Halloween. We're just having chicken every night for supper. And chicken tacos for breakfast. And chicken Caesar salad for lunch. How about some nice chicken boullion for desert? Mmmmm... WASHING OFF ONE'S MAKEUP ACTUALLY HELPS ONE'S COMPLEXION Novel idea, darling, but then I wouldn't resemble one half of AbFab if I did that. IS ANYONE ELSE IN THE CENTRAL TIME ZONE AWAKE FOR NO GOOD REASON AT ALL? It'd be one thing if I were just coming home from a date (date? what's THAT?), or a club, or a night out with the girls, but I'm pretty sure I went to bed at least three hours ago with my tired-ass boyfriend, and all I did for excitement was moon the neighbors. Stories of my big white ass will be told in this neighborhood for generations... I LOVE MY NONBOYFRIEND AND I KNOW HE PUTS UP WITH A LOT (ME), BUT EVERY NOW AND THEN, I JUST WISH HE'D SPANK ME Just thought I'd throw that in there to see if you were paying attention.

 I need a cigarette. It's sunny outside for once in DAYS and I'm trapped inside this windowless office. ...obviously, I didn't need one too badly. It's too fucking humid outside to puff . I took three of my pseudo-drags (I don't inhale) and threw the fucker away. Can you tell I'm about to get my period? ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ I'm spending my afternoon the very best way I think anyone can: writing escrow adjustment letters to our lenders. Whee. Whoo. ARGH! I'm literally so bored that I was counting the number of air conditioner vents in the office. And picking at my fingernails. Eew , never, ever look down at your feet when you haven't had a pedicure in a while. Wouldn't it be great if we could get PAID (paid, not laid , you pervs!) to sit around and blog all day long? I'd be a goddamned millionaire by now. (If you went on the number of posts, including deleted drunk posts .) PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT Don't get pissed off at a co-worker and email them from home when you are upset. Things usually don't turn out right when you do. AND NOW, BACK TO OUR REGULARLY SCHEDULED PROGRAM... Actually, I haven't posted anything lengthy at work in a while. My work area (cell) is starting to get more personalized. On my cabinet door of my computer hutch, I have a photo of a grinning dog sitting in a shopping cart, a homemade thank you note from Mary/Lisa and an It's Happy Bunny sticker (the "cute but psycho" one). Down below that is my shrine of protection from the evil forces lurking about: my mini Buddha (facing east), my Tarte candle ("Battery Park" - smells like childhood to me) and my Devil Min Pin. No wonder my co-workers question my sanity. No wonder YOU do. Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 friday, friday, friday, friday, friday God, I'm glad its finally here. Vicente and I may go see my Jake tonight (The Day After Tomorrow). I get to have fish tacos for lunch. I'm not working on job-work at all this weekend. Four very good reasons to say that today is a great day (at least better than the rest of this week). Happy Friday!!! Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 The whole point of having a "journal" is to be able to vent. However, one of my co-workers in San Antonio has this link so not so good an idea at times. It felt good to get that off my chest. And I didn't even have to drive a rusty nail through my hand. Thank God, since I don't think my tetanus shots are up to date. Paddy Mac wanted to see Sadie at 2:30 in the morning. Great, so now I'm up. And the babies think it's time to eat. Buzzy's so conditioned that if an alarm goes off at say 3:00 in the afternoon, by God, it is TIME TO EAT. Junebugg, I have no idea what happened to oral sex. I was drunk. Maybe I was wanting some? I really cannot say. I just wanted to lie down and go to sleep, and wake up with a different job. Ah, if it were only that easy. I think three years is enough. I never used to have all these sleep issues (or drink issues, for what that's worth) or anger issues. I used to be a Happy Camper (even though I don't care for camping, really). I guess I ought to go back to bed. I'm up with the chickens next door and in to work at 7:30 again. Hey, at least it's fucking Friday. Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 I'm having a SHIT-FUCK-DAMN day. Clock-watcher for the rest of the afternoon. Been here since the ungodly hour of 7:30. Actually, before that. But whatever. A few minutes here, a few minutes there. I even beat my boss in. At least there was a sushi buffet with Vicente. Six and a half LONG ASS DAYS until I'm off for the Sparky Weekend. Shit. Fuck. Damn. Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 I'm fucking sick of the rain. I'm also sick of laundry but if I wanna wear panties tomorrow, I guess I better do some. I'm sick of politics (not the Presidential election, the work variety). But I'm kinda sick of the Presidential election, too. I'm sick of anti-smokers (shut UP already, I know it will kill me). I'm not sick of vodka, but I'm beginning to care more for a margarita. No salt, please. YES, BUNNY, 'TIS TRUE My blogging-during-the-day days are over. It's not like I spent HOURS on the damned thing anyway. Besides, I'm trapped at a fucking desk all day long so I need some entertainment and a break from Excel. BOK. BAK. WHO CARES ? Apparently Gregg does. Please go check out his hilarious website, urlLink sexwithchickens.com . I am so gonna buy the babies t-shirts from his website. I think Crotch Dog (Nico) will look stunning in one as he shits on my floor again ! I'm also going to MikWright to buy some more cocktail napkins. One can never have too many, at least not around this place. CHICKEN REALITY TV Thank God the webcam RDM gave me did not work with my computer. I'm pretty scary right now - eye makeup on my left eye is smeared across my face (I forgot about it when I rubbed my eye). I also have BAD HAIR. It just won't work with me when it's raining. And we're looking at another WEEK of Bad Hair Days. ONE WEEK TO GO I took next Thursday and Friday off for the Sparky Anniversary, and to just chill for a few days. I thought I might go somewhere but I really want to spend time with the babies. Mary/Lisa said, "Oh SURE...you'll just blog all day long." No, I will not. I may have a few cocktails and watch "Donnie Darko" again, too. IF I AM UNEMPLOYED TOMORROW, WILL SOMEONE PLEASE HIRE ME? I'm cute, I'm fun, and I really don't like to work all that much. Email me for a resume. Your company won't be the same afterwards. CLUCK-N-FUCK I'm telling you , go see the chickens having sex. YOU won't be the same afterwards. CANDY IS DANDY BUT LIQUOR IS QUICKER Ask Aunt Chicken. Just don't ask her about last weekend. Whew . MISCELLANY * I want a day of mourning for my death. I also want a shrine built in honor of me, but like a Buddhist shrine, only a Platinum Chicken - please, no ghetto gold for me! * When the director's cut of "Donnie Darko" comes out, who's going with me? (Bunny, you know you have no other choice!) * Since February 22, 2004, I have seen "Donnie Darko" at least 28 times. And YES, I have heard of OCD. * I used to let Sparky pick out CDs for my parties. He should have been a DJ. One night, he pulled out nothing but heroin-overdose-groups and we had a blast! * My uncle is dying. And I really do not know what the fuck to say to my father. * Vicente is the nicest. And has the cutest butt. I'm going to miss him this summer. * I'm going to Cozumel this summer.

 The Day From Hell ( don't even ask ) Nuthin' but rain, rain, RAIN in North Central Texas. Half of my backyard has washed away. I cannot make up my mind about what to eat for dinner so of course I'll go to bed without eating. Like most nights. I just simply cannot be bothered . DON'T FORGET THE CHEESE Sorry, but I just wanted cheese in this post. TRYING TO TAKE VACATION Little Man's anniversary is next Thursday. Still haven't heard if I can take off that day (and the following). So I am just assuming I don't have to go in. Hey Bloggers - Cozumel in August! Crispy Fried Chicken available in September. EVENTUALLY, SOMEDAY, I'D LIKE TO OWN A HORSE FARM No, not really. But doesn't it sound cool ? Mea culpa for the sporadic, all-over-the-place, ADD-blogging. Had a VERY BAD DAY and I just wanna NOT THINK . (As a student of English and Literature, I really think I could have worded that sentence differently.) Bun-Bun , email me - I'll give you the "beauty blog" info. AND NOW, FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT... Can you sue someone for turning you into an alcoholic ??? I'm just wondering. NG BETTER TAKE OFF - THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY Well, that's not really ALL, but it's a start. Can I leave you with a list of things I (ahem) "dislike" (hate)? 1) Idiots 2) Ignorant people 3) People who throw their WEIGHT around 4) Pedicurists who think they know better than you do 5) Ditto with hairdressers 6) Cold coffee (that is not supposed to be cold) 7) Nepotism 8) Liars 9) Tail-gaters 10) Gossipers (only in the bad sense of it, not when it's good news) 11) Idiots ( oh, wait, I said that already ) Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 (courtesy of urlLink MikWright ) Yep, it is a Monday, and not just at work. I come home to check orders and my goddamned Outlook isn't working. After I found out my mom had to take her dog (my former dog, Buffy) to the vet. Suspiciously absent from dinner when I stopped by to mooch some "home cooking" off my parents, I learned of the malady and drove up to the vet, only to have missed her by about a minute. At least Buff's in no grave danger. They found her staring at the toilet and acting scared. I think she was staring at the toilet because she had to shit, and couldn't because her pancreatitis is acting up. On to more pleasant subjects... CHEESE Yes, cheese. The reason I cannot shit like a normal person. Cheese. My most favorite food. Cheese. A reason for living. Cheese, cheese, cheese-cheese-CHEESE. A good time to sigh is after saying "cheese," or eating some cheese, or even thinking about cheese. Now there you have some appropriate times to sigh. I've often wondered why no one has ever made cheese-flavored bubble gum. Where's Willy Wonka when you need him? MIND-BLOWING SEX! Why yes, thank you ! LET'S JUST SUFFICE IT TO SAY I AM NOT A HUGE FAN OF THE EMPANADA Vicente likes saying the word, though. I'm just not all about that much dough, you know? Even so, the Vegetarian Brazilian Breakfast was good; just hold the empanada and gimme some of them black beans, would ya? I prefer saying "chimichanga." Chimichanga, chimichanga - what the fuck is a chimichanga? It's fried, so I've never tried one. Isn't it like some big-ass burrito all deep-fried and fattening? Do they make a CHEESE chimichanga? I just might change my mind. WHATEVER HAPPENED TO SALLY STRUTHERS? I wonder what kind of Google searches that one will bring up? LOVE IN THE TIME OF CHOLERA Or in our case, in the time of AIDS, genital herpes, syphilis, chlymadia and that old favorite, gonorrhea. Since I have been "ensconced" for almost four years, I forget sometimes how honestly frightening it would be to be dating again. Condoms. Hosing one's partner down with Lysol. Taking blood samples prior to agreeing to meet for coffee. Scary times. Damn the government, whichever side you might be for. I really think this shit could have been at least controlled by now. Or maybe I've just been watching far too much HBO? I GIVE UP. I'M JUST GONNA GO TO BED. I really need to make up for the lack of sleep from this weekend. Still... Eric Clapton ? I wouldn't have missed it for the world! (By the way, Vicente is all about learning the blues now. Seems like I might come in handy for that, don't you think?) Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 FABULOUS day at the Crossroads Guitar Festival . Until driving home this morning (out late again!), I didn't realize how truly lucky we were to get to attend this. Yes, Vicente, this does put you in THE Nicest Category. My Absolut favorite part was the blues jam session with EC, B.B. King, Jimmie Vaughn (who is way cute in a Boz Scaggs sort of way), Buddy Guy and John Mayer. I cannot wait for the DVD release. When it comes on PBS, be sure to watch it. SHAMELESS WHORING Fox 4 News was there, of course, but the guy was filming a plastic cup full of beer. I happened to be buying WATER but some drunk guy said, "Chug that down! Chug that down in one shot and he'll film you for TV!" I won't end up on the news, I'm certain, but what the hell? There's a minute possibility I could get some free advertising. Having gorgeous Veronica walk around in a ng shirt was good advertising in and of itself. I heard many guys say they liked my shirt as I walked by (tits out, chin up), and a group even catcalled me, saying, "nongirlfriend! nongirlfriend! over here!" I really don't think that I would ever have a problem with fame. EATING ISSUES They ran out of food after waiting in line for 45 minutes at The Old (Grist) Mill at Fair Park. Of course, I'm ultra high maintenance and could not just grab a burger like everyone else (eew). So we ventured out across the street and found the most fabulous little bar that served food (one where they still let you smoke, as most of their revenue comes from the booze, babies). Started off with the jalapeno hummus and baked pita wedges. Not quite as good as Mercy's black bean/roasted red pepper hummus but quite tasty . It was Veronica's virgin tasting and she loved it! We also shared a CHEESE and fruit platter (goat cheese, sharp cheddar and dill havarti). I dipped my CHEESE into the hummus and tried to forgo too much of the three breads presented. I finished my dining experience with a crab cake and freshly steamed green beans. (There were two crab cakes but due to the CHEESE and hummus consumption extravaganza , I could only eat one, unfortunately. Very first crab cakes I've ever eaten that didn't give me indigestion. AND we were drinking some strong-ass margaritas .) Go to the Meridian Bar and Restaurant on Parry Avenue right across from Fair Park. Good food, good service and YOU CAN SMOKE! Two P.S. type thingies: Check out their three cheese sandwich (have it on a wheat bun) and their bread pudding. The bread pudding alone would successfully feed a third world nation in its entirety for at least two days. QUEEN GEE-TAR Vicente has found the guitar he wants to bid on at the Christie's auction Eric Clapton set up, proceeds benefitting the Crossroads rehab place he set up in Antigua. I tell you what, when I finally decide to check myself in (or should I say, IF), I'm drying out there. Okay, is it just me, or do you catch the irony in EC singing "Cocaine" at a benefit concert for drying-out-places??? Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 Got in at a whopping 3:30 this morning. Haven't done that in a while. We had a fab time but I really should have gotten more sleep. Now it's off to the Crossroads Guitar Festival : heat, too many people, and water that sells for $8 a bottle. Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 I dedicate my 400th post to you! Checking my Chicken Email for hate mail (I'm twisted that way), I find that Elizabeth Major wants to know if I want a bigger penis. Well, Lizzie, nope, V's is perfect, but thank you so very much for asking. In honor of one of my most endearing qualities, Vicente gives you this: The Procrastinator's Creed I believe that if anything is worth doing, it would have been done already. I shall never move quickly, except to avoid more work or find excuses. I will never rush into a job without a lifetime of consideration. I shall meet all of my deadlines directly in proportion to the amount of bodily injury I could expect to receive from missing them. I firmly believe that tomorrow holds the possibility for new technologies, astounding discoveries, and a reprieve from my obligations. I truly believe that all deadlines are unreasonable regardless of the amount of time given. If at first I don't succeed, there is always next year. I shall always decide not to decide, unless of course I decide to change my mind. I shall always begin, start, initiate, take the first step, and/or write the first word, when I get around to it. I will never put off tomorrow, what I can forget about forever. (author unknown) Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 I'm determined to make 400 posts before I meet up with Birthday Bunny this evening. Damn! I just sold five t-shirts on my website. Still, must do field research today. And stop by Sephora, just for good measure. It IS more fun this way! Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 The Cows' Ball (Kravji Bal) in Bohinj is a kitschy weekend of eating, drinking and folk dancing in mid-September to mark the return of the cows to the valleys from their high pastures. It doesn't get any more Slovenian than this. I wonder if they have any Chicken Festivals? Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 Not me. Although I am sure someone, somewhere did. And they are probably regretting it right as I type this. Or maybe not . TOMORROW MAY AS WELL BE FRIDAY AGAIN I have to work. Then Mary/Lisa and I are going to get our hairs cut together. Then (she doesn't know this yet), we are going Power Window Shopping . Vicente laughed about my "orders" to frequent the malls and shops - he said it was like someone ordering him to have sex . Vicente is a virile man. Thank God I cannot get pregnant. (Can you really imagine a little Chicken running around? Isn't one enough?) The wonderful website my nonboyfriend, Vicente, so lovingly created, was slammed by someone (I love the stat counters, they're so much fun ). Well, well, not one to spar with just about anybody, I decided to link her over there on the right side. But for now, go check out urlLink Leigh . And while you are at it, BUY HER AN SUV FOR HER BIRTHDAY . Do NOT criticize Vicente. That is MY job. To answer your unspoken question, No , I did not ever take criticism well . We Pisceans are way too sensitive for that . TOSHIO'S FOR LUNCH Why does sushi always leave me wanting more about 45 minutes later? Oooh, SG, I see I have a visitor from urlLink Slovenia . That seems to be the place I need to be. I love the Mediterranean. Or at least its food, since I have never, ever been. SG, I was only sparring. I feel I may have overstepped my boundaries. God, this cheese pizza fetish simply MUST END . Someone at work today told me I was shrinking . Not always a bad thing. Yeah, Yeah, Yeahs, this is stream-of-consciousness blogging. What the fuck does it matter to you? God, this week sucked. Let's hope love and warmth and happiness and JOYJOYJOY and an eventful shopping trip grace me this weekend, or I might have to visit Sephora again. Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 My neighbors' wooden fence is collapsing into my backyard. They have a chicken, a rooster and about 3,000 pigeons. I walked next door to "let them know," expecting a feud and civil trials, etc., but Yara was very nice. Her husband "loves birds" and I shared my nickname with her. Anyone who loves chickens has my vote. Funny thing is, I've never talked to her before. And last weekend marked my fourth anniversary in this house. They probably think I'm a prostitute . (There certainly are a lot of men-folk in and out of my house, but I promise, I'm only have sex with one of them, the most amazing and fun Vicente !). Fabulous Fluffy Bunny sent me a link to a USA Today article about people-who-watch-Donnie-Darko-over-and-over. I have the columnist beat: I've seen it 20 times more than she has. And seven is an awful lot of times to view one movie. I simply MUST get my hair cut this weekend: I'm braiding it again. Ugh. Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 Switching to soy milk as soon as possible . That was the second chai tea latte over ice that I threw up today. And I vomited milk this weekend. Home early because I had a fabulous meeting with RG , whom Vicente met on a plane. Great information - really nice guy (his designer was very kind and helpful, too) - lots of good advice. We'll just see what happens. I really, seriously have my work cut out for me. I was given an assignment I just don't think I can handle, though. You mean I have to constantly be at the malls and shops, checking things out? Nope, no way. You know how very much I detest shopping. It's one of the worst ways one can spend their time. Oops, that's what my mother and father brainwashed into my head. Obviously, it did not stick. I have much to do so short post. However, I will be back (like you doubted that), most likely in the middle of the night. ** By the way, I will be out in LA in July, just in case any one of you LA-Bloggers want to buy me a drink ** Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 VERY early to rise. At least I got a lot of sleep. And had a few strange dreams about co-workers. ( clears throat ) I won't go into that. I've been up for an hour, since 5 a.m., which is unusual for me (I typically go back to bed and then oversleep). I had to stay up this morning...airport run for work and business plan I didn't finish last night. PRELIM business plan, as my education was in English and Literature, and Vicente does that stuff better than I do, anyway. Let us put his MBA to work so I can do what I do best: be creative and procrastinate . Kudos to urlLink Pushing In The Pin for ordering some ng-wear. Yes, folks, this is yet one more attempt to blatantly whore myself for my company. I suppose Bunny won't be surprised if one of her bday gifts is a t-shirt ... Oops! Spilled the beans! I've never been one known to keep a harmless secret. The important stuff, I conveniently "forget." Can I be any more addictive than I am already? Blogging, cigarettes, vodka, Sugar Free Red Bull, and now - ( drumroll, please ) Chai Tea Latte On Ice . It is a most splendiferous drink. I could swim in the stuff. Well, Paddy's been in the shower since before I started this post, and it is now 6:07 a.m. I have to leave in 90 minutes and if I want to go to work looking bee-you-tuh-full, I need to get kicking. Oh, hell, I roll out of bed looking gorgeous, what am I worried about? (The fact that I am delusional and just wrote that last sentence would be a start.) I want Food Babies to come back in popularity. No matter what I do, what I try or what I eat (or don't eat), mine just won't disappear. Okay, maybe for a day, then I drink a Diet Coke and the salt just brings the damn thing back to life. Pisser likes the smallish belly that the Food Baby provides. Here, urlLink Pisser , you can have mine. Just don't get too attached to the brat, it always seems to find its way back home. Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 I get a hell of a lot of my titles from things Vicente says to me. And from Donnie Darko and Seinfeld . I only quote the best, babies. Last night, V went out with vendors and misbehaved . This morning, I call him and he is suffering from a hangover headache. "Drink some Coke, real Coke. The sugar and caffeine will help." "Drink some ice water, too. Take aspirin or ibuprofen." Vicente deadpans, " Tips from Chicken ." How sad is it that I'm handing out anti-hangover tips and cures for the morning after? Maybe I should take my show on the road? College campuses everywhere could benefit. Hell, junior high schools these days could benefit. EXCITING DAY TOMORROW! I get to meet with someone about urlLink nongirlfriend . I feel like throwing up from nervousness but I'll be fine. Besides, when do I ever NOT feel like throwing up? I just won't eat lunch tomorrow so I won't vomit on the guy. That might make for an awkward meeting. This post is dedicated to urlLink Ninsi , who applauds my multiple-postings, and to urlLink Bunny , who gets after me when I only post once a day. Big, wet , MAC Lipglass kiss to you both. Currently, I am wearing Lovechild. A girl at work lost her grandmother today. For those of you who pray (I do), say one for her and her family. Or at least keep her in your thoughts. She sounded simply terrible. Her name is Erica. She also goes by Susan, Sybil and Eria. But that's another story altogether. THYME TO CHOP MY HAIRS The back of my do is getting long enough to braid, which is a nervous habit (among many ) that I have. I really don't know how anyone has long hair, unless they're constantly popping Xanax. I'd have cornrows all over my head if I did. Right now, there are about seven braids in my short hair. I look like Pippi-Longstocking-Meets-Carrot-Top-With-A-Bad-Dye-Job . GRRRR The babies are making me insane. Try three barking Min Pins in a house full of hardwood floors. The noise can become unbearable. Perhaps I could write the modern-day version of The Yellow Wallpaper and sub those yapping dogs for a baby? It would certainly be more timely. FRUGAL SHOULD BE A FOUR-LETTERED WORD I am not above accepting charity. There are shoes to be had. Please, send money. I do accept PayPal, you know. Before I sign off to do my ng business plan, I'll leave you with one more Vicente quotation ...I was defending psychotic behavior with the tried-and-true "I'm a female" excuse, when he retorted and I was speechless. He asked me a question: "Didn't your alien ancestors tell you this?" Which one of you told him ? Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 The property our corporate office is located at makes Kool-Aid, so when I get tired of Diet Coke, I go next door and " borrow " some KA from them. However, they switched to this funky flavor that is supposed to be Green Apple with some catchy adjective in front of it. It doesn't taste like any green apples I've ever eaten . And it leaves you with this slightly minty aftertaste. Ick. I'm really sick of it. Oooh, goody! I lucked out and found some CHEESE in the fridge. A discovery like that is always a good find.

 "Yes, children, we used to have blogs. We called them diaries, and they got us into almost as much trouble as yours will get you." (Miss Manners' column, Sunday, July 18, 2004) Miss Manners needs to get out of the 19th century and wake the fuck up. In earlier times, people were told not to air their dirty laundry, most likely because of the shame it might bring them or their families. People also told their children to be quiet about sexual abuse. Or pregnancy. Or alcoholism. Or whatever. Today, we live in a different world. Thank God. Yeah, I chain smoke. Yeah, I drink too much on occasion. Yeah, I like using the word "fuck" a lot. None of this will embarrass me next year, or when I'm 45, or when I'm stumbling around, pissing myself and forgetting to turn off the stove. By the way, I know which fork to use, how to address someone of a more senior stature than myself, and to say, "Excuse me," when I leave the table. I am happier, however, living in a less structured world. I still say excuse me, but if you are rude to me, I won't think twice about telling you exactly how I feel about that. Gone are the June Cleaver days and I say, Good riddance. I don't want to live in a society where we simply do not speak of divorce, or suicide, or drug addiction, or children being born out of wedlock. Or incest. Or homosexuality. Or any of the many other things I remember being told as a child that "we just don't discuss those things." Not by my parents, thankfully. But I sure as hell heard it from a number of adults while growing up. Now I understand Miss Manners is speaking of gossipping about other people. I don't find that in the blogosphere in which I reside. If anything, it seems we're all talking about each other in a flattering way, pumping each other up and doling out encouragement when necessary (and when not so necessary). Maybe I have not crossed over to the Dark Side of Blogging, maybe it exists. That is no reason to condemn an activity that has brought so many people such pleasure, and has provided an outlet for many of us where none previously existed. I say, Blog on, and blog about what you want to. If you use your blog to criticize others, just remember there may very well be consequences. But I still believe in free speech, no matter how much I may disagree with or dislike what the other person is saying, or writing. Meaning this: you are entitled, Miss Manners, to your prehistoric and arcane opinion. It also means that I, too, am entitled to my own opinion, whether it be criticism of others, of myself or just my wandering thoughts. Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 I prefer Chicken, but I suppose I should start learning the lingo. I already know how to lie and to fake that I like people. That's 75% of the job, isn't it? Plus, my hair is MUCH cuter than either one of theirs. I think a blonde President is long overdue. THIS WEEK WENT BY IN DOG YEARS I am so glad to be away from work now. What a fucking long-ass week. By the way, I got out of that Forced Fun Trip to the coast next week because we are simply too busy. Instead, I get to stay behind and fucking work. I'm stress-eating again and that es no bueno. If I really don't want anything between me and my Calvins, I should start utilizing that gym membership I've had for, oh, five months now. But that would get in the way of sitting here on my ever-widening ass, drinking champagne, eating CHEESE pizza and watching Law &amp; Order.

According to Webmiztris , sleeping helps you lose weight. Just hand me some Ambien and get out of my way! I need to drop about 10 pounds before I go swimming next weekend.

I'll lobby for stricter punishment against:&nbsp; animal abusers, pedophiles, child abusers, people who scam the elderly and rabid anti-smokers. I'll follow suit after Leif Wright and legalize marijuana - and tax it.&nbsp;&nbsp; The same goes for prostitution. I will be the Poster Girl for The Immoral Majority. I will outlaw those damned stretch pants and t-shirts sporting redneck sayings.&nbsp; March will be Official Chicken History Month . And I'll keep a laughing Buddha on my desk in the Oval Office, which I will redesign into an octagon shape. The pharmaceutical companies will no longer have as much political power as they do now, and neither will the insurance companies. I'll see to it that Bad Hair Days and PMS are valid reasons for missing:&nbsp; school, personal obligations and work. It will become a national law to SPAY AND NEUTER YOUR PETS , damn it. And while we are at it, maybe we should spay and neuter some of the constituents, too. Hate Crimes will be vindicated.&nbsp; Vodka will become our national beverage.&nbsp; No more sports hero and/or celebrity worship getting you guys off for a crime we all know you committed. Prayer in school?&nbsp; Only if you pray to ME . Rape?&nbsp; We'll just cut it off and that will solve a LOT of problems.

 My dad had the nerve to tell me that I "need to start eating like white folk" at dinner at my parents' house this evening.&nbsp; Except he calls it "supper." I am not white.&nbsp; I'm European-American and Native-American.&nbsp; But I do have white skin.&nbsp; That's only because I'm sure I already did the damage and will die of melanoma if cirrhosis or lung cancer doesn't get me first.&nbsp; So I keep this pasty white look and long for those younger years when I lived in the tanning beds.&nbsp; Back before I realized mortality will happen to me, too. That is when I started drinking.&nbsp; And smoking. "THAT MEANS BEANS AND CORNBREAD" My mother is a hoot.&nbsp; She told my father, "She eats more beans than anyone I know, including you." Older Sibling, RD:&nbsp; "Well, that would explain the gas.&nbsp; Have you tried Beano?" And people wondered why I never introduced boyfriends to my parents as a teenager if I could get away with it. ** For the record, RD is talking about my post-dining burping that goes on anywhere from two to five minutes after every meal. It IS necessary, and in some countries, it's a compliment. CARBS, CARBS AND MORE CARBS I need to start actually eating vegetables (other than beans) if I'm going to be a vegetarian.&nbsp; I count the tomatoes on&nbsp;CHEESE pizza (via the vehicle of a pizza sauce) as one serving.

I will be chastised for not hanging out with the group, but I really don't have anything in common with most of them, so I'll consider this a retreat from work as well as co-workers.&nbsp; I might stay in bed and watch Law & Order, who knows?&nbsp; I will NOT go salsa dancing.&nbsp; I will miss Vicente and the babies.

 Best weekend I've had in a long time! Friday Night Fab D came over, we had a few cocktails and then Vicente arrived.&nbsp; I fell asleep on the dining room table.&nbsp; Dianne woke up at 6:15 Saturday morning, freaking out because she wasn't sure where she was.&nbsp; Vicente and I went to eat eggs and then he left to run errands. Saturday Another Law & Order Marathon.&nbsp; I have a girl crush on Mariska Hargitay.&nbsp; Anyway, that, combined with the Tito's, made for a nap in the afternoon.&nbsp; Vicente wakes me up at 6:30 and shit, we were supposed to be going to my new favorite bar, Lee Harvey's, to watch Oliver's Army play at seven. Saturday Night We made it there a little before ten. This was after V waited on me getting myself all girly, being caught being a Peeping Tom by my neighbor (I was looking at his chickens) and three shots of Tito's so the bar tab wouldn't be so high. It was anyway. That last audio post was Oliver's Army, playing Folsom Prison Blues.&nbsp; Lee Harvey's is in the middle of a really bad part of Dallas, but it's so cool and there were several trendy couples there.&nbsp; Myself being half of one.&nbsp; Well, not really. We sat outside amongst the fucking bonfires they decided to set (only bad part of the evening), listened to Elvis Costello covers, one Johnny Cash song and a part of "Rebel Rebel."&nbsp; The guard dog next door was this pussy of a Pit Bull who gave me kisses and got his back scratched.&nbsp; The rawhide bone (1/2 was left) he was gnawing on was bigger than Buzzy. Some really hot girl was inside, pole dancing (you could see her through the window), so I went on in and joined her.&nbsp; I think that made Vicente's evening.&nbsp; Our waitress was cool, and we laughed at Vicente and how he was trying to push all my buttons.&nbsp; I went into it with a good attitude and didn't lose it with him, as is usual when alcohol and gigs are involved. There was some crankhead across the street who stood under&nbsp;the porch light of some seedy little apartments, his nasty bright green t-shirt pulled up to show off his large pot belly.&nbsp; I thought it would be a terrific idea if I crossed the street to talk to him (mind you, this was after the three shots at my house and the three I'd already had at Lee Harvey's), but Vicente vetoed that bright idea.&nbsp; Crankhead walked off through the pseudo parking lot, probably out to score some more. He reminded me of Chocolate, the guy we met last year at Daytona Beach.&nbsp; Except Chocolate was better looking and funny as hell. Early Sunday Morning, Around 3:30 Vicente, Paddy Mac and I all agreed it was time to find a better late-night breakfast place.&nbsp; I think my ass-illness today is a combination of all that vodka and the greasy food I got at the Metro Diner.&nbsp; Still, for entertainment value, it rates a ten.&nbsp; I've put on a few really good performances there myself. This morning, I wasn't the main attraction. Dreadlock Boys were seated catty-cornered to us, and had just been served while we were on our way out.&nbsp; Walking by, I paused, picked up a tater tot off Dreadlock's plate, dipped it in ketchup and asked, "Do you mind?"&nbsp; Typically, people get a kick out of this.&nbsp; Judging by his pithy remark, I'm surprised he didn't follow me into the parking lot and jack me.&nbsp; I believe he was too stoned to stand up. Sunday Morning I did not feel well this a.m. and it wasn't because I drank too much.&nbsp; It was the early breakfast.&nbsp; Ugh.&nbsp; But finally getting a fully-leaded Coke down, and then the vegetable plate at Cheddar's helped. Ah, but then I faced my greatest fear - the D word in a public restroom. I was going to opt out of the hike scheduled post-lunch, but got called a pussy by Vicente and Paddy Mac.&nbsp; Two miles in the middle of the afternoon, 70% of it FUCKING UPHILL, I get a little cranky.&nbsp; But I did so much better than the Tyler State Park Camping Incident.&nbsp; Thank God there were no geese around to chase me. Vicente did keep chunking rocks into the trees, then thinking out loud to Paddy that perhaps we were being followed by a coyote. Now here I sit, sweaty and stinky and feeling really good.&nbsp;&nbsp;I plan on hiking every weekend.&nbsp; (Yeah, that'll last about, oh, seven days.) VODKA CHEESE My gratis to Who Hymn for the vodka cheese information.&nbsp; Pisser: &nbsp; CHEESE, CHEESE, CHEESE CHEESE CHEESE! My thighs are aching, my sinuses are bothering me and I am craving some CHEESE pizza.&nbsp; Other than that, I had the most fabulous time this weekend. Coming attractions:&nbsp; We decided we will go on the Cozumel cruise after all! Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 I don't have a Dalmatian, though.&nbsp; Just three crazy Min Pins.&nbsp; And a Sephora addiction. UGH For some reason (probably because my pot roast is the best you will ever have, if you're lucky enough to have some), Paddy Mac wants me to prepare his Angus beef rump roast tonight.&nbsp; Ick.&nbsp; I really don't have any desire to go through this again but I'm a good big sister, so I will. Sometimes, I get some pleasure from patting the rump . For those of you carnivores out there, my rump roast rocks .&nbsp; You will want to swim in my juices . CURIOSITY KILLED THE CAT -&nbsp;GOOD THING I'M A CHICKEN I started thinking today, I wonder what all these people who write blogs do for a living? &nbsp; I wonder why some of us are so lucky (Pisser) that they can blog, blog, BLOG at work (and scan pink plastic monkeys) and not get caught. Whereas I'm lucky to sneak a comment in while people are in the office. Every job I've had (with the exception of this one and one other), we had Free Days .&nbsp; Days where you could fuck off all day long and not get fired for it.&nbsp; Once, I left with Stinky to finish off the jello shots my mom and I made for her bday at Vicente's office (pre-Vicente, I didn't even know him then) and three hours later, I strolled back in the office and my boss wanted a word with me.&nbsp; "I just want you to know how happy we are with you and how lucky we feel that you work with us."&nbsp; Shit.&nbsp; I'll take more Dirty Martini Lunches , then. &nbsp; Heh! A lot of people said the determining factor for hiring me (besides the fact that I am The Most Fabulous ) was that I could bring a sense of fun to the job. Now my biggest "fun" is picking at my toenails and wishing I could dye my hair pink and pierce my nose. DELETE Oh, have I learned the trauma of (a) not deleting something personal on my computer and some co-worker/git finds it and (II) sending a scathing&nbsp;email about someone and accidentally including them on the To: line. I found a poem written by a co-worker/git today.&nbsp;&nbsp;Christ.&nbsp; And I thought my young angst-ridden love poetry bullshit full-of-shit crap was bad.&nbsp; I'M GOING TO CATCH A LOT OF FLACK FOR THIS BUT WHAT THE FUCK STP did a MUCH better job with "Dancing Days" than Zeppelin did.&nbsp; Scottie is my one Star Fucker weakness. I have a thing for people whose lives are more messed up than mine. YOU ARE MY FLOWER , YOU ARE MY POWER I'm still so grateful to Smiley for telling that story.&nbsp; I think Vicente is jealous of only one other guy and it's a skinny, ex-addict (for now)&nbsp;who could really use some good skincare products.&nbsp; Scottie, what about Botox?&nbsp; "Beer made me what I am today."&nbsp; God, I will always have this immense crush on him. BUT I'M A CREEP, I'M A WEIRDO Ah, but you all knew that .&nbsp; I wish I was special. NO PITHY TITLE I think this is it until Sunday.&nbsp; Ah, Vicente is back.&nbsp; Sigh. Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 You gotta love Smiley... Stolen from Ms. Opinionated FIVE THOUGHTS FOR FRIDAY Next to getting to spend time with Vicente again, the things I look most forward to this weekend is simply not thinking at all, spending time with the babies, seeing Fab D tonight, wearing no makeup, coloring my hair and having cocktails . I feel bloated.&nbsp; And I have garlic breath.&nbsp; And my angel hair pasta with marinara sauce I had at lunch was disappointing.&nbsp; The tiramisu was good, though, right Bunny?&nbsp; (Hey, don't forget to ask me about&nbsp; The Boston Tiramisu Incident I mentioned at lunch today.&nbsp; It involves me, Vicente, some delicious tiramisu and Mary/Lisa never being able to order that dessert again after hearing about it.) I'm tired.&nbsp; I feel older than I am today.&nbsp; Quite possibly this comes from getting to work at fucking seven o'clock.&nbsp; Note to self:&nbsp; Don't pull that shit again. I got a ticket this week.&nbsp; And I'm Sephora-broke so I have down to the wire to take care of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whee, I live my life on the edge.&nbsp; I thought I was supposed to feel this depressed and blah BEFORE my period, not after.&nbsp; Thank God for champagne... Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 Yea, Vicente gets back tonight! He said he wanted a good night's sleep to recover from the Offspring's visit so I told him not to bother trying to get&nbsp;sleep at the Coop.&nbsp; Between my flagrant sexual advances towards him and my three psychotic dogs, good luck with that. So he's going home, turning off the phone (damn, no drunk dialing!) and "sleeping until (he) wakes up."&nbsp; Then we're off to see Oliver's Army play tomorrow night, and either the pool or Blue Goose on Sunday. I am craving eggs over medium.&nbsp; But I love BG's fish tacos.&nbsp; What a food dilemma. LUNCH WITH A BUNCH OF ANIMALS Yep, that's right folks.&nbsp; If you, too, were dining at Gennie's Bishop Grill, you might see a Chicken, a Bunny and a Monkey eating together.&nbsp; Maybe we will audiopost over mashed potatoes and gravy.&nbsp; Thank God for veggie plates at a place that brags about its chicken fried steaks (shudder). Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 Vicente called at 6:13 this morning (I had been up since four and felt it wise not to go back to bed) and began harrassing me immediately.&nbsp; I got to work at 7:15.&nbsp; Too bad my boss is on vacation - she would have had a coronary had I strolled in at that hour. WHEN THE SHIT HITS THE FAN I guess it is a good thing I got in early.&nbsp; It is now 9:47 a.m. and I'm just now getting back to this.&nbsp;&nbsp;It looks like this might the&nbsp;only post of the (work) day. BIG THANKS TO SMILEY I loved the STP story!&nbsp; Whatever happened to the two bitches? &nbsp; Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 I want a fully-leaded Coke really badly.&nbsp; Like I jones for a cigarette.&nbsp; I just don't want to have to drive over to the laundry room in this heat to get one from the machine.&nbsp; No one in this office drinks regular sodas. I have tonight and tomorrow evening to clean my house before Vicente comes back.&nbsp; I will NOT turn on the TV.&nbsp; I will NOT turn on the TV.&nbsp; Damn Law & Order! DAMN, COULDN'T YOU AT LEAST HAVE SAVED SOME FOR ME? Paddy Mac wasn't happy that I drank the last LITTLE bit (like two shots' worth) of his vodka.&nbsp; Which is probably why I fell asleep so early and on the couch, under three dogs.&nbsp; Then I woke at 7:32 (Paddy was probably still pissed so I guess he thought he wouldn't wake my moochy ass up), took a quick bath, didn't have time to do my hair from scratch and left with a headache. I still have that damned headache. VACATION, ALL I EVER WANTED My boss is off for Vegas tonight and won't come back until Monday night.&nbsp; Which means I will be all alone in the office here (my assistant, her sister, is babysitting at my boss' house).&nbsp; I hate being here alone.&nbsp; I swear, this place is haunted.&nbsp; One of our properties is, so they probably hitched a ride with the manager when she brought stuff to corporate. FUCK IT I'm going to get that damned Coke. Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 Yes, Bunny, I'm up again in the middle of the night. My fingertips ache because I yanked off (gnawed off) all my nails in order to be ready for a new set today.&nbsp; I wanna be Victoria Principal when I grow up, Daddy. I'LL HAVE WHAT SHE'S HAVING Someone I know has lost a hell of a lot of weight, never eats, hardly sleeps, and seems to think she's still fat.&nbsp; Is anorexia supposed to hit you in your late 30s??? Don't use me as an example.&nbsp; I got started young. I DON'T THINK I EVER TOLD THIS STORY One fine Saturday morning earlier this year, I sat watching some really stupid movie, enthralled with its ridiculousness, mesmerized by the television.&nbsp; Paddy Mac walked by, did a double-take and asked, "Why is Nico doing that?" I looked up right as the little guy lifted his leg and marked me as his territory. And people wonder why my babies run this house? Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 Queen being the operative word.&nbsp; I so loved Freddie Mercury. Here are five things I know to be true: (at least for Non-Girlfriend) 1) I will always try to save an animal in need 2) I hate the way I look and probably will until I die 3) God is in me...he's all around me - I'm losing (I've lost my religion) 4) Seinfeld should have cut and run about two years before they actually did 5) Vicente is the one person I've ever found that can:&nbsp; make me laugh my ass off, sing Thompson Twins songs to me and I don't retch, build me a super sandwich (knowing my peccadillos about sandwich making), know when to shut up or supply my ass with liquor, love everything about me (even the bad things, like the lack of short-term memory, the incoherent babbling and the obsession with makeup/clothes/shoes/purses/accessories).

 Not only did we drink too much, but we yelled at future ex-convicts, gave police information and drunk-dialed my non-boyfriend a little too much. Here's to not having your Offspring around and drinking too much at your girlfriend's house.&nbsp; The cops want a written statement.&nbsp; Mary/Lisa lets him in the Coop and&nbsp;I come back inside with a glass of wine and a cigarette.&nbsp; "Nice touch," says Vicente.&nbsp; &nbsp;I'm feeling the need to purchase pink flamingos, quickly.&nbsp; Thank God none of my tatoos were showing - that would have completed the picture.

 I'm converting to Timmyism.&nbsp; In Timmy's world, hell is a place void of alcohol and laughter, and filled with paper cups. &nbsp; I'll be His Disciple of CHEESE .&nbsp; And tomatoes .&nbsp; I will travel the southwest for Him and spread the word of Timmy.&nbsp; He is proof that God truly does have a sense of humor. &nbsp; AMEN &nbsp; I got booted out of the TV/Dog Room because Paddy Mac was sick of my Law &amp; Order Marathon.&nbsp; Funny, he doesn't pay the sattellite bill but oh well, to be fair, and sense he brought me Cokes and Marlboros, I decided to come in here surf a bit.&nbsp; That's when I learned of The Second Coming .&nbsp; You see, Timmy/Jesus doesn't have blog diarrhea like I do, so I know it's safe to go a day or so without checking his site.&nbsp; (Timmy, someone asked me that last week, too, about having a case of the Mondays...I don't look so hot in orange so I decided not to kill them.&nbsp; Yet.) &nbsp; THE BUZZY DANCE &nbsp; Whenever Buzzy wants something, or has to pee, he does this circle dance.&nbsp; If it's the Urination Issue, he doesn't growl.&nbsp; However, if it is the CHEESE Pizza Issue, he growls in a threatening and downright menacing manner.&nbsp; And snaps my fingers if I give him some crust. &nbsp; It's not like the damn dogs are starving or anything.&nbsp; I would guess these babies live better than 75% of our population.&nbsp; And don't chastise me for that.&nbsp; The next time your fucking spoiled-ass rugrat throws a fit in public, remember this:&nbsp; my barking dogs stay at home. &nbsp; FUCK IT ALL &nbsp; Yes, folks, it's That Time Of The Month again.&nbsp; And I'm in a bad mood.&nbsp; Actually, as Vicente says, That Time Of The Month is no different from the other three weeks but what does he know?&nbsp; He has a penis.&nbsp; (A quite lovely one at that.) &nbsp; Here is what I'm pissed off about (like any of you asked, but fuck it, I'm gonna tell you anyway): &nbsp; * I'm pissed that I don't like my job more (I'm sick of numbers!) * I'm pissed that Chris Noth is all the way up in NYC and I'm down here * I'm pissed that I cannot live on wine and cheese and tomatoes alone * (I actually do live on that, which pisses other people off) * I'm pissed Sparky got sick and died the way he did * I'm pissed that the fucking lowlifes who live around my office don't spay and neuter their pets, and let them run freely throughout the property * I'm pissed that smoking is bad for you * Ditto on the alcohol * I'm pissed Leif Wright isn't our President * I'm pissed that my shopping "problem" doesn't afford me to hire a housekeeper * I'm pissed that some people I know try to infect me with their lousy moods and get angry when I don't catch it * I'm pissed that I don't work on The Morning Edge, because they laugh all the time * I'm pissed that no one at my office except my assistant laughs on a regular basis * I'm pissed that I don't get paid to blog * I'm pissed they took "Charlie's Angels" off the air * I'm pissed that I didn't listen to my parents the last time I bought a car * I'm pissed that I am about to get my period * I'm pissed they didn't yank that shit out when they had me open those eight times * I'm pissed (and fortunate) there isn't a Sephora near me * I'm pissed I'm not drinking spiked mango snowcones with Bunny by the pool &nbsp; Okay, that's enough.&nbsp; People might get confused and think they stumbled over to Pisser's instead. &nbsp; Damn it, if I can't watch Law &amp; Order, I might as well visit Crime Library. &nbsp; Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 Can one have a hangover from too much sleep ? I just woke up at 2 p.m. and felt like the world's biggest slacker.&nbsp; Okay, so I tried watching "Just Married" earlier and had to turn it off&nbsp;(the dead dog scene was not the clincher - I just hate Ashton Kutcher).&nbsp; I had no more Law &amp; Order to view, and I think I stayed up until about three a.m. ONLY ONE PACK OF CIGS LEFT AND NO MORE COKE I'm much more addicted to caffeine than I am nicotine. In fact, ask Mary/Lisa. She will tell you that I never inhale. Okay, I lie, I&nbsp;inhaled this past week and started coughing so hard I thought I might hack up a hairball. 99% of the time, though, the smoke never gets past my teeth. It's an oral fixation. God only knows what I'd do with my mouth and my hands if I didn't have my Marlboros. No recommendations here, boys. I'd probably just drink more or chew on my fingers. IPECAC IS OUR FRIEND I'm so trying not to throw up right now. Bunny, I know about the Cold Vomiting. But what about the Too Much Sleep Vomiting? Suddenly, I feel the need for a nap. I think I should just go back to bed... MEMORIES Paddy Mac dragged out some old photos of himself and of me.&nbsp; Sadly, in 1995, I still had 80s Hair. Then there is the picture of me, RD and Paddy when Paddy was a screaming baby (at least his mouth was wide open), RD was a torturous older brother, and I sat on top of one of those vintage breakfast tables with my curly blonde ringlets, pouting. I'm still pouting today. There was also a photo from Christmas 1990, where Paddy looked like the lead singer for some garage band, RD was slightly thinner with a moustache, and I looked like I had just escaped from Auschwitz.

 I think I was reading too much Joan Didion at the time. &nbsp; And sleeping in the campus library, missing classes. &nbsp; I remember being questioned about taking a senior-level Lit class and I was only a Sophomore.&nbsp; Hell, I didn't take Algebra or Biology or anything else for at least a year. &nbsp; I wanted to read . &nbsp; I had a class where I had to read 1.75 novels per week to even think about passing.&nbsp; I bullshitted my way through the class, got called on it by the prof, but he liked my essays so much, he gave me a B, "even though I know you didn't read the material." &nbsp; I lived for reading. &nbsp; When I was a child, my mother had to make me play outside.&nbsp; I would go through two books in one day.&nbsp; In first grade, I was humiliated .&nbsp; They made me read fifth grade books by myself because I finished the entire year's reading the first six weeks.&nbsp; I started pretending to be dumb. &nbsp; But I still kept reading.&nbsp; &nbsp; My older brother used to introduce me to his friends:&nbsp; "She's the good looking one, I'm the smart one."&nbsp; As if the two could never co-exist.&nbsp;&nbsp; Pfeh! &nbsp; Joan figured heavily in the second semester of my Freshman year and I was convinced I was a writer. &nbsp; What killed that was getting married.&nbsp; Twice. &nbsp; Then in 1995, I came up with a list late one night, over CHEESE pizza and tequila ( imagine that!) and I started writing again.&nbsp; Off and on, over the past nine years, writing has been my therapist, my savior, my partner, my way of expressing myself safely.&nbsp; Lush. would have never been conceived had I felt the same fear I did pre-1995. &nbsp; Thank God for new beginnings, eh? &nbsp; Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 No, I am not. Not right now, at least. Give me 14 hours. I'm gonna need it today. Fell asleep on my Law & Order date. S'okay, they understand. I have all weekend to watch it. I'm depressed. My bank LOVES me, however, so I should feel all warm and fuzzy inside. Due to my miscalculation, my bank made $165 off me on overdraft protection fees. Shit, and it was for small purchases, the largest being $5.39. I suck at $$$-related things. I really should give myself a weekly allowance and leave my debit card at home. But I won't. SOMEDAY, EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE BETTER FOR ME That would be after this weekend, when my brother strips and rebuilds my ill computer. I've tried to visit my favorite blogs but the damned thing freezes up and porn pops up on my screen. The only time I can check them is at work, where "down time" is not an option, not even for five minutes. Next week should be better. I miss posting and reading - goddamned computer viruses. Sometimes, it even eats my posts. PROCRASTINATION I think my hair has already dried. Not good. Could be time to quit and get ready for work, no? Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 I'm dedicating this Wednesday to my date with Law & Order later on. I made a deal with myself this morning: one good domestic act each evening entitles me to do whatever the FUCK I wanna do for the remainder of the evening. Tonight, I am cleaning the larger of the two bathrooms. Then I'm watching back-to-back Law & Order, consuming copious amounts of really, really cheap sparkling wine, and snuggling with my babies . (I agree with Pisser - they ARE my children and if that bothers you, you can suck their asses. Wait, you can suck MINE, as theirs are probably much cleaner given the amount of time they spend licking them.) Then I'm going to post on my blog on my fucked-up computer THAT MY OLDER BROTHER WON'T FIX, GODDAMNIT! (Dawnie, if you are reading this, please pass on this subtle hint to your husband.)

 Okay, so I copied PETA on that title, but you should see the bumper sticker - it's hilarious! It's this evil looking chicken holding what appears to be some sort of semi-automatic rifle. I had no idea that meat producers in the U.S. fed cows, pig and chickens to well, to cows, pigs and chickens. Cows are herbivores...this makes no sense to me. I guess because I am one, too. Well, I'm an Ovo-Lactum vegetarian, but only free-range eggs and organic milk or soy milk. Still working on the cheese so I don't feel like a hypocrite. I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD SEE THE DAY Culottes (gaucho pants) are back. For those of you who are too young to remember these, please do not think this is a new and exciting look. Basically, it is a divided skirt. Culottes are ugly. And they are in stores near you. Scary. LOOKS LIKE VACATION MIGHT BE MORE LIKE A LONG WEEKEND ROAD TRIP Fuck the Bahamas, too expensive. Don't think either one of us will get the time to go on the Mexican cruise. I guess it's the Texas coast for us. At least there will be SUN. I'M REALLY CRAVING CORN ON THE COB At 10:27 in the morning. As Vicente tells me, "You're going to a mental institution." I think I'm already there. Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 I tried to get my nails done at lunch today, but my girl was out having surgery on her Adam's Apple??? So I go buy some champagne, dog treats and scoot on back to work. I heard Jane's Addiction on the way, which brought back memories of the Sparkster. The first time he heard the dog barking at the beginning of "Been Caught Stealing," he hated Perry Farrell's voice. It did not matter which JA song came on, he would start growling and lunge at the stereo. I had to stop leaving the radio on for him while I was at work because, inevitably, I would hear that damned song on the way in. Funny how you forget things like that and then are suddenly propelled back into your past. I must have been grinning like an idiot on my drive into work this afternoon. WORK SUCKS My NON-boyfriend and I (lest you all get upset again) were talking this morning about how much we don't like to work. How inconvenient it is that we have to go in the office Monday through Friday. My best friend and I were talking about it last night. And a good friend, Banana Pillow, and I spoke this morning. We are all miserable. LITTLE PITCHERS HAVE BIG MOUTHS Apparently my boss' daughter told her our entire conversation last Thursday when I was dropping her off at her mother's meeting about 45 minutes away. "I didn't know you were a vegetarian. I've seen you eat meat." Not since around December but I guess all my talk about complete proteins and forced molting have fallen on deaf ears. YAWN Looks like another exciting weekend at the Coop. Totally spaced about Fab D's trip to the coast and I don't really feel like salsa dancing, so it looks like a hot date with Law & Order again. No one but Fab D can ever really get me too interested in going out at night, but Bunny can always talk me into coffee and shopping on Fridays. Bun, you interested? I won't have to rush back this week or the next... Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 Okay, girls, I slipped up. He's really my non-boyfriend. Sorry for the confusion! Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 Normally, I wear some cute little ensemble to work but this morning, I overslept so jeans it was. I'm putting them on and wondering why the fuck they're tighter than they used to be last week, when I bought them, and then it dawns on my blondeness: duh, it's that damned 12-pack of fully leaded Coke I drank Saturday and Sunday. Well, I think Fab D had one of them but please, that many? What a pig! The way I figure it, I had over 1,500 empty calories, killed off another little piece of my liver and moved that much closer to adult diabetes. Not bad for one weekend. I FEEL NEKKID My cell phone died overnight and I plugged it in to recharge (I wish I had something I could plug myself into to recharge) and left the damned thing at home. Heh heh. It's liberating. I hate that fucking cell phone (at least for work calls, I do). I saw someone eating Kool-Aid with a spoon. Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 I'm about to fall asleep on my three Min Pins right now. What the hell am I doing up so early on a weekend?! Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 or Why I Am The Most Boring Person On This Planet I just spent all day doing this: watching old reruns of Law & Order, sleeping and not much else. It's 7 p.m. now and I feel like going back to bed. In all honesty, I think I came down with something, as I'm running back and forth between the couch and the bathroom (when I'm awake) and I'm parched, like I just went through some Bataan Death March or something. I have a low-grade fever and the chills. It doesn't look like a good party night for Chicken. ROOTS No, not that television mini series. My HAIR. Ugh. I'm beginning to think my hair is more brown than blonde. Ick. Must color hair before leaving house again. After I throw up one more time. BRUSH, FLOSS AND VISIT YOUR DENTIST TWICE A YEAR I swear I was never this sick until that goddamned abscessed tooth last year. That infection entered my brain and killed my short-term memory. It also weakened my immune system. Plus now, instead of brushing five times a day, it's more like eight or nine. I'm obsessed with my teeth. FUCK THIS SHIT, I'M GOING BACK TO BED My boss should be happy. I wait until the weekend to become ill. Damn. Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 Life doesn't get much more exciting than this! FOF really bombed, mainly because co-worker who lives to work was there when I brought in the Buzz Man. I hate workaholics. Why can't they get a life like the rest of us slackers? My assistant told me Buzzy sure has gotten fat. Then she added (lest I become offended, I'm sure) that he looked "really healthy." My reply? "No, he doesn't. He looks like a summer sausage." I'm quite sure the Min Pin Mafia will be coming after me, but it's not like any of my babies can't walk or something bad like that. They just have cute little fat rolls on their back. You can't even pinch an inch. SOMEBODY STOP ME BEFORE I START WATCHING LIFETIME MOVIE NETWORK! Tiffany Amber Thiesen is on. This can't be good.

 Hey, I spent the first 18 months on this job working until I'm sick and bed-ridden for two weeks. I ain't about to start that wack shit again. And I was gonna leave at five but my boss' own mother wouldn't drive her granddaughter out to where my boss was stuck in a meeting. Guess who did? Yeah, yeah, nominate me for the Nobel Peace Prize if you get around to it. TOMORROW IS THE OFFICIAL FIRST EVER FUCK OFF FRIDAY At least at this job it is. Things to do on day boss is out of town: * Blog quite a bit (sorry Timmy!) * Take Buzzy to work with me for part of the day * Update insurance schedule (yawn), so it looks like I actually did something * Take long lunch at Toshio's with Mary/Lisa * Feel like puking from overeating on the way back in * Realize I didn't buy liquor for the Cones and Pedicures party; drive into Dallas and pick up VODKA * Leave work early and go shopping with Mom for party treats (nothing but fattening carbs and CHEESE) * Go home and frantically clean bathrooms and fold clothes STILL lying on dining room table since I know damn good and well I will not do them tonight! * Refrain from drinking until Fab D and Bun arrive, as I would like to be awake when they get here (Ninsi, you can come, too - I'll make sure one is a chaperone and monitors my alcoholic intake quite closely) * Play with the brats, er babies, until company arrives * Smoke at least fifteen cigarettes by the time they get here * Convince all party-goers that we must drunken audioblog at least three times Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 Was finally organized enough this morning to bring my own lunch and some snacks. Now I am absolutely full from my tomato bisque, to which I added sun-dried tomato, basil and cracked black pepper feta cheese. Mmmmm. Earlier and later, I had/will have more hummus. I'm being good and dipping celery in it rather than eating it on crackers. Wow, now I sound like Who Hymn? with all his detailed descriptions of lunches and dinners!

 I just ate three and a half slices of some slightly well-done CHEESE pizza. Okay, they were small pieces, but still. Oink.

 True story. Three of my co-workers were really stressed on Monday. Probably because they had to work on a holiday, but that's beside the point. They decide to take a late lunch. At lunch, they thought, "Fuck it, let's have a margarita." One margarita turned into two, and then they proceeded to a few different bars. You know how they have those annoying bowls of stale popcorn at some bars? Well, J was nibbling on some, and a piece of it got stuck in her throat. She's coughing, trying in vain to get rid of the piece of popcorn, to make it go down or cough it back up. J leaves for the bathroom, where she can try to retrieve the irritating little piece in private. She vomits all over the bathroom floor. V heads to the bathroom to help her friend, fearful that she might choke. She runs into the bathroom, slips on V's vomit, and falls flat on her ass. Meanwhile, S goes to the bathroom to see what is going on and finds V on the floor with J, sitting in what was left of V's lunch. Damn, where is a camera phone when you need one?

 First of all , I had to work on a national holiday (well, I got Friday off, but still, I could have gone swimming with Candace and Dale). Second , still no word from the Increasingly Silent Vicente. (Chicken is worried.) Third , my mom made her pot roast and I just wanted to bob for apples in her homemade gravy but restrained myself. Last , but certainly not least , I finished on the most incredibly boring project I've probably ever taken on, or at least in several years. I don't like working with numbers, I don't like analyzing them, either. I do, however, LOVE making suggestions, so that part was actually fun. Maybe I should get a job making recommendations to others? So for all of you slackers who spent the day by the pool, or cooking out, or sleeping in, or just generally fucking off, I hate you. No, not really. I'm just insanely jealous. HERE'S A FAIR RHETORICAL QUESTION FOR YA: Suppose your best friend, or even a close one, asked you if you minded if she went out with your boyfriend from the twelvth grade (supposing also that you are in your late twenties, so it's not like he's a recent memory). Although you do not want her to, you say yes. In fact, you encourage it. You even teasingly call her silly when she expresses concern that it might make you feel bad, or uncomfortable. Then when she goes out with him, you get mad and stop speaking to her. Is this fair? Okay...gotta go finish totally boring project and fold clothes. Bleah . Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 MONDAY'S INTEREST LEVEL: 89.27 Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 Even though it is not Dedication Wednesday, I'm sending this one out to you, Vicente. DAILY UPDATE Interest Level (scale of 1 - 10): 73 I told you, I am proving a point . Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 I'm stuffed from lunch again. Went down to my parents' house to not eat hamburgers and hotdogs with my immediate family, my cousin and her family (her daughter has triplets). THE POTATO SALAD WAS GOOD I also ate one really huge tomato. Some baked beans (vegetarian - at least I hope they were...may have to call mom). Lots of CHEESE. Oh and five pickles. I did not partake in the Fourth of July chocolate cake my mother made because, well, because I just wanted another tomato. HAD TO LEAVE THE TABLE Husband of Cousin raises Labs. "There's no use for a dog for me unless he can retrieve." I can only hope he was being facetious when he said that it might be dead when he returns to LA. Ahem . Then he proceeded to explain just how he trains the puppies to retrieve. With live pigeons (oh, their wings are clipped, this is just a puppy you know, can't expect him to catch a live bird with fully functional wings now, can you?). This was after my Second Cousin, mother of aforementioned Triplets, described in GREAT detail what her uncle's melanoma looked like before he succumbed to a horrific death. While I was eating . I guess having babies (especially three at one time) makes your stomach less "unstable." For the rest of us, there is always Prilosec. Suddenly, I was overcome with the feeling of pressure to procreate. Must stay away from childhood home for at least a month, lest I start ovulating again. GET A CLUE: Please do not share your hunting-and-gathering techniques with a vegetarian. (And yes, he did know beforehand.) Other than that, things were great. Second Cousin seems more laid-back than the last time I visited La-La Land, which seemed counter-intuitive, since she has triplets. Then my mom told me she is on medication. Well, hell, aren't we all ? ( In at least one form or another ) Oh, who the fuck am I to judge? I drink, chain-smoke and drunk dial my nonboyfriend (and get posts from exes that piss nonBF off... thanks a lot - you know who you are). Plus I'm usually the first one down for the count. SECOND COUSIN AND LITTER ARE MOVING TO TEXAS Yes, they are leaving their 1.5 million dollar Huntington Beach home to live in Southlake. Why don't they do a trial run first? Come live in my 1,400 square foot, 45-year old, three bedroom house - I have a large yard for the Trips to play in. I'll stay in your museum-like house (not because it's necessarily huge, it's just one of those houses in which you feel as though you can't touch anything ) and see how my Min Pins like Los Angeles. I'll sit in the jacuzzi and drink vodka tonics while making sure I wrinkle up like an old hag by the time I'm 40. At least I'll have a tan. BUT WILL I COME BACK TALKING LIKE THAT? Sorry, but I like my Texas ack-sent. And that is exactly how I pronounce it. No, I do NOT use the word "fixin." Please, I am not ignorant . Irony: After my first divorce, I was seriously thinking of moving out there. Thank the gods of reason and alcohol I didn't. SECOND COUSIN TOLD ME I LOOK EXACTLY LIKE I DID SEVEN YEARS AGO, WHEN I LAST SAW HER Well, now, that certainly was worth having to listen to a couple of the hunting techniques. God, I love moisturizer (especially the No-Age by Dior , but that's another post entirely). I HAVE TRIPLETS, TOO They were all just born at different times. From different mommas. Sounds kinda ghetto, doesn't it? And no, I don't know my babies' daddies. My favorite (I don't care if you aren't supposed to have one) is Madison. She is the fraternal Trip. The other two are quiet, shy and look exactly alike. Madison is like a mini version of me. Kinda of bossy, but really cute so you sorta overlook that. She has beautiful, naturally curly hair (and knows it), and she told me that my niece said I was her "silly aunt." I told Cousin about my t-shirts, but not my blog. Kinda get this feeling their lives are pretty G-rated, or at least PG-13, whereas mine turned up being NC-17 when I took that quiz. Naughty bitch that I am. Shit, what if they read it? I GOT THE EVIL EYEBALL TODAY. I told my mother that I was not a built-in babysitter - this was after I was told to talk to my niece because she was making elaborate plans for the two of us when I told her I was having company over tonight. That girl is like a fucking Jehovah's Witness until she gets what she wants. Kind of like her aunt. The silly one. FIREWORKS - CAUTION Kiddos, please use caution when playing with potentially deadly explosives tonight and tomorrow night. Bear in mind...these things blow up . Sometimes they take a finger or two with them. Or half a face. A la Buffalo Bill. Don't aim the Roman Candles at your sister, Johnny. And Caroline, the sparkler is not intended for internal use, I don't care what you saw at the fair. KIDS, DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME I'm a sort of cautionary tale, so I think I'll take the Non-Girlfriend Show on the road. We certainly need many more American versions of the AbFab girls.

 I'm calling my mortgage company today and finding out about splitting the damned house payment into two per month. Why is it that everything is due at the same time? Don't the gods of finance know I cannot hold onto that extra cash I have at the middle of the month, but will instead go out and buy shoes? Mary/Lisa got on to me about the shoes. But she did the same thing when she had extra cash. Now she is waiting for her house to be finished so she can move in. Now she too knows the joy of owning a home: no money. At least I'm getting a new bathroom floor tomorrow. It only cost me $39 and a carton of cigarettes (bribe money for the maintenance guy to install it). I have decided against the wainscoting and think now I will just do the textured wallpaper that you can paint, and do some funky paint treatment on that. And no, you cannot help me paint. I intend to lock myself up in that tiny shoebox they call a full bath and get high while doing home improvements. See? I'm so broke I cannot even afford decent drugs. Damn.

 I thought better about posting the first part of this entry. LET'S STICK WITH SAFE SUBJECTS Bunny and I have plans tomorrow to meet and eat and then Sephora ourselves silly. Actually, I have set myself a budget of $30 (maybe I'll get some eyeshadow and a lip gloss) because I am broke broke BROKE. Goddamned mortgage payments! Feh! Afterwards, I must clean the Coop because even I am beginning to be irritated by the filth and clutter. Plus, the tile goes in on Saturday. And then there's the Fourth, and I am quite sure everyone will love to see a clean house, especially if they think I might be cooking (I won't be).

 Yes, Virginia, there really IS such a thing as too much joy. (When it comes in the form of eating pizza late at night and doing vodka shots with your nonboyfriend.) At least I've kept my grilled cheese sandwich down (so far). Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 Fabulous night with Vicente. He decided that instead of "tipsy" he would call me "titsy." I think I like that better. Can someone be jealous of a blog? I think he is. (He shouldn't be. I can't have sex with a blog.) STILL REMAINS Yes, Bunny, that is the same STP song. "Our bed we live, our bed we sleep" - that is one of the best fucking songs ever. I HATE INSOMNIA At least I am not sleep-golfing like Donnie Darko. TREE FROGS, STRANGE LITTLE EARRINGS AND CHEESE PIZZA My gift from the trip to Yosemite: no, not a shot glass this time (although I ALWAYS welcome those) - I have a darling, tiny sterling silver frog around my neck. This is a private, inside joke I will not share. Suffice it to say, the first time I told V the story, he laughed his ass off. But it only comes across that well in person. EVICTION I got threatened with "I'm going home" if I don't get my ass back to bed. Damn, he must have heard me typing! Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 Chicken is flying solo tonight, so I won't frighten the fish with my horrific voice. Please do not judge Ms. Fab D - she actually has a beautiful voice. It's just when mine overpowers hers, you can't tell. I'm too tired and too stressed to write about anything right now. Didn't get home from work until 7:15. Now I must go tend to the babies, who are pouting in the other room because I've been on the phone since I got home. Blah. That's how I feel. Maybe I'll write something interesting later on...

 Congrats on your new Non-Kato Status! Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 Blatant ass-kissing to follow. Vicente is coming over tonight (yea) and so is Fab D. Supposedly, I am going to receive The Most Fabulous Present that V got me while he was out in Oakland (hopefully, it's not a STD). First he says I'm The Meanest, then he says he'll just show me a picture and it will be a Christmas gift, then he says he's witholding it completely until the Yuletide season since I don't allow him to accumulate points for gifts given during the year. I'll weasel it out of him tonight. I hope it's Jelly Bellys or a picture of a chicken. SOMETHING'S MISSING ALL RIGHT Now every time I check out Liz's blog, I feel the need to defecate coming on. 'Scuse while I go shit... MUCH BETTER NOW, THANKS I really don't have much to say tonight. My belly is full of corn and tomatoes and I feel the urge to purge coming on. By the way, how lovely is this? They aren't serving anything at our company picnic (on Wednesday) that I can eat, so I'm swinging by a Subway on the way there. "Oh, you just have to be different..." I can hear it now. Think I'll take my pictures of what happens to the cows, pigs and chickens along for lunchtime reading. Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 Okay, Bunny , I posted. So there! Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 Well, Bunny finally called me back after I left a nasty voicemail on her cellphone, telling her to get her lazy ass out of bed, it was nine in the morning, what was she thinking?? Actually, what the fuck was I thinking? I went to bed at ten (fell asleep, passed out, whatever you want to call it). Now there are two people in my den, sleeping, and I really want to watch TV. Bunny had some interesting observations about the interactions of the party-goers. The men did seem to only socialize with each other (as she put it, "like a junior high boy-girl party"). I suppose I am just used to it. I was a class act, wearing my "Hello, My Name Is High Maintenance" pajamas, no makeup and wild-ass hair. Then I go look at Vampy 's blog, and she and Liz are all sexed up, looking hot (and Liz looking fabulously drunk), and I think to myself, "Why can't I look like that drunk?" I just look like a teenager on her first binge. Oh well. Surveying the damage this morning: 3/4 of a German chocolate cake left; hardly any cheese (those bastards!) - that Havarti was amazing, thanks mom!; half of my vegetarian seven layer dip (my mom brought cocktail weinees up - "boys like to eat meat, Carol!"); the Rotel queso is almost gone; not many people touched the hummus (good, more for me!). Oh, and the vodka - yikes. We went through that entire bottle of Tito's (jug is more accurate), half the green apple Smirnoff and 1/4 of the plain jane Smirnoff. No wonder everyone is still asleep. Except for the Chicken , who is insomniatic. Thanks, "friends," for trying to wake me up from my drunken stupor. I cannot handle my liquor. And don't ask me what happened, because you know I always forget, Vicente. Speaking of Vicente , he was probably charming the pants off some poor, unsuspecting Oakland babe. I could have warned her. Damn, we didn't videotape the party. Harvey showed up with his young and beautiful wife, Jenny, who does not drink, so I'm sure a bunch of drunk idiots were lots of fun for her. We had an interesting conversation re: the rest of you bloggers out there, and all of our nicknames. People I never suspected of reading this crap I churn out do, and that really surprised me. (Yeah, Marky Mark , I am referring to YOU.) By the way, please don't refer to me as Carol. That is my middle name and I absolutely HATE it. Given that, I think I am going to change my name to my father's, which I will not reveal in here so as not to embarrass an innocent man, announcing to the world he has a potty-mouth, drunk-ass daughter who loves CHEESE . Suffice it to say, it's very unusual and would be so cool for a girl's name. Forgive me, fellow vegetarians, I love the animals but will never ever give up CHEESE . Isn't it enough of a sacrifice that I decided today to give up the fish, too? I'm not a saint, you know. (Like that was ever called into question, heh.) Today is my buddy Walt's bday. Happy happy, hope your nongirlfriend took you someplace nice last night. Hope you got some, too - everyone should get laid on their birthday. Hell, everyone should get laid every day - we wouldn't have near as much conflict. And a lot less road rage, if you ask me. My mother was so not happy with her daughter when I told her I offered my neice some hooch. It is my opinion that making drinking seem like one of the seven deadly sins serves to make it seem more attractive to a child, since my parents were teetotalers and look what happened to me. By the way, had she said yes, I wouldn't have given it to her. I'm a mean aunt, huh? I feel a cheese pizza calling my name. Must. Stay. Away. From. The. Phone. I already went back up to a size six. It couldn't possibly be that I drank three Cokes this morning and consumed all that alcohol and Coke last night. That cannot be it. I'll just blame it on PMS, like I do everything else. Even though I'm not supposed to have it until next week. Shh , don't tell Vicente. Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 Paddy Mac's bday bash was a successful event. Old friends showed up, Tito's was flowing, bagpipes were played. I danced with my neice and Bunny, Dawnie and I lusted after Scottie while watching the Thank You DVD. My mother told me this morning that she asked my neice if she had a good time. "Oh, yes, grandma. It was the best party ever! Grown-ups are so silly, and the men are the worst of all!" Learning young... Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 Hey, that got your attention... Say Hello to STAN THE MAN, who gets turned on by girls talking about shitting. We love ya, baby! PAPPABLOWS Don't ask me why I even risked it, but today now makes the THIRD time I've become ill from eating crab cakes. Perhaps it is getting to the point where I cannot stomach any flesh? No, because I had eggs for breakfast, and besides, Bunny got sick, too. She had the same exact thing I did. Fucking copycat bitch! (You know I love you, B!) WE'RE ALL WINNERS But suddenly, there's a new contender... I'M JEALOUS OF PISSER I'm jealous of Pisser's job, where she gets to stargaze; I'm jealous of Pisser's tits, which are much bigger than mine; I'm jealous of Pisser's red hair, because when I tried to go that route, I resembled Ronald McDonald (including the makeup and the big shoes). Plus she has that sexy Meerkat Love thing going on. All I have are Three Pink Monkeys . ALL MEN ARE IDIOTS AND I MARRIED THEIR KING (AND CROWN PRINCE) Eew. That just gave me the shivers. VICENTE, WORLD TRAVELER Oakland Bloggers, Attention: Watch out for a man who looks like a greyer version of Dubya, who laughs a lot and who is The Most Fun. He is invading your city this weekend for much misbehaving. His sidekick, Banky, will be with him. Banky is this sweet, adorable guy who shaved his head and looks pretty damned good bald. I'm still pissed he didn't invite me along. I'm suspicious because I think this aforementioned trip involves out-of-town 'tang. V, wear a condom if you do. Wear TWO. FINITO This is it for tonight. I have to clean (ick), watch Law &amp; Order (whee) and entertain Jason, of the The Devil Lives In Carl's Corner Jason. And I gotta go love on my tap-dancing dogs. Promise to post some drunken audioblogs tomorrow night. Much embarrassment to come (especially since we're VIDEOTAPING the entire thing!). Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 Vicente's gift - Richard CHEESE 's CD, "Lounge Against The Machine," arrived today. I can hardly wait to listen to a Lounge Music version of NIN's "Closer." I wonder how he pulls off "I want to fuck you like an animal" while sounding like Tom Jones? You gotta love a guy named Dick CHEESE , you know? TWENTY-SEVEN THINGS YOU WILL NOTICE UPON FIRST SETTING FOOT IN MY HOUSE: 1. I'm nowhere near as neat as Jaden 2. The absence of a leg on an antique table that used to hold my fish tank 3. A whole lot of Min Pin hair 4. I often use my dryer as a dresser 5. The wallpaper in my larger (if you can call it that) bathroom looks like it jumped out of a Charlotte Perkins Gilman short story and attached itself to my walls 6. I have an exercise machine-type thing that I haven't used 7. My den resembles a ski cabin 8. There are two sofas - one was used as a chew toy by the late, great Sparky; the other is a cast-off from my mom's house 9. The air freshener in my bathroom is Paddy Mac's car air freshener (scent: New Car - just what everyone wants the peepee place to smell like) 10. One of my bedroom doors is covered in stickers, photos, It's Happy Bunnies, Anne Taintor images and a naked picture of Scott Weiland playing the piano 11. CHEESE 12. A basket full of about 40 magazines, two of which I've actually sat down and read (most likely while on the toilet) 13. A lot of dust 14. Several ash trays 15. About 15 lighters 16. A not-often-used-enough "peace pipe" 17. Rob Lowe 18. Three yapping Min Pins (you actually notice them FIRST ) 19. Books and software programs just tossed about 20. Cigarette ashes, and plenty of them 21. VODKA 22. Thongs with the crotches chewed out 23. A shrine to Sparky 24. An 18-speed bike that I have yet to ride 25. 99 bottles of beer on the wall 26. 99 bottles of beer 27. The gnome that lives under my bed Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 My new bathroom floor looks pretty good. Now for the walls... BUNNY, YOU CAN COME OVER TONIGHT AND HELP ME CLEAN Or not. I still cannot believe she could hear my side of the conversation with Mary/Lisa when I put her on hold on my cell phone. That could cause problems. TIJUANA OR SAN FRANCISCO??? For vacation this year, Vicente scored some free tickets anywhere in the Continental U.S. He's thinking San Diego then driving down to Tijuana. I'm thinking San Francisco and lots of Rice-A-Roni. Chicken flavored, of course. Ooh, that reminds me: I just received my Vegetarian Starter Kit yesterday. Just out of curiosity and for vegetarian protein tips, I signed up for one from PETA. I tried to show my mother what happens to the pigs, chickens and cows but she got upset with me and walked into the other room. Ain't nobody gonna force-molt THIS Chicken! IS IT FRIDAY YET? unfortunately, that would happen to be tomorrow sigh Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 It being Dedication Wednesday and all that, above title goes out to that toboggan Scottie wore in the 10 Years Of Sex Type Thing video on STP's Thank You DVD. More nudity, Scottie. I must see your ass again. (Actually, Vicente's is much cuter, but it pisses him off when I long for Mr. Weiland, so I keep doing it.) THAT BEING SAID... Remember that poor kid who never got chosen for dodgeball? The one that, when it came down to which side would take them, both captains tossed a coin to try and NOT have to have them on their team? Welllllll, that is exactly how I feel right now. [DELETED FOR POSTERITY] THE DEVIL LIVES IN CARL'S CORNER So sayeth Jason, premier bagpipe player. DON'T HIDE YOUR LIGHT UNDER A BUSHEL What the fuck is a "bushel" anyway? HAVE ANOTHER COCKTAIL, WOMAN I do believe I will. Fuck. Tomorrow isn't Saturday yet, is it? Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 May he and his loved ones finally have some peace. Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 What is my favorite sexual position? Doggy-style White meat or dark meat? No meat. Ick. If I had only one hour left to live, what would I do? I'd spend it drinking fabulous (real) champagne and eating Mr. Jim's thin crust cheese pizza, surrounded by: Vicente, Sparky, Sadie, Buzzy and Nico, Mary/Lisa, Fab D, Paddy Mac, the rest of my family and Scott Weiland Who is my favorite comedian? Tough. Toss up between Vicente and Pisser. They both make me laugh so hard it's a wonder I haven't yet pissed my pants. If I had to use only one adjective to describe myself in a nutshell, what would it be? Psychotic. What else did you think it would be? HAPPY BDAY PADDY MAC! Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend

 I rewrote the lyrics to "Sunday, Bloody Sunday" in my head today at work. Bono would be so proud. ARE WE THERE YET? Wow, it isn't often that I skip an entire day without blogging... Why do Mondays so suck ass? Everyone I talked to today hated their entire work day. Not even one little moment of happiness was bestowed upon me between the hours of 8:15 a.m. CDT and 5:42 p.m. CDT. I felt like the girls in "Clockwatchers." SOMEDAY, EVERYTHING WILL BE BETTER FOR YOU Chut up! Time for another stupid, fucked up list. I know you have all been going through withdrawal. RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW Favorite time of day? When I am leaving work Favorite song? God, what a question. How about a Top Five list? "American Pie," "How Long?", "Still Remains," "Lithium," and "Wrong Way." Favorite animal? Vicente Goddamn, this is BORING . How about a Jeapordy questionnaire that YOU all get to fill out with the answer you think I'd be most likely to give? I will provide the answers when you are finished. What is my favorite sexual position? White meat or dark meat? If I had only one hour left to live, what would I do? Who is my favorite comedian? If I had to use only one adjective to describe myself in a nutshell, what would it be? I look forward to your guesses. Just don't bet the bank on my answers. Copyright 2004 Non-Girlfriend
