 It was announced a few weeks ago that 4 parts of the Beeb's internet arm were being closed. One of these was the Fantasy Football site which was a bit disappointing as I was looking forward to the start of a new season. It turns out that it will be closing at the end of the coming season which means we have a free, decent, online, automatically scored, urlLink Fantasy Football game at our disposal. With prizes. So should we set up a league for the New Links regulars? Leave comments below if you want in - if I get enough positive responses I'll make sure we have a league up and running for the start of the competition on August 28th.

 ..or an absolutely huge list of urlLink Torrent linkage . Of course that now means ILN will never post on here again as his bandwidth is consumed with Teletubby episodes. Or something. Not that I know what a urlLink torrent is. Parp! via the urlLink flophouse

 ..or when will that fat faced, weak chinned munter learn to stay away from his films? Here's the all new Return Of The Jedi ending for the DVD release - with urlLink Anakin inserted into the final screen to tie up the loose ends created by plot inconsistencies caused by the release of the early Star Wars episodes. I was under the impression the whole story was written before the filming of eps 4-6 were filmed - so if that's the case why weren't plot inconsistencies ironed out at that stage? Or is it just that George Lucas is an indecisve prick?

 A large collection of almost 3,000 urlLink film title screens can be found here. Well worth a browse. via urlLink Coolio's blog

 We are the urlLink Lobster Liberation Front or is it Liberation of the People's Lobsters Front? Or is it just the Front for Mad Animal Activists?

 This link is to a urlLink video of a Seaworld trainer in the pool with a killer whale . He then tries to get out after it gets a bit boisterous and the killer whale decides that's just not going to happen as he hasn't finished playing yet.

 As I'm on about Blair's nanny state I also have a problem with David Blunkett's announcement today that he's going to get tough on knife carrying. Sounds like something the government said urlLink years ago when a headmaster was stabbed and killed. Today's announcement is of course due to the schoolboy who was sentenced to life yesterday for the murder of another schoolboy. So just how is making carrying a knife illegal going to stop people stabbing other people? If you want to stab someone I don't suppose the illegal act of carrying a knife is going to put you off. It may have worked for guns but that's due to gun ownership being made illegal unless licensed. So are we going to need a licence to own knives?! Or is Mr Blunkett just repeating old promises that he has no intention of fullfilling? And will it make any difference anyway?

 I've always suspected that the government's national ID card plan was just one step closer to Blair's nanny state. Not that I'm against anything that will make it easier to track criminals but the Big Brother approach just seems like it's wide open for abuse. And now it seems that some of our MPs urlLink think the same . 'Function creep' is the term used to describe fears that, despite good intentions, the national ID card will be used to do a lot more than just track criminals.

 Manhunt is on at least two front pages today and it is urlLink guilty of murder . Apparently. As if it wasn't not bad enough that it got itself urlLink banned from New Zealand it's now gone and committed a murder in this country. Well according to the urlLink Daily Mail and urlLink Daily Mirror anyway. Yes it that's old chestnut again - video games make you kill people. Daft fsckers. Mind you its such an important issue to the Mirror that they almost made it the same size as their Fantasy Football ad. And the Daily Mail's other main story today? They have 2(!) pages dedicated to urlLink animals on the Underground . So that makes New Links like the Daily Mail but 5 months faster and without the racialism. Yay!

Abey C is a new character I've drawn for this book idea 'Learn The Alphabet.' A slightly darker look at the alphabet. I will soon be doing more of these in hope to get a line published. Abey's 123 Book, Abey's Colours, Abey's Shapes, etc. So between this urlLink one and the previous one's we've featured urlLink here , urlLink http://newlinks.blogspot.com/2004/03/movie-alphabet-game.html">here , urlLink here and urlLink here you've got no excuse not to be learning. via urlLink Hal's Stoopid Links

 The Simpsons is going to have a character come out of the closet when Springfield legalises gay marriage and Homer becomes a minister. So who is the urlLink gay Simpsons character ? "Speculation is already running rife across fan websites about who will be the mystery gay character, ranging from Mr Burns' devoted sidekick Waylon Smithers to one or both of Homer's sisters-in-law." All I can say if it's Smithers it's not much of a bloody mystery - even my 10 year old daughter knows Smithers is gay. My money's on Neddy boy but only because of his big gay moustache. But if it is going to be a mystery it's going to have to be harder than that. So I'm going to go for Mr Burns who will disappear into the sunset with Waylon.

 Of course if you are urlLink worried about getting sacked for blogging you should maybe apply for this urlLink job . via urlLink Anil Dash's Daily Links

 A nice story especially for those Newlinkers who need to fit in linkage amongst stuff they're supposed to be doing and getting paid for. Corinne Maier, a senior economist at Electricité de France, wrote a book about urlLink The Art and the Importance of Doing the Least Possible at the Workplace and now her employer is taking disciplinary action. Too bloomin' right I say. The nerve of some people. Of course NewLinkers are highly efficient work motivated multi-tasking individuals who can create linkage for our readers perusal whilst simultaneously debugging 10,000,000 lines of badly commented code. Probably.

 urlLink 11 reasons to sack Sven from the Daily Mail. Reason number one being that Sven isn't the honest, cosmopolitan man of honour and integrity that we thought we'd hired. He's just a "money-grabbing, multi-national chancer". And for once I'm not bothered by the tabloids favourite sport - England manager assassination. He may be after the money (aren't they all?) but he's still a good football coach and he's shagged Ulrika. What's the problem? Errm? We didn't win Euro 2004. Errm? What's unusual about that? We wiz robbed. Again. Sack the manager.

 Buck up boyo, you're Anne Robinson! When you're not offending the Welsh or stupid Americans on the dumbed-down transatlantic version of your hate-filled, lowest common denominator gameshow, you're being mean to people and pulling the legs off injured animals. We've seen you. Frankly, all this anger would be best directed towards evil corporations, which you did for a while at the helm of the BBC's Watchdog programme - the only show infinitely better with you on it. As it is, you've suddenly become a multi-million-dollar institution, spawning clones in hundreds of countries, presumably all winking in that terrifying "I look cuddly now, but I can hurt you. Oh yes, I can hurt you bad" way. Maybe you're ultra-famous, but you'll always be a B-list celebrity in our eyes. At least you're not writing for the Daily Mail any more.

 After the urlLink whinge this afternoon it's only fair to point out that urlLink searches are working again. Now we can talk about the redesign. Oooh it's lovely. That should cover it.

 I haven't got my copy of the Government's urlLink new guide for coping with a terrorist attack yet so I'm glad it's urlLink online . I wouldn't have known how to cope with getting infected with something deadly. Now I do. The official advice is to find Cannon and Ball with the aim of infecting them. Sterling plan. This is an excellent parody of the urlLink official site . Too excellent it seems - some governmental busybody has urlLink written to complain that it may confuse people. Pah spoilsports. But Thomas Scott says he isn't taking it down. Yay! He'd just better watch out for eager to make amends and show they're not very urlLink crap after all secret service types with brollies full of poison. Probably. via urlLink boingboing

 Nope our Dogs hasn't started a new career as a laydees underwear model though he is open to offers! The urlLink Dogone Thong is a fart deodoriser for dogs.

 urlLink GarageBand.com is a site that allows members of unsigned bands to upload demo tracks and have them voted on by you. According to the blurb 14 bands have signed major deals since the site started although I can't find any details other than the claim. There is a huge amount of material here and some of it has to be good if only by the law of averages. The music is broken up by genre so there is punk, rock, r'n'b (rhythm and bass rather than proper r'n'b but they do have a blues section), pop, dance etc etc. via urlLink linkfilter

 This is quite cool. It's like a Kevin Bacon thingummyjig but for bands rather than people. Put in the name of 2 bands (700+ in database so far) and urlLink this page will attempt to link them via band members that have appeared in other bands. So for instance did you know the Small Faces are only 19 degrees of separation away from Blink 182?

 The quiz is actually called ' urlLink Do you know Michael's Nose? ' but New Links is in favour of bogey related punnage hence the title. You get 15 pictures of noses and you have to guess whether it's Wacko's or not. I got 10 out 15.

Google is one of several search engines used by MyDoom to find valid e-mail addresses on the net. urlLink Google recovers after virus hits Look out for a flood of emails telling us we are spamming the world!

 Technorati has come out of beta and has a new look to boot. Lots of other blogs are talking about the urlLink Technorati redesign. There are a lot of sites out there taking about how nice it looks - have they actually used it or just loaded the page? It seems to be badly broken. urlLink Searches haven't worked since yesterday and the link to profiles just stopped working. I needed to go and get some new code. Not a huge problem but it would be nice if they could have let users know that the links they have back to Technorati are useless. Oh and New Links was no longer registered as belonging to anyone - I had to reclaim it. And now I can't log in at all. At least when Blogger rolled out their redeisgn it came with loads of new features and took a while to settle down. Technorati seems to have introduced no new features just a new skin so what's their excuse? Still not to worry - it looks nice.

 No b3ta newsletter this week to plunder from as they seem to think just because it's summer they are allowed time off! Pah. Lazy slackers. :) Anyhoo they've put up a couple of links in lieu of a newsletter and one of them is &quot; urlLink A Case of the Crabs &quot; which is a pointy-clicky adventure like Monkey Island. This is a black and white 'film noir' detective story and looks pretty good. It also features Dogs playing Mahjong so it has something for everyone.

 BugMeNot now urlLink requires users to register . Don't worry though as this only applies to web weasels "If you are an employee, partner, affiliate or legal representative of any site which enforces compulsory user registration then we require you to complete our registration process. It costs nothing to register and will only take a moment." The form required is pretty big (although I have seen actual registration forms even bigger than that) and the questions are fairly silly. Revenge is sweet! ;) BugMeNot are also asking non registration sites to add the following to their TOS: Any subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, or employees of any site employing compulsory user registration mechanisms are not authorized to access the content or services of this site. which would effectively make it illegal for say NY Times reporters to use the web if everybody did it. New Links may well have a one paragraph TOS in place tonight! More on BugMeNot urlLink here and urlLink here .

In addition to that with a bit of cookie magic you can see who is online if they setup the their WIP Name.

 NUFC.com asked readers to email in their views on urlLink Newcastle United signing Patrick Kluivert . The link is to the first selection they've published. For what it's worth I've wanted Kluivert to come to the toon for a few years now and it always seemed on the cards. But more recently it was Beattie who seemed to be our target and I had gradually warmed to and eventually liked that idea. I'm definitely not complaining though as Kluivert is world class - and we'll buy Beattie next summer when we are preparing for the Champion's League. ;) I know Kluivert hasn't been as good recently as he has been in the past but I'm sure him and Shearer are going to be absolute magic together. Just as well Dogs isn't around as we'd now have a urlLink slanging match . Yay!

 Newcastle has been chosen to host a World Cup qualifier between England and Azerbaijan in March 2005.This good news has been tempered by the fact that the cockney scum over at Old Trafford will get to host the other 4 games!! When exactly did Manchester become the centre of England? The reason given for the two grounds that have been chosen is the fact that they are the biggest in the country.It's all down to FA greed, the games could be shared with other cities such as Birmingham or Liverpool.The only problem is the FA will not get as much gate money.So what's a few quid compared to keeping a fresh atmosphere which you would get if the games were spread around and giving more people their last chance to see England in a quality game outside stinking London.It's only fair the games should be held outside London because when the new Wembley stadium is built the rest of England will never see another international game, but that's another argument. urlLink BBC SPORT

I suspect they appeal to anyone who would like to bring back hanging, national service, corporal punishment, ban immigration and, if Mr Humber has his way, to put women back in the kitchen. No doubt they appeal to those who are too embarrassed to vote BNP.

 It seems urlLink SBR agrees with Dogs that God and Kluivert are very similar players as he has'nt started a game with them two up front in any of our pre-season friendlies.

 Seeing as Merg has taken such an interest in (and become our resident correspondent for covering) the political issues on the other side of the atlantic, here's a couple more interesting articles that I was reading this morning... When he was governor of Texas, George W. Bush pushed for an abstinence-based sexual education curriculum. The lesson for Texas teens is that the only safe sex is no sex, and that may be a lesson that heads nationwide. Texas educators are debating what will be taught in new sexual education textbooks for its high school students. One textbook under review advises that a good way a teen-ager can prevent a sexually transmitted disease is to get plenty of rest so he or she can have a clear head about sex and choose abstinence. The 15-member Texas Board of Education is considering and will likely approve four books, all of which extol the virtues of abstinence. Three make no mention of contraceptives at all while one makes passing reference to condoms. urlLink Texas Sex-Ed Textbooks Face Contraceptives Battle Also this week, good ol'e George has also declared that his administration will "never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people." urlLink New 'Bushism' Born at Bill Signing Bunger's Quote of the Day&reg;: I can't remember who said it, but it runs like this : " making war to create peace is like fucking to preserve your virginity..." via Yahoo!

 Loads of urlLink quotes from Terry Pratchett lifted from alt.fan.pratchett and very amusing they are too. I know for a fact Merg will like the first one as he hates this particular management phrase: I'll be more enthusiastic about encouraging thinking outside the box when there's evidence of any thinking going on inside it. via urlLink mijnkopthee and despite the urlLink last post on NL it looks like I'm going to have to learn Dutch as I'm plundering loads of linkage from Dutch sites which I find via urlLink bloglog.nl - where the urlLink WIP shizzle is from.

 Apparently English is fast becoming the lingua franca of of the EU which means we will no longer have to shout at waiters abroad. Yay! And who is responsible for this urlLink rise to prominence for our language in Europe ? That'll be the Eastern Europeans who the urlLink Daily Mail wanted to keep out as they would be damaging UK culture or something. And scrounging benefits. And eating babies. Instead they are making it easier for us to go on holiday. Their second language, if they have one, is nearly always English as they don't like Russian having spent years under Russian rule, don't like German (something to do with Hitler) and they don't like French (something to do with France). With the arrival of all these English speakers French and German are being marginalised. The only thing to find out now is whether I can sue the school system for making me sit through all those shite French lessons - for nowt!

 Firefox is riding high in the linkback stakes according to a post at blakeross.com Not even at 1.0 yet, Firefox already enjoys inbound links to its product page from a staggering 74,000 websites. This is 20,000 more than link to Opera, 5,000 more than link to Netscape, 15,000 more than link to Microsoft's IE page and 12,000 more than link to Apple. This is phenomenal! All these figures are easily verifiable by clicking on the links in the urlLink article . The article goes on to explain that a urlLink database of posts about Firefox has been created which is how I found out about it as we've had a few referrals from an urlLink entry of ours . They are trying to get 2000 contactable sites by August 10th. As the sites are indexed people are asked to put on the contact details for the site. I've just put ours in which takes them to urlLink 353 at the time of writing. This database is going to be used to contact people to get them to put the get Firefox button on their site. Well I think it's that button anyway as I couldn't find a link to buttons in the article. Well there's ours in this post. I'll stick it in the sidebar at the weekend. urlLink

 erm... " width="64" height="64" />It seems the urlLink Women of WalMart didn't just get their tats out for any old reason - it seems they may have had to rely on food stamps to supplement a low income. I'm sure the money from Playboy came in handy. California urlLink paid out $86m in assistance to WalMart employees in 2001 because their wages were so low and needed assistance in the form of food stamps and health related expenses. The study was based on data from that year but as WalMart wage increases haven't matched inflation levels the report reckons it will be even worse now. So the next time you slap your arse in Asda's with a self satisfied grin spare a thought for their employees - they might be talking to Razzle right now.

 In the tradition of certain other dubious bloggy/news-type sites, people and readers ask their readership stupid questions. Great filler for those Slow-News-Days, too. In order to perpetuate this pointless exercise, I've decided to inflict it upon our visitors too. So, here's the very first "Aks Newlinks" -- in honour of a nameless aquaintance of ILN. Since most (all?) of us are using Firebird, which Firebird extensions do you use? (And if you're feeling loquacious, why?) I use: Adblock -- zap any ad. A must. Web Developer -- Some nice context-menu extras for web page work. Tabbrowser Extensions -- Save and load tab sessions, undo close, general managment. Nifty. Image Zoom -- For those times you just want to "make it bigger". The picture, the picture! IE View -- For the broken sites. EditCSS -- Edit CSS on the fly. Bug Me Not -- For those with You-Must-Register site blues. I was also running FlashBlock on older versions, but last I heard it didn't work on the latest Firefox. But right now, for me, nor does flash. I must get around to fixing that...

 I'm going to update the linkage in the sidebar soon to put some of the linkdump sites in that hve been referring to us. Some of them are pretty good. Anyhoo - if anyone wants owt sticking in the sidebar shout out. Preferably a good source of linkage trawling but if it's a good blog or whatever they can go in too.
