 First of all, official greetings from unofficial mod. Welcome to the Blog Rachel, you need a title scheme. All mine are quotes from web comics and other blogs, Erins are quotes from books and movies, Nathan has something musical, I dont remember what, Michael's are quotes from the west wing, thomas is welcome to fred, Sophia has band name ideas, and I can't figure out Jonahs. You need one that isn't any of those. Other rules: Nothing can be deleted, but you can add edits in bold to other posts. You can change the template(little quote thing on the bottom) only after the one currently in use has been there for a week, unless its a special occasion. there are probably some minor rules I'm forgetting, but.... oh well. I could have sworn I edited in that we were going saturday after thomas posted we were going friday... ( I edited in Sunday because all the marching stuff is on Saturday and I can't go, so I was encouraging everyone to come Sunday --Thomas) Im stuck between Palpatine and the skeleton. They should fight in Mortal Kombat. literaly. That is, play against eachother in the video game. Why shake hands when we can touch...other things? Like Lips...

 Yay for Rachel who nailed her post on the first time! Okay, I thought I would be offended when I read about the CoS Primary (even though the current president is an incumbent with an intention to run for re-election, so unless a challenger arises, there is no official "Republican Primary") but I really wasn't. My opinions (and handy odds!) are thus: George W. Bush : Please, Lord, not again. The man led us through September 11th. He did good. He led us into a war in Afghanistan, which didn't lead to serious problems. THE MAN NEEDS A FOUR-YEAR VACATION! After two wars (one that's a losing battle at this point ) he really needs to Get Out. Now. But I like his cabinet. Condolezza Rice kicks ass! Seriously, a viable female candidate if she desires to run. Might give Hillary a run for her money. Odds 5:1 Bill Gates : Seriously? Can you imagine Bill Gates saying to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, "Commence bombing on select military sites." That's just all kinds of wrong. The man can't design a good operating system, why would he be good as president? Odds 50:1 Senator Palpatine : He's the model of a modern Republican. I regret to have said that as now Jonah will begin singing Pirates of Penzance now. But seriously, he is. He's got the geek vote And geeks a group that was essential in Bush's first election bid. Look for him to win a few primaries but peter out around Super Tuesday. Odds 3:1 The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra : Perfect. Loud, Sarcastic, A little bit bitchy and concise. He's the ideal Republican candidate. Odds 2:1 By the way, if a box of hair ran against John Kerry in the next primary, it would probably be more in tune with issues, speak more eloquently, and govern the country in a way that's fair to all, even more so than Kerry. But seriously, if you think America needs a president who can snowboard? Then vote for Kerry. What else was I going to say? I don't know, that's your problem, I sleep now. Why shake hands when we can touch...other things? Like Lips...

 Hola Hola Coca Cola! Okay, so I've finally got this thing figured out, and I will be posting on here anytime something stupid comes to mind. Actually, that's a bad idea because then I would be posting about 50 times a day...Anyway! For my very first entry (woo hoo!) I'll just talk about my other day at practice. Okay, here's what happened...My team and I were running laps and we happened to come upon some ducks. My friend Megan decided that she wanted to catch a duck, so she ran to go get one. Well obviously the ducks flew away! Which got me to thinking...why don't ducks live in trees? I mean, they can fly so it's apparent that they can live in a tree or at least stand on a tree limb if they wanted to, but I've never ever seen a duck in a tree! And now I want to! My goal in life is to see a duck in a tree! Why shake hands when we can touch...other things? Like Lips......that's a good question! I think it would be a great idea to walk up to some random person, introduce myself, and touch their lips. That way I can give and take germs and become sick and die faster than normal! That's the best idea I've ever heard!...Or perhaps it's the dumbest thing I've ever heard...

 I realized something to day. I can no longer remember which of my friends went to Fall Creek with me and which ones I met in High School. The fact that I remember middle school so vaguely is worrying to me. I think I may be going senile early. I've decided that I need a feature, like fanfic recommendations or match-ups. So to celebrate election year, I'm having our vary own Compendium of Stupidity election simulator. Since we have so few people, I'm letting everyone vote in both primaries. First the Republican primary. The candidates are: George W. Bush Bill Gates Senator Palpatine The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra! Cast your votes in your next post. Why shake hands when we can touch...other things? Like Lips...

 Fine, we'll go Sunday. There's not a chance in hell I'm playing musical chairs though. Thomas must see The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra before it leaves Castleton Arts since he so totally wrote it. Also is it wrong that I find the fact that Marten got stood up by the Comstocks and I absolutely hilarious. By the way, Nathan made two mysterious bathroom trips. I have SpongeBob Uno! Yay! Why shake hands when we can shake...other things? Like Lips.

 Marten, I have yet to receive the hat of triumph, so I am ineligible for the hat of shame, that means that you get it if anyone does. I went to the IYC thing, and it was wonderful! The only low point was this guy who came on and claimed who was going to do "We Got Trouble Right Here in River City" style song and then spouted mindless dribble for around 15 minutes. No singing involved. Anywho Nathan and Alice and all the others were really good. Everyone go to Pajama Game Sunday [I think we're going Sunday-Marten] [No, we're going Saturday.--Michael] No Michael, I am going Sunday then because I am busy Saturday, so Marten should come then. On Saturday, come to the World's Biggest Game of Musical Chairs, which requires 8,500 people, on Saturday and the Lawrence Park football field place. To get in free, bring your own chairs! Michael come to the musical chairs Saturday -Why shake hands when we can shake...other things?

 I havn't posted in a while, but Thomas hasn't posted in even longer, so the hat of shame lies with him. I went to a baptist church last night! It was interesting. The man yelled. A lot. And he didn't use his voice properly so he sounded like a louder whinier michael. However, he had some interesting things to say, and to be fair, it was all true, but its point of view, you know? the way they interpret things, its different. more on that on the lobby. The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra has to be the best movie. Ever. But don't see it alone, cuz it sucks when you watch it without anyone to make fun of it with. A horrible experience I had to go through because Michael neglected to tell me of a time change. But all is well, because Jonah paid for my ticket the second time, and I got to punch Michael in the stomach. Why shake hands when we can touch other things?

 Jonah-- Yeah, that is an old one. And all these years I was just waiting for such an occasion as this to use it properly. I do remember Levi's hardwood floors website. That was hysterical. Nathan-- Congratulations on the braces! :) Yesterday was one of the coolest days ever. Mrs. Horrigan has this friend who has done plays on Broadway and everything, and he came to talk to us in SRT. His name's Ben Davis, and he went to LN. He's been in Les Mis on Broadway and a touring production of Les Mis, La Boheme on Broadway and in LA, and Thoroughly Modern Millie on Broadway. He's worked with Baz Luhrman and he's met Nicole Kidman and Leonardo DiCaprio and Hugh Jackman and James Gandolfini and James Lipton and all kinds of people. He got a Tony for La Boheme and he brought it and we all got to hold it. I got to hold an actual Tony Award! And then he sang for us. Twice. He has an amazingly beautiful voice. Plus he was really really nice. How cool is that? Ok, I lied about having the fanfic rec up yesterday. I didn't feel like it yesterday. So it will be on Saturdays. This is all part of my grand scheme to confuse the new bloggers as much as possible when they get here. "You might not care, but I do." For this week's rec, I decided to buck tradition and go with something non-Star Wars. And I've been talking about Discworld a lot lately, so it's not that either. Instead, it is a Chicago one-shot called "Somebody Got Murdered." It's on good old ff.net. It talks about the various violent crimes committed by the six merry murderesses and the sweetest little jazz killer. It's actually very good as far as characterization and mood, even though it's a songfic, which I usually hate. It's time to bring this ship into the shore, and throw away the oar forever.

 My braces are gone! No more braces for Nathan! And I can eat anything I want! In other news, the Cabaret and the Easter Egg hunt were both huge successes. At any rate, we didn't crash and burn at the Cabaret, which is more than I can say for Josh. The Easter egg hunt had way more people than anyone expected. We didn't hide enough eggs for everyone, but it turned out ok. It's time to bring this ship into the shore, and throw away the oar forever.

 Erin - Wow, that takes me back. That injoke probably predates my relationships with Marten, Thomas, and Michael (I don't actually remember when I met Sophia). Do you remember Levi's hardwood floors website? Anyway, I found out via Michael that there is a Moulin Rouge soundtrack II which has all the good stuff missing off the first one. If anyone is ever looking for something to buy me that might be worth bearing in mind. I never gave you the update on the watermelon vs a slightly larger watermelon in a pole-vulting competition. Well, neither watermelon has arms, so the real question is, will the extra size increase the thrust of the watermelon or just add dead weight. Of course, the larger watermelon can hold a bigger pole, which would get it higher. So the verdict is the slightly larger watermelon. I'll conclude with a shameless advertising plug of : The Pajama Game! Your school doesn't have a musical, so come to ours. SEE: A knife throwing exhibition by the amazing Vernon Hines! THe best Tropical Spanish nightclub in Cedar Rapids, Iowa! Everybody dressed for the fifties! People losing their pants to humorous effect! HEAR: A man singing a duet with a tape recorder! A random middle of the show number that rivals Cabin Fever! "I love you"... in morse code! WITNESS: The titanic struggle for Pajama Survival! You won't want to miss... THE PAJAMA GAME Coming soon to a Lawrence North near you! April 17 @ 7:30 and April 18 @ 2:00 It's time to bring this ship into the shore, and throw away the oar forever.

 Okay, that's outside my title scheme, but I had to break it just this once in celebration of the fact that our kitchen now has hardwood floors! This is very exciting for me. Moving on, I have a new Discworld theory. I developed it while I was bored in Precal. I don't really want to disclose too much, because I think I'm going to write a story about it and I want some of y'all to be surprised. But I'm going to have to buy Night Watch. And for some reason I can't even begin to rationalize I've started to try to figure out the Discworld timeline again. Or, as I like to call it, The Glass Clock of DOOM. Especially considering that Theif of Time was mainly Pterry's big excuse for his crappy chronology and just made it worse. Irrelevant spoiler of the Day: That's right, I know it's heartbreaking, but you remember Darth Vader? You know, the tall guy with the menacing breathing? He's Anakin. Ani falls to the dark side. Feel free to weep. Next time: Where have all the Jedi gone? The Original Trilogy comes out on DVD in September, and the Episode III premiere is May 19, '05! Woo! Let's see... what else did I have to say... Oh, yeah! I'm bringing back the fanfiction recommendation of the week! And it will be every week! And it will be starting on Friday! ("You might not care, but I do.") Sigh... sometimes I wish I had a life. And then I think... no, nevermind. It's time to bring this ship into the shore, and throw away the oar forever.

 For those of you who haven't heard, Rachel Bossi and Paul Simmons are new members of the blog. Or will be as soon as Rachel decides to sign up and Jonah sends the invitation to Paul. I'm blogging from school, because I'm grounded (for two days) because I didn't wash my dishes. Feh. I'm sitting next to a girl who comes into the library everyday and sends e-mails to her uh..."significant other" consisting of nothing other then "HEY BABY! I MISS YOU! I LOVE YOU." She seriously creeps me the hell out. It's time to bring this ship into the shore, and throw away the oar.

 I'm back too! I finished my paper, although it sucks. I don't particularly care, though, because it's only 60% of the 6 weeks grade. There's still 40% of other crap. So there. Anyway, my cruise was AMAZING and I actually got something similar to a tan (it's still reddish). I burn SO easily...ick. Anyways, I'm sad I missed JournalCon and "bitchpants". Sounds like a super-great time, though. I answered all those questions! Yay! And congrats, Erin, on the new fan fiction! It's fun stuff, and your title sounds like coolness. Ha, I'm still in editing mode, I just changed the last sentence because the phrase "sounds coolness" wouldn't have worked. Crazy stuff. Anyway, bye bye! It's time to bring this ship into the shore, and throw away the oar forever.

 Yay! Comstocks have returned! Indianapolis just hasn't been the same. Journalcon was fun. Erin, if you read this in time, please bring the tapes to youth group so they can listen to a bit of the madness. The new template fits my current mood perfectly. This research paper is driving me mad! I'm about half-way done with it, but I have a real headache, and have taken two naps because of it. It's like pulling teeth out of my ears. I am generally Goshenellumpth. Oh well. Back to work. It's time to bring this ship into the shore, and throw away the oar forever.

 This title implies my final change to the title scheme, at least for now. Songs. All Songs, but mostly still musicals with some classic rock and folk music thrown in. By the way, I officially love so called "classic rock", especially Styx, Journey, and REO Speedwagon. More on that if I feel like it. I'm gonna be posting more now. Things have calmed down a lot. I have my Saturdays back for a while. Life is ok. It's not good. My grade took a serious dive last six weeks and it's looking very likely I'll take home my first D on a report card ever. I may be able to raise it before it gets on my transcript, but not before the six weeks. And more than likely Mom and Dad will make me quit New Dimension next year if that happens. One more thing: Orson Scott Card remains the best author ever. I highly recommend "Maps in a Mirror". It's time to bring this ship into the shore, and throw away the oar forever.

 That quote is from Jersey Girl, which I just saw. I love Liv Tyler, but it's funny because Ben Affleck tries to act. Like, with human emotions. Jonah-- Yeah, Nathan can definitely read Monstrous Regiment. It is good, isn't it? :) I think the only reason I bought the Corndog thing was because I was in a heightened emotional state, due to my recent publication. And the Moulin Rouge soundtrack does have some of the good songs on it. Like the Elephant Love Medley. I love the Elephant Love Medley. I love it whenever Ewan McGregor belts out pretty words. Plus, if you guys who were gone haven't heard about JournalCon 1.5 yet, all I can say is that it involved the word "bitchpants." Quite a lot. And how often do you get to say that? I'll go do the Friday Five now. It came with a matching tie, using a liberal definition of the term "matching" They're both made of fabric? Pretty much.

 I'm back!!! So the trip to Florida was full of Comstock-like hilarity, some of which will soon surface on Tales from the Other Side of the Corndog. When we actually got to Florida, there were many Comstocks and therefore much more hilarity, including: -My cousin David who brought his girlfriend to meet the Comstocks after only nine months of dating. -My cousin Paula's husband, Georgio, whose English is very good, but is still week enough to lead to several amusing translation stories. -The quote "I feel like a lizard!" actually making sense. -The mysterious "mini golfing" trips. I also went shopping, and my aunt paid as her b-day present to me. I got: Newsies on DVD, Silly Songs with Larry on CD, and the Moulin Rouge soundtrack (which sucks, because they axed good songs that were in the movie in favor of "Moulin Rouge inspired" crap by "popular" artists). I'm happy to report that my cousin Paula in Italy is going start reading TftosotC and, possibly, by extension, CoS. That is, when she gets a computer in her new house, which is the next priority after running water and a bed. So that means international readership for Jonah! By the way, thank you very much Michael for ruining my joke, which Erin actually seemed to be buying. And speaking of Erin, as soon as I finish posting I will go over to Fanfiction.net and start reading! BTW, I loved Monstrous Regiment. Can Nathan read it before I return it? It came with a matching tie, using a liberal definition of the term "matching" They're both made of fabric? Pretty much.

 I think everyone on this blog is quite aware of my hair situations. It came with a matching tie, using a liberal definition of the term "matching" They're both made of fabric? Pretty much.

 It's Friday Five Time. (NATHAN AND SOPHIA, PLEASE DO LAST WEEK'S FIRST!) 1. Is your hair naturally curly, wavy, or straight? Long or short? Michael: Short and Straight. Jonah: Straight, short, and generally psycho Erin: wavy, and sort of a middle-length Nathan: My hair flips... right. both sides do. I hate it. It's fairly long for a guy. Thomas: My hair sort of fluctuates. I think it is mostly medium lenth and straight. Sophia: My hair is flip-y. It flips out at the ends...and, medium length? 2. How has your hair changed over your lifetime? Michael: It was longer and then it was shorter and now it's kind of in the middle again. Jonah: It fell out when I was two, but since its grown back it's been more or less the same, save the rat tail fiasco, which is best forgotten. Erin: It was curly, then it was straight, then it was wavy and frizzy... I don't want to talk about the bangs. They were bad. Nathan: More than I can say. Thomas: First it was normal parted, then it was bowl cut, then buzz cut, and now back to sort of normal part. Sophia: Long, short, long, short, orange. 3. How do your normally wear your hair? Michael: However the hell it looks when I get out of bed. Seriously. Jonah: Diddo, except on Sundays when I put a bunch of gel on it. Erin: down Nathan: With pride. Thomas: Great answer Nathan. I wear my hear however it wants to be worn. It talks to me every morning after I wake up with its requests. Sophia: out of my face. 4. If you could change your hair this minute, what would it look like? Michael: It would be blue. No it wouldn't. I don't know! I like my hair the way it is! Jonah: It would be cooperative. Erin: It would no longer be frizzy, but would make up it's mind as to whether it wants to be curly or straight. Nathan: Flourescent blue. And not just highlights, either. Thomas: I would have longer sideburns, dyed hot pink. Sophia: MINE WOULD BE HOT PINK, TOO!!! 5. Ever had a hair disaster? What happened? Michael: My hair got overchlorinated and nasty when I was in Kindergarten. That's actually the only thing. Jonah: It's consistently bad, but not disastrous. Erin: Not to my recollection. There have been many days of Magrat hair, but I've learned to love them. Nathan: On the bus home from Branson it did some pretty weird stuff, but I thought it actually looked pretty cool. Thomas: My hair has generally been pretty calm, and it knows that I do not tolerate disasters. Sophia: Oh, in 3rd grade I got it cut awfully and looked dreadful. But that's about it. It came with a matching tie, using a liberal definition of the term "matching" They're both made of fabric? Pretty much.

 IT'S UP! IT'S UP IT'S UP IT'S UP! Everybody please please go to fanfiction.net and click on movies and click on Star Wars, and there is Dex's Diner by ME! Celebrate! It came with a matching tie, using a liberal definition of the term "matching" They're both made of fabric? Pretty much.

 I JUST POSTED A STORY ON FANFICTION.NET! Yeah, I know it's April Fool's Day, but I'm serious! I did! It's Dex's Diner! So everybody look for it there within the next few days, because I POSTED IT! AHHH! It came with a matching tie, using a liberal definition of the term "matching" They're both made of fabric? Pretty much.

 Summer School starts Friday. That is the stupidest thing I have ever heard. That is all. I want to STUFF the MONKEY!

 Ok, so that made absolutely no sense, but y'know what? I don't care. Welcome back Marten, you crazy drama king. Very sorry about Merryl, can't wait to see the chess set. Anyway, it's now been summer for 2 1/2 days and It's not been as relaxing as I hoped. Commencement, open houses, relatives - I just want to relax. Plus, I missed my first Corndog update since I went once a week. That kinda sucks. At least I had a good time at Erin's open house. It was too bad Marten and Thomas couldn't make it. OH wel, we'll all meet up at Youth Group at least. I want to STUFF the MONKEY! ^Can anyone explain this!?!

 Marten's back! Wow! I had four days! I win the bet! Okay, now for my first JournalCon-less post in a while. I hate the Cicadas. My mom hates them too and has been freaking out since March when she found out that they were coming. On the other hand Dad has been sympathetic to the cicadas, thinking that we were all big wusses and that as long as the didn’t bother him, he would remain blasé about them. That’s until one of them got in his car. Yeah. So now dad is firmly in the anti-cicada camp. He’s been rambling about cicadas for the last twelve hours, and when we went to the video store in Marsh, he told the clerk that he had cicadas in his car, and then he bought a bottle of Raid Flying Insect Killer, but I wisely checked the side to see what it killed, and it was more Fruitfly than Cicada. So we got the one that kills crickets. Personally, I don’t think anything short of Sarin will work, but it’s his money. I saw Miracle last night, and in between realizing that Kurt Russell as Herb Bloom is Jonah’s urlLink fashon guru *, I realized that it was possible for America to dream again, especially after four years with the most ineffectual president ever. (Jimmy Carter is a good man. Good President? Not so much…) Actually I realized that a movie that could have been pure undriven treacle was actually pretty damn good, because of a few different factors. 1.) Patricia Clarkson 2.) The Hockey players were very good, and managed to act pretty well considering that the were actual hockey players and not actors. 3.) Patricia Clarkson 4.) The last scene is still suspenseful even though you know how it’s going to end 5.) Patricia Clarkson 6.) It’s remarkably done, and better than it should have been, because of… 7.) Patricia Clarkson I’m staying home today instead of going to a race party at some friends of my parents house. I have to do laundry, but it’s still worth it. Okay, I’m pretty much done here. This is Michael Christie, signing off. *I couldn't find a good picture of his pants, but the man had a serious plaid fetish. I want to STUFF the MONKEY!

 Hello all. I'm back from Vincennes! It was a lot of fun! I got this crazy old chess set! The pieces are hand carved and you can't tell what they are, but it's really Cor! I also met this girl named Merryl, and she's really cool. Unfortunately, she lives in a trailer with no computer and no telephone, and I lost her address, so I can't send her letters. Anyway, After sleeping on it for a couple of days, I decided that my departure from Compendium was a little rash and I'm back. But we seriously need to do more blogging and less party planning. Ok? And Rachel and Sophia - post more! I want to STUFF the MONKEY!

 and that is precisely why it's important to keep on living, to not give up hope." I needed the entire quote there. It's just a great quote. Okay, Marten's left the blog. Where do we go from here? Since one of the reasons that Marten left was because Compendium "had become a message board for planning parties", I have to ask, Do you want fewer JournalCons? No JournalCons? I had just planned out the summer because it would be hard for me to make rounds and plan them the way I usually did because we're not in school. So if I seemed anal and controlling, that's the only reason why. On a different note, I met two of the Sushi People! Ashley (who is awesome) and...and...I think there was another one, but I for some reason don't remember her. Which is sad. But Ashley was cool. And so was "The Day After Tomorrow". It was a great summer movie, I loved it, I loved the trailers before it, only problem was the lame-ass wolf subplot. Very uncool. Everything else rocked. I want to STUFF the MONKEY!

 Marten just quit. And not in the way I did, with the eventual return, I mean he deleted his membership here. His statement should be here soon, but I think he's actually serious. In which case we're Post-Sorkin West Wing. Oy! I want to STUFF the MONKEY!

 Blow this for a lark, I'm out. I want to STUFF the MONKEY!

 I'm posting a little soon after my last post, but I wanted to mention that I did great on my Algebra final, managed to nullify the D- I got in Speech by not doing anything, and I'm done with my finals (I have Art 1st block and Japanese (which I'm skipping) the second. I'm reading recaps, baby!(Apologies to Thomas, who has Algebra II and AP World History finals tomorrow. That sucks, dude.) Erin: Write Your Full Disclosure! I want to STUFF the MONKEY!

 Today we had our first chamber choir meeting for next year. I'd like to think I made a urlLink good first impression . More likely they thought I was pretty weird. There is, of course a urlLink logical explanation for everything, but they didn't know that. Oh well, at least nothing else can surprise them too much. Also, I love having both a digital camera and a geocities page. It makes blogging even more fun! I want to STUFF the MONKEY!

 I'm rejiggering JournalCons again! We're going to continue with WestWingCon (Season One) on June 4th, because Erin doesn't care if she's there or not. I tried to do Top ten of the season, but there are too many damn subplots so we're going with fifteen. Here's the final list: RERUN: Sports Night "Quo Vadimus" 1. Pilot 2. Post Hoc, Ergo Propter Hoc 3. A Proportional Response 4. Five Votes Down 5. The Crackpots and These Women 6. Mr. Willis of Ohio 7. The Short List 8. In Excelsis Deo 9. He Shall, From Time to Time 10. Celestial Navigation 11. Six Meetings Before Lunch 12. Let Bartlet Be Bartlet 13. Mandatory Minimums 14. Lies, Damn Lies and Statistics 15. What Kind of Day Has It Been August 27th will hopefully be a CutCon, anything we don't get to at the MovieCons will go there I want to STUFF the MONKEY!

 SO much to say... and yet absolutely nothing. I'm Bass section leader next year. Technically I'll be in charge of ten other people. They won't listen, but that's a problem for next year. It still makes me happy. What does not make me happy is that the "recommended" summer dance classes are now mandatory... for me. And only me. But oh well. I need it. The new SRT system sucks! Is it happening at LC too? I need to know so I can figure out how to structure my rant. Also it is way too hard to get a drivers license in this city. Bureaucracy sucks. Besides those unrelated pseudorants, I have very little to say, so I'll leave you with a really bad poem. Trees aren't blue Neither are you You know what to do So give me my shoe This isn't funny It's really just random Keep doing stuff like this And you won't develop a fandom That last line sucked and so does this poem so I'm gonna stop now. I hope you enjoyed that, but somehow I doubt it. I'll post again when I make sense. I want to STUFF the MONKEY!

 Maybe that's more of a CD title. ANYWAY! I haven't been to church in a month and I don't plan on going back EVER! SO THERE! ha. Just kidding, sorry, I don't know where that came from. Now I'm really sad that I didn't go to MOM!!! Wait, was Kelly in it? Cuz if she was...I swear to Buddha...she's dead!!! That evil little girl hasn't talked to me in so long! COMSTOCK! Tell Kelly to talk to me. Got it? I don't even particularly care which one of you does it...I know that both of you know her. But not everyone does, so, back to my point. What was my point? Oh yeah. I haven't been here in forever! And, as retarded as I am, I so can NOT find this calendar thing. I know that you explained everything earlier, Michael, and I thank you for that, but I'm much too lazy to go back and look, and, besides, I'm only writing this to procrastinate more on writing my Drama critique. You know what? I just won't do it! I was just doing it for extra credit anyway. Well, poo on that! If I may say so myself! HMMPH! Anyway. Again. Bye! I want to STUFF the MONKEY!

 Hi, guys. I'm glad to hear that MoM went so well; I would've loved to have gone. And I want to thank you guys for saying I didn't have to-- that means you are first-class, stand-up guys. Oh, dear. Okay. This is all I have to say about the youth group situation, and then I hope it's all done. The idea that religion isn't important to us, or whatever, probably came from my post, although that's not what I meant to imply at all. It's just that I went to Sunday School for eight years. I've been confirmed. And I've been in groups where you just learn the seven sacraments over and over, but then I've also been in groups where everybody knows the sacraments and we get to talk about more personal aspects of faith. So Marten, Thomas, and Michael convinced me to come to youth group and I thought, okay, these are people I would be happy to do that with. I feel really bad for contributing to the breakdown of the larger group. I felt horrible when Patty pointed it out, I felt horrible when Jonah pointed it out. And I do appreciate that you guys have to keep going there and have to find some way to make it work. The point of my earlier post was more to make a suggestion than to complain, but if it rubbed people the wrong way, I'm sorry. Really. I know you're all wonderful people, and I'm sure Patty and the rest of the people in the group are as well. I'm done talking now. On a lighter note, Lookit! I learned how to change the thingy! I want to STUFF the MONKEY!

 Hey guys! I'm sorry it's been so incredibly long since I've last updated...I've been pretty busy as you can tell. Anyway, I'm assuming that the Comstocks made Jekyll and Hyde...? I know The Pirate King did. Good Job! Mr. Stafford said that I was one of the people on the list of names of those they wanted, but when it came down to it, I just had too many conflicts. Poo. I really wanted to be in it! But it makes me feel better to know that I didn't make it because of my soccer schedule and not because I have no talent. Recently I went back to Fall Creek Valley with Central Sound. It brought back a lot of memories. I saw Mr. Rawlinson...he didn't remember me, but that's okay! "Faster Pace, Higher Level, Pay Attention to Detail!" ha! Mrs. Springer was running around the school...she remembered me, so that made me happy! She still has the Anne Frank quote on the giant pencil above her door, and the students just recently did the poems...I remember Jonah's rendition of "The Raven." That was some great stuff! I heard that Mrs. Williams has cancer or something, so she's gone now...sad. Sixth grade English and Literature would never have been the same without her! Oh, and tell me why when I got home that night I started downloading some School House Rock songs? Yay Mr. Harvey! That's all for now kids! I've gotta get some last minute memorizing in for my drama final! The ultimate starship is Alfre Woodard's forehead.

 BTW, that's not a cop-out. I'm seriously considering it for my autobiography title. Anyway, I apologize for some of what I said. I was a little upset about the King's Island thing, how it seems like you guys are intentionally setting up for a confrontation. I think you guys care about the group more than I thought - you just want to make some changes, and that's fair. So, let's just try to do it in a peaceful way. Also, thank you all so much for coming to PseudoMOM. If you enjoyed watching it half as much as we enjoyed putting it on, than we enjoyed it twice as much as you. In conclusion, I love you all. (But in a totally nonsexual way) (Except for Sophia) (No, just kidding) (Mostly) The ultimate starship is Alfre Woodard's forehead.

 I added the template, and it's random and funny and part of Jacob's Wrinkle in Time recap. Go read it. Okay, Jonah, I think you're taking a tad too much credit for the bringing of people into the Youth Group. I recommended it to Erin, so that was pretty much me, although it is indirectly related to you. And also the part about us not liking the religion part is such complete and utter bullshit it's not even funny. I never said I had a problem with the religious part or the worship. That's fine, I knew that would be a part of a church sponsored Youth Group. But to play the same games every week will just end in madness! And also if Kraig is the person I'm thinking of, he specifically said that he was going to be busy for a while and wouldn't be coming! And, yeah. I joined the group so we could hang out together. That's pretty much the only reason I'm there. I'm sorry if the desire to see Jonah and Nathan more than once every two months is such a bad thing, if it is, than believe me, I won't be coming back in two weeks. By the way, AnimationCon is dead, So the new schedule looks something like this: June 1 - WestWingCon (Season 1) - 3:00 June 11 - MovieCon! - 3:00 June 18 - WestWingCon (Season 2) - 3:00 July 17 - MusicalCon! With Special Guest "Camp" - 4:00 Note the changes. Okay, I went to meeting of the minds, and if I had wanted to shove sharp metal objects in Jonah's eye earlier, the desire is all but gone now. LN Lyceum rocks. The funniest moment of the night? I'm not going to play favorites with the sketches, but when Mrs. Means got up and started talking about how great the class was and how her car broke and how she didn't bring snacks, the entire class was standing up there like when Michael Moore (ASS!) brought all of the Documentary nominees on stage and started yelling at Bush and then the people behind him were wondering "What am I doing here?" and rolling their eyes and looking like Deer in headlights. Seriously, y'all rock. Props to you. The ultimate starship is Alfre Woodard's forehead.

 Jonah, if you're pinning crap on me, then you are in for such a flogging. I'm not in full agreement with Michael's post, but I'm not happy with the way Patty overreacts to things. I apologize for sunday, it was largely my fault we weren't involved, but I'm bringing board games to the next meeting, because hide and seek is just really boring when it's not a lock-in. Especially when your locked out of the hiding place the first game and yelled at for not playing the second. Still, I'm all for a more unified youth group, where we can actually plan things, but just by our nature we're going to be atleast slightly disorganized, and Patty needs to realize this and work with us instead of helping to create an atmosphere in which we're working against her. Perhaps Erin is right, and she isn't the person to be working with older kids. I'm hoping you(jonah) can take a little more control, I feel like under your leadership that we can be, for the most part, self directed and Patty can worry about the younger kids. Who added this template? It's stupid. It's not funny, just stupid. The ultimate starship is Alfre Woodard's forehead.

 I agree with Jonah -The ultimate starship is Alfre Woodard's forehead.

 I'm tired of this. I have to spend two more years with Patty, and with you guys (exceptin' Erin). This uneasy peace, with you guys talking about her behind her back, is not gonna last. And it puts me in a difficult and unfair position. After all, intentionally or not, I brought you guys to the group more or less. So any conflict that arises is gonna be my fault. I like you guys and Journalcons, but I also owe the group my support, if not for Patty herself than for the church. And you all don't seem to have noticed that as our little clique grows, we're losing people. Has anybody seen Kraig lately? Does anyone know where he is? As Erin said, you joined the group so we could hang out together. I think that's the wrong reason. If you don't like Patty and you don't want to do Youth Group things (which, amazingly enough, involve religion) than consider whether you should be coming. Because to join the Youth Group, scare away other people, and then bitch about Patty and how things are run seems stupid and counterproductive. So that's my stance. (BTW, It's worth noting that most of that stuff doesn't really apply to Thomas or Nathan.) The ultimate starship is Alfre Woodard's forehead.

 Nathan and Thomas, There's no "c" in Jekyll. Just for the record. Props to Jonah and Marten for spelling it right. Hat of shame is to be equally split among the two of you. Since Erin is leaving the 27th of August (something she didn't POST ON THE CALENDAR!), I call for a boycott of the King's Island trip. We already have MovieCon that week, and I don't want to rejigger the schedule. King's Island going to be lame anyway, because King's Island is over-rated and going means spending an entire day with Patty, and that's just not cool. So, you're either in or you're out. Right now. The ultimate starship is Alfre Woodard's forehead.

 Arrgh! Michael, I TOLD you already, over and over, that I'm leaving on the 27th of August! So please bump musicalcon up! Haha, you're all in school right now. And I'm not. I got up at 10:43. I'm still wearing my pajamas. Smugness. I have to agree with Michael in that there should be two youth groups. I'm personally not much of a youth group person in that I keep my religious things very private, and the whole "let's all hold hands and pray and quote Bible verses and sing songs with total strangers" thing kind of makes me uncomfortable. But I think it would be much better if there was a younger group who could do that, and an older group that could be more self-directed... like, we know the Bible stories already, what do we think about them? Plus, I really don't think Patty knows how to handle older kids. Especially not older kids like us. I started coming to the youth group to hang out with you guys, not be yelled at by this perpetually jumpy woman. So, all in all, I'm kind of glad it's pretty much over for me. Anyway. The ultimate starship is Alfre Woodard's forehead.

 Comstocks, there is no possible way that you could appreciate either Levi or ChewBaccalaureates enough. For tonight was the night when two became one. No, wait that's not at all what happened. It was like Jed and Josh in "We Killed Yamamoto" or Jeremy and Natalie in "And the Crowd Goes Wild". For tonight, the continuing conflicts within the CPC Youth Group came to a head. I'm going to recap this for the Comstocks and Paul, because they have every right to know. Tonight, Patty had us play the Hide and Go Seek game, with one of the younger girls as "it." She proceeded to hide in the bi-partisan bathroom (Okay, it's uni-sex, whatev.) So we looked and eventually everyone was gone, and decided that they were in the bathroom. So we tried to get in, but the entire youth group was inside that bathroom, and ended up deciding to keep us locked out. Eventually, I said "Screw It." and we went back to the room-thingy. I warmed up a pizza and munched on it while we waited for them to come back. I made the "I find you loathesome and my hatred of you knows no bounds joke" when they did. So they decide to do round 2, and Thomas volunteers to hide, in what is the only other hiding space in the entire church, the darkened Choir Closet/Room/Thing. So we're not exactly thrilled with playing it again, especially as they didn't really seem to want us to play it. So we sat and talked for a while, and Patty came out and asked why we weren't playing, and I said, "Wasn't fun the first time, won't be the second." which was pretty much one of my "call it as I see it moments", but it was patronizing and Marten chastised me for it. He was right, as usual. Eventually the collective group figured out that was only one other hiding spot in the entire church, so they found Thomas, and paraded back to the room-thingy. Thomas came and sat down with us, and we talked for a couple of minutes before worship. Then Patty came. She wasn't happy with us sitting out of the game, because it's a youth group and it's supposed to be one and not two groups and that the fact that we sat out sent the message that we were better than everyone else or something else "that [she] could not begin to fathom". So we went back to the room-thingy and we sat through the stiffest Worship session ever, and then Patty decided to "clear the air" which basically was yet another passive-aggressive attack on Erin, Marten and I not playing Hide and Go Seek. By then it was 7:30 and we all left. I'm not going to editorialize. I'm just going to say two things. 1.) There's something wrong with a Youth Group expects High Schoolers to play Tag and Hide and Go Seek, week after week after week and also enjoy it. 2.) It's a two group Youth Group. The High Schoolers are going to segregate as their own group and The Girls segregate as their own group and with an age range as broad as the one at this group, it cannot be reasonably expected to function as one single group all the time. I'm probably hypocritical in saying this, but the Youth Group isn't working. Considering that I just joined the group two months ago, I'm not a expert on the dynamics and structure of a Church Youth Group. But sometimes an outsider is able to see things that others miss. It's the whole principle behind editing. I'm not going to be able to change policy, that'll (probably) be Jonah and Thomas's jobs. But we need change, and we need it soon. For this youth group will unite or it will fall. The ultimate starship is Alfre Woodard's forehead.

 Okay, Since I'm too lazy to edit that post, bump every one down a week so that the first Con is the 11th of June and the last one is the 27 of August. Also: Thomas is too busy. He's like a Comstock on steroids. He's going to be the first Compendium-er to have an ulcer. Or possibly drop dead of exhaustion. The ultimate starship is Alfre Woodard's forehead.

 Hey, Erin, guess what? Stephanie Gunderson is going to Hanover. Isn't that cool? She remembers you from elementary and middle school and was excited to hear you were going. Anyway, in other news: Today is the first day of the rest of my life, the last day of my life so far, and the middle day of a period of time which contains an amount of time before it and after it which are equal. The point of all that? There is none. Enterprise is safe, at least for another year. UPN is still to scared to axe Star Trek. I'm happy, because I think the show is finally coming into it's own and getting pretty good. It's still not level with TNG or DS9, but it's on Voyager or Original Series footing. Match up: 11 1/2 wins, because of the reason. The square root of orange also wins, but only on a technicality. Since I cannot surpass that level of weird, I will end the match-ups. Some day, I will start a new feature, a great feature, an amazing feature, the feature to end all features. But that day is not today! I only have one thing left to say to you, and this is it.

 ...Who do you think I'm going to agree with?" Okay Temporary JournalCon Dates: June 1 - WestWingCon (Season 1) - 3:00 June 11 - AnimationCon! - 3:00 June 18 - WestWingCon (Season 2) - 3:00 July 9 - MovieCon! - 3:00 July 17 - MusicalCon! With Special Guest "Camp" - 4:00 August 27 - FUTURECONS: "AngelCon!" "StarWarsCon!" and possibly, if the rest of us don't shoot it down "AnimeCon!" I only have one thing left to say to you, and this is it.

 I feel sad, and I don't know why... This has been going on for awhile now, and if anyone can inform me why I am sad, it would be greatly appreciated. In other news, section leaders, drum majors, band council members, and the concept/music of next years show were announced tonight. Jack McCarthy is now a drum major, which is a complete shock and joy. The trumpets will now be able to run the band through a puppet regime! The tyrannical reign of John Trippy is now officially over with the crowning of Natalie Perry, Becky Boruff, and Georgia Kuss as our new section leaders. Alice is also now a flute section leader. No one else knows the other section leaders. Our show next year will be completely awesome, but apparently I am not allowed to share with you what its concept is. I shall tell you all at a later time. On further note, school is almost over huzzah!! Congratulations to Marten, Jonah, and Nathan for all making Jeckyll and Hyde! By the time you read this, I will be 16! Finally.... I only have one thing left to say to you, and this is it.

 Okay, when I created the calendar, I didn't do it for my own benefit. Don't say "I have Triennium, blah, blah, blah, fishcakes." Post it on the calendar. Thank you. I'm open to hosting a double JournalCon. But I'm not sure that the current format of JournalCons (Watch TV, eat Pizza) would work well. I may be wrong. Float The West Wing by them and see what they think. I'm open to other idea (but I really don't think having them at any of the Bring-Your-Own-MovieCons is a good idea, we're pushing 24 hours of movie as it is. Also, the Login for the calendar is your Last name, first initial, and your password has eight letters and rhymes with "assword". You can change it to meet your needs upon login. I only have one thing left to say to you, and this is it.

 My summer schedule is shaping up. Jeckyll and Hyde, learning to drive, hopefully working with Somalian refugees, plus Triennium and Show Choir camp. Besides all that, part of each day has to be devoted to working out for Show Choir season and relearning German II. Hopefully there'll still be some time to relax. If not, though, I won't complain. I'm learning how to enjoy the busy life. I'm sure it's something that'll come in handy later in life. I only have two things left to say to you, and that was one, and I guess technically that was the other one, which makes this the third so actually I'm already way over.

 Ok, I don't know whose autobiography that is, but it's a wicked good title. Maybe for Martha Stewart. Anyway, Nathan and I made chorus! And so did Marten! And Sarah and I were talking, and we want to have a double journalcon with the sushi people at some point. Some of them are interested in meeting some of you or something. Paul, that is a strange project indeed, but I have a master plan to make mine awesome. Today's match-up. 11 1/2 vs the square root of an orange. 11 1/2 is armed with happiness, and the square root of an orange is clad in swiss cheese. They are playing psychological death handball by notation. The results of the last match, which was kept a secret for government reasons, is that General Brooks won, but the Easter Bunny was darn close. Everything else is classified. So, that's about it. I only have one thing left to say to you, and this is it.

 Okay, I'm officially through having ulcers trying to plan these JournalCons, so I've taken initiative. I've created a group schedule at Hunt Calendars. If you have something a week, please add it there so I don't have to go around and find all of you. Gratias, Tibi Ago, Domine. URL is here: urlLink http://www.huntcal.com/cgi/calview.cgi/Compendium/JournalCon I only have one thing left to say to you, and this is it.

 Well, I'm flattered that everyone thinks my house would be a good place for con. I'd be happy to have one of the many planned cons once schools out. Also, Marten (there I spelled it right) do you still play magic? If so, Tyler and I need a third person for and 3 on 3 sealed deck tournament on Saturday at the convention center. Speaking of Tyler, he says his invitation to the blog has expired, would someone send him another one? One last thing, I have the most bizarre final for AP world history. I have to make a wood carving like ones made by the Maori peoples of New Zealand that represents me. That's my final exam grade. That is 25% of my grade. How strange? I only have one thing left to say to you, and this is it. Nyerpe.

 Basic Plan here. WestWingCon: Season One 1. Pilot 2. A Proportional Response 3. The Crackpots and These Women 4. The Short List 5. In Excelsis Deo 6. Celestial Navigation 7. 20 Hours in LA 8. Six Meetings Before Lunch 9. Lies, Damn Lies and Statistics 10. What Kind of Day Has It Been WestWingCon: Season Two 1. In The Shadow of Two Gunmen, Part I 2. In The Shadow of Two Gunmen, Part II 3. The Midterms 4. Shibboleth 5. Galileo 6. Noel 7. 17 People 8. The Fall's Gonna Kill You 9. 18th & Potomac 10. Two Cathedrals I only have one thing left to say to you, and this is it.

 I have one day of high school left. It really hasn't hit me yet. It still seems like there's so much crap to do, and I don't think I'll be able to completely relax until I've seen my final grades. One Acts is tonight. Ha ha. That should be interesting. I can't believe I only have one more day as an active LC student. It's weird. It's scary. Hold me. Irrelevant spoiler of the day: I am running out of irrelevant spoilers. I must consider changing their format. For today, how about this... Episode III will probably be nothing like the episode of Gilmore Girls I have to miss tonight because of the stupid One Acts. I would say that's pretty accurate. I only have one thing left to say to you, and this is it.

 Marten, I hate to bring your hopes down, but there were fifty-nine people there today, and at least twenty were guys. We all still might have gotten in, but I certainly don't think any of us have it 'made'. And Rachel tried out! And she danced like a whore! Yay, Rachel! I got called back, but not to sing. I read for Utterson and then for Lord Savage, and then they told me to leave. Six or seven guys stayed after I and four or five others were dismissed. We're supposed to be called sometime tommorow. Hopefully I'll be home. Since I won't post tommorrow: Happy Birthday Ashley, thanks for sharing 5 1/2 of your 192 months with me. If you know what show my title is from you win a prize. Family members not eligible. I only have one thing left to say to you, and its-- AAAARGGGGggghhhhhhhh.

 I realized the 28th didn't work after I posted it, but forgot to change it. I like the 4th though. Any Con invented by a person is held at that person's house. That means that they have to cover all expenses up to and including food and drink and also have to have comfy sitting area. Paul and the Comstocks have this, I've never been to the homes of Marten, Erin, Sophia, Thomas, Rachel or Tyler so I can't judge their homes yet, however, I'm allergic to cats, so I don't think Marten's house will work. Okay Here's the schedule for Cons: MovieCon, WestWingCon, AnimationCon, WestWingCampCon, MusicalCon. We'll set dates to these when we get to that bridge. Okay, Tim's a little bitch, so I have to go. Toodles! I only have one thing left to say to you, and this is it.

 Oops! I forgot to mention that May 28th totally doesn't work for me. It does something completely the opposite of working. As does every single day in May up until the 30th, (although I think either the 30th or the 31st is also off) and also June 4, 5, and 6. I suggest we do it sometime after school gets out but before June 4th. That's just my opinion. The 28th is my graduation rehearsal during the day and my cousin's graduation in the evening. Also, how about doing it at somebody else's house this time? Also, does anyone else have an opinion on what movie I'm bringing? Also, if everybody wants Love Actually we have to have a separate StarWarsCon. Before or after September when the OT DVD comes out is up to you. When do I get to do the thingy at the bottom, and how? Irrelevant spoiler: You see that? They did that with CGI. I only have one thing left to say to you, and this is it.

 Okay, Galaxy Quest, Munchausen, Lost In Translation, (my pick)Love Actually and Ferris Bueller are in, even though I have ideological objections with it and Matthew Broderick. Seriously if I had to pick an actor who did funny work in the eighties, let his career slip in the 90s and who does great stage work now, I'd pick urlLink this guy . Broderick's just so smarmy! Although, he does get points for playing Bloom in The Producers. Still he impregnated Sarah Jessica Parker with his smarmy spawn and that is unacceptable! By the way: AnimationCon: Erin: Rachel: Tyler: Paul: Jonah: Chicken Run Nathan: Michael: Spirited Away Thomas: Sophia:DUMBO!!! Marten: and... MusicalCon: Erin: Camelot Rachel: Tyler: Paul: Jonah: Either Into the Woods or Newsies Nathan: Camp (if I can get a copy on DVD) Michael: The Sound of Music Thomas: Sophia:undecided...dangit. Marten: I only have one thing left to say to you, and this is it.

 I'm going to take this opportunity to make a random post. If Marten got one I do too. But first, my vote is for Yoda Nader, the wicked cucumber of the west. Dynomite is not for use with mouths. This is a valuable lesson, because when forgotten it leads to lots of corrective dental work. And speaking of corrective dental work, The country of Nigeria is soon to be taken over by hungry penguins. However, this is not as bad as it sounds. Because soon after they've taken over they'll have lunch, and then they'll be normal non-hungry penguins. and everyone knows that nonhungry penguins ae easily removed. Now onto wax: No. And now, onto the fifth chapter of the wombat. A long time ago in a small glass jar, there wasn't a wombat. Wasn't? Uh oh, it must have escaped!!!! Oh no! Watch out, it could be anywhere. Except Atlantic city. You know why? Cause ur mom, that's why! Boo-Yah! In conclusion, if you see my sanity, tell it it can stay in Hawaii, I'm doing just fine without it! I only have one thing left to say to you, and it's that my pants are on fire!!!!

 Yeah, pathetic title, I know. Anyway, I have no idea what movie I want to bring. You completely annhilated (i spelled that wrong, didn't I? curse late nights and little sleep!) two of my favorite genres. Does Silly Songs with Larry count as a musical? Cuz I understand that Dumbo's out thanks to the AnimationCon and Grease and whatnot is out until MusicalCon or whatever it'll be called...why don't you have a "ChickFlickCon" too so that I'm further lost. Yet not in translation. Haha. I'm hilarious. Anyway, I still have no idea what movie to bring. I'm sure Pirates of the Caribbean is taken or all bloggers are exhausted with the stunning performance of Johnny Depp. But I DON'T KNOW what to bring! I'll end up bringing a tape-turned-DVD of my 5th grade musical production thing and make ya'll sit through it. Ha, how'd you like THAT?! I only have one thing left to say to you, and this is it.

 Well, boys and girls, as far as movie JournalCon goes, I would like to put it to a vote. It shall be either Attack of the Clones, because Michael hasn't seen it (complete with constant snarking, of course-- I wouldn't ask anyone to watch it with a straight face), or Love Actually. For those of you who don't feel informed enough to vote, I shall inform you. AOTC is a rollicking impressive CGI adventure into the Star Wars universe, critically acclaimed as "better than The Phantom Menace." It chronicles the beginning of the Clone Wars, which were made famous in A New Hope with the line, "You fought in the Clone Wars?" (Indeed he did, Luke. Indeed he did.) Obi-Wan Kenobi is sent off to hunt down assassins (See "Dex's Diner") while, for reasons beyond all comprehension, the Jedi Council decides to send Anakin Skywalker to guard Senator Padme Amidala's body. They go to a pretty secluded place and Ani proceeds to seduce the Senator very badly. (Featuring the Worst Pickup Line Ever! And Intense Staring!) This is okay, however, because the Senator is very bad at being seduced. She keeps saying things like, "Don't look at me like that. It makes me uncomfortable," and "You'll be expelled from the Order," and "It will destroy us." Silly Padme. The only way to solve this problem is, of course, to go to Tatooine. Then there's a battle. There's nothing like a near-death experience for finding the way to a woman's heart. Love Actually is, indeed, The Ultimate Romantic Comedy. I can't recap all the plots, because look how long it took me to do just one. Basically, there's a wedding, there's an affair, people fall in love, Christmas is all around me, and on Christmas you tell the truth, and American girls are easy, and Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson, and Hugh Grant dancing around because he's Prime Minister and Billy Bob Thornton is President, and Keira Knightley, and female half nudity, and Portugese, and Liam Neeson and the arrivals gate at Heathrow Airport, and love actually is all around. I vote for Yoda. Do I even need to explain why? Fanfic rec of last week ("You might not care," etc.): "Pinch in Time." It's a Discworld fic, Carrot and Angua. Basically, Angua tries to run away again, but this fic is different from all the others with this setup, because Carrot can't say "Don't." Because somebody broke his lifetimer. And now Angua and Death and a dwarf watchman and Susan have to find out who and why and save him. I don't know if it'll get finished, it hasn't been updated in a while, but it's good. Poor Angua. It sucks to be a werewolf. I only have one thing left to say to you, and this is it.

 Nathan: If 40% of the running time of the movie has singing occuring, then it's a musical. Also, I'm considering an AnimationCon, so hold off on Animated movies too. Also, urlLink Monday is a big day for Nathan and Marten. Enjoy Boston, you two! [Would have been funnier if it were Jonah and I, if you remember that one youth group meeting. plus nate has a girlfriend, making him immune to gay jokes-Marten] I only have one thing left to say to you, and this is it.

 Gospel Music rules, y'all. Sophia, you missed a great show. Just wanted to say that. Ashley's birds apparently want me dead. Except Ziggy. I like Ziggy. He hasn't bitten me yet. Angel, on the other hand, tried to eat my face last night. [of course, knowing you two, Ashley probably did, too-Marten] Michael: Could you please define 'musical' for us. It's a thin line sometimes. I mean,there's movies with singing that aren't really musicals, but some people call them musicals. And common musicals that are technically opera. So I need to know exactly what you consider to be a musical before I choose a movie. In other news, the lack of votes in the democratic primary resulted in a tie between Daniel and The Duckman, and the Duckman won that pong match. Daniel, however is his running mate. Palpatine has chosen Christopher Lee as his running mate. Sharpton is running as an independant. Now for the incredibly politically absurd and cheesy 'green party' election. Nominees are: Kermit the Frog Yoda Larry the Cucumber The Wicked Witch of the West Ralph Nader (wearing green paint) SO GET OUT THERE AND VOTE. I only have one thing left to say to you, and this is it.

 I auditioned for Jekyll and Hyde today, and it went well, I suppose. I wasn't the first to be sent away, but not the last either. I'm pretty sure I've got atleast a chorus part. In terms of casting, at best I'm a pimp, at worst I'm a manservant. Ironic, isn't it? I might try out for Fiddler on the Roof at Carmel Community theatre as a back up Meanwhile, check out the lobby! I sound good again! I only have one thing left to say to you, and this is it.

 Okay, I'm in the early stages of planning MovieJournalCon. Does May 28th work for everyone? (Marten and I will be in Vincennes--Thomas) It's the day that school ends, ergo it's a half day, and we're going to need extra time for all these movies anyway. So edit your choices for movies in here below. RESTRICTIONS are ars follows: *NO MUSICALS! (We're having a seperate JournalCon for them. So don't bring one.) *Nothing over 140 minutes in length. * NOTHING ON VHS! DVD ONLY. This is an absolute must. Ladies and Gentlemen, Pick Your Movies. Erin: Sophia: Marten: The Adventures of Baron Munchausen Michael: Lost In Translation Jonah: Galaxy Quest Nathan: If Erin chooses Love Actually, I choose Episode II Rachel: Thomas: Ferris Bueller's Day Off Paul: Dr. No Tyler: You invited all my friends! And, in a move that stresses quantity over quality, you also invited all my enemies.

 Wow, Paul. It's only four years into the new millennium, so it might be a little early to pick the stupidest move yet. As of now, here are the nominees. NBC greenlighting "Coupling" and "Whoopi": May 2002 The war in Iraq: March 2003 Sorkin leaving "The West Wing": May 2003 Terrorists deciding to invoke the wrath of a Republican President: September 2001 Paul spelling Marten's name wrong at Compendium of Stupidity: May 2004. By the way, the titular speech is my persuasive speech, which I already posted on. I got the grade back and despite horrible horrible delivery, I still managed an 89. That's almost an A! Ha! What do you think of me now, suckas? You invited all my friends! And, in a move that stresses quantity over quality, you also invited all my enemies.

 I've got a massive splitting headache right now. The stupidest kid in an Algebra class chock full of stupid kids stole my special pen that Jonah gave me. I have to stay after school for Math Tutoring and ride the activity bus home, thanks to a deal with the Federales . My name is Michael, and today is one of the longest days of my life. Clever opening, huh? LC was interesting today, there was a house fire over by Harrison Hill and the smoke was being pumped into the ventilation system. Naturally, we smell smoke while in the Scene Shop. So we're freaking out because the scene shop is filled with paint (that's flame retardant, but still...), muslin, and a whole lot of wood. So we freak out until they find the source of the problem, namely the housefire on 56th St. We all had a good laugh about it afterwards. And by 'good laugh', I mean, not so much with the laughing, but more with the loud talking. I'm ready to declare Hall Sweeps a massive failure. Teacher's aren't locking their doors. Students are being missed by the metaphorical "brooms". So it's a yet another spectacular failure by the LC Admistration that will go down in the Hall of Really Bad, Stupid, Ill-Concieved Ideas with urlLink Edsels and urlLink The New Coke Claire IMed me again last night and said "I think you're cute and I've had fun talking to you and I'd like you to ask me out." Okay, I totally added those last two, but she did say that she thought I was cute, which is a big deal...for me... Eh...It'd never last. urlLink LC/LN romances never end up working out. [Not to mention she's twice your size. It would be an LN Drama romance, only in reverse-Marten] Especially if you end up dating a girl who types with her face. You invited all my friends!

 Sorry to double post but this is really important! But where do we fit in? How do I compare on the percentile-scale of true beauty? It's easy to find out! Here's the formula: "To do a self-analysis, draw an imaginary line from the pupil of your eye down toward your jaw. Draw a second line from the nostrils across your cheeks. The bottom of your cheekbone should fall at or below the intersection of these lines. If it is higher, your face may appear flat and masculine." I am beautiful!

 First off, Jonah, I need to have WORDS with you. Yes, they warrant capitalization. They also involve a person that I hate, and have said so to you on numerous occasions. If you weren't Poet Laureate of the Blog, I'd so absolutely kill you right now, it's not even funny. Also, you forgot Rachel in your Blog celebration, which also isn't funny. I gave my anti-PE speech today, and it was absolutely disasterous. I didn't get 30 seconds into the speech before every person in that room was looking at me like "Oh my God, what is that crazy [white] boy thinking?". I just had not cards so a lot of the eloquency got lost in translation and I just stumbled through a my outline. It was awful. I have one word for Hall. urlLink Tele-Prompter . Actually that's two words joined with a hyphen. My bad. You invited all my friends! And, in a move that stresses quantity over quality, you also invited all my enemies.

 I'm out of the archives of Triangle and Robert! Woo! Thankyou Jonah, for the wonderful anniversary post. I smiled many a time. I have only one thing left to say, and that is at the end of this post.

 So, I failed to mention that Ashley was cofounder of Ah, my aching sushi. This led to some fighting and...(I'm editing out Ashley's sn, in case she'd rather it not be all over the net) The Squid3188: I'm really sorry about all the killing Ashley: It's ok The Squid3188: But noe you're a creepy undead zombie Ashley: I know Ashley: And I want to avenge my death The Squid3188: crap Ashley: Hmm... A: And considering that you killed me A: .... A: Hmmm The Squid3188: The Devil made me do it The Squid3188: I mean A: I don't but that The Squid3188: It was nathan A: *buy A: I don't buy that either The Squid3188: he was secretly having an affair with Sarah A: I think you did it all on your own The Squid3188: so they plotted to trick me into posting the founder thing The Squid3188: so you'd attack me, and I'd have no choice but to kill you off A: I never attacked you A: I just blamed you for my death The Squid3188: even now they're off in the mountains toasting your death and laughing maniacly A: I know! A: I've known all along! A: YOu see, they had you do that, so that I'd kill YOU off The Squid3188: but why do I care if they're having an affair? A: You don't A: But they are evil adn wanted to kill you off A: THey had this idea that you'd interfer A: SO they got me to do it after I dies A: *died The Squid3188: but you won't A: But I will The Squid3188: that'd be playing right into the hands of the girl who betrayed you, took your boyfriend, and plotted the circumstances that led to your death! A: Right A: Give me a good reason not to The Squid3188: I'm on your side! We're both victims. But with my superpowers and your zombieness, we can defeat them A: Hmmm.... A: But what good would it do me? A: I'm already dead A: What do I care A: I could just kill you and then you and I could be dea together A: See? A: I'd have sompany The Squid3188: you said you wanted to avenge your death A: Yes A: ANd kill you The Squid3188: this is the way to do it The Squid3188: actually, no The Squid3188: you should kill me The Squid3188: that would teach them to run off with each other The Squid3188: we'll run off to a place they can't follow The Squid3188: very poetic A: Hmmm A: This reminds me of A midsummer night's dream A: But I don't know A: OR! A: I could kill you A: And then you coul kill off Nathan and I could kill off Sarah A: ANd so they'd also be dead The Squid3188: you know we'll all go to hell as murderers A: True A: Or I could just let you do the killing without killing you The Squid3188: Or we could end all the bloodshed and just have a big musical number A: OKay A: But I am still dead A: :-( The Squid3188: but if you can IM from beyond the grave, you should be able to sing A: Treu You invited all my friends!

 I would like all of here at Compendium to give Jonah a huge round of applause for producing that amazing 500th post celebration! (And I say big I mean disc world big, like four elephants on the back of a turtle floating through space big). Edit in all your big rounds of applause for Jonah! Yay Jonah!!! Laurence Fishburne (from Maui): Go Jonah! -You invited all my friends! And, in a move that stresses quantity over quality, you also invited all my enemies.

 Announcer: Welcome, ladies and gentlemen to the Compendium of Stupidity once-in-a-lifetime event, the night you've all been waiting for, well, okay, the night some of you have briefly waited for and the rest of you don't know or care about, welcome to... THE COMPENDIUM OF STUPIDITY 500 POST SPECTACULAR! with your host, William Shatner! *Stunning lack of Applause* William Shatner: Hi, I'm... William Shatner. Some of you... May know me as... Captain James T. Kirk from.... Star Trek. But today, I'm here to... host this... spectacular event. But first a... word from Jonah Comstock. Jonah: Guys, I'm really sorry. It was a last minute thing, and he was the only celebrity I could get! Really! Laurence is in MAui, and all the good Star Trek actors have too much pride. Jonathan Frakes: Not me! I'll do it! Didn't you see the will work for food sign! Shatner: Quiet you! Jonah: (Awkward pause) Anyway, I'm sure he won't be too bad. Shatner: Thank you... Jonah. I'm supposed to.... introduce our first... speaker. But, instead I'm going to... sing a song from my next... solo album. Donald Trump: You're Fired. Jonah: He's so right. Hey Donald, you want to host. Trump: No, but I am interested in buying out this blog. Jonah: We'll work this out. Mean while, let's welcome our first guest, Marten. Marten: Sometime ago, I started this fine blog late on a friday night. Maybe it was thursday,or some other night all together. The point is that I started it. and Nate didn't. Sure he was there, but it was my machine, dram it. I posted first. It was about thinking I was pregnant because of an irrational craving for peanuts. I'm glad I'm male. Also, just because Michael had the first blog doesn't mean it was his idea. Jerry Springer: We didn't tell Marten, but we've brought fellow bloggers Nathan and Michael to the studio. (At this point the words "He took credit for my blog and is sleeping with my mother" appear at the bottom of the screen) Nathan: You're taking credit for my blog! Michael: And you're sleeping with my mother! (A humorous fight ensues, until the security finally tear them apart) Announcer: We'll be back after these messages. Message 1: The doctor called to confirm your appointment for 3:00 Message 2: The Germans! They're invading! Ahhh! Message 3: Don't do drugs. Announcer: By "messages", I kinda meant advertisements. Messages: Like anyone would pay to advertise on this show. Announcer: What ever. Welcome back to the 500 post spectacular, with your host The Olsen Twins. Mary Kate (Or possibly Ashley): You know, we ARE two people! The other one: Did you see that, Ashley? Our speaker credits are even mixed up. Mar- Ash- Who cares?: That's it. We are so leaving. The next guest is somebody. Thomas: I have loved this blog like a child. I can't believe it's 500 now! It seems like yesterday when this blog was 10! It may seem like I ignored the blog for awhile, but it was a secret affair between the blog and I. (Thomas winks a huge wink at the camera) Jonah: I kinda need to buy some time here. Trump: Well, now that you mention it Jonah: Quiet you! Anyway, here's Amaris "Sarah" Moon, founder of Compendium-based blog "Oh my aching sushi." Sarah: Compendium is the sole reason for my existence, the lone joy in my life, the one truth in a world of darkness. Without Compendium, there would be no such thing as "Oh, My Aching Sushi!" (collective gasp) Compendium is my inspiration to go out and make a difference in the world. It has made me learn to stop and wonder about the big things in life, such conundrums as whether the staff at McDonald's is actually conspiring against me every time they forget the cheese on my Cheddar Melt. I owe everything to Compendium. Adam West: Wow. That was beautiful. By the way, I'm Adam West. You might remember me as Batman. Remember Batman? Wasn't he cool? Wasn't I cool? Cooler than Toby Macguire. I mean what kind of super hero is a nerd? Jonah: *ahem* Adam West: I'm here to tell you about how you can make money in your sleep. Jonah: *ahemhem* Adam West: I mean, our next guest is Taul Pyler, who recently suffered a cloning accident, but is both a new blogger and a prospective one. Pyler: Hi, I'm Tyler. Or Paul. Nevermind. Anyway, I've only been with Compendium a little while but... Wait a minute, I'm not on Compendium yet, I'm still no wait. I've got a headache. No I don't! Announcer: And that's all we have time for. Now, to finish off this magical night, a montage of past templates All characters portrayed in this blog are fictional. Any resemblence to a real person, living or dead is one hell of a coincidence. SQEE! SQUEE! SQ(U)EE! Yar, This Be a Super Ball! ~.... what's that guy's name, anyway? Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog. Woof! I don't like it. I don't like it at all. It's okay! I had Subway! Whats the point of calling it a laptop if you're not supposed to use it on your lap? Good Lord, there's a modem in my shoe! He'll try to tuck and roll, but it won't work because he has square pants Does my sexiness offend you? Wacky is filling your car's gas tank with 3-octane gasoline. Absurd is filling your car's tank with a ferret. I fell down the chimney onto a flaming goose! Well, rotate my vertices and call me a trapezoid! I know from sparrows to starlings. After that, everything's a duck, as far as I'm concerned. Oy with the fishcakes already! Stop Kemps! We're playing Euchre! The vegetable must be destroyed. The vegetable must NOT be destroyed! History is about to crack wide open. Millennium Approaches. History is about to crack wide open. Hold on to something. History is a giant crack. Sorry, I couldn't help myself But you could be having sex with Yoko Ono right now! It's the smell of freedom... and the chemicals they treat your dashboard with. But you also find yourself saying 'Natalie, if you screw that up again I'll set you on fire.' Shut up, Carrie. You don't want a baby. You want shoes. Tammy's testicle ad may compromise our ability to win this task. Stop this war! Shame on you, Hobbits! It arrests this war, his disonore of the main extremities of the title! That's Adorable!

Anyway, he seems like he'd be the guy who scores drugs for everyone, except there are never any drugs in musicals. He says he can get a "samurai sword" and some "grass skirts." Huh? What the hell are people into on this island? This car belongs to the evil Dr. Stegman, who parks in spots that don't belong to him and finds Andrew McCarthy to be petulant and oddly short. It's raining turkeys; what more do you need?! It came with a matching tie, using a liberal definition of the term "matching" They're both made of fabric? Pretty much.' It's time to bring this ship into the shore, and throw away the oar forever. Why shake hands when we can shake...other things? Like Lips. The Betty-one looks drowsy! Oh my God, you're putting my mother's cats on the Supreme Court. It is his love, it is his life, it is his fault he didn't lock the garage! You invited all my friends! And, in a move that stresses quantity over quality, you also invited all my enemies. Robo-host: Well, that was just wonderful, wasn't it? So many memories. Now blog member Sophia would like to say a few words. Sophia: I just wanted- Robo-host: Word limit of few(def: 3) words reached. Discontinue talking. Now, we'll conclude with Erin, who is with us via satellite. Erin: Do I get to talk? Or are you going to cut me off? (pause for answer) Robo-host: 5 second pause signifies talking finished. That's our show, goodnight everyone. (Robo-host explodes)

 Whoa, I don't check in for a few days and bang everything is all...blue. I kind of like it though. Anyways, I got a new cello, and its a vast improvement over my old crappy cello with a crack in it. What else, Oh yeah, I'm going to be on Cats eye next year. For you LC people, its LN's news/announcment show. I'll probably get stuck with some boring job like lighting though. Also I played in a magic tournament and did really bad. You wouldn't believe how anal some people are about the rules. In a high whiney voice "No, you can't play that because your second main phase is over and that signifies that all damage on the stack is removed so you'll have to wait until my upkeep to do that, and then it won't do you any good. Gosh did you like learn to play yesterday or something?" pshht Did you learn to play with a stick up your butt or something? What a loser, even though I lost that one. Well, I'm done. You invited all my friends! And, in a move that stresses quantity over quality, you also invited all my enemies

 I'm taking advantage of an altogether to brief respite in my incredibly busy life to complain about it. I'm doing too much, and it's driving me insane. I'll skip on the details. But basically, I'm about to find out how much one person can take before he just shuts down. Come spring pops show Wednesday at 7:00. It's the only chance you'll get to see my hip and trendy disco attire. Trust me, you don't want to miss it. My pants are tight and flair at the bottom. It is most humorous. When things cool down and I have time, I'm gonna get my new blog up. It will contain most humorous recaps of my life, leaving this blog for more intelligent discussion. Things cool down around May 30th, btw. No. The title makes no sense. Don't ask. You invited all my friends! And, in a move that stresses quantity over quality, you also invited all my enemies.

 Okay, I'm grounded for a couple of days, so my posts will happen early in the morning, during lunch and after my parents go to sleep. Because I'm all about the circumvention. I kind of miss the ability to read previous posts so that you could respond to things in them. That was cool. Damn. I just realized that I screwed up the Corndog link. I'm going to fix that now. I had something I wanted to say, but I totally forget what it was now. You invited all my friends! And, in a move that stresses quantity over quality, you also invited all my enemies.

 So, I fixed MIchael's changes to the template and deleted that useless Previous Posts thing. However, I'm not sure it'll publish, because the stupid thing has said 19% for sometime now. Ok, it worked, but I still can't figure out why our sidebar migrates to the bottom. It's quite annoying. You invited all my friends! And, in a move that stresses quantity over quality, you also invited all my enemies.

 The new format's cool, but the links and cruft is all down at the bottom.... how'd that happen? oh, and when Im too lazy to find a web comic quote, Im using the random advertising slogan generator to come up with a title You invited all my friends! And, in a move that stresses quantity over quality, you also invited all my enemies.

 The blue doesn't seem to be the classic Compendium style... Oh well. BOOO! Scared you! -You invited all my friends! And, in a move that stresses quantity over quality, you also invited all my enemies.

 Okay, I fixed the links and changed blog format. It took a long time, so my friends, if you want to change it back to the boring-ass format we had before, you can do that, we’re all administrators here. You can conquer the blog, like Charlemenge, but you better be prepared to fix the links aftwerwards and that takes frigging forever! You invited all my friends! And, in a move that stresses quantity over quality, you also invited all my enemies.

 Marten, I'll fix your damn links when I get around to it. Blogger is awesome now, and since autistic people don't adjust well to change that's really big coming from me. I would like to change the format. We're at 8 months. We're a blog in our prime, we're a prime blog. Anyway, I really don't have anything to say. I sleep now. Not literally actually. It's more of a metaphorical sleep. You invited all my friends! And, in a move that stresses quantity over quality, you also invited all my enemies.

 I don't think I've ever made this much more sense than Erin, except maybe durring our arguement about whether or not a werewolf would change while she was pregnant. LuckEdc: Can you melt down anvils? MysteriousBob87: probably MysteriousBob87: i mean, how else would you make one? LuckEdc: well... you could carve it... out of... iron... rocks. MysteriousBob87: ... MysteriousBob87: no. you cant. LuckEdc: why not? MysteriousBob87: because. iron rocks wouldnt be carved LuckEdc: but why? MysteriousBob87: if they were weak enough to be carved then you couldnt bang hot sheets of metal on them without messing up the anvil LuckEdc: well, that's just the problem, isn't it. because you bang HOT metal on the anvils and so they could'nt be melted down. so where are the anvils now? MysteriousBob87: the hot metal isnt melted metal MysteriousBob87: its just hot MysteriousBob87: ive got one in my garage actually LuckEdc: but it would make the anvil hot, so the anvil would melt. MysteriousBob87: no it wouldnt LuckEdc: maybe that's where they are. they're all in people's garages. MysteriousBob87: you cant melt an anvil with something that isnt hot enough to be melted itself LuckEdc: hmmm... LuckEdc: point: marten MysteriousBob87: w00t! On a side note, Blogger is annoying now! I want my links back! screw profiles, if they want to know who I am they can read the Archives. I sound like triangle complaining at the cartoonist... You invited all my friends! And, in a move that stresses quantity over quality, you also invited all my enemies.

 We have a fansite! That's so cool! In other things, since there are like a dozen new schemes, in the spirit of "Change is Good", we should redesign Compendium. It'll be like that episode of The Simpsons with the Flaming Moe, and they change the bar style. We'll have a understated yet elegant monogram at the top of the page! Ha! Yeah, right. If we revamp with this crowd it's going to look like urlLink Circus Circus . But it might eliminate the Italicization of Mass Destruction. Just an idea... I'm extending an invitation to anyone at Compendium who is free on the 22nd of May (and who are not Erin or Thomas) and wants to go to a TWoPcon in Lafayette. It'll be fun! You invited all my friends! And, in a move that stresses quantity over quality, you also invited all my enemies.

 False alarm, never mind... Don't know what I'm talking about? Sounds like a who can guess competition to me! There could be cookies awarded! All are eligible for entrance accept for Michael, who already knows. If you ask him, certain death shall befall you! Cookie Cookie Cookie! -It is his love, it is his life, it is his fault he didn't lock the garage!

 I've officially decided to stop including people's names in this title scheme. I am posting to say that we appear to have been urlLink copied! They want to make sure we aren't offended, so if anyone is, post and let me know. Otherwise they officially have our okay. Others of you are probably wondering who they are. One is Nate's girlfriend. The other two are not. Also: Resolving the "Wal" match-up. "today I'm setting up a big match involving a walrus, a walleye, a wallet, a walnut, a wall, Walt Disney, and Wally from DIlbert. The will battle it out at Wal-Mart. They may only use weapons purchased at Wal-Mart and have ten dollars to spend. I'm giving all inatimate object telekinesis with a three foot range that can't be used on people directly." I assumed the walrus ate the walleye right off. Wally probably ate the walnut, telekinesis or none. Walt Disney spent his 10 dollars on a pad of paper and a pencil, hoping to animate something vicious. Unfortunately he stashed the money in the Wallet, which added it to it's own and used it to buy a sledge hammer, which it started hacking at the wall. The wall collapsed on the wallet, killing it, and used it's telekinesis to hurl the sledge hammer at the Walrus, which was too big too dodge it. Meanwhile, Disney used the little money he had to buy a fifty cent eraser, and erased Wally. He used Wally's money to buy a pen and paper and animated a wrecking ball to take out the wall. Therefore, Walt Disney wins! You invited all my friends! And, in a move that stresses quantity over quality, you also invited all my enemies.

 You guys won't believe this one: You're France! Most people think you're snobby, but it's really just that you're better than everyone else. &nbsp;At least you're more loyal to the real language, the fine arts, and the fine wines than anyone else. &nbsp;You aren't worth beans in a fight, unless you're really short, but you're so good at other things that it usually doesn't matter. &nbsp;Some of your finest works were intended to be short-term projects.

 You're Thailand! Calmer and more staunchly independent than almost all those around you, you have a long history of rising above adversity. Recent adversity has led to questions about your sexual promiscuity and the threat of disease, but you still manage to attract a number of tourists and admirers. And despite any setbacks, you can really cook a good meal whenever it's called for. Good enough to make people cry. My book quiz was a tie, because my opinion of stream of consciousness depends on the context. Now, look: Isn't this second one creepy? You're Ulysses! by James Joyce Most people are convinced that you don't make any sense, but compared to what else you could say, what you're saying now makes tons of sense. What people do understand about you is your vulgarity, which has convinced people that you are at once brilliant and repugnant. Meanwhile you are content to wander around aimlessly, taking in the sights and sounds of the city. What you see is vast, almost limitless, and brings you additional fame. When no one is looking, you dream of being a Greek folk hero. You're The Mists of Avalon! by Marion Zimmer Bradley You're obsessed with Camelot in all its forms, from Arthurian legend to the Kennedy administration. Your favorite movie from childhood was "The Sword in the Stone". But more than tales of wizardry and Cuban missiles, you've focused on women. You know that they truly hold all the power. You always wished you could meet Jackie Kennedy.

 Or Things I'm Irrationally Pissed At: TV Edition! ABC: Thank You, ABC. Thank you for delivering a kick-ass episode of Alias last week. However making us wait two weeks for the finale? Not Cool. Airing 232 minutes of Harry fucking Potter? Not cool. ESPECIALLY SINCE THE MOVIE IS 152 MINUTES LONG! I'm absolutely not seeing the next crap-ass installment of this crap-ass movie franchise. I'm thrilled it made Fametracker's inessential movie list. Go screw yourself, Rowling! The Swan: Because it's wrong. And they replaced Wonderfalls with reruns of this misogynistic crap disguised as entertainment. Hell, all FOX reality is misogynistic crap. And I'm spent. Good night and have a pleasant tomorrow.

 Bloody hell, it happened again! everything posted before the book and country thing is italisized. It is his love, it is his life, it is his fault he didn't lock the garage!

 > You're Liechtenstein! Most folks don't take you that seriously, but you really make a big deal out of being independent. &nbsp;You don't do a whole lot for other people, but you make the best of the resources available to you. &nbsp;You really like snow. &nbsp;And mountains. &nbsp;And being independent. &nbsp;And you're probably pretty small.

 Huh, Iceland. It kinda makes sense, if you replace cold and forbidding with something else. Not sure what the best words would be... Orchestra: We lost. Okay, we got second place. But we should have got first. And it's bugging me more than I thought it would. I just came expecting to win and have it not really be a big thing, then when we didn't it's like, WTF mate? And they called it runner up, too. It's not second place, it's runner up. It's like saying, "you were almost the best, but they beat you and you're losers." But enough about that! Afterward it was the best day ever! I left with Mowi and Celeste, and we went to weird Japanese stores with imported candy and stuff. It was awesome! The weirdest stuff ever, it tastes great. I found Shrimp flavored chips. Then we went to Mowi's uber-awesome house and watched AKIRA. It's freakin weird. Don't ever watch it unless you really want to. Food was great. It is his love, it is his life, it is his fault he didn't lock the garage!

 And now my real post. I have a reason for not putting all this in the last post, but I don't feel like typing it right now. We got 8th at State! When you consider that it's out of, like 321 choirs, thats not bad. Everyone was really awesome. It was fun. Tracy found my dream log by typing her name into a search engine and got all creeped out, so I'm going through and misspelling everyone's names on it. I'm to tired to type coherently anymore so I'm going to bed. Night! It is his love, it is his life, it is his fault he didn't lock the garage!

 I really am feeling good. It took every ounce of strength to get me through today, and I came home and checked Damn Hell Ass Kings, which led me to find out that there's a new Six Feet Under teaser trailer on HBO.com (Seriously, go check it out. It's the most awesome and bizarre thing of all time. If you haven't seen Peter Krause lip-sync "Feeling Good" by Nina Simone, you haven't seen Shakespeare the way it's meant to be seen.) Speaking of that, I want to bring everyone (Paul, Rachel, Sophia) up to speed on Sports Night. With that in mind... Previously on Sports Night: Casey loved Dana. Dan liked Rebecca but got smacked down when she went back to her idiot husband. Dana had a brother that played in the NFL. Natalie and Jeremy hooked-up and had several annoying fights. Issac had a stroke. There was an audio recap/montage, and season one was over. It is his love, it is his life, it is his fault he didn't lock the garage!

 Okay, Nathan. I'll set up a mattress on the other side of the basement for you to get six hours of sleep. Pizza is going to be one cheese (for me), one pepperoni, one half red onion and pineapple. Dig? My house, 5:30, 7th of May. It is his love, it is his life, it is his fault he didn't lock the garage!

 Well, its happened again. Something very creepy and ironic has happened to me. Here I am sitting in the library of my mom's school, Mary Castle. I'm sitting at a computer right next to a wall rsvping for Mighael's thing with pizza. When I finish, I just happen to look to my left and what should I see taped to the wall 5 inches from my head? A paper that explaning what a blog or weB LOG is. Now is that just about the most creepy and ironic thing you've ever heard or what?! I mean what are the chances of that? Maybe I'm just being paranoid or maybe someone just out of earshot is having a good laugh. All I know is that I need to finish my homework so I'm done. It is his love, it is his life, it is his fault he didn't lock the garage!

 RSVP HERE! Also add Preferred Pizza Topping. Erin:RSVP. Those toppings are fine with me. Marten: Thomas: Pepperoni and red onion for me. Stuff Crust if possible. I am rsvping Jonah: Not onion or mushroom, other than that whatever. I'm a fan of pineapple but I'm guessing I'm alone. Nathan: Meat of any sort and tomato. I'll warn you, I'm gonna have toget at least 6 hours of sleep, no question. State competition saturday. Paul:rsvping, pepperoni, and I'd like to know what and when I'm rsvping for. Rachel: Sophia:RSVPing, I believe. I majorly heart veggie pizza...but if nothing else...green onion. Yummy! Tyler: It is his love, it is his life, it is his fault he didn't lock the garage!

 Paul, you idiot! You're invited to JournalCon! In other news, I'm in the library! They weren't core 40-ing today, so I got in! And after I schlepped The binder of West Wing season one recaps to school! Also, I'm coming (and also recapping) Meeting of the Minds tonight. And if I remembered the date (the 22nd?) I'd go to the LN one too. It is his love, it is his life, it is his fault he didn't lock the garage!

 First of all, I would like to say happy birthday to Michael (I'll see you in youth group for your birthday hits). Well, here I am on the verge of a 4 hour AP world history test. Why, do you ask, am I squandering precious study time to write a post on how I am squandering my precious study time? Because I... uh... AHHH!! I'VE GOT TO GO STUDY!!! It is his love, it is his life, it is his fault he didn't lock the garage!

 Okay, Sars just wrapped up the Famous Ghost Monologues today. And from what I've seen, it'd make an awesome one-act play. And even though Horrigan would never go for it, it would make an awesome play. Seriously, it'd be cheap as hell too. Costumes, makeup, lights and some props. No sets. No Backdrops. No Special Effects. And if we don't do them here, I'd absolutely love to do one or two at the CPC Talent Show. It is his love, it is his life, it is his fault he didn't lock the garage!

 Okay, I did the title and the description. I'm officially declaring May 3rd-7th "Michael's Birthday Week!" The Comstocks thought too small, ha ha for them. They didn't get a week. They got three days. HA! I mock them! It is his love, it is his life, it is his fault he didn't lock the garage!

 haha, sorry, stupid name. I thought of an awesome one last night but then I promptly forgot it. Oh woe is me. Is that how you spell woe? Anyway. THIS WEEKEND WAS AWESOME! Saturday we got a doggie!!!!! Her name's Martie (short for Martini...at least that's what I say) and she's part doberman so she's colored like that...black and brown...and has a brown eye and a blue eye. Isn't that awesome?! She's the sweetest dog you'd ever meet, too. Yay for doggies! But then, after that, I SAW BEN FOLDS!!!!!! OMG. The only reason I'm telling you guys is because my TOD isn't working. BUT HE WAS A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!! I would have his children ANYDAY. haha, sorry Marten. :D If you have never heard of Ben Folds you should wear the hat of shame. He is God. It is his love, it is his life, it is his fault he didn't lock the garage!

 There's only one question this week. What would you like other people to say about you if you weren't there? Michael : "He'll kill you. And then he'll go to work on you." Jonah : "Nobody is as awesome as Jonah. If there were an emperor of awesome, it would be he. One time, I looked up awesome in the dictionary and saw his picture. And not just any picture - an awesome picture. It showed him being awesome by driving an awesome car into a pool of flaming sharks. And that's what he does on his less awesome days. Most of the time he's like 10 times as awesome as that." Nathan "Wow, that Nathan, he sure isn't gay. Not gay at all. Totally un-gay. So not gay, he's straight," (girls)'I'm happy" (guys) "Too bad" Sophia "Yeah, she's a really great girl once you get to know her. I promise, she's not always psychotic!" Marten "Cool. Original, but classic. That guy is even more awesome than Jonah." but the conversation is more likely to go like this: "what a loser." "shut up! he's cool" "isn't.""ass" the second person probably being Thomas. I think I took this one too far. It is his love, it is his life, it is his fault he didn't lock the garage!

 School is wearying. Another wasted srt. That Career Day was the most waste of time thing that I have ever been to. I signed up for Government/Social Services and Performing Arts/Arts. Well the first one that I went to was the government. Or so I thought... It turns out that they had gotten and a policeman and a fireman to come to educate about two careers that I will go into when hell freezes over. The only uplifting part is that the policeman whipped out his, I know what you're thinking and your wrong, taser. He turned it on briefly then tucked it back in it's holster. "I think we should liven thinks up a bit and ask the police officer to taser the fireman"-Michael. Mercifully, that bit ended at the end of first session. Little did I know the horrors that were waiting for me in the LGI Room. At the time, I was relieved that we might actually learn something useful. After all, Performing Arts is sort of my thing. So there we were, Carl Cote, Mark Yates. Then, to our horror, the women introduces herself as a "Landscapist." Naturally all three of us were like "WTF MATES?!" A general murmur of what the hell, this isn't art arose from the disquieted audience. Well she went on to explain that there was somewhat of a link between landscaping and art. I could sort of understand this, so I figured this must be the Art part of Performing Arts/Arts. We sat through her presentation politely, and eventually, it was time for the next speaker to come on. We figured that this would be a vocalist or some other sort of musician. We were dead wrong. I seem to recall her opening line as "I know that this clinic said performing arts, but I am going to stick to the regular art." Regular art?! HA! She was a fucking (excuse my language, but it is called for) interior designer. The crowd was shocked. A slow quiet came over the whole room as we realized that we were about to receize a 20 minute lecture on interior design. Luckily for us, we had Mark's digital camera and entertained ourselves by taking pictures of Carl's feet in various positions. Contact Mark Yates if you want copies. Don't get me wrong, we did try to leave, but my counselor decided at that moment to sell her soul to the devil and block our only exit. At the end, there was a time open for questions. The first was asked by Ghetto McGhettoson (name changed to protect the innocent). It was as follows: "What the hell? This isn't performing arts! What instrument do ya'll play?" Then my demon-filled counselor made weak statements about the name saying bother performing arts and arts, and that they chose to focus on art. Art? Art my ass. Interior Designing does not cut it for a room full of people from the LC music department. My imp of a councelor ended up asking the vast majority of the questions. She is going to have to answer to the students, and it will not be a pretty site. [Not a pretty site? Will it be webcast? --Michael] Will I ever go willingly to another Career Day at LC? I think not. There will have to be some serious grade reduction to force me to go... Anywho, on to Chicago. It was wonderful! We stayed at this nice hotel downtown called "Club Quarters." It had an awesome location, and everything was in walking distance. On Friday night, we went to the symphony and heard the Chamber Orchestra of Europe play "Midsummer's Night Dream" by Menddehlson, and quite a few selections from Bach. It was freaking awesome. At the beginning, their intonation was slightly off, but they really locked it in quickly and for the rest of the night. The applause at the end was humorous. The director, Andras Schiff, came back out like six times, and even had the symphony play an encore. Some of the members looked startled at the blast of applause even. Also, someone in the orchestra has the greatest name ever. "Nimrod." On Saturday morning, we went to the Art Institute of Chicago to see the Rembrandt exhibit. It was good and everything, but it didn't really "touch me" as some would say. Not enough color, and too many faces. He seems like he was a really serious guy. I much prefer things like Van Gogh and Manet. After that, we drove home. I got to drive about 3/4 of the distance, which was great! Hurry for learners permits! Well, that about wraps up this post. Oh ya, I watched Blues Brothers recently, and my new explanation for everything I do is "We're on a mission from God" in that awesome Dan Akroyd Chicago accent. Oh by the way Erin, May is lusty? I didn't know that months had emotion and feelings!? Oh well, you learn something new everyday. Good Night! I sleep now! -It is his love, it is his life, it is his fault he didn't lock the garage!

 Thanks, Nathan. Apology accepted. And sorry for doubting you. This weekend is just one big episode of seeing my family over and over and over again. Have been bored a lot. Fanfiction Recommendation of the Week ("You might not care, but I do"): "Eye of the Storm" on fanfiction.net. It's about several OT Star Wars characters getting stuck on Earth. In the Star Wars universe it was in between ESB and ROTJ. On Earth it's the middle of convention season. Not as bad as most with that general setup as there are no fangirls. Quote: "I think I need my dosage checked. At the moment I'm in Colorado with my ex-husband and Luke Skywalker while Artoo Detoo serves iced tea and my son plays with a Princess of Alderaan in the kitchen." She gave a high-pitched, hysterical laugh. "So are really, really realistic hallucinations a common side effect of that new stress medication you put me on?" It's May, it's May, the lusty month of May! :) Oh my God, you're putting my mother's cats on the Supreme Court.

 I had a weird dream last night. There we're odd looking flying machines, like spaceships from an anime, or something, and I was hearing a radio news program explaining why they worked. Eventually, I drove one to pick up Sophia, who was trappied in Sophie's body, (Sophie was one of the four yearolds from vbs) and we had to try and find a way to get her out. Meanwhile, Sophie was still in her own body, and I kept losing track of Sophia, so I had to ask Sophie to let her say things. then I woke up in another dream, that I don't remember. Then I really woke up. Supposedly, your subconcious knows everything, but i disagree. I think you notice somethings, and your subconcious only notices the rest. thats why dreams seem to mean something some times, but they're really just random and weird. My birthday is tomorrow! Ouch! A ferret is beating me about the shins!

 I think its been too long since I've posted. A whole month of precious summer is almost gone, how can this be? So far this has been an informative summer. I've learned important life lessons such as, wearing shoes without socks hurts after a few days, staying up to watch late night T.V. results in very unproductive mornings, and eating nothing but Trix and pizza is bad for you in many ways. Well, that is all. Only 2 weeks until my birthday, YAY! Ouch! A ferret is beating me about the shins!

 I feel really urlLink weird . As in not normal for me. I couldn't sleep friday night at the church thing, so I went to the multi-purpose room, put in one of my cds and danced. It had to look stupid to anyone not listening to the music. Oh well. It was 2 in the morning, and I couldn't sleep. It was the strangest thing I've done recently. I feel really strange. Ouch! A ferret is beating me about the shins!

 I'm back. Words cannot express how much I love Chicago. Or how much my feet hurt after a weekend in Chicago. But anyway, we took our dear cousin and her boyfriend up to Chicago for the weekend, and did stuff. We went to the Sears Tower, ate lunch at the Weber Grill, stayed at the Inter-Continental (again) and basically kicked it old school. Also, in a sports related event (I know, I can hear you scrolling right now) Tim Henman (Awesome British Tennis Player) is on track to possibly win Wimbeldon (the Super Bowl of Tennis). And that would be really cool. But even if he does make it to the finals, he'd probably be beat by Andy Roddick (Awesome American Tennis Player). Okay, I'm done now. Ouch! A ferret is beating me about the shins!

 Eh, I definitely forgot what the name of our possible sitcom was going to be, but whatever. I have a semi-major emergency. I lost my phone. My cell phone. I feel so naked without it...I think I left it at the church. So, if you guys are going tomorrow for church (which I guess you are) could you ask Patty if anyone found a blue cell phone? I hope nobody stole it...although that'd be doubly awful seeing as I lost it in a church! Ouch! A ferret is beating me about the shins!

 This is my first post in a while, and I intend to make it a good one. Or at very least a long one. We’ll see how it goes. Actually this post is pretty much going to be a White House Press Briefing. - It’s amazing that since Sophia quit, she’s said more on the outside than she ever did as a Blogger. Not that I don’t want her to come back, I’m just saying. - Okay, Thomas made a hilarious gaffe today. It’s number five on the list of hilarious puns Hilarious Gaffes and Typos 1. “I hate him with the power of a thousand flaming nuns!” – Someone at TwoP 2. “I’m too busty to get a job!” – Jonah 3. “I’m feeding my dick!” – Ashley 4. “Red Roof Inns don’t have Colonial Breakfast!” – Thomas 5. "Is that a homo?" - Tim on seeing a homeless person in Chicago. Okay, so I've seen The Terminal, which was good, and I saw Shrek 2, which was more jokes than story this time, so it was almost but not quite as good as the first. I was saddened to hear that Jonah is staying in Marching Band, although I'm happy that he got a kick-ass deal to do it. I also, in the spirit of giving, have new stuff for everyone including myself. I got The Simpsons Season Four on DVD, and TiVo for my dad for fathers day, and Presents for pretty much everyone else (blog-wise anyway) Also my Cousin (and her boyfriend) are in town, and we're showing them the "Best of Indiana", which is roughly equivelent to "The Most Mediocre of Anywhere Else." However, due to some odd reason, neither of them have seen any of the Lord of the Rings movies, so we're giving them a crash course in Tolkien while they're here. Just our gift to them. Okay, it's 11:30 and I have swimming tomorrow, so I have to go bye-bye now. Bye, everyone! Ouch! A ferret is beating me about the shins!

 so tired.... too much input. brain ready to explode. can't remember........anything. neglecting everything. I feel like I'm in a dream. I'm gonna be out of it for....a while now. but I will return. Ouch! A ferret is beating me about the shins!

 Well, off I go to Florida tomorrow morning. I'll be back July 4th. By the time I get back, I wish for everyone to have RSVP'd to my King Arthur invitation. Yes or no? Which day? I'm going to be bored in Florida. You can read outside, but you can't write outside, and I'm going to get sunburned anyway, or return as pale as I am right now. I'll want to stay inside all the time, and my mom will make me go outside, and I'll be bored. And my brother will drive me crazy. In fact, by the time it's over, everybody in my family will be driving me crazy. We still don't have our DSL back. I'm beginning to think it will be like the heat in Mr. Davis's room and we'll get it back only when we least expect it. In a few years. Sigh. "I don't hold with forn parts." - Esmerelda Weatherwax Ouch! A ferret is beating me about the shins!

 Well, you know how we made it into the thrilling and tragic musical lair of the fairy people. Shut up Jonah, you ruined the whole thing. Maybe we should give up on the word by word thing. Ha! Noffke rhymes with off key, there's another Jonah, and the Bishop gets set on fire! There's a giant moon, and the floor is red, like most everything else. It's all red, black and white. Come see the show. Hopefully our publicity manager won't get mad about this. In other news, Eighteen four-year-olds. 'nuff said. Details in individual posts. You're mother is an aardvark, and your father smells of eldeberries. You can't mix quotes! Okay, don't say that. Jonah caved! He's still in marching band! Now before you get all upset, you should know that I didn't cave until I'd gotten pretty much everything I wanted. I can miss half of each day of band camp, and all of the June rehearsals. Also, they really need me back. No they don't, I've heard you play.something. The cat was on the skateboard, but I was unable to launch it. FIN! Ouch! A ferret is beating me about the shins!

 Okay, so who wants to come see King Arthur with me? And do you want to see it on the 8th or the 9th? If it's on the 8th it will probably have to be in the evening, whereas on the 9th it can probably be in the afternoon. Here is a fanfic rec for you all-- The Not Quite Love Letters, a SW fic on fanfiction.net. It's about Han and Leia and their relationship after the Battle of Yavin revealed through a few angsty journal entries, but mostly through official Alliance communications and random things like that. In the first chapter Han invites Leia to polish his medal. In the second chapter, computer terminals get thrown onto people's heads. It's really funny. Ouch! A ferret is beating me about the shins!

 Ladies and gentlemen, urlLink the finished boat. I'm sorry Mario, your princess is in another Chinese restaurant!

 Ok, so my sister's party wasn't dreadfully annoying, but it was pretty boring until most of her friends left. They tried to brake a piniata with a broken ruler. It wasn't even funny, it was just pitiful. I gave them half a pool cue to smite the paper mache pig. Later on, I played cards with the last of the guests, people I actually knew from middleschool. One of them turned out to be obscurely related to us. We've got another half cousin now. It's Garage Sale Day! I've been looking for a TV, but everything is either too small, or doesn't have the right connection thingies for my ps2. And the cost of some, geez. Some people don't understand the purpose of a garage sale. The point is to get rid of stuff, not to make a whole lot of money. It's pocket change, most likely going to be spent on the equally cheap merchandise of others. Some people got the idea, though, like the person from whom I bought a sega genesis. one dollar. It was fate. There was the machine, and there was a dollar in my pocket. Now I just have to find some games, another controller, and the wires I need to plug it in. I'm sorry Mario, your princess is in another Chinese restaurant!

 Thanks to everybody who told me it was ok. It makes me feel warm and fuzzy that you actually took time to say it. :) Plus, it turns out you were right. I apparently, I just have a slightly large, but fully functioning and cyst-free thyroid. So yay! Also, I don't have TB. It's all good news here. Sophia, you've made me sad. Come on, my life is pretty boring too, I just talk about it anyway. I mean, let's look at this objectively: my last post was about Discworld books and my thyroid. Please. Anyway, my dad says that if our DSL isn't up very soon we're getting cable internet, just to spite the dsl people. But that would be super inconvenient really, because in order to afford it we'd have to get rid of AOL, and I've already filled out all my college stuff with my AOL account, and we'd have to download AIM and everything. That's bad. I'm sorry Mario, your princess is in another Chinese restaurant!

 There should be a JournalCon of some kind this weekend, starting sometime before 6 on friday. Mostly so I can get out of a house full of middleschool girls. Yes, it's my sisters birthday party, and it's planning on being loud and annoying. Some one with a big house, save me! We could make it Sophia's going away JournalCon, despite the fact that she'll still come to other journalcons. Or maybe it could be a Sophia's not really leaving JournalCon. C'mon, sometimes you have something to say. Thomas doesn't post frequently, and niether do I anymore. Just post when something interesting happens to you, or when you happen to something interesting. Once you're gone, you'll have something you wanted to post. Please stay with us? I'm sorry Mario, your princess is in another Chinese restaurant!

 Hey all. Look, I'm really sorry about this, but I don't think I'm gonna be a blogger anymore. I'm not about to lie and tell you that I don't have enough time because, hello, it's summer, but I just don't have anything to say. You shouldn't miss me too much seeing as I don't say anything anyway. I'd still love to journalcon with you guys though (yes, now it's a verb). It's not you, it's me. ;) I'm sorry Mario, your princess is in another Chinese restaurant!

 So I quit marching band. Definitely, for sure, I am not participating in this, the 2004 season of the LNHS season. Absolutely for certian. Except that I might not. See, my reason for quitting was of course Jekyll and Hyde, but Mr. Noffke doesn't want me to take two consecutive weeks off (Triennium and Newspaper camp) and I can't quit those, since my parents have already put down about $300 for each. If I'm out of Jekyll and Hyde for that, I might as well do Marching Band. EDIT: Noffke's gonna let me get do it, so I guess I am quitting. But if I miss one day, I'm out. Also, Nathan and I started building a boat today. It also started flooding. Amazingly enough, these two things are not related. Inspired by an episode of Biography on A&E last night, Nathan and I have officially made our college plans. We're going to NYU to study acting, just like the Olsen twins. In fact, they'll still be there, so we're planning to either marry them or collaborate on an award-winning sitcom, or both. With the acting genius of Nathan and I and the star power of MK & Ashley, we'll be rich. It's fool-proof. (My title is the prospective title of the show or an associated autobiography). Also, that's the new "We should get married... to other people." Now it's "We should get married... to the Olsen twins." In conclusion, the boredom of the summer is almost certianly getting to us. I'm sorry Mario, your princess is in another Chinese restaurant!

 Yesterday I purchased The Wee Free Men. I am now reading it. And when I'm done that will leave only The Last Hero that I haven't read, not counting A Hat Full of Sky, which I don't think is out this side of the pond yet. And, just as a heads up, the next DW book will be called Going Postal and it's coming out in October or November. It's about the postal system and golems. That's all I've been able to get. I think it's another misc. with cameos, like Monstrous Regiment was. I have now listened to the Two Towers tapes, and if you want a few highlights, check out my journal. If you don't have its address, just let me know and I'll email it to you, since I don't think blogger will let me put the link up here. Yesterday I went to the doctor to get vaccinated so that I can go to college. So I got a meningitis vaccine and a TB test. Yay. Then it turns out I have an enlarged thyroid gland, and I don't really know what that means, but they had to draw blood to test. I've never had that done before; it was kinda creepy. Then I have to go in again tomorrow so they can ultrasound my neck, I guess, and try to figure out why my thyroid is enlarged. I'm a little worried about it, I can tell you... Well, anyway. Just thought I'd put that out there so everybody can say, "Don't be worried, Erin, it's okay." Later. I'm sorry Mario, your princess is in another Chinese restaurant!

 Someone should make a fun BMV. Something like Dr. Jones's Orthodontist's office. Put an arcade in there, a really good snack bar (or at least some vending machines), Public internet terminals and a play area for the kids. Imagine the difference if instead of "Now I have to go back to the BMV..." It was "Now we get to go back to the BMV!! I'm so excited!" Seriously is there some goverment rule that says BMV's have to be drab and dreary? Everyone hates going there so much and it's something that wouldn't be hard to do. In case you haven't figured it out, I got my permit today. In fact that's all I did, since it took me, all in all, about six hours. Yeah. After that we drove around the parking lot, where I concluded that driving is not nearly as easy as it looks. And on the way home we listened to a tribute to Ray Charles, including his unique version of the song "Imagine": "Imagine all the people (All the little people) Living... Living there whole lives.. just for today..." What a guy. Well that's all I have to say. Oh, also Micheal, could you link me to your West Wing script site cause I'm lazy? Thanks. I'm sorry Mario, your princess is in another Chinese restaurant!

 I'm fufilling my constitutional duties as Communications Director by stating (even though y'all probably got the e-mail, that there is no Youth Group this week, apparently we're doing "Special Events" throughout the summer, at least half of which I won't be able to attend. Thanks a lot, Patty. Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in! "Haec credam a Patty pio? A Patty iusto? A Patty scito? Cruciatus in crucem! Tuus in terra servus nuntius fui officium perfeci. Cruciatus in crucem. Eas in crucem!" Okay, now that I'm done irrationally railing at Patty, I'm on to other matters. The other matters are...They're...I think one of them was...Okay, I completely forgot the other matters. I changed the template. This is not a novel to be tossed aside lightly. It should be thrown with great force.

 Erin, in case you read this before four o'clock tomorrow, we're having LotRCon and we'd like you to come! Also I found the best forum thread at fametracker Is that a rocket you've got hidden there? No, it's my cookie. urlLink Oh, Snap! Disses and Insults in Publishing

 I went shopping yesterday. It's something I don't often do, but my mom decided we need new clothes. I guess I do, I've only got one pair of shorts. So now we're $300 dollars in the hole, but I have 2 new pairs of shorts and Lounge Pants! I was stuck between two pairs, one covered with smileys and a pair of mario-print pants. The extreme yellow and the power of smileys was tough to pass up, but the sheer novelty of Mario won me over. I get my license now! Is that a rocket you've got hidden there? No, it's my cookie.

 Okay, I'm reformatting the template, because it's über-annoying in its current format. Okay, I haven't posted since Saturday and I think it's time to throw my two cents in on Gym. I hate it. It is awful. If I had to pick between Gym Class or death, I would probably pick death, because unlike Gym, Death is quiet, peaceful and probably doesn't smell like a great big armpit. There are several things I hate about Gym, and four of them are teachers. There are six teachers teaching Gym Class. It takes them the better part of an hour to take attendence. When we transition from one place to another almost none of the students know what's going on because none of the teachers know what's going on and that is because there are six of them. There's Mr. Holman, Mrs. Annee, Mrs. Fuson, and three LN teachers I don't know. One of them looks like Mr. Harvey with dark hair and a buzzcut, the others look old. And the teachers don't like each other. One of the old LN teachers told me to take my Tardy Pass to "Mrs. Hag" née Mrs. Fuson. Mr. Holman refered to her as the Gestapo. And both of them were right, because Fuson is what you would get if Aileen Wuornos and Joan Collins had a baby together. She's bitchy, she's ill-tempered, she's always yelling about something and I'm pretty sure she was hungover this morning. We did swim testing yesterday, and we swam about eight different times because the teachers were incompetant. Then we went and ran on the track and played optional Basketball. So I dribbled for about ten minutes and sat on the bleachers until we got dressed. I've just been wearing my gym clothes to school because of three things: number one, I always have it with me, Number two, I'm not getting dressed up for these people and number three, I'm inevitably going to get sweaty and I will pick the shower in my house over the shower at school everytime, so I'm not going to get new clothes all icky and sweaty. Of course, everyday people have asked me questions like "Why are you wearing your gym suit? We just changed." From now on, I'm answering "None of your damn business." Just because I can. One kid who is one of those kids who thinks he's cool, but is just a ass, made a snide comment, which I just ignored because he's ugly, fat, gay and a general asshole. To sum it up: Gym = Bad. Okay, on to lighter subjects, I'm having "LotRCon II: Forth Eorlingas!" at my house on Friday at 4:30. So far I have Jonah, Nathan and Claire coming. More are welcome. RSVP in the comments section.

 For those of you not privy to the conversation, I have officially decided to name my daughter, should i ever have one, Starfish. It's a great name, with many cool nicknames - Star, Starry, Fish, Fishy, Starfy, Arfish. She will probably not sport a cornfrohawk, but you just never know. Which brings me to other news: I am getting a haircut today. I am going to pay some person money to cut off my hair. Barbering is one of the few industries where we pay people to take things away. Also banking, but the difference is that there is an understanding that the bank will give you your money back someday, whereas the barbershop would never in a million years return your hair. Another such business is daycare, but this is also temporary, and usually much shorter term than the bank. So, in conclusion - You pay daycare to take your kids for a day, The bank to take your money for some years, and the barbershop to take your hair FOREVER. Luckily hair grows back, and is an infinitely renewable resource, unless you are Homer Simpson or Captian Picard. Has everybody heard of the Wikipedia? The ultimate experiment in anarchy - anyone can update a page with new info. You could. I could. Gary Coleman could. Gary Coleman is, by the way, in a new musical called Avenue Q which just won a lot of Tonys. It's about homosexuality and rascism and muppets, and Gary Coleman is played by a woman. Anyway, if I ever had a topic to get off it I lost it a long time ago. Is that a rocket you've got hidden there? No, it's my cookie.

 I'm smart! Or, at least, smarter than I thought I was. Report cards came today. I got straight A's for term six, and only two B's and one C cumulatively. Because of the weight, I actually had a 4.048 for term six, which really helped drag my cumulative GPA out of the gutter(Yes, I consider a 3.3 to be the gutter. I can do better). It will make my parents very happy, which should in turn make me very happy. It's nice to be back on track. Is that a rocket you've got hidden there? No, it's my cookie.

 The Happy Fun Hanover Weekend went over basically without a hitch. Sometimes, though, when I'm with my grandparents and my Aunt Barbara and my mom, I really wish I had a tape recorder. Some of this stuff, you just can't make it up. I could have sworn we were going to get arrested for breaking and entering. I saw "Troy" yesterday. It's an interesting movie. Brad Pitt was very pretty. Orlando Bloom was funny as Paris because he was such a big wimp. And he did a lot of Legolas bow-and-arrow stuff and a lot of Will Turner sword stuff. I loved Hector and I was sad when he died. We cheered three times. The first was for the King Arthur trailer, which was awesome. The second time was when Rose Byrne (Dormé from AOTC), who played Briseis, stabbed Agamemnon in the neck. It must have been the handmaiden training. The third was when Aeneas got a little cameo. But they did so many things wrong in that movie. For example, the Trojan War was supposed to be nine years long, and in the movie it was about 16 days. And that's counting the twelve-day timeout for Hector's funeral. There's lots more, but my friend Alicia is writing a review of it,a and I get to comment upon it, so I will probably be more coherent after that. I now own three more Discworld books! I have Small Gods, Hogfather, and The Fifth Elephant. The only books in the main series that I don't have now are Reaper Man and Thief of Time. I'm most excited about having Fifth Elephant because that was the second DW book I read and I can't remember what happens. I looked through all the Carrot and Angua parts last night, and they are really so touching when you know Carrot and Angua. He goes after her. He almost says he loves her. He holds her hand. He promises to kill her if he ever needs to. She cries. She gets called a dog. She fights her family. She says, "Carrot's mine." I love that couple. They're so screwed up. Is that a rocket you've got hidden there? No, it's my cookie.

 Okay, first things first, JournalCon was both great and a disaster as Jonah fell asleep like a Jonah. Thomas and I stayed up and debated policy initatives and Old-School Nickolodeon Shows until one. Building a playground was fun even with the presence of butt-guy. Levi's open house was entertaining, I compared Levi to a "drunk woman who shakes her breasts." Somehow Kafkaesque got in there. Levi and Colin did the duo and it was good. Leeches are funny. However, I was greatly entertained by a picture of a certain blog founder in third grade. I'm working with the Comstocks to get that picture online. I wanted to see other yearbooks, but all that Jonah found was the Everyman edition of The Canterbury Tales, there was a bare-chested woman on the cover. Needless to say, I coined the term "The Canter-booby Tales." So, yeah... And then I asked again to see a yearbook and Jonah presented me "The Case Against Spanking". Very Entertaining Day. More Later. I love you, so much. Your Daughter, Claudia. Is that a rocket you've got hidden there? No, it's my cookie.

 I discovered my old love of swinging again last night! When we build that playground on Saturday, The Patty better let us play on it at youth group. Because playgrounds are awesome. This is my new feature. I'm calling it... "A Proportional Response" Erin: Dorm room stuff? urlLink IKEA ! Nathan: Does the word "Homonym" mean anything to you?

 It's weird. I figured when summer came, I'd have a lot of time to post. And I due. Trouble is, now I've got nothing to post about. (I know "about which to post" would be right but it sounds kinda akward, doesn't it?) Bottom line: Stuff stops happening, I stop having stuff to say. Last night I wrote a parody that almost no one will get. You have to be a fan of both REO Speedwagon and Pokemon. If any of you want to hear it, I'll post it. I think I don't know I think I know I dont think I know I think I dont think I know I think....

 Hurray! Everything's cool now! I'm sure I had something to post, but I can't remember what it was anymore. Oh, yes. I graduated. Thanks to those of you who could come to my house. I am now faced with the depressing reality that I have a buttload of money and I'm going to have to spend most of it on dorm room stuff. Oh, well. The other night I went bowling with Toni and Huevos. After I found the picture of Obi-Wan Kenobi in my purse (don't ask why, just accept) we decided to use the Force and bowl with our eyes closed. Toni and I were much better at it than Huevos, but that was probably just because he decided to use the dark side. Toni and I put on padawan braids and we changed our names on the score screen to slightly SW-ish things. I love being a big huge dork.

 Why are you wearing tights? Thomas, it was for conversational purposes. They hadn't actually seen you before, so I get to exagerate. ha, pack-mule If I can come I have to find some random or obscure soda, or maybe I'll get a bunch of Jones's if funds are sufficient. I think I don't know I think I know I dont think I know I think I dont think I know I think....

 I declare this second blog war over, and the people rejoice! Let there never be such dark times again. In other news, Marten called me a sexy beast...What's all that about? -I think I don't know I think I know I dont think I know I think I dont think I know I think....

 Marten, I'm sorry I said that. It was wrong and mean, and I absolutely want to blog with you again. Once Again, I'm sorry. Okay, resume general blogging Random Thoughts * While the new description is funny, it isn't true as at this very moment, I am wearing tights. * Everyone coming on Friday needs to bring sodas to share with everyone. * People should start referring to the police as "the fuzz" again I think I don't know I think I know I dont think I know I think I dont think I know I think....

 Marten, you've got admin power back. If you want to use it to quit again, so be it. I'd rather we all just forget this nonsense and get back to blogging. Erin has been the most sensible so far. These issues are between Michael and Marten, and I would prefer they find another way to fight it out without screwing up the blog for the rest of us. BTW, who wrote the new description? I like it. Anyway, it occurred to me that a bunch of blog-worthy stuff has happened to me lately that I haven't written because of the nonsense. For instance, all the tornados on Sunday. We were in the basement for around two hours ,[Ha! I was in a leaky fallout shelter for about half an hour. It would be nifty if I wasn't pissed about still being there-Marten] and they came right over us. Luckily none of them touched down, but we were pretty worried. It got to the point where we were stashing our valuables in the basement. Then on Monday, following a note from my grandma's mother, we found her grandfather's grave. For those of you not keeping track, that's my grandma's great grandfather or my great great great grandfather, Jacob Tanner Snyder, who fought in the civil war. Not thrity feet from his grave is that of Richard Gattling, inventor of the first automatic weapon - the gattling gun. And less than a mile away is our shortest running president, William Henry Harrison. So that was pretty cool. It's not every day you track down a 150 year old relative. I think I don't know I think I know I dont think I know I think I dont think I know I think....

 You guys, this has gotten fucking ridiculous. And that's my official stand. I think I don't know I think I know I dont think I know I think I dont think I know I think....

 Okay, I left the first time because I was having a bad day, and didn't particularly like the way the blog was working. I was convinced that people wanted me back. So I accept the invite from michael, and he accuses me of folding. Thats exactly why I hadn't already come back! If I leave and come back, you're just going to make annoying comments about it. Cuz thats what you do. You're the Michael Christie of making annoying comments. So I always have to watch what I write so I don't write anything you can make an annoying assnark comment on. Well, I'm sick of it michael. I'm tired of standing up for someone who kicks me in the back of the knees so I fall back down. I think I don't know I think I know I dont think I know I think I dont think I know I think....

 Damnit, would someone just kick me off? This isn't going to work. I think I don't know I think I know I dont think I know I think I dont think I know I think....

 Okay, I've had it. For 45 minutes I was fired from this blog by Marten because he is being petty, immature and a general ass. His new description was this: "This is for Michael: Continuing to be an ass isn't going to help you any. My patience runs thin and I'm running on hypocracy. Therefore, I can be an ass, and you cannot. Do not push me." Marten, I'm not speaking to you anymore. Just because you think you are "Marten the Great" or the "Pirate King" doesn't mean that you are. Also the fact is you left. You're no longer the "leader". You can't claim that title because you left . I'm dropping it as of now, so if BlogWar II: Electric Boogaloo drags on any longer, ladies and gentlemen of the blog, I believe that you will know who is responsible.

 Here's how it works. I'm not being a jerk here, just trying to sort things out. Marten and Michael are both flagrantly abusing their admin powers because they're mad at each other, because this is childish and immature, I'm taking away said powers. Do I really have that power? No. So if any of you think I've judged in error and give the powers back, I will except that I was wrong and let it stand. If you guys agree with me, then leave their powers off. I'm not mad at you guys, but when we made the "Everybody's an admin" rule it was not so you could be petty and immature. And I don't care who started it. I think I don't know I think I know I dont think I know I think I dont think I know I think....

 I'm back, sorry for any confusion I caused. I was just having a bad day and acted rashly. Michael: If you chose to be an asshole, fine. I offer no further apology. Everyone else, I think it's good to be back, if it really was pointless, then I'll leave again. I think I don't know I think I know I don't think I know I think I don't think I know I think....

 Is Tyler here yet? Why not? I have barracaded myself in my house and refuse to go out because the cicadas are so bad. I hate everything about them.

MysteriousBob87: sure they are MysteriousBob87: ompompomp SBristowSD6: And if there was one more person here, I'd fire you. LuckEdc: Nothing good happened except that boy didn't die, and that other boy didn't die, and Abby passed her boards. MysteriousBob87: they should have all died MysteriousBob87: great for a finale SBristowSD6: Chen and Pratt were shot! SBristowSD6: That's good! LuckEdc: Possibly LuckEdc: I'm very disappointed in Neela, unless Parminder Nagra's trying to find a decent job, in which case good for her.

 a "fringe" environmentalist." Hey! Guess what! What should have been a rapid descent into hell wasn't! National Parks have got their stuff together and have phones and some have free internet access and they're awesome! Right now I am in Zion. It's actually 2:44 PM, because of Mountain time, but even though I don't like nature or heat or bugs, I am actually enjoying Utah. Beaver Creek already kicked ass and took names and I have exactly two minutes left so I'm wrapping this up. I may get on tomorrow, I may not. I barely got on today, because a lady who must have been the Brazilian equivalent of Ann Landers took forever checking her e-mail. And I'm spent... Haha, tricked you, I'm a hippie.

 So I'm back, at long last. It's been two weeks like you wouldn't believe. I met a girl named Blithe and one named Virdi, for those of you into weird girl names. Also a guy named Jonars. In the past week I've been working on Rat, the magazine for mall rats. 20 pages, three people, one week. I have it as a pdf, and if anyone knows how I could upload it to the internet, that would be awesome, because then you could all see it. Triennium, as Nathan said, was phenomenally awesome. Words cannot describe. There was a Wizard of Oz event that was like a Journalcon on crack. Not only did we quote and snark, but there were Rocky Horror Picture Show-esque interactivities. Thomas, Nathan, and I, as flying monkeys, waited until the witch said "Fly, Fly, Fly!" then ran around the audience in masks, fezes, and wings screaming, whooping and jumping. It was crazy fun. A girl in my small group broke my slinky, so we cut off the broken part. The girl (Maria) turned it into a bracelet, so now I have a half-slinky, and I can tell people truthfully that the rest of my slinky is on some girl's wrist in California. If that's not awesome, I don't know what is. Anyway, that's all I have to say, also that I'm gonna update Corndog really soon.

 Standing Stone was okay, but Triennium would have been better. I keep forgetting I'm the weird one. Mostly walking to and from the dam, to and from the rec hall, and playing cards, or video games when my cousins ditched me from time to time. It wasn't in a mean way, they just never made an effort to find me before they went and did stuff, and when I found them later in the day, they're all "Where've you been?" In my freaking cabin, if you cared to look. sheesh. oh well. Some are coming to Jekyll and Hyde. Haha, tricked you, I'm a hippie.

 I am back from Triennium.&nbsp; I have no idea what to say about it in this post.&nbsp; Thomas, Jonah and I formed a Harmonica, Didjeridoo (sp?), Water Bottle praise band called Slippery When Wet.&nbsp; ummm.... Boycott Taco Bell.&nbsp; Pittsburgh with an H, or Pittsburg without an H?&nbsp; Say 'Bagel'.&nbsp; Fly, Fly, FLY!!!!!! TWENTY THREE GUITAR SOLOS!&nbsp; The Band.&nbsp; Sumo Wrestling.&nbsp; Global Partner Kickline.&nbsp; Jesse of the pink hair.&nbsp; Blithe, Darby, and Jazzimine.&nbsp; Starship Tiderious!&nbsp; Carry your Sandal.... Ok that made no sense to anyone but Thomas and Jonah, but I can't begin to describe everything that happened.&nbsp; Suffice it to say it was really weird, but really fun.&nbsp; Except maybe for the guitar solos. Behold, verily, there is the woman of the scarlett letter, and, of a truth, moreover, there is the likeness of the scarlett letter running by her side! Come, therefore, and let us fling mud at them!

 Hello! I didn't think I'd be posting, but I am! Because the Residence Inn is Awesome, and I love it even though the location sucks. Denver has been fun. It sounds lame, but that's exactly what it has been. Fun. I'm running out of computer time, so full details will be posted later, possibly in Zion. Bye! See y'all in August! Behold, verily, there is the woman of the scarlett letter, and, of a truth, moreover, there is the likeness of the scarlett letter running by her side! Come, therefore, and let us fling mud at them!

 Hey, guys! I wish you weren't all gone. I'm sad and lonely. Guess what? Comstocks, if you're being INSANELY spoiler-free, turn away. The&nbsp;official title of Episode III is Revenge of the Sith. Just as&nbsp;anybody could have guessed in 1983. Except us, I guess,&nbsp;'cause we weren't born. But although it's an obvious choice, it's obvious because it's good. Certainly better than a title like "Attack of the Clones." So the sequence of movies (in movietime chronology): The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, Revenge of the Sith, A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi. Hee. Little things like this give me such pleasure. Marten and I have communication difficulties in talking about the movies, because he insists on referring to realtime chronology, and I keep referring to movietime. So I'll say Luke looks like Anakin in that shot, and he says no, Anakin looks like Luke. It's frustrating. Almost like the werewolf thing. Behold, verily, there is the woman of the scarlett letter, and, of a truth, moreover, there is the likeness of the scarlett letter running by her side! Come, therefore, and let us fling mud at them!

 Well, the TiVo is set, the mail is stopped, the dog is in the kennel and the Christies are going on vacation once again. This time, we’re setting off for the west, metaphorically wagon-train-ing to Las Vegas with about a million stops along the way. It’ll be just like the pioneers, except with motels and a car with XM Satellite Radio and DVD Entertainment System. Our stops will be made in Denver, Beaver Creek/Vail, Grand Junction, Moab (Arches National Park), Bryce Canyon National Park, Zion National Park, The Grand Canyon (North Rim) and finally ending our trip at the fabulous Paris Las Vegas Resort & Casino. It actually looks to be a great trip, even with the cumulative week spent in National Park Lodging. Because EW! I might be Audioblogging a bit from these locations, which will be fun because I’ve wanted to try that out for a while now and now I have an excuse. After my return, I plan to post a short day-by-day recaplet piece at What Kind of Day Has It Been, which I will then continue to blog on a weekly basis. Cheerio! Behold, verily, there is the woman of the scarlett letter, and, of a truth, moreover, there is the likeness of the scarlett letter running by her side! Come, therefore, and let us fling mud at them!

 I HATE OLD PEOPLE! Our neighbors are out of town and we have been given permission to use their pool. That's cool, no? Well it would be except the neighbor also gave permission to her mother to have a widow support church group thing. They were supposed to be gone by 7. They also brought a niece (I neded to mention that sometime) They just WON'T LEAVE! They're "waiting for the niece's mom to come." And she's late and she's really pissing me off. I wanted a nice swim today. Instead I got a bunch of old people swimming in the pool that is rightfully ours, since they had it until 7 and it is presently 8:18. I hate old people. Behold, verily, there is the woman of the scarlet letter, and, of a truth, moreover, there is the likeness of the scarlet letter running by her side! Come, therefore, and let us fling mud at them!

 You have no idea how weird I'm feeling right now.&nbsp; It's 6:30 in the evening and dinner is on the table, but to me it feels like morning, because I just got up, having gone to bed&nbsp;3 hours previously.&nbsp; I don't take naps; this is why.&nbsp; My sleep schedule is gonna be off for a week.&nbsp; Anyway, they want me down at the dinner table, but to me it's breakfast, and it's way to early for me to be able to handle it. Ok, I've had a shower I'm a little better now.&nbsp; We just saw Seussical! and one of the characters was so Thomas it was funny.&nbsp; Thomas, you are now Horton the Elephant. Then we&nbsp;played DnD until until the wee hours of the night.&nbsp; I was a drunken mad dwarf.&nbsp; It was fun. Then I got carwashed.&nbsp; ANd cars got washed by me, and so did the dog only not really.&nbsp; Ok, more sleep now.&nbsp; Adios! Behold, verily, there is the woman of the scarlett letter, and, of a truth, moreover, there is the likeness of the scarlett letter running by her side! Come, therefore, and let us fling mud at them!

 Right now I am at Paul's house, where we are midway thorough a Super Smash Brothers battle royale. Carl is sitting next to me playing MoH: Rising Sun multiplayer by himself. I'm Michael Christie, and this is the longest birthday party of my life. I'm posting about my really really awesome great day. Because the Christie family has traded in their beaten old sport utility vehicle for...a brand new version of the same vehicle. But it has bucket seats in the back, XM satellite radio and DVD Entertainment for the back seat. I love the car, it is almost as good as an Armada. I'd write an ode to the Tahoe Z71, but this is the slowest internet connection ever, so I can't just run over to RhymeZone.com to find a thing. Also today was the last day of summer gym, in which I got a B, because I cannot serve a volleyball, shoot a free throw, shoot a layup, run either a mile, 100 meters, 400 meters or two consecutive laps without vomiting all over the track. In fact the warmup almost killed me. I have nothing to say about finishing gym other than: Freedom is mine ! And I know how I feel ... It's a new dawn . It's a new day . It's a new life ...for me. And I'm feeling good . Behold, verily, there is the woman of the scarlett letter, and, of a truth, moreover, there is the likeness of the scarlett letter running by her side! Come, therefore, and let us fling mud at them!

 Eh, that's as good a title as any! Did you hear the Canadian slipping in there?&nbsp; That's courtesy of my awesome cousins and aunt, who are here at my house for a while.&nbsp; We have been out doing things and stuff for a while now.&nbsp; We hit the Children's Museum (the DINOSAUR exhibit is very cool) RAWR!, the bowling alley (bowled a 77 ), the arcade for some D D R , and of course, K-mart.&nbsp; In case you haven't noticed, I'm A B U S I N G C O L O U R!!!!! (note the U, very Canadian).&nbsp; The reason for this is that I am VERY TIRED!!!!! For instance, I can't tell my rights from writes. Or wrongs or lefts or something.&nbsp; Anyway, this knew (I mean new) template line is a great one from scarlet Letter. So Evelyn (wings) is right next to me now, and she wants this to be known, despite the fact that that means all her potential internet stalkers will know EXACTLY WHERE SHE IS.&nbsp; Anyway, I'm gonna let her type for a short spell. I have no idea what to right, so I'll (oops, I'm doing it too.&nbsp; Too much cousin bonding time methinks) just tell you all to go read my blog which I'll be updating more frequently since my mom knows about it now and I won't have to hide from her when I post.&nbsp; I'm planning a "Surviving the Comstocks: Into the heart of Indianapolis's Insane community" for my upcoming blogs, so stay tuned. Anyway, I don't have so much more to say right now, so I'm gonna rap up this entry. Darn, well to save face, I'll actually rap up this entry. (Beatboxing) The entry is over I typed the last word So stop reading now Or I'll flip you the bird Word.&nbsp; (Addendum: How the heck does the Blogger spell check not know the word&nbsp;"blog"????? I mean, seriously!)&nbsp; &nbsp; Behold, verily, there is the woman of the scarlet letter, and, of a truth, moreover, there is the likeness of the scarlet letter running by her side! Come, therefore, and let us fling mud at them!

 Thanks a lot, Erin. Not only have you bailed on me (for the second time), you did it after I went to fucking Glendale to see King Arthur. A pox upon you! Behold, verily, there is the woman of the scarlett letter, and, of a truth, moreover, there is the likeness of the scarlett letter running by her side! Come, therefore, and let us fling mud at them!

 Guess what?! Guess! Are you done guessing? Okay, I'll tell you now. Yesterday I posted my Velma Kelly story-- Marten's read it but I don't think any of the rest of you have yet-- on fanfiction.net and it's been REVIEWED TWICE ALREADY! And the reviews are good! Really good! I'm so happy and excited about it! If any of you are interested, it's called "Closing Night" and it's a "Chicago" fic, which is under movies. Also, I know the name of my roommate for next year. Her name is Katy Holmes. I haven't contacted her yet, because I'm not sure what to say. I need to think about it a bit. But it's weird, because for some reason I had this odd premonition that her name would be Katy. Spelled like that and everything. Hmm. I am made of POISON!

 My cousins are here. It's fun, even if they are a little normal sometimes. They make up for it by being from Canada, where Carwashes are apparently illegal. I swear if we could harness the endless energy of ten year olds we wouldn't need cold fusion. But I'll survive. In other news, we had a Jekyll and Hyde blocking rehearsal today. I'm a pickpocket and I GET PROSTITUTES! I know I'm a little too excited about it, but you have to remember I was the girl last time. It's nice to have hot ones hanging on me. (Don't worry, Ash, you're still my #1 girl) Also, Rachel, you might be interested to know that Brad just got upgraded from 2 or 3 lines to one of the three largest parts in the show. I am made of POISON!

 I'm back, too. I'm tired. I'm glad Thomas isn't dead. We thought he might be, and "golf" was just his parents in denial. Michigan was fun, I think we should do three days instead of two more often. It feels considerably longer, though. It was the first time in a while that we had to set up in the dark. On saturday I spent the day with a drama troupe, met some interesting people. It was kinda spooky, how similar they were to our group. They even had the same idea of combining bagels and muffins, as well as a few other inside jokes at least half of you guys know about. If we can ever get clothes for you guys, I think it would be fun to start a drama group. It would be part of my plan to revive vaudeville! We could sing and do tricks as well as act, it would be great. I am made of POISON!

 Thanks to everybody who came out for me to see King Arthur. For my official review of it, you can go to my LJ. Really, I was just looking for an excuse to use that line as a post title. I wish I could think of something else to say. I really can't. Go and tell the children of the night to make beautiful music somewhere else, will you? I have a headache.

 I would just like to establish that I am back. Also, I got my drivers license as well! Possibly on the same day as Marten. More details of my vacation shall be posted at a later time. Go and tell the children of the night to make beautiful music somewhere else, will you? I have a headache.

 Yo! Everybody who wants to come to see King Arthur: Tomorrow (Friday), 4:10, Glendale. That is all. Go and tell the children of the night to make beautiful music somewhere else, will you? I have a headache.

 Have you ever lied for absolutely no reason? I mean, I was talking to someone today, and I just... lied. Totally inexplicably. I didn't even think about it at all. A total fabrication just escaped my lips. It couldn't in any concievable way have helped me, but it could hurt me in many ways. Immediately afterwards, I regretted it, but then there was nothing I could do, and nw I feel all guilty. But what do I do now? Just say, 'sorry, that wasn't really true?' I mean I can't apologize if I didn't have any reason. And why did I do it? Was it something subconscious? Whatever it was, it's freaking me out majorly. Go and tell the children of the night to make beautiful music somewhere else, will you? I have a headache.

 I've got my driver's license! I'm a licensed driver! Now all I need is a job to pay for insurance and 3 months so I can drive with passengers and I'm set! This spaghetti would taste a lot better with grated cheese. hey, I was being literal there, but that would be a good template! or maybe not... I'm done! Go and tell the children of the night to make beautiful music somewhere else, will you? I have a headache.

 Okay, I know, the site is black now. I did it, okay, I am Spartacus. (The Haikus are mine, though - Jonah) It's the same thing as before except black. For those of you reading the site feed. It's really quite lovely, you should check it out. Okay, I know no one is reading the site feed. Okay, this is diluting my message. Not that I actually had one. I just kind of...lost it. I'll find it in a while. Go and tell the children of the night to make beautiful music somewhere else, will you? I have a headache.

 So it's 10 am and I just woke up so I'm all like "I'm gonna post on the blog, except that I have nothing really to say but I'll make up for it with my wit and charm or something" Well, I do have a few things. For instance, everyone should know about urlLink "Rock, Paper, Saddam" Also, I would encourage you to all go see Fahrenheit 911. It's a good movie. I went to a party last night. The most interesting thing was probably the attempt to cut a watermelon with a bread knife. We ended up cutting a weird, jagged elipse around the melon, and then scooping out the insides with an ice-cream scoop and eating it with spoons. Also, if you haven't seen urlLink tailsteak.tk before, the Tournament of Things is just starting. To conclude, for Evelyn, I'm starting a Canadian COuntdown: 3 1/4 Days! Go and tell the children of the night to make beautiful music somewhere else, will you? I have a headache.

 There. I'm home now. Florida was all right, although I was sick part of the time, which sucked. I don't really want to talk about that. I did get to so some cool stuff at Universal, and swim in the Gulf, and we stopped and saw this really awesome Titanic exhibit. If anyone's ever passing though the Orlando area, I encourage them to go find it. It's called Ship of Dreams, and you get to go inside reproductions of some of the rooms on board, and then you stand outside on the deck, and it's really cold... Their attention to detail is amazing. It was a really moving thing to go through, especially for me, as I was a pretty huge Titanic buff for a while there until I'd learned pretty much everything. After we left I played the soundtrack to Titanic the Musical in the car. That's a good musical. You know. "No moon, no wind/ Nothing to spy things by/ No wave, no swell/ No line where sea meets sky/ Stillness, darkness/ Can't see a thing, says I/ No reflection, not a shadow/ Not a glint of light meets the eye/ And we go sailing, sailing/ Ever westward on the sea/ We go sailing, sailing/ Ever on go we..." This is material perhaps better suited to my lj. I'll talk about it there later. Marten, sorry I wasn't here for your birthday. Happy birthday! (throws confetti) Go and tell the children of the night to make beautiful music somewhere else, will you? I have a headache.

 Well, Claire decided that I was beneath her and not worth her considerable time and pre-emptively attacked our plan of potentially dating. I guess it was because Jonah just made a much more comfortable body pillow. Actually, I really don't care, because Claire is the flakiest most non-committal person I know, and I know a lot of flaky non-committal people. Okay, moving on to happier things: I! HAVE! TiVo! I'm so happy, I'm just TiVoing everything I can. I've got the British House of Commons on there tomorrow night. I've TiVoed The Daily Show for the last couple of days and it's been great to come home from summer school and watch Jon Stewart and some really funny people do the news. Okay, I am tired now. This template's gotta go. Ouch! A ferret is beating me about the shins!

 Today is infinite improbability day! When nothing goes as expected. It started this morning at the Wimbleton Womens finals when 13th seeded urlLink Maria Sharapova beat first seeded Serena Williams. (In related news, I'm dumping Janel Moloney. Maria's closer to my age anyway.) Also unusual, Nathan watching an two entire sporting events ( I also watched Roddick vs Ancic). Tennis is severely underated. After that I successfully made an egg that wasn't scrambled. A little while later we played hearts. Jonah and I each shot the moon, and I wasn't even trying to till I was nearly there. Jonah got incredibly lucky at all points in the game. After that we heard thnat the general assembly gay and lesbian ordination motion only failed by four votes, which is probably the most amazing thing. Then we went outside and got caught in a terrible freak rainstorm. Lots of weird stuff keeps happening. It'll be worse by the end of the day, mark my words Ouch! A ferret is beating me about the shins!

 Aye. That is all. There aren't Arabian ninjas, they just wear the same pants!

 Aw what the hell... Aye! Although commuting for JournalCons from Ottawa will be a bitch... My Schedule for the first semester: G1 - Physiology (Lamishaw) G2 - SRT (Sturm) G3 - Geometry (Bender) G4 - US History - AP (Hasty) M5 - Adv. Tech Theatre (Sturm) M6 - English 11 (Guthrie) M7 - Japanese III (Meguschar) M8 - Film Literature (Davis) There aren't Arabian ninjas, they just wear the same pants!

 My enter button still won't work here. If anyone can think of why this is, please tell me. I would like to call for a vote. All those who would like Evie to join the Compendium staff, please vote "aye." Thank you.

 Okay, I'm back. And I've got a plan. It's a good plan. It's a plan for JournalCons. (I'm going to say this and then be done until they actually happen, so don't freak out, Marten...) October - AngelsInAmericaCon January - WonderfallCon March - Monty Py-Con May - FamilyGuyCon Yes, you read that right. I'm devoting an entire con to the British Comedy stylings of Monty Python since neither Movie nor MusicalCons panned out. Enjoy! (Technically there already was a MusicalCon, I just wasn't there. I'm just sayin...) Also Marten, I so want to see the cornrow pictures. There aren't Arabian ninjas, they just wear the same pants!

 There aren't Arabian ninjas, they just wear the same pants!

 lol geesh, what kind of a band would this be? Their songs would be all haikus. Haha. I would laugh. Anyway, I am laughing. :D But....MY HAIR IS LONG(er)! I HAVE TEETH! I told you that, right? I got my braces off? I don't remember if I announced that to you or if that was after I "quit". Who knows, eh? Ooo! I'm going to start saying "no?" at the end of sentences. Sounds good, no? See? Doesn't that sound so foreign?! Okay, sorry, I'm a bit hyper and have a lack of places to express my hyperosity. Plus I'm putting off reading The Scarlet Letter. I hate that book. GRRRRR. :D There aren't Arabian ninjas, they just wear the same pants!

 Hey, guys, since none of you are ever online due to your various commitments, I'm going to ask you this question in the form of a survey, to which you may respond by emailing me. For those of you who have read Night Watch-- I just reread it, and I'm wondering: (two things now, actually, one of which is why this stupid thing won't let me press the "enter" button) Was Lady Roberta Messerole of Genua, aka "Madam", aka Vetinari's aunt, a seamstress (hem hem)? And exactly what part was she playing in the assassination of Lord Winder and his replacement with Lord Snapcase? And, subsequently, what was her role in Vetinari's ascension to the Patricianship? In short what sort of... business... did she have in Ankh-Morpork? If this goes well, I have other questions about things like Gavin from The Fifth Elephant and Lady Margolotta and Angua's family and Ysabell and Albert and Binky. That last sentence would have been a different paragraph if the enter button would work, but it won't.

 Yay! Sophia's back! We missed you. In other news, my hair is considerably shorter. It's cold, but pleasantly fuzzy, and doesn't really look that bad. Just incredibly different. Despite this, I look forward to having long hair again after the show. I'll have to put it in corn rows more often. Also, before shaving it all, I only had half a head of hair. I will have pictures of both alternative hairstyles. Okay, there was a lot more to this post, but blogger's being stupid and I lost most of it. There aren't Arabian ninjas, they just wear the same pants!

 ...who only thinks he is a person ~Penny Arcade Yay, Sophia's back! We missed you. In other news, I have considerably less hair than usual, and have recieved much congratulation on shaving quite a bit of my hair for a single scene. It doesn't look that bad, actually, and is pleasently soft and fuzzy, though a bit cold. Despite its advantages, it will be grown to its original length. I could get used to it being incredibly short, but two days before cutting it i had it in cornrows and it looked awesome! The day after that, only half was shaved. Nathan's idea, we had a few different explainations to toss out at anyone who asked, my favourite being that we were running late and could only shave half. We will have pictures, for anyone interested. Explanation on the new template: Nathan and I had an arguement about one of the prostitute costumes. I said she looked like a ninja prostitute and he insisted she was a pirate. The arguement was long and rather pointless. There aren't Arabian ninjas, they just wear the same pants!

 Wow. Thank you Nathan for that rousing rendition of "The Lion Sleeps Tonight". I don't think I'll ever be able to listen to that song the same way again. In other news, I'm alive! Kinda. I know I quit and then came back and didn't post and blah blah blah...sorry about all that. I've been working this summer! Actually WORKING! Did you think that was possible? And at school, no less. I've been working for the registrar and in the bookstore...fun stuff, eh? But I stopped doing that because I strained my back lifting books and stuff. Just think about that when you go to registration you LC folks...I hurt myself so that ya'll could get books. :D Just kidding. But it's gonna be funky this year...all the books are in the Studio Theater and you're going to get them at Registration. You LN people are lucky. But I got money for our stupidity, so it's all good. Anyway, I hope my posting isn't too weird for all of you...I'm just bored and don't really have much to do. Sorry. Bye! There aren't Arabian ninjas, they just wear the same pants!

 Upton Sinclair's The Jungle Lithuanians are mistreated tonight In the Jungle, Upton Sinclair's The Jungle Lithuanians are mistreated tonight A weiner wort a weiner wort a weiner wort a weiner wort a weiner wort a weiner wort a weiner wort a weiner wort a weeeeeeeee ooooowwweeeooweeooooweeeeeooowomaway In the Stockyards, the Chicago Stockyards, The proverbial Lion of the proletariat sleeps tonight One day, it will rise up and kill the capitalist class (Repaet refrain) So ends my tribute to Upton Sinclair's masterpiece. I seriously think it could work as a musical. The "weiner wort", of course, refers to what they put in the sausages. It's a great book, but it'll be weeks before I can eat another sausage. In other news, guess what one of our numbers for the fall choir show is gonna be? Hint: It was the title of an episode of Sports Night . There aren't Arabian ninjas, they just wear the same pants!
