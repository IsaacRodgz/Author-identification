 urlLink La calidad del cuidado infantil: Un resumen para padres This ERIC Digest is in Spanish. It is a translation of Child Care Quality: An Overview for Parents. From the ERIC Digest: El porcentaje de madres empleadas que utilizan centros de cuidado infantil para sus hijos preescolares aumento del 13% al 29%, de 1977 a 1994, segun lo indica el U.S. Bureau of the Census (1998--Oficina del Censo de EE.UU.). El uso creciente del cuidado infantil ha ido acompanado de preguntas acerca de como el desarrollo de los ninos se ve afectado por la calidad de los servicios del cuidado infantil disponible. Es dificil definir el cuidado infantil de buena calidad; no obstante, se concuerda que el desarrollo infantil debe mejorarse en vez de verse arriesgado debido a experiencias de cuidado fuera del hogar. Este Digest discute la investigacion acerca del cuidado infantil en referencia a las preguntas de los padres sobre calidad.

 urlLink Young Children's Emotional Development and School Readiness. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by C. Cybele Raver. It shows how emotional development impacts school readiness. From the ERIC Digest: The current emphasis on children's academic preparedness continues to overshadow the importance of children's social and emotional development for school readiness (Raver & Zigler, 1997). Research, however, indicates that young children's emotional adjustment matters--children who are emotionally well adjusted have a significantly greater chance of early school success, while children who experience serious emotional difficulty face grave risks of early school difficulty. This Digest presents a brief overview of longitudinal research linking children's emotional development to school readiness and early school success and then discusses interventions designed for children entering school.

 urlLink Self-Regulation and School Readiness. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Dgest is by Clancy Blair. It shows how self-regulation can influence school readiness. From the ERIC Digest: Self-regulation of behavior generally refers to controlled, cognitive monitoring of the actions and steps required to obtain a goal, or to bring about a desired response from the environment. Age-related changes in self-regulation as well as individual differences in self-regulation at a given age or developmental stage play fundamental roles in shaping children's experiences and the responses that children bring forth from caregivers and others. Changes from basic types of reflexive regulation in infancy (e.g., self-soothing, gaze aversion), to early attempts at voluntary control of behavior in toddlerhood (e.g., the intentional coordination of walking and reaching to gain some end), to active, cognitive control of behavior in the early childhood years (e.g., remembering and following rules) represent key developmental shifts in children's abilities (Kopp, 1989). Increasingly, research in child development has come to focus on these shifts and the ways in which parents, peers, and early care experiences play an important part in the development of children's self-regulation (NICHD Early Child Care Research Network, 2003). However, individual differences in children's temperamental emotional reactivity (an automatic autonomic and behavioral response to emotion-inducing stimulation) and the ability to control this reactivity are also important for understanding developing self-regulation. This Digest focuses on emotional reactivity and its relation to the development of cognitive functions that promote self-regulation in young children. It examines how emotions may influence the development of the cognitive functions that contribute to successful self-regulation and thereby to school readiness.

 urlLink Technology Professional Development: Successful Strategies for Teacher Change. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Harvey Barnett. It shows ways that technology training can better teaching. From the ERIC Digest: The goal of any professional development program is to inform and change teacher behavior as a result of new information. To this end, teachers and other educators spend countless hours in professional development activities learning to use new instructional strategies or materials. Sometimes there is change, and sometimes the person goes right back to doing what he or she had been doing all along. Bob Pearlman, Director of Strategic Planning, New Technology Foundation, said once in a speech, "Anybody who thinks they can inculcate teachers with anything on a mandatory basis is nuts." The trick then is to design your professional development activities in a way that ensures that teachers' time and your investment in time and money pay off in increased student achievement. Getting teacher buy in is important when technology is involved, especially for those who are not convinced technology is worth the time and effort. The first step of any sound professional development program is to develop a belief about technology professional development that includes the idea that the curriculum drives the use of technology, not vice-versa, and that empowered teachers will find appropriate ways to include technology with their ongoing instruction rather than view it as an activity unconnected to the district's content standards. Research and best teaching practices consistently show that without effective staff development and continuous support, technology integration will never be satisfactorily achieved (Bailey and Powell, 1998).

 urlLink The Impact of Electronic Communication on Writing. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Mardziah Hayati Abdullah. It examines how things like e-mail and chat have impacted writing skills. From the ERIC Digest: Electronic communication (or e-communication) places new demands on language that leads to interesting variations in written language use (Biesenbach-Lucas & Wiesenforth, 2001). The language of e-mail, chats, Web-based discussions and SMS messages is marked by features of both informal speech and formal writing, a host of text-based icons and acronyms for managing social interaction, and changes in spelling norms (Abdullah, 1998). In addition, the electronic medium (e-medium) provides a new context for the writing process. These phenomena have prompted research on whether students' frequent engagement with electronic writing (e-writing) has implications for writing and writing instruction. This digest summarizes some insights gained from research on writing behavior and performance in the electronic age.

 urlLink Using Drama and Theatre To Promote Literacy Development: Some Basic Classroom Applications. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Ping-Yun Sun. It reviews some simple ways to use drama to help reading skills. From the ERIC Digest: Although numerous researchers have emphasized the tremendous effect drama and theatre can have on children's cognitive and affective development as well as provided abundant resources for teachers, there still exists a gap between understanding its value and actually applying it (Furman, 2000). The reasons teachers still hesitate to embrace the ideas of utilizing drama and theatre in classroom activities can be summarized as follows: (1) In the search for drama resources to develop curricula, teachers are easily overwhelmed by various terms used in drama and theatre, such as creative drama, creative dramatics, developmental drama, process drama, educational drama, improvisational drama, improvisation, informal drama, classroom drama, drama in education, etc. (2) Dramatic activities tend to be placed at the "edge" of the official curriculum; they seem to be time-consuming and unnecessary. (3) Since most teacher education programs do not offer courses related to drama and theatre, teachers are unfamiliar with facilitating dramatic activities (Furman, 2000). (4) Dramatic activities are so playful that teachers might be afraid that children will not take learning seriously. In light of these factors that hinder teachers in the use of drama and theatre in classroom application, this Digest will explain the "myths" of drama and theatre and focus on their effect on children's literacy development. In addition, rather than presenting a tour de force of resources, this Digest will highlight some readily applicable strategies for classroom application.

 urlLink Literacy Instruction through Communicative and Visual Arts. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Chia-Hui Lin. It looks at some ways that literacy can be taught. From the ERIC Digest: The purpose of this Digest is to explore the evidence suggesting the effectiveness of literacy instruction through communicative and visual arts. According to Flood, Heath, and Lapp (1997), visual arts includes everything from dramatic performances, comic books, to television viewing. The communicative arts, such as reading, writing, and speaking, exist as integrated elements in the visual arts. These authors argued that using visual arts in literacy instruction motivates students to become involved in the communicative arts. By taking visual arts away from the communicative arts in the classroom, schools would grow away from the fundamental skills that adults need to function in society.

 urlLink Understanding and Preventing Teacher Burnout. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Wood, Teri and McCarthy, Chris. Everyone wants to retain teachers but how do we keep them from burning out? From the ERIC Digest: Many teachers find the demands of being a professional educator in today's schools difficult and at times stressful. When work stress results in teacher burnout, it can have serious consequences for the health and happiness of teachers, and also the students, professionals, and families they interact with on a daily basis.

 urlLink National Standards for Athletic Coaches. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Jody Brylinsky. It reviews national standards for coaches. From the ERIC Digest: Over a decade has passed since Conn and Razor (1989) proclaimed "a legal and moral responsibility to provide qualified individuals to coach young people" (p. 161) yet there has been little interest in examining how best to develop that level of expertise in professional training (Abraham & Collins, 1998). The question of coach preparation and training has become a priority issue for many schools and communities. However, there is limited research on the inexact science of coaching and the complex dynamic social activity in which the coach is engaged (Jones, Armour, & Potrac, 2002). Public complaints, including increasing litigation, often claim a failure of coaches to properly instruct skills or techniques, warn of inherent danger/risks, or gain appropriate training prior to assuming leadership responsibility in a sport program (Johnson, 1992). The appointment of unprepared individuals to coaching positions could lead to serious medical problems for the athletes and serious legal problems for sport organizations (Conn & Razor, 1989). Further, investigation of the multifaceted social relationships between coach and athlete is necessary to more fully understand how coach training can be linked to more effectively meeting the psychological and physical development of athletes (Potrac, Brewer, Jones, Armour, & Hoff, 2000).

 urlLink The Preparation and Professional Development of Teachers of English Language Learners. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Beth Antunez. From the ERIC Digest: The population of school-aged English language learners (ELLs) has consistently and significantly increased over the past decade, transforming America's public schools, the instruction of its students, and the preparation of its teachers. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 requires there be a "highly qualified" teacher in every classroom by the end of 2005, and school districts and teacher preparation institutions across the nation face the challenge of preparing and hiring large numbers of teachers while retaining a focus on quality. This digest will discuss the need for increasing the numbers of teachers of ELLs and the particular linguistic and academic characteristics of ELLs.

 urlLink Implications of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 for Teacher Education. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Christopher Trahan. It reviews the different impacts that No Child Left Behind Act has for schools. From the ERIC Digest: First enacted in 1965, and last reauthorized in 1994, the most recent reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) was signed into law by President George W. Bush on January 8, 2002 (P.L. 107-110). Since its inception, as part of President Lyndon B. Johnson's "Great Society" programs, it has been reauthorized (or amended) approximately every five years. Each of these reauthorizations have given the Administration and Congress the opportunity to add, delete, or modify provisions in the law in response to current demands and expectations. As the latest incarnation of ESEA, the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) amends and changes in many ways programs in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Although the main component of this bill is Title I, the government's flagship aid program for disadvantaged students, section II of NCLB focuses on teacher education quality.

 urlLink Emerging Challenges for Community Colleges. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Pam Schuetz. From the ERIC Digest: In just over a century, the American community college system has expanded from a single institution to over one thousand colleges serving almost half of all students enrolled in public higher education. While community colleges have adapted successfully to waves of changes over the years, a unique combination of demographic and socioeconomic changes predicted for the next decade promises to challenge the resilience of these low-cost, open-access institutions. This digest is drawn from "Next Steps for the Community College" (New Directions for Community Colleges, Spring 2002) and summarizes three overlapping challenges facing colleges in the coming decade: educating a more diverse student body, assessing student outcomes, and maintaining the educated workforce needed to meet the increasingly complex needs of the students and institutions.

 urlLink Telecommunications Distance Learning and Teacher Preparation. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Maryellen S. Cosgrove. From the ERIC Digest: Distance learning (DL) is not a new phenomenon in education. First-century didactic lessons via written letters may be the actual birth of learning in a non-face to face mode. Formal correspondence courses can be traced back to the early 1800's when adults learned the art of 'shorthand' by subscribing to mail-order lessons. In 1886 Pennsylvania State University began the first series of courses disseminated from a university campus. Twenty years later the National University Continuing Education Association (NUCEA) was formed to coordinate and monitor correspondence and extension courses offered nationwide. In 1934 Iowa State University was the first institution to offer courses via television. By using multiple media modes of interactive television, fax and e-mail, telecommunication courses were expanded in the 1970's to offer learners the opportunities to communicate with the instructor and other students (Matthews, 1999). According to LePage (1996), it is important that new teachers be familiar with the potential uses of technology. This may be accomplished by providing opportunities to learn from and use telecommunication technologies in teacher preparation programs. Since contemporary children are generally proficient using computers and the Internet, educators are wise to consider going beyond the traditional methods and materials of instruction in an effort to meet their students' needs and interests. From social, political and technological view points, schools need to prepare children to live in a complex and rapidly changing world. DL can enable them to do this by meeting and collaborating with students from other sites. Teachers no longer focus on a single lesson to a single group of children but rather a multitude of activities directed to diverse and distant learners (Nixon & Leftwich, 1998). Through the use of two-way, interactive, full-motion compressed video transmitted through fiber optics, classrooms can now be laboratories with access to the world!

 urlLink Professional Development of Principals. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Fenwick, Leslie T. - Pierce, Mildred C. From the ERIC Digest: Societal changes have stimulated new pressures on schools and those who lead them. Technology, demographic shifts, redefinitions of "family," testing and accountability, decentralization and site-based management, violence, changes in the economy, new court mandates related to desegregation, various legislative initiatives such as school vouchers, and the press to privatize have created a web of conflicting demands and expectations for school principals. These changes have resulted in "a turning of the role of principal 90 degrees from everywhere" (Prestine, 1994, p. 150). Contemporary models of school reform acknowledge the principal as the passport to school success. The modern principal is no longer the "principal" teacher, but rather the manager of an increasingly complex organization. Principals today are expected to create a team relationship among staff members, acquire and allocate resources, promote teacher development, improve students' performance on standardized tests, and build effective community linkages (Drake and Roe, 2002; Pierce, 2002). Additionally, principals are supposed to interact with teachers, parents, community members, and students. Strong collaboration and instructional skills have replaced strong bureaucratic skills as important attributes of effective principals (Drake and Roe, 2002; Neufeld, 1997). In many respects, the demands on principals mirror those on teachers who are attempting to become facilitators of children's learning and are rethinking their notions of content, pedagogy, and assessment (Neufeld, 1997). Principals need continuous professional development opportunities to support their efforts toward school improvement and revitalize their commitment to creating and sustaining positive learning communities (Foster, Loving and Shumate, 2000; Evans and Mohr, 1999; Neufeld, 1997).

 urlLink The National Council on Teacher Quality: Expanding the Teacher Quality Discussion. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Suh, Thomas - Fore, Raechelle. It looks at teacher quality. From the ERIC Digest: What does the future bode for America's schoolchildren? Recent results of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP)--the Nation's Report Card--indicate improved student performance in both math and reading. These statistical gains, however, are modest, and when viewed in the context of actual learning, are not so promising. The average eighth-grader cannot calculate the amount of change from a purchase (Braswell, Lutkus, Grigg, Santapau, Tay-Lim, & Johnson, 2000), and indications are that s/he will not be able to do so for another six years. In reading, nearly 40 percent of fourth-graders remain unable to read at even a basic level--a level defined as "prerequisite" for reading proficiently (Donahue, Finnegan, Lutkus, Allen, & Campbell, 2001). Results in the international arena are even more discouraging. In the 1995 Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) involving twenty-six nations including the United States, American fourth-graders placed twelfth in mathematics, and a respectable third in science (Calsyn, Gonzales, & Frase, 1999). When TIMSS was re-administered four years later to eighth-graders in thirty-eight countries, American students had lost ground, slipping to nineteenth in mathematics and eighteenth in science (Gonzales, Calsyn, Jocelyn, Mak, Kastberg, Arafeh, Williams, & Tsen, 2001). Why such poor performances? One explanation is the predominance of teachers not qualified to teach. Research tells us that the influence of teachers is the single-most important factor in determining student achievement, even more so than socioeconomic status (Sanders & Rivers, 1996; Collias, Pajak, & Rigden, 2000), which for years was deemed as having the highest correlation to academic success (Coleman, 1966). Studies also indicate that the impact of a teacher (for good or for bad) is cumulative, having a lasting, measurable effect on academic performance (Sanders & Rivers, 1996), and accounting for the discrepancy between "gifted" and "remedial" (Haycock, 1998). Students with less exposure to qualified teachers, therefore, seem far less likely of achieving academic success than those with more. Given the recurrence of disappointing results on student learning assessments at the national and international levels, too many of America's students do not appear to be receiving enough exposure to qualified teachers.

 urlLink Positive Character Development in School Sport Programs. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Jennifer Beller. It reviews how sports can help to buold character. From the ERIC Digest: Sportsmanship and the development of positive character have long been explicit goals of school sports. A strong belief exists that sport programs have the power to promote the development of "...sportsmanlike behaviors, ethical decision-making skills, and a total curriculum for moral character development" (Stoll, 1995, p. 335) and provide a social environment to acquire personal and social values and behaviors contributing to good character and good citizenship (Arnold, 1984; Sage, 1998). The arena of sport can provide one of "the greatest opportunities for a student to learn honesty, integrity... and ethical behavior" or it can provide "one of the greatest opportunities in school for a youngster to learn how to be dishonest...or how to be hypocritical" (Sabock, 1985, p. 271). Little empirical research exists supporting that mere participation in and of itself leads to the development of moral character. In fact, the opposite appears true, that sport participation may be more likely to negatively affect moral character (Bredemeier, 1984; Priest, Krause, & Beach, 1999; Stoll & Beller, 2000). Whether positive or negative, "[s]ports have immense power to shape consciousness, values, and beliefs of athletes and to pass on selected aspects of the dominant culture" (Sage, 1998, p. 264). This digest discusses the formal and informal processes of moral character development, in light of the types of programs that have shown to improve moral character, sportsmanship, and fair play.

 urlLink Selecting and Retaining Teacher Mentors. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Bonnie B. Mullinix. It views methods for finding and keeping good teacher mentors. From the ERIC Digest: The last decade has produced a great deal of literature and research documenting the importance of teacher mentors in teacher training and retention programs. This digest offers some collected wisdom regarding considerations and strategies for selecting and retaining teacher mentors. Related sub-issues of recruitment and compensation are also addressed. While presented in a sequential pattern, selection and retention of mentors are, in reality, integrated features of an on-going and spiraling process. Mentors continually cycle into and out of teacher education, induction and retention programs. The degree to which these critical participants are meaningfully engaged in the mentoring process may have a significant impact on a program's success.

 urlLink Multiple Points of Entry into Teaching for Urban Communities. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Post, Linda - Pugach, Marleen - Hains, Ann - Thurman, Alfonzo. It looks at the ways teachers enter teaching in cities. From the ERIC Digest: The nationwide shortage of teachers is well documented, and nowhere is the shortage more dire than in urban school districts (Recruiting New Teachers, 2000), which struggle both to recruit and retain new teachers. Not only do urban school districts face a shortage of teachers generally, but also they continue to face a persistent gap between a primarily white, middle class teaching force and student populations that are primarily of color, have a native language other than English, or are of low socioeconomic levels (Villegas & Lucas, 2002). When the majority of teachers in urban schools do not reflect the communities of their students, the potential for a mismatch between teachers and their students is unmistakable (Carr, 2002; Delpit, 1995; Kalyanpur & Harry, 1999; Hodgkinson, 2001; Hodgkinson, 2002), and "Different cultural beliefs and practices have been noted as a frequent barrier to effective [read respectful] interaction" (Harry, Kalyanpur and Day, 1999, p. 6). This lack of cultural or language familiarity and understanding can be damaging to the goal of making sure that every child in an urban school district achieves to his or her potential (Gay, 2000; Gay, 2002; Howard, 1999). The shortage in qualified personnel to work in urban environments (Villegas & Clewell, 1998) and in specific disciplines continues (23rd Annual report to Congress, 2001). For example, "A report earlier this year from the U.S. Department of Education said that 13 percent of the special-education positions in the nation's schools in 1999-2000 were being filled by teachers who weren't certified in special education, including 12,000 positions being held by substitute teachers" (Temkin, 2002). These shortages are accentuated by the need to recruit and retain qualified personnel of different cultures, values and languages (National Center for Education Statistics, 1996). Hanson (1998) notes, "existing training programs for professionals who are most likely to work with children with disabilities and their families still have relatively few students who represent cultures with non-Anglo-European roots" (pp. 8-9). Similarly, few higher education preparation programs are culturally responsive to ethnic and language diversity (Isenberg, 2000; Gay, 2002; Kushner & Ortiz, 2000) or have diverse faculty (Isenberg, 2000; APA, 1997). "If the needs of children and families are to be authentically addressed, our leaders need to reflect the communities they serve (Elliott, K., Alvarado, C., Copland, J., Surr, W., Farris, M., Genser, A., et al., 1999, p. 2). In the face of such critical shortages, it appears traditional recruitment strategies in teacher education alone will not be sufficient to meet this ongoing need--at least not in the foreseeable future (Hodgkinson, 2002). One strategy for cutting into the teacher shortage systematically is to support a wide range of pipelines for those in our community who wish to become teachers--in other words, multiple entry points into teaching. The goal is to ensure that every individual interested in a career in teaching in the community has access to a preservice program that best matches his or her education, experience, family circumstances, and timeframe.

 urlLink Understanding Faculty: A Step Toward Improving Professional Development Programs. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Rozana Carducci. From the ERIC Digest: A study by Huber states that "community college faculty constitute 31% of all U.S. higher education faculty, teaching 39% of all higher education students and 46% of all first-year students" (as cited in Editors notes, 2002, p. 1). Given the strong presence of community college faculty in the academy, it is essential that colleges develop institutional programs and policies that enhance community college teaching and learning. To be effective, these programs need to take into account the differing backgrounds, perspectives, and goals of community college faculty. This Digest, drawn from "Community College Faculty: Characteristics, Practices, and Challenges"(New Directions for Community Colleges, Summer 2002), summarizes research findings on the similarities and differences among community college faculty groups and concludes with a discussion of how this information can be used to increase the relevance and effectiveness of faculty development initiatives. The research findings of this NDCC are drawn from the Center for the Study of Community Colleges' 2000 National Faculty Survey and the 1993 and 1999 National Survey of Post-secondary Faculty.

 urlLink Building an Instructional Framework for Effective Community College Developmental Education. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Caroline Q. Sheldon. From the ERIC Digest: Research reveals that exemplary developmental education programs operate within established instructional environments where value and high expectations for positive student outcomes take precedence (Boylan, 2002; Roueche & Roueche, 1999). In spite of these findings, the majority of community colleges offer fragmented developmental education programs (Shults, 2000). In order to flourish, community college developmental education, defined in this context as "courses or services provided for the purpose of helping underprepared college students attain their academic goals," (Boylan, 2002, p. 3) requires college presidents, trustees, and chief academic officers to play a central role in creating the instructional framework conducive to successful developmental education outcomes. These high-level administrators foster a culture of success by insisting that faculty, staff, and students endeavor to meet institutional expectations in developmental education. In their studies of exemplary practices, both Boylan (2002) and Roueche and Roueche (1999) concluded that positive student outcomes were more likely to be achieved when institutional leaders established high standards for success, expected everyone involved in the developmental education effort to strive toward achieving program goals, as well as created the opportunity for success by crafting the instructional framework most beneficial to student outcomes. An effective developmental education instructional framework necessitates that community colleges adopt a philosophy of practice shared by institutional stakeholders across instructional boundaries. Research by Grubb (2001) supports the idea of directed, coordinated developmental education programs rather than reliance on "individual and idiosyncratic efforts" to achieve institutional outcomes (p. 2). This digest offers community college academic leaders a synopsis of the key components necessary for building an instructional framework advantageous to a successful developmental education effort. Specific emphasis is placed on program structure, faculty, and program improvement. Although vital, the consideration of the full range of programs, services, and approaches impacting student outcomes in developmental education, including assessment and placement of students, "bridge" courses linking developmental course content with college level subjects, limitations on developmental student credit hour loads, counseling, and instructional support services is beyond the scope of this digest.

 urlLink Hispanic Students and Community Colleges: A Critical Point for Intervention. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Victor B. Saenz. From the ERIC Digest: In recent years issues pertaining to Hispanics* in higher education have garnered heightened attention from researchers and policy makers, and as part of this attention, community colleges have begun to receive increased attention as the decisive link in the greater overall educational attainment of this group. Hispanic college student enrollments have increased steadily during the last two decades, driven by increases at two-year institutions that saw the number of Hispanic students triple (NCES, 2001, Table 207). Despite the surge in enrollment, this group remains notably underrepresented at all levels of higher education, and has one of the lowest overall educational attainment rates of any major ethnic or racial group (U.S. Census Bureau, 1998). Nonetheless, the community college sector has become a critical avenue towards higher degree attainment for Hispanic students as evidenced by the increasing number choosing this path (Wilds & Wilson, 1998; Fry, 2002). This digest explores the status of Hispanic students at community colleges, including a summary of recent enrollment and transfer trends, a focus on factors that shape Hispanic student enrollment at community colleges, and an overview of an exemplary program that facilitates the successful matriculation of Hispanic college students from two-year institutions to baccalaureate completion.

 urlLink Teaching Artistically Able Students with Exceptionalities. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Robin Johnson. From the ERIC Digest: Creating differentiated art curricula to accommodate artistically talented students' individual needs may enhance student performance and program outcomes. This Digest discusses (1) individual education plans for artistically able students with exceptionalities, (2) subgroups of students with dual exceptionalities, (3) methods of teaching students with dual exceptionalities, and (4) methods of teaching students with specific disabilities.

 urlLink Overcoming Senior Slump: The Community College Role. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Kimberly Peterson. From the ERIC Digest: A growing body of literature suggests that high school curriculum, especially during the senior year, is greatly lacking in academic intensity. A recent report from the National Commission on the High School Senior Year indicates that students find the last year of high school to be "a waste of time" and "boring" (2001, pp. 16-17). Not only are students not being challenged during their senior year, they are also not preparing for college. The Education Trust reports that while almost three-quarters of high school graduates are entering higher education each year, only about half of these students have completed at least a mid-level college preparatory curriculum (4 years of English, and 3 years each of math, science, and social studies), and these numbers drop to about 12 percent when 2 years of foreign language and a semester of computer science are included (2001). These reports conclude that high school students need to be engaged in more rigorous coursework, and they advocate the involvement of higher education institutions in providing opportunities for high school students to enroll in more challenging courses. This digest will examine this high school curriculum issue, and in particular, its implications for higher education and the role that community colleges can play in combating "senior slump".

 urlLink Use of the Spanish Language in the United States: Trends, Challenges, and Opportunities. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Santiestevan, Stina. From the ERIC Digest: Continuing controversy about the nation's non-English speakers--particularly its Spanish speakers--often prompts two questions. First, will the use of Spanish diminish or grow more widespread? Second, is the use of the Spanish language only a challenge for educators and citizens, or does it also present opportunities as yet unrealized? This Digest addresses policymakers, administrators, and teachers of Spanish-speaking students. It is based largely on a study by sociologist Calvin Veltman (1988), The Future of the Spanish Language in the United States. The Digest examines the Spanish-speaking group in the United States, its growth through net immigration and natural increase, and its eventual decline as speakers shift to English.

 urlLink School Completion 2000: Dropout Rates and Their Implications for Meeting the National Goal. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Howley, Craig and Huang, Gary. From the ERIC Digest: The second goal adopted at the 1990 Education Summit in Charlottesville, Virginia, aims to increase the high school graduation rate to 90 percent by the year 2000. To interpret this goal and to work toward it, educators and policymakers need current data on school completion and early school leaving. What is a "dropout"? What is the extent of early school leaving? How does the dropout rate vary among different groups and regions? Finally, what do available data imply about possible strategies for meeting the goal? This Digest draws on recent studies to answer these questions.

 urlLink Teaching and Learning in the Multigrade Classroom: Student Performance and Instructional Routines. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Bruce Miller. From the ERIC Digest: The multigrade classroom is an organizational pattern widely used in schools in the United States. Typically a feature of small-scale schooling, multigrade classrooms are today getting a closer look. This Digest, written for practitioners, parents, and policymakers, brings together recent information on the topic. It considers the history of the multigrade classroom, its effects on achievement and attitude, and the requirements of teaching and learning in multigrade classrooms.

 urlLink Recent Trends in Rural Poverty: A Summary for Educators. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Huang, Gary and Howley, Craig. From the ERIC Digest: Intended primarily for educators and policymakers, this Digest summarizes recent information about poverty in rural areas. The discussion considers the recent growth in rural poverty and presents a profile of the rural poor. It also reports evidence about possible causes of rural poverty and interprets possible meanings for teachers and administrators. Discussion is based on the distinction between metropolitan (urban) and nonmetropolitan (rural) areas. Briefly, metropolitan areas are closely integrated (by economic relations, communication, and transportation links) with central cities of at least 50,000 residents. Nonmetropolitan areas comprise everything else. The advantage of this definition is that it is commonly used by the U.S. Bureau of the Census.

 urlLink Migrant Students Who Leave School Early: Strategies for Retrieval. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Anne Salerno. From the ERIC Digest: This Digest examines the extent of early school leaving among migrants, conditions that precede early school leaving, common features of programs that work to retrieve dropouts, and illustrative programs that exhibit these features. The discussion of the predicament of migrant students, however, recognizes that retrieval programs must be adapted to local contexts.

 urlLink Fighting Alcohol and Substance Abuse among American Indian and Alaskan Native Youth. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Nancy Gale. From the ERIC Digest: Data from the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (National Institute, 1989) show that about 50 percent of all U.S. adolescents have used alcohol. The comparable figure for American Indian and Alaskan Native youth ("Native youth" hereafter) is approximately 80 percent (Beauvais, Oetting, & Wolf, 1989). Early experimentation with alcohol and drugs places Native youth, in particular, at risk for serious problems. What creates this situation, and, more to the point, what is happening to correct it?

 urlLink Efficient Financial Management in Rural Schools: Common Problems and Solutions from the Field. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Deborah Inman-Freitas. From the ERIC Digest: Good financial management of rural schools is a complex task, one made more difficult in recent years by the declining economic fortunes of rural areas nationwide. This Digest describes the challenge and briefly reports solutions developed by practitioners in rural schools. It is based on responses to a recent nationwide survey of rural school administrators conducted in cooperation with the American Association of School Administrators (AASA). More detailed information is available in a longer report available from both ERIC/CRESS and AASA (Inman-Freitas, forthcoming).

 urlLink Funding Rural, Small Schools: Strategies at the Statehouse. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Deborah Verstegen. From the ERIC Digest: Early efforts to achieve greater efficiency in schooling focused on educating the largest number of students at the lowest possible cost. Research about schools, following industrial models, stressed the phenomenon of "economies of scale." If industry could boom as a result of such economies, why could not education benefit in similar ways? Subsequently, aggressive state policy initiatives sought to capture similar benefits for education through consolidating schools and districts. Today, by contrast, more attention is being given to what education dollars produce in terms of morale, student achievement, curriculum, and positive attitudes towards learning. This change in outlook is driven by a growing body of research that focuses on the outcomes that dollars buy (e.g., Fox, 1981; Goodlad, 1984; Hawkins, 1985; Monk, 1990; Plecki, 1991; Turner, Camilli, Kroc, & Hoover, 1986). In particular, recent studies suggest that small schools and districts may be a more efficient investment than large schools, because the learning value per unit of expenditure seems to be higher there (Plecki, 1991; Walberg & Fowler, 1987). The new findings represent a dilemma for lawmakers, educators, and communities. This issue especially concerns rural areas, since schools and districts there tend to be smaller than their urban or suburban counterparts. This Digest examines state strategies for meeting the unique financing needs of rural, small schools and districts. To what extent do states actually provide additional support for rural and small schools? On what basis is this support distributed?

 urlLink The Mandate To Help Low-Performing Schools. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Larry Lashway. From the ERIC Digest: The twentieth anniversary of A Nation at Risk has inspired numerous retrospective looks at the last two decades of school reform. The verdict is usually the same: noteworthy progress, but lots of unfinished business. High on the to-do list is the stubborn problem of low-performing schools in which a majority of students persistently fail to meet academic standards. Despite repeated reform efforts, many of these institutions are not performing much better than they did in 1983. While images of failed schools have long been a motivating force in educational reform, the passage of No Child Left Behind (NCLB) has created a new sense of urgency. Confronted with a steadily rising bar for achievement, schools that lag behind will lose students, autonomy, and perhaps even their right to exist. Moreover, educators and citizens are realizing that low-performing schools go hand in hand with the achievement gap. Many struggling schools serve largely minority populations whose test scores persistently fall below those of white students. In an age when testing carries high stakes for students, the potential social consequences give the issue even greater significance. Turning around a school is a complex process in which clear cause-effect relationships are difficult to isolate, but the recent interest has generated some useful research and thoughtful analysis. This Digest explores some of the key insights from that literature.

 urlLink After-School and Community Technology Education Programs for Low-Income Families. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Wendy Schwartz. From the ERIC Digest: The number of family programs in low-income communities that promote computer and internet literacy is steadily growing. They provide easy access to computer technology and instruction, courses for adults in parenting and job skills, educational and recreational after-school activities for children, and family learning activities. Many of the programs are characterized by partnerships among government agencies, corporations, and non-profit organizations that together are able to provide a wealth of resources (North Central Regional Educational Laboratory, NCREL, 2001; OMB Watch, 2000; Wilhelm, Carmen, & Reynolds, 2002). Because many of the programs have not been operating very long, the process for evaluating the overall effectiveness of family technology programs is still in the early stages. To date, there have been small-scale but rigorous evaluations of some programs, and less formal studies based on interviews and observations have been conducted on others. Findings indicate that a high percentage of the programs are having at least some positive effects on participants' learning and community engagement, and guidelines for implementing effective after-school programs are emerging (Penuel & Kim, 2000). This digest provides a review of these recommendations, but first presents brief descriptions of urban programs found to be effective for low-income youth and their families. Some are projects of national initiatives that welcome new local affiliates, while others are independent local programs whose creativity might spark the development of equally innovative programs elsewhere.

 urlLink Improving Graduation Outcomes for Migrant Students. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Margaret A. Gibson. From the ERIC Digest: This Digest explores several key factors that contribute to the academic persistence and achievement of high-school-aged migrant youth. The discussion draws from research in one California high school and from the broader literature on promoting educational success for working-class minority youth. BACKGROUND OF STUDY As of July 2002, there were 819,000 migrant children nationwide. [1] These children are among the most disadvantaged in the United States due to the combined effects of poverty, poor nutrition and health care, and high absenteeism from school related to work responsibilities and family mobility. To be eligible for migrant services, a child must have moved from one school district to another within the past three years to obtain temporary or seasonal work in agriculture or fishing, or to accompany a parent or guardian seeking this kind of work. Secondary students who no longer migrate may continue to be serviced through credit accrual programs until graduation. Many migrant children fall behind academically as they progress through school. The best and most recent national studies of school completion rates (now more than a decade old) estimated that only about half received a high school diploma (State University of New York [SUNY] Oneonta Migrant Programs, 1987; Vamos, 1992). By contrast, 77% of the migrant students who entered the study school, Hillside High School (HHS), in the fall of 1998 completed 12th grade 4 years later; another 8% remained in school pursuing a GED. [2] In a comparison sample of nonmigrant Mexican-descent students, only 39% graduated from high school on schedule.

 urlLink Enrollment Trends in Community Colleges. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Hans A. Andrews. From the ERIC Digest: Community colleges are rapidly adapting their policies, procedures and services to accommodate new and growing groups of students. New community college student enrollment groups include (1) dual-credit and dual-enrollment students taking college courses during their last two years of high school; (2) reverse transfer students, both those who have attended a senior college without completing a degree, and those who have completed one or more degrees; and (3) students needing or wishing to obtain job retraining. Serving these students offers community colleges a way to meaningfully address some major educational and employment concerns that have arisen today. This digest presents key information and current research on these three expanding categories of students enrolling in American community colleges at the beginning of the 21st century.

 urlLink Counseling Non-Traditional Students at the Community College. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Edward Francis Ryan. From the ERIC Digest: Within ther Community college setting, counseling centers were developed to help students "find and effectively use the information, skills, insight, and understanding they need in order to be successful, first and primarily in the college and secondarily, later in life" (Helfgot, 1995 p. 49). While there has been some variation in the types of services available, counselors have historically provided academic advising, career guidance, and personal counseling (Coll, 1993; Helfgot, 1995). Today the profile of the typical community college student is quite different than when counseling centers originated some forty years ago, but the services offered look basically the same (Cohen and Brawer, 1996). The change in student demographics has caused many to question whether the counseling models developed in the 1960s still meet the needs of today's students (Pascarella and Terenzini, 1998; Pineda and Bowes, 1995). This digest addresses this issue, first exploring how the shifting demographics of community colleges affect the counseling function and then offering suggestions that counselors and researchers can employ to ensure that the services provided addresses the needs of today's students.

 urlLink Professional Development: Leading Organizational Change in Community Colleges. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Stefanie Stern. From the ERIC Digest: During the last few decades, professional development programs at many community colleges have evolved into dynamic forces creating institutional change by design. Comprehensive and powerful professional development programs have emerged that are no longer solely employee-centered outlets for individual improvement. Contemporary programs typically include all employees, recognizing that classified staff, counselors, administrators, college leaders, and faculty play significant roles in the shaping of the organization. Professional development itself focuses on topics specific to employee classification, but also examines issues facing the college as a whole. New goals of professional development are twofold: (1) to provide in-service training to all employee groups in a college, keeping in mind the challenges in reaching all employees, and (2) to enhance the broader mission and goals of the institution. The combination of the two is leading to substantive organizational change within community colleges. This Digest, drawn from "Enhancing Community Colleges Through Professional Development" (New Directions for Community Colleges, Winter 2002), reviews the context for the professional development movement today, describes programs that have utilized new formats for delivery, and demonstrates the impact professional development can make in addressing institutional needs.

 urlLink Student Involvement in the Community College Setting. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Christopher A. Chaves. From the ERIC Digest: American community colleges, urban ones in particular, face unique challenges with their first-generation, immigrant, economically disadvantaged, non-White, and limited English ability students (Hirose-Wong, 1999). Moreover, many traditional and non-traditional students alike are inadequately prepared, academically and psychologically, for college-level work and learning (Howell, 2001). These challenges can be exacerbated by students' failure to connect and become involved in college at the level necessary for academic and workplace success, herein defined as successful completion of required course work. Astin (1984) defines involvement as "the amount of physical and psychological energy that the student devotes to the academic experience" (p. 134). According to Tinto (1997), high levels of student involvement generally proved to be an independent predictor of gains in learning. Tinto (1987) posits that achieving success in student retention generally "hinges on the construction of educational communities in college, program, and classroom level which integrate students into the ongoing social and intellectual life of the institution" (p. 188). In the community college setting, a redefinition of what constitutes "involvement" is necessary, primarily because this non-residential constituency usually works at least part-time and, as a consequence, finds it difficult to become involved in traditional campus activities. This digest discusses three student involvement opportunities - freshmen orientation, learning resource centers, and community college learning communities - that can be critical for students' academic success.

 urlLink Fundamental Skills in Science: Observation. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by David L. Haury. From the ERIC Digest: "We value our sight above almost everything else. The reason for this is that of all the senses sight makes knowledge most possible for us and shows us the many differences between things." Aristotle, "Metaphysics", Book I "You see but you do not observe." Sherlock Holmes to Dr. Watson in "A scandal in Bohemia" Long before our ancestors invented writing, they created art representing their observations, and detailed observations of the night sky were being systematically recorded nearly 3,000 years ago (Kavassalis, 2000). Though the early Greeks recognized the importance of our senses in constructing knowledge, the primacy of observations was formally put to the test by Galileo who faced charges of heresy for supporting the heliocentric theory of the universe. Risking his life for the sake of ideas, Galileo not only believed in what he observed through the newly invented telescope, he believed in the newly emerging views of scientific knowledge based on reasoning and observations. De Duve (2002) has characterized science as being "based on observation and experiment, guided by reason" (p. 285), and this combination is what distinguishes science from other paths to knowledge. Derry (1999) makes the same point by saying that "well constructed scientific arguments, defending a scientific conclusion, generally rests on two foundations: reliable empirical evidence and sound logical reasoning" (p. 89). Martin (1972) was more explicit: "Scientific theories are primarily tested against observation and accepted, rejected, or modified mainly because of observational data. Observation is thus generally considered to be the touchstone of objectivity in science; it seems to be primarily observation that provides an independent standard for the evaluation of theories and hypotheses. If it were not for observation, there would be little reason for choosing between scientific theories and fictional accounts, between science and pseudoscience, between warranted assertions and fanciful hopes. " He goes on to caution, though, that "observation clearly cannot be maintained as infallible or certain. The existence of perceptual illusion, hallucinations, and other less dramatic perceptual errors proves that people can be deceived by their senses" (pp. 112-113).

 urlLink Finding Mathematics Teachers. ERIC Digest. This EROC Digest is by Linda A. Milbourne. From the ERIC Digest: Student performance in mathematics has been a matter of national concern for many years, and formal efforts to reform mathematics education has led to the development of national content standards (National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM),1989) and an update of those standards. (NCTM,2000). U.S. Governors identified mathematics achievement as a national priority by setting a goal that "By the year 2000, United States students will be first in the world in mathematics...achievement" (Report of the National Education Goals Panel, 1989). International comparisons of mathematics achievement, however, indicate that this has not occurred (National Commission on Mathematics and Science Teaching for the 21st Century, 2000). The good news is that we know how to improve the mathematics performance of students. Research shows that there is a connection between student achievement in mathematics and both the structure of the curriculum and the content of textbooks (Schmidt, et al, 2001), so ongoing development and implementation of content standard should ultimately lead to a desired increase in achievement. Research also indicates a positive relationship between teacher preparation and student achievement (Fetler, 2001; Darling-Hammond, 2000). Indeed, the research on teacher preparation in mathematics and science has led to very specific and practical guidelines for improving teacher education programs (Committee on Science and Mathematics Teacher Preparation, 2001). The bad news is the shortage of qualified teachers in mathematics classrooms. Though the number of high school mathematics teachers in U. S. public schools increased by 22,000 between 1990 and 2000 to a total of 134,000, the percentage of teachers who are assigned to teach high school mathematics classes who are certified to teach mathematics has decreased from 90% in 1990 to 86% in 2000. The situation is worse in middle schools. The number of middle school mathematics teachers has increased by 44,000 since 1994 to a total of 124,000 in 2000, but of teachers assigned to teach middle school mathematics in 2000, only 66% were certified to do so. Among the 50 states, only 11 have over 80% of their middle school mathematics teachers certified in mathematics (Blank & Langesen, 2001). The shortages for high-minority and low-income schools are particularly distressing. In schools with over 50% minority enrollment in grades 7-12, 24% of mathematics teachers teach out-of-field. For high-poverty schools where 60% or more of the students qualify for free or reduced-price lunch programs, 31% of mathematics teachers have neither an undergraduate or graduate major or minor in mathematics (Clewell & Forcier, 2001). Though state certification standards vary widely and some states do have higher percentages of their teachers certified to teach mathematics, the supply of qualified mathematics teachers remains inadequate nationwide. Indeed, 95% of urban school districts nationwide report an immediate need for high school mathematics teachers (Council of Great City Schools, 2000). The need to find qualified mathematics teachers for the nation's schools is critical. Shortages in qualified mathematics teachers led the "Glenn Commission" (National Commission on Mathematics and Science Teaching for the 21st Century, 2000) to call for a significant increase in teachers as one of its three primary goals (p. 29). To achieve this goal, actions are needed both to identify exemplary teacher preparation models that can be widely replicated, and to attract larger numbers of qualified individuals into teaching mathematics.

 urlLink Teaching about Ecosystems. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by David L. Haury. From the ERIC Digest: When someone asks us where we are from or what we do, most of us mention the town or city where we live, our occupation, where we attended school, or our family heritage. We respond in terms of human communities, cultures, and geopolitical boundaries. We seldom, if ever, describe ourselves in terms of our ecological status in the natural world. We humans have so completely ordered, designed, and defined our physical environs and social milieu that our ecological connections have slipped from consciousness. Perhaps this is why we seem so unaware of our impact on nature and our rapid destruction of natural systems. We simply do not perceive ourselves as being part of the natural order of beings. All of us live within ecological systems, or "ecosystems", and through our commerce, food distribution, and use of natural resources we each indirectly participate in the custodianship of many ecosystems worldwide. Ironically, we are simultaneously the most potent forces within most ecosystems, and yet nearly oblivious to the ecological effects of our daily lifestyles. There has never been a time when a deep understanding of ecosystems and our roles within them has been more critical. Indeed, the world's freshwater ecosystems are so degraded that their ability to support plant and animal life, including humans, is viewed by many as being in peril (Revenga, Brunner, Henninger, Kassem, & Payne, 2000). Learning about ecosystems is more than an expected focus in biology classes; it has become a study in survival. Ecosystems are functional units of interacting abiotic, biotic, and cultural (anthropogenic) components. All natural ecosystems are open systems where energy and matter are transferred in and out through the complex interactions of energy, water, carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and other cycles. Unfortunately, many scientists contend, we humans have disrupted the balance of transfers across ecosystem boundaries. In addition to learning our place within ecosystems, we must learn to become better stewards and managers of ecosystems. A history of the ecosystem concept has been presented by Bocking (1994). Unfortunately, some concepts related to ecosystems--food web, ecological adaptation, carrying capacity, niche--are complex and lead to misconceptions among students (Munson, 1994).

 urlLink Teaching Fractions: New Methods, New Resources. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Michael Meagher. From the ERIC Digest: The teaching of fractions continues to hold the attention of mathematics teachers and education researchers worldwide. In what order should various representations be introduced? Should multiple representations be introduced early, or one representation pursued in depth once? Does it matter if fractions are introduced as counting or as measurement? What is the relative importance of procedural, factual, and conceptual knowledge in success with fractions? These and other questions remain debated in the literature. Following an overview of recent research on teaching and learning fractions, suggestions are offered for practice, for locating resources having direct application in the classroom, and for further reading in the research literature.

 urlLink Understanding Sensory Integration. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by DiMatties, Marie E. and Jennifer H. Sammons. From the ERIC Digest: Michael is a third grade student who is waiting for the school bus. He is challenged by sensory experiences during everyday activities that most of us don't even think about. While he's still reeling from the battle with mom over brushing his teeth (that peppermint toothpaste tastes like fire in his mouth) the school bus pulls up. Michael runs past the bus monitor's haze of perfume and sits at the back of the bus. In his heightened state, he becomes even more aware of his new school shirt with its stiff label and that awful feeling like a wire brush being poked into the back of his neck. The sensory experiences of the movement of the bus, the sound of his excited classmates laughing and yelling above the roar of the bus engine all contribute to his increased agitation. By the time Michael arrives at school he is wound up and ready to unravel. There is no time to wait for the bus monitor's direction...getting off the bus quickly becomes a matter of survival and he resorts to pushing, shoving and finally kicking his way out. Unfortunately, there is a price to pay for this seemingly outward aggression...he can expect another trip to the principal's office. This digest defines sensory integration and sensory integration dysfunction (DSI). It outlines evaluation of DSI, treatment approaches and implications for parents and teachers, including compensatory strategies for minimizing the impact of DSI on a child's life.

 urlLink Indicators of Teacher Quality. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Goldhaber, Dan and Anthony, Emily. From the ERIC Digest: The No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act requires that states employ only "highly qualified" teachers by the end of the 2005-2006 school year, and, indeed, research has demonstrated teacher quality is the most important educational factor predicting student achievement (Ferguson, 1998; Hanushek, Kain, & Rivkin, 1999). Although studies have produced contradictory findings about which attributes of teachers are most likely to translate into effective classroom performance, some information on how specific teacher attributes correlate with teacher quality is available, and it can help guide administrators' hiring decisions. This digest briefly reviews this knowledge. TEACHER DEGREE LEVELS The research on the value of a teacher's advanced degree is mixed: some studies show that while additional teacher education has a positive correlation with student achievement in some cases, others find that it negatively affects achievement (Greenwald, Hedges, & Laine, 1996; Hanushek, 1986). Goldhaber and Brewer (1997) found that a teacher's advanced degree is not generally associated with increased student learning from the eighth to the tenth grade, but having an advanced degree in math and science for math and science teachers appears to influence students' achievement. The same results were not found to be true for teachers of English or history. Goldhaber and Brewer (1997) suggest that the findings of other studies about the impact on student achievement of teachers' advanced degrees are inconclusive because they considered only the level of the degree and not the subject of the degree, which may affect student achievement in different ways than the degree level. Nevertheless, results from all the studies seem to imply that there is not a positive correlation between teachers having advanced degrees in subjects other than those they teach and student achievement.

 urlLink Mathematics Achievement in Rural Schools. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Craig B. Howley. From the ERIC Digest: Rural communities need an infrastructure of good mathematics knowledge, according to some observers. Moses and Cobb (2001), in particular, argue that mathematical knowledge will, in the new century, figure as a path to political and cultural power, much as the capacity to read and write served in the 19th and 20th centuries. What is the baseline of mathematical knowledge among students in the rural United States? Poverty in nonmetropolitan areas exceeds that in metropolitan areas (Jolliffe, 2002), and, for this reason, one might reasonably suspect that mathematics achievement in rural schools is depressed as compared to the national average. Is this really the case? This Digest assesses the best evidence available and concludes with recommendations for further action, based in part on conclusions reached by a national effort to develop new research about mathematics education in rural places.

 urlLink Health Literacy beyond Basic Skills. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Sandra Kerka. From the ERIC Digest: The relationship between health and literacy is often discussed in terms of the health-related problems that may be associated with low literacy. However, health literacy is an issue that spans education and age levels. This Digest looks beyond adult basic education to address issues of health and literacy for all adults and educational responses to them. In contemporary society, a constellation of changes has complicated the adult's challenge of being healthy: the health care system's shift from a paternalist to a partnership model, with more individual responsibility for prevention, informed decision making, and consent; complex choices about insurance; the need for self-management of chronic conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure; and responsibility for both children's and elders' health care. Adults at all literacy levels must cope with conflicting media reports about environmental health hazards, diet and nutrition, the safety of hormone replacement therapy, and the appropriate frequency of screening tests; myths and misconceptions about communicable diseases such as smallpox, anthrax, and SARS; pharmaceutical company advertising about new drugs; and the vast amounts of health information available on the Internet. Health literacy is defined as the capacity to obtain, interpret, understand, and use information to promote and maintain health (Greenberg 2001; Shohet 2002). Health consumers must be able to evaluate information for credibility and quality, analyze relative risks and benefits, calculate dosages, interpret test results, and locate health information, tasks that may require visual, computer, information, and computational literacy (Sullivan 2000). Nutbeam's model (1999) depicts three levels of health literacy that encompass the skills and abilities in these definitions: (1) functional health literacy--basic reading and writing skills to understand and follow simple health messages; (2) interactive health literacy--more advanced literacy, cognitive, and interpersonal skills to manage health in partnership with professionals; and (3) critical health literacy--ability to analyze information critically, increase awareness, and participate in action to address barriers. Research documenting links between levels of education and health outcomes (Hammond 2002; Wilson 2001) suggests that people with higher educational attainment may have a health advantage. However, health literacy is not identical to general literacy (Davis et al. 2002). Health literacy issues that go beyond basic skills include (1) health information communication; (2) literacy and health as cultural and social practices; (3) the relationship among health information, literacy, and behavior; and (4) the impact of the Internet on the use of health information.

 urlLink Intergenerational Learning and Social Capital. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Sandra Kerka. From the ERIC Digest: The elder cannot be an elder if there is no community to make him an elder. The young child cannot feel secure if there is no elder, whose silent presence gives him or her hope in life. The adult cannot be who he or she is unless there is a strong sense of the other people around. (M. P. Some, Ritual Power, Healing, and Community. Portland, OR: Swan/Raven & Co., 1993, p. 2) Knowledge has been transmitted from one generation to another throughout history, often informally or incidentally. In the last 40 years, more systematic and formal intergenerational programs have arisen, with growing recognition of their integral relationship to lifelong learning and broader social purposes (Hanks and Icenogle 2001). Ideally, the generations derive mutual benefits from participation and the learning is reciprocal. Features of effective intergenerational learning have commonalities with the characteristics of social capital. This Digest examines the relationship between intergenerational learning and social capital and describes research findings and promising programs illustrating how intergenerational programs contribute to learning and the development of social capital.

 urlLink Open Questions in Mathematics Education. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest was written by Britton, Edward - Raizen, Senta - Kaser, Joyce - Porter, Andrew. From the ERIC Digest: The "No Child Left Behind Act" signed into law on January 8, 2002, places strong emphasis on state accountability for educational results and use of teaching methods that have been proven to work [see http://nclb.gov/next/overview/]. For teachers, these expectations highlight the importance of attending to issues of equity and diversity in mathematics classrooms, and the need to critically examine the existing research base both for evidence of best practices and gaps in our understanding that constitute areas of needed research. Educators and researchers need to know a lot more about how to address the increasingly acute diversity and equity issues in educating today's and tomorrow's children in mathematics. Presented here are highlights and recommendations from a working forum (Britton, Raizen, Kaser, & Porter, 2000) where participants considered diversity and equity issues in mathematics and science education, with special emphasis on research directions for the future. Topics discussed at the forum covered a wide range of curricular and instructional equity issues in K-12 education, including the scaling up of successful programs. A number of clear research directions emerged from the forum.

 urlLink Open Questions in Science Education. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Anderson, Ronald D. and Helms, Jenifer V. From the ERIC Digest: The "No Child Left Behind Act" signed into law on January 8, 2002 places strong emphasis on state accountability for educational results and use of teaching methods that have been shown to work [see http://nclb.gov/next/overview/]. For science educators, these expectations underscore the need to fully implement the National Science Education Standards (National Research Council (NRC), 1996) by attending to the multifaceted conditions in schools in a holistic and systemic manner. The challenge for the research community is to identify the most critical aspects of the needed research, conduct the research, and provide the educational community with the research-based information needed to move forward with science education reform. There are significant gaps in our knowledge of the science education reform process, and the existing body of research highlights specific areas where additional understanding is of central importance to successful reform. WHAT WE KNOW A review of extant research (Anderson & Helms, 2001) provides the basis for the following generalizations about efforts to promote broad reform congruent with the vision of the "National Science Education Standards" (NRC, 1996): * The dramatic changes called for in the Standards are very difficult to put into full practice and where attempted generally fall short of the mark. * The difficulties of making the desired changes are highlighted by the many dilemmas teachers face in the process. Some of the dilemmas teachers experience (Anderson, 1995, 1996) relate to time constraints, tensions between the ideal and classroom realities, changing roles for students and teachers, overcoming traditional views of preparing students for the next level of schooling, and issues related to equity, such as tracking and ability grouping. * Fundamental reform requires significant changes in teachers' values and beliefs about science education practices. Though the relationship between teachers' beliefs about the nature of science and their views of schools and pedagogy is unclear, teachers' views of students in terms of ability, gender, and ethnic identity do seem related to their pedagogical decision making (Bianchini, Cavazos, & Helms, 1999). * Departments within schools are the most important setting for change, although most research addresses whole school change. * Substantial teacher collaboration in the work context--not just in inservice education--can be a powerful changing influence on teachers' values and beliefs. A significant barrier to substantive change comes from a lack of attention to the ways in which teachers come to hold certain beliefs, values, and assumptions with respect to students' roles, pedagogy, and the science curriculum. * Parents often resist reforms and they have a strong influence on science education reform efforts; without local parental support of the reform ideas and practices, their implementation fallsshort. * The recommended reforms demand new student roles and different student work. It is the "bottom line" of science education reform, and it is the area in which almost all reforms fall short, even when teachers have made substantial changes in their own roles and practice.

 urlLink Systems Theory and the Earth Systems Approach in Science Education. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Hyongyong Lee. From the ERIC Digest: During the past three decades, scientists, philosophers, and mathematicians have been working to construct a theoretical framework for unifying the many branches of the scientific enterprise for science education. The outcome of this effort, system theory, provides a framework for understanding both natural and human-constructed environments (Chen & Stroup, 1993). One example, the Earth system developed by the Earth System Sciences Committee (1988) provides Earth science educators with a conceptual approach to curriculum integration (Mayer, 1993). In this approach the Earth is regarded as a unified system of interacting components, including lithosphere, atmosphere, cryosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere (Earth System Sciences Committee, 1988). The general idea of "Earth systems" is used as a unifying theme of integrated science in over 30 states (Biological Science Curriculum Study, 2000) and has considerably influenced the restructuring of science curriculum and curriculum development. The Earth system concept is also being used by scientists to investigate the role that human activities play in global environmental change (Steffen & Tyson, 2001). SYSTEM THEORY As Blauberg, Sadovsky and Yudin (1977) observed, a German-Canadian biologist, Ludwig von Bertalanffy (1901-1972) was a creator of General System Theory (GST). His conceptual approach has had a wide impact on such diverse disciplines as biology, psychology, and economics, and his system theory is an attempt to formulate common laws that apply to every scientific field. Heylighen and Joslyn (2001) stated, Bertalanffy was both reacting against reductionism and attempting to revive the unity of science. He emphasized that real systems are open to, and interact with, their environments, and that they can acquire qualitatively new properties through emergence, resulting in continual evolution. Rather than reducing an entity (e.g., the human body) to the properties of its parts or elements (e.g., organs or cells), systems theory focuses on the arrangement of and relations between the parts which connect them into a whole (cf. holism). This particular organization determines a system, which is independent of the concrete substance of the elements (e.g., particles, cells, transistors, people, etc). Thus, the same concepts and principles of organization underlie the different disciplines (physics, biology, technology, sociology, etc.), providing a basis for their unification. (p. 1) In Bertalanffy's outline of the major aims of general system theory, we can find the implications for education (Chen & Stroup, 1993). His system theory provides a basis and unifying focus for integrated science education. His list of the major aims includes: * There is a general tendency towards integration in the various sciences, natural and social. * Such integration seems to be centered in a general theory of systems.

 urlLink Teaching about the Life and Health of Cells. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by David L. Haury. From the ERIC Digest: The cell is "the ultimate irreducible form of every living element, and...from it emanate all the activities of life both in health and in sickness." Rudolph Ludwig Carl Virchow (1858, translated 1860) We've learned a lot about living cells since Robert Hooke (1665) viewed cork through a crude microscope and likened the hollow chambers to the cells of a monastery. Now we know that living cells are dynamic micro-environments, complete with microtubule transport networks and protein motors (see urlLink http://www.hhmi.org/news/vale.html ). With the development of cell theory in 1839 (Mazzarello, 1999), Biology became a theoretical science, and with the publication of "Die Cellularpathologie" (Virchow, 1858), modern clinical medicine gained a scientific foundation. Since then, good health came to be viewed as an outward expression of healthy cells, with disease arising from the cells of a tissue. Now, modern biotechnology is moving us along previously unimagined avenues to health that involve the use of undifferentiated cells (stem cells) in developing cell therapies, replacing diseased or dysfunctional cells with new, functioning cells. Biologists' understanding of cells has been greatly enriched in recent decades (Flannery, 1999). Though a long established field of study, cell biology has been transformed from the study of microscopic curiosities to a theory-based study of life itself, and now to a powerful new tool for creating health by marshalling the body's own life forces. It seems time for the study of cells in school biology to become transformed as well.

 urlLink Learning Science through Design. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by David L. Haury. From the ERIC Digest: Mention of "hands-on" or experiential learning and skill development in science education generally brings to mind the emphasis on inquiry in current reform efforts. Inquiry has been a major focus in science education for three decades (Haury, 1993), but it is only one component of the active learning in science endorsed by national science curriculum standards (National Research Council, NRC, 1996). Actively engaging students in technological design is the complementary strand that has received much less attention. The lack of attention to learning science through design is unfortunate since this neglected counterpoint to inquiry has the potential to profoundly enrich science teaching. The neglect is also ironic, since the underlying concept is as ancient as humanity itself. Teaching anything through design taps into the most basic of human tendencies: designing procedures and artifacts--using "tools"--to meet environmental challenges, accomplish difficult tasks, reach goals, increase personal and collective well-being, and generally enrich life. Using technology to meet the challenges of life is a characteristically human endeavor that predates science by thousands of years. Sadly, technology as a subject has been largely ignored in U. S. schools (Project 2061, 1993) and "has no fixed place in elementary education, is absent...in the college preparatory curriculum, and does not constitute part of the content in science courses at any level" (p. 41). Teaching science through design formally engages students in this basic human approach to meeting life's challenges, and in the process addresses several longstanding issues in science education, including the following: * Integrating the sciences with other subject areas in the arts, humanities, and social studies. * Forging connections to daily life. * Facilitating active learning. * Accommodating a variety of student learning styles. * Attending to science in the context of technology and society. * Nurturing imagination and creative thinking. * Developing skills in critical thinking, problem solving, and decision making. * Increasing awareness of science-related dimensions in occupations and avocations. Further, Alexander (Foreword to Davis, Hawley, McMullan, & Spilka, 1997) has pointed out that, "Whether the objective is a product, a building, a city plan, or a graphic communication, when children are engaged in the process of designing, they are learning to identify needs, frame problems, work collaboratively, explore and appreciate the context within which a solution must work, weigh alternatives, and communicate their ideas verbally, graphically, and in three dimensions." In short, learning through design engages students in activities fundamental to a satisfying and productive life in the desig7ned environment of our culture.

 urlLink Teaching Democracy. ERIC Digest. : This ERIC Digest is by John J. Patrick. From the ERIC Digest: During the past 30 years, there has been a global surge of democracy. For most people of the world today democracy is the prevailing source of political legitimacy. This ERIC Digest discusses (1) the status of democracy in the world, (2) a globally applicable conception of democracy, (3) components of education for democracy, and (4) recommendations on how to teach democracy. THE GLOBAL STATUS OF DEMOCRACY There is a broad international agreement today on a minimal or threshold standard by which to judge whether or not a regime is a democracy. This minimal criterion is the regular occurrence of free, open, fair, and contested elections by which an inclusive citizenry selects its representatives in government. Thus, there is government by consent of the governed in which the people's representatives are accountable to the people (Huntington 1991, 7; Karatnycky 2002, 722). In 2002, 121 of the world's 192 sovereign states could be recognized as democracies in terms of the minimal global standard for an electoral democracy. The collective populations of these electoral democracies accounted for 64.6% of the world's population (Karatnycky 2002,7). By contrast, in 1900 there was not even one country in the world that met today's minimal global standard for democracy. In 1950, there were only 22 authentic democracies comprising 14.3% of the world's population. By the end of the twentieth century, however, there was a dramatic global trend toward electoral democracy as communist regimes and other types of autocratic or authoritarian systems withered and died (Karatnycky 2002).

 urlLink Teaching about the Louisiana Purchase. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by John J. Patrick. From the ERIC Digest: The year 2003 marks the bicentennial of the 1803 Treaty of France, by which the United States of America acquired the Louisiana Territory, an area of more than 828,000 square miles. Upon this acquisition, known as the Louisiana Purchase, the territory of the United States doubled. Historians consider the Louisiana Purchase to be a landmark event or turning point in American history. This Digest discusses (1) President Jefferson's decision to purchase the Louisiana Territory, (2) the significant consequences of this decision in American history, and (3) methods of teaching about the Louisiana Purchase. THE DECISION TO PURCHASE LOUISIANA. President Thomas Jefferson faced an important decision during the summer of 1803. Napoleon, the emperor of France, had offered to sell the territory of Louisiana to the United States for $15 million. This vast territory extended westward from the Mississippi River to the Rocky Mountains and southward from the Canadian border to the Gulf of Mexico and the Spanish lands of what is now Texas and New Mexico. Jefferson had offered to buy for $2 million only the region around the mouth of the Mississippi River, which included the port and city of New Orleans. The President wanted to protect the interests of farmers in the Ohio River Valley, who depended on access to New Orleans. They sent their crops down the Mississippi River to New Orleans, from which ships took the products to cities along the Atlantic coast of the United States. Americans feared that the French might interfere with their trade by imposing high taxes on products and ships moving through New Orleans. Even worse, the French might close the port to Americans. President Jefferson was astonished by Napoleon's offer to sell not only the region around New Orleans, but also the entire Louisiana Territory. Although the total purchase price seemed high, it was not beyond the means of the United States to pay it.

 urlLink State Standards for Civic Education. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by John J. Patrick. From the ERIC Digest: A significant new report, Educating Democracy: State Standards to Ensure A Civic Core, has been issued by the Albert Shanker Institute of the American Federation of Teachers. This document comparatively analyzes and evaluates the standards for the teaching and learning of civics which state-level departments of education in the United States have developed. This Digest addresses (1) the purposes and rationale for this inquiry about state standards for civic education, (2) the criteria that guided the inquiry, (3) the findings of the inquiry, and (4) suggestions for improving civic education. PURPOSES AND RATIONALE. Forty-eight states and the District of Columbia have developed standards for civic education (Iowa and Rhode Island do not have statewide standards). These standards represent priorities in teaching and learning. They indicate what each state department of education wants students to know and be able to do in civics. Are these state standards likely to enhance the civic education of students? The purpose of the state-by-state analysis of standards in civic education was to answer this question. The main reason for undertaking this comparative study of state standards is the fundamental importance of civic education in a constitutional democratic republic, such as the United States of America. From the founding of the republic until today, a primary purpose of education in schools has been to teach knowledge, skills, and dispositions needed by citizens to maintain and improve government of, by, and for the people. Do the state standards seem likely to contribute positively to education for competent citizenship in a democracy? If not, how can they be improved?

 urlLink Back to the Agora: Workable Solutions for Small Urban School Facilities. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Barbara Kent Lawrence. From the ERIC Digest: Two preconceptions make providing facilities for small schools a challenge: that they will be more expensive per student than facilities for large schools, and that teaching and learning must occur in isolation from the community. Yet Socrates taught in the "agora," an open market in ancient Athens, which, like the Roman "forum," functioned as a marketplace for ideas and commerce. For students and teachers it offered an ideal place in which to learn and teach. This Digest suggests adapting such a model to meet modern needs, and shows that there are successful small schools that have already done so while reducing costs. Several successful and innovative small urban schools (discussed below) have created places that are the modern equivalent of the agora, places where students and adults can interact with the community, share resources, and learn from each other. Such school designs can be "courageously evolutionary--not just astoundingly revolutionary" (Bergsagel, 2002, p. 1). In a foresighted report, researchers DeArmond, Taggart, and Hill (2002, p. 5) identified five trends of education that should guide decisions about facilities: "pressure on schools to perform for all students, . . . demands for the personalization of learning, new technologies, periodic shortages of teachers, and shifts in student population and residency patterns." These pressures may require that school facilities be reconfigured in creative and innovative ways. DeArmond et al. suggest that "facilities should focus on students' learning and achievement . . . be flexible . . . be responsive . . . trade-offs and choices should be transparent . . . provisions should be driven by data, and facilities should be economically efficient" (DeArmond et al., p. 13). How can the ideas of the ancient Greeks and modern researchers in education apply to school facilities?

 urlLink Inducting School Leaders. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Larry Lashway. From the site: If experienced principals find their jobs to be exhausting and stressful-and most surveys indicate they do-then what is it like for newcomers? Not surprisingly, words such as "lost," "overwhelmed," and "shell-shocked" pervade the literature on first-year principals. Traditionally, rookie principals have been left to sink or swim. Having completed a university training program, they are presumed to be prepared, and get little direction beyond bland encouragement or an occasional practical tip. But that attitude is changing as schools realize that a scarcity of high-quality principals means promising leaders should not only be energetically recruited but carefully nurtured once they're on board. Formal induction programs are too new to have generated a significant body of empirical research, but there is a growing literature that articulates a rationale for such programs, describes the efforts of districts to nurture new leaders, and provides early testimony that induction efforts are well-received. This Digest examines the challenges faced by new administrators and the steps that districts can take to provide a smooth entry into the principalship.

 urlLink Employment of People with Disabilities. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Michael E. Wonacott. From the ERIC Digest: Successful employment remains a critical issue for people with disabilities, although legislative mandates and a gradual change in attitudes across our culture have brought about some improvement. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 has clarified the legal rights of both individuals with disabilities and employers; at the same time, however, both groups still face important issues in employment, such as the disclosure of disabilities and the provision of reasonable workplace accommodations. Likewise, successful employment experiences require a match between the skills of individuals with disabilities and the skills needed for jobs. THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT Federal legislation addressing people with disabilities began with the National Civilian Vocational Rehabilitation Act of 1920. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 prohibited discrimination and mandated accommodations in multiple dimensions of the lives of people with disabilities (Hotchkiss 2003). ADA holds all companies with 15 or more employees to a single standard in the employment and accommodation of workers with disabilities (Schall 1998). A "triple standard" of qualification under ADA is intended to balance the interests of both individuals and employers: whether the individual can perform (1) the ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS of the job with (2) a REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION and without causing (3) UNDUE HARDSHIP to the employer. The ADA defines terms as follows (Latham and Latham 1997): * Disability: physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of the individual * Qualified Individual with a Disability: person who meets legitimate skill, experience, education, or other requirements of an employment position held or sought and who can perform the position's essential functions with or without reasonable accommodation * Reasonable Accommodation: any modification or adjustment to the work environment or job that will enable a qualified job seeker or job holder with a disability to apply or to perform essential functions; includes adjustments to ensure a qualified individual has equal rights and privileges * Essential Function: a function that is necessary for the performance of the job * Nonessential Function: a function that may be marginal, modified, eliminated, transferred, or reassigned Under ADA, individuals are considered disabled if they have a disability, have a record of impairment, or are regarded as having an impairment. Major life activities are things an average person can do with little or no problem (e.g., walking, speaking, working, learning). Covered employment practices include recruitment, hiring, training, pay, benefits, promotions, leave, job layoffs, and firing.

 urlLink Youth in Adult Basic and Literacy Education Programs. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Susan Imel. From the ERIC Digest: Wherever adult educators gather, whether at conferences, meetings, or in e-mail discussion groups, a topic on many minds is the challenge of increasing numbers of teenagers enrolled in adult education classes. (Smith 2002, p. 1). The increase in the number of youth under the age of 18 enrolling in federally funded adult basic and literacy education programs is a trend that is putting increasing pressures on programs designed to serve an adult population (Hayes 2000). A number of questions and issues surround this trend and administrators and teachers view it from different perspectives (ibid.; Smith 2002). After reviewing some of the trends and factors that are contributing to an increase in youth enrollment, this Digest provides an overview of how programs are responding to the challenge of serving young adults.

 urlLink Working With Young English Language Learners: Some Considerations. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Bronwyn Coltrane. From the site: In today’s preschool programs and primary school classrooms, teachers are working with an increasingly diverse population of young students, including many who come from homes where English is not spoken. According to Kindler (2002), English language learners (ELLs) now represent 9.6% of all students enrolled in public pre-kindergarten through Grade 12 classes in the United States; 67% of these students are enrolled at the elementary school level. The growth in enrollment of English language learners is not restricted to big cities and urban areas; in fact, states with large rural areas, such as Georgia, Montana, and Mississippi, have experienced sharp increases in the enrollment of ELLs in their public schools. Teachers in preschool and primary education programs all over the country may have English language learners in their classrooms. Unfortunately, many teachers are not provided with specialized training in how to meet the needs of ELLs (Menken & Atunez, 2001) and may have no prior experience in teaching young students from linguistically and culturally diverse backgrounds. This Digest provides general information on the characteristics of English language learners in U.S. preschool and primary school programs and describes learning conditions and instructional practices that are most effective for educating young ELLs.

 urlLink Reducing Error in Mail Surveys. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Wei Wei Cui. From the ERIC Digest: Surveys allow information to be collected from a sample group and generalized to the population at large. Because they are low cost and easy to implement, mail surveys are used more frequently for social research than either telephone or face-to-face interviews. Those conducting surveys should recognize four potential sources of error -- sampling error, non-coverage error, non-response error, and measurement error -- and take steps to minimize their impact. Any one of these sources of error may make the survey results unacceptable (Groves, 1989; Salant and Dillman, 1994; Dillman, 1991, 1999). This article describes the four types of errors and summarizes ways they can be reduced. Sampling Error Mail surveys, like all surveys, collect information only from the people who are included in the sample. Because certain members of the population are deliberately excluded through selection of the sample, their responses are not obtained. Conclusions about the population at large are thus drawn from sample survey results. The heterogeneity of the survey measures among members of the population (in other words, the degree to which it does not represent the general population) will cause the so-called sampling error.

 urlLink Teaching Decision Making to Students with Learning Disabilities by Promoting Self-Determination. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Alan Hoffman. From the ERIC Digest: The ability to make effective choices and decisions is one of the most important competencies students, including those with learning disabilities, need to be successful in life after high school. Promoting student self-determination provides an excellent framework within which to teach students how to make effective choices and decisions. Effective choices are those that the student will see as beneficial, and these models of self-determination can be used to teach students to make choices and decisions that (a) are consistent with what is most important to them and (b) enable them to achieve more positive adult outcomes. A general overview of best practices in promoting and enhancing self-determination can be found in a previous ERIC digest (Wehmeyer, 2002). This digest specifically examines how instructional practices to promote self-determination can be used to help students with learning disabilities make effective choices and decisions. How is self-determination linked to learning how to make good choices and decisions? Self-determination is "a combination of skills, knowledge, and beliefs that enable a person to engage in goal-directed, self-regulated, autonomous behavior. An understanding of one's strengths and limitations together with a belief in oneself as capable and effective are essential to self-determination. When acting on the basis of these skills and attitudes, individuals have greater ability to take control of their lives and assume the role of successful adults in our society" (Field, Martin, Miller, Ward, & Wehmeyer, 1998, p.2). Thus, self-determination involves assessing one's own strengths, weaknesses, needs, and preferences. Field and Hoffman (1994) describe five steps to enhanced self-determination. The five steps are: - Know yourself - Value yourself - Plan - Act - Experience outcomes and learn. Making choices and decisions is central to each of the five steps. For example, one sub-component of the step "Plan" is to set goals. To set a goal, a decision must be made. A sub-component of "Know Yourself" is to decide what is important to you. A key goal of instruction to promote self-determination is to enable students to make choices and decisions based on a foundation of knowing about and valuing themselves (Field & Hoffman, 1994). If we support students in becoming more self-determined, we are, in essence, enabling them to learn how to make choices and decisions that are based on what they most value.

 urlLink Civic Education Trends in Post-Communist Countries of Central and Eastern Europe. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Gregory E. Hamot. From the ERIC Digest: Developments during the decade-and-a-half following the fall of communism in Central and Eastern Europe indicate broad advancement in civic education for democracy. This ERIC Digest notes the rising trend in civic education competency in Central and Eastern Europe, describes an increasingly accepted and used framework for civic education, and illustrates this broad advancement through three significant trends in collaborative projects that contribute to civic education in Central and Eastern Europe. A TREND TOWARD CIVIC COMPETENCY The recent International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) study of civic knowledge in 28 countries reveals some startling conclusions. According to national results, the most successful programs for democratic citizenship education exist in Poland, the United States, and the Czech Republic (Torney-Purta et al. 2001). Given this finding, one may conclude that collaborative efforts conducted with western democracies, particularly the United States, contributed on some level to the abilities of teachers and students in Poland, the Czech Republic, and many other countries where such collaborations exist, to achieve the highest levels of civic competence. TREND TOWARD A COMMON EDUCATION FOR DEMOCRATIC CITIZENSHIP John Patrick, through myriad experiences with projects in Central and Eastern Europe and his lifelong study of the teaching and learning of democratic citizenship in the U.S., has developed a civic education framework (Patrick 2003). This framework appeals so widely to civic education reformers that the American Council for International Education requires that all civic education programs funded by their international Partners in Education program include a balanced assortment of themes from this framework. At the heart of Patrick's framework lie four key components of a common democratic citizenship education and an elaboration on democracy's core concepts (2003). First, the four key components include civic knowledge, cognitive civic skills, participatory civic skills, and civic dispositions.

 urlLink Teaching History for Citizenship in the Elementary School. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by John D. Hoge. From the ERIC Digest: Over the past two decades, educators identified national curriculum standards for all subject areas and the development of history instruction standards took center stage in the effort to strengthen K-12 social studies instruction. The Center for History in the Schools' (1996) standards begin with a statement on the importance of teaching history for the development of citizenship, a theme that dominates all of their widely circulated and often emulated curriculum documents. In addition, the National Standards for Civics and Government (1994) refer to history as a means of educating America's youth for their future demanding roles as citizens of a modern democracy. Key scholars such as R. Freeman Butts and Paul Gagnon also have stressed the importance of powerfully taught history as an essential subject in the schools of any nation that wishes to be called and to remain a democracy. CONNECTING RESEARCH AND CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT A common theme running through these organizations' and experts' authoritative endorsements is that teachers need to do more than simply transmit factual knowledge about the past. Powerful history instruction involves helping students (a) acquire a meaningful understanding of key historical themes and important people and events from local, state, and national history, (b) build experience-based knowledge of the methods and limitations of history, and (c) confront multiple perspectives -- including mainstream interpretations -- of the past. These may be thought of as the fundamentals of good history instruction. Furthermore, while employing the fundamentals of good history instruction, teachers must offer students substantial and recurring opportunities to think analytically about a variety of democratic values, principles, issues, and tensions, using historical referents as a basis for such lessons. This type of history learning requires more than mere exposure and memorization, it demands active manipulation of the concepts through learning mechanisms such as dramatization activities (e.g., role playing an interview with a famous American, acting in skits or plays that recreate famous events); advocacy activities (e.g., making posters that use historical precedents as support for positions on contemporary issues, writing letters about community needs to public officials); community service projects (e.g., helping to restore the condition of a local monument, using oral history techniques to create a school history) and issues-oriented discussions (e.g., were the courts right in declaring separate public schools for black and white children to be illegal?).

 urlLink The Status of Teacher Education in Community Colleges. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Nathan R. Durdella. From the site: The United States is in the midst of a teacher shortage. By 2010, the United States will need between 2 and 2.5 million more elementary and secondary school teachers to enter the classroom and assume the challenges in public schools (Townsend and Ignash, 2003). While 4-year colleges and universities continue to offer comprehensive teacher preparation programs, community colleges have expanded their programs in the field of teacher education in recent years to provide additional options for teacher training. In addition to offering the first two years of requirements for a baccalaureate degree, community colleges have added coordinated programs for transfer, added new certificate and associate degree programs, and augmented support services, all of which have increased student access to and completion of teacher preparation programs. This ERIC Digest, drawn from “The Role of the Community College in Teacher Education” (New Directions for Community Colleges, Spring 2003), examines trends in teacher education in the community colleges, including building partnerships and articulation agreements with baccalaureate-granting institutions, designing new associate degree and community college baccalaureate degree programs, and gaining accreditation. Building Partnerships and Articulation Agreements Building partnerships with 4-year colleges and universities has become central to community colleges’ efforts in teacher education. In fulfilling one of their missions as the first two years of a baccalaureate degree program, community colleges have worked to close the gaps in transfer curriculum for teacher education. Townsend and Ignash (2003) document how a growing number of community colleges offer more options to 4-year college and university teacher education programs because of their location, accessibility, affordability, and open admissions policy. They report that officials in a number of states seem to understand these advantages and are coordinating policies to encourage articulation among community colleges and 4-year colleges and universities to which community college students transfer.

 urlLink The Connection Between Civic and Economic Education. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Margaret Stimmann Branson. From the ERIC Digest: There is a necessary connection between civics and economics in education for democracy. This connection should be reflected in the curricula in schools. This ERIC Digest discusses (1) federal legislation and programs promoting civics and economics, (2) the connections between civics and economics in the study of the Constitution, (3) the status of economic education in the schools, and (4) recommendations for strengthening the connection between civics and economics in the school curriculum. FEDERAL LEGISLATION AND PROGRAMS IN SUPPORT OF CIVICS AND ECONOMICS IN THE CORE CURRICULUM OF SCHOOLS Two pieces of recent legislation by the United States Congress have spurred the study of civics and economics: "The Goals 2000: Educate America Act," passed in 1994, and the "No Child Left Behind Act of 2001." One of the most important goals set forth in the Educate America Act is that "all students will leave grades 4, 8 and 12 having demonstrated competency over challenging subject matter including civics and government and economics so that they may be prepared for responsible citizenship, further learning, and productive employment." To specify the nature of that "challenging subject matter," professional organizations have developed content standards. Content standards are explicit statements of what students should know and be able to do by the time they complete grades 4, 8 and 12. Content standards indicate the ways of thinking, working, communicating, reasoning, and investigating and delineate the most important and enduring ideas, concepts, issues, dilemmas, and knowledge essential to the disciplines that should be taught and learned in school. The "National Standards for Civics and Government" were developed over two years by the Center for Civic Education with support from the federal government and the Pew Charitable Trusts. State-level departments of education have made use of the national civics standards by adopting, adapting, and modifying them to meet their own needs.

 urlLink New Approaches to Truancy Prevention in Urban Schools. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Charles Walls. From the ERIC Digest: In New York City alone, it has been estimated that 150,000 of 1 million public school students are absent on a typical schoolday (Garry, 1996). Although the exact number is unknown, many of these absences are the result of truancy. No universal definition for truancy exists, but it is generally defined as a locally-determined number of absences from school without a legitimate excuse. Truancy is generally considered a major risk factor for dropping out of school and for delinquent behavior, including substance abuse, gang involvement, and criminal activity; these often lead to more serious problems in adult life. This digest will explore truancy in the urban context, examine the different types and reasons for truancy, and provide an overview of the new ways in which researchers and intervention programs have been addressing this problem. The Urban and Minority Context No national data on truancy rates exists, but many large cities report staggeringly high rates of truancy (Baker, Sigman, & Nugent, 2001); in general, larger schools have higher rates of truancy (Puzzanchera, Stahl, Finnegan, Tierney, & Snyder, 2003). The relationship between race and truancy is not well established, but the truancy data collected by the juvenile court system reveal that whites are underrepresented in petitioned truancy cases (Bell, Rosen, & Dynlacht, 1994; Puzzanchera et al., 2003). Students with the highest truancy rates are at higher risk of dropping out of school (Baker et al., 2001), and African Americans and Latinos consistently have the highest dropout rates (Kaufman, Alt, & Chapman, 2001). The relationship between income and truancy is also not well established, but it is generally believed that students from lower income families have higher rates of truancy (Bell et al., 1994). The number of truancy cases is evenly divided between boys and girls, and the peak age for petitioned truancy cases is fifteen (Puzzanchera etal., 2003).

 urlLink Hispanics in College: Participation and Degree Attainment. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Richard Fry. From the ERIC Digest: Latinos lag every other major population group in attaining college degrees, especially bachelor’s degrees (Vernez & Mizell,2002). This partly reflects the difficulties Hispanic youth have in completing high school and the influx of adult less-educated Latino immigrants, but the outcomes of Latinos in postsecondary education require attention as well. Large numbers of Latinos are enrolled in postsecondary education. In fact, by some measures, a greater share of Hispanics is attending college than non-Hispanic whites. However, most Latino undergraduates are pursuing paths associated with lower chances of attaining a bachelor’s degree. Many are enrolled in community colleges, many also only attend school part-time, and others delay or prolong their college education into their mid-20s and beyond. Given the relatively high college enrollment rates of Latino high school completers, improvements in the college persistence rates of Latino youth would greatly increase the number of highly educated Latinos and their participation in graduate and professional education. This digest examines the extent and nature of Hispanic college enrollment in comparison to that of other racial and ethnic groups. College Entry and Participation Hispanic youth that complete U.S. secondary education do not markedly lag similar white youth in obtaining post-secondary education. By age 26, Latino high school completers are as likely as white high school completers to obtain some post-secondary education (NCES, 2002a). However, the timing of entry into post-secondary education is consequential to degree completion, and immediate entry into college may have a positive impact on college completion. Seventy-one percent of Latino high school graduates immediately enter postsecondary education, in comparison to 76 percent of white high school graduates (NCES, 1997).

 urlLink Labor Market Outcomes of Hispanics by Generation. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Richard Fry. From the ERIC Digest: The Latino population is on the cusp of a major generational change. For the past several decades its growth was fueled mostly by immigration. Now, the extraordinary fertility rate of foreign-born Latinos living in the United States is fueling Hispanic population growth at a faster rate than the influx of new immigrants. The Hispanic population and labor force is increasingly native-born (U.S. Census Bureau, 2001). The different Latino generations, i.e., immigrants and their U.S.-born offspring, play markedly different roles in the labor force, and they present dissimilar challenges and opportunities to employers and policy-makers. This digest summarizes the outcomes and determinants of Latinos in the workforce, with an emphasis on outcomes by generation. Underlying Demographics U.S. labor market outcomes vary significantly according to the age of the worker. Earnings rise and employment stabilizes with experience. So, for example, teen unemployment rates are often multiples of the rates experienced by middle-aged adults.When it comes to Hispanics, labor market analysis must recognize the unique age structure of Latino generations. Working-age Latino immigrants tend to be mature adults; about 1 in 10 is between the ages of 16 and 24. By contrast, 4 in 10 working-ages econd generation Latinos are between the critical ages of 16and 24, reflecting the native-born youth boom. Age sensitive labor market analysis reveals that the fortunes of this second generation of Latinos appear very different, depending upon whether we investigate outcomes for youth or focus on adults over the age of 25 (Fry & Lowell, 2002).

 urlLink Raising Minority Academic Achievement: The Department of Defense Model. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Bridglall, Beatrice L. and Gordon, Edmund W. From the ERIC Digest: The U.S. Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA), a civilian agency of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), operates two separate but parallel education systems: the Department of Defense Dependent Schools (DoDDS) for children of personnel stationed in Europe and the Pacific, and the Department of Defense Domestic Dependent Elementary and Secondary Schools (DDESS) for children living on bases in the U.S. According to the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), a national, ongoing assessment of student performance, the average academic performance of all students in DoDEA schools is high, and the performance of African American and Hispanic students is among the highest in the nation. Based on this evidence of success and the fact that DoDEA schools share some of the same characteristics of many of the nation’s public schools, a research group at Vanderbilt University examined the high achievement of African American and Hispanic students in DoDEA schools. This digest will summarize the results of their study, March toward Excellence: School Success and Minority Student Achievement in Department of Defense Schools (Smrekar, Guthrie, Owens, & Sims,2001), along with supporting research identifying policies and practices that may contribute to the success of DoDEA schools.

 urlLink No Child Left Behind: Testing, Reporting, and Accountability. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by a gaggle of people including Wenning, Richard; Herdman, Paul A.; Smith, Nelson; McMahon, Neal; and Washington, Kadesha. From the ERIC Digest: In a major expansion of the federal role in education, the NoChild Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) requires annual testing, specifies a method for judging school effectiveness, sets a timeline forprogress, and establishes specific consequences in the case of failure. As the use of standardized testing to measure school accountability has expanded, so has the list of arguments for excusing the low achievement of whole categories of students. While special education law provides for testing with “accommodations,” in practice it has pushed educators to focus more on procedural compliance. The achievement of language-minority students has often been overlooked or mismeasured as school districts lacked the skill or will to administer appropriate assessments. This digest reviews how testing and reporting requirements will operate with respect to different groups of students and examines factors that could delay or dilute the guarantee of educational accountability in the academic achievement of all children.

 urlLink Applications of Participatory Action Research with Students who Have Disabilities. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Cynthia Warger and Jane Burnette. From the ERIC Digest: Participatory action research is an approach in which researchers and stakeholders (those individuals who might benefit from the research findings) collaboratively engage in the various stages of the research process. Participatory action research provides for greater influence of stakeholders in the research process and a higher level of support for the implementation of research findings in practice. This digest offers several examples of how researchers and practitioners are using participatory action research data to select effective practices and support change and innovation. The following sections illustrate applications of participatory action research in related services for young children, inclusion in elementary schools, working with families, and transition to adulthood. Generating Data-based Strategies in Natural Environments It is important for related service providers to validate what they do in their daily practice to ensure that their services improve the quality of life for children and their families. Participatory action research can help therapists explore questions about the efficacy of therapy practices within a child's and family's natural environments. A study in progress at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia pairs therapists with research mentors to conduct individualized research. Occupational and physical therapists implement small-scale research studies with a child and/or family who are part of their caseload. To support the research process, the research mentor provides guidance on formulating research questions, conducting the study, interpreting the results, and preparing a presentation on results. The therapists volunteer to receive training related to best practices in natural environments, data collection, and other aspects of research investigations. The nature and type of data to be collected depends upon decisions made by each therapist/mentor team. Much of the data and documentation required for this type of participatory action research may already part of the child's individualized family services plan (IFSP). According to Phillipa Campbell, the study's director, these collaborative research teams work because there is ongoing contact between the mentors and therapists. Mentors need to be present at all stages of the research, and they must feel comfortable sharing their expertise and skills as part of the research process.

 urlLink Helping Students with Disabilities Succeed in State and District Writing Assessments. ERIC/OSEP Digest. : This ERIC Digest is by Cynthia Warger. From the ERIC Digest: While writing poses significant challenges for many students with disabilities, good teaching can help them overcome these barriers. The writing of students with disabilities typically contains more mechanical errors than that of their nondisabled peers and is less polished, expansive, coherent, and effective. Difficulties may exist because students with disabilities tend to: * Know less than their peers about the characteristics of good writing. * Begin writing with little or no planning. * Limit revisions to minor corrections. * Have problems with transcription processes (e.g., spelling, handwriting, punctuation). To help students with disabilities perform at their best on writing assessments, teachers can use the following techniques: * Use the three principles of effective writing instruction. * Prepare students to participate in writing assessments. * Use assistive technology in instruction and testing. * Provide students with appropriate accommodations during testing and ensure that the accommodations correspond to those used during instruction.

 urlLink Assistive Technology for Students with Mild Disabilities: Update 2002. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Behrmann, Michael and Jerome, Marci Kinas. From the site: Technology has become ubiquitous as a tool for teachers and students. P.L. 100-407, The Technology-Related Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities Act of 1988 (Tech Act) was designed to enhance the availability and quality of assistive technology (AT) devices and services to all individuals and their families throughout the United States. Public Law 105-17, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), uses the same definitions for assistive technology as the Tech Act and mandates that assistive technology be considered in developing Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) for students with disabilities. IDEA also emphasizes access to the general education curriculum for all students with disabilities. The Tech Act and the IDEA define an AT device as any item, piece of equipment, or product system (whether acquired off the shelf, modified, or customized) that is used to increase, maintain, or improve the functional capabilities of a child with a disability. AT devices may be categorized as no technology, low technology, or high technology (LD Online, 2001). "No-technology" or "no-tech" refers to any assistive device that is not electronic. No-tech items range from a piece of foam glued onto the corners of book pages to make turning easier to a study carrel to reduce distraction. "Low-technology" or "low-tech" devices are electronic but do not include highly sophisticated computer components, such as an electronic voice-recording device or a "talking watch" (Behrmann & Schaff, 2001). "High-technology" or "high-tech" devices utilize complex, multifunction technology and usually include a computer and associated software.

 urlLink Preventing Bullying. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Linda Lumsden. From the ERIC Digest: School is supposed to be a place where students feel safe and secure and where they can count on being treated with respect. The reality, however, is that a significant number of students are the target of bullying episodes that result in serious, long-term academic, physical, and emotional consequences. Unfortunately, school personnel often minimize or underestimate the extent of bullying and the harm it can cause. In many cases, bullying is tolerated or ignored (Barone 1997; Colvin and others 1998). When teachers and administrators fail to intervene, some victims ultimately take things into their own hands, often with grievous results. In its recent analysis of 37 school shooting incidents, the U.S. Secret Service learned that a majority of the shooters had suffered "bullying and harassment that was longstanding and severe" (U.S. Secret Service National Threat Assessment Center 2000). This Digest examines the problem of bullying and some of its effects, discusses steps schools are taking, looks at ways peers can discourage bullying, and identifies other strategies that are being pursued.

 urlLink The Identification of Students Who Are Gifted. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Mary Ruth Coleman. From the ERIC Digest: Few areas in the education of children with exceptionalities are as controversial and critical as appropriate identification of children who are gifted. The controversies involve all the pros and cons of labeling children as well as a variety of political issues. Yet, identification remains critical to ensuring that children receive the services they need to thrive in school. This digest discusses the identification of students who are gifted, the difficulties in the identification process, appropriate identification practices, and procedures that can help with identification. Identification: A Means Not an End School systems often face difficult decisions when developing procedures for identification. The amount of money allotted to gifted education must include both identification and programming, while providing a balance between the two. School system administrators run the risk of using more energy, resources, and precision planning in the identification process than in the services provided once a student is identified. Some states even require identification but do not require the provision of services (Coleman & Gallagher, 1995). With limited funding, schools must make tradeoffs between using individual assessments of children and using good group measures. Ideally, information gleaned during identification would be used to guide curriculum and instruction for each child. In any case, identification must be the means to securing appropriate services to meet the needs of the student, not an end in itself.

 urlLink Adapting Language Arts, Social Studies, and Science Materials for the Inclusive Classroom. ERIC/OSEP Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Keith Lenz and Jean Schumaker. From the ERIC Digest: When instructional materials present a barrier to student learning, teachers often adapt the materials to allow students greater access to the information to be taught. These adaptations may involve changing the content of the materials (the nature or amount of information to be learned) or changing the format of the materials (the way information is presented to the learner). For students with mild cognitive disabilities, most adaptations should be a bridge to skill development, not a substitute for intensive instruction in the skills and strategies that students will need to become independent learners. In other words, adaptations should be approached as a short-term solution to increase access to the curriculum and to increase the probability that the students will be able to complete an academic task. However, there may be some cases in which short-term adaptations become permanent adaptations if they are needed by a particular student. Ideally, adaptations would be designed into curricular materials by the developers, and the built-in adaptations would be broad enough and flexible enough to assist students regardless of their disability. When they are not, teachers must adapt materials themselves, and effective adaptations take time for teachers to design and implement. In some cases, making and implementing adaptations can be more time consuming and complex than teaching the student the skills needed to meet a particular demand. A careful process can help to ensure that the decision to adapt materials is the correct one and that adaptations will be effective. This digest describes a process consisting of nine steps for planning and implementing materials adaptations.

 urlLink Afterschool Programs. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Linda Lumsden. From the ERIC Digest: According to Jodi Wilgoren of the New York Times (2000), recent growth in afterschool programming "represents nothing less than the reimagining of the school day for the first time in generations." Afterschool programs are increasingly viewed as one viable way of bridging the gap between the end of the school day and the time parents get home from work. They have the potential to provide a safe, supervised place for children and youth to participate in constructive activities and form positive relationships with peers and adults. Such programs may also supplement what children and youth learn during the regular school day and expose students to a wide array of enrichment opportunities that promote cognitive, social, emotional, physical, and moral growth and development. The caliber of afterschool programs varies widely, however, and so it is important for administrators and policy- makers to be familiar with factors that tend to set apart high-quality programs. Otherwise, millions of children may end up being "warehoused in inadequate programs" (Grossman 2002). This Digest briefly discusses why afterschool programs are needed, what potential benefits may be, what challenges may affect the viability of programs, what factors are identified with high-quality programs, and what policy issues need to be addressed.

 urlLink High School Biology Textbooks Do Not Meet National Standards. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by David L. Haury. From the ERIC Digest: Apparently bigger is not better when it comes to selecting biology textbooks. That is the conclusion of a recent study by Project 2061, the ongoing science and mathematics education reform effort of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS, 2000). Following the publication of guidelines for what scientifically literate students should know and be able to do (AAAS, 1989, 1993), Project 2061 began developing a curriculum-materials analysis process (Kulm, Roseman, & Treistman, 1999) to determine the degree to which science and mathematics textbooks are aligned with the National Science Education Standards established by the National Research Council (NRC, 1996), Benchmarks (AAAS, 1993) and other standards. Previous reports of the Project 2061 group have focused on science textbooks for the middle grades (Roseman, Kesidou, Stern, &amp; Caldwell, 1999), mathematics textbooks for the middle grades (AAAS, 1999), and algebra textbooks (Kulm, 2000) (Available online at www.project2061.org/newsinfo/ research/textbook/index.htm). All four studies found serious weaknesses in the science and mathematics textbooks evaluated, the most widely used science and mathematics textbooks in American schools. These are sobering findings given the extent to which teachers use textbooks to guide instruction and determine curriculum content (Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development, 1997). EVALUATION PROCESS Two independent teams of biology teachers, science curriculum specialists, and professors of science education evaluated each of ten leading biology textbooks and teacher guides. (AAAS, 2000) using a benchmarks-based process (Kulm & Roseman; 1999). For more details on the evaluation teams, see the description online at www.project2061.org/newsinfo/research/textbook/hsbio/about.htm. The evaluation process included both content analysis and instructional analysis.

 urlLink TIMSS: What Have We Learned about Math and Science Teaching? ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Greene, Beth D., Herman, Marlena and Haury, David L. From the ERIC Digest: The Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), conducted during the 1994-95 school year, has been used extensively to compare the mathematics and science achievement of students and the instructional practices of schools worldwide. TIMSS followed in the wake of other reports and documents (National Commission on Excellence in Education, 1983; National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 1989; 1995; American Association for the Advancement of science, 1989, 1993; Executive Office of the President, 1990) that have focused attention on the importance, conditions, and goals of science and mathematics education. In addition to providing data on the progress of U.S. students towards national goals, TIMSS has enabled comparisons of some U.S. educational practices to those of other countries. Tests were designed to reflect the mathematics and science curricular goals of several TIMSS countries, and students in both public and private schools were tested three levels: 9 years of age, 13 years of age, and those in their final year of secondary school. CRITICAL QUESTIONS In the U.S., the TIMSS data have been used to address five main questions: (1) How does student knowledge of mathematics and science in the U.S. compare to that of students in other nations? (2) How do science and mathematics curricula and expectations for student learning in the U.S. compare to those of other nations? (3) How does classroom instruction in the U.S. compare with that of other nations? (4) Do U. S. teachers receive as much support in their efforts to teach as do their counterparts in other nations? and (5) Are U. S. students as focused on their studies as their international counterparts? (USDOE, 1997, p. 4).

 urlLink Curriculum and Assessment in an Age of Computer Algebra Systems. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Michael Meagher. From the ERIC Digest: The use of Computer Algebra System (CAS) technology in the teaching of mathematics is entering a new and crucial stage. A considerable amount of work to date has focused on support of existing curriculum topics and existing curriculum models. Kutzler's seminal book on teaching and learning using DERIVE (1996) includes the phrase "here is an example of how CAS can be used to support an existing curriculum topic". Arguments for the use of CAS as an effective tool in supporting teaching and learning of mathematics are well established. Now comes the real work. Curriculum models and assessment of curriculums are the structures that schools and examining boards create to educate students. The two are deeply connected and the real work of CAS advocates is now to develop curriculum models in which the use of CAS is an integral part, not just of the practice of the curriculum, but, of the conception of the curriculum. A thorough examination of topics must be carried out to decide what really has to stay for conceptual reasons and what is still extant only because of tradition. A crucial part of this process is a demonstration of assessment using CAS. Unless instruments can be found to measure the achievement, or lack of achievement, of that learning which is possible through the use of CAS it is destined to remain as a prop occasionally brought out to support and bolster existing methods of teaching and learning.

 urlLink Poetry and Science Education. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Davi Walders. From the ERIC Digest: Poetry and science? Does this equation compute? Poets, many of whose works have been inspired by science, would certainly answer in the affirmative, including William Carolow Williams, a doctor who continued to make house calls while becoming one of America's major poets. On a smaller scale, I am a poet and former teacher who encourages the weaving of poetry into all areas of the curriculum, particularly into the sciences. As a collector of poems for many years, I have seen the power that the right poem read at the right moment can have. Paradox, creative thinking, attention to detail, discovery, humor--a good poem carries many of these elements so critical to scientific inquiry.

 urlLink Literacy and Learning in Science. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Richard Lowe. From the ERIC Digest: In our visually oriented age, science and technology education rely heavily on the use of pictures to present technical information. Today's students live in an information environment saturated with visual images, and educational materials are no exception. Because educational materials must compete for attention in this rich visual environment, all types of teaching resources from traditional textbooks to the latest educational technologies contain a wealth of pictorial representations. In science and technology education these pictures are very diverse, ranging from realistic drawings and photographs to highly abstract diagrams and graphs. The educational emphasis on pictures reflects the widespread use of technical pictures by practicing scientists and technologists across many different fields. The use of pictures to represent technical subject matter is not new. Ancient pictures from many different countries show that visual information has long been an important means of communicating ideas about our world and how it works. However in more recent times, there has been an explosion in the number of specialized types of graphics developed to represent scientific and technological information. These specialist representations can provide critical information about the state of our world that may have enormous social and economic implications for its peoples. For example, the science of meteorology relies heavily on traditional weather map diagrams as well as more modern remote sensing imaging techniques. Technological advances, particularly in computing, continually increase the range of imaging techniques that are available to the scientific community. The burgeoning use of pictorial representation has implications for science and technology education. The capacities to both understand and generate technical pictures are fundamental to scientific and technological literacy for students at many levels, from school to university. We could describe these capacities as a form of visual literacy that involves the "reading "and "writing "of technical pictures. It is just as important for students to develop this visual aspect of scientific and technological literacy as it is for them to develop the general literacy required to understand the specialized verbal and mathematical languages they encounter in science. Successful reading of a highly abstract scientific diagram requires very different skills from those required for reading ordinary pictures of everyday content such as photographs in a newspaper or illustrations in a shopping catalogue. This means it is essential that today's students develop the general visual literacy skills required for dealing with scientific graphics, but they must also learn about particular types of scientific pictures that actually form part of the content of a specific field of scientific or technological study.

 urlLink Action Research in Science Education. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Feldman, Allan and Capobianco, Brenda. From the ERIC Digest: This introduction to action research in science education includes examples of how action research has been used to improve teaching and learning, as well as suggested resources for those seeking to incorporate action research into their own practice of teaching or research. Many have attempted to define action research or categorize its many variants. For example, Noffke (1997) has studied personal, professional and political purposes of action research, while McKernan (1988) has focused on the ways that ideology shapes its design. Rearick and Feldman (1999) have studied other dimensions of action research, including purpose, theoretical orientation, and type of reflection used. Here we draw upon these and other reviews to define action research as "systematic inquiry by practitioners to improve teaching and learning." Our definition assumes that the products of the inquiry are made public, adding to the knowledge bases of teaching and learning, and open to critique by peers. ACTION RESEARCH IN SCIENCE EDUCATION Action research has been utilized in three domains of science education: teacher education and professional development; research on science learning; and curriculum development and implementation. In all cases teachers are in the role of researcher, either studying their own methods of instruction and assessment; examining the cognitive processes of learning; or participating in the process of curriculum research and development.

 urlLink The Role of Metacognition in Second Language Teaching and Learning. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Neil J. Anderson. From the ERIC Digest: During a National Public Radio broadcast in the United States in March 1999, a sixth grader explained what she was learning from playing the Stock Market Game, an activity designed to help children become familiar with how the stock market functions. She said, "This game makes me think how to think" (Prakash, 1999). What this statement reveals is that this young learner was beginning to understand the real key to learning; she was engaged in metacognition. Metacognition can be defined simply as thinking about thinking. Learners who are metacognitively aware know what to do when they don't know what to do; that is, they have strategies for finding out or figuring out what they need to do. The use of metacognitive strategies ignites one's thinking and can lead to more profound learning and improved performance, especially among learners who are struggling. Understanding and controlling cognitive processes may be one of the most essential skills that classroom teachers can help second language learners develop. It is important that they teach their students metacognitive skills in addition to cognitive skills. The distinctions between cognitive and metacognitive strategies are important, partly because they give some indication of which strategies are the most crucial in determining the effectiveness of learning. It seems that metacognitive strategies, that allow students to plan, control, and evaluate their learning, have the most central role to play in this respect, rather than those that merely maximize interaction and input--thus the ability to choose and evaluate one's strategies is of central importance. (Graham, 1997, pp. 42-43) Rather than focus students' attention solely on learning the language, second language teachers can help students learn to think about what happens during the language learning process, which will lead them to develop stronger learning skills.

 urlLink Youth Courts in Law-Related Education. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Paula A. Nessel. From the ERIC Digest: Youth courts, which comprise teen courts, peer juries, peer courts, student courts, and other courts wherein juveniles sentence juvenile respondents, have rapidly gained popularity. In 1991 there were over 50 youth courts in 14 states; by 2002, the number of youth courts grew to more than 850 in 46 states and the District of Columbia. This Digest discusses (1) types and functions of youth courts, (2) the relationship of youth courts to law-related education, (3) student courts in schools, (4) educational effects of youth courts, and (5) the National Youth Court Center. TYPES AND FUNCTIONS OF YOUTH COURTS. Youth courts involve juveniles in the sentencing of other juveniles, in either a school or a community setting. Young people usually serve as jurors and may also fill the roles of prosecuting attorney, defense attorney, judge, bailiff, or other officers of the court. Respondents usually are referred to a youth court for sentencing, not for a judgment of guilt or innocence. Many youth courts accept only first-time respondents who have committed relatively minor offenses such as theft, alcohol/drug offenses, vandalism, and disorderly conduct (Godwin 1998). Respondents voluntarily choose youth court, with parental approval, as an alternative to an existent sentencing agency or disciplinary office. Respondents who prefer legal representation or the regular court (or disciplinary system) can decline referral to youth courts.

 urlLink History Textbook Controversies in Japan. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Kathleen Woods Masalski. From the ERIC Digest: There is an ongoing controversy in Japan about textbook treatments of Japanese military actions during World War II. This Digest examines (1) the importance of history textbooks in schools in Japan and the United States; (2) the context of history textbook controversies in Japan; (3) the current issues and contending positions in the Japanese history textbook controversies; and (4) the lessons and implications of the textbook controversies in Japan for educators in the United States. THE IMPORTANCE OF HISTORY TEXTBOOKS IN JAPAN AND THE UNITED STATES. The controversy surrounding the adoption of middle school history textbooks in Japan raises this question: why are textbooks, history textbooks in particular, important enough to fight about? Textbooks are used pervasively in Japanese and American schools. They are the dominant instructional materials in most classrooms. Thus, the content of textbooks looms large in the teaching and learning of history and other core subjects of the curriculum. American historians Laura Hein and Mark Selden (2000, 3-4) tell us that "people fight over textbook content because education is so obviously about the future, reaches so deeply into society, and is directed by the state."

 urlLink Improving Student Achievement in Mathematics, Part 2: Recommendations for the Classroom. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Grouws, Douglas A. and Cebulla, Kristin J. From the ERIC Digest: The number of research studies conducted in mathematics education over the past three decades has increased dramatically (Kilpatrick, 1992). The results from these studies, together with relevant findings from research in other domains, such as cognitive psychology, are used to identify the successful teaching strategies and practices. Teaching and learning mathematics are complex tasks. The effect on student learning of changing a single teaching practice may be difficult to discern because of the simultaneous effects of both the other teaching activities that surround it and the context in which the teaching takes place. Research findings indicate that certain teaching strategies and methods are worth careful consideration as teachers strive to improve their mathematics teaching practices. To readers who examine the suggestions that follow, it will become clear that many of the practices are interrelated. There is also considerable variety in the practices that have been found to be effective, and so most teachers should be able to identify ideas they would like to try in their classrooms. The practices are not mutually exclusive; indeed, they tend to be complementary. The logical consistency and variety in the suggestions from research make them both interesting and practical. For a summary of the research findings on which these recommendations are based, please see the companion to this Digest, "Improving Student Achievement in Mathematics, Part 1: Research Findings" (EDO-SE-00-09).

 urlLink Improving Student Achievement in Mathematics, Part 1: Research Findings. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Grouws, Douglas A. and Cebulla, Kristin J. From the ERIC Digest: The number of research studies conducted in mathematics education over the past three decades has increased dramatically (Kilpatrick, 1992). Research findings indicate that certain teaching strategies and methods are worth careful consideration as teachers strive to improve their mathematics teaching practices. For the classroom implications of the research findings summarized here, please see the companion to this Digest, "Improving Student Achievement in Mathematics, Part 2: Recommendations for the Classroom" (EDO-SE-00-10) 1. The extent of the students' opportunity to learn mathematics content bears directly and decisively on student mathematics achievement. Opportunity to learn (OTL) was studied in the First International Mathematics Study (Husen, 1967), where teachers were asked to rate the extent of student exposure to particular mathematical concepts and skills. Strong correlations were found between OTL scores and mean student achievement scores, with high OTL scores associated with high achievement. The link was also found in subsequent international studies, such as the Second International Mathematics Study (McKnight et al., 1987) and the Third International Mathematics and Science study (TIMSS) (Schmidt, McKnight, & Raizen, 1997). 2. Focusing instruction on the meaningful development of important mathematical ideas increases the level of student learning. There is a long history of research, going back to the work of Brownell (1945,1947), on the effects of teaching for meaning and understanding. Investigations have consistently shown that an emphasis on teaching for meaning has positive effects on student learning, including better initial learning, greater retention and an increased likelihood that the ideas will be used in new situations.

 urlLink Using Spreadsheets in Mathematics Education. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by S. Ali Ozgun-Koca. From the ERIC Digest: "Spreadsheets build an ideal bridge between arithmetic and algebra and allow the student free movement between the two worlds. Students look for patterns, construct algebraic expressions, generalize concepts, justify conjectures, and establish the equivalence of two models as intrinsic and meaningful needs rather than as arbitrary requirements posed by the teacher." (Friedlander, 1998, p. 383) Electronic spreadsheets have been created and used mainly as tools for mathematical and statistical calculations, as numerical or textual data can be inserted into their columns and rows (http://wwwstaff.murdoch.edu.au/ ~kissane/spreadsheets.htm). So, being able to manage spreadsheets has become one of the skills sought for anybody in this technologically enhanced millennium. Therefore, spreadsheets have become an important part of many different curriculums at different levels of education. Moreover, they have been used in education, especially mathematics education, as a tool in helping students understand mathematical concepts such as plotting and exploring functions and patterns, exploring probability and statistics, mathematical modeling, and geometric transformations (http://www.freshpond .net/treasures/math/spreadsheet/default.htm). Relationships among different types of representations such as tables, equations and graphs are more easily comprehendible when all representations are visible at once and linked to each other, i.e. when one makes a change in one representation, corresponding changes in other representations are offered by the program. Moreover, spreadsheets allow students to focus on the mathematical reasoning by freeing them from the burden of calculations and algebraic manipulations.

 urlLink Studying Watersheds: A Confluence of Important Ideas. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by David L. Haury. From the ERIC Digest: "How is life in your watershed? Though we generally describe where we live in terms of towns, cities, or school districts, we also live within the boundaries of local watersheds. Determined by the topography of a region rather than political boundaries, watersheds are areas of land defined by the flow patterns of rainwater or melting snow and ice. In general terms a watershed is a geographic area where all the water, sediments, and dissolved materials drain to a common outlet-a stream, river system, reservoir, underground aquifer, or other body of water. It can also be thought of as an area that "catches" water and routes it to a common basin, channel, or network of channels. Internationally, the term catchment rather than watershed is used to convey this idea. Some watersheds are complex systems like the Everglades (Robinson, Robinson, & Lane; 1996), while others are simpler river systems. Together they supply the world's fresh water. Understanding these natural systems and sustaining environmentally healthy conditions within these systems require the application of knowledge and skills from many subject domains, as well as active inquiry, collaborative study, and decision making. Unfortunately, most Americans do not know what watersheds are, and only 22% know that storm water runoff is the most common source of pollution in streams, rivers, and oceans (NEET, 1999).

 urlLink Faculty Compensation Systems: Impact on the Quality of Higher Education. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Sutton, Terry P. and Bergerson, Peter J. From the ERIC Digest: Factors That Affect Faculty Compensation Institutions possess limited control over the amount of funding available to finance faculty compensation. For example, decisions which determine the amount of funds available for faculty compensation are often affected by external or environmental forces that the institution cannot fully control. The variety of forces that affect the amount of funding for higher education faculty compensation suggests an ongoing, continual, cycle creating a loop. Figure 1 presents a hypothetical feedback model that calls attention to the wide range of factors that educators need to keep in mind when attempting to change faculty compensation. This model implies that each institution needs to scan its environment continuously to be aware of public perception and the attitudes of political actors in order to be able to respond effectively to the demands of these groups. The modern higher education environment forces each institution to be cognizant of its role as an economic, social, and cultural agent for the stakeholders it serves. The model presented in Figure 1 reflects the following: 1. The public's perception of how well an institution is fulfilling its mission will impact the amount of institutional funding the public will support (Foldesi, 1996, p. 30; Breslin and Klagholz, 1980, p. 44). 2. The level of funding an institution acquires directly affects the level of faculty compensation. 3. The level and the structure of the faculty compensation system affect the success the institution achieves in fulfilling its mission.

 urlLink Organizational Culture and Institutional Transformation. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Keup, Jennifer R. - Walker, Arianne A. - Astin, Helen S. - Lindholm, Jennifer A. From the ERIC Digest: During the past two decades higher education in America has attempted a number of reforms. Reform efforts are predicated on the assumption that proactive, intentional change efforts in colleges and universities can succeed despite the predilection for tradition and maintaining the existing culture. Culture proves to be a critical component in understanding the process of planned change and transformation in colleges and universities today. The significance of organizational culture becomes particularly clear as we operationalize institutional transformation. The concept of transformation described borrows from the work of Eckel, Hill & Green (1998), who make reference to organizational culture as one of four primary elements of planned change. They state that institutional transformation: "1) alters the culture of the institution by changing select underlying assumptions and institutional behaviors, processes, and products; 2) is deep and pervasive, affecting the whole institution; 3) is intentional; and 4) occurs over time" (p. 3, underline added). The purpose of this digest is to review the research on institutional transformation as it is relates to organizational culture. The discussion of organizational culture's importance in institutional transformation will be organized around three primary aspects of the change process: 1) readiness for, and responsiveness to, institutional transformation, 2) resistance to planned change, and 3) the results of the transformation process.

 urlLink Knowledge Management for Higher Education. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by John H. Milam Jr. From the ERIC Digest: Knowledge Management (KM) principles recognize that it is important for organizations to "know what they know." All institutions inherently store, access, and deliver knowledge in some manner. The question is what value is added to the products and services they deliver by the effective use of that knowledge capital. "Almost any institution in this country will make reference to the capturing of knowledge, the sharing of knowledge and the delivery of knowledge from faculty to students," explains Stevenson. However, KM involves much more, going beyond the inherent knowledge industry of colleges and universities. In the EDUCAUSE Leadership Strategies volume entitled Information Alchemy: The Art and Science of Knowledge Management, Bernbom explains that KM involves the "discovery and capture of knowledge, the filtering and arrangement of this knowledge, and the value derived from sharing and using this knowledge throughout the organization" (2001, p. xiv). It is this "organized complexity" of collaborative work to share and use information across all aspects of an institution which marks the effective use of knowledge. Higher education institutions have "significant opportunities to apply knowledge management practices to support every part of their mission," explains Kidwell et al (2001, p. 24). "Knowledge management should not strike higher education institutions as a radically new idea; rather it is a new spin on their raison d'etre" (p. 24). The problem is that it is such a "wide open area of study that it is difficult to understand the implications of knowledge management for an educational setting" (Thorn, 2001, p. 25). This digest offers a basic introduction to the potential of KM for higher education.

 urlLink Selecting Materials To Teach Spanish to Spanish Speakers. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Winke, Paula and Stafford, Cathy. From the ERIC Digest: Rapid demographic changes and an increasing recognition of the critical need for professionals who are proficient in languages other than English (Brecht & Rivers, 2000; Carreira & Armengol, 2001) have led to an interest in developing language programs and classes for "heritage language learners"--students who are raised in a home where a non-English language is spoken and who speak or at least understand that language (Valdes, 2001). The fastest growing heritage language population in the United States is Hispanic Americans (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2001), and the number of Spanish speakers studying Spanish is on the rise. As a result, language educators are developing programs, classes, and instructional strategies to address the needs of these students, which are different from those of native-English-speaking students studying Spanish as a foreign language. Appropriate instructional materials are essential for these classes, which are often referred to as Spanish for Spanish speakers (SNS) classes. Although the development of SNS materials has a 30-year history, and many new SNS textbooks and materials continue to appear, developing a well-articulated sequence for SNS instruction continues to be a challenge (Peyton, Lewelling, &amp; Winke, 2001). The purpose of this digest is twofold--to raise awareness of the range of SNS materials available to teachers and school districts, and to emphasize the importance of articulated SNS programs with well-sequenced materials. It describes published resources that list and review available SNS materials and gives an overview of the types of materials available. It also provides guidelines for selecting textbooks and other materials for SNS classes or for classes with both English-speaking and Spanish-speaking students.

 urlLink Tapping a National Resource: Heritage Languages in the United States. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Brecht, Richard D. and Ingold, Catherine W. From the ERIC Digest: The United States has an unprecedented need for individuals with highly developed language competencies not only in English, our societal language, but also in many other languages. In fact, the need for individuals with proficiency in languages other than English for use in social, economic, diplomatic, and geopolitical arenas has never been higher (Brecht & Rivers, 2000). Even before the events of September 11, 2001, congressional hearings had begun to document a shortage of professionals with the language proficiencies required to carry out a wide range of federal government activities. More than 70 government agencies reported a need for individuals with foreign language expertise. Since September, the General Accounting Office has suggested that shortages of staff with foreign language expertise at several agencies "have adversely affected agency operations and hindered U.S. military, law enforcement, intelligence, counter terrorism, and diplomatic efforts" (Barr, 2002). Over 175 languages are used in the United States (SIL International, 2002), many of which are taught in U.S. colleges and universities. However, developing the high levels of proficiency needed for professional purposes can require many years and far more hours of instruction than a typical college curriculum provides. There exists, however, a largely untapped reservoir of linguistic competence in this country, namely heritage language speakers-the millions of indigenous, immigrant, and refugee individuals who are proficient in English and also have skills in other languages that were developed at home, in schools, in their countries of origin, or in language programs provided by their communities in the United States (see Peyton, Ranard, &amp; McGinnis, 2001). This digest outlines the reasons for and challenges of developing the language skills of heritage language speakers and describes one effort to carry this out, the Heritage Languages Initiative.

 urlLink Impact of Two-Way Immersion on Students' Attitudes toward School and College. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Lindholm-Leary, Kathryn J. and Borsato, Graciela. From the ERIC Digest: One program model that has shown positive outcomes for Hispanic students is two-way immersion (Lindholm-Leary, 2001), also known as two-way bilingual or dual language education. Two-way programs integrate native English speakers and English language learners in the same classroom and provide content instruction in both English and the native language of the English language learners. These programs aim to provide high quality educational experiences for all students and promote higher levels of academic achievement. This digest reports on a study that examined the impact of participation in a two-way immersion program on the language and achievement outcomes of former program participants and on their current schooling path and college plans. The study explored outcomes for three groups of students: 1) Hispanic students who began the two-way program as English language learners; 2) Hispanic students who began the program as English-only or English-dominant speakers; and 3) European American students who entered the program as monolingual speakers of English.

 urlLink Engaging the Community To Support Student Achievement. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Chris Cunningham. From the ERIC Digest: School systems have long recognized the need for public support and participation, but now many districts are renewing their commitment to strengthen the ties with their communities. More than ever, school districts realize they are dependent on community support to meet mandated state and national performance standards, develop innovative programs, and secure financial resources. To build lasting community support for schools that facilitates student achievement, school boards are developing communication strategies that routinely reach diverse community groups. The process of building such partnerships, called public engagement, is ongoing, two-way communication between a school district and the community it serves (Resnick 2000). This Digest examines how public engagement can foster student achievement, how school boards and administrators can facilitate the public-engagement process, and how school leaders can solicit enduring support from key stakeholders.

 urlLink The Graphing Skills of Students in Mathematics and Science Education. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by S. Asli Ozgun-Koca. From the ERIC Digest: The effective use of representations in mathematics and science education has gained more importance as we enter the new millennium. National Council of Teachers of Mathematics even added, Representation, to their four process standards which "highlight ways of acquiring and using content knowledge" (NCTM, 2000, p.29) in their new reform document, "Principles and Standards for School Mathematics". Even though all types of representations are being encouraged in the teaching and learning of mathematics and science, graphical representations play a special role. Graphs can summarize very complex information or relationship very effectively. Although graphs are explicitly taught in mathematics classrooms as an end in themselves, many subject areas such as science or social studies utilize graphs to represent and interpret relationships. So being able to interpret or construct graphical representations is a crucial skill for every student whether they want to pursue science or mathematics related careers. However, many researchers detected that many students lack graphing skills. Brasell and Rowe (1993) studied high school physics students' graphing skills and they concluded that "[students] do not understand the fundamental properties and functions of graphs in representing relationships among variables." Their facility with graphs was generally superficial, grounded on a few, simplistic algorithms such as plotting data points" (p. 69). Janvier was one of the first mathematics educators to mention the problems that students have in interpreting graphs (Bell & Janvier, 1981; Janvier, 1981). Mostly he argues how global meanings of graphs and interpreting graphs are left out in mathematics classrooms, while reading data and constructing and reading certain points on graphs are emphasized.

 urlLink Distance Education and Accreditation. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Shannon Loane. From the ERIC Digest: In 1997-1998, there were more than 1.3 million enrollments in college-level, credit-granting distance education courses - approximately double the almost 754,000 formal enrollments in 1994-1995 (Lewis, Snow, Farris, and Levin, 1999, p. 50). The number of courses offered also almost doubled, with the nearly 26,000 distance education courses offered by 2- and 4-year higher education institutions in 1994-1995 growing to more than 47,500 different college-level courses in 1997-1998 (Lewis, Snow, Farris, and Levin, 1999, p. 49). This rapid growth in distance education has created the potential for fraud and abuse. With so many courses and programs offered by so many providers, how can students determine which courses and programs are worthwhile - and which ones are shams? This digest will, after reviewing some information on distance education, discuss accreditation, the traditional method of determining the quality of higher education offerings in the United States, and its application to distance education. DISTANCE EDUCATION Distance education, sometimes known as distance learning, is "the process whereby the education of a student occurs in circumstances where the educator and the student are geographically separated, and the communication across this distance is accomplished by one or more forms of technology" (American Association of University Professors, May-June 1998, p. 32). It is not a new concept - distance education was initially offered through print-based correspondence courses, then through telecourses and videotapes, and now through computer-based instruction (although print and video are still used). The current explosion in distance education is attributable to the development and spread of new technologies. In 1997-1998, the most popular technology for offering distance education courses was Internet courses using asynchronous computer-based instruction. Sixty percent of higher education institutions offering distance education courses used this technology, up from 22 percent in 1995. Other popular technologies included two-way interactive video (56 percent), one-way prerecorded video (48 percent), Internet courses using synchronous computer-based instruction (19 percent), and one-way video with two-way audio (14 percent) (Lewis, Snow, Farris, and Levin, 1999, p. 52).

 urlLink Strategies for Educating the Adult Black Male in College. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by Patricia Spradley. From the ERIC Digest: Administrators, scholars, faculty, and students continue to actively discuss the socioeconomic and educational plight of African American males and their declining enrollment and retention in and graduation from higher education. The majority of research has focused on traditional-age students and increasing their success. For example, evidence suggests that the decision of traditional-age African American males to drop out of college may be caused by several factors, including lack of financial aid, socio-cultural challenges, and institutional incompatibility (Wilson, 1996). Initial recommendations to address the plight of traditional-age African American male college students include increased attention to mentoring, as mentors have the potential of assisting African American males in negotiating the enormous intricacies of the higher education pipeline (Wilson, 2000). One promising trend is the returning of adult males. The number of black males 25 years old and over enrolled in college has increased from 143,000 in 1990 to 267,000 in 1995 to 335,000 in 2000 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2001). The adult black male's increased participation in higher education over the last decade has challenged post-secondary institutions to adapt to changing clientele and design their programs to address the special needs of the adult learner (NCES, 1996; Perna, 1997). For instance, it has become necessary to provide accessible options for academic pursuit that respond to the adult males' expectations, needs, and interests. There are three main strategies that help to support this population: 1) peer support in classes as an incentive for their learning; 2) faculty-student relationships; and 3) extra-curricular activities (Bean & Metzner, 1985). This ERIC Digest will review these three key strategies, providing administrators with needed information to guide the design of programs and activities to help support this population.

 urlLink Current Challenges of International Education. ERIC Digest. This ERIC Digest is by William Cummings. From the ERIC Digest: September 11, 2001 has turned a spotlight on international education. Does U.S. higher education have adequate expertise in Middle Eastern issues to interpret recent events? How will foreign student enrollments in U.S. postsecondary institutions be impacted? These are the urgent questions now being asked by international educators. In this Digest, we will present some of the research that bears on these issues. THE FIELD OF INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION International education has a somewhat unusual position in higher education. While recognized as an important sphere of activity, it tends to be handled by administrative offices at the top of departments of languages and literature and international affairs. The scholars involved in international education usually have their primary involvement in other teaching and research. This leads to four distinctive characteristics particular to the field of international education: 1. There is little consensus concerning the guiding theme of the field as well as its scope. Should the field stress internationalization, transnationalization, or globalization (Barrows, 2000; Committee for Transnational Competence, 2000; Hilary, 2000)? 2. International education is not a prominent feature of the contemporary higher education experience. Using enrollment in foreign languages as an indicator, 16 percent of all U.S. college students were enrolled in foreign languages in the peak period of the 1960s; the proportion is currently down to 8 percent (Hayward, 2000, p. 6). 3. There is imbalance in regional coverage. The regions and languages covered at a particular institution are a function of idiosyncratic patterns of faculty recruitment. Nationally, there is reasonable coverage of Western Europe and Latin America and most European languages compared to limited coverage of Africa and the Middle East. For students enrolled in foreign languages, Spanish is the most popular followed by the other major languages of Western Europe; 6 percent enroll in Asian languages. Languages of the Middle East make up only 2 percent (1.3 being Hebrew and .5 percent Arabic). The languages of Africa constitute only 0.15 percent of enrollments. 4. Because international education is not a primary concern of most scholars in the field, research is somewhat sporadic, non-cumulative, and tends to be carried out by national organizations as part of advocacy projects (e.g. Lambert, 1989; Brecht and Rivers, 2000). The most recent example is the American Council of Education's (ACE's) Internationalization of Higher Education: A Status Report. (Hayward, 2000).

 urlLink Teaching about US Presidential Elections This is an essay which gives an overview of the American electoral process for selecting presidents. It also has tips for teaching about the whole prcoess. From the site: Although elections are an annual theme in many social studies classrooms, presidential election years prompt increased interest among students in the electoral process and offer an opportunity to teach about a national election as it happens. This ERIC Digest describes legal and extralegal requirements and traditions of presidential elections, processes by which people seek and gain the office of president, and resources for teaching about presidential elections.

 urlLink USA Presidents This is an outstanding site which has information on the American Presidency. It also has individual biographies of each President. This is an easy to navigate and read site. It is fairly new and I expect it to rank well in the search engines in the future. From the site: About the Presidency The President of the United States is the head of state of the United States . Under the U.S. Constitution , the President is also the chief executive of the federal government and commander in chief of the armed forces . Requirements to hold office Section one of Article II of the U.S. Constitution establishes the requirements one must meet in order to become President: The president must be a natural-born citizen of the United States, at least 35 years of age, and a resident of the United States for 14 years. Under the Constitution, the President serves a four-year term. Amendment XXII (which took effect in 1951 and was first applied to Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952 ) limits the President to two terms.

 urlLink American Experience | The Presidents | PBS This is a collection of research developed for the PBS television series. Includes a review of all 20th century chief executives, a collection of Presidential quotes, links to related sites, a comprehensive collection of primary source materials, and a teachers' guide. From the site: Henry Adams, the American historian and the grandson and great-grandson of presidents, said the president "resembles the commander of a ship at sea. He must have a helm to grasp, a course to steer, a port to seek." Indeed, each of our presidents has taken America on a slightly different voyage--voyages shaped largely by how each sitting president has defined the institution of the presidency. Some have been more bold and adventuresome than others--working to mold public opinion and actively pushing their programs through Congress. Others have not ventured far--feeling that presidential intervention often causes more problems than it solves.

 urlLink Complete Book of U.S. Presidents : From George Washington to George W. Bush This is by WILLIAM DEGREGORIO and well worth reading by anyone who is looking for facts and trivia about American Presidents. Review from Amazon: This is the consummate guide to the political and personal lives of every U. S. president through Bill Clinton. Arranged chronologically, The Complete Book of U.S. Presidents elaborates not only on the major accomplishments and events of their terms, but also on less well-known details such as personalities, careers before the presidency, Supreme Court appointments, hobbies, ethnic backgrounds, and even extramarital affairs. Well-organized and packed with details, the book also includes a bibliography on each executive, including books written by and about them, along with useful and entertaining appendixes on the political composition of every Congress, presidential curiosities (such as the uncanny similarities between the lives and deaths of Abraham Lincoln and John F. Kennedy), and a ranking of presidents. Whether you want to know the opponent of James Monroe in the election of 1816 or read some of Harry S. Truman's more memorable quotes, this is a most complete and thorough reference to each commander in chief.

 urlLink Jefferson's Children : The Story of One American Family This book is by Shannon Lanier. It is reviewed by Julie Lorenzen. From the site: Shannon Lanier, author of Jefferson's Children: The Story of One American Family, has always wanted to tell people that he is the sixth great-grandson of Thomas Jefferson and his slave Sally Hemings. However, until recently, he has had trouble getting people to believe him. The idea that a descendant of a slave is related to our third U.S. President has been controversial. It also didn't help that Lanier's family didn't have any historical documents to back up their claim because records of slaves are rare. For example when Lanier, who is black, stood up on President's Day and told his first-grade class he was a descendant of Thomas Jefferson, his teacher called him a liar. The history books did not recognize the relationship between Hemings and Jefferson and all Lanier had as proof was an Oral History passed down from generation to generation. More solid proof arrived on October 31, 1998, when the Associated Press broke the news of the DNA findings linking Thomas Jefferson to Sally Hemings through the Eston Hemings line. On November 10, Oprah united members of the Jefferson family and the descendants of three lines of the Hemings family. During the show, writer Lucian K. Truscott IV, a Jefferson descendant, invited his Hemings cousins to a family reunion that May at Monticello. Eighteen-year-old Shannon, then a college freshman at Kent State University, saw the show and accepted the invitation.

 urlLink The Election of 1800: Teaching about a Critical Moment in the History of American Constitutional Democracy. This is a good essay which talks about the first turn over of power after a presidential election in American history. It also gives ideas for teaching. From the site: As America approaches its 54th presidential election in 2000, we take it for granted that the candidate who wins that election -- no matter how partisan or contested it might be -- will become the 43rd President of the United States following a peaceful transfer of power in a familiar ceremony. Indeed, this sense of inevitability is clear evidence of the strength of constitutional democracy in the United States. Aside from the election of 1860, which led to the Civil War, for two centuries America has met the test that a country is an established democracy when it consistently makes peaceful changes of government via free elections (Huntington 1991, 7-9). But this democratic tradition had to be earned. In 1800 American democracy faced one of its most serious challenges when Republican Thomas Jefferson defeated Federalist President John Adams. World history reveals that in all too many cases, political leaders defeated at the ballot have not honored the voice of the people. But America followed a different course. The Federalists handed over the reins of power to their hated rivals, setting a precedent that has guided American politics ever since. Do students recognize the peaceable outcome of the election of 1800 as one of the most critical moments in the establishment of constitutional democracy in America? The approaching bicentennial of Thomas Jefferson's election is an appropriate time to reflect upon the central place this momentous event should have in the school curriculum. This Digest connects the election of 1800 to the social studies curriculum, summarizes core content on this key event in American history, proposes the use of historic documents by teachers and students, and recommends World Wide Web sites as sources of documents and related information.

 urlLink George Washington This is an excellent biography of the George Washington. It is from urlLink USA Presidents . From the site: George Washington ( February 22 , 1732 - December 14 , 1799 ) was the first ( 1789 - 1797 ) President of the United States of America and is recognized by Americans as " The Father of His Country ." (The earliest known image in which Washington is identified as such is on the cover of the circa 1778 Pennsylvania German almanac, Lancaster: Gedruckt bey Francis Bailey . This identifies Washington as "Landes Vater" or Father of the Land .) George Washington's birthday is celebrated on February 22 using the Gregorian calendar , but under the Julian calendar , which was in use throughout Britain and its colonies at the time of this birth, he was born on February 11 .

 urlLink Lyndon Johnson: A Brief Biography This is another biography of an American President by Miland Brown. From the site: Johnson was born on Aug. 27, 1908, near Johnson City, Tex., the eldest son of Sam Ealy Johnson, Jr., and Rebekah Baines Johnson. His father, a struggling farmer and cattle speculator in the hill country of Texas, provided only an uncertain income for his family. Politically active, Sam Johnson served five terms in the Texas legislature. His mother had varied cultural interests and placed high value on education; she was fiercely ambitious for her children. Johnson attended public schools in Johnson City and received a B.S. degree from Southwest Texas State Teachers College in San Marcos. He then taught for a year in Houston before going to Washington in 1931 as secretary to a Democratic Texas congressman, Richard M. Kleberg. During the next 4 years Johnson developed a wide network of political contacts in Washington, D.C. On Nov. 17, 1934, he married Claudia Alta Taylor, known as "Lady Bird." A warm, intelligent, ambitious woman, she was a great asset to Johnson's career. They had two daughters, Lynda Byrd, born in 1944, and Luci Baines, born in 1947. In 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt entered the White House. Johnson greatly admired the president, who named him, at age 27, to head the National Youth Administration in Texas. This job, which Johnson held from 1935 to 1937, entailed helping young people obtain employment and schooling. It confirmed Johnson's faith in the positive potential of government and won for him a group of supporters in Texas. In 1937, Johnson sought and won a Texas seat in Congress, where he championed public works, reclamation, and public power programs. When war came to Europe he backed Roosevelt's efforts to aid the Allies. During World War II he served a brief tour of active duty with the U.S. Navy in the Pacific (1941-42) but returned to Capitol Hill when Roosevelt recalled members of Congress from active duty. Johnson continued to support Roosevelt's military and foreign-policy programs. During the 1940s, Johnson and his wife developed profitable business ventures, including a radio station, in Texas. In 1948 he ran for the U.S. Senate, winning the Democratic party primary by only 87 votes. (This was his second try; in 1941 he had run for the Senate and lost to a conservative opponent.) The opposition accused him of fraud and tagged him "Landslide Lyndon." Although challenged, unsuccessfully, in the courts, he took office in 1949.

 urlLink John Adams This us a nice biography of President John Adams. It is from urlLink USA Presidents . From the site: John Adams ( October 30 , 1735 - July 4 , 1826 ) was the first ( 1789 - 1797 ) Vice President of the United States , and the second ( 1797 - 1801 ) President of the United States . Adams was born on October 30 , 1735 in what is now the town of Quincy, Massachusetts . His father, a farmer, also named John, was a fourth generation descendant of Henry Adams, who emigrated from Devon , England , to Massachusetts about 1636 ; his mother was Susanna Boylston Adams. Young Adams graduated from Harvard College in 1755 , and for a time taught school at Worcester and studied law in the office of Rufus Putnam. In 1758 , he was admitted to the bar. From an early age he developed the habit of writing descriptions of events and impressions of men. The earliest of these is his report of the argument of James Otis in the superior court of Massachusetts as to the constitutionality of writs of assistance. This was in 1761 , and the argument inspired him with zeal for the cause of the American colonies. Years later, when he was an old man, Adams undertook to write out, at length, his recollections of this scene; it is instructive to compare the two accounts.

 urlLink Dead Presidents Visits to the gravesites of the U.S. Presidents, with links for more information on their lives. The creator of the site visits presidential grave sites and has picture taken in front of each one. This site was voted one of the most useless on the Web. However, I disagree.

 urlLink Teaching about George Washington. This is an essay which gives an overview of the life of Geroge Washington. It also provides teachers with ideas for teaching about this American President. From the site: No generation in American history has matched that of the founding era for its array of talented and influential political thinkers and actors. John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and George Washington all possessed certain traits of character and intellect that significantly shaped the new United States of America and its direction for generations that followed. Among these personalities, George Washington is the most difficult for students to know. Compared to Jefferson, Hamilton, or most other important historical figures, our common images of Washington--seen on the dollar bill and quarter, crossing the Delaware River, or enshrined in the impersonal Washington Monument--are cold and distant. Today's perceptions of Washington seem to validate Ralph Waldo Emerson's maxim, "Every hero becomes a bore at last." Do most students understand the importance of George Washington as a military and political leader during a time that demanded extraordinary leadership? The bicentennial of Washington's death in 1999 is an appropriate time to reflect upon his role and place in the school curriculum.

 urlLink James Monroe This is a biography of President James Monroe. It is from urlLink USA Presidents . From the site: James Monroe ( April 28 , 1758 - July 4 , 1831 ) was the fifth ( 1817 - 1825 ) President of the United States . He is credited with the development of the Monroe Doctrine . His parents Spence Monroe (c. 1727 - 1774 ) and Elizabeth Jones (born c. 1729 ) were well-to-do farmers. In 1802 , then-president Thomas Jefferson sent Monroe to Paris to assist in the negotiations of the Louisiana Purchase . Monroe's presidency was later labeled "The Era of Good Feeling", in part because partisan politics were almost nonexistent. The Federalist Party had died out, the Whig Party had not yet risen, and practically every politician belonged to what is now known as the Democratic Party . Monroe, the last American Revolutionary War veteran to serve as president, was almost uncontested in his two elections.

 urlLink James Madison This is a good biography of President James Madison. It is from urlLink USA Presidents . From the site: James Madison ( March 16 , 1751 - June 28 , 1836 ) was the fourth ( 1809 - 1817 ) President of the United States . He was co-author, with John Jay and Alexander Hamilton , of the Federalist Papers , and is viewed by some as the "Father of the United States Constitution ." Madison was born in King George County, Virginia . His parents Colonel James Madison, Sr ( March 27 , 1723 - February 27 , 1801 ) and Eleanor Rose "Nellie" Conway ( January 9 , 1731 - February 11 , 1829 ) were the prosperous owners of the tobacco plantation in Orange County, Virginia where James spent most of his childhood years. In 1769, James left the plantation to attend Princeton University (it was called the College of New Jersey at the time), finishing its four-year course in two years, but exhausting himself from overwork in the process. When he regained his health, he became a protegé of Thomas Jefferson . In this capacity he became a prominent figure in Virginia state politics, helping to draft their declaration of religious freedom and persuading Virginia to give their northwestern territories (consisting of most of modern-day Ohio , Kentucky and Tennessee ) to the continental congress. In the 1780s , Madison helped convince the political leaders of the time to call for a constitutional convention. Madison's influence at the convention in 1787 has led some historians to call him the "Father of the Constitution". His notes on the convention became the basis for his contributions to the Federalist Papers , which are considered the definitive contemporary commentary on the Constitution of the USA. Madison's arguments were powerfully influenced by the political thought of Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu .

 urlLink Woodrow Wilson: A Brief Biography This is biography of Woodrow Wilson by Miland Brown. From the site: THOMAS WOODROW WILSON was the 28th president of the United States. Born on the 28th of December 1856, he was an American scholar and statesman who was best remembered for his high-minded and leading the United States into World War I. Wilson was born to religious and well-educated people, mainly of Scottish background. Wilson's father, Joseph Ruggles Wilson, studied for the clergy at the Presbyterian directed Princeton University. He married Janet Woodrow, and early in the 1850s the Wilsons moved to Virginia, where he became minister of a church in Staunton. There, in 1856 Thomas Woodrow Wilson was born, the first son and third child. Apparently dyslexic from childhood, Wilson did not learn to read until he was 10 and never became a rapid reader. Nevertheless, he developed passionate interests in literature and especially politics. He attended Davidson College North Carolina, for a year before entering Princeton University in 1875. At Princeton he blossomed intellectually, reading widely, engaging in debate, and editing the college newspaper. After graduation from Princeton in 1879, Wilson studied law at the University of Virginia, with the hope that it would lead to politics. However, he became inpatient with the fine points of law and only reluctantly mastered them. Although his work was outstanding, he found public speaking and political history more satisfying. Despite intermittent illness, he received his law degree and in 1882 settled in Atlanta, Georgia, where he opened a law practice. In 1883 he became tired of the firm and abandoned his law career for graduate study in government and history at Johns Hopkins University, where in 1886 he received a Ph.D.

 urlLink Andrew Jackson This is an exellent biography of President Andrew Jackson. It is from urlLink USA Presidents . From the site: Andrew Jackson ( March 15 , 1767 - June 8 , 1845 ) was the seventh ( 1829 - 1837 ) President of the United States , sometimes called "Old Hickory". Andrew Jackson's parents Andrew Jackson, Sr (c. 1730 - February , 1767 ) and Elizabeth "Betty" Hutchinson (c. 1740 - November , 1781 ) emigrated to the US from Carrickfergus in Northern Ireland in 1765 . The Andrew Jackson Centre at Carrickfergus has information about the family. Wounded in a duel as a young man, Jackson was a frequent dueler. Jackson was regarded as a national hero after defeating the British in the 1815 Battle of New Orleans . In the Presidential Election of 1824 Jackson won both more popular and electoral votes than any other candidate, but did not receive an overall majority so the election went to the House of Representatives, where John Quincy Adams was chosen as President. Jackson beat Adams with a substantial majority four years later, and took office as President in 1829 .

 urlLink John Quincy Adams This is a nice biography of President John Quincy Adams. It is from urlLink USA Presidents . From the site: John Quincy Adams ( July 11 , 1767 - February 23 , 1848 ) was the sixth ( 1825 - 1829 ) President of the United States . He was the son of President John Adams and First Lady Abigail Adams . He is the first President whose father was also President. The second one is George W. Bush .

Adams, who stood second to Andrew Jackson in the electoral vote, was chosen and served from March 4 , 1825 , to March 4 , 1829 .

 urlLink The US Presidents - The History Project - Character in Time This is an interesting and worthwhile project. It seeks to produce quality one-act plays that capture the character of each President. Site includes synopsis of each play, along with profiles of the playwrights involved in the project. From the site: he American Presidents are the focus of a unique publishing event undertaken by The History Project, Inc. It is task which has never been attempted: to develop and publish a production quality drama with each of the American Presidents as protagonist. Each of these one-act plays seeks to capture the character, the person in his place and time. This series addresses and explores answers to the question, "Who was he?" rather than "What did he do?" These plays, which are suitable for reading, study, teaching, and production are not exhaustive historical examinations of the forces and conflicts of American national, social, and political life. More appropriately, they are intense, brief examinations of the Presidents who guided (or misguided) Americans through those forces and conflicts. The plays contain endnotes which place the Presidents in US and world time in addition to providing specific information relating to birth, family, appearance, education, employment, marriage, and circumstances of death. Forty plays are planned. Some are completed and published. Some are in production. Some are in draft stages in the computers of writers nationwide and nearing publication. Some are simply projections of the future of the series (after James K. Polk). J.H. Crouch, Professor Emeritus of the University of Colorado and Founder of the Colorado Shakespeare Festival writes... "Each of these short plays (I won't call them dramatic sketches) seizes the moment and renders it in complete dramatic opposition and resolution. They make stimulating reading and would be invaluable to entertain and instruct—an unbeatable combination—not to mention the varied production possibilities."

 urlLink Presidents (Eyewitness Books) This looks like a fun sticker book on American Presidents. It is by James Barber and John Hareas. From the Amazon Description: With this 8-page booklet, young readers can learn fun facts about United States presidents as they fill in background scenes with more than 60 reusable stickers. All 43 presidents are represented in miniature photo or portrait reproductions. In addition, stickers of the presidential seal, campaign posters, pins, and pendants, and American flags can be removed and placed in the scenes, which include the Oval Office of the White House, Mount Rushmore's presidential carvings, and Air Force One. Side boxes on several of the pages offer interesting tidbits about the nation's commanders: Grover Cleveland, for example, was the first president to have a child born in the White House. This event inspired a candy bar named after his daughter: Baby Ruth. Children won't come away from this booklet with a comprehensive knowledge of the presidents, but it will be an entertaining introduction to some of the most powerful men in history.

 urlLink Martin Van Buren This is a good biography of President Martin Van Buren. It is from urlLink USA Presidents . From the site: Martin Van Buren ( December 5 , 1782 - July 24 , 1862 ) was the eighth ( 1833 - 1837 ) Vice President , the eighth ( 1837 - 1841 ) President of the United States and the first President born after the Declaration of Independence. He was born in Kinderhook , New York of Dutch descent. His father Abraham Van Buren ( February 17 , 1737 - April 8 , 1817 ) was a farmer and tavern-keeper. His mother Maria Hoes ( February 27 , 1747 - February 16 , 1817 ) also had children from a previous marriage. Martin's education was limited to that which could be obtained in the common schools and at Kinderhook Academy. In 1796 he began the study of law , completing his preparation in 1802 at New York , where he studied under William Peter Van Ness ( 1778 - 1826 ), an eminent lawyer and later Aaron Burr 's second in the duel with Alexander Hamilton . Van Buren made the acquaintance of Burr, but did not fall under his influence. In 1803 he was admitted to the bar and continued in active and successful practice for twenty-five years. His practice made him financially independent, and paved the way for his entrance into politics. New York politics after 1800 , the year of the election of Jefferson and the downfall of the Federalists , were particularly bitter and personal. The Republicans were divided into three factions, followers respectively of George Clinton (and later of his nephew, De Witt Clinton ), Robert R. Livingston and Aaron Burr. Federalist control after 1799 depended upon coalition with one or other of these groups. Van Buren, who early allied himself with the Clintonians, was surrogate of Columbia County from 1808 until 1813 , when he was removed. In 1812 he entered the state Senate, and he also became a member of the Court for the Correction of Errors , the highest court in New York until 1847 .

 urlLink First Ten Presidents of the United States of America - Home Page This is small site which provides brief but well written biographies of the first ten presidents. It is hosted at geocities which means it is liable to vanish at any time but I think it is worth noting. From the site: To remember the achievements of America's early Presidents, one need only call to mind the beliefs most widely cherished by so many of the American people: the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights ......... to name but a few. America's first Presidents laid the bedrock on which America was built and on which America still stands today. It is a foundation which has remained fundamentally unchanged for over two hundred years, affording stability and confidence to the American people from generation to generation. The following pages deal with the lives of America's first ten Presidents and are dedicated in their honor. A short biography, provided by the White House, of each of these Presidents is included together with specific links to additional information available on the internet. I am certain, that having read the brief account of each of their lives, you will agree that America is eternally indebted to these remarkable men.

 urlLink George Washington: A Brief Biography This is a biref, but uneven, biography of the first American President George Washington. It is written by Miland Brown. From the site: George Washington was born on February 22, 1732 in Westmoreland County, Virginia. Here he received little formal education. Historians have speculated that he attended a school in Fredericksburg, or may have been tutored by an indentured servant. Washington lived with his mother until the age of 16. At the age of 15, Washington took a job as an assistant land surveyor. In 1748, he joined a surveying team that was sent to the Shanandoah Valley to help survey the land holdings of Lord Fairfax. By 1749, he established a good reputation as a land surveyor and was appointed to the official land surveyor of Culpeper County. Washington’s father owned several farms. When his father died in 1743, his stepbrother Lawrence received the Mount Vernon Estate. Lawrence Washington died nine years later. His will stated that if his daughter, Sarah, died without baring children the Mount Vernon Estate would go to George Washington. Sarah Washington died two years later without baring children. Washington began his military career on February 1,1753, when he was sworn into the Virginia militia. He started as an adjutant for the southern part of the colony. Next, he set out to Fort Le Beouf on Lake Erie. He sent a message stating for the French to leave the land alone. The French denied his message. Four months later, they promoted him to lieutenant colonel. After defeating some French scouting party in southern Pennsylvania, they promoted him to colonel in charge of all the Virginian troops. Colonel Washington led an attack at Fort Necessity, Pennsylvania, where he and 400 troops surrendered to the French and Indians. In October Washington resigned as colonel and returned to Mount Vernon. Governor Dinwidde begged and pleaded for his return. He denied at first, but decided to regain control. Washington remained colonel for the rest of the war.

 urlLink The Faith of George W. Bush This book is by Stephen Mansfield. It explores the religious beliefs of President George W. Bush. From a review at Publisher's Weekly : In this favorable look at the politics and faith of the nation's current president, Mansfield, who has penned several historical biographies with faith emphases, examines Bush's spiritual journey and discusses how it shapes his administration. Although he writes that Bush's faith has waxed and waned over the years, Bush "is among a small number of American presidents to have undergone a profound religious transformation as an adult... he came to the presidency, then, with the zeal of the newly converted." To understand the president's brand of faith, Mansfield traces his family legacy, his boyhood in Midland, Tex., his playboy years and his lifelong love affair with baseball. Bush's marriage to Laura helped stabilize him spiritually, and Mansfield details later encounters with evangelists Arthur Blessit and Billy Graham that he believes were pivotal in Bush's spiritual formation. He also shows the role of Bush's Christianity in running for various offices, implementing faith-based initiatives and responding to 9/11 and war in Afghanistan and Iraq. Throughout the book, Mansfield offers his own interpretations about events in writing that is often rich and specific in detail. Noticeably absent is commentary on Bush's controversial environmental policies and how his faith has-or has not-informed them. But Mansfield is correct when he writes that "whatever else the presidency of George W. Bush imprints on American history, it will at the least have granted the nation an opportunity to rethink the role of religion in its public life."

 urlLink Getting the Message Out! National Political Campaign Materials, 1840-1860 This is an exhibition examining the national popular political culture in the antebellum United States through campaign materials from presidential campaigns from 1840-1860. Site includes histories, biographies, and primary source material such as campaign biographies and campaign songbooks, as well as song recordings, images, and teachers' guide. Here is part of a lesson plan from site: Objectives: Students will examine campaign songs from the 1840, 1848, and 1860 elections to explore the campaign strategies of 19th century political parties. Students will draw connections between elements of the songs and the political, social, and economic climate in which they were written. Introduction: During the 1830s most states had dropped property qualifications for voting rights, which up to that point had allowed only the wealthy upper classes (those who owned enough property) to have control in presidential elections. Dropping these qualifications allowed for greater numbers of men to vote and made the election process in the United States more democratic (women and African-Americans were still denied the right to vote, however). The number of voters swelled from 1.5 million in 1836, to 2.4 million by the 1840 election. Because of this increase of participation by members of the lower classes, political parties and their candidates had to begin appealing to the common people. In the 1840 election, the participation of the average citizen in campaigning through rallies, parades, barbecues, and the like was larger than ever before. Political parties 'marketed' their candidates to voters through songs, banners, and even dolls and porcelain figurines. The campaign songs from these elections can be of particular use to historians looking to examine American political thought, culture, and ideals, because they are designed to make the candidate look appealing to the greatest number of voters. Examining what these songs say about the candidates can give us a clue as to what Americans were concerned with and what was valued at the time the elections were held.

 urlLink John Tyler This is a good biography of President John Tyler. It is from urlLink USA Presidents . From the site: John Tyler ( March 29 , 1790 - January 18 , 1862 ) of Virginia was the tenth ( 1841 ) Vice President of the United States , and the tenth ( 1841 - 1845 ) President of the United States . He was the second President born after the signing of the Declaration of Independence , and the first to assume the office of President following the death of his predecessor. He studied law with his father, John Tyler (1747-1813), who became Governor of Virginia (1808-1811), and followed his father as governor (1825-1827) after a stint in the House of Representatives. During his time as U.S. Senator, Tyler, who had begun as a strict state-rights Democrat, grew increasingly alienated from the Jacksonian Democrats, especially by Jackson's aggressive handling of the South Carolina nullification issue. Drawn into the newly-organized Whig Party , Tyler was elected Vice President in 1840 as running mate to William Henry Harrison , on the slogan "Tippecanoe—and Tyler too!" and assumed the presidency upon Harrison's death a month into his term. Tyler was the first Vice President to assume the Presidency in this manner. On April 6 , 1841 , he took the Presidential oath of office as specified by the Constitution. The Cabinet and Congress agreed with Tyler that he was President and not merely Acting President, and as the Constitution was not explicit on that aspect of succession (until the 1967 ratification of the 25th Amendment ), both the House and Senate passed resolutions recognizing Tyler as President.

 urlLink William Henry Harrison This is good biography of President William Henry Harrison. It is from urlLink USA Presidents . From the site: William Henry Harrison ( February 9 , 1773 - April 4 , 1841 ) was the ninth ( 1841 ) President of the United States . He was born at the family estate, Berkeley Plantation in Virginia. Harrison, like many other early presidents, was a Virginia plantation owner. His father, Benjamin Harrison V , was a signatory to the Declaration of Independence , and his brother a member of the United States House of Representatives . When he was 18, Harrison enlisted in the army, and he quickly rose through the ranks to become the first military governor of the Indiana territory. It was in this capacity that he defeated a rebellion of Native Americans under the leadership of Tecumseh . At the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811 ; Harrison was promoted to general and fought with distinction in the War of 1812 , in which Tecumseh was killed fighting as an ally of the British. After the war, he was elected to various political offices, including the House of Representatives and the United States Senate . He was the Northern Whig candidate for President in 1836 , but lost the election to Martin Van Buren . He was a candidate again in 1840 , when he won largely because of his heroic military record and the fact that the United States had suffered a severe economic downturn. His vice president was John Tyler . Their campaign slogans of "Log Cabins and Hard Cider" and "Tippecanoe and Tyler too" are among the most famous in American politics.

 urlLink George W. Bush: On God and Country This book is a collected volume of speeches by President George W. Bush. It is edited by Tom M. Freiling. From the publisher's description: George W. Bush on God and Country gives the reader the context from which the media pulls the sound-bites. Freiling organizes the speeches into topical themes: for example, the September 14, 2001 speech is titled "On Resolve. Other themes include compassionate conservatism, the use of prayer in American history, medical ethics, American values, the right to life, and justice. Using the original speeches from White House transcripts, Freiling removed the introduction, applause pauses and transcription errors. These minor changes do not take away from the strength of Bush’s vision for the America and freedom.

 urlLink The Hall of Forgotten Presidents This site is a tribute to presidents who supposedely no one remembers. (I do!) It gives a brief summary of their lives and achievements. Ultimately, Arthur, Tyler, and Polk are identified and chronicled as forgotten, yet important, Presidents. (What! Martin Van Buren didn't make the cut?) From the site: Their names have reverberated throughout the annals of history: Washington; Jefferson; Jackson; Lincoln; Roosevelt; Reagan. We all know of these great men and their deeds. But there have been others who also achieved the pinnacle of public office in the United States, yet are seldom mentioned. We don't learn about them as kids in school. No movies have ever been made about their lives. Few (if any) highways, bridges or schools are named after them. They do not appear on coins or bills. They rarely appear on postage stamps. These poor souls are THE FORGOTTEN PRESIDENTS.

 urlLink James Knox Polk This is a nice biography of President James Know Polk. It is from urlLink USA Presidents . From the site: James Knox Polk ( November 2 , 1795 - June 15 , 1849 ) was the 11th ( 1845 - 1849 ) President of the United States . Born in North Carolina in 1795 , James Polk was studious and hard working. He graduated from the University of North Carolina in 1818 , became a lawyer , and entered politics . Polk was a member of the United States House of Representatives ( 1825 - 1839 ), also serving as Speaker of the United States House of Representatives ( 1835 - 1839 ), and Governor of Tennessee ( 1839 - 1841 ).

 urlLink A Charge to Keep This is a pre-election biography of President. It is written by George W. Bush and Karen Hughes. From an Amazon Review: The political biography, complete with life-altering turning points and a political philosophy for leading the United States into greatness, has become obligatory for those running for president--just one more thing to check off the "to do" list on the way to the Oval Office. A Charge to Keep is George W. Bush's offering: a light and breezy book mixing personal and political remembrances that proves heavy on chatty anecdotes and light on policy prescriptions. If you read the last chapter you'll sort of learn where George W. stands on most things, but still not really discern how he would actually run the country. There are no revelations, either personal or political: Bush's wild side and youthful indiscretions, like stealing a Christmas wreath from a New Haven hotel for his Yale fraternity, are touched on lightly when he discusses them at all. A Charge to Keep is so upbeat and positive, in describing the Houston woman to whom he was engaged in college and from whom he "gradually drifted apart," Bush says simply: "I still think the world of her, and our parting was friendly. We were very young, we lived in different places, and we gradually developed different lives." George W. has been labeled a lightweight by some; A Charge to Keep will do nothing to dispel that notion. It features lots of Bush family memories and numerous mentions of George W.'s famous parents, including letters from his president father. George W. has followed closely in his father's footsteps, attending the same prep school and college. He even belonged to the same secret society at Yale, Skull and Bones. From college it was on to flight school and the Texas Air National Guard, Harvard Business School, and then (again, like his father) the Texas oil business and politics. George W. seems mostly in sync with his father on policy issues as well. "A thousand points of light" is transformed slightly to become "compassionate conservative," which pops up in the final chapter more than 10 times. Readers will come away knowing many of the experiences and events that have helped shaped George W., but his future is still an open book. --Linda Killian

 urlLink Zachary Taylor This is a good biography of President Zachary Taylor. It is from urlLink USA Presidents . From the site: Zachary Taylor ( November 24 , 1784 - July 9 , 1850 ), also known as "Old Rough and Ready", was the 12th ( 1849 - 1850 ) President of the United States , and the second President to die in office. Taylor was a career soldier . Starting with a commission as a first lieutenant, in 1808 , he fought in the War of 1812 , the Black Hawk War , and the Second Seminole War . President Polk sent an army under his command to the Rio Grande in 1846 . When the Mexicans attacked Taylor's troops, Taylor defeated the Mexicans, despite being outnumbered 4-to-1, and Polk declared war. In the Mexican-American War that followed, Taylor won additional important victories at Monterrey and Buena Vista and became a national hero. President Polk, disturbed by General Taylor's informal habits of command and perhaps his Whig status as well, kept him in northern Mexico and sent an expedition under General Winfield Scott to capture Mexico City. Taylor, incensed, thought that "the battle of Buena Vista opened the road to the city of Mexico and the halls of Montezuma, that others might revel in them." He received the Whig nomination for President in 1848 , although he had never even bothered to vote before. His homespun ways were political assets, his long military record would appeal to northerners, and his ownership of slaves would attract southern votes. He also had not previously committed himself on troublesome issues. He ran against the Democratic candidate, Lewis Cass , who favored letting the residents of territories decide for themselves whether they wanted slavery. In protest against Taylor, a slaveholder, and Cass, an advocate of "squatter sovereignty", northerners who opposed extension of slavery into territories formed the Free Soil Party and nominated Martin Van Buren . In a close election, the Free Soilers pulled enough votes away from Cass to elect Taylor.

 urlLink Franklin Pierce This is a good biography of President Franklin Pierce. It is from urlLink USA Presidents .

 urlLink My Life This is the much anticipated autobiography of President Clinton. From Amazon: Loved and reviled, respected and resented, Bill Clinton is one of the more polarizing and complex politicians of our age. As the 42nd President, he presided over a period of dizzying economic growth and technological progress and achieved such foreign policy successes as the ratification of NAFTA, helping to bring several former-Eastern Bloc nations into NATO, and assisting China's entrance into the World Trade Organization. His time in office was also marked by a string of scandals, most notably the Monica Lewinsky debacle and the subsequent impeachment trial, which largely overshadowed his triumphs. Just 53-years-old when he left office, Clinton continues to keep a high profile, having formed the William J. Clinton Presidential Foundation to focus on the battle against HIV/AIDS around the world; racial, ethnic, and religious reconciliation; economic empowerment of poor people; leadership development and citizen service. His memoir, My Life, due out on June 30, 2004, is an opportunity for Clinton to reveal his political philosophy and perspective on past events as well as a chance to influence his own place in history. Book Description President Bill Clinton's My Life is the strikingly candid portrait of a global leader who decided early in life to devote his intellectual and political gifts, and his extraordinary capacity for hard work, to serving the public. It is the fullest, most concretely detailed, most nuanced account of a presidency ever written, and a testament to the positive impact on America and on the world of his work and his ideals. Here is the life of a great national and international figure, revealed with all his talents and contradictions. Filled with fascinating moments and insights, it is told openly, directly, in President Clintons own completely recognizable voice.

 urlLink Millard Fillmore This is an excellent brief biography of the forgotten president Millard Fillmore. It is from urlLink USA Presidents . From the site: Millard Fillmore ( January 7 , 1800 - March 8 , 1874 ) was the the thirteenth ( 1850 - 1853 ) President of the United States being the second President to succeed to the office from the Vice Presidency on the death of the predecessor. He succeeded Zachary Taylor , who died of acute indigestion. Born in extreme poverty, he worked his way up through the Whig party, eventually being selected as Zachary Taylor 's running mate. It was thought that the obscure, self-made candidate from New York would complement Taylor, a slave-holding military man from the south. Nevertheless, the two men came to a head on the slavery issue in the new western territories taken from Mexico in the Mexican-American War . Taylor wanted the new states to be free states, while Fillmore supported slavery in those states in order to appease the South. In his own words: "God knows that I detest slavery, but it is an existing evil ... and we must endure it and give it such protection as is guaranteed by the Constitution." Fillmore presided over the Senate during the months of nerve-wracking debates over the Compromise of 1850. He made no public comment on the merits of the compromise proposals, but a few days before President Taylor's death, he intimated to him that if there should be a tie vote on Henry Clay's bill, he would vote in favor of it. Thus the sudden accession of Fillmore to the Presidency in July 1850 brought an abrupt political shift in the administration. Taylor's Cabinet resigned and President Fillmore at once appointed Daniel Webster to be Secretary of State, thus proclaiming his alliance with the moderate Whigs who favored the Compromise.

 urlLink James Buchanan This is a nice biography of President James Buchanan. It is from urlLink USA Presidents .

 urlLink Bill Clinton: An American Journey : Great Expectations This book is by Nigel Hamilton. From a Booklist Review: Hamilton, who took on the early years of John F. Kennedy in Reckless Youth (1992), now looks at the life of Bill Clinton from birth through his ascendancy to the presidency, with a second volume to follow. Similar to Reckless Youth in style, this is as much a psychological portrait and picture of an era as it is an examination of the facts and motivations of Clinton's life. In some cases, facts seem as mutable as motivations: Hamilton convincingly speculates that William Blythe was not Clinton's father. While relying heavily on works such as David Marannis' First in His Class (1995) and Gennifer Flowers' explicit Passion and Betrayal (1996), Hamilton bolsters his secondary sources with numerous interviews, though most are not with familiar names. His premise, though not new, is intriguingly spun: Clinton, the classic pulled-himself-up-by-his-bootstraps kid, the child of an alcoholic home, a chronic people pleaser, had a fatal flaw--his ambition overrode his morality. And yet, in spite of his premise, Hamilton is surprisingly sympathetic to his subject, placing Clinton's foibles against America's culture wars. (Would the Clintons' companionate marriage have raised eyebrows in Europe? he asks.) Hamilton's fleshed-out picture shows how easily Bill Clinton could charm, empathize, manipulate, and disappoint. A very readable addition to the growing Clinton bookshelf.

 urlLink The Masonic Presidents Tour Identifies U.S. Presidents who were Masons. Includes a portrait of each, along with his signature and a record of his Masonic career. From the site: This is a small permanent exhibit in The Masonic Library and Museum of Pennsylvania. It consists of a photographed portrait and the (facsimile) signature of each Masonic President of the United States, and a record of his Masonic career. The material is enhanced by photographs and background information on the Great Seal of The United States and the Flag of the President of the United States. The photographs and signatures are taken from the booklet The Presidents of the United States of America which was published by the White House Historical Association in cooperation with the National Geographic Society. Until recently, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison were included in this gallery of Masonic Presidents, but since their membership cannot be established as a certainty, their inclusion here was based more on speculation than fact. Until their membership can be absolutely proven, they should not be considered "Masonic Presidents." Lyndon B. Johnson was initiated on October 30, 1937 in Johnson City Lodge No. 561, at Johnson City, Texas, but completed only the Entered Apprentice, or first, of the three Masonic degrees. For this reason, he is not included in the gallery.

 urlLink Medical History of American Presidents This tabulates the little-known illnesses of America's chief executives. It is copiously referenced. As a librarian and scholar, I appreciate that. From the site: Constitutional crises have not occurred with the eight Presidential deaths in our history. Why? Because the Constitution provides for transfer of power to the Vice President, and because death is unambiguous and permanent. By contrast, only luck has prevented a Constitutional crisis arising from Presidential illness. Our laws leave most matters of Presidential illness ambiguous. Although the 25th amendment to the Constitution defines what happens after a President is deemed incapacitated by illness, no law defines such illness, or when or how or by whom the medical evaluation for such an illness is performed. Tour this website, and note the heavy burden of disease that has afflicted our presidents. Recent presidents are no exception. We have been very lucky indeed. The problem of Presidential illness needs wider discussion. By gathering, in one place, all the medical aspects of our Presidents' lives, I hope to put some urgency behind the discussion, to remind people that serious illness has visited the White House in the past, and will do so again -- unpredictably.

 urlLink The Presidents of the United States Offers a short history of the U.S. Presidency, along with biographical sketches and portraits of all the presidents to date.

Sidey (contributing author), published by the White House Historical Association with the cooperation of the National Geographic Society.

 urlLink Abraham Lincoln This is an excellent brief biography of President Abraham Lincoln. It is from urlLink USA Presidents . From the site: Abraham Lincoln ( February 12 , 1809 - April 15 , 1865 ) was the 16th ( 1861 - 1865 ) President of the United States , and the first President from the Republican Party . He is well praised for successfully restoring the federal unity of the nation by defeating the secessionist Confederate States of America and along the way, playing in an important role in ending chattel slavery in the United States. However, a number of states' rights supporters continue to view Lincoln as a tyrant who suspended civil liberties and suppressed the "legitimate right" to secede. Born on February 12 , 1809 , in Kentucky , he moved at a young age to the area near Springfield, Illinois . He served as a captain in the U.S. Army during the Black Hawk War . He later tried his hand at several business and political ventures. Lincoln served four terms in the Illinois State Legislature, was twice elected to Congress (1847 and 1849) and had a successful law practice in Illinois both before and after his two terms in the House of Representatives. It is commonly held that Lincoln had turbulent mood swings alternating between grandiosity and depression, which greatly moderated after his marriage to Mary Todd Lincoln in 1842. First elected to the House of Representatives , Lincoln spent most of his time in Washington, DC alone and made less than a spectacular impression on his fellow politicians. During his unsuccessful campaign for the United States Senate against Stephen A. Douglas , it was Lincoln's well-known gift of oratory that brought public support to an otherwise unimpressive candidate. Lincoln debated Douglas in a series of events which represented a national discussion on the issues that were about to split the nation in two. The Lincoln/Douglas debates presaged the Presidential election of 1860 , in which Douglas and Lincoln were once again opponents.

 urlLink George Herbert Walker Bush (Penguin Lives) This biography is by Tom Wicker. From the book description: No one is more qualified to give a fully rounded, objective portrait of our forty-first president than Tom Wicker. A political correspondent for The New York Times for more than thirty years, Wicker was a first-hand witness to and reporter of George H. W. Bush’s political rise and presidential reign. In George Herbert Walker Bush, Wicker provides a richly drawn and succinct overview of Bush from his New England roots, his decorated service in World War II, and his successful oil businesses to his shift to politics and rapid rise within the Republican party. As he describes changes within the Republican party in recent decades, Wicker charts Bush’s career, including in-depth analysis of his campaign tactics and his gift for creating friendships and inspiring loyalty which, Wicker argues, has been the key to Bush’s success. The result is a fascinating, timely glimpse into one of the most powerful families in America today, complete with insights into the current reign of George W. Bush, the continued legacy of the Bush family, and contemporary American politics.

 urlLink God and Ronald Reagan : A Spiritual Life This book is by Paul Kengor. From the book description: Ronald Reagan is hailed today for a presidency that restored optimism to America, engendered years of economic prosperity, and helped bring about the fall of the Soviet Union. Yet until now little attention has been paid to the role Reagan's personal spirituality played in his political career, shaping his ideas, bolstering his resolve, and ultimately compelling him to confront the brutal -- and, not coincidentally, atheistic -- Soviet empire. In this groundbreaking book, political historian Paul Kengor draws upon Reagan's legacy of speeches and correspondence, and the memories of those who knew him well, to reveal a man whose Christian faith remained deep and consistent throughout his more than six decades in public life. Raised in the Disciples of Christ Church by a devout mother with a passionate missionary streak, Reagan embraced the church after reading a Christian novel at the age of eleven. A devoted Sunday-school teacher, he absorbed the church's model of "practical Christianity" and strived to achieve it in every stage of his life. But it was in his lifelong battle against communism -- first in Hollywood, then on the political stage -- that Reagan's Christian beliefs had their most profound effect. Appalled by the religious repression and state-mandated atheism of Bolshevik Marxism, Reagan felt called by a sense of personal mission to confront the USSR. Inspired by influences as diverse as C.S. Lewis, Whittaker Chambers, and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, he waged an openly spiritual campaign against communism, insisting that religious freedom was the bedrock of personal liberty. "The source of our strength in the quest for human freedom is not material, but spiritual," he said in his Evil Empire address. "And because it knows no limitation, it must terrify and ultimately triumph over those who would enslave their fellow man." From a church classroom in 1920s Dixon, Illinois, to his triumphant mission to Moscow in 1988, Ronald Reagan was both political leader and spiritual crusader. God and Ronald Reagan deepens immeasurably our understanding of how these twin missions shaped his presidency -- and changed the world.

 urlLink The Tennessee Presidents Trust - Welcome Contains historical information on all U.S. Presidents with a focus on those from Tennessee as well as a directory of presidential resources on the web. From the site: Tennessee's three Presidents of the United States--Andrew Jackson, James K. Polk, and Andrew Johnson--have left behind an important and fascinating legacy for all Tennesseans to know, remember, and preserve. To further those objectives the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, established the Tennessee Presidents Center in 1987. There the editors of the three presidential papers projects transcribe, research, annotate, and publish a significant portion of the documentary history of the United States during the first three quarters of the nineteenth century. In 1989 friends of the Center have created the Tennessee Presidents Trust to assist in building statewide awareness and support for its work--as well as to foster a greater appreciation of the Tennessee Presidents' legacy to American democracy. The Trust is comprised of an twenty-one member Board of Governors, some one hundred Area Electors, and over eight hundred distiguished community leaders from across the state. Members support the work of the Tennessee Presidents Trust in three areas: Research Publications: To date, the three editorial projects have published 29 volumes of documents. Each of the projects has received prestigious research grants from both the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Historical Publications and Records Commission. Educational Programs: In addition to the video, "Voices for Union," the Trust has developed a special curriculum package, entitled the Tennessee Presidents Portfolio, for use in middle schools throughout the state. The Trust also distributes periodic newsletters detailing the Center's editorial work and publishes occasional pamphlets highlighting the Presidents public careers. Commemorative Activities: Special Trust events heighten public awareness of the three Presidents and provide occasions for members to celebrate the heritage of the American presidency in Tennessee. Commemorative activities on the birthdays of the Presidents and other local celebrations of Tennessee's Presidential heritage will be sponsored in the future.

 urlLink Andrew Johnson This is a good biography of President Andrew Johnson. It is from urlLink USA Presidents . From the site: Andrew Johnson ( December 29 , 1808 - July 31 , 1875 ) was the sixteenth Vice President ( 1865 ) and the seventeenth ( 1865 - 1869 ) President of the United States , succeeding to the presidency upon the assassination of Abraham Lincoln . Johnson presided over the Reconstruction of the United States following the American Civil War , and his conciliatory policies towards the defeated rebels and his vetoes of civil rights bills embroiled him in a bitter dispute with the radical faction of Congress, leading the House of Representatives to impeach him in 1868 , becoming the first President to be impeached; William Jefferson Clinton was the second President to be impeached. He was subsequently acquitted by a single vote in the Senate . Early political career Johnson was a Representative and a Senator from Tennessee and a Vice President and 17th President of the United States. He was born in Raleigh, North Carolina on December 29 , 1808 . He was self-educated. At the age of 13 he was apprenticed to a tailor.

 urlLink Ronald Reagan: An American Life This is Ronald Reagan's autobiography. Although I am sure there is a ghostwriter here, the book clearly help me make a connection with President Reagan. From the book description: In this remarkable autobiography, Ronald Reagan presents a definitive personal account of his historic presidency. With uncompromising candor, modesty, and wit, he tells the story of his life -- public and private -- and reveals the events that shaped his reluctant candidacy and the decision-making process that led to his first nomination; the unseen dangers of Gorbachev's first visit to America; startling facts about top-secret meetings involving heads of state; his frustrations with Congress; and his relationships with the members of his Cabinet. Here are the behind-the-scenes details of the great themes and dramatic crises marking Reagan's eight years in office, from Lebanon to Grenada, from the struggle to achieve arms control to tax reform, and his unprecedented personal diplomacy with major foreign leaders. His narrative is full of new insights and often surprising revelations regarding his innermost feelings about life in the White House, the assassination attempt, his family -- and the enduring love between him and his wife Nancy. An American Life is an inspiring American success story, a brilliant self-portrait, and a compelling and significant work of history.

 urlLink The Hornet's Nest: A Novel of the Revolutionary War This is Jimmy Carter's fiction book about the Revolutionary War in the South. I have read through it and I am impressed that President Carter can write well and like a romance novel writer at the same time. From the book description: The first work of fiction by a President of the United States -- a sweeping novel of the American South and the War of Independence In his ambitious and deeply rewarding novel, Jimmy Carter brings to life the Revolutionary War as it was fought in the Deep South; it is a saga that will change the way we think about the conflict. He reminds us that much of the fight for independence took place in that region and that it was a struggle of both great and small battles and of terrible brutality, with neighbor turned against neighbor, the Indians' support sought by both sides, and no quarter asked or given. The Hornet's Nest follows a cast of characters and their loved ones on both sides of this violent conflict -- including some who are based on the author's ancestors. At the heart of the story is Ethan Pratt, who in 1766 moves with his wife, Epsey, from Philadelphia to North Carolina and then to Georgia in 1771, in the company of Quakers. On their homesteads in Georgia, Ethan and his wife form a friendship with neighbors Kindred Morris and his wife, Mavis. Through Kindred and his young Indian friend Newota, Ethan learns about the frontier and the Native American tribes who are being continually pressed farther inland by settlers. As the eight-year war develops, Ethan and Kindred find themselves in life-and-death combat with oppos- ing forces. With its moving love story, vivid action, and the suspense of a war fought with increasing ferocity and stealth, The Hornet's Nest is historical fiction at its best, in the tradition of such major classics as The Last of the Mohicans.

 urlLink U.S. Presidents and the Bible Offers quotes from past U.S. Presidents on what they thought about the bible. Although there is not a lot of analysis, the collections of quotes is impressive. From the site: The reverence for God of many of our presidents, coupled with the principles of liberty established in the Holy Bible, has provided the basis upon which the United States has been founded. It is as true today as it was centuries ago when the psalmist wrote, "Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord" (Psalm 32:12). The nation that honors and reverences God will experience His blessings of protection, provision and peace. I find it very interesting that while today they talk about separation of church and state, these men who led our country knew none of it. "Whereas today we have a separation of church and state, then there was a union.... Religion, virtue, statehood and citizenship were very much united." --Herb London The American people are on the whole an industrious lot. Lyman Abbot, a preacher in the 1805, said: "A nation is made great not by its fruitful acres but the men who cultivate them; not by its great forests but by the men who use them; not by its mines but by the men who build and run them. America was a great land when Columbus discovered it. Americans have made it a great nation."

 urlLink Ulysses S. Grant This is a nice biography of the life of President Grant. It is from urlLink USA Presidents .

At the age of 17, he received a cadetship to the United States Military Academy at West Point , New York through his Congressman . The Congressman erroneously registered him as Ulysses S. Grant, and as such he is thus known. He graduated from West Point in 1843 , No. 21 in a class of 39. He married Julia Boggs Dent ( 1826 - 1902 ) on August 22 , 1843 and they had four children: Frederick Dent, Ulysses Simpson, Jr., Ellen Wrenshall, and Jesse Root.

 urlLink James Garfield This is an excellent biography of President Garfield. It is from urlLink USA Presidents . From the site: James Abram Garfield ( November 19 , 1831 - September 19 , 1881 ) was the 20th ( 1881 ) President of the United States , the first left-handed President, and the second U.S. President to be assassinated .

Even before admission to the bar, he entered politics, becoming an Ohio state senator in 1859 , serving until 1861 . He was an enthusiastic Republican all his political life. He noteably found a proof for the Pythagorean Theorem in 1876 .

 urlLink The Real Jimmy Carter: How Our Worst Ex-President Undermines American Foreign Policy, Coddles Dictators and Created the Party of Clinton and Kerry This book is by Steven F. Haywar. As you can tell by the title, this book rips into the post-presidency years of Jimmy Carter. I know that mots people consider him to be a model ex-president... From the book description: Jimmy Carter: America's best ex-president? Only if you're not bothered by the resurgence of Islamic fundamentalist terrorism (which started on his watch), the shamefaced foreign policy of Bill Clinton and John Kerry (ditto), and think that ex-presidents should travel the world coddling dictators and bad-mouthing America à la Jesse Jackson. Jimmy Carter has been given a free ride from the liberal media, liberal historians, and even the American people, who excuse his political delinquencies and disasters on the grounds that he is a "good" man. But as bank robber Willie Sutton said of Carter: "I've never seen a bigger confidence man in my life, and I've been around some of the best in the business." It's time to set the record straight. Finally, an honest historian-Steven F. Hayward, author of The Age of Reagan-demolishes the myth of "Saint" Jimmy and exposes how he created today's leftist Democratic party of John Kerry and Hillary Clinton. Jimmy Carter's laundry list of failures aren't just accidents of history: They're rooted in Carter's deeply flawed character and ideology-a smugly pious arrogance matched with a profound distrust of America. The Real Jimmy Carter reveals: • Carter as meddling ex-president: Why a Time magazine columnist wrote that some of Carter's "Lone Ranger work has taken him dangerously close to the neighborhood of what we used to call treason" • How Carter befriended North Korea during the Clinton administration, appeasing the communist regime and giving it cover for its nuclear weapons program • How Carter made direct contacts with Soviet officials to try to subvert President Reagan's anti-communist policies • The shocking extent of Carter's clandestine efforts to sabotage the first Gulf War in 1990 and how he used Gulf War II to publicly question the Christian faith of America's commander in chief • How Carter befriended Yasir Arafat-making himself an enemy of Israel • Carter as politician: a vicious campaigner-and even race-baiter • The Carter White House during the disasters of the Sandinista takeover of Nicaragua, the energy crisis and stagflation, the Iranian revolution and hostage crisis, and the invasion of Afghanistan • How Carter, the failed president, remade himself as Carter the humanitarian and freelance foreign policy critic of America • How a Nobel official inadvertently revealed that Carter's Nobel Prize was actually meant as a slap at America The Real Jimmy Carter is a shocker, showing why the peanut president should never have left his farm.

 urlLink The Presidency of Gerald R. Ford (American Presidency Series) This biography is by John Robert Greene. From the book description: This is the first comprehensive study of one of our most popular yet most misunderstood presidents. Reaching well beyond the image of Ford as "healer" of a war-torn and scandal-ridden nation, John Robert Greene extends and revises our understanding of Ford's struggles to restore credibility to the presidency in the wake of Watergate and Vietnam. Few presidents had ever been asked to achieve so much in so little time against such great adversity. Greene shows that Ford's efforts to lead the nation were severely hampered by Nixon's misdeeds, by America's ignominious disengagement from an unpopular war, and by a watchdog Congress eager to put a brake on presidential power. Working from a wealth of recently declassified documents, Greene reveals new evidence on Ford's roles in Watergate and challenges the prevailing view of the infamous Mayaguez incident. He argues persuasively that Ford made no "deal" with Nixon, but that his pardon of Nixon was costly nonetheless, for it shadowed his entire presidency thereafter. He also shows that the Mayaguez catastrophe was less a simple "rescue mission" than it was an attempt to revive sagging political fortunes by attacking Cambodia. In addition, Greene details Ford's rise to prominence within the Republican Party; chronicles the president's problematic relations with his staff, the new Democratic Congress, and Ronald Reagan; sheds new light on the selection and performance of Vice-President Nelson Rockefeller; offers new insights into the election of 1976; and provides the first in-depth look at Ford's Amnesty Program for Vietnam Era Draft Evaders. Based on interviews with Ford and more than sixty individuals who figured prominently in his presidency and on extensive use of the Ford Library, Greene's study illuminates Ford's valiant efforts during some of the presidency's most troubled years.

 urlLink President Chester A. Arthur State Historic Sites - www.HistoricVermont.org Describes the historic childhood home of Chester Arthur in Fairfield, Vermont. From the site: While many Americans remember Calvin Coolidge as “the President from Vermont,” most forget that another of our Chief Executives hailed from the Green Mountain State. Vermont’s “other President” was Chester Alan Arthur. Both Coolidge and Arthur were born in small farming communities and both, as Republican U.S. Vice Presidents, succeeded to the Presidency upon the death of the incumbents. Like many of their contemporaries, both men left their native state to attain political prominence. Some mystery surrounds the early years of Chester A. Arthur. The most frequently asked question is “Where was he born?” The President Arthur State Historic Site is a 1953 recreation of the second house in which Arthur lived as an infant. The confusion stems from the fact that Arthur himself told people that his birthyear was 1830 (it was actually 1829). The building in which he was born was actually a primitive cabin hastily erected in the village of Fairfield. The Baptist Congregation later completed the parsonage where the family moved shortly after the birth of the future president. It was this parsonage which was reconstructed by the State of Vermont. The granite monument, dedicated in 1903, is situated on a small plot of land presented to the State of Vermont by P.B.B. Northrop. At that time it was believed this was the location of the birthplace of Chester Arthur. In 1950 the State of Vermont purchased the land around the monument and the present building was recreated in 1953 using as a guide an old photograph of the house which stood on this site.

It is from USA President. urlLink From the site: Stephen Grover Cleveland ( March 18 , 1837 - June 24 , 1908) was the 22nd ( 1885 - 1889 ) and 24th ( 1893 - 1897 ) President of the United States , and the only president to serve two non-consecutive terms. One of nine children of a Presbyterian minister, Cleveland was born in Caldwell, New Jersey in 1837 . He was raised in upstate New York . As a lawyer in Buffalo , he became notable for his single-minded concentration upon whatever task faced him. At 44, he emerged into a political prominence that carried him to the White House in three years. Running as a reformer, he was elected Mayor of Buffalo in 1881 , and later, Governor of New York . Cleveland won the Presidency with the combined support of Democrats and reform Republicans , the "Mugwumps," who disliked the record of his opponent James Blaine of Maine . A bachelor , Cleveland was ill at ease at first with all the comforts of the White House. "I must go to dinner," he wrote a friend, "but I wish it was to eat a pickled herring, a Swiss cheese and a chop at Louis' instead of the French stuff I shall find." In June 1886 Cleveland married 21-year-old Frances Folsom ; he was the first President to be married while in office, and only President to be married in the White House . Cleveland vigorously pursued a policy barring special favors to any economic group. Vetoing a bill to appropriate $10,000 to distribute seed grain among drought-stricken farmers in Texas , he wrote: "Federal aid in such cases encourages the expectation of paternal care on the part of the Government and weakens the sturdiness of our national character. . . .

 urlLink Nixon, Ford and the Abandonment of South Vietnam This book is by J. Edward Lee and H. C. Haynsworth. From the book description: South Vietnam fell because of events occurring thousands of miles away from the battlefields—in China, the Soviet Union, Latin America, the Middle East, and Washington's corridors of power, along protest lines, and around America's dinner tables. These other wars being fought by American presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford profoundly impacted what happened in Vietnam. This work examines those other conflicts and the political, social, and economic factors involved with them that distracted and crippled the presidencies of Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford and led to the eventual abandonment of the U.S.-supported South Vietnamese regime. Nixon entered office with the goal of bringing the world together, but saw that goal ruined by the 1973 war in the Middle East, preoccupations with China and the Soviet Union, a weak economy, Watergate, and his disgraceful exit from the White House. Ford's presidency was tainted almost from the beginning because of the pardon he granted to Nixon, but the American public, tired of war and concerned about the economy, was ready to hear that the war had come to an end. An argument is presented that the war could have been won if the "other wars" had been fought by presidents willing to honor the American commitment to its allies in South Vietnam.

 urlLink Richard M. Nixon (United States Presidents) This book is by Michael A. Schuman. It is aimed at middle school aged children. From a School Library Journal Review : Schuman opens with an account of Nixon's historic trip to China in 1972 and then covers his life, both personal and public, in chronological order. The author makes an obvious effort to be objective about his subject, admiring his ambition, perseverance, and stamina, but he also describes the man's flaws and weaknesses and gives readers a complete overview of the Watergate scandal. The final chapter discusses Nixon's legacy, drawing on both the positive and negative assessments of the historians who continue to debate his place in history. The author provides some background information and uses primary sources to give readers additional details. Average-quality black-and-white photos and reproductions of source documents add to the text. This book includes both the final years of Nixon's life and the continuing reassessments of his career in the years since his death that are not found in older titles. However, Rachel Barron's Richard Nixon (Morgan Reynolds, 1998) offers more detail and a better examination of how Nixon's personality shaped his long and eventful career.-

 urlLink LT(JG) George Bush, USNR This is an article about the first President Bush. It focuses on Bush's navel career and tells why he received the Distinguished Flying Cross. From the site: Upon hearing of the Pearl Harbor attack, while a student at Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., George Bush decided he wanted to join the Navy to become an aviator. Six months later, after graduation, he enlisted in the Navy on his 18th birthday and began preflight training at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. After completing the 10-month course, he was commissioned as an ensign in the U.S. Naval Reserve on 9 June 1943, several days before his 19th birthday; making him the youngest naval aviator then. After finishing flight training, he was assigned to Torpedo Squadron (VT-51) as photographic officer in September 1943. As part of Air Group 51, his squadron was based on USS San Jacinto in the spring of 1944. San Jacinto was part of Task Force 58 that participated in operations against Marcus and Wake Islands in May, and then in the Marianas during June. On 19 June, the task force triumphed in one of the largest air battles of the war. During the return of his aircraft from the mission, Ensign Bush's aircraft made a forced water landing. The destroyer, USS Clarence K. Bronson, rescued the crew, but the plane was lost. On 25 July, Ensign Bush and another pilot received credit for sinking a small cargo ship. After Bush was promoted to Lieutenant Junior Grade on 1 August, San Jacinto commenced operations against the Japanese in the Bonin Islands. On 2 September 1944, Bush piloted one of four aircraft from VT-51 that attacked the Japanese installations on Chi Chi Jima. For this mission his crew included Radioman Second Class John Delaney, and Lieutenant Junior Grade William White, USNR, who substituted for Bush's regular gunner. During their attack, four TBM Avengers from VT-51 encountered intense antiaircraft fire. While starting the attack, Bush's aircraft was hit and his engine caught on fire. He completed his attack and released the bombs over his target scoring several damaging hits. With his engine on fire, Bush flew several miles from the island, where he and one other crew member on the TBM Avenger bailed out of the aircraft. However, the other man's chute did not open and he fell to his death. It was never determined which man bailed out with Bush. Both Delaney and White were killed in action. While Bush anxiously waited four hours in his inflated raft, several fighters circled protectively overhead until he was rescued by the lifeguard submarine, USS Finback. For this action, Bush received the Distinguished Flying Cross. During the month he remained on Finback, Bush participated in the rescue of other pilots.

 urlLink Habitat for Humanity Int'l -- Jimmy Carter and Habitat Describes the Jimmy Carter Work Project (JCWP) for Habitat for Humanity. The 2002 JCWP in Africa is the largest home-building effort in the history of the 18-year-old event. No matter what you think of the politics and performance in office of President Carter, this is impressive. From the site: As President of the United States, Jimmy Carter was deeply committed to social justice and basic human rights. He and his wife Rosalynn left the White House in search of meaningful ways to contribute in these areas. In addition to promoting peace and human rights through the nonprofit Carter Center in Atlanta, they lead the Jimmy Carter Work Project (JCWP) for Habitat for Humanity International (HFHI) one week each year. Jimmy Carter Work Project Jimmy Carter's involvement with Habitat for Humanity International began in 1984 when the former president led a work group to New York City to help renovate a six-story building with 19 families in need of decent, affordable shelter. That experience planted the seed, and the Jimmy Carter Work Project has been an internationally recognized event of HFHI ever since. Each year, Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter give a week of their time -- along with their building skills -- to build homes and raise awareness of the critical need for affordable housing. The JCWP is held at a different location each year, and attracts volunteers from around the world. The Carters and more than 4,000 volunteers built 92 houses in Anniston, Ala., and LaGrange and Valdosta, Ga., during JCWP 2003. The 2002 JCWP took place in Africa. One thousand houses were built in 18 countries, with the final 100 houses constructed in a five-day build in Durban, South Africa. In 2001, JCWP built 136 houses at six sites across South Korea with more than 9,000 volunteers participating from around the world. Other recent JCWP builds have taken place in New York-Florida-Georgia (2000--157 houses), the Philippines (1999--293 houses) and Houston, Texas (1998--100 houses). JCWP 2004 is scheduled for two sites in Mexico -- Puebla and Veracruz -- Oct. 24 - 29, 2004.

 urlLink U.S. presidential election, 1980 In honor of President Reagan who was buried today, I have blogged an article at Wikipedia on the 1980 Presidential election. This is the election that brought Ronald Reagan to power. From the site: Toward the beginning of the race, the party favorite was George Bush, the former director of the Central Intelligence Agency and chairman of the Republican National Committee. However, in the initial debates, Ronald Reagan emerged as a serious candidate, sparring with Bush on economic issues. Reagan was an adherant to a policy known as "supply side economics." Supply-side economists led the assault on the welfare state built up by the New Deal and Great Society. They assumed that the woes of the US economic were in large part a result of excessive taxation (de-emphasizing the role of high foreign policy, the rise of overseas competition, and massive expenditures on Vietnam), which "crowded out" money away from private investors and thus stifled economic growth. The solution, they argued, was to offer generous benefits to corporations and wealthy taxpayers in order to encourage new investments and to cut benefits geared toward the poor. Reagan promised an economic revival that would affect all sectors of the population. But since cutting taxes would reduce government revenues, it would also be necessary to target "big government." Otherwise, large federal deficits might negate the effects of the tax cut by requiring the government to borrow in the marketplace, thus raising interest rates and drying up capital for investment once again. Thus, Reagan promised a drastic cut in "big government," which he pledged would produce a balanced budget for the first time since 1969. Bush famously called Reagan's economic policy "voodoo economics." Bush won the Iowa caucuses, and Reagan won big in the New Hampshire primary, causing most of the other candidates to drop out of the race. Anderson dropped out of the primary, running an independent bid. Reagan went on to win most of the subsequent primaries and caucuses, securing the Republican Party nomination. There was wide speculation that Reagan would ask Gerald Ford to be his running mate, but instead Reagan chose Bush.

 urlLink Ulysses S. Grant Home Page A look at the life of Ulysses S. Grant that includes many photographs, articles and information on the varied aspects of his life - including the Civil War, early life and presidency. From the site: This website contains 200 pages of images, text and information on Ulysses S. Grant. Grant was an outstanding military figure and the savior of the Union during the Civil War, as well as the 18th President of the United States from 1869-77. Unfortunately, Grant has been profoundly misunderstood in popular culture. Often portrayed as a slovenly drunkard, he was actually a modest and moral man, uncommonly devoted to his wife and children. He was an author of unusual ability and his Memoirs are widely regarded as one of the great books written in the English language. He was also a complex individual with uncommon virtues. We invite you to explore Ulysses S. Grant, a man whose abilities are still misunderstood and underrated. His accomplishments and courage were rare, his personal integrity unmatched. The information here will start you on an odyssey in discovering Grant as a General, as a human being and as a great American.

 urlLink Character Above All: Gerald Ford Essay This is an excerpt from an essay about President Ford. It is by James Cannon. It provides a brief look at the circumstances and events that molded the president's character. From the site: Gerald R. Ford became President not because he was popular with the American public, not because he campaigned for the job, but because of his character. More than any other president of this century, Ford was chosen for his integrity and trustworthiness; his peers in Congress put him in the White House because he told the truth and kept his word. He was nominated for Vice President after Spiro Agnew was forced to resign to avoid indictment for accepting bribes. Ford was confirmed by a House and Senate that expected him to replace a President who was also facing indictment for crimes...... Ford personified what Nixon was not. Ford was honest. He could be trusted. Throughout twenty-five years in the House of Representatives, Ford had proved himself to be a man of integrity. It was for that integrity that the highest powers of Congress, Democratic and Republican, chose Ford to be Vice President, knowing that Nixon's presidency was doomed...... Surely character begins at home, and in Ford's case we know for certain that it began with his mother. Dorothy Gardner Ford was a strong and resourceful woman whose own character was tested at the age of twenty. She grew up in a warm, loving family in a small town in northern Illinois where her father prospered as a businessman and served as town mayor. In college Dorothy met the brother of her roommate, and fell in love with him. Leslie King was the blond, blue-eyed, charming son of a wealthy Omaha banker who also owned a stage-coach line and a wool business. On their honeymoon she discovered that she had made a tragic mistake. Her new husband struck her, not once but repeatedly. When they reached Omaha, where they were to live with his family, she found out that King was not only brutal, but a liar and a drunk. His outward charm concealed a vicious temper...

 urlLink Andrew Johnson Biography from the North Carolina Encyclopedia . Johnson was born in NC, though he moved to Tennessee early in life. From the site: Andrew Johnson was born in Raleigh, North Carolina in 1808, and like the previous North Carolina born presidents, Andrew Jackson and James K. Polk, he was elected to office from Tennessee. Although a native of the South, Johnson was a firm supporter of the Union. During the desperate days of the Civil War, he served as the military governor of Tennessee and finally as vice-president under the second term of Abraham Lincoln. After Lincoln's assassination, the heavy task of restoring a nation after the ravages of a civil war fell to the tailor from North Carolina. Andrew Johnson began his life in a small wooden house which is still preserved in Raleigh at the Mordecai Historic Park. His parents, Jacob and Mary Johnson, maintained the home by working for Casso's Inn, a popular inn and stable. The Johnson home stood on the property of the inn. Both of Andrew's parents worked there--Mary as a weaver, Jacob as the hostler, while Jacob also acted as janitor for the State Capitol. Andrew was the younger of two sons born into the Johnson family. Jacob Johnson rescued two or three friends (recollections were unclear) from drowning in 1812, but the effort cost him his health, and he died within a year, leaving Mary to raise Andrew and his brother William. In an effort to provide a trade for her sons, Mary Johnson apprenticed her sons to a tailor in Raleigh when Andrew was fourteen. Andrew Johnson never attended school. He began his informal education while serving as an apprentice. Frequent customers would read to Johnson from books of oratory while he worked, and occasionally gave him books. Johnson taught himself to read. Two years after beginning his apprenticeship, Johnson and his friends threw rocks at a tradesman's house out of mischief. When the occupant of the house threatened to call the police, Johnson left town and abandoned his apprentice work at the tailor shop of John J. Selby. Johnson fled to Carthage, North Carolina sixty miles from Raleigh. He found a market for his tailoring skills in Carthage but moved to Laurens, South Carolina to distance himself further from the trouble in Raleigh. After a year in Laurens, Johnson returned to Raleigh and sought to complete his apprenticeship under John Selby. Selby, however, no longer owned the tailor shop and had no need of an apprentice. With no available employment in Raleigh, Johnson led his mother, brother, and stepfather to Tennessee in 1826.

 urlLink Thomas Jefferson Memorial Site about Jefferson from the National Park service. Include details on monuments and memorials. From the site: THOMAS JEFFERSON - political philosopher, architect, musician, book collector, scientist, horticulturist, diplomat, inventor, and third President of the United States - looms large in any discussion of what Americans are as a people. Jefferson left to the future not only ideas but also a great body of practical achievements. President John F. Kennedy recognized Jefferson's accomplishments when he told a gathering of American Nobel Prize winners that they were the greatest assemblage of talent in the White House since Jefferson had dined there alone. With his strong beliefs in the rights of man and a government derived from the people, in freedom of religion and the separation between church and state, and in education available to all, Thomas Jefferson struck a chord for human liberty 200 years ago that resounds through the decades. But in the end, Jefferson's own appraisal of his life, and the one that he wrote for use on his own tombstone, suffices:"Author of the Declaration of American Independence, of the Statute of Virginia for religious freedom, and Father of the University of Virginia."

 urlLink Andrew Jackson - The Worst President The Cherokee Ever Met Andrew Jackson is often considered one of the best American Presidents ever. However, the Cherokee feel a little differently... From the site: The title of worst US president is hotly debated and is most often awarded to Andrew Johnson or Warren Harding. Many polls and studies rank Andrew Jackson in or near the top 10 best presidents. However, to many Cherokees Andrew Jackson is without a doubt the worst US president. Some Cherokees would rather carry two ten-dollar bills or twenty one-dollar bills than carry a single twenty-dollar bill. Why? Because the US has chosen to commemerate Jackson's presidency by putting his face on the twenty dollar bill. So why is Jackson so disliked by the Cherokee? Oddly enough, at one point the Cherokee were allies with Andrew Jackson. It was at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend where Andrew Jackson's famous story really began. He was considered a hero after his victory in this battle against the Creek Indians, a victory he would not have attained had it not been for his Cherokee allies who fought alongside him. Several years later in 1828 Andrew Jackson was elected president. His popularity and subsequent election are largely attributed to his pro-Indian removal platform. Once in power he began to allow whites to move onto Cherokee land. He also allowed Georgia to extend state law to include the Cherokee Nation. This called into question Cherokee sovereignty and declared their government and laws void. In 1830 Congress passed the Indian Removal Act. Gold had been discovered on what was Cherokee land in western Georgia and the white settlers wanted to get the Cherokee out of the way. In Jackson's own words, "[The Indian Removal Act] will place a dense and civilized population in large tracts of country now occupied by a few savage hunters." Jackson painted a picture of the Cherokee as illiterate, uncivilized "savage hunters" even though 90% of the Cherokee Nation could read and write in Cherokee (many could also read and write in English) and were farmers.

 urlLink Herbert Hoover: Iowa Farm Boy and Humanitarian Classroom-ready lesson plan follows the President from his boyhood days to his role as administrator of Belgian Relief Commission during World War I. From the site: Although some people remember Herbert Hoover as the man who was President during the early years of the Great Depression, others may know him as a complex public servant, the "Great Humanitarian" whose career spanned a remarkable seven decades. A graduate of Stanford University, Hoover became a successful mining engineer before organizing relief programs for the starving victims of World War I. As Secretary of Commerce under Presidents Harding and Coolidge, he helped to create safer highways and aircraft, better health care for children, and the standardization of commercial products. And, in 1927, he mustered a fleet of 600 boats and 60 airplanes to rescue 325,000 Americans who were left homeless during the catastrophic Mississippi River flood. Following World War II, President Truman chose him to help the hungry people of Europe once again, and he spent his "retirement" years as an amazingly prolific author, speaker, and government adviser. Continuing his life-long desire to help needy children, he also served as chairman of the Boys' Clubs of America, helping to open 500 new chapters throuhgout the United States.

 urlLink Woodrow Wilson This is a short and very readable biography of President Wilson. It is from urlLink USA Presidents . From the site: Dr. Thomas Woodrow Wilson ( December 28 , 1856 – February 3 , 1924 ) was the 28th ( 1913 - 1921 ) President of the United States . He was the second Democrat to serve two consecutive terms in the White House after Andrew Jackson. Wilson was born in Staunton, Virginia , with ancestry in Strabane , Northern Ireland . He grew up in Augusta, Georgia . Wilson attended Davidson College for one year and then transferred to Princeton University , graduating in 1879 .He was a member of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternal organization . Afterward, Wilson studied law at the University of Virginia for one year. After completing and publishing his dissertation, Congressional Government, in 1886 , he received his Ph.D. in political science from Johns Hopkins University . Wilson remains the only American president to have earned a doctoral degree. Academic career Wilson served on the faculties of Bryn Mawr College and Wesleyan University before joining the Princeton faculty as professor of jurisprudence and political economy in 1890 . A popular teacher and respected scholar, Wilson delivered an oration at Princeton's sesquicentennial celebration ( 1896 ) entitled "Princeton in the Nation's Service." In this famous speech, he outlined his vision of the university in a democratic nation, calling on institutions of higher learning "to illuminate duty by every lesson that can be drawn out of the past." Woodrow Wilson was unanimously elected president of Princeton on June 9 , 1902 . In his inaugural address as Princeton's president, Wilson developed these themes, attempting to strike a balance that would please both populists and aristocrats in the audience. As president, Wilson began a fund-raising campaign to bolster the university corporation. The curriculum guidelines he developed during his tenure as president of Princeton proved among the most important innovations in the field of higher education. He instituted the now common system of core requirements followed by two years of concentration in a selected area. When he attempted to curtail the influence of the elitist "social clubs," however, Wilson met with resistance from trustees and potential donors. He believed the system was smothering the intellectual and moral life of the undergraduates. Opposition from wealthy and powerful alumni further convinced Wilson of the undesirability of exclusiveness and moved him towards a more populist position in his politics.

 urlLink Indiana Territorial Governor William Henry Harrison (1773 - 1841) This provides a short biography and portrait. It focuses on Harrison's role in Indiana government. From the site: WILLIAM HENRY HARRISON was born in Virginia, the son of Benjamin Harrison, who was himself a governor of Virginia and one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence. Educated at Hampden-Sidney College, the young Harrison entered medical school but was forced to leave in 1791 when his father died. From 1792 to 1794 Harrison was Anthony Wayne's aide-de-camp in battles against the Miami Indians, and he was promoted to captain in 1797. Harrison was appointed secretary of the Northwest Territory on June 26,1798, and in 1799 was elected a territorial delegate to Congress, where he served until May, 1800, when he was appointed governor of the Indiana Territory, an area that initially included all of the original Northwest Territory except Ohio. The twenty-seven-year-old Harrison was to serve as governor of Indiana Territory for twelve years. His dual responsibilities to secure justice for the Indians and to acquire Indian land were often contradictory, but his administration was generally able and honest. With full powers of appointment to office, Harrison was conscientious in seeking out local recommendations for appointees and encouraging the development of representative government in the new territory. During his governorship his military career was enhanced when he defeated the Prophet at Tippecanoe in 1811. He was given command of the Army of the Northwest in the fall of 1812 and resigned as governor a few months later. His forces decisively defeated the British at the Battle of the Thames in 1813. Harrison served as representative to Congress from Ohio from 1816 to 1819, and was elected to one term in the Ohio legislature in 1819. In 1825 he was sent to the United States Senate from the same state. He served as minister to Colombia from 1828 to 1829. Harrison ran for President as a Whig in 1836 and was defeated by Martin Van Buren, but he was victorious in the 1840 race. Harrison died on April 4, 1841, one month after his inauguration, the shortest term of any President in American history. Harrison, sometimes described as the "Washington of the West," was the grandfather of the twenty-third President of the United States, Benjamin Harrison. Source: Peat, Wilbur D.

 urlLink Amendment X: James Monroe, Views of the President of the United States on the Subject of Internal Improvements This is an article that was written by James Monroe's giving his opinion on the tenth amendment of the constitution. From the site: Having presented above a full view of all the powers granted to the United States, it will be proper to look to those remaining to the States. It is by fixing the great powers which are admitted to belong to each government that we may hope to come to a right conclusion respecting those in controversy between them. In regard to the National Government, this task was easy because its powers were to be found in specific grants in the Constitution; but it is more difficult to give a detail of the powers of the State governments, as their constitutions, containing all powers granted by the people not specifically taken from them by grants to the United States, can not well be enumerated. Fortunately, a precise detail of all the powers remaining to the State governments is not necessary in the present instance. A knowledge of their great powers only will answer every purpose contemplated, and respecting these there can be no diversity in opinion. They are sufficiently recognized and established by the Constitution of the United States itself. In designating the important powers of the State governments it is proper to observe, first, that the territory contemplated by the Constitution belongs to each State in its separate character and not to the United States in their aggregate character. Each State holds territory according to its original charter, except in cases where cessions have been made to the United States by individual States. The United States had none when the Constitution was adopted which had not been thus ceded to them and which they held on the conditions on which such cession had been made. Within the individual States it is believed that they held not a single acre; but if they did it was as citizens held it, merely as private property. The territory acquired by cession lying without the individual States rests on a different principle, and is provided for by a separate and distinct part of the Constitution. It is the territory within the individual States to which the Constitution in its great principles applies, and it applies to such territory as the territory of a State and not as that of the United States. The next circumstance to be attended to is that the people composing this Union are the people of the several States, and not of the United States in the full sense of a consolidated government. The militia are the militia of the several States; lands are held under the laws of the States; descents, contracts, and all the concerns of private property, the administration of justice, and the whole criminal code, except in the cases of breaches of the laws of the United States made under and in conformity with the powers vested in Congress and of the laws of nations, are regulated by State laws. This enumeration shows the great extent of the powers of the State governments. The territory and the people form the basis on which all governments are founded. The militia constitutes their effective force. The regulation and protection of property and of personal liberty are also among the highest attributes of sovereignty. This, without other evidence, is sufficient to show that the great office of the Constitution of the United States is to unite the States together under a Government endowed with powers adequate to the purposes of its institution, relating, directly or indirectly, to foreign concerns, to the discharge of which a National Government thus formed alone could be competent.

 urlLink William McKinley (1843-1901) This biography focuses on the Spanish-American War. It was written by Lauren Calone. From the site: William McKinley was born in Niles, Ohio, on January 29, 1843, the seventh child of William and Nancy McKinley. William briefly attended Allegheny College, and was teaching in a country school when the Civil War broke out. Following the war, he studied law, began practicing in Canton Ohio, and married Ida Saxton. At age 34, McKinley won a seat in Congress. He was appointed to the Ways and Means Committee. Those who served with him attest that in his votes, he often sided with the public and avoided private interests. During his 14-year tenure with the House, McKinley became a leading expert on tariffs. He later became governor of Ohio, serving two terms. As a congressman, governor and later, president, McKinley, a man of moderation and compromise, held firmly to two beliefs: favorable tariff to stimulate American business and limited coinage of silver. William McKinley was nominated as the Republican candidate for president with the assistance of Mark Hanna, a wealthy industrialist. Favoring tariffs as protection for prosperity for the nation and a limit on silver, he defeated William Jennings Bryan, whom many feared as a threat to the government in the election of 1892. As president, McKinley was converted to the idea of international bimetallism—an agreement of several countries to use both gold and silver as the basis for their currency. He later favored maintaining currency by using the gold standard, opening the way to passage of the Gold Standard Act of 1900.

 urlLink James Madison's Montpelier Home Page Virginia residence where Madison spent much of his life. Includes a look at the home's history and landscaping. From the site: In 1723 Ambrose Madison purchased 4,675 acres of land on the Virginia frontier, in an area that would later be known as Orange County. He wanted to start a tobacco plantation on this land, so he sent a handful of slaves to begin the long process of clearing the land, building a house, and building the other necessary fences, barns, and outbuildings. Ambrose, his wife Frances, and their children moved to their new plantation (which they called Mount Pleasant) in 1732. Soon after this Ambrose passed away, apparently the victim of poisoning. Frances ran the plantation until her oldest son, James Madison, was old enough to take over. James was an excellent farmer and businessman, and the plantation turned a good profit. In 1749 James married Nelly Conway, who in 1751 gave birth to James Madison, Jr., the future president. Around 1755 the Madisons began construction on a new home which was completed in approximately 1760. James Madison, Jr. was nine years old when his family moved into the new home which began as a simple eight room, brick house. Over the years it has gone through many changes. The first came in 1797 when James returned from Philadelphia with his new bride, Dolley. The house was too small to share with his parents, so a thirty-foot, four-room addition was added. A second front door was added, and for a short time the home was actually a duplex.

 urlLink Abraham Lincoln in Political Cartoons About 80 cartoons show the evolution of Lincoln's image from his first campaign for the presidency in 1860 through the Civil War to the early 1900s. Be warned, this site has some annoying pop ups! Turn on you pop up blocker before visiting. From the site: Abraham Lincoln is a mythic figure in the American psyche. He liberated the slaves and became a martyred president. The Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., played an important symbolic role in the modern civil rights movement. From its steps, with Lincoln looking down from the shadows behind, Martin Luther King gave his famous "I Have a Dream" speech in August 1963. Generations of American children have memorized Lincoln's November 19, 1863, Gettysburg Address, beginning "Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth, upon this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal," and ending with the stirring appeal "that this nation shall have a new birth of freedom; and that this government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth." Those words and the image of the thoughtful, bearded man, his face prematurely aged from years of terrible war, are what most Americans think of when they consider Abraham Lincoln today. It is a far cry from how his contemporaries saw him during his lifetime. Instead of "Four score and twenty," they often quoted him beginning statements with "That reminds me of a joke." Lincoln was the first person to bring the humor of the West to national politics. He frequently used humor to make a point. Diverging from speeches and conversations to tell a joke or relate an anecdote, he used "hoss sense," or the shared wisdom of the people, to garner support for his positions. In a 1915 study of the development of Western humor, Fred Lewis Pattee credited Lincoln with being the first person to put that emerging brand of humor into the national spotlight. "The saddest man in American history, he stands as one of the greatest of American humorists," Pattee wrote. "His laughter rings through the whole period of the war, man of sorrows though he was, and it was the Western laughter heard until now only along the great rivers and the frontier and the gold coast of the Pacific." Lincoln's frequent use of humor was noted in a number of the cartoons published during his presidency. Although "that reminds me of a joke" can be found in cartoons published throughout the war, Lincoln's image also evolved. When he was elected to the presidency in 1860, he was clean-shaven and very youthful in appearance. He began to grow a beard shortly after the election, and it and the signs of age caused by the war appear in later cartoons.

 urlLink John Kennedy's Vietnam Rhetoric This is an extensive review of the public rhetoric of Kennedy on Vietnam which concludes that he would have had an extremely difficult time withdrawing, given his public statements. From the site: Abstract: Pres Kennedy's rhetoric on the situation in Vietnam exemplifies the way in which presidents balance idealistic arguments, which apply principles of genus to public problem-solving, and pragmatic arguments, which emphasize the efficacy or practicality of politics. Kennedy legitimized his Vietnam policy through his idealistic appeals, casting himself as a principled leader, and deflected criticism and built an image of expertise through his pragmatic appeals. Full Text: In 1951, Congressman John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts set out for an extensive fact-finding mission to the Middle and Far East. Upon his return, Kennedy reiterated his support of western efforts to defend freedom in both regions. He claimed that if the West did not act upon this ideal, especially in Southeast Asia, that the Chinese Communists easily would dominate these countries.(1) At the same time, however, the Congressman clearly disagreed with the methods the French employed. For Kennedy, France's anachronistic colonialist mentality had blinded it to the nationalistic aspirations of the native peoples of the region. In a radio address upon his return, the Congressman explained the complexities of Southeast Asia and warned that these complexities called for particular policies. Kennedy presciently observed: The Indo-Chinese states are puppet states, French principalities with great resources but as typical examples of empire and colonialism as can be fond anywhere. To check the southern drive of Communism makes sense but not only through reliance on the force of arms. The task is, rather, to build strong native non-Communist sentiment within these areas and rely on that as a spearhead of defense. To do this apart from and in defiance of innately nationalistic aims spells foredoomed failure.(2) In the years that followed this speech, Kennedy claimed French and U.S. policy in Southeast Asia lacked practicality.(3) Nonetheless, he never failed to show support for the principle of freedom behind that policy. As he declared in 1956, "Vietnam represents the cornerstone of the Free World in Southeast Asia, the keystone to the arch, the finger in the dike."(4) In many ways, this early rhetoric foreshadowed John Kennedy's presidential rhetoric on Vietnam. From 1961 to 1963, President Kennedy invoked idealistic terms to encourage Americans to view the conflict there as one small part of the larger struggle between freedom and communism. According to the President, the United States had to do whatever was necessary to defend freedom's Vietnam. Alternately, Kennedy explained that the situation in Vietnam was quite complicated and unique because of that nation's particular history, government, logistics, and legal relationship with the U.S. In view of these complexities, the President held that the United States must pragmatically pursue very special policies in order to fulfill its mission in Vietnam.

From the site: Warren Gamaliel Harding ( November 2 , 1865 - August 2 , 1923 ) was the 29th ( 1921 - 1923 ) President of the United States and the sixth President to die in office. Harding was born in Blooming Grove, Morrow County , Ohio , November 2 , 1865 and graduated from Ohio Central College at Iberia. He was the first sitting Senator to be elected President . Before becoming a Senator, he was a newspaper publisher and Lieutenant Governor of Ohio. Harding was the oldest of six children; his boyhood heroes were Alexander Hamilton and Napoleon . His mother was a doctor. Prior to being President of the United States, Harding served as Ohio State Senator (1899-1903), Lieutenant Governor of Ohio (1903-1905), and U.S. Senator (1915-1921). As U.S. Senator, he had a terrible attendance record, missing over 2/3s of the roll-call votes, including the vote to send the 19th Amendment ( Women's Suffrage ) to the States for ratification. In 1889 (when he was 24) Harding suffered a nervous breakdown and spent several weeks in a sanitarium. Two years later he married Florence "Flossie" Mabel Kling DeWolfe, age 30, a divorcee with one son. Flossie was described as stubborn and old-fashioned. Five years older than he, she had pursued him persistently, until he reluctantly gave in. Her father opposed the marriage, warning her not to marry into "the black-blooded Harding family."

This university has been coeducational since 1870, but I do not believe it was on the basis of your accomplishments that a Detroit high school girl said, "In choosing a college, you first have to decide whether you want a coeducational school or an educational school." Well, we can find both here at Michigan, although perhaps at different hours. I came out here today very anxious to meet the Michigan student whose father told a friend of mine that his son's education had been a real value. It stopped his mother from bragging about him. I have come today from the turmoil of your Capital to the tranquility of your campus to speak about the future of your country. The purpose of protecting the life of our Nation and preserving the liberty of our citizens is to pursue the happiness of our people. Our success in that pursuit is the test of our success as a Nation. For a century we labored to settle and to subdue a continent. For half a century we called upon unbounded invention and untiring industry to create an order of plenty for all of our people. The challenge of the next half century is whether we have the wisdom to use that wealth to enrich and elevate our national life, and to advance the quality of our American civilization. Your imagination, your initiative, and your indignation will determine whether we build a society where progress is the servant of our needs, or a society where old values and new visions are buried under unbridled growth. For in your time we have the opportunity to move not only toward the rich society and the powerful society, but upward to the Great Society.

 urlLink FDR: Pacific Warlord Critical reappraisal of Roosevelt's policy in the far east, including his attitude towards Japanese-Americans and their internment. From the site: Well-nigh universal opinion holds that Franklin Roosevelt was the greatest president produced in twentieth century America, a perception grounded on his energetic battle against the Great Depression, his leadership in the last Good War, and his expert marketing of a genial personality. But proof of his actual achievements is more difficult to deliver because he was careful to leave little in the way of a paper trail. He kept control of his administration by making decisions from day to day, sponsoring bickering and rivalry among the bureaucrats, and using unofficial agents. He discouraged note taking at cabinets, and left no memoirs to enlighten us. There are worse ways to control a government, but it left critics free to charge him with major-league chicanery, i.e. guilty foreknowledge of Pearl Harbor, on the one hand, or to foist on him an enthusiasm for their own favorite causes. While his role in any particular policy or transaction is often hard to pin down, it is clear enough that FDRs grasp of the Pacific world was seriously flawed. Originally, he followed the prudent course of avoiding a Japanese war. for which the country was ill prepared, but eventually he had to face it, and suffer the Pearl Harbor disaster. Many of his ideas were out-of-date. The deep prejudice against Japanese of any stripe which allowed him to set up the Japanese Americans as scapegoats for Pearl Harbor was only one of his bizarre notions about races and peoples. As a self-appointed naval expert he was often a nuisance to his admirals, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff ran the Pacific war pretty much on their own. Because he seriously misjudged Chinese capabilities, FDR paved the way for the disillusionment of postwar years. He also misjudged Stalin. The country might have been better served had he been able to retire in 1943, when he had become seriously ill.

 urlLink Ronald Reagan and the Soviet Union Homepage Examines the final years of the Cold War, with a particular focus on Ronald Reagan's policy towards the Soviet Union. From the site: Undoubtedly, the foreign policy of the United States has been marked by its multi-faceted scope of intentions, policy shifts, and images throughout the last two centuries. Though it remains a relatively young country, it has been a major factor in weighing the balance of power in the world, during peacetime and in periods of war. Ronald Reagan, perhaps more than any other president of the United States, has shifted this balance of power to a point where the international community is no longer divided in two. This makes him, from a foreign policy perspective, one of the most interesting presidents in the history of the United States. As a result of the United States’ aspiration for independence and its desire to depart from European values and ideals, the Monroe doctrine came into existence in 1823. The policy of isolationism advocated by the doctrine, would create a diplomatic barrage between the United States and Europe which would last well into World War I. The isolationist policy enacted by the United States for over a century was then supplanted by the Truman doctrine in the aftermath of World War II, during a time when the Soviet military and political threat was becoming a reality. Now that the United States’ security interests were at stake, it was neither plausible, nor possible, to passively linger on. Containment through economic aid and direct military involvement in countries threatened by communist take-over was the result, and presaged the advent of the Cold War. The threat of nuclear war escalated, reaching its climax with the Cuban missile crisis. A few decades later, the Soviet Union’s nuclear capabilities succeeded that of the United States’, SALT II was a failure, and the domino effect assured the collapse of democracies around the world. Thus was the situation when Ronald Reagan assumed power in 1981. Immediately, though, the newly-initiated president took a much harder approach to communism. He was incredulous of containment policy[1], reluctant to negotiate treaties with the Soviet leaders on the basis of distrust, and, as opposed to former presidents, regarded the Cold War as winnable. This brought about the space programme SDI. His anti-Soviet rhetoric reflected his innate desire to depart from detente, and embark on a much sterner course. In the first few years of his presidency, military spending reached levels not seen since the Korean War, American-Soviet relations were cold indeed, and the prospects of arms limitations seemed dim. Reagan’s clearest departure from 1970’s policy was to be found in what some observers dubbed the Reagan doctrine. The Reagan doctrine was premised on the assumption that direct military, economic and political pressure against communist governments, would strain the Soviet Union’s military and economic system to a point where they could not compete.

 urlLink James K. Polk Home The only surviving residence of the eleventh U.S. President excluding the White House. Includes photos of the home and brief biography of Polk. From the site: Learn about the 11th President, the youngest up to the time, who managed to expand the borders of the United States to the Pacific Ocean, added three states to the Union, started the Naval Academy, the Washington Monument, issued the first postage stamp, and remains the youngest President to die outside those who have been assassinated. 1795-1844 The career of the eleventh U.S. President reflected and fulfilled the young nation's commitment to westward expansion. The son of a North Carolina farmer and surveyor, James Knox Polk was ten years old when his family moved across the Appalachian Mountains. Growing up on the Tennessee frontier, he inherited his neighbors' work ethic, resourcefulness, and democratic ideals. Although young James was accustomed to the rigors of frontier life, he lacked physical stamina. Shortly before his seventeenth birthday, he needed surgery for stones in his urinary bladder. The successful operation, performed by noted Kentucky surgeon Ephraim McDowell, enabled James to pursue an education with renewed enthusiasm. After only two and a half years of formal schooling in Tennessee, James K. Polk was admitted to the University of North Carolina as a sophomore. His college studies and his membership in a debating society helped nurture his growing interest in law and government. He graduated with top honors in mathematics and the classics, and returned to Tennessee determined to become a lawyer. To receive legal training, he worked in the office of renowned Nashville trial attorney Felix Grundy and served as clerk of the Tennessee Senate. Diligent and ambitious, James soon established a law practice in Columbia, Tennessee.

 urlLink Calvin Coolidge This is a biography of American President Calvin Coolidge. It is from USA Presidents. urlLink From the site: John Calvin Coolidge, Jr. ( July 4 , 1872 – January 5 , 1933 ) was the twenty-ninth ( 1921 - 1923 ) Vice President and the thirtieth ( 1923 - 1929 ) President of the United States , succeeding to that office upon the death of Warren Harding . He was born in Plymouth , Windsor County , Vermont on July 4, 1872 , but dropped John from his name upon graduating from college. He attended Amherst College , Massachusetts , graduating in 1895 . He practiced law in Northampton, Massachusetts, and was a member of the city council in 1899 , city solicitor from 1900 - 1902 , clerk of courts in 1904 , and a member of the State house of representatives 1907 - 1908 . Coolidge was elected mayor of Northampton in 1910 and 1911, was a member of the State senate 1912 - 1915, serving as president of that body in 1914 and 1915 . He was lieutenant governor of the state 1916 - 1918 , and Governor 1919 - 1920. He was elected Vice President of the United States on the Republican ticket headed by Warren G. Harding in 1920 . He was inaugurated on March 4 , 1921 , and served until August 3, 1923 . Upon the death of President Harding, Coolidge became President of the United States on August 3, 1923. Coolidge was visiting at the family home, still without electricity or telephone, when he got word of Harding's death. His father, a notary public, administered the oath of office in the family's parlor by the light of a kerosene lamp; Coolidge was resworn by a federal official upon his return to Washington. Unusually for a prominent politician, Coolidge was a man of few words, earning him the nickname "Silent Cal."

 urlLink Franklin Pierce (1853-1857) Fact file and comprehensive biographical sketch based on PBS series. Includes section for teachers. From the site: Franklin Pierce, the 14th President of the United States, came to office during a period of growing tension between the North and South. A politician of limited ability, Pierce was behind one of the most crucial pieces of legislation in American history. Although he did not author the Kansas-Nebraska Act, he did encourage its passage by Congress. And that piece of legislation set the nation on its path to civil war. Like many American politicians, Franklin Pierce's career was aided by his father, a two-term governor of New Hampshire. Before he was thirty, Franklin Pierce had served in the New Hampshire legislature and had been elected to the U.S. Congress where he served as both a congressman and senator. Bored and lonely in Washington, the young congressman developed a drinking problem and a reputation as a gossipy Washington insider. In an attempt to settle down, the handsome, socially gregarious Pierce married Jane Means Appleton. Jane Pierce was her husband's opposite; she was painfully shy, deeply religious, often in bad health, and a strong advocate of the temperance movement. She detested Washington and refused to live there, even after Pierce became a U.S. senator in 1837. Indeed, Jane's disgust with the political life in Washington must have been behind Pierce's decision to resign from the Senate in 1841. Subsequently, Franklin Pierce served in the Mexican-American War, and in something of a surprise was elected President in 1852. After his presidency he retired to Concord, New Hampshire, where he died in 1869.

 urlLink Astrocartography of Richard Nixon's Least-aspected Uranus Biography of the President, with special focus on how the planetary symbols of Uranus and Moon were reflected in his life and work, by astrocartographer Rob Couteau. This may be bunk but it is interesting. From the site: Richard Nixon’s astrocartography contains a unique example of how the key symbols con­tained within the Transcendental Midpoint-Field are reflected in mundane historic events. As we can see in Nixon’s astrocartography, his Primary Uranus, Secondary Moon, and Tertiary Saturn form an N-shaped Transcendental Midpoint-Field directly over eastern China, extending from the South China Sea to the northernmost tip of the nation. His Ter­tiary Saturn (forming the diagonal line in this field) passes directly over Beijing and curves along the northeast coast. Within this field the thirty-seventh American president enacted his most “long lasting and significant accomplishment” (Tertiary Saturn). His his­toric voyage to Beijing in February 1972 paved the way toward a “normalization of rela­tions” (Secondary Moon) between the Communist mainland and the United States, an act of such “innovation” (Primary Uranus) that it was considered politically “unthinkable” (Uranus) until that time. Richard Nixon was born at Yorba Linda, California, at a considerable distance from any planetary lines. He completed Whittier College in 1934 and after graduating from Duke University Law School in North Carolina he practiced law, then joined the Navy in August 1942. During his first assignment he served as a naval passenger officer in the New Hebrides (16S00; 167E00) in the South Pacific. While en route there he passed through the first of his Primary Uranus / Secondary Moon / Tertiary Saturn Transcendental Midpoint-Fields, this one positioned diagonally over the Pacific, covering an area extend­ing from the Hawaiian Islands to French Polynesia (15S00; 140W00). After the war Nixon decided to enter the political arena and in 1946 ran a successful — but even by contemporary political standards, an extremely dirty — campaign against Congressional incumbent Jerry Voorhis. His election to Congress and his subsequent move to Capitol Hill placed him near the vertical, apparent midnight position of his Pri­mary Uranus line, which runs along the eastern seaboard of the United States. Shortly after his election he was appointed to the so-called House Un-American Activities Com­mittee (HUAC) and, according to Nixon biographer Anthony Summer, was fed inside information by the CIA (through Allen Dulles) that supposedly implicated Alger Hiss as a Soviet spy. Nixon’s involvement with HUAC and the Hiss case (which came to trial in 1949) brought him to national prominence. After continuing to build his power base within the Republican Party, he was elected as Senator in 1950 and was selected as vice-president and served under Dwight D. Eisenhower from 1953 to 1960.

 urlLink Herbert Hoover . This is a short biography of President Herbert Hoover. It is from urlLink USA Presidents . From the site: Herbert Clark Hoover (August 10 , 1874 - October 20 , 1964) was the 31st ( 1929 - 1933 ) President of the United States . Hoover was born into a Quaker family in West Branch , Iowa , but after his parents' deaths lived in Newberg, Oregon . In the summer of 1885 eleven-year-old Bert Hoover boarded a Union Pacific train headed west to Oregon. Sewn into his clothes were two dimes; he also carried a hamper of his Aunt Hannah's homemade delicacies. Waiting for him on the other end of the continent was his Uncle John Minthorn, a doctor and school superintendent whom Hoover recalled as "a severe man on the surface, but like all Quakers kindly at the bottom." Hoover's six years in Oregon taught him self-reliance. "My boyhood ambition was to be able to earn my own living, without the help of anybody, anywhere." As an office boy in his uncle's Oregon Land Company he mastered bookkeeping and typing, while attending business school in the evening. Thanks to a local schoolteacher, Miss Jane Gray, the boy's eyes were opened to the novels of Charles Dickens and Sir Walter Scott. "David Copperfield," the story of another orphan cast into the world to live by his wits, would remain a lifelong favorite.

 urlLink PRESIDENTIALCHILDREN: TYLER'S 15, STILL A RECORD This articles introduces Tyler's large family and tells what became of each of his children. President Tyler, in addition to being remembered as a traitor (he served in the Confederate Congress), is well known for his fertility. From the site: John Tyler, President from 1841-1845, had two wives. Both were First Ladies, and between them had fifteen children, which is still the record for presidential children. Fourteen of these children lived to maturity. Tyler's first wife, Letitia, suffered a stroke in 1839, and during her years as First Lady, remained upstairs in the living quarters of the White House, coming downstairs only once for her daughter's wedding in January of 1842. On September 9, 1842, she suffered a second stroke and died peacefully the next day. She had given birth to eight children, seven of whom lived to maturity. John Tyler remarried in June 1844. His second wife was Julia Gardner, who gave birth to seven children, all of whom lived to maturity. Mary Tyler, 1815-1848. She was married in 1835 to a wealthy Tidewater planter named Henry Lightfoot Jones. She died two months after her thirty-third birthday. Robert Tyler, 1816-1877. After he served as his father's private secretary in the White House, Robert settled in Philadelphia, where he became a leader in the state Democratic Party. He practiced law and held the positions of sheriff's solicitor and chief clerk of the state supreme court. He supported James Buchanan throughout his career. Robert's wife was an actress named Priscilla Cooper, who acted as official White House hostess for the invalid Letitia Tyler for the first three years of John Tyler's Presidency. When the Civil War broke out, a mob attacked Robert's home and he had to flee Philadelphia. He returned to Virginia where he served as the register of the Treasury of the Confederacy. He was broke after the war and settled in Montgomery, Alabama where he became wealthy again as a lawyer and publisher of the Montgomery Advertiser. He was also a leader of the state Democratic Party in Alabama.

 urlLink Medical History of President Harry Truman Reviews the ills of America's 33rd President. His thick glasses may have been a result of a childhood infection. From the site: Truman developed diphtheria in 1894 at age 10. He was paralyzed for several months and had to be wheeled around in a baby carriage. Diphtheria antitoxin was unavailable then, so he was treated with ipecac and whiskey. He developed a severe distaste for both. As a child, Truman was diagnosed with a rare eye problem, "flat eyeballs." He wore thick glasses beginning at age eight, after his mother noticed he was able to see the large print in the family Bible, but unable to see objects at a distance. It has been said that Truman was far-sighted (which fits with the flat eyeballs diagnosis), but this pattern of visual acuity is characteristic of near-sightedness. The issue is interesting because one possible cause of far-sightedness in young people is diphtheria. Diphtheria can paralyze the ciliary muscle, the muscle that allows the eye to focus close in. Most biographers say Truman wore glasses before he contracted diphtheria. But Truman's son-in-law states that the diphtheria attack left him with the eye problem. Whatever the true nature and cause of Truman's visual impairment, his hopes as a high school student of entering the U.S. Military Academy at West Point were dashed by his poor eyesight.

 urlLink Remembering President Zachary Taylor This is a fake biography of President Taylor. This information in it is clearly designed for humor but I have no doubt that many school kids are using it as good source material for their papers! From the site: Considering the brevity of his stay in the White House (just under seven weeks), Zachary Taylor's spectacular legend seems grotesquely exaggerated, like the work of some crazed pre-Civil War spin doctor. But if anything, the reputation of our twelfth president has been muted in the century and a half since his death. Surrounded by controversy and swirls of almost unbelievable rumor since before he learned to walk, Taylor was the philanderer that JFK could only dream of being, twice the lush that Benjamin Harrison ever was. On a slow day, he was a bigger crook than Nixon, a worse gambler than James K. Polk, and more of an insufferable whining brat than George Bush. Few people are aware of this today. The story of exactly how he acquired the peculiar nickname "muskrat head" has unfortunately been lost, but we do know that he was plagued with it almost from birth. His hatred of the sobriquet only increased with the years, and until the day of his tragic premature death, the mere sight of a muskrat, or the mention of the animal's cursed name, was enough to send him into a fearful rage. When, at the young age of six, he was taunted with the epithet by two schoolmates, Taylor stunned his headmaster by chaining the hapless pranksters to a windmill and feeding them clods of grass until they nearly burst. It was only his millionaire father's hastily arranged donation to the school that avoided an early end of Zachary's academic career. Ten years later, on a trip to the zoo with a young lady that he was courting, the unfortunate girl innocently remarked, pointing to a family of muskrats, that they were "queer-looking beasts." This set Zack on a rampage, turning monkeys, tropical birds, an alligator, and an antelope loose, and hurling a peanut vendor's stand into a mud hole. As a young adult, Taylor's frustration and anger with his hated moniker manifested itself in more complex ways. Constantly subjected to verbal abuse and challenged to prove himself to his scornful colleagues, he exhibited increasingly bizarre and flamboyant behavior, hiding from no one in particular inside wagonloads of rotten vegetables, painting his beard blue, and on one occasion even tarring and feathering one of the Taylor family's chickens. While his antics occasionally earned him a certain amount of grudging respect from his friends, they never took him seriously, and this incensed him even more. From being a mere "discipline problem" in boarding school, Zack later grew to be a full-fledged terror, setting a local paper mill on fire, luring unsuspecting girls into his "secret clubhouse" in the sub-basement of the Taylor home, and dressing like a giant purple butterfly on religious holidays. Seeing Zachary Taylor sober was something few people could claim to have done.

 urlLink Growing into Public Service: William Howard Taft's Boyhood Home Classroom-ready lesson plan introduces Taft and his family. From the site: High atop one of Cincinnati's most prominent hilltops stands the large yellow house where William Howard Taft was born and grew up. Located in the once-affluent suburb of Mount Auburn, the two-story Greek Revival house is a reminder of the elegant era when those of means could escape the dirt, heat, and crowded conditions of the lower city. Although attractive and comfortable, the house was quite modest compared to the many splendid country villas found along the slope of Mount Auburn and on the summit. During the mid-19th century, Mount Auburn was known as the city's "Fifth Avenue." Among the many examples of architecture were elaborate Second Empire homes with their two distinctive sloped roofs, rambling Italianate villas belonging to some of Mount Auburn's wealthiest residents, and Georgian Revival houses reminiscent of the grandeur of the southern states. Walking through the neighborhood, one can imagine the sounds of horse-drawn carriages making their way up the steep hill to return well-to-do Mount Auburn residents to their homes. Now nestled among modern service buildings and other mansions that have been preserved, the Taft House reminds us of the boyhood and upbringing of a man whose career was dedicated to his country.

 urlLink News of Chester Arthur's Death Obituary reproduced from November 19, 1886, issue of The New York Times . From the site: LONG AND BRAVE STRUGGLE AGAINST DISEASE ENDED BY AN APOPLECTIC STROKE EARLY YESTERDAY MORNING -- THE STORY OF HIS LAST HOURS OF LIFE. Ex-President Chester Alan Arthur died at 5:10 o'clock yesterday morning at his residence, No. 123 Lexington-avenue. The immediate cause of his death was cerebral apoplexy, due to the rupture of a small artery within the brain during Tuesday night or early on Wednesday morning. From the time of the attack the ex-President did not speak. He did not become immediately unconscious, but power of speech failed him and consciousness rapidly dimmed, although almost to the last he showed signs of ability to appreciate, in an even fainter degree, what was going on about him. In the closing hour of his life he opened his eyes several times, and at the end turned his head on the pillow. Then all was over. His sisters, Mrs. McElroy and Mrs. Carr, his son Alan, Surrogate Rollins, and Dr. William A. Valentine, assistant to Dr. George A. Peters, Gen. Arthur's regular physician, were at the bedside. Miss Nellie, the only daughter, had retired a little before the end. Death came so quietly that she could not be summoned in time. Assistant District Attorney Arthur H. Masten, who is a nephew, was also out of the room at the moment. He had been one of the watchers during the long night. Dr. Peters had been in attendance nearly all of Wednesday. He went away ad midnight. There was no occasion to disturb him afterward. Although from the beginning of his illness Gen. Arthur was not ignorant of its gravity, his feelings were characteristic of the diseast, buoyant and depressed by turns. Upon his return from New-London, on Sept. 27, he felt so much benefited that he was sanguine of recovery. His appearance even after a Summer of rest and change was sadly unlike the robust picture familiar to the public eye. Any one who had seen him in his vigor might have passed him without recognition. The features still remained, but they were pallid and hollow and the full, straight figure still showed the emaciation that had alarmed the patient and his friends before he sought a change of surroundings. But he felt better. He was again in excellent spirits, and talked confidently of plans for business and pleasure. When the Presidency of the Arcade Railway Company was offered him, he accepted it, believing that he would be able to discharge its duties. A few days after his return he felt so well that he went out driving. The effort fatigued him excessively. He was not willing to believe the fatigue due to his enfeebled condition, but laid it to the rough streets. In speaking of the drive, he used to say, not wholly with jocose meaning, that one of the aims of his life, after he should resume outdoor activity, would be to secure at least one avenue over which people might drive to the Park without being jolted half to death.

 urlLink The Education of John Quincy Adams Brief overview of the education of America's sixth president. Includes a letter written by a 10-year-old Adams to his father. From the site: This issue of The Mandate examines the importance of the family in shaping the destiny of a nation. The article on pages 10-11 shows that God the Creator has given parents the great responsibility of overseeing the education and character development of their children. Christian character, which can never be adequately taught in a public school setting, is essential to sustain a free nation. Modern Americans have ceased, for the most part, to fulfill this obligation. They have turned away from the God who made America great and have produced a generation that is lazy, incapable of shouldering responsibility, dishonest, and forever blame-shifting. Many Chinese students observe these modern Americans and the enormous prosperity they have inherited and conclude that freedom and prosperity must have very little to do with personal character. But that is not true. We must look deeper to find the truth. The personal history of most early Americans reveals quite a distinct contrast in character to their modern counterparts. A close examination of historic accounts leads to one conclusion: America rose to greatness because of character - and she shall fall, if current trends prevail, for lack of it. John Quincy Adams, the sixth president of the United States, is an excellent example of this character instilled in early Americans. Born in 1767, John Quincy came from a New England farm family that played a significant role in shaping the course of the United States.

 urlLink John Adams' Inaugural The inaugural address of John Adams in Philadelphia in March 1797. From the site: When it was first perceived, in early times, that no middle course for America remained between unlimited submission to a foreign legislature and a total independence of its claims, men of reflection were less apprehensive of danger from the formidable power of fleets and armies they must determine to resist than from those contests and dissensions which would certainly arise concerning the forms of government to be instituted over the whole and over the parts of this extensive country. Relying, however, on the purity of their intentions, the justice of their cause, and the integrity and intelligence of the people, under an overruling Providence which had so signally protected this country from the first, the representatives of this nation, then consisting of little more than half its present number, not only broke to pieces the chains which were forging and the rod of iron that was lifted up, but frankly cut asunder the ties which had bound them, and launched into an ocean of uncertainty. The zeal and ardor of the people during the Revolutionary war, supplying the place of government, commanded a degree of order sufficient at least for the temporary preservation of society. The Confederation which was early felt to be necessary was prepared from the models of the Batavian and Helvetic confederacies, the only examples which remain with any detail and precision in history, and certainly the only ones which the people at large had ever considered. But reflecting on the striking difference in so many particulars between this country and those where a courier may go from the seat of government to the frontier in a single day, it was then certainly foreseen by some who assisted in Congress at the formation of it that it could not be durable. Negligence of its regulations, inattention to its recommendations, if not disobedience to its authority, not only in individuals but in States, soon appeared with their melancholy consequences-- universal languor, jealousies and rivalries of States, decline of navigation and commerce, discouragement of necessary manufactures, universal fall in the value of lands and their produce, contempt of public and private faith, loss of consideration and credit with foreign nations, and at length in discontents, animosities, combinations, partial conventions, and insurrection, threatening some great national calamity.

Includes history, calendar of events and exhibitions, educational programs, tour preview, staff directory, and directions. From the site: The nation's twenty-eighth President, Woodrow Wilson was born on December 28, 1856 in Staunton, Virginia. He was the son of a Presbyterian minister. Shortly after his first birthday, Wilson moved to the community of Augusta, Georgia where he spent the early years of his life. The family moved again in 1870 to Columbia, South Carolina. During his years in Columbus, Wilson settled down to serious educational study and in 1873, left home to attend Davidson College. He eventually transfered to the College of New Jersey, now Princeton University, where he graduated in 1879. Wilson went on to earn a Ph.D from Johns Hopkins University in 1885. That same year, Wilson married Ellen Axson of Savanah, Georgia. The couple eventually had three daughters, Margaret, Jessie, and Eleanor. After Ellen's death, Wilson married Edith Bolling Galt in 1915. Woodrow Wilson made his mark on both American society and world history. A brief description of some of his many accomplishments follows.

 urlLink A Concert of Mourning An in-depth look at George Washington's final days and the nation's response to his death. From the site: This year marks the bicentennial of the death of George Washington, the first president of the United States, who died on December 14, 1799, at the age of 67. In his last will and testament, Washington requested a simple and quiet burial, but his fame did not allow him to go without ceremony. The commemoration of his life and death began on December 18, when friends, relatives, dignitaries, military officers, and representatives from the Masonic Order participated in an elaborate funeral at Mount Vernon. Special commemorative newspapers decorated with black mourning borders carried word of Washington's death to the nation. What followed was a wave of universal mourning that began on December 26, the formal day of mourning in the nation's capital of Philadelphia, and continued for several months. The young nation expressed its grief in private letters, in resolutions by Congress and state and local governments, and in hundreds of commemorative speeches and mock funerals across the country. So fervent was the need to express bereavement that ladies decorated their clothing with black silk and wore memorial jewelry, while men donned black armbands. Shoppers and storekeepers noted a scarcity of black material and accessories as late as July 1800. It was to explore the many and varied facets of what was the greatest mourning period in the history of the United States that this exhibit brought together approximately forty books, pamphlets, engravings, lithographs, and other artifacts. Objects from this exhibit not pictured in the pamphlet, will soon be available for viewing on this website.

 urlLink Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR) This is a biography of American President FDR. It is from urlLink USA Presidents . From the site: Franklin Delano Roosevelt ( January 30 , 1882 - April 12 , 1945 ), often referred to as FDR , was the 32nd ( 1933 - 1945) President of the United States . He was elected to an unprecedented four terms of office - the only U.S. president elected more than twice, and part of the reason the United States Constitution was amended to limit presidents to 2 full terms (8 years). His main contributions were the instituting of major economic and social assistance programs in response to the Great Depression , leading the country through a successful involvement in World War II , and the formation of the United Nations . He was born on January 30 , 1882 in Hyde Park, New York , and died on April 12 , 1945 in Warm Springs, Georgia of a cerebral hemorrhage , leaving the famous Unfinished Portrait . He suffered from polio at the age of 39, which left him with severe difficulty in moving his legs. He often used a wheelchair , but took efforts to hide this disability throughout his life. In fact, there are only two known photographs of Roosevelt in his wheelchair. When a statue of Roosevelt sitting in a wheelchair was commissioned in Washington, DC in 2001 , some criticized this as unnecessary political correctness . From the age of one, through until 1936 , Roosevelt spent his summers at Campobello Island, New Brunswick but because of his worsening polio, in later years he had to spend much of his time in Warm Springs, whose namesake warm springs provided him and others relief from their symptoms , and where he built the Little White House , now a Georgia state historic site . [1] He also created the town's Roosevelt Warm Springs Institute for Rehabilitation , which continues to help others with disabilities to this day. [2] He graduated from Ivy League Harvard University in 1904 , and from Ivy League Columbia Law School with a J.D. in 1908 before taking a job with a prestigious Wall Street firm. On St. Patrick's Day , 1905 , he married Anna Eleanor Roosevelt , a distant cousin, who was the favorite niece of Theodore Roosevelt , his fifth cousin.

 urlLink Dereliction Of Duty: The Constitutional Record of President Clinton This 1997 paper argues that Clinton Administration policies weakened Constitutional guarantees. From the site: President Clinton recently put his hand on the Bible and swore an oath to "preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States." He took the same oath in January 1993. As the president embarks on his second term in office, it is an appropriate time to review his record thus far to see how well he has defended our Constitution. Although President Clinton has expressed support for an "expansive" view of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, he has actually weakened a number of fundamental guarantees, including those of free speech and the right to trial by jury and that against double jeopardy. He has also supported retroactive taxes, gun control, and warrantless searches and seizures. The president's legal team is constantly pushing for judicial rulings that will sanction expansions of federal power. The Clinton White House has, for example, supported the federalization of health care, crime fighting, environmental protection, and education. Clinton also claims constitutional authority to order military attacks against other countries whenever he deems it appropriate. President Clinton's record is, in a word, deplorable. If constitutional report cards were handed out to presidents, he would receive an F. It is to be hoped that President Clinton will resolve to be more conscientious about his constitutional responsibilities in his second term. But should his dereliction of duty continue, Congress and the Supreme Court should stand fast against any constitutional transgression. In the present climate, it is vitally important for all Americans to understand that the Constitution is incapable of enforcing itself. That task ultimately rests with the citizenry. If the American people demand adherence to the Constitution, government officials, including President Clinton, will respect the limitations that were wisely placed on their power.

 urlLink PRESIDENT CLEVELAND'S MESSAGE Letter to Congress in which President Cleveland protests what he believed was the illegal annexation of Hawaii. The point is definetly moot now... From the site: In my recent annual message to the Congress I briefly referred to our relations with Hawaii and expressed the intention of transmitting further information on the subject when additional advices permitted. Though I am not able now to report a definite change in the actual situation, I am convinced that the difficulties lately created both here and in Hawaii and now standing in the way of a solution through Executive action of the problem presented, render it proper and expedient, that the matter should be referred to the broader authority and discretion of Congress, with a full explanation of the endeavor thus far made to deal with the emergency and a statement of the considerations which have governed my action. I suppose that right and justice should determine the path to be followed in treating this subject. If national honesty is to be disregarded and a desire for territorial extension, or dissatisfaction with a form of government not our own, ought to regulate our conduct, I have entirely misapprehended the mission and character of our Government and the behavior which the conscience of our people demands of their public servants. When the present Administration entered upon its duties the Senate had under consideration a treaty providing for the annexation of the Hawaiian Islands to the territory of the United States. Surely under our Constitution and laws the enlargement of our limits is a manifestation of the highest attribute of sovereignty, and if entered upon as an Executive act, all things relating to the transaction should be clear and free from suspicion. Additional importance attached to this particular treaty of annexation, because it contemplated a departure from unbroken American tradition in providing for the addition to our territory of islands of the sea more than two thousand miles removed from our nearest coast.

 urlLink Jimmy Carter National Historic Site (National Park Service) Official National Park Service site for the former President's residence, boyhood home, school and railroad depot in Plains, Georgia. From the site: Few U.S. Presidents have had such close ties with where they were born and raised. The rural southern culture of Plains, Georgia, that revolves around farming, church and school, had a large influence in molding the character and in shaping the political policies of the 39th President of the United States. The site includes President Carter’s residence, boyhood farm, school, and the railroad depot, which served as his campaign headquarters during the 1976 election. The Plains High School serves as the park’s museum and visitor center. The Jimmy Carter National Preservation District includes part of the town of Plains and its environs. The area surrounding the residence is under the protection of the Secret Service and the home is not open to the public. The Carters returned to Plains in January 1981. The former President and First Lady pursue many of the goals of the administration through The Carter Presidential Center in Atlanta, which has programs to alleviate human suffering and to promote human rights and world peace. When they are in Plains, Carter teaches Sunday school at Maranatha Baptist Church to which the public is invited. The Carters’ ties to Plains have endured the stresses of public life, remaining as strong as they were decades ago.

 urlLink CENTENNIAL CRISIS: THE DISPUTED ELECTION OF 1876 BY WILLIAM H. REHNQUIST I wrote this book review for Ohioana Quarterly . As it fits the theme of this blog, I'll note it here. From the review: The presidential election of 1876 was one of the most bizarre, and controversial, elections in American history. By all appearances, Samuel Tilden won the election. However, some of the returns from the southern states were disputed. The most hotly debated state was Florida. A commission was appointed which included five Supreme Court Justices and ultimately Ohioan Rutherford B. Hayes was declared the next President of the United States of America. The parallels of the presidential election of 1876 with the presidential election of 2000 are obvious. It is with greater irony that this book on the election of 1876 is written the sitting Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court William Rehnquist. It was his court which settled the 2000 election which also revolved around disputed votes in Florida. Rehnquist noted this in the prologue. He wrote, “There was profound dissatisfaction with the process on the part of the losing parties in both 200 and 1876. Perhaps when such a dispute erupts, there is no means which will satisfy both sides. But for all of those whose interest in the process of electing a President was quickened the disputed election of 2000, a review of what happened in 1876 should be interesting and perhaps instructive.” (pp. 5, 6)

 urlLink TomPaine.com - Archives - The Other Buchanan Controversy Professional discussion regarding sociologist Jim Loewen's book which claims that US President James Buchanan was gay. From the site: Wheatland, Buchanan's house in Lancaster, is open to tourists, but visitors will never learn that he was homosexual or much else about him. In life, Buchanan was not very far in the closet. For many years in Washington, he lived with William Rufus King, Senator from Alabama. The two men were inseparable; wags referred to them as "the Siamese twins." Andrew Jackson dubbed King "Miss Nancy," and Aaron Brown, a prominent Democrat, writing to Mrs. James K. Polk, referred to him as Buchanan's "better half," "his wife," and "Aunt Fancy . . . rigged out in her best clothes." When in 1844 King was appointed minister to France, he wrote Buchanan, "I am selfish enough to hope you will not be able to procure an associate who will cause you to feel no regret at our separation." On May 13, Buchanan wrote to a Mrs. Roosevelt about his social life: "I am now "solitary and alone," having no companion in the house with me. I have gone a wooing to several gentlemen, but have not succeeded with any one of them. I feel that it is not good for man to be alone; and should not be astonished to find myself married to some old maid who can nurse me when I am sick, provide good dinners for me when I am well, and not expect from me any very ardent or romantic affection." King and Buchanan's relationship, though interrupted from time to time by their foreign service, ended only with King's death in 1853. While Buchanan was born and raised in Pennsylvania, William Rufus King was a Southern slaveholder. Buchanan's pro-slavery politics may have stemmed in part from their 23-year connection. Buchanan certainly thought highly of King: "He is among the best, purest, and most consistent public men I have ever known, and is also a sound judging and discreet fellow," as well as a "very gay, elegant looking fellow."

The land, which later became the ancestral home of the Busch family, today is preserved as a living symbol of the family's love for animals and Anheuser-Busch's commitment to wildlife conservation and preservation.

 urlLink How Alexander Graham Bell helped kill the President Tells how Garfield died from poor medical care and explores the role Alexander Graham Bell's crude metal detector played in the President's death. From the site: James A. Garfield, the 20th President of the United States may have been shot by a would-be assassin, but he was actually killed by his great team of doctors. Don't try to figure out what Garfield did as President that was so memorable - there was very little. In fact, most Americans barely recognize his name. After all, he was not Washington, Lincoln, or Kennedy. But then, he never had a chance to prove himself. Garfield was only in office for two-hundred days when he fell into the hands of his killers - the medical profession. Oh, I forgot to mention - he was shot prior to this - but this had little to do with his death. Huh?

 urlLink Presidential Gerald R. Ford Visits Ayers Kaserne - 1975 The President visited US personnel in the 1st Brigade, 3d Armored Division at Ayers Kaserne, Kirchgoens, West Germany, in July 1975.

 urlLink Millard Fillmore This is a biography of Millard Fillmore from the New Book of Knowledge . From the site: On July 9, 1850, President Zachary Taylor died in office. The next day Vice President Millard Fillmore was sworn in as the 13th president of the United States. He was the second vice president to assume the presidency after the death of a president in office. Fillmore has been considered one of the lesser U.S. presidents. Yet he was a statesman whose support for the Compromise of 1850 helped to prevent civil war and preserve the Union for ten years. He was also a diplomat whose dispatch of a U.S. expedition to Japan helped open that nation to world trade. Fillmore was born on January 7, 1800, in what was then the frontier village of Locke, New York. He was the second child of Nathaniel Fillmore and Phoebe Millard Fillmore, who had come from New England. The Fillmores were poor tenant farmers, and young Millard spent his early years working alongside his father. As he grew older, Millard realized that his formal schooling was meager. He used his spare moments to educate himself. Even while tending a machine as an apprentice to a cloth maker, he found time to memorize the definitions of words from a dictionary.

 urlLink Warren G. Harding: Inaugural Address. Includes the complete text of the speech delivered Friday, March 4, 1921. Includes background information. From the site: My Countrymen: WHEN one surveys the world about him after the great storm, noting the marks of destruction and yet rejoicing in the ruggedness of the things which withstood it, if he is an American he breathes the clarified atmosphere with a strange mingling of regret and new hope. We have seen a world passion spend its fury, but we contemplate our Republic unshaken, and hold our civilization secure. Liberty—liberty within the law—and civilization are inseparable, and though both were threatened we find them now secure; and there comes to Americans the profound assurance that our representative government is the highest expression and surest guaranty of both. Standing in this presence, mindful of the solemnity of this occasion, feeling the emotions which no one may know until he senses the great weight of responsibility for himself, I must utter my belief in the divine inspiration of the founding fathers. Surely there must have been God's intent in the making of this new-world Republic. Ours is an organic law which had but one ambiguity, and we saw that effaced in a baptism of sacrifice and blood, with union maintained, the Nation supreme, and its concord inspiring. We have seen the world rivet its hopeful gaze on the great truths on which the founders wrought. We have seen civil, human, and religious liberty verified and glorified. In the beginning the Old World scoffed at our experiment; today our foundations of political and social belief stand unshaken, a precious inheritance to ourselves, an inspiring example of freedom and civilization to all mankind. Let us express renewed and strengthened devotion, in grateful reverence for the immortal beginning, and utter our confidence in the supreme fulfillment. The recorded progress of our Republic, materially and spiritually, in itself proves the wisdom of the inherited policy of noninvolvement in Old World affairs. Confident of our ability to work out our own destiny, and jealously guarding our right to do so, we seek no part in directing the destinies of the Old World. We do not mean to be entangled. We will accept no responsibility except as our own conscience and judgment, in each instance, may determine.

 urlLink Harry S. Truman This is a good biography of President Truman. It is from urlLink USA Presidents . From the site: Harry S . Truman ( May 8 , 1884 – December 26 , 1972 ) was the thirty-fourth ( 1945 ) Vice President and the thirty-third ( 1945 - 1953 ) President of the United States , succeeding to the office upon the death of Franklin Roosevelt . Truman's presidency was very eventful, seeing the end of World War II , the beginning of the Cold War , the formation of the United Nations , and most of the Korean War . Truman was a notoriously folksy president, issuing many famous phrases including "the buck stops here". Harry S. Truman was born on May 8 , 1884 in Lamar, Missouri . When Truman was six years old, his parents moved the family to Independence, Missouri , and it was there that Truman would spend the bulk of his formative years. After graduating from high school in 1901 , Truman worked at a series of clerical jobs before he decided to become a farmer in 1906 , an occupation in which he remained for another ten years. (He was the last president to not have a college degree.) With the onset of American participation in World War I , Truman enlisted in the National Guard , was chosen to be an officer, and then commanded a regimental battery in France . At the war's conclusion, Truman returned to Independence and married his long-time love interest, Bess Wallace , and they would have one child, Margaret, shortly thereafter. Some claim that he was for a short time a member of the Ku Klux Klan, but this has not been verified.
