 When it comes to reading web logs, there's nothing that bugs me more than people that just can't friggin' spell, or don't bother to check their spelling. I hope it's just that they're lazy and don't check the spelling, because if that's not the case, we have alot of people out there in "higher education" that couldn't spell a word properly to save their fuckin' life. (No, not you Amanda! Lol!) I'm dun nowe. Buy.

 Today was a nice day spent at home. Bad news is, I believe I have the start of another cold........so needless to say, I'm not real happy about it. I hope I can fight this one off better than I did the last one. I know that I need to get a good nights sleep tonight, as I have a really long day ahead tomorrow. *dread* Good news is, I have a 4 day week at work, so I'm very happy about that! Then a wonderful 3 day weekend to top it off! Woo hoo! I'll have to keep that in mind, as I trudge throught the day tomorrow. Night all, I'm off to sleepy land. Zzzzzzzzz.

 Happy 21st Birthday urlLink Amanda !

 Only 1 more day untill urlLink Amanda's 21st birthday!

 I'm going to get rid of this Pepto Dismal pink pretty soon. I just haven't had any friggin' time to do it. My ass is dragging big time this morning. My eyes are blurry, my neck is stiff and I haven't been sleeping well lately. Maybe a hot shower will set me right. I don't know. Right now I just feel like dog shit . But, tomorrow's a new day, and after work tomorrow....oh yeah.....two delicious days off! I'm so ready for those days off. G'night!

 The thought of all those young people lost in that tragic club fire in Rhode Island just has me so upset and sad. Especially when it didn't have to happen. That band shouldn't have had pyro shit in a small club like that, with flammable materials all around them. And it's not as if they were a new band or something, with no experience. They've been around for a long time, with lots of venues in the past. Where were they're heads? Too late now. Lots of empty beds tonight, where feisty young people should be sleeping, dreaming about what a wonderful time they had last night. But they're not there tonight. I can't even imagine the pain of the families and friends.. I think I'm gonna go give my son an extra big hug tonight. And be very happy to see him lounging on his bed.

 I'm too tired to think. Note to self: 4 hours of sleep = feel like shit the following day. Get it. Got it. G'night.

 There is power in prayer, this I know. Another thing I know involving prayer, is that it doesn't work in regards to things like Ebay. Ebay is "prayer-proof". I can't seem to stay away from the shopping nirvana I've discovered right here in the comfort of my own home. See, I'm a confessed shopahoilc, and bringing my passion to my fingertips, any time night or day, well....................it's a big friggin' problem, and I feel I need some kind of divine intervention here. Or some Ebay Kriptonite. Whatever. I know....... I need Bush to nuke Ebay..... that's it! Problem solved. And this would be as nice diversion for him. Now I just gotta find that White House link, so I can drop him a line about my proposal. Later!

 Today's prayer: "Dear Lord, since I have discovered Ebay, my life has gone to auction hell. I can't stop looking for auctions, placing bids, and hitting the PayPal button at break neck speeds. I need help here.....fast! Is there any chance that Ebay could go offline for like, a month or so while I get myself into a 12 step recovery program? Any help would be appreciated. While I wait for your reply, I'll be browsing around in Auto Parts and Accessories". Amen

 I didn't smack Joy upside her head yesterday, but I did tell her that if she ever does that shit again, I'm gonna haul her outside and give her a good ass whippin'. I think she got my drift.

 Thanks Amanda for loaning me the Tae Bo tape! You're a sweetie!

 Work was less than great today. I only had one sale today, and that was nothing to write home about. Then at the very end of the day, Joy jumps my up, and gets a nice sale out of it. Meanwhile, she already has over $4000.00 in sales for the day. When I approached her about it, she just giggled and played stupid about the whole issue. So I told her that if I ever do the same thing to her, I don't want to hear a god damn thing about it. God, I just wanted to smack her a good one, right upside her head. I still might .

 Hubby and I had a fantastic Valentines Day. Memorable, to say the least!

 I sure am one lucly lady. Hubby wrote "I Love You" in the snow in huge letters in our yard last night, (along with a snow angel!) and today he sent me a dozen red roses at work! Wow! What a romantic he is, and how fortunate I am to have him to love me. And here I am armed only with chocolate strawberries and whipped cream..........hmmmm. I love Valentines Day!

 Happy Valentines Day Everyone!

 Holy cow shit. My page looks like one that friggin' Barbie would have. Speaking of Barbie, there's a t-shirt that I want to get that says, "I want to be Barbie. That bitch has everything". Just thought it would be good for a chuckle or two!

 I hope the colors don't hurt the eyes too much.......I was in a Valentine's Day kinda mood. What can I say?

 Well, I offically started my Tae Bo workouts today, and I guess it's obvious it didn't kill me (yet). I didn't make it through the whole tape, and I only did half of the sets they did, but I broke a pretty good sweat, and called it quits when I knew I had enough. Not too bad for one who hasn't worked out in about 20 years or so. I did enjoy the workout, and I feel it will keep my interest for a long time. I plan to do basic mat exercises along with the Tae Bo as a change of pace. Phew............gotta hit the shower.

 I really got alot done today, which was a nice surprise, considering that I had originally planned on sitting on my ass all day, and doing nuthin'! I went to Wal Mart and had my oil changed in the New Yorker, and did a bit of cosmetic shopping. Yeah, even though I sell Avon, and I primarily buy their stuff, I like to try new stuff by other brands too. I left there, and went to Hallmark to pick up a couple of birthday cards and a few Valentines. From there, I delivered a couple of orders, then headed home to make chili for dinner, and do laundry, clean up the kitchen, write out bills...................and now that all that's done, I'm relaxing! I joined Ebay the other day, and I currently have a bid in for a chrome air cleaner lid for the Vette. I think it will look sharp, adding a bit of chrome under the hood, and the price was right, so it's an inexpensive addition to boot. I gotta think thrifty, as I want to have plenty of cash for the necessities............like gas. And at the rate the prices are going, it's gonna cost a friggin' fortune to cruise this summer. Hopefully prices will drop drastically by then. *crosses fingers* I also checked out the beginners Tae Bo tape today, and all I have to say is that it's either gonna whip my ass into fantastic shape, or...........kill me. There's no grey area here. I mean, Billy Blanks is sweating like a pig, and he's in fantastic shape. I really hope I don't die. If I do croak, please lay me out in a crop top to show off the great abs I (hopefully) have. I mean, that's what this was all about, and I don't want to go to the grave without anyone seeing them. Thanks in advance.

 I'm really excited about starting Tae bo workouts. I believe this will be one exercise plan that will not only work, but will keep me interested and motivated. I loved it when Hubbs and I took martial arts classes together in our twenties, and being that this is very similar, I think I'll like it alot. Once I get past the initial aches and pains of beginning a new workout, I'll be fine.

 Well, I haven't posted in awhile, because I've been pretty busy working, and really haven't had much to say. Work has been going great this week. In fact everything has been great lately. I'm almost afraid if I talk about how wonderful things are, I'll jinx myself. Nah......I really don't believe in that shit. Lately I've been feeling on top of the world........at work, at home, in my head, body and spirit. It's like everything is working perfectly and at peak performance. I love this shit! It feel so wonderful to be in charge of things for a change, like finally alot of things are going my way. I have three glorious days off ahead, and I plan to enjoy them to the fullest!

 Hubbs arrived home safely tonight around 8ish. This was a surprise to me, as they weren't supposed to get in till tomorrow night. Oh well, it's nice to have him home again, and I did get the house all spiffed up before he arrived, which was great. I feel much better now, knowing I got all the much neglected cleaning done around this place. Phew I busted ass today, as I was full of energy unlike any I've seen in a long time! Must be the vitamins I've been taking! Well, all the activities today have worn me out, so I think I'm going to get some much needed rest. Long day tomorrow, and I want to be on my toes, ya know. Nite.

 While Hubbs is in North Carolina golfing with his brother Ron, I have been enjoying a few days of "me time". I love it, and the bit of freedom it gives me. It's not that I'm even doing anything special, but for a few days I can do what I want, when I want, and his schedual isn't involved. It's just a nice break from the norm. I do miss him alot though. We are together all the time, pretty much the story since we met 26 years ago. So when he is gone, there's a void, that even though I enjoy in small doses, I could not handle being apart from him for a long period of time. It's nice having someone to love, and love you back. Indeed.

 Here's another interesting search entry that brought someone to my site........"Do trees sleep at a regular time"? And I thought I was quirky!!!! Yikes.

 Once again, a search of "Do trees sleep?" brought someone to my site. If this were even an option, one would asume that trees also have an awake time. Are some trees morning trees? Really perky in the A.M.? Maybe some are night owls, or should I say 'night trees", that stay up reeeeeealy late, and then sleep in 'till noon. Hold on a minute...I'm gonna sneak outside and scare the shit out of my sleeping trees! *rolls eyes* Idiots. I wonder if the full moon has anything to do with this?

 Nick and Amanda arrived safley home around 6:30am Saturday. We are so happy they had a wonderful time and a safe journey down and back.

 I can't stand one more day without my car. I am going absolutely, freakin' nuts without my car. Nick and his buddy Joel were out in the driveway today working on their cars, and it only seemed to add to my frustration. I know that it's only been away for 5 months, and I do get to drive it for 7, but waiting for 15 more days just seems like an eternity right now. I just can't stand it.

 I am having an absolute blast pet sitting Amanda's 2 ferretts! These guys are entertaining as pets come. I let them out to run around at least three times a day, and they romp around like little clowns, wrestle eachother, play hide and seek, then crash out after having a snack. Too cute!

 Only 10 days until the first day of Spring!!! My only question.........is Mother Nature aware of this? I hope so, as I'm freezing my ass off right now in this Arctic cold bullshit. Enuff already!!!!

 Amen. The "Spring Breakers" arrived safely at the condo this morning! *sigh of relief*

 I had to say it..............one last time...............no sunburns!!!! ;)

 Spring Break 2003! Nick and Amanda, have a fabulous time in Florida! Wish I was going! Lol! Have a safe journey. Love you both.

 Whoo hoo! I get to "ferrett sit" Amanda's boys for over a week! This is gonna be fun! They are just too adorable and funny. I luv 'em to pieces. Thanks Amanda, for letting me care for your little ones for awhile. I'll take very good care of them, promise .

 Man, it's gonna be a bitch getting back in the groove at work tomorrow. Three days off, although I do love 'em, are hard to recover from in regards to work. Tomorrow, I'll be lethargic, to say the least. On Thursday, I'll be right back to my usual "killer" self. Today was a nice day, just getting stuff done around the house. Nothing specific.The only thing that pissed me off, was that one of my Avon customers woke me up with an order this morning, and I really needed/wanted to sleep in. And to boot, the orders were due in by Sunday. I swear these people can't read. Well anyway, I stayed up, did my work-outs and proceded along with laundry, etc. You know, fun shit. In other news, Nick and Amanda are leaving for Coco (sp?) Beach on Friday for Spring Break . Nice! I know they'll have a wonderful time. That is if my son ever gets his shit packed and ready! Sheesh. I've never been there, but it's really beautiful.....at least in the photos I've seen. I also hope they have good traveling weather, as this time of year it's so unpredictable. I wish I was going, but Nicks car doesn't have a trunk, so stowing away just isn't an option. That, and the last people they want to see there are parents. Can't blame 'em!

 I have been so busy counting the days untill I get my car out of storage, that I haven't been noticing how nice and enjoyable it is to drive my "winter car". Relaxing, actually. It seems I've forgotten the mild paranoia that accompanies driving a "classic car", and the work that goes along with it too. Like detailing it every day, all summer. Every day . I seemed to forget about the worry of someone scratching it while it's parked in a lot somewhere, or some asshole smashing into it on the street. I forgot about peeking out the window all day while at work, to make sure no one's screwing around with it. Now don't get me wrong, I love my Vette, and it's a blast to own and drive, but there's a price to pay also. So I figure I'm just going to enjoy driving my winter ride while I can. It's already scratched, so if someone dings it, hell I won't even notice. I hope no one smashes into it, but if they do, it will piss me off to have the air bag smack me in the face. I haven't washed it all winter, (except for when Hubbs ran it through a car wash a week ago), and it doesn't look bad dirty. All my winter ride wants is a tank of gas, an oil change and washer fluid. That's it. Get in and go. And no need to peek out the window. Not even once!

 Goodbye February.........hello March! Finally, it seems we're making some seasonal progress here!

 Well, after three fabulous days off, (despite the shitty weather), I head back to work tomorrow. My New Yorker started having tranny issues last week, which have yet to be resolved, so I've been driving the "beater truck" as my back-up. The thing looks like hell, but it has a heater, a radio, and gets me where the hell I have to go, so I'm not complaining. Hopefully, the weather will improve enuff that I'll be able to take the Vette when I want to. Not too much has been happening around here lately.......................hence the lack of posts. I have been spending alot of time on ebay, or too much time as my son informs me. Can't help it. I can shop and never leave the house to do it. This is pure fuckin' nirvana to me! Well, I better hit the sheets. Long day tomorow, back with the old crew after switching teams for a month. Should be interesting. Night.

 Amanda took "The Boys" home last night. I miss 'em. They were alot of fun while they were here, and I looked forward to letting them out to play each day. We did have a blast!

 I'm back! As you can see I've been "tinkering" a bit around here. I've been wanting to change the colors for awhile now, but just wasn't in the mood to piss around with it. I also wrote a couple of entries a few days ago, but my computer decided to vanquish them to some unknown void, so I said f**k it, and didn't re-write them. Again, I wasn't in the mood. I do things by the mood I'm in at the moment, in case you haven't already noticed that. I've really been spending most of my time on Ebay, buying stuff I really want, as March was a good month at work, and I probably won't have the funds I do now again, 'till the end of the year. So I'm buying now. And I'm lovin' it. Ebay is my new addiction.

 Well, I've made it back after a bit of a Blog "layoff', so to speak. I just got tired of writing the same old shit. It will probably be the same old shit again, but what can I say? My life just isn't that damn interesting. Now, if I would have had this stuff around like, 25 years ago, well you'd have been glued to my writings! And I would have been in deep shit, I'm sure. So it probably works out for the best that I didn't have this in my younger years. Nuff said about that! Last night, was one of the nicest times I've had in a long time. My son invited me to join him and his friends when they went on a group cruise. I said yes instantly , as normally I drive around alone, and the thought of riding around with some other people sounded wonderful! And luckily it was on a night that I wasn't working. We basically drove to MacDonalds on State Street, as that was the determined meeting spot. We waited around for about an hour till everyone arrived, then stood around and bullshitted awhile, and took photos and video. I felt a bit odd at first, but after awhile, I felt very welcomed and included. We left there, and drove 2 by 2 up State to Peach Street, around Tinsletown Cinema, then over to Brusters and parked in their lot for awhile. Damn, I froze my ass off there, but it was nice just talking and watching a few of them toss frisbee around. We headed up Peach to Country Fair on a bathroom run, and got coffee and snacks, then back down to State Street, around the dock and over to the Park & Ride to park and hang out some more. From there we went up to 26th street to the Sheetz to get some real food, and sat in the lot till 2:30A.M.. I was dead tired by the time I got home, but I had such a great time that I didn't care. Nicks friends are just such good people. I wish the people that trash talk youth could see what I saw. What I know, and have known for a long time. The assholes are the minority . Most of todays pierced, tattooed, crazy haired, bass thumping, import driving youth are wonderful people, just trying to express themselves. Hell they should, that's what youth's all about! They'll have they're fuckin' golden years to be bland and boring, damn it. Who the hell needs that shit? Anyway, these guys all have jobs, and pride, and manners. I had a terrific time, and I want to thank all of them for including me in their evening, and treating me like a friend,( who they all call Mom)! I love it and wouldn't want it any other way. P.S.- Thanks for the invite Nick!

 I love my son's sense of humor. (sometimes) Yesterday, I told him that today was my 4 year anniversary at work. His reply? "I'm so sorry". I love it! I almost died laughing!

 Jr. came home awhile ago after a looooong day at work, and I swear I have never seen that guy so friggin' dirty! He looked like he crawled out of a coal mine. Damn.

 Well, I take my car in to have the front end buffed out this morning. This should be interesting. I'm packing "heat" this time. Hubby will be with me. I hope that asshole opens up his big mouth. I really do.

 Ahhhhh........... finally a perfect Summer night. Beautiful warm weather, starry sky, cruising in the Vettester with Hubby with the t-tops off, hitting the highway, then a nice drive-by thru Geneva on the Lake. Just perfect. (Except for getting the bugs off the windshield and front grille! Lol!)

 Well, I got my car backk yesterday, after 4 loooonnnnnggggg days apart, and even though I'm thrilled to have her back home, I'm really pissed about a few things. First of all, I was damn mad when I drove by the shop on the second day, and saw her sitting outside overnight! Now, I really thought this guy would have more sense than to leave her outside all night. No alarm, all my papers in the car, sitting out front of the building, all night. Asshole. I was upset. When I mentioned it to Hubby, he said "Didn't you ask him if he was going to put it inside?" Men. Then I go and pick her up yesterday, and she's covered in rain spots, mud on the tires, mud on my drivers floor mat. WTF? I pay, and drive her home, where I have to give her a complete detail job, and I discover that not only are there tiny bubble spots in the clearcoat on the door, but the whole fuckin' front end of the car is covered in overspray!!! Now, Hubby just buffed out the whole car about three weeks ago, so feeling the overspray when I was drying her was easy to do. Damn it. Double damn it. I'm pissed! I'm sure he'll offer to take care of everything for me, but shit, then I'll lose even more driving days because of someone elses incompetence. I had told him that when I have my whole car painted, I would like him to do it. Screw that. I can't wait to have a little talk with him today.

 I finally get my car back tomorrow, after 4 long days. Damn I miss my car! I stopped by the shop today, and Tom told me that she'd be ready before noon tomorrow. Great! In case I didn't mention , some asshole hit the drivers door on my Vette with their door, and boogied, leaving a one inch circle of missing paint. Man was I pissed! Especially since I park a freakin' mile away from the stores. No matter what, someone has park right next to me. Anyway, I'll be glad to have her back home again. The weather is finally getting nice and warm, and the rain seems to be going away, so it's time to do some cruising, eh? That's all I can do, as I sure as hell am afraid to stop and park! Kidding. (Thank goodness for comprehensive coverage!)

 Finally, this Blog stuff is working. For the past few days, there have been problems here where as I couldn't post due to some freakin' errors. I don't know what it was. I normally don't have a helluva lot to say, but then when I do, this damn thing is acting up. I shouldn't bitch though, it is free after all. Today was a nice day off. Nothing great happened, but it was one of those days where you just feel at ease and relaxed. I got a bit accomplished around the house, with plans on finishing tomorrow after I shop for food. My brother in law will be over here on Saturday, so I'm using that as a reason to get my ass in gear and clean. He won't notice a damn thing, but that's fine with me. I'm just using his visit as pure, selfish motivation. Hell, somethin' gotta move this lazy ass of mine, as I've been putting this stuff off forever. Oh well, I've started, it looks good so far, and that's that. I went to Target today to get a shower gift for my nephew 's bride-to-be, and I had such a good time looking at all their neat-o stuff along my shopping route. Naturally, after I found their gift, I had to pick up a , (well actually a few), tid bits for moi. I found some Lemongrass poutpourri, oil, and incense that I just had to have! HAD TO! I love Lemongrass scent, but never see it anwhere, so I grabbed it when I saw it! I also bought incense called Coastal Mist, that is very nice also. Hmmmmmm. I'll have to go back and get the matching poutpourri now that I'm thinking about it. Best of all, it was marked down!!!! I must admit, I'm one hell of a bargain shopper. Yes I am. (I pride myself on this kinda shit. My world is small. Gimme a break.)

 First of all, it's still raining. Storming actually. I don't know if I should go to bed, or start building a friggin' ark. I hate this weather. All in all today wasn't too bad, considering it started off with a 9am bullshit meeting at work. Good news is, we don't have a sales meeting tomorrow morning, so it's kind of a wash out. I came home and took a 2 hour nap (fabulous!), then did some laundry, polished my nails, took out the trash, and watched a bit of TV in between. Nothing exciting, but no one was home all day, so I really had time to myself, to re-group a bit before heading back to work tomorrow. Just going in there today made me realize just how badly I have to get the hell out. It suffocates me after only a few minutes. So it's off to the grind tomorrow, with my 5 days off, just a memory. Man they went by too fast! Sheesh. I hope my jacket comes tomorrow, and I really hope it fits. That's the only thing about Ebay. You have to go by someones description and measurements, and hope they're correct. I just love this jacket, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed that all will be okay with it. Best part is, it retails new for over $400.00, but I got it for $39.00. Is that great or what? I just love my Ebay! Well, Hubby should be pulling in any minute, my tanning shit is dry, so I think I'm gonna head off to dreamland. Nite!

 I am anxiously awaiting the arrival of my new leather jacket that I won on Ebay. Right now it's in Utah. Great.

 I am bored out of my friggin' skull. I want a new job. Just to do something new, sounds so exciting to me right now. I am looking forward to visiting my brother in a few weeks. The thought of a road trip, and being in a new place for a couple of days, sounds great. Boredom sucks. It feel like winter in reverse.

 Well, as you can see, I've been re-arranging the rooms again! My house looks like shit, but my blog looks good......go figure. I've had 4 days off so far, with one more to go, and I have no motivation whatsoever. None. Zip. Of coure maybe it's the fact that I have people around here most of the day, so I find it hard to dig into a project when I'm being asked questions all day. So all my good intentions of getting things accomplished around the house this week, have all been flushed down the shitter. And I can't even go for a relaxing cruise, as it's still raining out. Damn it, will it ever stop raining? I just can't stand it any longer. I know I'm not the only one who feels this way.

 It is raining again today. WTF. I swear, I have never seen such a lousy Spring in my life. This shit is down right depressing already. I could just scream!

 Better late than never........"Happy 2 1/2 year Anniversary, Nick & Amanda!" Love you both.

 Well, so far today has been less then interesting, but just the fact that I'm off work makes me giddy. Tomorrow is going to be busy, as I have a 9am meeting at work (assholes), then it's grocery time again, and errands around town to wrap it all up. Hubby's birthday is on Sunday, so I have alot of loose ends to tie up where that's concerned. Today was an odd day. I went along in a kind of haze, just floating throught the hours. Now looking back on it, it's like "Where the hell did the day go?" Sometimes I can be so damn strange. (I think living with a Gemini and a Scorpio has something to do with my neurosis) Just a thought.

 Nirvana. I'm home from work early, no one is home, and I can do whatever I want for the rest of the evening. Now the question is......do I take a nap, go for a cruise or what? Hmmmmmm. Maybe a bit of each. I finally figured out how to get a graphic onto my page! Now I don't know how to move it to other places or anything fancy, but trust me, just getting the damn thing onto my page is a huge acomplishment for me ! Huge. If I get a background to work, I'll probably shit myself with delight! Unless you're Amanda, you have no idea what an ordeal these things are, for a html retard like me.

 Congratulations Nick!! Hubbs and I drove out to the car show at Enormis on Saturday night, and personally, I had a great time. Nick placing third in his class, and taking home a nice trophy, left me riding home with a big smile on my face! I was really hoping he'd take something home, the kid works so hard on the car, and lord knows he doesn't have alot of cash to work with. There were alot of awesome cars there, so I didn't know how things would turn out for him. When they announced his name, Amanda and I just screamed ! This other gal did too, but hell if I can remember her name. She's a sweet person, but my memory just sucks when it comes to names. Anyway, the three of us screamed and clapped.....loudly! WooooHooo! This was the first time I had ever been to an Import show, and I must say those cars are really something to see! And when it got dark, and all the neon light came on, it looked like a freakin'n carnival! It was great! (even if my other half acted like a "fud-dud"!)

 Booze and Bouncing! Nice relaxing day at home today. Nick fiddled with my car a bit, getting it ready for my trip tomorrow. Got it washed just before the thunder storm rolled in! Then Amanda and Nick arrived, and Amanda made some yummy drinks in her blender. After a couple of drinks, I got on the damn trampoline, and laughed like a friggin' idiot for the longest time. It really was fun, although I don't think I could do it on a regular basis. Unless of course Amanda shows up with her blender on a regular basis. Just a thought. We all sat on our street tonight and watched the fireworks, which was a nice ending to a great day. I'll talk to ya when I get back from my road trip on Monday. See ya!

 Happy 4th Everyone! Everythings cool, gonna enjoy the day. Hope you enjoy it too! Peace.

 Don't piss on my parade There's something in the air tonight, and it aint good. I don't know if it's some bad cosmic vibe or what, but the tension is so thick you can cut it whth a knife. I personally am not a contributor to the bad vibe, but a recipiant of the bullshit. As usual. And I'm pisses about it, and I need to vent, even if it is into cyberfuckinspace. I am tired of being on the receiving end of peoples messed up lives. See, I try to be a patient, understanding person, going through life trying to make the least amount of waves for people that I possibly can. I try my best to be upbeat, happy, have a positive outlook no matter what the situation. All I ask in return is to not be screwed with. Don't take me for granted. Don't go and mess up my day just cause you feel like it. Some people don't think twice about yelling at me, calling me names, being rude to me, and playing head games. I don't do this shit to anyone. And yet this is what I get. Is this the price for being nice? I always hope that I can be a good example. But what am is a doormat. I know deep inside that I'm not doing anything wrong, and that it's the trip of the other people, but that doesn't make me feel any better. I am under a great deal of stress everyday at work, something that no one around here seems to understand. They all think it's in my head. Sometimes I don't think I can bear another day there, yet I hang in and try to give it another try. I do my best. Even dealing with anxiety attacks on occasion. For years, I listened to others talk about their jobs, and never was anything but supportive about their decisions. I don't think they could last at my job for a month. The only true calm time I have is when I'm driving my Vette. I don't think about anything else but the ride. Sadly, I can't do this as often as I would like. Or as often as other people persue their hobbies. I guess I could, but I don't like to put things aside to do so. See, I have laundry, shopping, beds to make, a house to clean, a dinner to make, etc. And I get asked why I didn't cut the grass! WTF? Are you kidding me?! I'm not cutting the goddamn grass. It's just the principle of the whole thing. If I'm not appreciated for all I do now, why should I throw lawn work on to the heap? I may be nuts, but I'm no asshole. Cut the grass your own damn self. In fact, the friggin' grass can grow taller than the house, and I wouldn't give a damn. Right now I feel like getting in my car and driving to Mexico or someplace crazy. I feel like I want to scream. All the way to Mexico. And drink Tequila for a week. People need to get their shit together, not just share theri neurosis with me, and bring me down too. Talking about it is one thing, but then they gotta do something to change their situation. Me listening to them, and being their sounding board isn't gonna mane their life better. It only makes me feel like shit. And hitting them upside the head. Maybe I just gotta get mean. I do have it in me, I just don't like to deal that way. I'm not a bad vibe kinda person, and I find it hard to send out nastiness. It's not my style. But lately, I'm running out of options, and unleashing my fury may be my only option. That and picking up a bottle of Tequila.

 On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the best, today was a -3. It sucked. Bad.

 Hey, I'm back! But you gotta bear with me here, because this place is going through some major changes, like I have in the past few weeks, and I don't know how fast I'm going to get everything done. But I will get it all done as soon as I can. I've missed being here. Things are more frustrating to me now than they used to be. I know that will get better over time. That' part of the reason this will take a bit of time. I get pissed at simple shit really easily right now. It'll be okay though. This will help me along. Peace.

 What a beautiful day for the end of October! I have shorts on for goodness sakes. I can't remember the last time it was this warm, at this time of year. Awesome is the only word that can describe this weather. Nick and Amanda left for Niagara Falls this evening, and I'm happy to say that Nick called around 10:30 or so and said that they were in their room relaxing. Amen. I just can't relax till i get that "We're in" call. Untill you're a parent, you don't understand how much rides on that one call. Anyway, I hope they have a fabulous time, and remember to stash lots of hotel freebies in their bags! (You know....shampoos, soaps, etc.) Trick or Treat was nice this evening, but I don't think we really had that many kids, considering how great the weather was. I was really surprised. I have a hell of alot of candy left over. Too bad I can't enjoy it as much as I used to. Hmf.

 1. Nick & Amanda arriving safely 2. Nice weather for the kids 3. Leftover candy 4. Pat bringing Nick & I each a candy bar tonight 5. Sitting outside talking and laughing

 It was sooo beautiful today, I just had to take the Vette out for a couple of drives. One of them was to my doctor, for a check up, and for him to sign my return to work paper. Everything checked out ok, except my liver enzyme levels were a bit elevated due to my meds, so I have to keep an eye on that. Always something. The rest of the day was rather blah, doing nuthin' special but a bit of last minute yard winterizing. Wooohooo, fun shit. I went to the Dollar Tree tonight and got the wrapping items I need for Nicks birthday gifts, so I'm happy to have that off my "to do" list. Now I'm going to put bitsy to bed, get a hot shower and perhaps watch a bit of TV.

 1. A gorgeous day to enjoy 2. Driving my car 3. Playing in the leaves with Bitsy 4. Seeing Deb at the Dollar Tree 5. A hot shower

 I am so happy I get to tool around in the Vette a few more days than I had planned, due to upcoming nice weather over the next 5 days! Yes, I am a happy chick indeed! It's always a sad day when I have to put her in winter storage. No fun till Spring, and that sucks ass. Well, I'm not gonna think about that now. I gotta figure out where I'm gonna cruise to tomorrow. Hmmmmmm. It really doesn't matter, as no matter where I go, I'll have a shit eatin' grin of happiness on my face.

 1. Watching Sharon O. with Bitsy while eating breakfast 2. Deb & Debbie the nurses at Cardiac Rehab who always smile 3.A chat with my Mother-in Law 4. Eating a Resees Cup (mmmmmm!) 5. Not getting winded on the treadmill today

 Well, three more lovely days left untill my feet once again cross the threshold into retail insanity. I have to keep telling myself that hopefully I'll only be there a month, and I can make it through, with my sanity in tact. If my boss even thinks of cutting me slack due to my health issue, I swear I'll lose it. I need to be out of that place pronto. No looking back. Ever. One thing I will certainly miss once I start work again, is watching the urlLink Sharon Osbourne Show in the morning, on my bed with Bitsy, as I have my coffee and I feed Bitsy her Puppy Chow breakfast . Over the past month and a half, this has become our morning routine, and we really enjoy it. I even catch Bits watching the show from time to time! The show is awesome . If you haven't seen it yet, you need to check it out at least once.

 1. A warm house 2. Puppy breath 3. My friends smile 4. Another friends laugh 5. a long hot shower

 I decided at the last minute to stop at the Mall yesterday on my way home from my cardio workout. Well, as I'm looking around in Spencers, who should pop up righ next to me? Amanda! What a nice surprise. We walked around together for awhile, then she headed out and so did I. Then, I got the notion to stop at the party store while I was in the area, and who did I run into there? Joy from work, who has been out on disability just like me. I haven't seen her since Sept. 11th when I had my heart attack, so we hugged and screamed and hugged and smiled in disbelief. We were just so happy to see eachother! Weird shit.

 Always carry mascara, lipgloss and/or lipstick and eyeliner with you. Always! Trust me, in an emergency where you aren't home for a few days, you'll be glad you did! Trust me!

 Hubbs and I rolled all the pennies we've collected over the past 10 years or so, and we had $70.00! Shit!

 Well, I guess the best way to start any story is from the beginning. The only problem is, and this is why I'm not a friggin' writer, is that I'm not a detail person. I don't like to write in detail, I should say. So, in lieu of alot of details, I'll just stick to the facts. Over the past few months, alot of changes have been occuring in my world. Some good, and some not so good. As far as the good goes, our family got a new addition in August. Her name is Bitsy, and she's a feisty, and adorable chihuahua/schnauzer/??? mixed little mutt. She's such a joy to have around, although at times she wears us out with all her energy, and puppy curiousity. I'd forgotten how much work a new puppy is, even though the rewards far outnumber the frustrating times. Still, she can be a handful. Especially in the nipping department. She's 4 months old now, and nipping is one of her bad habits that we're trying to get control of. Her puppy teeth are sharp as nails, and when she takes a bite at your nose..............that shit hurts!! Anyway, we love her to "bits"!! As usual, I've always been one to be full of surprises. Well I had one hell of a surprise on September 11th. I had a heart attack at 9PM on the way home from work. Like I said before, I'm not a detail person, so again I'll just give the facts. First and foremost, I'll always be eternally grateful to my son Nick for taking control of the situation, and calmly getting me help, and staying with me untill 4:30 in the morning, when I was finally admitted to a room. I'll never forget his bravery, in what had to be a totally freaked out situation for him. The 4 days I spent in the hospital are pretty much a blurr now....... of restless nights, endless bloodwork and blood pressure tests, Hubby, Nick amd Amanda visiting me, the lady in my room gasping for air and gagging day and night, and bland hospital food. My only respit was down the hall in the visitors lounge where they had a computer with internet access. At least I could limp down and check my e-mail and some of my favorite sites to pass the time. I limped because my right leg was sore from the procedure where they inserted two stents into a vein in my heart. They go up into an artery in your leg to do this. I don't remember the surgery as the meds just knocked me flat. I was really glad to be let out of tht place. You can't get any fuckin' sleep there! So anyway, here I am, feeling pretty damn good, and pretty much back to "normal" except for no heavy lifting, and being on a low fat diet. Oh yeah, and Cardio Rehab three times a week, which I find to be a royal pain in my ass. thank god that will end in like a week or so. As far as work is concerned, I go back next Saturday, which I'm dreading beyond belief. I hope I can sweat out this month, get fired, and collect unemployment for at least 26 weeks, while I look for a job I will enjoy going to everyday. Or not, we'll see. Hubbs says I really don't have to work if I don't want to, and he's really enjoyed me being at home this month and a half. I must say, I have too. But I know that sooner or later, I'd have to get out of the house. I guess I'll cross that bridge when I get to it.

 Now lemme see what I was doing 21 years ago at this time. I was in Magee Womens Hospital in Pittsburgh. We went in at 4am, as labor was to be induced. Nick was actually due on October 18th. I finally got into a room around Noon, if you can imagine that! To make a long story short, many labor pains and a welcomed epidural later, Nick was born at 3:02 pm, measuring 21'' and weighing 6lb. 13oz. What a beautiful baby boy! It was the happiest day of my life. Seeing him turn 21, is another. Love you Nick.

 1. A beautiful day (again!?) 2. Surviving Cardiac Rehab ( I was tired!) 3. Bitsy making me laugh 4. Drove my car again! 5. Seeing Nicks smile upon fixing his bike

 Working on sunday sucks no matter where you work. I hate it, always have and always will. So my day started with that mind set. The day seemed to drag, even though we were pretty busy, and my aching feet didn't help matters at all. I made it through, I made a few sales, and I made it home again. A good day indeed. Now, three days off! Woooooo!

 1. Nick & Amanda getting home safely 2. Holding my temper 3. Not letting things stress me out 4. Having a bit of chinese food 5. Leaving work

 Things went pretty well today, but I must say it was a bit rough getting back into the mindset of selling again. In fact, there were alot of things that I had forgotten all together! But before I knew it, everything came back to me. The nicest part of my day was that everyone was genuinely happy to see me, and needless to say, that made me feel pretty good inside. It's a,ways nice to know you're missed. I will miss my friends, as dysfunctional as they are, when I leave that place.

 1. My goofy friends at work 2.Getting through the day 3.Everyone supporting me 4. A sunny day 5. Getting to browse at Gabes

 I can't believe it's been over a month since I've written. So much has gone on. Did I feel like writing about it. Nah. I thought about it though.......does that count?

 I just discovered a yummy little spritz that will be perfect for Summer, called urlLink Cotton Candy , and the best thing about it is, that it's only $1.50 for a 1.7 oz. bottle at Wal Mart! Perfect size to throw into a purse! Bonus....it's pink!

 I have become a blank slate again, fresh and new. Learning to be me again, without outside expectations forming the me they want me to be.

 Well, I'm back again . Gotta get used to this, because I come and go. I'm into this, then I'm not. That's just the way it is with me. And not just with this journal stuff, but with everything in life. I get bored and lose interest in things alot. It's unnerving to me, but I just go with the flow and see where I end up. I never know, so that's what keeps it interesting. I need interesting. But then there's the part of me that loves the comfort of predictability. Damn I'm a confusing person. Therein lies the kaliedescope part. Just shake the damn thing, and everything changes. You never know what it's going to look like or if you'll like it. That's my life. That's what's inside my head. Never a dull moment in this cranium of mine.

 Well, everything about my brothers visit was awesome , execpt the weather. It was cold, damp and dreary.....less than perfect, but we really didn't notice, as we were so happy to spend time together. I know he had a good time, because he spent the night, which he wasn't planning to do in the beginning. He hit the road around 6:30 AM on Sunday morning. The day mostly consisted of Mike sitting outside with Hubby and Jr. while Hubbs was working on Jr's car, which Mike enjoyed alot because first of all he loves car shit, and this gave him a chance to talk "motorhead" stuff with the guys, second he got to spend time with Jr, who he hasn't seen in quite awhile. We had lunch, then Mike and I ran up to WalMart for a few things, (there was this cool hat I saw there the other day, but as luck would have it.....gone!), then we hung out at the house for a bit. Mike wanted to go up to the lake while he was here, so around 2:30 or so we headed up to Erie to check out the lake. (To be continued.....)

 My brother Mike is coming up to visit us tomorrow and I'm really looking forward to it! Especially since he hasn't been here since Nicks grad party in 2001. Wow! That's a long time between visits, eh? Anyway, he's gonna pick up Nicks "old" computer desk to put in his spare room/office to be. I can tell he's really excited to come up, or as he put it "Road trip"!!! He's been through sooo much over the past year, with getting divorced and all the adjustments that go along with it. And he's had a really tuff time financially this winter. Poor guy needs a break already. He's such a great guy too. We have alot of time to make up for, as he and I have missed out on alot of years together. (Very long story there!) Anyway, gotta get things dusted off a bit around here. He said he might get here around 7:30 in the morning tomorrow. Is he fuckin' nuts or what?? I don't even know where I am at 7:30 anymore. Sheesh, I hope I can sway him to get here a tad bit later. *fingers crossed*

 I have to go grocery shopping, and I'm dragging my feet, as this is my least favorite thing to do. I don't have much choice though, as the cupboards are almost bare. Damn, if there's a shopping fairy, I wish she'd drop in now. (Ha! Just as I typed shopping fairy, I thought of Christopher Lowell!!)

 "Bitsy the terror" is wearing me out!! Having a puppy is more exhausting than having a kid! At least my son would sit in front of the TV and watch some shows or a video. This dog wants to be by my side at all times. I love her to pieces, but she's wearing me down fast!!

 I can't seem to find anything to peak my interest lately. My attitude is bland.....and I hate bland with a passion. I love having a spark, zest, zing. Right now I'm trying to find my "zing".

 I won a urlLink FCUK hat on Ebay yesterday, and I can't wait to get it! Cute and cheap.....love it!

 I'm in limbo. Job limbo, mind limbo, car limbo. This is just mumbo jumbo about limbo. I'm fucked up.

 WTF? Why is it that one day I can look at myself, and think I look ok....and the next day, think I look like shit? What the hell is that all about? What goes on upstairs that just changes our perception of things? Like overnight. I hate whatever it is, and I wish it would go away forever. I just don't want it to leave while I think I look like shit.

 The snow just completely fucked up my attitude today. Thanks alot.

 Hubbs and I watched urlLink School of Rock last night. We thought it was pretty good, even though not as funny as I thought it would be, it was uplifting, and made me want to crank up the radio and listen to some Rock & Roll!

 Man I feel great today! I know it has to do with the weather change, because the dreary days of Winter really bring me down. It's a constant battle to keep myself motivated and in decent spirits. I got down to hard core working out last night, and I feel great about it, and comitted to following through with it every morning and night. I've put on a few pounds & inches since I got out of the hospital, and I friggin' hate it! But I didn't put on so much that it won't be a breeze to shake off if I just give it some effort. Getting started is always a bitch for me, but once I get rollin' ,watch the hell out! This Winter mood shit sucks big time. I would really love to do the 6 months here and 6 months in Florida "Snowbird" routine. Maybe someday. I mean somedays I don't want to be in the house, but I don't want to go out either. Nothing motivates me, and I just want to nap untill Spring arrives. Whoa.

 I'm very excited! Coming soon, in about a week, check out my new "Beauty Blog"....The Glam Factor! It will be full of beauty tips, tricks and hints and reviews of the latest products.....good and bad! I hope you'll come back and check it all out!

 I went to get my eyes checked yesterday, and I had a blast! My eyes checked out ok as far as glaucoma and all that stuff is concerned, but I do need glasses for reading and driving. No shit. I found the greatest frames that I just love , and the guy who helped me pick out the frames was a hoot! He was obviously gay, and kept saying "They look fabulous on you!" about some of the frames I tried on. It was fun! I can't wait till they come in next week. The only thing is that they're bi-focals and I'm wondering if they're gonna be a pain in the ass to get used to. We'll see I guess.

 Reading web pages where people either can't friggin' spell, or they're too damn lazy to care about checking their spelling is getting on my nerves big time. I mean, there are some sites that I swear it looks like a bunch of 5 year olds are at the keyboard. And I know for a fact that these folks are in their late 20's and 30's. Okay, I'll shut up now.

 I just found out tonight that my brother is having a small get-together at his house for my nephew Mikeys birthday. I'm almost having an anxiety attack just thinking about being around my chain-smoking brother. Oh boy, this might be rough. No, this is gonna be rough, but I guess I have to go through it to get through it, if you know what I mean. Damn, some days are a bitch.

 I didn't watch the whole Joe Outback saga tonight, but the point where all the canoes containing the "Bubble-heads" went over the little waterfalls, and the canoes tipped over spilling the squealing "Bubbles" into the swirling water was....well....priceless. *shakes head and grins*

 Sometimes I can't fathom how much some women spend on things.....clothes, shoes, make-up, etc. It just blows my mind when I hear some chick mention paying over $200.00 for shoes or $100.00 for a top or $25.00 for lipstick. Huh? Did I miss something here? I don't know, but the thought of paying those prices makes my skin crawl. Those things just aren't worth that much . Even if I was filthy rich, I would have one hell of a time with some of those high prices. The only, well a couple of, big splurges I would have if I was dripping in cashola, would be a driver and a cleaning-man. Oh yeah. Give me a sec...I'll think up a few more.

 And muffins too....blueberry and apple. Hungry yet? Huh? urlLink

 Strawberry bundt cake.....yum! urlLink

 I have taken a liking to making bundt cakes lately. Dunno why. I made a strawberry with whipped strawberry icing one today, and I must say it looks very yummy. As far as the country mucic is concerned, don't worry it's just a phase. I guess I got a bit tired of the rap, old rock and/or pop crap. So I switched it up for a couple of days. One thing I must say though, is country music sure has some pretty love songs. I guess I'm feeling mushy today. Another phase. Jeeze.

 Bluemoon urlLink

 Stressful day today. For no reason in particular, and for everything in general. Some days, like today, everything just seems to come crashing down, making me feel like I'm buried alive and I can't breathe. I want to get out of my skin and run away, from the feeling of panic, but then knowing there's nowhere to run stirs the panic even more. Damn hormonal bullshit combined with this nicotine cessation is a real bitch to deal with. Some days it's a breeze and others, pure hell. I made it through though, with alot of reassuring words from Hubby, an Ativan, a hot shower and hopefully, a good nights sleep. Hubbs wants me to ride down to the 'Burgh with him tomorrow to visit with my folks 'till Saturday evening, but I don't know if I'm into that, with the way I've been feeling lately. Lord knows I want to see my parents. I haven't had a decent visit with them in a long while. I just don't know if I can do the overnight thing. Lately, it doesn't take much to throw me into a spin. I don't need that to happen at my folks house. they have enuff stuff to handle, without me having a panic attack while I'm visiting. A daytrip yeah....I just don't know about staying over. What to do?

 My "Outback Hubby" beats Joe anyday!! urlLink

 Well, Sex in the City is over for tonight, and as always, I enjoyed it totally. Hell, even the fact that all the chicks in it are skinny doesn't bother me. I always walk away with a smile. "I wonder if models repel" was my favorite saying tonight. Speaking of chuckles, I've been checking out this Outback Jack show, and I've never laughed so much over a show before in my life. First of all, where the hell do they find these women ? I can't even believe that there are actually bubble-headed broads like this on the planet. Hmmm, I need to get out more. The fact that they made these air headed bimbos jump out of an airplane to get to the Outback, pleased me to no end. And the fact that they all had evening gowns on that they had to tuck into their jumpsuits, almost made me piss my pants. Then, after they landed from their jump, they had to hike through the outback in their strappy high heels. This is too good to be true. From there, they all screamed ,ran about flailing their arms, whined and complained about everything and anything...especially the first base camp & the bugs. As one "Bubble-Head" put it, "I thought I was going to a 5 star spa or something. I'm just not used to this at all ". Shoot me now. Oh, but I gotta see what happens to the princesses next week. The humanity.

 Today is my two weeks smoke free anniversary!! It's all good.

 I can't believe this shit. In fact, it happened to me twice! Here's the story. I wanted to join this support group for quitting smoking. It has a forum and chat and stuff and I thought that it would benefit me to talk to others who have quit, especially when I'm having on of my rough times. Well, their directions are sketchy for getting into this "group", as far as these pledge forms you have to fill out and shit. I couldn't find a link, I didn't know it was a copy & pate thingy. Good fuckin' grief. Hell, if all this aggravation to join the quit smoking forum doesn't make you wanna light up again, nuthin' will sister. (No I didn't do it....Not gonna happen here.) Back to story. So I fill in all this shit, and send it back and guess what???????? I get fuckin' rejected not only once.... but 4 times !!!! Can you believe that shit??? I'm soooo pissed. I wanted to write them a nasty letter, but I think then I'll just sound like an asshole, and they'll just say "Well we don't need the likes of psycho bitch on our boards anyway". Yet I'm still pissed. What to do?AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHH! Their name is urlLink WhyQuit.com. Hell yeah, after they get done with you , that's the question your asking yourself......why friggin'quit??????AAAAARRRRGGGHHHH! Here's an excerpt from the letter they sent me: "We've received your application to join Freedom but unfortunately must deny it as it does not contain the important information requested in our left margin link page entitled "Join after 72 hours."

I really think I'm gonna write that letter.

 Enjoy!

 Here we go again. This shit is outta control. War is one thing, but what these assholes do is beyond comprehension. Insane. Pure insanity. urlLink

 I was just outside a bit ago, and it's so surreal out there right now. It feels like you're in a rainforest.......a bit muggy, wet, foggy, overcast. Strange.

 Damn I'm pissed. I was at WalMart tonight, when I happened upon a rack of Levis for $5.00 apiece. Now I mean original Levis.....so you know what a hell of a deal this is. Well, they had my size, and a tall to boot..........the friggin' size I was wearing 10 months ago before I started eating like it's going out of fuckin' style, and now my ass won't fit into any of the clothes I love. Damn it . Is it obvious that I'm way pissed? Well, the good news is that I've started working out again.... the bad news is that it probably won't show until friggin' November when I won't give a damn. Oh, going on 10 days without puffing. Woot woot!! I'm smoke free, and have a big ass. Why can't things just be simple? Huh?

 urlLink

 Just a garden shot. Soon they'll be gone. urlLink

 I had a fun day today.....doing the birthday thing for Bitsy kind of gave me something to look forward to. Thing get kinda boring around here. Predictable. So today was a nice break from the ordinary stuff. Bitsy had fun too....I don't care who thinks I'm nuts. Don't care. I watched SITC againt tonight, and I think Pat watched it too, as I mentioned it to her today and she said she'd check it out. I'm anxious to see if she liked it or not. That show makes me realize something. I didn't have enuff girlfriend time as I was growing up. In fact, I really had very little. For some odd reason, I really didn't like "chicks" much. I mean I hung out with a few along the way, but I mostly had guy friends. Now looking back, I regret that. That is one thing I would change if I could.

 Enjoying the ride to Erie. urlLink

 Birthday bliss! urlLink

 Bitsys trip to Petco for birthday treats! urlLink

 Yesterday was my one week "smoke free" milestone, so Hubby took me out for chinese to celebrate. I really enjoyed it, especially it seems like it's been a long time since we've been there.....and I have been craving it for awhile now. Anyway it was good. The not smoking thing is really going well, in fact so well that it really surprises me when I think about it. I still have moments when I get blind-sided by the urges, and they're a bitch when they come along, but all in all, it's going along great. I can go hours and it doesn't even cross my mind. I can't believe that. I never thought I'd be able to say that. Hours.

 Happy "1st" birthday Bitsy!! urlLink

 Our puppy Bitsy turns one today! I think I'm just amazed that a year has flown by.......and a reason to celebrate a fun little occasion! She's such a sweetie, and we just love her to "Bits"!!

 Well, I'm gonna be watching Sex in the city on a regular basis. I really enjoyed it tonight, and I'm going to tune in tomorrow night as well. The only thing that has me confused, is why are they running episode one next week instead of this week? Like tonight. I don't get the reasoning behind it. Hmmm. Am I a dumbass for not getting it? Anyway, I really enjoyed the show, and how I was able to escape my "little boring life" for awhile. I need that sometimes. Nah. I really mean alot .

 I went for a cruise in the Vettster last night with the t-tops off. Fantastic! I drove up to Erie, around the Bayfront to the Dock and back, and it was so relaxing, I didn't want it to end. Funny thing happened as I was approaching 79......I saw a new Vette flying up on my left, and I thought "Aw shit, just keep going and don't give me any grief". Well, I caught a red light with the "New and improved Vette", and when I reluctantly looked over...it was two grey haired fellas,(I'm guessing to be around mid 60's or so!) laughing their asses off just having a blast tooling around town, in their Vette. I couldn't help but get a big grin, and I gave em a thumbs up. Way to go guys, that's what life's all about! Made my night. (I was relieved they didn't want to race!!)

 Well, as of 1am this morning it will be six days of no smoking for me. This is a miracle, especially since I'm doing it "cold turkey" to boot. I never figured I could do this without help of some sort. Go figure. It's not easy, believe me, but it's very rewarding. I literally have to go from minute to minute, as one moment everything is great, and the next I'm suddenly blindsided by a terrible urge....and I get anxious for awhile. Sometimes I get really pissed. I have to take deep breaths 'till it passes, which even though it only takes a few moments, sometimes it feel like forever . Being addicted to something sucks. Getting away from it is no easy matter, but I know I can do this. I will not go back. I've come too far now. I just need to make it through today.

 I feel like crapola today. I have a damn cold and it's pissing me off because I don't feel like doing anything, and lord knows there's alot that needs doing around here. I just felt the need to share my misery. Thanks for listening. *sniffle*

 My favorite bargain bin!&nbsp; urlLink urlLink

 I went to one of my favorite shopping haunts today, and even though I really didn't feel like shopping due to my cold, once I got there and started looking around, well damn it felt great! I went to Gabes to get Hubbs some gifts for his birthday, but also to look for a few goodies for myself. It's been months since I've bought anything other than household stuff and groceries. Well, I must say I did pretty well as I found a great pair of Faded Glory white shorts, two cute bangle bracelets, a great sparkly fun ring, an awsome pair of sunglasses and a pair of dragonfly earring that shouted "BUY US NOW!!!", so I did. and the best part is I got it all for........drumroll please.......$13.00!! Oh yeah! No buyers remorse here. It felt great, and I must admit I forgot all about my miserable cold the whole time I was shopping. Oh yeah, I did get Hubbs a few things for his birthday, but I still need to find a few more items on the list. I need to do this more often. I had a blast. See, laughters not the only best medicine, now is it? Goodies from my shopping trip&nbsp; urlLink urlLink

 urlLink Summer visitor!&nbsp; urlLink Oh my God....I can't believe that they finally came up with a way for people like me to have photos on our web page. I am a very happy gal right now!!

 Another deer hit photo urlLink

 A deer hit Hubbys car this morning on his way to work. He's fine...deer isn't. And no air conditioning! urlLink

 The one I won today..love it too! urlLink

 Shawl I won in first auction...love it!! urlLink

 Woohoo!&nbsp;I won the black shawl I was bidding on. Auctions are sooo exciting and addicting. I'm done with the shawls now that I have the two colors I want. Plus, the lady who has them is wising up and upping her starting bids. Someone must have told her she was not asking enuff for them. Lucky me, I got in and out just in time. Story of my life. Really.

 The shawl I won on EBay came today, and I am soooo happy with the quality! I just love it...it's even prettier than in the photos.&nbsp; I'll post a photo tomorrow.

 My niece Kayla at the reunion. urlLink

 Well, the family reunion has come and gone for another year, and other than the all day rain, I think it was a nice day. At least I had a pretty good time.&nbsp; Well, the chicken and all the side-dishes were&nbsp; good.&nbsp; Hubby and I stayed at my parents last night, and other than Bitsy waking me up at 5 friggin' AM , then 7AM, then 8:45 AM, to stand out in the backyard, in my pajamas, doing nuthin', no pee, no poop, no friggin' nuthin', I slept pretty well! I'm glad to be home though. I'd like to go down to my folks for a couple of days alone, just to hang out, and&nbsp; help them around the house with a couple of things.&nbsp; There's a few things that could use a good cleaning, and I like scrubbing someone elses house alot better than my own! Much more interesting indeed. So maybe in a few weeks I'll head down for a little visit. For now, I'm heading to dreamland, as I'm tired from all those early morning activities.&nbsp; *yawm* Goodnight!&nbsp; ;)

 Okay. What are the chances of my fitting a small dog in a carrier, a suitcase, a bundtcake, and the dogs travel bag in here? urlLink

 Grandma's bedspread I told you about urlLink

 I had a nice day yesterday. Nuthin' special, just one of those days where you're very content just being "homey", if you know what I mean. I cleaned a bit, washed clothes a bit, baked some super yummy brownies, put a vintage bedspread from my grandma on my bed for a summer change,(It looks very "cottage-y"), went to the church store to browse, and came home with $3.40 worth of "treasures", and then cooked a wonderful fried fish dinner, that I must say, was the best I've ever made. Hubby agreed. I told him it was due to the $.79 fish breading mix I got at WalMart last week. I will stock up on that stuff. Damn it was good! I accidentally burned my arm with hot oil, as I was frying the fish. That sucked. I'll live. All in all, a neat day. Muggy as hell(literally) outside though. What do I know. Maybe hell has dry heat, like Phoenix. Anyway, I'm so glad we have our little air conditioner chugging away in the living room. Humidity and I have never been very good friends. In fact, we loathe eachother.

 Cute potholders I got today for .20 each, at the church discount store! urlLink

 A beautiful bouquet my wonderful Hubby gave me today! urlLink

 Went to Gabes and found this cute jelly bag for $3.00! No shit! urlLink

 One month today...I'm a non-smoker! urlLink

 I suddenly need a pretty scarf...so much Ebay so little $$$$. urlLink

 I was just looking at the two photo posts from yesterday, and you'd never guess that my brother and my hubby and dad were all at the same event, would ya? Cracked me up.

 Are we having fun yet? urlLink

 My brother Mike + Bourbon + Moms hat = an entertaining evening! urlLink

 I have a new obsession........raspberry creamsicles. No shit, these things are awesome!

 I would love wearing these to anywhere....very tres chic Cinderella. urlLink

 I really need to do some serious needless spending, but no job = no fun shopping trips. Ugh. I've been in a really terrible state of mind lately, and I think that getting out and about amongst the costume jewelry, the racks of bright summer clothing, and all the delightful accessories would lift my spirits, all right. Only problem is cashola. $$$$$. I think I need to get a job soon. I'm thinking Fall, if I can hold out that long.

 No words needed for these. Wow! urlLink

 I need these in fushcia and black, please! urlLink

 I need these badly urlLink

 This is my mood.....tense urlLink

 All men are on my shit list tonight. Well, maybe not my Dad. But I'm sure he's on my Moms.

 I used to love watching MTV. I loved it when you could actually see music videos. Do you remember when you could see music videos on MTV? Damn it seems like ages ago, doesn't it? I tuned in tonight, and I saw a dreadful show about Jessica Simpsons sister, Ashlee. I just don't know what to say. Like having Jessica on a show isn't bad enough.
