 Ok. Frankly, if Dan Brown is the best mainstream fiction has to offer, I shall continue to stay away from that kettle of cod. I enjoyed his plot but did not enjoy his writing. I don't think there is a contradiction there. I found the book quite gripping until the end, when the twists just started piling on a little too thick. Oddly, I don't mind this sort of stuff in a movie, but this is not my kind of book. It is not MY kind of book - that's all. I may have chosen to crib about the sort of critical reviews Brown gets, but that has more to do with cribbing about professional reviewers (ratings whores that they are) than with the process by which I formed my opinion of the book in question. Remember, it came to me highly reccomended by someone whose opinion I DO value,and I still didn't like it eventually. Looking forward to Baigent though!!! Finally in our usual spirit of one-upmanship, a few peripheral rejoinders: The Beatles analogy doesn't fit - they started at a time when the overall rock lyric was of that faishion and then were among the first bands to show you could write about something else. RK Narayan's prose is BETTER than Roy's - it is economical and clear. Vocabulary is NOT the yardstick I use. Lastly, If reading Eco makes me too accustomed to quality, I fail to see what is wrong with that. Going by that argument, a classical music listener, for instance, has no right to criticise bhangra-pop.

 hey jp, visited your blog after quite some time, it was interesting but..like i told you i actually wanted to put up what follows on the blog, but i thought it wasn't ethically right on my part to do so. read it and if you feel there's anything in it, put it up on the blog. i leave the choice entirely up to you. so here's my ramble....... Man, in an age where Jerry Cantrell opens as a support act for Nickleback, can we afford to lead our lives and let our thoughts be swayed by the teeming multitude of sub-normal intelligences. We know that a generation brought up on sidney sheldons and britney spears et al will never 'appreciate' a Michael moorcock or a doves. But just because they do not acknowledge these things do not mean we give up on these timeless classics. but that said, sometimes even these sub-sixty IQ possessors do sometimes strike gold (not unlike the classic and oft quoted example of giving a bunch of monkeys a bunch of typewriters, and given enough time they'll churn out shakespeare's sonnets). But just because they endorse a certain artist or writer does not mean we can take it for granted that their current 'flavour of the month' is crappy. If we do that we're merely, like I said, falling into the trap of letting their uncooked and nitwitted thoughts cloud our judgment. So why am I saying this? Because I've been noticing your attitude towards dan brown nowadays. It seems to be swinging from one end to other. On the one hand you appreciate his plotting and pacing, but then go on to sprinkle it with a review written by someone who doesn't understand what she's talking about. You say that Angels & Demons is the kind of book you wouldn't read if it didn't have all those history/conspiracy angles, but then, my question is, what else do you need? Let me rephrase, isn't that enough, for the time being? What'd you expect? Appendices and footnotes? In a mainstream fiction book? Dan brown never said anything about promising theses on the illuminati and or supersonic jets. He wanted to write a mainstream novel that would appeal to the 'masses' so that he could make some money and I think he's succeeded in both of these endeavours. I think that so used have we become to the literary quality of a eco that we find anything even a little below it worthless. Speaking of creativity for the masses, look at the beatles. They wrote for the masses. They were the first boy band 9and you know how we hate boy bands). But their songs today are anthems. they're the beatles. "I get high when I see you go by, my oh my, when you sigh my mind inside just flies, butterflies" Are these great lines of poetry? but it's the beatles and they did it in the way that only the beatles could. They played for the masses. But they made their point. bad analogy maybe, but you see the point. But the difference between you and me reading Angels & Demons or a Da Vinci code, compared to let's say, a person who only reads jeffrey archer, is that we can appreciate the subject matter more because we've read up enough on them and we know the general background from where brown is coming from. For a person who's read foucualt's pendulum, the da vinci code or angels & demons is a breeze. But it does not in anyway devalue brown's efforts. And then you got totally put off Dan Brown because some twat somewhere praised Dan Brown saying that he is proving you can write historical fiction in vernacular English, not just scholarly Italian. You know he's a twat, and twats usually come up with twatty reviews and remarks, so why bother? Ok so his characterization is like ready-to-order template for a Hollywood casting crew. Think Robert Langdon, think Harrison ford. Think of the camerlengo and Gabriel Byrne comes straight to my mind. yes, it does not show too much of originality on brown's part, but is that such a bad thing? I'm just coming off Philip K Dick's Man in the High Castle and you should see the characters in that. Dick is so descriptive about each character and their attributes that a seasoned movie watcher who's also interested in kung fu movies can easily come up with a cast for high castle just like that. But does that mean dick is bad or that he has 20/20 vision when it comes to Hollywood. If anything look at the number of his books that have been turned into movies. As to the point that everybody seems to have had a trauma, I think in the context of the story it all unwinds it self out well. At least it's not meaningless. It's like the claasic bollywood formula. Action, drama, suspense, sex, emotion all in one. It kinda makes the story that much more interesting. And as to everybody in angels having a grouse or a 'drama' in life, in the said context it provides every character with a "motive" which I think is the usual case with any book, great or otherwise. In this particular book, all the drama that you so disliked was actually convenient to the author wouldn't you say? Everybody had a reason to be doing what they are doing or did, and are in the place they are right now. Twists and turns also, aren't bad. It's at least better than the boy-meets-girl formula. And like I told you the other day, I don't consider the quality of prose or the vocabulary used as an indication of a book's quality or as a yardstick to judge the idea. If both are good, nice. But I think it's the 'idea' that matters. If vocabulary and artyfarty prose were the benchmarks arundhati roy would be kicking rk narayan's ass. But give me an rk narayan any day. Arundhati roy can console herself with the things of small dogs. Now that I've said all this I'll tell you why I like dan brown and why I've feverishly read 3 of his books. The 4th will not escape my grasp for a long time. Firstly I like his pluralist attitude. And his choice of subjects. His pacing. His twists. To tell you the truth I read da vinci code in 2 sitting all because I was saying to myself "just one more page" "just one more page". More on me later. But I guess I've as usal rambled on enough and I shall in the interests of conclusion, wind up this ramble once more reiterating, dan brown isn't as bad as you make him out to be. -Shenoy

 They have plans. They make calls. They drive cars or perhaps just modified Bisleri bottles. They do not have lockjaw at this point in time. The easiest lessons are the ones that burn. Even without plans they go places. There are places. There are people. There is a sound. Do you remember when the sound was your sound? Now it is a plastic wafer you cannot savour try though you may to douse it with ketchup and/or tomato chutney. Sometimes they talk cosmic. When they do this the universe shrinks and becomes real. God leaps up from the old easychair in the verandah at the retirement home and leans in close listening giggling and laughing out loud. Sometimes they feel quite kindly towards humanity. They will not tell you what a harpy was or who Shoko Asahara is. On this warm afternoon, neither will I.

 my proclivity for rabid intolerance is flaring up again...YIPPEEE!!!

 Thoughts on Angels and Demons? A tight, gripping plot. Average-to-mediocre prose. Low information density, considering it's a historical/tech-spec novel. And I feel he lays on the twists a bit too thick - by the time the final twist happened, I just couldn't care a damn anymore. Oh and check this out, this is the ridiculous review of The Davinci Code I'd mentioned earlier: WOW... Blockbuster perfection. An exhilaratingly brainy thriller. Not since the advent of Harry Potter has an author so flagrantly delighted in leading readers on a breathless chase and coaxing them through hoops. --Janet Maslin THE NEW YORK TIMES

 I've started out on Dan Brown's Angels And Demons. The prose is pedestrian - mediocre at best. But the story is compelling and easy reading. I'll probably finish it tonight. I guess my prose standards are just a bit too artyfarty, but I do find this mainstream-thriller way of writing quite off-putting. For one thing all the descriptions of characters read like they were written keeping in mind a Hollywood casting director's needs. And the depth of allusion is just - it's just not happening. Brown writes for the average, dismally ignorant American reader, I guess. This is the kind of book I wouldn't read if it didn't have all those history/conspiracy angles. Yes, the plot is very compelling. Still, it's distressing to see the sort of reviews Brown gets, one person actually described it as the most exciting read since Harry Potter or something lke that. This is a sad world we live in and I'm glad I'm not here forever.

 The Science Fiction Foundation has just released a book of critical essays on one of my favourite contemporary SF authors: Ken MacLeod. Intense huh. Read about it at urlLink Emerald City.

 For the first time in a while, with Baudolino, I've finished a book and now feel sad because I wish I was still reading that story, exploring that world. Considering the assembly-line rate at which I read these days, that's quite a big deal.

 Far too many reviews of Umberto Eco's Baudolino attempt to measure it by the standards of The Name Of the Rose. That was a far more straightforward (or at least recognisable) creature - a Holmesian pastiche, set in a mediaeval monastery and laced with generous dollops of Eco's trademark erudition. It followed the familair pattern of the Doyle-esque tale of detection through ratiocination, it consciously worked around a recognisable and familiar template, which is probably why it went down so well. Like The Island of the Day Before, Baudlino is far more removed in time, not chronologically so much as in narrative approach. I'm no mediaevalist, but I have read enough legends and traveller's tales from the era to recognise where Eco is coming from on this one. Like most narratives from the era it depicts, this book rambles from one event to the next taking time to detail minutae like the journeys between places, lavish background detail on each new location and so on. It adapts to the content - from Baudlolino's exploits as a Parisian student to high intrigue and manuevering in his mentor and adopted father, Barbarossa's court to tales of battle and the wide-screen traveller's yarn that is the high point of the story. Many reviewers seem to feel that this supposed infelicity of the writing of that era could have been avoided - I advise them to stick with Jeffrey Archer in future. At some point, you have to agree to take a book like this on certain terms - suspend your 'modern' yen for tight plotting and extensive character developemnt, and you will be amply rewarded with a feast of delights both sacred and profane. Yes, the tale rambles - but why is that a bad thing? It's the story of the life of one person, and our lives do tend to be rather rambling and directionless at times, and considering that the narrator is an expert liar who has ceased being able to tell apart his own lies from reality, fantastic elements are inevitable. What I would complain about is, on that long journey (with passes through all manner of wonders, including a river of stone - surely both Eco and his translator's central achievement of sheer descriptive prose in this work - and the mountan fortress of the Assassins) Eco is less concerned with developing the characters - who all wind up seeming rather hollow with the exception of Baudolino himself - than with describing the fantastic. The narrative itself is a bit unstable - essentially we are overhearing Baudolino telling the story of his life to a historian whom he has rescued from the sack of Contantinople, but more often, it seems as if the story is being told by an omniscient author who is not afraid to butt in and share his opinions. But these are minor complaints. Baudolino is an entertainment - and a succesful one at that, which also manages to raise questions about the relation between reality and fantasy, the reliability of history and the like. I could go on about these philosophical questions, but like the endless debate between two of Baudolino's companions on the existence of the vacuum, that's a discussion that could go on forever without any real resolution.

 Another relaxed weekend. Friday went by largely without incident, apart from a rather nice Diwali lunch with the grandparents. I'd been resisting the idea for a while, for no real reason except a sort of carry-over of the adolescent's unease towards socialising with the older generation. Well, I finished adolescing some time ago, and it is time to move on. In the evening, I met Prem who is finally down from Dubai. He's going to be in India for a while now - so hopefully some good music/movie binges await. Plus Prem cracks good jokes. Prem also had a gift for me - a urlLink Holga. Await further developments. Saturday morning I wandered around Hennur and Fraser Town with Mark, a specialist in 360-degree photography, shooting some buildings for a clients' site. In the evening, my friend Gautham Khandige took a bunch of us out for dinner at a Caribbean restaurant in Indiranagar called Sue's Kitchen. The food was delicious, a lot like our food, but just different enough to make it interesting. I stuffed myself senseless. The piped reggae music, on the other hand, was deeply avoidable. After that, we headed down to Java City for coffee (iced tea in my case) and conversation. The conversation was slightly hindered by the fact that the cafe had hired a dj for the night, and he felt the need to pump the volume up to justify his presence. The dj was a study in utter redundancy - Java City has a Worldspace connection, and any of the channels on WS could have done what he did - select and play songs from a bunch of cds - without the added annoyance of having this chap hanging around and, as if to compensate for the fact that he himself wasn't actually operating anything apart from the 'play' button, making deeply intense expressions, probably calculated to give the impression that he was somehow making the music happen through sheer mental effort. Bleah. Fuck them and the discs they spin, that's all I can say. Sunday was a blissfully lazy experience - I never even left home, just wallowed around reading Eco and Blish. More on that later.

 all this 'recreational reading' business gets me down. what is the term implying? i am a follower of the written word. and i read because i find no better stimulant than the words (not just for my aging process) .. so while a lot of the 'recreational reading' material can turn stale, and quite boring, i find meself looking up to arbitrary writings around .. frankly, i consider all of the opinionated ('critique') stuff to be second-hand words .. but that's just another opinion. this blog has held my attention for a long (add another long for emphasis) while, solely for the reason that i can appreciate the opinions being posted up here (if not fully comprehend the purpose of some of the repartees) .. this lone message is a direct result of one line i found in here that really really tickled me .. and in fact, restored my faith in the glory of an individual .. the line was lost somewhere therein, but over all of the rest, only this matters: "I find that I am less and less interested in logical debate than in exploring my own opinions." - jp thank you. am going to enjoy today very much.

 Thousands of pilgrims have been flocking to a public toilet in a remote French village, following reports that the face of Christ has miraculously appeared in the limescale in the bottom of one of its toilet bowls.

 More fearsome than the the dreaded Dear John, this sinister missive is sent in response to Customer Complaints. On his site (www.hipiers.com) fantasy punster Piers Anthony recounts the origins of this epistolatory horror: Once upon a time a traveler took a train ride, and was appalled to find the coach overridden with roaches. He wrote an angry letter to the president of the railroad company. In due course he received the president's response: "Dear Mr. Gleep: Thank you for calling our attention to this problem. We are shocked, shocked to learn that you encountered such a situation. Rest assured that we will do everything in our power to clear our coaches of vermin and maintain the quality of hygiene you have every right to expect. We appreciate responsible passengers such as yourself, and value your business." Well, now; that was very good. But Mr. Gleep noticed that something was clipped to the letter. Apparently it was the president's instruction to his secretary, who had forgotten to remove it before mailing the letter. (Such things can happen when handling hundreds of similar letters a day.) It was a scrawled note: "Send this SOB the bug letter." You may or may not like Piers Anthony - personally, I wade through his books with great amusement, but no illusions that they have any enduring qualities apart from the ability to amuse me each time. Anyway, he writes a pretty good urlLink Newsletter.

 Emotionally I am an atheist. I don't have the evidence to prove that God doesn't exist, but I so strongly suspect he doesn't that I don't want to waste my time. - Isaac Asimov

 The statement 'Kill 'em all, let god sort 'em out' probably originated in 1209 when the Albigensian Crusade, the genocidal war against Cathar heretics in southern France began. An officer in the army asked the Papal legate at the siege of Beziers, Arnaud-Amaury, Abbot of Citeaux, how he could tell apart heretics and true believers. He was told: "Show mercy neither to order, nor to age, nor to sex....Cathar or Catholic, Kill them all... God will know his own....". Ahhhh. The actual quote as follows: "Tuez-les tous; Dieu reconnaitra les siens." ("Kill them all; for the Lord knoweth them that are His.")

 Why am I no longer interested in debate? Consider the fact that I'm a lifelong atheist. My beliefs run contrary to those of virtually everyone I know. What am I supposed to do? Engage every one of them in an ongoing argument? For what? Do I really want to change their minds? No. I'm not conceited enough to expect people to give up on ways of thinking and feeling that have been dear to them for so long just because I have a few 'rational' reasons why their beliefs are objectively baseless. An atheist theocracy (if I can use a paradoxical term like that) would be as authoritarian and rigid as any existing system based on religion. People are varied, and largely set in their ways. I'm not a crusader. I don't really care all that much for humanity or 'the big picture'. That's why I'd rather shut up and just pursue my own beliefs and interests without getting into huge sessions of intellectual dissection regarding them. I don't want to change the world, and I don't want the world to change me.

 It's all just opinion, and I find that I am less and less interested in logical debate than in exploring my own opinions. I suppose this is the hardening of the mental arteries that precedes the middle-aged phase that awaits me another decade hence. Honestly though, it is possible to give too much credence to genre. Just to raise the Borwnian sceptre one last time, Pradeep Sebastian, in the sunday supplement of The Hindu, had a line on The DaVinci Code which sums up what I find specious in the praise the lad is getting - it was something like 'imagine finding the concept of the eternal feminine in a mainstream thriler!'. This reminds me of the remark about the singing dog - you are not surprised that is done well, that it is done at all. Having said that, I realise there are equally questionable sections in my library - all those Edgar Rice Burroughs Mars novels for instance. And I really do seem to forgive HP Lovecraft all the infelicities and ineptitudes of his writing just because those fungi from Yuggoth really do creep me out. Thank god for differences, and internal inconsistencies. Life would be boring without them, and Shenoy and me wouldn't have the chance to banter (or is it bicker?) like this!!!

 one can only question logic....not personal opinions and another's faith. and in that spirit i can this thing once and for all. i just thought there was a logical argument developing and someone had to take the other side (funny..for a guy who likes authoritarianism, i've always liked 2 sides to an argument) but since it no longer seems to be a logical argument...oh well.... but in the spirit of cleaning up leftovers and wiping off fartleberries, here are a few rejoinders to your rejoinders to my rejoinder to your remarks... by your own admission your prose standards are a just a bit too artyfarty. by my own admission, as an be seen below, the beatles may have been a bad analogy, but it was just a peripheral point, not the crux of the matter. NO. nobody actualy has a RIGHT to do anything, rights are all subjective. so it follows that a classical music listener has no RIGHT to criticise bhangra pop, BUT, listening to classical music puts him in a POSITION to criticise songs from the abovementioned genre, provided it is has a sound logical basis. it is so easy to say it's MY opinion, this is what I think and to end it all...because then, another guy just can't say anything. can he? but yes, on one point i do agree with you, it's a sad world we live in, someone stop it, and i'll log off.....

 For the third sunday in a row, I've just stayed at home sleeping reading watching tv. And feeling quite happy with it. I used to be like this when I was younger, right up until the beginning of my college days, when rock-band and cul-team activities finally sucked me out of my solitary splendor. Then came the pub thing. This spilled over into my working life, too. At least, until recently. Lately, a large part of my crowd has more or less dropped out of my life. For one thing, I have a job, and most of my friends from the music crowd don't. So our routines are very different, and mutually exclsive. Then too, the same applies to most of my working friends also. I seem quite content with meeting up with people a coule of weekday evenings, and spending my weekends more or less on my own. This may seem odd and somewhat inside-out, but that's what appears to work for me. It's possible this is just a non-socal phase, like others I've gone through. Only time will tell. In the meantime, no alarms and no surprises, please...

 Well, another week trundles to an end. I finished two books this week, both very good reads - Greg Bear's Strength of Stones and John Gribbin & Marcus Chown's Reunion. Strength of Stones builds from a future that that already passed, a turn of the millennium world where people have grown tired of the desert monotheisms and the havoc they have wreaked on the world. Faced with scorn and hostility on all sides, Yehova's children, the remaning Jews, Christians and Muslims buy themselves a desert planet to shift to en masse. They name the planet God-Does-Battle and engage one of humanity's finest architects to build vast computerised mobile cities. These cities are programmed to banish any citizens who fall from the faiths they follow. Sure enough, in a while, the cities summarily banish all their citizens. The story - actually three inter-linked short stories - described how humans, human-mimics manufactured by the dying cities and the resurrected architect, returned to to check on his creations' progress manage to find a way to salvage some knowledge from the cities and prevent the people of God-Does-Battle from regressing entirely into savagery. What I found interesting was the implicit comment on human nature - if we were truly to be accountable to the beliefs we create, we would all fall short. Perhaps these beliefs are meant to be an aspiration, not a guide? Also, there's the question of whether it makes sense to use machines to enforce very human ideas. At one point, one of the characters reminds a computer in a dying city that it's purpose is supposed to be to serve humanity, and that should override everything else. What struck me was that the reason the cities had ceased to serve people was because they were trying to follow their initial commands to ensure that these people adhere to the beliefs they had chosen to live by. Perhaps the real question here is whether religion serves humanity in any positive way. And if it doesn't... The end of the story left me a bit puzzled though. i'm not sure quite what it meant. The architect, apparently, created a portal back to Earth. And he sends one of the human-mimics through it back to the homeworld. The whole point of this somehow isn't very clear. The book failed to resolve itself at the very end, but it was still worth the read for the strength of ideas. The story itself worked well, too, except for the ending. Reunion was another good read. I'll write about that one later.

 I'm in the zone again. You know, that zone, where everything works but you have to pour out so much energy to keep it that way.

 Getting cued into pop-culture is fun. The trends, the poses, the reference points, the ideas...it's even more fun to decide it's all a lot of public wankery anyway and get on with the obscurity of my own private wankery.

 Whoa. I finished Barry Malzberg's The Men Inside last night. The tech-spec it builds from is one I've come across before - human miniaturisation for the purpose of entering a livng human body to perform surgery. Fantastic Voyage, anyone? But Malzberg's vision of the future is drastically different from nearly anything Asimov ever thought up. It's a bleak world where most of humanity subsists in grim, violence-ridden cities Downside and only the elite few can live a better life. One of the few ways out from Downside is to become a Messenger, people who are miniaturised to excise cancers from patients wealthy enough to pay for the procedure. There is a downside to becoming a Messenger - the process renders them impotent. But this hardly matters to Leslie Blount, who has never had much room for emotion. Although he does seem capable of a fair amount of hate, specifically towards his father, an incessant gambler who keeps thinking up new ways to blow all his money on horse races. Also, as Blount realises, there is nothing particualrly grand or noble about the Messengers' Institute. By maintaining a stranglehold on the patents for the miniaturisation process, Hulm, the inventor of the Projector, has created an artificial scarcity, ensuring his own wealth and denying treatment to scores of cancer sufferers who are too poor to afford the treatment. Blount decides to declare his contempt for this and walk out on the day of his graduation, but is ultimately carried away by the grandeur of the ceremony and takes his oaths. Then, when he is a fully-fledged Messenger on his 16th patient, he suddenly discovers the urge to kill his patient. Messengers who kill are a part of Institute folklore - the proximity to the inner workings of a living being, the ease with which that being can then be made to cease living - surely this is a temptation some would have succumbed to? The folklore has it that such Messengers were not betrayed to the outside world but shuffled off into assignments where they would not directly treat patients. After a variety of painful flashbacks, awkward fantasies and even more awkward real-life encounters, Blount does the deed. And is caught and executed. A fairly simple story, in that sense, and written in a sort of breathless, knowing style that manages to be both funny and terribly sad. But what exactly is it all about? I think, at some level, it is a refutation of the cozy SF notion that the advance of science and technology will give us all better lives. To continue with the SF-deconstruction, Malzberg posits a negative equivalent of the bold explorer of final frontiers, an internal astronaut whose feelings about his vocation are as different from that of the typical SF Spacer as is his destination in the tissues of a living human being. Blount seems to be a fairly pathetic person - but not, Malzberg reassures us, particularly malicious. Finally, his act of murder seems less a retaliation against rich, greedy patients selfishly extending their worthless lives, or a retribution against the venal Institute or perhaps even some long-delayed revenge on his father, as it is an expression of his need to obliterate his own pointless existence. Early on, Blount realises that he cannot really imagine his life as a retired Messenger. As a kid Downside he had no real prospects, as a Messenger, he realises that there are no real prospects. In the end, he attains the only real 'way out' left to him - his own dissolution. A terribly negative book then, but not an unenjoyable read at all. I don't know if Malzberg always writes like this - but its an interesting style. A little too intrusive at times, but perhaps more effective in the service of a stronger plot?

 I picked up Ken MacLeod's Engine City, the last volume of the Engines of Light series on Friday. I've been having a great time with it. Apart from Ken MacLeod's usual dry wit, sly references and vivid visualisations, the whole point of this series is coming together in my head in a rather satisfying way. I'm beginning to see what Jeremy Smith meant by calling his books Gnostic potboilers. The Spider peoples' 'infection' is a source of the sort of personalised realisation of God, which Gnosticism focusses on. Speaking of the god stuff. There are gods in MacLeod's universe - but they are not God. Theicide is a crime, but one that is very possible and at times even necessary. The gods are perhaps the ultimate 'hidden masters', they are real, we can talk to them, they do not answer prayers, and their sole commandment to us is: KEEP THE NOISE DOWN! I also enjoy the way MacLeod has tied all the 20th century paranoia about alien Greys, Men In Black, UFOs and abductions into a coherent and even believable meta-story. The man seriously rocks when it comes to that kind of large-scale plot-engineering. The smaller-scale plot details this time around are a just a little less satisfying - the characterisation just isn't as strong as before and there are times when the plot seems to be folding back on itself in some rather pointless ways. These are small complaints. Ken MacLeod was the man who pulled me back into rabid SF fandom, and this novel gives me no major reasons to stop considering him to be one of the most important contemporary writers of SF.

 Quite a weekend, all told. Satruday night in particular developed into the sort of epic drinkalogue I haven't had in ages. There was also some beer-fuelled Brownian motion among the people at the pub I was in. Basically, this guy lost his balance and fell on me and then I fell on this girl who was standing behind me. Ah, pubs, they're such fun. If I was one of those hot studly rockers you read about wherever it is you read about such things, I'd have wound up pinioned to the woman all night long, but being the sort of soul I am, I merely mumbled aplogies, which were brushed aside politely but with loads of 'metchul attitude' and carried on with my beer. After all, I had only fallen for her in a strictly Newtonian sense. Sunday Prem and me had a far more dignified drink, but even more enjoyable, followed by dinner at Kohinoor. I also picked up a couple of good books from the SF Masterworks series - Jack Vance's Emphyrio and Matheson's The Shrinking Man. I'm currently reading Emphyrio and it is very gripping, so far.

 Here are some updates on my recent reading, though: 3rd November: I've finished Niven and Pournelle's Oath of Fealty. Although it was a decent read, I can't say I liked the book. It depicts a sort of benign police-state (Todos Santos) in conflict with a fairly normal democratic city ( a near-future Los Angeles), and clearly sides with the police-state. Todos Santos seems to be an embodiment of the more right-wing libertarian ethos. There is great personal freedom, no taxes, but everyone has entered into a contract with the boss. Its a pretty feudal set-up and all the people who live there seem to derive honor from their loyalty to the system and to the chief. The people who oppose Todos Santos are shown as rather unsympathetic parodies of extreme environmentalist guerillas (including the mandatory burly lesbian, for no real reason) . LA politicians are pulled into the conflict when the son of a leading politico is killed in a raid on Todos Santos. A state of economic warfare between the city and the tower ensues, which is resolved with severe arm-twisitng and skulldugerry by Todos Santos, and also by the nefarious activities of the environmentalists, which clearly show that Todos Santos is right to defend itself in any way, as far as the authors are concerned. I find the story hard to swallow. I can't imagine that the authors actually want us to think that we should aspire to live in that sort of set-up, in a rigid hierarchy with no real personal liberty or privacy but lots of distracting freedoms and of course the right to get rich. But that, apparently, is what they are selling. The characters are also one-dimensional and the plot has a variety of inconsequential and even irritating love affairs thrown in. I've now started on Greg Bear's 'Beyond Heaven's River' and it promises to be a far better read, so far. Today: Greg Bear's Beyond Heaven's River is progressing quite nicely. The main character is a WW2 Japanese bomber who is abducted by msyerious aliens and taken to a place where he spends ages living in a virtual world of his own creation while being given info on the world outside. Eventually, the aliens dissappear as mysteriously and he is found by humans of that era. Which is where we come in. The title refers to the fact that the Japanese call the milky way heaven's river. So far, the story is quite intriguing, there are lots of questions and the promise of interestingly unfolding answers, although Bear does seem to tend to leave a lot hanging in his novels...

 Oh wow. I've finally regained access to my blog thanks to some rather odd stunts. Sadly, I've lost track of what I was going to say about the remaining part of trip to Suratkal. Perhaps I shall get around to it another day, but the rhythm has been broken.

 Well here we are again. Back at the grindstone. But let me tell you all about my trip to Suratkal and Kundapura. On wednesday, I get to Khandige's house by about 7.45. Olo is already there. I've already stuffed myself silly with a lavish dinner at home, but Khandige's mother offers me more food, so I pig out even more, setting the tone for a very fulfilling journey, stomachwise. Presently, we pick up our tiny burdens and swagger down to the bus stand, sucking on a clove cigarette and picking up whiskey for the journey. At the bus stand, Olo is convinced that every bus that leaves was actually our bus. Eventually we have to pacify him with a glass of lassi. In due course the bus arrives and takes us on a peripatetic tour of Bangalore. We step out for herbal relief when it stops in Gandhinagar. Eventually, we leave Bangalore by 11.00 PM. Sleepy and calm after the spliff, I never do get around to drinking that whiskey. I have Iron Maiden on my discman - British Metal is quite the thing to travel to - and soon subside into the mists of sleep. We reach Suratkal at around 6.30 the next morning, drag ourselves to a cafe where Olo and me forget that people in Karnataka drown their idlis in sambar. The submerged idlis are followed by a rather unique bun, the likes of which I have never tasted elsewhere. After that, we try and find our way to the groom's house. Several people direct and misdirect us until finally, we are in the compound next to Ganesh's place, and his neighbours quite gamely makes us jump the wall to get to our destination. We are greeted warmly and finally get to meet the Ganesh himself. We adjourn to a quiet room upstairs, passing through a chaos of relatives making chirpy birdlike calls to each other. Over coffee and breakfast (yes, more breakfast!) we shoot the breeze. Later, we walk down to the main part of town to buy film for Khandige's camera and to book a room in a hotel, because we suspect we may want to get a little extra-curricular tonight. We find a room that is both cheap and clean. This is the land of miracles. Back at Ganesh's place, we loll about as someone fixes up a fan for us. After a while, the Bombay faction arrives - Ravi and Suresh. Much breeze shooting ensues, interspersed with squabbling over who gets to bathe in what order. In the process, I somehow manage to have my third breakfast of the day. After breakfast, we head out to visit a beach near Ganesh's place. It is quiet, but not very clean. We are soon to discover THE beach, though. We stroll around the area, meeting several healthy kittens and stopping for some tender coconut water along the way. Then it's back to Ganesh's place. After that, we all doze off for a while. Wake up just in time for a delicious lunch on Ganesh's terrace. After that, we head out to the hotel, with strict injunctions from Ganesh to be at his place by 6.00 the next morning to travel with him to Kundapura for the wedding. Ravi and Suresh are quite pleased with the room, so they'll stay with us, too. I break out the whiskey bottle and Khandige, Olo and I get mildly pasted. Then, we head out to the main beach in town. Await further details in the next installment, tomorrow.

 Whoa. I wasn't able to access this blog all day. Will update copiously tomorrow.

 'Today I am of the opinion, experientially, that the supposedly visionary aspects of any drug experience, regardless of how marvelous-seeming at the time (or how cocktail-lounge banal) represent no more than a tweaking of incoming stimuli. 'But you're drowning in the waters the mystics walked on,' said a saddened theologian to Leary and Alpert, early on, when they had explained the import of Dr. Hoffman's benison.

 Right now, I'm reading Jack Vance's Night Lamp. Vance's novels have been described as sci-fantasy. They do not hinge on tech spec or scientific extrapolation but instead paint vivid pictures of the different cultures created by a human diaspora spread across a galactic expanse. They could as easily have been written as straight fantasy. So why does Vance choose to set his tales in an SF idiom? I do not think it is because he wanted to tap into the SF market, or that it is a mere case of window-dressing. I think it boils down to the difference between SF and fantasy. Fantasy worlds are entertaining, amazing and often illuminating. But they are only fantasy. By placing his tales in an SF milieu, Vance signals not that he wants them to seem as plausible (or not) as Asimov's Foundation or Banks' Culture, but that he believes that these are stories that relate directly to us. His worlds may never come to be, but he wants us to know that the messages he conveys are as relevant as anything SF at its best has to offer. He is talking to those of us who look ahead and try to discern the shape of things to come, not to those who wish to retreat to some idyllic fantasy land. In this sense, one of his closest peers is probably Ursula Le Guin. By the way, he writes beautifully, too.

 There really is a significant amount of apathy in my outlook. I can't really be bothered ranting about the degradation of the media, the death of rock, the loss of harmony and all that bad shit. Guess what? It's all real and I have to live on anyhow. I am definitely not disengaged from the things I have to do. But I am increasingly uninterested in people and in dialogue. In most cases, it really doesn't matter. I'm usually willing to listen and learn, but when it's one-sided 9 times out of 10 it might be more worthwhile to just stick to nurturng my own subjectivity. There are things I care about, things that worry me and things that make me happy. But I really don't see them as being earth-shattering enough to want to engage in endless dialectic about them. So why do I maintain this journal? So why am I supposed to be consistent? That's the only point there is really. Without assuming any particualr significance to any of it, I still do have enough of a sense of my own self to want to chronicle some of the things that float through my life. If nothing else, it helps me reflect on matters without expecting any conclusion (people are excessively hung up on conclusions, I think) and it also serves as a rather useful archive of things that have interested me. Narcissism, in other words. That's really all there is to it. Spare me the drivellings of further profundity.

 A collab with the Khandige: In dark afternoons of virtual boredom he crawls Scourge of the innocent and the young Through hallowed halls traces his snotty scrawls Before him all logic and wisdom falls With cribbed visuals and crabbed quotes he slays These might well be his golden days The poor lad, his fate unsung For every silly riposte another enemy born In this hedge of blooms he lurks, a thorn Waiting watching, his prey can be anyone With a quick quip and a barbed post he has them on the run Some might say his way of life is unusual But to us he is simply a little bit special As virtual boredom transforms into cyber mayhem Standing tall on the anarchy that he has birthed He trolls the punters for all he's worth

 I posted a small adulatory message about Veniss Underground on Jeff VanderMeer's message baord, and he was kind enough to respond like so: Thanks! I'm glad you liked it. I had fun with that third part because I wanted to make it a kind of can't-put-it-down joy ride. Because City of Saints generally has a slower pace, some people don't realize I can write that kind of stuff. JeffV I would say he proved his point! That third part is a real edge-of-your-seat ride, although I'm not sure I would use the word 'joy' in this context...

 urlLink She hates music. I'm beginning to sympathise...

 You know what, I've decided this whole humour thing is beyond me. Apparently being obnoxious, moronic and depraved is quite the funniest thing in life. Anyone who gets a little tired of it all is obviously far too stuffy and serious and has their head stuffed up their rear end. Fine. I just get really tired of laughing at people all the time, y'know? There has to be some other way to get a laugh.

 I've been hearing all sorts of good things about Jeff VanderMeer's Veniss Underground, and now that I've read it I can tell you they're all true. Perhaps the nicest thing about the book is it's brevity, for a book that broadly falls into the fantasy genre. At just about 200 pages, it's an elegant, economically written tale that sparkles with ideas, images and yes, even, erudition. There are various literary and mythical references, but it doesn't really hurt if you miss a lot of them. The story is strong enough on it's own. The core story is that most hackneyed of genre devices - the quest. It traces one Shadrach's descent into the underworld to rescue his beloved, and then (literally) into the belly of the beast to avenge the wrongs that were visited upon her. That's as far as the cliché goes, though. The setting, to begin with, is not some mediaevalist middle earth analog - it's a grim, intricately nightmarish far-future. The dark underworld is populated with ghastly creatures - all of which are the creations of Quin, an insane, brilliant genetic artist. Shadrach's beloved, Nicola, no longer returns his love. Quin himself is not unambiguously evil - he is cruel, sadistic and supremely twisted in a manner that Salvador Dali would have applauded, but it is hard to tell if his basic motivation - to replace the human race with something new - can be described as intrinsically evil. The story is superbly constructed - it is divided into three sections, each longer than the previous one. First, we hear from Nicholas, second-rate struggling artist and Nicola's twin, in the first-person. Then we meet Nicola herself, in an unusual and unusually succesful second-person narrative. Finally, Shadrach, yes, the third person and in third-person. It may all seem very clever-clever, but it in fact works quite seamlessly. The book is quite nerve- wracking at times - certain scenes are not for the weak of stomach - and yet, capable of oddly whimsical invention at others. There are scenes of utter horror and moments of total brutality (Shadrach discovers that Nicola has been captured by Quin when he visits an elderly client of Quin who is wearing Nicola's transplanted eye and hand). And yet, the prose is so smooth and compelling, you have to read it all. In fact, this was the first book in a long time that I stayed up all night to finish. It was also my biggest lit-kick since Eco's Baudolino. Go get it and read it.

 Well, I finished the Ramsey Campbell book. The ending was a fairly standard 'the horror still lurks' sort of affair, which I found a bit disappointing. The book itself was rather well written in a very restrained, straight forward manner. After wading through all that King and Koontz in earlier years, it was nice to read some brit horror for a change, though I'll have to read some more Campbell to really form an opinion on him. It does seem worth it though, especially since his books are available second-hand at Blossoms', so it's cheap at that. I've been going a bit slow on the Ian MacLeod, counting on the more easy-reading Gregorian and the much awaited Asimov memoirs to tide me through the week. Tomorrow is Christmas, and I intend to get back to MacLeod then as I sense it is a book that deserves (and will probably demand) long hours of dedicated attention. I've been listening to some music too, not new but new to me, thanks to the Prem and the Khandige. More on that later.

 Books. Where would I be without them? Probably just staring at FTV, fondling my gonads and stuffing my face with snacks all evening, every evening. I'm sure it's my bookwormishness that has prevented me from becoming an alcoholic, a drug addict or a particularly social animal. I'd just rather finish the book I'm reading, thank you very much. So what am I reading? Right now: Ramsey Campbell: To Wake The Dead. Horror. A slow build-up, but oddly compelling reading. Lots of erudite back-story thrown in with all the usual occult freaks popping up in various references, Crowley, Mathers and of course the grim, grasping ghoul himself, the one-balled Fuehrer and his bizarre superstitions. My first horror read in a while. Perhaps I shall try some more Campbell after this. They're pretty cheap, second-hand. Joyce Ballou Gregorian - Castledown. Fantasy. I read and enjoyed the first volume, The Broken Citadel, nearly 4 years back so it's nice to read the continuation. The book was written in the 70s and more or less free of the post-Eddings Tolkien-pastiche that has infested much contemporary fantasy, although the story does use the rather common trope of a person from 'our' world being transported to a fantastic other world. It also has a lot of names of various important figures that I can never remember properly or associate with the right person unless the title is mentioned, a problem I have with a lot of fantasy. Still, a rather good read, though nothing exceptionally breath-taking. I.Asimov - A Memoir - A volume of autobiographical essays by the good Doctor. A sort of summing-up at the end of a long life. Smooth reading, illuminating and moving in turns. Ian R MacLeod - The Light Years - I've just started on this. So far, the writing is quite brilliant. I recently finished The Phoenix Exultant by John C Wright. It did not thrill me as much as its predecessor, The Golden Age. Over a larger canvas, the limitations of Wright's writing and his vision are becoming rather too obvious. The dialogue, in particular, between Phaethon and Daphne is quite cringeworthy at times. Nevertheless, Wright is still a new SF writer to look out for, if not quite the new master I'd expected on the strength of his first book.

 So. I'm stumbling through everything I have to do. Work is just a shade short of hectic and rather unengaging at that. It seems that a larger than normal percentage of my working life is getting tied up in bullshit corpoRAT manueverings. Perhaps that's the way it plays out as you get on in a profession. It's just that there is an overdose of the software industry ethos in the place where I work - a system where everything has to be documented and follow a project timeline. I'm sure that works beautifully for the code geeks. It doesn't work for me. All I need is a brief I can build from and a deadline I can miss. Everything else is superfluous. I'm also disturbed about certain other things at the work front, but nevermind. There's only so much job related whining I can engage in without beginning to feel apathetic towards myself. It's only a job. It's only a lifetime.

 OK, the new year is upon us and so on. Despite vicious rumours to the contrary, I am still quite a young man and naturally made use of the seasonal spirit to engage in a fair amount of fun and drunkenness. On Christmas Eve, I met up with my friend Prem for a few beers at Pecos. After a couple of rounds the urge to do a pub crawl came over me. I popped the question, Prem agreed and so it's heigh ho away we go... We headed down to Guzzler's Inn next. We'd met up there a year back and had a lot of fun parodying Lars Ulrich's facial expressions when the DJ played Nothing Else Matters. In typical I'm-stuck-in-musical-timewarp-this-must-be-Bangalore style, they played that very same song again. We ran through a mug each then headed out to hit the next pub. In the bike parking outside we came across a drunken woman verbally abusing some possibly innocent bystander. Her voice was loud and very clear and her discourse was peppered with every expletive she knew. She just wouldn't stop. Eventually, the guy lost it and apparently struck her. She lunged back and knocked over a few bikes. Prem and me retreated before any further ugliness could ensue. We went to Alibi next. It was pretty empty as usual as we perched at the counter and ordered our drinks. We sat through some rather desultory 80s corp-rock (including KISS' 'I was made for loving you' which had Prem visibly squirming) and decided to get out once the first round was over. Next, we hit Styx. The music here was far more to my taste - they stayed away from the nu stuff thankfully and basically played it safe - Megadeth, Sepultura and that sort of thing, but I like that shit, so no complaints. The evening ended in Johnson Market, with sheek kabab rolls and sudden intervention by Askhay and Amit (who was mentally in Delhi, though). Saturday night was again fun. I went over to the Totiman's place and we ran through a huge assortment of music (Dead Soul Tribe, Katatonia, Scott Weiland, Sonic Youth, The Pixies, Bauhaus, Jane's Addiction, Kenny Wayne Shephard and Iron Maiden) three quarters of vodka and two and a half Hitchcock movies (39 Steps - very good and Secret Agent - put us to sleep). Aite. This is where I should proceed to relate the goings on at the big Khandige New Year Bash, but I don't really feel like it right now. All I'll say is, it was good fun, good friends, good music and the Totiman obliged by providing the mandatory episode of drunken brutality.

 Well, another year trundles to a halt. It's been a rather good year for me in many ways - I'm employed again, for one thing. I've read a lot of good new books, discovered some good music and made a few new friends, too. I'd like to wax thoughtful here, but you know how it goes. New days, new ways and so forth. it's only a life, but that's really all it needs to be. Cheers.

 An "official" Lost Book is one that is out of print and forgotten or back in print and forgotten. It can be a book written for young adults that is relatively unknown in mainstream speculative fiction (Diana Wynn Jones vs. R. K. Rowling). A lost book could be one that was overlooked by the Hugo and Nebula ballots. Or it could be a main stream speculative fiction publication that was ignored by the general readership. In other words, it has been marginalized in some way. Interested? Check the site out: http://www.lostbooks.org/

 This morning, I finished William Gibson's All Tomorrow's Parties. The story opens a little confusingly, with the first 50 pages or so given over to introducing a bewildering variety of new characters, some of whom are familiar from his previous book, Idoru. It's only at around the halfway point, when the Idoru herself, Rei Toei, appears, that the story really seems to get into gear. It's basically a sort of millenial tale - info-surfer Colin Laney has a talent for finding patterns in raw data, and sensing centres of change, or 'nodal points'. He feels that a huge nodal point is about to be reached, the biggest since one back in 1911, which apparently is the last time 'everything changed'. The story is excellently written and once it gets under way, hurtles towards a climax in typical Gibson style. However, too much is saved for last-minute revelations, and Gibson falters and pulls off a rather flat ending. There's an interesting core plot about the future of nanotech, but it's buried too deep and exposed a little too late to really hit home. Pity, because the book could have been much stronger with a bit of revision. Still, I suppose when you're a 'paradigm busting' author like Gibson, editors don't really call for re-writes. Idoru was a lot better, with it's unlikely but endearing heroine - not the Idoru, but a little girl from Seattle who flies all the way to Tokyo and takes part in all sorts of major events and then goes back home with no one seeming to have noticed! Major plus points for slipping in a Nick Cave quotation, though - see if you can spot it, if you have the book!

 1. He wrote long, rhyming poems in a sloping hand on sheets of blue airmail paper. Each 14-syllable line was perfectly measured, alliterative and also part of a complex rhyming scheme. He would sketch the premise out in the first few lines and then deploy it across a variety of similes and metaphors until he felt it was time to stop. At the foot of each poem, he would scrawl his intricate, curlicued signature with its imbedded caricature of a baby vulture. 2. She only wrote poems occasionally. She would sit listening to 1970s prog rock, framing short quatrains in her head, testing the way they fit the shape of her emotions. She could sing, better than she wrote, and play a little guitar. When she wrote down her poems in her spiral-bound notebook, she would jot down chord names above the lines like asterisks. The footnotes were the songs she never sang. 3. His poems were scribbled in short, sturdy lines across the pages of an old diary. 4 or 5 syllables to a line. Short and modest, his poems were just short of trite, his emotions interesting only in their intensity. Taken as a whole, his poems revealed a secret misanthropy that his outgoing, gregarious behaviour archly hinted at. He gave each of his poems a title, something pithy and aphoristic. Read in sequence, the titles formed a meta-poem of terrible grace and power. 4. He never really wrote what he would call poems. As a matter of fact, he never wrote them down at all. He carried these little collections of lines around in his head and occasionally confided them to friends. Each of these pieces was a perfect miniature, capturing a world of feeling in three or four cleverly formed, lovingly polished lines. Every time I heard them, I tried to sit and write my own poetry. My tired, overwrought phrases always paled in comparison. He was the best poet you’ll never read.

 I've pretty much decided that I probably shouldn't try and write science fiction, since I read so much of it. It's the old ashtray thing. So what should I write? I've always been fairly OK at these little vignettes, these word-portraits of a moment in time or an aspect of a personality. But vignettes do not form a story. However, I can write stories. I rarely show them to anyone, but when I have they seem to be accepted as valid stories (irrespective of merit). So what should I write stories about? The problem is, there are too many options. Too much stuff. Clinging toa genre was actually a sense of safety. But now what? Oh, boy...

 Oh well. Life goes on. Things are progressing at an even keel, aided by my pay hike. I also seem to be having a bit of fun, unusually so for me. Friday I met up with Shree, Jack and DT for a fairly epic driking bout that ended back in my place with full music and all. Saturday was a repeat with Shree and Jack again and also GK, Sam and Toto. I would like to say more but perhaps another time.

 I might as well put this up here. A little essaylet on Jack Vance. I've only read three of his books so far - Emphyrio, Night Lamp and Lyonesse: Suldrun's Garden, but his beautiful prose style and unique world-building already has me hooked. Style is the first thing that strikes you about Vance - he has a graceful, almost Victorian way of writing, complete with exquisitely balanced sentences, aptly used words and rich, compelling description. In fact, I'd suggest you avoid reading any Vance if you are currently engaged in a writing project - the rhythms of his prose have this very insidious quality! The next thing that sets Vance apart is his world-building. His worlds are not the complex politico-ecological creations of a Frank Herbert, nor are they based on extensive social or tech extrapolations. Instead, he creates worlds that express ideas, states of mind and philosophical conceits, much like the fantastic metropolises in Italo Calvino's Imagnary Cities. Vance then goes on to set leisurely, gracious tales in these worlds. His plots seem to be fairly straightforward, as far as theme goes - more often than not, the story revolves around an individualistic protagonist, something of an outsider, who embarks on a journey of discovery and transformation. His works are both in the fantasy and sf genres, but there is really little difference between the two, except by way of stage-dressing. His SF is best described as galactic fairy-tales. His books are rather leisurely, as I've said, but if you have the time for them, they can provide you with a truly pleasurable read.

 It's been a while. I'm having second thoughts on my decision in my previous entry. I think I'll just write and let the stories sort themselves out. Right now I'm tentaively working on new story which may turn out to be a sort of galactic gnostic fable, odd for a non-believer like me, but what the hell, right? I'm reading a fair amount of fantasy right now, after quite a while. I finished Weiss and Perrin's Dragon Wing after a break, and that has set me right back in the fantasy mood. Fortunately I have some excellent fantasy books by Vance, Erikson and Moorcock at hand, so the reading goes along quite pleasurably. I also need to re-read Dune now, which should be fun. The last few weeks have been a bit wild with the whole party spirit prolonging itself and I need to slow down a bit. Time for some quiet contemplation. I hope.

 It's been a while, yet again. Honestly, there has not been that much to tell. Work goes on fairly normally - although I need to get a little more into work-head than I have been lately. Been reading a lot of course - some of the authors I've tripped on lately are Michael Moorcock, Jack Vance, AE van Vogt and John Banville. Right now I'm reading a rather cool book of mildy chilling tales by Marathi author Vilas Sarang, called 'Fair tree of the void'. Not much music happening, but on the weekends Itend to go friends' places and listen to new stuff. New to me, that is. Oh wait, wait. My mother and her husband have finally moved back into Bangalore. Yea. That's some major (and happy) news. Still, I don't seem very locked in to writing about my life right now, so we'll have to see where this leaves the blog. Later, then.

 I have news. Many moons ago, I joined an online SF discussion forum. Although there were a few literary sf fans on board, the place was more generously populated with movie/tv crowd and fat fantasy followers. However, I did meet a couple of people who were into the written stuff, especially the older stuff. And then, the foremost of these, a Southern Gentleman from the US, whom I shall call Mighty Kveldulf, was banned from the board for playing logic games with the whole notion of Political Correctness. However, he did drop me a mail and we stayed in touch, shooting the breeze by mail or on other forums. Well, at some point down the line, Mighty Kveldulf ran into a group of amateur film makers from the UK called urlLink Superteam and became involved with their activities, contributing inputs on backgrounds, props and so on. After a bunch of Stargate fan films and couple of smaller-scale films (including a D&D film), Superteam decided it was time to figure out what to work on this year. Mighty Kveldulf suggested a cinematic adaptation of Ambrose Bierce's classic horror tale, urlLink 'The Damned Thing. To see if it could be done, they needed to have a look at a possible script. For some reason, Mighty Kveldulf was under the impression that I could help out, and asked me to weigh in with a script. Always ready for a new writing challenge, I got to work. However, it strick me that my old booze and blues buddy, Jack might be able to help me flesh out the scenes, insane movie buff that he is. Jack and I went over the story - an excellent, creepy tale shot through with just the right hint of gallows humour - and realised that we'd have to add a few things. Specifically, a frame for the diary entries that make up the climax of the tale, and an opening scene in a shady bar because opening scenes in shady bars are just so damn cool. Having figured out our treatment, we got to work. Or ratherm Jack got to work. With a modicum of interference from my end, he transformed our ideas and the original tale into a script that we fondly imagine is a worthy adaptation of Mister Bierce's brilliant story. Then, I sent the script to Mighty Kveldulf and Ian of Superteam. This was an epic undertaking in itself - various oddities of cyberspace ensured that the word document did not reach its intended recipients in a usable form. FInally, I turned to my colleague, The Infragable Ashoka and begged him to turn the damned thing into pdf. He graciously complied, and the resulting pdf succesfuly reached Kveldulf and Ian (who seems to have read it in the tub - good we didn't drown him!) The upshot of all this is that Superteam are very interested in seeing this project through - with a story as strong as this, quite a movie can be made. The script isn't too bad either! Of course, there a few things to be worked out. We believe that the story is public domain, but need to be sure. I've asked a friend in the book business if he can figure this out for me. And of course there all sorts of logistics and so forth to be planned out...but it's cool that we've even got so far! Watch this space for more details. Really.

 That must be me. I cannot participate in the sorrowful vigils, the touching tributes and so forth being offered to my friend who passed on earlier this week. I feel the loss, and I feel both angry and sad that such a promising life ended so early and - and so stupidly - but I have to move on, you know? Like the old asassin said, (though he phrased it better of course) not all my tears will unwrite a single word of what has already been written in the book of life. I know that I don't want people moping around when I am gone. It'd be nice if a few of them remember me now and then, but please, just get on with your lives. All of which makes me wonder - am I actually rather unfeeling because I do not show my feelings - or indeed allow them to dominate my mind beyond what I think is an appropriate, healthy measure of time? Someone recently accused me of living like a man in a bubble. Maybe that's true. Maybe it's safer and healthier in a bubble.

 A few weeks back, I was fortunate enough to locate a second-hand copy of Cordwainer Smith's only full-length SF novel, Norstrilia. Smith (the SF pen name of US foreign policy adviser Paul Linebarger) was one of the most unusual writers to ever grace the genre. In my opinion, he belongs to the ranks of SF's most creative literary and conceptual trail-blazers, like Alfred Bester and Theodore Sturgeon. His entire opus consists of a few dozen short stories and this novel, all of which are conceptually linked within an over-arcing future history of mankind. A future history is nothing unique in SF - Robert Heinlein did it right in the thick of Campbell's Golden Age, and many other authors, including James Blish and Larry Niven have weighed in with their own future histories. However, Smith's future history is conceptually the opposite of these, even though it shares the same sweeping expanse and sense of extraploation. Rather than chronicling our outward journey to the stars, Smith examines a far-future human race attempting to rediscover its own humanity. Smith's style is again unique in SF, and elsewhere. He grew up in China, and his knowledge of Chinese writing found expression in a number of unique literary devices, such as the masterfully ironic preface to Norstrilia that outlines the plot - and then adds that the details follow. So what is Norstrilia about? To give you a complete background, I'd have to summarise nearly all his short stories first. Suffice it to say that Rod McBan has just inherited the biggest landholding in the planet called Norstrilia - Old North Australia - where ten-ton sheep secrete an immortality drug, called stroon. In a world of telepaths, McBan's own mental powers are wildly erratic and largely dormant. Hounded by powerful enemies, he turns to an old family computer for a way out. And what a way out it is! In one crowded night, McBan, aided by the computer, performs a series of financial maneuvers that make him the richest boy in the universe, and the owner of Manhome, Old Old Earth itself. He now flees to Earth where he finds various forces working to either preserve or exploit him. Anyone who has read the short stories will have a chance to revisit several old friends here, including C'mell the beautiful cat-derived girly-girl. The story of how McBan escapes his foes and returns to a safe, prosperous life on his home world encompasses a wealth of fascinating details that play on some very large topics, including the ultimate fate and nature of humanity. Those details are why you should hunt this book down and read it for yourself - there's the sheer inventiveness - at least one whole new idea each page - the marvellously original and idiosyncratic prose style and, most of all, the memorable characters. There are few SF novels that bear such a weight of literary and conceptual excellence - and are still such fun to read. Unavailable for long periods of time, the book is now available in its entirety in at least two current editions I know of - one from Gollancz and the other from the NESFA press.

 The Spitzer Space Telescope (formerly SIRTF, the Space Infrared Telescope Facility) was launched into space by a Delta rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida on 25 August 2003. During its 2.5-year mission, Spitzer will obtain images and spectra by detecting the infrared energy, or heat, radiated by objects in space between wavelengths of 3 and 180 microns (1 micron is one-millionth of a meter). Most of this infrared radiation is blocked by the Earth's atmosphere and cannot be observed from the ground. It's already sending in exciting new data that's making headlines in the space-related news services I subscribe to. Among other things, the data collected by Sptizer will be used to help understand how galaxies, stars and planets are formed. Here's the official link: urlLink Spitzer Space Telescope

 Finally got this working, only from this post on though. So now you can talk back, again.

 Well, the last half year or so has been quite an interesting time for me, as far as reading goes. I started out quite burned out and contemptuous of the whole epic fantasy scenario, and quite an SF hardliner. Over the months, I've had to moderate this opnion, having read several rather good works in this genre thanks to recommendation from online acquaintances. It's interesting how much the world of forums has made a diifference to my bookwormly ways. I know very few people in real life who read much of either science fiction or fantasy, but online I've found communities with equally dedicated fans of these genres, from all over the world. I've had the chance to trade opnions with readers from UK, the US, Australia, various Scandinavian countries, Australia, and closer home as well - the Phillipines for one, and even Pakistan. Fancy that. Of course finding a suitable forum that largely gels with my own intersts, or at least the level at which I like to discuss them does take some trial and error, and I've found that a combination of several forums works best for me. I go to at least three broad-based sf/f forums, which have differing emphases between the two genres, and in some cases, a secondary focus on horror as well. Whether they have huge memberships in the 1000s with at least a few hundred active posters or a tight citcle of about a dozen memebers, I've fixed on these communities because they do seem to have members who have funny habit of introducing me to authors I have not heard of, or considered, before. I also go to one sf-only forum which is regularly frequented by only 4 of us, but all 4 are dedicated (obsessed) SF bibliophiles and the level of discussion there is most insightful and informative. There are a few other forums that I visit only occasionally - either forums centered around a particular author, that I visit when a new book is out, and more general forums that are largely overrun by the franchise-fiction and tv/film fans, but can throw up an intersting post or two at times. That's a lot of reading - and writing - but it has actually opened doors to new books for me. It's also garnered me a set of online friends, that I shall probably never meet face to face, but have a real sense of connection with. It's heartening to note that I also have an equal or larger number of real life friends, but I do value these faceless contacts through the net - sometimes th ewords we share can be as good as any other form of interaction. Naturally there have been less positive moments. I have never been trolled on a forum where no one personally knows me (odd, huh) but there have been topics and opinions that have pained or offended me, particualrly the ones that relate to real-life politics or events. I have learned to take these in my stride - online, all you have to do if you don't like what's being said is to close the window. I've also found that, sitting here in India, I am often as up to date or more so on certain things than people in the West. A number of people I know in the US, for instance, are only just starting out on certain books that reached me much earlier, as India recieves British editions of most books. Erm...so what is all this leading up to? Not much really. Just rambling a bit on the online forum experience. Do you need a conclusion? OK - tread carefully, and remember to leave time for real life, too.

 Incidentally, I never did mention what I finally thought of House of Chains by Steven Erikson , so here's my post-analysis as posted on the various forums I frequent (spoiler warnings apply) : I've just finished Erikson's House of Chains. It was quite a read, not the very strongest in the series so far, but particularly notable for its depiction of Karsa Orlong, and the amazing transformations he goes through. This character starts out as a rather despicable barbarian raider, and through a series of amazing reverses and experiences transforms into something much bigger. It is hard to ever really like him, but by the end I felt a certain awed respect in his eventual path. Other elements of the story followed the more usual course of these books with the Malazan Empire besting yet another adversary. This time however, there was no grand moment of victory for the Malazans but a sense of compassion for the defeated, especially the former Malazan lass who became the leader of the rebellion. Like the other books in the series, it's loaded with sub-plots and mystification, which is an Erikson trademark. The book delivers a satisfactory resolution as a stand-alone, although I doubt you'd really want to read it without following th erest of the series through. Erikson's handling of romance continues to be his weak point, with the relationship between Lostara and Pearl merely annoying me. A worthy contribution to this series. I've been on an Erikson marathon for a while now, and I won't deny that I am quite glad to take a break but I do look forward to that mmpb of Midnight Tides hitting these shores sometime soon.

 Well the paycheck just hit home, so I've picked up some new books. These include: Michael Moorcock's Multiverse A comic series from DC/Bertigo. Written by Moorcock himself, art by three awesome comics talents: Walter Simonson, Mark Reeve and John Ridgway. A complex and fascinating story, might be a bit confusing for Moorcock newbies. Jack Vance - Tales of the Dying Earth The Fantasy Masterworks edition, includes The Dying Earth, The Eyes of the Overworld, Cugel's Saga and Rialto the Magnificent. These works seem to be quite central in Vance's opus (and discussions thereof) so I'm glad to have them at last. Felipe Fernandez-Armesto - Civilizations A book that suggests that a far more relativistic definition of civilization is required since most existing definitions are sadly biased by the historians' own background. The not-too clearly elaborated premise is that civilisations can be rated or evaluated on the basis of ther erelationship with their environment. Most of the book consists of comparative studies of different civlizations in similar environment, which in itself is thought-provoking and informative enough to be worth the price of admission, although I am not yet certain exactly what the central premise is, practically, beyond what I've already mentioned.Less than halfway through though, so it may become clearer. Martin Rees - Our Cosmic Habitat Looks to be a good book on cosmology. Havent yet started on this one. Now check this out: urlLink Real Black Holes Discovered By Virtual Astronomical Observatory

 Oh well. Another weekend gone by. A rather quiet weekend, wherein I slept a lot, watched a lot of tv and read a bit too. I finally got to watch a couple of episodes of Lois and Clark (it hasn't aired in this part of world before - 10 years seems to be a fairly standard lead-time for such things) and I must say it was quite entertaining, with more than a little of the flavour of the early Superman newspaper strips. I shall have to watch a few more episodes to really judge though - there is equal potential for it to get more interesting or just turn annoying. Terri Hatcher certainly bears watching, and I find the emphasis on Kent rather than Superman interesting. I'm progressing towards the conclusion of House of Chains by Steven Erikson and must confess that it is not quite as compelling as Deadhouse Gates or Memories of Ice . There's a distinct sense that some things will only make sense on a re-read, and at times the interspersion of descriptive passages seems most untimely. Still a solid read though, and I do hope Midnight Tides picks up the slack. I've also started out on Downtime by Cynthia Felice , an SF novel published in 1985. A fairly interesting story so far, with a lot of potential to evolve into a complex and gripping yarn of intrigue, mystery, war and even romance, oddly enough. The 80s have been a decade I've largely by-passed in my previous SF reading, and in the interests of developing an encyclopaedic knowledge of the genre I've taken to buying and reading everything mildly interesting I find that isn't franchise fiction, but there is usually some reward in most of what I find and this looks to be no exception.

 Sometimes I utterly fail to understand the popularity of a particular book. I can more or less figure out why people enjoy something like the DragonLance novels, or the Gor books, but I must say I am perplexed at the number of SF fans who swear by Larry Niven's Ringworld books. The first volume, Ringworld, was enjoyable enough, even if Niven failed to create a really coherent plot, or even to fully exploit the sheer visual wonder and sense of place that a contruct like the Ringworld is capable of evoking (take a loof at Arthur C Clarke's Rendezvous With Rama and compare to see what I mean). The whole sub-plot with Teela Brown and the Puppeteers' program of breeding humanity for the 'luck gene' is a perfect example of what was wrong with the book - more or less arbitrary tangents that seem to serve very little purpose, except to serve as more or less obvious plot devices. Still, the book was fuelled by a very cool hard SF concept, and had a certain racy wit to it. Some say the aliens were well depicted, and I will concede that they were at least more grown-up than the human characters. My verdict? A mildy entertaining SF adventure, but not even as entertaining as, say, Grant Callin's A Lion on Tharthee or Jeffrey Carver's Panglor, to name two hard SF novels that no one has ever called 'a classic of SF'. Now we come to the sequel. It seems to have been written purely as a response to the numerous readers who took great delight in picking at the structural gaps in the Ringworld. Perhaps they should have spent more time remarking at the structural gaps in the novel. Everything about this novel smacks of sophomore slump, series-wise. The plot is even more meandering and contingent, with the characters engaging in dull technical discussions and coming to rather unwarranted conclusions. I am no engineer or physicist, but I am at least clever enough to follow a logical argument, and I have to say that most of the big conclusions Louis Wu and Chmeee arrive at seem utterly unjustified by the discussions that preceded them. The most annoying aspect of the book is the contant insertion of rishatra - a custom wherein members of species that cannot breed with each other engage in sex to seal agreements or release tension. Something just occured to me. Rishatra is the key to what this novel really is. Ringworld Engineers was written by Niven to shut up those MIT students who marched the halls of SF conventions chanting 'the ringworld is unstable', by deluging them with enough garbled techspeak to keep them crunching numbers for another decade, and enough (non-explicit) sex to ensure that they would be too distracted to ever do so. Yes, Niven's sequel was a fitting reply to the only critics who bothered about the original enough to respond. But for those of us who are not virginal MIT students - nah, skip it. Personally, I gave up on the book some 50 pages before the end and have no intention of following up on the series (which has just recieved its 4th installment, Ringworld's Children). So have I really understood why so many people loved this book? Not really, I've just facetiously dismissed them with a string of stereotypes. But they're my stereotypes and I stand by them!

 His name was Gribbl. He was the foremost elf-killer in all the 3 and somethingeth realms of Pie. Each morning he woke up hungover and unwashed in his treetop nest, fell down to the ground with a great rumbling thud and let loose an impressive stream of invective. I shall gloss over the rest of his morning amenities as they are too sordid for words. Suffice it to say that, once he had breakfasted and attended to his other basic needs (and very basic they were, at that), Gribbl would set forth, cudgel in hairy right hand, troll-skin loincloth wrapped against wart-infested midriff, dwarf-cranium helm affixed onto the top of his pointy head and hobbit-sole mocassins jammed onto his splay-toed feet, a song on his lips and a spring in his step, to slay elves. The song, by the way, went something like this: I'm off to slay some elves Coz they won't slay themselves The poncy little queers I'm the one they fears I'm off to slay some elves I'm off to slay some elves The tune is rather hard to describe, but employs several discordant intervals and is an example of the highly sophisticated post-modern compositional skills many rough woodsmen of Pie exemplify. The elves were the last of the non-human races forced upon humble Pie by the Elder God Drear, in an aeon long past. The dragons were the first to go, slain by the Knights, who in turn were dispatched by the numerous trolls, ogres and other sub-human creatures of thick skin and bestial ferocity created by Drear and his Dreary Spawn. By this time, the woodsmen had detected a healthy trend in what was going on. 'Bump off the dreary races, and we can get on with baking our own Pie our own way,' they figured with the succinct, direct thought patterns of their pragmatic ilk. So they hurtled into the fray, sending Skeptic Commandos to wipe out the dryads, fairies and nymphs, Septic Commandos to practise germ warfare against the bestial beasties, rough cavalry against the unicorns, circus strongmen to capture the various chimerae and mythis creatures and inter them in small colorful cages for the rest of their days, and so on. The Anti-Drear wars were mightily succesful, and at the conclusion of three months of pitched battle, only one race was left standing - the Elves. No one had ever figured those simpering nancies for a real threat, but the woodsmen decided to pick them off on general principle. It proved to be harder than they had anticipated, simply because of the sheer cowardice of the elves, who ran up tall trees, down deep burrows, plunged into rushing rivers or simply merged with their surroundings when threatened. This was not going to be war, then, but hunting by stealth. And oddly, few were stealthier than Gribbl. Some whispered that he was a pederaast, and picked up his guile stalking pre-pubescent schoolgirls. Other suggested that he had more than a drop of elfish blood himself. Most said 'let the lad go kill those elves.' And so he did. All good things must come to an end, but fortunately, so did the elves. In later days, Gribbl fondly recalled his last elf-kill. 'A gnarled old patriarch-elf it was, almost manly in his advanced years. He was too old to run and too fat to blend, so he turned on me with tooth and claw - yes, those elves had claws, and don't let all those stupid tales of long, slender fingers fool you - and fought almost as well as a woodsman. Almost. He died hard, he died well. But he died. And then he went into to my mid-day stew.' And so the last of the Drear Races passed, unmourned, from Pie. What next for this wondrous land, you might ask, what lies ahead now that the painful critters of a thousand palsied imaginations have been eradicated for all time? 'Well,' Gribbl mumbles, We won't be leaving on a quest anytime soon, I can tell you that...' My friend George has made a small . urlLink flash film showing Gribbl in later days, graduated to cave-dwelling and waving triumphant fist. Check it out!

 As revealed by one of the erudite posters at the RSJonline forums: Metal Music was created during World War II. `Twas created by the rebelious nature of teens... MEtal Music is a symbol for anger, voilence.... but there is a sub-genre of metal which stands out of these its know as Melodic Metal which unlike other types of metal is much more soothing.. Metal also shows da fight against Gods n stuff like that.. So now you know. And knowing is half the battle...

 You can never be too careful with words. Sometime back, I described Michelangelo's paintings in the Sistine Chapel as murals. I was recently corrected - they are, in fact, frescoes. I'd mentally classified both terms as synonyms meaning 'painting on a wall'. In fact, a fresco is specifically a painting made on wet plaster, while a mural is any large painting or photograph applied directly to a wall or ceiling. I could beg off and say that it is the English language's own fault for having so many words in it that mean nearly the same, but I shall instead take this as a stern admonition to Be More Careful.

 In which your humble pal JP waxes profound on Richard Matheson's vampire classic, I Am Legend. If Matheson's The Shrinking Man put some in mind of Kafka's Metamorphosis, this book reminded me most of Albert Camus' The Outsider. In both, the protagonist pays the ultimate price for being different from the dominant society around him. I'll venture a bit further to say that Neville's experiences in the book are analogous to those of everyone who attempts to follow a path away from the mainstream. I've spent many restless evenings with the windows boarded up and the music up loud to drown out the endless cries and entreaties to 'come out, Neville'. Of course, I do not mean to suggest that Matheson meant this book as an allegory for the plight of an outsider in society. But it does relate quite well. In today's increasinly consumeristic (vampiric?) and standardised society, indeed, in any society that has ceased to value originality and diversity, the non-conformist, whether by conviction or nature, cannot help but feel at times like 'anathema and black terror to be destroyed'. As a book I found it commendably economically written. The beginning is the hardest part, with its slow tracking through the minute details of another night in Neville's lonely citadel. The passages in which his memories of the death of his wife are explored are emotionally painful, as they should be. Neville's faltering quest to understand the vampire bacteria, his relapses into drunken despair, his alternating euphoria and frustration at possibly finding a dog who can be his companion in this terribly lonely state, all ring true in many ways and are depicted in a clear, non-superfluous prose that is a Matheson trademark, apparently. Also, in a literary world overrun by sensual, seductive vampires it was a blessed relief to see them shown as the creepy bloodsuckers they were meant to be, albeit with a scientific basis of some sort for their condition. But finally, I think the book's real message, for me at least, is that 'good and evil' are rarely anything more than a layering of social obfuscation over 'us and them'. By the end, it is 'them' who are the majority, and therefore 'good'. Sounds familiar, doesn't it?

 There's a sort of battle happening in this marginal world we fans of SF and fantasy live in. Strange as it may seem to you, even this little ashtray has its mainstream and its contrarians. I've noticed that one Gabriel Chouinard has been a rather vocal combatant in this battle for some time, most lately taking the fight to the trenches, as it were, to the forums on SFFWorld, something of a bastion of fantastic mainstream fandom (although the chaps in the SF section seem rather more broadminded and well-read). Well, that sort of thing is clearly an open invitation to a losing battle. He's stirred things up, and even found a few souls who agree with him (me, for one) but he's no closer to swaying the Masses than before. Which seems to have lead him, earlier today, to realise (re-realise?) that the battle between mainstream and whatever-else is not one that you fight in the trenches. Evenly matched powers like the Axis and Allies can do that.

 The best ideas do come in dreams. Yesterday, I tallied up the number of books I've read in the last week alone (3 completed, 2 in progress) and felt rather peeved with myself for not dedicating more time to my own writing. Then, I spent the day reading two very interesting books: 'Civilizations' by Felipe Fernandez-Armesto and What Does A Martian Look Like? - The Science of Extraterrestrial Life' by Jack Cohen and Ian Stewart. I suppose the Fernandez-Armesto book got me thinking about the different kinds of civilization that can arise and their relative merits, and the other book set my mind on the strange phenomena than can occur in deep space (I was reading about magnetotori - imaginary creatures, composed of magnetic fields, that could arise on the surface of stars and then evolve to range freely through space, one of many fictional beasties conjured up by Jack&Ian, as they style themselves, to illustrate how life could conceivably develop in non-Earthlike conditions). Somehow these themes came together in my dreams in the form of a story spark that involved a conception of the cosmos contantly unravelling at the peripheries, while new matter is constantly being generated at the cosmic core, a vision of a Utopian civilization devoid of religious fears and jealousies and the good old explore-and-settle space mission story frame. Specifically, I dreamed of one particular incident involving three people, woke up, almost instantly remembered or made up the rest and then feverishly scribbled it all down between 5.30 and 7.00 in the morning. The best part is that the story idea sill seems good to me, and the rough draft reads largely well. All I have to do now is type the damn thing out and start polishing. And of course, to remember to dream more often.

 *sob* I had a long post composed as a response to urlLink Joey's post on taboo in modern fiction, or rather the mysterious lack of it, but the internet just swallowed it up. Bad internet, bad internet.

 Re: the raging debates among us fantasy geeks alluded to earlier, Ursula le Guin recently made a speech at a publisher's convention or somesuch event that bears reading by anyone concerned with the genre at all. To quote a particularly pertinent passage: Fantasy is a literature particularly useful for embodying and examining the real difference between good and evil. In an America where our reality may seem degraded to posturing patriotism and self-righteous brutality, imaginative literature continues to question what heroism is, to examine the roots of power, and to offer moral alternatives. Imagination is the instrument of ethics. There are many metaphors beside battle, many choices besides war, and most ways of doing good do not, in fact, involve killing anybody. Fantasy is good at thinking about those other ways. Could we assume that it does so? Le Guin also adresses issues such as race in fantasy - something that has long troubled me, but that very few Western fantasy fans seem to include in their lists of wearied cliches. When a writer like Jordan inserts a few token races of colour, and gives different races/cultures amusing idiosyncracies barely on a level with the sterotypes of an ignorant racist (Domani wenches are all seductive Mata Haris, all Tairen commoners pepper their speech with piscene metaphors and so on), Westerners seem to percieve a diversity that I find it hard to see, myself. Of course, he at least makes the effort that the majority of genre writers do not seem to bother to. Naturally, a Western writer will tend to set her story in a setting that derives from their own setting in a way. But when that's all that nearly every writer in the still largely Western genre does, it does make one question the supposed fantasticality of it all. There are writers who really do seem to be adressing this though - Ricardo Pinto has set his Stone Dance of the Chameleon trilogy in a setting that is more Mayan than anything else I know of, while Erikson's Malazan Books of the Fallen span enitre continents - a far more honest way of depicting disparate cultures than Jordan's coy way of imagining they would all pop up in the tiny continent that forms the stage for his novels. At some level, this issue of race and setting needs to be taken on in earnest, if the fantasy genre is not to ultimately be little more than a collective wish-fulfillment for the western, white-skinned world. If that does not happen, the genre will be woefully irrelevant in the year 4010, when President Temujjin Li of the Larger Sino-Indian Republic takes office as the Most Powerful Man In The Free World... OK, enough of my mumbling. Over to Le Guin: urlLink Some Assumptions About Fantasy.

 We want to stand upon our own feet and look fair and square at the world -- its good facts, its bad facts, its beauties, and its ugliness; see the world as it is and be not afraid of it. Conquer the world by intelligence and not merely by being slavishly subdued by the terror that comes from it. The whole conception of God is a conception derived from the ancient Oriental despotisms. It is a conception quite unworthy of free men. When you hear people in church debasing themselves and saying that they are miserable sinners, and all the rest of it, it seems contemptible and not worthy of self-respecting human beings. We ought to stand up and look the world frankly in the face. We ought to make the best we can of the world, and if it is not so good as we wish, after all it will still be better than what these others have made of it in all these ages. A good world needs knowledge, kindliness, and courage; it does not need a regretful hankering after the past or a fettering of the free intelligence by the words uttered long ago by ignorant men. It needs a fearless outlook and a free intelligence. It needs hope for the future, not looking back all the time toward a past that is dead, which we trust will be far surpassed by the future that our intelligence can create. - Betrand Russell, 'Why I Am Not A Christian' I'm actually inclined to be a bit less vehement in professing my secular views, but skip the dismissal of religion if it hurts you for any reason, and I do believe that the rest of this passage (from 'We ought to stand up') is one of the most inspiring things I have ever read. I read a lot of the 'enlightened secularists' when I was quite young, mainly essays by Aldous Huxley, Bertrand Russell and Isaac Asimov and I suppose that they are as close to a spiritual belwether as I have. Thought I'd share a sample with my audience out there in cyberspace.

 Ah, let's see. What goes on? Well, I seem to be making myself social anathema in certain ashtrays, which, oddly, is something I can live with. Other than that? Oh, lots really. All in my head, of course. The Fernandez-Armesto book continues to be a fascinating, thought-provoking read. I picked up Greg Bear's Darwin's Children and it is great to see how he has grown as a writer. He is really venturing into Crichton-esque modern-day tech-thriller territory here, but with better science and better characters. I saw Troy on Saturday. It was an entertaining enough movie, with some visually spectacular moments. However, i think it rapidly slid downhill after Hector's death - somehow, the rest of the movie seemed to loose its narrative kick, relying on common knowledge to tell the story.

 A few days back, I found Jasper Fforde's entire bibliography bundled together for sale at Rs. 525 (equal to the orginal price of each individual book in UKP). I remembered reading good things about the books on Rick Kleffel's urlLink Agony Column , saw a quote by Pratchett on the cover and figured it was worth a gamble. A lot of my reading lately has been rather dark - so this is turning out to be a good break. It's a sort of mix of mystery, fantasy, sf and a very British humour (shades of Monty Python, Douglas Adams, and yes, Terry Pratchett). I can't comment on its ultimate literary value yet, but I'm midway through The Eyre Affair right now and I can say that it is dead funny, and hearteningly literate stuff as well. Which is only to be expected as it deals with one Thursday Next, literary detective. She is on the trail of a dastardly villian who kidnaps literary characters from their books. She lives in a sort of parallel 1985, where the Crimean War still rages, Britain is dominated by a multi-tentacled corporation called Goliath and popular culture is dominated by high literature and art, with gangs of surrealists and pre-Raphaelites skirmishing in the streets, children trading Henry Fielding cards, genetically recreated exctinct species are popular pets, and so forth, in a myriad unpredictable, abusrd and hysterically amusing ways. The story itself is peppered with literary in-jokes, which are sufficiently low-brow for a mere BA Lit sort like me to catch, but do give a nice frisson of intellectual thrills. The books look like they could be the real deal - good, soiled, intelligent fun. Stay posted for further reports. Or, wander over to urlLink Fforde Grand Central . Or get yourself a copy, that's always an implied option whenever I post about a book y'know. PS: Gah, this has to be my worst headline yet. Even worse than the ones I write for a living...

 urlLink 7 folktales about flatulence.

 Starship Troopers is often called a controversial novel. Originally written as a juvenile novel, it was deemed too violent for youngsters and released as a general reading book instead. The story itself, such as it is, follows the passage of one Juan Rico from a raw recruit, who has signed up more out of boredom and a need for peer approval than anything else, to a proud, competent member of the Mobile Infantry in humanity's ongoing cosmic war against vicious, insectile enemies. The battle scenes are gritty, utterly compelling and it's a shame that there aren't more of them. However, Heinlein's sole intention with this book was not to create a guts-and-glory sf war tale - this book is very transparently a vehicle for political exposition that may or may not reflect Heinlein's views at the time accurately. (The book was written in 1959 by the way, and Heinlein's memories of his military service during WW2 clearly contributed to a lot of the vivid atmosphere and the ideals herein.) One of the first points that Heinlein makes is a stern argument in favour of flogging as well as capital punishment in the context of military discipline. He also goes on to idealise a gruelling training, depicted in loving detail, and its end result in an ideal military man, disciplined and deadly. However, Heinlein does not just want to turn out efficient killing machines. Rico's rise through the ranks prompts him to sign up for Officer Training school. Here, we get a second dose of exposition. The political system in Heinlein's future earth is militarist meritocracy - only those who have successfully served a military term earn citizenship and the franchise. The system works, Heinlein says, not only because it ensures that only those who proven their commitment to defending the state can vote or run for office, but also because by its very nature it ensures that the very people who are most likely to launch a revolution instead have their energies diverted into military action. These seem rather weak arguments - what would happen to the whole system if and when galactic peace is achieved? Also, Heinlein had clearly not heard of the concept of civil disobedience as an alternate means to political upheaval. Like any meritocracy, Heinlein's is ultimately flawed because there can be no one universal standard to deem a person to be a fit citizen. So I don't really agree with all the arguments in this book. But I would not agree with those who call it a fascist work either - fascists empahsise the state over the individual, and even here, it is clear that Heinlein values the individual a great deal indeed, even if that individual has to be a military person to warrant approval. I didn't really agree with much of what he had to say here, but oddly, I didn't find any of the exposition superfluous - except the three or four pages dedicated to explaining the workings of a combat suit. Perhaps that was just because it is a concept that has since been used much later SF. To refer back to my nice catchy headline, I'd say this book is both SF and tract - because of the subject matter and the expository passages, it does serve the purpose of building a certain case for the military way of life as the finest expression of human values. On the other hand, if science fiction is supposed to be a literature of ideas, then this book surely qualifies, as a well-crafted vehicle for Heinlein's political ideas at the time. __________________ Addendum: urlLink "The Nature of Federal Service in Starship Troopers" by James Gifford (PDF) Heinlein later claimed that he was not advocating a purely military franchise, that civil service also earned the right to citizenship. this essay points out that, be that as it may, Starship Troopers, taken on face value, does in fact describe a purely military franchise. So it a case of Heinlein second-guessing himself in hindsight, or is this just a misinterpreted book?

 Reading Stranger in a Strange Land for a second take, I find myself far less sympathetic to the story, the characters and the ideas than I was to Starship Troopers, which is odd, because ST is obviously a book far less in line with my own views. However, I had to respect ST for being a reasonable attempt to portray a particular ideology. And I guess I should give this book the same benefit, but stating that 9 out of 10 rapes are partly the woman's fault,and then placing that statement in a female character's mouth is such a low blow. A writer has godlike powers over his imaginary worlds - and Heinlein is just misusing these powers in an instance like this. Heinlein seems posessed of a particularly nasty chauvanism - he constantly creates women who are incredibly capable and tough, but then spoils everything by making them nyphomaniacs who wait hand and foot on the menfolk. What he admires in these women, I feel, is not that they know so much or are so capable, but that, despite all that, they still 'give'. Of course I'm open to being contradicted and refuted, in detail preferably, on these perceptions.

 As you can see I've taken a cue from Joey's blog. A little panel over there to the right with covers of the books I'm currently reading or re-reading and links to places where you can buy them. Amazon is not going to be my first choice for this linkage - when it's a small press book, I'll link to the publisher, and when I can find the book on urlLink Clarkesworld , an excellent independant sf/fantasy/horror store, I'll link to them. Sadly, it is likely that Yamazone will wind up getting most of my linkage. Incidently, the only user-submitted review of Borges' Book of Imaginary Beings on Amma's Own says that 'the true market for this book is more likely to be found among players of fantasy role-playing games'. Erm...ehhh. Ah.

 They're taking away my city. Prefabricated theme pubs, which cater to targetted demographics. Fast food and coffee franchises, the same pre-programmed ambience, the same over-priced menu and the same overrrated humanity in every corner of town. Supermarket chains. Everthing is interchangable, everything's the same. They're bleeding my city dry of randomness, of sweet chaos, of the unexpected. They're killing me. Where is my city? Here it is, here it is, in a creaking, dingy old coffee house, half a century old. The corridor where I smoke my cigarette and drink my coffee. A weekend morning, watching the auditor and the professor playing portable chess. A wednesday evening, watching punters flip through their little booklets, heads filled with horseflesh and numbers. A sunday afternoon, wrapped up in a book. Each time I light a cigarette, the waiter causes another cup of coffee to appear beside me. Lost in a web of words, I suck up smoke and caffeine and keep turning the pages. Two hours later, I realise I've consumed half a dozen coffees, half a pack of cigs. I didn't mean to have so many coffees. At least the waiter has the grace to give me a sheepish grin as I pay up. Once, a girl came up to me here and handed me a piece of paper and darted away. It was a sketch of me, but nude, and had her phone number on it. No, I never called. There it is again, in a Mexican retaurant that became a Deadhead beer joint and is now a beacon for great music from the 60s and 70s, strange people to drink with, great food and mediocre beer. One day, I was talking to the manager about pubs in general. About the new, swank pubs. He tells me that he thinks a pub is a place for working people to unwind after a tough day, put down a few taps, have some good food, and not go broke. 'The other pub owners are all idiots,' he confides,'they hike up the beer price to pay for their "ambience" and then they have to introduce happy hours to make people drink the beer. In my pub, every hour is a happy hour.' I've met the strangest people here. A Crowley-ish Creative Director who contradicts everything you say even, or especially, if you happen to agree with something he just said. A perpetually stoned software engineer who somehow manages to crack the worst puns you've ever heard, but that's a good thing because the worse a pun is, the better. The manager of a small chemical factory, who organises motor rallies and knows all the best roads to get out on for a real four-wheel drive shock to the system. A heroin-raddled sometime-model, sometime-freelance writer and her string of hapless boyfriends. A chap who organises wildlife treks for bored corporate pajamahs, and spends the time in between trips doing arcane things for Greenpeace. And so forth. That's my city. That's the life they're draining out of me. Those bastards.

 I turned 27 last week. When my maternal grandfather was 27, he was married and already had two children. Two more were born in the next 4 years, including my mother. When my father was 27, he too was married and already had me. My sister came along a little later. Me, I'm utterly single and, luckily, no little bastards lurking in the corridors. I've been working - for about 5 years now - am financially independant and live on my own. More or less. I do tend to drop in to my mother's place when I want familial company and home food. What else? It's all fairly nebulous, really. I read a lot, and a whole lot of rather odd stuff. I listen to music, used to play the bass myself and write songs, but that's sort of faded away. I write as well, but I'm honest enough to realise that I have a long way to go in that department. I drink - previously mainly beer, lately more of whiskey. I smoke too many cigarettes and too little ganja. I like comics. I love cartoons, kiddie shows and wildlife documentaries. I have some friends. Not a whole lot, but a really good set. Most of what makes my life worth living is really in the mind, my thoughts on the various inputs that crowd into my consciousness, this ongoing construct within my head. Sometimes things come together and I have a neat idea. More often, it's just the thrill of the chase. All, in all not a bad way to be. Here's to the next 27 years...

 Nope, not sure what I was heading towards, previously. I was hoping that if I listed out all the books that I found to be challenging reads I'd be able to define what I look for in my reading. But a real answer to that question would be: a) Too complex to arrive at without taking a 7-year sabbatical to focus on the question b) Too simple to bother about c) Both

 (In which JP takes a halting step towards defining his terms.) Challenging Texts. OK, this is a rather vague category - Winnie The Pooh was a supremely challenging text when I was 3, after all. I was basically thinking of the notion of books that pose a challenge to the reader, in the sense of textual quirk, or layers of meaning, or narrative experimentation, and the like. I'm putting this list together in fits and starts - of which this is the first - as a first step towards figuring out what I mean by challenging texts. Step 1: Cataloguing. William Burroughs has to come first. I've read Junky (hard-boiled reporting, but with all the themes he later expanded upon), Naked Lunch, The Soft Machine, The Ticket That Exploded and My Education: A Book of Dreams. I recently got hold of The Western Lands. I love the frenzied cut-up technique of Naked Lunch and the books around it, the sudden bursts of relatively lucid but utterly surreal narrative that occasionally surface out of the word stew. I treat 'My Education' as a sort of I Ching, to be dipped into at random. I can't comment on Western Lands yet. Although the books are weird reading, I feel that I've gained a lot to think about for my efforts - a certain perspective on addiction as a pattern for the various ways in which power is exerted, a sense of multiple realities, and of the power of the word, of human imagination, to transform. Then there's Italo Calvino. I picked up Invisible Cities when I was a schoolboy, because I'd enjoyed reading of Marco Polo's travels. Boy, was that a head-trip. It infected me with a certain way of looking at cities that has never left me. I believe the every city is the aggregate of the millions of individual cities that each citizen inhabits. You don't just live in a city - you actively create your own specific city within the urban sprawl. This was followed by Cosmicomics - these would be classic sf short stories in a parallel world - and The Castle of Crossed Destinies. Lewis Caroll, for sure. Wonderland was fun and freaky - ooh, mushrooms and bongs! But Through the Looking Glass really blew me away, and nearly lured me into learning to play chess. OK, coffee time, more later. If you have any light to shed, please do click on that little comment link below and give me the benefit of your wisdom. And I say that with no sarcasm. Promise.

 Jeff Noon's Nymphomation is an incredible trip. I haven't felt this sheer blast of viral word, sexy data and sheer music pouring out of a book into my reeling skull for quite a while. It's a surreal, gritty, whimsical, morbid, frothy, deep ride through a world that makes mere cyberpunk pale in comparison. It's the sort of book that gets me wanking with 'jektifs in attempt to describe it, as you can see. What really impresses is Noon's ability to propel a compelling plot and cast while delving further and further into freakish literary quirks, with the first chapterlet of the book mutating constantly at regular intervals, through a sort of Burroughs-ish word-stew into a cyber-Jabberwocky. Watch those bones tumble! Next up is Automated Alice, Noon's trequel to Lewis Carroll's proto-psychedelic masterpieces. And after that a desperate trawl through the alleys, plazas and cul-de-sacs that make up the collective floorspace of Bangalore's book stores in search of more. Read a more reasoned account of Noon urlLink here, at The Modern Word. Oh and here's some urlLink Noon LinkORama. And more goodies to be had at urlLink Noonworld , a fansite.

 A man wakes up in a familiar place, his own bed, his own house, his own world. He switches the geyser on, boils the milk, makes tea, sits down with the morning paper. 15 minutes later, he puts the paper down, shaking his head. Which world is this? Who are these people? What's going on? A sardonic hiss from the fridge. Water pipes rattle in smug disdain. He ignores these comments, as is the right of any animate being, and goes in for a shower. Washed and dressed, he fixes himself a breakfast of puffed wheat and milk, makes another cup of tea. He puts the TV on to catch the morning news. He can understand a the words he hears, the pictures he sees, but none of this is really making sense. A flick of the wrist, he turns the TV off, stands up. A deep sigh, and he heads out into the world. The same strange place he wakes up to each morning. Never knowing how he got there, or where he'll wind up the next day. Outside, he stands by the curb, hails passing cabs. Finally, one slows down, the rat-faced driver leans down from his perch in front. 'Where to, sah?' An address is mentioned, the driver nods and gestures the man into the small, high cabin. Inside, two slatternly young women occupy one of the two benches which are placed opposite each other in the narrow space. One of them eyes him appraisingly and pats the scant inches of vacant space on the seat next to her. The other woman seems lost in narcotic-induced torpor, eyelids heavy and pupils dilated. The man suppresses a shudder, makes what he hopes is a friendly but dismissive gesture and sits down on the other bench, gathering the folds of his long cloak around him. The cab speeds up again, and he looks out of a small, grimy window with a cracked glass, as the winding, maze-like streets flash past. The man looks away from the window, reaches into the folds of his cloak and pulls out a small personal locum. He flicks into life, and continues to peruse the morning's headlines. 'Atlantis rises from Bering Sea. Consternation in Anadyr' 'Wilhelm Tristan Hitler elected Premier of Greater Patagonia.' 'Representative of the Downtrodden People of NorAm presents petition to Emperor Henry Lee of the Greater Sino-Indian Empire' 'ReRolling Stones dominate charts for third consecutive month' 'Patiala-on-Cambridge loses Hussade Tournament to Palghat-on-Oxford 3rd year running. PoO complains about decline in PoC shierls' Politics, anomalous occurrences, entertainment, sports...all the mundane objects of record, in order. But nothing quite connects. Then again, he reflects to himself, when was that not the case? Some days, some worlds, are just a bit stranger than the others, that's all. The lackadaisical woman has been preparing a chillum all this while. With a surprisingly graceful gesture, she ties the ssafi to the mouth piece and offers it to the man. He nods politely, accepts the chillum and cranes his neck across the small gap as the other woman strikes a match and assists him in lighting up. He sucks hard, causing great clouds of aromatic smoke to fill the cabin. Coughing slightly, he releases the mouthpiece, exhales further volumes of smoke, and passes the chillum to the first woman, smiling politely. He returns to his perusal of the headlines. Only, now everything is black and white with thick outlines and flickers from time to time. He cocks an eyebrow, puzzled. Perhaps just the influence of the smoke, maybe something more... Outside, a distant rumbling resolves into the sounds of a riot. A resounding impact, as if of a very heavy object being dropped from a great height, is heard nearby, and the cab draws to a sudden, jolting halt. The man pokes his head out of the door, yells at the driver. 'What the bleeding, syphilitic fuck..?'

 In view of recent noises from the White House about Iran, I half-seriously commented on a forum I frequent that that I wondered who else was on America's hit-list, and if it perhaps included The Rest of the World. A friend replied with this link: urlLink The Project for the New American Century The Project for the New American Century is, to quote their site, 'a non-profit educational organization dedicated to a few fundamental propositions: that American leadership is good both for America and for the world; that such leadership requires military strength, diplomatic energy and commitment to moral principle; and that too few political leaders today are making the case for global leadership.' Their urlLink Statement of Principles elaborates on this premise, clearly stating that they wish to see a return to a Reaganite policy* of 'military strength and moral clarity'. Signatories include Jeb Bush, Dick Cheney, Dan Quayle, Donald Rumsfeld and Francis Fukuyama, to quote the names I could recognise right away. Game point, nobody wins. Decline, right on time. What happened to the dream sublime? Tear it all down, we'll put it up again. Another Empire? * The policy that brought you Iran-Contra, among other goodies...

 Blogger ate up chunks of my template customisations, so I've taken the opportunity to muck about with my linkage a bit. I'm a little overwhelmed at work. My own workload is pretty much under control, but our shortage of designers is seriously crippling me. It's hard for me to commit dates to clients, and to get work done in the time it ideally should be. Why are good designers so very rare? This really troubles me. I've always thought that design is the more important aspect in the sort of marketing communication we do. Sure, I try to keep my copy clean, crisp and correct, and even creative when possible, but I've noticed that it's possible to create an effective communication with good design and average copy, while the opposite is rather rarer. Visual communication is just so fundamental. Damn. I hope we get one more designer soon. On the personal front, my mother's husband has just got a great job in a college in Kopa, near Sringeri. It's about half a day's journey away from Bangalore, and the folks will be moving out by the end of the month. I'll be sorry to see them go, but I suppose it is the best choice. Parents - you give them so much and then you have to let them go.

 What fun. I was actually doing a spot of work at office when something exploded and the power was cut. Crashing sounds from outside. Ran out to the balcony, heard a strange hissing. Hooray, apocalypse. A little while later, it turns out that someone's AC just blew up and fell off the building. In a few minutes, the power was back. Bah. Another false alarm.

 I finished Will Self's Dorian last night. It was, all in all, a worthwhile read, and managed to be a bit more than a re-telling of the original story in modern costumes. By casting Dorian as a conteporary figure, and setting his story in a period which includes the outbreak of AIDS and the death of Princess Diana, Self brings Wilde's story into a dialogue on issues like the contemporary perceptions of sexuality, anxieties related to scary new diseases and the everpresent cult of beauty and youth. Quite apart from all that, the epilogue, with its multipe twists, displacing reality in this fictional narrative not just one but twice (but not quite back to its original condition, I think) is just a brilliant literary headfuck. Wilde would have approved, I think. There's been a lot of critical ink shed and pixel posted on this book, but I'd recommend Self's own urlLink article on the genesis and growth of the project. It's to-the-point, and leaves you to derive further meaning from the book on your own. Oh, by the way, this book goes under 'fantasy' in my personal cataloguing system: it's set in an imaginary version of our real world, where Oscar wilde never existed and the original urlLink The Picture of Dorian Gray was never written.

 urlLink Dinesh Rao has a good urlLink guide to second-hand bookstores in Bangalore on his blog. To which I'd add: The man who runs the pavement bookstore near Coffee House now has a store in Shrungar Complex, the commercial complex next to Coffee House. He has a pretty good range of books, similar to what you'd find in Blossom, and somehow manages to have an excellent selection of science fiction. I understand that he's been given the floorspace free for a trial period in which he has to prove that his is a profitable venture. So show him some love, if you're in Bangalore and want to pick a good book, cheap. This brings me to something that's often bothered me: going by the fact that most bookstores in town have a reasonable sf/f section, and that I'm not buying every single book that they stock, there must be someone out there buying genre fiction too. But they never seem to go shopping at the same time as me - everytime I'm at a bookstore, I'm usually the only person at the sf/f shelves (apart from the odd Tolkien-seeker). So if any of you are the other people out here who buy and read this sort of stuff, stand up and be counted, damnit.

 I've never really bought the argument that things like the Harry Potter phenomenon are creating a real resurgance in reading habits. Narrow crazes like that only feed themselves, not the overall reading scene. Here's proof: But with the Harry Potter craze still in full swing, aren't more children reading, and isn't it reasonable to expect they'll continue the habit as adults? According to Ipsos BookTrends , children's books had a fairly good year in 2003, with early lackluster sales jolted by the June release of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. But despite the Potter phenomenon, Rappaport said, the consumer base for children's books is actually shrinking, with 33 percent of American households buying at least one book for someone under the age of 14 in 2003, compared with 35 percent in 2002. It's reasonable to assume the same applies in India. I frequent bookstores - erm - frequently - and while I see a lot of kids buying Harry Potter books I haven't really seen them coming in and buying anything else. Stupid brats.

 The other story I've been working on. Somewhat closer to recongisable sf. I suspect the use of language maybe a bit OTT, but I'm not sure how much I need to rein that in: Needles of steel, glass and plastic slice through space in every direction, everyday. Many of them wind up lost, broken on the crags of some distant asteroid belt, sucked into the gravity well of a gas giant, or simply absorbed into the furnace of a distant star. Others fetch up on habitable worlds and the seed-crew lands to start a colony; sometimes they die in a few years, felled by unforeseen hazards, sometimes the precious sentient stock takes root and a new world joins the glittering array. Sometimes, it gets really strange. There are whispered tales of ships that fall through vortices in space and time into paradoxical rabbit-holes where up is down and left is right. Tales of ships that slip through the trellis to a still place, untouched by entropy where everything blends together in a super-concentrated singularity. Tales of ships that fly far beyond all known stars and galaxies to oldspace, the farthest circle of this bubble cosmos, where the fabric of reality starts to fade and to fray. My story is stranger still. It was my first time out as captain. I’d ridden on missions before, to-and-fro trade runs between settled worlds, supply chains to fledging colonies, rescue parties to communities which had run into some unforeseen crisis, recovery crews for the remains of settlements that had failed. I’d worked my way up through the ranks from cabin boy to captain of my own colony-ship, looking for a new world to settle. We traveled cocooned in stasis, to shelter us from the cold agony of the empty reaches between the stars.From time to time, the computers pulled the umbilici out of my body, injected my bloodstream with quickening agents and pulled me out of suspension to survey the surroundings. I jacked in to the monitoring systems and ran my accelerated sentience through the datastream anomalies that prompted these resurrections. I was the human agent to make the human decisions to stop and explore. To turn and run or to press forward; decisions which can never be turned over to machines, no matter how sophisticated. I’d already diverted us from a score of dead ends, chosen the more promising branch on a dozen cosmic crossroads, and then subsided back into the ageless dream. This time, however, everything was different. The data that I was being fed was either anomalously rich or disturbingly empty; I could not make out which. Baffled, I accessed further input streams and found the same paradoxical pattern. At last, I activated the external monitors and gazed, amazed, at a planetary surface where none should have been. We seemed to have fetched up on some strange new world that was confusing the senses out of my machines. Stirring out of my pod, I drifted through nutrient fluid to the sphincter, which ejected me into the command section. I showered briefly, pulled on overalls (standard grey, with a small seedling-and-stars motif on left chest) and sat down at my console. I pressed buttons, called up surveillance records and guided cameras and samplers through exploratory routines. Slowly, the flow of data began to subside into intelligible patterns. Gravity: .9. Atmosphere: Present, earth-like with a somewhat higher proportion of nitrogen. Native life forms: single-celled organisms detected. I ran through checks and counterchecks, but the results seemed determined to remain stable after the initial chaos, although much was still unclear. My immediate surroundings seemed to be a hospitable enough terrestrial environment. Beyond a certain point, my instruments failed. I could not discern the overall mass of this world, the star it orbited, the solar system it inhabited, nearby stars, or even the usually omnipresent expanse of space itself. I sighed, and closed my eyes to distance myself from my confusion and think things through. When I opened them, still confused, the data had increased. They seemed to hint at a planetary mass in the range of a regular M-type planet, some orbital data (tilted axis – there would be the familiar seasons and climatic variations). Still no signs of a star, but the vista outside seemed sunlit. Shaking my head in wonder and dismay, I knew I was about to take a gamble. I slipped on a radiation suit and a breathing kit, and then programmed the ship to take off and retreat if I did not return within a stipulated time. My throat was dry, and there was a fluttering in my stomach as I stepped out of the airlock and down the dozen steps to alien soil.

 Fuck. Blogger just ate up chunks of my customisations again. What's the point of these bells and whistles if they don't work??? Seriously considering moving to livejournal, but it's so...basic.

 This is an overly simplistic point, and one that I myself would argue against in most contexts, but my long streak of only reading sf and fantasy is beginning to seem like a sustained flight from 'reality'. While I'd argue that a lot of what I've been reading is actually a commentary on reality, through a skewed view, I feel the need to catch up on my non-genre reading, which I've shamefully neglected lately. There's a new Martin Amis novel I want to read, a recent John Banville novel that I missed entirely, and several authors including Thomas Pynchon, Arturo Perez-Reverte and, oh, scads more, that I've been wanting to explore but haven't for too long. In any case, I've often believed that some of the best fantastic literature I've read - Italo Calvino's Invisible Cities, Martin Amis' Time's Arrow, Russel Hoban's Pilrgermann and more - lies outside the acknowledged sf/f field. Basically, I want to read something interesting and challenging that does not partake of the stock figures and settings of sf/f for a while. I guess Jeff Noon's Nymphomation set me off on this trend, and Will Self's Dorian as well. Each of them had enough invention and speculation to satisfy a hunger for the fantastic, but neither would usually be read by a genre fan. Which I think is much of a mistake as the average mainstream literary reader's failure to engage with worthwhile genre material. So I'm basically taking remedial steps to avoid the ghetto-ization of my intellect. Wee-hawww.

 Here's something I heard of on littlemissattitude's blog: The Rev. Scott Breedlove, pastor of The Jesus Church, Cedar Rapids, Iowa in the USA wanted to hold an evening of book burning and devotion for his flock. The Fire Department weren't keen on the notion, so apparently they just threw the offending matter into garbage cans and lit candles. As lma goes on to comment, Apparently, CNN thinks that the story here is that the fire department wouldn't let the church physically burn the books. That isn't the story at all, as far as I can see. The story here is that people are still burning books in the United States of America ("Land of the Free and Home of the Brave"?) in the twenty-first century and, further, that the fire department was suggesting alternative ways to destroy materials that the church finds offensive. Fra Savonarola would be proud. So would Hitler. They both burned books, art, and other things that they did not approve of. Things that would, oh, tend to make people think, make them feel. "I joked with the guy that St. Paul never had to worry about fire codes," Breedlove is quoted as saying in the CNN article. Another Breedolian gem: Breedlove said he knows many people recoil at the notion of burning books. But, he said, "I would say that our society has come to a point where there are a lot of things we say we don't do anymore that maybe we should be doing."(From urlLink here.)

 My friend urlLink Prem is involved in something rather awesome: the urlLink Place Project . Initiated by Spanish design firm Vasava, the project gives specially chosen deisgners from all over the world about 10 pages in which to create anything at all that encapsulates their relation ship with the environment they live in. 36 designers, east and west, are involved in thios project and Prem's one of them I had a chance to look at contributions from deisgners in Europe and South America, and Prem's own contribution. There's some fascinating stuff here - the open brief seems to have really challenged the participants into finding uniquely idiosyncratic ways of communicating visions of their surroundings. The press release says it a bit more fancily: 'PLACE is a creative and audiovisual research project that seeks to extract and bring to the surface the creative force of the individual in a dominant culture that has been homogenised to the point of sterilisation. It is a barometer of contemporary creation and also an instrument for measuring and thinking about how we are building our history.'

 John C Wright, SF writer and semi-pro windbag on the importance of reading the classics, and the irrelevance of Eastern thought to the West, or indeed, the modern world: The advantage of reading the Great Books, is that you will know where your thoughts are rooted. You will be like a man with memory in an age of amnesiacs. When everyone around you talks as if the present generation invented war and peace, love and hate, and discovered the sexual process, you alone will recall that the world existed before AD 1968. The reading list for St. John's is available on the Internet. Here it is: http://www.sjcsf.edu/academic/curri8.htm Not to be too blunt about it, but the Western Heritage is relevant to us, and the Eastern heritage is not. Should there be non-Western Civilization entries on the list? The answer is no. There is hardly enough room as it is on the bookshelf of a student, or in the brain of a student, to give the works of our own civilization and culture an honest examination. Understanding the work of strangers is a leisure; understanding the work of one's own life and legacy is a duty. We live in an age where our next generation has been raised in appalling ignorance of our civilization, and whether they will be able to pass it intact their children is in doubt. Now is not the time to neglect our forefathers further. Not to be too blunt about it, but the Western Heritage is relevant to us, and the Eastern heritage is not. Take a look at today's newspaper. You might see a debate about the justice of the war in the Middle East. The notion of the "Just War" that frames the debate was invented by St. Thomas Aquinas, based on Aristotelian thought. Familiarity with these root ideas deepens an otherwise shallow understanding of the debate. In contrast, Sun Tzu's theory of warfare did not affect Aquinas or Machiavelli or Clausewitz, and does not influence the theory or practice of warfare in the modern West. Reading the Bhagavad Gita or the Book of Five Rings, the Shahname or the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, will add nothing to the student's understanding of the debate. Even in China itself, the main tension is between the ideals of Marx and Adam Smith, two Western men. The student riot and massacre at Tiananmen Square were not caused by a dispute over the ideas of Mencius or Xunzi And so likewise for all the great issues of our day. Our debates are always framed in terms of individual rights, the sacredness of human life, the duties a patriot owes his city. These ideas are from the Enlightenment, the Middle Ages, or from Ancient Rome. The notions unique to the East, Dharma and Karma, the Four Noble Truths, the Middle Path or the Way of Heaven, deepen no understanding of a Western discussion. I'd say that the situation he describes so well IS the problem. Perhaps if the West had spent less time shoving its own ideas and values on us unwashed pagans, the world wouldn't be in this mess. Maybe it's time to seriously see what other cultures have to offer the overall human discourse. Maybe I shouldn't be wasting any more time reading books by people who think my culture is marginal and irrelevant. Anyone want to buy used copies of Wright's first two books off me? Real cheap...

 Onward! And Onward! And Onward I go Where no man before could be bothered to go Till the soles of my shoes are shot full of holes And it's all downhill with a bullet This ramblin' and rovin' has taken it's course I'm grazing with the dinosaurs and the dear old horses And the city streets crack and a great hole forces Me down with my soapbox, my pulpit The theatre ceiling is silver star spangled And the coins in my pocket go jingle-jangle do you love me?

 Tonight, I'm leaving to Suratkal for a quick seaside vacation. Deathrider is procuring tickets and herbs even as I type these words. Regular service will resume on monday.

 urlLink Michael Dirda has just written an interesting urlLink article that looks at the dumbing-down in American reading habits. It's part of an ongoing dialogue on the 'death of reading' in the US that I won't comment on here. However, I would like to draw attention to a few passages that resonated particularly well for me. The first offers a definitive, succinct definition of 'literature', a term that is often bandied around and dismissed as subjective or meaningless in debates on the quality of reading matter people are turning to: A true literary work makes us see the world or ourselves in a new way. Most writers accomplish this through an imaginative and original use of language, which is why literature has been defined as writing that needs to be read twice. Great books tend to feel strange. They leave us uncomfortable. They make us turn their pages slowly. I couldn't agree with him more. I really don't read to be comforted, to have a pacifier of verbiage jammed into my mind. I look for vivid imagination, of course, but also for something that makes me think, that leaves me with questions that relate to my real life in my real world, that introduces me to new perspectives and new ideas. I also expect to be entertained in the process, but my concept of entertainment does not necessarily coincide with comforting amusement. That doesn't mean I need every book I read to fundamentally disturb me - I'd say that humorous works like those by Douglas Adams or more recently Jasper Fforde, make the cut because in the midst of all the wit there are real ideas being shared. Whether it's Adams' 'look what jokers we are, really' satire or Fforde's invitation to explore the process of fiction itself in a deeper light, these books have ample literary payoffs, which only adds to the fun. The sentiment in the next passage echoes so clearly my own reactions to John C Wright's rather blinkered attitudes in the same vein, that I simply have to quote it: We all need to explore more widely and deeply the truly wonderful books of the past. And there are so many. How is it that I've never looked at Samuel Richardson's Clarissa, the first great English novel, never read Freud's Interpretation of Dreams, never explored Chinese literature at all? Unless we try to familiarize ourselves with the best that human beings have accomplished, we will doom ourselves to be only half-formed wraiths, scarcely human beings at all. I also have to agree with Dirda's discomfort with the Internet: Why persist with Plutarch or George Eliot or Beckett or William Gaddis when you can drop into a chat room or gaze at digitized lovelies ... ? Instead of reading Toqueville or Henry Adams, we just check out the latest blogs. We turn toward the bright and shiny, the meretricious tinsel, the strings of eye-catching beads for which we exchange our intellectual birthright as for a mess of pottage. Speaking for myself, the net has only furthered my reading - whether through recommendations and reviews posted online or by the act of buying books through e-bookstores. But then again, I've already been conditioned to be a dedicated reader. I grew up in the ambience of books - the rows of books in my parents' and grandparents' houses, not to mention the books in the bookshop we used to run. The fact that both my parents read a lot. The early introduction to challenging and rewarding books that may have seemed beyond my age-group to most parents. Perhaps for someone who has never been very inclined towards reading, the net can only serve to further reduce that inclination. But the internet is not going away. It's becoming more and more immersive and involving. What can we do about it? There's something to feel disturbed by and think about.

 I'm scared. Terrified. The hour of my doom grows closer every second and there's nothing I can do to deflect time's arrow. I downloaded a Sleater-Kinney song last night and read an article by Lisa Crystal Carver this morning. I should have known better. I've been infected with the dreaded girl-germ now. In the Narcognomickon of Abdulla Al-Jazrad, the Mad Arab has this to say of the girl-germ: 'From deathless aeons, in dimensions unknown to mere mortals, comes the direfull girl-germ. It's sigil is the pink heart, and it may be summoned unbeknownst by the most hapless of mortal males with distressing ease. Once invoked, it can not be dismissed by The Conjuration "XILQA XILQA BESA BESA" or any other spell normally efficacious against eldritch powers. There is no cure and no escape. Only pain, madness and the duplicitious release of death...' Alissthere Crawling, a more recent adept of the black arts, describes the course of this deadly infestation in his Book of Flies: 'The girl-germ passes into your brain through your eyes while you are reading chick lit, incubates for about 6 weeks, sucking up your brain juices and growing in size until one day, with a sickening rending of bone and tissue, your skull is cleaved apart from within and out comes - a girl!!! Her name is BABALON and she is Nuit. Do what thou will!' I am doomed. Pity me, and learn from my dire fate. I can feel the pressure building, vile forces pressing out from within my cranium...Ssalmani-ia ina bi'sha duri tapxa-a duppira...Ssalmani-ia ana GISHBAR tapqida duppira...Barra! Barra!...Akhkharu Dingir Xul...arghhhhhhhhh ~apologies to HP Lovecraft and all other injured parties~

 I just realised that I still haven't used my 3 Gmail invites. If you're one of the people who missed out on the initial feeding frenzy and still want one, let me know.

 This weekend, I also found time to read Jack Finney's 1954 novel, The Body Snatchers, the basis for two movies that I know of. It was a crisply-written, well-paced book that reminded me a lot of works by Richard Matheson and John Wyndham. It has Wyndham's sense of a familiar community being overrrun by horrific events, what Brian Aldiss called the 'cozy catastrophe', and the element of a larger comment being made about an aspect of the human condition within a pulp-sf format that I associate with Matheson's 'I Am Legend' and 'The Shrinking Man'. In this case, the novel can be seen on some level as a depiction of the increasing alienation of modern life, and a dramatisation of the horror of it all. Unlike the more recent movie version, however, the story ends on a positive note, with the ominous pod-people proving to be no match for simple human ingenuity. Leaving all that aside, it's simply a good yarn, well told. The style is restrained and lucid, and the plot is largely tight and well-knit, apart from a couple of glitches here and there.

 I hate registering with sites just to read content. It's time-consuming, and who wants to remember so many passwords anyway? I certainly don't, and I don't really trust these sites to protect me from spam when I give them my e-mail ID. The good news is, there's a site that provides a way out. All you need to do it type in the url of the site you want to access, pick up a username and password from this site and browse away. Pass the word around: urlLink www.bugmenot.com .

 A good weekend, but very draining. Firday night, I met up with Prem and hit Pecos. The beer was flat, the popcorn was bland and the music was good, except for an excess of Phish. We saw a surprising number of attractive women - perhaps I need to start frequenting Pecos regularly again. Last I was there, the place was dominated by big, loud, drunken and obnoxious women with no redeeming charms. Then, Prem's ex-boss from Bombay joined us and we visited Guzzler's Inn as a sort of sidebar to our journey down to The Tavern. That is one grim place. Stag night in the outer circle of hell. And so we wound up in The Tavern - a far healthier gender mix and a better range of music, extending to some Gomez as well. The Tavern girls had nothing on the ones we saw at Pecos though - just the standard-issue big hair and tiny tops. Somehow the women in Pecos seemed far more individualistic and interesting. These girls seemed like the interchangable starlets from the latest Indy-Pop music video. Yawn. The next day, after recovering from the inevitable hangover, I met up with Shreekanth, GK, Diku and Satish and generally ambled around Bangalore for most of the day. A visit to Landmark to plan out which books to fling my salary away on next month. Shreekanth picked up a Fripp/Eno CD that was dauntingly abstract. For some strange reason I kept sitting through the wash of nearly incoherent sound, hoping against hope that the riffage would start any minute now. Nevertheless, seems a worthwhile album to explore in the right mood. Then in the evening, we picked up hooch and snacks and headed down to my place, where my roomie Ralph graced the occasion with his presence. The music was varied a and all good (as they were all my CDs!): Jane's Addiction, Soundgarden, Nevermore, assorted blues and finally Amorphis. The next morning, it was classic rock time courtesy Shreekanth: Thin Lizzy's Jailbreak and some Accept. yearghhh! So there you have it. A perfect, perfectly pointless and utterly brainless weekend chronicle. Hooray.

 urlLink Lovers in a Park - François Boucher &nbsp; urlLink Brian Aldiss' The Malacia Tapestry is a baroque entertainment, a ribald picaresque. It's an admirable feat of world building, creating a city - Malacia - that exists in a bizarre yet familiar era that closely parallels 17th Century Italy. It's also a social commentary, a fact that might be lost on some, and underscored for others, by Aldiss' choice of protagonist. Perian de Chirolo is a young, struggling actor seeking to ingratiate himself into a place in polite society, not to mention into the bed of every personable young woman he meets. As the story opens, he seems gloriously carefree and exuberant, notwithstanding his impoverished state. He trades witty epithets with his friends, enjoys an affair with an influential empressario's wife, the acress La Singla, and, apart from some concerns about the source of his next meal, seems quite content with his strivings. Malacia is a city under a curse, or perhaps a blessing: it is fated never to change, never to progress. A shadowy, anonymous council ensures that all signs of dissidence and progress are brutally stamped out. But you can't keep progress down forever - can you? Otto Bengtsohm, an artisan from the North, has perfected a form of phtography, and is in the process of creating a new art form - Malacia's first photo-play - under the aegis of Andrus Hoytola, a man of prestige and power. De Chirolo is engaged to participate in this pioneering production. In the process, he meets Armida, Hoytola's daughter and pursues a torrid affair with her. They are betrothed in secret, and De Chirolo resolves to find some way to advance himself and be a suitable match for his high-born lover. That doesn't stop either of them from dallying with any of the other willing partners available, in a situation that closely parallels the play De Chirolo and Armida are acting in - a melodramatic tale of betrayal and adultery. Only, De Chirolo finds himself starting to take things seriously - Armida's love, for instance. At the same time, he is exposed to seditious Progressivist talk from Bengtsohm and his working-class comrades. As things build to a head, De Chirolo finds all his illusions stripped from him - his ambitions of social advancement, his increasingly idealised love for Armida, even his faith in his best friends. Supernatural visitations and gloomy prophecies by the soothsayers he frequents add to his sense of despair and disillusionment. The story ends with De Chirolo heartroken and battered, being ministered to by his friend and sometime lover, La Singla. He has been asked to join the Progressivists, who plan a big push in the day ahead, but has not made a decision. We leave him in La Singla's arms as Aldiss draws the curtain on this vivid series of vignettes. There are some amazing set pieces here - De Chirolo's flight in a balloon above the Turkish camp, his slaying of an ancestral beast, and several visits to brilliant, forgotten artists and scholars, including De Chirolo's own father, in their decaying homes. There's much rich description, sparkling banter and imagination at play in this book. But what is it about? Does it have a point? I think it does. Not everyone gets involved in revolutions and protests through ideology or even for petty personal gain. Sometimes, the decision is a human one, sometimes you need to have your hearts broken in the most direct way possible before the scales fall from your eyes. We will never learn what De Chirolo's choice the next morning was - but I for one came away from this book with an appreciation for the human stories that underlie the larger current of history. Parallels - there is something in the tone and flourish of this book that reminded me of M John Harrison's Viriconium Tales. The depiction of a chaotic, smelly city, and the undercurrent of social upheaval reminded me of China Mieville's Perdido Street Station. I know that Mieville is an admirer of Harrison, but I wonder if some of the setting and theme of PSS is perhaps derived from The Malacia Tapestry.
