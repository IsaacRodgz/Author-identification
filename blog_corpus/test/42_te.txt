 HOLLA it's late, and i'm off to bed, but i haven't posted in a while, so here i am. Daddy Bu's b-day party @ the cabin was today... (fyi: Daddy Bu(na) = Mamma Flo(rida)'s brother.) Good times. Got a little bit of sun for the first time all year. I am soooo white. and fat in a bikini :( but not for long since i'll be back full-swing in tammy's class starting next week! she kicks butt, literally. and she's HOTT. melissa and i looked thru bridal magazines. last night i had THE WORST DREAM!! We were at melissa's wedding, and right before the ceremony, my mom comes up to me and is like, "Well, Heather, since all of the family is already here, and we've already paid for this entire wedding, we're just gonna have a double wedding and marry you off today, as well... So when they bring all the legal papers over to melissa to sign, you go ahead and sign some, too..." And I didn't even get a dress, or get to walk down the aisle, and i tried to tell people that it was MY WEDDING TOO but they weren't focusing on me and i just sorta melted in with the crowd. it was sad. Unplanned Double Weddings SUCK. Actually, i kinda think ALL Double Weddings would suck. aight, yo's, i'z gotts ta bounce (into bed... since i'm so fat... and white...) Me Luv You LONG Time. -h :)

 HOLLA betsy....coming over tonight for some drinks???? we're making some white russians....etc. whatever. and of course we'll watch some good old teddy ruxpin! that's a classic...hahahahahah. i love it when teddy thrusts into grubby the caterpillar and moans....good stuff...we should write to the producers of that show and janoch and have janoch make a special guest appearance in teddy ruxpin...they would have a ROCKIN/"HUM(p)MING" good time. shawna, go get me a fruit snack shout out from oscar....especially to you BETSY!! he's thinking of you a little bit right now:) so brianna wants to go to splash town....betsy..i think we should go and do our plan...you know what it is. sue, you will hear the secret when you get to h-town....b/c that's the rule. sue, why do you have a stomach infection....i think you've been SWALLOWING a little too much....(food).......remember to spit..haha. heather...when are you coming to visit? we're going to visit katie f. in austin tx in june...you are all invited. we will make some YUM drinks...woo hoo. before i leave ... whoooa... whoooaaaa ... WHOOOOOOAAA ... whooooooaaaaa hahaha....betsy..you know! dena

 the problem that i have with thinking that jesus looked like jim cavawhatever is that jim is hot. odds are jesus was not. (if you dont think that jim is hot , please go see the count of montecristo and i swear it will change your mind...count of montecristo--amazing). im not saying that jesus wasnt good looking, im just saying that i probably wouldnt have wanted to makeout with him. and thats a good thing. i think thats how he got so famous. think about it--the truly powerful people in the world are never really really really good looking (shawna, did you think of zoolander when you read that?). they are acceptable to look out. thats all. no disformities. nothing growing out there neck. no special hair. just average. average to a little above average. but theyre never all that good looking. once you cross a line, people hate you. they become jealous because you are good looking and successfull. you cant have both. its greedy. but you can be successful and not so bad to look at. so, all in all, jesus was probably nothing at all like jimbo. in fact, he probably looked a little like a mix between yassar arafat and ariel sharon--(notice how i was very PC and took a muslim and a jew. i dont discriminate... waaaait, yes i doo) . note: ignoring my political views and imaging that i was thrown in a bar with both of them, there would be no making out................. the part that does seem to challenge my point a little was a little whore we all know as mary magdalen. if a whore falls in lurf with God, then hes got to be decent looking. shes had a lot of men, right? my answer to this is, she fell in love with his personality and the fact that he didnt rape her. wow, sue on a tangent again...thats odd...well, im at the library again and i really really really just want to take my exams and be done with them. ive had enough. i cant study anymore. i lie. i can and i will. but i wont enjoy it dammit. ok, maybe a little. so arent we the popular schmopulars. everyone wants to read about our lives and read our stories. well good news for them-- we will be publishing a book soon--as soon as we get our contract and probably an accompanying movie deal--that way you wont have to actually read--you can WATCH OUR LIVES TOO (sort of how rpw is watching shawnas life right now) ok, i have wasted too much time on your slags (british for slut/whore/skanks) and i must fine tune my brain. can we go see phil when i get back...and stoeberl???? he wants to have my babies i know it! late

 yall I was driving down 1960 today and I got this really really weird feeling in my stomach. Then, all of the sudden, I look in the sky and the clouds turn really really black. I was like... damnit, more rain.... But then the weirdest thing happened. A HUGE blast of light came through and opened up the black clouds and a face (which resembled James Caviezel from passion of the christ) appeared. The face then began to speak...... the words that I heard were soo touching. It said "Shawna, you forgot to blog yesterday, your bfff's need you now more than ever, so go... BLOG!" .... at that point I drove straight home... and here I am! Ok that was not true, but it sounded cool. Anyway i finally fixed our computer... it had about 50000000000 million viruses, and then i had to drive allll over 1960 to try and find the damn Time Warner store to pick up the installation cd for our cable modem... it was sooo gay. I swear i was driving at least 5 hours.. MAYBE MORE. Thursday night was very fun...betsy arrived and immediately the fun began. Oscar was VERY delighted to see her.... i guess betsy just has this ora that turns on dogs. Anyway we actually began the night watching janoch (pronounced: yanosh) why brianna (my lil sis) owns this tape? I dont know... its a bit frightening that a cartoon made for children involves a transvestite bear with a blonde wig. Betsy already told that story tho. Anyway we watched a bunch of weird movies and forced betsy to watch our old Track Videos from klein.... these videos were always shown at our end of the year banquet and usually had really cheesy music. Also most of the pictures on the video were usually of the kid whose parent made the tape...i wont mention names cough cough stefanie w.... cough. Anyway then at about 1 am we were officially bored and ran out of home videos to torture bets with.... soo we went to whataburger. IT was pouring down rain and we got out of our cars and got all wet.... went in whataburger and then the manager looks at us and goes 'OOOh NO, I dont think so..... We are closed...." And we then got kicked out. If your closed lock your f-in door biaatch. We then stood in the rain trying to find somewhere to eat. Denny's it was. We shared an appetizer and I got dr.pepper with cherry in it. It was so nasty... i puked in betsy food... dont tell her. Anyway it was a fun night.... and i found out dena smokes crack. what a crack whore. Today i went running... or TRIED to run.... my knee is still being a bitch and swells up every time i move. But i got about 2 miles in. Better than nothing i suppose. We just got back from my little sisters piano recital... OH MY GOD, it was soo long! When i did piano recitals as a kid.. (or last year... shhh.. jk) there were about 3 people watching including my parents and I played one song. This one had a list of all the kids... THERE WERE 40! And they each played two songs. At first it wasnt so bad because the little kids played songs like hot crossed buns and skip to my loo.... but the older kids liked to show off and play "hard" songs. I wanted to shoot myself. The last guys song was no joke, 15 minutes long. He teased you too.. you thought the song was over because he would pause for a second... so i kept standing up... but then he just KEPT going... ahhhh! Anyway... i guess that is what you get when your folks go on a cruise for 2 weeks and leave you with a 12 year old. I cant wait to spend the next week being a softball mom! Ok this blog got long.. and i meant to post a short one. Oh well, you like it! Ok im off to eat some dinner... we might go see mean girls tonight. I have been waiting forever to see it.... ANGIE CALL ME! HOLLA

 HOLLA...i want toknow denas secret--it plagues me at night that i dont know. I dont know if i told you but i ran in a trackmeet three days ago and i kicked major ass--the bad thing is that i am really really sore. good story. dont worry, i wont tell it again. next story-iwent to the doctor and they wanted to do a RECTAL examiniation on me. I of course said no and settled for the feeling up of my boobs instead but then they sent me home with a cup and i have to give them a stool sample. well at least theres no hand up by butt. they think i might have a stomach infection has anyone heard the song "leave" by jojo. I love that shes so angry and only 13. thats great. I think that the music needs to stop filling girls wtih the illusions of love (re: lame ass song "eighth world wonder") and make them angry--otherwise girls will settle (re:shawna with scott) and it takes someone telling them how lame they are for a whole year to get them to move on (shawna, i blame the music industry) I just had a huge bowl of cereal and have to get ready to go to school and its 9 on a saturday. that makes me super lame. i went out last night to a few pubs on the river and it was funny because liza and i were nice and tipsy and kept calling it the meat market because of all the bankers in their suits. we started sending them telepathic waves and making them come over and talk to us. we were really trying to get this one gorgeous guy (through our tele-pathetic waves) to come and talk to us but he didnt sense our want. we gave up and decided to jst stare at him for ten minutes non stop. it worked. we freaked him out but hey, i have his number so i guess we won didnt we? i started my period last night. Im not pregnant! yay. theres really no reason i would be but its always fun to bleed right? ok, time to go. laaaaate. i come home soon! get excited.

 HOLLA so wednesday night was my last night in college station so naturally i went out and got a little intoxicated and ray might have spent the night... so anyway we wake up the next day and it was 11:30 holly crap i had nothing packed and the parents were going to be there at 1... needless to say they arrive and im not packed & they were not amused "angela why arent you packed, what have you been doing"... ooops so they help me finish packing and move me back home i worked george lopez today, i work arrowfest tomorrow (there will be some high class white trash at that concert) and then mary j blige sunday this is good cause i am poor! home sucks i have only been here 2 days and it is boring i shawna we need to hang out before i go crazy with boredom im glad i am no longer completely dead to you betsy ill do my best while on probation well im out gonna get some rest to prepare for all the mullets & wife-beaters i will be seeing tomorrow! peace out!

 HOLLA Yesterday, after a long day of working, working out, and cutting out circles, I had the pleasure of spending a few hours with my fellow bffff bloggas, Dena and Shawna. I forgot how demented and hilarious their world is. We spent most of our time watching one of Brianna's creepy videos...the main character was this transexual bear named Janosh. He spoke in this deep voice that was not befitting of a cartoon bear and wore a blond a wig which looked like a mop. This was seriously a children's cartoon. Then we watched Teddy Ruxpin...oh my. I felt like I should've been stoned or under some sort of other influence. It was the most bizarre, not to mention homoerotic, cartoon I've seen in some time. Let's just say Teddy Ruxpin and his his worm friend weren't just "playing leap frog." Later we watched one of their old jazz recitals, which was hilarious b/c they basically just walked around the stage with their hands in the air with Mariah Carey playing in the background. And Shawna looked four. I think what topped the experience off was that Oscar (for all of you outside readers, Oscar is their dog) had a boner the whole time. What can I say...I'm irresistible. Dena told me her secret. Haha bloggas now I know! Ha! Later on in the night we went to Denny's and split a set of six of these little hamburgers...it was really good, I'd recommend it to anyone. I just finished Gone With the Wind. I feel lost in life. That always happens to me when I get completely enraptured in a novel, especially one of that calibur. I'm starting to get hungry but I can't think of any place to go...hhhhhmmmmmm anyway I'm out. Blog you later.

 so it is raining. Surprise surprise.... its been raining every day this week and frankly i am just getting annoyed by the whole thing. Summer is boring as is, when you add rain to the equation you rule out 99 % of the things that could possibly diminish your boredom. So now i am left with that 1 % of things to do.... which i have taken full advantage of. Eat Eat and Eat. And now i will tell you my theory: The reason houston was the Fattest City and now takes runner up to that title, I think the fact that it rains so much plays a part. When it rains... people get lazy, they dont want to drive, they dont want to workout, basically they just dont want to move. So they stay in their pj's all day, laying on the couch watching tv and ..... EAT. And they keep eating till the rains stops. This is why houston is fat. So dont blame McD's and Wendy's, its the rains fault. Last night after we ate dinner for my mom's bday me and dena went over to JMACs to play some halo.... it was a good time. I kicked dena's ass. She sucks. Then we watched Zoolander... although i have seen this movie approximately 3,545 times, there's always room for a little zoolander. "Did you think i was too stupid to know what a Ugoogly is?!" ... what a great movie. Anyway that movie was over at about 3 am... and at about 4 am I had to drive back to klein. JMac's is dowtown.... so I was very sleepy and driving on wet roads..... not a good combination. But i made it safely thanks to the musical talents of Beyonce and Jay-Z. Today dena rudely woke me up to inform me that we HAD to go get manicures and pedicures with my mom.... I was confused as to why i was being forced to get my nails done... but i went along with it. My mom is going on a cruise next week with my dad so i guess she wanted to get her nails done and invited dena and I. I really cringe at the idea of paying some ladies who dont speak english to pick dirt out of my nails and paint them... because frankly i can do this on my own... But i was pleasantly surprised when i went to sit down in the chair and it was a massaging chair. Plus i got a free coke... makes the $37.50 all worth it! I always feel weird tho because the ladies dont speak good english...so sometimes (Nancy) would ask me questions and I didn't know what she said so i just replied with.."Oh yeah..." one time she asked me how old i was and i said "oh im fine thank you" .... yeah i was a bit embarassed. Anyway my hands are soft and my nails are painted. I feel bad for the lady who did dena's pedicure.... dena has baseball size calluses on her feet so the lady pulled out this huge block that looks like a cheese grater and started rubbing away on dena's feet. haha... i laughed because my feet did not need any cheese grating action. Sue, BSB is SOOO AWESOME. Remember when we listened to their music and you would point out every time brians part came (which was like 3 seconds of the song) haha...You totally had eye sex with him. Bets, lets sooo be bored together in the rain (aka Eat and get fat) ..... my parents will be out of town till the 24... PARTY AT MY HOUSE... haha... right. Angie, sorry i didnt get your message till 4 am... but i do not have blake's phone number. Also, when will you be home? Jaime..... uhhhhhhhhhhhh where did you go? Heather, OH my gosh, you are sexy. Too bad we are cousins! ;) LOL SISTA BFFF TTYL LYLAS! dena, you have french tips on your toe nails... lol what a loser! HOLLA

 HOLLA--sorry, gonna be a quick one because i have to get back to studying but i have to tell you a great story. no. its not great. but yall will appreciate it. it was a life altering moment though. i was playing music videos on my computer (yahoo music is a godsend...sort of how ww1 was a godsend for the russians..dont ask). i was listening to "what a girl wants" by xtina--hot--and then after her came BSB and "quit playing games with my heart" . and this is the video where they walk around in the rain and are 12 and nick is still skinny and its soooo freaking funny. i NOW understand why boy bands were the punchline to every joke of the late 90s. it was one of the most corny pieces of "art" i have ever scene. brian was still hot, no doubt. and Daaaaaaamn, howie, daaaaaaamn. these adolescent boys are seducing the camera and getting rained on. so odd. soooooo odd. i laughed. and i though who better to tell this revalations to than my bffffffffs? beside, you guys are the only ones who will remember this video and probably go to yahoo and look it up. aight kids, playtime is up--back to agriculture...go aggies, whoop! not. see you hoes soon...goodluck this weekend bets

 HOLLA Ok so my blog did not get posted last night, but I'll move on from it. I remember Caroline...hi Caroline! Very interesting perspective on urban landscapes...I like it. Jesus I am starving and there is zero food in this house. I have tendonitis in my knee. Let's see how fragmented I can make this blog... I don't have much to say except my shoes smell and I'm getting cranky b/c I'm so damn hungry. Summer workouts have started so now I'm starving all the time. As I was trying to say before...Angela, you are revived. But you are on "dead to me probation." So don't you think you can waltz back in here and make a couple of little turd blogs and think that makes up for lost blogging little missy! I have nothing left to say...I can't think b/c I'm blinded by hunger. And I need to get laid. Stalkers, how about it? Ummmmmmmmmmmmm neat. Dena and Shawna if yall aren't diddling your grandmother later call me b/c I have nothing to do tonight. Let's all be bored together. Sounds like fun? I thought so.

 HOLLA...since shawna thinks i have NO dedication, i thought i'd write a quick shout out...... SHOUT OUT! alright, more news when i get some dedication...shawna...come on...give it to me! dena

 Well, Here i am at UH in the computer lab. Dena is sitting next to me, she is reading our blog at this moment trying to catch up... because she is TOO COOL to blog every day. She say's i hog the computer but NOT ONCE has she asked me to get off...so as you can she, her dedication is at zero. Our computer at home broke and freezes everytime you turn it on. Which kinda sucks no only because now i can't get on the internet but.... also i am taking TWO SUMMER SCHOOL CLASSES ONLINE. Noooo way am i driving to UH every day to get on the internet... actually scratch that. I am driving to UH every day... i have to take a class here. Ok everything is alright now. But still.... my blogging weekly average might decrease . SORRY. Um. Yeah. Dena and I are going to go to JMAC's to see mike for a couple hours then its off to Taste of Texas to celebrate mamma flo's bday for the 52nd time. Which is good because she turned 52 yesterday.... one party for each year you are alive. OH yeah, Happy Birthday Uncle Adam... heather tell your daddy bu i said that~ ;) ... Ok. well we must head out...so HOLLA BOSS.... HOLLA ...again?

 HOLLA im trying to get good at posting so heres another exciting tid bit from angela... so im all kinds of excited because i took my last final today which means it is officially summer and even better my grades for this semester are pretty damn good (3A's & 2B's) especialy considering how much i went out and how much alcohol i consumed this semester! this summer is going to be bad ass in good ole spring get ready shawna cause the parents are leaving me a lot and im going to get bored all by myself! maybe my "well off festive" boy will come visit and buy us stuff hell one night out at a bar he bought 2 bottles of crystal & 3 of dom... be jealous! anyway there will be fun gatherings at my house again... get excited well im about out of stuff to say so lata kids

 HOLLA no problems here! sucks to be y'all sometimes...

 so i hear yall haven't been able to post?! I dont know why..... hmmm. Well you know what they say: If you fall off the horse... get back on! (which means keep trying ho-bags) HOLLA

 hello yall. I got bored and started playing around with our blog. I tried to make it as HOT as it possibly could be. But seeing that i am new to HTML heather will probably do better with that. So i will let her fix all my mistakes. Jaime, you need to send her a picture ASAP that way you can officially join our family. Also, everyone needs to create their profiles, you can do this when you log into blogger..... If you want... but i think you should, and yeah, you have to because i said so... im an administrator. So there. Tonight was mama flo's b-day. We cooked her an italian dinner and i made her lemon birthday cake.... it was yummy. I am surprised at how good our spaggetti sauce came out since me dena and brianna all added our own special ingredients.... but it tasted ok. I guess we'll find out later when it is digested... I hate rain. I also hate driving in a hurricane.... i drive a beetle... soo when its windy, my car likes to fly off the side of the road. Sue i know you think i suck at driving.. but i promise its the wind. haha. So it rained today. and it sucked. But im still happy bc i am a happy person. Sue, sorry bout your luck, but at least you can drown your sorrows in alcohol... because that is the answer to everything. So get drunk and you'll forget EVERYTHING. ;) Actually scratch that.... make out with as many boys as possible,tell them you love them and then break their hearts.... and then you wont feel as bad about yourself, because you will be making other people feel bad. I am such a good friend, p.s never ask me for advice. Ok well really i just wanted to let yall know that the blog is officially pink, because that is my favorite color, and we all know this blog is really all about ME. LOL SISTAS BFFF LOVE YA CALL ME THIS SUMMER TTYL LYLAS! HOLLA

 HOLLA yay! it's so cute, now, shawna!! def has my approval. good work. good work. -h :)

 HOLLA angela - Just when I think you can't get any DEADER... you go and do something like this. AND TOTALLY REDEEM YOURSELF!! seriously, girl, i think we had all lost our hope and faith in you as a bfff blogga. Now onto your rich mexican boyfriend... i believe the PC term that we have been accustomed to using is "FESTIVE" (see explanation urlLink here ). And i'm sure we have a better PC term for rich, but can't think of anything suitable at the moment. haha. anyway, just wanted to let you know that you're not dead to ME! as long as shawna vouches for you, you know?! out. heather

 So it hurts that Betsy said im dead to her EVEN after i saw a movie with her so im hoping if i return to blogg i will make it back to the living so here is my review of the movie: ~It was fabulous i mean for an olsen twin movie ~It exceeded the previous movies but still completely predictabble... they had a corny problem, they met boys, had a fashion show, cheesy chase scene, barely kissed their boys, and lived happily ever after ~But of course i loved it anyway Anyway what else is going on... oooh im dating a rich mexican... i think his parents are drug lords... its fun, ill let you know how that goes Well i need to go grab some food so ill have to be going peace out kids

 1. Kill Bill Vol.1 & Vol.2 are quentin tarentino movies starring Uma Thurman... Basically its a lot of sword fighting, bloodshed and Uma Kicking Major Ass. I did not want to see it but was dragged to the theater and I ended up thoroughly enjoying it. So, I saw the second one and enjoyed it to. I reccomend it.. just watch out because you might go on a killing spree afterward like i did... i mean..... like i dreamed. 2. I dont even want to comment on this because if i hear one more person SAY THAT, i think i really will pull an Uma Thurman. Pretty much every drunk frat guy feels the need to say that to you, thinking that you will be awwed by it and maybe follow them to their bedroom, backseat, bathroom or kitchen counter. Either way... its stupid and annoying, which reminds me... dena next time you say that i will slap you. (Heather, i believe it has something to do with Dave Chappelle) 3. Dont be embarrassed about your newly appointed woman-hood... cherish it! You should celebrate your growing breasts and underarm hair. There are so many things you can do now that you are 'a woman'... like: get pregnant or think you are pregnant even though there is NO possible way you could be unless you are having jesus' twin brother; have embarassing instances where you really shouldnt have been wearing white pants in the first place; not being able to go to the beach, lakehouse, or pool with your friends because you are "sick".... and best of all, you get to ruin numerous pairs of your "favorite" underwear. Yay! Congrats! HOLLA

 Yall i just wrote that last post and just realized something. Even though I WAKE UP at 2 o'clock in the afternoon doesn't mean it is "morning" .... so "Top of the afternoon to ya" .... p.s Caroline is cool because she said our blog is cool. HOLLA

 HOLLA TOp of the mornin' to ya!

 HOLLA WANNA BE A BALLA, SHOT-CALLA, 20-INCH BLADES ON THE IMPALA... CALL HER, GETTIN' LAID TONIGHT. SWISHER ROLLED TIGHT GOTTA SPRAY MY ICE. I HIT THE HIGH-WAY, MAKIN' MONEY THE FLY WAY, YOU KNOW THERE'S GOTTA BE A BETTER WAY, A BETTER WAY, BETTER WAY, YEAH... shawna - i've never tried to change blog skins before, so i don't know if we'd lose all our stuff or not!! you should make a fake temp blog, put a bunch of sh*t on it, change skins, and then see if all your crap gets lost or not... that's my only advice right now. i could maybe try messing around with it, so i'll let you know if i come up with the solution! but i agree -- we need a new look, y'all. betsy - true dat, yo. we're tight like that now, you me an' sue. it's kinda bizarre, you know? it's like we'r on one big giant blind date. i hope that when i actually meet you two face-to-face, cheek-to-cheek, lips-to-lips, that you won't be disappointed... i am ONE PATHETIC LOSER. *hi petey!* Oh, and about this weekend, even though i've always wanted to see you bend it like beckham, i probably wouldn't be able to if you play during the day since i've got my dad's b-day party to go to and another graduation/retirement/birthday party to go to. and since you can't go out @ nite, i guess that's out, too... maybe our first meeting will have to wait till the blogger get-together. but we'll see. now, onto me asking some questions that will make me look like a complete idiot: What's Kill Bill Vol. 1 and 2 and what are they all about?? How come I've never heard of them, except from you guys and everyone else on this campus saying that they are awesome?? Please give me the low-down. I'M RICK JAMES BITCH! What is this from?? Why does everyone say it and why am i so out of the loop?? Why does it have it's own entry on urbandictionary.com?? Please. I need your help on this one, y'all. I think I'm becoming a woman . Please let me know of things to expect as I blossom into womanhood. dena - you're supah sexuh. sue - come to boulder and i'll take you to Rhumba for the best f*ckin' mojitos you've never had!! we'll drink your sorrows away AND GET HIT ON BY HOT SEXY GUYS AT THE SAME TIME!! cause we're sexuh like that. jaime - shoutout! angela - nevermind, she won't read this anyway :( well, slackers, that's all for now. yeah, yeah, i know i promised a whole slew of shizznit in my last post, but i'm a slacker, too, so i'll hook you up with all that jazz whenever i get around to it. DEAL. loveyoumissyouwantyou! Heather

 HOLLA Hey yall...well I just saw (well, two hours ago) another excellent episode of the inferno. However, I missed last week's...why did Mike and Kendall get in a fight? Anyone? Sue sorry about your crying spell. At least you thought it was funny though. I had one of those last year. I still don't think it was funny at all. In fact, it was the worst night of my life and I hope that never happens again. Not only did I cry the entire night, but apparently I busted my shin somehow, broke my sculpture, and got blood all over my sheets...people thought it was period stains BUT I SWEAR IT WASN'T. I think I have an extraodinary talent for making a complete ass out of myself. Hope that makes you feel better. Anyway, I don't know why I got on such a tangent...Suzy men do suck. Actually people suck. Keep on studying sweetheart, then you'll make a ton of money and then you can tell them all to go to hell. Sorry I've been reading Gone With the Wind (excellent but you didn't need to hear that from me)...Scarlett says that a lot. Anyway, Sue I can't wait until you come home...bffff blogga reunion! In case you couldn't tell, I've really missed you lately. Heather, it takes a really long time to get to Houston from Oklahoma City, at least I think it does. But you should come anyway b/c it would be fun!! I think I'll be in Denver (and this is all dependent upon me making the travel team) on Saturday and Sunday. Yes Heather, let's have lipstick les sex! I'm all for it, except I'll have to stay with my team the whole time and be good and not go out. Lame. And unless you're really really into watching soccer, I wouldn't make the drive out to watch the games b/c they're not even that big of a deal. But Heather seriously, I feel like I've made friends with you throughout this whole blog process, yet I've never met you. And neither has Sue. We all need to come together. Good times. Dena, if I don't make the travel team for this weekend (I find out Wednesday) let's seriously go to Austin. Besides I told Katie I'd visit her sometime this summer, plus I've only been to Austin not for soccer like one time. I remember it being really fun, and I didn't even drink then. So I think the possibilities are endless. Also, when I was in Austin, it kinda reminded me of New Orleans a little bit...maybe it's b/c it's a city with a distinct culture. I love cities like that. I love Houston, but that is certainly something it does not have. Oh yeah, Shawna and Dena I'm going to call you tomorrow night. I didn't call you tonight b/c I wanted to spend time with my mom b/c she worked on mother's day. Do yall wanna see Kill Bill Vol. 2? Or have you already seen it? So I finally moved out of Martel today. I think Raffi was mad at me b/c I didn't show up to start moving our stuff out until 1, when we supposedly had to be out by 4 (turns out we had the whole night but I guess it's good that we got our shit out anyway). I was doing volunteer work this morning...I was helping out by cutting out circles that will be used by some artist from New York to put up in the Rice Art Gallery. I really wanted to do it b/c it's a great opportunity to start to build up my resume, plus ask important questions I need to know about what it takes to be an artist. Anyway, so when I got back, they had moved most of the furniture, and I was like you guys I told you to leave stuff for me to take so you wouldn't do it all by yourself. And then Raf gave me a look and said that she and Lauren had stuff to do and they've been there since...and then she trailed off and walked away. I guess I understand her being mad considering she's new to our room and may not know how in past years I've done more than my fair share of room moving, but you know what, sorry that my schedule doesn't coincide directly with hers. I have a life too. They didn't have to move the whole room out when I wasn't there. And besides, there actually was a ton of crap left behind that wasn't just mine, plus I had to move my huge ass TV which was hard enough. Good thing Marisa was cleaning the same time I was so she could help me out. Anyway, sorry for the story...it's fun to vent to people who couldn't possibly care about what I'm discussing. It's just funny b/c I think that's the first time all year Raffi's been mad at me. Oh well she'll cope. Yeah so I've been moving my crap all day. I'm strange. I guess I kinda forgot until I started actually looking at the stuff I own. Martel ran out of storage space so I'm using our locker room as my temporary storage. Oops! I hope Chris and Nicky don't walk in there and spaz out about my mound of crap. It should be out by the weekend anyway. Ok I'm really tired and I have work tomorrow...and now that I live in Spring I have to leave early to beat the damn traffic. Long day tomorrow. Leave me some good blogs girls!

 Heather, i was going to change the template but i didnt want all our stuff to be deleted that we added. Do you know how to do it without messing up our links n such? Oh yeah- dena/sue/betsy, remember caroline sanders? She ran CC at klein, she was a freshman i think when yall were seniors. Anyway i came across her poetry website a little while ago and briefly spoke with her through our comments. The link to her site is on our page so go check it out. holla

 HOLLA i can hardly believe it but i'm totally finished with school!! and that class that i should have failed... yeah, i got a C- which was the bare minimum that i needed to graduate! there's no way i deserved a C- since i got like a 31% on the final which was 40% of my final grade... just goes to show that visiting your prof during late-nite office hours really does pay off in the end!! **right shawna?!** that reminds me of a joke i heard recently: So this nasty slob of a guy pays Dena* $20 to do the nasty with him at The No-Tell Motel, and when she's done, she turns to him and says, "it was a business doing pleasure with you!" *names have NOT been changed. they are the ACTUAL names of the people involved in this story. jaime, you seriously need to send me the sexiest picture of yourself you can find. and betsy, you too since you bitch an' moan about the one on here now! LUV YOU GIRLFRIEND CALL ME! oh, and bets, i know i said i'd help you with your camera problems and i never did, but now i really will... you just have to tell me what kind of setup you got going on there. so yeah, my dad has been hounding me to help him run this motel thing this summer. i haven't decided yet, but if the florida sisters would jump on the bandwagon with me, that'd be AWESOME! we could hold a bffff retreat there and par-tay! haha! so, how far away is oklahoma city from houston?? my friend just moved to OKC and daniel and i might drive down to visit (10 hours away) and then we thought we'd swing on down to H-town, but i don't know if it's on the way or not. i guess i could mapquest it, but i'm too lazy right now. regardless, i'm almost positive that i'll be making a trip down to houston to see and/or MEET my sexy blog chicas!! Betsy, how long will you be in denver?! you realize that i'm only a 20-minute drive away, right?! maybe we could hook up while you're here for some lipstick lesbian love... yeah, i don't think the whole melissa being engaged thing is a secret. besides, g-ma knows, so even if it was supposed to be a secret, it'd be impossible to keep now! i am sooooo jealous that y'all have already seen NYM!! i can't wait to see it! maybe i'll go see it tonite! sue, you crazy drunk, you! sucks to be you sometimes... LOL LUV YOU GIRL LET'S HANG OUT THIS SUMMER!! Seriously, though, Sweetheart, we gotta meet this summer! How long will you be home?? coming up: PICTURES PICTURES AND MORE PICTURES!!! Drunk graduation stories. Other drunk stories. "Pearl Nekclaces" and a survey on if you've ever gotten one, and if so, do you like them. Videos of me and Rae receiving "Pearl Necklaces" woo hoo! (The SAMANTHA type of pearl necklaces, not the CHARLOTTE type, fyi...) alright losers, i'm out. -h.

 HOLLA! holla. holla holla holla. sooooooooooo, i had a nervous breakdown this weekend--it was actually quite funny other than the fact that i was completely pathetic. let me preface this sad sad story that my hormones are out of control and i am about to be on my period. so for three days i have been freaking out about my grades and i hate men (because thats what i do best) and the whole torture issue has been getting me really upset about the way my country is portrayed (especially when there are so many good people in the army--pat tillman for one--but thats a whole other rant) anyways---emotional sue is on a rampage and hasnt had more than a glass of wine in over a month (i hate school) anywho--i finally decide to go for a proper night out and have waaaaay too many margaritas--part of the reason it had such an effect was the fact i hadnt eaten anything all day--so i dont really remember dinner and i think i was doing body shots at the restaurant. whatever. i vaguley remember the ride home and liza, steve and i decide to throw rocks at peoples windows when we get home.my rocks werent getting anywhere so i decided to roll on the ground instead. so we are throwing rocks at this boy that i "met" two weeks ago (see blog from before). somehow i make it up to his room and i HAVE NO IDEA what was said but i feel like i we were talking and i got bored of talking and just walked away. somehow i got it in my head that he called me ugly (this week i had three different people tell me i was ugly and again thats a whole other story). so being the spastic that i am and being as drunk as i am i start bawling. dont worry, the boy wasnt there. liza runs up to find me bawling in the corner. she takes me back to my room and i throw myself on the floor and cry more and yell at liza to go have sex with her boy toy. she is hysterically laughing because i am mumbling something about hating men and how she should go rape duncan (her boy). finally i get out of my room, crawl up to my bed, wail some more and then i realize how retarded i am and start hysterically laughing. i made such a scene laughing that my flat mates practically tore down the door to make sure that i am not having an epilectic seizre. as soon as they, the evil sex, walk in, i stop laghing, tell them i hate them and all of their kind and start bawling. one of them has no idea what to do and politley excuses himself. marcello, the best ever, picks my lame ass up and gets me drinking more and tells me that men and most people suck. it was nice. so all in all, i had a mental breakdown and the worst part is--i dont remember most of it so i have no idea what happened. oops. lesson learned--dont pent up your feelings especially when you PMSing and go out drinking--and eat if you are going to drink. it was really funny actually--i think im quite funny when i am emotional. stupid, but funny. ok, i have mch more to say but again, i have to study...blah i get to see you jokers soon~! betsy--good luck this weekend out

 WOAH! I hate change... BLOGGER.COM CHANGED OVERNIGHT and now I dont know what to do with myself?!?!?!?! Anyway this will be short seeing that my bloggas are slacking on me i must punish with short story blogs. My Review on New York Minute: "Four Thumbs Up" -Shawna Florida Pretty much, I liked it ALOT. There was a scene for everybody in this film, including rich snobby women. By far the best Olsen Twin Movie yet.... but I still love the others.... this one just made me laugh more (and the fashion show was shorter) .... Those twins and their fashion shows. Oh yeah, the guys were a lot less cheesy, well except for blondie.. but he wasnt in the movie too much. Anyway, go see it. OK well this is my punishment. HOLLA

 HOLLA......I JUST WANTED TO SAY HOLLLLLA to all my bloggas out there. haha. sorry it has taken so long to get on here...shawna hogs the computer so i don't ever get a chance to write. JERK. well, anyways...jaime, email a picture of yourself to me and i'll send it to heather so she can put it on the site....ALRIGHT? have you gone running yet? i haven't....i haven't worked out at all since we ran last thursday....oops. how's valpo treating you? heather....CONGRATS GRAD!! stay sweet....call me over the summer~!! haha...seriously...i think we're going to be in colorado sometime in july! and we might be planning a ski vacation there this christmas....it's been a long time since last time we did that. oh, i talked to gma yesterday and she told ME happy mother's day. what? am i a mother? well, apparently gma says so. i don't know if melissa was telling everyone about her engagement but i told sara yesterday so i hope it wasn't supposed to be some kind of secret...i don't know why it would be...but if it was....sorry. oh yeah, and i hear your dad needs managers for the 'hotel'...by the cabin. gma was saying me you and shawna should go run it..haha....how funny would that be...us three living at the cabin...making some money running a hotel. RANDOM. betsy....you're coming to k-town soon right! today?! well, hey, i'll go to austin w/ you....you know like our random trip to new orleans....ROAD TRIP...WOOOO! that was fun. we should go to new orleans again soon too....seriously....sara's going soon...maybe we could hitch a ride w/ her. but i bet if we go to austin we'll get free food and drinks...katie's rich....she'll pay for us. margarita machine!! yeah buddy. jaime, yeah, i skipped out on new orleans cuz we ended up driving straight through w/out stops so we were like zombies when we got home...seriously i was going CRAZY. it was funny cuz in southern indiana, we drove through amish country and there were yellow signs saying--horse and buggy crossing---haha....it was funny. and we drove through a town called TOOLOOGEE. haha...i tried to find a huge sign and get a pic. by it...but there just weren't any. oh well. New York Minute movie REVEIW: best parts: -when they're naked in the dumpster and slide out sideways...watch the dog....it's hillarious...you'll know what i'm talking about -when they're in towels in the hotel room and the senator's son comes in and sees them in slow motion flipping they're hair...we know the hair flip very well!! -the white guy who thinks he's chinese---WEIRD worst parts: -the fact that the chinese ppl were using a chip to illegally sell unreleased songs and movies....that is the lamest conflict EVER. -the fashion show (it's expected in an OT movie) -that i enjoyed watching it so anyways, i guess that's about all i have to say...sooooo i'll talk to you all lata. dena

 HOLLA Yeah so I tried to blog earlier but blogger.com was in the middle of some update and it ruined my life. Last night I had the pleasure of seeing New York Minute with Dena, Shawna, and Angela (you're still dead to me). Here is my review: Riveting. Mentally, emotionally, and spiritually enlightening. But seriously, it was a movie that I hated to love. And I love it! How can you not love the Olsen twins, excuse me, Mary Kate and Ashley. Obviously the movie was bad...stupid plot, bad acting, pointless and improbable fashion shows... but it's addictive and entertaining, thus making it awesome. And I love how they're barely eighteen yet they have single, make that double-handedly, taken over the world. My knee is on fire. Inferno is on tomorrow yay!!! At least my life doesn't revolve around television... I can't figure out who's writing in the little box on the side but who cares it just adds to the fun. But Shawna it wasn't me using an alias...Dena it's you isn't it. ISN'T IT??? Katie wants me to come visit her in Austin at some point this week. I said I'll try but it's highly unlikely considering my summer workouts start tomorrow and I just have a million other things to do. Anyone feel like taking a road trip if you and I both have free time? I'm going to Denver this weekend with the Houston Stars. Well, hopefully. That is if asshole Luis doesn't ruin my life and stick me back on the B team so I won't get to travel. I don't think he will but I don't trust him. But whatever happens, I don't really care that much. The point of it is to get good training for next fall, which I will be getting regardless. Ok I have nothing else to say. I should be packing but instead I'm going to waste my life away on the internet.

 hi dee ho neighboreenos... Just got back from a PHENOMENAL movie.... NEW YORK MINUTE. OMG GIRLFRIENDS.... If you have not seen it..go do it.. NOW. Me Bets and Angie had our own little bfff blogga party at the movies.... we are each going to give a review of the new MK and A movie.... that is soon to come. For now... i need to just reflect on the movie and take it all in. LOL LYLAS. Anyway, So last night I stayed at Mike's cousins loft downtown... we were house-sitting for him while he is out of town.... ummmmmm yeah. It was an ODD experience and Ill just say that being there made me feel dirty. Mike and I wont be going back there any time soon. Dena and Los came too..... they know..they were there. I will just leave it at that. They have a pitbull which pee's rivers...no joke.. i seriously cleaned up that "puppies" pee with a whole roll of paper towels. It is crazy and reafirrmed my beliefs on why small wimpy dogs are soo much better. This dog was totally ADHD, and humped you like no other. It wrapped its paws around you leg and wouldnt let go.... at first when we all got there we were like..."awww he is soo cute' but after about 3 minutes you are like 'Get the F*** off me' and you will be pushing that thing off you. IF only you could see Carlos do this... it was by far an image that will forever stick in my head. Bleaux (the dog) starts humping him... and after several attemps of him trying to get him off he finally gets fed up and just SHOVES bleaux across the room. THe dog FLIPS over BACKWARD and lands on a plant.... it was soo funny. I laughed. A lot. Besides the humping "puppy" and the dirty feeling i recieved .... it was fun... we walked to Hard Rock Cafe and ate dinner there. It was enjoyable when Grease's "summer Lovin" came on and everybody there sang, including myself. It was a good time. Last night i had to study my ass off for my algebra final, I had it this morning at 9 am.... and i thought i did alright. But when i got home i realized that i made a bunch of stupid mistakes...... I always do that on math tests..... So i hope i passed. I really need to pass that class! I think i might email my prof and ask him for some extra credit or something.... *wink Wink.... heather knows what im talkin about. Hahha. LOL SISTA. Ok well I will write more of our adventures at the "ghetto" Willowbrook AMC 24 and New York Minute review is soon to come. BUT yall really need to get on top of this whole bloggin thing....There is no excuse for the lack of Blove! (Blove; Blog Love.... a word made up by me....so use it and LIKE IT). HOLLA

 HOLLA Yeah I heard about Court. That is really horrible. It's weird when someone you were acquaintances with dies...it's like you aren't devastated but you knew them well enough for the whole situation to be really disturbing. It reminds you how fragile life really is and how we could go at any moment. It sucks b/c I didn't know him that well, but I knew that he was a really nice, charming guy. I feel awful for his family. So let's move on to something lighter, shall we? How about my disgusting knee. Well Nicky (coach) kinda freaked me out b/c she said she saw something on the news about how people are getting these gross bumps on their faces and stuff that looked like what was (and still is) on my knee. She said to go the trainer and get it checked out. So I did and they scheduled a doctor's appt. hold on gotta pee...and I went this morning; all I have are inflamed hair follicles, no big deal. But now they're growing in number and spreading and it's kinda painful to walk, so I think I might get the "just in case" prescription the doctor gave me filled. I figured that's probably the best idea. Neat. So I had practice yesterday...it was over three hours long. And naturally, it ran during the final episode of Friends. It's ok though b/c practice was fun even though it lasted for an eternity. And Luis is slightly less of an asshole b/c he bumped me up to the A team. This weekend we play this team from Utah...they won the league championship and they have about a million and five WUSA players on their team. Should be fun. But it's ok b/c I'd rather play really hard teams and get my ass kicked than nothing at all, b/c it'll be good training for next fall so we can WIN THE WAC!!! I'm starting to get WAC fever... Well tonight I went to talk to a middle school about drive and motivation. The coaches were originally asked to do it but they were busy/have no public speaking skills, so Chris asked me to do it b/c I love talking to large groups of people. It's seriously fun, everyone should try it. Except this time, I totally didn't prepare anything I was gonna say...I totally got up there and talked out of my ass. Fortunately, it was this tiny school's sports banquet and it was really informal, so it was actually fitting for me to make an impromptu, informal speech. For the most part, it was well received (I think...). Ok, I'm kinda tired. I'm supposed to go to Pub tonight, but I'm starting to rethink it. There's only so much social interaction I can take before I start to short circuit. We'll see.

 All you klein grads, I just found out that urlLink Court Tullier was killed wednesday.... I only talked to him a few times and barely knew him but it is still sad, just wanted to inform yall.

 HOLLA Shawna, so i put on a tutu and danced to 'Like a Virgin' and it definitely worked. Thanks for the advice!

 HOLLA ya'll Dena - i am missing you already! Glad you made it safe to Texas...did you not go to New Orleans? Why not? I really don't know what I will do w/out you...who am I going to run w/? who am I going to eat pasta with? who am i going to dye my hair with? Who am I going to swim w/? Who am I going to talk to a lot of random boys with? who am i going to study with on the floor at barnes and noble? or study with in the wind at bryan park? NOBODY! Maybe I can come to TX. I wish I was in TX right now. But it is sunny here...I just got back from laying out...I can see the tanness already. It looks hot. Right now I'm waiting for this cd to burn at the station, WFHB (the radio station I work at)...i'm making copies of me broadcasting the news because yesterday was my last day. The cd burner is SOOOO slow :( Shawna, when do you turn 21? i'm not 21 yet either - it sux...and i'm too much of a chicken to use a fake ID...but i did once...and didn't get caught...but i didn't know that you could go to jail for that and now i do so i lost my courage. BUT i do turn 21 on May 27 - very soon!!! Anyway, i'll go check on that cd... MMMMMMMmmmm HMmmmmmmmm

 dena just called... she will be home in FIVE MINUTES !! GOOD BYE. HOLLA

 not sue...as of the moment i am nerdy plus loser. all i do is study. scratch that. all i do is study sleep and drink. and then whatever off time i DO have i am running or playing soccer with 12 year olds and kicking their ass because, really, they should learn the ways of the world and how no one is going to give them a break. i am super cool though. at least thats what i keep telling myself. when i go to the pubs i tell people that they want to hang out with me but that i am too cool and that they should be so lucky. sure, its a little self inflated but so am i. theyll get over it. i have mad chafing. it really hurts. also, i want to sleep. bah! honestly people--if i dont get a first (A) on my exams i am going to jump out of a window. really. it might be a first floor window but jumping there will be. and for the news of the day--your little suzy is coming home. i think i will be coming home for ten days around the 30th of may. shawna you wont be 21 but everyone else will--you can be designated driver. no. i lie. you are the worst driver ever. i will drive. your car. drunk. and probably drive better than you. JK LOL STAY SWEET. no but really the point is --ill be home for a little bit and i havent felt warmth in a really long time so everything we do will be outside and we will ALL see each other or i will kick some ass. massive ass. heather, youre invited. besty--they did that whole lets cut athletics think at tulane last year--its a crock. tell them to lick your clit/ they wont cut you or make you D3---schools neeeeed athletics--i hate athletics (re: besty anderson and the horrible tulane administration)but its good publicity and schools like publicity. im out--i cant think straight. (and you knew this one was coming...neither can betsy...harharharhar)

 HOLLA I haven't gotten drunk (I mean I've drank, but haven't gotten DRUNK) in a long time. I did last night...and it was boring. I swear I've turned 21 and somehow drinking got boring. I was bored the whole night. BORED! Ok I don't really have anything to say except hi Jaime! You can replace Angela; she is dead to me. DEAD! Ok bye.

 1998 -THE YEAR THAT I WAS NOT A GIRL BUT NOT YET A WOMAN. damn i missed my birthday on the counter so i had to celebrate '98 ... a crappy year if you ask me. this was the year before i actually BECAME A WOMAN.. if you know what i mean... wink wink dena. (remember good ole aunty flo?) Anyway i would like to start out with a thank you to all you Obsessive Compulsive bloggers. Unfortunately i was camping all weekend and then when i got back I had 2 finals/a Sports Banquet and a shopping trip... sadly this took up all my blog time. welcome jaime... i think the best way to distract him is to dress up in a yellow tutu and dance to 'Like a Virgin' by Madonna... works EVERY time!'' I AM BAD AT EXPENSIVES. Let me explain..... Whenever i was on crutches from the knee surgery i couldnt carry stuff because obviously i had no hands to use... so one time i had a drink and i needed to go up the stairs. SO i came up with the bright idea of putting my drink in my backpack purse... (those ARE back in style in case you were wondering... haha) anyway so i had my IPOD, Cell Phone and Digital Camera in there.... well after i took one 'crutch step' the drink tips over. My cell phone and IPOD are ruined and no longer work.... Luckily i did not pay for either of them but they broke and that sucks. THEN my DVD player (which was also free...) broke, THEN my lap top batter charger broke and i had to buy another for 85 bucks.... THEN about 3 days later my lap top BROKE... yes the SECOND LAP TOP... (my first one broke about a year ago) ....well i added all this stuff together and in total i have had $4500 of electronics break on me in the past 2 years!!!! Thats not including the Two VW Beetles i wrecked ... but those arent electronics.....my point is DONT BUY ME EXPENSIVE STUFF! Or if you do get a warranty on it because odds are it will break. Let me tell you about my camping trip. Dena Aunt Flo came along... but she was kinda annoying. (ps you will NEVER live that down). So friday I am at home waiting for sara to call me to pick me up for the camping trip.... i am actually trying to fix my lap top at the time. Well my cell phone rings (its sara) so i pick it up but all i hear is heavy breathing sounds... so i thought maybe sara was "gettin it on" and she accidentally rolled over on the phone...so i said hello REALLY loud and kinda laughed and hung up because i was a bit grossed out. SO then she calls back, this time i hear her trying to say something... but the phone is really fuzzy and it sounds like she is whispering... actually it sounded like a horror movie voice. I kinda freaked out and hung up because i just thought the phone was messed up. SO i call back...no answer. Then i get a voicemail and listen and it sounds the same.... This point im getting scared. SO then she calls back and it sounded like she was gasping for breath and saying "Shawna, help me... can you hear me...shawna im dying" SO i was REALLY freaking out... i started having an anxiety attack and i was seriously CRYING. I was yelling in the phone "Sara ..where are you.. i cant hear you...sara are you ok" but i just kept hearing the horror movie voice but i could tell it was sara. SO the phone loses its signal and im still crying and freaking out. So i call mike and tell him to come over then i call my dad and ask him to call her and find out whats wrong... i was literally shaking and crying for like 10 minutes! I kept think sara either got in a car accident or was stabbed by someone...seriously this is what i was thinking! Finally i run out of my apartment bc i was there all alone and scared but adam (her boyfriend) called me and told me she was waiting for me outside. App. her phone is just messed up so everything she says sounds like that. She was really saying "Shawna, hello, can you hear me... im outside" ..... adam said when he called he heard the same weird voice. It was so freaky. Actually every time i think about it i get chills... i have never freaked out that much in my life. I seriously heard "Shawna im dying... help me... shawna help me" .... definitley horror movie material!!! Now i feel so stupid because when i went out to meet sara my eyes were all red from the crying.. she was just like 'whats wrong?!!' .... anyway so that was the beginning of my weekend.... then we left for enchanted rock. We were halfway there when we realized we needed to stop at wal-mart to get an extra sleeping mat.... well in texas you can find a wal-mart every other block.... but for some reason we couldnt find one anywhere... so we decided just to wait till we went through austin. We finally got there and ended up driving in a big circle.. NEVER seeing ONE wal-mart. (It was about 12:30 am so nothing else was open) ...so we gave up after about an hour.... and just kept driving. As soon as we leave austin i look to my left and there it is... Wal-Mart sitting up on this hill sticking out like a sore thumb. Then we also drove by another one that was only 5 minutes from out campsite. Oh yeah...while i was at walmart thi weirdo came up to me and told me he liked my tan.... I DONT HAVE A TAN.... in fact i am not even tan enough to be white... im clear. He also told me he wanted to be tan like me... (fyi: he was black)..... those austin folk are crazy. Ok back to camping...so we get there at 1:30 am.... and someone stole our camping spot that we reserved...so in the pitch black we had to find another one. We finally found one and set up. We get in our tents and as soon as i zip up my tent it started HURRICANING..... seriously it was like flash flood warning and what not. It was crazy. SO then it rained all morning but finally stopped when i woke up. It was FREEZING. i packed nothing but tank tops and shorts because i figured it was going to be hot...seeing that it was 90 degrees when i left houston. Nope.... it was in the 40s and i had like on pair of pants and one long sleeve jacket (it was a very light jacket). It was cold. I hate cold. But that day we hiked up the rocks and everything ...it was pretty fun, even though we climbed and climbed and my knee hurt like a bitch... it was cool anyway. We also ate lunch by a spot where two people were rock climbing. We thought it was a girl so we kept saying "she" ....we found out later it was just a man with pretty legs. Oops. That night me mike and adam spent a couple hours trying to start a damn fire. The logs we had were damp from the rain so it took forever. Adam was wideling away while mike kept on throwin in matches..... finally i had a bright idea. I walked to the campsite below us and stole their 'still burning' firewood and threw it in our pile. The fire started about 2minutes later.... hey whatever works. But that night adam made steaks (mine was still alive therefor i did not eat it) and we decided to see what types of foods burn quicker. We found out that twinkies DONT BURN.... the outside of the twinking get charred but the cream filling... it never melts or anything... it was still there!!! It was crazy ... we decided that we should insulate houses with twinkie cream filling in order to prevent house fires. NOt only can it save you from fire.. but it tastes good too! A lot more things happened while camping but that was the jist..... all in all it was fun. (besides the blistering cold and the asswipes in the camp by us who felt the need to make noise all night). Oh yeah and our steak was marinated in rum and beer. So i just sucked on mine (since it was almost RAW) and then spit it in the fire. Monday I woke up and had to go take a sociology final.... i think i did 'alright' .. but i never can tell if i do well or not. I know i passed at least. Then i drove back to klein and mike and I went to Olive Garden with my mom. MMMM MMM MMM. Bread sticks. Then we went to the mall to shop because i had my UH All-Sports Banquet at 6:30. I bought a little black dress from forever 21...its cute. I will put pictures up sometime. I actually ended up shopping for everythign i needed in less than an hour... and spent only 65$ on a dress, shoes, a necklace and a NEW bra ... mike was impressed. So i got back from that at 3:15 but had to shower still and had another final at 5:30 downtown. SO i had to haul ass and get ready for my banquet in 20 minutes so i could drive downtown to make it to my final on time..... We left my house at 4:00 but got stuck in traffic. My final was an "in-class" essay about women's inequalities in the workforce. Well since i was running late i started writing the essay in the car. And finally showed up at 5:45 .... and had to be at my Banquet at 6:30. So i wrote the rest of my FOURTEEN PAGE essay in 15 minutes... and turned it in. I got to my banquet at 6:30 on the dot. I was then awarded MVP for Cross Country.... thank you thank you..... we were given glass candlestick holders that were engraved with MVP. Well my candlestick holder was HALF the size of all the other MVP's!!!! (this was the ALL sports banquet so there were multiple mvp's) ...... I have not figured out why everyone else got normal size candlestick holders and I got a midget one..... maybe its because im short. That must be why. Yesterday as i was cleaning out my car i found one of the pages of my essay in the car!!!! That essay about women's rights in the workforce...yeah well app. i only turned in THIRTEEN pages bc one of the pages was just sitting there in my car. SO my prof might be a little confused as she reads my paper and it skips from immigrant workers in the 30's to modern day women in the workforce..... haha. OOPS. Oh well... i dont care enough to worry about it. Yesterday i went to briannas (lil sis) softball game. I have heard my parents brag about how good she is at pitching...so finally i went to a game. Man she has pitching down. She has all this power and KNOWS HOW TO DO A CHANGE-UP!! She is only 12....its crazy. Yall have to see it. You dont expect it coming. Hopefully she doesnt become a lesbian softball player with multi-cankles. Her team lost the game but she claims SHE didnt lose because she played well. I made sure to shoot down any pride she had by reminding her that the pitcher is the one who carries the loss. anyway i inspired mike to make a blog. His is more of a runnign log type of thing but if you want go to it. www.runtoday.blogspot.com ... its new so not too interesting yet. Oh yeah...tonight i went to watch mike run a race at the park. It was a huge deal today ...about 150 people were there. After the race there was beer. Well I had mikes hacky sack so old men (30 yr old and up) started joining the circle to play. There were six of us tryin to hack together but the men kept drinking beer and eventually were drunk. Theres nothing funnier than drunk old men trying to play hacky sack...... whenever they would get the hacky sack in the nuts they called it a "dick ball" and then would proceed to laugh uncontrollably... it was quite entertaining. ok well this is the longest blog known to man. Reallly it is. Man told me. j Heather: CONGRATS GRAD! have you gotten any greeting cards yet with a picture of rats wearing caps n gowns doing the conga? (and it says CONGA RATS) .... yeah those are the best cards. also tell pezh to suck my butt! What a jerk. Betsy: spiders are healthy....just look on the bright side, they kill mosquitos so any lingering mosquitos in your intestines are probably being killed. I heard about the rice thing a couple weeks ago from my coach... i feel bad for you but we (us UHers) are kinda happy because that means if yall dont have athletics we might get all your good athletes... But i doubt anything will happen. Its just gossip. Also i was thinking about baseball and remember when we used to go to those astros games all the time a couple summers ago? Well remember when that beach ball was being passed around the crowd and it got to you and you knocked it on the baseball feild and everyone booed you...that was funny. Sue:for reals...you need to get back to your funny/long/sexy blogs... where you at ho!?!? Dena: Aunt flo. Angela: your a loser Jaime: shout out. we all need to hit up the astros games this summer!!! LOL SISTAS CALL ME THIS SUMMER STAY SWEET!!! HOLLA

 HOLLA--why the hell do i think its a good idea to wake up 545 so i can run. i think i mst sleep and take crack at the same time. this is stupid. why wake up early. i dont have to--i could sleep until late...i dont have class for a while. well i am trooper thats why. i actually have to go but i do have to tell you how cool i am--i had a cinco de mayo party last nigth and made margaritas last from scratch and they turned out soooo good--i mst be an electronic bartender. weel there are a lot of mexicans in my my dorm and they said that they dont celebrate 5 may so i told them that they were lame and coulndt have my margaritas. ha. who doesnt celebrate a day where their country kicked frances ass? im sure the germans would if they had a won a war in the past century. war is cool. censorship is awesome. and i have a rash on my neck from going to be sweaty--from working out not from sexing. out

 HOLLA i have been studying for too long!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 2 hours is enough for me. i'm unmotivated...and bored...and zac's sitting here studying and i'm trying to distract him but it's not working. any distraction tips? *Jaime

 HOLLA so this is my first entry...how exciting :) i am now officially a blogger! i don't know all of you, but i've read quite a bit of what you have written, so i kinda feel like i know you. anyway, i used to run w/ shawna and dena at valpo...and now i run w/ dena at iu. and, of course, me and mary-kate and ashley are tight. by the way, there's a guy here who has a huge banner on the front of his house counting down the days 'till the olsens turn 18!!! that's great. *jaime

 HOLLA 1983...I think it's year of the dog! Ruff. I think Mandy Moore was born in '83. And best of all, I was born in '83. toodles I'm gonna go get shitty and write yall a wonderful blog!

 our counter is @ 1981, y'all, which is when i was born... HOLLA 1981, YEAR OF THE COCK! DEBUT YEAR OF MTV (as well as yours truly), and "ENDLESS LOVE" was #1 on the charts!! Oooooh, yeeeaaaah, baby! you all have to give a shout out when the counter hits the year of your birth, aiiiiight?! off to get my emissions test and new license plates... blah. h.

 HOLLA shut up Sue they're close enough...and you know what? I haven't consciously killed any spiders so if I've eaten them, it doesn't count! So ha!

 if ive told you one time, ive told you 8,349 times. cetenary, not rice, is the smallest division I school

 HOLLA Yeah I'm not sure what's going on, but I think there's a spider that lives in my bed or something. I have had five spider bites on my left knee...that's the only place too, my left knee. You know how it is statistically thought that the average human swallows approximately seven spiders in his or her lifetime? Well I think in the past week I've probably swallowed twenty. Hey, it's free food. Maybe there's a spider family in my room. Anyway... I've been having really weird dreams lately. Well not that many, but I had one where I was drowning and I knew I was in a dream and I was trying to wake up but I couldn't. So I was just suffocating until finally I woke up. Perhaps I have sleep apnea. One time I had a dream that my assistant coach, Nicky, was wearing this hilarious chicken suit and she was handing out chicken hats to people on our team. That dream ruled. Sue, that's better. So tell us about the hook up! Shawna where the hell are you? School schmool. I had practice today. Soccer is fun. I love taking two or three week breaks from soccer and doing something else like swimming b/c when you come back to soccer, you remember how much fun it is. Right now Rice is debating on whether to keep athletics or not. There are different options: 1. Totally get rid of athletics. 2. Move us down to D-3. 3. Get rid of the football team. 4. I don't remember the other option. This is the annoying thing about Rice. Every year--and it never fails--some asshole bitches complain about how we need to get rid of athletics b/c it wastes money and it brings down the academic level at Rice. Now I understand their frustration to a degree, and I could go on and on with arguments but I don't feel like it. It's just annoying as hell b/c no matter what we accomplish, they'll never leave us alone. Shit, the baseball team just won a national championship. The Barker twins (tennis) just won a national championship. We have people in track who are going to the olympics. Shit, our team, in only three years of existence, managed to come within fifty-six seconds of beating a team that is frequently nationally ranked to win the conference championship, and we will certainly win it next year. We rank as some of the most academically sound student athletes in the country. We are the smallest D1 school in the country yet we consistently produce results on and off the field. And every fucking year, we still get terrorized. Whatever they decide won't affect me, or my class, but if they take away soccer or move it down to D3 for future classes, I'll be devastated. Belonging to the first class for women's soccer makes my relationship to the program really deep. It's seriously everything to me. Christ, I haven't taken almost every recruit since freshman year and shamelessly kissed their asses for the hell of it. I want to have the best players come here so when I leave the team will be better, and not remain stagnant or get worse. Anyway, I know all the girls have put so much of themselves into our team...it would really be a shame if it was taken away, or moved down to D3. Ok enough about that... I'm starving. I ate some pistachios but I'm still hungry. But I'm also tired and I don't feel like going anywhere. Pistachios make me gassy. I'm gonna go to bed now and get bit by some more spiders. Goodnight everyone! Oh and Heather, the older brother is cute...but his trucker hat is douchey.

 HOLLA It's true...I did IM Sue bitching at her about not blogging. And then what do you know, I've turned into a dead beat blogger. But I'm back and better than ever. So here we go... I'm gonna be banking by the end of this week. Not really, but I'm making money b/c I'm driving Meredith, the girl I babysat during one of the Rice camps, back from volleyball camp every day. It's right off 249...so it's basically the drive I make to Rice every day anyway. Plus I'm working at Soccer 4 All every day too. I know, this is fascinating... Speaking of the Gay Pride Parade...it ruled! It was so much fun. It was Mardi Gras (not nearly as cool as Mardi Gras though) but gay. There were bubbles everywhere. Lauren told me that there's nothing gayer than bubbles. I agree. Shawna I really hope you move to the Montrose area. I will come visit you all the time. The Montrose area rules b/c it's so vibrant and interesting. Plus there's great shopping. Heather if you ever come to Houston again, we all gotta go shopping in the Montrose area. And get our hair done. Man I need to go to Montrose...haven't been in a while. I really want to go antique shopping. Just saw the last episode of Real World. I thought San Diego was a good one, I really did. Personally, I thought Cameran made the show. She was hilarious. Ok I'm obviously bored. This blog is bad. Shocking. I think I might be developing a lesbian crush...I won't go into it, even though you're probably dying to know...sike! Review time!! I saw two rented movies tonight. The first one is Bad Santa. I actually wanted to see this in the theaters but for some reason I never got around to it. It was great. It was actually lighthearted, but in a very sick way. My kind of movie. Not deep really, but not supposed to be either. I wholeheartedly recommend it. The second movie I saw was an independent film called Melvin Goes to Dinner. I was extremely impressed. It's basically just a group of four people talking for two hours. It's such a boring premise, but I was not bored for a second. At any rate, I think all of yall should go out and rent it. So I've been researching this whole study abroad thing. Florence is looking like a really good option as of now. How awesome would that be? To be surrounded by all that history, beauty, and vibrance. To be able to make art in a place like that. We'll just have to see though... Ok, I'm starting to get tired so I'm gonna hit the sack. And by sack I mean the living room couch b/c I haven't slept in my own bed once this whole summer. Goodnight girls...I miss yall so much.

 Hey yall i think i screwed up our COMMENTS when i was trying to make the words more appealing... I replace Comment with SEX and 'Post a Comment' with "Hit me baby one more time" ... but now you cant comment.... heather...anyone .... help? If you know how fix it for me because im not as good at HTML as i thought i was. HOLLA

 AYE! Wut up homie g funks. HOW YOU BE? Im in a strange mood... lack of sleep most likely the problem here, but oh well. Work is going well i supposed. Work is work.. i dont think it EVER really goes well.. but its there and you make money and there you go. Im just exhausted. I have yet to go to bed before 2 am yet and houston traffic is horrific so i have to leave at 6:30 am. It sucks really really really bad. Especially when you take the HOV lane to work and there is more traffic in the HOV lane! SO frusturating. Mondays thru thursdays i have to go to school straight from work... its hard. I cant stay awake for 2 hours of chemistry after sitting in front of a computer all morning. This morning my boss gave me a mixed berry granola bar... and i remember why i dont eat healthy snacks. They taste like shit. Maybe i will get a heart attack when im old and lardy but at least my meals go down with ease and pleasure. So i worked out yesterday... i dont know if it really is considered working out... i just lifeted weights and ran a mile. I hate weight lifting... it doesnt do anything for me. The only thing i get out of it is sore muscles. Plus i lift weights one day and then dont do it again for another year. So this was my annual weight lifting event. It was great. When i got in my FIRST accident back in september i had this huge bubble /scar/ gash/ bruise thing on my wrist. The airbag hit my wrist and i really should have gone to the hospital to check it out but i didnt want to make the effort. Anyway since then i have had this hard bump on my wrist that sticks out. Today one of the trainers informed me becuase i probably fractured it and never fixed it... calcium built up and an extra bone grew there. Thats exciting... i have more bones than you... i think you are more than jealous. Anyway someone can help me name this so-called bone of mine.... i cant think of any good medical sounding names. For now i will call it "boner", because we all know how us bloggas like to make sexual references out of every situation. Boner hurts right now because the trainer decided to push on it to figure out what it was, ever since then my boner has swelled up and been throbbing... must be all the blood rushing to it. Hahaha i love being dirty. Ok enough of that. Summer school is done friday. Im so excited.... i cant stand school... i am so tired of it. Too bad im a loser who has to go 3 more years. Stupid track and the damn 5 year eligibility. Oh well more time for me to avoid being independent. Sorry bout your luck heather. Too back you have to go into the real world. Or just live in ebay fantasy land. I think it works. Saturday my whole family (NIL kevin obviously)went house hunting. Sara and I are getting a house together since i have offically been rejected from my on-campus housing. Thanks UH for all your love and support. Anyway, the house we went to look at is in the Montrose area, which really is a nice area but it is widely known as the land of homosexuals. Now dont get me wrong, i am not against anyone who chooses to swing other ways, but Saturday just happened to be the "Gay Pride Parade" on MONTROSE. Yeah... so this wouldnt be a big deal if we weren't having a family day trip in the mini van with the rentals and the 12 year old sis who decided to say "Why does everything say "Got Lube?" on it?" Yeah not uncomfortable AT ALL. It was worse that the rents were so oblivious to the whole thing. My mom saw the floats and she got excited 'OOOOH there must be a festival today!!" haha i proceeded to explain to her what was going on. Then my dad got uncomfortable and started trying to get off the street quickly. It was funny though. Anyway so we went at found a house that is AMAZING. Seriously amazing. It is a 3-story townhome with bay windows lots of light.... it it has a garage... i cant really describe it but it looks like one of those awesome apartments people always have in sitcoms ... but more of a home...and 3 stories. Anyway my room would be 1st floor and saras on the 3rd so lots of privacy. Anyway hopefully we get it. The only problem was it had water damage. So we are waiting to see if it is going to cost a fortune. THe house itself is pretty cheap for the area but if they dont include all the mainentance in the price it might be too expensive. Anyway, I am going to bed now because i have to be a nerd like sue now that I have a job and go to bed early. DAMN. But Ill try and post at work tomorrow. Now I have a HUGE desk in a room all by myself. Its nice, but i have a lot of work to do so me blogging is unlikely. holla!

 HOLLA waaaaait for it...im watching a commerical with the most beautiful man swimming and i cant take my eyes of the screen. oooooook, commercial over, i can write to my bloggers tomorrow. yesterday i got an IM from my bfffff betsy telling me to blog and i answer this request with one simple statement--SCOREBOARD! check the blog--i have the last two blogs. lets see some blogging from you ms huete.hmmm? i am super excited--i am moving all my stuff into the new house today. its sooo kick ass and i am going to be living with marcello from brasilla (who is the most amazing cook) and liza from america (who cannot cook). i am soo excited to be getting out of this shit hole. my boob is really swollen and i dont know why. odd...and its just the left one and its HUGE--like how denas boobs look in heathers bras. HUGE. i am watching cricked right now so i must be really really bored. really. i am cold. i am going to shower. ill talk to you hoes later. out

 HOLLA....yes, i think i had the best dinner EVER tonight. went w/ los to have dinner....best steak ever (coming from someone who doesn't really like steak), green been casarole was AMAZING (coming from someone who doesn't like green beans)....rolls, potatoes, zucchini baked thing....all SOOO GOOD. oh, and who can forget the wine....LOTS OF WINE. that's why i'm blogging like this. yes i'm a little tipsy right now...like sue! woo hoo. heather i am pretty jealous of your comp....i have a lame computer..it's not a laptop....which i totally should have gotten. eh.....i'll buy a good one when the time is necessary (actually my computer's not bad at all, but it's not as cool as heather's). oh, i'm gonna try and post the penis pics. in a minute...so i'll blog later. d

 HOLLA kids i have been sper busy with mummy here and with trying to get this whole house situation sorted but the good news is that i have solved all of our problems for the time being. immediatly go to cafepress.com and see how we can START out tshirt company. once we get profits we can then make 1. our own website and 2. more money when we get to buy our own press and tshirts. ok, i have a lot to say but frankly i am a little to tipsy and about to go break the law. ill talk to you hoes later--im reading a NEW book and i finished carlos book and i think i am now a grail enthusiast. woohoo. i am nerd.loser. out. i have a great "take" on pop music and shakespeare coming soon

 HOLLA So, remember the laptop that i got right before coming to H-town, and the plan was to bring it with me so i could still do all my work while i was there, but then it's battery wouldn't charge so i couldn't bring it? yeah, well it works afterall. all it needed was a new adapter! well wireless is amazing because i can take my laptop downtown, or to Pearl Street, or to Starbucks, or to the venue where my boyfriend is playing a show (as in RIGHT NOW), and i can STILL be ONLINE! so i can blog, and do my work, etc while i listen to some sexy music!! and eat pizza! and drink beer! it's awesome. thank God for Intel Centrino! and what's even better is that since i was already planning on returning this one cause i thought it was BROKEN, i ordered the laptop of my DREAMS that's gonna be even more pimped out! and then i'll be the envy of the city... or at least of the blog (not that i'm not ALREADY! right guys? guys?) okay, enough tech talk... i really just wanted to brag at how pimp my setup is. you guys are all jealous, i know. just ask C-Los, he's got a similar setup. he'll tell you how LAME you all are. sucks to be y'all sometimes...

 HOLLA Bullshit! Ok, so I go over to his house, get stoned out of my mind...and I don't know about you people, but when I get stoned I get am ready to go. I thought I made it pretty clear that I was all for hooking up too...what the hell? I know he wanted to b/c he called me in the first place. I'm pissed. I am getting a hook up soon, damnit! But hey, at least I had fun... Why the hell can't I go to the Alamo Draft House? Huh??? So I got my bone scan this morning. I have bad news, and I have worse news. What do you want to hear first? Bad news? Ok. Bad news: there is in fact a tiny stress fracture where I thought there was, in the first metatarsal (sp?) of my left foot. It's very small though, so it should heal up quickly. Worse news: there's a much bigger stress fracture in my other foot, near the joint between my ankle and my foot. It'll probably keep me out the rest of the summer. I'm not really upset...it's just kinda annoying. It's gonna suck coming back the first day of preseason though. Oh well I did it last year. There's this video contest held by Lawndale, this local art gallery. It's a fake public service announcement regarding something about current politics. I think I'm gonna have penis puppets for Bush and Kerry...just record sound bites and dress up penises and have a puppet show. What is my statement you ask? That politics in general is absurd. Elections are obnoxious, especially when both candidates suck. So I'm gonna represent them as penis puppets b/c they're just dicks anyway. The problem is, I don't have any penises to film. Blog readers...any volunteers?? Tomorrow I'm going to the Gay Pride Parade with my roommate Lauren. I'm so excited...I'll get to see tranies!!! I don't know about you, but I think transvestites are great. So fascinating. Afterwards we're going to Chances which is a lesbian bar. I think it's going to be way fun...I don't know how to dress though. I'll let you know how it goes. I've never been to a gay club before...adventure! I just talked to Heather online and it made me remember that I really miss yall. Oh yeah I emailed an old friend of mine who goes to NYU, her name's Rachel Helmick...some of yall might remember her...she rules. Anyway, she said to not even search for an apartment until like a month before moving b/c New Yorkers move all the time and sporadically. Ok I just saw the movie Monster...very good movie. I don't feel like giving a review right now. But it was good. Well, I gotta get up kinda early tomorrow, and I didn't get much sleep last night AND I'M BITTER THAT I DIDN'T HOOK UP STILL, so I'm going to bed. Goodnight girls.

 HOLLA i just posted some SEX-AY PITCHA'S, y'all!! Us HOTT mo' fo's sexin' it up in the sand! That's right, Galveston Beach!! What a tropical PARADISE! * Lots of boob shots, lots of hair flips, lots of mud fights, and unfortunately, lots of BAD pictures. (Of all of us, I think, haha!) But some really are SEXUH! I might post the good ones on Yafro so we hear what OneAviator thinks of them (and the rest of the nasty old men and cops and U.S. Marshalls who comment on my pictures...) urlLink OMG we are so HOTT!! urlLink Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue: HERE WE COME! haha, yeah right! * Please note that I was forced to edit the color of the poop-brown water in some of these pictures to simulate "paradise", although it didn't really pan out too well.

 HOLLA Dena im keeping HOLLA because HOLLA ROX THE BLOG THAT ROX THE PARTY. Holla is the original signature and it will remain so until i feel like changin it so THERE. Anyway, So if you look below dena's post you will see that i have a post ... i really wrote it yesterday but i just posted it today because im stupid and saved it as a draft instead of publishing it. Last night for Los' bday me dena mike los betsy angela yoli and jason went to the alamo draft house. AGAIN> but once AGAIN we were dissapointed to find that we couldnt get in!! Our movie began at 10:55 pm so being the procrastinators we are we didnt get to the theater until about 10:50.... and this biooootch pulls up in his car and is all "You cant come in... we stopped selling tickets at 10:30". Complete BS. So ONCE AGAIN we drove all the way to the draft house to be made fools of. I suggested a strike, but since we dont work there betsy informed me it would be a PROTEST. Whateva. Who wants to protest? So we went to denny's instead like dena mentioned. It was fun, and carlos tried to order the Cindarella Slam.... sounds dirty huh? Yeah well it is the "Cinderella" theme becuase HOLLA of hillary duffs new movie "Cinderella' but our waitress was retarded and said they didnt have the Cinderella Slam. This was basically our night.. not too exciting? BUT-- Heather and Sue- You'll be soo proud.... Usher's Yeah Yeah Yeah song came on in mikes car and so me dena and bets proceeded to scream YEAH really loud everytime he says yeah.. which is every 2 seconds and we got mike and carlos to join too! Just like the old days... (2 weeks ago). But it was fun..ohhh i miss yall. COME BACK!YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH! Today I had to work from 8am to 5pm. Let me tell you I feel bad for people with full time jobs who work like that every day... its so draining. I feel like i have been running for the past 12 hours non-stop. But no i have just been sitting at a computer. Which is weird that the first thing i do when i get home is get on the computer. Man im a computer nerd. Anyway, my boss bought us pizza today for lunch and so i had to go walk across main st. to HOLLA pick it up cause dominos is right there. Well i got in there at about 12....and waited and waited and waited... i was in there for at least 45 minutes! The people there are retarded! SERIOUSLY! Three of the employees were deaf! I have NOTHING against deaf people but.. c'mon... why are they working at a pizza joint during the busiest hour of the day in the MIDDLE OF DOWNTOWN where EVERYBODY is! I was like trying to tell him my order because they forgot and he was doing hand motions symbolizing "I cant hear you" ... i was like HOLLA NO CRAP... WHY THE F ARE YOU WORKING HERE?!?! Sorry..im bitter for the reason that while i was waiting all that time i was hit on by 2 old sleezy business men and I could have done without that in my day. One of them was a U.S Marshal named max. He was at least 30. Whats with me and old hispanic cops? Heather knows... remember the car wash when i got 5 bucks from the cop that invited me to an astros game... ew. Cops are dirty. U.S Marshals are cops right? Whats the difference?? Either way they are both dirty. Ok well i am super tired... and i need to now write a 3 page paper and take a stupid history test. YUCK. Yall should blog. Its cool. bets- How was last night with you LOVA?!?!?!?! BYE HOLLA HOLLA HOLLA HOLLA HOLLA HOLLA HOLLA HOLLA HOLLA HOLLA HOLLA HOLLA Dena I dedicate this blog to you! HOLLA

 HOLLA..... first of all, i thought you were gonna change HOLLA to something else shawna. second of all...i guess there really isn't a second of all but i too learned back in the day that if you are making a list, there must be a first and a second....so...there you go. ok, so last night we had some great plans to go to the alamo drafthouse for dodgeball (the movie) and some beers. well, apparently this place REALLY doesn't want our money because they NEVER let us in. last night, we drive all the way over there...get there at 10:45pm...the movie is supposed to start at 10:55pm. apparently you can't buy your ticket unless you get it 30 mins. before the show starts..LAME. so this was the 2nd time we couldn't go....so to make up for not being able to go there...what do we do? go to denny's. haha. it's funny how i swore i'd never eat there again after i got the nastiest, sourest pancake i've ever had....but luckily i wasn't hungry and just got a d-licious, scrumtulescent diet coke. then i paid shawna 4 cents for a mini cheesburger..it was good but a little buttery (it fell on some pancakes---oops). ok, this has to be the worst blog ever....but hey, you guys have to suffer..,not me. oh, we did take some funny pictures of bailey. we'll post them. erin (mike and c-los's room mate) has a water bottle shaped like a penis...heather you know what i'm talking about. well, once betsy was around and saw this penis..the fun began! haha..we were posing bailey (a teacup chiuaua) with the massive wang and of course got a lot of pictures! haha....i'll post them when i can. alright, i guess i'm gonna go now...shawna...call me if i have to pick you up before 5. d

 This was my post from yesterday... i accidentally forgot to post it and saved it as a draft instead..oops. June 24 'Ello Chaps! (p.s that was my attempt to type a british accent) First Off, Happy Birthday to dena's LOVER Carlos... he is 21 years old today and finally will taste his first sip of alcohol...legally that is. Tonight we are going to the Alamo Draft House.... hopefully we actually MAKE IT INSIDE this time...as long as dena remembers her ID! We are going to see dodgeball... Actually this will be my third time to see it.. but its such a GREAT MOVIE! Just like zoolander, it gets funnier everytime you see it. I highly reccomend it to everyone. So yesterday was my first day of work at the office, it was pretty good. Waking up at 6 am is never fun but the job is cool. I just get to sit infront of a computer all day and do data entry and answer the phones... oh and make the coffee.... but its definitley better than standing up and folding clothes for 6 hours. Houston has been raining uncontrollably the past month... like practically every day and i think i want to move somewhere else untill it stops. Its crazy... we all know that Houston rain is common but this is crazy rain. I hate it. Well soo anyway i guess the power went out at my house last night....so the alarm clock was reset... soooo I WOKE UP AT 8 AM which is when im supposed to BE AT WORK DOWNTOWN!!! I was freaking out... i set my phone alarm but app. i slept right through it! So i called my boss and apologized a million times! I definitley didn't give a good impression of myself missing my SECOND day of work! GEEZ... i feel like such a failure. Oh well he didnt really seem to mind... I am working 8am-5pm tomorrow so that should make up for it. I can't begin to tell you how excited i am to work 9 hours tomorrow..... hopefully i stay busy! So i am on chapter 5 of my lance armstrong book.... its a good book. IF you havent read it go get it... even if you dont like cycling (which honestly i dont) its still good. Makes you actually kind of feel like your life isnt all that bad. Anyway lance is a baller. Ok well i need to do some studying... FINALS NEXT WEEK... AAHHH. But i need to bring up some issues. Yall we all talked about how great the blog was going to be after the reunion... but frankly IT SUCKS! If you are going to blog only once a month..at least make it a good one! THats all.... im not directing this to anyone in particular.. just in general. Give me some good blogs. holla

 HOLLA....so i know it's been a LONG time since i last wrote but i've been playing 'soccer mom' this week with brianna (taking her to softball camp/practice all weekend/week). i am so sick of driving to UH. blah. oh yeah, and last time i tried to post there was a very large storm going on outside and seriously...i was just about to hit send after writing the LONGEST BEST blog EVER, the power went out and yeah, i lost the whole blog.....LAME. what's up with the weather? it won't stop raining. this rain is causing me to become seriously obese b/c plans to swim for workouts doesn't work when there is lightning everywhere. i got a new belly button ring for anyone who cares...it's blue and a little more dangly. kind of fun....good for dancing! oh, tomorrow (thursday) we're going to the alamo brewhouse (dinner/movie thing) so anyone 18+ is invited....BETSY, COME. hopefully that stupid biotch won't be working tomorrow night. she was SO lame. i hated her. yeah, it's true. i am ready for a few more drinks...i kind of want TC margaritas b/c they are cheap and STRONG. or maybe just strong on an empty stomach....but i guess beer will be good too. hmmmm...we'll see. hey, we should go to the OG and see alfronso the waiter....haha. he loves us. that was so fun last time we all went! isn't it funny how everything we do revolves around food? well, i guess not funny b/c food is awesome and SUPER GOOD. caroline....i think that carb shirt is awesome. well, i just wanted to say hello to my BFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF's since it's been forEVER. d

 we must have been posting at the same time, cause i almost lost MY ENTIRE BLOG! and then it finally published and i see that you just posted some bitchy whiny self-centered blog that could have cost MY blog. thanks a LOT. oral sex. to get, or not to get. that is the question. didn't we all have this conversation drunk off our asses two weeks ago when i almost made out with dena cause i thought she looked hot but then she informed me we were cousins -- not to mention both GIRLS -- and that that would just be wrong?? yeah, i'm not the person for advice, here. haha!

 shawna, that was one of the best blogs i've ever read... i know we bffffs are usually light-hearted and upbeat with our blogs, but it's nice to know that below the surface, we really are caring, thoughtful people. well, maybe not sue, since she hates everyone, but you know. JK LOL LYLAS STAY SWEET. But seriously, i totally pictured homeboy standing there in the rain with absolutely nothing, and it made me feel sad for him. i don't know, maybe it's just my emotional estrogen kickin' in, or the fact that it's been raining here every day since i got back. in fact, just a few days ago i saw this homeless guy standing on a corner in the pooring rain, holding a sign that he doubled as an umbrella after the cars drove by when the light turned green. and i remember thinking, "ha, yeah RIGHT that guy's homeless... he just wants easy money for this or that..." but looking back, it was unusually FREEZING outside for this time of year, and the poor guy was soaked to the bone, so why would he be standing out there asking for help if he really truly didn't need it. and there was me, just another passer-by, judging him as i questioned myself as to why anyone should even give him the time of day. but don't get me wrong, most of the "homeless" people in boulder drive SUVs and even "blow their cover" when their cell phones ring while they ask you for spare change... i guess i've just gotten too accustomed to assuming everyone out there who's asking for help doesn't really need it. okay, onto something less depressing... i'm going in for my first laser/bikini session tomorrow! i'm not sure if i'm still gonna go through with it, since it's kinda pricey, but i have a consultation first, and then i might go ahead with it. (haha, like how i rant and rave about poor people who have NOTHING, and then move right on into something pretentious, self-important, and TOTALLY superfluous?! wow, i'm a yuppie.) But if you think about it, all the money i'd save from not having to wax every couple of weeks, and then multiply that by the rest of my life, and voila! it's a good investment, right? right guys? guys? PICTURES. I know, i haven't been putting them up. it's just that they take FOREVER to upload for some reason, so i always quit after like, two. but i'm getting a new online album thing, so hopefully it'll be faster. you'll just have to hold your horses. okay, gotta get back to work. i have a deadline tomorrow from a mean client (aka Daddy Bu) who is pissed that i stayed an extra week in H-Town and now he's pilin' on the work :( AND this one i said i'd do for FREE. but it's all good, cause he told me today that he'd buy my new laptop so i could just pay HIM back, instead of putting it on a credit card or having to make monthly payments on it and get smothered with high interest rates! yay! and he's happy cause then he gets to write it off for tax purposes, so you see, it's a win-win sitch-ee-ay-shun.

 HOLLA Alright yall suck. Except Shawna. I've officially been doing nothing for the past three days. I've been craving, yearning for provocative, fascinating blogs. And what have I received?? Nothing! That's right. Nothing. Well, my foot thing's acting up again. Swell. So this time, I'm getting a bone scan. Finally, I will know if this is something I really need to worry about or what. You know I'm thinking about how my soccer career is gonna be over before I even know it. It's actually quite inconceivable to tell you the truth. I can't get past next season at all. It's all so overwhelming. It really stresses me out. So I'm gonna stop talking about it. But I think the tidal wave of emotion about walking away from fifteen years of soccer is just gonna hit me like a brick over the head. Anyway... I'm thinking about giving up my oral virginity. Seriously. I went out the other night, flirted with cute guys (make that cute guy) and thought, hell I've been ready for way too long. Give it up sister! I mean virginity is one thing, but come on, I want someone to go down on me damnit! And to be quite honest, I've always wanted to give a blow job. I firmly believe that no one loves penises (especially hard ones) more than miss Betsy Huete. But I am afraid I'll have a sensitive gag reflex and fuck it all up. And Christ, I'm twenty-one. Any opinions? Any tips? On Thursday, I'm meeting with an advisor to discuss studying abroad. I'm really excited...I think this might be a reality. There's this art school in Australia that is actually affordable. We'll see... Today was so not productive. I drove downtown to take care of my ticket. Well, my ticket isn't even in the system yet. And I could've lifted today, but of course I forgot my running shoes and you can't really lift in sandals, so it was basically wasted gas. Awesome. But at least I scheduled my bone scan. Ok I'm finished for the night. Start writing or I'll crap on your faces.

 I feel like I have been in some other world the past few days... I have been downtown... which, to me is another world. It is so strange how different Houston and Klein are. Here is one of my peeves. When people from klein who go to out of city/state colleges come back home saying they are in H-town or they live in the "ghetto". Let me tell you something, you are not in H-Town-- YOU ARE IN KLEIN... or SPRING, whatever you like to call it. The reason this bothers me is because half of the time these people have never actually lived in H-TOWN and have no idea what its like... the suburbs of klein, tx are COMPLETELY different compared to houston living. TRUST ME. Today as I was leaving UH (university of houston) i was driving down scott street (some might call it the ghetto) ... anyway, so i was driving along and saw this black man just standing there in the rain wearing white pants and a white shirt that were covered in mud. He was just standing there, looking confused and lonely. It was kind of sad, because here i am driving my new car that i probably dont deserve on my way to a suburb full of some of the snottiest people i have ever met, while this poor man it just standing there getting soaked in the rain. He probably lives in the 3rd ward in a house that looks abandoned. People probably see him and lock their doors or roll up their windows thinking that he MUST be dangerous. It really puts things into perspective. Anyway i dont know why I am being all DEEP TODAY... i think im just fed up with some of the people in klein (no names) that dont know how to accept people that arent like them. I know this isnt just a problem in klein, but you know... actually this all sparked the other night when mike and I went to see Dodgeball in the woodlands. Anyone from around here knows the woodlands is like the richest city ever! Ok these three girls in their 80s style mini skirts are walking toward their lexus in parking lot of the theater when one says "Wow we are parked in the ghetto!" ... i just started cracking up.... i dont think the Woodlands even knows what a ghetto is! Craziness! I have a concept for MTV... they should do a season of the real world where they take 7 rich strangers, put them in a shack in the 5th ward in houston, and give them a job at a pawn shop or something like that. That would make for some good TV. Ok anyway now that i have gone all philisophical on the world..... I start my job tomorrow. My sister got me a job at urlLink Comex International as an assistant... i guess ill be helping with the website and what not. Im not quite sure. But i get paid 8 dollars an hour and I work Monday thru thursday 8am-11:30am. It will be good for me to get some real experience opposed to working at a place like abercrombie where the only thing you learn is how to seduce your customers into buying slutty clothes. The office is smack dab in the middle of downtown... it should be a fun/interesting/insightful job. Hopefully good enough to get me an internship next summer in New York for a magazine.... keep em crossed. I cant wait to live with my best friends in New York City! :) Last night Mike bought me Lance Armstrongs book "It's Not About the Bike"... i am already on chapter three. I really dont like to read but when it comes to biography's and sports especially i get really into it! It is so inspirational and i really need some inspiration so i can get back to where I used to be in my running. I seriously need to get in shape and fast. I really want to break 5 in the mile... right now my best is 5:03 .. ahhh soo close yet so far away! I think i might load some more pictures from the bfffff reunion... i really have been busy that is why i havent gotten much blogging in. I have a paper due tomorrow in chemistry , two discusions due in history an essay AND I have to worry about waking up at 6 am to go to work every morning.... that does NOT sound fun. Ok well i would love to continue my novel blog but i really should get on top of all the crap i gotta do. HOLLA.

 HOLLA I'm bored...I missed soccer practice tonight. I really needed this...a few days of doing absolutely nothing. Shawna and Dena what are you doing?? Let's do something...like eat or watch Janosch. Please. Anything. I was so productive today. I finally renewed my license (Dena I called you twice so don't get mad), renewed my registration, and got my state inspection sticker. My mom was so happy. Of course she doesn't know that the reason I got it all done today was b/c I got pulled over Friday and if I go to the courthouse right away I can probably get all of it dismissed. Hopefully. Don't tell. What else...well I'm looking up study abroad programs. There was this art school in Scotland which seemed awesome, but it also seemed way expensive which is not awesome. I just gotta keep looking... Dena I just emailed Danielle about advice on New York apt searching. What is everyone's idea of what they want to pay for rent? B/c if we were all willing to pay $500 a month, we could probably find something pretty decent. Let me know... Anyway, gotta pee. We'll talk later.

 aloha. Im currently sitting at mike's apartment waiting for him to get back from work...he got off an hour ago so im thinking he made a few stops on the way back? I dont know. Dena & Carly (brianna's friend) are racing the toys we got from our sonic wacky packs today. As you can see (or read) we are very bored. I had a chemistry test this afternoon... i wasn't stressing out about it becauce the first test was almost EXACTLY like the review. So i studied the review and answered all the questions... well the test was NOTHING like the review this time. I was a bit mad about this, but as long as i go to class every day i am guaranteed a c+ ... some might say that isn't what my goal should be, to those people i say, screw you. I see nothing wrong with c+'s..... MIKES BACK. More later!

 so today i got an email telling me that besty had added me as a friend in her facebook but before she was allowed to add me i had to agree that i was her friend. well betsy, how badly do you want my friendship??hmmmmm... big news, cathy and mrs hicks and mrs hicks sister (who is crazier than her) are in london. yesterday i met up with them and took them around and then we went to see the reduced shakepeare comapany's complete works of shakespeare (abridged) and it was fantastic (as usual--ive seen it like 12 times) and the best think that happened was that liza and i got a student rate and our seats were on the first row AND then i got picked to go on stage and be Ophelia and i got to scream really really loud. i got a big round of applause and got to bow on stage. fun times. and THEN i fell in love with one of the actors we had sex right there on the stage in front of everyone--very romeo and juliet. after the play we all went out and drank and ate and it was good times. ok, i smell andi need to shower. PEOPLE, PICTURES!!

 girlfriends, i SUCK at blogging lately, i know, but i've been bombarded with family ever since i got home from h-town... my oldest sister kelly and her husband and their two boys came in the very next day that i got back. reed is 2 and ty is 6 weeks, so it's been one running around like crazy nonstop, and the other being passed around like a hot potato like nobody's business! at least he doesn't scream and cry his head off 24/7. it's only bad in the mornings at like, 6 am when he wakes up crying, reed's running around wanting someone to play with him, and vinnie, our bichon (and YES my mom spells his name with an "ie" at the end) gets all riled up wondering what all the commotion is and does the "bichon dash" at 120 mph around the house nonstop for 45 minutes... ahhhhh! get me outta here, you know? and then my other sister jaime came on thursday with her boyfriend, and they're staying a week, too, so the house has been way full. but it's been a lot of fun. i just haven't had any time to myself, you know?! and my OTHER sister's daughter just turned one, so we had her party yesterday, and then of course, today was father's day, so... yeah. shawna, happy 20-something! haha! don't you love that you're now of age where you can say you're "20-SOMETHING" and be oh so mysterious to the world?! keep 'em guessin', you know? that's my motto. sorry i didn't post until now, but, well, you know. cool that you got cool presents! i thought for sure you'd get a new pink ipod mini, especially after i showed mine to your mom and talked about how cool it was and how everyone who's anyone has one and if you don't then you'll never fit in with the cool crowd, but hey. maybe next year, right? so, for father's day, we got my dad a brand new fishing rod, that he got to pick out himself. he loooooooves it! which is good, cause i hate giving half-ass gifts that suck. we were gonna take Daddy Bu out for dinner, but he calls my sister and is like, "wanna try something different this year?" so she asked him what he had in mind, and he said he wanted to go gambling in Blackhawk! okay, random. a) he NEVER gambles. ever. b) well, there isn't a b, but i learned in 10th grade Composition that you can never have an outline that has an 'a' point but no 'b' point to follow, so there you have it. so my dad, jeff, melissa and shaun, me and daniel all drove up the mountain to go gambling, but when we got there, all my dad wanted to do was drive around Blackhawk and old towne Central City and reminisce (sp?) how he hasn't been up there in YEARS, and the last time he was there it was a mining ghost town, and how the Floridas used to live "just up that road about 4 or 5 miles..." when sara was a baby... then we ate at this nasty super $$$$ buffet that made Country Buffet look like a 5-star restaurant. but the kicker of the whole deal was that my dad "gambled" i think a total of $1. not kidding. i was playing my beloved Jackpot Party slots and he saw how much fun it is so he sat down next to me and actually debated if he should wage the buck or not. so he's playing and playing and is down to his last few credits, when lo and behold, he strikes it big and wins... $1!! So he cashes out and takes his 20 nickels up to the cashier to "cash 'em in" to get his dollar back. it was hilarious. wow dad, you sure are a high rolla', haha! i dropped about $15, daniel dropped $60 (ouch), jeff didn't gamble a penny (cause he's just like my dad), and melissa won about $10 on blackjack. shaun dind't really play much, either. so my question is, why the hell did my dad suggest we gamble, if he doesn't even gamble? so he could watch me and daniel lose our money? not that that's anything new, since we're practically regulars, but still... bazarre. still a lot of fun, though! ahhhhhhhhhh... i LOVE Jackpot Party... alright, daniel just got back from renting a movie for us. i told him to go pick one out without me and guess what he came back with??? the one with steve martin and the bazillion kids... haven't seen it, maybe i'll like it; let's not judge too early now, haha! love you girls! more later! -h :)

 sue you still have access... i think BLOGSPOT.COM is going through some updates or something... i dont know.

 HOLLA--which one of you comptermongers destroyed my access to blogs? FIX IT. argh. i need my bloggas

 HOLLA Ok so once again, yesterday I tried to blog and right before I finished, my internet disconnected. I screamed. So maybe I can finish it before all hell breaks loose... I wanted to officially wish Shawna a happy twentieth birthday on the blog. I had a hell of a time last night, even though the whole Alamo Draft House thing didn't happen. One of these days, I'm going. And we got to hang out with Kate Jackson which was cool (Sue she says hi and she misses you). And Dena was being hilarious all night...and in her defense, she didn't eat much which is why the margarita hit her. Oh yeah I've been wanting to give a review of Saved!, the film Dena, Shawna, and I saw the other night. Here it is: disappointing. I mean, I didn't really ever get bored watching it and it was pretty entertaining, but the satire was too obvious. Satire is funny when it's subtle. Additionally, I thought it was hypocritical. It was clearly making fun of hard-core Christians for recruiting America's youth by trying to be "cool", which I also find entirely obnoxious. However, it appeared as though their message was to not be Christian, or to be anti-Christian. This was represented by the "bad girl" in the film was always there to "save" the good Christian girls as they fell out of supposed good Christian values. I found this to be annoying. I think a more appropriate message would've been to think critically about things and not blindly join a cult which is essentially what today's Christianity has become. But instead the film goes to the opposite extreme by trying to recruit people into not being Christian. But you know what, I love Mandy Moore, I love the boy from Almost Famous, and hey, Macaulay Culkin's back! So anyway... I'm thinking about studying abroad next spring. I doubt it's gonna actually happen b/c I'm not willing to pay for it myself, and my dad most likely won't cover the whole thing himself either, but it's really something I'd like to do. I figure that if I'm gonna do it, next spring is the only chance I'll have. And I would feel bad b/c it would be the spring semester of my senior year, but since I'm staying a fifth year, it won't be that big of a deal. Plus I think I'm gonna need a break from my room soon. I love those girls and I love living with them, but Jesus, it's just been way too long. I'm gonna go crazy if I don't get out for once. So I have a three week break from camp! I love my life right now. Ok girls I'm gonna publish this blog before my internet goes out. Lates.

 YO Yo YO! SO the bday was a success for the most part. Got some hott vic sec's (as bets would say) or VICTORIA SECRET (for NORMAL beings)underwear and one bra. They are sexy and hott and you wish you could see them. And I got DVD player, money, movies, oakley's, starbursts from kate *thanks, and my dad just got home from russia today and brought me the COOLEST HAT EVER. It is one of those huge furry hats that has the flaps on the sides. Man we wore the russian hat all night. Today i had to take a freakin test and write a paper, LAMO but i got an 82 which is good because its a pass/fail class. Then mike and I went to the mall for about an hour, then we went and met my family, bets and kate at Willowbowl (bowling alley) and I had my own little bday party there. It was fantastic. We had popcorn and little ring pops with flashing lights inside! It was great. There were 10 of us and we were all wearing flashing ringpops...even my parents. Everyone wanted to be us. I bowled pretty good. Got many strikes, but mike won both games. We had about 20 minutes left after the second game so we played speed bowling... fun. After bowling we were supposed to go to the Alamo Draft House. ADH is a movie theater that serves you dinner as you watch the movie. Its really cool. So we drove all the way there and go inside and the employee was being a complete ice queen (aka BITCH ASS HO) and gave us attitude. App you have to have an ID for 18 + in order to get in because they serve alcohol. Well this was fine for most of us... but dena is LAME and forgot her ID. Not only this but kelcee is only 17 so she couldnt get in either. So we realize the ADH thing isnt going to work, but mike bets and I already had bought our tickets... so like 1 minute after we bought the ticket (and we were standing by the ticket window the whole time) mike asks for a refund and bitch ass ho is like 'we can't give refunds' .... umm what?! Yeah she was freakin retarded. Mike asked for the manager and got his money back. We are all going to call in and get that bioootch fired. So plan b came around. Well we didnt have a plan b so we went to eat at TC. (haha ooh how i hate that abbreviation)... TACO CABANA. Yeah dena got drunk off one margarita and continued to make very dense comments the rest of the night. Basically my bday was cool. Nothing too special, but you know how birthdays are...after 12 they just start getting more and more lame every year. Until you are 21 and then you get trashed but the rest of your life is pretty much downhill from there.... you know the whole being old thing. Ok yeah im rambling. Thank you heather for the birthday song on my voicemail... it was great, i think you should try out for american idol. Thank you sue for recognizing the hottness of my twentiness. Betsy thanks for the best present ever... your sweaty socks from bowling.... and dena thank you for asking me if i could pay for your movie ticket tonight. They were the best presents EVER. :) oh yeah bets i have a present for you i remember how much you love the name madison so i decided to pull up an article i found online.... urlLink here you go alright... time for me to jet like a turbo vet. Ill write more when its not 2:30 in the morning. Happy fathers day...mike.... i mean....SURPRISE! Its a girl! And i want to name is Madison! kidding. HOLLA

 HOLLA--youre 20 now you can......riiiiiight...party hard kiddo. miss ya and happy bday.

 IM 20! -shawna

 HOLLA So it's the last day of camp thank God...this is gonna be a short one. Just wanted to let you know that one of my campers made me a homecoming mum for camp...so I'm wearing it. I feel young again. There's nothing like running a soccer camp with a mum on. So yeah I'm going to Pangea tonight...this club downtown. Shawna/Dena are you coming??? Give me a call. I'm bored...we're on our lunch break. We're gonna have joke of the day soon, and this little fat hispanic kid with a lisp is gonna tell a joke that doesn't make any sense. Ok, gotta go...see yall later!

 well, i've been cropping and brightening pictures, but there are sooooo many!! so, i'm just gonna upload them as i go. here is a link to urlLink what's up so far . some will probably be duplicates of what shawna's already posted, but i'm just gonna be posting all of the ones i have. yay! (well, except for maybe the really really really awful ones! and if you see any that just MUST be deleted, lemme know and i'll see what i can do... for $1. or a sexual favor, your choice. okay, i'm off to bed. more pictures/stories to come!!

 HOLLA Right now I'm working at good ol' Soccer4All...what a treat. But we close in thirty-five minutes so I'm pretty thrilled about that. Heather, I'm going through withdrawal too. I really miss you and Suzy. I'm so glad we got to meet you...it ruled b/c you fit in with us so easily and we had so much fun. Yesterday that Usher song came on the radio and it reminded me of the time we were driving back from Olive Garden and we were screaming literally the whole way home. I love us. Anyway I'm so happy that we all got together b/c it really reminded me why we're all best friends. I think it's awesome that we still keep in touch even through years of college, and I think it's even more awesome that we still act so immature together. And sentimental moment is over! Now I'm going to continue Shawna's blog and talk about the night after we had gone tubing on the river. Here it goes... Ok, so we pretty much hung out at Katie's house again. Except this night was different. Why you may ask? We had karaoke. Three cd's worth of karaoke songs that we sang over and over for literally seven hours straight. Now some people may get bored/annoyed w/ stupid karaoke songs after, say, twenty-seven minutes, but oh no not the bloggas. No way Jose. I sang "Bills, Bills, Bills" by Destiny Child maybe eight times. What a hit. I think my favorite was Lou Bega's "Mambo Number Five"...we had me, Sarah (Dena and Shawna's older sister), Shawna, Mike, Heather, and two of Katie Forde's friends putting on one hell of a concert. There wasn't an audience, but I really felt we brought our A game. Dena and Carlos passed out kinda early on Katie's bed which caused a bit of a dilemma...and Dena was passed out in a really cool position...haha. Sue was ardently discussing something with Stacy Middleton (friend from high school that we haven't seen in a while). I think they were discussing virginity...Sue was trying to involve me in the conversation b/c let's face it kiddies I'm an expert, but I had trouble focusing. Instead, I was trying to explain to Shawna and Mike the 1920's flicker I was seeing. This is because I was stoned. I think my favorite was Carlos, who was totally trashed and his eyes were halfway shut the entire time. Oh Carlos. Finally after Katie's roommate from hell gave us the evil eye for the thirtieth time, we decided to cease the karaoke entertainment...ok we're closing gotta go! I'll continue this very soon. Love you guys!

 tid bits of knowledge that will be expanded on when i get more sleep whore--from the word horais, meaning full body orgasm there was no place called nazareth jesus wasnt jewish and was egyptian gothic cathedral were designed with erotic undertones--the entrances are reproductions of the womans vagina women were a threat to the partriarchial chrurch arrangement because of the potential for sexual pleasre (something about dual use for the penis for urination and procreation) cock- term used because the rooster rises or something... i was going to tell you what i have discovered so far but there is a documentary about prrn being a family business and i need to watch it...i lie, well, i dont...it is on but im going to bed instead. wow, what a sexual blog this was. i am the pervert in the box. oh well, all tension will be released tomorrow when i go out and, fingers crossed, meet another soul mate--ps im still bitter i didnt get to find out the name to my last soul mate. heather, dena--PICTURES!!!! fresh beer tastes better true. -scanadlous sue

 girlfriends, i can't even express the separation anxiety i'm going through right now. i miss my bloggas fo' rEAl. so much to post, but i'm supa-sleepy, and i'm sorry i didn't post earlier when i had the energy. speaking of when-i-have-the-energy, i can't wait to make our hott new banner! it's gonna be sex-ay! but please take note that i at least got this ghetto one up and running again, AND i managed to quickly swap out chinese-asain-betsy for sexuh-sultry-betsy... i think we can all agree that it had to be done, and it had to be done immediately. "cause... i would DO ANY-THING-AAAAAAHHHHHHH..." stories and more to come! right guys?! guys...? -h :)

 Ok I just wrote the hugest blog ever, and Juno, my internet provider, disconnected me before I could publish it. I tried copying it and pasting it, but it didn't work. I'm really pissed off. And I'm so exhausted from camp...so I'm gonna take a nap and try this again later. But I miss and love you guys! More stories to come...Shawna I know I said I was gonna call you but I need sleep. If yall are doing anything fun later, call me ok? I'll blog later.

 Just wanted to mention how much fun BAR houston was... especially when you have hotties like urlLink THIS dancing over your head all night.... wooo hooo! urlLink I WAS SHOCKED AND APPALLED! ok.. more bloggin in the future! -SCLUB7

 well well well... looks like all the crazy fun has finally come to an end. At least for sue and heather... im sorry but houston is WAYYYYY more fun than LONDON AND COLORADO! Right. At least admit that y'all miss hangin out with such cool h-town folk such as me and betsy... and dena i guess too. Anyway sue and heather have left and my life is back to normal. I started working out again today. I ran 4 miles with kelcee when i got back from my summer school class and strangely enough it did not hurt at all. Now I am already bored. I think i might nap because 2 weeeks of seeing two hot girls such as heather and sue really takes ALL of your energy. I really want to blog about all the fun and exciting things that happened the past two weeks but not only would it take me 5 million hours to type out all the fun we had, but I dont wanna tell everything because then no one else will have anything to blog about. SO for now I am going to choose one event to blog about and then every day if no one blogs about all the other fun things i will blog about them... ok So this past weekend we went to Austin to stay with katie f. I wont blog about the car ride up there because i will leave that to sue and betsy for it will probably sound less annoying and more funny from their point of view. Saturday: We wake up ... all of us spread out on the floor of katies house and get ready to go to the river where we are going tubing. First off, i am taking an online history class right now and I had a test due so we all get together to take my test. It was me (who knows nothing about history) Sue (GENIUS) Bets (former history major) and mike (has a history degree). SO here we are all trying to take this stupid test.... all i have to say is my grade was a 58 out of 100. HMMM... my smarty smarterson friends did not pull through on that one. Anyway, around 11 am we were on our way to the river. After katie drove 30 minutes with uncontrollable honking (which she has previously gotten an ACTUAL TICKET FOR) we get to the river. Dena chugs beer like its water, and carlos throws one back as well. Katie mixes poweraid and vodka, and I opt not to drink today. It was Me, Heather, Sue, Mike, Betsy, Carlos, Katie and Dena at the river. SO we get our tubes, and mike and I are the only smart ones who get tubes with bottoms. I like to be comfortable EVEN while doing something such as tubing. SO we start going down the river, trying to stay with eachother and dena is ALREADY DRUNK AND SLIGHTLY ANNOYING (*by slightly i mean REALLY REALLY REALLY annoying). We get to the first big shoot which is practically a waterslide and we get split up at this point. So mike and I are trying to find everyone when we get to another drop. At the bottom of this drop i see betsy and katie floating in the water WITHOUT their tubes (which cost 11 bucks each) and then i see half of denas beer floating down the river. So dena is trying to save her beer while katie and betsy have no tubes. Betsy ends up LOSING all of her things (including sue's skirt). So mike steals a couple of abandoned tubes and betsy and katie finally are back with the group. Dena is still drinking, and getting more and more annoying as we float along the river. Once we reach the end we decide to go again. The second time was SOO much more fun than the first. We are connected in a line and went down all the chutes like that. Dena was really really drunk at this point and we were doing everything we could to float on the other side of the river of where she was. We made friends with a stick named Rupert who found its way back to us half the time we were on the river. Betsy made friends with a tangled mess of leaves, weeds and human hair. It seemed to find its way back to her every time. She sang a song to it ... Meatloaf's "i'll do anything for love" ... yeah it was hilarious. Dena also ended up attached to some other group part of the way... haha. Anyway the river was a blast and words could not describe how much fun we had and how annoying dena was. LOL GF BFFF STAY SWEET. Later That night was even more fun... but this blog is SOOOOO LONG, so i'll save the continuation of this story for my next blog. A preview of the next blog: Dena's still drunk, and still drinking. HOLLA

 HOLLA homies. i am in london and it is HOT! who knew? well i took a four nap as soon as i got in because the horrible mexican lady from chiuaua wouldnt shut up the entire plane ride--even when i was watching the movies and blatantly turning up the volume as she was speaking at me. i went apartment humting today and i am totally stoked to move into the most kick ass flat there ever was. the only problem with that is that london is the most expensive city ever and i cant afford anything. oh well, maybe ill win the lottery or my pimp will give me a little more commission, riiiight. speaking of whores, i am officially OBSESSED with mary magdalen and i think i am going to stalk her. i am going to a temple tonight. oh my goodness. i almost forgot to tell you. as my mom and i were heading to the airport i was all " i didnt get to see coach stoberl--how sad--lets drive by khs to see if hes there. guess what? he was. my mom made me get out and go talk to him. i hugged him three times and we fell in love. after we madeout and i got back in the car my mom was like " now i understand why you like economics so much...he should be a model, not a teacher" guys, i dont know if its possible but he got better looking. him amd mary magadalen--officially obsessed. we are hot bitches--everyone thinks so--check out heathers comments. (sans the asshole who doesnt appreciate denas hot legs) ok jokers, it is time for me to get some more beers and some more sleep. later dudes. TTYL LOL LYLAS

 Oh my god, today is the longest day EVER. More on that later. Yesterday (Happy BELATED Memorial Day) me and dena went with Carlos and Mike to carlos' sisters house for a BBQ. It was pretty cool. His nephew brendan is freakin cute. At first when we got there i thought it was one of those annoying babies considering the first 30 minutes we were there is wouldnt stop crying... but carlos informed me the kid NEVER cries so something must have been wrong. Anyway i spent most of my time playin with him. (he is 1 1/2 yrs old). He had one of those really big rubber balls that was the same height as him and he would run to try and catch it and then he would fall on it and bounce off the ball and land on his back. He did it like 30 times and never cried once. It was hilarious. He also would go up to the fake plants and sniff them. He is really cute. Sue also decided to FINALLY get in touch with us! She got in saturday but didnt call till SUNDAY. OMG GF I CANT BELIEVE YOU!!! LOL. Anyway her and bets met me dena carlos mike adam kelcee and angela at Olive Garden for dinner. It was crazy. We were all being super loud and ordering drinks and laughing. The people behind us kept staring. But hey we havent been together in a long time so we can be as loud as we want! Bets was ordering drinks and she kept asking 'is there alcohol in this" she kept picking non-alcoholic ones... so she finally just said "give me something chocolatey with alcohol." Her drink tasted like cake... and alcohol. Sue got the same thing and we all shared. Dena got some mango tasting drink with rum i think? And a shot of amaretto. It was nasty... the mango tasted like butt crack. But she liked it. She also asked the waiter if she could STEAL the amaretto shot glass bc it was pretty... needless to say the evening was very crazy and loud. Kelcee also made fun of herself a lot... oh kelcee we love you. Later on i painted. I like to paint. Sue hates artists but too bad TWO OF YOUR BFFFFFFFFF'S ARE ARTISTS. Ok anyway... i have been running well lately... 30 minutes sunday, 45 yesterday and 40 today. Im slowly but surely returning to my old running self. Yay. Today was my first day of summer school... I am taking one class at UH (chemistry) and two online at Tomball. My chem prof is badass... this is the second time i have had him so im excited for that class. But my online classes are both history... i am not looking forward to it. I have like 9 BOOKS between the two classes and I have assignments and tests every week and crap due EVERY DAY. Oh my lord... i want to quit already. But today after class i went to eat lunch at Kahn's with Mike and then i left at about 4:50 pm. I got home at 6:40! It normally takes 30 minutes to get home... but EVERY highway i got on there was bumper to bumper traffic. Houston drivers are soo retarded... traffic is normally due to the nosy people of H-Town who think they need to slow down to watch people broken down or get in an accident.... it really isnt NECESSARY! I was definitley in a bad mood by the time I got home (not only did aunt flo visit today) But i had to still go running and CLEAN tonight. So i just got done running and now i still have a long night of cleaning ahead of me. I even had to skip out on fudruckers fun with the fam so i could get all my shiznit done! BLAH!!!! anyway, heather comes tomorrow night! woooo hoooo. can't wait! She will make all my stress go away... sexual stress that is. LOL GF TTYL LYLAS BFFF OMG! off to be cinderella ... except without the prince, ball, awesome dress and shoes and pumpkin carriage.... ok maybe im just off to be a maid. Damnit. alloh!

 Wow, I feel soo much better hearing that heather. You know I was depressed and all about not coming to Colorado, but as soon as I read all the things y'all did I realized how lucky I am that I didn't go. Thanks. By the way, that was me being completely sarchastic. Im glad I got to read about all the fun things you guys did because now Im 100 times more depressed that I was stuck in H-Town getting my ass raped by homeless men downtown who smell like they have peed themselves 3 times a day for the past 20 years. But thanks for that. I really appreciate it. Is it sad that my life has been sooo bland that just reading the summary of the fun things you did made me wet myself?? Ha. I hate my life. The good news is I saved a bunch of money on my car insurance. Wait, nope that didn't happen either. I have been running though, so dena, thanks for telling everyone I have a flat butt, TOO BAD it is totally HOTT now that i have been working out a lot! So kiss my bubblalicious ass biioootch. Today we had a car wash. WOAH, surprise of the year, we had a car wash!?!? Yes I know it is shocking, but it is true. (Sarchasm). Anyway, we made $650 today! Yes... that is right. Crazy eh? Its because im so damn sexy. Looks like we are one step closer to soaking up the sun in Hawaii in September.. WOO HOO. I do need to go back though because the shorts I bought last year that say 'Aloha" on the butt.. yeah the 'A' fell off so now it just says "LOHA"... i was asked one too many times today why my ass said LOHA and what it meant! I tried Brianna's tactic today of holding up the "car wash" sign upside down to grab attention. Sadly nobody even cared to tell me it was upside down. Even though i KNEW it was, they didn't have the courtesy to let me know that I looked like an idiot. Sue, im sorry you and your friend had to watch a nigerian man whack off. But at least you saw something interesting while traveling. Im sorry but I would have rather seen a nigerian man whacking off all those times i went to europe, opposed to seeing stupid statues and buildings. Im sorry, i dont appreciate history, it bores me. Ok well i just got done running and i sweat over my sweat from washing cars which means i am double sweaty. So im off to the pool to clean up. Ha. Joke. That is dena, not me. SHOWER TIME! HOLLA

 it's been a sad, sad day so far, since dena left with her dad and brianna this morning. wow, what a week we had, hence the lack of posts. (shawna, you SO should have been here. i miss you and your sexy ass, although dena says it's going flat and is no longer a bubblebutt...) hate to do this, but i have to go feed and let out daniel's dog to go doo. i'll have to post later tonight. stories to look forward to: Dena's smeared residuals stuck to the toilet bowl @ Daren's house! Me nursing the worst hangover all day yesterday! My BOOBS HURT and you can't wait to find out why! Dena's phallic "sculpture" (can anyone guess the medium she used??) Csilla's dirty scrabble word! HUNGARIAN KNEES. (thanks, g-ma.) Drunken foosball with Jeff and Joe! Tammy kicked our asses in Body Shop and put us out of commission for 3 days! Cavi 'R' Us! Aunt Flo's size 38D bra dangling from the rafters @ the Lil' Bear! Our HOTT trip to "S-CLUB"!!!! Fo' real! And much, much more... Dena - feel free to post about any of these stories if I don't get to them first... LOVEYOUMISSYOUWANTYOU!!

 bonjourno!! so i havent blogged because of the backpacking around italia and the not staying in hotels and sleeping in trainstations but i want you all to know i havent forgotten my bloggas. i am having a blast with liberal amie and despite the fact that we got raped and pillaged in rome (pickpocketed, and molested, properly, my a nigerian--- he was whacking off in amies face when she woke up and was looking up her skirt all night while she was sleeping--it woul dhave been worse for me but i hid underneath a bed--damn foreigners) we are in florence now. betsy, youd love it. you have to do it. the museums are amazing. i spent four hours yesterday in the uffizi and nearly orgasmed when i saw the davinici. ooooh leo, ooooh. it was good for me. i alleviated my dryspell. i found a HOT italiano and i dont know his name but, it was good for me. im a skank and i am proud. italians are shameless though. i feel like dena would really get along wiht italian men....dont ask em why, she just would i just found out that i am gonna go to athens for the olympics. yay. as long as mummy doesnt say no, its on...if any of you happen to be in athens at the time, we'll have a flat and youre welcome to stay with me. betsy, are you in love with my brother....WHY NOT. My dad thinks thtat you guys would have smelly kids. i agree. dena, where are you. blog dammit. heather, hello. it will be nice when school starts and blogging becomes the only thing to do again. that way ill be able to keep in touch with yous hoes better. off to the academia and to see DAVID!!! 17 foot naked man. hahahaha!!!! besty is jealous.

 i really appreciate sonic. Their "Wacky Packs" are orgasmic. Really. I mean, it cost me $2.67 to get the tastiest grilled cheese sandwich, fries and a dr.pepper. Plus I got groovy sunglasses, they are called "Creature Specs". They are in fact the ugliest sunglasses I have ever seen, but I assure you I will enjoy them. Anyway, this is tasty. I just finished my run. It hurt. my knee actually did not hurt today. But the entire rest of my body did. Swell. It was actually because ive been doing these ab/butt/leg/arm workouts everyday while i watch tv... and i can def. feel it. During my run my ab muscles felt like they were trying to squeeze my organs up through my esophogus and out of my mouth. If THAT makes any sense at all..basically it hurt. But I KEPT GOING... im determined to be the next .... ummm... i dont know. Sadly enough I do not know any fast 1500 m girls names. YOU would think i would have some sort of 'IDOL' or something. eh. urlLink go here if you want to be amused/freaked out/strangely aroused/emotionally touched/enlightened all at once. This is funny. Thank Carlos Rivas for finding the crazy site. i am going to go do my ab/butt/arm/leg workout now. WHYYYYYYYYY DOESN'T anyone else F-IINNNGG POST?!?!?! HOLLA

 OMG! Ok... this happened yesterday but holy crap... i was laughing so hard!&nbsp; Oscar was running outside by the pool and he totally lost his balance and fell in!! Oh this story sounds familiar you say? Yes because I already told it.&nbsp; Approximately one hour after he fell in the first time... HE FELL IN AGAIN.. YES TWICE IN ONE DAY!&nbsp; He has never done this before... i think he is "gettin' retarded" like the black eyed peas.&nbsp; It was so funny though because I actually saw it happen this time.&nbsp; He was in the deep end trying to get out on the ledge and he couldnt.&nbsp; I guess some people might have felt sorry for him but I was laughing hard!&nbsp; I did help him out eventually, but man oh man it was funny.&nbsp; Its funny when he gets wet because he only weighs 4 pounds, but all his fluffy hair makes him look bigger.&nbsp; When he gets wet he looks like a rat.&nbsp; Ha.&nbsp; &nbsp; Last night after we ran, kelcee and I headed over to Mike and Carlos' apartment dowtown.&nbsp; We all ate and played some halo.&nbsp; I haven't played halo in a long time so I sucked.&nbsp; Not as bad a you guys suck, but sucked.&nbsp; JK LOVE YA SISTA CALL ME.&nbsp; Anyway, it was me mike carlos kelcee adam davis (sue calm down), stephen&nbsp;and this guy named Orhen.&nbsp; Yes like the kill bill character.&nbsp; Sesar and Mo came over later.&nbsp; Anyway, yall dont know these people so I dont know why it even matters.&nbsp; Half way through the game I changed my name to "effin-a" because I had to say that Many Many times based on the fact that I sucked horribly.&nbsp; &nbsp; So as I was walking up to the office today this guy walking by me was like "You always walk this fast?" I was going to just ignore him, because when you are downtown houston you should never make eye contact! But he was in a business suit so I thought he had to be slightly safe.&nbsp; Anyway turns out we work in the same building and his name is shawn, he goes &nbsp;"Well this is strictly platonic, but if I see you around I want you to come eat lunch with me... i hardly get out of the office".&nbsp; Yeah right, platonic my ass, I walked away quickly... then we ended up on the same elevator making for an&nbsp;uncomfortable ride. &nbsp; Betsy maybe your browser needs to be updated. Sometimes if you have an old browser you can't see everything right.&nbsp; For instance... you might have like Internet Explorer 4.0 or something and I think the newest version is 6.0.&nbsp; You can update for free.&nbsp; &nbsp; Dena/Heather- I would assume that y'all would have a lot of exciting tales to tell, and since I know you have 20 computers at your house, heather, i know yall spend your time on there... flashback to last summer when we spent every night online learning hungarian! My point is, yall are obviously doing a lot more exciting things then me, so post! &nbsp; Sue, whats your excuse biiootch? &nbsp; HOLLA

 HOLLA

 The FUNNIEST THING JUST HAPPENED.&nbsp; Yesterday when kelly came over with her dog, we went out to the back yard and she mentioned how she was afraid her dog would fall in the pool.. I reassured her that our dog has been playing back there for 3 years and has never fallin in.&nbsp; Anyway... today I let oscar out to go run out in the yard to chase the cats he is so freakin obsessed with.&nbsp; Normally after a minute he will bark so he can come back in, but he wasn't barking so I went to check on him.&nbsp; RIGHT when i open the door i see Oscar struggling to climb out of the pool... hahaha he was running around and i guess he slipped in.&nbsp; He look pretty freaked out because he hates to swim. Man it was funny. Almost as funny as the time my mom was gardening and fell in the pool fully clothed. Ohhh memories. Ok.. im going now. Just thought i would share that with you. HOLLA

 Y'all, last night I had a dream that i was one of those poets in the little cafes where the people snap their fingers.... the weirdest part is that i REMEMBER THE POEM almost perfectly that i was stating in my dream.&nbsp; Weird.&nbsp;So here is the deep poem that I made up in my dream.... haha... im such an artsy dreamer. What it means? I do not know. If you are one of those dream analysists, please fill me in on why the hell i dreamt this! In other news, .... ok there is no other news. &nbsp; the lights were low, they had no glow dimming and flickering there was nothing to show &nbsp; sleep deprived with open eyes my life became a fairy tale disguised by the blur &nbsp; i could not see hope is there for life was present but was not clear &nbsp; gellin' like a fellin' HOLLA

 today is kinda of boring.&nbsp; or not so much boring, but very uneventful.&nbsp; I feel like im wasting my summer right now.&nbsp; But i honestly have nothing else to do. . . and Im way to tired to make an effort.&nbsp; so if you are my friend, don't take it personally that I haven't called you once this summer.... it&nbsp; is purely laziness.&nbsp; There is only so much you can do anyway until you run out of things to do... then&nbsp;hanging out gets old.&nbsp; maybe im just a very negative person who hates people. Yep thats it. But I dont hate you neccessarily... just people in general. Sometimes they make stupid comments and talk about stupid things and Im too selfish to care about half the stuff people tell me.&nbsp; Ok really...whats my problem? Im being a bitch right now. Yeah its definitley the fact that im bitter and alone in my house while everyone else is enjoying their summers in colorado... and by everyone i mean dena and heather. BOOOOOO.&nbsp; I hate my job. But I like money. I hate driving to work every damn morning in traffic... but once again, I really like money.&nbsp; So untill someone starts paying me to sit around, I guess i have to keep my job.&nbsp; I think someone should pay me for blogging, I do it a lot.&nbsp; I think I deserve some sort of reward for all my writing... check out my profile... I have written like 5 million words.&nbsp; That doesnt include my xanga site. Now I am rambling. &nbsp; Kelly Helms, my old room mate, just stopped by my house with her dog lilly.&nbsp; She is going on a cruise saturday and needs me to watch her dog so she wanted her dog to meet my dog to see how they "interact" i guess.&nbsp; The funny thing about my dog is he doesn't really understand that he is a dog, therefore he will not play with other dogs.&nbsp; Lilly kept running up to him and stuff and oscar would just ignore her and turn away.&nbsp; I think he just doesn't know what to do.&nbsp; Man, he needs to figure out how to be a real f-in dog. &nbsp; Last night I had to stay at my house in klein all alone.&nbsp; It was kind of scary.. oscar kept barking at random stuff and waking me up. It was quite annoying.&nbsp; The best part was when i woke up at 3 am and Hallucinated that there was a Giant Spider hanging over my head. I freaked out. So i got up turned on the light... no spider.&nbsp; This is really strange because I have had these spider hallucinations about 5 times this summer. Seriously... i dont know what it is... because Im not afraid of spiders, but obviously when i wake up to a giant spider on my face, yes im a bit freaked out.&nbsp; I dont know whats going on... it must be the drugs. Joke. I dont consider marijuana a drug. Joking again... I have actually never smoked, eaten, or whatever the hell else you did with it before.&nbsp; Hm... i guess im just not a pot kinda girl? I dont know... anyway off subject.&nbsp; Somebody please tell me why I have spider hallucinations all the time! Thank you. &nbsp; Today at work I had to call all these trucking companies and ask them to go to our website... anyway, this one secretary bioootch answered and was all trying to get me off the phone. I asked her for an email address and she just kept saying 'we aren't interested young lady... " and so I got all GI JOE on her ass and was like "I want to speak to your boss".&nbsp; She freaked out and started being all nice.&nbsp; Old ladies suck.&nbsp;Why do they think they are better just because they are older... you aren't better then me.&nbsp; Lets weigh this here... your probably a 50 year old secretary... im a 20 year old "ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT" ... i already have a better job then you. SO step off. That is what i should have said.&nbsp; Yeah. Ill call her back tomorrow and tell her whats up. &nbsp; Ok. I think mike is coming over so I need to go get the pool boy out of my bed and into some clothes if you know what im sayin? eh... eh?? Ha. Yeah.&nbsp; Bye. &nbsp; P.S- Lately I have noticed that I am the only one blogging. So can someone else please drop all their priorities like me and start posting?? Cause im getting a lil depressed. Thanks. &nbsp; HOLLA

 I just got done running.&nbsp; Earlier today when I got home from work I told myself... 'Instead of actually running, i will do a 15 minute workout in my living room' .... so i layed out on the carpet in front of the TV and did abs, humping exersizes (buns of steel shit), leg lifts and push ups.&nbsp; The reason i chose to do this is because i was hungry and I didn't want to have to wait until AFTER I ran to eat. (Good priorities eh?)&nbsp; So yeah.&nbsp; I did that.&nbsp; But then after I got home from watching Eurotrip (more on that later) I realized I had nothing to do.&nbsp; And it wasnt hot anymore so at 8:30 I headed up to the track and ran.&nbsp; Im so proud of me.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the second day in a row i have run.&nbsp; I plan on running everyday until Cross-Country starts. Which was supposed to be my plan&nbsp;since summer started...oops.&nbsp; I ran&nbsp;a 400, 1600, 200, 200, 1600.... fast.&nbsp; Well 'out of shape" fast that is.&nbsp; But it felt pretty good besides the throbbing pain in my knee. That will go away eventually. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Before my run, Angela invited me to subway, although, yes, I had already eaten 30 minutes earlier... i couldn't resist my subway temptations (oh yeah by the way, subway doesn't gross me out anymore...).&nbsp; So we met up and after 5 minutes we were both done.&nbsp; Ha ha. So then we sat there for about 30 minutes trying to think of something else two hott sexy ladies could do at 4:30 in the afternoon.&nbsp; After discussing shopping, mini-golfing, kemah boardwalk.... we came up with ...dun dun duuuun : Renting a Freakin movie! Cause we NEVER EVER do this. We looked everywhere and pretty much realized we had seen almost everything. We got Eurotrip and Chasing Amy? Two movies I really dont remember hearing about. But whatever.&nbsp; We watched Eurotrip... first of all... it had some oddly funny things in it (like matt damons unusual roll) but basically i was just kind of grossed out most of it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me just say two words: Nude Beach.&nbsp; (Old european men) YUCK. Ew. Gross.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok i have to say more than two words... THERE WERE OLD NAKED EUROPEAN MEN RUNNNNNING DOWN A BEACH. I saw many dangling penises flapping in the wind. puke. Oh yeah it doesn't help that part of the movie the twin brother and sister get so trashed they end up making out with eachother.&nbsp; Sorry if i "ruined" the movie for you. But I had to let that out so it wasn't on my mind all night.&nbsp; Can't wait till i dream tonight!!!! Im sure ill see human sized penises running or something. Sick. &nbsp; Angela also showed me the pictures she developed from the night...i mean day... of drunken happenings.&nbsp; You remember, when I posted with betsy... and it made no sense. Yeah well my first reaction was " we took pictures?!?!" ... Well my friends.. we did indeed take pictures. They are quite funny. One of them I look like the devil.&nbsp; Really I do. That is if the devil looks like a blond girl with blue eyes and is 5'2.&nbsp; But i also found a picture of angela and her friend paige... i was like "who is that" she then proceeded to explain to me that paige was in fact at her house that night. Hmmm... I must have been really "out of it".&nbsp; Oh well. &nbsp; Ok im going to go watch tv in this huge house all BY MYSELF while heather and dena go to concerts and hang out with my aunt flo and make out with eachother.. i mean do fun things? Yeah. Ok. Bye. I hate my life. HOLLA

 just wanted to say i'm here in boulder having a GREAT time!!! woo hoo. i feel bad for anyone who's NOT here. jk. but really i'm not, unless you want me to. i feel bad for my dad cuz he's stuck up in evergreen w/ the g-folks all day since my mom is working in denver. sucks to be him. &nbsp; we saw daren play two nights ago at a denver club called the blue mule . you all know he plays with the eels, but this was his local band and it's funny cuz it's a TOTALLY different type of music. this was a hip hop band w/ three rappers. they were REALLY good. it was fun..and one of the best parts was that me and heather were having blue moon all night!!--my fav. :) there was this artist there painting as part of the show and at first his picture was looking pretty cool with green and white shapes . then by the end it looked like crap with these ugly little faces and grafiti style writing all over it. we were VERY dissapointed. oh, and daren had a drum solo that was amazing...we all had orgasms when we heard it. &nbsp; betsy, have you checked your voicemail lately? i think you have a secret admirer...two, i think they're named micheal and michelle:) ti hee. i'll let you post about them when you hear them. &nbsp; alright well i'm gonna go continue having a GRRRRRRRREAT time. &nbsp; luv ya guys, d

 so heather- mike and I were cracking up when we saw those pictures... mike was like "Who is that??? It looks like meee!" haha. Funny stuff. &nbsp; Hmm, what to talk about? Well first, Saturday was a fun filled day.&nbsp; Woke up at 8:30, bc now im on that stupid "go to bed early, wake up early" schedule.&nbsp; Anyway so i figured i would get some shit done. Went to target, bought a whole bunch of things that i didn't need. But I have realized how much I LOVE target. I mean really, they are soo cheap and their stuff is so HIP its not even funny.&nbsp; I got the cutest light pink purse (cause i need ANOTHER purse...right?) it was only 7 DOLLARS! Yes, thats right. $7!&nbsp; Then i bought a bunch of makeup because it was only 2 dollars per item... lip gloss, mascara, eye shadow... all&nbsp;2 bucks. Granted, i did not need any new makeup.. but how could i resist such a great deal? Anyway, after that, i realized it was only 10:30 am and I didn't have anything else to do. So much for me running all my important errands right? Yah.&nbsp; So naturally i just went to subway and bought a sandwich. Mmm.&nbsp; This is pretty exciting stuff right?&nbsp; Finally after a day full of downloading music and making cd's, i went downtown to meet sara so we could go to the sarah mac concert.&nbsp; Man it was amazing.&nbsp; Really it was a great concert. I liked sarah mac before but she is 100 times better live! Mike was convinced that she was a lesibian with hairy armpits but I was able to prove him wrong, she has no hair underneath her arms and has a husband and a kid.... mike still claims this is a cover up. Whatever.&nbsp; I DID see quite a few lesbians though.&nbsp; I really dont care if someone is gay or not, if you are straight/homosexual, I DO NOT WANT TO SEE YOU MAKING OUT AND GROPING ALL NIGHT.&nbsp; It seems like the lesbians at this concert were ALL doing this! Yuck. PDA is only ok when I AM DOING IT! Anyway, sara and I had FLOOR seats and we were 16 rows back.&nbsp; It was coool.&nbsp; The girls sitting next to us were soo annoying.&nbsp; They got up every 3 seconds to buy more beer and wouldnt say "excuse me" as they went through, rather they would just yell out "Fat drunk girl with no beer coming through". She managed to say this everytime she passed by.&nbsp; Then the girl behind me decided it would be cool to lean forward in her seat so&nbsp;her head was like RIGHT behind me, and I was blessed with her nasty breath breathing on me all night. SICK.&nbsp; I didnt know what the horrible smell was at first but then one time i turned around to look at something and her face was in my face, i swear she was soo trying to make out with me.&nbsp; Isnt everybody?&nbsp; Yeah so the concert was lots-o-fun.&nbsp; Yesterday I didn't do much.. we watched hours of Family Guy and I watched the Starsky and Hutch DVD that angela bought me.&nbsp; Afterward we tried to play disc golf but it started raining on us on the 9th hole!&nbsp; Sucks. &nbsp; Oh yeah, as i was parking for work this morning i saw a bunch of pigeons in a group on the sidewalk.&nbsp; There was a lady there with bread feeding them.&nbsp; She was a BIRD LADY! I didnt know bird ladies actually existed.. but they do. I saw it with my own eyes.&nbsp; Anyway, Im going to go. DENA/HEATHER, hope your having fun WITHOUT ME. BIOTCHES. HOLLA

 urlLink Oh yeah, we stopped at a mickey-D's on the way to cali, and i was able to discreetly snap these quick shots of homeboy. Can you guess who's Mike and who's "mickey-D"?? (I sure can't tell the difference with that dirty-man molester moustache... haha!) shawna, you must be proud!! LOL LYLAS STAY SWEET!!

 urlLink ...I'm such a WAYNIAC!!

 urlLink daniel and me in Vegas, Baby! Posted by urlLink Hello

 Viva Las Vegas, y'all.&nbsp; Just got back from a fab vacation with Daniel.&nbsp; We flew to Vegas, stayed @ the MGM for a few nights, drove to Cal-i-forn-eye-ay, hit up the beach for a few days, then drove back to vegas and flew home yesterday! short and sweet.&nbsp; California was dreamy. Perfect weather, sexay surfers... mmmm.&nbsp; We were in Huntington Beach which calls itself "Surf City, U.S.A." so you KNOW it was HOTT!&nbsp; water was a little chilly, though.&nbsp; not like the 83-degree water in Roatan.&nbsp; next trip needs to be somewhere TROPICAL.&nbsp; except it won't be, since i'm probably going to go to NYC in august for a long weekend.&nbsp; I know, I know, y'all must be thinking, how many trips is this girl gonna go on??&nbsp; well, the answer is, nobody knows. i figure, as long as i don't have a job or anything else tying me down, live it up on back-to-back-to-back vacations, you know?!&nbsp; NYC should be fun.&nbsp; the pimp wedding band daniel plays with is flying all of them out to NYC for a wedding out there, so i thought i may as well go with them and make a vacation out of it.&nbsp; i like to make vacations out of EVERYTHING.&nbsp; Hell, this week i'm gonna have to "make a vacation" out of going to the G-folk's in evergreen (BORING) since that's where the floridas are (sans shawna).&nbsp; Shawna, you little hoodrat. you should have totally screwed that job o' yours and came to collie (colorado -- trying to make colorado sound as cool and exciting as "cali" haha).&nbsp; but seriously, it's just not gonna be the same without you. oh, and i met these hilarious australian boys in vegas who were there for a bachelor party weekend... they were so funny! they sat down next to me at the roulette table and kept calling one-dollar bills "Denzels" (as in Denzel Washington for George Washington on the $1) and twenties were "Jacko's" (as in Michael Jacko Jackson for Andrew Jackson on the $20), etc.&nbsp; and they quoted great movies like dumb and dumber and happy gilmore all night.&nbsp; anyway, i asked them about "bangs" being a naughty thing to say, and they said they never heard of it as being bad.&nbsp; they just never use it. okay, more later.

 Not!&nbsp; It's true, I still have one week left of camp.&nbsp; However, our residential camp is over, which is why I was without internet access and consequently disappeared off the face of the earth.&nbsp; Oh my, so let's see what I've been up to... Camp, camp, and more camp!&nbsp; It's been pretty stressful, but the good news is that I'm banking.&nbsp; Between camps, working in Chrissy's office, having babysat, and working at Soccer4All, I'm well on my way to saving up for my fifth year.&nbsp; Residential camp was actually a lot more fun than I thought it would be.&nbsp; Maybe because I've done a few and I know what to expect.&nbsp; I worked with Nicky this week, and we coached the older kids.&nbsp; I like working with Nicky b/c we get along really well, plus the kids were really fun too.&nbsp; Ashley found a cummerbun (sp?) on the ground the first day of camp, so I used it and gave it away as an award.&nbsp; The Golden Cummerbun was highly desired. Sue, you little shit.&nbsp; I thought for sure you were gonna pass, but when you took 93 years to tell us your grades, you were starting to freak me out.&nbsp; But yay!&nbsp; I'm so happy for you and proud.&nbsp; When you're rich, buy my art.&nbsp; Oh, about Mike.&nbsp; We hooked up.&nbsp; I'll leave it at that.&nbsp; Don't worry I'm still a not-so-proud member of the V-team though.&nbsp; In terms of being in love with him, I don't think anything is gonna come out of it in sober terms.&nbsp; It's just way too weird.&nbsp; Even for me.&nbsp; But he's a really fun guy...I had a great time last week.&nbsp; So as long as it stays fun, I'm all for it!&nbsp; Sorry if I'm inducing you to vomit.&nbsp; But you brought it up...&nbsp; Oh how was Florence?&nbsp; I'm starting to have doubts about going abroad, but I'm still seriously considering it.&nbsp; We'll see. Ok, I'm going back to work, and by work I mean reading my book.&nbsp; Bye! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; HOLLA

 Today is a great day for a few reasons 1. PAY DAY 2. ZERO chance of rain 3. It's FRRIIIIDAAAAAY Im so excited that the weekend is finally here. This morning on 94.5 the buzz the dj was talking about how he has Sunday Night Syndrome . This is when Sunday rolls around and instead of enjoying your day you spend the whole day stressing out about how you have to work the next day.&nbsp; I have sunday night syndrome hardcore. Seriously... I DREAD sunday because I know at 6:30 am monday morning I have to get up and drive an hour to work. EWWW i cringe just thinkin about it right now.&nbsp; Anyway ... sundays suck. So my dad, dena and brianna have left today to go to colorado for a vacation.&nbsp; My mom left wednesday.&nbsp; The house is all mine for a week or so.&nbsp; I'm really really bitter that i don't get to go. IF you couldn't tell already, since I have mentioned it every day since i found out.&nbsp; Like, my dad hounded me about getting a job, which is understandable, so I got one and that is why I'm stuck in H-Town.&nbsp; But dena, she never got harassed about it, and now she is on her way to colorado to have lots of sexy fun with h to the eather. (heather). BOOOOOOO! Oh well, at least he gave me $50 dollars for the week YAY! -that was sarchasm...50 bucks wont get me through the weekend... let alone a whole WEEK! Oh well, ill just think about the fun things i have to do this week... like the Sarah Mac (sarah Maclachlan) concert on saturday with sara. Sarah Mac is amazing.&nbsp; And that is the only fun thing I am doing ... Wednesday after work me dena and brianna went to astroworld.&nbsp; We were supposed to meet up with Kelcee but her phone got wet so I couldn't get ahold of her.&nbsp; Anyway, Im not a big fan of rollercoasters but I find enough things to ride to make the trip worth it.&nbsp; We did all the water rides first since it was 200 degrees outside.&nbsp; My favorite thing there is Diablo Falls, you get in a gigantic tube with 6 people and spin down a slide for a couple minutes. So much fun.&nbsp; On the log ride (or bamboo shoot) me and dena were totally screaming the whole way, and pretending like we were really scared. I definitley embarassed brianna when I began screaming out " I dont wanna go anymore...LET ME OFF, LET ME OFFF....NOOOOO I DONT WANNA GOOOO". &nbsp;&nbsp; I actually did this the whole time until we were finished.&nbsp; Good times. Hahah. We also took a hot picture on the way down, in which i look like im participating in a "Sure, Unsure?" commercial.&nbsp; After we graced all the rides i would go on we made a trip to the cd recording studio there.&nbsp; Me and Dena sang "Hey Yah" by outkast and "Me Myself and I" by beyonce.&nbsp; I DID NOT want to sing the beyonce song but dena really wanted to sing it so we did, I wanted to sing "shoop" by salt n peppa, buuuut noooooooooooo.&nbsp; Lets just say we aren't as good as beyonce ...or as good as any singer.&nbsp; Hey Yah was funny though, there was a typo on the lyrics they gave us so we kept messing up.&nbsp; ha.&nbsp; After this it started pouring down rain and I left to go home while brianna and dena stayed with my dad and rode all the big rides. not much else happened... umm yesterday mike and I went to a Peace Corp meeting to learn more about it... the speaker was so "valley girl" sounding.&nbsp; It was hard to think that she actually survived living in west africa for 2 years in a shack... but oh well.&nbsp; Anyway I found out that I def. am not Peace Corp material... i dont think i could survive. As much as I would love to do something like that for other people... i need my city, and my fast food, and my electricity. Im such a snobby american. Mike on the other hand is really interested.&nbsp; (That is why we went).&nbsp; I think its a cool thing to do (they pay your med. and dental insurance and give you a stipend) ... but i dont want him to be gone for TWO YEARS in some third world country. Hmmmm. Oh well... I guess ill survive. Anyway, Im gonna go.&nbsp; Sue, betsy says "yay" about your grades... i talked to her the other day and she is at camp and doesn't have the internet....&nbsp; I have decided to have Lyrics of the day: ...I wanna know...how does it hang? Straight up, wait up, hold up mister lover. Like prince said your a sexy mother...., I like em real wild, B-Boy style by the mile..... &nbsp; HOLLA

 so today my project at work is to call all the "barge lines" listed in the yellow pages and ask them if they are interested in bidding on a barge we have for sale! OMG this is taking forever. I have already talked to like a million people!! Boss man says i can't leave until i finish so im bustin my butt so i can get off by one.&nbsp; Why im blogging if im so busy you ask? Well im on hold right now with some company and they have the most awesome hold music... right now im listening to 'Goodtimes' ... ooh good times. anyway im bored.. and tired of waiting.... oh crap..gotta go. Sue what pics you talking about? and also im SUPER COOL. HOLLA. HOLLA again.

 &nbsp; post your freaking pictures

 HOLLA. well kiddos, i think a huge congratulations is in order. shawna is ineed the most dedicated blogger that there ever was. I am not sure if that makes her a supreme loser or super cool. for now, we'll say shes super cool. yay for the floridas moving to azerbaijan. yay for you coming to visit me! you MUST. also, of course there is reason for you to go back to Klein--some one needs to take care of my mom. she can be your surrogate mom. or just that crazy old&nbsp; lady who gives you alcohol.&nbsp; either way, theres reason to visit to the ol' KHS (insert fight song here) oh hail all hail.... ok, so i have been working my arse off and it turns out that i have saved like zero money. i am officially screwed. my rent is due in 10 days and i REALLY am going to be scraping by to get it. this whole living on your own thing is waaaay overrated. especially when you have to buy alot of shit for your house and eat and pay bills and all that madness. argh. plus, i am going to italy next week and i am trying to pay for that all by myself as well and basically, i am poor and might be homeless. super. besty, blog. i want to know how you got home when you went out with my brother. if you left your car there... basically me, liza, and liberal amie decided that you guys did it (i consequently threw up) and that you are both soooo weird that its ok. either way, i want to know. i am going to florence in a few days!! are you jealous--ill tell you all about it and if i think that thats where you should study. so, on thursday a week i am leaving for italy and since i have NO money, liberal amie and i decided that we are going to sleep in train stations. i am quite excited about this as it will be cool to say " i slept in a train station". i have spent the night on the floor of an airport before but i feel like the train station will be the lowest of the low. funny how i think i am poor but i am still a snotty nosed american that back packs around europe. NO dammit, thats NOT me. i work long ass 60 hour weeks and eat soup and onions for dinner everynight and support myself so PISS OFF. im allowed to say i am poor. (ya hear that shawna, if all those lame ass poor people on the side of the road would just go out and develop a marketable skill, they too could be struggling to get by in the most expensive city in the western world...screw the poor) hmmm, well this election stuff seems like its pretty heavy. i need to do my absentee ballot form soon and frankly i am little apprehensive. this is my first presidential election and i feel as if i may be truly challenged to make the proper decision. since my vote counts more than everyone elses--well....it should-- i feel it may take some time for me to weigh out the different sides. let me sum up my important political values for you so you know what type of dilemma i will be facing: -i am pro-abortion (yes, you read right, i am all FOR killing babies), but anti-pro-choice (unless, i got pregnant in which case I would abort the MFer faster that the semen that got it there) -i am for a small government with a HUGE military so we can take over the world, start a dynasty and colonize france (bunch of wine sipping pussies) -I am still for the war, and i would have no problem if we went to war with all of the middle east (theyve ruined their own farm land and in twenty years will have no oil left so we might as well take them over so we still&nbsp;can have a cheap labour supply in 2050--it will be hard to acheive cheap labour in america if the democrats take over and stop the infamous exploitation of the lower classes that made america the success that it is today) -all i care about is money and i want tax cuts -all i care about is money and W will appoint better people to the FED and smarter economists -all i care about is money and REALLY the economy and politics shouldnt go together, they should be seperate...so it doesnt matter&nbsp; - i would prefer a president that can pronounce multisyllabic words (NOT a necessity though) -people say that your president should look good to the rest of the world but i say thats a load of cock bollocks because WE ARE THE WORLD (we are the children...) and what we say goes, if you have a problem with that screw you, we'll just stop buying your shit. ha HA. and on that note, i will continue to sell my soul to THE MAN and hope that one day i can be a proper capitalist and exploit people ;) cheers!

 HOLLA...so i don't have time to type...well, i do, but i'm too tired to do it now so i'm gonna go watch a movie..i just wanted to say to shawna: post our lovely kareoke up on here so the other bfffffff's can hear it....ummmm let me just say we kind of suck. it's me and shawna singing "hey ya" (outkast) and "me, myself, and i" (beyonce k). ummmm....first off....we suck at being talented black singers...second of all....we just suck at singing. alright, i'm out. d oh yeah, we're going to colorado on friday...this was just decided today (wednesday) so see you saturday or sunday heather! haha...we're so random w/ our vacations.

 dont be scared, that aint 5-0, that the funk yo, dont act like you didnt know, thats just the way it goes &nbsp; its time to be wiiiild, freeeeestyle -B.E.P is da boooombdiggity &nbsp; i just downloaded myself many of my fave tunes ... some old school...some new school, either school is cool with me, im gettin jiggy with it in my casa since everyone else is gone (naked you ask??? i guess you'll never know).&nbsp;After tomorrow I'll be in the house ALONE for more than a week... i aint scuurrred.&nbsp; Ok im not posting long because nobody else has posted so sucks to your arsma! &nbsp; HOLLA

 You know what sucks? (Besides the fact that im such a loser that I am the only one who blogs, and I do it twice a day) &nbsp; The fact that my family is INDEED MOVING TO AZERBAIJAN!!!! Azerbaijan??? Who goes to azerbaijan?! Nobody i tell you. I think it's a made up country. It must be.&nbsp; I sure don't remember learning about it in my High school geography class. But then again, did I learn ANYTHING in that class? My teacher was an ASSISTANT football coach... that doesn't say much.&nbsp; Ok anyway Im a little excited/sad/curious about the news.&nbsp; First it will be cool to get to go on a trip twice a year (even if it is Azerbi-sexual).&nbsp;&nbsp; Plus this means more likelyhood of me stopping in London to see Sui and my old friends from good ole ACS.&nbsp; But then again, I won't have any family around me. Well except of course my sister sara who I will be living with.&nbsp; And it will suck that I dont have an excuse to come home to klein.... as much as I think klein sucks and has nothing to do, it is like paradise compared to downtown H-town.&nbsp; I dont know. The whole thing is weird for me because everytime my parents have moved to other countries I have gone along... and now im too old and grown up.&nbsp; I dont wanna grow up. Im still a toys R us kid.&nbsp; Ahhhh...oh well.&nbsp; Im sure they will move back to klein in like 6 months. I really wouldnt be surprised considering that happens like everytime.&nbsp; Woah. This is kind of an emotional blog. Ha.&nbsp; &nbsp; Like i said earlier, Mike and I went to play disc golf in the woodlands after i got off work.&nbsp; So first we went to academy and mike bought me a disc golf bag and three of my very own discs!! This is exciting... really. Disc Golf is like the new "Getting Wasted". Its true. Totally cool. You should do it....EVERYONE is doing it.&nbsp; C'mon...just try it......&nbsp; anyway peer pressure aside... back to my story.&nbsp; So we get to the woodlands course and we start playing.&nbsp;&nbsp; I end up playing pretty good at first.... I was at Par on the first two i think. Which is good because I normally get more par then mike but this time we had the same par (i did get to be closer to the basket tho).&nbsp; But, by the end, I kept doing WORSE AND WORSE.&nbsp; Like, one time i had an AWESOME THROW, but my disc ended up hitting a tree.&nbsp; The next time i threw it, it hits one tree...then the one next to it..then the one behind it...and seriously, it ended up like right back at me.&nbsp; Long story short, I ended up with TWENTY NINE over par... (so much for my VIGOROUS ASS-KICKING RIGHT?).&nbsp; Mike was 3 over par. He is good at Disc Golf.&nbsp; I, on the other hand, am not. But i still have my own disc set so I will one day make it to the PDGA Pro Tour and I will call my self "Shooter McGaven".&nbsp; Ok. Enough. &nbsp; I bought the first two seasons of Family Guy today (i already had the third) So we are going to watch that now. But no worries, im sure ill be back in like 10 minutes to reply to my own f-in post since Im the only one on here. HOLLA

 HOLLA &nbsp; sooo, dad found out today that moscow is CANCELLED, but he is DEFINATELY going to azerbaijan...so, sorry shawna, but we have to go vacation there. good news is...we can stop in london and visit SUE!!! yes it's true. when they move....they're gonna stop in paris for a while. even though i don't really like paris...i wouldn't mind going still. and yeah, we are going to colorado on thursday!! surprise heather! well, we're leaving here thursday so we won't get there till sat. cuz we're driving. good news is, it'll just be me, brianna and my dad...so lot's of sleeping room!!! woo hoo. shawna, just ask your boss to come. i doubt he'll mind. you can just do the work from a laptop or something. &nbsp; ummmm, garage sale is the week we get back from colorado. i'm going to go sell some books right now and get a little cash. talk to you biotches later . &nbsp; d

 UMMM. Y'all suck! &nbsp; this blog is so boring... somebody write something . My life is hardly interesting yet I still post! DENA I KNOOOW&nbsp; you dont do ANYTHING... so at least you should be writing in here.&nbsp; &nbsp; Mike and I are going to play Disc Golf in the Woodlands today after i get off work. Its gonna be fuuun. Hopefully i get better than 27 as my score.&nbsp; 27 is bad... i played with mike dena and los and they all had like 5, 6 and 7.... and there I was with 27. I sucked. But now that I have been training daily with my vigorous workouts I should be able to kick some ass. I havent really been training.. i just wanted to use the word vigorous in a sentence. VIGOROUS. &nbsp; My parents decided YESTERDAY that they want to go on vacation THIS THURSDAY for a week in colorado... this is nice and all but I cant go because I have to work.&nbsp; A little warning would have been nice... my dad told me yesterday and acted like I would be able to go no problem. Im sorry but I don't think my boss would appreciate it ... "Uhh hi boss... im going on vacation in 2 days and I'll be gone for a week... so see ya later".&nbsp; I wanted to come see HEATHER and not stay at Grandma's the whole time we are there.. haha. Maybe I can come up another time. This will be my first summer of not going on vacation since I was like 2 years old. How sad.&nbsp; I will have the house all to myself though! Not that it matters. &nbsp; Sara bought a house, the one I am going to live in with her. I haven't seen it but she says its pretty cool... 3 bedrooms huge back yard... I honestly dont care what its like. I just need somewhere to live next year.&nbsp; We are moving in August 1-3... so come to our housewarming party... its the place to be. &nbsp; So my parents still dont know where the hell they are moving yet... either russia or azerbaijan still... im crossing my fingers its not azerbaijan. 1. because i dont really feel a need to go on vacation in the middle east in a country that I have never heard of... and 2. because I dont want to go on vacation in the middle east in a country that i have never heard of.&nbsp; Oh did i just say the same thing twice? Yeah, i realized i didn't have a number two... but basically the middle east sucks. (for vacationing).&nbsp; &nbsp; oh looks like its time for me to go. Im off work. WOO HOOOOO. See how much I get done at work??? This Blog is Many paragraphs long! Im so productive. &nbsp; p.s angela and I discovered that if the Tour of Italy sucked the first time you have it... it will probably suck every time after that. &nbsp; HOLLA

 So all 3 employees that I work with have gone to lunch... and they left me ALONE in the office. It's kind of exciting... and kinda sad that I have to sit here for another hour by myself while everyone else is EATING. ahhh. I want food. &nbsp; I called mike about 10 minutes ago and Stephen (his roomie) answered the phone, so i figured since I'm at work... I need to use my professional voice on the phone. When he answered I was like "HI, THIS IS SHAWNA FROM COMEX INTERNATIONAL, CAN I SPEAK WITH MICHAEL PLEASE" ... p.s caps= me talking in an overly cheery voice. Stephen just laughed because he knew it was me and that Im sooo not cheery. ha. I love my fake voice. If you ever get bored call up my work and you'll hear me answer. Im sure it will be a short filler for some entertainment. &nbsp; Have yall ever had Gatorade extremo ? Becuase we have 500 gallons of that shit at work and I drink it because.. well im thirsty and I would rather not drink houston water... and it makes me feel sick.&nbsp; What does Extremo mean? Is it spanish gatorade? Im confused. And why does it make me feel like I swallowed too much aspirin? &nbsp; that was indeed random. &nbsp; Sue its nice to see you are back online. Its about freakin time.&nbsp; B+ , goodjob. In shawna land that is really an A.&nbsp; So good job on acing your tests.&nbsp; &nbsp; Angela i do not hate you. I just slightly dislike you. KIDDING, I have been off the market since I started working. I do not do anything. I work. Eat. Sleep. Work. Eat. Sleep. This is why all my blogs are utterly boring lately. SO don't take it personally. Plus i already told you my phone is a piece... it only works when it feels like it. Really it works less than it doesnt work. Im working on getting a new one. &nbsp; Ok anyway, I am getting paid friday. I can't wait. I need money ... bad. 352 dollars should be my next check. Not too shabby. &nbsp; everyone blog. &nbsp; FWSS; &nbsp; that is my new language.&nbsp; hint... that says HOLLA...

 HOLLA back young un. Yukon Dewitt--where did you learn to speak/type/write like that. Normally I would explain to you just how lame you are BUT it must take you like half an hour to go and translate the normal english words into some ghett0 phoenetic slang. quite impressive actually and your dedication to ebonics is noteworthy&nbsp;(despite the overwhelming lameness). &nbsp; ok kiddos...the moment youve all been waiting for...MY grades ( i know, i know, its REALLY had you on the edge fo your seats). well i got all B+ 's--which is quite good considering they dont give As (they probably did, but only to hot hayden with the speaking voice from heaven and to some nerd that did even more work than me). sooooooooo, i get to stay. and EVERYONE gets to come vist me...BETSY and FLORIDAS (heather, that includes you...youre an adjunct florida) &nbsp; ok, i am sneaking in writing this while i am work, but dont worry, i get internet tomorrow so i can write from home and let you know all about my insane life as a bartender/data administrator (the former job, though it pays less is where most of the insanity lies). i am in love with my life right now because i live in the coolest place ever--betsy would love it because its soooo bohemian--and i have the most bad ass house that there ever was and our kitchen is just the happiest place on earth. i also intend to seduce my neighbour--the burly constuction man . grrrrr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ummm ok, here it goes. this is what i want from YOU &nbsp; dena--when do you back ot indiana? shawna-hows the knee?? heather, pictures dammit! and little miss betsy---hello HI!&nbsp; what went down with my bro??? how is he?? i havent talked to him in aaaaaaages? is raul good looking--i hear about him all the time? you must meet mikes friend&nbsp; with the yacht. hes yummy. unless of course you are in love with my brother ;) gross. &nbsp; ok, i must go and pretend like i am working but really just wishing that i could crawl uner my desk and sleep . ahhh sleep, i miss sleep. &nbsp; out. &nbsp; liberal amie is coming to visit me tomorrow!!!

 HOLLA &nbsp; So i have been completely bored for the past week and the only thing i have done is write papers for my internet english class thrilling i swear!&nbsp; I've tried to call shawna but she doesnt reutrn my calls i think she hates me and is avoiding me... it makes me sad... right now i am procrastinating writing a paper i dont wanna do it... anyone wanna write my papers for me? i will pay you, it will be fabulous i swear... well i dont have anything else to say, oh i cant download that hello thing cause daddy says im not alowed to download anything on this computer cause he just got rid of some viruses on it... Lata tricks, call me people im beyond bored!

 urlLink everyone, Picasa/Hello is sweeeeeet. sign up NOW or me an' shawna will have to regulate. holla. Posted by urlLink Hello

 urlLink mike over the hurdle&nbsp; urlLink

 Finally Blogger decided to make bloggin more exciting! Its about FREAKIN time!&nbsp; Yay for being able to blog in pink. &nbsp; So, heather I have ALREADY downloaded all the cool new tools from google/blogger.... and im already a nerd who invited yall...so sign up so we can chat on "Hello!'. Hahaha. My user name is : shawnaflorida .&nbsp; Complicated I know. &nbsp; So the past two days i have been sick.&nbsp; Like almost puking sick.&nbsp; My back hurt.. my stomach, my head. All of it. And it sucked. I ended up callin in sick to work friday because i felt so shitty.&nbsp; Yesterday there was a track meet at Rice U.&nbsp; Mike Los and our friend Sesar entered EVERY EVENT. Thats right...EVERY SINGLE ONE.&nbsp; From the 100 m dash to the 3k.&nbsp; It was very entertaining to see them do the hurdles and&nbsp;4X4.&nbsp; Lets just say they are all painfully sore today.&nbsp; &nbsp; I posted a picture ABOVE... &nbsp; Ok anyway i think i might go lay out and then run or something. Im finally not sick!! Yay. &nbsp; HOLLA &nbsp;

 HOLLA&nbsp; So I went to Hurricane Hut/Surf Shack/whatever last night with Mike and his friend Raul and it ruled!&nbsp; The wings were free from 5-8, and they were awesome.&nbsp; And the drinks were super cheap, and I therefore got hammered.&nbsp; The bad news is I went to pick up my car the next day, and someone broke into it.&nbsp; All my cd's are gone and they took two of my backpacks full of stuff.&nbsp; Why I don't know.&nbsp; My gross running shoes were in there and a bunch of dirty clothes.&nbsp; Yeah so that really sucks.&nbsp; Luckily I put the check I got for this week's camp in my purse, so they didn't take that. &nbsp; I think I'm getting sick.&nbsp; I can feel it coming.&nbsp; Dun dun dun! &nbsp; So that's about it with me.&nbsp; Residential camp starts tomorrow.&nbsp; Hell on earth.

 girlzzzz, you'd all be so proud of me.&nbsp; i've been trying to get it in good with michael "the legs" olague so he'll invite me to join his dew/running blog.&nbsp; doin' the dew just hasn't happened yet, BUT i HAVE been running almost every single day!&nbsp;&nbsp;this is HUGE, y'all!!&nbsp;&nbsp;right now i have a nice little 3-mile loop along the Boulder Creek path, but each time&nbsp;I try and go a little bit farther.&nbsp; now, i&nbsp;know 3 miles a day is NOTHING to&nbsp;the rest of you, but for lil' ole me, it's an accomplishment to write home about.&nbsp; but since i already LIVE at home, it wouldn't make sense to write home about anything, which is why i'm writing my bloggas. holla.&nbsp; the only problem so far is that all of my runs happen in the dead of night. we're talkin' midnight or even 1:00 am!&nbsp; is this bad for the metabolism??&nbsp; cause it seems like sometimes after running that late and then going to bed, i can't fall asleep for HOURS.&nbsp; but other times i crash right out and sleep like a baby.&nbsp; all i know is that midnight running is the best.&nbsp; (don't worry, daniel runs with me, so i'm safe.) &nbsp; i'm leeeaaa-viiiiiin', oooon a jeeet plaaaaane. don't knooow when iiiii'll be baaaaack agaaaiiiin. yep, flyin' to VEGAS, BABY on sunday, staying at the good ole MGM till tuesday, driving to Cali for a couple of days, then back to vegas and then home. should be GRRRRRREEAAAT!&nbsp; i'm bringing my sweet laptop, so hopefully i'll be able to blog all of my adventures. &nbsp; wow it's so late. i'z gottzta getz to BED, foo. &nbsp; -h &nbsp; p.s. i love Google! go to Google's homepage right now and get urlLink Picasa , if you haven't already.&nbsp;it's awesome.&nbsp; also get urlLink Gmail while you're at it.&nbsp; (Google's brand spankin' new email!! they offer, get this: 1 GIG of space for your email acount with them! and since google owns blogger.com, we get to test it out before it goes public to the rest of the world!!&nbsp; get it while you can!! just sign into blogger dashboard and there's a link to sign up on the right!)

 HOLLA Sorry you little shits, I've been super busy with camp. Exhausted if you know what I mean. Plus, every time I was about to write a blog, my computer would shut down. So anyway... I think I'm getting sick. Yesterday and the day before I was in a horrible mood, and today I'm in a great mood. That happens to me when I'm about to get sick. Plus I'm starting to feel achy. Tonight I'm going to this place off Richmond with Mike (Sue's brother) to eat free wings from 5-8 and $1 beer if anyone wants to come! Just call me. Sue...grades??? You're making me antsy. Sorry this has to be so quick but I'm at a public computer and I feel bad staying here a long time. So I'm out.

 The following is based on a true story. Only the names locations and events have been changed. yall, Im dying. Just kidding... but not really. Ok yah im kidding. Yesterday all day my teeth were throbbing...they didnt necessarily hurt, but they just felt like they were shifting... and they were uncomfortable. Anyway so Mike lent me some of him hydro-codine that he has for his tooth... I took half of one at 6 and a whole one again at like 10:30. So i like passed out last night. Well now i feel like puking. And it is that kind of sick where the puke doesnt want to come out but you can feel it in there. Whats with me coming to work on drugs and alcohol? I dont know... but i could really use a long bath and 48 hours of sleep. This sucks. I am going to drink some coffee and see if that helps. Probably wont. Yesterday i got online to see if my summer school grades were posted on my records yet... guess what? My chemistry prof gave me a B-!!!!! YAY. I totally didnt EARN a B- ... i didnt even earn a D- ... it must have been the sex. But really, I was supposed to get a C+ and I guess he decided I was worth a B-. Yippee Hooray. Now when i tell people what my grade was in chemistry they will think i actually knew what was going on it there. Im so smart it amazes me. The other night me mike and kelcee went and saw anchorman....for the SECOND time. Oh man, i love that movie. Just thinking about it makes me laugh. Seriously...yesterday at work I was thinking about the part when Brick was like "I stabbed a man in the heart" ... i just started LOLing like no other. This one part was one of those "semi" funny parts where in your head your like 'Hey that was funny'... but you dont laugh because it takes too much energy. Well that part kelcee LOLed...and i mean LOLLLLLLL.She was the only one laughing and her laugh is so distinctive I just started cracking up... she thought i was laughing at the movie but i was in fact laughing at her laughing at the non-laughable part of the movie. Ohhh kicker... what a character. My knee continues to hurt. I am going to see the trainer today to figure out if im allowed to keep running. The problem is that the pain is not where it was before when i got surgery so there is a possibility i have A DIFFERENT injury. This is sad. I hope hope hope i dont have to redshirt again. Not that i would mind not having to wake up at 5 am every day for practice... but I love competing...and traveling....plus i have already taken part in one too many fundraisers for our hawaii trip to just sit it out. Im going to hawaii and thats final. I went to kelcee's Klein CC practice on tuesday night to go running. It was interesting how little everyone looks. I mean, seriously... the ONLY person on the team who looks remotely like they belong in highschool is Kelcee...and she doesnt even look old. Maybe im just too old to be hanging around highschoolers..? Haha that could be it. But even with my injured knee i kicked all their asses...except kelcee of course who i was trying to keep up with. In my head i was like thinking 'i dont care if my leg falls off... none of these 12 year olds can beat me.' Fortunatley my leg is still intact. Work has been kinda crazy the past couple of days. Its like i have one project after another. I like it that way though. I hate when i run out of things to do because then I get bored. One of my projects was to take a stack of business cards and enter all the info into our website. So he hands me a stack of ALL MIDDLE EASTERN business-men ... there are like 100 of them at least. This is fun and all but no joke this is one of the names: Ali A. M. Bin Saleem Al Tunaijee .... yes... this is a fact. In our website there is a box for First name and then a box for last name.... but there are NOOOO boxes for first second third fourth and fifth MIDDLE NAMES!! I was very confused as to how i should handle that. But i just put half of it as a first name and the other half as a last name. hahaha crazy middle eastern names. Yeah so needless to say im not even halfway done with that project.... Anyway i really should go do what im getting paid to do. People: BLOG. Sue nice to see your alive... how are the grades? OMG BETSY... where the f are you? Heather? BIOTCH. HOLLA

 HOLLA...so last night i was down town and so went out to the city to party it up with the all star baseball game crowd. all i have to say is new orleans bourbon street. that's basically what it was down there....and it was tons of fun. did some salsa dancing....had a few tequila shots....some wheat ale...and a pitcher of strawberry margaritas!!! could it BE any better? well, dancing was fun and i saw the biggest dog ever...i'm not even kidding (maybe i thought this b/c i was drunk) but when i passed the white dog with black spots, i thought it was a cow and had to do a double take. i was thinking why is there a cow standing outside of a bar in downtown houston??? well, turns out it in fact was NOT a cow, it was just a freakin HUGE dog. haha...i took a picture next to it, but it doesn't look very big in the picture. oh well. oh, so we took the metro to get in the city....but then when it came to going home at 3am, the next metro wasn't till 4:30am....being drunk and not wanting to wait around...we decided to walk. now let me just say after an hour and a half of walking by bums and seeing 50 cabs go by...we finally decide to catch a cab so we don't have to walk 4 more miles drunk. if we would have walked...that would have been long. not to mention my shoes were killing me so i was walking around downtown barefoot...oops. my feet were black when i got home. anyways, good news is it was SUPER FUN...bad news is...i had a terrible hangover this morning from the tequila...DAMN THAT TEQUILA. on a different subject...i may have a gig tomorrow night as the drummer of a band....now for those of you who don't know me....i don't play the drums; nor have i ever. i have never had lessons and i don't know what i'm doing...but the main guy said i can learn a couple of the songs and play for him tomorrow night if i want. haha. this'll be good. alright...time to hop in the jacuzzi for a while....it's my nightly tradition:) d sue, how'd your grades end up?

 HOLLA--what up girls. i just thought id let you know what i am going through at this very moment--i find out my grades in 30 minutes...i feel naseous. i am FREAKING out. my ENTIRE life rests on what happens in the next half hour. eeeek. i feel like i am going to up chuck all over my desk. quick update: in lurf with my neighbour some economist i met at a party wants to have my babies and we are going do start "doing lunch and museums" together. i have the most kick ass wall hanging there ever was--im going to get a pic on line somehow i am going to vomit. i love my house. you ALL have to come visit--SERIOUSLY time to hurl out

 HOLLA dont worry i am alive--im just doing that working 50 hours a week and moving in all at the same time and i dont have internet thing. not that i dont have time for my bloggas, but..i dont. this has to be quick because i have to go and meet my flat mates at school so we can spend money that i dont have and buy shit. woohoo. i have stories that i will write tomorrow

 at work, so i can't write much. But after listening to 94.5 the Buzz on the radio this morning I was informed about this colan cleansing kit the DJ was testing.... they gave out the web address and after visiting it I think I might puke. But i thought I would pleasure yall with the website so you can throw up too. urlLink Happy Cleansing! This looks likes something betsy would appreciate! Ok im going to finish up...30 more minutes! HOLLA

 so, today was the biweekly UH car wash to raise money for cross country. since i have no life and no job and nothing better to do...i decided to help shawna's team out...and volunteer at the car wash. so we all wore our sexy new bathingsuits (heather you know how these car washes go)...and then "my milkshake brings all the boys to the yard..." (those of you who have seen dodgeball will understand how that quote is relevant). no, but seriously, the girls were not allowed to wash the car because we had to go look sexy and attract cars to come in on the corner of the street in our bikinis. we were sooooo good that we got a girl in a mini cooper to get her CLEAN car washed in the rain...haha. we're SEX. oh, and i was standing on the corner (no not like a prostitute) and this car pulls up to me with the window up. i show him the "car wash" sign and motion for him to pull in for a car wash. he proceeds to give me the grrrrrrr claw with his hand (you know like grrrrrrr...you're a sex kitten)....so just trying to pull in the business....i pull out the grrrr claw too (see heather's webshots "galveston" pictures for an example...i'm doing it there). anyways, after thinking we're both playfully flirting...he rolls down his window and is like...umm, no, i meant it is about to rain (and he does the same grrr claw as he's saying it--so the claw was his sign for rain)....ooops....i felt a little stupid...but you know what...that guy pulled in and donated 10 bucks, so i guess it worked!! haha..how embarrassing. then, shawna came over and we were in a little slump (not b/c shawna came over though), so i was like...hey hold your sign abover your head and start jumping and bouncing around.....you know...bouncing in a bathingsuit...that is bound to attract some guy customers. she does it...but i guess since we were in the gay part of town..the guys were more interested in the guy on the team wearing the straw hat than shawna. oh well. alright, i guess that's all i got. heather, the concert sounds awesome. sue..are you alive? please confirm that you're not dead. betsy, wanna go downtown to the mainstreet events tomorrow night or tuesday night...htere are a bunch of free concerts and beer and food. it might be fun. i think the allstar game is on tues night(?) oh and if kate is still in town we should still go to new orleans..i wanna go before i head to indiana. shawna, you live w/ me so i don't have much to say to you. angela, remember the quota on drunk insights...once/week (at LEAST). jaime, if you remember this sight...make a post. late, d

 HOLLA Oh dear...three weeks straight of camp starting tomorrow...actually I have to get up super early so this is gonna be quick. I don't really have much to say except I was watching the Olympic trials today for swimming, and one of the swimmers' names was Misty Hyman. Ha. That's it. Goodnight girls.

 HOLLA "you pooped in the fridge?......you ate a wheel of cheese?....i'm not even mad at you...that's AMAZING!" "we're laughing.....and we're enjoying our friendship....laughing, enjoying our fondness" these are just a few quotes from the movie....GO SEE IT...and GO SEE IT AGAIN cuz it's great. you will love it if you liked dodgeball, old school...etc. well, i just wanted to say that the movie was good....drunk and not drunk...but FREAKIN HILLARIOUS if you've had a few beers in your system. :) d

 I know i said i was on strike until all three of you, dena heather AND SUE posted but i ruined that already when i decided to get drunk at 5 oclock in the afternoon. (Which caused me to post a very funny, unreadable post at midnight). Anyway i thought i would be nice and excuse the fact that i still havent heard seen or made out with sue in like ..... a month !!!! Its sad. WHERE ARE YOOOOU SUUUUUEEE? Even ANGELA is posting more than you.... hopefully that gets you some inspiration to post. Well I'll start out by telling you how I got so drunk that my typing skills were that of a 2 year old. Thursday after work, Me and Angie met up at the OG for some italian goodness (mmmmm breadsticks). We decided to have a fun day at the pool with some margaritas because her sis had just bought her some margarita mix. Well we ended up sitting by the pool with the margaritas and instead of swimming...we just kept drinking. No swimming occurred but ALOT of drinking did. It was only 6:30 when i realized that i was gettin a buzz. Sooo 7 and 8 roll around and we are still drinking. I just want to say for the record that I DID NOT PLAN on getting drunk NOR was it my goal.... its not like highschool when everybody plans ways in which they will get trashed.... we simply wanted a couple of margaritas. And a couple turned into a few. And then when the margaritas ran out we switched to the parrot bay..... mm that was good. Anyway by 8 i was definitley drunk i think. Angies Boy toy Adam was there and I called a couple of his frat brothers to inform them that they were impregnating girls.... betsy came over and I called her Saudi Arabian friend and told him to eat my whopper (he thought it was betsy). Anyway it was kind of embarassing when mike came to pick me up at 10 and I was trashed beyond belief.... i mean i have never gotten drunk that early in the day. So after he picks me up we go back to my house and bets and I are really drunk so we decide that it was a good time to blog. And that we did. I dont remember why we were talking about half that stuff but just so you know the "Spot Eliminator" we kept referencing is this carpet stain removal shit that was sitting on the computer desk....so we thought we would give it some props. Anyway that night was fun and all, but Shawna had work at 8am! So i get up at 6:30 and im still drunk. GO to work...still drunk, in fact i was drunk at work for at least a couple of hours. Haha. After working TEN HOURS (i was exhausted) i went to mikes and we met up bets angela carlos dena and sara at the drafthouse and saw the movie anchorman. IT WAS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO FUNNY. Im not exaggerating in any way shape or form, I havent laughed that hard in a looong time. It really is hilarious. I reccommend it to anyone. And I WAS NOT under any type of influence and I still think its the funniest movie. SO GO SEE IT. Will Ferrel is so awesome... he needs to get some kind of award for his awesomeness. Movie Quote: "I love scotch, scotch scotchy scotch, there is goes down, down into my belly" Ok enough of that...just remember to go see it. Today me sara dena and my mom went to look at houses again for sara and I. We found one that is 2-story 3 bedroom with a pool. It pretty cool, It is cheap because it was a foreclosure and it has one of those big porches like in the southern houses that have the porch swing int he front... its cute. Anyway sara is putting in an offer so hopefully we get it. Heatha, nice to see your ALIVE. My parents are still unsure of where they are moving...all we know is that they ARE moving and it will be either Baku, Azerbaijan or Moscow Russia. We'll know in the next couple of weeks. Ok well im gonna go. BUT, sue if you are reading this..... i hope you post soon.... im getting sad. :( now im crying and .... i think i might go overdose on pills.............. dun dun dun HOLlasna

 OMG Don's family is FINALLY GONE! Don't get me wrong, i luv em to death and they're such a good time, but man, all I've done with my time since i got back from h-town is HANG WITH FAMILY! yeeeahh. no time for myself. or my bloggas. HOLLA. hopefully i'm back, and i won't let y'all down again. The John Mayer concert was INCREDIBLE. Daniel bought us tickets for Wednesday night and the venue was urlLink Red Rocks , and lemme just say this: if you've never seen a concert @ Red Rocks, drop everything right now, logon to ticketmaster, and by some frickin' tickets to go see someone there! ANYONE! I don't care if it's MEATLOAF, just make sure you get there! (well, if betsy saw meatloaf @ redrocks, she'd probably DIE from ORGASMIC CONVULSIONS, but, you know.) The weather was perfect, cloudy at first but it cleared up and the stars came out and it was so beautiful. Our seats were great (you can't get a BAD seat at this place.) Maroon 5 opened, and they were pretty good, but OMG as soon as john mayer came out with his band and they started their 1st song, it was like night and day between them and M5. They sounded better than on their CDs! incredible! John is sexy. he does this little groove where he thrusts his pelvis into his guitar as he plays, and i about lost it! haha! i don't think he's that hot in the face, but anyone who can play guitar like that is sex-ay as hell to me. So, people everywhere were "torchin' up the J" as daniel called it, all around us. Pot on our left, right, in front, and behind, and everyone kept offering it to us. we declined. i hate pot, and daniel quit smoking over a year ago, so that wouldn't have been a good thing. and homeboys to our left were tokin' the ganj AND smoking cigars, and the combo stench made me sick to my stomach, but it soon passed. all in all, GREAT experience. it was both of our first times seeing a concert in red rocks, and the fact that is was john mayer made it even better. we were sitting in the car after the concert, stuck in traffic trying to leave the park, and daniel was like, "man, when that first song started, i seriously almost started crying!" and i was like, "why?? were you sad?" and he said, "No, i wasn't sad at all. i just couldn't handle it; it was so good." haha! good times. my boyfriend is sexy. well, my next little vay-cay is gonna be to Long Beach, California! with a stop in Vegas, of course! haha! the truth is, daniel has never been to cali, and he got some time off of work, but it was too short planning time to fly into the LBC, way to expensive, so it's actually a ton cheaper to fly into vegas and then rent a car and drive the four hours to Long Beach. plus, we needed an excuse to go to vegas again. we leave in about a week, so i'm excited. we have a really good friend who lives in longbeach, so it'll be fun to see her while we're there. went for a midnight run last night with daniel on the boulder creek path. so nice. temp was perfect, no noise, no people. i think i'm getting better, cause i only stopped twice to walk and get water (instead of my usual 371 stops). hey all you runners out there: how do you stretch? i mean, do you stretch before, or do you run some to warm up and THEN stretch? lemme know the proper regime. thx. hey floridas, when are y'all comin' out here? have you decided yet? lemme know asap so i can block out that time hang with y'all. and did your dad get a job overseas yet? what's the haps, sistahs? shawna, i'm glad you didn't get runover by the metro rail. that was awful! did homeboy die?? please be more cautious from now on when you're downtown. alright, gotta start my day. i have so much crap i have to get done, it's not even funny. ciao ciao!

 HOLLA Wow those were some touching insights. It is so true though...we do live SO FAR APART. I don't know any of my neighbors hardly. Great point Dena. And Angela, you're right...drinking'll put you in the mood. I'm glad you hooked up with Adam though...he was cute and seemed really nice. So anyway, onto the show... I finally got to go to the Alamo Draft House last night yay!!! It was everything I dreamed of and more. I got drunk, and Mike was something between drunk and high off his medicine and in extreme tooth pain. But he was being hilarious. Review of The Anchorman: Well, I thought it was hilarious, but then again, I was drunk. I laughed loud and obnoxiously the whole movie. Good times. I feel gross. Could be b/c I haven't been home in two days. So I haven't showered and I've worked out and I haven't taken out my contacts. Gross! Ok I have nothing to say...except I'm worried about Sue. It's like she disappeared off the face of the earth. Anyway, see yall later.

 HOLLA i thought i would add a little more. me and angela now have drunk insights...these are deep thoughts you have when you are drunk....this is when you realize things you could never realize sober. it's a funny thing, we live in these neighorhoods with hundreds (maybe thousands of people)....but WHO ARE WE; we don't even know eachother, yet we live so close. hehehe isn't that funny. one day there was a grassy field with cows and chickens and prob. horses too...but then the next day all these houses popped up and then the people came and they lived...and they lived TOGETHER. insight: where there is a house, people will come, and although they do not know eachother, they will live together...so close......YET SO FAR APART. angela's is like the first commandment of drunk insights though.....read it...believe it....LIVE BY IT. .......IT IS DRUNK NATURE. that is all. d

 When you are drunk you get in the mood and want to hook up with guys... it is drunk nature. HOLLA

 Wow so last night was good fun as you can tell from Shawna & Betsy's post i decided it would be a really good idea to start drinking margaritas at like 5... and it was a good idea we went through a whole bottle of tequila & most of a bottle of rum good times there were drunken phone call and i think shawna said she was pregnant again to someone... what a nut! well im out of stuff to say... HOLLA

 HOLLA JESUS JUMPING JACK CHRIST BLOG!!!!!!!!! SUZANNE??? DENA???

 HOLLA Well, I went to a wedding on Saturday...it was Angela's wedding. It ruled. I love receptions and free food. All the girls on my team were like "I want to get married...awww." For some reason, weddings make me glad I'm single. Maybe it's b/c of the alcohol and dancing. But yeah we got drunk in front of our coaches, and Pat, my old Challenge trainer. It was awesome. After the wedding a bunch of us hit the bars...I made out with a guy from Albequerque with plug earrings who was looking for cocaine. Whatever, he was a good kisser. For the 4th I went to Barber's (teammate/friend) house with a bunch of girls on the team. I was hung over and tired. The house was beautiful and it was on a river...it was really peaceful. We were all about to fall asleep but then some of Barber's high school friends came over and we played drinking games and it was over. So yeah, I haven't been getting much sleep b/c I've started working out a shitload in preparation for preseason and working and shizat. I'm so tired...how's Mary Kate doing? Anyone know? Out.

 so i am here at my desk, drinking the coffee i made (which i really dont like but i desperatley needed some caffine) and one of the THREE lights in the room i work in is flickering on and off on and off on and off. dear lord i think i might kill myself. My desk is in the lobby of the office and the lobby is a dimly lit room and so when one of the lights goes out it is like a cave in here. This flickering is really annoying, I need to call up Fransisco to fix it. He is our matinence guy... he is really funny. He just says random things that make no sense and it makes me laugh. Oh the flickering stopped.... oh nope its back. Is it bad that I had to add FIVE sugar cubes and half a bottle of cream to my coffee to make it taste semi-normal? I dont know why i cant accustom myself to the taste of coffee or beer. This really upsets me because these are two drinks i really should learn to like in order to make it in this fine country. One day i will be the ultimate beer/coffee drinker. Until then, i will stick to hot chocolate and root beer i.e things that taste GOOD. UGH i just took the last sip of my coffee and im thinkin that all the sugar cubes i put in there just sort of sunk to the bottom because I just drank PURE sugar. Ok this blog is quite retarded.... after all those words you would have thunk i would have gotten past coffee sugar and bad lighting... but nope. Thats all the content I could come up with. Looks like I should go back to work. BLAH. Have a wonderful day since you probably arent stuck in a room with flickering light bulbs and nothing but coffee. (haha yes im STILL TALKING ABOUT COFFEE AND LIGHT.) holla hoolllla hhhooooooolllllla. HOLLA

 Shawna, your dare to dena reminds me of the time (3 weeks ago) that i went to splashtown with dena and brianna, and we were in the kiddie wally world part and dena stands under a waterfall and starts fondling herself and tilting her head back with her eyes closed in an errotic blissful sort of way. so, of course i had to try it, too... then we went into the lazy river and they had waterfalls coming down rocks along the sides, so we'd take turns "making sweet love to the rocks/waterfalls" as the other one would try to get the attention of the horny 14-year-old lifeguard to look over our way... good times. wow, the things dena has taught me over the years... Thanks, Babe! i bet shawna looks HOTT in mike's speedo!! that's hilarious. it reminds me of Focker on Meet the Parents when he has to wear homeboy's speedo! great movie. can't wait till "Meet the Fockers" comes out this year!! so, sorry for not blogging. i have been swamped with family ever since i got back home. and today, all of Don's family got here and they're not leaving till next week, so who knows how often i'll get to posting. oh-- and the flash banner, yeah well you can just FORGET about that happenin' anytime soon. just kidding. actually, i don't know if i'm kidding or not. i hope not, cause i really wanna get it done. my problem is that i hate doing things half-ass. i'm an all-or-nothing kinda girl. but we'll see. shawna, i hope your taste for subway comes back full-force and SOON!! i had the best subway the other day! mmmmm it was sooooo gooood. my new thing is to put fetta cheese on my veggie and it is HEAVEN. oh, and i'm glad you passed chemistry with flying colors! it was probably because i let Bott rub me down with McDonalds' grease that one time, and he decided that was the best sexual favor anyone could give him, so he passed you cause he thought you were me since we're practically twins. speaking of bott rubbing me down, you should really post our collaborative story on here... ahhhh, what would the world do without patrick swayzee?! haha! i've been running with daniel lately, and it's kickin' my butt. i'm trying to get to the point where i don't have to stop and take a breather every frickin' 10 minutes, but who knows if i'll ever get there. i think i'm a burden for daniel to run with cause i slow him down. i tell him to run ahead of me and we'll catch up when he loops back, but he never does. oh well. today i couldn't breathe cause my sportsbra was feeling really super tight for some reason, so it just took it off and made daniel carry it! man, bouncing boobs when you run KILLS!! they feel all bruised and beaten up now! and mine are small, too. i can't imagine what Double-D-Luxe boobs must feel like bouncin up an down like that... well, daniel's coming over with another choice-pick movie! can't wait to see what this one is. i'll let you know.

 yO MY pEEPS! So happy 5th!! Arent you excited to celebrate the day after the 4th. If yoou think about it... when america became independant i bet it was a lot more exciting on the 5th than it was on the 4th... because lets face it.... everyone was probably REALLY tired on the 4th from all the fighting and such, so it probably felt good for them to get some rest. And i mean, IT DID take a long time to finally cut free from the brits, so I bet all the celebrating really happened on the next day. My point is that we should do fireworks, get wasted and get off of work on the 5th instead because that is probably how IT REALLY HAPPENED. Im just bein realistic here. Besides my theory, not much is goin on. Im dissapointed that i havent looked at the blog ONCE since i last posted and nothing has happened... no comments, no posts and no tag board sexual harassment from jimmy. Its upsetting. Yall.... a miracle ocurred last night at approximately 7:50 pm. WE GOT INTO THE DRAFTHOUSE. NO problems whatsoever. Unfortunately Betsy could not join us because she went to her friends LAMO wedding. Bets what is more important???? A WEDDING.....or Dodgeball at the Drafthouse?? I see where you priorities are and i dont like it. Anyway it was fun and enjoyable. Especially since Dodgeball is funnier everytime you see it...trust me i have seen it 3 times. Dena and Los ordered TWO BUCKETS OF BEER. They were drunk. I opted for a dr. pepper and a cheeseburger. Yum. The only problem with the evening was the fact that I have come to the conclusion that EVERY employee at the Drafthouse is mentally disabled. Our waiter gave our food and bill to the wrong people...TWICE and me and Mike's ticket was 28$ so we gave him 42 because all we had was twenties. He didnt bring us any change!!! SO after the movie was out we asked him where our change was and he THOUGHT he was getting a 13 dollar tip. UM no....im sorry but i do try and be generous on the tipping thing... but not 50 %. He was retarded. I then took my change back and gave him 4 bucks. (Which i still feel is overly generous for a guy who expects a 50% tip). Anyway it was fun all in all. Today was fulllllll of excitment. First this morning me dena mike and Los got a game of poker going. We didnt have money or chips so we played with saltine crackers. It was fun. This was my first time to play poker (if you dont count alcoholic strip poker...) So they had to teach me. But all i was really interested in was eating the saltines... i was hungry. SO after i went out I kept sneaking denas crackers. She ended up winning anyway so really it didnt matter. A girls gotta eat, plus i figured i was being economical... eating the same FREE crackers that we used for our entertainment which otherwise would have probably costed money..not only for food, BUT the entertainment as well. After that we went to the pool because mikes apt complex had a 4th of july party there and had free beer/coke and pizza. I didnt have a bathing suit tho so i had to borrow erin's sports bra and ..... (cringe cringe) Mike's speedo which SADLY fit me perfectly. Um i have a large ass. Anyway I looked like a swimmer. The sports bra was loose too so it kind of suctioned up when i swam and practically became another layer of skin and you could totally see my boobs, no bra, no wire, no padding.....i could tell everyone was jealous of my extremely freakishly large boobs. Me dena and mike played truth or dare.... but it only lasted one and a half rounds. We quite after i got dena to dance in front of everyone for 10 seconds and go under the waterfall adn try to look sexy. This isnt really a dare though because we all know how dena is and the whole "sex appeal" thing, she always looks like she is trying to be dirty..even when she walks. Anyway after that we went to the park and me dena mike and erin played Disc Golf. LOTS of fun!!!! I am getting better. But mike of course is a God at disc golf and Erin somehow had beginners luck so they both kicked my ass. This black family was at the park we were playing at and they were all walking toward a picnic bench while two of them had LARGE speakers on a gurny type thing. They then proceeded to plug them in and turn up their christian rap as loud as they possibly could. Nothing like some good ole christian rap while you play a game of disc golf. THEN me and dena came back to klein and my fam had a bbq by the pool. Kelcee came over and we ate our fajitas and went in the hot tub. IF you have seen the movie "Saved" then you probably remember the part where the girl and the guy go under water in the pool and yell out secrets. Well thats what we were doing except not secrets...we just had to guess what the other person was saying. You can never hear what the people are saying but it was fun anyway. One time i picked to say a really long sentence and i started choking on water which i found funny and began laughing at the same time. Nothing like talking, laughing and choking under water all at once. Most of our sentences were something like this: "Dena likes transexuals" "Dena just farted" "dena likes to have sex with Oscar (our dog)" "Dena likes penis" We are so immature. To finish up the night my whole family and kelcee played poker. This time we used chips. There were eight of us and I WON! Im such a poker shark. You wish you were me. Here are the final stats: 1. ME -Poker Pokerson the Great 2. Brianna (my 12 year old sister) 3. Kelcee -balla extrordinair the rest dont matter........ just kidding. But not really. Ok well im off to bed. We are waking up early to go to huntsville to fish and have a picnic. Me mike kelcee carlos dena and maybe betsy. It should be fun. I will end my blog with a quote from betsy on the phone earlier: (after i asked her to come fishing with us) "I dont know if I really want to catch a fish and watch it die............OK!!!!!!!!!" Holla.

 HI THERE FRIENDS. Sorry i have been MIA the past couple of days. After work yesterday I had to rush to UH to take my chem final. Which, I DID not study for because i opted to go see the movie the Terminal instead. But I got a c+ in the class which i am happy about... and yes i know what yall are thinking. "Isnt that the class that all you have to do is show up to get a C+?" ... yes... yes it is that class but the great thing is I actually EARNED the C+... so basically either way i would have gotten it. But yeah ... its good to be done. Tonight me dena mike carlos erin and hopefully betsy (if she turns on her f-in phone ) are going to see Dodge Ball (AGAIN) at the Drafthouse. Cant wait because i have high hopes that tonight we will actually make it past the ticket booth. Lets keep those fingers crossed. Yall i am going through a major crisis right now. The past 5 or so times that i have eaten subway... i have been completely grossed out by it. Every time i take a bite i just feel like puking. And so i end up throwing away most of my sandwich. I think its because of the time I went to subway on my bday and I almost puked because the meat was chewy, and it has completely scarred me from ever enjoying a subway sandwich again. Im so dissapointed because that was one of my favorite fast food places... you know... ....besides wendy's, taco bell, mcdonalds, sonic, arbys, whataburger and burger king. My life is ruined. NOW WHERE AM I GOING TO EAT??? Heather honestly sista... i was fine with you not bloggin because i figured you could spend that time on something important...like CREATING OUR NEW FLASH BANNER. But im becoming a little skeptical about it and now i am thinkin you have been using this time for pleasure and relaxation. This is unacceptable. Im so dissapointed. LOL GURLL LOVE YA STAY SWEET CALL ME THIS SUMMER. Ok sue.. just so you know i signed up for CafePress.com and now all i gotta do is figure out how to get my designs up there. But i just wanted you to know how great of a friend i am... unlike some people... cough cough betsy dena heather...... But im not saying any names. LOL GURLS! LYLAS. Looks like shawna needs a shower. HOLLA. HOLLA

 HOLLA And why do I need a nap?? Well, I had a late night last night kiddies. My friend/teammate Amanda and I went to go smoke out again. Fun times. And cute boy was there. We flirted but no hooking up. Oh well what can you do. I just remembered I don't really have anything to talk about. Suzy, I would love for you to come visit me all the time in Florence. And bring Liza! We could have so much fun, especially since Liza studied there (right?) and probably knows all the fun places to go. And that is my question to her...what are the fun things to do there? Actually, I was hoping that I could come to London and visit you over my spring break...hold on let me find the date...Feb 21-29. But let me know if that would be a pain in the ass, b/c I know how much you study and everything. Anyway, we'll discuss later. But I'd like to know b/c if I can visit you over spring break, then I don't need to buy a ticket to visit you over Christmas. I really want to go to London, so let's make this work kiddo. I should be fine in terms of credit hours...I just need to talk with the head of the art dept. b/c they're pretty strict about what transfers or doesn't...but I should be fine. The only thing I need to worry about is taking my LPAP (basically a PE class) b/c if I don't take it, I don't graduate (even though I play soccer and work out about three hours a day...makes sense to me). I'm going to Angela's (friend/teammate) wedding tomorrow. I love weddings. Especially receptions. Sorry guys I worked out and didn't get much sleep last night so I'm really tired so I gotta go. LYLAS! STAY SWEET GURL!

 HOLLA huh, i cant read or post and why is that? this blog thing has got me at wits end. queer eye is funny. friends is funny too. big brother is addictive. good observations sue.

 HOLLA hey fockers BLOG! look at me taking time out of my day to you biotches a little glimpse into my life and what do i get in return? NOTHING! NOOOOOTHING. girls girls girls, dont disappoint. hey, i have to watch queer people make a fool out of a normal person. ive resorted to drinking by myself...is that a bad thing??

 ok, make that two things. ok, here it goes 1. is that really bill clintons blog? if so he is a weirdo and freaking me out. i DO NOT want to read about an ex presidents sex life. i dont want to read about any old persons sex life for that matter. gross 2. did anyone go to the cafepress.com site i told you about??? HELLO this is huuuuge people

 HOLLA. sucks to work doesnt it? yeah yeah yeah, get over it. everyone does it. in fact i wished i worked more bt as for now i will settle being the most bad ass bartender that there ever was. yeah you heard me right, i am a bartender and frankly i rule. henceforth, i cant wait for you ALL to visist because 1. i have a bad ass house 2. the pub/bar is only three minutes from my bad ass house 3. i get two free drinks a night and only have to pay a pound per drink after that and in london, thats the best deal ever 4. we would have the best time ever 5. london rules. floridas--where is papa florida going to work?!?!?!?! betsy. going abroad. if you go to florence i will go all the time to see you. there is soooo much conspiracy in that little city and i cant wait to dig it all up. ALSO, do you know italian? are you going to go somewhere where you can speak the language or do you care? do you have enough credits to graduate on time if you go? im just looking out for my little girl. liza studied in florence so if you have any questions you can talk to her. i am also going to work in the london marathon store so ill be doing what mike and carlos do. i get to look at peoples feet and tell them what type of shoes to wear. i probably get free shoes too. tomorrow i work my office job which is great because it pays the most. and as long as i work a 10 hours there a week i will have almost enough to make rent. speaking of... GUESS WHAT? i am officially on my own this summer. i told my parents to cut me off until school starts--keep in mind that school doesnt start til october here so thats quite a long time. yay for sue being a grown up favor of my bloggas--keep hounding me in july and august to do my law school applications. fact your chopping board harvest 50 times more bacteria than your toilet seat. i hate cats heather, i am awaiting a new banner and frankly i dont think i can live with out one so if you want to keep me alive you must GET ON IT and redo the website i love power ballads i am all over the place today because i really really want to go out but i have to be at work at 9er tomorrow and its half an hour away PLUS i have no money so it really wouldnt be prudent to go out but i am soooo antsy. argh. its canada day. i hate canadians. yeah, you heard me rpw. its not that i hate individal canadians (well, maybe sort of) its just canadians talk shit about americans even though secretly they want to be americans. its true they all do. plus they beat sales and a huge percentage of their GDP is made from weapons sales which is ever so suprising considering how anti war they are. riiiight canadians. get oooout of my hoooouse (insert canadian accent). well kiddos, i am reading my third dan brown book so it could potentially get me started on a whole new set of conspiracy theories. time for me to read and watch tv--big day of making money ahead of me. three cheard for pounds. yay yay yay. out

 HOLLA so i just wanted to say hi everyone...i have NOTHING interesting to talk about. i went to the children's museum yesterday. that was fun. they had face painting so i painted a mustache, flavor saver, and side burns on my face. on the drive home...everyone was staring at me like i was a freak...it was quite funny. oh, and i had a delish veggie poboy at kahn's deli (mmmmm)....the avacado made it PERFECT. no, i'm not vegetarian, i just LOVE veggie sandwiches. right heather...they are GOOD! two days ago i played some disc golf. that is quickly becoming a fav. game for me. it's golf..but with frisbees. how cool is that. apparently there are leagues for it too...and championships. haha. maybe i'll join and become a professional disc golfer! betsy, i agree...montrose is a very fun area...and sara and shawna's place would be freakin awesome! no joke. it needs a little work so if you want to come help us out...you can. painting...decorating...etc. oh, jaime's b-day was on may 27th and she turned 21!!! so happy late b-day jaime. alright, i guess i had a few things to talk about. later d

 HOLLA...two topics to do with dates betsy LOOK FOR PRICES at different times, ill accommodate. my only dates are these --i have to be back in america by the 20th and i can come back to london as soon as the 4th, your bday. let me know i have a date today with this guy i met at a party and this time FOR REAL i have noooo idea what he looks like, none. and im meeting him at a gallery and theres gonna be like a bajillion people there and hopefully he'll remember my stunning beauty otherwise i wont be seeing him. little nervous bout this one. ALSO the only reason im going is because what i do remember about him is that he listens to all my stupid stories and theories. hes obviously in lurf with me. ok, i must work my daddy comes tomorrow. yay!

 HOLLA before dec20 or after your bday

 HOLLA. WHY HELLO CHILDREN. LET ME TELL YOU A STORY...its about a little girl named sue. sue has no skills. she must wait until she graduates to be considered useful to this world. because of her lack of skills, sue has to do shit jobs. her jobs make her want to die. in fact, her job hates her so much that the computer that she sits in front of everyday is sending secret gamma-telegraphic-micro waves directly to her brain and she is quite confident that it is breaking her nose. her job will also give her carpal tunnel syndrome. that should be exciting. at least then sue will get to take time of work so she can get surgery on her deformed and ultimately useless wrists. YAY FOR CTS. soooooo, betsy has to go to preseason. harhar har. preseason is the most wretched time of the year...especially if you go ot tulane univerity. lucky for us, no one goes to tulane. i am tired and hugnry and want to go home and eat an onion and watch tv. but i cant. i need money and i need to study and that sucks. HAVE A SUPER DAY! DISCLAIMER: I MADE THE TEXT THIS COLOR BECAUSE THIS IS THE EXACT COLOR AND TEMPERATURE (YES IT IS GREY DEGREES OUTSIDE) OF THE WEATHER

 so my old room mate kelly just got back from a cruise, and i was watching her dog so her parents gave me a mexican blanket and a hammock. cool. Thats not the story. So me and dena are hangin it up in the back yard on the deck to test it out. We hang it in a couple places and try it out and we didnt like it, so we put it in another spot. I lay on it. About 30 seconds after I lay down on it, the nail bends, the hammock falls and I slam down onto the wooden deck flat on my tail bone. Now im in massive amounts of pain. I didnt roll, bounce or catch myself, i just fell from about 3 feet up and that f-in deck didnt give at all. Dena laughed. I was crying. Im almost sure that I broke it. But trying to tell myself otherwise seeing that cross country starts next week. That will suck if I cant run this season seeing that I just sat out last season because of my knee surgery. P. S I have really GOOD luck. Now we are going to hot tub and drink until I dont hurt anymore. HOLLA

 HOLLA Last day before preseason...so naturally I'm eating every unhealthy thing in sight. Gotta take advantage of it while I can! Dena I'm probably not gonna run after work today b/c I gotta do laundry and pack, and oh yeah I'm sending in a tape for Real World! They should pick me b/c I rule. If they don't pick me, they're idiots. But I am coming to yalls bbq tonight, after Six Feet Under of course. Wow this blog ruled. Heather, blog! Sue, I need your damn dates! If you take forever and the ticket prices start to skyrocket, it's your ass! I just finished this book. It's an autiobiography by Michael Datcher called Raising Fences: A Black Man's Love Story. Yes I realize that I'm a white girl reading a black man's love story. But I highly recommend it. The thing was, nothing exceptionally fascinating has happened in this guy's life, but he is such an enthralling writer that my attention never wavered. Read it! I'm about a hundred pages into another book called Dress Codes. So far so good. It's another autiobiography, this time about a woman whose father got a sex change. I'll let you know how it goes. I really want to see Napoleon Dynamite. Shawna wanna see it after my hell/preseason is over?? Let me know. Ok I'm at work...I love work b/c I don't really do anything and I get paid for it. I could keep typing if I wanted to, but I ran out of things to say. And since I am indeed at work and I can actually type inside the blog, I'm gonna change the color. There. Bye!

 so i just wanted to say that for the past week i thought our computer was broken..but then today shawna informed me that it works.....so HERE I AM! betsy...barbque at my house this weekend involving a TON of margaritas and other good drinks. umm....call shawna's cell and come hang out. our parents are flying to london tonight and then to baku azerbaijan the next morning...they're going for a week to look around and go shopping...etc. let's see....i want to fill in all the details of colorado...but it'll have to be bits and pieces. haha...the toilet residuals at daren's house story is a good one...kind of gross but hillarious. i'll let heather tell that one. well, actually i have to go organize some things....anyone with garage sale stuff...it is happening for sure this saturday (week from today). and i am going up to indiana a week from this coming wednesday. out d sue, i'm jealous...i wish i was there. heather...where are you? (i shouldn't be asking that) yukon dueitt...who are you??

 oooh man. southern comfort does not mix well with vodka and wine coolers. Im feeling it today for sure!!! By the way, i do NOTremember posting that last night. Ha. I have to go to a car wash now... yay, nothing like standing in the sun with a huge hangover. come to the car wash if you are cool. If you suck, don't come. HOLLA

 HOLLA...shawna rules..with a blog like that and her contined contribution to the blog of her creation, there is no way she cold ever be banned.(not that i have the power anyway...i was just making a point) i'm going out to lay in the london sun, ill blog to you later

HOLLA

 Yeah so I ran into none other than Meghan Minnesota at HEB last night. Wow. Well, she doesn’t talk in the plural anymore, but god almighty, listening to her talk makes me want to shove a pick through my skull. Nice. I’ve really gotten into Six Feet Under lately. That’s one hell of a show. Right now Clare is having a lesbian love affair with Mena Suvari’s character. Sex! Speaking of HBO…right now I’m watching this documentary called “My Uncle Berns.” He was in a swimming pool, and I noticed that he has bigger tits than I do. I want boobies. Let’s make a new online poll. Should I get implants? This is assuming that I will be able to afford them which will never happen. Ok, it’s time to respond to all of Sue’s inquiries: 1. I would love to go to Italy. Especially after everything you’ve told me. And I agree with you to an extent. But attending a program that gives strong guidance is a legitimate concern. Now if I was taking nothing but sculpture, I wouldn’t care b/c I prefer to work independently. But the problem is, I have almost no experience in any other medium. Let’s review. I’ve taken two drawing classes in my life. I have taken zero painting classes. I’ve taken one photo class (and ps I suck at photography thus far). I’ve taken zero anything else. Going abroad is still a possibility, but I need to find one that will ultimately benefit my portfolio. But I am dying to experience different places…we’ll see. 2. No I haven’t seen Mike recently. 3. I can’t wait to buy my ticket…I love London!!! 4. I really will work on the whole Italy thing, but don’t count on it. 5. Thanks for forwarding it to me. Did you get my reply? Preseason is nearing. The weird thing is, I’m actually starting to get pumped up for it. Fuck the cooper. I’m gonna kick its ass. All the fitness tests can blow me. Today I played 6v6 with all these random people…my friend named Al (Shawna you drunk dialed him one night) called me and said that he needed some more players so I jumped in. It was really fun. Sometimes it’s refreshing just to play for fun and not have it be so competitive. Especially when you’re better than most of the people out there. Good times. Ok I’m done, except Sue you never answered my question…are you still planning to come to Houston sometime in August??

 im busy but I have to comment on this real quick. A) You guys aren't girls, you are bfffff's ... girls suck. Y'all don't, so when i said "Girls" i meant "STUPID BITCHY GIRLS" not BFFFFFFF GIRLS. DUH. You should know, especially being a Klein High Grad, there are only a select few girls at that school who are tolerable. Hell, to other girls we were probably the stupid bitchy girls... who cares. I like you guys and you guys are in LOVE with me, so it all works out. B) This is totally my blog. You can't ban me because I created it, made it what it is! (with heathers help). Im the administrator so if I really wanted to be mean I could totally kick your ass to the curb BIOTTTTCH. LYLAS LOL GF. C) Do we really want to "ban" the only person on the blog who posts 100 times a week? I mean honestly, without me all this blog would have is some unreadable comments from "Yukkon Duiett" and the random perverted comment from Jimmy. the moral of this story is, there is only one true judge and that's God, so CHILL and let my father do his job. yes, i stole that from a Salt n Peppa song. Holla.

 HOLLA...betsy this is mainly a blog dedicated to you. because i have some things i need to clear up with your lame ass. 1. go to itlay if you want to be an artist--its silly if you dont. its like never actually watching a soccer game and being expecting to emulate pele. henceforth, if you want to live in my basement when you are poor you need to go to florence when you are studying 2. have you seen my brother recently??? 3. finding out dates for london as we speak 4. go to itlay if you want to be an artist. that, and youll get to be visited by me!! 5. check your email--its the one i sent to my mummy so that she would feel alright about paying for some of my hostels.

 HOLLA...i'm at work and have to make this super quick but i vote that we ban shawna from the blog. reason being, and i quote "But it's the truth.. making friends with girls is a waste of time". all those in favor?? shawna HELLO, girlfriends are great. some are bitches and end up like that whore who called me antisocial but you only need a few and its definitely worth the time. until you change your mind, i will not blog to you. only the other bfffffffffs. what are we, chopped liver?? i have some more great stories but for now i must work. betsy and dena (delete shawna), ill tell you the best timess to come to london this week. heather--in austrailia summer is in december so you can come too!!!

 HOLLA I can type in this blog yay!!! I think it's b/c I'm at work and not on my shitty ass computer. Speaking of, this can't be too long b/c I am "working." Anyway, Sue I'm jealous. I want to travel. I hope Darra (professor) refers me to a good study abroad program. Are you still coming in August? I hope so. TELL ME WHEN YOU WANT ME TO COME TO LONDON. The other day I was driving home on 45 and out of nowhere, in the middle of the highway, my door swung open. Oops! Good thing I caught it before it opened too far...ummm my life is boring right now but I'm making money so yay!! Soon enough I'll have hell stories from preseason. Well, I gotta whiz. And Sue, I didn't think you'd get a stupid chinese symbol tatoo, but just makin sure! A girl's gotta look out for her bfffffff. OOOhhhhh gurl! Shawna/Dena can we please hang out this weekend?? Alamo Draft House?? This is my last week of freedom. Shawna I won't see you again after this week even though we live about fifteen minutes away from each other. Out!

 SUE, I AM SOOOO JEALOUS THAT YOU GOT TO GO TO CAPRI!! And the Blue Grotto that I've only been able to [wet]dream about since I was a child!! As you know, my mother middle-named me Capri cause she used to live in Italia, and we were supposed to take a trip to the island years ago, but then the bastard Gulf War came, and my family lost all its money since they're in the oil business (how come the floridas came out of it okay??), and we were thrown to the streets of Boulder where we lived in cardboard boxes for next 5 years... (Feel sorry for me.) Anyway, I'm jealous. I'm proud of you for bartering so well! Even if it was only for some rocks. YOU rock. haha! Okay, onto Da Vinci. Does anyone else think it's funny that he painted DINNER ROLLS at the Last Supper??!! I mean, come on, they didn't have dinner rolls back in the day! It's more likely that they baked one big loaf of challah bread and each pulled peices from it; hence the saying, "break bread", right guys?? right?? Okay, that's my art analysis for the day. No, make that for the YEAR, since I SUCK at analyzing things in general. Okay, so technically "I'm at work" so I should get back to it. I just wanted to quickly comment on a few things. And my dad just called to chew me out for still being on "summer vacation." He's like, "Heather, no more vacations. Summer's over. It's August." CLICK. (Just kidding, he didn't really hang up on me, but it added emphasis to how serious he was. Little does he know that I'm going to NYC in two weeks, and at LEAST one more trip before summer's over, if not two... or more! haha! Doesn't he know that I go by the INDIAN SUMMER???) ciao ciao!

 well do I have some stories to tell?!?!? Ha. I made this blog seem like it was going to be a good one... but it probably will only grab and keep your attention for 5 seconds. So i'll get straight to the good stuff. Last night (for bri's bday) my fam went to the Astros game. Clemens was pitching. Anyway, so in the middle of the game they had this thing on the jumbotron where they have a split screen, and they show pictures of famous people and then people in the audience that look like them. The theme was "Old School" and they played dust in the wind... haha. Anyway, they showed all the characters (will ferrell, Blue, andy dick etc.) and finally got to Luke Wilson. They went to a guy in the audience and it WAS IN FACT LUKE WILSON . We had major "Jumbotron eye sex"!He was at the game supportin' the 'Stros. I just started cracking up because the Old School cast are like my IDOLS! The fact that they were playing "dust in the wind" just made it all the much better. He was sitting approx. 365 feet away from me. I know this because he was sitting at home plate and I was sitting right behind the 365 ft. homerun marker close to center field. Ha, im a dork. Anyway, they also put him on the screen again when they were doing "Brake for a kiss", which is where they lock the camera on two people and they are supposed to kiss. He kissed his "girlfriend" but i like to think it was just his sister. anyway, it was the highlight of my night if you couldn't tell. Today is brianna's birthday Party. The funny thing is half the people she invited are my age or older. She invited kelcee, mike, carlos, sara, adam.... i can't think of who else. Everyone else is her age. She is a TEENAGER (13). I already gave her the talk. I told her to start making friends with all the guys at school now because the girls will turn into major bitches in about 2 years. She thought i was joking. But it's the truth.. making friends with girls is a waste of time. ummmmmmmmm, i would like to write more but i cant thin of much to say. I can say that my ass hurts pretty bad. I guess you shouldn't get a tattoo on your butt if you have a job where you do nothing but sit all day. But at leas its not peeling.... yet. Sue, It would have been cool if you ended up with the rocks because then you would be able to walk around with the rocks and pretend like they were a digital camera and take pictures with them. People would ask "why are you carrying that rock everywhere?" and you would simply reply with, "This is my digital camera you idiot!" It would make for some good times. But then again, you could just do that with any old rock. Good story shawna. HOLLA

 HOLLA. hello commoners. this is suzanne and i have finally decided to come down from my pedastal and write you phillistines. i am in milan right now and i am basically waiting for the right time to leave for the airport. there are two things in milan; shopping and the last supper. i have no money and gucci really just isnt my styyyyyle and i just saw the last supper so now its a waiting game to head back to my island home. i am now going to let you all in on a little secret--da vinci's last supper is painted on a wall...not a fresco!!! i had always wondered why the hell such a prestigious and important painting would be in milan of all places but today i found out why they havent moved it--its part of the building--its the whole wall. and its truly awesome. i finished off my art travelling tour of italy today and it was well worth it. i saw three davinci paintings and tons of his sculptures and wall paintings, boticellis, titians, donatellos, michaelangelos (all the ninja turtles) and so much more. it was great and i loved it and i cant wait to do it again. i also decided that i am going to have an italian man as a lover. they are the most passionate people ever. they love everybody. its great. i met a guy at the blue grotto, which is the water cave in capri that is completely neon blue inside (awesome) and he is now emailing me so we can fall in love. he was gorgeous and i think he wanted to have my babies. he invited amie and i to sleep over but we were prudent (a good lesson learned from the tour guide that whacked off in amies face) and had to decline. whatever. he'll make a great lover when i become a jet setting playgirl. o, i dont have much more time but i have to tell you a GREAT story real fast. we were just about to leave napoli (naples) home of hte mafia and pizza and i decided that i was going to buy a stolen digital camera off one of the sketchy street vendors on the street. i realized it was a risk but i was all about it. so i worked this guy down from 200 euro to 20 (well done sue) and as i was walking away he was like " bella bella bella, ok ok ok, take the camera" and he handed me the bag and i handed himn the money. as we were walking away and about to switch the bags so that cops wouldnt see that i had bought stolen goods, low and behold, A COP STOPPED ME. "signora, stop, whats in the bag" as my heart stopped i stuttered and he was like "give her her money back" the street vendor then , under force of the pl;ain clothes cop, hands me back the 20 euro. i stil am scred that i will be arrested and sold into white slavery. then the cop explians to me that there was NOTHING IN THE BAG BUT ROCKS and i had been played and that it was all part of the street vendors ploy--they work in teams and pulled the ol switcheroo!!!! i was shocked and somewhat impressed with the elaborate scheme of their plan and the precision in which it was executed ( i was able to be in awe because i actually go t my money back and wasnt completely robbed). long story short , no one got hurt but i nearly bought 20 euro worth of rocks. the cop was hot. ok, time to get back to seeing the piazzas before i go and maybe eat on more pizza....ive gained a solid ten pounds since ive been here but its ok--in naples everyone was fat and the men loved me. i think i will move there. or capri. with my new lover luc. ciao bellas

 as of last night I have little cougar paws on my butt (lower back). Dena has a dragonfly on her "hip". Carlos has the runsport logo on his ankle. woah. we are crazy. And now I will die of hepatitus. HOLLA

 Alright in case you haven’t noticed, I’ve been experiencing major problems with the blog lately. For some reason, every time I click in the box to type, nothing happens. NOTHING. It’s so frustrating. So now I’m going a roundabout way of blogging…I’m typing it on Microsoft word and then copying it onto the blog. Shawna, I tried what you said about internet explorer, but I already have 6.0. So I asked blogger support, and the assholes of course didn’t help me out one bit. Don’t they know this is my damn livelihood?? Little shits. Anyway, it’s been a while, and I’ve got a few things to say… Camp is over!! It’s so nice to be done with camp. In a way though, I kind of miss it. Don’t ask me why. Maybe it’s because I had a lot more fun at residential camp than I thought I would. Or maybe b/c I made a lot more money than I thought I would. And ps, I’ve successfully saved up what I need for my fifth year!! Now it’s just a matter of keeping it… My assistant coach, David, left recently to head up goalkeeping for a club in Austin. He’s actually working with Smitty (Sue you know who I’m talking about). It was really hard, but I’m really happy for him. I really think he’s going to be a lot happier there. It’s all for the best. It just sucks b/c he seriously is one of the best guys I’ve ever met. Genuine and kind…and he brought a dynamic to our coaching staff that I thought was really important. But there was a bit of a dilemma right before he left… A couple of nights before he left, a bunch of the girls threw him a party (actually more like a get together) at his apartment. He’s a good cook so we ate pork or whatever, had a few beers and sat on his balcony and chatted. Then we saw a video of when he was like two years old. It was hilarious. Then we stole his stuff to remember him by. I stole one of his stupid fishing hats. Anyway…the next day, Amanda and I go to do some bitch work in Chris’s office (which by the way rules b/c she pays really well), and consequently get invited to David’s goodbye lunch. At his lunch, of all places, Chris asks him up front if we drank with him the night before. David admits that we did, and he gets bitched out by her for it. I just don’t understand why they couldn’t just leave him alone. And since Amanda and I were there, we got bitched out too. Not that I feel it was justified…he’s not our coach anymore…who gives a fuck? And it’s not like we got shitfaced and had a huge orgy either…it was just a nice little get together with people that actually care about him. I don’t know…it was the first time someone has told me that she was disappointed in me and I was completely apathetic. Chris wasn’t that hard on us though b/c we were already visibly upset about David’s departure. Whatever. It’s over now. I think Chris is gonna hire this guy named Zoz. Pretty fun name. I met the guy…he seems cool. I kind of don’t care…we’ve been through a lot of assistant coaches. So it’s whatever. I’m supposed to work for this lawyer named Bob tomorrow. Yay! He pays really well too. I love Rice…you end up getting hooked up with all these little jobs by people who overpay you. Suzanne, I cannot believe you and liberal Amie actually slept in train stations. Did I not tell you how we almost died in Paris??? That is kind of hilarious/disturbing about the Nigerian wack-off though. I would love to be in Florence for a semester, but I don’t think it’s going to happen. The original program I was going to go with was a program called SACI, but after talking to one of my professors, she said that I probably wouldn’t gain much out of my portfolio even though it would be an awesome experience. I really want to travel, but my portfolio is my number one concern. So for now, unless I find a legit study abroad program, the deal is off. Plus I figure living in New York next summer will be an experience in itself. Another issue holding me back from study abroad is that it might take me away from my coaching stint at Kinkaid next winter. Not only did I really love it, and not only did it pay really well, but the varsity coach was implying that there might be a job there for me in the future. That’s probably something I wouldn’t want to throw away, especially if I end up going to grad school at U of H. A girl has to support herself…just a lot to think about. So all in all, I’m not totally ruling out study abroad, but it isn’t looking good either. What I am probably going to end up doing, and by probably I mean definitely, is I’m going to buy a ticket soon/now to London for sometime over Christmas break. So I need to get information from you guys, and I need it soon b/c the tickets are really cheap right now and I don’t know how long it’s going to stay that way. Sue I already know you told me this, but I need to know what dates you are available to have me stay, and how long you want me to stay. Also, I want to know if you would want me to come at the same time as Dena and Shawna so it would be super fun, or if you’d rather me come at a different time b/c it would get too claustrophobic. And Dena and Shawna, I want to know when yall are planning to go if you have any idea yet. Dena/Shawna, I haven’t seen you guys in ages. Could be b/c I’ve been busier than all hell lately. And it’s not getting easier considering preseason starts next week. AAAAHHHHHH!!!! No matter how many years I’ve been through it, I’ll never be prepared for preseason. It sucks ass. There’s no way around it. Knowing this much, I’m trying not to stress too much about it. It’s kind of comforting knowing this will be my very last preseason (knock on wood). Ok I almost lost this entire thing b/c my computer is shit, so I’m gonna stop. I was already pretty much done anyway. See yall later.

 Ok this is just a test to see if this works. Blogger has officially FUCKED ME OVER. And they won’t help either.

 I am trying to go on a Last minute weekend vacation right before school starts. IF ANYONE knows where I can get Cheap tickets...or deals or whatever to places I would actually want to go, please let me know. I have been looking all over the web, and maybe I am cheap, but all the prices seem to be way too high. Heather, I know you are the queen at finding cheap tickets so I am counting on you. It is CHEAPER (but still too expensive) for me to go to Cancun than Los Angeles according to my research! I need help. Anyway, nothing new. Me and Aunt flo are hanging out together for the week...... if you know what im sayin. BLAH! Which completely explains why I was in such a HORRIBLE mood yesterday. I mean it was bad. I think I was pissed off at everyone who spoke to me yesterday. It didn't help that I scrubbed the mildew off the pool for an hour and my dad told me it looked like garbage. Thanks! Ha. That set me off. He was in a bad mood too, im guessing being in the car for 18 hours with dena and brianna could do that to you. Plus he just spent a week with GRANDMA! Enough said. Well now im at Mike's just hanging out. I think i might go eat lunch or something. UMMMMMMM ok. That is all. Bye. HOLLA

 (although i'll take a Sunshine Wheat over a Blue Moon any day...) haha, shawna - that whole "off to the pool to clean off" is so true about dena! her ways rubbed off on me while she was here, cause i only took a shower ONCE this whole week! i think it was on thursday that she informed me, "wow, i haven't showered since we left houston!" haahaha! but then she proceded to tell me that she went swimming at the rec center in evergreen, and then she rinsed off, and then we went hot tubbing at grandma's, so, you know. and then we went up to the cabin, and who needs to be clean for that? and then we thought we were gonna go to six flags, so why even bother showering before that?? it wasn't until thursday night that we gave in and took a real shower. together, of course. wow, i love dena. i've always thought that showers were overrated, but i don't think i've ever pushed it that much goin' without one without feeling bad about it ONCE. it was great :) way to make all the $$$ at the car wash!! very impressive. just tell everyone that "LOHA" is a combo of "LOL" and "haha" and that you're really laughing in all their faces!! okay, here's the week in review: Saturday: so, last saturday when dena, brianna, and mark got in, they had to go straight up to the g-folk's in evergreen, of course. dena calls me on my cell around 1pm and is like, "so, we're bored. when can you come up here?" and i asked her, "What time did y'all get there?" and she said, "oh, about 20 minutes ago." OMG it never ceases to amaze me how quickly you get bored up at the g-folk's. unfortunately, i couldn't go up there to rescue them until sunday, so she and brianna had to rough it without me. Sunday: sunday we actually met up with all of Mark's family for an early dinner at Jose O'Shea's, and daniel and I got there before Mark, Csilla, Dena, Brianna, and the G-Folk, so when we showed up it was just the floridas (Linda, Jess, Daren and his girlfriend Anna, Josh, Cindy, and Marcia) who I barely remembered, and who barely remembered me, and i'm like, "HI FLORIDAS!" and they're all just staring at me like, who's this crazy girl? So i'm like, "I'm Heather. Heather Buna." no response. "you know, Adam's daughter..." and finally Aunt Flo (Marcia) breaks the awkward silence and says something like, oh my gosh i haven't seen you since you were this big how are you sweetheart, even though i'm sure she still had no effin' clue who i was! it was great. luckily, dena and everyone showed up not too long after that and all was well. dinner was HILARIOUS. mainly because of Aunt Flo. She kept chattin' with daniel and saying really obnoxious things to embarrass him, but he just laughed. She told us how she always used to hang out at the Lil' Bear, which is a club in Evergreen, and Daniel said, "Oh, i've played a couple shows there before. It's got all the bras and panties hanging from the ceiling..." and Flo's like, "Yeah, well did you see the size 38D zebra print bra dangling off the rafters?? cause that was mine! yeah, they had to kick me out of the bar that night... heHEEEEehheehheHEEEheh!!!" **you know her laugh, shawna!** It was great. that night, daniel, dena and i went with my friend rachel to see Daren play @ the Blue Mule in denver. i think dena already posted about this. his band is called "Break Mechanics" and it's a hip hop band. I might be doing the website for them in the near future, so that'd be cool. his girlfriend Anna (who we really like/approve of) is in graphic design, so i might get to collaborate on it with her, which would be awesome. Monday: monday sucked ass. since dena stayed with me in boulder sunday night, everyone made us promise to come back up to evergreen the next day. so we did, and daniel drove us up there, and when we got there, NO ONE WAS HOME. well, grandpa eventually emerged from the back after about 10 minutes, so he was home, but that was it. We got up there around 1:00 or so, and there was NOTHING TO DO (of course). grandpa asked daniel if he played the organ, so we all sat in the organ room and made up silly songs for about an hour. then we went hot tubbing for another hour. urlLink then we played more organ. it was soooo lame. all i wanted to do was go home. then grandma got home from playing bridge at 4:00, so we had to listen to her talk for another hour. then FINALLY mark and brianna got back at like, 7:30 or something crazy, and we asked them where they were, and they said they went to lunch, and a movie, and played putt putt, and ate cinnabuns, and had some italian food, etc etc. and we're like, then why the hell did we HAVE to come up here today??? it sucked. so of course grandma has to make a huge dinner, which took another hour, and then another hour to eat, and then another hour to clean the kitchen and wash dishes (which was of course done by me and dena). ahhhhhh!! we didn't get out of there till 10:30!! and they wanted us to STAY THERE. luckily we used the whole, "oh, well daniel has to work in the moring" excuse. man. never again. okay, enough for now. i'll fill you in on the rest of the week later, cause i'm tired and this is a novel. ciao ciao!
