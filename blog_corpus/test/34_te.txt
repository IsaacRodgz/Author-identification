 eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww. ... the template keeps changing.. where are you getting these?

 rats are very smart, resourceful and some people think they are very cute too... just kidding, love your squirrels, it's all good.

 they are not!! :*( they're smart, resourceful, and very very cute.

 you and squirrels man, you and squirrels... they're rats in trees i tell you.

 i'm hooked on BK hashbrowns. fat little quarters, crispy and warm. yum. i consoled myself with them after driving out to essex(?) for a meeting that was postponed til tomorrow. also stared a squirrel in the face for a good five minutes.. the resident inspector puts peanuts out on the railing of the office trailer where we meet. i was standing on the platform when this squirrel climbs up and starts munching away on them like i'm not even there... cute little critter.

 sorry this is still a mish mash of yucky colors and bad links. will change the stuff when i have time...

 sad! how very corporate looking.

 for anyone who was wondering... i killed the blog, i don't know what i did, but i killed it on friday. the links will be back on shortly, but for now, this is all i can muster up...

 the random phantom is back. i felt compelled to post something since i haven't posted something in a long time. so all three of us are unable to give blood huh? the anemic one, the mad-cow-diseased one; the one that doesn't meet the weight criteria. what a trio :D and then there's esthie who adds on 10 pounds to her weight so that she can give blood. ;)

 hello everyone :) i am typing from my new gateway notebook. happy me :) i took the last one they had in the store today. the screen is absolutely wonderful, the machine is purty, and all in all i would highly highly recommend gateway. of course i've only had it for a grand total of six hours now... just thought i would spread the joy.. ...and say THANK YOU all for your advice & help! :)

 it's not my boss, he's just fine, i even helped him pick out a toy to send to his niece (legos!) , and he's in town. he was out just that day working off site. i can't leave this desk, the Product Manager that I was supposed to have a meeting with at 2.30 is late (he gives me the creeps) so I have to be here. i down in the dumps cause of this stupid html email process that i have been sorta pioneering. you would think a publishing company should have a system capable of sending mass emails other than just text, but no. so i've been waiting for the web group to debug this program for like a month and a half to send out this email, meanwhile, the publisher of that product is getting hot under the collar cause we're taking so long, so i'm the sausage in the hotdog ya see, so if the 2 sides of the bun don't cooperate, the dog can only squirm. luckily, the publisher is one of the nicest people i've worked with, and he's being really really patient, while I just feel even more guilty + want to kick the web guy's butt cause cooome ooon, 1 1/2 months, things expire and need to be done over and over again week after week + he keeps evading me. i'm just too super duper nice (i know, can you believe it? i'm nice at work) and people walk all over me. maybe i should send the pug upstairs (my co-workers bring their pets into work...) and have him bite the web guy in the shins. phew, okay, one long run on complaint. i'm so sorry, thanks for listening. just say a leetle prayer for me that i may be God focused here. thanks.

 oh, flo.. isn't your boss out of town? can you leave at a normal hour today at least? :( or maybe a walk outside would refresh you, it's 62 degrees out (feels like 75)... it will officially be spring in a week.

 i... want... to... go... home... now... now... now... now... malfunction... malfunction... fatal error... corrupted harddrive...

 yeah, i guess a 15" is a better bargain than the 450s.. but on the centrino: is it ok that it's only 802.11b? (not multi-mode for a and g).. will it mean i can't get online in a few places where others w/ multimode would be able to? or is it just how fast the connection might be?..

 the nice little office b-day party for my co-worker (which i organized by the way, woo hoo! ) has exploded into par-tay on the block eh-vor-ree-boh-dee... i sit quietly typing at my desk as everyone is eating cake and chatting it up. i can't really socialize around here... i am flo. i am an introvert.

 oh yeah. where does one go to get a headlight lamp replaced? ralphie is one-eyed ralphie by night..

 hm, ok after more browsing, i think i'd be happy with a urlLink Gateway450 (the 14" S series but beefed up a bit).. p4 2GHz-M/ 384MB/ 40GB/ modular DVD&CD-RW combo/ windows xp pro/ norton anti-v and ms office small business for about $2K even. i had to reconsider with the modular drive cuz i wasn't considering that as an option before but i think i could live w/ it. i know. no one else is shopping laptops and this post is putting you to sleep. but i thought i would, in case someone better informed has any burning opinions.. ... fro: ouch, that's pricey, is that how much laptops are going for nowadays? ... actually it's like $1,780 which is really good but then adding the software was $200 more, plus i'm getting knicknacks like a mouse & surge protector.. and shipping's free ... hey what happened, my rant was cut short, did you delete it by accident (or on purpose grrr...)? do you like the font? ... hehe, sorry. mine got cut off too.. what did you say? yes :)

 woohoo, we have homework from ms. frodo!!! ... de: yay, a new assignment! and on a "hobby" of mine too ;P but it's hard to think up animals on demand.. these kinds of revelations tend to hit you when you're least expecting them. anyway, sure. no one's ever given me an animal, so i'm open.. ... you are also free to deliberate whether frodo is really a sea turtle or not... personally, I would prefer something more lady-like, but I suppose i am not like that, so my animal isn't either...

 let's upgrade to superblog, yeah? i'm tired of text-only.. btw, i like that the guestbook's blue like our page :) ... did you want to go $5 a month, or go for the 1 year - $50? ... i guess the monthly..? it's almost the same ... should we take the discount and be cuffed for a year? or should we vote to be free and pay more for it? real question is: are we going to move within a year? if not, we should prob go w/ the yearly. thing is, are we still going to be doing this in a year's time... ... let's do the monthly. btw, are you happy w/ the font? i feel like are the words are kinda squished.. // we've broken 7,000 on the site meter! :o

 hp seems like a great company. their graphing calculators rocked those ugly TIs back in hs (remember those?). maybe i'll get a Compaq.. saw the Evo N610c which seemed pretty comparable to a powerbook, minus the sleek aluminum shell and like 10% cheaper. today's just for looking though. ... fro, see you soon. i'll keep my phone on.

 better than ramen, urlLink instant noodles that are actually good for you. they were 99cents at wholefoods ;d yum. ... what happened to our counter by the way, did we lose it forever? i miss seeing it

 yup, there will be an hour in between, i plan on bringing my knitting or a book or some-sing. I will be there. i picked up chocolate that were fell on the floor and ate them, now i feel sick, i think not actually from the chocolate, but the thought that i ate them after they've been on the floor... yuck... i think i will hurl now. !!! *o* !!! oh i am so stupid!!!

 omg, it is snowing. it's supposed to be like 60 degrees tomorrow though. i ended up doing none of what i planned. i spent the evening organizing and recording songs. oh yeah, i did get ( another ) oil change. transmission fluid too. cars eat up so much money.. are you just going to stay after Encounter tonite? we'd have like an hour in between right?.. ... fro: did you want to go to Columbia today? right after work? ... yeah, voulez-vous aller avec moi ? what time will you be off? ... la fro: bien sur, a cinq heure et demi? chez moi? ... eu... la bibliotheque n'est pas loin de toi, oui? peut-toi me rencontrer la apres le travail? [we're reaching the limit of my french ability. the grammar is probably horrid - excusez-moi ..] ... la bibliotheque est tres proche. Il est deux bloques de mon travail. {okay, that took me 5 minutes to write...} what time are you getting off work? is 5.30 too late for you? you can come hang out at my work, my boss isn't here today... ... you know i get off at 4:30. but it's ok, i've been wanting to aller a la bibliotheque . et c'est mon travail, non ? ... oui, c'est 'mon', desole. how do you say in french "i am a pyro-maniac?" ... ?! ..maybe i shouldn't ask..

 hey dennis, sorry, i was going to come onto blogger but i was lazy at home... ^o^ having a day off is just so wonderful ^o^ anyways, did you get your computer? i think i just got an email from dell about some online promo or something, didn't read it properly... you can come over to our place if you feel lonely, i'll sleep over if you want, but then you would have to drop me at work in the morning. it's okay, they're coming back soon. I miss them too -_- so, they are off to den Haag and Rotterdam today aye? ... hey, it's snowing! Nooooooooo!!!!

 let me just take the opportunity to plug one more animal (one of my favs!): urlLink razorbills. i first saw them at the baltimore aquarium, flying under water (the exhibit showed a cross section of their pool & ice ledges). it was unreal, seeing them flap their wings like normal birds and then just pop up out of the water onto land. they're fast. they fly perfectly well in air too. incredible little creatures. and i just read that a majority of them happen to nest in Iceland: yet another reason to visit :)

 hey fro. what are you doing today? i was thinking about hanging out in columbia -- Target (i need an alarm clock), Comp USA (but you could play at Joanne's).. maybe Expo (that interiors place).. I have a feeling I'll be looking for playmates a lot this week - i'm down to only one roomie til thursday, and even she's not home all that much.. oh yeah. fro's off today. dentist... sad, lonely me. ;| i remembered yesterday how much i hate being home alone for very long. it's a very different thing from doing your own thing when roomies are at least physically around, doing their things..

 remember that time we went to the crazy AVAM? here's the picture of the tiled, mosaic bus:

 yay! i get to be la petit amelie. i think i should blog more just to see the icon ;)

 !.. I'm kept away for a day and a half and suddenly i'm a squirrel..? fro, you're getting pretty good w/ the html.. spiffy. now if only our archives would behave. ... another meeting-filled friday. i like meetings, they're growing on me. i guess i'm just getting old like that.

 // anyone know of good sites for cute screensavers?

 urlLink March 17 presidential address.

 i see. (these are the golden retriever puppies i was telling you about a few months ago.) hehe ... hm.. are our archives okay?

 nice. i'd been wanting to show you this funny little bimmer for a while now. ... ok, you're going to have to teach me. i'm lost w/ the file uploading, ftp, blah blah blah. it looks like you have to save pics as a jpg file onto the server first..? whoa, how'd you do that? (and isn't it funny? the door is in front!) how did you convert from zip to jpg and did you have to save it somewhere first? and what about bmp files? ... i tried to shrink it and it's all pixelly... let's see what should i do?... oh and you have to save exactly what you want to show, size-wise and all that jazz, i had to save it on my desktop first... i think bmp's should work too. i unzipped it, saved it on my desktop, re-sized it then saved it again with a new name and then saved the new image on the ftp server. it is funny, but is it comfy to drive? looks a little constricting...

 WHOO HOO!! images - now that's what i'm talking about. :D

 we are officially plugged into Pro!!

 daffodils and a flo: awwwww.

 an urlLink iraqi blogger .

 i never thought i'd see the day when i missed anyone's mustache, but an older coworker suddenly shaved his off a couple days ago and it's hard to look him in the eye anymore. he might has well have gotten a nose job and braces, his whole face looks so completely different . (i think all of us are a bit sad for his missing mustache. but no one says anything...) mustache man tom selleck (i've always gotten burt reynolds and tom selleck confused. well actually, burt reynolds is always burt reynolds but sometimes tom selleck is burt reynolds)

 Our very own Lovely Beloved sister made us a chicken pot pie, ...it was amazing, delish, moh-please!! ^o^ i haven't had chicken pot pie since i was like 8 years old, it's so yummy in my tummy!! * THANKS Ms. Beloved *

 urlLink Mighty Mighty Tree House my goodness, i am all admiration ~ i always wanted a treehouse when i was little, but this, this is beyond any little girl's dream

 speaking of soccer, dude, i'm crippled. (it's even worse today) lifting one of my legs into the car this morning (yes. sadly, i had to literally pick it up with my hands), I realized that limbs actually weigh a lot. i guess it's just one of those things you don't notice til it hurts to do.. and speaking of crazy vehicles, i just saw the most ghetto batmobile on my way to lunch. i think they just nailed a bunch of two-by-fours to a thirty year old buick -- it was humongous -- and spraypainted the whole thing black. they were driving that thing around like it was a normal car too... ghe- tto . ( way ghettoer than my late ghettomobile, i promise you fro)

 urlLink Bend it Like Beckham I really want to watch it, but they're not playing around here...

 sirree i can't leave the country. once I leave, i have to apply for a visa and it doesn't work if i go to mexico or canada to do it... i would love to, but i haven't seen my mommy and brother for a year and a half and i miss them so my bones ache. I might have the chance before we all go back to school, next summer maybe? then we can save up :) just promise me you won't get married in the meantime ;p * * * * * roadtrip to : 1 1 handy-dandy & girlfriends :)

 urlLink canada . summer 2003. (?) must find people to go on a road trip to canada with me -- but you're saving your vacation days for hk right fro? and others are busy getting married.. Toronto-Ottowa-Montreal and maybe as far up as Quebec city: very do-able.

 Assignment 23. Haiku. ...so I guess this ties in with our japanese theme of the day..? !:P anyway, the article i linked is worth the read, whether or not you remember what a haiku is :) ... image-rich simplicity. show, don't tell (and every word counts) ...it's harder than it seems. ... // back in my school days, early spring was the one time of year i didn't mind walking home from the bus stop. every house along this one street had a cherry tree in front, lining the sidewalk, and we felt like royalty walking through the thick confetti of falling petals.

 sorry whodo!! I'm here. be back in a few, gotta run to a meeting... blah!! ... just came back, i am pooped urlLink

 pictures worth a thousand words? ..it's been so quiet since we moved to pro. With warmer weather come the camera crews. two catering trucks for a supposed film crew were parked outside my building this morning, smelling like shepherds pie and sesame chicken. yum.

 one more boo for this week. boo to senior coworkers calling in sick at the last minute and having you run a meeting for them in their place. what? yo, don't leave me hangin' like that.. uh, okay. senior coworker did sound pretty bad on the phone... Chip, the mtg was at your plant again and this time it ended right around lunchtime, but today i really had to hurry back... ONE DAY though, before you leave, we must do lunch!!!

 glad you approve :) ... i have, right now, in my pudgy hands, a gigantic can of Arizona Green Tea vs. I feel like some sort of addict (green tea addict?) with such a giant thing of it. (it looked much less beastly on the shelf I swear!) 23.5 fl. oz. it looked funny, i just had to get it!

 so is this what you've been up to, fro? i like. :) the sun has snuck out. wasn't supposed to happen til saturday.

 I felt like some shel silverstein and found a site with a few of his poems on it. I backtrack to see where it came from, only to find out i went to high school with this person. my year, same program. Small world. Not to mention the other alum i met a couple days ago.. It's weird thinking back that far. i can't say i really like reminiscing on those days...

 Sick by Shel Silverstein "I cannot go to school today," Said little Peggy Ann McKay. "I have the measles and the mumps, A gash, a rash and purple bumps. My mouth is wet, my throat is dry, I'm going blind in my right eye. My tonsils are as big as rocks, 'I've counted sixteen chicken pox And there's one more-- that's seventeen, And don't you think that my face looks green? My leg is cut, my eyes are blue-- It might be instamatic flu. I cough and sneeze and gasp and choke, I'm sure that my left leg is broke-- My hip hurts when I move my chin, My belly button's caving in, My back is wreched, my ankle's sprained, My 'pendix pains each time it rains. My nose is cold, my toes are numb, I have a sliver in my thumb. My neck is stiff, my spine is weak, I hardly whisper when I speak. My tongue is filling up my mouth, I think my hair is falling out. My elbow's bent, my spine ain't straight, My temperature is one-o-eight. My brain is shrunk, I cannot hear, There is a hole inside my ear. I have a hangnail, and my heart is--what? What's that? What's that you say? You say that today is... Saturday? G'bye, I'm going out to play!"

 my hydrocortisone cream smells like a childhood toy that i can't quite place... playdoh? slime? duplos? hmm... i think it's slime... hydrocortisone = steroid i didn't know that. I'm going to be pumped ha ha (not)

 boo to being sick. boo to rainy weeks.

 The earth is spinning quickly today, the covering of grey overhead whisking past to reach the west end of the sky. A pair of smokestacks in the distance trail behind them a rising line of white plume.

 COLD and *wet* today. i wish i were still in bed.

 i killed the template AGAIN! sorry, I'll try to fix up a new one today...

 is it me, or is it the weather, or is it just me being under the weather? An inexplicable tiredness washed over me while I was home for lunch, and as I curled up for a nap, too tired to care about the cold; delicious sleep overtook me and the minutes felt like days. It felt almost wrong to have to wake and run out the door, locking away the soft comfortable sleep to return to the hard tap tap tap of typing, or perhaps it is just the effect of falling asleep to Virginia Wolf and her quiet assertion that Mrs. Dalloway is buying the flowers herself. or maybe i'm just nuts.

 happy happy birthday dennis :D oh yeah, dennis, i think will kao wanted to join in on the "everyone" cd purchase as well. i have no idea what's going on with that so can you let him know if you guys are going to get the cds?

 oh my gosh I know that guy, no kidding... youngish black/ indian guy with a beaded goatee, kinda marble sized wooden beads, yar? wears glasses? he used to work at Plaza ~ the art store, he sorta freaked me out... ... de: hahaha! uncanny. yar.

 ever seen a man with a beaded beard ? i was checking out at wholefoods when the worker asked me a question. i looked up to see four or five large black beads dangling around in a line off his chin. it took me a second or two to reply..

 it's green beans I believe, so when you have fruit, you can make a stir fry :)

 !? ... you crazy cat! :) thanks. :p i really like the little sprout too -- what is it ?

 dennis, i'm glad you enjoyed the food. as sketch as the place was. ;) once again, the people at lexington cleaners are the BEST. they took out my ethopian greas stains on my linen dress in 5 minutes. for free! p.s. - sarah - it finally arrived so whenever you want to go for the fitting, let me know! :) they're open on saturdays as well.

 life is always unique with the doris and me ;p it's in the eightees, i think it is around 28C?? ok y'all sciency nerdy folks, what's the conversion formula from F -> C ?

 it's supposed to be in the eighties today! :O (what's that in C, 26.5+ ? :) i'm getting better at the celsius numbers, from our weatherpixie :) ... hey, fro (or anyone else), are you planning on buying the Everyone cd? L was saying we should get six people to order it together, for the free shipping.. ... thanks, fro, do. "scary" decor and eighties images + eating ace bandages + food stains and soda water :D ...and the yummy food of course. what a unique experience :)

 urlLink ~ Interview with Everyone ~

 yo, stop that... your face might stay that way. ;P ... we just had Pizzeria Uno's for our lunch-and-learn.. mmm. ... this great weather's got me thinking about tans & swimming & swimming pools. it's really too bad my community pool has become a dark green algae pond these past couple months. i saw a goose hanging out by the deep end last week. who knows what else is breeding in there...akk.

 this is how i feel today:

 Mt. Washington Bike Shop. bringing my bicycle in was a sad, embarrassing and funny experience. to make a long story short, my rusted crusty friend never made it out of there ~ fixing her up would have been almost as much as buying a new one, so they kindly offered to dispose of her for me. sigh, poor thing. three years of rain, snow and neglect has taken its toll...

 whoa. pics! the Bean has a surprising tendency to peck sisters on the cheek when one least expects it ~ this was the split second before i realized what she was doing ! ;p & i don't know why i look so insanely happy on the snow tube, you'd think it was an action shot. we were waiting in the slow line... ... i hope i get to leave at a normal time today; i was out of the office all morning & have to send something out by the end of today...

 fro needs your help everybody ~ i am in the process of putting together my final project for my photo class, and stupid me, thought I would double the work by putting some creative writing along side my pictures. So... being that i haven't used my creativity for quite some time, and running programs at work totally suck me dry, I am totally not doing very well. Last night when I showed doris some of the stuff, she just shook her head at some and said that they didn't quite work, so i need all y'all honest opinion and advice. I'll be linking the pictures + the writing on the page (hopefully sometime this weekend) please let me know yay or nay on them. shanks in advance :) - - - - - phew... I just drove over to hopkins at lunch to meet with my photo teacher, and she says I am in good shape! oh and Spring Fair is on full swing, i so forgot about it, too bad I have absolutely no time to go... too bad, first time I will miss the whole thing for (wow...) 6 years. okee I'm old. parking is a mess-pot, it is absolutely crajee.

 Courtesy of Pistach: Dennis snow-tubing dyslexic frodo "duh... a...b...c..." * muah! *

 no, no rock-climbing for me... i have to catch up on my looming final project for photography... eeek... "roll out of bed into work and chill at home for lunch breaks." hmm... that sounds awful familiar, oh yeah, i do that buah ha ha ha ahem.

 will sisters be going rock-climbing this saturday..? are you going fro? ... urlLink Saratoga Court Apartments . I guess they're pretty close to finishing up this place; they've been remodeling the building right across the street from work into loft apts-- it's basically the view out of my cubicle window. i wonder how much they'll be going for..? it'd be funny to live there...roll out of bed into work and chill at home for lunch breaks.

 can one swim in the reservoir? oooohhh, if one can one must go! i've never been to a swimming hole before!!! - - - - - Fruit Stripes gum is yummy :) - - - - - we should go picnic by the reservoir ~ we can bring our teddy bears and tea sets (j/k) but really, we should go. once you fix up the bike, we can go - i have rollerblades. let's go play !!!!

 field trip! went on tour #3 this morning, of pumping stations and urlLink Loch Raven dam /reservoir which is just gorgeous. I suppose you can go swimming, it's no little swimming hole though-- it's huge. On weekends they close a big portion of the road that runs through there and people bike and rollerblade and picnic by the water. people fish there too but i hear boats are not allowed.. ... i'll try to get my bike fixed up this weekend :D yay.

 take route 40west (away from balto) to 29south (left hand ramp) to 100east. You'll see the route 1north ramp after a while.

 whodo, how does one get from han ah rhuem to church?!? ... i have SARS and Mad Cows Disease. i think all the Preservatives in Spam is keeping me alive. I am a walking Petri dish ~ * FRO IS DANGEROUS! *

 maybe you did give me sars, fro; i've been feeling dizzy & faint...

 well, I am glad of whomever decided to transplant some trees into NY, it makes it about 1000000x more habitable and beautiful... my co-worker gave me a giant chocolate bunny for Easter :D (it's one of those childhood things that won't die for me, extravagent amounts of chocolate always wins my heart mu ha ha ha... yum :) ) p.s. I got sun-burnt being outside so much (fro's body: " oh my gosh, my butt is not on a seat all day, oh my gosh, what is happening, why is it so bright, why is there so much air movement, what is going on, we rebel! ") - so i am peeling and red in the face, luv-er-ley...

 hehe, well, we'll be having LOTS of stir fry this summer then ;p Ah, NY. you know central park was basically implanted, tree-by-tree right? NYC was not built around central park. I was shocked to see how perfectly rectangular the park was, looking down from the empire state bldg. ...and i will always think fondly of china town and its YUMMY malaysian food...

 about the beanstalk ~ there's this theory in our apartment - whatever fro does or buys or grows or cooks and such is big and beastly... except that beast plant of Dorice's (which she wanted to kill, but i have secretly revived with mucho plant food, so it's being as beastly as ever!) all i can say is it's good to be home - you know B'more seems so peaceful and quiet compared to NY. I love it here. other fascinating facts from fro's NYC visit: * China town NYC is da bomb! * i am eye-level to my brother's lower chest !??!! the humungo beastly thing runs in the family see... * my mom looks so cute and little next to my brother. * NY is BIG, and my feet hurt. * whoever decided to keep Central Park as a park is a genius. I wish we had a park smack bang in the city :)

 welcome back, fro! :) the beanstalk's been growing like 2 inches a day

 OK. orders have been placed. ...can hardly wait. :)

 the archives have been faulty for a while (blogger/ google's fault, they never fixed it) - i never bothered to hook them up, but if you really want them that much, i'll see what i can do after this weekend. all my energies are going towards my final project, i have to say my pictures turned out better than i thought i was capable, which is always good, rather, it shows how inept i was before, and now i'm "finally getting a hang of it", like my teacher says... (she's real blunt).

 sometimes i buy fruits off the back of a truck down the street from work-- kinda like a one-farmer farmer's market. today i bought very yellow ripe bananas (a bunch of five naners cuz they'll only sell whole dollar quantities). when I tried to tear two off to give to a coworker the whole group of stems came off in my hands. grr. urlLink --speaking of ripe & yellow ;)

 yeah, that's kinda scary to be having dreams about blogging.. you know, i really really miss our archives. are they still alive and intact, somewhere out there in cyberspace?

 i dreamt that you changed the template to this yellow thing that looked kinda hip but strange with brush mark patterns in black all over it. okay, i blog waaaay too much! ..... i ate my lunch for breakfast and now i feel sick.... blah!....

 ahahah :) that hello kitty reminds me of someone ;) ganguro , eh? a couple of years back it was kogyaru . i wonder what will be next?!? they're all going to get skin cancer when they're 30, and someone needs to tell them that if they keep on bleaching their hair, they'll need to start wearing those fake clip-on wigs. maybe that's why the wigs are so popular in asia. de, are you going on sunday night? i didn't realize that so many people were interested in tvb :)

 no, i have my final critique this sunday evening. I will be in the darkroom or drymounting all saturday too... boo hoo hoo , this sucks. i want to play too.

 ganguro..? [highly confused & slightly disturbed] ... hey, let's go see the violet burning, yeah? are you free on sunday fro?

 a big fat BURNT hello kitty - ha ha ha! maybe they decided to give the urlLink ganguro gals a nod to expand their market share. ..... it's a strange fad that's been going on for a while in Japan - urlLink more on ganguro culture

 oh dear, there's a big fat hello kitty on our blog.. ;p decided to go to a u.md. law school info session at 4 today. the group for this next year's med school class makes me wish i had people applying w/ me... :*(

 look, burnt Hello Kitty:

 I love Sinatra. I thought I'd tell y'all. - - - - - after really yummy food in NY, i don't want to eat anything here... (except for esthie's great home-cooking) eee, i'm turning into those spoilt nasty girls who turn their noses on everything! (never fear - i eat everything, things i like and things i don't like) i think it's how i was brought up. we had to finish everything in our bowl before we could leave the dinner table - i think i set a record of sitting there for something like 4 hours when i was little, i would just sit there with the food in my mouth for ever. my mom (who was trying to feed me) fell asleep, so she gave up that time - and i didn't have to eat all my vegetables ;p

 they now have watches that are solar powered with atomic time - no battery changing or time changing for daylight savings or when you travel, how cool is that - the intelligent watch! too bad they're so pricey.

 hmmm.... favorite drinks, I don't really have a fave one, but here is my list: *1 Coke - i drink any coke: classic, vanilla, diet, cherry, just not caffeine free or that lemon stuff... *2 orangina *3 San Pellegrino ~ which i cannot afford but it's so good! *4 Tropicana Grovestand OJ - the more pulp the better *5 water - ice cold and not tap tasting (with a wedge of lime if I feel like making a fuss) *6 (don't laugh) Pocari Sweat - okay it sounds gross but I like it

 urlLink sprite remix. they're always coming out with new drinks (and i'm always trying them). this one's... interesting. i've been drinking lots of poor man's pellegrino lately (seltzer water), but my all time fav is probably Clearly Canadian-- leave it to a non-American to get a drink right. ;) well, no, Arizona Green Tea & honey's pretty good. what's your favorite drink?

 so sorry dennis, we should have buried it in your backyard and had a popsicle stick gravestone on it... poor bike... poor dennis... no pictures folks, because no scanner for fro to use, i didn't know doris already moved her scanner out, so I don't have access to a scanner right now.

 yeh, i sneak it in, or i go on before/after work, or lunchtime. i'm off to the bank!! *so funny, our receptionist is leaving next week, and all these guys who like her are frantically trying to see her one last time. some guy supposedly asks her to lunch every time he sees her on the elevator even though she always says no. one of the bosses even told a courier today that it was her last day today and that he should hurry up and come by with a dozen roses!

 we're ordering papa john's pizzas for lunch cause none of us want to go out in the rain, yippeee ;d yum yum ----- no papa, they take an hour and a half to deliver... ick... order from somewhere else.

 coolio--even better! [i actually did reduce the width on my laptop but for some reason the width change would only show up on my laptop (even if i reloaded afterwards)] and why are you makin my stomach growl like that w/ yer pics of KK? ;d... you know, i never noticed the navels of the filled ones before...

 whodo... i hope you don't mind, i'm changing the crispy card... it's really bothering me that the writing column is so small ( hope it's ok!) - - - - - hello ho wo, so you figured it out! - - - - - urlLink they should sell quarter sized krispy cremes - that would make them bite size and so you can have many many varieties ;d yummy :D yeah man, the navel's there so you can peep and tell which fluff of deee-licious cloud of fat is filled with what, so you don't take a bite out of a mystery donut and be like "UGH!!! lemon..."

 howoso! welcome. --> girl, are you for real? push the "post & publish" button -- and this isn't im ;) i thought you didn't have access at work..?

 ok, i'm out

 woops- just trying this out :D

 hello, hello?

 hello hello!!

 i'm heeeeeere! (i'll be back) -ho's cameo

 there's gotta be another wholesale florist in the neighborhood. i am so not a siecks fan (and we'd be giving them how much business...?) i went there today and was... reminded of that. >:|

 poor gran-ma dennis, i'll give you a massage next time i see you. fro currently - pumped to the max with caffeine have too many meetings today too much work to do lunch = utz's party mix + oreo (so healthy) i want to go back to school NOW!!!! p.s. I LOVE urlLink BARBERSHOP (i've watched it like 7 times)

 *ow.* coming back here, my back turned into a bag of rocks & it's killing me (again). it's either my mattress or sitting at the computer for seven hours a day, or both. me poor back...

 i know what you mean. did you find yourselves some ice cream? i had a mad sweets craving afterwards too.. inhaled a pack of lifesavers & can't wait to eat something gooey after work... anything will do ;P

 i am full of pad thai (yum...) and really sleepy...

 my head is spinning round with many many thoughts today... ...sheesh, and this morning is just dragging by so sloooooowwwwwly. still half an hour left til lunch!

 so ban thai @ 1:10pm? can't wait :D

 i'm not hungry, i feel gross... something is wrong. if i'm not hungry, something is definitely wrong.

 where on Calvert is she working? we should get together, you, me, comf, doris and howon. we're sorta all over the place... charles st would be most central i think. how bout thai?

 me hungry. hey, howoso works on calvert street now. let's get together with her and dori for lunch either tomorrow or thursday-- since thursday's dori's last day, yeah?

 sleepy... Zzzz Zzzz...

 i've been watching Blue Crush (the teeny bopper surfer movie) all weekend, and these Cheap Tickets pop-ups with beach scenes keep popping up on my computer. I would give anything to be lying on a sun drenched beach right now.

 i was entirely frustrated, it's sort of funny but not, and it just sounded slightly like self-glorification when i typed it up... which is not what i meant, so i just took it right off... i think frustrating sums it up nicely. I'll tell you tonight if you really want to know.

 no, tell me about it, i want to know. ...later tonight if you want ;)

 ( i wanted to vent about my final critique, but i won't... ) :)

 the vb rocks. :) and who knew there was such a cool urlLink hang out place just five minutes from my mom's..

 good morning :) howo: i didn't notice your post til just now.. to see what you write on the actual blog website, you have to push the "post & publish" button (it's right next to the "post" button).

 people in my office are eating their lunches already and the heavenly smell of orange chicken is wafting through the air. mmmm.. t.e.m.p.t.a.t.i.o.n.....

 yes, the fair was muy fabuloso......and my $4 cookies 'n cream coffee shake was only a tad bit expensive. other than that, i was very very happy to walk around with superfob, trinity, and de. koh :D (who are these people?? they sound like superheroes or something.)

 my Honest Tea looks and tastes like dirty lake water. eek. i added three sugar packets & now it looks like dirty lake water with white sand particles

 anyway, the pit beef was yummy. the best part was the makeshift buffet table of condiments-- pickles, sliced onions, barbeque sauce, creamy sauces, ketchup, horseradish, mustards... i used a little bit of everything :) oh yeah, and we all picked out houseplants to bring back home with us. (please let this one live)

 O-m-G. Has anyone else's Outlook been acting up on them? Nothing I send is going through & it's not letting me view attachments to emails. I restarted and shutdown several times already this morning. >:I aaaaiieeaaaaaaarrrrgh! my best partner-in-crime is on a temporary blogger break. i hope my other friends keep me company-- or i may resort to blogging with myself under multiple names

 I hiked 15 minutes to the flower mart festival only to go and order some mediocre sushi from Minato ~ the lines at the festival were sooooooooo long. Truffles (the caterers) had some pit beef that smelled REALLY GOOD. I also smelled and saw from far away: crabcakes, hamburgers, lemon-peppermint sticks... there were some people on stage with mics that well.. shouldn't have been on stage or given mics :] ... many many catholic high school booths... and a great little latin music group. Flowers, flowers, flowers. hung out with comfy & howo for two minutes each. Maybe we'll go back for that pit beef after work :)

 my alarm clock was an hour and a half ahead this morning, I was so severely disturbed and thought i overslept that much! my goodness, and it's been ticking like a gigantic bomb, it's so loud i had to put it under my pillow and i could still hear it tick. it's crazy, stupid faulty alarm clock.

 i'd forgotten what it was like commuting on the train. the fear of missing the train as i walk-run hurriedly to the train station, falling asleep on the shoulders of strangers, the hectic crowd on the metro.... only 3 more weeks of the good ol' MARC. ;)

 hey, dorito! i was thinking about you. do blogging during normal business hours! *wow* ;) having a good first day?..............

 hallo from gw. back in d.c. :)



 i was much blessed this weekend, much blessed and much encouraged. i wanted to say something that would also bless you, but i just didn't know what to say, but i just wanted to say that i am much blessed. - - - - - in reference to the pic. above: HA ha ha ha ha ha ... what is that supposed to mean? I am in awe? I am in shock? I am constipated? (eee hee hee, don't kill me!)

 May is apparently Asian Pacific American Heritage Month . ~ guess it just isn't as big as some other Months...maybe it's bigger out in places like Cali?

 travolta travolta travolta. [this one taken yesterday by someone i work with.]

 jt's outside!!

 hey uh, there's all these firemen walkin' around in the street...

 the matrix reloaded just opened the door to lots of new questions...mostly summed up as: who are these people and what do they want again? ;P glad to have gotten matinee prices (although i made up for that by buying theater food) and definitely plan on seeing revolutions.

 i want to see urlLink - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 8 i just came back from a long long meeting - i finally am able to fully (well, getting there) participate in meetings nowadays... after 1 full year of working here, ( my anniversary was this past wednesday), I am finally getting the hang of things. thank you God for my job. thank you God for the people at my work.

 urlLink redbull flugtag usa ~ looks very fun.

 thank God for the sunshine... THANK YOU

 what are they doing now on this side of town? it took me twenty minutes just to get off 83 this morning.. i finally pull around the corner and see massive trucks lining all the curbs ~ and cameras and fireman suits. tsk tsk. filming is supposedly through july...

 because good things need to be shared: urlLink here you go. :)

 but then that's weird that our page is showing up the same as before ... do you think it's just a temporary Blogger error or something..? you'd be proud of me fro, i went jogging with jen this morning ! : O ...playing that sad grannies' match of tennis yesterday scared me into trying to get in shape again. ~ i thought you've been swimming regularly at that posh club/gym of yours..?

 i'm back... okay, who messed with the template?... i will try to put it back as i see it on the page right now, but might take me some time okee? Blogger is messed up right now... I don't know what's up ?!?! you went jogging? my oh my! i need to move too! I had to drive to my vendor this morning and got stuck in rush hour traffic going and back for like 2 hours! i don't think I can do it every day, thank goodness I live close to work! i didn't wake up early enough today, and it's cold - jumping in a pool when it's cold isn't that fun - but yes, I should go more.

 To our favorite nut: ;) ~oh horence where are you.. the template code looks completely different today.. am i just losing my mind? i can't seem to find the right section to insert this birthday wish. it was fine on friday when i posted the hiroshige...~

 Psalm 103. Praise the LORD, O my soul; all my inmost being, praise his holy name. Praise the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits- who forgives all your sins and heals all your diseases, who redeems your life from the pit and crowns you with love and compassion, who satisfies your desires with good things so that your youth is renewed like the eagle's. ...

 I was sitting in the midst of 30-some lovely ladies last night, thinking to myself - how blessed I am to live in a community with such wonderful women, how blessed I am to be in such a wonderful church, how blessed I am that I can be part of it all - it was perfect - life in Christ is perfect.

 i finally set up my voicemail for my cell! just thought i'd let you know dennis ;p - - - - - - - - - - oh poor whodo, are you feeling ok? do you need cough drops?

 Attended a seminar on Pumping Stations today. So interesting and so very boring all at once, you know how it is. The very disturbing symptom I've been having these past few days is a most intense, out-of-control coughing fit. I know one of them is coming on when I feel a crazy itch in my throat: Suddenly I'm hacking so hard I can't even inhale, and i'm all hunched over and tearing up and slobbering, with my face completely red. it's a lot like dr. jekyll / mr. hyde actually. i totally identify with that character now. I felt mr. hyde coming out in the middle of the seminar and panicked cuz i foolishly sat far away from the door. I coughed my way out of the auditorium but barely made it to the ladies' room before the really scary part came... whew.

 i have too much stuff, does anyone want some of my stuff? i don't want to pack it all and move it anymore... to date, i have moved around every year (but last year) for *waoh... * 10 years. i have 10 years worth of stuff with me. anyone want my stuff? i think i will donate it all to Goodwill. maybe i will donate my books to the library. ang & i were talking about what to do with the bridesmaid dresses... how bout donating them for people's proms : urlLink glassslipperproject.org urlLink fairygodmothersinc.org have to look into that a little more. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . new blogger layout - this is really throwing me off, i suppose the Google update finally got around to us. hmm... do you like this?

 Summer. * school's out! :) j/k. ...i keep forgetting it's summer break for the kids, they've been running amuck in our neighborhood. * being outdoors. goodbye S.A.D., hello sun. i think i may be cold blooded-- you know how ants get really hyper when they're hot, and how all that those monster iguanas on Galapagos do is sun themselves all day yeah. * tans. cuz you know. one gets tired of hearing pale jokes after like 8 months. * BEACH TRIP! ~ growing up, summer wasn't summer without our annual beach trip. I still crave the salty air, hot sand & cool waves when temps warm up. And I miss boogey boarding. * popsicles and BBQs and lemonade. and every holiday that involves an outdoor picnic :) // dudes i'm roasting in here. = ;( unlike the fro, hot sticky air & sticky skin are DEFINITELY not on my good things list.

 things i love about summer :) * sun sun sun * outdoor pools * flip flops/ sandals, breathing toes * eating ice-cream on a cone outdoors * no jackets (yay!) * driving with the windows down, music up, wind in hair * lunch on the park * foliage - trees full of foliage * blooming magnolias * thunderous rain - each drop as big as a bullet * moist heat (ok, i think i'm like the only person who likes it like this...) * peeling yourself off vinyl seats * tanlines and freckles * beach, sand, waves, sandcastles * summer movies - the big cartoon of the year * weddings, and more weddings --> new assignment ; sorry 'bout not updating!

 Chip , have you gotten your hard hat yet? ..wonder when i'll get to visit you. on the Acura RSX [straight from the urlLink Acura site ]: ... More than a sports coupe, the RSX is a total driving experience. It parlays its advanced styling and performance into a life-altering triumph in the quest for utter road domination. Utter road domination, eh? yeah, i can see chipcho in an RSX..

 flo- ok, so i'm swinging by today around 5:30- i'll call you before. *free coffee this morning at au bon pain! (and every 25th of the month for their 25th anniversary.) btw, the body worship looks beautiful .

 hello world. (we're back ~:) // One korean business that's flourishing in downtown Balto is the new york style lunch buffet. i'm pretty sure that Gina's Cafe = Big AppleTree Cafe = the new Sweet Melon Cafe : when i walked in with howoso & saw the same (owner?) ajumma at Sweet Melon as i've seen at Gina's and AppleTree my jaw dropped. they're all walking distance from each other... that's one mad monopoly, they must be doing VERY well. anyway, Gina's will always be my favorite... despite the ghettoer decor, all the same menu items just taste better there. aww, fro, i felt bad enough that you couldn't come with us ~ don't be breaking my heart like that~! :*( i actually tanned & managed not to get burned this time. also showed the waves who was boss. (haha)

 VS. hmm... tough call...

 we should do lunch sometime yar? - can i join you guys?

 de, next time let's go to Song's Chicken on Redwood & Calvert! My coworker always goes there. The fried chicken looks soo good right now...

 here i am at my desk, reading The Heart of a Godly Man by E. Glenn Wagner. For some reason, my boss lent it to me. Brothers, i'll share insights when i'm done. ;)

 dude, no wonder $1M doesn't stretch very far in this business... $ = $

 Hi! I'm off to NYC & Saratoga Springs to be w/ my fam this weekend! Have fun at the seminars, take good notes for me (boohoo, wish I could be here...) bubye!

 ok, so ...with the help of my super-sleuth friends lucy o. and officer wittig, i have been able to track down the cops of baltimore city so they can give me a report on my mishap 3 weeks ago on fayette street. hopefully everything will be well. oof- my shoes are killing me.

 yo ~ new assignment! urlLink are you ready?

 after getting cut, my hair's decided to be something different everyday. today it is in an xtra puffy 50s mood

 flo will be on hiatus until 8/25 ~> see you later :)

 dennis - can I come over to your place after work? --> of course :) there's a chance I may be going to costco's but if i do, i'm sure jean/others will be home.

 Learning to savor silence and quietness of heart TV has never before been so grating to my soul: the noisiness of it is just too much. Every show and commercial is designed to be attention-grabbing; to manipulate your thoughts this way or that its pretty distasteful really. Why should I subject myself to that, when its hard enough to stay focused on real things? Well, lately I guess Ive been too busy to veg ~ which, like someone once said, really is a blessing because you dont have time to do dumb things or live stupidly.

 Update on last long long weekend: * Finding Nemo w/ fam was great - my mom (as always) fell asleep after 15 minutes into the movie. we were doing Crush and Bruce impersonations the whole weekend. * up close and personal with a real :) * Saratoga Springs is absolutely beautiful!! we went to an art-fair on the park, farmer's market, and just walked around town. * according to the measurements at the NBA store, my bro is now taller than Kobe Bryant - who is 6'6" I believe - dang boy, he took all the tall genes! my foot is basically 2/3 of the bottom of his shoe, it's cra-jee! p.s. He wants a Yao Ming jersey set, where do i go to get that? let's hit the flea-bay!

 Hi from Skidmore ~ Saratoga Springs !!! God is good - his grace abounds, did you take good notes at the seminar?

 My Very First e-Painting. ...been playing with my new toys :)

 Whoah. New blogger. I haven't been here in so long.. Hi everyone :) Dennis, here's a picture of your beautiful creation (aka. bouquets): Here's a picture of the children's table: Here's us not paying any attention whatsoever to the photographer: Hi Living Hope :)

 "I would make a mental note, but I have nothing to write on." ...yeah, it's that kind of week...

 archives are finally up again :) ...good old archives.

 Blessed are those whose strength is in you, who have set their hearts on pilgrimage. As they pass through the Valley of Baca, they make it a place of springs; the autumn rains also cover it with pools. They go from strength to strength, till each appears before God in Zion. (from Psalm 84)

 i went around this whole morning with the craziest hair. in the car on the way to work i had randomly stuck bobby pins in to get my hair out of my face and didn't check the mirror til five minutes ago. how very embarrassing... let me just commend the consultant i conversed with in the hallway for keeping a straight face the whole time. (man, the things i do to myself that force me not to take myself too seriously)

 I want to watch Freaky-Friday @ Bengie's Drive-in!!!

 wow, it took me eight tries to get in here. i must have too many passwords to remember. (heh heh.)

 we're in for a revolution - it's an itching - an aching of the bones, stretching and chaffing, it's coming - God's moving, let's move!

 hiya kids, I'm in the big NY ~ how y'all doing? I feel so out of loop, I need to come home SOoOOoooN! sigh... I miss you guys, but being with family is wonderful. I'm trying to take a lot of pictures D.D. but it has been rainy rainy till today - I might still go take some this weekend. I'll be back Monday - don't miss me too much :) I pray that small group goes well today, that W:20 is blessed and God's presence spill out, and I pray that I will be effective for the rest of this week! I LOVE OUR CHURCH. did i ever tell y'all? I LOVE OUR CHURCH - and I don't ever want to leave it! yeah. * I miss being home... * see you soon :)

 denice, i did not know gina's had fried plantains...! I walked out happily with my $7 lunch in hand. :D p.s. are you guys wondering what's up with these mass blogs? (i am.)

 have you guys heard of The Da Vinci Code? Baaad book. (sheep bleating.) It's caused a small uproar in my office amongst the Catholics/Christians/Jews/atheists. But, opened the door to much discussion about Christ. Hopefully i won't burst a small vein in my forehead during these *discussions*. (Ha ha, sike.)

 the Big Scare is over.... i still have a job :) on the other hand (disregarding the last comment) l. wittig, i can't believe you left me here on this stinky street, for a permanent job... them permanent jobs ain't all that :)

 God is a God of second chances. -the choir of purple(?) vegetables from Jonah

 i'm so blessed!! with such awesome sisters in Christ, and the best roommates ever... thank you.

 look what my company just sent around: "One of our local homeless people has recently assaulted one A**** employee this week (kicked them) and threatened to punch another employee just this morning. Both incidents were completely unprovoked. The police are coming today so that we can see what can be done about this problem. In the mean time, please be extra careful if you see this person and try to avoid walking alone. He's a tall black male who is completely bald on top but has a bushy "bozo style" ring of hair around the sides. He usually in filthy tattered clothes and is often wrapped in a dirty blanket He's always dressed like it's freezing even when it's warm out. He's a regular in Mt V., so keep your eyes peeled and keep your distance if you see him." that guy keeps talking to me, I'm so scared of him... eeeek!!

 like no kidding - I had to put my head down on my desk for a bit not once but twice - I'm really getting sick of this old decrepid body of mine that can't keep up with me ;p some jigae sounds good - Korean or Chinese. hmmm.... soup and sleep, soup and sleep - a nice big bowl of clear broth and un-fretful-have-to-wake-up-stay-up-do-stuff sleep ~ i could use some of that.

 got a mega craving for some korean jjigae. that, and some good old fashioned sleep.

 okay... where did summer go? it's like it stopped snowing, then it rained, then it turned cold again ?!?! I didn't even get to unpack my summer clothes :( anyways, I was sending my brother to school and I got (as I usually do in Fall after I graduated) - school envy. I want to go back to school, I love the nice new textbooks, the bi-yearly new start of semester, the new folders and notebooks, new pocket protector (okay, just kidding) but seriously, school is so great - must study hard from GRE's to get into school, which reminds me, I better go to the library to check out some GRE books at lunch - studying, I miss that too. school is so hopeful, work is a perpetual pummeling. MICA - I call out to you - please take me, please, please, please...

 hi flo. i miss you my twin, come back to me ;) i bought this on friday: it'll be another week before it gets here though.. meanwhile there's this gorgeous picture-perfect weather for the next few days. :|

 man, we were given false news that the city was closing at two. then at five minutes to two it turned out to be liberal leave, which is just not the same thing. i suppose i'll leave soon; go home to hot cocoa & my roomies who are chilling at home today.

 * The Mickey Murder * O nce upon a time, there was a little mouse called mickey . One day he found his way to a burrow in Roland Springs and decided to make it his home. Yesterday, he smelt the storm brewing in the air and decided to find shelter in a warm and cheery home, so he picked the nicest and friendliest house in the neighbourhood and moved in, hiding out by the trash cans until the storm passed by. In this our nice friendly house, lived 4 eccentric women, one was Ms. Esthie, she was kind and gentle and loved to read, the second was Ms. Teeny who loved little children, the third was Ms. Elway fashionista diva, and lastly, and the most eccentric of them all was Ms. Frodo who lived in the dungeons who liked to think that there weren't any teeny micey creatures sharing the house with her. On this fateful morning, Ms. Frodo was awakened by Ms. Esthie as Ms. Esthie lovingly drives her to work every morning. Ms. Frodo dragged herself from her lair and was waiting in the dining room next to the front door, looking at the pantry and trying to decided if she wanted to bring any snacks to work. Ms. Teeny was home with her mom, so she was absent in this following most gory scene. Ms. Esthie came down shortly, and all of a sudden exclaimed, "Gosh Golly, I saw a teeny weeny mousey creature behind the trash can!" They were an environmentally aware household and so they had 3 trash cans - 1 for regular trash, 1 for bottles, and 1 for paper, placed in that order against the wall. "Leaping lizards, what should we do?" Ms. Esthie pondered. "Kill it! kill it!" Ms. Frodo shouted. mickey was much perturbed by the noise and screeching that had unceremoniously awakened him from his slumber, decided to find a quieter place to rest his little head, so he scuttled along the wall to hide behind another trash can. "it ran to the other trash can!" Ms. Esthie proclaimed. "AAAAAAaaaah!" Ms. Frodo replied. mickey was disoriented and disturbed by the high pitch screaming, and he made a bad decision, the worst decision in his life, he zoomed behind the third and last trash can, leaving him trapped. Out of thin air, there was a resounding sonic BOOM of a kick - Ms. Esthie aimed at the last trash can and gave it all she got -> this brought Ms. Elway down from her morning regime to see what the racket was all about. By this time, Ms. Frodo was reduced into a little whimpering screaming wreck-thing, hiding behind the kitchen counter. So Ms. Elway got the broom, stabbed at the fateful trash can a couple of times, and the Brave Ms. Esthie pulled it from against the wall. There lies the limp body of mickey, once so full of life and our trash, now motionless, prone on the linoleum - there was life no more. This sad scene was adjoined by screams all around (I wasn't the only one screaming ok?) the story doesn't end here, no, no, there is more, much more. was mickey to receive a proper burial that the hero of any story deserves? was he to be returned to the earth which he humbly came from? "How should we get rid of it?" "Who's getting the mouse?" "Where are brothers? We need brothers!!!" Exclamations flew like cross-fire in the air... - but Ms. Esthie, the stillness in the storm, swallowed hard, got the dustpan and proceeded to remove the poor nasty little dead mouse from their house. We exit the front door and proceed onto the front lawn -> the house with lovely bushes in front of it "Throw it into the bushes," Ms. Elway said, and so Ms. Esthie took the lifeless form of mickey and hurled him onto the middle of the lawn. Mid-hurl, Ms. Elway and Ms. Frodo realized the error of this brash action, and they both belted out "NOT THERE!!!" so Brave Ms. Esthie had to once again, try to gently prod the little nasty dead mouse onto the dustpan (this is much harder to do when it is nestled in dew-soaked grass than on linoleum). Once Brave Ms. Esthie managed to retrieve our little mickey, she proceeded to find a good spot to hurl him into the bushes. "Over there, away from our house..." Ms. Elway advised. So after careful calculation of wind direction, branch angles and gravity's pull, Ms. Esthie chucked the poor dead thing into the bushes. mickey's lifeless form plumetted through the branches, landing not far from a family of wrens, which vociferously protested as they came streaming out of their bush. so thus ends the fateful tale of mickey our minute mousey friend. So long, little one, and rest in peace.

 what? you now look like Zoolander? why do you look like Zoolander? oh dennis.... sorry about the dentist thing. - - - - - on a separate note - - - - - For this reason, since the day we heard about you, we have not stopped praying for you and asking God to fill you with the knowledge of his will through all spiritual wisdom and understanding. And we pray this in order that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and may please him in every way: bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the knowledge of God, being strenghthened with all power according to his glorious might so that you may have great endurance and patience, and joyfully giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in the kingdom of light. For he has rescued us from the dominion of darkeness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son he loves, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins. Colossians 1: 9-14 how do you combine the feelings of "I suck" and "thank you God" ~ cause they are swirling in me like OJ and milk, making something really wierd. I suck - because I'm stupid-like-a-mule-and-refuses-to-budge-when-God-tugs-at-me - I look at the task at hand and declare it too hard and quit on the spot. (but you know, once I get going, it's really not that bad - maybe i should have said that I am a lazy-butt...) thank you God - because he has "qualified me to share in the inheritance of the saints in the kingdom of light. For he has rescued us fromt he dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son he loves, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins." conclusion ~ i want to be all these things: bearing fruit in every good work, growing in the knowledge of God, being strenghthened with all power according to his glorious might so that you may have great endurance and patience, and joyfully giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in the kingdom of light. thanks lo for blessing me w/ this Word last night: "... my yoke is easy and my burden is light." "DON'T BE STUPID! DO IT, JUST DO IT FLO!!!"

 frustration is taking a day off for a much needed dental appointment only to be sent on a wild goose chase by mapquest.com. this dentist has such limited hours of course, there was no way they could fit me later that day. i should have known better. mapquest is evil. i was partway to annapolis at this point so i decided to make the best of it and get some images from our capital city. on another note, i must have slept on my face wrong cuz i woke up looking like someone gave me a black eye.

 the chemicals we drink. i drank 12 oz of mountain dew this morning & now i have that distinct sick feeling i sometimes get. i've gotten it after drinking fruitopia & fruitworks sodas too. i feel a little like hurling but mostly it feels like i have some muscle or nerve disease & all i want is for someone to step on or pound my back/shoulders. I used to get this feeling every once in a while and never made the connection to what I had drank til more recently. Anyway, now my mission is to figure out exactly which of the chemicals I'm drinking is affecting me. MOUNTAIN DEW is: Carbonated water, high fructose corn syrup and or sugar, concentrated orange juice and other natural flavors, citric acid, sodium benzoate, caffeine, sodium citrate, gum arabic, erythorbic acid, calcium disodium EDTA, brominated vegetable oil and yellow 5. FRUITWORKS (Peach Papaya) is: Water, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Filtered Pear Juice From Concentrate, Citric Acid, Phosphoric Acid, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Sodium Polyphosphates, Natural Flavors, Potassium Benzoate (Preserves Freshness), Gum Arabic, Potassium Citrate, Potassium Sorbate, (Preserves Freshness) Xanthan Gum, Ester Gum, Calcium Disodium EDTA (To Protect Flavor), B Vitamins: Niacin, Pantothenic Acid & B6; & Yellow, Red 40. Possible culprits: high fructose corn syrup, one of the "natural flavors", benzoate (a good possibility), citrate, calcium disodium EDTA (sounds pretty gross, maybe this is it), the Yellow. yuck. by the way, don't you just love that Dew has vegetable oil in it? once you know this, you can't help but notice how smooth it goes down...

 On NPR they were talking about this classic silent film. Apparently it's been restored to original quality and is playing at the Charles tomorrow night (one night only in balto. area). Man, if I had time I would have wanted to check it out... a movie from the mid 20s!

 lookee at this: stylin laptop bag for my soon-to-be stylin 15" powerbook - but dang, seriously... $315 for a bag? daylight robbery or what??

 for the urlLink nerd in us all - MIT open courseware, nice, like going to MIT for free ;p

 chemicals part II by the way, it's definitely the benzoate. (diet pepsi and orange soda are two more things i will never drink again) i'm looking at my diet pepsi bottle and what i don't get is that it's there to "preserve freshness". freshness of what? which chemical needs this chemical to be its preservative? tsk, tsk. i have to admit it's a good thing to cut down on food additives :)

 Apparently, as of yesterday, we now have a free public wireless internet hotspot at the Inner Harbor. The area stretches through the promenade from the Maryland Science Center Caf to the World Trade Center. Very nice.

 what are you doing on urlLink December 17th ?

 hmmm... you know, I think you bring up a good point about the zoom - I don't think it has optical zoom, i was reading a ton of reviews and stuff, and i think i have gotten stuff mixed up, so I am definitely re-thinking it if it has no zoom, dang, what am I going to do with it if it has no zoom? that sucks... anyways, I think my priorities for the camera are the same as yours, and having shopped around a bit, I think a Canon Powershot is the way to go for me, just have to decided if I have the big bucks or the small bucks. (really I have no bucks, but I figure, invest right?)

 there's a discrepancy in the info: is it 5.7x optical zoom or 5.7x digital zoom? if it's optical, that's amazing! and what i read so far is impressive, esp. for $350. but if it's digital zoom you know it really doesn't mean much: enlarging the pic in photoshop would give about the same result (grainy zoom). but then again zoom means a lot to me -- i don't know if you care as much. you know what made me go with a canon was their rechargeable lithium battery. i don't think anyone else has it. i suppose regular non-rechargeable lithium's not so bad, but digital cameras eat up power like crazy & i didn't want to keep buying batteries. i didn't really want the AA size rechargeable batteries either. also, i've been pretty happy with canon's processor (auto focus/exposure etc). so that's why i chose my camera as opposed to the many many other good ones out there. the other thing is, how much manual control do you want to have, cuz esp as you're taking photography classes, i think you'll feel the limitations of just a point-and-click... (then again, size and cost is the other side of the coin) ... cool! that's very good of you to offer, considering that your head has hit the tempo dispenser more than anyone else's ;)

 I am seriously thinking about investing in the Canon Powershot SD10 here is urlLink more info ... what do you think dennis? ... hey, tempo is as popular as kleenex in the big HK, I can check it out for you when I go there this Christmas!

 -- this was a great little product that, sadly, got discontinued. i just found out when i went to ebay looking for refills for my long empty car visor dispenser: no wonder i could never find the refills anywhere. Tempo was like a cross between kleenexes (soft, and how it dispenses) and paper towels (thick & durable), and the car visor idea was really convenient -- except that a couple of my taller passengers would always be bumping their heads into it. hopefully i'll win my bid for the 8-pack. but after that, who knows how long they'll even be available?... sad sad.

 i'm so sleepy...

 my co-workers are heading over there now... i heard the lines are down a couple blocks?!

 they do certain public services in the lobby of my building, including parking ticket payment. so anyway, today and tomorrow are urlLink Amnesty days, where you can pay your ticket without paying any late fees you've accrued... it is an absolute zoo out there. ... all morning was like this. the afternoon was better, with the line only stretching around my building instead of the whole city block... i noticed they even had a small row of port-a-potties set up.

 now I'm not very knowledgeable about politics and all, but I have serious reservations about Ah-nold being a competent governor of the largest state in the US...

 salivating over supa-fly camera - urlLink Canon EOS Digital Rebel with supa-fly price tag... cousin of Canon Rebel: even more supa-fly camera urlLink Canon EOS-10D with even more supa-fly price tag !!! okay okay, back to reality and more modest camera searches...

 urlLink look!

 look what I got at my work email this morning: urlLink untitled.bmp

 hi from my new computer... a sad farewell to my e.baby - we had mucho fun, I will miss you a lot :( boohoohoo...

 we have to see this - urlLink love actually

 * the flakey side of flo * here's one of those films that I (sheepishly) have to say I really want to watch: urlLink Kill Bill this joins the list of the following stupid movies that i like: * The Mummy (ok, ok, i know most people hate it, but i liked it) * Zoolander (i love that movie, it's ridiculous, it's hilarious, i love it) * Charlie's Angels (it was stupid, and funny, but stupid...) there's more, i just can't remember them right now... like, i am so flakey, like, how did this happen?!?!

 Psalm 33 1 Sing joyfully to the LORD, you righteous; it is fitting for the upright to praise him. 2 Praise the LORD with the harp; make music to him on the ten-stringed lyre. 3 Sing to him a new song; play skillfully, and shout for joy. 4 For the word of the LORD is right and true; he is faithful in all he does. 5 The LORD loves righteousness and justice; the earth is full of his unfailing love. 6 By the word of the LORD were the heavens made, their starry host by the breath of his mouth. 7 He gathers the waters of the sea into jars; he puts the deep into storehouses. 8 Let all the earth fear the LORD; let all the people of the world revere him. 9 For he spoke, and it came to be; he commanded, and it stood firm. 10 The LORD foils the plans of the nations; he thwarts the purposes of the peoples. 11 But the plans of the LORD stand firm forever, the purposes of his heart through all generations. what else can we say, as God opens the door to two students' lives, right before our very eyes? Lord, I am floored by the way You move.

 God, Your love is perfect.

 wow that was fast. yeah, she's probably learned her lesson.

 princess diva ho is back in service - she is back from apple hospital and has been re-wired with no loss of data, I hope she will be obedient from now on... Mac man, come on, you're letting your supporters down! boo boo boo!

 yet again confirming that this is the wackiest workplace ever - this was #2 in the list of announcements we got over email: "If you are traveling via air anytime soon, **** Smith is trying to collect air sickness bags. If you remember and and don't mind collecting some for her she'd appreciate whatever you can send. You can interoffice them if you wish. " o-kay...

 haha, thanks fro! :D

 fro! dude, i'm warning everyone ~ i have NOT been able to get this out of my head since last nite... hokey tune's been haunting me all day. click at your own discretion!!!

 i feel the need to inflict this upon the world urlLink milk & cereal enjoy - (courtesy of fiatvera)

 urlLink cute food is always good :) these applesmiles are funny ->

 :) hi. yes, we've had many of those in rofrodowhodo history...

 hi.... it's the phanton writer :)

 aaaaaoooooouuuuuuuuuuuuuu [whale noises of despair & frustration] is there a bank worse than M&T? i cannot imagine... :

 i cleaned up my lunch box... contents as of this a.m. ~> * 4 clementines * 1 jello pudding cup * 1 soup cup * 1 esthie brownie * 1 duncan donuts everything bagel w/ cream cheese * 1 banana * 2 laughing cow cheeses * 1 spoon * napkins i am on my last clementine and the jello cup... help! i am a monster :o p.s. yo! don't buy fat-free jello pudding, this stuff naas-Tee man Xp

 so i finally got all the phone numbers entered into my new cell ( 80 entries! ), but i still don't feel like we've really bonded yet. my old ghetto phone had a voice memo feature that i'll always miss: i would tell it things and it would always faithfully remember them for me. sigh. goodbye, friend.

 :) i always get this renewed sense of job satisfaction after a progress meeting. leading up to it is always a bit chaotic and nerve-racking but i guess challenges we kind of dread beforehand tend to be most rewarding afterwards. eek ... which brings me to the next dreaded thing for the week, when in about 20 hours i will be waking up with four fewer teeth. weird.

 we are destined for each other - urlLink the fro - - - - - uhm... urlLink ha ha ha ha... thanks dorice :)

 ok... i know what's wrong with me now - je suis malade. il fait chaud, trop chaud. je veux aller a la maison. boohoohoo. you know, everytime I take a dayquil gel cap, I think of Matrix 1 - red pill or blue pill, I took the red pill today. is that the good one to take?

 oh my gosh what is wrong with me? i am boiling - argh... i took my shoes and socks off and have rolled up my pants. (yes I am at work) I have the window open behind me, but I'm just sleepy and boiling at the same time... grotty! highlight of this weekend - I can't rave enough of when my kids said 'Jesus!' in their little voices 'Jeesud' it was awesome, there's a chorus of angels singing in the background - my little ones, they know the Lord's name.

 mmm. urlLink lime tic tacs ! thanks flo! :) hm, yeah they've gotten fatter...

 hm, funny that all our recent posts seem to be on teeth or dentures... anyway, did anyone else's dentists give them back their teeth? i have mine (all four of them) sitting in a cup of salt water in the bathroom. i know, it's kinda sick, but cool at the same time. they look just like the cartoons. :)

 hey, the monument lighting is at 7.30 not 5.30!

 like urlLink whao ...

 i'll be stepping outside to watch the thing around 5.30 with my new co-worker Liane (lee-ah-nee) and her daughter. whodo, do you want to stop by my work close to that time, you can meet my co-worker and score some food or something. call me at my desk or something? mrs. dori :) good to hear from you, have fun in dc! (what do you do on thursdays? sg?)

 surprise :) i remember last year's monument lighting ceremony! good times good times! have fun tonight :D i think tonight is the national tree lighting ceremony as well in front of the white house.

 why not, i'll swing by. i've never gone before but hear there are festivities..?

 i am jone-zing urlLink *curried butternut squash* hmmm... hey my work is hosting a part of the monument lighting thing, so i will be around, will i see you there?

 city news. yes! eutaw street finally reopened, apparently. but there's lots more urlLink area construction to come. today @ 5:30 is the annual lighting of the washington monument.

 Menace, that is beyond jacked up - I hope I never see that on Dusty, or I would have to take over custody.

 a forward from Jean... When you have: 1) nothing to do 2) a sharp knife 3) a large lime 4) a patient cat 5) and it's football season

 when I am at work, I am always facing my computer - my world from 8.30 till I leave is engulfed with data, numbers, text, phone calls and clicks on the mouse. my work computer faces a window looking out at the skyline of west downtown. the glare is something terrible in the winter months, so I have an anti-glare screen, which somehow just reflects the light even more, giving me a clear view of what is outside my window. I was reading something off the screen and just shifted my focus a little - noticing that the sky reflected on my screen is brilliant blue against the brown buildings, and there are wonderful fluffy clouds streaming from the left to the right as if on fast forward, and I was reminded of God. And I want to live such that I never forget and have to be reminded.

 An Era Better Forgotten - we wish! this is all very silly, and when I first saw it on someone's blog site, I was all nuh-uh... I don't know any of this, I didn't grow up over here - I am immune to the 80's faux pas generation thing, but I was horribly surprised, and embarrassed, and thought you might find it funny (remember our Oregon Trail conversation? it's on here) :) Are you a child of the 80s/early 90s?

 my old hometown I'm heading back in a little more than a week, it's been a good while, and this article from the WP summed it up nicely - urlLink a look at HK .

 from Mark 12. 41 Jesus sat down opposite the place where the offerings were put and watched the crowd putting their money into the temple treasury. Many rich people threw in large amounts. 42 But a poor widow came and put in two very small copper coins, worth only a fraction of a penny. 43 Calling his disciples to him, Jesus said, "I tell you the truth, this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others. 44 They all gave out of their wealth; but she, out of her poverty, put in everything--all she had to live on."

 scenes from last night's crazy lhf games are flashing through my mind and i'm sitting here in my cubicle cracking up. how greatly blessed we are, to have one another. :)

 WELCOME BACK, FLO ! ! !

 hello, i meant to post in hk, but i couldn't log on for some reason... ?!?! anyways, just a list of things on my mind: (1) trust in the Lord with all your heart, lean not on your own understanding. in all your ways acknowledge Him, He will make your paths straight. - the kids song (w/ all the hand motions) is repeating in my head :) (2) elvis is cool, but is he? (3) lotr - fellowship of the rings was the best of them all, but they are all good - beating star wars hands down. (4) urlLink mini ipods - I keep telling myself, "my old skool ipod is still cool..." (5) there is so much I want to do, 2004 is a good time to start!

 {95 is apparently closed down~ take 295 if you're heading south tonight everyone. or at least check the news first.} hm, something's wrong with my hip/left leg joint. i was wondering why but after thinking about it a while, my theory is that i dislocated it slowly over this weekend putting those long hours in at my laptop: i tend to sit with my right leg crossed over my left, and doing that for too long probably did something bad. i know. i'm going on granny. someone get me a walker.

 hehe i just did an interview for a friend who was applying for a government job. At first, i couldn't stop laughing cause the guy asked things like, "is she a loyal u.s. citizen?" ( loyal?? ), "does she have any terrorist contacts?", and so on. i think it's actually more funny to me cause she is actually so pro-u.s.

 oooh... deedee don't get sick, I still have severe side effects from the sickness: I still can't really taste food - and there's been this funny bitter taste in my mouth for the longest time, + I'm suffering from insomnia, I am waking L. up bumping around in the dark. fro's tips to getting better: * sleep - a lot - nyquil will bring a horse down for 48 hours. * drink - a lot of water, or hot tea. * take medicine once you've got minor symptoms so the minor symptoms don't develop into major symptoms. * call up y'all brothers and sisters and ask for healing. (heh... this should be first probably...) ............................................................... on another note, our house went to watch "Meet Me in St. Louis" last night at Toby's - it's really fun!!!! can we go again for my birthday? the main character was serving our table, it was a real treat. "Meet me in St. Louis, Louis, meet me at the fair...." "Clang, clang, clang, goes the trolley..." we had this Reader's Digest collection of showtunes when we were growing up, I think my mom or my dad got it for some reason and we found it stuck with some elvis tapes and such in the back of a cupboard, and we played them all to death, so showtunes bring back childhood memories :)

 I've been ignoring the beginnings of what could be flu symptoms, hoping that they'll give up and go away -- this flu strain sounds like a serious bummer, and anyway i've already fought off my fair share of viruses these past few months! Hopefully my old high school trick of echinacea & goldenseal will still work. Yup, I recommend the hard core concentrated droplet kind. (hehe, been a while since my last rave about this eh, flo? but you and ronjon know... haha.)

 new template, do you like? - - - - on a separate note: go whodee for sending out your apps! *trust in the Lord with all your heart, lean not on your own understanding, in all your ways acknowledge Him, He will make your paths straight!* I pray that your personal statement will be blessed :) I hope we all get in somewhere! - - - - on another separate note: shout out to the ronster! ~ how you doin girl?

 today is the beginning of the end of apps. i finally turned in my official application to umd (my official personal statement to follow within two weeks). i hope they like me.

 ok... I really should be doing my apps, but I took a bit of a break and watched this trailer - http://www.apple.com/trailers/miramax/valentin.html it's sounds good :)

 oh yeah the steak thing. it's supposed to help black eyes right? hm, i hear there's thick smoke coming out of our building and lots of firemen... wonder why we're all still here. we always get evacuated for drills...

 when i got bruised up when i was little, my grandma would boil an egg, shell it, and make me rub it on the bruised spot - all hot and stuff... maybe it helps the blood circulate and get outta the bruised area? well, it's supposed to work. also - what's with putting a steak on bruises? what does that do?

 my left kneecap is still plum purple.

 "The afternoon stretches out like a hound in the sun." just wanted to throw it out there - a quote from an article in the W. Post.

 come hither spring when spring comes hither the blooms bloom brighter the sun shines shinier and the birds flitter sad is the day when spring says "nay winter stay longer for I will sleep in" confused little squirrels furry heads bopping trees a-climbing looking for food in vain o spring o spring don't leave me hanging my toes are clamouring to be seen again spring do come with your spring showers and all the magic powers of a gentle breeze I will be waiting frigid and shivering icicles hanging for a glimpse of spring to come

 lack of sleep does things to your head... this morning, my alarm woke me at the usual 7.15am, after I turned it off and went back to sleep, I had the following dream: I was living in a house under the sea and every morning I would swim to the surface to go to work. Somehow, this morning, there was no sunlight coming through the waters and everything looked sort of scary. My underwater house isn't on the ocean bed, but suspended a bit higher. I looked out of the window and saw a whole ton of these scary looking creatures, they looked like small crocodiles but jet black and with red eyes, and there were these people wrestling them to control them. They were swarming everywhere, and my first reaction was, "oh nice, I gotta call into work and tell them I can't come in this morning..." i wish there were monsters swarming my front door, not really, I just wish I can have a couple more hours of sleep.

 i just got in touch with my old high school college counsellor and her assistant - they were just such wonderful women... sigh... it's been what 7 years since high school and they still remember me. I had such a great time in high school - it seems that most people just have so so experiences... but i was looking through the school webpage and remembering the things I used to do - my old friend who got me into riding is actually running the riding program, and they are building a big old gym with a swimming pool. i was in the very first hockey team we had and it looks like the team has flourished through the years :) i was a very blessed girl.

Strengthen the feeble hands, steady the knees that give way; say to those with fearful hearts, "Be strong, do not fear; your God will come, he will come with vengeance; with divine retribution he will come to save you." Then will the eyes of the blind be opened and the ears of the deaf unstopped. Then will the lame leap like a deer, and the mute tongue shout for joy.

 aaw... urlLink this is cute!

However, there is both good news and bad news... urlLink http://www.mindmedia.com/brainworks/summary.jsp

 on God and Authority - part of urlLink an article on Bill Wilson on the Washington Post, co-founder of AA. Wilson had a friend named Ebby Thatcher, another alcoholic, who had a friend named Roland Hazard, yet another drunk, who was wealthy enough to seek help from the eminent psychiatrist Carl Jung in Switzerland. When Jung realized how serious Hazard's drinking problem was, he told his patient that the only hope was a religious conversion -- in Jung's experience, nothing else worked. The American psychologist William James had arrived at a similar conclusion, declaring in "The Varieties of Religious Experience" that "the only cure for dipsomania is religiomania." Well, by God, Hazard got religion and sobered up, for a while. He preached this approach to Thatcher, and Thatcher in turn proselytized Wilson. "I was in favor of practically everything he had to say except one thing," Wilson later recalled of his conversations with Thatcher. "I was not in favor of God." After a couple of days at Towns Hospital, Bill Wilson was past the d.t.'s and feeling really low. Science could do nothing for him. He now realized that he couldn't kick the booze by himself. Yet he was unable to believe in the only power experts knew of to save a drunk. Then: "Like a child crying out in the dark, I said, 'If there is a Father, if there is a God, will he show himself?' And the place lit up in a great glare, a wondrous white light. Then I began to have images, in the mind's eyes, so to speak, and one came in which I seemed to see myself standing on a mountain and a great clean wind was blowing, and this blowing at first went around and then it seemed to go through me. And then the ecstasy redoubled and I found myself exclaiming, 'I am a free man! So this is the God of the preachers!' And little by little the ecstasy subsided and I found myself in a new world of consciousness." Wilson never had another drink. Carry This Message Brimming with vision and new consciousness, Wilson blew back into the familiar world as if everything had changed -- not just for him, but for all of creation. He bragged that he was going to save every drunk in the world. He went scavenging for men to preach to, finding them in missions and hospitals and jails and among his own drinking buddies. Some of his targets thought he sounded an awful lot like the Bible-brandishing temperance ladies he had rebelled against as a young man. He discovered that many alcoholics were "not in favor of God" -- God was an authority figure and drunks don't deal well with authority. no so much about how Bill Wilson beat alcoholism, he died craving a drink. He ultimately didn't believe in God - but twisted God into a New Age Pantheistic thing. Unlike many spiritual visionaries, Wilson came to understand "that when he heard the voice of God, it was often just the voice of Bill Wilson," as Cheever puts it. And so, in the now-famous catechism that he created, AA members are pledged simply to turn their will and lives over to "the care of God as we understood him," with italics right there in the Big Book. Prospective converts are often assured that they may take as their God the nearest radiator if that's what works for them. Almighty God with the white beard, or a gentle breeze in the treetops, or the sublime engineering of a molecule, or the vastness of space, or the love of friends, or the power of the AA meeting itself: Choose your own Infinite. Whatever works. I have mixed feelings about this article... but to see it published in print that God is the only one who can ultimately heal is good.

 anticipating the coming transition to Academic Mode, i'm starting to realize how rusty those gears have gotten. poor brain, i'm sorry, i've neglected you...



 Faith. Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see. This is what the ancients were commended for. By faith we understand that the universe was formed at God's command, so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible. By faith Abel offered God a better sacrifice than Cain did. By faith he was commended as a righteous man, when God spoke well of his offerings. And by faith he still speaks, even though he is dead. By faith Enoch was taken from this life, so that he did not experience death; he could not be found, because God had taken him away. For before he was taken, he was commended as one who pleased God. And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him. - Hebrews 11:1-6 How precious to me are your thoughts, O God! How vast is the sum of them! - Psalm 139:17 Whom have I in heaven but you? And earth has nothing I desire besides you. My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever. Those who are far from you will perish; you destroy all who are unfaithful to you. But as for me, it is good to be near God. I have made the Sovereign LORD my refuge; I will tell of all your deeds. - Psalm 73:25-28

 OK, I'm not walking under any more trees this month. I got back all late last night and went upstairs to where jn & jnfr were, when jn cries: Eeee! there's a CICADA on your back!! (i would have thought it was a joke except that jn DESPISES bugs more than anyone and would never ever joke about them.) For the next few seconds i was yelping and hopping and running in place while jn went to grab st (my hero!) to get it off. The grossest part was hearing the buzzing wing sound when she grabbed it. Sick. I would have been more traumatized if i had seen it i think. Afterwards, everyone kept going Eeee!

 For you, O LORD, have delivered my soul from death, my eyes from tears, my feet from stumbling, that I may walk before the LORD in the land of the living. I believed; therefore I said, "I am greatly afflicted." And in my dismay I said, "All men are liars." How can I repay the LORD for all his goodness to me? I will lift up the cup of salvation and call on the name of the LORD. I will fulfill my vows to the LORD in the presence of all his people. Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints. O LORD, truly I am your servant; I am your servant, the son of your maidservant; you have freed me from my chains. I will sacrifice a thank offering to you and call on the name of the LORD. I will fulfill my vows to the LORD in the presence of all his people, in the courts of the house of the LORD - in your midst, O Jerusalem. Praise the LORD. Psalm 116:8-19

 for both of us, for all of us - grateful for God's Grace that comes from Love. I thank my God every time I remember you. In all my prayers for all of you, I always pray with joy because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now, being confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus. - - - - - Blessed is the man you discipline, O LORD , the man you teach from your law; you grant him relief from days of trouble, till a pit is dug for the wicked. - - - - - My son, do not despise the LORD's discipline and do not resent his rebuke, because the LORD disciplines those he loves, as a father the son he delights in. Blessed is the man who finds wisdom, the man who gains understanding, for she is more profitable than silver and yields better returns than gold. She is more precious than rubies; nothing you desire can compare with her. - - - - - And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose. For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified. What, then, shall we say in response to this? If God is for us, who can be against us? He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all--how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things? Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies. Who is he that condemns? Christ Jesus, who died--more than that, who was raised to life--is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? - - - - - Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already been made perfect, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me. Brothers, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus. - - - - - Then Job replied to the LORD : "I know that you can do all things; no plan of yours can be thwarted. You asked, 'Who is this that obscures my counsel without knowledge?' Surely I spoke of things I did not understand, things too wonderful for me to know. "You said, 'Listen now, and I will speak; I will question you, and you shall answer me.' My ears had heard of you but now my eyes have seen you. Therefore I despise myself and repent in dust and ashes."

 I need to take this. Jeremiah 17:5-9 This is what the LORD says: "Cursed is the one who trusts in man, who depends on flesh for his strength and whose heart turns away from the LORD. He will be like a bush in the wastelands; he will not see prosperity when it comes. He will dwell in the parched places of the desert, in a salt land where no one lives. "But blessed is the man who trusts in the LORD, whose confidence is in him. He will be like a tree planted by the water that sends out its roots by the stream. It does not fear when heat comes; its leaves are always green. It has no worries in a year of drought and never fails to bear fruit." The heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure. Who can understand it? "I the LORD search the heart and examine the mind, to reward a man according to his conduct, according to what his deeds deserve." Psalm 86:9-13 All the nations you have made will come and worship before you, O Lord; they will bring glory to your name. For you are great and do marvelous deeds; you alone are God. Teach me your way, O LORD, and I will walk in your truth; give me an undivided heart, that I may fear your name. I will praise you, O Lord my God, with all my heart; I will glorify your name forever. For great is your love toward me; you have delivered me from the depths of the grave.

 In the process of creating a theology that accommodates apathy, disinterest, compromise, and even rebellion, we have lost the essence of the movement for which Jesus died. We made a mistake of making heroes out of those who were simply living a normal Christian life. There may be no more significant ingredient to the apostolic ethos than establishing a radical minimum standard. The gatekeepers for our culture are not the heroes or supermen, but the common person it is the common person within each society who establishes the boundaries that are required to remain a part of the clan. It is not the extraordinary standard but the minimum standard that is the critical boundary in shaping a culture. To unleash an apostolic ethos, it is essential to establish a radical minimum. It is essential to call people to a radical minimum standard. taken from An Unstoppable Force by Erwin R. McManus via ecclesia blog

 The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love. Gal.5:6

 For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. For it is written: "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise; the intelligence of the intelligent I will frustrate." Where is the wise man? Where is the scholar? Where is the philosopher of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe. Jews demand miraculous signs and Greeks look for wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified: a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles, but to those whom God has called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. For the foolishness of God is wiser than man's wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than man's strength. 1 Corinthians 1:18-25 "The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding. Proverbs 9:10
