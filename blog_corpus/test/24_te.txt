 Room For Rent in Austin A friend of mine just got a job at Saint Edwards Hospital and will be moving to Austin at the end of December. She will be looking for an apartment/room to rent. Anybody know of anybody who needs a roommate ? Anybody know of any nice/cheap/clean place opening up to rent? Lemmee know what you can!

 Will Somebody Please Chop Off My Head My Gosh urlLink The Last Samurai was one long, horrible movie. I mean, there were a few neat looking samurai sword flashing fight scenes, and a ninja attack, and a couple of big battles, but the director makes you pay dearly for these brief moments by dragging you through a story of unparalled lousiness.Thank god I only had a straw and a stick of gum handy during the ordeal or I would have ritually disemboweled myself. Surely the pain of slicing my guts open and feeling them spill out into my hands and then onto the theatre floor and then stepping on them and seeing the bloody mess mix with dropped popcorn and spilled soda would have been less than the agony of watching this film. And the ending! My Lord, the ending was so excrutiatingly, mind-boggingly bad that only my incredible tolerance for pain, and amazing physical endurance kept me from slipping into blessed unconsciousness. Even thinking about it now makes me want to wretch.

 Canasta Blasta! Does anybody know how to play or want to learn how to play urlLink Canasta ? It is a really fun group card game that requires the usual bit of luck and a tad bit of strategy and brain power as well. I think we should try it out the next time we all get together! My family (on my mother's side) used to play it a bunch when I was growing up. Most of the games ended peaceably enough, but every once in a while tea-cups and saucers got thrown around, but that has mostly to do with the egg-nog and/or white-russians that accompanied the holiday games more than anything about the game itself...

 breakfast (?) two cigarettes 6 cups of coffee

 Mary Jane & Ted Leo Breakfast: 1 banana 1 egg beater egg 1 wheat toast 12 oz apple juice I got to mary janes at about 8:15. I tried to stop by my old place to see if eric was around, but he was teaching. It was like travelling to another life seeing the old place; passing by taggart's old place; knowing that todd & little 'D' used to live just on the other side of cecil's...sigh. They didn't let us in for about half an hour. A handful of us waited outside. Two bands were up before ted leo: spame an orange and the joggers (from portland). I wondered if Colin knew about this band. Orange had a Ben Folds flavor. I say that cause a piano was the lead instrument. Played maybe 6 or 7 songs. Eric called right as they were finishing up. He decided to join me once he got back into town from his teaching gig in league city. The joggers were allright. It was loud and mary janes was small. Eric showed up about halfway through their set. Ted Leo started off his set solo. He belted out a tune i hadn't heard before. The band joined him and played Where have all the rude boys gone? Most of the tunes were off of Hearts of Oak. He played one tune off the first album i had heard of his (don't know the name of it.) urlLink I was able to take a bunch of video! Here is one of his final tunes; something i hadn't heard before.

 The Main Event

 Hi to all the blog-o-mite sandwiches in the audience. I have finished the interviews here at the reebok facility. Who knows if they are gonna offer me something. They all loved my work, or at least said they did, introduced me to more people the I was scheduled to meet, met with the people that i would most likely be working with, I think they all liked me alright. I don't know, it's quite possible that I come across as a pompous asshole, you all know me. So I am typing here at this corporate hotel with alot of suits, out in the middle of no where, not in boston but some little town outside of it...........tired. I think I'll go sit in the sauna. cock-a-doodle-doo OH, Killy, I love the line about wrinkled black football players.

 ...is a pretty nice color. i found these chairs and the wall they are displayed against near the Flightpath coffeshop in south(ish) austin. i found myself that far south because i was out fulfilling the requirements for getting the !@#$ ticket i received dismissed. we are soon to be releasing our first self-promo piece, a 4x6 postcard to be mailed to a targeted list of 1500 local businesses. wish us luck

 Another benefit is that I get to work on my tan between shots. Downside is that I miss Liz and Bodi. Cant wait till I get home and kiss my wife and play with the Bodi. urlLink

 I'm here Carolina! I just found the PERFECT toy for my dog. It's a little squeaky soccer ball that I throw as far as I can and he runs after it EVERY time and brings it back while squeaking. non-dog people probably wouldn't understand how cute this is. But Taggart will! So cute! and it effectively wears him out so he leaves me alone long enough to check the blog! School is cool-we're learning everything about pregnancy. So somebody (other than me) get pregnant so I can assess you! Austin is great. going to a show tonight, tomorrow night (Mosquitos, a brazilian pop band from NYC), and the next night (Shane Bartell-check him out). Study? who needs to study?

 Breakfast of Champions

 urlLink SubrosaSoft.com FTP Droplet

 I am not one to like or love the desert. I hate this place. HOWEVER. THere is something to be said about waking up and eating breakfast next to the mountains.

 The State of Things There is something comforting about stepping outside on these cold mornings. Old Fort Road is blue and dark intermittenetly broken by cones of sickly orange light from street lamps; the horizon is rimmed with wispy veil of clouds and it's quiet. Only one house, the one directly across from ours, has it's porch light on. I am immediatly reminded of the duplexes that I grew up in. Particularly, i am reminded of the first days of school. It's these days, right after weeks and weeks of warm long mornings and sleeping late, that are the most memorable. I sleepily carried out the trash. I would sling the bag over my shoulders to make it easier to carry. It banged on the backs of my legs as i walked the distance of the driveway towards the sagging decrepid tower of duplex mailboxes, each with their mouth's hanging slightly open (ours never closed right). There, around this leaning tower, the trash was huddled like wrinkled black football players. It was cold too. Even in my sweater. My mother didn't have the foresight (or the time) to start up the car twenty minutes before we left so it could warm up, so we would sit in the car and wait for the heater to crank up. The exhaust would billow behind the car, and the foggy windows would slowly become transparent. The school was literally right around the block so it wasn't long before i was pulling my sweaer off to keep from sweating in class. And this is what i think of when i step out in the mornings, as i pull myself into my own car warming it up for our trip into town. One house over, light seeps through the cracks of the garage door; if i listen hard enough i can hear the neighbor loading herself into her SUV. Her door opens and she slides out and waves. I wave back, start up the car, and retreat back into the house. urlLink

 iLife - First Impressions iPhoto 4 iPhoto's been mis-named. This is iPhoto 2.1. No 'outstanding' functionality that shouldn't have already been there such as the much touted faster scrolling and faster action on renaming rolls. Haven't been around anyone yet to share photos (My younger sister's laptop is with her at my older sister's house), so i can't comment on that, yet. I'm not really impressed with the 'upgrade'. In edit mode, you still get the a substantial pause when you go from photo to photo. Scrolling is still a little jerky, but admittedly, faster. So is renaming rolls. Adding keywords to photos is a first for me, i don't recall if this was available in the previous version. I never used it till tonight. Obvious negative: you can't assign a keyword with a right click on a photo. You have to have your 'keyword pallette' open and you can't just double click a keyword to apply it; you have to highlight the keyword and then click another button to assign the keyword. Kinda tedious. I wish there was an easier way. iTunes 4.2 Aside from supporting AAC....same thing. iMovie 4 Definately faster performance, but the startup is still sluggish and it still opens up the last project you were working on by default. I wish this would change. It took a 45 sec count for iMovie 4 to open my current file, which does have a good amount of footage... GarageBand This is the coolest application that I know i'll never have time to truly use well. It's not as intimidating and aloof as say Flash, but it is a pretty robust program! In goofing around with it this evening I realized quickly that one NEEDS that keyboard to really use it effectively. I mean, you could play around with looping and stuff, but if you wanted to make a real song (and belive me, you could very very easily) it would be too tedious without a keyboard. I read a lot about performance issues, with this app. I had none. Ran as smooth and killito's butt. Not a single hickup, but then again, I didn't have any other apps running. urlLink for your enjoyment

 urlLink Message delivery boy Doc Searls defends Dean: : "Watching Howard Dean's rousing 'speech' (I'm not sure what to call it... rant?) to his troops at the end of the day, it occurred to me that Kerry and Edwards aren't just the best looking candidates, but the best-talking ones as well. They are practiced and excellent public speakers. As message delivery boys, they hit the porch every time. Dean is an okay speaker. He's not great. I'm told he can be very good, but I haven't seen it yet. But he's also a doctor. Good politicians tell you want you want to hear. Good doctors tell you what you need to hear, whether you want it or not." Doctor sez: "NORTH DAKOTA, ALABAMA, CALIFORNIA . . . ." whether you like it or not. Hilarious.

 urlLink BuzzMachine... by Jeff Jarvis It is often perplexing to me when the culture of an organization appears defensive rather than accepting of criticism. Last month the New York Times did not cover large demonstrations protesting the terrorists within Iraq who are bombing things, etc. It was apparently well covered by local bloggers and since then, American blogs like Jeff Jarvis' (linked above) have attempted to take the Times to task for this oversight. In Jarvis' latest update, the Time's has responded and the response is composed of excuses. This reminds me of my last interaction at the Apple Store. The power supply of my laptop went out and I went to the Houston Galleria Apple Store to get a warrantee replacement. The power supply is one of those show stoppers for a computer, nothing runs without it (although I'm not certain what failing on a laptop is not a show stopper). However, it is a small object that is readily available from anywhere. Still the Apple Store didn't have it. The guy at the genius bar said, "we'll have one in two days and I will give you a call when it is in." I thought that was reasonable, because if they were out, it would take a weekday for them to order it and a day for the shipment to come in. However, that didn't keep my laptop running. I wound up buying a spare power supply, something that I had wanted anyway so I didn't have to cart it between the house and office all the time. Amber said that I should have been more upset, however, I have an understanding and acceptance of this sort of stuff. The guy from the genius bar didn't call until the following Friday . Amber said that I should definitely say something about this, so when I picked up the replacement, I said that I understand about supply shortages, but would like to register a complaint about how long it took to get a replacement. The guy immediately gets defensive and starts saying how they never know when their supply gets low and it is hard to forecast, etc. I said okay, just to shut him up. As a result, I really hate the Apple Store and this guy in particular because (a.) I wasn't treated like someone who bought something for $2,500 with tax since they didn't fix the damn thing even though they had other stock sitting on the shelf, and (b.) when I try to politely state my complaint, with the utmost of understanding that it isn't his fault personally, I get treated to excuses as if I am being unreasonable. This goes against the social mores of customer service culture. It isn't that the customer is always right, but when the customer has some input you accept it as their viewpoint and respect it as their viewpoint even if you do plan to file the input in the trash. If the complaint is due to an error, you can optionally state the reason for the error, but in all likelihood you don't bother because it doesn't focus on fixing the error for that person, the reason for the error is only helpful within the organization to avoid the error in the future. Why am I thinking about all of this? It goes back to the Dean Scream. So screaming is part of the internal culture of the Dean campaign and the scream speech was meant as a rallying the troops rally instead of a general "this is who I am and this is why you should vote for me" speech. What, they all do a collective urlLink Rowdy Roddy Piper or urlLink Hacksaw Jim Duggan impression while listing the states they're going to go to? I think that it is pretty disappointing that Dean didn't respect and accept the viewpoint of Iowa voters but instead retreated to his internal campaign culture. But maybe it isn't so bad. urlLink Matt Welch writes that . . . . . . having Dean going to all those states he named keeps the pissed-off wing of the party (not to mention non-voters) focused on the anti-Bush crusade, rather than trying to cook up some new Naderite charge. I can't wait to fire up urlLink Garageband and product political fun like this: urlLink http://homepage.mac.com/kmickey/.Public/LileksBushKnewRobots.mp3

 The Dean Scream Reloaded I agree that Dean's speech after the Iowa Caucus was intended to rally his supporters rather than to re-iterate his platform. In that sense it was clearly campaign focused. But I think this focus is understandable given the sense of deflation that his campaign must have felt after finishing so poorly in a contest that they were so hyped to win. In contrast, Kerry and Edwards did not need to 'rally the troops' in their speeches because: A) Kerry came in first place, and B) Edwards came in second place (when most people didn't expect him to make the top four). Both candidates had the luxury of focusing on the issues because both campaigns were, naturally, very pleased with the results of the caucus and did not need any 'rallying'. I too found Dean's speech clumsy and the 'scream' bizarre, but it [the scream] does make more sense in light of what Dave Winer wrote in the urlLink Scripting News: 1/23/2004 : Several times during the meeting a loud crazy-sounding scream came from the room, everyone was doing it, and it was really frightening. The stuff of nightmares. This was before Howard Dean's rant. I asked Jim Moore what that was about, he said it's an Indian war yell or something like that, they used to do it in United Farm Workers rallies, and they adopted it at Dean For America. A few minutes later Dean let out the famous scream, it was the same scream I heard in the conference room. They're probably not saying this publicly because it wouldn't seem contrite to do it, and they probably know they'd get roasted for saying the scream and ranting you heard was part of the motivational culture at DFA. Some have compared the Dean speech to a similar rant by Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer that made the rounds of the Net. So Dean gets a bit whacky, but after seeing it so many times, the shock value is fading. Taken at face value it wasn't anger, it was a steam-letting, and an attempt to rally the troops, and totally understandable. Here Whiner explains that The Scream was "part of the motivational culture at DFA". Now, I too had seen the Scream about a zillion times and was quite put off by it. I too saw it as an outburst worthy of the World Wrestling Federation. But had I seen coverage of The Scream along with the explanation that it was not a wild outburst, but rather a cheer that the Dean Campaign had adopted, I would not have concluded that Dean was an unstable, undignified Rowdy Roddy Piper. But now its too late.

 urlLink Scripting News: 1/23/2004 The thing about the Dean Scream isn't really about the scream (it was more of an out-of-breath yelp anyway). It is about a politician who is so focused on the campaign that the campaign is what he talked about. If you watch the other candidates' speeches, they immediately start talking about the issues that they feel are important. This signifies recognition that the campaign is a means, not the ends. In Dean's speech, the campaign, the list of states that they are going to go to, is what is important. I wasn't particularly impressed with Kerry's or Edward's speeches, but at least they are issue focused. Dean came across as Rowdy Roddy Piper from the World Wrestling Federation pre-declaring victory in the towns the WWF will visit. (Maybe I was just peeved that Louisiana didn't make it on the list . . .) One of the criticisms of the current administration is that they are using the bread and circuses of a minor prescription drug benefit and various military conflicts as a way of maintaining their grip on power. Well, in Dean's scream speech he doesn't seem very different, just more clumsy. When did rallying the troops start being about winning for winnings sake and stop being about the things that affect ordinary people in everyday ways? Besides being undignified, it seemed like his campaign didn't have a clue what their message would be if they lost. The campaign-centered and undisciplined speech indicates to me that either Dean's team doesn't plan for failure as well as success or that Dean doesn't follow his team's plan. Either way isn't a pretty sight.

 Testing The Fade

 i had a dream last night WHEW crazy nightmare many issues first - Laura called me from Sunny Beach a tropical place, she explained and reasoned that I should already know that since she lived in Virginia with all of you she called me to ask me so how long have you been pregnant? she had sensed it over the many miles because of a change in the wind then i discovered that Killy knew i was pregnant too but that I didn't know so i pretended i knew and laughed insincerely that I knew for weeks already THEN later that day I got fired from my waitressing job because of gossiping and as I was ready to go home a really nice asian guy one of those ultra hip super souped car jag guys parked ON TOP of my little car squashing it into the shape of a box i cried from having lost the job and felt bad for making the nice asian guy fell bad so i took my baby to a petting zoo which was the best petting zoo in the world because it had a whole slew of llamas to pet and a big yard full of kissing cows yep - that's right - cows that, instead of mooing made BIG WET kissing sounds so loud that sometimes it came out sounding like a high pitched squeak and then - these cows looked like something that dr. Seuss would draw anyway the baby and i went through the zoo and ended up at my old bosses house (Don was the baby's second godfather) where we ran into quickly upon seeing a six foot rabbit in the back yard who really wanted to get into the moon so my boss shares a trick from the 60s with us this time, it was barbara ann and the baby and me hanging out at Don's house he showed us how to take essential oils and rub them on our gums for a REALLY stunning, natural high with no side effects (except for a dry mouth) and it was good for the baby too! SO there we were when all of a sudden the cops busted in and arrested Don and Adolph (I don't know how Adolph got in there) for being Hector Molesters hmmmm so barbara was confused and argued ineffectively to release don and adolph but the cops wouldn't have any of it i finally got her to stop talking as i saw that this was just working against us and i let the cops do their thing but just before they left i pleaded to their common sense which i realized they totally lacked when they insisted on arresting don and adolph and they took them away and barbara ann, the baby and i were left in don's house afraid to go outside because of the six foot rabbit who kept looking at the moon then i woke up

This is pretty cool. I have never been flown anywhere for buisness, other then once for my brother, but that kinda doesn't count.

Also, I noticed that you tried to upload a .psd (photoshop?) file. The Amazing Image Uploader only digests web viewable images, such as jpgs, gifs and pngs. If you try to feed it other kinds of files, the poor beast will suffer horrible indigestion.

 Spending the day mostly indoors. Overcast. We need the rain but I so want to go outside and take pictures. errr......guess I will have to make do.

 Carol loses a job, Carol finds a job Carol's recent brush with unemployment was a real rollercoaster ride. We've been making so many plans that her sudden lay off was a real blow: what about a montessori school for the baby? what about a house? what about paying off our debt? what about fixing the cavalier? All of this was thrown into limbo for exactly three days. 3 Days! The same day she was laid off, Carol went into professional job hunting mode. She updated her resume the same day and called her old headhunter, MK Personnel, to set things in motion. Carol also had submitted her resume to a number of places she saw on urlLink Monster.com . Interview on Wednesday (second day after having gotten laid off), and then offered the job late Thursday (day three)... i was speechless and she was gloating all day - and beaming. She deserved to; she even managed to get a pretty good raise to go along with it. I think it's a good idea to have a "Sorry you lost your job but you found a new one so quickly!" party this weekend?

 Well it definatley has been an interesting week. I got the Sd-10 used it all day Today at the Driskell where I rented it out to Mark. Then my brother bought my Canon s40. we sold the s40 because liz wanted a smaller camera for her. So we went to bestbuy and combined her best buy gift cards and my brothers cash and we bought her an sd-10 the canon one. and the WOW is because Adolph's repost of the dog shot is a whole lot more yellow than the one I posted. at least on my computer it is. hmm. Well I will be sure to post some images soon.

 I just read the post you made on Nov 5 2003, the verse about your baby. I'm so very glad your a mom.

 S-10 Does this camera support tethered shooting (shooting directly to computer) via firewire? I didn't think to ask about that.

 . . . Or it is new to me at least. I forgot where I learned this, maybe Killy or Taggart showed me. I took some pics in the normal collage technique of click and pan. Then I took a step to the side and took the same pictures. Once on the computer, I masked the telephone pole that was in front of me, put the second collage of images behind the first and scooted them around to match (mostly). Voila, the telephone pole disappeared (mostly). Unfortunately, I only adjusted horizontal and not vertical, so the arms of the traffic lights are still visible.

 Hey Taggart, Sorry to have missed you and Mark day before yesterday. Does the SD-10 add extra dog-leggs to your dog, or what?

 congratulations taggart! nice! i've got jobs coming up from the guys i've done ads with before. i'd much rather give you the $100 rental fee than HPI.

 It has been a long day. I first have to apologize to Adolph and Paul.... for waiting up so long and then Mark and I never showing up. Yesterday Mark and I were shooting the Mercedes-Benz dealership on the corner of Highway 6 and 59 South in Houston. We left Austin late and made it to the dealership on time, but we had to forgo a trip to Adolph's house. We shot and shot and shot until about 1:15 a.m. Twelve Shots and all. Mark at that point decided he wanted to go home. He later began to regret his decision because not 15 min out of town we began driving through the worst fog I have ever seen in my life. Visability was about 25 ft. Seriously. We were both freaking out. Mark being his stubborn self and returning to Houston decided he would forge on. Thinking the Fog would let up. 3 hours later we were still on the edge of our seats driving a very dangerous 70 mph. We were going to die, I was convinced. Well we made it home despite Marks best efforts at around 4:30 a.m. I crept inside the house and scared the living daylights out of Liz and Bodi. Crawled into bed and slept till 10:30. Spent the rest of the day calling people. Went to a meeting with Action Figure. Then went over to Mark's house to see if my camera had arrived. Picked it up took it home.

 I'm back in Portland. All in all it's good to be home. Life is funny. I was just in Texas yesterday. And this morning I was once again scribbling the likenesses of my fellow public transiters into my little book. Chella has two dance classes today. Hannah starts up fencing tomorrow. there are a million things to get done. Laura has a show going up in March and another in April. We are building frames and getting slides made and getting promo stuff printed and organizing play dates for the kids and organizing the homeschooling co-op. Vacation was short and somehow......ya'll remember Tron. When they are on that shell like boat/plane and there is that energy pulse that is caught in front of the ship. Alot of shit to get done. Television is a waste of time. If you find yourself in front of it, remember, you are going to die someday and this is the one chance you have got to kick ass, there is so much to do that is real. colin.

 best cereal ever. One of the first ready-to-eat cereal products ever made available to the public, Grape-Nuts was first introduced in 1897. Made of wheat and malted barley, Grape-Nuts was so named because its inventor, Charles William Post, said that grape sugar was formed during the baking process and described the cereal as having a nutty flavor. Post was a pioneer in introducing and making popular cereal, a food product that today has become a standard breakfast staple.

 Current Favorite Cereal Plane Cheerios , Special K and Grape Nuts are probably my all time favorites, but for right now Quaker Squares is taking the cake. What are yours?

 &nbsp; &nbsp; i took these while talking to killy. unfortunately none of his skill rubbed off. none the less, i think the images are pretty neat. the sun was pouring in making everything look spraypainted. i wonder if the colors are intentional, or coincidental. either way it is a pretty neat effect.

 Weekend In San Antonio urlLink I just got back from a lovely weekend in San Antonio. The highlight of the trip was the amazing sunday morning gospel mass we attended at the Mount Zion First Baptist Church. The preacher was incredible, and his sermon kicked so much holy ass that I thought the roof was going to blow off of the church-hall. Since it was a memorial service, we were also lucky eneogh to hear a few words from the Rev. Claude Black Jr, one of San Antonio's outstanding citizens... The couple I was visiting also took me out to the Blue Star to see Sky Patterson's (a relation of theirs) latest show. Some of the compositions were pretty interesting, and the colors were pleasing. I had never been to Blue Star, is that where San Antonio has First Friday? To finish off the day we went hiking out at Friederich Park. It is a nice little hike in the shrinking Hill Country. We were attacked by a bear but I fought it off with my pocket knife. I was dissapointed not to have had a chance to see the Flynns, but maybe we can all get together for Flynn Fest 2004 this summer?

 Hello to ya'll. I am indeed here in texas. So close yet so far. Funny that all of ya'll are right down the street and yet I am still using the blog for interaction. I guess that is part of being a grown up. Learning to let someone elses needs surpass your own. The girls and I are going to eat lunch with my grandma today at her retirement city. Let her show the greatgrandkids off to the other craggy old folks. Tomorrow we once again engage in air travel and leave the sun for colder and wetter places. It is lovely to see the live oak trees, and the sun so big and the sky so blue. Come and vist. Colin.

 A Relaxing Weekend Friday, 6 p.m. Walked in the door to my room, pulled off my shoes and shirt, slipped under a thin blanket and slept. Saturday, 14 hrs. later I woke up at 8:30 or so, but didn't actually get out of the house till sometime around 2:30. We had a big, slow breakfast; we cleaned our room; did laundry; and put the kitchen back together. By the time adolfo iv had woken up from his nap, we were ready to head out. Got a haircut, and headed to the children's museum. Adolfo iv headed straight for the bubble machine (as usual) and mommy and daddy eyed the snack bar. Eventually, we all ate an early dinner there: pb&j sandwich, one chicken ceasar salad, and a bag of cheetos. We ended up at adolph's for a diaper change, but ended up taking the train downtown for coffee. Sunday, another early rise, but late start House hunting in the area just north of the north loop aroound ella, t.c. jester, 34th, and 43rd streets. We drove around a good while till adolfo iv started getting restless. We ended up taking him to CherryHurst Park just off of Fairview. He climbed, swung, ran, and played till he was worn out. One last stop before we head home for a long nap: lunch.

 It was pretty nice. The train stop is just over 500 paces from my office. The picture above is the scene at the Fannin St. Museum Station. When I arrived they had just dragged a car off the tracks. It was a car turning left in front of the train. I don't think it was a legal left since the train follows the lights, although in benefit-of-the-doubt land, I supposed you'd have to ask if the train ran the red. Notes: Dryden TMC stop has a Starbucks and a Chipotle and a Subway. I'm certain that they get mobbed during lunch, I can catch them on the way home. I need to find a dry cleaners on the route. I like my dry cleaners, the guy there knows me by name (most of the time), but it is over there on Almeda, not in my commute path at all. &nbsp In terms of the number of people using the train, I think that a lot of people are probably like me, you have an investment in your commute and it takes time to change it. You have to make sure it (a.) works and is reliable, (b.) doesn't take too much more time, (c.) has good stores and services on the route, and (d.) probably a lot of other stuff I am forgetting. If it has taken me an entire week to get out of my ruts and try the train, I'm certain a lot of other people are eye-balling it for the plunge. Related: urlLink Houston's Light Rail System

 Forced Perspective

 Snow Daze in Portland? No More Party? Wuh? urlLink

 Hey ya'll, I am still here in Portland. We were supposed to leave yesterday. Cancelled. We were supposed to leave today. Cancelled. We are supposed to leave tomorrow. The news says that the airport is closed untill 5:00 am tomorrow. Our flight is supposed to leave at 6:38 am. So it may turn out that we do not come to Texas at all. In all the years that I have lived up here in the Far reaches of the continent, it has only snowed twice. Both times it has been meerly for decorative purposes. Not functional snow. "Gone the next day" kinda snow. We are currently blanketed. At first it was the sort of rare blessing that you dream of. The Grey sky takes on a benevolent tone and the tiny crystalls descend in a wonderfull swirling flock. People you never even knew lived next door to you emerge from there television comas and step out into the world. I say this because, we often take walks around our neighborhood and we are the only people on the streets, ever, save for some disgrunteled dog walking units. But each and every house we walk past is illuminated by the blue glow of mass media. We are losing sight of reality as a society because of our own ability to let ourselves be entertained by the creative products of superficial greed. How much space in our collective minds can be filled with bullshit. Tangent. The wonderful snow. We walked for hours around in it. snow balls and a crunching sound underfoot. having all of the forgotten spots covered over to sleep for a bit. everything new and hopeful. The next day the snows cousin showed up. Freezing rain. At first it was interesing. Glass ball bearings falling by the thousands falling from the sky, and hitting me in the eye. so the "awe of change" wears off and all the happy people retire into the houses for hot choclate and jocking for position over the heater vents. All the while the ice falls in an innocent audible snaredrum roll. There is a two inch thick shell that completely encases my car. It is actually really interesting to pull large pieces of this off the vehicle and attempt, jigsaw style, to reassemble a hollow replica of the car. POINT BEING. We are unsure if we will make it to Texas at all. So I am writing long-wind-ed-ly to say that there shall be no wonder twin power meeting. No "FORM OF A FRIENDLY GATHERING!" No "SHAPE OF LAUGHING PEOPLE." ALAS, to you my good friends, I cannot tell to you how much my want to bask in your pressence. And how much I will miss this lost chance. OH well. Screw you all. I don't need friends............I've got my army of snow and ice to keep me company. c.

 The sabattical 1.7.04 - The last day of a seemingly long vacation (10:40 p.m.) The grand total time away from my little family was three and a half days; i missed them terribly. The first few hours were nice, but once i got to todd's house and lay my small frame in between the sheets of the king sized guest-room bed, i was aching for their fragrant bodies next to mine. It was after a nice salad dinner, a couple of beers, and some conversation that we ended up back at todd's house. We got high and played a few rounds of ghost recon. Maybe it was the drugs, but the game seemed much harder. I had troubled sleep. Aside from my absent family I had an overactive dream; not the kind that leave you with details, but the kind that leaves you with a bad taste in your brain, as if you've just had a taco full of cow brains. I made todd some creamy oatmeal and coffee (well, actually, todd brewed the coffee.). We ended up meeting taggart and liz at El Sol... before heading to san marcos where i would be left at Carl's place for the remainder of my stay in central texas. The first day was mostly settling in. We pulled into carl's around 1. We met carl's roommate, david; todd and carl had a brief talk about working on a new website. todd left soon afterward and i settled into the studio, where i would be sleeping. I unpacked myself and looked outside: cloudy. Really cloudy. The kinda cloudy that would rain on you the second you settled yourself outside. After i had copied over some Imacon tutorials that carl insist i watch before using the scanner, i pulled out my book and went for a walk around 'the grounds'. The light was flat, grey and uninspiring. I read and walked at the same time. I walked along his fence. I found a poorly lit shot, but figured that i had to shoot something. I pulled out my camera and shot -- slowly and deliberately. I got maybe half a roll. more to come...

 urlLink Ottmar Liebert: Mixed feelings about Garageband: Why would a child attempt to spend years learning a musical instrument when s/he could be making music with GarageBand instantly? It takes about 2-3 years of practicing to make music on any 'real" instrument. For most intents and purposes, the musical instrument is a rich interface for music creation. The idea isn't that computers or new technology to supplant traditional instruments, a la those 1980's synthesizers worn like guitars; the idea is eliminate all the expensive stuff preventing you from simply accomplishing a creative task. True, a Mac and assorted ya-ya aren't free, and GarageBand doesn't compete with the high-end stuff, but it is relatively inexpensive and it looks like it will do a good job. &nbsp; I'm wondering if Garageband will support the transfer of its working files, so that one person could do something, and then another person far away work on top of that, and so on and so on, to create new colaborative efforts that couldn't happen if you had to get everyone in the same room....

 I will post some directions....to my parents house......so you can get there.

 Adolph's physical expressive vocabulary is very strong indeed very strong indeed.

 This evening marks the first time I have ever video chatted with anyone. This isn't a new technology really, I followed urlLink CUseeMe software as it developed years ago, I think before PowerMacs were around. This evening, I finally talked to someone over the internet. In some ways, even though it has been around for years, it is still a technology in its infancy. The camera is an add-on cludge to the computer, even though it does have an elegant clamp-on perch and a short, non-tangly cable into the firewire port. But compared to text messaging, video and audio messaging is still limited. For example, it doesn't record the conversation as with text, and if it did, it would take up vast amounts of space on my hard drive (relatively). More importantly, perhaps, is that I do not have a physiological vocabulary that adds value to the video conversation other than "hey I can sit here or I can walk around with the computer and talk to you at the same time." In the larger scheme of things, motion pictures themselves have only been around for a hundred years or so; with that in mind if doesn't seem strange that my physical expressive vocabulary is limited. Sure, people have been watching each other talk since before there were written words, but motion picture transmision is far different--it rewards a different set of movements and lighting, which reflects the its gamut of experience is more limited than that of live in person. I wonder if my kids will live in a world where one's physical vocabulary will be as important in communications as one's verbal?

 urlLink A Republican Nader? - The third-party candidate Democrats want and need. By Timothy Noah : "Political scientists argue about whether Ross Perot's 19 percent of 1992's popular vote put Bill Clinton in the White Houseâ€?it hinges on whether you think Perot voters would have otherwise voted Democratic, Republican, or not at allâ€?but Chatterbox, who covered that race for the Wall Street Journal, always felt at the gut level that Perot's appeal was more powerful to potential supporters of George H.W. Bush. Exit polls contradict Chatterbox's gut; they showed Perot voters splitting their preferences fairly equally between Clinton and Bush. But a survey by Clinton pollster Stanley Greenberg found that Perot voters had a 'largely Republican voting history.' The 2000 election, of course, was so absurdly close that just about anything--including Ralph Nader's 3 percent of the popular vote, which otherwise would probably have gone to Al Gore--can be called a determining factor." As a two time Perot voter I've always wondered how he stacked up against Nader in 2000. Interestingly, Slate quotes the same "pollster" as Nader. urlLink Infoplease.com sez: "He garnered 19% of the popular vote in '92, and 8% in '96, testimony to voters' disillusionment with the traditional two-party system."

 urlLink Why Ralph? : According to the exit polls conducted by Democratic pollster Stanley Greenberg, fully 25% of his votes came from Republicans, 38% from Democrats, and the remainder from people who would not have voted. No other American leader can be credited with such broad appeal across the divides of our polarized nation. Hmmmm, given Nader's relatively slim plurality, it would seems unfair to characterize his appeal as broad; it would seem more like "narrow appeal across the divides . . . ."

 urlLink Mac 911 Weblog: It's the Standard, Stupid : "The same people who buy inexpensive players are also purchasing music online from sources other than the iTunes Music Store and thereby amassing collections of music that are incompatible with the iPod. What are the odds that these people will become iPod owners if their music collections wonâ€™t play on it?" Feel free to enter your single digit answer here." I think that the economic model the assertion is made on is flawed in that the larger part of most people's digital music collections is composed of DRM-free MP3 files encoded from their libraries of compact disks. In the future this may or may not change. The early adopters or the second wave of adopters have certainly taken to music downloads, but there still exist many technical hurdles before non-computer savvy people are able to download music and feel comfortable doing it. The other half of the Apple's loss leader in the iTunes Music Store is the iTunes music management software, which like the music download service is the industry leader both in sales and design. More than any other system, it stands a chance of enabling non-technical people to enjoy how their personal computer can enhance their audio experience.

 Thanks for the advice, everyone!! I have OS version 10.2 -- I think I will try Adolph's idea of burning through the Finder first and, if that doesn't work, I'll look into upgrading my system or getting the Burnz software. The program was created in Power Point and only has photos and text, no movies. The way I burned the CD was just by dragging the files onto the CD icon and then dragging the CD icon to the black and yellow burn icon at the bottom of the screen (where the trash usually is) ...

 Baby was asleep this morning, slumbering and dreaming away the wee hours of the morn while Daddy showered and dressed and then Mommy following suit. Daddy makes coffee, baby still sleeps, pink pudgy lips drooping open towards the bed where he rests his fat cheek, he doesn't need a pillow. Mommy holds baby close, humming and singing his special baby song. Baby's fingers spread like wings and then curl like eyelashes to rest again on the warm bed. Otherwise he doesn't stir. In the kitchen, life bubbles in the coffee maker, Daddy zooms in and out with last minute gatherings. Lunch is already packed for the week, cooked up late last night by Mommy. Papas con Huevos and a serving of oatmeal for breakfast. Chicken, squash and rice for lunch, Sweet Rice Atole and diced fruit for desert. Baby still slumbers. Mommy quickly dresses, then softly changes baby's diaper, wet with last night's feedings. Quietly and carefully Mommy changes baby out of his PJs and into his jeans and soccer shirt. Socks and shoes follow. Baby doesn't wake, he stretches a little, then drops off into dreamland once more. Finally, in Daddy's arms and near the door, baby's eyes open slowly, first one, then the other, flutter into awakefulness. He smiles. We open the door and baby looks out in to the still slumbering world. The dew is still in the air.

 PPT Frustrations These are exactly the sorts of things i hear from doctors that come to the institution with mac burned cds every now and then. Most of the time, though, it's a mistake they made rather than a problem with the disk. Can't really say much without being there, really. What were the laptops running? What kind of mac do you have? How old is your version of ppt? Lots of questions....few answers, sorry.

 hello Amber. What OS are you running on your mac? One of the early versions of 10? if so that is most likely the problem. We had the exact same problem, which was not specific to PowerPoint, when we first upgraded. it seems that the original burning software made discs that did not play nice with Windows, most notably Windows 98. Some options to consider : 1. upgrade your OS, or, 2. pick up a copy of the urlLink Burnz software adolph mentioned. Either of those shoudl do the trick and provide hours of PowerPointing Pleasure.

 Amber, (1.) Was the presentation originally made in PowerPoint, or was it made in something else, like Keynote? (2.) Does the PowerPoint contain anything other than pictures (i.e. movies)? (3.) How did you burn the CD? I've noticed that if you make a disk image first and then burn, then Win98 computers can't see the disk, but if you burn though the Finder, then it works fine. I've been using urlLink Burnz to make disks now though, because it offers increased compatibility options. Burnz is free for the first 10 disks and $12.50 for use thereafter. (4.) If you can get to the presentation computer ahead of time, make a really simple PowerPoint, burn it to disk and see if you can get it to run.

 So I went to the Brooklyn Botanic Gardens today to give a 6-hour comprehensive presentation all about tropical plants -- and then, it happened -- that nightmare event that so far I had only dreamed about and feared -- my power point files didn't open!! I had saved the slide shows as .ppt files on my Apple computer and then burned them onto a disc -- when I then tried to open them on the garden's IBM lap-tops, the CD-ROM icon showed up, along with the file folder called "Presentations," but when I clicked on the file folder to get to the files, a message came up saying "Folder is empty" ... so I tried opening Power Point and then opening the files from within the program and got the message "Unable to access files ..." I thought I had made a mistake in burning the CD ... but when I got home, I was able to open the disc and open the files on my computer --- does anyone know what went wrong??? Please help!!

 I'm working hard filling up the new 160 gig hard drive to make sure it doesn't have any bad spots, unlike the last one. It is hard to fill up that much space! Nader , one the one hand it is cynical to say, "Nader, don't run because you will gurantee the the current president is the next president," on the other hand you have to wonder if Nader doesn't like being the opposition so much that he would like to see the ruin of us all so he can keep on saying "I've been telling you so!" I was thinking about this last week and wondering, "did the Greens have a vote at some point to select Nader as their presidential candidate?" Was it just decided in some smoke filled room? (You know the kind of smoke.) Is Nader ver.2 (Now without bothering with this Green Party stuff) just a Lyndon La Rouche perennial candidate without a hope, just there to get 15 minutes every 4 years? Whatever happened too all that "building the Green Party" stuff that had to do with electing local Green Party candidates? I haven't heard of Nader stopping by to stump for any around here. In the larger picture, his candidacy can be seen as a criticism of main-line Democratic Party corporate corruption, I guess. But if most main-line Democratic candidates are now saying something about trade agreements that benefit corporations more than citizens, why wouldn't you get gung-ho and get a place at the table? RFID coupled with GPS, wireless networking and an Amazon.com style search and find system would be the most fantastic thing for libraries and bookstores. Imagine a library where nothing was shelved in order, only the order in which it came in or was reshuffled. Maybe little bookshelf crawling robots to fetch far-away titles too. It would be like those research libraries where librarians fetch the stuff for you, you only have access to the card catalogue and wait at a study carol and turn in a little card with what you want and then they fetch it. I'm not certain if that would make for a quality retail experience though...

 Well. as is my only commentary, no sparkling blurbs on technical gazidtry, and reformatting systems to realign perspectives on geo political party assertions. To comment on Ambers comments. I am frustrated by the work situation. mostly out of my own inability to grab it by the throat and take a stand on self created ground. I still am schleping to the check of corporate bohemoths to spend my time and hard fought creativity on the production of useless crap. creating yet another strategy to extract the cash from the pockets of the people. Hey who wants a pair of fucking shoes? How about some cool? we got that over here. Not convinced? well if you start to see through that bullet proof ad campaign, I'll just come up with graphic information that's composed on an abstract emotional level to disorient your scepticism. Yes this is a bit acidic. Yes I do feel the slave. Yes I am only as much a slave as I let myself be. But once again, I leave "work" and make my way through a conglomeration of other peoples intentions and directions stacked on each other to build this coral of commerce and wind my way walking through street of neighbors that do not speak to each other. What happened to a friend in my path smiling? Finally I arrive at a door. I open this door and inside is something wholly and completely different to me as nothing I have ever known. I am once again a simple part of things true and real and simple. Light comes from my hand switching on that light and lighting that candle and kissing that cheek and wipping that tear and hearing that laughter. sitting to a table with these three girls who wait each day for me to come home. presenting me with a day full of difference. Emotional expression that has no place in that place that I spend so many heart beats and breaths. But in this house I know why I do that fighting and striving for those monies. I am still so much in awe of how much I do not know. How much one can never know. How I shall stand, and learn as best I can to do so in a manner with truth.

 SD-10: Fun with Perspective So here is another 'waiting for Carol to pick me up' shot. Here, I shot the new research bldg from across the street around 4:50 P.M. today. I'm kinda new at this fixing perspective thing, so bear with me as i struggle through it. You'll notice the second bldg looks a little keystoned at the bottom right, not to mention the distortion in the line of windows lodged in that pink 'capital' limestone; i should have pulled out the bottom anchor a little more to fix this...

 You know, I forgot about how I still write what a lot of people read. I guess it is a mark of something when you're doing something and don't really realize exactly what you are doing so much as just doing it. I used to write a column every week in the university paper, then that zine we did and I thought that I had stopped. In reality, I just found another publication, I send out over 12,000 emails every couple of weeks for people to read. In the last one, there were over 6,000 unique opens and 12,000 total opens. The difference between the two numbers comes from people opening it up more than once or forwarding it on to other people who open it up. Of course, I'm not just writing whatever comes into my head, or following whatever spurious leads disgruntled professors or staff feed me. Now a days it is a fight for focus and relevance, trying to take all the stuff that the place I works for wants to communicate and formulate it so that people read it. It is a different challenge, and something I forgot I was doing until just now.

 In our family, Anthony will be the Mr. Mom, while I go out every day to earn a living ... of course, he earns his living from home already .. but having a Junior/Juniorette to look after will add a whole new dimension to his work day -- I wonder just how much work he will actually be able to do between tending to baby ... and, of course, like Carol and every other mom who has to leave her child, I'm sure I will also feel those parting pangs and envy my man for having so much bonding time ... and he will maybe envy me for having the freedom to walk out the door every day at 7 a.m. ... life is so complicated ... it's interesting reading that so many of us are experiencing these things at around the same time. I like Carol and Killy's solution of facing life's obstacles with a song ... Colin, maybe what defines you as a man is not so much the day to day grind of earning The Living but the gradual creation of something larger: life and dreams and song and the hope and love and promise you see reflected in your children's eyes when they look at you, the one who makes it all possible. Life viewed in the near may look like muddled stains on the floor, but viewed over months or years it becomes a multi-colored landscape of breathtaking complexity and richly layered meanings, of unanticipated turns and forks in the road, of valleys that go on and on, only to be capped by glorious peaks, and of interconnected threads that lead you to become the person you were always meant to be. Things never change. Then, unexpectedly, they do.

 Paul and I are already using a version assistive technology called CVS, or Concurrent Version Control. I haven't spent enough time learning about VersionCue, but it strikes me as a similar technology with Adobe's products in mind. Paul and I use CVS to make sure we don't step on each other's work. CVS does a number of handy things: 1. It acts as a central repository for our collective work. 2. It keeps a history of the versions of each file in the collective work. 3. If Paul and I are editing the same file at different places, it merges the two different changes. 4. If Paul and I modify the same portion of the same file in incompatible ways, it lets us know that we have a conflict that we need to work out. I don't plan to every work on a web project without it, because it keeps you safe with very little overhead. That said, it is a bit of a pain to set up if you aren't familiar with it and the command line. Likewise, I am looking forward to using VersionCue. I am a little wary of it as it looks like a pretty proprietary solution. What if it goes the way of that mysterious "Publish and Subscribe. . ." or OpenDoc technology in Mac OS 7? Still I think the key sentence is: Say good-bye to awkward file names like "brochure_1," "brochure_2," or even "brochure_final_final.psd." Please, please Adobe, deliver us from nonversioning filesystem evil!

 Chuang Tze's Brother

 Word brother, I hear what your saying about the manlihood of earning the income. The fucking shit is, I can earn a living but does that compose the whole of me as a man. sometimes it seems like the only thing that defines me as male or man is this function. All the functions of attracting the female and reproducing have been taken care of, I have proved my potency, so now all that seems to remain is that of being an earner. It's fucked up, especially when there are more then your own thoughts and feelings involved. Kids take all situations and add such dimension.

 SD-10: Recent Work - Texas Medical Center This is the Heart Hospital next door to MD Anderson on Bates St. & Bertner. I took this shot at around 6: 30 or so.

 The 2nd Night (misery!) and and the 3rd Morning On a totally normal night with no interruptions we got in the door at just before 7:00 P.M. Adolfo had refused to nap yesterday. He was exhausted, but he was also sooooo angry at carol (both of us, really), but he also wanted to BE with his mama so badly. He was crying and whining hard the whole time. We figured he was just exhausted since he hadn't napped, so carol took him to bed. He fell asleep, but then woke up crying. then, he fell asleep again; then, woke up crying.... (repeat till 11:30) Carol was pretty frustrated. She never really had dinner = angry/frustrated wife. @ 11:30 the baby fully woke up. He was endlessly crying. Nothing would settle him. We thought maybe he was sick in some way or bothered by a diaper rash...nuthin'...no rubbing ears, no extraordinary gas, no red rash on the behind, nuthin'... He got down off the bed and in the lamplight, threw a tantrum as never before. Carol and i were stunned. All we could do was watch him. He shook his head as he stood against the bed and hit the side of the bed with his little fists. Then, he threw himself down on the floor and started kicking. He got up and did it again.... After letting this go on for about a minute, i tried to pick him up. He would have none of me. Carol picked him up and he calmed down a bit. We tried to re-assure him, love him, but it just didn't matter what we did. Finally, we did the only thing we could do....we sang. We sang, 'Down by the Bay' and 'The Rock Candy Mountain' quietly, and with that ... he slept, but restlessly. Mommy had to bear the full brunt of his restlessness throughout the night. Poor Carol. I should get her another massage. At one point in the evening i had consulted 'the book' ( What to Expect the First Year ) about Separation Anxiety. Apparently, this is a pretty common occurance for mtoher's who are full time workers. The child is away from her all day and at night sees sleeping as another 'loss' of the mother's attention and time, so he fights it. This is hard to bear as much as a reality as it is. It is at these times that i berate myself especially hard for not being the 'breadwinner' of my little family. Inevitably I question my 'manlihood' (whatever that is). Why can't a let my wife be home with my son? What more can i do?

 CS Suite We've installed the CS suite here at work. I'm rolling through the tutorials that were included in the software. My boss is also ordering about 48 hours worth of CD tutorials on the individual programs. Has anyone been using urlLink VersionCue ? Pondering over what i've seen today, i think todd, paul, and adolph would really gain something from looking at this stuff....

 The 2nd Day & a quick poster comment Today, he knew. He knew that when his mother put him down she would leave so he kept her close. The first time she tried to put him down he clutched at her -- hard. So she waited a bit. Eventually she got him down, but he kept her close, showing her the chairs and some of the other kids. He clamored to be picked up again, so she picked him up. Then, Bernie (teacher #2) came in. Adolfo iv gives Bernie a kiss-kiss. Carol quickly transfers adolfo to her arms and says 'bye-bye!' His face explodes and contorts to what we call his 'poochie' face. Carol walks out the door and as she looks back through the windows of the classroom only to see his face red and wet with tears. She called me right after she left. She wasn't crying this time, just a little sad. I would think that posters like this still exist, but the majority of us don't visit too many free clinics anymore, which is where (i think) a lot of these sorts of posters are hung.

 Why dont they have posters like this anymore? urlLink

 "My God, what is this?" - President James A. Garfield On July 2, 1881, in a Washington railroad station, an embittered attorney who had sought a consular post shot the President. urlLink Mortally wounded , Garfield lay in the White House for weeks. Alexander Graham Bell, inventor of the telephone, tried unsuccessfully to find the bullet with an induction-balance electrical device which he had designed. On September 6, Garfield was taken to the New Jersey seaside. For a few days he seemed to be recuperating, but on September 19, 1881, he died from an infection and internal hemorrhage.

 Happy Presidents Day!

 Adolfo IV Goes To School I am more worried for carol than adolfo. She called me from the North Loop this morning, crying. "Babe, how'd he do?" " -*sob*- -*sniff*- He's....fine... -*sob*- -*sniff*-.... He didn't even notice i was -*sob*- gone..." We spent our entire Sunday afternoon getting ready for this week. We (adolfo and i) began the morning with an episode of urlLink Jakers , the cutest show on television. Then, once mom woke up, we went out to Taquitos (paul's favorite mex breakfast joint outside the loop) for breakfast. He ate about half a papas con huevo taco and some orange juice before he clamored to be let out of his seat. Luckily for me, i'm a fast eater. The rest of the day, carol cooked. All in total she prepared four full sized meals - all neatly sealed in tupperware containers for the rest of the week: 1. Spaghetti - this, of course, is too simple a name. It is spaghetti with a mild italian sausage, chunky garden sauce (ragu), cubed zuchinni, and yellow squash. 2. Chicken and Rice - This is one of adolfo's favorites. Rice cooked in fresh tomatoes and onion, with chicken wings boiled in. The meat is then stripped off the bone for a soft yummy meal. 3. Mediterranean Black Bean Soup - I think she just followed the instructions outside the bean mix, but it's still a hearty soup. 4. Oatmeal - Quaker Oat oatmeal with condensed milk and cinnamon sticks. Adolfo's first lunch will be the Chicken and Rice with seedless red grapes (all of them cut in half.) See his urlLink schedule here. If anything, he will be extremely well fed.

 So, little killito is going to be having his first day of school today! everyone send kind thoughts to killy and carol as they face the hardship of leaving their little bundle of joy in the caring and capable hands of strangers.

 if the SD-10 makes movie files that end in .AVI you can import them directly into iMovie without converting them. i am pretty sure you can do that with .MOV files as well, but adolph generally knows what he is talking about.

 Liz, Typically still cameras do not have a video direct to computer mode. To put a camera into iMovie, you have to do a few things: (1.) make movie on camera, (2.) transfer movie file from camera to computer, (3.) change mpeg or mov file from camera into a iMovie-ready dv file with Quicktime Pro, and (4.) import the .dv file into iMovie. On high-end digital SLR's, like the SD-10, the Firewire interface is for special software meant to operate the camera and move picture files. Most do not even take short movies since the shutter remains closed over the sensor. Your results may vary.

 just wanted to give you the flashing banner of my life i was recently in a car accident super small fender bender no injuries... my baby poked his little eye at home, not in the car, i was all alone during the accident and he cried and cried and cried i eat donuts every friday at work and lots of chocolate during the week nothing else really but it's all good.

 Walking I caught this shot one weekend morning as we were walking around the block towards Lost Creek Park. Here's the iphoto info: I had it set on the 'Vivid' setting; other canon owners will know what i'm talking about. Hence, the extraordinarily blue sky (it WAS pretty nice outside, however). I'm a little puzzled about the max aperture (f/3) line, tho. Can anyone explain this? The exposure for this shot was f/5.6, the exposure for other darker shots has been 2.8. I don't know where this f/3 comes from. I worked it in photoshop. I brought it in and created a duplicate layer. I used an levels adjustment layer to brighten the tree (and the sky with it) and then selected all the branches using the wand. I then, created a mask with the branch selection, and inversed it and painted over it with the paintbrush with the opacity set to about 30%, bringing out the branches a little at a time. Then, just for kicks, i put a diffuse glow on the branches to make it pretty.

 Coffee Morning I wish i had remembered to bring my mmc card reader so i could have included a picture right as i'm posting this. Carol and i woke up around 8 with the baby, changed his diaper and put him in front of the t.v. (jay jay the jet plane) so we could get ourselves together and prepare some breakfast. After a big breakfast of eggs, rice, pancakes, apple juice and milk we cleaned up and headed out of the house for some coffee (we ran out of regular coffee about two days ago and have consistently forgotten to pick some up at kroger.)

 Option Period - OVER Well, the option period is done with. We have come to an agreement on price & repairs. The next step is getting through the long process with the bank. I've already done a good amount of shopping for insurance; i think i've found who i want to carry my policy. The next big step is connecting all the dots; the dots being the urlLink title company , urlLink the bank , and the urlLink insurance company . Everyone has to get everyone else's name and fax number. There's a tremendous amount of paper pushing (i would imagine) going on behind the scenes. One morning recently I heard the current housing numbers; If i remember correctly, they were surprisingly robust compared to speculations. Going through this process i can see how this is easily an economic indicator: so many people involved, so many companies (realtors, inspectors, lawyers, insurance agents, brokers, contractors, loan officers, appriasers...) and they all receive their piece of the pie at closing. Fees, Fees, Fees..... title writing fee, money wiring fee, lawyer fees, appraisal fee....etc.... So i am being a good American, a good citizen ...

 Option Period - Day 8 Reading over the inspection report and deciding which repairs i can do and which i should have the sellers do... thinking...deciding....

 Option Period - Day 7 (Tuesday) I spent this day shopping around for homeowners insurance. I had to send over the inspection report so they could run the quote. AMICA was the most competative quote. If all goes well, i'll probably go with them. (Referred to me by my former financial consultant, Howard Peel).

 Option Period - Day 6 (cont'd) Steve, the inspector greeted me with a firm handshake and an apology for running a little bit late. We knocked on the door and the sellers answered the door - both of them AND their two year old son. I wasn't expecting this. I thought for sure that they would leave the house so it could be inspected, mainly cause this is probably one of the more upsetting things for a seller to go through: a man running through your house telling the buyer what is wrong with it, ultimately resulting in necessary repairs and/or a reduction in value. There wasn't much we could do... Steve strapped on knee pads & his utility belt and got straight to work. He turned on all the water, crawled around the attic, stepped on the roof, pulled out electric outlets, checked the uptake and other miscellaneous crawl spaces... I followed him for the most part, but took a few detours to familiarize myself a little more with the place. The place was cute. I could see my family living there. I could see adolfo running in the backyard; i could see carol cooking in the kitchen.... The termite inspector and her assistant showed up. After about 45 mins of poking around, they found live termites in the front of the house. Treatment necessary. I was making my own list of repairs i could do; taking down the trouble spots on the landscaping; making a list of tools that i didn't have... All the while the sellers were quickly trying to respond to things the inspector would point out. Bulbs were missing in several outlets, so they would scramble to get bulbs from their garage; One outlet had a hot wire on it, so the husband ran off to Home Depot and bought a new plug to replace it. It went on like this for a couple of hours. Eventually their agent showed up, summarily ignored me, shook the hand of my inspector handed him a card, and wisked his clients out of the house. This all happend in the blink of an eye. I'm sure he told them to not be there for the inspection...who knows why they stayed. We had the last hour to ourselves to check out the remainder of the house. I got a grand tour of all his findings all with digital photos... Overall - a nice old house that needs some repairs. Most Necessary - Termite Treatment, water heater replacement, air conditioner servicing, electrical grounding.... Total Time : 3 1/2 hours.

 Option Period - Day 6 I'm typing this out a full day later .... I dropped carol off at work and adolfo iv off at school. He didn't go all that gracefully. I left quickly enough so i had enough of my heart left... I drove around the neighborhood. I watched all the kids file into Scarbarough H.S., which is just two blocks down. Most of the kids were dropped off or were walking in from 43rd street. I pulled into Georgi st to see if any kids were filing out of mangum manor specifically ... i didn't notice any. I cruised the streets looking at lawns, noticing which properties had old people sitting out front (quite a few), finding all the outlets to mangum, antoine, and 43rd streets, and listening most importantly... so wonderfully quiet. I took a good long drive down antoine. Not a starbucks in sight. A lot of small businesses, which was nice. I saw a lot of mexican 'La Tapatia-esque' places, but none with any character to speak of. I dropped by St. Ambrose Catholic Church and picked up a bulletin. It's right around the block from our place. I would guess it's somewhere between .5 and .75 mi from the house. I arrived at the property at about 9:30. I parked across the street and gave myself some time to walk down the block. All the surrounding houses were clean and well kept. The yards were well trimmed and raked. There was no standing water anywhere on the street. ****I mention that cause Maru/Mike's new house had some putrid standing water on the street in front of their place several days after it had rained. It was the ONLY water down the entire block.**** I struck up a converstation with who may become my immediate neighbor. Her name was anna, 60, and she was staying with her parents who had become too old to really take care of themselves. Her father was standing at the garage just smiling. He couldn't see too well, apparently. She gave me the scoop on most of the neighbors, and on the immediate block: most of our neighbors are fairly old; some have small pets, but most don't. A woman across the street home schools her two boys (aged 14,9). An older gentleman across the street came out of his house and shuffled around his driveway talking to himself. Anna gave me a smirk, "He talks to himself, but he's the sweetest man. He comes over and watches my parents from time to time. He also happens to be the yard man for the church..." The older man goes back and forth on his driveway and then disappears around the corner of his house. "He's probably going to come over later and ask who you were..." We talked about her yard and about the pear tree she just planted smack dab in the front yard. The 'seller's' Rottweiller poked it's head between a break in a fence plank and stared at us. She turned, and then gave me a look that told me she hated dogs....or, at least, that particular dog. "Do YOU have any pets?" she asked. I just smiled and said no. At that point, my inspector pulled up.... (to be continued.....)

 If things work out well, we will be in Austin this weekend! Keep an eye out for the Chavezes on the horizon!

 Option Period - Day 3 The Inspectors are coming monday at 10 o'clock. I took the day off so i can be there all day. And now i have little to do but wait for my contract to show up in the mail; wait for my new sprint phone to be delivered; and sleep... Precious sleep, where have you been?

 Killy writes: ". . . they still need original copies . . ."

 Option Period - Day 2 cont'd We've put a bid on a house. We've exectued the contract. This essentially closes off the property from any other bids until we're done with them. Although we have essentially agreed on a 'price' this doesn't necessarily mean this is the price we will pay. Now begins (besides the option period) a time of specific information gathering about the house. Next, i schedule a home inspection. The easiest thing to do is find someone who has bought a home recently and get a recommendation. You can search all day for inspectors on the internet and the yellow pages and still be just as lost as you were when you started. I called Doyle and got a recommendation from him. End of story. I've also got to schedule a termite inspection. For this one, i'm going with the lady my realtor has recommended to me - mainly because i just don't have anyone else who could recommened a bug inspector to me (can you?). She lives and works in the area. At the same time, the bank has to get started on it's work. I've sent them all pertinent financial documents, but they still need original copies of bank statements and other misc forms. (Remember that: original documents). I had a copy of the executed contract sent over to them so they can get the paperwork started on the loan. I also called an insurance agent at my credit union do to a check on the property for any claims made on that property. Result: 0. I also had her give me an estimate for Homeowners Insurance and a Flood Policy. This is when i found out that, contrary to my assumption, i WAS NOT in a high risk flood area. As a matter of fact I am in an 'X' zone, denoting a minimal risk of flooding. The numbers came back: about 2000/yr for home ins and 248/yr for flood. She thought that was a little high, so i should shop around. I contacted another insurance agent today and sent him on a quest for more affordable insurance for me. The quote should come back sometime tomorrow, hopefully. I'll prolly schedule the inspection for sometime early next week; probably monday. Once all the inspections are done and the bank sends out the appraiser and surveyor, the real fun starts. Everyone returns to the negotiating table and tries to work out any problems that may have arisen from the various inspections - and potentially the price gets re-negotiated. Possibilities Include: Structural, mechanical or plumbing problems that need to be taken care of before the house will be bought. or The house is appraised for less than it's being sold for. (This is my biggest fear - a real potential deal killer) So this is where I am at right now in case anyone was wondering.

 Option Period - Day 2 Adolfo IV fought waking up. He fought his diaper change; he fought getting dressed; he fought to get into the car seat... It was shaping up to be a miserable day. Carol was running late for work. I spent the majority of the day shopping for homeowners insurance. I also got ahold of Doyle, who pointed me in the direction of a good home inspector in the area; he's a little more expensive, but extremely thorough, respectable, and knowledgeable. The further I get into homebuying the more i look back at what i've done so far - the more i second guess my every move. I'm trudging ahead, though, and trusting that i'm educating myself enough and have assembled a pretty good team of people to help me along the way: my agent and my lender. It's hard to trust myself. That prolbably doesn't reveal a very healthy self-image, but it's the truth. My head is spinning with all the information.

 After I read about urlLink Spoken Interface I opened up the Speech control panel of my computer. Turning it on is like having a whole different computer. Instead of contorting my left hand into &lt;command&gt;&lt;tab&gt; to switch between apps, I just say "Switch to Safari." "iChat with Killy." "Connect to server." It is amazing what it is capable of. The next day, or maybe it was later that afternoon, O'Reillynet.com posted this article on speech with the Mac, which is a pretty good place to start if you are interested in exploring what it is capable of: urlLink MacDevCenter.com: Are You Talking to Me? Speech on Mac OS X [Mar. 17, 2004] Once you turn on the extended controls for assistive devices, the speech recognizer is able to control most things on the screen.

 Move On!

 Option Period - Day 1 All the paper's have been signed and the option period begins. The next ten days is a window in which we can leave the contract without question, so now is the time for home inspectors, bug inspectors, appraisers and surveyors. I've been shopping around and have begun getting estimates on all the necessary insurances: flood, homeowners...etc... This is when the real fun begins. Our home is still lightyears away, it seems. Here are some interesting facts about the area: - The nearest fire station is exatly .3 miles from home. - The Hispanic population of Oak Forest/Garden Oaks area is 15,440 - Two of my neighbors are lawyers. - One of my neighbors is co-owner of a pawn shop (I read her application for business license online) - The apprasied value of 4126 Donna Lynn has more than doubled since 1990. - My home has never flooded. - There is a park right around the corner. Anyone know any good (or bad!) Home Inspectors? I'm really looking for someone who might know who NOT to use.

 A google image search reveals a picture of Chard. Maybe Mr. Lettuce was thinking about his other girl friend "Ms. Chard" when he was hittiiin' it up with the Weed.

 I encourage you to cultivate your insanity, Paul!! Did you know that Salvador Dali used to on occasion fall asleep with an egg in his hand so that he would remain on the verge of sleep for as long as possible, where the imagination is most lucid and ripe with creativity or insanity or both -- he would start to doze off and, then, just as the egg would start to roll from his hand he would jerk awake ... he continued to do this apparently over the course of an evening until he had gathered together some pretty far out material to inspire his art. I, for one, would applaud a painting that depicted the love affair between a lettuce and a mer-lettuce ....

 I think I am going crazy

 I Personally think you should dress the little guy up like a some furry creature and slather his face in mud and possibly roll him in some fecal matter. That always helped me win friends and influence others. makes for a funny picture. just think, when he's older and he calls you from jail again, ya'll can laugh about that one time you got him all dressed up for pictures by getting advice from friends.

 Hey Todd........do you have Mark English's contact info? Amber.....You and Anthony looking to relocate? Killy........are ya'll buying a house? You take your eye off the blog for a little bit and everything changes.

 So I made a list, two lists really -- in one column I wrote down all the things that make me feel passionate ... in the other I wrote all the things that make me miserable. Why? To figure out what I should be doing with my life, of course. Here it is: PASSION New ideas, creativity, helping others, teaching, forging mental connections with other people, presenting an interesting idea to a group, designing gardens, reading, learning, solving problems, physical activity, interacting with new people, places, ideas, & situations, fighting for a just cause, philosophy, living with integrity, hard work, teamwork, nature, water, plants, animals, growth, planting, planning ... MISERY Corporate America, rules without reason, micro managers, routines, lack of purpose, mundane tasks, menial labor, laziness, escapism, glib, glossy, & shallow interactions, greed, polite conversation, questions and answers that involve an utter lack of thought, blatant dishonesty, manipulation, wasting time ... hmmmmm ... am I any closer to discovering what I should do with my life? I don't know ... still doesn't seem very clear. Am I missing something really obvious here? Probably.

 I vote for brainiac -- a cute nerdy little bow-tie would be really sweet, too ... but might not go over that well with the other kids -- hmmm, maybe stick with the v-neck and khakis ...

 Beware the Ides of March!!!!!

 Links To Your Left

 I'm partial for the brainiac look, but the jock would be totally cute too! I NEED PAUL'S WEBSITE!!!!!!

 Can you please re-post the link and instructions for using the amazing uploader thingy? That would be super great! Also, DeVida says HI! Also How's the job and hey what happened to all the archives??? Is it just my computer or are they no longer accessible? The new goings on about town. Killito will be taking his first school pictures on Wednesday!!! Please submit your votes today. Should he dress as a 1.) Jock - Tennies, running shorts, a Sports shirt of some sort and a baseball cap (all sports themes represented) 2.) Brainiac - V neck sweater, kakhis, sensible brown boot shoes (nothing really matches) 3.) Ladies' man - Dress Pants, Dress Shirt, Dress shoes, jewelry (think shiny, black/red combo) 4.) Ivy Leaguer - Polo Shirt, Sweater tied around his neck, slacks, boat shoes (think pastel) I'm torn...

 Todd, don't you know Spanisch and Quarkish? urlLink Graphic Designer and Layout

 Making DVDs At adolph's instruction i tried to image one of the photoshop training videos. It won't work. Disk Utility in os x won't let me do it cause i don't have 'permission' and disk copy in os 9 won't do it cause it's too big (greater than 2 gigs). Any suggestions?

 I think Home Depot sells islands. Typically they are usually off the coast of georgia, south carolina, florida, or oregon. Buy a condo.

 I'm glad Google knows what we are interested in:

 Hey Killy, There is a stove fix-it place over by my place on Almeda. Island's, well you typically have to save up a few million megabux, but there are some in the world for sale. Ha, I'm joking, you can get them at Rent-A-Center, along with a giant screen TV, perfect for watching the game when you are supposed to be knocking down walls. Small bathrooms in older houses? You are looking at the wrong older house. The house I grew up in (1920's) had a larger bathroom than the place I'm in now, which is so large that I've thought about moving into it. Then again, maybe I was just smaller in the memories of the house I grew up in, as my memory of the bathtub is that it was enormous. Didn't you have something about a house that has been used, Killy?

 The Question still Remains So.... Are you farting less?

 urlLink I started eating yogurt because Colin said Laura said it makes you fart less. I'm still scared of any flavor other than peach, but I've gown to have enough of a taste for peach that I have started to care about my yogurt packaging. This comes to mind because I just opened up a package of Archer Farms (Target grocery house brand) and it is the kind where it has a little resealable lid with a plastic seal underneath. Why is this? Do people really eat half a thing of yogurt and then cap it off, "mmm, mm, I'm full!" on 6 ounces of material? I know my grandmother reuses yogurt and cottage cheese plastic containers to hold chex mix and the like, but neither seems to present much of a business case for the additional packaging. I think this is why I appreciate Yoplait's minimal packaging. There is just a little foil seal at the top and voila, you're in and you aren't wondering "Do I keep this lid around in case I don't finish all 6 ounces?

 The price of a house, variable; house hunting, priceless Well, Amber the price of houses varies from place to place, from neighborhood to neighborhood, suburb to suburb. In the area that we are looking there are houses that range from 80,00 to however much we would like to pay, so there is a good spread. The houses we are looking at in Oak Forest are older houses, built in the fifties (i think the earliest i've seen was built in '48) which means that the bathrooms are generally smaller and located in the hallways rather than attached to any one bedroom. The idea of a 'master bath' simply doesn't exist unless the previous owners have updated it (and with updates come price increases). For this reason alone, am i even remotely considering living a little further out so that i can get the larger bathroom that exists in more modern homes. I like big bathrooms, i hate small sinks. I hate having to wash my hands 'in sections, cause i can't fit my entire hand under the stream of water. I hate having to stretch un-naturally to reach the toilet paper while stiting down. I have lived in apartments too long. Carol is adamant about living in the city. She hates the drive. I hate the drive myself but find my head spinning whenever she begins talking about the houses we've seen. Most conversations go like this: Carol: "This kitchen is nice and big. There's plenty of room for us to put an island right here, and it's facing south so i can put an herb garden here (motions towards the windows)... Killy (thoughts): What are islands made of? Wood? I guess i would have to somehow stick it to the floor, huh? I would have to change out the tile in the kitchen too. What kind of tile --- oh, i like that ceramic tile. How many sq ft is this kitchen? I wonder how much ceramic tile is per sq ft? How long would it take me to change out the tile? oh yeah, the island, would that have to be built? or could you just buy an island? I guess she would want drawers in the island to hold stuff. Jeez, this sounds like a lot of work, i wonder how long it would take me. Would i have to design the island, or can you just buy a pattern like those patterns you can buy at craft stores for clothes? I wonder if Wes would know how to build an island in a kitchen. Adolph's dad has an island in his kitchen. Was that there when they first bought their house? Did they build it? ------ What? Carol: This oven is so cool! It doesn't work? Oh man, i would get this oven fixed. It's so beautiful. Killy (thoughts): Who fixes ovens? How much would that be? Lessee, one island plus, changing the tile in the kitchen plus one fixed oven (so far) ---- huh? Carol: This part could be a dining room.... and on and on and on it goes ... for every single part of the house. The bedrooms are too small, so what's the answer? "...we can just knock out this wall!" Killy (thoughts): What does it take to knock out a wall? What if that part of the wall is holding up the ceiling? What about wiring? What about plumbing? Do any of my friends know how to do sheetrock? Ryan is in construction, but how often do i see him? Knocking down a wall seems pretty serious. Is it easy to do? I don't know how to knock down a wall. and then the bathroom: Carol: We can extend the bathroom in to this closet. Killy (increasingly frustrated thoughs): Knock down another wall? Jeez, why don't we just knock down the whole fucking house and start over? That showerhead is way too low. Who lived here before we did? Were they oriental or what? pigmies? Why is the tile in the back corner crumbling? I guess that'll have to be taken care of too? I see a dead roach. All of my thoughts are represented by a single grunt-like, "...eh..."

 We have found some houses in the 110k and 130k price range for 1500 square feet, three beds and one bath. These are in a very good area, not prime retail spot, but still within the Loop (and a hop skip and a jump from the museum area). If you move out into the subdivisions, you could find a 2000 square foot 4bed 2.5bath 2garage home for 130k. But then you have at least an hour commute in Houston's famed traffic. Houston's not too bad.

 Yesterday, Houston was awash in rain. The wind and the rain were so strong in the early part of the afternoon, that if you wanted to look out the 48th floor windows, you could actually see the building sway as you watched the traffic building up below. Also, if you were riding in the elevator during this time, the cars would screech and groan as they bumped their way up and down. If you were so inclined to be in the bathroom during a particularly strong wind, you could see the water moving in the toilets to and fro. Hmmmmm. Pretty scary stuff.

 Killy, how much do 3 bdrms in Houston go for these days? The cheapest digs avail up here start at $300K and that's for a crappy 2 bdrm condo with a shoebox front yard 2 hours outside of the city -- it's tough to find anything larger than a 1-bdrm anywhere in a 1-hour radius of the NYC metropolitan area -- Texas is looking better by the minute ...

 I never realized... how wholesome it felt to listen to a Beatles album. (Revolver)

 What a strange world we live in. I've been following the Haiti/Aristide thing through the lense of Pacifica Radio (KPFT) and last night caught some mainstream TV. In some ways, the situation in Haiti leads me to believe that NPR/BBC is remarkably limited in their world-view, neither's coverage seems very strong to me. The Charlie Rose show last night was excellent, mostly because Rose had someone who was actually from Haiti, partly because he had a broad range of viewpoints: a Republican congressperson (representing the administration), a former state department official (representing US government history), a professor from Columbia University (representing US opposition), and a radio journalist from Haiti (representing a knowledgable and intelligible Haitian). One of the conversational gyres was the Columbia prof saying that the current administration was undermining Aristide by withdrawing aid as soon as it came in office. The congressman affirmed this and stated that the US stopped monetary aid because Aristide was embezzling it; however, other forms of aid to Haitians, like food aid, have never stopped. Rose asks the Haitian journalist if this was the case, and she basically confirms it. The prof then went on about how the stopping of monetary aid was more than just that because it caused a financial payment crisis as the government couldn't pay debt without the cash aid. I missed the response to this, but the point seemed pedantic. Ultimately, if the point about Aristide's aid abuse was correct, then shutting it off would suck, but would be a more preferable method of affecting positive change than sending in the Marines guns-a-blazing. The Pacifica coverage of the evening took a pretty hard-line stance that the US is supporting the opposition and basically abducted Aristide. One of the more interesting points of coverage is that Aristide's bodyguard was an American company, paid for by the US State Department. I'm thinking, what the hell? If the US is anti-Haiti and anti-Aristinde, why would they spend money on his bodyguards and why would he accept that kind of aid? It doesn't seem to make any sense. In some ways I wonder if this is a sideshow for other things happening. Maybe it is a sideshow because it has been a pretty slow-news month. Maybe it is a less confusing alternative to attention paid to Venezuela, which is pretty confusing ( urlLink Caracas Chronicles ). Who are the bad guys? What is democracy? What is the purpose of government other than an alternative to anarchy? Oh, and is there anything about the story of US Special Forces coming in to get Aristide at the Presidential residence that reminds anyone of Ghost Recon scenarios?

 urlLink The train stand by my place is no longer new. the grooves in the anti-slip pavement are browned with dirt, the platform edge's fascia is stained in blooms of mold or perhaps where most people step on or off. The funk is collecting fast, litter is present in the cars now, although Houston evil-doers have not yet learned how to scritch-scratch their messages into the plexiglas. There seems to be a bit more up and down vibration at the car picks up speed; it makes me feel somewhat seasick; I wonder how true the rail-bed will stay in Houston's shifting soil. They can hardly keep the streets from buckling in the heat and random subsidence. The train's internal sign points the wrong way to the exit at McGowen; the announcer lady still makes Bell Street sound like Bill. Despite it being the first night of the rodeo, the train is largely empty northbound at nine. The trains are running doubled up in anticipation of the traffic.

 ???? The Passion Ends. You are left with two thoughts in your head. 1. Wow that movie was violent..!!!!! 2. What am I supposed to think about this movie. To expound on these thoughts. 1. Wow that Movie was violent...!!! Unbelievable. First if this movie was accurate Jesus would have been dead long before they ever crucified him. Second you are relieved when they do. Crucifixion seems like a holiday compared with the scourging. 2. What am I supposed to think about this movie. This follows the premise that you are supposed to actually think at all. Once the ultra-violence plays out you are pretty much left empty handed. There is nothing to mull over or think about. This isnt the Last Temptation. or a M. Night Shamalany movie. He is resurrected and the movie is over. That said the flip side is this. The more you know the more you be able to percieve. This is the movie adaptation of a book. Actually it is the movie adaptation of the last chapter of a book. No the second to last chapter of a book. If you knew nothing of jesus this movie would make absolutley no sense. No context. Like flipping through channels on T.V. stopping on H.B.O. to watch the second to last episode of Sex in the City. Then canceling your cable subscription then moving to an Amish community. Two months later a tourist comes along and asks you. "What do you think about Carrie Bradshaw?" Saw it at the Alamo Drafthouse. The chicken wings were awesome. The Pizza was okay. 20 minutes into the movie the guilt overcame me and I stopped eating.

 Why this picture is important I was driving away from my mother's house and realized i had forgotten my ipod in the house. I had left it sitting on the cradle with the itrip attached while it played music to my stereo in the house. As i backed out of the driveway i realized that the radio was playing the music from my ipod. I drove away until i just barely started to lose reception; at that point i stopped and snapped a picture of my distance from the house. You may have to work a little bit to make out my mother's house through the wet window.

 Oh My God, that is SOOOOO cute!

 You are giving me stomach knots just talking about it. JJJeeeeezzz!!!!!!!!!!

 A movie of the little doggie Just a urlLink little slideshow for those of you who haven't seen a lot of adolfo iv lately.

 The Search for a Home Two weeks ago, it officially started. We walked into our credit union and applied for pre-approval on a home loan. The next day we heard back, we were 'approved'. This, of course, means next to nothing. There is still a myriad of paperwork and higher ups at the bank that we have to cross before we are given any real money; this only provides us with a certain degree of legitimacy. The rate we were given was better (almost 2 points better!) than i was calculating, which only means we can afford that much more of a house than i was expecting. My stomach is in knots most of the time. I am having weird 'house shopping' dreams that leave me with a sense of dread, regret, and buyers remorse. I have gone over our budget time after time. I have been watching every penny that leaves our account. I have been fretting over paying bills promptly and fully. We have been 'out' three times, with three different agents. We settled on the last agent, Cookie, from Keller-Williams Realty. She is located there in the Garden Oaks/Oak Forest area and sells most of her homes in that area. All in total we have seen 8 homes. Two were vetoed from the curb; i didn't even have to go inside. Two we vetoed as soon as the door was opened.... **** This past friday I had a catharsis; carol and i both had to make the very real decision of where we really wanted to live. At the end of it, we chose the Oak Forest area. We had put sugarland into the mix out of frustration of not seeing what we wanted in a house right out of the gate. We wanted a bigger bedroom, larger bathrooms, bigger kitchens...in essence, space. The houses we had seen up front were WAY too small for us and it was very frustrating to hear "..that's the way the houses are in this area..." Immediately i was imagining scooting around my bed the way I was doing on Marconi St.; I was imagining the smell of old sewer pipes in my back yard...all the shit i've experienced living in old montrose apartments. I was frozen by a fear that i would end up with something like that. Carol talked me down, as she so often does. We are looking every weekend till we find 'the' place. I figure we'll be doing this for a few months, if not most of this year... we'll see. I'm trying not to think of it too much. I'm just going with the flow.... This is a photo of the backroom of an otherwise nice little house. What a fucked up addition! This was one of th houses that i had also put into my 'maybe' file, but after thinking about how much work would go into cleaning up that extra space in the back...i was more reluctant.

 Houston Been busy as a bee at the house since Thursday after closing. Carol spent the end of last week cleaning most of the house. She resurrected the fridge and made the oven look like new. She sanitzed both bathrooms and cleared all the residual garbage left behind by the sellers. Saturday was spent doing more cleaning, and prep work for painting. Adolph, Amber, Mike, Maru and Ezra came over to lend us a hand. We got so much done that day! The ceiling fans were cleaned, the dust bunnies were cleared out, the tops of the doors were wiped, tape was laid all across the floor boards and trim, the windows were wiped clear, the screens on the windows were cleaned, the cabinets in the kitchen were wiped down, the floor was swept, and the carpet was vacuumed! Once everyone was gone, i started stripping the wallpaper from the kitchen walls. I did that till about 11:30. I started again at about 8 the next morning. What a day! but that was only the beginning... Sunday, Adolph stopped by and helped me to finish up putting primer on the living room walls. Then, my stepdad stopped by with some housewarming gifts and a whirlwind job on some electricity issues i've been having. Right off the truck he pulled out a mitre saw and table and a fifteen-year old jigsaw (i remember him using it when i was growing up). Then, he presented me with a Craftsman drill and flashlight along with a 101 drill bit set. What a score! After his grand tour i started pointing out the problems i'd noticed with the electricity. He went to his truck and pulled out a new switch for the master bedrooma and replaced that in a matter of minutes. Then, he pulled out the pull chain mechanism in the third bedroom and instruced me on how to replace that. That evening we retired to Sugarland to prepare for this upcoming week. Monday: Solo. I dropped Carol at work and Adolfo iv at montessori, and went directly to the house. I finished putting primer in the living room and started sanding the kitchen walls to prep them for primer as well. Finished breakfast area and put a coat of primer on only a portion of the kitchen to see how many coats it was going to take to cover up the flaws in the wall.... I started priming the hallway and the bedroom. Put another coat of primer on in the kitchen after about an hour. Continued from the hallway to the bedroom. Lunch at the Galleria with Carol. Came back and put more primer in the kitchen. (About three coats....) and continued with the bedroom. Finished the bedroom and moved on to the half-bath...finished the bath.... Cleaned up and headed for adolfo iv. Picked up Carol and hit the freeway. Came home and had dinner..... Here's a pan of the backyard. urlLink

 I write from San Diego. I came out to see my brother play at his first solo show . I and many others had been encouraging him for years to get out and play his music , and finally last night he did. And it was wonderful. There was a good crowd, and despite some initial technical difficulties he and his back up band put on a good set. I was so darn proud! He calls his solo project Manuok ; You can check more info urlLink here . I also saw a couple of other good bands this weekend, including Goodbye Blue Monday and Waterline Drift . The highlight was definitately Goodbye Blue Monday. They build up so much energy that I thought the room would pop. Also, I have eaten a shit load of mexican food out here (California style mexican food being different than Tex-Mex), and I think that I have concluded that in general , California Mexican Food is better than Texas Mexican Food . Except for the breakfast tacos. So, all in all it has been a great weekend. I think the key has been spending inordinate amounts of time on the beach. Not bringing my computer along has helped a lot too. Also, I am reading an Evelyn Waugh novel ('Vile Bodies') that is quite laugh-making.

 Hyatt Regency Atlanta built 1967. A little Hotel History for yous guys. The Pritzger (of Pritzger and Pritzger the largest lawfirm in North America) family bought the Hyatt House, a hotel next to the Los Angeles Airpot (LAX) in the 40's. Thus began the "Hyatt" hotel brand. In the sixties Hyatt Corp. started building Atrium Hotels which the Hyatt Brand would become synonimous with. Those atrium hotels would be branded the Hyatt Regency's . The Hyatt Regency Atlanta was the FIRST one to be built in 1967. The fact that Mark and I shot this hotel, we have been told, means something pretty significant. It is THE single most important hotel in the Company, again so we were told. Who KNOWS? The whole hotel is pretty HO-hum. So what could be the big deal? right? Well the Director of sales put it like thus. D.O.S. "How long is the average home mortgage?" T "20 years?" D.O.S. "Maybe 30." T "oh?" D.O.S. "So if this hotel was built in 1967 and if it was a house, that would mean?" T "That would mean Hyatt Corp owns a whole city block of Downtown Atlanta." D.O.S. "Exactly plus the Corp History of the whole thing." urlLink urlLink urlLink

 Closing Such a fitting term for the end of this. I couldn't sleep last night. My stomach was turning thinking of every possible thing that could go wrong. I was petrified. I thought a lot about bug infestation. I thought, "what if this place is crawling with roaches?" Mind you, i looked for evidence of this during the inspection and found none. I thought a lot about rodents too, but of course, i never found evidence of this; no droppings in dark corners...etc. I thought a lot about the money: the mortgage combined wtih our mound of debt neatly wrapped up with montessori school tuition. How much paint does it take to paint a house? I mean, how many actual gallons will i have to buy? Dropcloths? Brushes?...etc...ugh.... I worried myself to sleep. I woke up at 5:55 a.m. I took a quick shower and chose just the right boxer shorts for our closing. We left the house right at seven o'clock and hit the HOV lane about 9 minutes later. We got Adolfo iv's school right before eight. We dropped him off with little more than a thrash as he was transferred from Carol's arms to Bernie's (his morning teacher). We picked up some breakfast and headed to First Educators Credit Union to pick up our cashier's check that we would eventually present to the Title Company to settle our closing costs. We arrived at closing right on time (9:30 a.m. sharp) and went straight back to a conference room and were instructed to sit on the right side. "Buyers to the right and sellers to the left, please, so i can keep it straight," said our title officer, Gary Stokes. We were in a first floor corner office in Greenway Plaza, with windows all around facing Richmond. There was a long, shiny table that was set diagnolly in the room topped with cookies (!?), a large bowl of miscellaneous candy (the big mixed bag kind you buy for Halloween), and pens at every chair. The British accented secretary asked us if we cared for drinks. We both asked for water. The chairs were so comfortable i hardly noticed them behind me. Once we sat down and water was set down we got straight to business. Signing, initialing, signing and dating, sign but don't date this page, can you initial at the bottom of this page... "Could you please sign with the 'third'?" "Well, i don't normally sign that way..." "Well, it's printed with a third on it, and it has to look exactly as it's printed." "um, allright, sure... (if it has to look exactly as it printed, then why are you asking for a signature? - can't i just look at the print and give you a 'thumbs-up?')" Everything in my experience was wholly unlike all the horror stories carol and i heard from co-workers. We weren't in there for four hours. Our hands didn't cramp up. The money didn't mysteriously NOT come through. The loan officer wasn't some slacker who waited till the last minute to process my loan. The real estate agent didn't over look this or that fax. The title officer didn't have a car accident on the way into work. If i filtered all the waiting for copies to be made and for the wire transfer to happen, for all the explanations and the few questions we had, i would say that we probably signed, initialed and dated for a grand total of 20 minutes. We walked (floated) out of there in 1 hour and 15 mins. We went directly to the house. Stanley Dessen, the previous owner, had just locked up the house and was leaving for his new home about 15 miles further north on 290. Once they turned the corner I carried Carol across the threshold for the second time. This is what we saw (minus the broom, mop, vacuum, and chair): There is a lot of work to be done, but we've got plenty of time to do it. Carol and I are happier than we've been in a long time.

 Pasargadae!

 From "Gardens of Persia," a book by Penelope Hobhouse listed on amazon.com: Buildings, water, and plants combine to give the gardens of Persia a beautiful spiritual quality that has served to inspire garden design across time and diverse cultures. Indeed, Ms. Hobhouse begins with the oldest living garden, Pasargadae, created by Cyrus the Great in 550 BC. It represented paradise on earth and spawned other gardens to be seen as settings for sacred contemplation and spiritual nourishment. In later centuries, these gardens evolved further around the world as representations for romance, power, prestige, and symbols of the afterlife.

 Gardens, etc

 Hey everyone -- check out my new website: www.plantladyland.com I'm enjoying the landscape design history class I'm taking right now -- it's all about how different cultures have interpreted their gardens ... it's amazing the extraordinary lengths middle eastern cultures would go to to create garden oases in the desert and how the garden of eden and the idea of paradise as a garden developed out of this barren landscape ... And then there's the perplexing and intriguing world of asian landscape design -- where gardens were created to entice and confuse the senses -- nothing is out in the open .. all the paths are winding and multi-tiered through grottos, by ponds, and up hills and into moon viewing pagodas -- where false endings seemed to signify a closure but really, should you look more closely, actually might lead to a whole new pathway. It's refreshing to see the way gardens have not always been simple cookie-cutter, sanitized versions of the American grass lawn and meatball hedges ... where differences were celebrated more and character was often prized over attempts at aesthetic perfection.

 Name Changes Inspired by Belin... *ahem* .. Claire's name change, i've instituted the following name changes for the group. These are effective immediately. Colin will now be known as Morton Paul will now be known as Vicente (pronounced, vee-sen-teh) Todd will now be known as Sam Adolph will now be known as Zippy Amber will now be known as Peaches (blong wig optional) Diana will now be known as Fontana Taggart will now be known as John Liz will now be known as Slugger Killy will now be known as Dirk Carol will now be known as Ambrosia I know it will be hard to remember at first, but i think we'll all get used to our new names pretty quickly. Enjoy

 Well, not quite. Tax season for the Tax Department at Hines is open all year as we work with extensions and annual reports as well as quarterly estimation payments and all sorts of stuff. Good thing is, I will always stay busy. Of course, never as busy as April 15th, which by the way, I learned was an extension for individuals as originally, tax deadline was the Ides of March. Although I never learned why it was originally March 15... In any case, first off, CONGRATULATIONS COLIN! Welcome to the corporate world... Is that what it is for you creative types?? I don't know, all I know is what is the best stapler to order for your cubicle (Swingline, mid price), which plants grow best under the various office lamp types, how to password protect your pc word docs and what neato office supplies you can make off with, in the darkest minutes of the most treacherous days... Amber, Thank you for your kind words, but we all know how difficult it is to be the object of affection for Killy as he is always calling me fat and big-butt. So, as far as being thin goes, convince my husband. ;-) Anyway, trudging away for my regular pay has kept me off the blog for a while, but I hope to be able to update more often when I (keeping my fingers crossed) have a little house. Later all!

 Congrats Colin! You know, benefits are over-rated, for the passably healthy at least. I still haven't made it around to making it to the dentist yet. Hi Amber, the guy next to Jett is Liosuke (my spelling is probably wildly off), Madeline's boyfriend. He just got accepted to film school at the Univerisity of Ohio and he and Madeline will be moving to Athens at some point soon. Also, not pictured is baby Adolfo and Chloe, Amber McCarthy's dog, and Asher, Ann's dog.

 I'll see what I can do. Killy you wrote "size 10? how about 11?" is one of your feet a different size then the other?

 Nike News So will you be working in the mailroom? sanitation department? the cafeteria? ...but seriously, congrats on the job colin. your newfound wealth won't tempt you guys into having another kid will it? maybe a boy this time? i wonder if nike's benefits would cover a home water birth? size 10? how about 11?

 Nike = Victory

 Cough Cough...wheeze.....alot of dust on this thing on my end. Haven't used this tool for communication in a while. Not sure if it still works, well, we'll see. Folks, after a grand life change, which so many of you were there to witness, my moving way out here and starting my family, I have scratched and scrounged for five years to make the ends meet for my crew. I have worked here and there, sometimes awash with enough and at others at the humbling back of the line at the unemployment dept. This whole time I have managed to never land a full time job with those mythical benefits and regular paycheck. I have gone, as stated before, from one industry to another trying to find a home that would take some of the pressure of providing off the forefront of my mind. I have become quite proficcient at being a freelance designer/illustrator, But as of today, I will no longer, for a time, have to seek out the source of my income. I finally got a full time job. I will start on the 3rd of next month. Yes it is at Nike, the bohemoth of sport ego corporate culture. For a time my family and I shall go to the doctor and dentist just for the hell of it. After not seeing the dentist since I left college I am afraid what he will say, something akin to, "Were you wanting to keep all thoses black rotting stumps, or should we discuss some plan of action." Blagh, blagh blah....................Basically I wanted to share with ya'll the excitement that the girls and are are feeling at this new turn of events. miss all of you piss piss poop pee shit bang fuck. love colin.

 Adolph, what a sweet family photo!! Carol is looking mighty thin and sexy, I must say -- it's so cool to see your dad and Talbot and Mad and Annabelle -- everyone looks great. And is that little Jet at the bottom? It must be -- he has Talbot's smile but he's such a big boy now!! Who is that with Jet, sitting just to his left?

 Trojan Horses Attacks Mac OS X

 Spider Man Can!

 The website is on the frizt over the past day or so. Normally about a thousand people come and donate, yesterday 125 people did. So this morning, while on hold, I think of a typo-truism, one os those things that are a typo but are truer to life than the intended letters: Notworking Administrator instead of Networking Administrator.

 The Last Couple of Weeks carol, adolfo iv, and i have been to austin twice in two weekends. The first was to see Paul for his 30th birthday. Onion Rings and chocolate shakes at Hut's. Mmmmmm. We were also supposed to get some family pictures taken, but the timing was all wrong. The next weekend, we went up for Meagan's Baby Shower. Luckily, she gave us her hotel room at the Holiday Inn Express saturday evening. Todd had dinner with us when we showed up at the Bennigan's next door. Then, we gave adolfo iv the some running around time before we piled in the car and headed to Barne's & Noble in the arboretum ... you only appreciate the accoustics in a place like that when you child throws two screaming fits. Todd kept setting off alarms in all the stores we would go into, because he kept an urlLink inventory control device in his wallet. (I assume he just thought they looked really cool) We got stopped by the girl in B&N and was forced to prove we didn't have any unpaid books. Once we dropped mom and boy off at the hotel we grabbed our things and headed to Mojo's for some (more) coffee and some 'peace'. It was nice to sit and chat with todd again.... Early Sunday Morning - We dash off to breakfast with Meagan and family at a 1st street mexican restaurant. Delicious huevos rancheros and coffee, and with meagan. it was great. carlene was so happy and adolfo iv behaved so well. Taggart showed up and i split with him to assist him on a shoot. We showed up at what urlLink used to be the showpalace . Taggart got a hand me down job from Mark: shooting strip club furniture! We spent an hour and a half setting up lights and moving stuff around. I met up with Paul and Todd at Flips and got a great Illustrator lesson from todd. We worked on the 'Cakery Bakery' logo for Rocio & Mikes start-up bakery in Lockport. I think we're making pretty good progress. Once i got back, i was immersed yet again in our potential home. The insurance company underwriters came back with their decision: i am insurable! so i had to get them in touch with my lender so they could fax the proper documents over. One step closer. The next things are: Get the utilities hooked up, or switched over to my name, rather; and choose a home warranty company i want to use. (The sellers are purchasing a home warranty plan for us for the first year. I spent 1 hour last night trolling Home Depot for the items i'll be needing for the first week of home ownership: paint, dropcloths, brushes, cleaners, rake, shovel, wet/dry vacuum....

 Aphasia This is a poem that I found in the April 2004 edition of the urlLink New Yorker . I think it is really lovely. I am overjoyed to have found it; It is precisely the kind of poem that I love to read, and long to write. Enjoy. APHASIA His signs flick off. His names of birds and his beautiful words- eleemosynary, fir, cinerarium, reckless - skip like pearls from a snapped necklace scattering over linoleum. His thinking won't venture out of his mouth. His grammar heads south. Pathetic his subjunctives; just as pathetic his mangling the emphatic enclitic he once was the master of. Still, all in all, he has his inner weather of pure meaning, though the wind is keening through his Alps and his clouds hang low and the forecast is "Rain mixed with snow, heavy at times." - urlLink Vijay Seshadri Aphasia - total or partial loss of the ability to use or understand language; usually caused by stroke, brain disease, or injury. Enclitic - An enclitic is a clitic that is phonologically joined at the end of a preceding word to form a single unit.

 I noticed today that the cameras mounted above the traffic lights have a little antenna behind them. I noticed this while at Deitrick's on Westheimer, looking out at the westbound Westheimer traffic light at Hazard. It's fascinating. I wonder what you could do with that? I assume the units are cameras because they are mounted in a cylindrical housing with an integrated sunshade on a pipe well above the traffic signals but aimed down at the lanes of traffic faced by the below signals. Given the antenna, I would assume that the data is wireless and the cable going into it is power. Now what are they for? At first, I was dismayed to see them going in as I have read about traffic cameras being used for correspondence traffic ticketing. However, I haven't heard a peep about that in Houston despite a mojor deployment going on. Where is the traffic camera money coming from and for what are they being used? If they are being used to study traffic, then why aren't the lights better timed? urlLink Houston TranStar - The Greater Houston Transportation and Emergency Management Center

 I had this idea at lunch today and think it might apply to grade-school or older art-education: Software that converts a picture into a coloring book line-art drawing. Does something like this exist already? It would work like rotoscoping, except that instead of color areas, the software would make an outline. The concept would be to allow students to explore the color regions of objects (like a still life) in front of them without being excessively concerned about their ability to accurately depict shape. urlLink Don Markstein's Toonopedia Glossary: Rotoscope

 Thanks Todd... for migrating The Blog to urlLink chairjockey ! I now demand that you update the template with one of your swell designs!

 I can't download the pictures but last night my mother, my sister and i went on a power shopping spree at the going out of business sale at my local dollar store I'd been meaning to go there since last week when the big banner draped over the store's name (1.00 mart) displayed that everything inside was marked down to .79! but last night was thee night as I met up with my husband at the Kroger parking lot, we noticed the sale had been escalated everything was now marked down to .59! so I took Killy home, left him with the baby and put my mother and maru (who has stopped by for a visit) into the car for a late night shopping blitz my mother proudly walked out with 14.00 worth of wares

 that's right y'all. she did it AGAIN! one more year, one more perfect GPA. damn, my baby rocks. and, unless any has serious objections, i am going to migrate this blog to chairjockey.com.

 Paper Lantern Wow! i just can't say enough about this new app, and how it makes my life easier. i mean,wow. by the way let's put the blog on chairjockey.com!

 This morning the urlLink Nonprofit Online News linked to a urlLink Press release on Global Support for Information Society Targets . An overwhelming majority of people answer yes to "Should Cyberspace be declared a resource to be shared by all?" Who would have guessed? I wonder if this means that we're going to start trying to import cheap "Cyberspace" from Canada or Mexico once the "Digital Divide" multiplies?

 well, rumblings have been heard about the ever-present ad banner at the top of this page. 'What can we do about it?' said the many, 'How long must this scourge vex us?' they said, plaintively.

 Legos By the Pound! My boss ordered 25 pounds of Legos off of E-Bay for 100 bucks. It just got delivered in a big-ass box. He got it for his son. What a great gift idea!!!

 I remember once upon a time in VMSNotes asserting that the stock market was a ponzi scheme and the various replies that people had. I don't feel any different now, other than realizing that it is a moderately regulated Ponzi scheme that agregates capital in various utilitarian arrangements. It was interesting to read this on urlLink The Mark Cuban Weblog - www.blogmaverick.com : Mr Gabelli disagreed. He responded with the omnipresent retort to all things stocks, Warren Buffet buys stocks. Yes. Mr. Gabelli, you are right. At that time he did. But he doesnt buy 100 or 1k shares at a time as you have suggested the typical investor should consider doing, or should trust you to do for him or her. Mr Buffet buys enough shares to have influence and in many cases control. Can the average investor do that? Can the typical fund do that?

 urlLink Critical Section - Human Robotics Were doomed to work hard, just like trees are doomed to grow tall. So the trick is to make work enjoyable.

 Chalabi Raid Yikes! I am getting cynical; My first thought after reading about the urlLink U.S raid on Iraqi Governing Council member Ahmad Chalabi's offices was that it might have been permitted, maybe even staged, to give Chalabi more 'street cred' as the June 30th date for the transfer of power nears. Chalabi's utility has been limited given that he is reported to be widely distrusted by Iraqi's who see him as too chummy with the U.S Administration, not to mention the fact that he spent the last 40 years in exile...

 Amber asked me what was wrong with her computer today and inclosed a screenshot, of which the above was part. Top Ten Reasons Why: 10. Stop parking your hot coffee or tea cup on top of your computer! You can put a glass of ice-water there though. 9. A sack of ice from the grocery store is a good 99 cent solution. 8. I think that your computer cannot handle your skill at minesweeper. Stick to smaller maps! 7. It is obviously that background. Only the Microsoft XP (tm) Rolling Hills with Clouds (tm) should be used. 6. Time for a new computer. That one is screaming "I want to be Margie's computer!" 5. First step in troubleshooting: Is your computer plugged in? 4. Second step in troubleshooting: Please erase your hard drive and reload your operating system. 3. This is just your computer saying, "Captain, I'm giving her all she's got!" 2. That isn't a toaster oven tray that pops out the front of your computer... 1. It's a "non-critical threshold." This is just your computer telling you to not worry and be happy! It'll let you know when it is critical.

 Paper Lantern Version 1.2 NOW WITH UNDO! Download your copy of urlLink Paper Lantern (523 KB) today! Paper LanternVersion 1.2 fixes the horrible "Why can't I update my blogger blog post anymore?" problem that Killy urlLink reported . Also, I added much need Undo functionality!!! The problem had something to do with Blogger's recent revampification. I have also learned that they are probably urlLink moving to SOAP , so I wonder when it is that I will have to clean up Paperlantern so that it works with this new interface.... Paper Lantern is 100% pure Cocoa, written in Objective-C. It sports a urlLink SQLite database (Objective-C wrapper provided by urlLink blackholemedia.com ) and uses Apple's urlLink WebServicesCore framework to handle the XML-RPC calls.

 Action Script 2.0! Looks like ActionScript has gotten a major urlLink overhaul .

 urlLink Here's the iTunes link for the Apple junkies...

 To see the biggest size you have to use iTunes 4.5? My static "iTunes is an MP3 player" mind thinks, "What kind of BS is it that the movie trailer plays through iTunes?"

Real Network style click the tiny link at the bottom left of three pages to download the free version? urlLink The Incredibles

 I guess I'm not really looking for a BBEdit replacement, but urlLink SubEthaEdit would certainly be a candidate (if I didn't use grep so much). [ Update: ] Looks like I spoke too soon. On their urlLink features page , they list grep as a new feature! [ Update: ] You use spaces for tabs but when you hit delete, you delete out the "tab" instead of space by space!

 Staining the Night away Friday night, among other things, i stained my son's new dinner table. He seems to have graduated from the high chair, even though he still eats from it. But he's got the coordination to sit in his own little chair. The last few times we've told him it's time to eat, he's run to the living room and pulled up his little blue yard chair rather than clamour for me to unlock his high chair for him. Both carol and i decided it was time for an upgrade. We went to IKEA looking for a suitable little table and found one; urlLink nude with two chairs (for when he has dinner guests) . I went to Home Depot and got some deep cherry stain and some polyeurethane (sp????) to varnish it with. Try to imagine this with a nice deep shiny wood color. It'll end up looking nicer than his parents dinner table! Aside from this little project, i managed to paint a couple of walls in the living room, get my car from my mother's house (which, incidentally, drove just fine; although, i'm still very interested in fixing before i get it back on the road with any regularity), get a haircut for both my son and i, got my shopping done, did another pass for fleas over the carpet with the vacuum, gave a decent sweeping to the garage, put some curtains in the living room, and most importantly, RESTED.

 Amber and I are trying really hard to put sheets on my new bed. "Are these queen," she asks. "Sure," I say, "They're a little faded but they are clean..." As it turned out, I used to have a full-size bed, not a queen, and the sheets do not fit.... urlLink galleryfurniture.com

 I stopped using Expose because pushing F9 is always a hunt and peck. This afternoon I noticed the "hold shift down" and tried it out with right mouse click: Pretty Nice! [ Update: ] This doesn't work by control-clicking. Holding down control and clicking the mouse button (in single clicker mice like the Powerbook's built in trackpad and clicker) doesn't equate to a right click, so the above trick doesn't work on a Powerbook by &lt;Shift&gt; &lt;ctrl&gt; clicking.

 Among other things, I learned how to make urlLink Sushi last night. I had always had it in my head that somehow Sushi was difficult and complicated to make. But it is, in fact, relatively easy- requiring only basic burrito making skills . So now I know how to make one of my favorite foods! Next step: Add bacon.

 Paperlantern Version 2? Paul : Have you come up with a fix for our inability to update our posts using Paperlantern?

 For work related reasons i am unable to see the templates (blogger is blocked???) so I am inclined to go with todd's template advice. but really, i don't care what you guys choose. It actually reminds me of a church marquee sign i pass on my morning bus commute to work: Jog on in. God don't care what you wear. The church gets a lot of jogger traffic since it's right off of heights blvd with a long jogging track down its center island. And speaking of communting, I walked out of my house at 6:06 this morning, missed the bus and waited half an hour for the next one. Didn't get into work until exactly 8 a.m. I have sworn off busses. I have no idea how i'm going to get to work tomorrow. I took a vacation from vacuuming for fleas last night and fiddled around with a wireless router i got from work. After a frustrating 15 mins i decided this was too much for killy and called adolph over with a promise of dinner and ice cream. He showed up much quicker than i had expected. After we ate, he tinkered with the router for an hour or so before declaring it dead. Too bad too; although, if i'm at home sitting on the desk why wouldn't i just tether myself to the modem via ethernet? Of course, what about the imac, which will not be in the 'office', but in our room or the living room? I guess i could just hook the cable up to the imac and use it as the base station... (hmmm....didn't john p. say he had an old spare base station?) Tonight: 1. Pick up car from mom's place as a potential way to work? 2. Put away all the paint in the garage. 3. Unbox and prepare adolfo's new mini-dinner table 4. Fix ceiling fan in the living room

 taggart, i respect and honor your opinion. however, since i disagree, i will now launch a blistering attack on issues that have nothing to do with this topic. why do you hate america so much? is freedom so abhorrent to you? are you now or have you ever been a member of the communist party? let's put it to the people; who else thinks taggart is a damn commie?

 Sorry Todd, I like urlLink this one.

 anyone up for a new urlLink template? i kinda like urlLink this one i, for one, am just tickled pink with all the CSS goodness the 'new blogger' presents. however, though it feels like i ought to have a lot to say, having been -ahem- peeved all day, i find myself with dumb fingers and a head full of no words.

 Friends on the periphery urlLink Here's a college fluff piece on the College of the Mainland's video production class featuring our friend, Eric Zapata.

 My urlLink motorphobia has only worsened, and I detest what high automobile ownership rates have done to urlLink development patterns in our cities, so I greatly feared that setting up shop here in the West would mean the end of my wonderful ' no-car ' lifestyle. But the gods have smiled upon me and It looks like I will be living but a short bike ride from the office. This means, of course, that I must acquire a bicycle. To that end I have shopped around a bit, but to be honest I am quite overwhelmed by the variety of models, components, configurations, brands and bike-bells. Since my short term need is merely a get-around-Austin bike, but my long term goal is to ride in something like the urlLink MS150 and to be able to make month-long bike tours of Scandinavian countries, does anyone with bike-riding or bike-purchasing experience have any sort of recommendations as to models and brands, etc?

 My best recommendation to get rid of fleas is to borrow someone's dog for about two weeks. Put K9 advantix on his neck and BLAMO!. In about two weeks every flea, tick, and mosquito in your house will be dead.

 UFO'S??? Here's an interesting quote from a urlLink Mexican UFO investigator: "This is historic news," Maussan told reporters. "Hundreds of videos (of UFOs) exist, but none had the backing of the armed forces of any country. ... urlLink The armed forces don't perpetuate frauds." HA! Well not until they're caught, huh?

 Metro Rail Rain, vacuum patterns, and my in-laws I could hardly belive that it was raining as hard as it was when i left work today. Luckily i left a little earlier than usual so i could make it over to the metro office in the medical center and purchase a cash value card. By the way, buy this card once and it seemingly allows you unlimited rides on the rail without ever having to justify its monetary value. I had always wondered about this, especially after i saw several people flash them to the metro cops checking tickets recently. "So, i can use this to ride the rail?" "yes." "do i have to insert it in the machine for a ticket?" "no" "so all i have to do is flash it to the metro cop if they happen to check it?" "yep" so conceivably you could carry around an empty cash value card and ride the lite rail all day with nothing to worry about, unless of course, they start carrying around little card swipers. I made it to the train just before it and a torrent of rain swept over the entire medical center. It was crazy. It was like driving through a laser wash. A stiff wind came along with it and blowing sheets of rain along the left side (*ding!* - a la izquierda) of the train. Oh, and if you've even wondered about those little green circle lights on the door as you exit, they REALLY DO OPEN THE DOORS. "If you need to get off, please press the green button to open the doors. I'm not going to open all the doors so all of you get wet." The 'exiters' (4 people total) didn't really get the point. They all got up and each one pressed the button on one of the four doors. All four doors opened and in came the rain, like a swarm of bees. The next group all dutifully assembled around one door and left. The door quickly shut behind them. The rain was coming down too hard to get out at my stop, so i figured i would take the train to the end of the line and hit it on the way back, giving the rain some time to pass over downtown. I always imagined that at the end of the line, the train made a large circle and came back around. I was disappointed - very disappointed - that the driver merely stopped and moved from what was now the back of the train to the front. What a let down. but my gamble paid off; the rain was just a sprinkle when i got off at main street square. I got home to a home full of dead fleas! yes! Of course, i know that this really isn't the case, and that urlLink there is still plenty to do in my fight against this enemy. I vacuumed the entire carpeted portion of my house - every corner and crack and crevice to pick up as many of the dead little carcasses, pupae and larva as i could. This will go on until i can get the back yard treated, which won't be until the rain ends: sometime next week. My favorite thing about vacuuming is the vacuum pattern. I wish i had taken a photo. Tomorrow look for this. The in-laws are leaving for chicago tomorrow, so they were dropped off by mike and maru so carol can take them to the airport tomorrow afternoon. I was just finishing up the vacuuming as they arrived. Dropping off turned into a full evening visit with dinner, margaritas, and a ritual blessing of our home by carol's parents. (FLASHBACK: they also married us kneeling at their bedside when we told them we were living together.) Once the blessing was done, which involved a series of prayers in spanish recited in each and every room of the house (including the garage, but excluding the shed outside); carol's father blessing the house with the baby's left over holy water from his baptism with a lettuce leaf; and the burning of our wedding candle; i was able to finish up something i had been meaning to do since this weekend. I put up curtains in our bedroom. With this, the night concluded (for me, at least) and i retired to my office, lay on the floor absent of fleas and wrote out a monster post.

 I want God, I want poetry, I want danger, I want freedom, I want goodness, I want sin. -Aldous Huxley This is the opening quote in the new book I'm reading, "Fierce Invalids Home From Hot Climates," by Tom Robbins -- I love Tom Robbins -- his words are so luscious and rich, like chocolate cake he makes me squirm and salivate with anticipation as I seek the mental fulfillment and inspiration that only a handful of writers inspire ... for me, it's Tom Robbins, Salman Rushdie, and Gabriel Garcia Marquez ... all the others are as dull as dirt in comparison. More from Tom's new book: Butterflies were delicate and gossamer, but this moth possessed strength and weight. Its heavy wings were powdered like the face of an old actress. Butterflies were presumed to be carefree, moths were slaves to a fiery obsession. Butterflies seemed innocuous, moths somehow ... erotic. The dust of a moth was a sexual dust. I love it, I love it, I love it!! So, anyway ... everyone, pick up a copy of the new Esquire if you can -- Anthony's got 7 illustrations in their special travel destinations section -- should be very cool ... And, a photographer from the New York Post was at our apartment yesterday photographing the garden -- they're doing an article on New York container gardens so they interviewed me and took a couple hundred photos ... they said to look for it in either this Saturday's real estate section or the following Saturday, but you know how unpredictable these things can be ...

 On my way to Figure Drawing class last night I began wondering just when I would see an artist bust out a urlLink PowerBook and a urlLink Wacom Drawing Pad . Well that very night about halfway through the session this designer guy does exactly that - he busts out his laptop and drawing pad, fires up some kind of photoshop/paint program and pulls off some kick-ass renderings from the 10-15 minute poses. What the technology enables is amazing- you lay down some finely tuned sem-tranparent layers with out having to mix up anything special. And you can do all of this without having to wait for anything to dry! It was pretty amazing. Speaking of amazing, the model last night had this figure and pose that were straight out of an urlLink Ingres painting.

 John is Graduating & Killy has fleas I got an email invite to his commencement last night. For those of you in the san marcos area, he'll be walking at 7p.m. this friday, may 14th. He got a degree in speech communications. (What kind of job does that land you?) I spent last night vacuuming for fleas and getting things moved from off the carpet. I scheduled a spraying today, hopefully this will clear up this unfortunate infestation. For those of you who might be now or in the future infested with fleas, vacuuming seems to be the best remedy for clearing up larve and eggs that are left behind. One female can lay between 400-500 eggs. They are normally laid on a host, but because they don't 'stick' they just fall off into the carpet and/or bedding areas. Vacuuming is the best bed, according to online reading. Next best thing is steam cleaning the carpet. This, apparently, will kill larve and eggs, but i'm kinda doubtful cause i 'steamed' the carpets about two weeks ago. (I must get that machine back to annabel.) There are plenty of other more extensive ways to treat, such as slamming boric acid into your carpet -- time consuming and toxic -- but i don't want that stuff around the boy. for some reason Adolfo iv decided to wake up at 4:45 this morning. Carol, of course, throws a fit even though she went to bed as early as he did: around 9. I eventually made it to the bed around midnight. Even though i was up as early as i've ever been, had breakfast and a cup of coffee, I still managed to miss the bus. The next one arrives in about 5 to ten minutes and takes the HOV lane to get downtown. Work is as slow as can be right now. I've got a couple of posters in the queue and my weekly conferences, but both of these have become as intuitive as peeing in your sleep. At one point last night, adolph and i set up our camera's for some video chatting. How fun, adolfo really got a kick out of seeing adolph full screen on the computer. He was all giggles.

 One of the things that I have long thought is counter-intuitive is the Iraqi occupation using former regime structures, like the palaces for the administrators and Abu Ghraib for a prison. It smacks of bone-headed parsimony: "well, we got these great buildings that are secure and we may as well use them..." It is a clich? to say that the occupation leadership is lack-luster, but the use of former regime structures is abysmal choice. It seems to come more from lack of vision of alternatives rather than malice, but it is not inspiring to hear that those same palaces will become the US embassy when the occupation is over. The AM radio personality Limbaugh is pretty off about the nature of crimes in Abu Graib. It is more akin to that movie with the banjos than the popular conception of collegiate hazing. For one, the perpetrators are country folk from West Virginia (i.e. not typical fraternity undergraduates); and two they came from an army reserve military police unit with members whose regular jobs were at prisons. From urlLink this week's New Yorker article : Bobeck explained: What I got is that SSG Frederick and CPL Graner were road M.P.s and were put in charge because they were civilian prison guards and had knowledge of how things were supposed to be run. Bobeck also testified that witnesses had said that Frederick, on one occasion, ?had punched a detainee in the chest so hard that the detainee almost went into cardiac arrest.? The most awful truth of this thing will likely be that in Iraq we are seeing exposed to the world what incarcerated Americans face every day. Broom-handle in the butt? urlLink Abner Louima would say that it is nothing new in the USA. On the other hand, the other clich? of a vast right-wing conspiracy is in high dudgeon. The hyped outrage should come as no surprise, but what amazes me is that the reports are urlLink nothing new , but for some reason the Abu Ghraib pictures changed things. I thought the KPFT commentators didn't pay attention to corporate media like 60 Minutes? Let's give a big Al-Hurrah for the corporate media acting as stenographers for the military's investigation of itself!

 You can almost see Bin Laden twisting his pinkie finger into the corner of his mouth.... urlLink Indiana Printing & Publishing Co. : "With gold selling Thursday on London exchanges for $387.60 a troy ounce, 10,000 grams of gold was valued at $124,630, 1,000 grams at $12,463, and 500 grams at $6,231."

 Home of the Cardboard Box and General Disarray I think the pink eye is less of an issue than the incredible disarray of our home right now. He is, afterall, only contagious the first twenty-four hours, which ended about 1/2 an hour ago. I'm glad this day is coming to an end.

 Man, I would really like to be in "Ready for Game On, working on project" mode right now!

 Hey urlLink Paul , Election day as a holiday would be difficult to pull off in the US. For one, any year can have any number of elections. For another, it would be difficult to geographically arbitrate holidays for things like municipal elections. For example, Houston has a vote coming up concerning city worker pensions. As a simplification, one could stipulate that the election day holiday would only be for the November elections. However, as a practical matter, this would work against democracy: since the election with the holiday would appear to take precedence (no pun intended), all other elections throughout the year would lose mind-share, meaning they would become more controlled by small but dedicated portions of the population.

 Hey urlLink Todd, Diana, If you aren't craving early morning eyelid crusties, you are always welcome at my place. Thanks to the miracle of the vacuum cleaner, it is cleaner, now more than ever.

 I love monitoring this stuff: urlLink DHL - Tracking Summary Package tracking would make a great reality TV show. There would be a lot of tension as the cameras follow 7 obsessive package trackers. Some would obsessively call the company they made an order with and repeatedly ask for a tracking number, even when the package has not shipped yet. Some would not have their work address on file with their credit card company, delaying shipment. Some would forget to ship it to the office and get the dreaded missed you slip on their front door, necessitating a duck-time race to the UPS office in some industrial part of town. No show would be complete without people who ordered expensive new models of Apple computers which in some cases are shipped overnight from Taiwan. When the first 802.11g computers came out, they were held up in Customs in Anchorage, Alaska--a real nail biter! Of course, in the age of near-ubiquitous and inexpensive overnight shipping, package tracking is nearly moot, as the package is in your hands almost faster than you can get the tracking number. Package Tracking Reality TV: you heard about it here first!

 "'This is an opportunity for the president to speak directly to the people in Arab nations and let them know that the images that we all have seen are shameless and unacceptable,' McClellan said." On the radio this morning, even the BBC was repeating the phrase "shameless and unacceptable." I wonder if this is going to be repeated enough to become a common phrase like, "now more than ever." I think maybe this is something straight from the presidential mouth because it has an oddly torqued linguistic logic: how can images be "shameless and unacceptable?" The pictures themselves simply exist; they depict actions that are unacceptable; but if the images are shameless and unacceptable, then you are denouncing the pictures, not the actions.

 thanks to all for the congrats on the proposal. as far as rug monkeys go, i doubt we will wait five years; diana has a schedule to keep. i am posting from kingman, az. on the handy holiday inn express computer available for guest use. it is in a poorly ventilated glass cubicle, and i feel like the 'geek' exhibit in natural history musuem. we are making good progress, having driven from urlLink portland to stockton, ca. on day one, and making it to urlLink kingman on day two. 600 miles a day. i would make a crappy trucker. tomorrow we make amarillo, or wichita falls, and are shooting to be in houston on thursday evening. killy : can we stay with you guys? if so, where the hell do you live? i hope the kiddo is doing better, or was doing fine the whole time and the montessori nurse was misshapen. more posts as computers are available.

 Pink Eye An unexpected call from the montessori school today: adolfo has pink eye. The last time we heard this, it wasn't pink eye at all, but a respitory infection that had mucus draining from his eyes as well as his nose. Luckily, we still have the pink eye drops we rushed out and got, but hopefully this is just another 'mis-diagnosis' from the school. It would be nice to NOT have to take another day off of work.

 05.03.04 Knowing that i would snooze the alarm over and over again till i was late, i left it on the floor next to bathroom door rather than placing it on my bedside table. It rang dutifully at 5 a.m. I showered, shaved and ironed my pants for the day. I packed up my computer and was out the door at exactly 6:06 a.m. to catch the Metro 50 off 43rd and Costa Rica. The neighborhood was of course, quiet. There was no breeze, but it was unseasonably cool; the sky was dark blue. I could hear an occasional bird off in the distance, but it was otherwise silent. I As i turned the corner onto Georgi, i could see the first couple of students being dropped off at Scarborough High School. A round hispanic girl kissed her mother goodbye and stepped out of a late model chevy cavalier enveloped by this mornings darkness. The car pulled away from the edge of the black iron gates that surround the school with a sharp u-turn, swinging it's headlights across the street in front of me. One minute, and 40 seconds. I made my way down Costa Rica in a little over four minutes and sat on the cement bench and waiting for the bus. This was, in essence, a crap shoot. A couple of weeks before i had bought the house, i had looked on metro's website for the 50 route. Apparently, there are three different 50's: one hits the HOV lane, one takes all the little backroads and one is a special school route (or some variation of the two previous routes.) The time 6:15 a.m. was stuck in my head. So i waited only 2 minutes for the bus. It arrived at 6:13. I was downtown at exactly 7:00 -- just as the train was pulling away from the station. I sat at the station and waited for the next train to arrive. downtown was quiet and wet. There were yellow vested city workers spraying down the bird shit off the sidewalks and the train stops. The train pulled into the station with a surprisingly large load of passengers at approximately 7:12 (right on time). I arrived at the medical center at 7:26 and walked into MDACC at 7:30.

 I picked up the Amlie soundtrack today. I heard it at Dietrick's on Montrose, asked the guy what it was and next went to Soundwaves to pick it up. It is really nice; I think it will be a much better selection than 8-1/2 Souvenirs for when I feel like having a bit of Francophone accordion music.

 I saw Fahrenheit 9/11 last night, like a lot of folks. I watched it at the River Oaks cinema; Wes said that he saw it last night at the Edward's Cinema; yesterday Dad said they were going to see it in Shreveport because the good liberal folk of Shreveport banded together and petitioned the distributor in Dallas to screen a copy in that oft-forgotten market. I didn't go expecting much, as I was dismayed by Bowling for Columbine. However, a day later I am still thinking of Fahrenheit 9/11 and am still favorably impressed. It still is a Michael Moore film; it still is infused with gotcha rather than thoughtfulness. However, it seems a remarkably more mature work. While it does not fully address the topics it looks toward, it serves as a new lens in which to view recent history.

 Art League Houston Website Eric was talking to me about getting someone to 're-do' the ART League website for low price, and i mentioned that i could get a whole crew of guys to work on it pro-bono. He accepted giving us free ceative reign. Basically, they just want a re-design of the site. Same info, just a different presentation. Something cleaner. No change to the logo or anything like that. Just a makeover, really. Please check out the website for a peek at their current situation. Please submit all design & site map ideas before the end of work on Friday, June 25th by posting them to the blog, or they can be brought with you to the Housewarming Party that same weekend (Sunday, June 27th, 2004). Todd? You interested?

 One of the hot topics now a days is government power to track people and detain them and suspend the normal rules and so forth. The thing is that the rules aren't there to protect people from government, they are also there to keep government running smoothly. In the latest twist of the prisoner abuse story, top Washington administrators keep prisoners "off the books," and apparently then forget that the prisoners exist! urlLink The New York Times > Washington > Prison Abuse: Rumsfeld Issued an Order to Hide Detainee in Iraq : "WASHINGTON, June 16 - Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, acting at the request of George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence, ordered military officials in Iraq last November to hold a man suspected of being a senior Iraqi terrorist at a high-level detention center there but not list him on the prison's rolls, senior Pentagon and intelligence officials said Wednesday. . . . Seven months later, however, the detainee - a reputed senior officer of Ansar al-Islam, a group the United States has linked to Al Qaeda and blames for some attacks in Iraq - is still languishing at the prison but has only been questioned once while in detention, in what government officials acknowledged was an extraordinary lapse. 'Once he was placed in military custody, people lost track of him,' a senior intelligence official conceded Wednesday night. 'The normal review processes that would keep track of him didn't.'" The Times' informant speculates that this has something to do with not letting the Red Cross see the prisoner, but this doesn't make sense if they aren't "interviewing" him, eh?

 "Genuine Imitation Leather" Nope, folks, it just doesn't get much better than that. Who came up with that phrase? Some super oily, brazen salesperson, I'd reckon. Damn, I love hazelnut-flavored nondairy creamer! Not to mention just about every baked good must have trace amounts of aluminum in it from that description.. Now that you mention it though, there is one area where I still have weird memory lapses -- computer messaging. I regularly get a feeling of deja vu when sending an e-mail or posting a blog -- wait, haven't I already said that before? Did I send an e-mail just like this already? Maybe it's the lack of context -- no scenery to associate with a past dialogue, no verbal response, just these sort of ephemeral words out in space ... or, maybe, I'm just an aluminum-head, after all ...

 The rumor picture of the new Powermac G5 that came out before the recent speed-bump shows a shorter motherboard with ram in a vertical orientation.

 urlLink The Straight Dope: Does exposure to aluminum cause Alzheimer's disease? : The question is whether chronic exposure to small amounts can affect you. Despite lots of research, we still don't know. . . Even more insidious, aluminum is added to many municipal water supplies to help remove floating debris. Aluminum is also found in household baking powder, self-rising flour, cake mix, pancake batter, and frozen dough (as sodium aluminum phosphate, a leavening agent); in nondairy creamers, table salt, and other powdered foods (as an anticaking ingredient); in processed cheese (as an emulsifier); and in hemorrhoid preparations (up to 50 percent aluminum hydroxide).

 Body Odor, Fried Chicken, Music I don't use deodorant, haven't for years. I use an exotic blend of baby powders instead. While I have not noticed any increased lack of an early onset of Alzheimer's, I have noticed that people invade my personal space a lot less. Also, last night I had some of the tastiest fried chicken I have ever had in my entire life. It featured some kind of honey fried truffleification. I would like to thank Taggart and the chicken from whence the fried chicken came for this meal. After the amazing fried chicken I saw my lil brother play at Emo's. He is currently on tour with urlLink Ilya , an excellent band from San Diego. Also, I have moved into an apartment. I now have an address. The floors and walls are bare. There is no electricity because I forget to get it turned on. The water pressure is firehoseusable. That is all. Oh, and this from D3:

 Adolph, Did you know that studies have shown that aluminum-based deodorants are linked with early onset of alzheimer's? Not that you have alzheimers, but hear me out ... just about every commercially available brand of deodorant has aluminum in it -- now we all know not to eat food that's been cooked in aluminum pots for this very reason -- but what about deodorant? Since becoming prego, I've also discovered that I get a skin rash from using aluminum-based deodorants -- weird, that never happened before -- but now, my body is more sensitive to the bad stuff, I guess ... Another interesting side effect of pregnancy? I don't get B.O. except when I exercise pretty strenuously -- so I don't have to wear deodorant anymore -- maybe once every few weeks and that's it ... So what about for you non-pregnant types? They make these deodorant stones -- you can find them at any organic/granola/health store outlet --and they don't contain any aluminum -- pretty cool, huh? I suggest keeping the strong stuff for those times when you're really pumping out the 'ol sweat, but use the organic stuff the rest of the time ... I actually have noticed a difference in my memory -- I have a much better attention span, remember things more easily, feel sharper all around -- so who knows, maybe it is the deo ..

 I've recently (last year or so) been struck by how small a space in between the sky and dirt we live in. It can seem vast, with a plane perspective; but when you look up and down there is so much more that you can't even touch by just walking around. This is a picture of Amber on the T-pier on Cross Lake taken when we went to Shreveport a couple of weekends ago.

 . . . morning I go through the same drill. I'm writing emails to various people in the office and I can't think of their names. What is worse is that I can't even look at a list of names and find the person. I look at a list and get lost; I start wondering, "for what was it that I was looking?" Maybe everyone gets like this; maybe I have some sort of "learning disability." Another example of this is one late summer not remembering which color was blue and which was green. It was before classes started, probably second or third grade, and I was cramming newly bought school supplies in a backpack or something. I guess that if I had walked outside I could have remembered, "Oh, the sky is blue and grass is green," but for the moment lived in the abstract world of crayons, pencils and notebooks I couldn't think of it.

 tourin', fishin', hangin', eatin' and cleanin' I spent my urlLink official day of mourning with my little sister and Claire. We rode into town and parked in adolph's vacant spot at his apartment and rode the train downtown. We checked out the majestic metro where Wes and Claire will be married on 10th of July. Then, as we headed back to the train station we peeked at the press machines at the urlLink Houston Chronicle. Then, we cut across to back to Main St. through the urlLink Chase Bank building. We made it to urlLink Rice University right on time for the campus tour. My sister was amazed. Claire and I hung back and chatted while Barbara was swept along the tour. We had a nice lunch at urlLink Niko's Niko's and headed back home for a long afternoon nap. Too long, it turns out... I forgot to pick up Carol at work and the baby from school! I ran out the door at 5:15 got the baby and rushed to get carol. If i wasn't so dumb, carol would have been angry. Saturday morning we hop in the car and head to my step-dad's house on the San Bernard River. We fished a good portion of the late morning and early afternoon away and finished off the afternoon making some BBQ chicken. We were back home 7, gave the baby a bath and went to Wes and Claire's house for another cookout: hot dogs, salad, watermelon, beer, elote, and guacamole! On the guest list were two kid-ed couples: the Chavez Family and the Craig, Tea, & Evan family (can't remember their last name). It turned out that Craig really enjoyed playing chess, so we planned a Sunday morning game at the local Panera. He called around 9:30 this morning and picked me up about 15 minutes later. At high noon we had played two games. One win for killy and a draw. Once home, Carol and i got ready for Adolfo's first non-family related birthday party! We got to Gymboree, had cake and ice cream, played a few games, and left. It was very matter of fact. It almost wasn't fun at all (for me). Adolfo IV crashed the second we got home. Hard. We took advantage of the time and cleaned. Hard. The house was a indescribable mess. Hard. And now we must go grocery shopping - hard.

 Lotsa Free time on my hands ?? so much to do. Work is nearly dead as summer arrives. Lotsa vacations and few conferences. Requests for posters and meeting av support grinds to a halt and the hallways are quiet. I'm spending my time mulling over the urlLink InDesign Total Training CD's , and teaching myself the basics of a 3d application, urlLink Cheetah 3D in hopes of getting some illustration assignments from the docs here at work. Here's a small sample: I rendered it in Cheetah 3D and colored the resulting tiff in photoshop with three different colored selections with the blend mode set to 'color'. I also happen to have picked up a chess bug after my game with Paul over the Memorial Day weekend (i wish someone would have taken a picture) that i can't seem to get over. I've been looking closely at the Sicilian and it's variations. I'm still not very good, howerver; I lose whenever i play. It's extremely frustrating. There are lots of things to do at the house, still. Still, the living room needs more paint; the kitchen needs paint on the walls, there are door stops that need to be installed; screens that have to be put up; plants to be repotted; and boxes to put in the attic. The front yard is slowly but surely starting to come back especially with the recent rains we've been having (and continue having all week!) There are some nearly bare spots that i've been watering for the last couple of weeks in hopes that the grass will reach out and choke out the weeds that have taken root there. The back yard is also making progress on the bare left by the dog of the previous owners. Both Sr. Mercado and I cultivated the ground to make it a little more hospitalbe to regrowth. I've noticed the trail leading to the shed is taking on more grass. One of the tomato plants in the vegetable bed is looking pretty bad off. I'm hoping it'll be able to recover with all the rain it's getting. The rose vines out back need some serious pruning, as does the tree out in my front yard. I've been putting it off till i can manage to get adolph over to catch me if i fall off the roof. Adolfo IV started tumbling classes last week and has taken particular joy in practicing on my bed (or any soft spot he can find). Last night, we rolled around on the bedroom floor and bounced on the bed. He's also become a big fan of Finding Nemo and a certain teletubbies dvd carol picked up at Toys R Us. Here is a small list of words he uses frequently and accurately: cookie, Nemo, mama, daddy, poopoo, teetee, cheepees (peaches), papa (food), shoes, down, moon, aloe, bye-bye, juice, car, toys, nurse, keys, book, ball, finished, no, cereal, dark, hot, chips.... and a myriad of sounds that he uses to get his point across. He also points at things a lot. If i've missed any, i'm sure carol will post those to the comments section for those of you who are interested in charting his linguistic progress.

 Garrison Keiler says that there were no significant birthdays today to report on writer's almanac. However, Apple gave birth to a set of speed-bumped urlLink Power Mac G5's . Interestingly, the dual 2.5's won't come until July and have liquid cooling, different from the rest of the line. The dual 2.5 product number skips a number from the sequentially numbered 1.8 and 2.0 models and when I added it to an order at the Apple store, it had a product number of Z0AC. In reality, they dropped the mid-range and made the low-end model a faster dual processor, along with dropping the price for both by $500. You can tell that the new dual 1.8 is mother-board similar to the old single 1.6 because it only supports up to 4 gig ram and has standard PCI slots instead of PCI-X.

 WELL TO CLEAR UP THE VICIOUS RUMORS THAT MR. MERCADO IS SPREADING, IT IS NOT YET MY BIRTHDAY. MY BIRTHDAY IS ON THE 9TH OF JULY. BUT I AM FLATTERED THAT HE REMEMBERED I WAS A SUMMER CELEBRATOR. IT WILL BE MY 16TH BIRTHDAY AND I AM VERY EXCITED ABOUT GETTING MY LICENSE. I HAVE BEEN SAVING MY PAPER ROUTE MONEY AND AM HOPING TO PURCHASE A USED KIA. TODD, TELL DIANA CONGRATS FOR US. EVERYONE, LAURA IS LEARNING TO PLAY THE MANDOLIN. SO NEXT TIME YOU SEE US WE WILL BE OUR VERY OWN BLUE GRASS BAND.

 Other people may not have this problem, but sometimes I am working on something and I forget where it is in the file system. For example, I was working on a Fireworks document that I exported to html and images in the same directory, but I forgot where exactly that was and it takes some navigating to find. So, I tried command clicking on the title in the titlebar and presto, the directory heirarchy menu appeared! When I clicked on the directory above (visually below) the file I was working on, the Finder opened up that directory in a new finder window. Perfect! There is more: If you do the same thing in Safari, you get links to each website directory above the current web-page. There is a slight bug in this though. When I tried it with the Blogger posting tool, it gave directory up links for the URL in the querystring (the part to the right of the question mark) before the document that resides on blogger.com.

 Big Three-Oh ? Is it the big Three-Oh for Mr. Flynn? If so, happy birthday my good man. If not, then when is it? Also I have not yet moved into my new apartment. The property manager lady was sposed to call me last week with a move-in date, but she did not. And I have meant to telephone her today, but I lost the number with my wallet, and I can't find it on the internet, so ... Also urlLink Airport Express looks pretty neat, eh?

 Has gout Isn't it hereditary?? I heard but don't know as I haven't made time to look that up. What I have made time for though, is to look up affordable housing for my parents here in Houston. That's right, my brothers and sisters are looking into getting my parents to move back to the states where we can help them out more easily and where we can be sure they are doing OK. With that in mind, anyone interested in making an investment of $45,000.00 for a three year old brand new house in the beautiful and quaint village of Santiago Maravatillo? This would be a great place for summer vacations, a relaxing, industry free, vestal environment where fresh tortillas and one type of cheese (queso fresco) are available on a dialy basis. Maybe a summer getaway??? Maybe a place to teach summer classes. Maybe a sort of timeshare where we can all buy a part in and share it amongst ourselves. Maybe a nice photo lab... Home base for the weary traveler...

 Horrible! As I walked away from the ATM machine (after withdrawing 150 dollars destined for R.Kane) I remember thinking to myself "Would it not be horrible if I lost my wallet today?" Well, that is exactly what happened. Somehow between the Smoothie place and my office (about 100 steps and an elevator ride) I lost my wallet. Either it fell out on its own, or it had 'assistance'. At any rate I am now driver's license-less, credit-card less, check-card-less, and 150 dollars-less (actually 300 dollars-less seeing as the money was destined for R.Kane). Sigh.

 MAYBE YOU COULD PROPOSE TO NICODERM: YOU ARE A SMOKER WHO SORELY NEEDS TO QUIT BECAUSE OF FLAT TIRE LUNG DISORDER. YOU NEED SURGUREY SO THE DOC'S CAN USE FIX-A-FLAT ON YO PO AZZ. BUT IF YOU PROMISE TO USE NICODERM PATCHES INSTEAD OF STITCHES ON THE SEW-UP-TODD PHASE. AND THEY IN TURN PAY FOR THE FUN PROCEDURE. THEY GET ALL THE RIGHTS TO YOUR STORY. EVERYONES HAPPY AND YOU QUIT SMOKING, WITH THE HELP OF NICODERM. CORPORATE AMERICA OUT.

 although, a super hero whose power is to collapse their own lung would hardly strike fear in the hearts of evildoers. Thanks to all for the outpouring of sympathy and good advice. the good news is that my lung is inflating nicely, and NO CHEST TUBES ARE REQUIRED! and that is good news. the downside is that there is absolutely nothing to prevent this from happening again; your prayers notwithstanding. by that i don't mean nothing CAN be done, just that nothing HAS BEEN done. if i so choose i can pay a medical professional to : cut me open (with tiny little cuts) deflate my lung stick a long skinny tool into my chest staple up all those nasty little blebs horribly abrade my lung and chest wall fill my lung back up sew me back up and finally, pump me full of drugs for the next few days. that is way up there on my list of things to do once i get health insurance. right after my breast augmentation. and i have been smoke free all day.

I just read urlLink your post and want to call to see if you are ok, but it is past 11:30 in the pm so I expect that you are asleep.

 so there i am, sitting at my desk, working away at restoring as much email as i can after my entourage database went south. just minding my own, not hurtin' nobody, when i become aware of a small twinge in my back. 'that's odd' i think, 'maybe i am just sitting funny' and the pain grows. and grows... long story short : i take myself to the hospital (again) get shot up, poked and prodded (again) x-rayed (again) and sure enough; my damnhellfuckingcrappieceofgodamnedshitassbastard lung has gone down. again. luckily for me it is just 'a little collapsed' and i can go home once i find a ride. morphine and motor vehicles do not mix. finlly get a hold of boss paul, go home and sleep 'til now. the morphine has pretty much worn off and i am hurting again On the bright side, i found urlLink this site for people like me.

 Carol, I say you make killy clean the house. Hey Paul, that grnaddaddy album, is that the guy from the flamming lips? If not he sounds exactly like him.

 escapes me tonight - it will be time to cuddle with my Adolfo Fidel as soon as we get home I will take time to be with him in his room full of toys and give him time to show me how all of them work then i must sneak some time to make dinner for my husband and somehow squeeze in the time to feed Adolfo Fidel at the same time when it will suddenly be time to give Adolfo Fidel a bath a time when he shows off for mommy spitting out the bath tub letters across the water like flying fish this is the time i can relaxe i let him take his time in the water and let the tub fill slowly so after a time i can drain and refill it one more time then it's time to brush our teeth Adolfo Fidel hates this time but we do it, dutifully, and quickly because now it's time to go to sleep and i haven't had time to clean but i have a wonderful husband who will give me some time to breathe

GROW TYHE CHILDREN AND CONTINUE IN AN UNBROKEN SPECTRUM THAT WHICH CAME BEFORE. SOMETHING TO WHICH NONE OF US CLAIM AS OUR OWN PERSONAL DREAM CREATION. I WORK FOR THIS BECAUSE I WISH TO MAKE MY LIFE INTO LIFE AS I LEARNED IT. THIS IS NOT A world of my parents youth, where you wear as a badge of honor A MILITARY RECORD. I HEAR OF THOSE THAT GO TO THE FRONTS IN THE NAME OF VALOR AND RIGHTEOUS HONOR AND I CRINGE. IN MY BELIEF THEY GO TO MEET DEATH, TO FULLFILL A QUOTA OF BLOOD REQUIRED BY GREED. I MIGHT BE WRONG. I MIGHT BE SHORT SIGHTED AND SEE THROUGH THE EYES OF A PAMPERED AMERICAN CHILD WITH THE LUXURY OF BRACES AND SOCCER PRACTICE WITH A LEARNED COACH. WE DO NOT KNOW THE TRUE NAME OF SUFFERING, MYSELF AND I. AND WITH MY SHORT SIGHTEDNESS I SPEAK OUT AGAINST ALL AGGRESSION AS A SIN AGAINST THE MOST BASIC OF UNITING FACTORS. THAT OF HUMANITY.

 this is mostly for carol, but others may be interested as well. a really good way to avoid gout flare-ups is to drink more water. when flare-ups occur use ibuprofen based products, not tylenol or regular aspirin. tylenol has no anti-inflammatory properties, and aspirin can actually make the flare-up worse. however, if aspirin is being taken daily, for heart related stuff, it should not be discontinued. this information provided free of charge by diana brewer.

 Memorial Day Weekend urlLink I hope everyone had a nice Memorial Day weekend. I sure did. Of course, I spent 85 percent of my waking hours eating, or getting ready to eat. It was great to see Killy and Carol and the family of Killy and Carol and their nice little house with the blue door and big oak tree. It was also neat to witness the crack and boom of a fierce hail-storm. Literally out of the blue it came and banged up all sorts of car hoods. It was great fun.

Adolph , you definitely should spend some time looking in to it. It could be just the rapid web development framework you are looking for. I mean, one can literally create html forms to insert, update and edit records in a database without writing more than 5 lines of code.

 This morning on urlLink Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me , the NPR news quiz, the listener was asked who said this week ". . . I was born in the west wing of the hospital . . . ." When Kerry was in the wind-up to this statement I remember thinking, "okay, this is harkening back to Dean and the democratic wing of the democratic party, so it must have been the left wing of the hospital." And I was wrong, it was the west wing. However, this morning I realize that I was right, the west is to the left, from a traditional map perspective. urlLink Google Search: west wing of the hospital kerry

 urlLink United States Secret Service: Employment Opportunities - Uniformed Officer One of the interesting points of Fahrenheit 911 was that the Secret Service was guarding the Saudi Arabian embassy. However, from the Secret Service's website, it appears that they do a lot of that and also provide protection for foreign heads of state/government too. I wonder how many embassies are guarded by the Secret Service?

 I saw this link on urlLink Engadget and even though I can't read it, it has some pics that demonstrate why the iPod is still on top: urlLink ?? ?????????? . The site has side by side pictures of the new Creative MP3 player with a current and 1st (or 2nd) generation iPod. Yesterday I had two different office-chit-chat conversations with people about the iPod and it is remarkable how capable it is. You'd think that some clever people out there would have come up with something better, but the unbadness of the music management software, the magic of the scroll-wheel, and the relative open-ness of the device itself are a winning combination. It will be interesting to see how Apple manages the current DRM (digital rights management) challenge by Real. It is kind of a pity that Apple feels a need to respond at all, since it doesn't seem like Real has an actual shipping product. And whenever Real does ship something, you can be certain it will be some nightmarish advertising engine that makes iTunes look really good.

 I'm overhearing a conversation elsewhere in my office about a wreck and a lawsuit and wanting to sue the lawyer who filed the lawsuit and the answer that lawyers don't sue one another. Over this election season, we're all likely to hear a lot about lawyers, as the Dem VP candidate is one and as its one of the things increasing health care costs. I'm wondering, how often are lawyers sued for malpractice? Do lawyers buy malpractice insurance? When was the last time a lawyer was sued for sleeping during a murder trial or operating a class action lawsuit that benefits themselves more than the claimants?

 urlLink Don't Blog For Me, Argentina: corporate whore : "If you can give them a story that they can give to the next guy, and that guy can give to the next guy and so forth down the line, that is infinitly more importnat than what the graphics look like." . . . I once read an article about Nike and how the company was all about the transmission of corporate stories. urlLink This article was from back in 2000 and I'm certain a lot has changed since then. However, the basics still apply: strong organizations typically have a distinct culture or set of shared values and the parable is the best way to get those across to other people. Jesus had it down pat. If I remember it correctly, he didn't typically say, "do this." More often he told a story and people discovered why they wanted to "do this."

 So Tuesday, my office-mate Ethan says to me that he wants to make something like a conservative NPR. Ethan is a self-avowed conservative--Killy, remember that guy at First USA that was studying economics? Ethan is kind of like that. I'm not sure what he means by conservative. So I say, "Isn't that kind of an oxymoron?" and he acknowledges it but says that he likes the format and information but not the liberal spin. So we bat ideas back and forth for a bit until I have this idea: Blog Reading for the Blind . The basic concept is that a modest number of people (say, 30) commit to reading 5 minutes of blog posts into their computers every few days and each day's recordings are put into one mp3 of about an hour that would be downloaded through Bittorrent (a distributed downloading system that would take some of the bandwidth burden off the central server). I imagine it would be something like urlLink Houston Taping for the Blind , a service that is directed toward the blind but is freely available to all. I was first exposed to Taping for the Blind through urlLink KTRU , where sometimes I catch the Houston Chronicle being read. To demonstrate how easy it would be to record, I pulled out the trusty urlLink Belkin Voice Recorder and read a few minutes of an urlLink article and imported it into iTunes within seconds and played it back. It worked pretty well. To learn more about hot Houston Taping for the Blind works, I applied to be a volunteer there.

 So, we got back Saturday and I'm feeling this obligation to blog the stuff I wrote about while I was there and also write the stuff I thought about but didn't get around to writing down and so forth, but it just isn't going to happen, so I'll let the urlLink pictures speak for themselves . It was a great trip. My verdict on Belize is that it was a really nice time and the accommodations were very inexpensive but the overall value didn't seem better than Mexico. This may have been different if we had spent more time in the interior looking at Mayan ruins, although that would have really meant going to Guatemala. For folks without a comfort level in Spanish, Belize may offer a better value proposition (ignoring travel costs), but since I love honing my pigeon espagnol, that doesn't apply to me. Our choice of Belize came out of wanting to use as much of our travel vouchers as possible. Round-trip for each of us was about $450, which was under the $500 travel vouchers we both had. We budgeted about $100 a day and ate pretty well but did not take any guided excursions and didn't buy a lot of junk to bring back. One of the big hassles is that Belize doesn't have the ATM network that Mexico has. In Guanajuato, you can just walk down to the ATM any time and pull out pesos. In Belize, you have to bring a stash of traveler's checks--the bank (and there was only one) only offered cash advances on credit cards and charged a fee to do it. Fortunately, most places seem to be cool with traveler's checks.

 I love the pictures of Belize... I'm dying to get out of Texas for a week or two. Those shots were pretty inspirational-I need to get Tag and I passports for Christmas. Then we'll have to get out of the country. Maybe Belize, Costa Rica, Argentina, Equador, Italia! I love to dream, as long as it's about travelling and not syringes coming out of my head. Liz

 I haven't remembered my dreams in a long time. And with all these wierd clinical schedules, I've been sleeping wierd hours. Like until 10:00am. I haven't done that since SWT! So anyways, I have a 5 week rotation on the oncology floor, and it's all cancer patients getting chemo, recovering from chemo, trying not to die. Just about all of them have central lines, like Jet, with a port under the skin on the chest and a tube going strait to the heart. Well, one pt. had a central line, an IV in his left arm and one in his right arm. You walk into the room and there are tubes everywhere. One for pain meds, one for antibiotics, one for blood, one for antivirals, one for fluids, and one of IV nutrition. This is who I dreamt about last night. But I must have been him. Talk about empathizing with your patients. It starts out with a surgeon saying he needed practice, so he grabbed me and intubated me. Then he started pushing on my temples. Then I looked in the mirror and saw syringes coming out of my head. Needless to say, I'm creeped out and this can be categorized as a nightmare. I will spare y'all the rest of the details. I otherwise love this rotation and want to do oncology forever-wierd dreams or not. I love wearing pajamas to work. Liz-on Taggart's desktop

Well...every Mon - Wed - Fri at 11:45--I grab my shorts, shirt, sock, shin guards, cleats, and ride my bike over to the soccer field and play. All year round.

 it was unlike any dream i have ever had before. like most of my dreams it was in two separate, but somehow related parts. in the first part i was some type of space marine on a jungly planet (type place). i entered the dream in the height of the action, which was a breakneck retreat from some manner of advancing enemy-alien-lizard thing. while i was terribly curious of what exactly i was running from (and shooting at) the wisest course of action seemed to continue to run (and shoot). the next part was even stranger. my family, at least my aunt and brother, had gone to vietnam for a vacation. nothing out of the ordinary there. except that i was a vietnam vet. i visited places where i had previously fought and kept having grainy, black and white flahsbacks, all quick cut and jerky. they became increasingly protracted until i came to a building where, in the past, my unit had apparently taken heavy fire. in the 'now' of the dream a bunch of teenagers were having a party. well, i freaked out, knocked some kid down as he got out of his car, stole the car, and drove the hell away. later i met my aunt and brother for a meal, where my aunt accidentaly spilled another diner's milk.

 As I was perusing Adoph's Itunes Library I saw that most of his albums that he ripped himself were encoded as MP3's. A bit surprised I asked why...."Compatability" was the answer. I have come across this On-line music store for Independant artists. urlLink Audiolunchbox . I realize that this might not have the integration and ease of Itunes but being a Mac user I have been bummed that I cannot shop online for my music elseware. However Audio lunchbox is Mac friendly and it's product is sold as MP3s, and Ogg Vorbis, and you get get both file types without paying extra. I am sure Adolph will be sad that he cannot buy the latest Britney, Jessica, Mandy, J-LO, album there but he can find American Analog set, Death Cab for Cutie, and They might be Giants there.

 "'Bona fide' terrorism is a matter of semantics," said Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Murphy From urlLink Omaha World Herald

 An Occurance at Bexar Fields in Houston (Wednesday July 14, 2004) The sky is black and then bright blue, and then black again. I'm only closing my eyes because i can hardly believe what is happening. My leg crawls like a snake; the impossibility of that squeezes my eyes shut. Cumulus clouds, bright blue and sunset orange -- i don't feel pain, but i can't walk. A painful spasm shoots suddenly through my legs. My calf continues to tighten; i turn towards the earth. The grass is nice here, much thinner than the St. Augustine in my yard; i can smell the moisture in the ground, or it could be the sweat that has gathered on my face. We've been playing now for nearly two hours. Once i am up again it might be closer to three hours, but i'm not counting. I am face to face with the grass, but i roll again on my back. I can't stand up. I reach down and try to massage my calf which continues to spasm - i can't bend my leg. I can't reach it. I rest my hand on my kness but it feels like someone else is touching it. My leg doesn't feel like my own. They begin to gather. The long muscle that i call my calf feels now like a ball just below my knee - did i pop a ligament? is this what this is? did i break my leg? i reach for my calf again, i need to feel it. I bend my leg with considerable pain but manage to get a hand on my calf. It feels like it's swirling under my skin - some storm or wind swirling about. I immediately think of Eric's boa. It's silky body moved under my fingers the same way my leg is now. I pulled my hand away. "... my calf..." was all i could manage. Alex, who i was battling for the ball, grabbed my foot, straightened my leg and pushed it forward. As the muscle relaxed, it oozed a slow hot pain. I cringed and looked at the sky (it's much darker now - how long have i been here?) I limped off the field. "Pickle juice, do you have some at home? Drink it." "Pickle juice?" "Yeah, that will help." I swallowed down the gallon of water i brought with me. I poured the last of it on my head. With my injury, the scrimmage was called. We were all reminded that the next practice was saturday monring, 9:30.

 for a new martha stewart style domestic diva. amber has the right mix of approachability, and genial uptightness to fill the power vacuum left by the deposed doyenne of domesticity. now we just need to get her to embroider her name on some sheet sets or pillowcases and a megamillion dollar empire will be born. Seriously amber, thank you very much for your insight and helpful hints. i have been wondering about how to get good soil for my guys, and about better feeding techniques, not wanted to create a generation of sugar junkies.

 My specialty is container gardens, since that's what most everyone's got here in the city. Here's what I do for organic, healthy, gorgeously blooming and growing plants. I start by creating a rich soil that feeds plants for years and years (and, yes, even container plants should have living, vibrant soil, rather than salty gray dead soil that starts to look like chalk or hard, dried out clumps of peat moss over time): Every spring, about 1 month before the last freeze (in March for most places), I enrich the soil in all my containers (and I recommend my clients with yards do the same). Here's how: 1) I remove the top 1-2 inches of soil -- where salts build up -- and throw it out so I can add the good stuff (for yards, you wouldn't need to do this step) 2) I add some composted pine bark mulch (for acidity and aeration) and some composted manure (for nutrients -- make sure it's COMPOSTED manure -- plain manure is too strong and can burn plants) to the tops of my containers, tilling it in a little to replace the soil I took out. Compost is the best cure for bad soil -- clay soil, sandy soil, compacted soil, etc. 3) Then I till in a mixture of greensand (for trace minerals), crushed up egg shells (for calcium), and some Epsom salts (for magnesium) 4) After the plants are all planted in the containers and after the last freeze, in late April here - probably early April there, I add a slow-release fertilizer (like Osmocote) to the soil surface. That last about 3 months, so I apply it again at the beginning of July. 5) In May (late April there), all blooming plants and vegetables need frequent fertilization if you want them to keep producing, so I start fertilizing these heavy feeders with an organic fertilizer (you could use a liquid seaweed and fish emulsion mix, or shop around for a water-soluble organic fertilizer, or get that Jerry Baker book and use a home remedy mixture), every 2 weeks. For all other plants (foliage plants, houseplants, non-blooming plants), they should only be fertilized about once a month. 6) Stop fertilizing everything by August/September to allow plants to slow down growth in time for winter -- even houseplants go through a winter dormant period where they stop growing as much People always ask me why plants in containers need fertilizing. They need it even more than plants in the ground because every time you water, some of the nutrients are leached out of the drainage holes at the bottom of the container. If this sounds like too much work, I recommend just trying to do steps 1 and 4 at least -- you can try doing the other stuff later if you find yourself wanting more blooms, bigger tomato yields, healthier plants, etc. You can find all of these products at a good nursery -- but, if you're lazy like me you can also order them on amazon. Hey, if any of you ever have a question about your plants, post a photo on here and I can probably help to diagnose any ailments you have ... just call me the plant lady ...

 Sunday morning thoughts I thought urlLink this was pretty interesting. Jihad as enlightenment? I immediately see a stronger comparison in the Crusades; however, wasn't there a certain degree of 'spreading the word' involved in the crusades that isn't present in any current jihad?

 Y'all can start calling me Uncle Pablo for now on. Thats right, my sister Susan has announced that she is expecting a bouncing baby gender as yet undetermined!!! The whole family is so super excited, especially my mother who has been praying for years for a grandchild- and now mere weeks after her retirement, her prayers are answered!

 not really, but i must say that amber's post has caused me concern. Also, to anyone new to gardening: Never, ever buy Miracle Gro or any of those other mysterious little blue powder fertilizers. Why? They have high salt content (which damages plants in high concentrations) and they don't feed the soil. Result? In a few years, your soil will be totally dead and devoid of life, including all the necessary earthworms, soil microbes, and beneficial organisms that make soil healthy, alive, and nutritious. Your plants will be fast food junkies hopelessly hooked on blue powders for sustenance because the soil provides no nutrition to them anymore. does that go for container plants also? should i encourage earthworms to take up residence in my larger containers? i must confess to having purchased a bottle of said tonic and have applied it sparingly to my plants. i don't want junkie plants! i want them to choose life!

 EACH TIME I READ YOUR RAMBLINGS, I AM NOT FILLED WITH ANYTHING OTHER THEN THE COMPLETE FEELING OF BEING WITH YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONNECTION. SOUR TOE ASS NECK.

 If you never buy another gardening book again, at least buy this one. If you have a yard, IT'S A MUST!!! Here it is: Jerry Baker's Backyard Problem Solver: 2,364 Simple Solutions for Super Soil, Great Grass, Amazing Annuals, Perfect Perennials, Vibrant Vegetables, Terrific Trees, Bad Bugs, and Wicked Weeds He's got all these kooky home remedies for things, and they really do work. You may wonder why a little soap would be good for a plant?? Phosphates for blooms and root development. Beer???! Sugars for metabolic growth and development. And all kinds of other wacky solutions that will save you money and save us all from dying mysterious deaths from cancer caused by toxic chemicals leaching into the ecosystem in 50 years. I do disagree with him on a couple of things: Bleach -- don't use it!!! I'm also unsure about using ammonia -- sounds toxic for the environment to me. But I absolutely agree on most things, including egg shells for calcium, coffee grinds for acidity, and BIG BEAUTIFUL HELPINGS OF RICH, BLACK COMPOST FOR EVERY SOIL IN SPRING AND FALL Also, to anyone new to gardening: Never, ever buy Miracle Gro or any of those other mysterious little blue powder fertilizers. Why? They have high salt content (which damages plants in high concentrations) and they don't feed the soil. Result?

Okay, that's all the soap box preaching for today .. buy that book!!

 The Way Home The bus has its own sounds. The creaks and hums and hisses of shifting metal, rubber and bodies are unique to that space ?? that seemingly stagnant time. I am swallowed up the second i step onto the rubber floor (the beeping as the bus drops to allow the old mexican lady behind me easy entrace follows the rhythm of the hydrolic hisses); the engine resonates, the traffic outside becomes nothing more than a hum. I always sit up front in the seats that should be vacated for wheelchairs; wheelchair riders are rare, but i have seen them. Mostly on Montrose, but i remember one downtown not too long ago. He was an older gentleman, remarkably self-reliant for a guy in a wheelchair. He strapped himself in. The bus driver only had to raise the seat. He left the bus as effortlessly as i might have in front of some assisted living apartments off of Memorial Dr. A soft bell rings. I never see anyone pull the insulated cord. My eyes are closed. The sweat slowly evaporates off my body. the bus begins to slow down. I shift my body weight forward to keep from being flung off my seat. The bus comes for a jerky stop. From behind my eyelids i can see shadows moving across the bright blood in my eyes. Three people get off. This particular bus idles hard. My legs are shaking shoftly. I am almost asleep. The bus jerks forward again.. The blood in my eyes is too bright. Summer has arrived. The air condition blows like a long sigh. If i were to open my eyes i would notice the sweaty foreheads and the wet matted hair. The sweat under my shirt has become a cold, itchy layer of salt. The 50 Heights route snakes through downtown and eventually hobbles up memorial and swings around to washington ave. Today, we stop at nearly every stop, even the obscure stop next to the bread surplus store. It is 6:05 when i step off the rubber floors of the bus and onto the hot concrete outside. I start to sweat almost immediately. I cross the street staring into the hot reflections of the sun on the windshields of oncoming traffic and think of the brown pelicans that dive bomb into the sheen of hot concrete. I hear that this happens in Arizona. The further i walk from 43rd, the more muffled the traffic becomes, until it's just a hum behind the sharp shrill of cicadas. I can feel my sweat dripping in between the hairs on my chest. I walk on the east side of the Costa Rica to avoid the sun. A giant live oak hangs over nearly the entire street right after Libbey. As i walk under it I catch a glimpse of a cicada on one of its low branches. I walk home in as much shade as i can manage to place myself under. I walk in straight lines from one patch of shade to another. the majority of my yard is shaded, so i decide as i walk up that now is the perfect time for me to cut the grass. I kiss my wife and son, change into shorts and head straight to the shed. The inside of the shed has the wonderful odor of yard work: mud, old cut grass, gasoline, fertilizer, mulch, ant poison, old wood. I walk the mower through the backyard and am struck by how remarkably quiet it is in my neighborhood. Lovely.

 Stepping off the subway today, I notice a homeless person's grocery cart parked on the platform. The owner is nowhere to be seen, but the cart bears the trademark anonymous lumps, probably clothes and bedding, hidden inside an assortment of plastic garbage bags. But the thing that really catches my eye is what lies on top: A book of sushi recipes. And so I have to wonder what other necessary implements must also lie within the bags: Sashimi knife, bamboo mat, sake. The question that comes to mind is, if you were a homeless gourmet living sans oven or stove-top, wouldn't sushi be the logical choice? I hear fishing in the East River isn't bad this time of year. (Thanks Taggart and Adolph for the great feedback on high-speed service ...)

Check out Hell Boy and any of Mike Mignola's stuff. that one is easy to find cause of the movie and all. All of Frank Millers stuff is great. Sometimes the story is a bit thin but the art is great. especially RONIN and his BATMAN and DAREDEVIL also ELECTRA ASSASIN. But best of all is... JIMMY CORIGAN - smartest kid on the planet. Forgot the artists name but this guy is so powerfully great his ability to organize a narrative it unbelievable. He also has the whole ACME NOVELTY LIBRARY. good luck.

 Hey Amber Frida, check this out: urlLink APOD: 2004 May 28 - A Manhattan Sunset : "Today, if it is clear, Manhattan will flood dramatically with sunlight just as the Sun sets precisely on the centerline of every street. Usually, the tall buildings that line the gridded streets of New York City's tallest borough will hide the setting Sun. This effect makes Manhattan a type of modern Stonehenge, although only aligned to about 30 degrees east of north."

 Speaking of "excessively trying to monetize the engagement," this Sunday I had the misfortune to shop at Randall's. I wanted to go to Spec's, but they were closed, so I went down to the mid-town Randall's. The little grocery store in San Marcos was a Randall's when I worked there and the chain seems to have gotten sicker. It was as if everything in the place had two prices, the with card price and the higher regular price. I asked a worker outside the meat department for where the pimiento cheese was and the lady walked me to it, offering me jumbo shrimp at such and so a pound, and after hearing me decline, ran through about five more items with prices. It was insane. I felt like saying, "hey, what you are doing is annoying." Instead I said, "hmmm, that tilapia sure is low." (Referring to something directly as low or high when the intention is to refer to the price of something is a strange pet peeve of mine.) After enduring Randall's, I got to the checkout and couldn't buy the champagne for mimosas. Can't buy alcohol before noon. Why doesn't the ACLU do something about that?

 I've really enjoyed my cable modem thus far. It has been a reliable and fast connection with no tech glitches. I picked it because there is no contract (my apartment is month to month too), no "activation fee" and somewhat cheaper. In theory, a cable modem could provide slower service than DSL. The line to a cable modem connects to a larger trunk before it goes back to the cable office. Thus, if all of your neighbors are heavy internet users, then you could see a slowdown. In reality, there is a lot of bandwidth and the cable companies cap their download and upload rates so that there is enough for everyone. The technical advantage of DSL is that the line in your home goes straight to the telephone company office (a big building with lots of connections and computers sometimes called a "switch"). Nothing between you and the phone company depends on anyone else. However, the electrical requirements of DSL mean that if you are too far from a "switch," then you can't have DSL. In reality, the speed you get with DSL can be lower if you are on the outer limits, distance-wise. I think the largest advantage of cable over DSL is business model. For phone companies, the connection and data you send are their primary product. They really need to make money from you on the deal. For cable companies, the connection is a commodity component that complements their entertainment distribution model (cable TV). Their bread comes from elsewhere, so they don't seem to be excessively trying to monetize the engagement. Additionally, while both phone and cable are generally regulated like public utilities, to me cable companies seem more entrepreneurial in spirit and more interested in providing a service. Phone companies seem to me as if they are still coasting along with a monopoly driven bureaucracy in mind.

 Graphic Novels anyone? urlLink Fun article in the New York Times . Mentions urlLink "Maus" , a book I actually finished. Great FUN!

 From my experience.....there is little. I think it has something to do with subcontracted providers. I use road-runner...which is a cable connection.....however my service and money goes to Time-Warner Austin "The Cable Company". My boss uses earthlink like you do.....and has dsl.....but his service is provided by, plus his money goes to Southwestern Bell. and he has a contract. When it gets in to the nitty-gritty of details it comes down to how the information is getting to you....meaning cable or telephone wires. The company who owns the wires set the details. Earthlink nor Road-Runner own the wires they just rent the bandwidth....kinda like renting an apartment. I like my cable modem service and I have no contract and was issued a I.P. address. I find that my bosses dsl is slower and he is not issued an I.P. address but used PPoe. I understand how to Finagle and I.P. address so that multiple computers can access the internet on that one I.P. so I am not charged extra. I know nothing about PPOe. My vote is that you go with the cable modem. I am sure Adolph has more info but would probrably agree.

 Ok, so I am a few days late in getting this out and I totally forgot to call as was my plan for days, but thankfully it did not completely slip my mind: Happy Birthday Viejo!!!

 Hey guys, Do any of you have recommendations on high-speed Internet service? We have just been getting basic dial-up from Earthlink, but I am increasingly frustrated with waiting for pages to download and Anthony is finding it takes forever to send images to clients, and he can't send the really big files at all. I'd like it if we could keep our earthlink service, since that has also become our primary e-mail address and it's a real pain for Ant to change his e-mail address with all of his clients. These are the options Earthlink provides: DSL Basic Plan - $40/month, plus $99 activation and 12-month contract Cable - $40/month with no activation fee and no contract The second option looks better to me because I'm leary of contracts and it doesn't have the activation fee. Is there any reason why DSL is better? Thanks!!!

 Nothing of Importance Happened Today 7.1.2004 I woke up several times last night. I looked up from the bed through one sleepy eye and saw a blurry 2:45 suspended in the black room. Again, at 4:35, still hanging there like a nostalgic apparition, refusing to let go of the room he once inhabited. I closed my eyes twice and forgot about it. The third time the numbers we're clearer and more precise. Carol got to the alarm clock before i did. I sat up just as she came out of the bathroom. She eased back under the sheets, disappearing under their folds as if she'd never escaped them; the toilet quieted, and the house was quiet as a vacuum. Every morning i have the same thought when i flip on the massive row of bulbs that line the top of my bathroom mirror, "I'm going to rip those lights out..." the water from my new showerhead is fast and even. I want to imagine that i actually take quicker showers, now that there is no need to remove the handle and run it along my body to wet myself. I have to shave too. Four days and i look like a mountain man. Four days and i feel as if i could itch the skin right off my neck - i could stare down at my bloody fingernails dirtied with my hair and skin and say, "ahhhh, that feels nice." I wipe the steam from the mirror and it instantly appears again. I cover my face in a thin cream and shave quickly with no nicks. I used to nick myself all the time. I always came away with a spot of blood or two. Now, maybe my face has toughened, or my hands a little gentler -- either way, shaving seems to also go quicker these days; although, i don't think i could attribute that to my new showerhead. I iron in a towel. I take great pleasure in this. I really can't remember where this comes from. If i troll through my most recent memories, i have always loved to iron clothes. Is is the smell? (the same sense that keeps me away from potpourri?) Is it the sound? (my mothers old ironing board used to creak early in the morning as she ironed. Now that i'm thinking of it, this thought gives me some odd comfort.) why has this become so important to me recently? the control knob on my iron broke. now, just like our toaster, i have to unplug it to turn it off, and it only works on one setting: extremely, mind-numbingly hot. I wasn't too concerned, though, for most of my ironing jobs (pants and shirts) this is pretty much the setting i would use (maybe a little cooler). If carol ever asked me to iron a shirt for her, i would probably have to turn it down to accomodate the more delicate fabirc of her clothing, but it has been ages since she's asked me to iron anything of hers. I caught myself staring at new irons at target on a recent trip and was immediately drawn to a $40 or $50 dollar iron much the same way many people might be drawn to a new imac: it looked so cool. All chrome with a nice ergonomic handle with an open back. The name? The SHARK. "oh man, i've got to have this iron," i though to myself. I walked away before i spent the $50 i didn't have. I am the luckiest man on earth, my mother bought me a new iron for my housewarming. The iron's name? The SHARK. Karma, ladies and gentlemen, Karma. As soon as i can manage a trip to my mother's house (she forgot to bring it to the party) i'll be ironing up a storm; my shirts, pants, carol's shirts, carol's pants, the baby's shirts, adolfo's little shorts all ironed to a starchy perfection. I was expecting a fight this morning, but i think he was distracted with a toy he had searched out and become fascinated with. (It would be smart to think that this is what we should do every morning: just give him a toy and he'll be calm as you place him in his carseat. Smart, but mistaken.) It was a mexican toy. the one with a large wooden cylindar with a hole bored into its center attached to a stick by a string (just long enough to allow it to swing up). The object is to swing it up and over and land the stick into the hole. His object is to just hold it and gently place the cylinder onto the stick. Adolfo, without a fight, sat calmly in his seat and allowed me to lock him in. He was squarely fixed on his toy. I grabbed his lunch, prodded his mother to hurry and started the car. Traffic was light, mainly because we left early, 6:55. We got to the school about 6 minutes later and dropped him off without a problem. Traffic on the north loop was smooth until we hit 45, but even that moving, albeit, slower. I made it to the office right at 7:30. David is out for the remainder of the week, Kelly returns from his vacation (straight into Calendar problems i might add) and i have a day crowded with conferences and Dr. Kumar's powerpoint presenation project. (was it raining?) maybe it's just the air that's wet. i'm wearing a plain white undershirt. maybe i'm hot stepping out of the car; did i begin to sweat the second i stepped out of the driver's seat? My office is hot too. Is the a/c dead in here. The hallway is cool, so i don't even log in to my computer, i walk down the long hallway with my arms raised slightly so the cool breeze will evaporate my sweat. (maybe it was walking up two flights of stairs..) The main office is even colder; brooke is wearing a small sweater while she stares at her computer screen. Kelly , my boss, is already in a meeting regarding the conference room meeting calendar, which has already seen some problems during its recent implementation. That won't put him in a good mood coming right back into the race, so to speak. I chat and leave. (my office really isn't that hot, it was just my walking up the stairs.) My office really is warmer than it usually is, but i sit down and forget about it. I begin to like it. I get sleepy, but distract myself with a run to the file room. I pick films up for Neuro-Oncology conference this afternoon. Dr. Silverman zips past as fast as one can walk with a styrofoam cup of coffee. (coffee sounds good). Sarah, the girl stationed at the film library front desk, helps me sleepily. She had arrived just minutes earlier. I remember that i'm sleepy too. I am on the fourth floor as quickly as i can get there. Here, in the tan zone is a starbucks kiosk manned by an older black lady, i pour myself a Guatemala Antigua, mix in four packets of sugar and a skim milk to the top, and get my frequent coffee drinkers card punched. (two punches, nine to go -- your twelveth is free) Back at the office, i page dr. kumar, who comes by to re-visit conference cases. He chooses images, i compile them and put them into powerpoint. Donna sends me Dr. Raney's powerpoint file for Pediatric conference which i mesh with the existing presentation. Pat sends me another case for Neuro conference which Dr. Kumar will hate doing cause he's so busy. This month, the neuro staff (Dr's Kumar and Hunter) will get three additional radiologists. A godsend for them. The two of them have been doing 'head' reading for the entire hospital for the last six months or so. To put it mildly, they've been busy. And the morning flakes away, leaving me in the hallway again, heading to the SBC conference room, where i will load the Pediatric presentations and have lunch. The conference room is cool. Lunch arrives while i am loading the presentation. I eat and fall asleep as Dr. Raney drones on about rare pediatric heart tumors. Does diana fall asleep at these things? I'm sure she does. Dr. H was asleep once. I've seen various fellows sitting there with their bellies full of salad and their eyes heavy with sleep. How much of this is soaking in? Do they retain the statistics? Back in the hallway to the office. Dr. Kumar and his breath enter once more. He stays in the foyer to my office and reviews the unusally large load of neuropathology cases that are scheduled for review this afternoon. I burn all the pieces to my afternoon conference to disk and wait. Next week carol and i share a weeklong vacation. Her nephew, alex (isabelle's 14 yr old son) is flying down this saturday for his own vacation. He'll be staying with us. I'm trying to plan some things that won't totally bore him. I wonder if he likes to paint. Carol and i have fantasies of finishing up the kitchen, painting the hallway, bathrooms, and adolfo's room. I've also got ideas in my head to start a woodworking project -- maybe a small bookshelf. How much we will actually do remains to be seen. I do love to sleep late, i also really enjoy spending time at the movie theater. the doctors are filing in. some came early and crunched on cookies and sipped diet cokes. others came late, dipped down to avoid blocking the projector view and quickly finding a seat. discussion begins. cases are presented. questions, almost more questions than answers. the room always fills up twenty minutes after the conference begins.

 Over the last few days, I've had an adventure backing up and restoring my little sister's iBook. It is a computer that I gave to her but didn't completely clean up before I gave it to her. As a result, it had two disk partitions. A 30 gig standard Macintosh partition that was the boot disk and one 10 gig Unix File System (UFS) partition, which she didn't and couldn't really use. As an additional complication, her Firewire port quit, meaning that I had to back up everything over the network, which took a really long time. This is written as a starter guide for us to all get on a backup schedule and to understand what to do if you ever have to restore. First off, you have to identify some storage device that can hold all of your stuff. I picked an external hard drive because it was a cheap and flexible. There are caveats to backing up to a hard drive but it is better than nothing. Second, you need software that will do the backup. I selected urlLink Carbon Copy Cloner for the backup because it is widely used and free (donation-ware). Carbon Copy Cloner makes a clone of your hard drive to a disk image. Apple's Disk Utility can use the resulting disk image file to restore the back up onto the disk where you want it. However, the hitch is that you have to be able to start your computer from a drive other than the one you are restoring to. Unlike with older Macintosh operating systems, you cannot use the Mac OS X installation disk as a boot disk to do a software restore. To get around this, I used urlLink BootCD to create a CD that the computer can start up from and restore the hard drive from the backup disk image created by Carbon Copy Cloner.

 urlLink Bloomberg.com: : "In a 2002 referendum, 99 percent of Gibraltar's 20,683 registered voters chose to reject any plan of shared sovereignty of the territory between Spain and the U.K. The Spanish and British governments said the referendum had no legal merit. Spanish exports to Gibraltar last year totaled 420.3 million euros ($505 million), and imports from the territory amounted to 1.7 million euros, according to Spain's chamber of commerce." By those numbers, it looks like Gibraltar is a cash cow for Spain, and that nobody there wants to live in Spain. I wonder how many other national territory disputes are there out there: Gibraltar, Taiwan, Guantanamo, Belize (Guatamala claims it), Falkland Islands, Spratley Islands, Cyprus, Kuril Islands, Kashmir, Kuwait, Chafarinas Islands, ...

 So I was thinking this morning: criminals often get caught because their hair or some other DNA-laden material is found in the crime scene. (At least on TV.) What if a criminal purposefully loaded the scene with lots of other people's genetic material? Hair from the barbershop, boogers from under chairs, flakes of skin from old razors--the ultimate criminal wouldn't be an ultra-clean person wearing surgical gloves; they would be a mess of material incriminating anyone but themselves.

 Don't Know how I managed to wake up this morning given that I finally fell asleep around 4:30 or so. But I am glad that I did because I managed to catch This American Life . What a great program! This particular edition was the one where they try to interview everyone at the The Golden Apple in Chicago. I really enjoyed the texture of everyone's voices. I also liked the fact that the doors of the Golden Apple have no locks because the restaurant is always open. I also liked the impression that Donna, the night waitress, gave of how the diner changes as morning comes- how the morning crowd arrives like morning sunlight- slowly, with all freshness and hope of a new day. But mostly I liked the voices. I am amazed at how powerful a force of touch sound, in general, and the human voice, in particular, is. It seems to me that as we lay in the relatively static enviroment of the womb, sound was our first introduction to the variety of physical sensation and to touch. I often think how amazing it is that I can reach out an touch someone by making the air vibrate between us in a way that is particular to me. I am amazed out how comforting, how physically comforting a familiar voice is. I like to think that birds, for example, with their constant chirping are really maintaining constant network of touch; I like to think of whales somewhere in the deep- alone, speaking and hearing the long slow words of whales. This thinking explains the power of music. A group is bound together by a song because the group is literally embraced by the singing. This thinking helps me understand why a song, rather than an image, seems to to penetrate deeply into our us. It seems that The Hearing within us is far more ancient- for we heard long before we saw.
