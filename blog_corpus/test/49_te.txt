 What's a sprog? A kid, as said by the funny version of English spoken in other countries. We noticed it being used a lot on our vacation to Europe this summer. Anyway, this was a long time coming and I'm glad it's finally here. I hope this will be an easy way for friends and family to keep up with the goings on of the family, as well as view occasional pictures. I know a lot of parents who journal the development of their children. I'm not dedicated, but I do blog a lot. Sometimes I'm embarrassed to put too many stories about my kids on my blog so a while back I thought of creating a separate page as a single source of those types of entries.

 This morning I was driving in from Galveston (my parents are there for my mom's birthday) to take Aidan to school and he suddenly started crying and said something inaudible, but to the effect of pee pee and underwear. I asked him if he had an accident and he said not yet. We're so new to this whole potty-ing thing that I didn't dare push my luck. I exited the freeway, and pulled into this apartment complex's driveway. I took him down from his seat and walked over to the grass and explained that he would have to pee on the grass. I don't know why I thought he would have a hard time understanding or protest, but instead he proceeded to let loose the little arch of pee without comment. Boys are so weird. I bet he enjoyed it. A roadside pee is a nightmare for girls. I literally have horrible childhood memories about having to drop drawers next to the car when I was young. Anyway, this little experience goes on the list (no, I don't have a list) of Aidan accomplishments.

 I'm not convinced Ellie's ear is really better. I'm considering taking her (and maybe myself, as long as I'm there) to an acupuncturist. I've read from urlLink Dr. Weil and others that manipulations by masseuses or acupuncturists can relieve the pressure of the sinus cavities and prevent recurrent sinus and ear infections. urlLink Here is one very helpful site I've found so far on ear infections. Sorry, I don't know how to get rid of the about.com stuff.

 Today when I picked Aidan up from preschool I felt that familiar feeling. If you have kids, you probably know the one. It' s been way too long a week, and I am way too tired. If we go home right now I'm just going to be too bitey and feel bad about it later. So instead of turning toward home (I got the car back from John), I kept on driving to the video store. This is the second Friday I've done this in just a few weeks and it's already starting to feel like a bit of a family tradition. Last time I got him Spirited Away and Jonah. urlLink Look at my reviews here . When I told Aidan we were going to the video store, he immediately started his pleading to get Spirited Away again. I gave him that classic parental sell-out answer: we'll see. I was really hoping to get Nightmare Before Christmas to get us all in the mood for Halloween, but they only had the DVD and I thought to myself, if I wanted to watch the DVD, I sure wouldn't have come to the video store! But I did end up getting Spirited Away on DVD so we could rip it since Aidan seems to love it _so_ much. At least, I thought I did. I got home to find Anastasia instead. I also got him Wild Thornberries. I figured since DMB and Paul Simon are on the soundtrack, the movie can't be that bad. Bend it Like Beckham and the Secretary rounded out the day's selections. Aidan will sit through almost any movie with a foreign language in it, so maybe he'll sit through Bend it Like Beckham with all the accents? We'll see. Watch for my upcoming reviews...

 Aidan's teacher at school continues to impress me. She really takes an interest in him and his developmental progress. I was sharing with her my dilemma about the upcoming Halloween holiday because she knows about--and has applauded--my position on sweets. Last year Aidan was too young to even understand that candy was the point of all the festivities. This year, I don't think I'll be so lucky. The school party, the trick-or-treating with the grandparents, and the neighborhood afterparty promise to all push the sweets. She understood my problem, but instead of just saying I understand, she offered to do some research and help me come up with a solution. He's really making progress with the potty training, but it still just sucks. I find myself wondering sometimes if diapers forever could even be worse than this. All this week, his teacher would put him in a pull-up right before I came to get him because she knew we couldn't risk an accident on the bus. Again, she's a really good teacher. Ellie continues to be her bright and bubbly self, she loves everyone around her and lives so fully in every observation, every game. I can't get over how different her personality is from Aidan's at this age, and how different my relationship has been with them both. Aidan was so independent. He would love on me, then scramble away to explore. Ellie is so attached to me that we're both happiest when the other is near. She speaks to me so clearly, we communicate through all her emotions, body movements, and babbling. I know part of the reason she's so attached to me is that no one else can understand her so well and it makes her confused, even lonely. I lean on the advice from Dr. Sears about putting aside comments of others who think a very attached baby is a bad thing. I want to treasure and celebrate our relationship without editing it.

 Ellie and I were returning home after taking Aidan to school, and the card reader on the bus wouldn't take my bus pass. It turns out I've been somewhat freeloading the system. Even though a transfer pass lasts several hours, you aren't allowed to do "roundtripping" on a transfer. I tried to tell the guy I had always been able to take this route on the pass at this time and he pulled all his attitude out, "not on my bus, you didn't!" I didn't have any more money, so he stopped and we got out and walked. In the afternoon, I couldn't quite decide if I wanted to pay the extra dollar for a day pass (go legit) or try my luck at the system again, since I'd been able to do it for so long without knowing it wasn't allowed. I asked the driver about day passes to see how much they were, then got the regular $1 transfer, deciding on the latter course. But when I sat down, the woman next to me asked if I needed a daypass. I said yes and she traded tickets with me since she'd bought one but didn't need it anymore. I was jubilant! Not only did the pass cover our return trip without incident, since it's good for 24 hours, John used it this morning to get to work. I conquered the system! Ellie and I are basking in our newfound identity as thugs who got thrown off the Metro busline. It was a beautiful day for a walk anyway, and with that and all the bike riding and bus chasing this week, I bet I lose five pounds!

 The urlLink NYT reported today on a facinating new study out which, because of very unique and random conditions, was able to study a group of children as their families rose above the poverty level. The children's behavior improved as the income rose in a direct correlation. I quote: "The deciding factor appeared to be the amount of time parents had to supervise their children. Parents who moved out of poverty reported having more time to spend with their children. In the other groups, the amount of time the parents had on their hands was not much different." As always, if you aren't registered to see NYT stories, enter login name: pocketpass, password: pocketpass. It's urlLink Rebecca Blood's trick, I don't think she'll mind.

 How sadly ironic that you and the cast helped damage the image of breastfeeding on the same day that you focused on childhood obesity. Children who are breastfed exclusively for six months and then along with solids until they turn one year old are 72% less likely to be obese as adults. It seems very likely that the women's lib movement that improved living conditions for women immeasurably had a blowback effect on breastfeeding, and the country's skyrocketing obesity rates are a reflection of that. Mothers who breastfeed are less likely to experience postpartum depression after birth, and discovering the wonders of one's body is an extremely empowering and liberating experience for a woman. Breastfeeding also improves general health and IQ, which are both financially advantageous for the government in the long run. I am sure you think it's fine for the government to make policy for other health issues that greatly improve children's lives like mothers shouldn't smoke or drink during pregnancy. Our government has limited advertising for the sake of young people's health as well. Other than the fact that Norway's position is new and foreign to you, how is it different from these issues we now consider normal? For your information, I keep two blogs and this email will be published on them both. You can visit if you care to reply. www.planetsprogblog.blogspot.com www.planetnomad.blogspot.com

 I'm famous for not baby proofing my home. I chose early on to not go out of my way to rearrange my home for my kids. However, I did take care of things that could kill or mame like sharp objects, anchoring bookshelves, etc. I found out that bleach is the top reason people call poison control, and since I've found that veniger can do almost anything bleach can and then some, I stopped using bleach. Today I came across urlLink this article that goes over common drugs in the home that are surprisingly toxic to babies and toddlers. In my experience, your own home is not nearly so dangerous as those of others. You know your own home, which parts are the most dangerous, which parts to keep your kids out of. You don't know those things about the homes of others. My parents aren't used to having kids in their homes at all, as a result their medicine cabinet is at floor level. I'm sure it contains many of the drugs in that article. Their cleaners are all toxic in nature and located under their kitchen sink. This is just one example. You never know if other people's homes have guns or other dangers, even if they are parents themselves. Maybe your only recourse for this is to teach your kids not to explore other people's homes, but rather respect their space. This is so anti-attachment parenting, I know. You don't want to be paranoid, but you want to be realistic about dangers.

 We are a one-car family. In a city whose blood runs black with oil, and where a love affair with cars better distinguishes citizens than a sports team or even Texas history, we've become something like martyrs precisely because we continue to be a one-car family. John takes the bus every day from downtown to NASA, a 45 minute ride before 9/11 and a 60-70 minute ride since. He learned to fill the time with checking and returning emails and reading his daily myriad of government documents, the nature of which urlLink Al Gore tried so valiantly to distinguish in the federal government. Last month John bought a scooter off ebay, an electric Zappy, that was supposed to aleviate the many obstructions people eagerly inserted to the Houston commute in the name of 9/11. The first week he had the scooter, he was urlLink quickly tied up in a battle of legalities at NASA . After that, he enjoyed one blissful week of riding the scooter before he broke it by hitting a curb and breaking the rubber belt. Since then, we've tried in vain to replace the belt, but until we succeed, his commuting problems continue to abound. I'm not sure what value there is in having a gigantic federal government try to slightly downsize itself by outsourcing _everything_, but decentralization is the Soma of our electorate, and in a day and age where the motivation is fear and attitudes in the federal government resemble Salem, MA more than Arthur's round table, inviting contractors from around the world to submit bids for, say, equipment on the Space Station is, er, challenging. So instead of hosting meetings at JSC this week, John is tied up at the ever illustrious, and by illustrious I mean tacky, Nassau Bay Hilton. Needless to say, the Hilton not only lacks a bus stop, but is pretty far from the bus route. That is how I found myself at REI last night buying a bike trailer. Because, damn it, we're a one-car family. We believe in New Urbanism and Green Development, and we even sacraficed our first child, the Vehicross, to these ideals. John brilliantly fanagled this deal where we got the website sale price of $270 off $400 at the store and didn't have to pay the shipping from the website. This morning, like the good soldier I am in the battle to save our planet, I woke up early, fed and dressed the kids, and loaded them into our brand new Burlie D'Lite. The problem is, Houston is not made for anything but a car, and an SUV at that. That's not the only problem. Ellie isn't keen on her helmit, and the nylon straps have to hold her in the seat in lieu of her physical development capabilities. The trailer doesn't have shocks so the kids are jarred at every pothole, and in Houston, potholes are so proliferate that they were actually the deciding issue in the last mayoral election. As I bravely navigated the sidewalks and streets, I planned letter-writing campaigns to refurbish the sidewalks and giant mobilizations of handicapped and liberal one-car families where we march hand in hand demanding safe pedestrian ways. I got Aidan to school only 45 minutes late. The return was punctuated by Ellie's now over-tired cries and a nasty showdown with a semi-truck. It was totally his fault. He saw me in plenty of time to give me room to pass, but instead kept turning until he blocked both lanes of the street he was coming from and both lanes of the street he was turning onto, the street where I was stopped waiting for my light to turn green. My valour quells when my baby daughter is in the seat behind me, so instead of standing him down, I had to pick up the bike and the trailer, a feat of physical strength and coordination, and move onto the sidewalk. But from the safety of the sideline, I stood the most defiant stance I could muster, considering I was straddling a bike, wearing a helmit, and pulling an infant. I flicked my hand at my chin at him and he made hand gestures back to me. I saluted my middle finger triumphantly high in the air and yelled as loud as I could over his uber-engine, "fuck you you fucking bastard!" It may not have been a proud moment, but it was a human one. At this point I was just a few blocks from home and the rest of the ride was uneventful. John asked if the experience was a complete failure, and I could only say that the system needed an overhaul in order to survive, but that I plan to take the bus this afternoon.

 Friday I took Ellie to the doctor because, instead of getting better like the rest of us, she was actually getting worse. Thursday night she developed a junky cough and Friday her snot was green. So we went in and Dr. Ho said her lungs sounded fine, to my relief, but she did have an ear infection. I thought for sure this was the end of our perfect run of raising kids antibiotic-free, but he said we should just let it run its course. This is just how amazing my pediatrician is. He said in Europe they don't treat ear infections and they have a slightly higher incidence of complications, but most kids turn out fine. I was so relieved. I'd done the research on my own before going in for the three diagnoses I thought we might get: pneumonia, sinus infection, and ear infection. I read that infants who are breastfed are highly unlikely to get the flu because breastmilk is particularly tough against the influenza virus. Those who do get it have an even smaller chance of complications. About ear infections, I read that most babies left untreated will have about four days of pain and irritation, and depending on how miserable they seem, that can be treated with pain relievers. Taking an antibiotic is especially a bad idea at this point in the year because it wipes out all your good bacteria defenses just in time to leave you vulnerable for the large colonies of germs that grow indoors in colder weather. Ellie has to go back in two weeks to be sure her infections really heals on its own, but her immune system is so strong, I bet she'll be fine. I love the trust natural defenses first approach. Just for your added information, I did read that if your baby is prescribed antibiotics by your pediatrician, you should ask for the longer course rather than the new three or five-day ones because this is less likely to set your child up for a resistance to that antibiotic, something that helps bring about the repeat ear infections cycle so common in our country (along with milk or other food allergies).

 On Friday, Aidan only had one accident all day, and that was when he was napping so it wasn't exactly a traditional accident. Then yesterday was the big day of bm accidents and today was the big day of no bm accidents, but plenty of the other kind. On average, there is definite improvement, but little failures abound. Like when he wakes up in the morning and takes off his pull-up and goes right there on the bed and then calls us to wake up because he's had an accident. That one really sucked at 6:30 this morning. He holds himself a lot when he's just running around. The best we can figure is that he's not used to the boys bouncing since a diaper has always held them close until now. The other day he was watching me pee and he told me to remember to push my penis down into the toilette. I smiled and thanked him for the reminder. One of these days it's going to be pretty funny when he realizes that I don't have a penis! Now that he's working on potty training, he's more aware of body parts, so I imagine that day isn't too far away. The scariest idea is what to do when we go out of the house. This morning we went for breakfast at Croissant Brioche, then walked around Rice for a while, then went to Ikea, all with no potty breaks. He was in a pull-up and we, albeit irresponsibly, simply didn't ask him if he had to go or if his pants were dry. This is probably the last weekend we can get away with that. I've never been one to carry a diaper bag. I'm famous for cramming a rolled up diaper and a ziplock of wipes along with a cell phone, drivers liscense, car keys, credit card, and sometimes a passport into my clutch-size purse. The implication now is that I have to also have a pair of undies and a change of shorts on me if we go out. That just won't fit.

 A few years back, when queries by urlLink other countries forced our own CDC to finally take possible dangers of thimerozal into consideration, Public Health policy dictated the preservative, which contained urlLink far more mercury than considered safe, and had been implicated in urlLink brain damage similar to or causing autism , be urlLink phased out of vaccine production. This offered a simple, non-extreme solution for parents worried about vaccines: request vaccines that are thimerozal free. The problem is that this preservative is present in other drugs aside from the traditional suite of childhood vaccines. In my own pregnancies, I required injections of antibodies so that my RH Negative blood would not attack my child's blood. These shots traditionally contain thimerozal and I was unable to find out if the hospital had phased out the harmful preservative. Some OTC nasal sprays also have thimerozal as their active preservative. This week the CDC changed their usual stance on urlLink flu vaccines for children from recommending physicians offer it to recommending urlLink physicians advise parents to get it . This shot contains thimerozal. The rates of the famously severe complications are very low, but statistically speaking, some children will develop autism-like brain damage from this season's flu shots. The Today Show was the most recent to put this word out, but what every news report neglects to say is that the research on which this decision was based said young children take the flu harder, urlLink but are no worse for the wear as there is no mearsurable rise in mortality. Like many other branches of government, including the defense department, the CDC has been augmented lately with advisory panels and boards on which corporate tycoons that stand to benefit from CDC policy are allowed to sit. This "stakeholder policy" has further corrupted the government and guaranteed the public voice will continue to be stamped out. Here is exactly why I detest calls for lawsuit reform. Clearly, a devastating class-action lawsuit is the _only_ event that will convince the CDC to outlaw themerozal. Here in Texas, a proposition just passed that limited medical damages in law suits to $250,000 from doctors and $750,000 from insurance agencies. If your child became autistic before the age of five, would the $250,000 you might be able to win in a suit against a physician pay for the medical bills raising a brain damaged child would incur? $250,000 wouldn't even pay for raising a healthy child. Corporations, insurance companies, and legistators combined created a system whereby the only weapon an individual has against the system is a lawsuit. The law is written so that businesses and corporations are treated as an individual and given the same rights accordingly. Only, the law now gives them all the rights of an individual and additional special interest rights. An individual's wealth and assets would be considered in a jury decision, but for these entities, special limitations are written into the system. So the only weapon a parent might have had to fight the system and stop this reckless behavior has been shackled.

 Snot and drool continues to emit from my daughter. I'm over the cold so presumably my antibodies should have been passed on to her via breastmilk. But she continues to feel just miserable so either she has some sort of secondary infection (ear, sinus) or she's bringing in her top front teeth. I'm giving it some more time to either get worse or clear up and in the meantime I've put her down for her nap in her crib (only the second time she's ever slept in it in her nearly 9-month life). I put her in the crib because I wanted her to sleep at an angle to help drain her little snots and help prevent an ear or sinus infection in case one is immanent. And so I found myself pulling out the four fat volumes that comprise the Complete Works of William Shakespeare for the first time in a few years in order to prop up the top end of the crib. Slowly, quietly, since she was already asleep in it, I set the wheels right on top of the Bard's face. Forgive me yee gods and goddesses of iambic pentameter.

 Today I picked Aidan up from school and his teacher announced the amazingly happy news that he didn't have any accidents today. I was more than excited. We began this last Wednesday and already such a success! When I got Aidan home, it became clear that he was having one of his days where he can focus on nothing and meddles in everything. A few hours in, at exasperation's dawn, John offered to take him to the park. Or the krap as we've come to call it since Aidan figured out what P-A-R-K means. We also use a lot of pig latin. Anyway, at the krap Aidan had an accident of the number 2 variant. It was everywhere, and awful. John undressed him on the porch, which would prove a fateful decision. He hosed him off in the shower laboriously, then I dressed Aidan and we both went to cleaning. By the time we got back to the porch, the cat had gotten into Aidan's clothes, so we had to give her a bath, too. Needless to say, what seemed like a victorious day at early afternoon turned into a sad defeat three accidents (one more #2, and a #1) later at early evening. I hate crap. I especially hate crap at the krap. I am looking forward to how easy everyone says potty training a girl will be compared to the boy. I think it's pretty funny that spellcheck doesn't recognize potty.

 urlLink The Daily Kos is a much loved blog that truly ranks among the bloggeratti. Kos, or Markos, keeps an additional blog these days that I recently found. It seems the world will soon have a little dialykos running around! You can read about it urlLink here . He hasn't written in a few days and I bet everyone wonders if Elisa's had the baby. That's just the evil of being near term, though. I remember it was those weeks that caused me to pull the cord finally on the answering machine earlier this year. Just so you know, Kos is still updating at the other site so I'm sure there's no baby. So far, urlLink this is the funniest entry. It's on the giant gamble that is life insurance and how the only way to win the bet is to die.

 When I picked Aidan up from school a few days ago, his teacher told me she thought he was ready to try potty training in full. I've tried two different methods so far and both times failed miserably. I tried sewing cloth diapers into his underwear and I tried six days of bare bottoms before I went batty from wiping his bottom every five minutes all day from excessive pooping. When he started school, I explained that he'll go every time you sit him on the potty, but he doesn't initiate it at all. So he's been going with the other kids at planned times, but wearing diapers, too. I really hoped the peer pressure thing would work in our favor and encourage him to really get into the action. So yesterday I took Aidan to school in underwear and gave his teacher no fewer than five changes of clothes. Turns out I should have given her socks, too. Yesterday he had three accidents, but today he only had two. The big improvement today has over yesterday is that he woke from his nap and went to the toilet before he had a chance to have an accident. Also, when we got home yesterday, he had three accidents in short repetition before I gave in and put a pull-up on him. Today he is still in underwear, no accidents, and we've been home for several hours. Much progress! I'm so happy with his teacher, she really likes Aidan and is so intuitive to his needs. This success is in large part due to her.

 This morning was Aidan's school picture day. I took Ellie and they took a sibling shot, too. So, we should have some studio pictures of the kids in time for Christmas! That is, if it worked. They both smiled at the same time, and in my experience that means the camera broke or the flash did, or maybe one of them has crossed eyes or a booger. They never smile at the same time. They did look pretty cute though. Last night I went out shopping for their picture outfits and was startled to realize how conformed I was to the movement of parents as a marketed segment of the population. Each store I went to, and there were three, advertised in their windows and inner displays school picture outfits. It wasn't just part of their ad-campaign either, it was the focus. So you can squeeze school picture season in between new school clothes and Halloween outfits as the new marketing holiday Americans celebrate. And boy did I ever partake! I dropped $70 before the night was through because the last holiday's clothes were overflowing on the clearance racks, and you can't ignore clearance... I have a whole new respect for those teachers, the classroom was an absolute zoo! They were kept on their toes, wiping noses, straightening outfits, smoothing hair while still doing their normal job of keeping the kids from banging windows and hitting each other. If that were my job, I would find myself drinking a lot of alcohol.

 This is a fairly new publishing house in El Paso, Texas. Last year, my mom got the kids a few of their books, and I still love them. Most of their children's books are in English and Spanish. They have good adult's books, too, though!

 urlLink KidsII : "Take the time to enjoy this experience. All too soon your older child will want to bathe himself. Don’t miss out on these early years that you will always remember with fond memories." Dr. and Mrs. (she's a nurse, how do address a nurse?) Sears raised 8 kids. That's right, 8. They give good advice.

 John missed his bus this morning so he came back home and made us all breakfast! It was a fun taste of our week to come. Oh, I wish it was here already. The morning is cold, but clear and sunny. Very unlike Houston...

 My mother-in-law has done a great job finding some of the gifts I'd put on the kids wishlist. She scored big at Steinmart. I took those items off the list to help prevent duplication. Ella brought in one of her top two front teeth last week, but the other has yet to follow. I guess she won't get stuck with that annoying song comment for Christmas! I've finally found something she'll eat beside tortillas or Annie's White Shells & cheese: fried egg yolk. Since I'd read that egg yolk is a good protein source for babies (under one you should avoid egg white because it has more of an allergen risk), I'd tried boiling eggs and giving her the yolk several times in the past month with zero success. Then, last week when Yolanda watched the kids, she cooked them eggs and cheese and they both ate it up, so I decided to follow her lead. I fried the eggs in olive oil and topped with grated cheese, then I ate the whites and she ate the yellows. It worked great. You would not believe the number of foods I've tried with her, only to have her turn her nose at almost everything. I was so spoiled by Aidan who would eat anything you put in front of him. He still does, especially if you give him chopsticks with it. From food to gross. Sorry. I've successfully treated our first case of ringworm on Aidan, using all homeopathic remedies! Ringworm is not actually a worm, but rather the same fungus that causes jock itch or athlete's foot, only on a prominent body part. In Aidan's case, it was on his back. His was a classic red, raised ring covered with dry scales. A couple of times a day we put tea tree oil on it and within a few days it began to harden. In the shower I brushed off the scales, and we continued the tea tree oil. A few days later, it's gone! I'm so relieved.

 urlLink Guardian Unlimited Politics | Special Reports | British parents set to lose right to smack children I quote from the article: "Although a study by the National Family and Parenting Institute last year found there was no evidence that mild slaps delivered within a loving relationship damaged a child, it concluded that physical punishment did not work in changing behaviour..." I am so utterly shocked by this. To say the least, I think it is a horrible idea. When in the UK last summer I read in newspapers that this might come to a vote, but I got the impression it was a long shot. Now, it looks to pass. I've written in my parenting essays a pretty extended position on this topic. I depend on the US's own National Academy of Pediatrics, which last year reversed its policy of recommending parents don't spank, to instead say that physical punishment appears to have the same potential for abuse as emotional punishment. My essays emphatically say that, just as a person in danger of alcoholism, either from genes or experience, should be much more apprehensive about drinking than others, people in danger of abuse either because they themselves were abused or because they've crossed the line before, should avoid spanking, as it could be a gateway to physical abuse. Politicians like to polarize issues into black/white, good/evil conditions, when nothing in the world abides by such descriptors. In addition to legislating morality, this law appears to be especially weak because the circumstance in which it is reacting would not be prevented tomorrow in light of that law. That case involved an aunt who routinely beat a girl, and no official from the education to medical sectors reported it. Eventually the girl died form injuries sustained during one such beating.

 this morning at the park one of our neighbors was there with his son, who was on his big boy bike with no training wheels for the first time. It was so exciting to see them, we pulled out Aidan's tricycle (he'll be getting a real bike w/training wheels for Christmas) so Aidan could be like the big boy. The dad was explaining that they'd tried to remove the training wheels a few times before with no luck, much falls, never really balancing. Then, the uncle got the boy a scooter (the two-wheel zappy, no motor, small skate wheels) and the bike was kind of forgotten for a while. The boy played so well with the scooter, and it turned out to be the perfect middle ground of control and balance, by the next time they tried the bike with no training wheels, his balance was adequately mastered and today he was riding very well, practicing braking and getting back on (after many falls, which dad took like a pro with atta' boys and up you goes). He also said, and I've read this elsewhere, that the bike with training wheels was much more stable than a tricycle, and more realistic to maneuver like a real bike.

 Aidan continues to amaze us with his puzzle abilities. He's sucking them in as fast as we can throw them at him. Two weeks ago I went to TJMaxx (like I needed an excuse, right?), which is a good source of occasional amazing clothes like my Tommy Hilfiger jeans and Born Mary Janes, as well as amazing toy finds, lately a lot of Melissa & Doug brand stuff, one of our favs. I got him one four small puzzles in a box set, and one big floor puzzle to replace the large zoo floor puzzle he'd mastered. The four puzzles in the box are already mastered and he needs a little help with the floor puzzle, but he's done it quite a few times now. It's just a matter of time before he does it on his own. When John went to Boon this past week, he went to this great little toy store he likes to frequent there because all the toys are wooden and developmental. He got Aidan a 60-piece animal themed floor puzzle, and this morning they've done it together twice! He's so hungry for them, I actually hesitate to ask for them for Christmas because surely he'll burn out, right? I shouldn't think so necessarily, because it seems to me that Aidan's desire for this kind of activity is closely related to the veracious nature with which John always went after (wait, did I just use the past tense? goes after) building legos designs. You see, a girl looks at legos and sees a creative palate from which a house or a monster can be constructed. But guys tend to see a challenge to replicate (like putting a puzzle together) the design on the box. After that's accomplished, maybe the creative palate bit comes into play, like morphing two airplanes together to make a Death Star, or adapting the airplane to become a boat or a spaceship, but the key is to create the design for which that set of legos was packaged. I know, this boy stuff is so foreign, but I'm learning. It's hard to get Ellie toys just for her, because even in front of a perfectly age-appropriate developmental toy, she'll just reach for Aidan's toy instead. That's one reason I really want the bolsters, if I or anyone else can figure out how to do it. The best thing for her interest is physical obstacle courses. Already, she crawls up the big slide in our park over and over while out there. She crawls up to the top and then crawls around the top platform if I let her, most of the time I just stand by the side of the slide and pick her up when she gets to the top and put her back at the bottom and she does it again. Kind of Sisyphus style, right? I say crawl, it's more like scurry. She does it on her hands and feet bottoms. This week it's been colder so she's been wearing pants more. She's used it to her advantage. She's figured out to climb up a bit, then lean forward on her knees and pick her feet up and she slides back down backwards. She has the best look in her eye when she does this. We had to remove the slide on Aidan's bed b/c Ellie was crawling up it without us knowing and I caught her just as she got to the top and would have presumably fallen down the ladder side! Maybe I don't give her enough credit, she might have just played on the bed a little, but it was still scary enough that we took the slide down that night.

 Rosa Taylor is an old friend of ours in El Paso. She helped host my baby shower before Aidan was born. She recently started a business in El Paso, urlLink a local franchize of a toy store called Discovery Toys . If you aren't in El Paso, she does mail delivery, but it made the most sense to recommend for El Paso folks. To be honest, much of her selection is better than Amazon's! In an effort to support the small business owner, here are some Christmas list ideas just from Rosa's website: Ella: Good Catch Nubby Ball Twinkle Roller ABC Box Hide Inside Stacktivities activity center My First Accordian (since accordian playing runs in the family!)

 This morning I was watching the Sharon Osborne Show, Kelly was the co-host and she and Ozzy performed their very sweet, touching song about dads and daughters growing up. Just as the TV showed a big close-up of their singing faces, Ellie started singing with them! I've thought she's been singing before, but this is the first indisputable proof. I'm so happy for her! I should write Kelly and Ozzy to let them know their little duet is now a threesome!

 apparently, sidewalk chalk by the name Double Dip'n Fun has been recalled because it contains lead. yuck.

 urlLink Guardian Unlimited | Special reports | The marketing machine aimed at our children

 Aidan was cuddling in bed with me and his hand was absentmindedly patting my leg. He all of a sudden said with wonder, mama, you have cactus on you! His little observations seem pure genius for a 2 3/4 year old boy. Why can't the little genius figure out how to stop dripping on the floor after he pees so my bathroom will stop smelling like a truckstop!

 I've already been getting queries from loving relatives about the kids' Christmas lists. Since they're still too young to beg for their own desires, I'm relishing what will probably be my last Christmas of choosing their gift lists for them! I've created an urlLink Amazon.com wishlist for them under the name Feighery Children and am working hard to fill it with ideas. Regarding toys, we seem to return to a few favorite themes: wooden toys are always good, toys that don't take up too much space are also appreciated since our house is only 950 square feet! Aidan's really into puzzles and building toys, to include robots so we decided to put some of the new Fisher Price transformers for younger kids series on the list. He has a My First Leappad from last Christmas, so I also added a few new Leappad books. Ella's favorite toys are always Aidan's toys so I continue to keep the small parts on his toys to a minimum. She also enjoys musical toys, she loves the xylophone. Books are always loved by both kids. Amazon doesn't carry roller blades, but I am definitely ready to skate with Aidan so any blades or skating accessories will be appreciated. I also expect him to enroll in soccer this year, so soccer accessories are also good. For physical development, any kind of big bolster pillows in strange shapes would be a nice find for Ella, but I don't know where one would get such a thing and I'm not about to make them! We decided to make the official switch from videos to DVDs, but will keep around the VCR for a year or two more so if you already bought a video, no need to return it! Aidan continues to love playing computer games, and Sesame Street seems to be his favorite theme. His computer can't really support the new games out there, so we're thinking of giving him my computer and getting me a new one. Anyway, just about any themed game with an age range of 3 give or take a year is good for him. Ella will be on the computer within the year, so age range of 1-2 is good for her. She loves Teletubbies and Blues Clues. Aidan wears 3T pants and 4T tops, his shoe size is anything bigger than a 10.5 (he grows fast so feel free to buy big in all clothing items). He's grown out of his jeans, so they're on the list of wants. Ella tends to wear her prescribed age size range for most brands, so at Christmas I would get a 12 month size if it's wintery or an 18 month size for spring or summer clothes. Like Aidan, she tends to be a little longer in the torso and shorter in the legs, so if in doubt on bottoms sizes, go a bit smaller. Her shoe size will be around a 4, at her age shoes with very soft soles are best. I always liked the StrideRite brand for Aidan. My best tip for good kid clothes is to frequent the clearance racks at BabyGap and the Children's Place (at Cielovista in El Paso, in the Village in Houston). Similarly, TJ Maxx and Marshalls Superstore seem to be fantastic places for developmental toys. Hopefully, within a year Aidan will be in a French program, so language toys would be very thoughtful. He's already exposed to a lot of Spanish, thanks to occasional caregivers Yolanda and Patti and I want to build on that. Finally, let me say that our family and friends have been so great to get the kids neat presents throughout the year. It's become somewhat functional for us. With birthdays so close to Christmas, I really think it's a nice policy to do Christmas gifts a little light and sprinkle sustaining toys as they take their developmental leaps around the calendar. Be warned that if anyone gets Ella My First Purse or a Knee Pony, they will face the wrath only I can dish! And please know that I put together this list to try to make shopping easier for those of you who have already asked about toys. I don't mean to ask anyone to buy these gifts. If you do want to buy a gift, you don't have to buy from Amazon, it's just a source of ideas in a medium that was easy to distribute. We love and miss you all, and the best gift will be sharing time together over the holidays! UPDATE: I was practicing searching for the kids' wishlist on amazon to make sure family would be able to do it, and I was shocked to see 20 wishlists that come up under a wishlist search for "feighery" to include a wishlist for Aidan Feighery of Dublin, Ireland! The wishlist I've referenced here is for Feighery Children, and you'll know it's the right one because 1) it will have toys on it, and 2) it will say they live in Houston, Texas.

 So things are seeming much better ( urlLink as detailed here ). Aside from John's emergence as Boundaries Dad, the weekend's biggest developments included Ellie coloring for the first time and Aidan taking a whole new leap into abstract thinking. Ellie crawled up to Aidan's easel while I was making dash letters for him and pulled herself to a stand, then proceeded to grab a crayon and hit the paper with it. Now, a day and a half later, she's already progressed to making streaks instead of just percussion dots. Aidan's questions have moved past "why" to full sentences that indicate he's been thinking critically about something for a few minutes before throwing out the words. He's been using full sentences for a long time, but his questions are what seem to be reflecting a new level of depth. Accordingly, he seems to be having a hard time finding words again. I think this is just what comes along with his little brain spurts. When Michie was here this week she was asking about Ellie's ear and how that's healing. I told her I took Ellie back to the pediatrician and he said it seemed to be clearing up on its own. Mich had learned in her classes (PA program) that pressing in on the tragus (the outer bump thingy on your ear, I want mine pierced actually) is a good way to find out if a child has an ear infection because it will be pretty sensitive if he or she does. She pushed on Ellie's and Ellie proceeded to cry out for several minutes straight. So I got all worried about Ellie's ear thinking maybe it hadn't cleared up after all. I spent the next few days giving the kids echinacea and taking it myself along with garlic and onions. I massaged her sinus bones and jaw when she nursed. I put her crib back on the incline for her naps. Then, yesterday I was relieved to push in on her tragus with no response at all. Who knows what did it, but I think she's finally better. Now that that's better, she has a runny nose. Something new is probably on its way, no doubt caught at the doctor's office last week!

 urlLink The Way We Live Now: Too Much

 The new and improved Boundaries Dad is home, and up to the task. I'll give him this, he may have needed to be hit over the head with a brick, but I only had to do it once. I'm much happier with a belly full of Chick Fil-A waffle fries and a G n' T. John and the kids are at the park play dating it with Mathilde. You know that feeling when you take the first sip of a strong drink and you feel the relaxing alcohol coursing through your veins? Sanity returning feels much the same... If nothing else will remind you of the dreamy wonder of parenting, urlLink this will .

 Maybe it's evident from last night's poetic disturbance of urlLink Elizabeth Barret Browning's otherwise wonderful work that things have been a little rough. I always hoped space would take John away from me, but I didn't expect it to do so when he's still on Earth. I'm trying not to be bitter, but I do hate air and water right now. John's unhappy too. He hates being away from the kids so much. Often he gets home when it's time for them to be in bed. He was in meetings all last Saturday, then tagged up via teleconferences on Sunday so he could have a little family time between. Today he's at meetings again. I don't know how single parents do it. This sucks. Last February the Shuttle accident was so traumatic and horrible, I was willing to do anything to support John's work. With a toddler and a one-week-old baby, I let him end his paternity leave early and go back to a schedule that was double and sometimes even triple his normal routine. It was hard, but we all said it would get better in June after the first Soyuz and Progress had launched. June came and went, and we took a nice long vacation, but the projects piled high when we returned. Now, the recent public problems with the air and water monitoring have lead to a new series of disasters. This project should be finished sometime next month. The temptation for John as well as John's bosses is to pile on another crisis at that point. But I've communicated with John, and to his credit, he listened and understood what I meant and the nature in which I said it, there cannot be any more projects like this unless I've got back-up. Maybe my parents will move here and that will help. But he needs to treat his part of parenting just as he would his job: if he's not around to do it, he finds someone to cover for him. He can ask his mom to come or his sister to help or be creative with finding another option. But finding that option is his responsibility, not mine. We live in a society now where people generally understand that division of labor is not gender dependent. The kids need supportive parenting from both their mom and their dad. My life and interests are every bit as important as his, and should not be maligned simply because a difference in chromosomes. Most importantly, I need to get back to doing the things in life that give me a feeling a value an importance. I want accomplishment and measurable successes. I want to be sane. These are the seeds of unfulfilled desires that could easily lead to major problems down the road, at best a midlife crisis and at worse the break-up of the family. I think we're averting those ends by communicating clearly now. Since progress is what's given me as a woman the capacity to want these things, progress should also give me the ability to communicate and fulfill my wants without harming my family. I've been pregnant--in the sense that my body has been the sole support for a child--for over three years! For much of that, I've been able to have some time to myself, whether it was at work or at home. This is pretty much the slimmest that margin has gotten. It's good to know how much a person can take, but it's better to learn from the experience and set clear boundaries that protect everyone. Here's my boundary, world! Do you hear me? This is all I'm going to take.

 One bm accident a day hozed off in the shower Two pieces of my guests' jewelry I stuck my hand in the toilette to retrieve this morning Three creatures' shit I have to clean up now that we have a cat Four hundred fifty dollars a month for part-time pre-school Five meals a day I make for others but never have time to eat myself Six forty-five am, when the kids wake thanks to the time change Seven days a week, twenty-four hours a day with no coffee breaks Eight o'clock at night when the kids go to bed and I have a minute to breath deep for the first time all day Nine o'clock at night when the kids actually fall asleep Ten o'clock pm, when I fall in bed too tired to enjoy the time to myself

 We were so impressed by the school. The student body seemed on the wealthier side, which was the biggest drawback. And they were overwhelmingly white. French, Spanish, German, and English white, but white nonetheless. John especially from his Coronado upbringing wants Aidan to be around kids from diverse socio-economic backgrounds. If we enroll Aidan at MECA as well though, he would get a lot of exposure to poorer international families. The curriculum is just amazing. At the preschool level you choose whether you want your child to learn French or Spanish first and then the child spends at least 50% of his or her time speaking and hearing that language. The high school students who showed us the campus had all taken summer school projects in Bolivia or Argentina or other amazing places. I'm not totally impressed with the competitive athletic program, but we're far from that and leagues are so big in the cities anymore that my niece Kristin, who is actively scouted even though she's just a Sophomore (because she's already 6'3") may not even play school ball this year and do league ball instead. There were parents from so many different countries in South and Central America and Europe. It was great to be surrounded by such diversity. Most of the parents did not bring their pre-school aged children. Some did, but I felt like everyone should have. Aidan behaved very well. I was proud of him. French children in general have higher standards of behavior. It's funny, because Italian and Spanish children have lower standards there, I mean, the parents have a much more hands-off parenting approach. But not France. The director of the preschool program said the Awty is not for everybody. It is a very structured environment. And I understood that she was specifically saying that if you are the kind of parent who does not believe in discipline, don't send your kid here. They raised tuition from what the website said. That was bad, but I still think you can't put a price on education. The Awty is the second largest international school in the US, second only to the UN school in New York. There are plenty of schools in Houston that are far more expensive, but I really think this is the best one. Applications are due December 20!

 Today's urlLink Ramadan Journal features a mother's hilarious comments about the secret added benefit of the holy season's fasts: finally losing those pesky ten pounds! As long as your at the Journal, stick around for urlLink this essay , which discusses the western world's influence on Islam with a fast food analogy: "All of the sophistry of our past can be swept under the rug of the contemporary feel-good fast-food-Islam literature. For the first time in Islamic history we have an institution (The Saudi Council of Esteemed Religious Scholars, or whatever they call themselves) which can tell us (the lay people) what Islam is and how to follow it." The author argues that modern Muslims are buying into the single-dose peddlers of their religion, a la Islam for Idiots, at the expense of truly studying and understanding what they believe. I see his point, and yet, I also feel the advent of this new form of religious literature offers a wider variety of media through which the average Muslim can approach his or her religion, which might encourage those who would never study their belief system at all, instead just following what they are told or tradition without critical examination.

 Tonight is the open house at one of Houston's big private schools, urlLink the Awty School . So far, this is the only private school we are considering. The school is based on the French public school model as it was originally created for French ex-pats, and accordingly, students graduate with both their French Baccalaureat and American diploma. The student body is capped at 40% American so that at least 60% of the students are international. This is the biggest attribute from our viewpoint because we want our kids to be surrounded by people from different backgrounds than themselves. The second biggest attribute is that classes are taught in one of five languages, although the major focus is on English, French, and increasingly, Spanish. Since the curriculum begins at the age of three, we'll be submitting applications this winter, hoping for a spot next fall. I find myself trying with every cell in me to not put pressure on this. If it's meant to be, it will be. The last thing I want is to give Aidan a complex, but still, what if he has an accident while we're there? And what should I wear? I'm sure that at this event, just as it is at every event at Aidan's current school, we'll be the youngest parents. I just hoped we aren't given the usual age-ist treatment, the snubbing, the looking past us. I don't want Aidan judged for our age. I want to wear a sign around my neck that says I swear I'm educated and I planned my conceptions. So, seriously, what to wear. Ella will probably wear her new red striped dress from Aunt Becky. I think I'll put Aidan in his blue sweater and corduroys. Maybe it's a bit hot, but he looks even cuter when he's sweaty. His cheeks get all rosy and his hair kinks up. John will be coming directly from work, so he's in his work clothes. I was thinking of my purple jumper-style dress that goes down to the ankles because that's kind of matronly and, to my experience, moms in Europe are pretty traditional. I could wear my new Born Mary Janes to make it edgy traditional. My mom, though, pointed out the European emphasis on fashion, and suggested I wear a sweater under a blazer. It's a good idea, but it requires shopping as I do not currently have a short, fitted blazer. Maybe I'll call John's sister and see if she has one. I'm afraid of looking to stylish, because that would only accent my age, which I consider our current biggest drawback. So much doubting! I hate this!

 The newest member of the blogging community has urlLink presumably just been born !

 urlLink Fetal Brains Suffer Badly From Effects of Alcohol

 Congratulations to Jorge, Alina, and Emilio who are expecting a new family member this summer!

 OK, I know it's overdue. Everybody wants to know the wrap-up on Halloween. I've been asked how the kids did, how I handled the candy thing, so give the public what the public wants! First, you have to know that the reason I'm only just getting to the wrap-up is because I'm only just catching my breath! It was so hard! Just as I learned the hard way urlLink about Easter eggs , I've learned the hard way about Trick-or-Treating, too. At least, my neighbors did. I just want to say this in defense of the Bazins. What a wonderful thing it was in this age of parents checking candy that Danny Bazin baked chocolate swirl cakes to hand out, knowing that parents who knew and trusted her would be coming to the door. They were fantastic, too. I ate Aidan's and Ella's. Mathilde had hers early, though, because I quickly unwrapped it and shoved it in her mouth so that getting swarmed by the fireants at the Bazin's gate wouldn't give her a lifelong complex about Halloween. So, the first lesson to mark in the book for Halloween rookies is to check your steps outside your door for fireant piles before the little ones show up. This all happened after the school Halloween carnival, which I greatly underestimated. When forming my expectations, I must have thought of school parties like I had at Tucumcari's modest public schools as I was growing up. I thought of parents sitting uncomfortably in little chairs watching the kids run wild under fluorescent lights. I thought of orange punch and candycorns, sticky in the bowel from little kids' sweaty hands. I thought wrong. My first realization of this was when, upon driving up fashionably late, I could not find a parking spot. The entire lot and every street around was packed. We parked four or five blocks down and walked passed a myriad of BMWs and Mercedes. The second realization was when I heard good music on quality speakers coming from behind the main building. We walked around to find a gigantic yard area beautifully decorated with artsy strings of lights hanging from the abundant ancient oak trees. Before walking out of the house, I jokingly asked John if there would be drinks and John said, honey we don't send our kids to that nice of a school. We laughed, but the joke was on us. The final realization was the keg and table of decent wine magnums freely flowing. The wild thing was how the kids seemed sort of subdued by the havoc. They must have been screaming as they played and ran, but the music tuned them out. The networking parents worked the yard, and I could only laugh because they all looked so serious. I found one of Aidan's friend's parents and made small talk. Soon a few other parents who weren't ambitious enough to build their business connections also stood with us. I tried my best to be funny and light, but they looked at the freakishly young mom and only politely laughed. Someone was talking about potty training and I told them my theory on how it's a great drinking game for parents, I guess it has just been too many years since they thought about drinking games. My parents were there, they took a ton of pictures with the kids as all this was going on. When we left I really enjoyed their comments. They said they don't go to parties like that in El Paso! They also thought it was funny that all the parents there were their age. Because I desired to look good at the party, and because I can fit into my black cigarette pants again, I wore my black boots, with a smart square toe and high heels, but now I can tell you that the second lesson to mark down in the rooky handbook for Trick or Treating is to wear comfortable shoes. My feet still hurt. After Trick or Treating, a neighbor held an After Party, complete with a moonwalk. I guess I didn't understand what time most people do these things. It gets dark these days around 5:30, the school party went from 5-7. We left early to get to Trick-or-Treating. We finished by 7 and showed up at the After Party embarrassingly early around 7:30. As the host let us in I asked what time it was, and when he told me 7:30 I was floored. I was tired enough from dragging the toddler door to door with the baby on my hip, that I felt it was 10! Apparently, the After Party turned into a roaring good time well attended by the whole neighborhood, but we left long before that point. We put the kiddos and husbands to bed and mom and I alone stayed up late watching Tu Wong Fu because I don't like scary movies anymore. So, the last issue: the candy. Aidan's teacher made special treats for everyone in her class and Aidan's bag alone contained apples instead of candy (didn't I tell you she's fantastic!). This was really the only time all night that he saw other kids eating what they got, and he got the impression--and we did nothing to correct him--that the holiday was about getting surprises and dressing up rather than eating candy. I did let him have a piece or two of his candy, and my parents were good not to push more on him. We're giving the rest away to his amazing teachers.

 urlLink God's Maternal Love by Diana Rowan : "Christian visionaries from St. Anselm and St. Mechtild to St. Catherine of Siena, even St. Augustine -- for all his misogynous moments -- have spoken of the maternal nature of God's love. Clement of Alexandria alludes to 'the milk of the father', and to 'the father's loving breasts', perhaps surprising to us. Twelfth century Cistercian monks wrote of 'Mother Jesus' as a symbol of tenderness and supportive love. And I was surprised and touched, last Sunday here in church, to hear a parallel human theme in the exquisite Purcell anthem: 'Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem, ...for kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and queens thy nursing mothers...' What can this mean for us, this ancient gender-bending which could even leave us a bit uncomfortable. One can find it in Buddhist imagery as well: the great mother protector in Tibetan Buddhism, the saviouress Tara, is often referred to as 'the female Buddha', and an embodiment of wisdom and compassion. She is said to have sprung from a single tear of grief and compassion for the sufferings of all humankind -- which fell from the eye of the great bodhisattva, Avalokiteshvara. He in turn, was an androgynous/male figure which, over the centuries and in various lands, was closely identified with the female protectress, Kuan Yin --'She who hears the cries of the world', She who comforts every grief'..."

 urlLink Guardian Unlimited Books | News | Rowling books 'for people with stunted imaginations' : "Writing in the New York Times, Byatt dismissed the latest instalment of the boy wizard's adventures as below par 'ersatz magic' which lacked the skill of the great children's writers and catered for readers with stunted imaginations. The adventure became the fastest selling book of all time when it was published last month. But according to Byatt: 'Ms Rowling's magic world has no place for the numinous. It is written for people whose imaginative lives are confined to TV cartoons and the exaggerated (more exciting, not threatening) mirror-worlds of soaps, reality TV and celebrity gossip.' She said children were understandably attracted to fantasies of escape and empowerment but the books lacked the 'compensating seriousness' of novelists such as Susan Cooper and JRR Tolkien. Byatt, best known for her novel Possession, said she believed adults had become fans because the books allowed them to regress into the comfort zone of childhood. 'Ms Rowling, I think, speaks to an adult generation, that hasn't known and doesn't care about mystery. They are inhabitants of urban jungles, not of the real wild,' Byatt said. 'They don't have the skills to tell ersatz magic from the real thing, for as children they daily invested the ersatz with what imagination they had.' "

 so please don't think me greedy. But still, these shoes would be great for our new little walker. Btw, she's up to three steps at a time now!

 First prize is diplomatically shared between my mother-in-law and mom for following my own wishes and recommendations posted here in the past two months. The kids are now well-dressed and have fantastic developmental toys with which to play. Go moms. Second prize, however, goes to Aunt Mary for the special hidden "After Christmas" toy, the Zip Track. This is a great toy, folks. I think kids from 2 to 12 would love it, as well as my 24 year-old sister-in-law and 27 year-old husband. This toy will be left at the grandparents' house for grandchildren infinitum. Third prize goes to aunt Jenny for the cute animal picture holders. This prize must be given with the caveat notating my mother-in-law who really picked it out, and probably bought it. Good gift. To be fair, the prizes must later be ammended because one set of presents awaits us in Houston via post.

 In more precise terms, she took her first step. But it's still amazing. And because it happened yesterday, it's going down in the books as she took her first step at 10 1/2 months (she turned 11 months today). I'm really happy for her accomplishment. To be honest, I've been thinking a lot lately how Aidan was walking (well) by Christmas and we're almost to Christmas and she hadn't even taken a step. I don't want to push her to be good at the things her brother is good at, she's brilliant in her own myriad of ways. But it was nagging at me just a tiny bit. Aidan took his first step amazingly early at 9 1/2 months, he continued to walk only sporadically until I began sharing a nanny with my neighbors in November of his first year, and their daughter, 6 months older than Aidan, was just the peer pressure he needed to take off on foot. Ellie's been so good at crawling. She's been able to scramble up the big slide at our park for three months now. At one time I worried she wouldn't excel at crawling before moving on to walking because she wanted to be like Aidan so much. Kids who skip crawling or never really master it can sometimes be less coordinated athletically later because their brain didn't really get into that cross-action synapse firing. I knew how very athletic Aidan already is, so I didn't want Ellie to be less capable. She won't be! I've been wondering about our excitement at this event. It's really more than we felt when she spoke momom, dadad, or Aidan the first times. Maybe it's because we're with family here to get excited alongside us. I think every parent has a few favorite excelling abilities of their children that they like to boast. We've always been especially proud of the kids' early athletic ability. I think that's the biggest reason her first steps are such a big deal to us. We learned early on with Aidan, our first, that each trip we took would mean a significant development for him. It's still true today. The very different experiences, along with the increased attention and interaction with people, and probably the increased attention from John and me all team up to give the kids giant developmental boosts. The kids have prospered in this way so much from this trip already. Their verbal and physical skills alike are blooming.

 I haven't had a chance to write about this all week, but on Wednesday night Aidan was in his first ever Christmas pageant! He was the donkey that accompanied little Mary and Joseph to Bethlehem, and he was really the Best Donkey Ever! He stole the show because he was so very much younger than the other kids and he looked so adorable in his little donkey costume. My mom's a pastor here in El Paso and when we arrived last weekend she asked if Aidan would like to be in the pageant. I said sure, not thinking it would be anything too hard. It wasn't, in fact, it was so perfect for him that in addition to gymnastics, I'll probably be looking for a young theater troop to put him in this year! After the play he stayed on the stage playing all the other actor's parts. He'd stand on the tall stool like the narrator and talk in the mic, then he'd go to the lower mics that the little girl stars were at and talk in them. He _loved_ it. Not even 3 years old, and he's already a star! I hate to say it, but that alone was such a good experience that it is almost reason enough for us to swallow all our problems with organized religion and go to church!

 Time these days is running a little behind, and so I've found myself in mid-December realizing that we made it past November. November this year saw Ellie accomplish the milestone of 40 weeks old. It meant she has now spent more time outside of me than in, and in its strange way, that's a very sentimental and somewhat sad event for me. When I was pregnant each time, I wished away each week that brought me closer to term, but as soon as the baby was born I felt different. I wished I could push them back inside because they seemed so much safer there, and more intimately connected to me. Plus, we are especially aware with Ella that birth meant the giant explosion of growth and development, the all too rapid passage of the sweet infant stage, then the fun baby stage, and finally, the impressive toddling stage. With Aidan, we cheered the passage of each stage because we were so happy to see him progress, but now that we know how quickly those stages pass, we're a little less eager to see Ella progress. Not that we don't cheer her on, we do, and her cheering section includes Aidan. It just tears at my heart a little when she makes each leap. One anthropologist, Ashley Montagu, theorizes that human babies actually have an 18 month gestation time, and they, like kangaroos or possums, spend part of their gestation outside the womb. That explains why the human infant's brain development is so very dependent on being touched and carried womblike. After watching my children, I think this theory makes perfect sense. Last month Ellie really came out of herself. She's always been a watcher, but now she's very interactive with people and objects. Also, I realized after the fact that I instinctively began inching in childcare with each child when they were nine months old. The other thing about November passing was marking the anniversary of the death of our daughter Grace, who died before birth when I miscarried. A friend of ours shared that she had a difficult time each October because that's when her baby she miscarried last year would have been born. For us, the actual date that we lost our daughter, Grace, is the harder one. That November was such a nightmare. Work was an all-time difficult high for me, I got very sick with a nasty flu, and then I miscarried Grace. A week later our house was broken into and a few weeks after that, our car.

 So Santa brought the Feighery family verbal developments, and he came a little early. A few weeks ago we noticed for the first time Aidan making blatant, gross grammatical errors. Believe it or not, we celebrated this as the newest in Aidan's constant and impressive line of developments. When a child does this, it indicates they no longer parrot language, but instead their brain has acknowledged that language is made up of rules and begun experimenting with the application of those rules. He says things these days like "she gots a apple" and we couldn't be more tickled! Not wanting to be outdone by her brother's developments, Ella has experienced her own explosion. One of our favorite developmental writers is Dr. Stanley Greenspan. He measures development in his writing by the existence, frequency, and number of "back and forths" a child has. A back and forth is an exchange of communication. Until recently, Ella's back and forths have been primarily non-verbal, gesture or sign language based. Her verbal communication was primarily one sided, on her side. But now, she verbally responds to us. The first sign was last week's bye in response to the teacher's bye, and now everything you say to her is quickly replied to, even if we can't understand what it is she's replying!

 Aidan broke my heart this month when even more signs of boyhood took over toddlerhood. He now pronounces bumpy when he means bumpy, he always used to say grumpy. When we went to Europe this summer, John explained to him how the plane would feel when it took off, he said it's going to get a little bumpy now. Later Aidan told me his favorite part of flying was when it got a little grumpy. He would also say it when we crossed train tracks, oh! it got grumpy! not anymore. The train tracks are bumpy now. I've found wrapping presents with a nearly 3-year-old and 10-month-old to be an athletic challenge worthy of Olympic competition. Nobody should be surprised if their presents seem especially well taped this year, as taping is Aidan's job. Ellie's job, on the other hand, is crumpling. This morning Ellie actually waved and said bye all at the same time in response to someone waving and saying bye to her. She's been waving for a while, but usually about three minutes too late, and she talks her own version of English, but this was the first time I've seen it all come together in a way someone other than John or I could interpret. Of course, once she figured that out, it was all she wanted to do. As we left Aidan's school she was a veritable beauty queen waving to everyone and saying bye. Yesterday we were out shopping--yeah! I finished all my shopping--the super marathon of five stores in a row, and everywhere I went there were other mothers who couldn't believe how well Ellie was sitting quietly in the cart as I shopped. I was pretty proud of her. Target was the last store I hit, and by then she was getting hungry and a little bored with the wonder of shopping so I strolled by the toy isle and picked out a little wind-up music plush toy for her to hold through the store. She's at an age where such a thing doesn't have consequences, I'd never dare that with Aidan for fear he'd expect it always. Anyway, I realized as I was walking to my car that she still had it! I've turned my daughter into a clepto! I walked back inside and handed it to the customer service guy and said I'm sorry we walked out with this. He was so shocked that I gave it back. All he could say was thank you.

 Yesterday Aidan yelled at his teachers and got into trouble, then he wouldn't apologize so he had to sit by himself for a while. In context, I understand that this was bound to happen because he's been pretty reactive lately. His brain is all over the place and he's very hyper. I've put off dealing with it directly because I thought whatever progress I might make will be completely undone by Christmas. This was a mistake, I should have nipped it in the bud. When we get home from picking Aidan up at school, I often let the kids watch Dora the Explorer. Not always, but often. So yesterday when we got home I gave Ellie a bagel and sat her in front of Dora (admittedly with the volume up a bit) and took Aidan into his bedroom for a talk. I sat him in his chair and explained that he couldn't watch Dora today because he didn't behave at school. Before I could even get the words out, he burst into tears! He was sobbing giant sorrowful cries, promising to be nice the teachers and never yell at them again. I hugged him and rocked him and he calmed down. But then he thought it was all past us and wanted to go watch Dora. I tried again to explain that today he could not watch Dora, but tomorrow, if he behaved at school, he could. Again giant sobs and sorrow. I felt awful. He was genuinely sorry and he couldn't figure out why being so sorry wasn't making things better. By this time I was really questioning myself and I called John at work (I'd already briefed him on the phone as I drove home) to see if he thought I was bordering unfair. He backed me up, said I was doing the perfect thing and shouldn't stop. So for the entirety of Dora (10 or 15 minutes after our talk was over) Aidan had to play in his room without watching Dora. The episode seems to have curbed his craze a little in general. I can't wait until we get the responsibilities chart (for Christmas). That's the style of rewards and loss of priveledges that inspired my punishment yesterday and Aidan responded to it very well. I've been planning chores and duties like feeding the cat and cleaning his room, but I'd overlooked the priveledges until yesterday. John said we should organize his toys on the shelves in his room (there are five shelves) according to the chart's levels so he gets the specialest ones when he behaves best. I thought that was a great idea. Currently they're organized, by default, according to how much parental involvement they require. His favorite games like play doh and the toughest puzzles end up highest, but we shouldn't really do it that way. That encourages everyone to dumb down his play.

 yesterday morning John took Aidan to Target to buy Christmas lights and other supplies and leave me to some quiet by myself since Ellie was due for a good long morning nap. They left and I nursed her to sleep, she gave a little fuss, but I stroked her hairline with my fingernails, the secret trick with her, and she dropped off. I put her in her crib and began to enjoy my alone time. I was just putting some books away, about twenty minutes after she fell asleep when she awoke. I was so frustrated! All week I've been holding out for the weekend to get some time to myself, and here we were finally at Saturday and it still sucked! Back in my arms, Ellie fell right back to sleep. I tried to put her back down and she awoke right away. I tried stroking her hairline, from the part outwards, to no avail. She was still really sleepy, too sleepy to just be awake and play, but she refused to sleep out of my arms. I decided to try to find some way to still have a nice morning, so I sat on the couch, put on HBO and watched a movie with Ellie in my arms, sleeping through it all. I watched Nell, it was a nice movie. Very interesting theories about family modeling. Weak ending though. John and Aidan came home near the movies' end. We had planned on getting so much accomplished, but the cards just weren't falling for us. John put Aidan down for a nap and we watched another movie!

 urlLink The Guardian published a fantastic, easily navigable guide to primary schools' performance and ratings.

 Ellie been in a bad funk lately regarding naps. She would nap for about 30-45 minutes around 10 in the morning, and then not nap at all until around 5 pm when she would take another real short one. Finally, this morning she slept over 2 hours! I hope this is normal and she's returning to it. I was so spoiled for so long with Aidan. He would take three naps a day, each for at least an hour and a half, often for three hours. That's how I was able to work so well with him next to me for so long. Around 9 months, he dropped to two naps, and I put him in pre-school for part of my work day to compensate. I hoped he would keep taking 2 naps until kindergarten, like I did as a kid, but this time last year he dropped to one. Now he takes one long nap every day, 2 hours long if he's at school, as much as 3 if he's at home.

 urlLink Mothering Magazine -- The Science of Mother Love : "According to Alan Schore, assistant clinical professor in the department of psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences at UCLA School of Medicine, a major conclusion of the last decade of developmental neuroscience research is that the infant brain is designed to be molded by the environment it encounters.1 In other words, babies are born with a certain set of genetics, but they must be activated by early experience and interaction. Schore believes the most crucial component of these earliest interactions is the primary caregiver - the mother. 'The child's first relationship, the one with the mother, acts as a template, as it permanently molds the individual's capacities to enter into all later emotional relationships.' Others agree. The first months of an infant's life constitute what is known as a critical period - a time when events are imprinted in the nervous system. 'Hugs and kisses during these critical periods make those neurons grow and connect properly with other neurons.' Says Dr. Arthur Janov, in his book Biology of Love. 'You can kiss that brain into maturity.' "

 urlLink Mothering Magazine -- Pillow Talk: Helping your Child Get a Good Night's Sleep : "The subject of child sleep is of interest not only to parents but also to scientists. Entire medical conferences are organized around the fascinating subject of sleep. Medical journals regularly publish the latest scientific data on child sleep. Unfortunately, not all 'scientific' studies on sleep are correct, and not all self-appointed sleep experts give accurate, child-nurturing information. Too often, cultural biases regarding sleep predominate over genuine biological facts. Many of the so-called 'sleep problems' that parents report in their children are actually the result of rigid and unreasonable expectations that are based on unnatural and unrealistic myths about how children are supposed to be."

 urlLink Personal Health: Antidotes for Poisons Are Just a Phone Call Away : "What should you do when a child may have swallowed something poisonous? Call the Poison Control Center, (800) 222-1222. This number, which will connect to the center serving your phone exchange nearly everywhere in the 50 states, should be posted next to every home telephone and carried in wallets. Poison Control centers are staffed 24/7 by full-time trained staff members, who can tell exactly what to do, if anything, when someone has, or may have, been exposed to a toxic substance. Whatever you do, do not try to make the child vomit unless told to do so by a poison control specialist.

 I found out last night that my sister is expecting a baby! I'm so excited for her. I can't believe I have a new family member coming!

 This is why real parenting is so much funnier than fiction. Of course, Gwen's a writer, so this will probably make it into fiction soon.

 last week we were traveling through the various regions of the Southwest, we drove to Santa Fe, then Taos, back to Santa Fe, then on to El Paso and back home again. The kids enjoyed the trips, Aidan watched a jillion movies in the car, and pointed to a jillion cows and trains between movies. This was the first trip that we didn't have to make any stops specifically for Ella. I crawled in the back and did my lean over her and nurse stunt a few times, but all in all she was pretty content to stare at Aidan (or me via her fisheye mirror) or play with toys. Just outside Quanah between Vernon and Amarillo is a reststop with a giant playground that we always stop at. Last time we stopped Aidan was just at the cusp of being able to reach the monkey bars, and by this time he could reach. This was the first time we've stopped there that Ella was old enough to play around on it too. She climbed the stairs and crawled across the wobbly bridge, she climbed up the slides and slid back down backwards. That's a trick she's mastered at our own park here, she climbs up the slide on her hands and feet, then puts her knees down and picks her feet up and leans forward and she slides back down backwards (she has to be wearing pants for it to work). Her face lights up so bright when she does it, you have to laugh out loud. The Kit Carson park in Taos is also a very nice park. We took the kids there when the sub-zero temps finally subsided on Friday. A couple of grandparents were also there, taking their three young grandsons to the park. I got to talking with the grandmother. She said she'd raised three boys, and now she has three grandsons. I couldn't believe it, I said how do you raise three boys! I've got one and it's all I can do! She laughed and explained that she raised them in southern Colorado where they could just run wild and free all the time. I was pretty envious, since I know from staying at the Earthships how nice it is to say go outside and play for a while, Aidan. But she also shared some golden, well articulated advice with me. She said you have to let them get hurt a lot on the small things, or else they'll grow up thinking they can't get hurt and they'll get hurt on the big things. As we talked, a couple struggled to slow down their one-year-old's trip down what was clearly his first slide, the mom eventually just couldn't handle the perceived danger and turned him over on his stomach so he was more stable and she could hold onto him better. It was timely. During the trip, Ella got the first big stomach flu we've seen as parents. She couldn't keep a thing down, even breastmilk, for about 30 hours straight. For luck, I had bought a fantastic book just two days before she got sick that offers conventional,herbal, and homeopathic remedies for childhood illness. I sent John into town to buy herbs and roots--Taos is a great place to get sick if you have to! I made a ginger tea and mixed it with pure apple unsweetened apple juice and she was able to keep that down. That was her only source of hydration for almost a day. Then, as the stomach part progressed to intestinal gas and cramping, I made a tea of thyme, peppermint, anise, and fennel, again mixed with juice to make it pallatable enough for her to drink. All of us only got the second part and we drank the same tea to rid ourselves of the sulfer gas and gastrointestinal upset. It worked so well! The book is called Smart Medicine for a Healthier Child , I'll be reviewing it formally soon.



 In this day and age of internet parent controls and no-TV households, I'm so pleased to see a positive example of a parent who embraced our culture for the benefits it can offer! File this under D for Don't Censor your Children! urlLink MomintheMirror : "I really resisted when Colter wanted a Game Boy and then a GameCube, but now I'm so glad we allowed him both (paid for with his own money). He got a Game Boy when he was 5 and the GameCube when he was 6. They've stoked his imagination and, perhaps more importantly, his desire to collaborate. He sometimes plays them alone, but more often he plays them with friends, and most often he plays them with Gary (who was given his own Game Boy system as a gift from Colter, so that they could link up and share Pokemon). Colter reads very detailed guide books so that he can proceed to the next level in various games, and he is so satisfied as his abilities grow. I realize they're not what most people would consider educational, and yet Colter has developed some really important social, emotional, and creative skills from this type of play. Plus, they've been a great way for he and Gary to bond. "

 Some things seem too difficult to blog. Last night, as I closed the day with a few hours of research (see below), I thought about blogging the day's events and I just couldn't bring myself to do it. Maybe people who have tons of kids and have been through many kid-traumas would laugh at my emotions, but if they do, I'm sorry time and experience have hardened them to the point that a crying child doesn't break their heart. Enough of the drama. What happened? Aidan fell at school. He wasn't doing anything daring or crazy, just either walking by the stairs or down the stairs (it's difficult to interpret the story from him and nobody saw it) and tripped. He seems to have taken the full blow of the fall on his upper lip, and his teeth. All of his top teeth. From K-9 to K-9. Half the teeth were pushed back to about a 45 degree angle, and the other half were pushed up by about 10 to 20 percent of the crown, from what I can tell. He bled _a lot_, but remarkably, there was no cut in the lip itself, just severe tissue trauma. I was most of my way through the grocery store with an overflowing cart when his pre-school called. When they call me, they're always careful to immediately say, "Mrs. Feighery, this is so and so. Nothing is wrong, there is no emergency, I'm just calling to discuss [insert bland issue like party planning here]." Not this time. They said is this Annie Feighery, and this is so and so calling regarding your son so I knew something was wrong so I just said yes impatiently over and over until the woman got on with it. They explained the injury and asked if they could begin giving him Tylenol for the pain and I said no, just give him ice. I think this took them back, most parents would just want to stop any pain right? I didn't even know if tylenol was a better course of pain reliever than ibuprofen yet. Maybe I want to focus on relieving swelling? Mostly, I wanted to examine his symptoms exactly as they were myself, rather than not knowing how bad it had initially been. Also, I read in one of my books recently that in the event of traumatic injury, it's best not to treat it if the child can stand it until the doctor examines the child. I know this is strange, but my biggest immediate decision was whether to check out or leave my cart. By then, John was on the phone b/c his number is also on the emergency call list and he was saying just leave (remember that John is in California on training right now). My dad was with me and he pointed out that there weren't any lines. So he checked out and I went for the car and once I got Ellie in and drove up front, he was out waiting for me. The triviality of Whole Foods behind me, I had to decide what to do with Aidan right away. I called my pediatrician's office and had him paged. He called me right back within like one minute. Let's just say this here because it bears repeating. I love Dr. Hubert Ho. He's a fantastic physician. If you live in Houston, and you have medical values that fall somewhere between trusting western medicine for its emergency response, but trusting the body and homoeopathy for prevention and maintenance, he's your guy. Anyway, en route from Whole Foods to the school, I discussed Aidan's apparent condition with him. My first questions were hectic and wild, like "should I take him to Texan's Children's ER or to a pediadontist?" (I don't have one, not even a dentist for John or me) Then I thought better of my questioning after a second and said, "Do I need to take him anywhere at all?" And Doctor Ho said no. That was a beautiful moment for me. I was able to set aside the anxious response to what I'd heard over the phone, which included "you probably want to come get him and take him to a doctor or dentist right away" and begin to evaluate the situation before responding. Dr. Ho said whatever damage to the teeth, including damage to the roots or permanent teeth underneath, that could be, is already there. He said the teeth that are pushed back (at that point I didn't, nor did anyone else, realize any were pushed up) will either fall out or solidify in their sockets, and little could affect that. I asked him about worst case scenarios and he said maybe one of the teeth is against a nerve and could require a root canal, but we'll know that in the next days, there was no advantage in having the asap x-ray to determine that. I asked him if I should expect a great deal of pain, if I should preempt the pain with tylenol. He said when it comes to injuries, young children often tolerate them with very little pain, especially compared to what an adult in a similar situation would feel. He said to watch Aidan for signs he was in pain, but until then, just give him ice and soft foods. He did mention that since Aidan is three now, it's time to get him a dental check-up anyway, so I should take him to a dentist soon. By the time I was at Aidan's school, I was off the phone with Dr. Ho and feeling much more calm. Aidan was sitting on his teacher's lap sucking on ice. They'd hidden his overshirt from my sight so I didn't see all the blood, but his undershirt and pants still had some blood on them and his mouth was still bleeding quite a bit. Thankfully, blood doesn't bother me like it does a lot of people I know. I didn't even look at his mouth. I just hugged him and listened to the director and teacher, then left. I just wanted to get him home and soothe him. At home I made him some chamomile tea, massaged his little body quickly with essential oil lotion, and put him to bed to sleep next to his papa. By the time he woke up the swelling had seriously set in, and my little boy's face was difficult to recognize. His top lip is about three times its normal width, and the swelling in his lower nose bridge pushes his nostrils up a little so it looks like his nose curls at the tip a bit. His eyes were sunken a little, with dark circles under them. And of course, once he opens his mouth, his once-perfect teeth look just awful. Meanwhile in California... John was feeling terrible being so far away. Our close little family is firmly based on attachment parenting values, in a way, we are borg. We feel and experience everything together, only John wasn't with us to feel and experience everything. He felt like his boy really needed him and a silly training was hardly worth not being there for his son. I didn't know what to tell him. Because my dad was here visiting, in truth I had taking care of the kids covered. But I knew exactly what John was going through. I called his parents to weigh in on the subject, who felt like there will be lots of traumas in the kids' lives and if John wants to be the kind of dad who goes to space, then he needs to stay in California. In the end, their advice we ended up taking was to give it a day to see how everyone fared. After his nap I was gently probing everything, seeing just how loose everything was. That's when I realized the damage was to all the front teeth, not just the ones that were pushed back. While he was asleep I'd read up on tooth damage in four separate books, and felt pretty confident about my decision to not rush him to the dentist. But this further damage really made me question myself. What if he loses every top front tooth? It will be four three, maybe four years before he has teeth again! It wasn't just that. At this point I was about five or six hours after the accident, and my tough guy, supermom routine was really falling apart. I hated that this horrible thing happened to my boy. And where was my husband to just hug me and tell me it will all be ok! I buried myself into online research until I was satisfied that we really were on the best track, somewhere around midnight. I still felt like my heart was breaking into pieces. I no longer felt secure about any decision I'd made from having Aidan in preschool to buying him new shoes a few days ago (that were small replicas of dad's new Sketchers) that probably contributed to the fall. I finally took his clothes out of the plastic garbage bag to soak the blood out and that was amazingly emotional. Looking at all that blood, I just felt terrible for my little boy, that this happened to him, that my arms hadn't been there to catch him. And I felt very alone, with no one who understood my doubts or pains. I curled up in bed with Aidan and fell asleep cuddling with him. This morning his teeth were a little more secure in their sockets, and the pushed back teeth were even a little forward, up to only 15 or so degrees off. I'm not sure they'll improve more than this, but at least maybe they'll stay in? The lodged up ones are the teeth that really scare me. They could take two to four months to drop, or else they'll gray and die, or cause a pulp infection and require dental extraction. I'm watching for abscesses, but his lip is far more swollen than the gums. We're in the giant hunt for soft foods Aidan likes. I've also got a good list of foods from my books that promote dental healing. Sea vegetables and calcium foods are best. He loves kale in tofu, thankfully! Also blueberries, which I mixed into a smoothie with yogurt and papaya to boost his immune. We still don't know about John's training. His boss said he could come home either for the weekend or for good, it's up to him. That's great news for me, but waiting until tomorrow to see him will be hard. Aidan still hasn't required a pain reliever at all. I've done my best to soothe him with lavender baths and teas. He's such a trooper. Everyone keeps saying he's taking it like a champ. Whew! What a long post this is. I'm sorry, but writing it all down has been extremely cathartic. Like writing the birth stories. I'm glad I got it all down, I'll keep you posted with updates.

 urlLink Medicdirect - Comprehensive UK Health Information : "Milk Teeth (Deciduous or Primary Teeth) The bones of very young children are quite soft and 'plastic'. If a child falls on to a baby tooth then, instead of breaking the tooth itself, it is often just moved in the bone and loosened. Occasionally it may be pushed up into the gum like the 2-year-old child shown in this photograph (figure 1). Usually, no treatment is required but is a sensible idea to take your child to the dentist so that your child's mouth can be checked. " urlLink This is the link to emedicine's take on tooth injury . These guys are always thick in jargon, but very thorough. Similarly thick with jargon, urlLink this is a dentist to dentist paper on treatment options for tooth injury. Ended up being exactly what I was seeking. The page is out of the UK, published in 1999. "The proximity of the root of the primary incisor to the crown of its permanent successor means that, when a primary tooth is injured, there is significant potential for damage to the permanent successor. In many cases damage to the permanent tooth takes place at the time of injury and the ability to limit damage by some form of intervention is minor."

 urlLink Pediatric Oncall- Dental injuries and trauma : Any injury to the child’s primary tooth has the potential to damage the developing permanent one, especially if the damage occurs before age 3. This is why it is important to report any such injury promptly to the child’s dentist. The permanent top central incisors begin mineralization at birth, and takes about 3 years to completely form .If during this critical time the root of a primary tooth is pushed into the crown of the developing permanent, a defect may develop in the permanent tooth. Don’t be surprised then, if the pediatric dentist recommends removing the primary tooth following an injury to an infant’s tooth. If removal may help prevent infection or injury to the developing permanent tooth, the dentist is likely to advise this treatment- even if it makes the parents feel guilty and unhappy. Loss of a top front tooth in a child under 3 generally does not affect speech, growth patterns, or psychological development. Children are generally not tooth conscious until 5 or 6 years of age. And by that time all their friends are losing their front teeth anyway.

 As one might gleam from reading my notes on car seat research, we're in the market. Ellie's outgrowing her little infant carrier seat, and while I agree with most research that says not to turn them around until their height mandates it, I am ready to move her into a rear facing/front facing convertible seat. These seats offer more support, and actually fit in smaller cars more correctly (counterintuitive, I know, because they're actually bigger). Car seats seem to evolve quickly these days since parents control such a huge amount of capitol, and safety sells. I'm not complaining, though. I skimped a little on safety regarding the size of my car for the sake of our sustainable values, so I feel like I'm making up for that just a bit when I look into the safest car seats. Aidan's RF/FF convertible that he is now outgrowing (you can tell b/c his shoulders are at the same height as the highest strap outlet) is already outdated two years after we bought it. So we're in a position to buy two new car seats at a whopping cost of $320. Two new trends have emerged in car seat safety that threaten to outdate any seat I buy. One is the protective wings concept, where the sides come further up to protect from debris from a crunched car hitting the baby's head. This also gives the baby more of a ledge to lean his or her head against while sleeping. The other trend is making the part of the car seat that surrounds the head out of the plastic material long used for bike helmets. I guess you could call it a third trend, but it's just a fact that wasn't publicized enough until recently, but these days parents are told to turn the baby to front facing when their legs can no longer fit rear facing, or when they exceed 30 pounds. The idea behind that is that only 5% of all crashes are from the rear, so the vast majority of crashes produce forward momentum, which is best handled by the backbone, the strongest part of the body. It used to be widely said, and still is by those who don't research, to turn your baby around at one year and 20 pounds. Turns out this is just the legal minimum, not the gold standard for safety. After all I looked into, the Brittax Roundabout appears to be the RF/FF convertible with the best mix of upmost safety and adequately small for my little VW back seat. For Aidan, I will probably move him up to the Cosco Summit High Back Booster. One more link to share.

 we're sitting at home watching NASA Select, hoping for a safe landing for Mars' newest visitor, the rover named Opportunity. Moments ago, the little robot separated from its mama ship, on which it had traveled from Earth to Martian orbit. After separation, the two decend together toward the surface of Mars. But because the mothership isn't protected by a heatshield, much less equipped with airbags for landing, it will soon meet a firey end while the little rover Opportunity will continue on to what we all hope is a bright future of exploration and discovery. Isn't that the perfect analogy for the very nature of parenting? This mama ship traveled a hundred million miles just to give its baby that final nudge into history. Aside from the discriptor "cruise stage," the mama ship didn't even have a name. And that's how progress works. If we do nothing else to help our spieces, we're working to help our babies help the species. God speed, Opportunity!

 I'm so proud of my baby girl! This morning she said "anana" when John handed her a banana. It's her first three-syllable word! Incidentally, banana was Aidan's as well, only it took him months to discover the first syllable "ba." He said "nana" instead. Eleanor did the same with bagel since she was five months old. She'd say "BA!" for bagel, I don't think she's said that one right yet. Her first clear two-syllable word was Aidan (after the necessary mama and dada). Isn't it silly to count the syllables she's capable of saying? It's the only way I have left to measure her verbal accomplishments, though! Between Aidan and Ellie's first year I read Elise Eliot's What's Going on in There: How the Brain and Mind Develop in the First Five Years of Life , and my approach to language therefore was vastly different for the two of them. Poor Aidan, he's always the guinea pig! Eliot's chapter on verbal development is a pleasure to read because it's so amazingly informative and full of easily applicable advice. She explains that as soon as birth your child is trying to communicate with you. We parents are admonished by family or friends attempting wit to not think every noise and gesture is a big accomplishment, but for infants, it truly is. Eliot says their tiny brains are like little scientists conducting experiment after experiment. They do something, and if it works, they do it again and again. They smile and if you give them a smile back, they'll smile more. Therefore, mirroring your infants every attempt at communication from each little babble to every flailing gesture is fantastic for their development. In doing this with Ellie I found, as Eliot said I would, a clear early pattern to her babbles. By the time she was four months old I was able to discern her babbles for Aidan from toy and from "nanas," or want to nurse. I don't think this necessarily accelerated her verbal development in annunciation terms, but it clearly gave her a sense of confidence in communicating and that positive reaction to the brain's little experiments should encourage her to love learning new developments in many other ways. This is where the real excitement begins. Language really takes off between 12 and 18 months, when Ellie will strive to get to that magic 50 mark. For whatever reason, that's the average number of words a child knows when he or she hits an amazing explosion. Again, Elise Eliot: "Most toddlers' vocabulary explodes once they can say about four dozen words. Now they start adding one, two, or three new words every day, and their receptive vocabulary--the number of words a child understands--grows even more quickly. Between two and six, children are estimated to learn the meaning of a staggering eight words a day. That comes out to more than one new word every two hours they're awake, and they continue at this rate into elementary school years. By the time a child is six, it's been estimated that he understands some 13,000 words, although he doesn't speak nearly that many." So here's Ellie's vocabulary as best as I can interpret so far: mama, dada, aidan, bagel, cat, papa, nana/baba (grandma), car, look, nanas (which means nurse), uh-oh, bye-bye, hi, more, *and today's exciting addition!* banana

 Renee over at urlLink Like a Baby along with Lisa at urlLink Coley's Blog both speak of recently weaning their wee ones. Renee's Chloe is 13 months old and Lisa weaned Coleen at 6 months. I for one aspire to breastfeed my Ellie _forever_. Please know that I won't be one of those nursing my seven year old moms, this is all in jest. My primary motivation for nursing forever is that I love the size of my breasts. Like Samantha on Sex and the City said after breast cancer threatened her beauties (sorry to be the spoiler if you've fallen behind in episodes this season), "they're pretty fabulous!" Typically, when I lose weight, my face thins a lot between the size 11 and 9 markers. Then, when nearing that coveted size 7, I lose the breasts. But not now! I'm nearing my goal and I'm still a ample C cup, and not that urlLink cheating nearly C you see on ads, either! After I wean, I'll go back to my natural B cup, or maybe I'll claim a nearly C just so I can have a bra that says C, but the breasts after weaning just feel so empty! It's like devoid of their prior mana, they're just a little sad. Every baby has their little dips in interest in the big nunie at several points in the first few years. When they take a developmental leap, these dips tend to show up, but they're also famous for appearing at 9 and 12 months. I think it was around 16 months that Aidan's interest in nursing was waning and I was preparing a trip out of town (to DC for the protests, when we conceived our beautiful Ella!) sans Aidan. So I stopped offering the breast to him, and he was such a busy toddler by then that he didn't think to request it so often. It was a pretty gentle transition. The worst of it was the first time he got a cold after I weaned him, and I didn't have that breast to make everything instantly better. I also missed that close reconnect that can be so illusive with a toddler, especially with a toddler boy. My friend Alina is pregnant with her second child and therefore is trying to wean her first. He's about 14 months old, but his interest in the breast is still pretty strong. I told her I'd read in several sources (I'll find them to link later) that breast milk changes taste around the sixth month, thus encouraging the older baby to wean him/herself in time for the critical growth period of the third trimester, the only time that a pregnant mom's body might not want to divert energy to the nursing baby. After Alina goes through it, I'll check back with her for her experience of the whole affair. Interesting, though, if she doesn't wean during her pregnancy, or if her son has a relapse when he sees his new sibling nursing, I've been reading in Dr. Sears' the Successful Child , that nursing together is a fantastic way to promote bonding between two young siblings that are otherwise too developmentally young to understand your other encouragements to bond. If nature can accommodate nursing twins, I'm quite certain nature can accommodate nursing a toddler and infant as well. Up until a month ago, I literally felt like nursing Ella forever. I felt so instinctive about how much she needed me. But lately, that feeling is a little less intense. I think it's a natural effect of her growing up. When you parent by instinct, it's such a paint by numbers feeling. You see the picture emerge as you respond to your body and your baby. The truth is I have no idea how long I'll nurse my baby girl. I'm just feeling my way along. I'll go as long as is mutually needed. Up until this month I thought that would for sure be until she's at least two. These days, though, she has me wondering!

 Earlier this year I found an entirely different benefit to seaweed. I began meditating on it in response to people or situations that made me feel crazed. Some people were coming into my life like a tornado with their patronizing or agist comments, their guilt trips, or just their multitude of dramas, and I was getting caught up in it every time! So I developed a visual on which I would meditate when their voices or words caused that nervous feeling deep in my chest. I imagined myself as seaweed rooted securely in the ocean floor, swaying in the gentle movements of the ocean deep. Every now and then, a giant wave passes over me, and it may even be strong enough to muddy my ocean deep waters, but I am rooted, so those waves can roll on by, causing nothing more than a little sway in my beautiful, graceful tendrils. Anyway, urlLink Lisa's found a somewhat more applied use for this urlLink generous autotroph in recuperation from her c-section. urlLink cadence90 : "Seaweed. That's what I've got packing my incision at the moment. Unfortunately for me, my incision came partially open, and since it wouldn't heal that way, I had to have it opened and cleaned. And then I had it packed with seaweed, what with a little gauze on top. It's a good thing I am a nerd and can be amused by stuff like alginate wound dressings, which use the medicinal and antiseptic properties of seaweed to help people heal. Otherwise this would not be funny at all!"

 like it or not, this post goes on this blog since parenting draws a domestic crowd. If there was a Nobel Prize for cleaning, this week it would be mine. I've discovered the secret to cleaning porcelain bath tups: liquid dishwasher soap! My mom taught me long ago that this was the trick for cleaning stains out of white kitchen sinks, and since we bought this old house nearly four years ago I haven't quite known how to clean up the claw-foot tup. Finally, I put the two together. It's so pretty and white! And, by utter fluke, I actually had the honor of being the first bather in the tub after I cleaned it! That's a real rarity when a family of four shares one bathroom.

 This morning I woke up and I had a one year old and a three year old! Suddenly I'm the mother of a toddler and a boy, after being the mother of a baby and a toddler for so long! I know it's only semantics, but I get caught up in these identities. My little baby girl isn't little or a baby anymore. These past few weeks she's gone through quite a growth spurt, so literally, she isn't that little anymore! I can't believe she's only been here for a year. It feels like she's always been a part of our lives. In an abstract way, I think she has, but when I recall memories from two or three years ago, my mind actually inserts Ellie into my arms, or instead I think what did I do with Ellie when I did that? And then I have to remember she wasn't born yet! Her birthday means it's almost been a year since the Columbia accident, and I can't believe it's been a year since that either. The strain of recovering was more difficult than I could have imagined, but we made it! Things will never be the same, and they shouldn't be, but in so many ways, these things have changed for the better. I feel like NASA, John, and our family are stronger and have a clearer vision of where we want to go. Part of me will always feel a little twinge of pain when I recall that John never had a real paternity leave with his baby girl, he missed so many of her days. But his love was always there. I think when she's old enough to explain it to, she will be happy that her dad chose to help save the Space Station at the expense of extra special time with her. Having said that, it's been a year, and the emergency procedures are over. It's time for all of us to get back to focusing on the family alongside career pursuits. She needs her daddy home. I don't think nature watches the calendar, but it does seem that my body and hers both feel the change. I feel my instincts pulling away from her, and I see her setting up her own little identity separate from me. I don't rush to her to aide every little unhappiness anymore. I don't even nurse her as often. It's the first stages of her becoming a child rather than my baby. Eventually, she'll be self sufficient, just as her brother is now. She'll go to the bathroom on her own, eat on her own, sleep on her own. This is how it begins. A month ago that thought would have made me very sad. But now I feel such a peace with it. It's what she needs, and it's time.

 How did I get two days past his birthday, without having a moment to reflect? Well, for starters I drank two martinis on a holiday afternoon with my husband, which collectively sucked away much of yesterday. In addition, Aidan's at what I hope is the tail end of the week o'fever virus Ellie had last week. Poor guy was sick on his birthday! All he had said he wanted to do for his special day was go ride the train, but when the day arrived alongside a (albeit meek, we're in the south) cold front, I manipulated his little mind (yes, they're still malleable at three!) to not remember wanting that. It's not that I didn't think he should be outside. On the contrary, sunlight and light activity can do wonders for the immune system, but it was icky cold, and he didn't even want to go ride his scooter, so I saved him from the disappointment of remembering and not wanting the desired thing. Anyway, back on key, this virus requires much holding and cuddling, so I didn't get much writing time for me. In a way, that in itself is an appropriate comment on this occasion which celebrates the three accomplished years of life outside the womb. For truly the biggest lesson I've learned on this bumpy (in the exciting way... almost always) road is to not be chinchy with the love, physical and emotional. Sometimes I've felt like I really needed a break where no one would touch me, but those times were usually brief, and afterward I filled myself up with baby love all over again. I feel like I know now why Jesus made love the cornerstone of his message to the world (of course, it makes me all the sadder to realize almost every religion resulting from his message misses this boat). The rule adicts of his day couldn't wait to ask such an amazing person which rule was his favorite, and all he said was love. Love each other, love God, love love love. On this occasion, which for me celebrates my existence in this world as a mother, I have to say having children taught me to love like I never thought my heart capable. I've come to think pregnancies depart your body by giving you a personal gift. Drastically new experiences build fresh synapses in your brain, so maybe on a biological level, this wild new ride actually opens up a new part of your brain to you. Whatever it is, I found that each of my three pregnancies left something special for just me. The gift of Aidan's pregnancy was dancing. Never in my life had I felt comfortable dancing. I think it's the white girl syndrome. Never could let loose and swing around my body with abandon. I grew up country dancing, two stepping, because that had rules. You knew what you were supposed to do on each beat. And slow dancing was ok because you just hug and sway. But really dancing like at a disco never came to me until I had Aidan. And then, when he was just a few days old, I found myself holding him and dancing like a fool! I didn't care what I looked like anymore, I just loved the feeling of the music wrapping me up and carrying me around the room! The letting go for dancing is really symbolic for letting go in many ways. I've since found myself much happier with myself, regardless of how silly I might look dancing! My sweet Grace, who died in my first trimester, left me creativity unleashed. After a lifetime of being a writer, I found myself really writing. And when Ella left my body, I found myself singing! Not just lullaby songs in the dark, but wailing loud singing through the house. I've since sung to the kids almost every day. I don't know many songs, so I make them up most of the time, and they love it! Each gift not only made me a better mother, but left me a better person. It's just another way that Mother Nature, or the Universe, or God, or whoever you need to credit, really got this motherhood thing down right. Every part of the system works, if you can only let go and let it. It's so beautiful! Back to Aidan, he's such a work of art. In just three years, he's already a pro at being an Earthling. He's fluent in our culture, adept at using his body, gravity is no challenge for this guy. Our culture can fool me into believing me he really needs me until he's 18, but I can tell he's pretty much OK on his independent little own (as long as I'm within easy distance to run back and hug between accomplishments!) already. I've always thought, and recently was pleased to hear someone else say it independently, that Aidan (originally John, but now his boy) looked like Michaelangelo's David. He's the perfect model human. Thin and tall, while sculpted and muscular. Slightly wavy hair that frames a fine bone visage. Penetrating eyes that follow gracefully the movement of each delicate, long finger. He's naturally amiable, if a little competitive (my fault). He loves to cuddle with anyone he can catch (and he's so fast that that's pretty much everyone). He's the ultimate little man. Like every mom, I'm so humbled at this perfection and beauty with which I've been entrusted. I can't believe the wonderful creation God put in my womb to develop into this amazing creature. If I do nothing else in life, at least my children leave me with hope that I've done something to make this little planet a better place to live. Their purity encourages me at my darkest moment that life is intrinsically good, and that that good will somehow outweigh all the bad. The laugh of my little boy, the smile of my darling girl could inspire enemies to stop fighting, even to beat their weapons into plowshares so each little boy and darling girl can live without hunger... And btw, this only sounds silly if you've never held a new baby in your arms and gazed deep into their eyes, so new, so freshly arrived from that spiritual side of existence. If only we open ourselves up to them, babies can change everything. I guess in conclusion, I have to thank God for Aidan's spirit, my husband for his great sperm and loving fatherhood, and Aidan for being so fun. I have a great son. I'm so proud of him. And I love being his mom. I rarely feel sad that he's growing up so fast, because I'm so very excited about what development he'll tackle next! These three years have been wonderful beyond my wildest hopes. I wonder what his forth year has in store for us!

 Does anyone remember the "no direct evidence of bodily harm" memo congress used to fry tobacco? urlLink Today's Observer shines the light on the Bush admin's tactics in support of what's coming to be called Big Sugar. Allow me to highlight: "'Obesity rates have risen so that now one in three Americans bears the burden of the very high health risks associated with this condition, with the poorest and most vulnerable worst affected,' he says. 'Obesity rates among American children have risen by 50 per cent.' Norum is the most senior scientist involved in an attempt to formulate a worldwide policy to fight heart disease and diabetes resulting from a junk food diet. An estimated 60 per cent of disease worldwide is now due to cardiovascular illness, which causes 47 per cent of deaths. The letter from Norum will put Bush under intense pressure at home to show that he is serious about tackling the epidemic. More than half of all Americans are overweight, and in some states, including Bush's Texas, nearly one-third of the population is classified obese. The President insists fighting fat is a matter for the individual, not the state. But today The Observer reveals how he and fellow senators have received hundreds of thousands of dollars in funding from 'Big Sugar'. One of his main fundraisers is sugar baron Jose 'Pepe' Fanjul, head of Florida Crystals, who has raised at least $100,000 for November's presidential re-election campaign. Norum's letter is an angry response to the Americans' decision to submit a 30-page report, criticising the WHO strategy for its lack of sound scientific evidence. It will be discussed at a key meeting of its executive board in Geneva on Tuesday. The Bush administration, which receives millions in funding from the sugar industry, argues there is little robust evidence to show that drinking sugary drinks or eating too much sugar is a direct cause of obesity. It particularly opposes a recommendation that just 10 per cent of people's energy intake should come from added sugar. The US has a 25 per cent guideline."

 maybe a good way to use the kids' close birthdays is to get them both a larger, slightly more costly gift together. Sort of an infrastructure-building opportunity. Of course you have to know why I'm thinking this. I could build a climbing wall in their room and make it their collective birthday present! I've spent the last little bit online looking into it, and it wouldn't be that expensive. Depending on which brand I pick, and the number of handholds I want, urlLink REI offers some nice packages . One wall of the kids' room is drywall-covered shiplap, so it would be easy to anchor them. I could do it in the corner, and include urlLink this cute climbing bar from Ikea that might be more appropriate for Ellie's skill level these days. Ikea even offers cute kiddie crash pads for the floor. I wonder if urlLink this air-filled one is safer than urlLink this foam filled mat ?

 I only looked for programs inside or nearly inside the loop, and I didn't look into commercial ops like gymboree (actually, I did look into gymboree, but their website was so bad, I clicked away in disgust).

 Since Aidan was barely mobile at around four months we could tell he was a natural climber. Before he could walk, he could climb. Literally. Before he was a year old, he'd climbed out of his crib twice and the playard on a regular basis. We finally gave up caging him and got him a bed with a ladder and slide to climb on when he was 18 months old. He loved it. Since we made that declaration of his climbing abilities so long ago, John and I have anxiously awaited the opportunity to get him in the rock gym. Yesterday, that day came! I took Aidan to urlLink Texas Rock Gym , where I myself hadn't been since getting pregnant with him. He had a ball! I was so proud of him. Of course, everyone in the gym was immediately taken by the adorable little climber. To be honest, I think I could have started a little earlier. For the past year and a half or so, we've been grooming his climbing abilities. When we go to Tinsley Park (or whatever you call Memorial Park when it gets near downtown, between Allen and Memorial), he always practices descending on the terraces. It's a great safe place to get a child comfortable with going down backwards on their belly, since their instinct is to go down on their bottoms. Everytime we went hiking this past year, John would take a little boldering foray with Aidan. We've taught him about keeping three of your four limbs on the rock and reaching around with the forth. He's great at crossovers and lunging for handholds. He has no fear. They had a great little harness that fit him well. Like standard adult harnesses, it went around the legs, but it also went around each shoulder, and the 'beaner looped in where those two pairs of loops met. They taught him the lingo and he was adorable with his little "on belay, mama!" and "dirt me, mama!" As with everything regarding Aidan these days, the only trick was to inspire his little process-oriented mind to work in the goal-oriented atmosphere. He saw no importance in getting to the top bar, he just liked climbing up a bit and rappelling down (he didn't get the whole put your feet in front of you bit, he just bumped his body against the rock all the way down each time!). The highest he climbed the whole time was about fifteen feet, and that was when a climber that worked there freeclimbed up in a tickle race to try to inspire him to go higher. He's been a little lost with John gone. When anything goes wrong he bursts into tears and cries "Daddy, don't go!" I thought some one on one time with him would help. He had a great time climbing, but he asked if we could bring our sister Ellie now. I think it's a tribute to attachment parenting that he doesn't even crave time without his sister, but it leaves me wondering what to do to make him feel super extra special. Even though he missed his sister, he had a great time climbing. He can't wait to go back!

 urlLink Houston Family - HOUSTON - Parenthood.com - Houston Moms in High-Profile Jobs Balance Work and Family Issues Daily : "Being away from home is the hardest part, says Nowak, who has been an astronaut for seven years and a naval officer for 18. Travel is an essential part of her profession, and Nowak says she has made quite a few trips to Russia, Canada and Japan -- some trips lasting several weeks. We go to these places to work with our international partners on space station issues, see the hardware they're building and participate in training, Nowak says. We also do a lot of domestic travel. To make things a little more complicated, Nowak's husband, Richard, is a flight controller in Mission Control for the International Space Station. During one of her technical job assignments, which lasted three years, Nowak also worked in Mission Control as a CAPCOM, which once stood for Capsule Communicator an astronaut who talks directly with the crew orbiting in space in real time. We both had to work three- to seven-day shifts with unusual hours evenings and overnight -- and had to make sure we never got assigned at the same time so that someone was home with the kids, Nowak says."

 Here in Houston, spring has sprung. It's the most lovely time of year here, the spring. I always tell people to spend their falls in New Mexico and springs near the ocean (for me, that's Houston, but I bet Florida or Mexico's gulf coast is even better). Lots of puffy ocean clouds, afternoon thunderstorms, but best of all, balmy warm 70s, sometimes 80s every day. Since this is my first chance in a long, long time to wear scanty springish/summer clothes (since I've got my girlish figure back from the dark reaches of pregnant body land), I've been celebrating the sprung spring with tight little spaghetti strapped tops. I like to layer one over the other and wear it with my pilates pants (basically, yoga pants). When I put one of these tops on the other day, Aidan said, Mom! You're not wearing a shirt! And again yesterday as I took him to school, Aidan said it. The thing is, he sees me without a shirt on all the time . I'm a huge believer in Margaret Mead's message that sexual angst comes from our society's shame we impart on our children. I'm not about to give my son a sense of bodily self-doubt. I've read in Dr. Sears that lots of children have their own naturally occurring sensitive about their body stages, and if he does this, I'll be happy to follow his lead. Until then, nudity reigns in our home! Well, it's not like we walk around naked all the time. Largely because I still sleep with Ellie and she nurses at night, but partly because I've always enjoyed it, I don't sleep with a shirt on. Aidan will come tumble around in bed with us when he wakes up and that's never odd. Aidan likes to come splash his hands in my bath water when I take a long bath, and he's never said anything about nudity then, either. Our house is so tiny that there really is no such thing as a sense of privacy, and to be honest, I like that (my cousin Shannon once said the boys in Colorado wouldn't have been able to conceal their bomb-making from their parents if they hadn't lived in giant suburb houses) a lot. My bedroom is on the circuit, and often Aidan and Ellie blow through making rounds while I'm getting dressed. Again, no Mom! no shirt! comments. My mom thinks this may be an early sign that Aidan could be a conservative. I know she's joking, so please read this with snickers. She says Aidan's expressing his early feelings of the rightful amount of cloth that should be over a woman's body. Let's hope not. A friend of ours said she would have to start pretending to be a conservative around her daughter so that when her daughter needed to rebel from her mom's values she wouldn't turn conservative herself! I've given this more than a little thought...

 urlLink Guardian Unlimited | The Guardian | Can popping fish-oil pills stop this tantrum? : "Researchers who have studied the effects of fish oils say they are most likely to have an impact on children whose difficulties are at least in part due to disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), dyslexia, autism and dyspraxia (dyspraxics often have difficulty carrying out complex, sequenced activities or may be mildly clumsy). There is some scientific evidence that an imbalance of certain fatty acids, which happen to be found largely in fish oils, may contribute to many of these. Further studies have found that dyslexia and the inattentiveness and impulsiveness associated with ADHD can be improved by fish-oil supplements. A study into the effect of fish-oil supplements on more than 100 dyspraxic children in Durham is nearing completion. There are some tell-tale signs that can indicate an imbalance of Omega-3 fatty acids in the diet. Allergy-related conditions such as eczema, asthma and hayfever are more common, as are poor concentration, depression, excessive mood swings and undue anxiety. Others with imbalances can experience difficulty getting to sleep at night and visual disturbances when reading, such as words and letters moving around. "

 urlLink Mom-Blog : "As my girlfriend said, 'We made it!' Yes, we survived our daughter's first year. It was a year filled with fear and tinged with disappointment, but more than that, it was also a year full of magic and firsts. You know, in the Bible, it talks about Mary 'holding all these things in her heart' about stuff that happened to her boy. I know EXACTLY what they mean. Looking back, being a stay at home mom allowed me access to magical moments that no one else in the world will ever know. That's just between me and my little girl, even though I know she'll never appreciate it when I bring it up...until she has her own child. (Sorry Mom!)"

 I knew the day would come, the day that Aidan says the last cute toddler phrase correctly. Today, his peanut jelly and sandwich actually came out peanut butter and jelly sandwich. He still says elephanant and to the rescetue, but this was the last phrase . He'll be three next week. He's such a boy now. You should see how big he is! And so coordinated! He's already a pro on the scooter he got for Christmas. Tonight he put his arm around Ellie when we were outside and said he wanted to keep her warm (which she returned with a shove). My heart is breaking all over the place! The beginning of two is a world different from the end of two. What a year. A year ago, he was amazing us with little complete sentences. He was clearly an amazing toddler, but still closer to a baby than to an adult. Now, he's clearly a boy, closer by far to adult than a baby in development terms. Tonight, he was talking to John's mom on the phone just like one of us would. He said, "oh hi, Nana... we ate tofu for dinner and now we're on a walk." Just like that, he's a fully functional, socially proficient member of our culture. He can talk on the phone, he can reflect. He's not even three! Next week, I'll have to amend that to he's barely three! But for now, not even three! The other night we all sat in the kitchen as John cooked dinner. Aidan was sitting on the countertop next to me and was curious about what the spices were. I opened up a few and let him first smell and then taste them. It was a fantastic activity to do with him! Ellie got into it a little, but she just wanted to put everything in her mouth! Aidan wanted to know the name of everything, already an experimenter. I love his little personality. It's such bittersweet agony to watch him grow up so fast while I can't wait to see what he'll do next! Ah, kids.

 I've been going back over urlLink William and Martha Sears' the Successful Child , I'd forgotten what a valuable tool for parenting this is. This time along, I was driven to use a highlighter so I could more quickly access the really good parts when I want to reference them. This book focuses on one of my key desires from parenting theories: defining what the objective behavior and character in the grown child is (what is success) and laying out avenues for achieving that grown child. Sears' vision for a successful young adult is centered on compassion, a close attachment to family, and achievement in school and extracurricular activities. These line up well with my own values. One part in particular that struck me reads: "Parents who believe that an infant comes into the world programmed to control the parents (and there are books and parenting advisers that promote this idea) respond by trying to control the baby first. Remember, tiny infants cry to communicate, not manipulate. When parents don't respond to infants' cries because they're trying to show the baby who's boss, they cut off the communication right from the start. Everybody loses." In a separate chapter, amid discussions on how to help siblings maintain a close bond, Sears recommends parents handle conflict by reminding the "children that they must respect one another's feelings--even when one is convinced that the other is completely wrong. It's hard to hate a person who understands and cares about how you feel... Take time to talk about the feelings involved and the actions they produce. This is the first step toward a true negotiated settlement, not just a temporary, parent-imposed cease-fire." When I read this I wanted to stand up and chear. It took me a good length of my life to discover the importance of respecting others (especially because they're so wrong! no, no, I learned, I grew. Really.) amid huge and principalled disagreements. Heck, American foreign policy would do well to read Sears. What Sears is offering here is a concrete way to transfer this value, through parenting, to your children. It's analogous to my no-sweets diet with which I insist on surrounding the kids. If I pound this in now, during the formative years, it will be part of the old-brain normal by the time they're adults.

 Last year I urlLink rented Spirited Away for my family and my son was so enthralled that it began a long series of frequenting Japaname films for his enjoyment. Since then, I've discovered that Japaname is a fantastic genre that matches my parenting values far better than Disney, Pixar and the typical American kid films. Primarily, Japaname plots often feature female protagonists who virtually always manage to save their own day--relying on traditional Japanese cultural values like strong character, selflessness, respecting elders, finding physical grace through mental calm--without needing a man to save it for them. Power Puff Girls are easy enough to find, and their Beat-Alls spoof on the Beatles makes a great introduction for parents and kids alike. Myazaki, who wrote and produced Spirited Away , also has two movies that are great for your kids even if they don't rival the masterpiece of Spirited Away : KiKi's Delivery Service and Castle in the Sky . Here is a NYT piece about new Japaname coming out, too: urlLink New Contender for the Anime Throne : "Japanese animation has its elder statesman, Hayao Miyazaki, 63, whose 'Spirited Away' won last year's Oscar for best animated feature. And now a new generation is asserting itself, led by Satoshi Kon, 40, whose 'Millennium Actress' was released in the United States in September, and whose latest creation, 'Tokyo Godfathers,' opens on Friday."

 urlLink NORTH AMERICAN REPORT: Babywise Almost Dropped - Christianity Today Magazine : "In February, Multnomah commissioned editor Jeff Gerke to investigate long-standing allegations by parents, physicians, and church leaders that the book's advice to parents puts infants at risk of poor development. Gerke, who joined Multnomah's staff after Babywise had been published, edited several of Ezzo's other parenting books. Gerke concluded that Ezzo's materials were dangerous, based on his interviews with former Ezzo employees and medical professionals." I first looked into Babywise last year after a friend said she'd chosen it for her parenting model. I was astonished at such a bad idea! It's primarily popular with the right wing Christian crowd, but lately even right wing christian leaders have urlLink spoken out against it: Dobson was particularly critical of Ezzo’s use of scripture to support leaving a baby to cry: “Praise God,” wrote Ezzo, “that the Father did not intervene when His son cried out on the cross.” Dr. Georgiana Rodiger, graduate of Fuller Theological Seminary (Evangelical) with an M.A. in theology and a Ph.D. in psychology writes, “I am appalled by the psychological and theological irresponsibility of the Ezzos.” The Ezzos are leading many families astray...”

 What do you think the positive reinforcement parenting version of "I'm going to send you to bed without eating if you play with your spoon again" would be? This is the kind of question I ponder a lot. When you review parenting methods [semi] professionally, you're left pairing your own method against everything you review. What would I call the method if my own parenting were to become one? The say it and mean it method. Or consistency like OCD in parenting method? I'm love centered, incorporate a lot of attachment parenting, but I am a hard-ass. Positive reinforcement parenting is very good for the kid's brain. Studies have pretty much shown overwhelmingly that a young child's verbal capacity (read the best determinant for later intelligence scientists have found) is directly and inversely correlated to the number of times the kid hears "no" or similarly negative feedback. In other words, kids who don't hear no all the time have fantastic vocabularies. However... By telling my kids no all the time, I can take them to any restaurant in town, I can take them on 9-hour flights to Europe with 0 problems, basically, I can rely on them to be good in any situation from church to in-laws. Exposing your children to different experiences is also one of those amazing corollaries to intelligence. And I wouldn't be able to expose them to much if I was afraid they would embarrass me everywhere we went. Like Johnny Cash, I try to walk the line. I say no as little as possible. But the best way to say no as little as possible is to mean it when I say it. I enforce on the first go, and I enforce in the nice voice , so I don't have to use the mean voice to mean it in a public setting. I don't rely on distraction as a correction device because I think that encourages bad behavior by inadvertently rewarding it with more attention. I try really hard to incorporate the one part of positive reinforcement parenting that I like: giving your kids a ton of reinforcement (attention) when he or she is good.

 Lisa's and Baby Joe's birth inspired me to write an article, an ammendment of sorts, as an addition to an earlier article I'd titled First-time Mother Shock. Here is an exerpt: Before the arrival of my daughter, my biggest fear was that I would not bond as closely with her as I had with my son at his birth. Nothing could have been more wrong. I bonded violently to her. Now comfortable with the mantle of motherhood, I gave in to every protective and doting urge, I held her and comforted her from the moment she emerged from my body. The difficulty, instead, was re-bonding with my son after bonding to my daughter. Nothing has ever looked so strange as my son after my daughter’s birth. In my mind, he was still my baby, but seeing him after having a baby juxtaposed paradoxically the fact that he was gigantic with my memory of him as so small! The first time I changed his diaper after returning home, I stared for a few minutes at his foot thinking, my God, what a big foot! Later I nudged my husband and said, have you seen Aidan’s feet? And my husband confessed he was having as much difficulty conceiving of Aidan in his new identity as I was. Compared to the fantastic bonding emotions I was feeling toward my daughter, my feelings for my son were a little pale. It frightened me, as nothing in parenting literature had prepared me for such an experience. What saved me was the presence of my parents, especially my dad whom Aidan adores, and who was able to lavish his every attention on Aidan so that he didn’t even notice mama’s estrangement. It gave me a few days to examine my feelings, and to be alone with Ella. I was able to localize my emotions to a few underlying feelings: · I realized I was so protective of Ella, that even my time staring into her eyes felt threatened when Aidan needed my attention. · I realized the difficulty I had seeing Aidan in his freakishly big state was based on the fact that now he was the big brother, and Ella was my baby. · I realized that Aidan’s natural curiosity I was struggling to encourage so he could bond with his sister was causing anxiety for me because I was so afraid he would hurt her. Taking time to isolate these realizations was the best thing I did, because then I was free to let myself off the guilty hook for experiencing natural instinctive emotions regarding my new baby. It shined light on the options available to me to reacquaint myself with my son. I was able to set goals for my reactions to situations, which released the anxiety I felt, and prevented me from setting Aidan up to have problems with his sister as he would have inevitably sensed my anxiety and connected it to the presence of his sister. The other thing I did that helped us was discuss every emotion openly with my husband. He never made me feel guilty for them, he only offered suggestions for what he could do to help. After my parents left, around Ella’s fifth day out, the best thing John did to help was spend time with Aidan. He also was better equipped to spend time with the two children together. He would read with them both in his lap or cuddle with the two of them at once. This let me retreat to the corner and watch my new family together, which turned out to be the best thing for my brain: experiencing them as a unit, without the pressure to interact. All the while, I worked to re-bond with Aidan just as I would advise another mother bond with her first time infant in the event of low bonding hormones. I gave him lots of skin on skin contact, through massaging him or cuddling with him, I smelled him a lot, I gazed into his beautiful eyes and smiled. I told him I loved him and assured him that was my number one guy. Either my efforts or time, and likely a combination of the two together, resolved the problems I had adjusting to mothering my two kids. Within the first two weeks, Aidan had fallen in love with his sister right along with us, and just as I had discovered how much I loved watching my husband be a father when Aidan was born, I fell in love with Aidan all over again, too, this time as my child and a big brother.

 who was born at 9:45 in Boston! I'm so happy for the whole Cadence90 Clan. Lisa's poor husband is terribly sick with the flu, though, something we really sympathize with since John was sick with the stomach flu for Ella's second and third days. I still remember it, he was so disgustingly nauseous as I was trying to get out of the hospital, and as we drove up to the house my mom was trying to get John to pose for pictures of coming home and John could only throw the baby at my mom and dash inside to begin his two days o'puking! It was strange to have John sick for such an otherwise amazing time. It makes for a fun story now, but I know John would have preferred spending those days holding his newborn daughter. Anyway, Lisa's asking for prayers, good vibrations, or whatever form of mental goodness you care to send their way.

 Today is such a nice day, for the first time since Monday, the sun is shining and it's warm enough to really play outside (without coats). But the fog has lifted for another reason, too. For the first time since Monday my Ellie feels better. She's played so contentedly by herself this morning, that I was able to catch up on my writing. With my arms finally empty, I wrote three articles, 20 pages! I'm so relieved her fever is gone. Two and a half days straight of 102 degrees is unsettling to say the least. I had given myself today as a deadline to take her to our pediatrician, Dr. Ho, if she wasn't better yet. I didn't want to be in the middle of the weekend with the only choices of no doctor or ER doctor if she got worse. But she's better!

 urlLink MediaGuardian.co.uk | Broadcast | Multimillion dollar TV brand targets children worldwide : "Fox Kids, the worldwide children's television brand launched by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, and ABC Cable Networks, which is run by Disney, unveiled a corporate revolution that will result in children in countries as far apart as Israel and Brazil feasting on an action-adventure diet of Power Rangers, X-Men, Spiderman and Inspector Gadget. 'Jetix will be among the most widely distributed television brands for kids around the world and a showcase for new and existing action-adventure programmes, including the new season of the best-known series in the genre, Power Rangers,' said Anne Sweeney, president of ABC Cable Networks Group and Disney Channel Worldwide. "

 Poor Ellie is sick with some sort of virus. She has a runny nose and a spiky fever. Mostly, she just feels uncomfortable. She hasn't wanted to eat anything but breastmilk yesterday and today, so I just cuddle her and nurse her to try to help. Thank God we have TiVo now so I have some decent TV to watch while I nurse and cuddle her! When this all started, though, on Tuesday night, she didn't even want to nurse. For the first time ever, she cried inconsolably. She even started screaming! Btw, a quick blow of breath in her face when she'd begin that horrible scream stopped that pretty fast. Not even an offered breast soothed her. I told John I thought what she really needed was limbic stimulation to reduce stress hormones and soothe her just enough so that she could relax and fall asleep. We both moaned about having procrastinated so bad on the rocking chair. We have the rocking chair my mom rocked me in as a baby, but it's still disassembled from its refurbishing and transport to Houston. Then, John and I looked at each other and smiled. We had the perfect limbic stimulator! A few months back we bought a swiveling office chair from Ikea because (it was really cute, and ) I'd read how valuable swiveling (or constant limbic stimulation of that nature) can be to physical development in babies in Elise Eliot's What's Going on in There . Sure enough, a few weeks after we got it, Ellie finally made her first steps. I cuddled Ellie close despite her cries and started turning at an even pace. John put on Yo-Yo Ma's Bach concerto, one of Ellie's favorites, and within about three, maybe as many as five minutes our inconsolable sick baby was sleeping! It worked perfectly! I still want John to put together that rocking chair though...

 urlLink Speaking as a parent: January 2004 Archives : "The period just after Xmas brought home to me the problems of running an incentive-led household as opposed to a discipline-driven one. With Father Christmas's visit over and the big parental presents doled out there was an authority vacuum of alarming proportions. What to do when the good little chldn of Xmas Eve turn into the surly little brats of Boxing Day? In the presence of such an abundance of toys and sweets I reckoned we needed to find another form of leverage so I decided to look for seasonal games on the net. Not with a view to playing them but rather to withholding them as a penalty for bad behaviour, as necessary. I found several sites with free games but then wished I hadn't when Jake deliberately behaved irreproachably in order to be able to spend hours shooting elves and reindeer playing Polar Cull 2."

 While I'm still pondering the whole Christmas thing, the meaning of Christmas break is at least clear. Today was Aidan's first day back to school, after being out for more than three weeks! I realized somewhere around mid-morning how easy one kid is, and how much I appreciate his little pre-school for giving me the opportunity to have that one kid feeling with my second kid. So I think the reason of the season here is teaching parents to appreciate all the days outside of the holiday break!

 urlLink Lisa is about to have her second baby today or tomorrow, I'm confused which. urlLink Here, she blogged what it was like taking her first baby to work the first time. Always happy to see new perspectives on working with babies... Actually, I'm working on an article dedicated to the topic, so if you have personal experiences that might help, please share!

 urlLink Welcome To Everyones Internet® | EV1.net - : "The highest levels of fast-food consumption were found in youngsters with higher household income levels, boys, older children, blacks and children living in the South. The lowest levels were found in youngsters living in the West, rural areas, Hispanics and those aged 4 to 8, but more than 20 percent of youngsters in each of those groups still reported eating fast food on any given day."

 So this is week 2 using the responsibility chart. I think it's going well, but it's one of those things whose value I have to really sell to my son. This thing is set up like a grid with days of the week going down and responsibilities going across. It's a magnetic whiteboard and comes with a gigantic set of magnets with all sorts of cute pictures like stars, balloons, hearts, etc. and magnetic responsibility name plates to set as the jobs like stay dry, clean up your toys, share, no whining, help mom, help dad, and so on. There are about 20 to choose from, plus blank ones you can write on. The point is you pick five or six to put in the grid. This is a particularly convenient model for us because Aidan's school follows Piaget-based curriculum, which focuses on key "jobs" each person is responsible for like nice touches and listening ears. While Aidan does have the crucial development skill (he'll be 3 later this month) for the chart of understanding consequences (in toddler talk, he gets why and because), he's still very process oriented rather than our boring old adult way of thinking, goal oriented. So the biggest thing I've had to stress on this is why he wants to get stars, and how getting a bunch of stars will help him have things he really wants. Right now the things he covets most in life are riding his new scooter and putting his new tent up in his bedroom in which he can play camping, and even sleep in the sleeping bag sometimes (even though every night he's done it so far he gave up on sleeping in it and moved back to the bed within an hour of bedtime... go figure). To teach him to covet the prizes, and therefore positively motivate good behavior, I've made a big freaking deal of the stars and balloons, giving them for every good deed, and really talking up the finale award, then when he gets the giant award, I remind him all the while by saying silly parent things like, Aren't you glad you got so many stars so you could put your tent up? I think he's getting it...

 urlLink Speaking as a parent : "Jake spent most of the month telling anyone who cared to listen that Santa Claus didn't exist. Round about the 22nd he seemed to have a kind of deathbed conversion, after which he willingly conceded that SC was a busy man and probably did shop at Argos to save time, as we had explained last year. When he went to see Santa in a large shop on the 23rd he not only had his request ready but he sensibly accompanied it with a small note containing the Argos shop number and stock code to avoid confusion." (Argos is like Target in the UK, I think)

 urlLink BBC NEWS | Health | Chinese tea 'may cure jaundice' : "A herbal tea used widely in China to treat jaundice could soon be used by doctors in the West. Scientists in the United States have found that Yin Zhi Huang (YZH) can stop the build-up of a type of bile that causes the condition. Writing in the Journal of Clinical Investigation, they said the tea could form the basis of new treatments. Jaundice is common in newborn babies. If untreated it can lead to serious complications such as brain damage. "

 I hesitate to diss urlLink this guy's kids' school right now because I just asked him about his Christmas as below, but in reading through his blog I almost coughed up my frosty beer when urlLink I stumbled on this ! The football (I think he means soccer, he's in the UK) program his 9-year-old is in is redesigning the rules so each team is only partially scored based on the actual goals they scored, and the remainder of the score is based on the amount of goals the coach thinks they should have scored. It's supposed to be more fair . Right. I'm the person who wouldn't buy my son velcro shoes because I felt it was dumbing down his world too much. What's next? Raise them in padded rooms? Because that's the physical equivalent of this mental coddling. Part of the reason you put your kid in sports is so they'll learn about winning and losing, about better teams from richer districts or worse teams with bad collective genes. In the end, we parents hope it fosters critical thinking skills as well as navigation skills for the adult RW. To be honest, if my kid was having a problem because he lost all the time, I would sooner consider moving him to a better team!

 Ironically, John and I were just talking about needing to redefine the ways our family celebrates Christmas before next year as we walked. Then, today I was catching up on Robin's blog, Speaking as a Parent, who also pondered the holiday. urlLink Speaking as a parent : "I don't like the idea of asking the chldn for wish lists. A careful parent will not ask a question of a child unless the answer is already known. I feel more inclined to give them a list of what I want them to have. Simply to ask them to nominate an open ended list of junior consumer items seems a guaranteed way to generate either disappointment, broken promises or a short term cash flow crisis. I suppose it would be all right if they were banned from reading the Argos catalogue and watching television for the months of Nov and Dec, but the genie is already out of that particular bottle. I would really like to imbue the season with a deeper meaning but it feels like I'm swimming upstream on this one. Trying to explain what pine trees and mince pies have to do with Palestine 1 AD has proved difficult. I was ready for questions like How can Father Christmass reindeer fly? (Why, magic, of course) but it's been questions like How many reindeer does Father Christmas's sleigh have? that have stumped me. " I'll ask Robin on his site how things ended up. I could use some advice here. We were so grateful for all the presents our family got from our friends and family. But... I'm very aware of my power as a parent to shape the kids' impressions of Christmas for life, and the way that power will greatly diminish in about five or six years. This is my chance, now, to reshape things. I worry about the values celebrating with such abundance mistakenly imparts. I worry nearly equally about the danger of hurting the feelings of my relatives by asking them to curb their generosity. What to do?

 I first blogged it on the other blog. some posts I think I should publish in both places because they discuss subjects that cross the borders between personal without kids, and personal with kids... so here it is again: This morning we got up and took the kids (on foot, except Ellie, who was backpacked in) downtown to catch the newly opened lightrail. We got off at Rice and walked the Rice walk/jog trail to the Village where we ate at Croissant Brioche. The train was so much fun! The city center was as busy as a workday, but instead of the sidewalks being filled with tight suits and serious faces, they were filled with excited faces, people who were proud of their city! Everywhere we went, this great energy just radiated. Well, maybe not everywhere. The Rice trail regulars were like, what? who let all these average people into my neighborhood? The city itself feels so different, for one, it feels like a real city! But there's something else, I can't explain it. I'll have to spend the next week riding the rails and working on articulating this great new urban identity. Aidan was a champion, he walked all the way both ways, nearly completely without whining. People kept complimenting him on walking like such a big boy. You can't take strollers on the trains anyway without folding them away, just one more reasons that strollers seem very un-new urbanist. We should teach our children to love walking as soon as they are able! And, chances are, they are able much sooner than you'd think. This past summer we made Aidan walk all over Europe's cities when he was only 2 years and 4 months, and he did great. We just had to be hard asses for a little while about it. We told him strollers are for babies like his little sister, not for big boys like him. I digressed far. Now, I'm resting comfortably on the couch with a nice cold beer in our new frosty freezer beer mugs... Thanks, Jenny! Time for the playoffs!

 I found urlLink mom-blog through a search, and I found urlLink Mom in the Mirror via mom-blog. Consider them temps for a bit.

 It's a new year, and accordingly, I'm cleaning house in my blogs. On this blog there's not much of a change, on the other one I vow to finally complete the archival posting of the blog before blogger. The biggest change I'm making here is updating my blogroll. First up, or out rather, is urlLink Fishyshark . First, some history. Fishyshark is a blog ("an expectant father's journal") started by Kosmo, aka urlLink Daily Kos , a fantastic political pundit and a true member of the bloggeratti. This year, Kos' wife Elisa became pregnant and Kos started a separate blog solely on the topic of his new life as an expectant father. It was pretty funny, sometimes crass but always witty. Since little Ari was born, Kos has only written a few times and his posts reflect a descent into bitterness that I can't really sympathize with at all. First, Ari was beautiful, things were tough, but fatherhood was still great. Then, Ari was difficult because he couldn't be put down and wanted to nurse too often. These days, Ari is demanding, eats too much, cries too much, rewards them with smiles too rarely, and keeps them awake too many nights. I don't know if Kos is being witty, or if he's just a bitter and unhappy person. Honestly, I don't think it bodes well for his marriage, much less his parenthood. I mean, life doesn't hang on the good times, but rather the tough ones. And at the end of those toughest of tough days, if you can't look at your kid or your partner or even your life and find (even if you have to reach really, really far for it) more good than bad to focus on, you're kind of up shit creek. Besides, having a new baby isn't so hard if you resign yourself to holding and loving on your baby constantly for a few weeks! I had Ella this year under very difficult circumstances, considering the space shuttle accident, but even then she was the joy in the hard time, not the hard time. Did I choose to look at it that way or was I lucky? Why is this guy so unhappy in fatherhood? A blog can be whatever it wants, I don't mean to editorialize Kos. He's got so many fans and readers anyway that the loss of me is like a drop in the bucket. Dissing him on his turf would be flaming, which is wrong. But I do get to diss him here. I hate that he's adding to all those stereotypes I fight every day about our society's view of children. He's talking about his new son like a pain in the ass new employee, when we should be celebrating new life. I think a lot of people in our culture--probably him included--would be happier, more peaceful if their parents had loved them more, held them longer. I see what simple touch and massage does to reduce my own children's stress. I see people around me everywhere missing out on the great connection I have with my kids, simply because they didn't know they could give more of their hearts to their kids, and the results are far reaching from not being able to go out to restaurants, to crying all night. It's so sad! I guess it comes down to this. Snide and crass make for better political punditry than parenting. I'm taking Fishyshark off my blog roll today. I still strive to link to more parenting blogs, I think it's a needed genre in our society. I might be experimenting a lot, so don't be surprised to see changes. Today I'll kick it off with urlLink Like a Baby , a blog kept by a Canadian mother of an adorable little girl named Chloe, who is probably still sleeping it off from her raucous New Year's party (drinking's a good sign!). Here's hoping...

 Here's a list I've been working on. Feel free to let me know what toys were best for you. Best toys for multiple stages of development (best use of money): Plastic, textured, colored links Spotted handled mirror w/happy face Baby Mozart block Textured, colored, multiple shaped building block set Xylophone Finger puppets Tupperware (especially w/wooden spoons) Nursery rhyme books Nesting cups Sidewalk chalk Whoozit Best Toys by age: From birth on: Spotted, ringed rattle Simple tacking blocks (about 1 1/2 inch in diameter) Chewable books Family picture books Patterned, freezable teethers boppy From six months on: Shape sorting block Soft, big (9 or 12 inch diameter) ball Small wiffle balls Plush fish acquarium Flap books Spinning tops Big cars Percussion instruments (tambourine, shaker egg, drums) Play phones Play keys Old remotes Peak-a-boo books Textured books Stand up and push around toy (wagon, mower, dumptruck) Large colors Hammer balls into holes game From twelve months on: Play a song or make a noise button books Handle books Stackable train Littler cars Stacking ring tower Finger paints Traditional crayons Duplos Mom/dad’s socks and shoes Wooden construction bench flashcards From 18 months on: Clay (playdoh) Painting with brushes Flute, simple horn Simple computer games Small animal figurines, dolls (farm set) Basic puzzles Intermediate legos Simple plot books Tri-cycle From 24 months on: Tea party Cooking sets Jigsaw puzzles Money exchange games Barnyard bingo Remote car/tractor Hotwheel garage Shoots and ladders Internet games (SesameStreet.com, Dora) Project books (like shape or color sorting) Joe’s notebook from Blue’s Clues Dora’s backpack Pre-School: legos Harmonica An open Word document on the computer Rollerblades Scooter Bike with training wheels Soccer ball Action figures Robots Themed toys from favorite shows, books, or movies Toys I wish existed: Mirror play mat (a 2 foot diameter flexible, reflective mat) Hanging tree (a wooden post with nobs protruding)

 Part of the privilege of being a parent is that you get to paint the picture of normal for your child's brain. During their formative years (birth to six), children's experiences of everything from married couples to exercise to daily diet comprise what feels normal for the rest of their lives. This power [responsibility] allows you to screw with the realities of the world just a bit. For example, we tell Aidan McDonalds is yucky. Every time he sees an ad or sign her reminds us and we love it. Considering that McDonalds advertises before and after his favorite show, Sesame Street, I think this counter-attack has been especially effective. Once he got into an argument with his cousin about it because she said it was yummy and he said it was yucky. The exchange went on for a while until Rian said well, broccoli is yucky and Aidan was obliged to say no, it's yummy. Well, today we got to take this power to a new level and make good on Aidan's stand for broccoli. It all started when this cool guy was on Oprah last week and he said broccoli is one of the best foods for the body there is, but a lot of people don't like it. He helpfully pointed out that the broccoli seed's sprouts are every bit as healthy so if you like sprouts you can get the goods that way. John hates broccoli so I added the sprouts to his grocery list next time he went to Whole Foods. Tonight Aidan needed a quick, small dinner when we got home from cell phone shopping, and John wanted to make him a PB&J (unsweetened preserves and crushed nuts on whole wheat bread sweetened with white grape juice instead of the typical HFCS, fyi). Aidan eats way too many of these and I try to diversify his diet as much as possible since we don't take vitamins as a family. So I told John to throw in some broccoli sprouts. Aidan's new big thing is to sit on the counter and "help" dad cook. They have this great bonding time and today we even sat Ellie on the counter too long enough to snap the cutest picture ever. I say this so you understand that we weren't pulling one over on Aidan, he helped put the sprouts on. Then he said, "Dad, I think this is my first peanut and jelly butter and broccoli sandwich." We almost fell over laughing. Then he proceeded to eat it up with the usual abandon, just like it was... wait for it... normal . What do we hope to gain with all this tomfoolery? Aidan gets excited over a special rare treat of a lemon wedge like most kids do over refined sugar-deserts. Today at Croissant Brioche, he giggled with anticipation over the coming taste of the froth off dad's capucino. Diet is a learned response, and parents are the teachers. When our kids grow up, they'll surely be aware of how different our values and teachings were, but these values we're instilling will always feel most comfortable. Madly in love parents right alongside eating well despite their unhealthy surrounding culture will feel normal.

 Here it is ladies: the best advice I've ever read regarding crampy periods. The week before your period, take as many epsom salt baths as you can fit in. I tried it this period and the results were shocking . I've had chronically painful cramps my whole life. I've even had surgery to alleviate the endometriosis that inflames them. I read that endometriosis and crampy periods get better after childbirth, and they didn't. I read this advice in this book I've praised a lot here lately: Smart Medicine for a Healthier Child (it was advice for you teenage child, but everything in this book works for adults, too). I only had time for two epsom salt baths in the past few days (I have two young children, after all!), but that seemed to be enough to notice a huge decrease in my pain. I'm sitting here writing instead of laying in bed moaning, mainly. The book mentioned that you could take magnesium supplements orally in place of the baths, but why would I want to do that? Yuck. Somebody try it and let me know what happens, so I can find out if my results were anomalous.

 I never noticed this before, it's a great and very long article by Dr. William Sears. He tells of his transformation as a father between his first few kids and his eighth. It's a wonderful story. urlLink FATHERING :"...My eight children are training me to be a better person and father—because I'm there for them. Attachment fathering pays off; in disciplining children, we become disciplined persons..." "...remember, you are bringing up someone else's future husband or wife, mother or father. The attitudes you instill in your baby and child are the building blocks for that adult person. Children learn by example. The best way to build character is to model the qualities you want to see in your children. I found it helpful to list those qualities that I wanted to model for my children. When I made such a list, I realized that there were flaws in the model I presented to my children. I couldn't model what I didn't do. As I went down the list of values and related these to an average day with my children, I realized how often I didn't reflect these attitudes myself..."

 Phew. After two nights in a row of accidents, we were happy to wake up to a dry bed. We thought about how both times Aidan woke us up with his wet bed were about 6 a.m., so this morning, John set his alarm for 5 and woke Aidan to use the toilet. Then they returned to bed. The problem is John never really got back to sleep. I think tomorrow he'll set the alarm for 4 so it feels less like he's starting his day. In addition, we did the usual nothing to drink after 7 p.m. and encouraged him to potty many times last evening.

 This week has seen some sort of regression in Aidan. After going months without an accident (of the potty-sort), he had one at school yesterday. Plus, he's wet his bed for the past two nights in a row. I don't know if it represents some sort of development where he has to devote his brain to the new stuff, or if it's a stress response. I'm just watching and waiting to see where this goes. Additionally, we've developed a morning battle over the past two weeks regarding putting socks and shoes on. It's not that he resists it, but rather he won't focus long enough to do it. As has always been our school routine, I lay out his clothes and go to make his lunch as he puts them on. I have always had to yell a few reminders to "do his job," but he generally did it. Lately, I peek in on his progress to find him twirling his socks around or playing with his sister. Last week, I tried to respond with punishments as consequence for not doing his job. I took away privileges to only a limited success. I sat him on his bed or in the corner, but when he promised to be nice and do his job and got up to do it, he was just as day dreamy as before the punishment. One day, one of his teachers mentioned to me how much she's enjoyed watching Aidan's development blossom. She complimented his friendliness, his social amour, his communication, and more. This made me feel comfortable enough to ask her the next day for advice about our morning battle. She said to send him to school barefoot. She said I don't need another battle on my hands and they can put his socks and shoes on without any trouble. I mentioned to her my fear that this is just the first of what could be a lifetime of daydreaming when responsibility showed up. She said I didn't have anything to worry about because Aidan is a model student. I decided to ponder this a while and talk to John before deciding whether her advice could work for us. The next day I asked his other teacher if she's noticed Aidan not doing his jobs (it's a jobs oriented school, very Piaget). Her answer blew me over. She said only when you're here. The first teacher's advice was basically to avoid the battle that I'm clearly losing anyway. And his problem wasn't that he didn't want to wear shoes, so I thought a simpler method than sending him to school barefoot was to just put his shoes on for him at home. The whole reason I'd started him on doing it by himself was to save me time, and the battle was actually taking up more time. This morning was the first time I tried it, and I have to say it was like grease on wheels. He was so happy to have me there. We did it together and he quizzed me on left and right feet just as he used to before the school routine ever started. It made me think maybe it was the attention he was after, and through the battle he was getting it, even if it was negative. We'll see if the success continues to tomorrow, but I think I have my solution.

 This is the biggest thing to happen lately with Eleanor. Week before last--actually, I remember it was the day after Valentine's Day, so February 15--I decided to try to rock Ella to sleep for the night rather than nursing her, as I've always done. The next day, as I shared the story with Serena (Thank God! She was the perfect person to understand), she asked in shock why in the world I decided to do that. Let me explain. When Aidan was a baby, I still had an office job. I worked odd hours because John and I toggled our schedules to avoid childcare for so long. I breastfed exclusively, and pumped a lot. Aidan was used to bottles and used to John putting him to bed. Often, even if I was home, John would sing and rock Aidan to sleep without me. Sometimes I would join in for fun. It was a sweet time. In contrast, my sweet baby girl Eleanor snubbed her nose at a bottle from the earliest introductions (between three and six weeks, just as we read). She would rather be hungry until mom came home than drink from a bottle. Most people know how only recently (and she's just turned 13 months old!) has Ella warmed a little to solid foods. I think this exhibits her desire to only drink mama's milk at all costs. But I treasure the memories of John "nursing" Aidan to sleep, and I want him to have that will Ella, too. At first, that night, we let her cuddle between the two of us on the couch, but when she wanted to nurse we nudged her away. Instantly she became upset. I couldn't handle not holding her when she cried, so I alone then did my best to comfort her and soothe her cries. I danced with her, played music for her, but she cried and screamed frantically. I don't know why I kept with it. I had some misguided idea that I had to start what I finished. At one point she slapped her hands at my body and face in a desperate attempt to communicate her needs to me. I was balling, and John could only hold me as I held her. Forty minutes later, she fell asleep, exhausted from the ordeal. I put her down, and fell apart. My heart was broken, shattered by the cruelty I'd just inflicted on my child. For forty minutes, she cried and I chose not to give her what I knew she was asking for. I was so upset, John and I both knew we'd made a horrible choice. Within a few minutes, he left the room and came back with her so I could hold her and nurse her and try to make it all better. I know some parents let their children cry themselves to sleep, and therefore won't think anything of my story. When your baby cries, your mama brain has a physical response, you release stress hormone that can only be soothed when you go to your baby. It's nature's way of helping us survive. But like any physical response, you can teach your body to ignore it. I've always thought this was dangerous. I want my body to remain responsive to my baby's needs, for safety sake. Your child will eventually learn that they won't be responded to when they cry, and hence just go to sleep. And here again, I never wanted to teach my baby I wouldn't always respond to her. So having never taught my body these lessons, on a very physical level, I was a wreck for a few days. I told my Ellie, as I cried and nursed her that night, that I promise to never do that again. Ella has never been like her brother, so I shouldn't have tried to make her be. Ella is very sensitive. She likes to watch the world from mom's arms rather than jump in like Aidan. She warms to people slowly, but once she does, you can be assured it's a compliment because her intuition about personalities is finely tuned. When she's comfortable, it's easy to see that her intelligent mind at work. While she certainly is willful, most of her personality stems from her keen discernment about comfortable verses uncomfortable situations rather than stubbornness. In other words, she is very aware of herself and social situations. I say all this in an effort to explain that I intentionally indulge her huge need to nurse because I know it's a rare comfort for her. She needs it. I've observed in her an awareness that, had I chosen to time her feedings or not nurse, she would have been a high-need baby, perhaps even labeled with some learning disorder. This, in turn, makes me wonder how many high-need babies are simply not understood. Their needs don't match up with society's vision for a proper child, so rather than change to meet the child, we label and even medicate children that don't fit the mold. By nursing Ella on her cues, we've never missed a night of sleep, not even for an overseas flight, or when we experienced a seven-hour time change in Europe. John later said that we did what we did because we thought Ella needed to learn something, but it turned out we were the ones who needed the lesson. We were reminded how very close to our children we are because of our decision to always respond to them so intuitively. We needed to be reminded that our wants reflect our adult lives, and aren't always as important as our children's wants that reflect their child lives. We can go their way, but they can't come ours. I needed to be reminded what a treasure nursing my baby is. It's an honor, not an obligation. Rather than wishing my children were something different, I have to champion them exactly as they are. And I should have no trouble doing that, because they're wonderful.

 A friend emailed me to ask how the kids are. Typically, she would know better because I often complain that family and friends would know perfectly well how the kids are if they would just read the kids' blog now and then. So, protectively, she added that she'd checked the blog before asking. Point well taken. I seem to have written a lot of entries these last few weeks about things other than kids. Which negates the whole purpose of this blog. My other blog is supposed to be my brilliant commentary on the world, and this is the kids' brilliant development. I feel very Seinfeld: "Worlds are colliding!" I think the biggest reason I haven't detailed their lives lately is because both children seem to be in huge periods of transition right now, and I'm waiting to see what's going to happen. I should stop waiting. Childhood is one giant transition, and this blog is here to document the process, sprinkled with witty humor and tearful discoveries. I'm going to work on two separate updates, one for each child, so the whole world can see just how the kids are.

 I'm so tired. Life caught up with me in a bad way. I feel like the astronauts when they come back from space, when gravity hits them for the first time after being weightless for so long. I have 23-day cycles, and you wouldn't think that extra five days makes a big difference, but it does. I'm basically left with three very different weeks. The week before my period I'm typically PMS-y, the week during my period I'm recovering, but still shell shocked, and the week between the two is a desperate spurt of activity in an effort to accomplish what I can before the next wave hits. It leaves me feeling frenetic, being whipped about by my hormonal rollercoaster. Five days of steady would really be nice. I could do a lot with five days. This weekend I was complaining about it to John, telling him how lucky he is that he's steady all the time. He set me straight, he told me I need my frenzy. And he's right. Somewhere between the highs and lows is where passion is born. Passionate highs and passionate lows. My own personal yin and yang. Without it, I wouldn't have my creativity, my spark. I guess this hormonal freakshow is my muse. But man, is she a bitch. I was almost going to be the best mom in the world today. I found out that the Fifth Ward branch library was offering a teach your baby pre-reading skills program this morning and I was planning on attending. Ellie saved my lazy, hormonal rear though by falling sound asleep at the very moment I should have been packing her into the car. Maybe next time. I found out the Heights library has a nice Tuesday morning program schedule. I've been desperate to find something since Miss Gail left the Montrose library. She was amazing. Where are you Miss Gail!!! Maybe I'll try the Heights library next Tuesday, today I'm just bone tired.

 Today Fox replayed the Simpson's in which Marge lodged a class action suit against Big Sugar. She goes into the Springfield sugar supplier, Motherloving Sugar, and says to the head guy, "I want you to stop putting so much sugar in everything, or at least warn people it's so unhealthy." Awwe. It's a clasic. Right up there with the Diaper Hill episode.

 urlLink World Health Organization WHO code on breastfeeding : "Selling Out Mothers and Babies - Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes in the USA The WHO Code is the common name for the "International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes," which was adopted by the World Health Organization in 1981. Recognizing that marketing formula is, by definition, an attempt to reduce the number of breastfed babies, and recognizing that breastfeeding is both a vital public health and economic issue, the USA joined with 118 other nations in ratifying the Code. What does the Code say? The WHO Code PROHIBITS certain aggressive infant formula marketing strategies, such as: 1. Promoting infant formula through health care facilities 2. Lobbying health care personnel with free gifts 3. Providing free formula samples to new mothers 4. Using words or pictures in advertising which idealize bottle feeding The Code also mandates that formula ads and labels include the facts about the benefits of breastfeeding and the hazards associated with formula feeding. The Code does not prohibit the existence of infant formula nor the choice to bottle feed. Instead, it seeks to give all women only pure facts about feeding their babies, free of marketing influence, so that they can make free and informed choices. The Code tries to level the playing field so that the superiority of breastmilk — which has no Madison Avenue agency or million dollar marketing budget promoting it —is not lost in the landslide of formula marketing hype."

 I heard about this organization this morning, and it seemed perfectly timed considering Nancy's story. Peace Games is an organization that works with schools and families to teach children to resolve their conflicts without violence. Parents across the country can encourage their kids' schools to adopt peacegames' curriculum, or even become a partner school. The website has advice for discussing violent trauma (on a personal or national scale) with your children, and in the family resources section, it offers some nice advice for raising children to value non-violence. urlLink peacegames

 urlLink The Observer | Food monthly | The big issue : "The beginnings of America's little weight problem can be traced to the Seventies, when Richard Nixon appointed Earl Butz to be his secretary of agriculture. Butz's job, among other things, was to ensure that disgruntled farmers voted the right way. The result, to cut a long story short, was that corn production soared to an all-time high. By the early Eighties, Butz's legacy was clear: prices on most commodities were down, a state of affairs that has continued ever since. The government still underwrites the production of corn to the exclusion of just about everything else. President Bush has recently passed a bill giving farmers $800 billion over the next 10 years. Then came several crucial technological developments. In 1971, scientists in Japan found a way to produce a cheaper sweetener than sugar: high-fructose corn syrup, or HFCS. Made from corn, it was six times sweeter than sugar. However, unlike sucrose or dextrose, it takes a different route into the human metabolism and, as a result, is rather less healthy than other sugars. In the mid-Seventies, palm oil, previously tricky to process, became available as commercial fat, fit for frying French fries and for baking cookies; moreover, products made with it last. Unfortunately, it is also 45 per cent saturated fat. Palm oil and HFCS changed the nature of the foods Americans love to eat forever. Finally, there was the abandonment of portion control. It took the fast food companies a surprisingly long time to realise that people would rather buy one vast portion of fries or one giant bucket of Coke than look greedy and buy two smaller ones. But once Taco Bell and McDonald's had trialled this idea and their sales rocketed sky high, there was no going back. Bigness was here to stay; customers felt ripped off if they were offered anything less. As of 1996, 25 percent of the $97 billion spent on fast food came from items promoted on the basis of larger size or extra portions. Such changes have had a startling effect on what an American requires to make him feel satiated."

 I grew up in the country. We had cows, sheep, pigs, horses, and many dogs and cats. But we never had chickens. I've always heard people say once you get used to fresh eggs, you'll never be able to live without them. Now I can tell you that's true. No, we did not join the masses of city-dwelling yuppies who raise chickens in the backyard. For about a year now, I've been going to the Central City Co-op, a fuit and vegetable co-op that provides mostly locally grown, organic food. In thiis past year, the co-op's really bloomed. It's gone from an empty lot in upper Kirby where people convene on Wednesdays only, to a rented house with Wednesday pick-up days augmented by occasional Saturday co-op community socials, and now it's in a warehouse rented from an inner-city church and is open Wednesdays and Saturdays. Instead of only getting a pre-packed box of a wide variety of fruits and veggies, now you can pick out your own items, too. This part is especially fun for Aidan, who loves counting out apples or melons and carrying them to our recycled box. Aside from fresh grown stuffs, these days there is also local honey, handmade soaps, venegars, and kefir, cheeses (mostly goat), nuts, and freshly laid eggs. It's on this latter item that I've developed a particularly strong dependency. The switch was a big one for me, because for so long now I've depended on Whole Foods' algae-fed hen eggs, as they were an extra source of omega-3 fatty acids in our family's diet. Especially during the pregnancies and stilll now nursing, I wanted to be sure to promote the brain myelination with the good fats. But we've gotten to where we ea wild smoked salmon for breakfast or snacks mor mornings of the week than not, so I think we can afford the change. That's probably just rationalization on my part. I'll tell myself anything to get to keep eating these eggs! It's not like they're bad. They're from grain-fed, cage-free organic chickens that just happen to live near-by.

 Renee is a blogging mom from Canada, and here she puzzles over American parents' unhealthy kids. I do understand that an awful lot of American parents make choices like she discusses, but I hope the number of people I've blogged, or who've commented on my blogs, help her understand that we're not all that way! urlLink likeababy: a pregnancy, a baby, a family : "I was lurking through mommietalk and saw a post on fast food and toddlers. I realized (duh, Renee) that our American neighbours seem to eat a lot more fast food than we do up here in Canada. I mean, part of this may have to do with a combination of cost and accessibility. I know in most of the communities and cities I've been in the U.S., there are miles and miles of fast food restaurants. Canada, you're most likely to live in either in a big city, where real estate is expensive and restaurants tend to be higher end, or in a more rural community where access is unlikely (no McDonald's in most of the British Columbia interior, for example) I don't know. Don't get me wrong, if you want to feed your family Mc D's twice a week, it's not the end of the world. It's just that, in order for me, or most of the Canadians I know to do that, we'd actually have to go out of our way...know what I mean? Why do Americans make fast food choices more than Canadians and Euros? Is it because they work longer hours, commute farther, have less free time and way more disposable income? Is it because fast food is actually (from what I remember about pricing) cheaper than cooking at home?"

 This sure is a hot topic right now! I'm glad though, it's refreshing to know I'm not so weird. Bob is a pediatrician, and--notably a high standard to parent to--the son of Dr. William Sears and Martha Sears RN, the authors of the famous Sears baby series. He doesn't know he blogs, but he does, and in this entry he's talking about his kid loving the super healthy (it's the same smoothie we eat for breakfast basically, but we don't use honey--fruit makes it plenty sweet) smoothie that most adults would turn their noses at. urlLink Diary of a Third Time Dad : "Why does he drink it? Because daddy does, and so do his brothers (without the flax meal (I use flax oil instead), oat, soy and peanut butter). If you model it for your kids, they will (or may) do it. Another way we model good eating is in restaurants. Every kid’s meal comes with French fries. We always now substitute fruit. Well, the other night we forgot, and the little guy picked up a fry to chew on. Cheryl thought it was cute and got my attention. When I saw what he was doing, I said, “EEEWWW, Yuk yuk!” He took it out of his mouth, looked at it, put it down and didn’t try any more. Whew! That was close. I also took him out to lunch the other day, and what did he have? Turkey, avocado, cream cheese, lettuce, and tomato on squaw bread. He couldn’t get enough of it! Just so you all know that he isn’t perfect EVERY day, yesterday he was being very “two” all day long, and Cheryl said “THIS is the stuff that people forget about when they decide to have more kids!”

 urlLink DotMoms: Dangerously bad advice : "The moral is: When someone tells you they got advice from their 'doctor,' you take it with a healthy shake of salt." These words come from Marcia, care of urlLink DotMoms , who is discussing her reaction to advice given my Egyptians (she lives there) that doesn't jive with her American experience. I sympathize so deeply with her feelings, and for me, it has nothing to do with Egypt! Often, it's age. I'm in my mid-twenties, and all the moms around me are in their thirties and forties, which seems to give them the impression they're better equipped. If anything I think it's the opposite, but I've never said that. I just do what one of Marcia's commenters recommended: nod and split. I find myself balancing the need for social appropriateness with a desire to say, "what are you talking about? you give your child fast food and sweets!" Juice. That's a big issue that grinds me. Juice is almost completely devoid of the micronutrients that truly make its source berries a healthful bazaar. Instead, this stuff is just sugar and water. Parents all around me can't take their kids anywhere without a cup of juice, though. I think they're bribing their kids to stay hydrated, when if they'd lay off the juice, the kid would learn to love water for the taste as well as the hydration. And sugar. People can't understand why I'm such a strict mom about sugar. The only ones I have to be strict with is these other people though, because if you never give a child sugary foods, they don't ask for it. But I still get snide remarks like, "by my age, I've learned to relax a lot more about little things." Arrg! But back to Marcia, I've got a fun book called How to Raise Healthy Child in Spite of your Doctor . In some places, it goes further than I do, but in many, it's nice to be backed up re. my strong ideals. Antibiotics are almost never appropriate. Children's bodies are fantastically resilient if they're left to do their thing. If it weren't so, the species never would have survived!

 Tonight when John got home from work, he opened a bag of tortilla chips and a tub of green Chile humus. The kids did their typical swarm around any food item, so he doled out bites. Aidan practically gagged on his, then went back to his apple (which he'd lost interest in until Ellie took a bite of it), and Ellie ate hers up and begged for more. Now she's a humus monster. To appreciate how odd this is, you have to understand just how little she'll eat. So far, things she likes are: lox, bagels (and lox bagels), terragon chicken, Annie's mac or pasta, tomatoes, vanilla soy yogurt, baked potato with yogurt, whole apples, cheese, scrambled eggs, whole banana That's about it. Even the items on this list are only usually acceptable, and then only in short quantities, except the pasta, which she'll eat without ceasing. Note that baby food is not on that list. She can't stand the stuff. Mushed carrots, sweet potatoes, Whole Earth baby spaghetti were all favorites of Aidan, but Ellie won't touch them. To this day, though, Aidan eats almost anything in huge quantities (except humus, clearly). He eats as big servings as John or I do at each meal. It's getting expensive, and I have a feeling he'll be overtaking us in food consumption very soon! Ellie still gets the overwhelming majority of her calories from breastmilk, which, at nearly 13 months, is surprising to me. I try extra hard to eat a wide variety of foods to be sure she gets nutrients, and she keeps growing so I guess she's fine. But man, is she picky. Or selective. She knows what she likes. Oh hell, I have a few more months before I have to articulate the positive spin.

 SprogBlog fans meet urlLink Lori of E-Scout . I found her through dotmoms, which I found through mom in the mirror. I have _so_ much in common with her! We're both young, liberal moms living in the south (she's in Oklahoma) despite our ideologies. We both just got TiVo, and we both find it perfect for living with young children, see: urlLink E-Scout : "We just got it installed yesterday and have only watched a Meet the Press and Dora the Explorer. (Another reason to get it is that we can have five or six different shows -- educational, mind you -- saved for Em. She doesn't have to choose from the videos she's seen again and again and JoJo's Circus, which happens to be on in her allotted 15 minutes of TV in the morning. I'm actually planning to research quality preschool programs; I know there's stuff out there I'm unaware of because we let her watch so little. Animal shows, here we come.) But in just a bit, Emma will roll into bed and we can start watching Sex and the City ... 10 minutes after it starts. We don't have to wait until the whole show is done."

 My camera is broken, and I don't have a camera phone, so there was no way to document what happened other than here. It was so beautiful. My little Ellie was playing sweetly on the big floor throw pillow next to the couch where I sat with my computer and channel flipped between Ellen and Sharon. What a morning for daytime TV! First, on Ellen, Melissa Ethridge sang. I've always loved her, and she just keeps getting better. When she plays her guitar and sings so hard, she really rocks! Ellie took notice, she loves music, and I've documented here before her penchant for singing along with the TV rockstars, but she didn't really stop playing. Then, I switched over to Sharon, where Cyndi Lauper sang her interpretation of At Last. Oh my God, the lungs that woman has! And her voice is still true, probably truer, as ever. Ellie dropped the toys and watched with her mouth open. She didn't even sing with the TV like she usually does, she just gaped in admiration. And what's not to love? These two women both are fantastic heroes for girls and women alike. I think Ellie's musical taste is already exquisite. I rewound the song so Ellie could lavish in her conversion. I know how she feels! Cyndi affected me just as deeply when I was young. There's a spot in a girl's heart that only a freely expressive woman with a spunky personality can reach, and if that spot gets reached, she will never be the same. I was Cyndi Lauper for Halloween in the forth grade. I don't think I ever took the costume off! The forth grade was a pretty important time for me. That was also the year I wrote my first short story and decided I wanted to be a writer for the rest of my life. And today that buck was passed. I was there for the moment, I saw it in her eyes. Our Ellie is a changed woman, watch out world! She's a Cyndi Lauper fan, now!

 I've desired for some time to visit a meeting at the nearby Society of Friends meeting house. The biggest reason I haven't is that I didn't know if I'd have to book a sitter, or if children are welcome. I was happy, then, to come across this explanation. urlLink Quaker FAQ : "Subject: (3.3) Children at Meeting for Worship Many visitors to meeting, especially those to unprogrammed or silent meetings, worry a lot about their children and whether the children are being quiet enough. They should relax :-). While it would be appropriate to take your child out of meeting if the child is screaming or being noisy for long periods, the occasional noises of small children are generally welcomed. Some paper and crayons, or a book to read for older children is often helpful, too. Most children, especially those of visitors, have a tough time sitting silently for a full hour. Fortunately most Meetings have some sort of 'First Day School' or 'Sunday school' for children. If you see an adult rising after the start of Meeting and all the children filing out, they're probably headed for the First Day School. Friends are generally quite tolerant of babies and their noises. It should be considered normal at most unprogrammed meetings to breast feed babies during meeting."

I can use this and truly improve this world. I'm not at all sure where to begin, but maybe I'll find the how if I keep looking."

 I forgot to announce in this blog that I found out a few weeks ago that an old friend I grew up with in Santa Fe is also expecting! J.W. and Stephanie Betts are pregnant with their first child! I'm so happy for all my friends and their growing families.

 My cousin Shannon had a beautiful little boy! Congratulations go to Shannon and Jack for the fantastic creation, and especially to Sean Francis on becoming a big brother!

 How ironic that urlLink I spent Saturday worrying about what I could do without my kids that would be fun enough to merit spending hours away from them and paying for the baby sitter, only to enjoy my Sunday so much. That's how my new datenight standard was born: sitter worthiness. Deep down, I think we all have our whatever worthy, that precious thing we savor and meter out only after stingy consideration. A standard that sets our own personal bar. Elaine had spongeworthy, I've got sitter worthy. And in case you're wondering, urlLink it was. But then, I spent yesterday all day with the kids, and enjoyed myself--more?--for free! John finally installed Ella's bike seat, so we went bike riding through the park (whatever you're supposed to call eastern Memorial) with the kids on the back of the bikes. We stopped at the swings for a while, played Laura Anders running down the hill. On the way back, I fell. The good news is the little cocoon-shaped bike seat did a great job protecting Ella. No part of her touched the ground, she stayed firmly suspended--if suddenly sideways--in the five-point harness (glad we put her in the newer, more expensive model!). I braced most of the jolt with my wrist, then elbow, then shoulder, which I'm paying for today with soreness. But all in all, no harm done, and now I can lay my fear of falling with her on the bike to rest after seeing it was no biggie. The next time I'm at some playdate and somebody says aren't you too afraid of falling to ride with your kids (and that's come up a number of times), I can say, no, I fell once and everything was fine. The other positive side of it is that now, as Aidan is learning to ride his bike, we have a new illustration for what to do when you fall. Just get back up and say I'm all right (if he's following my example, of course, there's an intermediate step of quickly and frantically checking his baby sister for injury!). But back to the life lesson, I feel grateful that we never feel the need to escape our kids. Aidan's little morning pre-school along with the one or two afternoons a week I get to myself, thanks to Yolanda, are enough to quell the frantic feelings. I just want to spend every moment with them, as a family. I don't want to vacation without them, even overnight. A restaurant or movie is fun now and then, but I think I'll even stick to the urlLink crybaby matinees for a while.

 urlLink likeababy: a pregnancy, a baby, a family : "Babies should come with a warning. Something like: 'Overuse of this product has been linked to vision loss, saggy boobage, loss of memory, and tendency to repeat the word 'poops' on a daily basis.'"

 Hah. that title sounds like my family! But alas, I'm being literal. Friends Leeward and Marianne must be close to the big lifeleap of babyhood because apparently last week they went couple surfing together and urlLink found this site . They fell over laughing as they later recounted their adventures to me, wondering if I'd heard of the big left boob club, a club dedicated to women whose left one is bigger, because usually it's the right that ends up bigger. Do you have any idea of how many porn sites I had to sift through to find the link to the site they meant! Just try searching on big left breast and you'll know. Apparently it all began when Marianne wanted to know if she'd have bigger breasts after she had children. I pointed her to urlLink this prior entry on my own site. Sorry, chickie.

 Leslie is a newly pregnant woman who urlLink commented on Gina B's Mom-Blog : "Oh, God. You mean it gets worse? I'm ONLY five weeks pregnant (just found out YESTERDAY and we're not really telling people yet so this is all very hush hush) but I HAVE to talk to someone about it. My poor husband. I'm SO TIRED. I mean TIRED. Like PASS OUT tired. And then I think terrible things. Like what if I have to poop really hard and I push the baby out? What if I lift weights (the Doc said it's ok) but I pull my innards and the kid aborts? Why can't I sleep at night? And I pee constantly. I'm already emotional, moody, tired, and having a hard time sharing my body. I'm worried about what kind of mom *I'LL* make." Gina and I have been passing around a discussion on the difficulties of mom-hood, and Leslie's comments are in response to gina's most recent post. Also poignant on this topic is urlLink Gwen's recent experience of juggling her kids with her very limited days off. Her story pierced my heart. This stuff really is hard, and the system doesn't make it any easier. I think becoming a mother (and this probably holds for most dads, too) expands your bell curve of emotions. You feel more tired than you ever thought a human could endure, but you also feel more ability to endure that fatigue. You feel the deepest sadnesses and angriest rages, but you never belly laughed so hard and often in your life as you do when you're a mom. Life as a parent is like regular life, times ten. I guess that starts pretty early.

 A few days ago I shared the fantastic news that friends urlLink Neal and Amy Locke are pregnant, almost through their miserable first trimester. As a welcome to my club present, I sent them Dr. and Mrs. Sears' urlLink The Pregnancy Book , which is the gateway book into the Sears' urlLink fantastic series . This morning I got a nice email from the Lockes thanking me for buying them this book instead of yet another copy of What to Expect When You're Expecting . I can't tell you how much this warmed my heart! I personally thought What to Expect was hideous. In my book reviews articles, I actually did a set on worst pregnancy books, in which this book tied for top with Iovene's Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy . At first, I thought What to Expect was not that bad, but rather purely encyclopedic instead of the narrative tone I preferred to guide me through the pregnancies. After delving into it more deeply,however, I have to say this book is a propaganda tool of medical practitioners everywhere who want to encourage the whole woman as victim identity through this otherwise most natural (rather than medical) life event. All the advice could boil down to if this, this, or this happens, call your doctor or go see them asap. I prefer a book that encourages women to feel comfortable and curious about the big changes they feel and see. Pregnancy is a wild ride, a great adventure, not a medical procedure! This huge experience should empower women to believe in themselves and trust their body. America's medical profession is slowly warming up to this idea. UNM Hospital offers a dula to every women that gives birth there. My cousin Bridgette was taught the hip dance in her prenatal class, whereas I'd only read about it in Sheila Kitzinger's books. The old school doctors don't want to see women up and dancing, but rather laying down and saying yes sir. Know that I had both my babies in hospitals, and am grateful for modern medicine. But let's be honest, doctors and nurses could stand to err a little on the trust your body side of things. What to Expect was written by a nurse who clearly never questioned the system even once. Questioning the system, or in parenting terms, developing your reflective sense of self, has proven to be a pretty important key for development of the individual. What should we think then about professions that don't value this skill? That aren't willing to put their paradigm on the sacrificial stone, if you will, and see how it looks? Lacking. If What to Expect When You're Expecting is truly being honest, upon opening the first page one would read "expect to want to throw this book in the trash." That's exactly what parents should do upon receiving it from their doctor or friend or well-meaning parent who saw the book on the morning show and thought it would make a good gift. Don't give it away, it's more a disservice than charity. Just throw it in recycling. Finally, so I'm not being too narrow minded toward Dr. Sears, other great intro to parenting books include What's Going on in There by urlLink Lise Eliot , Rediscovering Birth by urlLink Sheila Kitzinger (I haven't yet read her newest, but this was great), and the Natural Baby by Janet Balaskas.

 urlLink Aidan as the donkey in the Cross of the Hills Christmas Pageant

 I don't think Gina B at Mom-Blog is saying she has postpartum depression, but her writing is poignant when read next to Lisa of Cadence 90 (below). Parenting is so hard! Mothering, in the most traditional sense, is even harder because it so often involves isolating women from the world of peer interaction and public recognition. Thank God for blogging! urlLink Mom-Blog : "I'm sad. I'm always sad, I EXCEL in sad. I don't honestly know how I ended up with such a happy baby, except that I know that God has a great sense of humor...the best, considering He invented it. Every time I try to pull myself up by my bootstraps, The Shit caves in. Then I sit around morose and TV talks to me. It's been a rotten rotten couple of weeks, I can't even begin to describe."

 urlLink cadence90 : "At the time, I didn't talk to anybody about it, because I felt ashamed that having a baby had not exactly blessed me with happiness, inner peace, and fulfillment -- in fact, I felt like my head was a bad neighborhood that it was better not to go into alone. Like everybody else, I had heard of postpartum depression, but it never occurred to me that I had it. I mean, when you're depressed you should feel like listening to blues albums and staying in bed, right? Yet I felt really agitated; I couldn't sleep, and I had no interest in food. I felt like Lou Reed at the end of a speed jag. And it didn't go away after a few days, or a few weeks, or even a few months. Finally, I steeled myself to talk to my doctor about it, willing myself not to fall apart in his examining room. What finally got me to go was that I had been surreptitiously doing a little research online to try to figure out what was wrong with me, and I was starting to understand that maybe I did have postpartum depression, even though it didn't fit my preconcieved notion of what depression looked like. Then I read a study that said that the infants of depressed mothers showed delays in cognitive development."

 You need to make a rubber mat mirror. Parents know to put their infants down on their tummies now as often as possible during the awake hours. The black and white play mat makes a nice thing for the babies to look at while down there, but a mirror reflection would be great for variety. I always propped up a clunky bathroom mirror on the floor for that kissy face stage, but with it's heaviness and sharp edges, guests always gasped. A rubber mat could be hung on the door later for baby's sit up stage.

 In Janet Balaskas' _The Natural Baby_, she says: "try to accept a degree of chaos as your child gets more adventurous. A somewhat untidy household is far more interesting and stimulating for your baby." Well, Janet, our house should be a veritable lamaz theme park, if that's the case!

 urlLink what if I want to wean? : "A former U.S. Surgeon General said, 'it is the lucky baby... that nurses to age two.' IF YOUR CHILD WEANS WHEN SHE IS READY, you can feel confident that you have met your baby's physical and emotional needs in a very normal, healthy way. In cultures where there is no pressure to wean, children tend to nurse for at least two years. The World Health Organization and UNICEF strongly encourage breastfeeding through toddlerhood: 'Breastmilk is an important source of energy and protein, and helps to protect against disease during the child's second year of life.' "

 shout out tonight goes to our good buddies Neal and Amy who took their sweet time announcing the coming mini-locke, due September 8! We're so happy for you, guys!

 my son demonstrated empathy this morning! He accidentally scratched me with his fingernails when he jumped in my bed to cuddle. I said ouch, like I usually do in order to indicate his cue to say I'm sorry, and instead he said, "where did I scratch you? Here?" and I said yes. He earnestly said "poor mama" and kissed the spot! I've read in research, and heard from fellow parents of school aged children that empathy isn't one of the easiest goals to attain. I'm so excited to see early signs of it in my three-year-old!

 My baby girl is teaching me multitudes about how very different children can be. In every imaginable way, she is a completely different child than her brother. I want to be sure to celebrate her individuality, rather than tease her for it or even accidentally give her the idea I wish she was like her brother. I want our family to help me tow this line, too. Aidan has always been the happy-go-lucky, amiable child. The things in life that he desires are the very things that make adults happy to see a child desire. He loves to cuddle in your lap, or to build something alongside you. He'll look at you with his giant kacky-green eyes, smile sweetly, and say "I love you" and melt your heart. Converseley, the things in life that Ellie desires are typically self motivated developmental and gross motor advances. She's working so hard, in almost every minute of the day, to achieve. As her mama, I love seeing her efforts. But I'm also aware that they don't illicit the grown-ups' smiles very often. This morning as Aidan and I played on SesameStreet.com (on his new Mac!), John and Ellie played with Legos in the other room. She put two legos together all by herself! After a bit of play, though, she pointed to her sheepskin and John said he felt like she was saying she wanted to go to bed. So I came in and loved her up, then set her in her bed on the sheepskin and said night-night, curious and hopeful that she had decided, all by herself, to sleep. She laid her head down for a few seconds, then sat up and fidgeted for a minute, then called us back to her with mamas and dadas. I picked her up and took her to nurse to sleep, but that too disparaged her so John picked her up and held her as he cooked. Before he could even finish cutting (with one hand, the talented devil!) the mushroom patties, she was asleep against his chest.

 As a Christian mother trying to raise children with a sense of reverence and spirituality, I strive to find ways to make religion relevant to my 3 year-old's life, and maybe even to my 1 year-old's. But as an anthropologist, and a liberal woman, I feel increasingly discouraged at the traditional image the Christian church presents for spirituality. The structure itself especially fails my children in giving them a sense that, even though God made everything beautifully in the universe, he somehow didn't make girls as special as boys. That's just shit. This morning my mom and I got into a long discussion about thinking reflectively. I started it by talking about my new book, The Beginner's Guide to Zen Buddhism , which I bought after my gateway book, Buddhist Reflections on Everyday Life , gave me so much fulfillment. I began my delving into Buddhism last year while seeking out ways of calming my crazy new mother of two brain. Since then, I have found Zen meditation to be a remarkable source of self reflection, which hence breeds calm by teaching you to isolate thoughts as they fly through your brain and deal with them, whereas they might otherwise turn directly into worry or stress. I keep thinking about the benefits of knowing oneself, of controlling the chaos of thoughts in your brain to better direct them. I love the focus on self awareness, and I can't believe the whole world doesn't embrace this! I think many religions of the world initially did. I think that must have been either the focus or the inevitable outcome of the Native American vision quest. I'm left to wonder--and this is the question I brought to my mother--if Judaism also focused once on knowing oneself, somehow ceremoniously. Christianity now focusses so much on prayer, where your meditative time is directed at knowing God or, more typically, complaining to God. I regret that this focus is not more directed on self discovery. She brought up the group that John the Baptist belonged to, men who denied themselves almost all foods and certainly sex, and Jesus' foray into the desert for 40 days. Those certainly were examples of ritualizing self discovery. If it was once in Christianity's roots, I feel like it's absent now. And I feel sad that the dominant religion of the western world doesn't value self reflection. Our culture has certainly suffered in its absence. I find myself then in this strange place where on the grounds of theology alone I am a Christian, and in practice, I'm somewhat eclectic. We did go to that one church once, urlLink Ecclesia , that spent a good part of the message time free associating a la call and response about a psalm. But then I later discovered that Ecclesia doesn't let women be Deacons (whatever archaic form of religious governing that even is!) or head pastors. And that, too, is just shit. Maybe we should try the Friends, since they don't believe in having any one leader, whether or not women can be leaders is a non-issue! I've found a fellow ecclectic practicer in an unlikely place. urlLink Brother David Steindl-Rast is a Benedictine Monk who spent enlightening years studying with Zen monks. He's found remarkable similarities between the disciplines of worship between the two religions. Most importantly, he's built on a dialogue between the two that help both discover themselves along with their spirituality. I first heard him on this New Dimensions re-broadcast from 1990, and I couldn't believe his words, which sounded so appropriate to the present, were actually 14 years old. You can listen to that program urlLink by clicking here . Similarly, urlLink Mothering Magazine ran urlLink an article earlier this year written by a mother who had learned to adapt her Zen mediation for breastfeeding. When I first read the article, I didn't understand her angle. Since then, I've read enough on Zen mediation to understand the vital imporance of breathing, and the article is a recurrent joy to me!

 Yesterday was the anniversary of the tragic upper atmosphere destruction of the Space Shuttle Columbia. Throughout the week, and especially yesterday, many memorials were held. I found myself taking the most away from an unlikely one, in which an NFL announcer interviewed the families for a memorial in the pre-game show. The families' interviews helped me understand the conflicting emotions I had this past week when my son was injured and my husband was away on work, and yet I wanted him to be here immediately. As my father-in-law put it, "if he wants to go to Mars, then he should be able to handle two weeks in California." But watching the families, I realized that space families hold together closer because they know they won't always be able to. The fathers and mothers that died onboard Columbia had been extraordinarily close to their children, they'd been there for everything , as long as they were on the same planet. As it turned out, we didn't have to make the difficult decision of whether or not John should abandon his two-week training and come home for Aidan's mouth injury because John's bosses agreed flying him home for the weekend was cheaper than paying for the training all over again. I felt so proud of his division for standing behind their family first promises I've heard at every pic-nic and party. If John ever gets that amazing opportunity to go to space, we'll be lucky that the kids won't be young anymore. For now, they are young, and I'm confident that we're on the right path being there for every event, accident, and memory possible. We're following a long tradition of space families making the most of life here on Earth.

 Well, five days post fall, and Aidan's swelling is almost completely gone. The teeth also look better. While the ones pushed upward will take 2-4 months to come down (if they don't fall out, that is), the ones pushed back are less pushed back, maybe only 10 or 15 degrees back now compared to the initial forty-five. All involved teeth may still turn a dark shade, or even fall out, but only time will tell. I've been swabbing the teeth at night with cheese cloth in lieu of brushing, and spraying salt water on the gums with a nose hose (the infant bulb thing) since I thought there was no sensible way to get Aidan to gargle or swish it. His gums are a little swollen in the particularly hairy-looking spot today, I think I'll begin treating that with tea tree oil. I should have been making him drink green tea every day, since it prevents plaque build-up, but we're just starting that today. The thing that's improved his recovery most of all was his dad's return for the weekend, care of dad's bosses (thank you!). We all do so much better when our little family unit is together. Today, Aidan pointed his teeth out to me and explained, "this one's pushed back and this one's pushed up" just like I've done a myriad of times to all our well-wishers! I just have to say how grateful I am for our family support throughout this ordeal. My dad's quiet calm presence was invaluable, and Aunt Amanda showing up a few hours after the big toss with sticker books and a stuffed moose was also fantastic. My in-laws have called at least once every day to see how his (and my own) recovery progresses. In these days of progress, geography otherwise separates us from our natural support group. I'm so happy my family has found these ways around the miles between us.

 urlLink HealthWorld Online - Integrative Dentistry - Herbal Therapy in Dentistry This is a very thorough listing of herbs that ease or aleviate dental problems.

 urlLink DrWeil.com Question: Best Treatment for Teething? : "You’re correct that homeopathic Camilia has no adverse effects and is safe to use. Concentrations of herbs in the formula are too dilute to be of concern. In many infants, the process of teething is painless, causing only some increased drooling and a desire to chew. However, some infants develop tender, swollen gums, may not sleep and eat well, and may run a low fever (under 100 degrees). (A fever above 100 degrees or diarrhea suggests problems unrelated to teething.)"

 Today after I picked Aidan up from school, the various moms and dad (1 stay-at-home) agreed to go straight over to a near-by park for a playdate. I think everyone must get the late afternoon crazies like we do, because everyone gleefully lingered. We were one of the last to leave, granted, but we stayed until 5! Ellie and Aidan played their little hearts out. I got to know some of the parents of his friends, which was nice. It's strange to me that my child is so close with people I don't know. I grew up in a very small, rural town (Tucumcari, NM) where everyone knew everyone. Knows --they still do. One of the moms, Janet will give birth to a baby girl before we see her again! So lift a glass for Janet and family on Friday!

 I remember the morning of February 1, 2003, when the space shuttle broke apart in the upper Earth atmosphere. I sat up in bed as John rushed in and turned on CNN. He said, "something's wrong with the space shuttle!" Ellie still slept beside me, oblivious to the sadness and horror, nearly exactly over our heads. My mind filled with the thought: everything's changing . Granted, everything's always changing, but sometimes you can see it coming. As we continue to live through all the ripples of change from that day, that thought still echoes in my head. This morning I'm again captured by these words. There's this baby that's in need of a safe place. The mom knows me, and I think she might trust us with the awesome obligation of watching over her little one. Nothing changes a world like a baby. In my life, I've never felt so great as when I hold a baby, gaze into his or her eyes, and bond. I have so many questions. Will it happen? The chances are so crazy slim, should I even be writing about it? Is this the wrong way for our friends and family to know what might or might not happen? Should I prepare? Well, I certainly learned through two children already that babies need very little preparation. We're made to do it in a forest. Still, I have all the equipment. How do you throw your entire being into loving a baby if part of your mind has to instruct you that the baby could leave at any minute? Maybe that's not such a hard question. After all, I throw my entire being into loving and nurturing Aidan and Ellie all the time, knowing only God knows how long I'll have them. It's similar to our decision of whether to announce my pregnancy with Ellie after we miscarried Grace. We decided to announce early, because even if we lost this baby too, we'd want the whole world to know there was a baby in our lives and we'd lost a child. How else could they celebrate her brief life? We can't shield ourselves from pain at the expense of love. If there's even a day that I get to love another child, that day will be an immeasurable gift. If another child comes to our little family, even for a little bit, the whole world should know so they can celebrate her with us!

 Well, it took until she was fourteen months old, but my baby girl is finally developing something of an appetite. Just today she scavenged a good quarter of my lox bagel, three or four bites of baby cereal in apple sauce (before the customary gagging and disinterest), the handful of blueberries I then cunningly buried in her cereal in an effort to push the iron, half a banana, four or so bites of last night's leftover pizza, a few slices of apple, and four or five bites of my yogurt. The scavenging is very effective in the calorie distribution between us. I've had to consume so many calories to maintain the milk supply that supports her growth in lieu of an appetite of her own, I think I probably eat seven or eight hundred extra calories a day. But now, as she begins to take up the load in caloric consumption, it works out rather nicely that she eats off my plate. She's literally transferring these units of energy from me, directly to her. I really wish she could find some way to enact a sleep transfer, too! Today she napped a grand total of thirty minutes, then woke up, never napping again all day. Thirty minutes is not a nap! It's a cruel tease. All this just highlights what a unique individual my wee one already is. At this age, her brother (I think like most kids out there) was still sleeping three or four hours a day in naps and was well on his way to eating near-adult portions of every food in the fridge. That standard of portion size, btw, is now achieved at three years old. And you can imagine that with my husband's superslim metabolism and my breastfeeding needs, an adult portion is pretty big in our house. I shudder to think of how much he'll be eating in another couple of years! Re. Ellie's uniquity, she's really something to admire. Her little personality effectively erases Locke's tabula raza theories. She was born herself . My constant struggle is to find the best way to raise someone born already raised!

 Back before we had kids, John and I dreamed about reading the classics to them. We've waited in anticipation for Aidan to get old enough to start _something_ with. Last time we drove to New Mexico (Thanksgiving, yes, it was really that long ago), I tried to start Rip van Winkle with no success. This trip, I embarked upon Little House on the Prairie to limited success. I should say, different success, because the breakthrough was my own. Laura's adventures are a little more action-packed so Aidan can pick up on a few more images. But I thought about the amazing research done by Children's Television Workshop that produced the break-through in children's programming first espoused by Blue's Clues. They found that not only do kids love to watch the same program a zillion times (I could have told them that, we just finished our 200th viewing of Nemo from San Antonio to Houston), but they actually gleam a deeper and different level of knowledge and understanding from each additional viewing. Based on this, I realized that I have to groom my child to listen to me read just as I groomed them both to watch TV. Like most parents reading this, we've always been huge readers to the kids. We endeavor to read every day at least once, preferably a few times. We don't read them to sleep after I sat through a lecture back in college where a researcher found that habit taught kids to get sleepy when reading rather than keep attention on the text. We sing to sleep, it's much more pleasant. Aidan's books have been getting a little bit longer, but they're still one-sitting start to finish. I'm hoping to read the same book, bit by bit, over weeks, and then embark upon the next in eager anticipation. After this start, I realize I'll probably be reading one book, then the next, then maybe another, but then returning to do them all again. John wants to do Narnia next. Having decided this was our hold-back, we've adjusted our visual for success from the kids paying perfect attention as we read to reading out loud, with the other parent modeling paying attention, and allowing the kids to be on the floor in front of us with quiet busywork (like coloring maybe). We hope that, in time, they'll pay more and more attention, until eventually, they listen in rapt anticipation. Reading the classics over and over will at least ensure we get a good handle on the text. I notice how intricately I can take apart Spirited Away, Power Puff Girls, or even Nemo (there's not much to take there, though) after seeing (mostly hearing) them so many times.

 Earlier we visited Hell, also known as Sonora, Texas. We typically don't stop in this very small town because, even though it's in the middle of nowhere, the local hunters support this economy enough that hotel, food, and gas prices are ridiculously high. But today we were all hungry and in need of gas long before San Antonio. We've learned through the multitudes of times we drove the fourteen hour trip to NM or the 13 hour trip to El Paso (as well as our adventures elsewhere) not to fall into the fastfood roadtrip trap. This morning we deviated from our healthy travel diets to eat at Wendy's. And we all paid with the sticky grease feeling on your tongue that you only recognize when you abstain from that stuff long enough, and with upset gastrointestinal tracts. So in Sonora we stopped by the local grocery store in search of a deli-made something. All the deli had was fried burritos, fried okra, and fried chicken so I settled for a tub of yogurt. If we were really hungry, I've found all groceries have those tuna-salad on crackers kits, but we just needed a snack. The best moment was when I was studying the dairy box and Aidan said in his too-loud kid voice, "mom, where's the soy milk?" The woman next to us turned on her heel and walked away, I almost fell over laughing. But where was the soy milk? Even the remotest towns we visit carry at least a few brands. Tucumcari, Farmington, even piddly Vernon, Texas always has something of the soy variety.

 egad, I just realized I left a pretty sparse and boring article up on my blog before leaving. If I'm going to stop blogging all of a sudden for a few days, I should at least leave interesting articles! We've been on vacation in Taos, and while I did find time and connections to blog, I did it on urlLink the other blog . Here's a summary of our trip: the drive was great, kids were great, getting here was fantastic. Then we found out our house was broken into back home and that sucked, but we got someone to come secure it (no broken windows, fortunately!) and called the insurance and police from here. Everyone was cool with waiting until next week for the details. Now we're in Santa Fe visiting family. We had a great hike through the Bandelier National Monument this morning. I'm further inspired toward my mission to spread the word about sustainable parenting after noticing the brilliant functional design of the dwellings, which must have made communal childraising a cynch. Sunburned and deliriously happy, we mark today with two anniversaries: John's and my first date nine years ago, and my bloggerversary one year ago. With both, I can't believe it's been so short a time. Memory makes me feel like it's always been the way it is right now. If there's a time to be stuck in, this is it. This trip has been just the prescription I needed to help me remember why I fell in love with my life in the first place. We're such a joyful, adventurous little family. We bump around in our little VW Golf, getting honks for our weird bumper stickers, I'm sure we're an odd sight ourselves! Our motto's always been "Happy on a Rock." Any rock, anywhere, we can find happiness. And we do. Happy Day Everyone!

 urlLink ZERO TO THREE: For Parents : "Here are some tips for play-dates: * Get together with other moms and dads to talk, laugh, and relax. It will be a fun break for you, and an opportunity for your baby to be around and watch other babies--one way they learn and explore. * Consider taking your toddler to the playground where other toddlers are playing on the gyms and in the sandboxes. Bring some old containers for your toddler to use and some extra ones for other toddlers. * Provide objects or toys that toddlers can use separately (books) as well as together (a toy cook set). Each type of play helps them develop new skills. * Watch how your child plays with another of the same age and also how he plays with a sibling or another friend who is a little older. You may see him repeating or practicing current skills with an age-mate and trying to model or learn new skills from a slightly older playmate. Repetition and imitation are both important for learning. * Encourage play among siblings if you have more than one child. Not only can they be great models and ready playmates...but long-term learning partners and friends."

 I'm going to be doing some research on children and competitive athletics, so for the next few days you'll probably be seeing a lot on the topic. Please feel free to share any articles or experiences you have.

 urlLink A.D.D. & A.D.H.D. : "Sports can be either a positive or a negative experience for A.D.D. children. Exercise helps them burn off excess energy, yet some teen sports can be frustrating because these children have difficulty listening and following the rules. After-school sports are especially valuable in allowing a child to release penned up anxiety at the end of a stressful academic day and to tire the child out so they are more mellow and easier to live with during family time in the late afternoon and evening. Here are some tips for matching child and sport"

 When Aidan was 20 months old, I took him to the Tuesday library program for the first time. It was awful. Aidan, not the program. He didn't know how to sit in a group of children (his age give or take six months) and pay attention to the leader. What was worse, he thought he was the leader. He would stand up rather than sit, face the group of kids, and do something funny to make them laugh, and they would. As I saw him become the distracting child in the room, visions of class clown replete with trips to the principal's office and parent-teacher meetings filled my head. Suddenly, the library program became vitally important to our family. I showed up early rather than right when the program started so he got the full experience of being herded into a sitting group. I sat next to him and enforced his sitting in the group, under threat of removal to the back of the room or bathroom for "timeout" if he didn't stay seated. Aidan's a fast learner, and under my imposed structure, he came to discover listening was more fun anyway. I hated risking over-structuring his participation in a fun activity, but I did it because I wanted Aidan to set his norm for lifetime participation in a classroom setting under my eye. The real lesson I took away was that I started too late with him. I should have had him in group settings earlier. I think if I had, it wouldn't have been an enforcement issue, but rather a more natural learning experience. So now that Ella is a year old, and in her social development bloom, I've started taking her to the library programs. I hope it works. The Montrose Library program really fell apart, so now I'm in search of a new branch. Today was my first time to go to the Heights, and I got swarmed by a few moms who seemed desperate for conversation. As one in particular talked to me, I thought to myself that this is how wide my eyes would be and how protruding my words would fall out if I didn't have blogs. Thank God for this one little social outlet. On my urlLink other blog , I've been discussing that the organizers of urlLink BloggerCon II didn't have any place in their conference for mom-blogs. It seems that, after being removed from functioning society in the real world, moms are being removed from it in the blogging world as well. How have we as a culture come to segregate childraising from other roles in our world so completely? Even at the library, I've noticed an overwhelming majority of moms (and nannies) who are foreign. I can only guess that their cultural upbringing taught them to trust public institutional offerings, especially for rearing children, while our own has taught us that public programming is for poor people. But children were never meant to be raised in isolation, and the otherwise suburb-induced, garage-style of child raising that makes blogs so valuable for moms everywhere, must also be affecting our children.

 Most public libraries here in Houston have a toddler/pre-school program on Tuesday mornings at 10:30. Some do it Wednesday instead. It's a nice way to introduce your kid to a no-stress, pre-school environment where everyone listens to the leader read a book (visions of the Simpson's Leader episode flood my head as I write that. It's a good thing, really!). Here's the link you can use to find out which libraries are doing what on a certain day. urlLink Houston Public Library Events : "Library Events by Date All events are free and open to the public"

 urlLink Move Over Joe Camel by John Borowski : "...Purveyors of liquid candy will use any gimmick to invade our public schools. “Swerve”, in its 11-ounce can, contains 52% milk and is artificially flavored with sucralose, a man-made chlorinated compound. 600 times sweeter than table sugar, this compound only had 19 studies done on it by the year 2000. Considering that pesticides are often made using chlorinated compounds, health advocates are worried. You should be too. As a teacher of children in an American school, I am deeply concerned. It’s an elaborate con. Coca-Cola has now become an official sponsor of the national PTA, and Coke’s vice president, John Downs, now holds a seat on the PTA’s board. Stunningly, this gives Coca Cola interests full voting rights! The PTA, our well regarded children’s health advocate, is a Trojan Horse, having enlisted itself as a lobbying springboard for this corporation with its dreams of flooding schools with their products, health concerns be damned. These Coca-Cola culprits have contracts with at least 6,000 of the nation’s 14,000 public school districts to sell its sugar & chemical drinks to children who are not prepared to make important dietary decisions for themselves. This is the same Coca-Cola that pays the Boy & Girls Clubs of America $60 million a year to ensure that only coke is sold in their 2,000 facilities nationwide. Coca-Cola has been instrumental in lobbying against the World Health Organization’s guidelines stating that it is not healthy for humans to ingest sugar as 10% of their diets..."

 I've never been a proponent of homeschooling, and I'm surrounded by homeschooling parents that I love and respect: neighbors, relatives, even my bio-dad and step-mom homeschool my young siblings. So in my desire to be openminded about their decisions, I continually look into the issue. I think I've come to a pretty accepting position on it, I believe all parents should be homeschoolers, and I plan to do my best to educate my children. But I also plan to augment my homeschooling with the added education, social interaction, and structure that only school can provide. Anyway, here is one more good article by a homeschooling mom that demonstrates the fantastic way homeschoolers integrate learning into every moment of the day. urlLink Mothering Magazine -- Crazy for Calculating!

 urlLink Mothering Magazine -- No Time for Teaching: Spontaneous Learning at Home : "...There are only so many hours in a day and only a precious few years to be a child. In these days and years, children need time to play, time to leisurely observe and daydream, and time to choose what they want to do. The teacher in me might see such activities as unproductive, but they are very important in the development of a happy, healthy person. My short-lived curriculum was pushed aside in favor of more spontaneous interaction like talking to and having fun with my kids. I realized that my success as a mother was more dependent on the number of smiles and hugs I gave than on the amount of information I dispensed. Besides, the most teachable moments can't be planned for or regimented. They arise when my children spot a rainbow, ask where butterflies come from, or want to write a note to Grandma. It is in these moments that they are the most inquisitive and receptive to the knowledge I want to give them. Maternal guidance is a powerful teaching tool. Sometimes it's as purposeful as reading a book or counting crackers with my child. But most of the time it's incidental, as when we talk about the weather, the animals we see, and the color of our clothes..."

 urlLink College for the Home-Schooled Is Shaping Leaders for the Right : "...Patrick Henry College is the centerpiece of an effort to extend the home-schooling movement's influence beyond education to a broad range of conservative Christian issues like opposition to abortion, same-sex marriage and obscenity in the media. The legal defense association, located on the Patrick Henry campus, established the college as a forward base camp in the culture war, with the stated goal of training home-schooled Christian men and women 'who will lead our nation and shape our culture with timeless biblical values.' 'We are not home-schooling our kids just so they can read,' Mr. Farris said. 'The most common thing I hear is parents telling me they want their kids to be on the Supreme Court. And if we put enough kids in the farm system, some may get to the major leagues.' That is an alarming prospect to some on the left. 'Mike Farris is trying to train young people to get on a very right-wing political agenda,' said Nancy Keenan, the education policy director at People for the American Way, a liberal advocacy group, and a former Montana state superintendent of public education. The number of Patrick Henry interns in the White House 'scares me to death,' she said. 'It tells us a little bit more about the White House than it does about the kids.' Mingling in the corridors of the White House and Congress is also a long way from the sense of retreat at the heart of the Christian home-schooling movement. It began in the early 1980's as a few thousand evangelical Christians began teaching their children at home in disgust at what they considered the increasingly secular, relativistic and irreligious culture ascendant around them — exemplified by the ban on prayer, the teaching of evolution and the promotion of contraception in the public schools..."

 Back in September when Aidan started pre-school, the abundant advice (not so much advice as admonishment) given by everyone from neighbors to even my mom was that the mornings were going to turn into a crazed effort to get out of the door and into the car. One neighbor said every morning inevitably ends up seeing tears by her daughter, and often by her. I took the bus when I was little, so I think the pressure cooker waited until we saw Mrs. White (the White farm was next to our land, and we were accordingly Mrs. White's first pick-up) turn her bus lights on, at which point mad throwing on of shoes and stuffing of bags ensued. I love mornings. I hate waking up, I'm a chronic sleeper-in, but once I'm awake, I love to move slowly and greet the day detail by foggy detail. The perfect thing, then, to ruin mornings for me is to rush. Through school and college, and even much of my early career, I adapted to this aspect of my life well by taking getting ready out of the schedule. As long as I don't have to shower, and make-up is no more than a brush of mascara on each upper eye-lid, I could sleep as late as possible, and wake up just in time to dress and eat. I was convinced I could also adapt my children to my desires for rush-less mornings. I schemed and planned with this hope in mind. And to a large extent, I succeeded, but as you'll see, this system requires constant revision. The kids wake up and watch Sesame Street, while I sleep in. Elmo's World starts at a quarter to 8 and inevitably wakes me if a 1-year-old vs. 3-year-old squabble hasn't already erupted. Aidan has to eat before the end of Sesame Street in order to have enough time to dress the two and get out the door by 8:15, and to school at 8:30. Today, we got to school at 9, so you can guess what kind of morning we had. When we walked into his school, he melted away into the morning's last of a long chain of emotional break-downs. As I held his collapsed body by the hand and sternly said to stand up another mom said, "so you're having one of those days, too?" I asked if it was the 30 minutes late or the child on the floor that gave her that impression. She shared that this morning her son had peed his pants in front of her to attract her attention that was otherwise diverted to the phone for that minute. I let go of Aidan's arm and laughed. I said, "you win. That sucks. Peeing the pants is an automatic 15-minute deduction. I can't believe you're already here." Her baby in the arm-slung carseat looked heavy so she took her honor and left. This morning Aidan had emotional issues with every single step of getting ready: at taking off the shirt he slept in, at putting on the new shirt, at putting on the pants, and then, of course, the old stand-by's socks and shoes. For the first few, I doled out punishments, and then I just started throwing clothes onto him as all the while, Ellie clung to my leg like a horny dog chanting mamamamama. Going out to the car, he stepped into a puddle, and guess what! Emotional disaster! So by the time I arrived at his school and he laid on the floor feeling whatever imagined pressure walking through the door must impart, I was less than sympathetic. Do I sound crass? Welcome to Friday Syndrome. This is kind of like the way your bladder knows when you're close to home on a long road trip. All week long, I pour myself out. I don't hold anything back, it goes primarily to the two kids, but some goes to my husband and family, and a tiny bit goes to my writing. Then, by Friday, I'm all poured out. I'm empty. I dig deep to still smile at Mr. Wind's latest adventures as told by my son, and I have to dig even deeper to ask in the chipperest voice: "do you want your sandwich to be triangles or rectangles today?" From some unknown source of energy, I find strength to open my arms and say, "Of course I'd love to hold you on my lap while I go potty, sweetie!" Maybe I'm shortchanging stay-at-home or work-at-home dads here, but I don't think any man has ever dug this deep into his reservoir. If a man scratches this surface, you get Angry Man-styled break-downs. You get serious wacked out aberrations from sanity. But for a mom? You get an extra hour of Nickelodian after school, because it's a slight drop in values and dad's bus will get home soon. Speaking of dad, from now on, he'll be waking up in time to dress Aidan before leaving to catch the bus.

 This week Aidan's had a phantom fever off and on. It's been as high as 104, but typically more like 101 or 102. No other symptoms, plays well, acts happy, but burning up to the touch. He still hasn't brought in all his two-year molars, so it could be teeth. Aidan always did get high fevers with his teeth. A literature study in my childhood medicine books reveals that it could also be urlLink Roseola , but we won't know until he's had the fever for five to seven days, at which time he'll get a rash for a week or three, and no harm will be done by either the fever or the rash. It's mosquito season here in Houston, so a mom's mind easily goes to mosquito-born diseases. Fortunately, I researched those last summer and found that almost all of them, even the dreaded West Nile Virus, present themselves as little more than a cold for everyone but the very young or very old (the immune-compromised), the air-delivered insecticides urlLink the city is pumping out are actually a bigger health risk than the bugs themselves. So, whatever it is, I think it's harmless, and now we're just riding the wave of fevers. Having said that, I've learned a great deal about fevers. Back in the old days, fever itself was considered a disease. Now, it's understood to be an early immune response to a threat like a virus or bacteria. By elevating the body's temperature, the fever makes the body a poor environment for the invader to thrive and reproduce. This is why doctors now say to let a child's fever go untreated until it becomes a medical threat in itself, which is hardly ever. A child can safely have a fever of up to 107 before the temperature is a threat to the brain. Doctors interpret this by saying urlLink let the fever get to 101 or 102 before you treat it, but I felt I had a good enough handle on Aidan's fever that I didn't treat it with a fever reducer until 104, and that only happened one day. The rest of the time, we've depended upon peppermint and anise teas (sweetened with a little honey), boiled (then cooled) lemon water-soaked socks, and tepid baths (usually with sage and/or eucalyptus oil) any time the fever looked spiky. The teas promote perspiration, which is a gentle way to cool the body, the oils are calming and immuno-supportive, and the lemon water socks are a wives' tale that I've heard from two different cultures that works, despite not being understood. I appreciated these more subtle measures because I just wanted to bring it back down to the safe range, not obliterate it all together. The most interesting thing I've come across was the fever chapter in Aviva Jill Romm's Naturally Healthy Babies and Children. She points out that fever is now considered a stimulant for the immune system, and worries that the common practice of suppressing the body's natural immune responses such as treating fevers is contributing to the rise of autoimmune diseases. She goes on to say this: "Fever has another effect that often goes unnoticed. When children recover from a fever, they often demonstrate new skills and abilities. It is as if the heat of the fever served as a motivating developmental force. After a fever, a child frequently seems even stronger and healthier than before, as if impurities had been burned away, leaving the pure gold of the child's soul. While non of us wants our child to be ill, in our efforts to eradicate all illnesses with any means necessary, we have forgotten to see the subtler nature of the natural physical response." Romm is arguing that a fever is like your body's defrag tool! The kids have gone through a few fevers since I first read it, and I felt less afraid and more comfortable with their body's ability to handle its health simply from considering what Romm termed the subtler nature of the natural physical response. I try to remind myself that humans never would have survived as a species if our bodies weren't so good at healing themselves.

 urlLink cadence90 : "...We had an old missal -- a book that shows the services and readings for each day of the year in a Catholic church -- hanging around the house when I was growing up. At the top of each page, it said one of two things: ORDINARY TIME or EXTRAORDINARY TIME. I was never really sure what it meant but I liked it. Later as I grew up I stumbled across the Greek notions of kairos and chronos. Chronos is ordinary time. It's what your watch measures. Kairos is extroardinary time -- those expansive, luminous moments that change everything. It's a minute that lasts an hour, or a day that lasts a minute. When you have a baby you step onto a big unfurling ribbon of baby time. Night and day run together; what day it is hardly registers. Every day lasts a week, except that suddenly two months have gone by and your baby doesn't fit in newborn-size diapers anymore. I realize I generally know what day it is now. And this morning putting my shoes on I bend down and see my watch peeking out from under the nightstand. I fish it out and put it on. We have crash landed in Ordinary Time again."

 This NYT article is especially troubling considering HISD has molded their gifted "Vanguard" program into the college track program. Students are funneled through feeder patterns to schools that are more likely to offer AP classes and college preparatory counseling. For the weakening middle class, Houston's Vanguard program is the only way to send your child to public school and still hope for an upper tier college acceptance. urlLink Schools, Facing Tight Budgets, Leave Gifted Programs Behind : "Struggling with shrinking revenues and new federal mandates that focus on improving the test scores of the lowest-achieving pupils, Mountain Grove and many other school districts across the country have turned to cutting programs for their most promising students. 'Rural districts like us, we've been literally bleeding to death,' said Gary Tyrrell, assistant superintendent of the Mountain Grove School District, which has 1,550 students. The formula for cutting back in hard times was straightforward, if painful, Mr. Tyrrell said: Satisfy federal and state requirements first. Then, 'Do as much as we can for the majority and work on down.' Under that kind of a formula, programs for gifted and talented children have become especially vulnerable. Unlike services for disabled children, programs for gifted children have no single federal agency to track them. A survey by the National Association for Gifted Children found that 22 states did not contribute toward the costs of programs for gifted children, and five other states spent less than $250,000. Since that survey, released in 2002, the outlook for programs for the gifted has grown harsher. In Michigan, state aid for gifted students fell from more than $4 million a year to $250,000. Illinois, which was spending $19 million a year on programs for fast learners, eliminated state financing for them. New York was spending $14 million a year on education for the gifted but has now cut all money earmarked for gifted children, saying districts should pay for them out of block grants. Nearly one in four school districts in Connecticut have eliminated their programs for gifted students..."

 urlLink Colds & Flu - Children's Program : "A child’s body responds well to herbal medicines. Children are born with naturally well-developed immune systems; this resistance ability is a key factor in understanding childhood diseases. Kids often only require the subtle, body strengthening forces that herbs or homeopathic medicines supply. Highly focused allopathic medications can have drastic side effects on a small body. I find that children will drink herbal teas, take herbal drops, syrups and homeopathic medicines much more readily than you might think. The remedies and methods listed in this section are building, strengthening and non-traumatic to a child's system. Most herbal remedies may be taken as needed. Herbal effects can be quite specific; take the best formula for your particular need at the right time--rather than all the time--for optimum results. Rotating and alternating herbal combinations according to the changing health state of the child allows the body to remain most responsive to herbal effects. Reduce, then discontinue dosage as the problem improves--allowing the body to pick up its own work and bring its own vital forces into action. Take only one or two herbal combinations at the same time when working with a child’s system. Choose the herbal remedy that addresses the worst problem first. Alternate products to allow the body to thoroughly use the herbal properties. One of the bonuses of a natural healing program is the frequent discovery that other conditions were really complications of the first problem, and often take care of themselves as the body comes into balance. Let herbs gently rebuild health. Even when a good healing program is working, and improvement is being made, adding more of the remedy in order to speed healing can aggravate symptoms and bring about worse results!"

They also provide fiber and are one of the richest dietary sources of lignans, a class of phytoestrogens thought to help protect against breast, prostate and colon cancers. However, flaxseed isn’t as good a source of omega-3s as fish oil, which contains the pre-formed omega-3 s that the body needs. You should be able to find a pleasant tasting fish oil for children.

 urlLink BBC NEWS | Health | Atkins 'can put you in bad mood' : "A team from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has found carbohydrates help to stimulate production of a key brain chemical called serotonin. It controls our emotions, and a shortage can lead to mood swings and depression. The Atkins diet has become hugely popular despite concerns over its effect on health. Some experts are concerned about whether it might trigger diabetes and kidney damage in the long term. Researcher Dr Judith Wurtman said: 'When serotonin is made and becomes active in your brain, its effect on your appetite is to make you feel full before your stomach is stuffed and stretched. 'But serotonin is crucial not only to control your appetite and stop you from overeating; it's essential to keep your moods regulated.' Antidepressant medications are designed to make serotonin more active in the brain and extend that activity for longer periods of time to assist in regulating moods. Because carbohydrates raise serotonin levels naturally they effectively act like a natural tranquilizer. The MIT team discovered that the brain makes serotonin only after a person consumes sweet or starchy carbohydrates."

 Here's another entry in my endeavors to keep track of the kids' development. I'm happy and relieved to say that Eleanor is no longer (pardon my pun) walking the line between scooting and walking. She's now fully bipedal! She's so funny as a walking girl! I think she was really frustrated by her slow mobility and, as of the past few weeks, she began standing up and staying up, whereas previously she would take a step or two then hit the knees and take off on her knees. She walks around in circles and laughs at herself. With the development, Aidan's lost out on one of his biggest care taking duties: holding Ellie's hands and walking her around. I think he'll compensate. Ellie's crib is put away in the attic and she now has a real bed. It's big anyway--a full sized bed--but it looks huge with her sleeping in it. She actually spent one whole night in it last Monday, but since then it's been back to the 1 a.m. transfer to mom's bed. Why such a big bed for such a little girl? I wanted one bed in the house to be big enough for a visiting couple, I wanted the kids to be able to sleep together and cuddle on lonely nights. A full is just a foot or so wider than a twin anyway, and it'll still scoot under Aidan's loft bed. Speaking of Aidan's loft bed, it's found a new function as the only place Aidan can get some private time in our little house. His sister can already climb up to the second rung of the ladder though, so his private days are numbered. Hopefully she'll be old enough to understand respecting a person who wants to be alone by the time she can climb the whole ladder. Jumping off the ladder yesterday, Aidan seems to have caught his penis in some crevice and the poor thing is pretty bruised! I thought he'd been racked when he cried to me that he'd broke his penis. But after examination I realized it was the penis itself that was hurt. Boys sure seem to have a delicate appendage! But there's no keeping Aidan from jumping off things these days. He climbs the highest fencing around the playground now, and even jumped off the top of the twisty slide. Or carefully fell. I didn't see it too well. I keep thinking of the commercial that played during the olympics where the kid liked to jump off heights and his parents decided to encourage and direct it rather than squash it and he became a professional ski jumper. So I stifle my yelps and Aidan stops the hearts of all the parents at the park who are most worried their kid will follow his lead. Aidan's other big development is writing. He's getting very good at his letters, and he's good at making up letters when he doesn't know them. A,B,I,L, and T are pretty legible, but the others need some explanation. Either way, he's "writing" away and I love it!

 John and I have come to feel that we made a big mistake in our parenting method and now we're trying to rectify it. We always thought we'd treat the kids equally, on an equal level, and they'd both answer to us and never to each other. We never encouraged Aidan to hold Ellie, instead we tried to often hold them both on our laps together. I should also admit that I was always bothered by the sight of little girls nurturing dolls. My feelings regarding the nurturing desires of little girls first began to shift after studying instinctive mothering among humans in developed and primitive societies, as well as those of other primates. Socioanthropologist Sarah Blaffer Hrdy explained in Mother Nature that the mothering instinct is tied to social ambition necessarily because over thousands of years of human development, the children of women who were best able to position themselves in the culture group were most likely to be cared for, and thus survive. Where I used to fear these little mommies would never want more than a child out of life, now I feel that a child exploring her mothering desires goes hand in hand with preparing for an ambitious life. I was also greatly changed after reading what I now feel is one of the best parenting books ever--Margaret Mead's Coming of Age in Somoa --and now continuing on to Growing up in New Guinea . I really respect the method of letting older children mind the younger ones. Mead explains it as when a child gets just old enough to be so willful that they're driving everyone around them nuts (and this age correlates to five or six), they're saddled with the huge responsibility of minding a newly weaned (at 2 or 3) toddler. The society is structured so that kids want responsibilities, as that's the only way they get to take part in adult expeditions or be around adult cultural life. I think our society's automatic promotions based on age (like when you're 5 you go to school, when you're 7 you can be in scouts--or whatever) might be harming our kids who are wired to progress in behavior based on societal incentives. In lieu of incentives, what makes our children want to behave? Anyway, Aidan's now "in charge" of watching Ellie quite often, and he's blossomed in light of this new job. He's very caring. Yesterday at the park he jumped in front of a bullying kid and said "don't push my sister!" He's big enough now to go into the kitchen, get a cup, and fill it with water, which he does for her all the time. Remarkably, Ellie eats better when Aidan feeds her than when anyone else does. This was a big jump from our previous position in which he was never allowed to feed his sister food, for our fear that he would give her something dangerous. Ellie often just wants to sit in someone's lap, and now I've found an extra lap for her to cuddle in during Telletubbies or a book. When she's hurt, his response was often one of indifference and in our effort to teach him empathy we made him come take part in making her hurt better. That process is much more automatic now in him when he realizes he can actually make her better by himself. He wipes her tears and says, "that's all right, Ellie." I still catch him being indifferent sometimes, but we're working on it. I've always wondered at their very close relationship. Aidan spends more time with her than anyone, aside from me. She worships him, and it's very natural to me--after changing my point of view--that she responds so well to his care. The best expression I've gotten yet was on one of the first days we tried this. Aidan told me, "I'll take care of Ellie mom, you should go take a shower." I almost fell over laughing because when John's home that's my big treat. Since the peace only lasts about 10 to 15 minutes right now (b/f John or I are needed to settle some issue in Aidan's parenting tactics) we settled instead on Aidan watching Ellie while I laid down in my room to read my new New Yorker. It was still very nice.

 urlLink USNews.com: Adults are as scatterbrained as kids, and the disorder is rooted in basic biology (4/26/04) (via RebeccaBlood.net)

 S n L was a re-run this week and I only bothered to pay attention out of the corner of my ear as I blogged and surfed. I was happy to catch an hilarious ad-skit about thong diapers that don't look big and bulky under baby's clothes. The thing is, I love that idea! I hate how bulky they make my baby's bottom, and the way they always peak out over her pants. After Janet's performance last week and now this week, I think their writing is getting pretty good again (it waxes and wanes).

 We blogging parents know our way around the internet. Our kid coughs and within a few clicks we’ve realized there’s a high incidence of whooping cough this year (b/f you worry, I’m totally making this analogy up) and we should look for x and y symptoms to develop in the next 48 hours if that’s what they have. We know the typical complications and how long you can proceed with homecare before seeking the care of your pediatrician. It comes as no surprise then that every now and then we find ourselves getting a little trigger happy with the mouse button. We can easily work ourselves into anxiety with just enough “medical” information. I’m coming out. This happened to me, and I wasn’t alone. Apparently, urlLink two urlLink other mom bloggers were going through the exact same thing! The week before Christmas Ellie stood up and proceeded to take two big steps. urlLink I was so excited ! Aidan walked on the early side of the bell curve and she appeared to be following suit. The problem was, she did not continue to walk. Instead, she began scooting around on her knees. She was very fast and efficient with it, so I told myself that, aside from the worn out pants, no harm was being done. But I was worrying inside pretty bad. All the neighbors' kids were walking, and I'd seen my own son walk so early! urlLink Fueling my worry was the knowledge that Ellie had crawled really early, so was there a sudden environmental exposure that had urlLink halted her motorskill development ? Shouldn't she be running after her brother? I found myself re-reading Elise Eliot’s What’s Going on in There, the chapter titled Motor Milestones, and especially the subchapter titled How to Encourage a Baby’s Motor Development. I panicked when I read, “many studies have noted significant spurts in babies’ cognitive and social development following the onset of independent locomotion.” Moving quickly and easily around was clearly a catalyst of sorts to all sorts of non-motor development. I couldn’t then, nor was I ever able to find a source that discussed whether scooting sufficed for a catalyst, and whether taking two steps once in a blue moon, but otherwise scooting counted as having initiated walking. “ urlLink Normal ” development takes into consideration the rate that children already developed in a broad study of the American children’s population during some recent study. Children in developing countries tend to develop motor skills much earlier, and children in our own country whose genes are from parents from developing countries still tend to beat out their counterparts from European American genetic backgrounds. Some scientists theorize the strength stems from generations of mothers who pushed their children to walk because it made the child easier to raise, but I think Margaret Mead penned this one best when she discussed Somoan babies in Coming of Age in Somoa: “Their diminutive nurses [children charged with their oversight] do not encourage children to walk, as babies who can walk about are more complicated charges.” And indeed, I can vouch, much of a mother’s bliss becomes tarry when a child becomes mobile. It should be noted that in general the Somoans did not mark ages, even birthdays. So developmental advances weren’t waited upon either. I remember as I approached my first due date how angry I was to realize the date was set by the peak of a bell curve of all delivering mothers (subsequent pregnancies included) and first time mothers notoriously set the tail end of that curve. That the majority of births happened at 40 weeks didn’t mean at all that I should give birth by then, or on the date. Sure enough, I went late enough for induction. It was a crewel lesson in bell curves. As most parents who’ve done urlLink their e-research now know, our country’s bell curve urlLink for normal development peaks at 12 or 13 months, with a urlLink standard deviation of up to three months. This means the most kids studied walked at 12 or 13 months, but urlLink the vast majority walked between 9 and 16 months. urlLink This UK article says even 17 months is within the range of normal. If your child is among the 5% slowest walkers studied, or if your child hasn’t taken any steps at all by the end of 16 months, you’re likely to be sent to physical therapy by your doctor, where a specialist will assist those first steps. Most kids, including my own, urlLink are pigeon toed , or urlLink bow legged . This almost always stems from the awkward crisscross position they held in the womb during much of their development, and even continue to hold when sleeping in the fetal position. If the pigeon toed legs have knees that touch each other when the child stands, it might merit medical treatment, but otherwise, most kids grow out of it. If they’re still significantly pigeon toed by 18 months, your doctor might suggest sleeping braces. Regarding Ellie and the scooting, I was able to find situations where scooting bothered her. When she scooted her bare knees on the tree bark that softens the playground, she’d get annoyed enough to stand. Or when she tried to scoot in a dress, she’d get tripped enough to use feet and hands. I decided to make more of these obstacles in an effort to get her up and walking. In addition, we walked her around with our hands all the time. We experimented with hard and soft soled shoes, and barefoot and noticed no difference among any of them, aside from slipping on the wood floor in socks. Since we're a normally barefoot family, we ended up going with no shoes most of the time. I can never know if these measures had any effect, but I can happily say that in these past few weeks she’s knee-scooted less and less and actually walked around more and more. I think I can finally say yes when people ask if she's walking yet. Now nearing 16 months, she’ll help set the outliers of the bell curve, _if_ regularly walking is counted rather than initiated walking but didn’t rely on it. Who knows! We tried to make the best of her situation as months passed, we said she thinks we're all idiots for not walking her way, or we said it was an early indication of how individual she was. We got lots of shots of it on video b/c we could tell it would be a story we told and retold as she grew. I tried hard to celebrate her exactly as she was and not expect development according to normal. But I did fret an awful lot. At least I survived the wait, and if you’re still waiting, you’ll somehow survive it, too.

 here's the conclusions of the day's research on thyroid: First off, urlLink hypothyroid is pretty common. It means a person’s thyroid isn’t urlLink producing enough hormone. It can be an underlying contributing cause or an outright direct cause to a large number of health problems, including confusion in thoughts or nervous thinking, heart palpitations, heavy sweating, loose stools, weight loss, and serious fatigue. The medical powers that be recommend every adult over 35 get thyroid blood work done every few years. Sometimes when the body is aware that it needs more thyroid hormones, it enlarges the thyroid to up its production. This is called goiter. Goiter results in a full looking lower neck (the area between your collar bones and adams apple). The riskiest complication aside from the general poor health that can result from low thyroid is the development of nodules, which could (very rarely) be cancerous and therefore need to be biopsies. This seems similar to the way irritable bowel syndrome can develop into polyps, which can very rarely be cancerous. The thyroid doesn’t often go berserk for genetic reasons, it’s too important to human biology for thousands of years of human evolution to let that gene slip by. Instead, it’s susceptible to environmental effects. These range from literally the environment ( urlLink as contaminants often reduce or increase endocrine production in our bodies ), or the dietary minerals absorbed through food. The thyroid depends chiefly on iodine uptake through the diet. Dietary iodine occurs predominantly via ocean vegetables, ocean fish, and foods grown in iodine-rich soil. This last one is a problem for areas that have over farmed soil, and thus depleted the dirt of its minerals, and areas where the farming soil is very old in geologic terms. That means the most recent huge geological action was hundreds and thousands of years ago, and erosion is the primary geologic force since. Jagged mountain regions--such as the Himalayas or Rockies--are the best examples because in lower areas, floods renew the earth or at least erosion from the highlands does. (This makes me wonder if man-made flood prevention already has or maybe someday will make food from American soil deplete of vitamins and minerals. Hmm.) One kind of thyroid problem called urlLink Euthyroid goiter pops up at times of the life where giant hormonal changes are running amuck (read: puberty, pregnancy, menopause). Apparently, people living in hot climates, and people whose lifestyles cause them to sweat a lot are at additional risk for low iodine. It’s a new idea, but urlLink this paper makes a powerful argument . I caught on one correlation in its readings too that makes me also connect the two. Heart palpitations can be caused by an imbalance of electrolytes, and sweat is the chief cause of electrolyte imbalance in humans. Heart palpitations are also a common effect from low thyroid. One way governments combat low thyroid among the population is by advising (as the US gov’t does) or mandating ( urlLink as the Canadian gov’t does ) salt producers to iodize salt. Currently, 50-70% of the US population consumes iodized salt. Additionally, health organizations and governments alike have launched urlLink social marketing campains to push iodized salt use. Interestingly, our family had switched to kosher and French sea salt for aesthetic reasons (it tastes so good, you don’t need as much!). A friend of mine went to the doctor for low thyroid and was advised to avoid soy products. A huge percentage of the global population has relied on soy as a dietary foundation for so many generations, that I found myself seriously doubting the validity of the advice. Sure enough, I looked it up and found huge misconceptions regarding soy and thyroid. Anyone whose been through a pregnancy recently knows how important it is to avoid foods high in calcium (chiefly dairy products) around the time of day you take your prenatal vitamin. This is because some vitamin uptake, especially iron uptake, i inhibited by calcium. Iodine uptake is similarly affected by soy products. So while urlLink some irresponsible sources say the isoflavones that make soy one of nature’s most perfect foods are “potent anti-thyroid agents,” they should more accurately say that isoflavones interfere with your colon’s absorption of iodine, which your body needs to maintain a healthy thyroid. If your diet is already rich in sources of iodine, there is no worry. However, if you have reason to be concerned about your iodine levels, try to eat a source of iodine at least once a day when you haven’t consumed a soy product for an hour or two, and don’t plan to consume it for an hour or so longer. This harks to the underlying issue of variety in dietary consumption among Americans. If we ate sufficiently varied diets regularly, there would be nothing to worry about. We have to avoid food ruts. The groundwater should also be a source of iodine, but we drink carefully filtered water in an effort to avoid the harmful urlLink environmental polutants common in urlLink metropolitan , urlLink industrial , and urlLink agricultural areas. We're probably filtering out our minerals, too. Recently we began using storebought spring water for drinking (tea, water, etc) and using the fridge filtered water for cooking. The spring water is natural groundwater from sources too deep to typically be polluted, so it should solve both problems for us.

 I'll be sending my kids to school with soy to replace their dairy unless this type of change takes root. Considering the stronghold of subsidies, and considering my location, I have little hope. But I wonder what happened with this case? urlLink CNN.com - Food fight: Soy pushes for space in schools - Mar. 3, 2003 : "Soybean growers and the soy foods industry are pushing the government to reimburse schools that decide to offer soy milk as well as cow's milk. They say it is a healthy option, particularly for youngsters who have trouble digesting milk. Under current law, school districts can be reimbursed for soy milk or lactose-free milk only if a student has a doctor's note. Dairy farmers, who for years have held the beverage monopoly in the federal school lunch program, are resisting the change. They say nothing is as healthy as cow's milk with its calcium and vitamins A and D. The Senate Agriculture Committee plans to take up the issue Tuesday when it holds its first hearing on reauthorizing the National School Lunch Act, which subsidizes school meals."

 We've been living with the house AC set on 67 (70 when I really wimp out) for over a week now. I live in one of those neighborhoods where neighbors pop by all the time unexpected, so it's funniest when I see people's reaction to the family in sweaters when they come to the door in tank tops and shorts. I try to be polite, I offer them a sweater or a blanket, but they don't typically stay long enough when they hear our explanation for the temps. We're determined to battle the fleas without chemicals. John and I have lived chemical free for almost ten years now, with no bug sprays, insect repellant, it's even been years since I've used sun block. We did break down and use a small, hidden container of poison against kitchen aunts once, but that was still a chemical that didn't come into contact with our bodies. These fleas have been a cantankorous bunch. They're really trying our resolve! But we're nothing if not ideal-driven, and what sets ideals stronger than a good enemy? Fleas have lifecycles about three weeks long. They're extremely clever at surviving. In fact, I've come to think the flea will outlive the cockroach, species-wise. They don't waste energy, they only expend energy on things that will get them food or extend their lineage. They don't hop around even (chosing insidiously to lay still for hours or days even) until they sense a food host near, via carbon dioxide, warmth, and vibrations. The flea pupae won't hatch out of their eggs, and indeed an adult doesn't even like to lay eggs, unless temperature and humidity are above 70 degrees. So we use our house AC to fool them into stopping their own breeding cycle. This has given us an edge in the battle, but the war still wages on. We set pans of water under nightlights or with candles in their centers at night. The fleas think they are warm bodies and jump toward them and drown. Our wood floors are a big asset in the battle. They vaccuum and sweep pretty clean, you just have to be sure to empty the bag or dustpan outside so any eggs or fleas don't colonize in your trashcan. The best tool I use against them is duct tape. That's right, the world's most perfect invention has yet another use! I wrap a circle of it on itself sticky-side-out and use that to remove a flea I spot on me or the kids, since pinching it off doesn't kill it (they have amazingly hard and yet flexible exosceletons!). All the websites say babies will get the most bites, and I see why. Ellie is such a ball of energy (flea read: warmth and carbon dioxide) and vibrations (noisy and rough) that I can just follow her around on my hands and knees. She draws the hiding devils out and I snatch them up with my duct tape. Its best to keep myself and the kids dressed in longsleeves, pants, and socks to prevent bites, and in light colors so I can spot a flea on them right away. Lavender and tea tree oils irritate the fleas so I put lavender on their skin now and then, and we all use a teatree oil shampoo anyway, I think that helps. We're over half-way through the three weeks that would be the life-cycle we've attacked. I hope we win!

 John and I have always thought we were very clever for having our kids early, despite the social pressures we withstand now. Sometimes we joke that we waited too long, b/c we started dating when I was 17! I can only imagine how much more energy I'd have then for this. Nature agrees with us, as a woman's fertility peaks around 17 or 18. The difficulties of having a child now can easily be seen as attributes for the children (like our small house!). The strengths include our careers still being flexible b/c we're just taking off, our energy and adventurousness, our strong health. And I dare say a benefit Ms. Clanchy jokes about in this article, but I take seriously will be more time with my grandkids down the road. Kate Clanchy isn't proposing anything so ratical as societal acceptance of teenage parents, but she is taking a nice first step toward saying maybe all this putting off of parenthood isn't as helpful to women as we'd like to think. urlLink Guardian Unlimited | Guardian daily comment | Our parents were right after all : "'Universal childcare' is this generation of mothers' new mantra. 'Flexible working for all'. But no amount of child-care can square responsible parenting with Britain's ridiculously long and still-increasing office hours. Putting off childbearing allows a woman to behave just like men in their 20s, and so draws her into supporting the very culture which will exclude her if she later wants a family. What to do? In the short term, we might try blaming men for fertility problems. A good old-fashioned shout against patriarchy never did anyone any harm, and a little toothsucking and comments about withering sperm as bachelors pass us in corridors would be amusing, at least. In the long term, we might have to think about bringing up our children differently. So that they think of mothering and fathering as important jobs, not one person's chore, as a central part of life, not a lifestyle choice, as an adult adventure and responsibility, not something a conniving woman lands on a unfortunate bloke.

 I'm happy to see the US Food and Drug Administration warning against bug spray around children. They limit the dangers listed to breathing problems, but I've read in other good sources that many bug sprays are carcinogenic and can even cause brain damage. As annoying as insects and bugs can be, bug sprays are far more dangerous. urlLink Fighting Fleas and Ticks : "Common household fleas don't usually transmit diseases to pets and people. (See 'Human Problems.') The tiny insects are mainly 'just a nuisance,' says Marcia Larkins, D.V.M., chief of the companion and wildlife drugs branch in the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Veterinary Medicine. 'They generally cause a lot of itching and scratching. They may also cause some discomfort due to possible allergic flea bite dermatitis.'"

 Last night we decided to enjoy the extended daylight hour and John's renewed health (he says he caught a mean German flu abroad, he had the same cold I had last week. Men.) with a long walk to the bayou park along Memorial. When we arrived, we had the usual fun on the swings and then Aidan raced me up the big grass hills a few time. When I could take no more, I sent John in my stead. The boys disappeared over the top of the hill and Ellie soon tired of piling rocks so we set off in search of them. I found them on the terraced hillside we always used to teach Aidan climbing skills (before we realized he could already kick the rockwall's ass!). When I saw them, they were up higher on the hill and I was at the bottom by the banks of the Buffalo Bayou. The sun was just above and behind them, and floating dandelion spawns drifted around them in this surreal, sparkling light. They waved and tumbled their ways toward me, and their laughter beat them to Ellie's and my ears in trickling little spurts. They were probably the most beautiful site I've ever seen. Ellie and I plopped ourselves down in the grassy hillside and began picking wild daisies. Aidan, with John in tow, could not be so easily tamed and flew by en route to his newest adventure. As Ellie handed me each daisy she picked, I found my fingers responding to some latent genetic memory and within a few minutes, I'd tied her daisies together in my first ever daisychain! She kept picking them and I made her a crown of flowers. My recently stolen wedding jewelry came to mind, and it occurred to me that in lieu of handing it down to her, I'd love to make her wedding jewelry out of these woven flowers. In fact, I wish I'd used the flowers for my own wedding instead of the real jewelry, too! By the time John and Aidan came back I was ready to adorn them with necklaces and crowns of flowers and they wore them with joy and pride. I was so aware of the way our voices wove into the rushing water and even far away traffic sounds to make necklaces of the sounds of life that adorned us as the flowers did. I felt so happy with my beautiful family showered in beautiful flowers. We pranced our way back home, attracting many strange glances--it's funny how bothered people get in the presence of flowers! John made a quick tofu, jalapeno, and cucumber dish, which we joined with beer. The kids wound down for the night and we got back to the taxes. And our beauty still lingered.

 Blogging about your child who throws tantrums is tantamount to coming out of the parenting closet. Today, I'd like to share that my name is Annie and my daughter Eleanor has tantrums. They started sometime around her first birthday, and continue to occur a few times a week. They have the potential to take a deep emotional toll on both Eleanor and us-the-parents, but we all keep getting better at doing this with time. After raising Aidan through toddlerhood, I thought tantrums were fits. Ellie has taught me they're not. Fits are what I'd call it when Aidan would get really upset and lose his cool. Especially if we were in front of relatives or friends, fits would be very embarrassing. But they're pretty easily handled with a private moment taken between parent and child, and they are actually preventable with communication about consequences when we don't express our emotions appropriately (except imagine that whole conversation in kid talk with phrases like use your words and angry feelings ). I've heard child development specialists call tantrums disorganized moments, and, except for the absence of emotion in the event, the term does communicate what appears to occur in her brain during a tantrum. A tantrum is when crying over not understanding or being understood, being overstimulated, or a similarly difficult event rapidly escalates out of control. The child uses volume and violent bodily actions to express the overwhelming emotion that no words could ever express. Our tantrums happen most often at home rather than in public because only at home can Ellie release her shyness and fully interact with the world, a risk that consequently exposes her to the risk of a tantrum. As an adult, I know the danger of a depression episode is that scars can actually form in the synapses and leave a person more susceptible to depression from that time onward. Watching Ellie lose control of her emotions in tantrums has led me to wonder if this behavior pattern actually begins as a baby, when the world sometimes is so overwhelming or confusing or trapping that he or she loses control. There's no scientific study about this that I know of, but as a parent who attempts to deeply understand her children, I have to respect the amazing sincerity of Ellie's tantrum episodes. We've gone through an evolution in parenting in our efforts to handle Ellie's tantrums. We try to love her and support her first and foremost, it's like a seizure in this way. We try to make sure she doesn't hurt herself, but to some degree, it just has to run its course. The loud wale, the arched back and flailing arms. Sometimes it makes me cry to see her at the mercy of the negative feelings that sometimes overtake her. Last month we broke down and bought Dr. Sears' The Fussy Baby Book , which specializes in parenting high need children. Dr. Sears' personal story of raising his high-need daughter, Hayden, won us over. Interestingly, as an adult in a family of physicians, Hayden chose music. Her brain was always wired differently, and by gently meeting her needs, I think the Sears parents helped her develop the special attributes only her brain could offer. The book is like part strategy and part pep-talk, already I appreciate the chapter on emotionally coping as a mother of a high-need baby. Dr. Greenspan, Dr. Sears, and many other parenting gurus consider high-need children to have particularly active, and even high achieving brains. I don't know if this is a sour grapes rationalization to help parents with difficult kids be inspired to put extra effort into them, but they do make a powerful argument. I know this about Ellie's brain: it always plays music, it observes everything, and it's very intuitive. Aidan runs through the world with his arms open, like Laura Ingles. Ellie is more the scientist, observing and carefully plotting her steps. Aidan always fell because of his adventurousness. Ellie's curiosity is even more deeply ingrained, but she acts on it with methodical experiments. As a result, she rarely falls, but achieves the same heights in climbing or trips down the slide as Aidan. I've heard parents say tantrums are efforts to get attention by the child. I've always had a mantra that children's plays for attention should be treated as formal communicative requests for attention because children don't know how to ask like an adult. You wouldn't ignore a polite request, and I don't think parents should employ ignoring their child as a parenting technique. If your child has to resort to negative methods of requesting attention, they might be more deprived for attention than the parents realized. But the kind of behavior people discuss here might very well be fits, which are more about not being able (or choosing to the easier route) to express upset emotions than the losing control issues of tantrums. In this along with many other ways, Ellie encourages me to become a better mom. I feel like nothing but my love can help her through this. I don't let her tantrums make me angry. Way back in labor I recognized a tool of disconnecting from the situation, hiding in my deep brain so the then-pain and now-emotions don't touch me. I don't think they're her fault, or her being naughty. I just love her more with every kick and scream. My lingering fear is the effect on Aidan when John and I suddenly uber-focus on Ellie, I don't know what to do but encourage him to come help, too. Maybe taking care of his sister can help him develop his sense of sympathy? He hasn't ever picked up false tantrums in an effort to draw the attention, the worst he does is try to tell us an interesting story when we're doing our best to keep Ellie from flipping out of our arms or into a table. One of his classmates has had problems with tantrums before Ellie began hers and his teacher was always good at handling it. I think that has helped him understand them a little. Maybe some day parenting fields or medical advances will come to some big realization over synapse mechanisms in children and we'll all know what to do. Until then, I just love her and love on her, and follow the books' advice for avoiding them where I can. It's a wild ride, this is just one bump on the road.

 I first read about this in Sarah Blaffer Hrdy's Mother Nature, and I thought then, if this is true, it would be fantastic to have! I've finally gotten around to finding it. By spitting into this test kit, which fits in your purse or wherever, you can look for non-fertile vs. fertile shaped spit bubbles. Apparently, it's pretty obvious. It predicts ovulating days up to 72 hours in advance. Since I'm absolutely BC pill non-compatible (it turns me into an unpleasant person, to say the least), and my old method of the cervical cap isn't so reliable after babies, I'm already dependent on natural family planning methods. And this is a huge advance in that area. Conversely, if you're aiming for those fertile days, this would also be a big help. urlLink OvuLook Saliva Ovulation Tester

 I think I should do a lot more of treasured moments here. How else will I remember them later? Most of these are from today or the last day or two. So here we go: -Aidan singing on the potty: "Oh I'd like to visit the moon, on a rocket ship high in the air, yes I'd like to visit the moon, but I don't think I'd like to live there..." -Aidan at the Easter table telling Aunt Amanda she can grow up big and strong like his mommy and daddy if she eats good foods -Ellie's super kissy stage, especially today at the library when her many kisses were so loud that all the kids watched her instead of the book being read -John and Aidan's "spider on your back" game with its newest addition, Ellie! -Aidan's begun using the word actually -Ellie said want down -Aidan fed Ellie his cereal this morning, and she ate it from him (she doesn't typically eat so willingly) -I don't think this one has much longer to last, so I want to be sure to capture it. Aidan's favorite thing to eat for dinner is toe-food (translation: tofu)

 urlLink The Globe and Mail : "This latest research also complements other studies that have shown how a woman's diet is transmitted to the amniotic fluid during pregnancy and influences the flavour of breast milk. It may also explain cultural preference for certain flavours -- such as garlic or curry -- in humans. Other animals, including young rabbits and sheep, will forage for food with the flavour they recognize from mother's milk. In humans, research has shown babies will accept carrot-flavoured food more readily if their mother has consumed carrots while breast-feeding, Dr. Mennella explained. 'In childhood, you're probably determining what each person's comfort food is,' she said. 'It's a very important time in which we are establishing food habits.' However, scientists have also found certain receptors that make people blind to bitter tastes, suggesting a role that genetics plays in flavour preference. As scientists try to figure out whether picky eaters are born or raised, or some combination of the two, they hope to find ways to prompt children to eat more fruits and vegetables. "

 Last weekend I drove to San Antonio to meet family for what's become the annual urlLink Final Four pilgrimage . It was the first roadtrip I've taken with the two kids by myself. Before the kids, I was all about the solo adventures, and Aidan and I had some fun two-somes, but since we had Ellie, I've cowered a little. I wasn't sure what I'd do if the kids needed me and I didn't have John to swivel around and solve all their problems. But with John going to Germany, and with air tickets to Germany hopelessly overpriced on account of Easter, I decided to pack the kids in the car and head out. One little factor made this a ridiculously easy task: we finally turned Ellie around to forward facing in the car. I know the studies, I know she's safest rear facing for several more months, that the turn at one year thing is a government minimum, not an optimal. But having them both face the same way is so much easier! They can both watch the DVD, which means they both sit motionless and quiet for hours at a time. This is definitely one of those loosening of values things that happens with each additional kid, because we kept Aidan rear facing until 18 months. The only negative we have now with her forward facing is that I can't just crawl into the back en route, strap myself in, and nurse her. But since I was driving alone, that wouldn't have been an option anyway. With the kids lost in the DVD, I had the open road to myself. It was so much fun! I love roadtrips (I must, right? This was my third big roadtrip this month!), especially with John because we have such a great time on our adventures and we spend the hours in the car catching up or just quietly holding hands, but I forgot how much I love just catching up with myself, too! The only difficulty was holding my bladder after thoughtlessly drinking tea because getting everyone out for the bathroom sounded too hard: trampling into a public bathroom with Ellie on my hip and Aidan by the hand, followed by wiping Aidan, again with Ellie on the hip, then peeing myself with Ellie on my lap. As soon as we arrived, though, Ellie turned up her cutesy shyness, not letting go of mama to save her life, so I still ended up peeing with her on my lap!

 urlLink DR. SEARS NEWS : "A study of 4,700 children showed that breastfeeding resulted in lower blood pressure during childhood. The longer a baby was breastfed, the lower the blood pressure.

 Since we've clearly lost the ketchup war (that is, deceiving my son into believing no such thing exists) with Aidan, I'm forever switching to fruit-sweetened ketchup. As long as he's going to use this stuff, it's not going to be an extra source of High Fructose Corn Syrup in his diet. As long as it doesn't include this evil sugar substitute, I've read that ketchup can actually be a good source of licopene in the diet. Hmmm. Btw, I so blame Papa John either genetically or influentially for making Aidan want to dip his herb-encrusted field roast (it's a bene and tofu product from Whole Foods) in ketchup.

 you're supposed to sing that. Like everyone, John and I are still working out our identities as parents. We'll never stop, but this is one of those times where we're working harder than usual on it. For the out-of-the-loop reader, here's the cliffnotes to our story as parents: We're super young parents. The youngest by far at Aidan's school. The youngest among most bloggers. That said, compared to my hick-town roots, we're not so young. John's turning 28 next month (he's so old!) and I'll be turning 27 in June. This is cool for us, b/c I was still fertile, and unlike most women I know, I was lucky enough to be warned by a doctor that my fertility was waning. It's also good b/c our careers are still malleable, well, for the most part. We're young enough to be recklessly adventurous with our kids, to sleep on the ground and go weeks without showering--all of which lighten our load when we travel, which, since traveling is our biggest hobby, is economically advantageous to say the least. Wait, this was supposed to be cliffnotes. Let me get to the point. Aside from traveling, we're obsessed with ideals. We want to change the world, and we're hell bent to do it. Sustainable, affordable housing and free, clean water for everyone! Chief among our ideals is the precept that child raising is for dads just as much as for moms. Children and parents alike benefit from two parents, and because the workplace model doesn't support this structure yet only means we entrepreneurial Americans haven't tackled the problem yet. We want to help the world understand the social and institutional changes that can help make this a reality for families, but we've also done what we could to make it a reality now for our kids. The past year was somewhat of a derailment in this plan when, after the space shuttle accident, John took to working the overtime, crazy hours that are normal for most dads and I took to cooking and childraising solo like most moms in our society. A year later, we're not quite as extreme with these roles, but they're still hanging around. When we went on vacation a few weeks back, this was one of the things we saw when we had enough distance to make our reflective vision clear. So now it's time to restructure family roles. But how do we make it happen? First, I want to raise my children, as opposed to 10 or 12-hour/day childcare. Second, I want my partner to help me do this so that I too can have a productive role in society. He wants to do this, too, so as you understand this is not a mommy's momentum issue. Fortunately, John works for the federal government, which has several Clinton era policies still in place that encourage flex-time work and paternal family involvement. Although I have to say I don't know what stage two looks like yet, stage one has been set. First, we got a little push from Aidan's school, but it was good anyway, to decrease Aidan's school time from five mornings a week down to three. And I'm already glad for it, b/c the consequence of my overmommed stress shouldn't be extra school for him. Instead, John will begin working more from home in general in an effort to eliminate office-based overtime altogether. In addition, he'll be home at least one afternoon a week, and he'll continue the general recent trend of hanging around in the morning long enough for me to get a little catch-up sleep and feed and dress the kids. With one John afternoon and at least one, sometimes two Yolanda afternoons, coupled with nap times, I should be left with ten or more work hours a week, or ten work hours and a few pilates hours. Either way, I'm a happy mama and the kids get two parents. special postscript: my spellchecker wanted me to change childraising to clitoris . Ha!

 I don't even eat meat! But when I was young, every one of our family's numerous road trips seemed to end with my mom saying that. Just a few hours ago, we arrived home from a long weekend of camping at Enchanted Rock. We were blessed by the weather gods with some very cloudy, much cooler days, but today wasn't one of them. The heat index was over 100! So we arrived exhausted and sweaty, ready to be home. Upon our arrival, John and I quickly swept the floor for new hatchling fleas, and then got to the business of being home again--opening mail, checking email, unpacking, feeding the kids so we can send them to bed. For me, this includes a funny, new ritual: feeding my starter. Since reading a urlLink Dr. Weil book last year that included love among healthy and yummy food ingredients (seriously, food made in love seems to be better for you and even taste better), I work hard on loving food I make and thinking of how healthy it will make my family as I prepare it. Showered, fed, with one out of two in bed, I found myself gently perking my starter up, feeding it and giving it some warm spring water, stirring it with a chop stick because you don't want to use metal and a spoon is too big and clunky. I was a little worried about it because the fridge was too cold and it got a little icy. But just now I checked in on it and it was bubbly and yeasty, happily making its hooch! It looked so happy to have us home! I'm not used to cooking or making things other than urlLink Annie's Mac or lox bagels. I always thought it would be too draining. But this bread project is really rewarding. My starter gives more to me than I give to it. I know, it's strange to write about, too. Maybe I'm just in some honeymoon period for breadmaking.

 moo, but who cares! The more exciting detail is that Ellie knows the cow says moo. She's known for a while that the cat says meow, but we have a cat so that one gets drilled in. Today we were pretending with the barn and animals and Ellie showed me that she can say moo when she sees a cow and even "dak-dak" when she sees a duck. In the interest of equal time, Aidan said "otherwise" this week. He even used it perfectly in a sentence: "Mom, I have to take my shoes off outside, otherwise the sand will get on the floor."

 urlLink : "Do your kids complain about stomach aches? They’re more likely to do so if their diets include a lot of fast food. Researchers at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston found that almost one-quarter of 900 youngsters between the ages of 5 and 15 reported recurrent abdominal pain. Of those affected, 60 percent described the pain as 'moderate to severe,' and nearly half of those complaining said the pain lasted at least 39 minutes each time it occurred. When the researchers looked into what the kids were eating, they found that fast foods were most often associated with the tummy aches while fresh fruits and vegetables appeared to be protective. All told, once other factors were eliminated (including age, gender, race and socioeconomic status), the researchers concluded that the risk of recurrent abdominal pain was 50 percent higher among children who ate in fast food restaurants daily compared to those who ate fast foods only once a week. Those who ate fresh fruit daily were least likely to report stomach problems. "

 This morning I baked four loaves of bread: two classic sourdough and two banana walnut, all out of my urlLink aforeblogged cheater starter . I started out planning to make one loaf to use up all the co-op’s extra bananas, but with bread, things quickly get out of hand. Read on and you’ll see what I mean here. File this blog under the heading "busy work for the hands creates odd analogy adventures." Feeding and kneading the dough are my favorite parts of the process because they remind me of preparing clay in the potters’ studio. In fact, up until this year’s maternally-inspired baking adventure, the clay ovens were the only ovens I’ve ever used. Kneading dough feels and looks just like kneading clay, so while kneading today I began to wonder why Jesus talked about potters’ clay instead of bakers’ dough. Dough seems much more prevalent in life than clay. Even if he never made dough himself, which seems unlikely since he was a bachelor and often spent time all alone, surely he saw his mom, sisters, and aunts make dough. The products of dough and clay are different in that, after cooking, one’s empty and breakable and the other is edible and filling. Now that I think about it, I like the imagery of humans as the empty, breakable ones. People should heed this and treat each other as the delicate, priceless vases we are. Maybe Jesus just had to save that kneading bread analogy for his big finish--the symbolic cannibalism, as it’s called in the business. Using it in a parable would be a tacky and confusing double entendre, would muddle the message of the good book later. The simplest explanation for the use of clay in the parable is that Jesus must have gotten to know a potter amid his nomadic travels. This fits into my romantic view of Jesus on the road, watching carefully the livelihoods of those he chanced to meet and then weaving those encounters into parables. In this way, I think Jesus was like tofu: he took the flavor of his surroundings and, with his substance, made it a palatable, fulfilling product. It brings to mind Paul’s experience later in the Gospels when he’s in Greece and he claims the unmarked alter as his God’s, saying people teaching others about God have to be all things to all people. That’s a lesson urlLink Christians today seem to have forgotten, instead taking up the practices of the pharisees Jesus rebuked for their tightly clenched anuses, their rigid attitudes regarding laws, service, and worship. The urlLink most visible Christians in our society define themselves by what morals they stand against (gay marriage, abortion, sex ed) rather than focussing on the ties that bind them to our culture. Surely a key reason kneading bread put me on track to examine Christianity today is that Christianity, when brought down to its most primary place in humanity, is beautiful. As the religious tradition of my culture, I want to claim it and love it. When it looks like an outgrowth of Jesus and his followers, something that started over baking and talking, begging a room in a stranger's house for the night and then asking that stranger to hit the road with them in the morning; when it's as basic as homemade bread, it's a religion that I can conscionably pass on to my children. But instead, organized Christianity today is an obvious outgrowth of beurocratic religious systems, a stump for political bias, a bullying platform that keeps people down and/or out. It's the market on the synagogue steps. But all I want is the bread.

 Aidan's decided he's a rhinoceros. A little over a year ago, he decided he was a lion. It lasted months. I guess he adopted the persona as a protection against that age's difficult social situations. When he saw other children, he didn't know how to initiate play with them, so he'd just roar really loud and either they would yell back or run away. Either way, he'd engaged them in what he saw as play. I banned roaring for a whole year, and worked hard on teaching him to say, "hi, I'm Aidan!" It worked so well that he's still famous with the teachers for jumping into his classroom his first day of pre-school declaring loudly, "hi, I'm Aidan!" I don't know if the rhinoceros' appearance in our lives indicates anything so deep. I'm tempted to think he's just enjoying being loud. Why can't he turn into a quiet butterfly or mouse for a year? In our house, with soft wood floors on a pier and beam foundation, the children have to "keep quiet feet," which is tricky for a rhinoceros. And I haven't even mentioned the loud, throat hurting sound these animals appear to make. I don't want to squash his great imagination, so for the time being, I'm requesting that he be a quiet rhinoceros. My daughter had her own volume control issue yesterday when we met my parents-in-law for their two hour layover. The good news is Ellie did not have a tantrum. She did have what, a month or two ago, might have been the run-up to a tantrum, but she didn't lose control altogether. For the first hour or so that we sat at the airport "patio grill" (read fenced off drunk tank) the kids were great. I don't know exactly why she lost it, but for the second hour she lost it and began crying. I sat her in my lap, facing me with legs straddling mine and tried to calm her down with singing and talking. When her little voice would begin to escalate into that panic scream, I blew into her face, causing her to stop and be quiet all of a sudden: long enough to look in my eyes and regain some control. I say some because she just couldn't seem to get all her emotions back together. She'd still whimper and suck in short breaths, and then she'd lose what sense of security she'd found and begin crying all over again. Maybe she was sensing my own insecurities? I was not exactly up to my usual game, still sick, long day. Plus, sitting with your young children in front of family at a restaurant is one of the most difficult situations for parents, and especially for me. I want so badly to prove to my relatives that the kids are perfect and can behave in any situation. And--honest, I swear--if no family is there, they do. But the presence of relatives seems to bring out the crazy kid element that spoils my best efforts. This same thing happened last week when my parents took us to the downtown Aquarium (terrible food, sad fish swimming in circles, never go back). I want everyone to adore Ellie as much as they do Aidan, but she's a trickier one for most people to get. While Aidan is a social butterfly, she's slow to trust others, she's careful about which environments feel safe or unsafe. Gaining her affections is a very big compliment. Rather than indicating poor behavior or spoiled parenting, her crying episodes, which happily replace tantrums now, probably reflect my shortcomings as her mom. I need to work harder at approaching social situations in a way with which she can feel comfortable. And I need to care less what other people think. But don't we all!

 Up until now, I've loved the effects of peer pressure. Aidan's little friends at pre-school encouraged him to potty train immediately, to walk in line with his hands behind his back, to write letters, click on listening ears, and clean up joyfully. I've marveled at the magic structure through which his school encourages ten kids to do together what one could not alone. But this past month, I've seen a wave of negative behaviors that I could really live without. They've included pointing a finger like a gun while saying "pew," telling his sister to shut up, spitting, declaring he doesn't like vegetables (we're virtually vegetarians!), and most recently, pretending to smoke. That's right, yesterday I had to give my three-year-old the smoking talk. Cigarettes are yucky, they hurt you here (rub chest). Please don't pretend to hurt my Aidan. First, I had to explain to him that when he holds the long woodscrew from his sister's tool set, puts it in his mouth, takes it out, and blows, it's called smoking. This explanation came after I mistook his pretence for scuba diving--we were watching Dr. Doolittle (the old musical). And he said it was the stick with fire at the end, not the hose you breath air out of. And of course, I asked him where he learned such a thing: school. But who at school acts like that, I asked. [name of one of the two boys who are the source of my troubles lately]. After talking to Aidan about not pretending to hurt himself (a variant on the lecture we gave him about not pretending to hurt other people after the finger-pew incident), I sent him on to play and told John I wanted to email that boy's mom right away and let her know that her son is teaching others to smoke. Surely that family must smoke at home, at now their poor decisions are affecting others beside their children! John talked me down, as did my mom later on the phone when I told her about it all. But what am I left to do? Maybe I'll ask for a meeting with the school director. I spoke to Aidan's teacher last week and she said she'd keep an eye out for the bad behaviors and she always tells the kids "that's closed here" when they start them up. I know this is the first of many battles. I guess that's why I want to fight it so bad. I want to win, and get more wins under my belt, rather than be at the mercy of the lowest common denominator morals of my son's peers. Even as I write that, I know it's unrealistic. I just have to get better at instilling the opposing morals at home with such a sense of conviction that he'll be more inclined to avoid bad behaviors. That's a long term approach. What do I do right now!?!

 Today's a pretty important holiday in the Feighery household. I can't wait! Taking my kid to the first movie he actively anticipated is better than showing him Christmas morning! My little 3 1/2-year-old Aidan has been wearing his Shrek mask around the house for weeks. When my New Yorker came with foldout photo postcards from Shrek and Fiona's honeymoon last week, Aidan carried them around and showed everyone... right up until his sister broke them. All the relatives are lining up to take him to additional viewings. We'll take him today, I bet Aunt Amanda takes him soon, too. My parents want to take him next week when they visit. I'm sure Aidan will oblige them all. urlLink Welcome to AngelikaFilmCenter.com: Houston, Texas: Now Showing: Shrek 2

Though use make you apt to kill me, Let not to that self-murder added be, And sacrilege, three sins in killing three. Cruel and sudden, hast thou since Purpled thy nail in blood of innocence? Wherein could this flea guilty be, Except in that drop which it suck'd from thee? Yet thou triumph'st, and say'st that thou Find'st not thyself nor me the weaker now.

I succeeded at my urlLink "cheater" version of sourdough bread. 3. urlLink Aidan's Penis has completely healed. 4. urlLink The Mothers Day/Oral library project is strangely on hold b/c, even though I sent everything 2-day mail, nobody has received their packages yet.

We never have gone back to urlLink the Montrose library . 6. urlLink The flea issue is still active. We no longer keep the AC at 65. It did help dent the population, but it didn't kill the larvae already in eggs, who otherwise waited until temps drifted back up. We do sweep almost every day. John wants to buy a urlLink Roomba to help win the war. I don't know if that would be the answer, or if he's just using this as an excuse to get cool gadgets. With him, it's usually the latter. We've never bought a vaccuum, so he might get his way. The flea population has been sincerely decimated, but every few days there's a new hatching somewhere in the house and we see a few jumping around again. I read this week that the daily sweeping paired with letting a cat or dog into the house for an hour once a day would get them to leave. I also found a microbial called Nemotodes that eats flea larvae but doesn't appear to harm humans. It's only recommended for outdoor use, I can't tell if that's b/c most people don't like the idea of worms living in their home. I personally prefer tiny worms you can't even see over blood-sucking siphonapteras. Fleas are far less pesky than mosquitoes, which we're about to be surrounded by since Hurricane season starts in a few weeks. If only mosquitoes ate fleas. 7. Ellie hasn't urlLink had a tantrum this month. I shouldn't jinx it, but maybe she's grown out of them? I heard my neighbors took their 17-month-old daughter to the ER in the middle of the night this week with symptoms that sound just like Ellie's tantrums. The strange thing is the doc sent them home with no illness found only after running all sorts of tests and taking blood. Either the doctor's never seen a tantrum-throwing kid, or I'm underestimating how frightening that baby's body throwing episode appeared. 8. We did urlLink switch to fructose-sweetened ketchup , and we're so happy with the switch that we can't believe we took so long to do it! We have no qualms letting Aidan dip away, and I even prefer the stuff myself. 9. Finally, and this is the saddest to blog, we clearly did not end up fostering, or even adopting urlLink the baby girl who brushed against our lives. It was a great experience for us though, b/c we now know that given a sudden decision of whether to add another child to our family, we said yes. Even when we knew that child probably had mental deficits and physical health issues, we felt honored that God would give us one more baby to love. After it became clear the possibility was closed, we were left with a lot of questions. Did our quick yes mean we want more kids? Otherwise, I feel pretty anxious to get on with my professional life. Maybe we'll adopt later, after I get some professional progress under my belt. Having two kids is _a lot_ more difficult than having one, but I have heard from other parents that adding one or two more after two isn't such a leap. Ask me again how I feel in a year.

 urlLink ERS/USDA Briefing Room - Food Consumption : "ERS's loss-adjusted annual per capita food supply series suggests that average daily calorie consumption in the United States in 2000 was 12 percent, or roughly 300 calories, above the 1985 level. Of that increase, grains (mainly refined grains) accounted for 46 percent, added fats 24 percent, added sugars 23 percent, fruits and vegetables 8 percent, and the meat and dairy groups together declined 1 percent. Per capita availability of total dietary fat, after remaining steady from 1985 to 1999, jumped 6 percent in 2000. American diets are also low in whole grains and other nutritious foods."

 urlLink Position of The American Dietetic Association: Nutrition standards for child-care programs : "Over the past 3 decades there has been steady growth in the use of center-based child-care arrangements. In 1965, 26% of young children in nonparental care were in center-based programs. By 1995, more than 70% of young children in nonparental care were in center-based programs, 20% in family child-care homes, and 8% in other arrangements (eg, relatives or in-home caregivers) (3). This trend toward increasing reliance on center-based and other formal child-care settings provides expanded opportunities to ensure that young children are routinely offered nutritious foods that keep them free from hunger, promote their proper growth, and reinforce choices and habits that prevent disease and support good health. Over the years, trends in child health in the United States have shifted the emphasis in child nutrition programs from a narrow focus on the prevention of dietary deficiencies toward the broader view of promoting healthful food practices for longterm benefits. During the past 3 decades, increased iron intake among infants has resulted in a decline in childhood iron-- deficiency anemia (4). Total energy intakes have increased or, in some cases, remained stable (5,6). The percent of energy intake from protein and carbohydrate has increased whereas the percent of energy intake from fat has decreased (7). These are positive trends. Opportunities abound, however, for further improvements in children's diets. Prevalence of overweight among preschool children has doubled in the past 20 years (8). Although intake of fat and saturated fat has declined, it still is consumed in amounts that exceed recommendations (7,9). In addition, children are not eating the recommended amounts of fruits and vegetables (7,9,10) or grain products (7,11). New research is providing clear evidence that food habits and patterns of nutrient intake acquired in early childhood 'track' into later childhood and adulthood (12-14). It is reasonable to assume, therefore, that implementation of high standards for nutrition and nutrition education in child-care settings today will have major impact on the health of Americans well beyond the year 2010."

Belinda Phipps, chief executive of the National Childbirth Trust, said: 'We know that breast-fed babies are less likely to be overweight and have less chance of developing diabetes in childhood for example but this research also suggests that breastfeeding can have a major beneficial effect on health in later life too. 'Conversely, formula milk has been linked with a higher incidence of respiratory disease, high blood pressure, ear and urinary tract infections, diarrhoea and gastroenteritis.' A recent survey of 1,000 women by the Department of Health found that although the benefits of breast-feeding are well known, the UK has one of the lowest breast-feeding rates in Europe. Almost a third of women in England and Wales never try to breast-feed, compared to 2% in Sweden. The research comes as the International Baby Food Action Network (IBFAN) warned efforts to increase breast-feeding rates were being hampered by formula milk companies promoting 'misleading' claims. It said many companies promoted milk substitutes by saying they could make babies more intelligent or were very similar to breast milk."

Ben’s wish was to create a video / computer game in which the hero kills cancer cells. The game would have several levels of battling the cells. Ben felt that this game would be helpful for kids like him who have cancer, a way to fight back and relieve some of the pain and stress involved with treatment. Ben is a big fan of video games and computers — so the Greater Bay Area Make-A-Wish Foundation went out to local game companies to find a champion to make Ben’s wish come true. A hero stepped forward: Eric Johnston of LucasArts. Not only did Eric want to make Ben’s wish a reality, he wanted to involve Ben in every step of the process. For months, Ben and Eric have been meeting on a regular basis to make the game just as Ben has envisioned it. Now you will have a chance to see it too!"

 This is a startling article from today's NYT. I don't know how right it was, but I, too, defaulted to holding the parents of the Columbine shooters at least partly responsible for the boys' acts. I was shocked to read that Dylan's father worked from home and spent lots of one on one time with him. He sounds like an attached parent, but then Dylan's mom says she didn't realize how hopeless Dylan was about life. My cousin, Shannon, once said (during a conversation about our two homes, both under 1000 square feet) that those boys couldn't have hidden guns and bombs from their folks if they hadn't lived in gigantic suburb houses. I've since wondered just how big their houses really were. In his Academy Award-winning documentary, Michael Moore linked the boys' violent actions to the town's livelihood: a Lockheed Martin bomb and missile factory. He also points out the violent war America was involved in then, the week the boys killed themselves and their classmates also saw the highest number of casualties in Kosovo. The article correctly labels the parents as additional victims of their son's actions. It also gives the parents a safe forum to espouse their message: this could happen to anyone. urlLink The New York Times > Opinion > Op-Ed Columnist: Columbine: Parents of a Killer : "After I wrote a column a few weeks ago about the 1999 shootings at Columbine High School, I got e-mail from Tom Klebold, the father of Dylan Klebold, one of the shooters. Tom objected to the column, but the striking thing about his note was that while acknowledging the horrible crime his son had committed, Tom was still fiercely loyal toward him. Which prompts this question: If your child commits a crime like that, what do you do with the rest of your life?"

 If your city is lucky enough to have urlLink an Angelika Film Center , then you already know the magic that is drinking through films on the big screen. Love that martini run when the plot sags. But urlLink the Angelika offers great treats besides the alcoholic kind, like Cheap Date Night on Monday nights and the Crybaby Matinee every Friday and Saturday at 11:45 a.m. I just availed myself of the latter for the first time. I saw urlLink Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind with Eleanor, my neighbor Serena, and her 17-month-old Charlie. The Crybaby Matinee offers regular feature movies and art films (no kiddie themes) to people otherwise tied to kids during the day. They leave the lights on real low, park a changing table under the screen, and welcome that certain younger set of movie attendees that might offer normal audiences worse interruptions and annoyances than the ubiquitous cell phone ring. I've often explained to people curious about my parenting methods that I fully hold with the philosophy that says our society expects kids to behave to unrealistic circumstances for varied age levels. This somewhat more pliant brand of childraising instead lets kids make the world their palate and accepts their behavior and ability to cope with social situations as they come. The only caveat I have to this theory is that I don't exist in a world full of people who think this way. Instead, I exist in the world people who think this way complain about. People who populate my world tell stories about it for months if my baby cries through dinner once. These people want to see orderly children quietly minding, fitting perfectly into their social situations, or else being carried quickly to the bathroom in case of noise, smell, or fluid. While I dare to change their muddy minds by breastfeeding to toddlerhood in public, I otherwise conform to their needs by structuring my children. Once a friend who just heard my spiel on my parenting methods asked me if I meant that, were the world more accepting of permissive parenting, I would drop all my structured parenting tactics. It was an amazing question to ask, and it caused me to walk around for a few days pondering a social environment that actually accepted children just as they come. I bring this long memory up, because that's exactly what the Crybaby Matinee was like today. There were some dads present, but the overwhelming majority were moms. People who brought their babies in strollers or joggers parked them in the wheelchair seating at the bottom of the big stadium seating area. Some moms sat on the stairs as their little toddlers tumbled up and down. Every now and then someone would go use the changing table. When Charlie climbed over the back of his chair to explore the row behind him, no one looked disapprovingly or shushed him. I, not expecting anything of this nature, had timed Ellie's nap for the movie and she nursed and slept through it all. Some other babies, like Ellie, nursed and some, like Charlie, entertained themselves with toys brought or the lights lining the stairs. Only because it was my first time, I found myself distracted by wonder at this net of people who still had interest in dark, artsy, R rated (gasp) films, despite their newfound parenthood. After a few more visits, I'm sure I could become adept at ignoring the low level activity and pay attention to the movie. Serena said this was her first visit to the theater since Charlie was born, and this represents the significant opportunity Angelika offers, an advance in our social progress that I would not have thought significant until I had kids. Our society excels at sternly expelling moms from fun interactions, unless they have the money and detachment necessary for creating an unhealthy attachment to the baby sitter. Kids are the ultimate buzz-kill, the no-no at any party, in a public location or a private home. Moms like me, who are lucky enough to have a spouse that enacts a self-imposed social sabbatical, find themselves dependent on Blockbuster and Must See TV for their jollies. The unlucky ones are left alone b/c most men, even in our modern age, will happily claim a guys' night when the absence of social interaction gets too heavy. My point is, events like the Crybaby Matinee at Angelika, and even tonight's ballet at the outdoor Hermann Park, represent progress. We're slowly letting kids, and therefor mothers, back into the fun side of society. I'm inspired to dream of a someday where everyone really does accept kids into movies and restaurants (not just the family friendly AppleBees or Tony Roma's, either. I mean the good restaurants). When the kids have a hard time--they act out or fall out of their chair or even break the noise-smell-fluid barrier--everyone lends a hand because it's hard on the parents and kids alike, and no one thinks the kids or parents are just inconsiderate. A girl can dream, can't she? Tonight we're off to the aforementioned outdoor ballet performance where I can drink my wine (from a plastic container) and the kids can twirl and arabesque in the grass when the dancers inspire them. We should just call today dream day.

 Nearly a week has gone by and I haven't even blogged that Ellie got her first black eye. I think I'm getting a complex about how many injuries I find myself blogging here. There was Aidan's big fall where he hurt his teeth so bad, Ellie's two headers off the couch in a row, then Aidan's penis debacle, and just about the very day that healed, Ellie took a header off the kitchen counter. And that last one sounds so irresponsible to write! Let me explain. It's one of my most treasured family rituals. John comes home and cooks in the early evening, and as he does so, Aidan and Ellie sit on the counter next to him. Sometimes they "help" tear apart cheese or wash beans or lettuce. Sometimes they play with the magnetic letters on the fridge next to the counter. Ellie graduated from highchair in the kitchen to actually sitting on the counter around 13 months, and even then John would keep his body or a hand near her. In the last two months, though, she's demonstrated her ability to sit still and be safe so he's ventured a few feet away on occasion. Last Thursday, Ellie was just out to do harm to her poor little body. As I was talking to my mom in the afternoon she daringly stood up on the chaise and walked up and down its slope. I didn't touch her b/c I kind of wanted her to fall. I try to follow our parenting mantra, taken from a wise mother of three boys and grandmother of two boys we met in the Kit Carson park in Toas last year: let them get hurt on the small things, or else they will get hurt on the big things. I held my breath and hoped for the least hurt but most teachable fall. She didn't fall, and therefore felt emboldened to be even more dangerous. In fateful words, I told my mom, "Ellie is just out to break her neck today." Unfortunately, I didn't tell John that. I overdid how much I needed a break from the kids just so I could get the car and go to the store to buy his b-day present. While I was out he began cooking dinner and she fell off the countertop, landing right on her head/face. I was standing in Banana Republic when I got a phone call from a very upset John and Ellie. I sped home in record time and John and I began the giant process of determining whether or not to call the doctor, whether or not to rush to the ER, whether or not to just wait and watch. Here's where my super-bookshelf is handy. I have medical advice from the most conventional western med pediatrician (Schmitt's Your Child's Health), the most unconventional homeopath/truster of the body over medicine (How to Raise a Healthy Child Despite Your Pediatrician), and everything in between (Dr. Sears' Baby Book). In particular, my most trusted source is called Smart Medicine for a Healthier Child, and it explains what the approach would be if you went to see a conventional doctor, a homeopath, an acupuncturist, or a nutritionist. Ellie's eye began to swell pretty quickly. She hit both the bone just above her eye and her cheek bone. I put topical arnica and ice on both of those areas, which really did a great job preventing bruising. I was wary of putting either on the more sensitive eye, though, so that bruised and swole quite a bit. Her eye was almost halfway swollen shut. The books all agreed that no one really does skull x-rays b/c minor skull fractures aren't treatable anyway, so we decided we could monitor at home just as well as any ER. She was instantly exhausted (the fall was a half-hour b/f bed time anyway, but crying and head injuries are famous for zapping kids' energy. I let her nurse to sleep, but woke her every thirty minutes for the first few hours, then every two hours for the whole night. She had no lack of balance, confusion, blood in ears or mouth, all signs of concussion. The bruise is already really faded and the swelling was gone within 48 hours. She looks like such a bruiser, the pretty girl with a big black eye. Yesterday she gave me a scare with a bloody nose, just a trickle, but it reappeared this morning. So I called trusty Dr. Ho to see if this is a sign of concussion (they could take up to four weeks to appear), and he did his usual best to say it's nothing to be scared of, just probably a picked nose or a dry nose. Good ol' Dr. Ho. The internet and doctors alike seem to be markedly unconcerned with bloody noses. I've only had one my whole life, and it scared the crap out of me, so I took it big. We mark it under experience and lessons learned. Another parenting adventure. Fortunately, this proved to be a learning tool. Getting hurt on small things put into practice, she's much more cautious these days. But John still feels *awful*.

 This month I've had the joy of initiating Aidan into a special corner of our culture: awaiting a movie opening in tortured anticipation. Aidan got Shrek his first Christmas, just before he turned one and it's been a very special pairing since. He _really_ identifies with the character. He was even Shrek for Haloween. How do I explain to the three-year-old that this is a new Shrek, that he's never seen? Well, trailers help. And this one rocks. urlLink The New York Times: Movies: Trailer/Multimedia: Shrek 2

 urlLink The New York Times > Health > The Heart's Desire : "According to national data, a woman under age 35 has a 35 percent chance of having a baby after a single in vitro fertilization attempt with her own newly fertilized eggs. The odds drop off steeply with age, however; for a woman aged 38 to 40 the chance is 20 percent, and for a woman aged 41 to 42 it is 10 percent. Fertility experts say that patients today arrive at their clinics fully aware of the statistics and the medical possibilities. Many have been to other clinics and, having failed to become pregnant, are seeking a new start. Most scoured the Internet, and many joined support groups where they learned about methods that leading fertility centers say are useless and even dangerous. 'They know the basic workups and options,' said Dr. Mark V. Sauer of the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia. 'They even talk about specific ovulation-induction products, endometrial thickness measurements, whether the Doppler flow studies were adequate. 'They want to know the specific scores of their embryos in cultures,' Dr. Sauer said. 'I've had patients break down and cry over their embryo scores.'"

 Mothers Day didn't end up quite as bad as I'd made it out to be in my mind. Turns out a corporate collusion holiday in itself isn't enough to mess with an otherwise lovely Sunday. John didn't get me anything, which I really appreciated but his parents got me a nice gift certificate for a fancy dinner out, which, oddly enough, I also really appreciated! John offered to help me accomplish this giant project I've wanted to do for about a month now. He was a huge help! First he took the kids to the park and rode the lightrail while I zoomed around to stores. Then he helped me assemble and send out the packages. I want to set up an oral history project for my mom and her siblings. They're a very colorful bunch, and every holiday or get-together is filled with great stories. Even the lesser told sad or bad stories are memorable to me! I'm terrified of losing this rich heritage of oral tradition, and I think this might save them. Between my backgrounds in non-profit development and anthropology, I certainly have enough experience to do this. It's just a matter of money and time. I footed the bill for everything so far, but I really hope they'll be so pleased that the family helps out. Yesterday I mailed each of the five siblings a very nice looking wooden keep-sake box. Inside was the proposal package described in about seven pages of introductions and instructions, a handheld voice recorder with extra tapes, self-addressed stamped envelopes on pretty stationary for sending the filled tapes back, and two books to inspire them to get talking: Bless Me, Ultima and My Invented Country . I tried to make opening the box sensually pleasurable with pretty paper wrapped carefully around the items, and lavender oil sprinkled over it all. I fantasized throughout the assembly about each family member going to the mail and getting their box. Depending on the amount of money they want to donate, the resulting captured family history in stories can be posted on a family oral library website and anyone with MP3-playing software can share in the bounty. Whether or not the project is a success really depends on how comfortable my family members feel talking into their recorders, and whether they can believe in the value of their memories enough to participate. (I don't think any of them read my blogs, so I'm not spoiling anything here) I really hope it all works, but right now I'm just flying high on the feeling of accomplishing a goal I've had for a while now.

 Fellow mom/blogger Julie Leung blogged on the NYT article I mentioned last week, the one with the really bad expert advice on potty training.

 This institute and its founder were quoted in the aforeblogged NYT article. Jean Piaget is among this guy's developmental influences, Aidan's in a Piaget-based curriculum school right now, and I'm really enjoying that style instead of the more directed Montessori and the less directed Waldorf. urlLink Health Promotion Human Development : "The program is developmentally based, utilizing several principles set forth by Arnold Gesell: All children proceed through the same sequence of development, but all vary in rates of development. There is an inner timetable which determines the child’s rate of development. Trying to teach activities ahead of that timetable will at best result in only minor, temporary growth. A favorable environment helps to insure the realization of a child’s potential. Each child is unique in temperament and growth style. The culture should try to adjust to each child’s uniqueness. Other theories upon which the program draws include those of Erik Erikson, Lev Vygotsky, and Jean Piaget. These theories provide us with a set of developmental expectations which allow us to plan appropriate activities and develop behavioral guidelines for children."

 Two families among my neighbors will be holding their kids back, so I can attest that this trend is pretty strong. This is a great article, that presents both sides, but really says parents shouldn't do it. Here are the highlights, but go read it all if you have the time because it covers other good considerations regarding school and kids approaching school age. urlLink The New York Times > Education Life > Older (but Smarter?) : "But just as significant is the trend of holding back preschoolers who aren't struggling at all. To provide what some believe to be an academic edge in today's competitive classrooms, or even an athletic foot up, many parents postpone their children's entry into kindergarten so they are older in the grade than their peers. When that happens, the age gap within one class is often 16 months or more. ''I understand why parents don't want their child to be that much younger and I feel for them,'' Mrs. Vogelsperger said. ''Teachers can teach within a 12-month span and address the needs of their students,'' she explained. ''But if there's a 16-month gap there's such a wide range of capabilities that it becomes more difficult to teach.''..." ..."Whatever slight academic advantages older students might have in the early years typically evaporate by third grade, experts say. In a 2002 report, Deborah Stipek, dean of the School of Education at Stanford, found that existing research showed that on average older children did not academically outperform their younger peers. Nor are there social or emotional benefits to being older in the grade, her own research has found. ''It's one of the conventional wisdoms that take hold in our society that parents are giving their children a great advantage if they're older,'' she said. ''But there's real data out there showing that for most children that's not true, and parents should know there's a downside if their children are intellectually capable of handling kindergarten.'' For one, older children who are ready for a more challenging program can become bored and misbehave in class. Dr. Robert S. Byrd, a pediatrician at the University of California Davis Medical Center, analyzed data from the National Center for Health Statistics for 9,079 children ages 7 to 17. He found that teenagers who were older in their grade because they had started school late were twice as likely to have behavior problems as classmates who had entered at the usual age."

 urlLink The New York Times > Education Life > Reading: 'Underpants' Before the Darkness : "Teachers face a complicated task when choosing books to recommend or assign, as they weigh what their students ought to read, are able to read and might actually like to read.

What if they could escape educational literary agendas and the nostalgic promotion of classics by parents who control the family book-buying budget? (While noting how I often nudge him to read my old favorites, my 12-year-old recently suggested that I read his. This is how ''The Hitchhikers' Guide to the Galaxy'' and four sequels came to live on my nightstand.) Each year, more than 100 million books are sold through school fairs run by Scholastic. The fairs are hardly unfiltered buying experiences. Before shopping, their money zipped into plastic sandwich bags, the children are often shown videos that steer them toward selected new titles. Some students never get past the piles of television and movie spinoff books that Scholastic sells. (A Haymarket 6-year-old named Foster Shafer bought a book about the basketball player Yao Ming because he had seen him in a commercial.) Others are drawn to holographic covers, or books adorned with silvery lockets or charms. The Mountain View fair immediately sold out of ''Spy Survival Handbook'' with its attached metal decoder, good for exchanging coded notes. Still, a book fair is as good a place as any to measure what sort of reading children enjoy when given the freedom to shop independently..."

 urlLink DrWeil.com Question: Choosing a Healthy Mother’s Day Gift? : "New research indicates that babies may benefit, too, when their mothers eat chocolate during pregnancy. Researchers in Finland asked 300 pregnant women to record their stress levels and keep track of their chocolate consumption, and then followed the children after birth. The results of the study showed that at six months of age, the babies of women who ate chocolate during pregnancy smiled and laughed more often. Likewise, the children of women who had high stress and ate chocolate showed less fear in new situations than the babies of stressed mothers who passed up chocolate when they were pregnant. While there’s no proven link between the chocolate and the babies’ behavior, the researchers speculated that the cheerfulness noted among some of the babies could stem from the effect in the womb of their mothers’ positive moods, possibly stemming from the chemicals in chocolate. Results of the study were published in the April 6, 2004 issue of New Scientist."

 urlLink Julie Leung: Seedlings & Sprouts : "Looking around our living room last night was a new sensation for me. Our two families are very different and they probably would not have met each other, if they hadn't each believed in education and helped send their kids (Ted and me, respectively) to (the same) university. Yet the fact that Ted and I loved each other brought them together. They first met when we were getting married. Twelve years later we two are more in love and have given our parents three grandchildren. I looked at our girls, their granddaughters, and realized that Ted and I have permanently connected our two families. There are now three people in the world whose blood and flesh trace back through these two separate heritages. Our girls are the glue between them forever. To think how the choice of two twentysomethings to love each other for life could bond two families together across continent and cultures...Last night while looking around our living room, I saw this truth literally embodied in the people present: three of the grandparents who gave us life, and their three grandchildren, who came from Ted and me."

 About once every month or two, I'm plagued with a wave of guilt that I'm not raising the children with a church family. We used to have a very dedicated place in church. For years in college I worked as a youthgroup leader. Even after college we found a church in a Houston suburb that we loved... right up until we got pregnant with our first kid. Then we found ourselves questioning the freakier of the church's values (values that are pretty ubiquitous here in Houston) such as the frequent statements against the National Endowment of the Arts, planned parenthood, strong women, and democrats. Primarily, we couldn't see raising our children in a church that kept women from equal participation, because we could never actively or passively teach our children that girls are somehow not as special and wonderful as boys. Additional problems, although not deal breakers, include that churches tend to have complicated bureaucratic organizational structures such as elders, laypeople, and committees. They vote on issues as if they were a democracy. Attending a new church usually involves standing up for some greeting time, which humiliates the hell out of me. Since we had kids, there's the added problem of churches that "strongly recommend" the kids leave for kid church during the message, and I'm not about to send my kids into a nursery on a visit, when I don't know the policy of hiring or acquiring volunteer workers. Plus, I prefer to nurse my Ellie through a service anyway since she's still sketchy about strangers. John's always looking for good music, and I'm always looking for a critical approach to scripture, but we've even dropped our standards regarding this. Finally, we don't want to drive to the burbs for services, since one of our new urban-esque family values is to find community close to home. And who wants to spend nearly an hour each way on the road during the precious weekend? Sometimes I wonder, if the Catholic Church gave up its position on women being priests, if we would go to Catholic church (as anti-membership as we are, I hesitate to say join). John and I were both raised with Catholic families, but chose protestant for ourselves. When we attend with family now, there's a lot I still like about it. The ritual, the tradition, the family focus... I doubt we'll take a huge roll in a church now, even if we find one to frequent. We're avid travelers, on the road about half of the weekends of the year. I'm probably recreating my formative normal here, since my family attended church once or twice a month when I was young. After all this, my guilt still takes me over. Even if I don't think a spiritual life is necessarily dependent on having a church, the church is a good focal point for spirituality. In its absence, we tend to lose our discipline and focus. Where should we go? What should I do?

 Aidan and Ellie just finished watching Blues Clues, and they know Dora is coming up next. Aidan got up and asked if he could pause the TV because he has to go to the bathroom. I told him he didn't need to because it's a commercial now anyway. He looked very puzzled, but took me at my word and ran to the bathroom.

 Hate to be the urlLink Debbie Downer here, but here's the highlights of another long article that backs up the slowly revealing dangers of urlLink Splenda . This is the first place I've seen it said out that Splenda is actually more dangerous for diabetics than sugar. urlLink Idaho Observer: Splenda is not Splendid : "The manufacturer claims that the chlorine added to sucralose is similar to the chlorine atom in the salt (NaCl) molecule. This is not the case. Sucralose may be more like ingesting tiny amounts of chlorinated pesticides, but we will never know without long-term, independent human research. According to Consumers Research Magazine “Some concern was raised about sucralose being a chlorinated molecule. Some chlorinated molecules serve as the basis for pesticides such as D.D.T., and accumulate in body fat. However, Johnson & Johnson emphasized that sucralose passes through the body unabsorbed.” ...The FDA acknowledges that sucralose “is produced at an approximate purity of 98%.” While that may sound pretty pure, just what is in that other 2%? It turns out that the final sucralose product contains small amounts of potentially dangerous substances such as: * Heavy Metals (e.g., Lead) * Arsenic * Triphenilphosphine Oxide * Methanol * Chlorinated Disaccharides * Chlorinated Monosaccharide ...Few human studies of safety have been published on sucralose. One small study of diabetic patients using the sweetener showed a statistically significant increase in glycosylated hemoglobin (Hba1C), which is a marker of long-term blood glucose levels and is used to assess glycemic control in diabetic patients. According to the FDA, “increases in glycosolation in hemoglobin imply lessening of control of diabetes.” Research in animals has shown that sucralose can cause many problems in rats, mice, and rabbits, such as: * Shrunken thymus glands (up to 40% shrinkage) * Enlarged liver and kidneys. * Atrophy of lymph follicles in the spleen and thymus * Reduced growth rate * Decreased red blood cell count * Hyperplasia of the pelvis * Extension of the pregnancy period * Aborted pregnancy * Decreased fetal body weights and placental weights * Diarrhea"

 This is the stupidest, least helpful commentary on potty training I've ever read. I only link so other parents can gape at the idiots who wrote it. The opening is just offensive, b/c by the numbers, the middle class family of four actually has less money now than they've ever had. The advice is useless, too. Potty training is hard, and a doctor that says things like we "simply" did this and this clearly had a very devoted wife or nanny. urlLink The New York Times > Health > Mental Health & Behavior > Personal Health: Plan of Action Can Keep Toddlers Clean and Dry : "Many parents these days must have more disposable income than my husband and I had when our twin sons were toddlers three decades ago. Certainly today's parents use far more disposable products, especially disposable diapers, for far longer than we did. And diaper companies, ever ready to expand their market, now produce diapers (about 25 cents each) and pull-ups (40 cents each) big enough for 4-year-olds, maybe even 5-year-olds."

 Mothers' Day is stupid. I don't want Hallmark telling my kids to buy me something once a year. I remember all the lame stuff I threw together Mother's Day morning as a kid, and I feel bad for my mom who had to throw on a smile and say how much she loved it. I hate the holiday-ification of every single relationship our culture acknowledges (except the same sex committed pair bond, Hallmark should really go after that loop hole). Today at the library, the kids had the corniest project where they had to make a mothers' day card, only they're all so young that the parents were the ones really making the card. Or, as is often the case these days, the nannies. It was awkward for us all, especially the nannies, for whom the holiday should be named nanny day. Right in the middle of a strange story book about everything moms can't do (like say good bye w/o kissing, eat marshmellow cereal instead of healthy yogurt, or make your bed w/o your help), Aidan perfectly summed up my thoughts on the whole capitalistic regime that is this Sunday and its build-up. He barfed. That's right, I got a little more than usual out of my public institution-supporting tax dollars this week as my son christened the carpet of the Montrose library's reading area with last night's home made pizza and this morning's hot cereal grains. Everyone either stared, gasped, or said "ew," as did the ever eloquent children's librarian. For a moment I almost gave him my purse to throw up in, but I really do love that purse. Instead I cupped my hands and captured it as best I could, thinking mom's can't help but catch spewing tomatoes either. Finally a nanny got me a trash can, and scooped Ellie up as she screamed when I ushered Aidan to the bathroom. Except for her, I can't point to one of the several moms, grandparents, nannies, and library workers that offered help or said anything that might keep this from becoming a traumatic memory for Aidan. There wasn't much left to do but wash our hands, strip him down, and leave. As we walked to the car I could only laugh. I don't think we can go back there again.

'Hey! Love bugs!' yells Dallas, who is nine. 'They're always double,' says Rory, six. 'Yeah. Mom, how come they're always stuck together like that?' says Dallas. 'Because they're having sex,' I say. (I'm honest in my motherhood like that.) 'No... they can't be having sex,' says Dallas, 'because their butts are stuck together - not their mouths.' Ha! As I told several people today, I should have replied, 'I said they were having sex - I didn't say they were in love.' But, instead, I said something awkward about genitalia and then the kids remembered the talk we had a while back about the making of babies. 'Oh, yeah. Okay,' they said. Then a love bug couple hit Dallas on the arm and he said 'Ew! Y'all get out of here!'"

 No sooner did I blog about the loft bed being the only private place Aidan has, then Ellie learned how to climb up the whole ladder! We decided the best solution was to take the ladder off since Aidan can muscle his way up the bed without it, and I don't want to worry about Ellie getting up there alone. But Ellie was so excited and proud of her new skill, when she discovered the bed sans ladder, she let out a heart piercing whine in disappointment. I tried to redirect her to the Ikea ladder on her wall, but it just wasn't the same. Poor girl!

 My friend--who has now outed herself as Marianne--was pretty urlLink insistent in comments that soy was definitely contributing to her feeling bad. I don't know what, if any, meds she's on, but I did find urlLink this Dr. Weil article that says people taking Synthroid experience a heightened sensitivity to soy disrupting their thyroid. It also says the same effect could theoretically happen with a few other raw vegetables, but soy seems to be the main culprit. I was inspired to delve deeper into soy after reading my urlLink most recent issue of Mothering , which had a damning article on all foods soy. urlLink Dr. Weil says this in response to the recent wave of anti-soy articles: "All told, I find the epidemiological data on soy foods very reassuring. I still recommend one serving a day of whole soy foods such as one cup of soy milk or one half cup of tofu, soy protein (tempeh), or crispy soy nuts. At those amounts (about 40 milligrams of isoflavones) you'll get the benefits of soy without the theoretical risks of taking in excess isoflavones. I do not recommend soy supplements because of their high isoflavone content and the lack of epidemiological evidence for their long-term safety, especially if taken on top of soy foods and isoflavone -spiked nutraceuticals." The funniest irony was noted first by my husband, who questioned the editorial wisdom of following the anti-soy article with an article titled, "Medical Marijuana: A Surprising Solution to Severe Morning Sickness." Clearly the health benefits of each could stand some critical thinking on behalf of the American family, but each article says, in absence of the right research, one is dangerous and the other is safe. The moral of the story is that stakeholders abound, and editorial boards are not sources of absolute rights and wrongs, but rather media for the transfer of information. I'd like to say the same about my blogs. Information can never hurt, only the misuse and misunderstanding of information can. I feel more wise for having heard both sides of this story, but as of yet, I'm not exactly throwing soy out of our family diet. urlLink Textured soy protein maybe, but not soy.

 Yesterday I took Ellie in, bowing to the pressures to treat strep with an antibiotic... or so I thought. I had waited three days, which was the best middle ground I could find. In Smart Medicine for a Healthier Child , I read about a study that suggested waiting three days before seeking the antibiotics for strep allowed the body to build enough of an immune response to lesson subsequent strep infections, without increasing the risk of complications such as rheumatic fever. As it turned out, Ellie tested negative on the quick test. Since I'd read the in-office rapid strep test had a 20% false negative rate, I asked the doctor if he wanted to culture for the longer test. He said no, that he'd examine her for other causes of the fever first, at which time he discovered she has an ear infection. I was so surprised! And relieved! If only I had an ottoscope at home, I could have known that without dragging her into the office, paying the co-pay, and acquiring a nice eye bacteria myself. This was not Dr. Ho, since he was out of town, but rather his associate Dr. Klein. I now know that Dr. Ho's greatest weakness is his associate, Dr. Klein. I don't trust this guy a bit. Now I'm worried that we'll encounter a more serious medical issue someday when Dr. Ho isn't available and I'll be stuck with Klein instead. He's--how to say it politely?--older, which would be nice considering his experience, except he apparently hasn't kept up to date with the new advances in medicine. Plus, he's a misogynist, crotchety, southern man who almost visibly wrinkled his nose upon walking in the room and seeing me nursing. Dr. Klein was about to recommend antibiotics when I said I'd rather give her body a chance to fight the ear infection on its own. He was surprised, but said I was her mother, I could do anything I want, "just don't call me on Sunday when you change your mind." Don't worry, I wouldn't call you ever, for anything. admittedly, at home, Ellie's high fever persists and I'm worried. This morning I did a little research in an effort to soothe myself and was happy to find urlLink this study , which indicates Ellie is borderline between the traditional medicine's current standpoint on whether to treat an ear infection or let it run its course. She has one of the three big problem symptoms--high fever, vomiting, and cough--and the study recommends antibiotics for children showing two of the three. Funny that they don't mention the presence or absence of pain, which doesn't seem to be a big deal for her at all. Chief among my concerns is our intended trip to NM, where we'll be far from the standards of emergency medical care found in Houston. I don't know how I've come to feel this way. When I was growing up we never worried about such a thing because our home rural hospital hardly set a bar. Taos county's hospital or even Vernon, TX's hospital would be an improvement. If we are really going to raise our children between Houston and Taos, I have to get over this. So now I've gone full circle from fearing strep because I didn't want to give her antibiotics (napalm), to being thrilled that she didn't have said strep and had an ear infection instead, to fearing the ear infection because I don't want her to have antibiotics. I remember Saturday applauding her crazy bath antics, fearlessly splashing into the water head first. In my reconstruction of events, she must have had a mild immune reaction to the vaccines, thus swelling her ear canals and making possible the stagnation that brought this infection on. In an effort to speed drainage, I'm using two massages: pressing my palm over her whole ear and making circles, and rubbing the line between the back of her ear to her jaw bone. She's not eating, but she's still nursing like a champ, so I'm eating every healthy thing I can. After all this, you know the craziest news? John has a fever.

 urlLink DrWeil.com Question: Too Young to Swim? : "While swimming lessons are widely promoted as a means of reducing the risk of drowning, a leading cause of unintentional injury and death in young children (drowning rates are highest among toddlers between the ages of one and two), you may be interested to know that the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) does not recommend aquatic programs as a way to decrease the risk of drowning among young children and warns that parents should not feel secure that as a result of these lessons their children will be safe in water or safe from drowning. It is true that one-year-old tots can learn the dog paddle and other rudimentary swimming movements, but children under the age of four don’t have the neuromuscular capability to learn real swimming skills. Furthermore, the safety training programs have not been shown to decrease the risk of drowning. In fact, the AAP’s Committee on Sports Medicine and Fitness cautions that programs that emphasize making a child feel safe in water may backfire by encouraging youngsters to go into the water without supervision."

 Including pregnancies, we've been parents now for nearly four and a half years. Through all of it, we've sufficed with our puny underarm thermometer. Within a few weeks of Aidan's birth we learned that 1) it's normal for an infant's head to feel very warm, as long as the actual forehead feels normal, and 2) rectal temperatures cause perfuse liquid bowel movements and upset parents and baby. We're technically minded people so we looked into our gadget options. We found that the reason doctors' offices and nurse lines insist on hearing a rectal temp only is that ear (ca $30) and underarm (ca $2) thermometers each have a margin of error of 1 degree on average and 2 degrees occasionally. However, if you consider that a fever isn't trip to the ER-meriting dangerous unless it's 106 or 107 (in babies, not newborns. I think it's more like 104 in newborns), you can rest assured a temp reading on the underarm up to 104 is within your margin of safety zone. Nobody has spurty BMs, nobody cries. It's taken four years and two kids for us to encounter a situation in which we feel we need a more accurate reading. I'm still horrified by the memories of rectal insertions and the subsequent bowel-emptying (remember my love affair with our friends, the intestinal flora), so again to gadgets we turn. The urlLink temporal artery thermometer has a margin of error near that of the rectal temp, reads instantly, and involves only the forehead. We've purchased the urlLink Exergen Temporal Scanner ($49 at Walgreens). I'll let you know how it does.

But the real response was the slew of google hits I continue to get on the topic of blog etiquette. In case you're actually looking, now I can help you. Lisa of cadence90 has written her own set of rules. Here: urlLink Learning The Lessons of Nixon » 007 Blogging : "There have been previous attempts to write down some blog etiquette, usually followed by a lot of posts along the lines of 'We don’t need no stinkin’ blog etiquette!' The thing is, I think the blogosphere isn’t really a commons..."

 Back in urlLink Future Studies , we learned about Wild Card Events--highly improbable, but incredibly effectual possible outcomes. Think World Trade Center collapsing, the stock market tanking, or getting struck by lightning. Most of our safety-oriented decisions in parenting are based on the possibility of wild card events. We're quite unlikely to get into a car accident, but because in the event of an accident, children are the worst off in the vehicle, we strap them in unbelievably expensive carseats every time we're in the car. These days parents are told to keep all kids in the back seat and all kids under seven in booster seats. Riding only on busses or trains would be absolutely safest, as the safety record of mass transportation is far better than that of single-occupant vehicles. But the state prefers individual transportation choice over communal safety. We accept some risks and guard against others. The year I graduated from college the world was briefly taken with the fear that scientists at Los Alamos National Labs might urlLink carelessly destroy the universe with an experiment. The scientists had to admit it was a possibility, albeit an incredibly remote one. They assembled a panel of experts who all agreed the likelihood of such an event was so unlikely that the experiment could safely go on. It did, and clearly, the universe did not rip apart. Why all this pensive consideration of probabilities vs. possiblities? We're nearly certain Ellie's come down with strep. A few ugly complications sometimes result from strep, the most famous of which is rheumatic fever, but the complications are extremely unlikely. Even more unlikely are the complications of the complications, but because said complications include heart valve damage, which results in a lifetime of heart disease, physicians typically promptly administer penicillin in response to a positive strep test. I don't think antibiotics are evil, but I do think they should be reserved for use in only the most necessary conditions. Our bodies' health depend upon a symbiotic relationship with thousands of flora of bacteria and a single dose of antibiotics decimates the populations of these friendly little bugs. We should not take killing our little friends lightly. Pen-happy doctors and patients that only feel treated if they receive meds are evil. Probably 90% of antibiotic prescriptions are written in response to viruses, which are not affected by antibiotics at all. These indiscriminate killing sprees, along with the routine use of bleach in "antibacterial" soaps and washing agents are creating dangerous quantities of antibiotic-immune populations of bacteria. Have you noticed how antibacterial soaps always say they kill 99.9% of bacteria? That's because 0.1% of bacteria are naturally immune to antibacterial chemicals, thanks to random genetic pools. When you kill off all the natural competitors for the food supply, you create a perfect ecology for those .1 percenters. Humanity hasn't yet found a medicine that treats antibiotic-immune bacteria. Antibacterial chemicals and antibiotics, and especially the corporations that market based on the fears of well-intentioned parents, are the best friends of these dangerous organisms. In case it isn't obvious, I'm really torn on this decision of whether to give Ellie an antibiotic shot for the strep. For my mom, it's a no-brainer: give it to her. But she shops at Wal-Mart in one breath and tells people not to in the other. I'm such a slave to my morals. But at the expense of my daughter's heart valves?

 urlLink CNN.com - Report: Most children who drown are supervised - May 27, 2004 : "Drowning is a 'silent killer,' swimming and child medical experts said. It's not at all like the Hollywood dramatizations depicting floundering swimmers bobbing to the surface yelping for help for several minutes. 'Kids slip in the water like a pebble going under,' said Dr. Marty Eichelberger, CEO of the National SAFE KIDS Campaign. 'As they try to get themselves out of the water, they sorta streamline their bodies making this linear form, and it takes them straight to the bottom. They only have a minute or two before they loose consciousness."

 The author lists several points of advice, these were the points that caught my eye: urlLink How to Have a Good Relationship and Marriage : "Accept influence. A marriage succeeds to the extent that the husband can accept influence from his wife. If a woman says, 'Do you have to work Thursday night? My mother is coming that weekend, and I need your help getting ready,' and her husband replies, 'My plans are set, and I'm not changing them,' this a guy is in a shaky marriage. A husband's ability to be persuaded by his wife (rather than vice-versa) is so crucial because, research shows, women are already well practiced at accepting influence from men, and a true partnership only occurs when a husband is able to do so as well. Have high standards. Happy couples have high standards for each other even as newlyweds. The most successful couples are those who, even as newlyweds, refused to accept hurtful behavior from one another. The lower the level of tolerance for bad behavior in the beginning of a relationship, the happier the couple is down the road."

 urlLink News : "In a study of 68 women who recorded when they had sex over a three-month period, Wilcox and his colleagues discovered that during ovulation, when a woman is most likely to become pregnant, the overall frequency of sex increased by 24 percent."

 Last night I awoke with a chuckle as Ellie latched on to my breast with a hot, fevered mouth. Then I realized it probably meant she's coming down with Strep, too, and it wasn't so funny. One of my fondest memories from my fumbly first months of motherhood after Aidan's birth is of Aidan's first fever. I love it because it reminds me of the huge change I underwent as I discovered my mothering instinct. I only grappled with whether to move Aidan from his co-sleeper to the bed for about three weeks, at which time I had developed enough trust in myself and appreciation for sleep to make the move to an unabashed family bed. Aidan would nurse freely off and on through the night and I would drift from the stage 3 mama sleep to stage 1 or 2 long enough to help him position himself, or pop him off and shove him over. During one of these middle of the night nursings, I found myself rapidly coming out of sleep with the realization that something was wrong with my baby. When awake, I quickly realized the feeling of his hot mouth on my breast as he drowsily latched was what woke me. He had a fever! I woke John and we proceeded to discover the parenting drill of underarm (we'd already learned the rectal lesson!) temp-taking and thumbing through symptom lists in the baby books. I don't remember what was wrong, it probably resulted in us seeing Dr. Ho and Dr. Ho sending us home empty handed with promises that the affliction would harmlessly run its course. That happened a lot early on. That's why interviewing a pediatrician when pregnant is so important. Then, you're still level-headed enough to find someone that trusts the body over medical interventions. You can explain your anti-antibiotics values and the Dr. understands you aren't one of those people who feels cheated if they leave without a prescription. If you wait until you have your newborn to find the doctor and explain all this, you'll be under the first time parenting psychosis that results in frightened and freaked out reactionary approaches to each sneeze and cough. So, having explained all that, what to do about Ellie's possible onslaught of Strep? Babies typically have a lighter go of the bacteria, but I presume they still run the rare chance of rheumatic fever. A considerable part of me regrets giving Aidan the antibiotic last week. For now, I'm just watching and waiting. This fever could still be a sudden tooth rupture.

 I try not to ever be stingy with money. If I've got it, I'll happily pay for dinner, and if I don't, I'll happily accept another's offer to pay. I'm not big on saving money for a someday future, I'd prefer to enjoy it now as long as my family is healthy and youthful. That's probably a big reason I'm still paying for college! I do have life insurance so if I ever suddenly leave those debts behind, my family is taken care of. The elastic boundaries of expendable income always fascinate me, and I'm often left with the feeling that God or the Universe (pick whichever name you feel most comfortable with) is in control here more than I. Because we don't save, expendable income decisions are a bigger deal for our family than most. When money's tight, we don't spend it, and when the money's flowing, we do. Childcare used to be fully within the boundaries of expendable income, but it's increasingly becoming a fixed cost. I expect it will be this way until the kids finish college! Separate from the cost standards of programmatic childcare, are the quality standards of home care. One area I prioritize money for is childcare. This is a worker in your life that you want to feel fulfilled and happy about working for you. Job dissatisfaction for the childcare provider could exhibit a whole range of behaviors ranging from the worker being crabby with your children to dangerously lazy. I pay the wonderful domestic goddess that relieves me one (when I'm splurging, two) afternoons a week $10/hour. This is roughly twice the minimum wage, and yet, nearly half the poverty line. Now I've gotten a flyer from a neighborhood girl (11 years old) offering to babysit for $5/hour, when I asked about two kids, she said $6/hour. She's taken a course in babysitting and learned CPR. I think she's pretty responsible, but on principle, I can't abandon the domestic goddess, a first generation immigrant who teaches the children Spanish and has a lifetime of professional and personal experience. As is typical with the American market, I doubt one will replace the other, instead the market will most likely expand for both. I'm already scheming to pay the 11-year old to come over one or two hours once or twice a week for the summer to play with Ellie while I shower or write. And speaking of the writing, if I don't get a publisher soon, all this childcare is going to become expendable again!

 Last night was the worst parenting night we've ever had. Aidan was so congested that he would wake up in a panic from not being able to breath at least every thirty minutes. Additionally, he had fever-induced delirious dreams that interfered with his perceptions of reality when he awoke. He would scream things like, "daddy can't see me!" John and I were already exhausted from his night the previous night, after the meningitis scare. We took turns soothing him, sitting in the shower with him, making him teas. It's the sickest he's ever been. On top of all that, I've pulled some muscle in my back so rocking and holding him was pretty painful. We've been planning to go to Chaco Canyon this year for my birthday as long as I can remember. After Chaco, we were going to backpack Winsor Trail to Santa Fe Baldy: the kids first ever backpack. With heavy hearts, we pulled the plug on the trip. We were planning to leave for New Mexico after John got off from work today, arriving sometime tomorrow. After staying up all night two nights in a row, we hardly feel like driving. Plus, we want to prepare for the likelihood of the other three of us coming down with strep this week. We'll still go to NM sometime in the next few weeks, but no once in a lifetime Chaco Canyon solstice experience. Honestly, I'm OK with this, even if it's a little heart piercing. Chaco is such a special place, I'm certain it draws people to it. The last time we were there, we sat at the edge of the biggest kiva and crossed paths with a man from Wisconsin who engineers off-grid housing. He inspired us to look further into sustainable housing, and that in turn affected both John's and my careers immeasurably. That the universe isn't aligning to get me there right now is a message. We narrowly missed the solstice at Stonehenge last year, so maybe my solstice-watching isn't meant to be. On a separate note, this week furthers my longing for geographically local grandparents. On the day-to-day basis, I miss the companionship, the extra eye on the kids, the family dinners. But for the hardest days, like today, I miss the two-hour breather a grandparent could provide. I could shower, take a nap, and resume my mom duties like Pop-eye after spinach. Again, I'm haunted by the realization: parents were never meant to do this alone.

 urlLink Penicillin allergy: The most common drug allergy : "You aren't born allergic to penicillin, but you can develop an allergy to the drug once you've been exposed to it. After that, re-exposure to penicillin or related antibiotics can trigger an allergic reaction. Allergic reactions occur because your immune system responds to the drug as if it were a harmful substance instead of a helpful remedy. For reasons not fully understood, your body creates antibodies called immunoglobulin to attack the medication. "

 Since I picked Aidan up from school on Monday he's had a fever. Every single virus that comes his way leaves him with a fever, so I wasn't too concerned. Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday his temperature was between 101 and 103. I let it burn, he seemed healthy to me and I felt like I could bring it down any time I wanted to with Tylenol if it started to spike. Wednesday late afternoon (wouldn't you know, just after doctors office hours ended), Aidan began to say his neck hurt. I knew it was real because he wouldn't move his neck, but just use his eyes in an exaggerated way to see around him. I was pretty startled and so was John because a stiff neck is the telltale sign for meningitis. Year before last Houston had a meningitis scare and a bunch of highschool kids got sick, I think one even died. The scary news reports are still in my memory with the warnings to take a stiff neck very seriously. I called the after hours line for the doctor, got through the nurse at Texas Children's who passed me on to my pediatricion. As usual, Dr. Ho was much calmer and far less concerned than I was. I like it that way. He said his suspicion was that Aidan had a sore throat because he's seen toddlers confuse sore throat for hurting neck before. I was pretty incredulous because I was sure Aidan wouldn't have been drinking so eagerly if his throat was hurting. But Dr. Ho confirmed my fear that any ER doctor would automatically give Aidan a spinal tap if we came in with symptoms of fever and hurt neck. Dr. Ho devised a test for us to know which was Aidan's pain source. He said to give him a heaping dose of children's motrin and see if he bounced back a bit. He wouldn't bounce back at all for meningitis b/c nothing really makes irritated cerebral spinal fluid better. The test went great, Aidan bounced back and played happily with full range of neck motion. We didn't spend the whole night in the ER and Aidan didn't have an unnecessary spinal tap. The next morning we took Aidan to the doctor's office though because Dr. Ho still wanted to check him out. I was sure he would find nothing, but Ellie was late with her shots so it was a good excuse to go. Unfortunately, it turned out Aidan has strep! I was so shocked, I hadn't researched strep at all. I resisted his advice of administering an antibiotic shot of penicillin, but he was pretty insistent. My kids have never had antibiotics, and I'm really proud of that. Plus, I've read the long course is almost always better than the short course if you do need antibiotics because the long course really wipes everything out, therefore fighting antibiotic-resistant strains. Dr. Ho said this referred to Z-packs, not penicillin. So Aidan got the shot. He still has a high fever, only now he has a really sore leg, too. I'm not sure it was the best decision, but what can we do now but ride it out? We're doing our best to support his immune system. His thousands of flora of good bacteria are no doubt wiped out from this antibiotic. He'll be more susceptible to illness--especially of the gastro-intestinal track--for weeks, maybe months. John had the perfect analogy. He said the previous battle raging in Aidan's body was just the good guys and bad guys, with us supporting the good guys with no-sugars, anti-microbial food, herbs, sunlight, and garlic. Now, the battle's the good guys, the bad guys, and the napalm. And now our task is to minimize the casualties from the napalm and try to keep the good guys out of the way with acidophilus, yogurt, cheese, mushrooms, etc.

 Aidan's gone through an ambiguous, but nevertheless apparent developmental leap. At this age, they have leaps of cognition. There's a new spark in his eyes, increasingly he laughs at things that are actually funny to us, I can tell he understands more of his world this week than he did last week. It's wonderful, except that suddenly his toys seem unbearably baby-ish! The blocks and duplos are of no interest, although he still likes to build traintracks and color with the new pastels Aunt Amanda got him from France. His most beloved activity this week is tying knots with strings everywhere. He's great with the bigboy legos already, so I think it's time to start pushing the building/creating complicated toys that his dad still loves. That's right, we're about to be up to our eyeballs in robot assembly parts and tiny lego bricks. I'm also committing to redouble my efforts to stimulate him creatively. No easy task. I talked to his teacher again about the bad behaviors from school and she was still unable to offer a solution with which I could feel comfortable. However, in her words I realized something key: Aidan is the second oldest kid in his class now! Everyone wants their kids to be among the youngest in a class in order to get that developmental peer pressure push. He used to be among the youngest, so the other kids' parents must have moved their kids up a level already. Aidan was three in January, but he has classmates just turning three now. I think a big part of his change in school behavior these last two months must be that he's bored! This realization, along with the general processes of chasing down a behavior problem with the school personnel, helped me finally make the decision to apply to AWTY. I called and it's still not too late for next year. Up until now he's been safely stimulated and occupied by the Piaget-based curriculum at this school. They focus on sensual experiences, and are very creative with that. This week they emptied can after can of shaving cream into piles and added drops of food coloring. The kids first mixed in the colors, then mixed colors together to create new colors. Afterwards everyone washed off by running through sprinklers. But he's old enough now to begin a structured approach to learning. I still believe that at this age learning to love learning is far more important than any actual academic acquisition, but I want him to learn to love learning in the structured environment. Plus, the additional language instruction is a huge pull. I'll still put Ellie in this school he's in now (why am I afraid to say its name?) part-time in the fall. Regarding Ellie, she's foiled our attempts to keep her off Aidan's bed by finding a new way to climb up. Aidan was only two months older than her when he got the bed, so I'm probably not going to squash her newest climbing techniques. I've told John, however, that this is the definite sign to finish the kids climbing wall. They're great climbers and they need a constructive place to climb! She still walks with her hands at least partly outstretched, but now she's beginning to run a little, too! Usually, she's running after Aidan. She's mastered pointing to bodyparts on demand: ears, nose, eye, belly, toes, etc. Usually in the context of pointing where Aidan hurt her by playing too rough. Since she loves to sit on her potty when we go to the toilette, I did bare bottoms the other day. She hated it. She kept bringing me diapers! She peed a few times and even pooped once (of course, when I was on the phone!), all of which were praised and put into the potty, and waved bye-bye to. She was pretty disturbed by the whole notion of needing to go without the comfort of a diaper. How different she and Aidan are! Bare bottoms were hard with Aidan b/c he was so obsessed with what he made, that he made it every two minutes. Literally. She's begun yelling for effect. We tried at first responding with whispers, but with her audience (brother) always present, that had limited effect. And so, at long last, I've broken out the nose tweaks in earnest (they came much earlier with Aidan). Don't laugh, it works. Pinch the holes of their noses closed (gently, and you can even just pinch the ball of fat above the nose holes if they're snotty) every time they yell and they'll stop. I only have to pinch about every three times, the other times I just put my finger on the tip of her nose and she gets the picture.

 urlLink We are the parents. Is anyone listening? | csmonitor.com : "A decade has slipped by since a fiery group of mothers in the South Bronx set out to make their voices heard in their children's schools. Lucretia Jones, whose two children are now grown, says that parents in her neighborhood had previously been viewed as outsiders, only as valuable as the cookies they brought to bake sales. Today, Ms. Jones says, at least she and her peers are 'sitting at the table' with the school administrators who once locked them out. From her vantage point - as a lifelong Bronx resident and founding member of Mothers on the Move (MOM) - parents have made genuine strides toward opening educators' ears and school doors. But she offers no credit to the provisions in the federal No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) that call for a deeper dialogue between schools and families, particularly in low-income communities. In fact, says the seasoned community activist, 'I really didn't realize parental participation was part of [NCLB].' It's been a problem for the implementors of the new education law. Some of its key provisions prompt states, districts, and schools to notify parents about everything from their children's progress to their options for transferring out of low-performing schools. But a study to be released this week, based on conversations with 26 grass-roots organizations, suggests that as of yet many parents - even those involved in their children's schools, remain unaware of these options, or bewildered as to how to exercise them."

 If my spouse gets even a few days behind reading urlLink any of urlLink my blogs , but especially the SprogBlog, he gives himself a guilttrip before I can even get around to it. Granted, he's superman. He works his fantastic job at NASA, comes home as early as he can to relieve me so I can work harder to get published, cooks dinner for the family in an effort to save us all from my feeble attempts at cooking, and then returns to his work via modem.

I'd have fried him for dinner if my husband was ignoring my blog all this time! urlLink MOM & Pop Culture : "I have been blogging for just about a year and yesterday my husband came home from work and told me that he read my blog for the first time. He only checked it out because he didn't believe I would blog about my drunken stupor and he wanted to check it out. He didn't say much except. 'I don't know, I don't think I SHOULD read your blog. I feel like I'm reading your diary.'"

 Last weekend I went to Ikea with my parents. First of all, there is no reason to go to the Houston Ikea until August 4, b/c their entire stock is whittled down to perhaps 20% in their efforts to sell their inventory rather than move it to the new building. Big mistake guys. We'd made our way through the upstairs showrooms and were browsing downstairs when we first heard a little girl, probably about four, screaming from the bottom of her lungs, devil-style. I wouldn't have been surprised to see split pea soup spew from her mouth. Her mom was yelling back, not really yelling at her, but trying to be heard over the noise of her daughter, to sit down in the cart. A younger girl sat in the cart's childseat, and watched the scene unfold in silence. The really surreal part of the show was that the mother was still trying to get some shopping in, she moved slowly through the giant warehouse that is the Ikea lower level, all the while yelling at her daughter to sit down and her daughter screaming non-stop, in wild bursts of possessed animal sounds. People can be rude, and in tough situations with a loud child, they will be even worse. Some people stood and stared, one woman said sarcastically, "oh my, there is a child screaming." Two girls looking twenty talked loudly about the woman's obvious need to smack that child. The entire scene, and especially the sound of the out-of-control child, made me nauseous. Primarily, I felt so bad for the whole family. This will surely be a painful memory for everyone involved. My mom asked me if there was anything I could/should do to help. I thought intervening at all would only formalize their humiliation and be rejected. Besides, this is the kind of issue that shows its ugly head if longterm parenting preventions are not put in place. That brings me to the purpose of this blog entry: how can we parents make sure we don't find ourselves and our children in such a difficult position. One of the most important parenting lessons I've learned, and one that would have been instrumental for that family, is to enforce your boundaries at home in your nice voice. There are two parts to that. First, enforce your boundaries at home. Don't let yourself slide. You'll want to have room to slide on those boundaries when you're in public (or around family, or in a similarly strange or difficult situation). Second is do your enforcing in your nice voice. In our home, John and I have to watch ourselves for this weakness for using a voice that is strained or angrier than we intend to sound. And sometimes it's tempting to make our voices harsh in an effort to enforce without the enforcing consequence: "now" or "I mean it" are typical follies. We once accidentally taught our dog to lay down when we said now instead of lay down because we only enforced him after saying now. The same could happen with kids when parents count before enforcing. When we're doing our best, we sound positive when talking to the kids even when disciplining them. The real benefit of enforcing in the nice voice is that your kids know you mean business when you're using the nice voice in public. And parents really have to try to use the nice voice in restaurants, stores, or other public places. Making yourself use the nice voice also helps keep you from getting too angry when the kids are in trouble, useful because kids are so good at pushing parental anger buttons. Plus, it's good for their self esteem and overall developmenet if you talk to them in positive voices. One study cited in What's Going on in There: How the Brain and Mind Develop in the First Five Years shows that kids verbal development is directly correlated to the occurance of negative feedback from their caregivers. This little girl was in trouble for not sitting in the big part of the shopping cart. I've personally seen fidgety kids knock the cart over from that spot, it's pretty dangerous. I bet her mom knew this, and accepted the risk because she couldn't trust the girl to be good out of the cart. Ikea's a big store, big enough to try the most obedient kid's patience. That's probably why they offer a kids' playroom with licensed caregivers in which you can leave your kids while shopping. I've always been too chicken to use it, though. It's hard for Americans to trust public childcare. The mom could have reserved a busyhand object for the second level (one of my favorites is an apple. it can take each of my kids at least 30 minutes to lose interest in eating an apple whole. lacing boards also work, my son has graduated his lacing toys to knot-tying adventures and they're taking over my house!). Some stores offer carts with two child's seats, you can spot these carts by their ridiculous appearance as fire trucks or cars. Wary of the nag pressure to always use them, we've never used one. Probably key in causative factors here is a history of letting the kid slide by boundaries. Parents have it pretty hard, they don't get to slack, not even one day. For if they do, the kid will not appreciate the slacking and adhere to the new, lower boundary. They will instead assume all bets are off regarding boundaries and accordingly press them all. Developmentally, I think it's more correct to say the kid feels insecure with the lapse in boundaries and they'll push other boundaries in an effort to reclaim moral certitude. How do you enforce boundaries in public? You don't. And that brings us to my last point. No parent could possible act in grace under the glaring eyes of fifty people and, with the probable presence of a security camera, the entire country's nightly news audience if you slip up. Plus, kids deserve the respect of being disciplined in private rather than in front of their peers. I think the mom might not have found her child quite so beastly had she moved the whole scream and yell operation immediately to the bathroom or car at the first sign of a problem.

 Last week urlLink Bill Cosby gave a speech that was incensing to say the least upon accepting an NAACP award in Washington, D.C. I thought about this speech quite a bit, but was too removed from my computer to blog it. With apologies, I'm p-blogging it now, and as always, I invite commentary. Call it white guilt if you must, but when I was driving to Galveston last Tuesday morning and heard for the first time excerpts from Mr. Cosby's speech, my first reaction was one of horror. His words sounded jaded and hurtful. On an occasion dedicated to honoring the accomplishments of African Americans as exhibited through his own life, Bill Cosby tore down his fellow race. What's more, he attacked the aspects of the black culture that are most unique to black culture. It felt like cheap shots pulled in an intimate fight with a loved one. Similarly, many voices in the black community were unable to accept the message on the grounds that it felt urlLink like airing dirty laundry . Perhaps most hurtful was the way the urlLink conservative right voice , primarily through radio programs, caught onto and championed Bill Cosby's words. In some of his speech, Cosby attacked attributes of poverty that simply aren't the causative factors he assumes them to be. For example, he said poor parents shouldn't be buying their children fancy sneakers. This is a famous misconception. According to the Consumer Expenditure Survey, as charted in urlLink The Two Income Trap , discretionary income for the average family income is actually lower (at $17,045/year) than it was in the early 1970s (then $17,834), even after inflation was adjusted. The authors explain that instead of causing budget problems, discretionary spending (for example, eating out and buying nice shoes) is for many the primary windfall in tough financial times, because it's an easy budget line to squeeze. Instead of the sneakers, modern budget problems can be blamed on skyrocketing mortgage costs, the second family car, childcare, and healthcare. The remainder of the speech focuses on black dialect. As an anthropologist, and as a parent in a city with a culturally silenced African American majority, I don't want every one to melt into one dialect or one acceptable appearance. I celebrate pluralism to the degree that I actively chose a blended neighborhood in which I raise my children. I think hip-hop is currently the most creative music genre. I listen to the Gray Album with my children alongside U2 and Mozart. And yet, I am certain I would not allow my children to speak in a dialect of slang were I black because as a white parent, I actively avoid slang, I teach my children not to use it. I don't let them say um-huh or uh-uh , and because they mimic me, I try not to say how come or y'all . I want to foster an attitude within my children of respect and appreciation toward education, even at the level of communication. I want their words to be edifying and purposeful. I want their vocabularies to be rich and diverse. This isn't an easy parenting task in a culture that views an educated presidential candidate as dull compared to the bumbly, slang-speaking candidate. Similarly, I'm sure parenting black children to speak with plain, clear words isn't easy when all the black cultural heroes of our time are celebrating their diversity primarily through these linguistic affectations Bill Cosby says will prevent black children from becoming doctors or lawyers. In the rearview mirror of history, angry speeches don't seem to hold the cultural attention span for long. We don't remember, though there were many, the angry speeches of Dr. Martin Luther King. With the possible exception of the fiery sermons of Cotton Mather, as a culture we cleave to the positive, uplifting, and soothing speeches--the Gettysburg Address, the Kennedy call to serve our country. For this reason, if no other, I feel Bill Cosby took the wrong approach in his attempt to guide the course of his race. This reflects a desire I have for my own cultural elders: gentle, open arms to catch salty tears of younger ones. Life is hard enough, especially for the families struggling to break the class barriers Cosby mentioned. I don't need another angry, older, crotchety voice telling me what I'm doing wrong, and that is basically what Bill Cosby did at the NAACP.

 This weekend my parents parked their giant behemoth RV at the Galveston Island State Park. It's not exactly camping, but we joined them for whatever it was. We were offered the perfect illustration for how opposite my children are. Ellie had little interest in the sand, instead begging to go to the water. As waves approached her, she giggled in delight. She loved the tumultuous splashing all around her. Aidan, on the other hand, built every object he could conceive in the sand from birthday cakes to castles. His interest in the water receded quickly when he realized he would actually get wet on the boogie board. The rapidly approaching foamy mini-waves caused him to panic and run toward dry sand. It was a nice cap to my folks' visit. They seemed very much in their element on the beach. John and I had fun playing board games with them after putting the kids to bed. I especially enjoyed walking with my mom on the beach after dark, only to later discover we were walking through a sandcrab jubilee! John cleverly created a delicious grilled chicken marinade with the scanty trailer ingredients of soy, lime, and brown sugar (he said he really needed ginger) and Aidan and Ellie alike discovered the childhood magic that is corn on the cob. In general, our family sticks to land activities over water ones. I could do without the sand in my hair, the sticky salt water legs, the residue industrial pollution in my liver... Give me a mountain over a beach any day! But as my parents explore this new stage of their lives, newly loosed from the boundaries of my dad's job on the railroad, we're getting better at accommodating their needs alongside ours. You never stop growing!

 urlLink DrWeil.com Article: Postpartum Depression : "Postpartum dysregulation of the thyroid gland has been considered as another possible cause of depression. This condition is also linked to fatigue. The thyroid gland regulates several hormones and drops production dramatically after birth. It returns to normal functioning in three sequential stages. The first stage, which can last from 3 to 6 months, is hyperthyroidism where the thyroid goes into overdrive and results in anxiety and insomnia. The second phase is hypothyroidism where production is slowed. During this phase a woman experience lethargy and weight gain. The final stage in recovery is when output reaches pre-pregnancy levels. Investigations into the relationship between thyroid dysregulation and postpartum depression have yielded contradictory results and no firm link between the two has been demonstrated. As a result, treatment is considered only when symptoms are severe enough to interfere with daily living."

 urlLink Chimpanzee Study Points to Difference in Learning Between the Sexes - The Jane Goodall Institute News Center : "To study the chimpanzee learning patterns, Lonsdorf videotaped 14 chimpanzees (all under the age of 11) and their mothers during termite fishing sessions. She found that the females termite-fished when they were, on average, 27 months younger than male offspring. She also found they extracted a greater number of termites per dip than males. Dr. Goodall said she was not surprised by Lonsdorf’s findings, which mirror her own observations. The study is the first detailed video analysis of Gombe chimp behavior. Another interesting aspect of the new research is that it demonstrates chimpanzees learning by imitation. The adult females studied each had quite distinct patterns of using short, medium and long fishing tools to varying degrees. The lengths of tool used by daughters greatly resembled their mothers’ choices, whereas the sons’ did not. “Obviously they are paying attention to their mother’s technique, while the sons are not,” said Pusey. The difference in tool-use learning between females and males can be viewed in light of later differences in food acquisition patterns, said Pusey. Females fish for termites throughout the year, while males do it more seasonally. Termites are a more important source of protein for adult females, who do not hunt as much as males. Females occasionally hunt, but it is not a practical activity for them, as usually they are either pregnant or raising young. The study should not be taken to mean the males are incapable of learning or imitating detailed behaviors, said Pusey. “It would be interesting to explore whether young males imitate the details of, say, adult male display behavior,” she said."

 In preparing for the first return to backpacking we’ve used the lessons from last week’s camp trip alongside our experience backpacking without kids to sketch a strategy. Every pound has to be carefully scrutinized for value. We have to plan every meal, mostly dehydrated, snack, tool, and piece of equipment we bring. One of the biggest hurtles we have to overcome is the sleeping situation. My beloved Supertent (affectionately named by John in irony the year we met, before he understood its true glory), a 4-pound orange and yellow on gray Kelty 2-man, no longer suffices our 2-man/2-child (=>3-man?) size family. A 3- or even 4-man tent quickly jumps up to six pounds. You can find four and five pound tents in this size, but they drop temp ratings to compensate. Camping in Texas, this is a benefit rather than detriment, but we have to plan on camping primarily in New Mexico, since that’s our favorite place to camp. I’ve found myself in freezing temps in June on Wheeler more than once, even in a white out on Colorado’s Pike’s Peak once in June! Logistics-wise, we're planning on alternating between one of us (probably mostly John) carrying the largest load in a large pack while the other (me) carries a 2-day-pack and slings Ellie on front. Aidan has a small backpack that he hikes with often. This will be enough to carry his clothes and maybe a waterbottle. If we’re very lucky, he’ll carry his own bedroll. But we have to plan on the contingency of switching that roll midway through the trip to an adult pack. Another tricky issue to examine is diapers. Ellie has one BM a day. It’s not unlikely when backpacking to go several days with no BMs, probably in adjustment to the dehydrated food. Knowing this, I’m considering using cloth diapers for the trip. I don’t know yet, but I like the idea of washing out the diapers from each day and letting them dry overnight rather than having to pack out all the dirty diapers in a ziplock. Working on this little conundrum sure makes me appreciate indigenous potty training methods! Loyal readers know I've been reading the kids Laura Ingles Wilder's Little House series. Believe it or not, these books have helped both empower us in our belief this can be accomplished and give us ideas for how to go about accomplishing it! Wilder's books are a recounting of her family's life living as pioneers and in one book in particular, they make the move from Wisconsin to Kansas in a covered wagon with Laura, her big sister, and her little sister--then a baby named Carry. If the Ingles family can make it in the wild west all alone with three kids and nothing more than a mule can haul, surely we'll be fine in New Mexico's Jemez mountains for four days.

 Since that first summer I was pregnant with Aidan, I've missed out on the week-long summer backpacking trips I grew up taking in northern New Mexico. There's nothing in the world like disappearing into the back country on foot, with all you could desire on your back. This year John and I are determined to figure out a method for backpacking with young children. For starters, we had to get back into the old camping regimes. We were startled to realize we hadn't had cause to get our gear out since camping when I was pregnant with Eleanor nearly two years ago! And of course, that trip ended up in the hospital, like every single thing seemed to during that pregnancy! I'm ashamed to say that this past weekend was our first camping trip with two kids. Everyone knows how last year collectively kicked our asses, and I blame it partially on that as well as the other trips we took last year (Europe, the Earthship adventures, hell--I mean, Lake Powell/Glen Canyon Reservoir). These are no excuses though. Camping has always been and should always be a huge priority in our lives. We suffer physically and mentally when we neglect this, our most loved hobby. We went to urlLink Enchanted Rock , just outside of Fredericksburg, an hour west of Austin. This urlLink huge batholith (think minitature urlLink Ayres Rock ) makes a perfect training ground for bouldering. We took Aidan here for his first camp trip so long ago when he was just 14 months old. I still remember the funny way he would hold the flashlight at night and chase it's circle of light on the ground! The giant rocks are gentle but challenging surfaces on which a toddler can get the hang of hiking with light climbing. Just as Aidan did on that first trip, Ellie was fascinated with gathering pebbles on every trail and had little interest in following us for any distance. Aidan was easier to hike with in our Kelty back carrier, but Ellie is actually more easily in the babysling. Aidan clearly needed no assistance in hiking, aside from holding my hand just before reaching the crest of the big rock (maybe a 500 ft rise over less than a mile). He's pure billygoat when it comes to climbing and hiking. He was able to work on climbing skills, since the bottom sides of the rock offer various levels of climbing routes. We haven't been back to the rock gym lately, so he really needed this refresher. When Aidan was our only tag-along, we would make small camp fires and watch him closely. On this trip, we didn't make a fire at all. If we had, I'm sure keeping both kids safely away from the flame would have been a challenge. We have a small cook stove for meals, and we realized people only need the fires for the unhealthy camp foods that we don't eat anyway (marshmallows and smores). We definitely didn't need the fire for warmth, since we all slept on top of our bags until near-dawn. This also helped protect us from the bad smoke reactions we seem to get (swollen eyes and stuffy noses the next day). Ellie's food is most easily packed in (as it is everywhere we go!), as she is still breastfeeding. Both kids were happy enough to eat fruit (bananas and apples fare best in bags) and pre-packed sandwiches along the way. We needed to establish separate water bottles for kids and parents though, b/c they're terrible about backwashing the food. And we needed much more water than we were used to packing. Essential equipment included sunhats for all (as usual we didn't use bug repellant, and didn't do any worse than if we'd used it), very grippy shoes (sometimes a challenge to find for toddlers, but high-tech, striderites and mollers are good brands), lots of water, and as little other items as you can bare to bring. Camping must be one of the best activities to do with your kids. They are so easily occupied with exploring nature that it's actually easier than occupying kids at home, and the exposure to different experiences is great for their developmental health. I can't believe we've taken such a hiatus!

 That's the line from an email I had from my mom today. It does seem pretty special. Although one has happened in Aidan's lifetime, we missed it. So this will be both kids' first Blue Moon. I'm enjoying imagining where we'll be and how big they'll be by the next one in 2007! urlLink Tonight a 'blue moon' will rise in the sky : "Come Saturday night and Indians can watch a phenomena that rarely occurs -- a second full moon in a calendar month. The first full moon was on July 2. It is an occurrence from which the oft-used English saying 'once in a blue moon' is said to have originated. For Indians wanting to witness the event, the moon will rise slightly after 1800 IST and set at around 0400 IST, M P Birla Planetarium Scientific Director Debiprosad Duari said. Since there are roughly 29.5 days between full moons, it is unusual for two full moons to 'fit' into a 30 or 31 day month, Duari explained. The last such occurrence happened in November 2001. In 1999, there were two blue moon occurrences on January 1 and 31 and March 2 and 31. The next blue moon will appear in June 2007."

 I'm so glad to hear this, as I've been addicted to tanners and bronzers for years. I even used them sometimes, and with a good deal of guilt b/c I hadn't heard anything like this, while pregnant. Some people say they know it's going to rain if they wash their car. Up until last week, I've never had a car nice enough to keep clean. Instead, I know it's going to rain if I put on a tanner. Dr. Weil distinguishes between tanners and bronzers, but in truth, most products are both. And if you, say, run after a bus in the rain after applying one, you look like, as my friend Serena told me yesterday, a leper. urlLink DrWeil.com Question: Are Self-Tanners Dangerous? : "Self-tanners %96 the lotions, sprays and gels that you apply for a sunless tan aren'taren%92t dangerous. They contain a harmless, colorless sugar called dihydroxyacetone that interacts with amino acids in dead cells on the surface of the skin to give you a temporary tan. The effect lasts for only a few days because the skin naturally sheds the dead cells that have been colored. Except for rare cases of irritation and allergic reaction, the products are safe."

 Both kids had their half birthdays this month: Aidan's was July 18th and Ella's was July 21. We explained to Aidan that it means he can say he's 3 and a half years old when people ask him how old he is. Unfortunately, he thought it means he's 4 now. He got into a slight skirmish in the Fort Collins park with a little girl over the issue. He can be very persistent. My crazy Eleanor has to do everything her own way, and sure enough, dental development is no different. Even though Ella doesn't even have all her front teeth yet (she has four top and three bottom), this past month she's brought in three molars. One woman ominously told me bringing in molars before front teeth makes for very crooked front teeth. We'll see. Ella hardly has stellar dental genes. Aidan wrote his first word this month: CAT! Now, he loves showing it off and writes it for anyone who will sit still long enough to watch. He's pretty good at writing most letters, and has just lately developed an interest in the phonetic sounds of the letters he sees all around him. But he's memorized rather than sounded out the spelling of cat. We'll be working on phonics in upcoming months. If anyone has good experiences with teaching this, please let me know! Apparently, the kids' cousin Abigail, who is the same age as Ella, speaks the similar language that Ella's perfected and Aidan did in his day. It's the cutest constant rambling, punctuated with dramatic gestures and expressions. The average listener is lucky to pick out one intelligible word in a sentence, but mama knows what she's talking about. My aunt calls Abbie's language Abbinese! So now we call Ella's Ellanese. Magically, upon turning two, Aidan began to annunciate and we realized that he really was speaking sentences all this time. I expect about the same course of events with Ella.

 Last weekin Taos we stopped by a toystore I've been meaning to look at for months. It's called urlLink Tiovivo Toys , and it's just a few blocks off the plaza. It's basically a huge, rambling, hacienda-styled house converted into a toystore. Each room is crammed full of every toy you could ever imagine. Of course my eyes were bigger than my cashcard. I found a great (my favorite toy brand) urlLink wooden block farm , but it was $35! I called John, who was waiting in the car with the kids, on the cell in an effort to be talked out of my madness. Sure enough he said $35 was ridiculous for toys. He advised me to get the big wooden abacus (Ella developed quite the affinity for Aunt Becka's abacus), $15, and the small lego set, $5, only. The clerk must of listened in, because at the counter she began knocking everything down in price. I ended up paying $20 for the barn, $10 for the abacus, and she threw in a set of animal figures for free. I walked out having spent $40 and still had the legos plus a set of vegetables for their cooking playset! Since we got such a deal, I really wanted to plug the store. When I got to the car, John was shocked at all the toys. We have strict rules about toys, that the kids' room cannot become overloaded with them, that the kids have to be interested in the toys they have or else they go away, and so on. Mostly, we don't want the kids to be surrounded by materialism. So right away I began to sell him on my purchase by promising to rid the room of an equivalent amount of detritus. We could get rid of the big plastic Fisher Price barn now, and Ellie's really outgrowing her duplos quickly now that she's seen Aidan use real legos. At home, the toys are still being played with, so I think they were good purchases. Everything but the legos and vegetables was wooden, and I highly value wooden toys. The vegetables are becoming a really big deal. The kids love to play cooking. They have a very small Melissa & Doug stove, an urlLink Ikea pot and pan set , wooden spoons, urlLink a cutting food set , and an urlLink Ikea tea set . But it's been hard to find play food to go with it that consists entirely of food I'd actually allow them to eat, and at least mostly of food they eat regularly. In other words, I wouldn't want pizza because that's a splurge meal for us, and I certainly wouldn't want play ice cream, pie, or cake because those aren't for kids at all! We treat them like alcohol, since we think they're just as damaging to growing bodies. Today's a rainy day, so I'm sure we'll be seeing a lot more of these toys in lieu of playing outside! Now, what else can I get rid of?

 This title could be confusing, but not for the reason you thought of. Sparkly Joe is the name Aidan gave to the little gecko family living on our porch. I say family because no matter which gecko you see, Aidan says that's Sparkly Joe. But the pretty little black kitty has now been named Sparkly Joe, too. And, even more amazing, she's has two young kittens (she must be a teenage mom) that she's moved under our house. One of the kittens is a bully and the other is accordingly scrawny. There must have been more but now only two survive. I'm afraid the other kittens met the same fate I fear our Zia met, that is, the wrath of the neighborhood's huge, horrible, mean tomcat. Already, since Sparkly Joe moved here, he's begun to show up and I've done my best to scare him away but I can't always be there. I'm afraid he'll kill the two remaining kittens, and then surely Sparkly Joe as well.

 Especially in the earliest weeks after birth, but throughout the course of breastfeeding, shirts, sheets, and undergarments are often soaked in breastmilk. A baby's clothes are often soiled with spit-up breastmilk. And again, especially in the earliest weeks after birth, but throughout the course of raising children, parents are lucky to find time one day out of every few weeks to do the laundry. Consequently, the laundry pile turns into an ant magnet. In fact, ants in the laundry are a strikingly common problem among families. While the easiest solution is a call to the exterminator, remember that pesticides, even the so-called natural pyrethren-based ones, are hazardous chemicals. A baby or child's considerably lower body weight means that toxicities affect them exponentially more than they affect adults. It's especially important to avoid pesticides when children are in the house. In addition to avoiding sprays that suspend in the air and then breathed into the body, pesticides on the floors are also dangerous. Residue on the floor can be absorbed through the skin, as our skin's absorption rate can be as high as 60%. Ant bate is probably the ecologically safest pesticide because the hazardous chemicals are confined to one container that is removable, and the poison is limited to the carcass of the pest that consumed it. But even bate has its issues. The poison easily seeps into the groundwater, either through its passage into ant hills or its disposal in landfills. Unless your family's water comes from a well, polluting the water supply is a longterm problem that affects the community on the whole. While it's harder to take community stewardship as seriously because, unlike the ants, this problem is abstract and distant, setting a discipline of stewardship in your family will help your children and grandchildren in future years immeasurably. The safest way to rid your laundry hamper of the ants is to stop putting milky clothes into the hamper. Instead, throw them directly into the washer, or keep a separate bag on the washer only for these items. If you can find the passage the ants are using to get to the laundry, seal it closed. If they are entering from a specific outside source, lure them away from the house with a compost pile. Orange oil poured into an ant hill often irritates the ants enough to make them move their home, which isn't a permanent solution, but is as much as most chemical ant hill treatments will also accomplish. Luring ants to move their home to a location that's easier to co-exist with is a kinder, ecologically safer solution. Above all, remember that ant bites are not dangerous. As with mosquitoes, gnats, flies, and other small pests, their appearance in your home is alarming, but the invisible presence of chemicals is the actual threat to the family.

 urlLink From Tall in the Saddle to Fatter Than Cattle : "...the shocking truth is that U.S. life expectancy is a distant 28th in the world, according to University of Munich researchers John Komlos, PhD, and Marieluise Baur. Their report appears in the March issue of Economics and Human Biology. 'The hypothesis is worth considering that this adverse development is related to the greater social inequality, and inferior health care system, and fewer social safety nets in the United States than in Western and Northern Europe, in spite of higher per capita income,' Komlos and Baur write. The researchers suggest that the welfare states of Western and Northern Europe -- much maligned in the U.S. -- may actually be providing a healthier standard of living than the U.S. system. Komlos and Baur admit that Americans have a higher per capita income. But Europeans, they note, are guaranteed a subsistence income as well as cradle-to-grave health care. At least those of us who can afford it get better health care, right? Not necessarily. The researchers note that even fully insured Americans are more dissatisfied with their health care than Europeans. 'The richest are by no means the tallest or the healthiest, or live longest,' Komlos and Baur conclude. 'They do appear, however, to be among the most overweight.'"

 As much as I want our family to have two homes, one in Houston and on in Taos, the fact remains for now that we have one. In Houston. Ella knows this place is home because that's where all her toys are. Both children are fantastic travelers, we've had them both on the road since they were a few weeks old. But Ella is certainly more of a homebody than Aidan. She's happiest to be back in the comfort zone. This morning she drug out her stuffies and arranged them all around suitcase hill (we've gotten as far as unloading the car, but we've yet to unpack). Tiger and Sherbet and Lucia and Louie Lobo and Green Man all sat around her as she watched Teletubbies. A pleasant surprise upon returning last night was a skinny black kitty sleeping on our porch. She was shy but hungry so I left her a bowl of cat food. This morning she came back and Ella thoroughly enjoyed it! She sat on the porch next to the kitty chanting "meow, meow" and trying to pet the shy, but warming to us kitty. Since Zia ran away/got stolen/met some unfortunate fate earlier this summer, I was particularly worried the universe wouldn't see us fit to ever have pets again. But here this beautiful black cat is, and maybe she'll stay. After it took several months to naturally rid our home of fleas, John's not big on the idea of another pet. But I don't see any problems with keeping a stray-turned-family-pet as an outside cat, and he's OK with that compromise. Assuming she stays, what should we name her? Perhaps she's Zia come back as a kitten. Zia 2, then? It's so lovely to have a cat around again.

And no wonder: K. provided the eggs for their conception. Those eggs were fertilized with anonymous donor sperm in vitro and implanted into her partner's uterus. On that much the two women agree. They also agree that they were in love at the time and for nearly six years were immersed together in the sweet banality of child-rearing. They even agree that on the day K. began injections to stimulate her ovaries at a San Francisco infertility clinic, she signed a consent form, which, among other things, waived her parental rights. Where they differ is over the meaning of that document, whether it trumps both genetics and K.'s personal relationship with the girls. E. says that her daughters have just one mother. K. insists that they have two; she has gone to court to prove it. When I met K., a county judge had ruled against her petition to be recognized as a parent, and she was waiting for a decision from the state court of appeals. She hadn't seen the twins, who were living in Massachusetts, in a month, and then only for eight hours. For her, the issue was simple: she wanted her daughters back. But in this age of conceptions that can be simultaneously multipartied and immaculate -- using egg donors, sperm donors, embryo donors, surrogates, even posthumous sperm -- defining parenthood has become dizzyingly complex.

 I'm blogging the trip over at urlLink the Same River Twice , in case anyone wonders where we've gone. Here in Colorado everyone is unduly worried about West Nile. Just in case this fear is going further than CO, I want to help get the word out on 1) West Nile is not very dangerous at all, in fact it acts like the flu, as it's really dangerous only to the immuno-compromised, and 2) the sprays for West Nile are actually worse for the population on the whole than the virus. urlLink Blowing the Whistle on West Nile 8/31/02 : "DEET, Anvil, and other toxic pesticides are aggressively promoted to protect the public from a mosquito bite that appears to be, statistically, less dangerous than a dog bite or bee sting. And the CDC seems to agree. On its website it says, 'Human illness from West Nile virus is rare, even in areas where the virus has been reported. The chance that any one person is going to become ill from a mosquito bite is low.' Since 1999 only a handful of deaths per year have been associated with West Nile, even though the virus has been found in 33 states. The fact that this 'health crisis' has been exaggerated, and that chemical spraying is usually the least effective yet most toxic way to control mosquitoes, has deterred some state officials, but not others. The New York State Health Department backed away from recommending wholesale spraying after finding that more people got sick from the pesticides than from the virus."

 urlLink ABCNEWS.com : Is Spraying For West Nile Pointless? :""The chemicals have not been adequately tested for their human health effects," cautioned Dr. Sheldon Krimsky, a pesticide-risk expert at Tufts University. "There is a lot of circumstantial evidence that they cause cancer in animal studies, that they are hormone disruptors. Remember, these are neurotoxins," Krimsy said, adding that most studies done on the effects of spraying focused on agricultural spraying — not spraying in populated areas. "We simply don't know what effects it's going to have, the indiscriminate spraying on human populations," he added.... "Since adult mosquitoes only live for about two weeks at the most — whether they're sprayed or not — the most effective way to limit mosquitoes is to keep them from breeding. And that means emptying out pools of water where they lay their eggs... "

 The other day I returned from my Yolanda Day and Yolanda excitedly met me at the door with the news that both children had spoken to her in Spanish. She's been watching the children on average about once a week since last September. All along, they've understood her quite well either via her excellent non-verbal communication or her easy way of instructing Spanish as she goes, but not until now have they really returned communication to her in Spanish. I have to add that my own Spanish has developped better through Yolanda than it did my entire childhood in New Mexico or through a year of Spanish at college. She's been a savior to our family in so many ways, and this is the newest amazing gift!

 I want to put the word out that we'll be selling our VW Golf (2002 TDI). It has 68,000 miles and gets about 45 mpg with the roofrack, 50 without it. If you or anyone you know might be interested in it, please let us know asap!

 Tomorrow we're hitting the road again, this time for Colorado. I thought I'd better close out the summary of the last trip, first! We had a great time, despite the illnesses. Ellie's ear infection cleared up completely Saturday morning, the first full day on the road. Thankfully, we never had to pick up the prescription of antibiotics the crotchety doctor had called in. Five or six days appears to be the standard duration for ear infections, regardless of antibiotic administration. The antibiotics merely lessen the pain and fever. But since they encourage repeat infections by inhibiting the body's immune response, I think it's wiser to choose painful once rather than annoying and dangerous over the course of childhood. In Santa Fe I bought a great new book, Kids, Herbs, and Health , at an herbalists' shop I frequent there called Herbs, Etc. Still questioning our decision to use the antibiotic on Aidan, I went strait to the page on strep throat. The authors (seasoned parents themselves) explained that between the ages of 3 and 8 strep is its most dangerous. After 8 and through adulthood, most people have an immunity to the toxins of strep that, while not protecting them from getting strep, protects them from the complications of strep that we so fear like rheumatic fever. I don't think I ever wrote it here but I found in Smart Medicine for a Healthier Child that delaying treatment of strep by three days doesn't increase complications, and allows the body to build up an immune reaction that often prevents subsequent strep infections, and we did wait three days before the antibiotic. So between these two trusted sources, I think we did make the right decision. I blogged a good deal of the trip, but it's all on urlLink the Same River Twice . Here are the trip's highlights in links: -In Santa Fe we discovered the luxury living near family could be as John and I recovered from our viruses while the healthy children romped and played with my young siblings (aged 6, 8, and 10). -We went urlLink car camping rather than backpacking as we'd planned.

 Eleanor cried out at the dinner table in utter pain, and panic at feeling utter pain. I grabbed her to me and held her close, rocking as she shrieked. No one knew why she hurt, we only knew that, suddenly, she hurt. A few moments later, Ella et al somewhat calmer, we discovered the root of the weeping and wailing as we took off her diaper, exposing a nasty, acidic BM and red, irritated skin left in its wake. Her skin is so fair and sensitive, it develops giant red whelps in response to every irritant, but this perpetrator especially looked painful. We ran an oatmeal bath and put her in it. She stood, rather than sat and if any water splashed toward her bottom she cried out "ow" with a heart piercing tone. She must have been holding her urine for fear of the pain its acidity would bring on her raw skin because in the warm water she immediately let forth a stream of pee, and proceeded to cry out at the pain it incurred. I looked at John for advice or guidance. What could we do to help her? Without speaking he began unbuttoning his shirt and took off his pants and got in the bath water. It was brilliant, the water level rose quickly and she was simultaneously immersed by the water and relaxed by dad's presence. What a dad! Oatmeal and pee and, yes, relief for all! Just before he stepped in, I had reminded him of the pee in the water. He recited rote from some space station manual, "urine is not a biohazard." True enough, it's just water and salt and a little urea, but it would have grossed me out. I watched my happy daughter and husband play with rubber duckies in the bath, loving each other, and I overflowed with love for both of them.

 In the days after Bill Cosby's infamous speech, I urlLink posted my response on both blogs. Since then, I've looked into the matter a little further, and I feel the topic deserves a follow-up. First of all, Tavis Smiley, always a fantastic and professional interviewer, had Bill Cosby on his show the week after the Washington Post turned the speech into a media foray. Smiley's interview can be urlLink heard here (the audio's in two parts, be sure to listen to both) or urlLink read here , and it's well worth hearing in its entirety. In the interview, the most striking interchange is when Tavis Smiley asked Bill Cosby about the negative reactions to his speech. Bill Cosby had previously mentioned that the high school drop-out rate for African American students is at 50%, and in response to this question he said, "...somebody took issue and tried to say that I was excusing white people from what is supposed to be happening with fairness. I'm not. I'm saying, OK, Bill Cosby never said this. He never said a thing, OK? 2 years from now, wanna make a bet on 60%? Wanna make a bet on more deaths in the neighborhood than the police are doing?" When Smiley had Cornel West on his radio show--and I respect Cornel West as one of the most brilliant minds of our time--Cornel West said of Bill Cosby that he believed Cosby's words came from a good place in his heart. I only understood this comment after hearing the above-quoted words. When I lived in Germany, so many older Germans brought up to me WWII, even though I had no accusatory feelings toward them. They would bring forth apologetic-sounding stories that explained why they felt too afraid of Hitler's government to take a stand against it. A very old man in Aachen, heard Americans were visiting his neighbors and he came over to ask if he could take Mandy (another American exchangee) and me to the American military cemetery there. He wanted to show us how Aachen had given the highest, most beautiful land (in a region under the sea level, the highest land is a really big deal) dedicated to the servicepeople who helped defeat the Nazis. It was as if the guilt of not taking a stand, even in light of the assured death of any who did, against the Nazis back then was somehow atoned by better honoring the dead of those who did take the stand. Years later, this experience still haunts and inspires my actions. It is the primary reason why I tried so hard to prevent the military action again Afghanistan and the war against Iraq. Even then, especially then, I was certain history will shine light on the US government's false motives and misguided murders in the name of the state. How could I look my grandchildren in the eye as they studied our time without doing everything in my power to stop it? I protested in Houston, Austin, Santa Fe, Taos, and Washington D.C. alongside hundreds of thousands of likeminded men and women. I wrote letters to all my political representatives, including Cheney and Bush. In the end, I can't feel like my actions did anything to stop the war machine. To the contrary, every dyer prediction written on every protest poster has come to pass. No weapons of mass destruction, no reduction in global terrorism, countless casualties... In some sort of resigned grief, John and I could only give money to Doctors without Borders, UMCOR, and others who mitigate the consequences. My only solace is that at least I was not silent. This is the tie that binds Bill Cosby's speech to myself. One has to remember that Bill Cosby's son urlLink Ennis was killed in a violent, random assault in 1997. I'm sure that this, in no small way, pressures him to speak rather than remain silent. In urlLink Culture of Fear , Barry Glassner reported that African Americans are far more likely to be the victims of violent crime than the perpetrators. As the dropout rates prove, this is only one of many ways African Americans are falling like flies from the ranks of the manifest destiny America promises. I continue to believe Cosby failed to recognize the true causative factors regarding the status of African-Americans who drop out or even commit crimes. This is a point better stated and researched in an editorial in today's New York Times by Barbara Ehrenreich called urlLink Today's Cosby Kids . In the end, I don't agree with much of what he said, or even the venue in which he chose to share it. But I do understand why he felt he had to say it.

 urlLink New 'Stepford Wives' Fuels Old Anti-Career Views : "Most striking about the re-make of 'The Stepford Wives' movie--other than the irony that women now willingly dress much like the original Stepford wives--is the difference in the central character Joanna. The movie has changed from thriller to farce, making for plenty of audience laughs but also sacrificing the heart of the original movie and book. 'Rosemary's Baby' author Ira Levin wrote the book as a thriller. The appeal of a good thriller, of course, is that the protagonist is an everyday person, such as Jimmy Stewart in 'Rear Window' or Cary Grant in 'North by Northwest.' As in a good Hitchcock movie, Joanna is our everywoman in a small, safe town. We sympathize with her because it could happen to us. In the 1975 movie, Katharine Ross' Joanna was a very likable everywoman who wanted to resume her career in photography now that her children have started school. Seeing none of the other women in town shares her desire to pursue interests outside the home, Joanna thinks she's going crazy and eventually fears for her life..."

 We worked our way through age-appropriate Duplos and toddler legos until this year, when we began to faze in the Real Legos among Aidan's toys. We waited longer than we needed to because our Ella was so very oral that we were certain she'd eat the little bricks. But in March we bought Aidan his first set of Real Legos, it was a small tractor, for the NM trip, and this trip we bought him a much larger, more complicated set (it makes any number of insects). He's tearing through it! The only downside--and I'm not sure it's such a downside--is that from the moment he first set hands on these Big Boy Lego sets, he lost his unquenchable thirst for floor puzzles. These larger Lego sets are like three-dimensional puzzles in a way, so I can understand how a boring old cardboard puzzle pails in comparison. John attributes much of his engineering-oriented brain to his childhood devotion to Legos. He's more than a little proud of the way Aidan's already doing the 5+ and 6+ level sets. I bet they curve the age levels a bit to keep kids interested, but I don't say that to John because why burst his bubble? Now we have to find space in the attic for all these giant floor puzzles until Ella is old enough to take them on! She's still taken with toddler Legos for now.

 urlLink DrWeil.com Question: Fighting Fast Foods in Schools? : "Our faculty experts agreed that the sale of fast food in schools is a particularly alarming trend that can only worsen the epidemic of obesity in the United States. Several forces are fueling the trend. First of all, many American schools are hard-up for cash. Allowing companies to install vending machines or, worse, actual fast-food operations in schools, provides revenue to school districts. Not surprisingly, the availability of mass-market fast food in schools is popular with kids, which is a rationale school officials use to justify decisions to sell it. (To make matters worse, budgetary constraints have forced many schools to curtail physical education programs so kids don’t get a chance to work off the excess calories they consume.) A recent nationwide survey organized by the Washington-based Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) found that 75 percent of drinks and 85 percent of snacks sold in schools are of poor nutritional value. The survey included 1,420 vending machines in 251 schools. An earlier (1999) California survey showed that 53 percent of school districts reporting said that their high schools sold food from nationally known fast-food chains. According to a 1996 U.S. General Accounting Office report, 13 percent of public schools nationwide that took part in the national school lunch program also sold brand-name fast foods. And that was eight years ago. Don’t look for government action to solve the problem. A move to permit the federal government to develop model nutritional guidelines for foods sold in vending machines and elsewhere in schools was recently defeated in the Senate Agriculture Committee. Senator Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) does plan to introduce an amendment to the current child nutrition legislation that would encourage school districts to develop nutrition and physical activity policies to combat the obesity epidemic. Unfortunately, the child nutrition legislation already passed by the House of Representatives would do little to eliminate junk food in schools. However, there are some hopeful signs at the local level. The Los Angeles schools have banned on-site sales of soft drinks, and the McComb, Miss., schools now sell only water and 100-percent fruit juice in vending machines with no loss in revenue after switching from sugar-laden soft drinks to healthier options (although fruit juices can be just as calorie-dense as soft drinks). In March, participants in the Conference on Nutrition & Health issued “A Call to Action that addresses the causes of the obesity epidemic. It looked toward “a new generation of fast-food restaurants with healthy offerings, modification of snack and convenience foods to conform to current nutritional guidelines, and portion downsizing.” Parents who want to fight the incursion of fast foods into schools, have to unite to exert political pressure at the local, state and national levels. To get started you might want to take a look at CSPI’s School Foods Tool Kit, a manual for parents, at www.cspinet.org/schoolfood. Best of luck. This is a good cause that can only benefit the health of children throughout the country."

 We finally made a concrete decision regarding Aidan's schooling for this year, and the road we took for the journey ended up delivering a surprise ending. urlLink Click here if you want to read about the options we faced. We remained split and waffling all week long. Toward the week's end, I called a few contacts to acquire the phone number of a parent who sends her daughter to the super cool international private school. This woman's daughter (let's call her Jill) is in the primary school, not the pre-school, and she came to this school after attending a very low-structure, let the child decide his/her way, Montessori school through kindergarten. Jill had a very emotional transition when, upon first grade at the international school, she had to adapt very quickly to structure. I asked Jill's mom if she had considered a Vanguard public school rather than this private school and Jill's mom said because the Montessori didn't push her child to learn pre-reading if Jill didn't want to, and because Jill didn't want to, she didn't test into the Vanguard program at all. And, not wanting her daughter to be in the regular public school she was zoned for, Jill's mom chose this private school. She said even through the transition to structure, the first grade instructor was so loving and flexible that Jill learned to sit in a desk and even to read at the level of the other kids eventually. She learned to write in cursive with ease, as this school doesn't teach print writing. But her experience turned more sour after the level of the first grade, when the curricula became increasingly difficult. Jill's mom said she felt the school was pushing the kids too hard to achieve too much and Jill wasn't thriving in that atmosphere. She said the school's work level remains about one year ahead of even the private schools, and that even though the school says they have 30 minutes of homework every night, in reality it was often more like an hour and sometimes even more than an hour's work. But Jill's mom didn't have any experience with the prek3-kindergarten programs, so she gave me the phone number of a mom who did. Let's call her Jane. I'm being bland on purpose here with my pseudonyms. Jane said she loved, loved, loved the programming for the levels of prek3, prek4, and kindergarten. She said one instructor was an accomplished artist and led the children in amazing creative journeys. The learning style was very play-based and responsive to the capabilities of the children. She warned that the kids did not actually come out fluent in either Spanish or French, though. She echoed Jill's mom's experience that primary school was considerably more structured and the expectations for the children's performance were very high. Within the first few years of primary school, she moved her child to a public school. The interesting point to make is that at this point in hearing everything these two moms had to say, I was really thinking, that does it then, I'm ready to switch to the international school. Aidan does well in structure, and we intend to have high expectations for his performance, as well. I know how structured and academically challenging European schools are from first-hand experience. I think these parents weren't quite as prepared as we would be for this style of learning. Jane started discussing the things she thought I would love, specifically the international peers and parents. Only, she mentioned they were all oil business parents. Knowing Jane herself was liberal, I asked her if the morals of peers raised in oil families poorly affected her children. Turns out Jane must be a blue dog liberal because she said, "oh no! Kids are way too young to pick up on morals at those ages." Hmmmm. She said families often move out within a year if they are very liberal or internationally minded because living in the south of the US is just too difficult for their morals. She also mentioned the kids got a week's break from school every six weeks. I would love that system if it were in lieu of a summer break, but it's in addition to it. It's like this school took the worst of both US and European systems: summer retention loss and constant breaks in the school year. After I got off the phone with Jane, I thought about what she'd liked about the pre-school and how she stopped liking the primary school. I realized that the pre-school is almost identical to the program Aidan's in now, and she didn't like it when it became what I thought it was already at this age, that is, academically oriented. When I called John and told him everything the two moms said, before I could even approach my conclusions, he said that he felt exactly the same way. We both agreed that as long as the schools were so similar at this age, we should keep him in the atmosphere we already know and trust. Perhaps for kindergarten, we'll move him over to transition with the other kids for the new structure and academic schedule. Through our process, my mom asked if there was middle ground between his part-time pre-school and this super cool international one. I approached the question as if she intended a different program, and I'm confident that we've found two of the best schools in the city. Certainly not the two most expensive, by at least half, but considering curricula, diversity, and faculty, really the best. Once I was back in the paradigm of staying at this school, however, I realized there was a middle ground option. He could attend his pre-school program full time rather than part, therefore 1)getting the complete, unabridged preK Prep curriculum, and 2) being eligible for an early move-up if he excelled at his learning goal acquisition. John had mentioned this option off and on through our journey and I wasn't able to consider it. But now, I'm sold on it. Once we told his school he'd be staying and we'd be moving him to full-time, we found out another huge benefit of the full-time program, by complete coincidence, is that it meets in the same building as Ellie's program. I'm so glad Aidan will be there to soothe his sister if she needs him. I think just feeling him in the other room will be a comfort to her, just as feeling John somewhere in the house is a huge comfort to me.

 These past weeks we've been wrestling with which school Aidan should go to, and knowing all along that Ellie begins her part-time program soon. The process has been great for us, it's forced us to articulate our specific hopes and desires that otherwise translate into our parenting philosophies. And everyone has a parenting philosophy, even if it's just to let pop culture at large blow their sail through the sea. I'm grateful that this week we're a little more mindful of ours. Here's blogger Julie Leung becoming more mindful of her philosophies in both parenthood and adulthood: urlLink Julie Leung: Seedlings & Sprouts: Finding the right fit : "I pointed out to the store clerk that certain styles didn't fit me well. 'It's the way my feet were made, ' I sighed, looking at a cute pair I wished I could slip on easily. 'It's the way God made you,' Michaela bubbled. From the mouths of babes. Later that night, I told Ted what she had said at the store. Talking about events of the day lead into a conversation of our life as a family. Searching for shoes, I realized, was an illustration. I wish I could wear every pair. We want to live in a one-size fits all world. People like to look and be the same. But God hasn't created us for conformity. We are all different. My feet are can only wear a certain size and style of shoe. Of the many I tried, one pair in the store fit well enough to take home. Raising our children is a process of finding the shoe that fits their feet. Or rather it's a process of seeing the size and shape of their feet as they grow, and helping them discover what works for each one of them. Trying on pairs and finding the right fit. There is something special that will fit each girl. Together Ted and I hope we can discover the Angel in the Marble so to speak for each daughter, to release in her the person God has made her to be, whoever that is, whether or not it fits into many styles, types or stereotypes..."

LaBrot, who was 15 at the time, is the youngest writer ever to win the award. This month, “Green Streak,” the pair’s second book, will hit bookstores. And a third, “White Out,” is in the works — with many more to come. Email Exercise Leads to More Hale, 44, and LaBrot, 16, are an uncle-and-nephew writing team who live about 100 miles from each other in the Dallas area. The two decided to write a book after playfully exchanging emails on a day LaBrot was feeling particularly dejected. “I was playing soccer in Dallas, and was kind of having a tough season,” says LaBrot. “One day, my uncle was trying to make me feel not so down, so he started joking around, typing things on the computer, joking about some of the people on the team, and stuff.” Hale and LaBrot then took turns, writing down a sentence at a time — and laughing a lot. “I told him to delete it, but he said ‘No, this could be good.’ The next day, we decided to start writing a book.”"

 One of my favorite activities with the kids is going to the local urlLink organic fruit and vegetable co-op . Unlike at a grocery store, here the kids get to roam around and interact with people, they help me pick items from the crates and boxes. Ellie's developed a beloved ritual of carrying her own small canvas sack around, just like my own large canvas bag. I tell her, pick two apples, and she usually gets it right. This must be the peak of the local growing season because right now the selections are so diverse and abundant. This morning I spent nearly an hour at the co-op because I kept running into people I know. I love that the co-op has turned into a community hub for the ecologically-mindful. In this city of four million people, community is vital and hard to come by.

 Ugh. Talk about your double hitters. August is basically the Monday of months. Time to get up and get going already. For me, it's time to fish or cut bait regarding Aidan and pre-school. A year ago, when we began looking into the new school, this didn't seem like such a difficult situation. I can keep him where he is, in a progressive, experience-based Piaget three mornings a week, or even five. But he'll be losing all continuity even if he stays there because so many of his classmates are leaving to full-time private schools that begin at pre-K3, his teacher changes, and the school is moving the class to a different building. A big benefit of keeping him there--that he and Ella would be in the same building when she begins her part-time program soon--is gone. While his class there begins PK-3 learning goals next month, the part-time format is certainly significantly less goal oriented. And maybe that's a good thing. I've done plenty of research this morning on the benefits of play and learning through play for children under 6. It's clear that children can thrive in this model. The alternative is a goal-oriented classroom atmosphere, which has been shown as bad for only some kids in studies, the kids who are lagging in picking up the learning skills. Apparently the play model alone protects a child in that situation from the kind of self confidence loss that can affect a child for life. Here's where I go a little off the deep end as a progressive parent though: but my son is so smart! Why waste his spurt of interest in academic learning on the more social and less achieving play-learning? He's just learned to write his first words, he loves phonics, and has great word shape recognition, and he's only 3 1/2! As long as learning in the formative years serves to teach children how to learn for their entire lifetimes, why not teach him to love learning on a steep bell-curve? Already, at pre-k3, I think he could take his Vanguard tests. These are the tests Houston children take for public school that determines where they'll funnel into for their entire learning career. Vanguard, the highest level of test results, is basically the uber-college track. If your child scores on the top 3% of Vanguard tests, you can choose which school in the entire district your child will attend. But then, he is only 3 1/2. He's pre-k3. I can always start the steep bell curve next year for pre-k4, right? Let him spend one more year primarily working on social skills, with some extra time and money going to extra-curricular activities? The other option is Super Cool International Private School, which has one huge attribute going for it: languages. Pre-K3-5 spend roughly half of their day in either French or Spanish, whatever track we choose. Aidan's already acquiring a ton of Spanish from Yolanda, so we'd pick French. After 1st grade until graduation, students can add up to five languages gradually as they master the earlier ones. Real subject matters are taught in their mastered languages. It's the second largest international school in the country, second to the UN school in NYC. It's primarily for foreign expats living in the US, because US public school isn't exactly rigorous enough to count when they get back home. This is in line with my own international experience. When I was an exchangee in Germany, my peers kicked my rear in every subject. And it wasn't just the language barrier because they would sometimes have class in English just for my benefit. Not until I began college in the US, did I feel like I caught up to the level of learning I encountered in the German gymnasium. Super cool international school will certainly provide a diverse student body culturally, but I'm worried about its diversity economically. I'm pretty sure our family's income will be among the lowest. I rationalize this fact by saying 1) his extracurricular activities will be through our neighborhood inner-city cultural center, which will expose him to much different income groups, and 2) any of my top picks for university for either myself or my kids has the exact same issue so we might as well tackle that now. Here are the biggest drawbacks: this school is full-time, and I'm not sure I'm ready for my little boy to be gone from me (and his sister) full time. Plus, it's roughly twice the money, a difference of $5000/year to $9700/year. The extra money on its tuition means we can't afford the extra-curricular music or gymnastics we'd planned to begin this year. I'm sure we'll still do soccer. After all, the Y is cheap. And maybe we could still begin Suzuki violin if we got a borrowed violin. But I also wanted to buy a piano this year. Aidan does best behaviorally, socially, and achievement-wise when he's really challenged. At the end of this past spring semester, when he suddenly became the second oldest in his little class, he received his first bad behavior reports from school. Maybe this is a good reason to start the international curriculum now. If you've read the research I posted this morning, you know that 23% of Japanese children, 60% of Swedish children, and 99% of French children are in school at age 3. I look toward these more socialized states for guidance because I know the future of their children still has a seat at the stakeholders' table. If anything, these numbers are encouraging me to lean toward keeping him in the part-time program. But I still don't know. Last night John and I couldn't sleep because we kept going over the options. We'd lay there quietly for a while thinking the other was asleep, and then one of us would put forth a new observation on the topic. This morning we awoke leaning opposite ways. By 9 a.m., we'd each swapped sides. It's August, we have to decide!

 urlLink Early years - The debate on when to start formal teaching : "She followed 16 four-year-olds through their first year at school. All the families lived in the same poor urban neighbourhood with no obvious differences in income. Eight children were from Bangladeshi families, the rest were 'Anglo' children, five white and three African/Caribbean/English mixed race. When she asked the three Bangladeshi children who seemed least interested in learning why they went to school, they surprised her by saying that they were there to study. Four months later all three had concluded that they were at school to 'play'. She found they no longer accepted their parents' message that school was about work. They believed that teachers wanted them to play and had not absorbed the unspoken message that the aim was to learn through play. In contrast, the three children who did best were Anglo pupils whose mother were aware of how children learnt through play and provided similar experiences at home. Dr Brooker found the staff were aware that differences between home and school would affect children, but believed that the play-based classroom would help to compensate by giving all children the same chances."

 urlLink EDUCATION INDICATORS: An International Perspective : "In 1992, the enrollment of 5- to 29-year-olds in formal education in the United States was in the mid-range of enrollment in the G-7 countries54 students enrolled per 100 5- to 29-year-olds. In all of the G-7 countries except Italy, approximately 6067 percent of enrollment was in primary and lower secondary education (Indicator 1). Early childhood education. Approximately 29 percent of 3-year-olds in the United States were enrolled in early childhood education in 1992. Corresponding rates for 3-year-olds in the G-7 countries ranged from 23 percent in Japan to 99 percent in France (Indicator 2). Structural differences in early childhood education systems help to explain these differences. For instance, in the United States, children begin early childhood education as early as age 3, although it is not until age 5 that the vast majority of children are enrolled. In many other countries, children typically begin early childhood education at different ages (e.g., age 2 in France and Belgium, age 4 in the Netherlands, and age 5 in Switzerland)."

 urlLink Early Childhood Research & Practice. Fall 1999. A Comparison of the National Preschool Curricula in Norway and Sweden : "In the Swedish curriculum, allowing children to have an influence on their everyday life in preschool is formulated as a specific goal. Preschool should strive to give each child adequate opportunities to develop the following abilities (Utbildningsdepartementet, 1998a, p. 14): the ability to express thoughts and opinions, and thereby gain influence on her or his situation; the ability to take responsibility for her or his own actions and for the environment of the preschool; and the ability to understand and act in accordance with democratic principles by being involved in different forms of cooperation and decision-making processes. According to the Swedish plan, democracy and aspects of it should constitute both content and method in the everyday life of children. Preschool should actively and consciously influence and stimulate children to develop an understanding of the common democratic values in our society, to make it possible for them to take part in society in the future. Preschool should strive for each child to develop the following (Utbildningsdepartementet, 1998a, p. 11): openness, respect, solidarity, and responsibility; the ability to respect and understand other human beings and their situations; the ability to discover, reflect upon, and state her or his own opinion on different ethical dilemmas and life questions in everyday life; an understanding of all people’s equal worth, independent of gender and social or ethnic background; and respect for all living species and care for our environment. Besides the more specific goals, cooperation with parents is viewed as a necessity. One of the subject areas in the Norwegian plan is 'society, religion, and ethics.' Through work in the subject area 'local environment and society,' the preschool can help children (Q-0903B, 1996, p. 65): get to know the local community through direct experience and discover how different functions in society and working places are connected and their importance for day-to-day life; realize that all people, young and old, are members of the community and that they can contribute to the community; get to know about social and cultural differences in the preschool and the local environment; and get a beginning idea of how society is built, historically and at present. The Norwegian plan says that preschool has an important function as a transmitter of tradition and should strengthen children's identity and ties with their home community by acquainting them with local history, landscape, architectural traditions, and local song and music traditions."

 urlLink SocietyGuardian.co.uk | Society | Emergency childcare for working mothers : "Working mothers are to be offered 'emergency childcare' if a childminder goes sick or a child cannot go to nursery, under plans being drawn up in Downing Street. State-registered agencies would be used to provide a last-minute service, saving women from the dilemma of whether to take time off or call in sick when normal childcare arrangements collapse. They could also help mothers with childcare during school holidays."

 Is it horribly wrong that I welcome this story because I know movements like these will give my kids a leg up in future education and job markets? Yes, and I'm sorry. But movements like these are clearly led by parents who themselves are unsure about technology so they protect themselves from the introduction into child-tech toys under a pretense of protecting the children. I see around me today that the kids who learned their tech ropes on early Atari and Nintendo games, even Telnet for the hardcore oldschoolers like John, are the highest achieving professionals. They--we--are the up-and-coming tech savvy kids these technophobes are already afraid of. And our kids are going to be amazing. I first realized this before I had kids, when I watched my then-three-year-old, now seven-year-old little sister load her own draw program, draw a picture, and then print it. When Aidan was two we gave him his first computer and he mastered it's capabilities regarding his programs. He's always been, and at one, Ellie already is, a SesameStreet.org fan. This year we're going to buy them their first game unit. These are learning tools for the new economy. It's nearly child abuse to keep them off it! urlLink Yahoo! News - Parents Reconsider Technology for Kids : "But there's growing debate over whether children should be exposed to technology so early. Some parents and scholars see no benefit, and a handful even warn of a hindrance to child development. 'Mental ability is gained from manipulating the three-dimensional world at that age and (from) managing your own mind and not having it managed by an electronic machine,' said Jane M. Healy, author of 'Failure to Connect: How Computers Affect Our Children's Mind.' Healy said computers take children away from other developmental activities more appropriate for their brains and can 'easily become a habit for both parent and child.' According to a 2003 survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, 31 percent of children age 3 and under are already using computers. Sixteen percent use them several times a week, 21 percent can point and click with a mouse by themselves and 11 percent can turn on the computer without assistance."

Most research on the children of working mothers has focused on preschoolers. But newer studies, due at the American Psychological Association meeting in Honolulu, are looking at how older kids fare. In a confidential survey, 496 teens reported habits such as drinking, smoking, drugs, sex and not using seat belts or helmets. The teenagers' mothers reported how many hours they worked."
