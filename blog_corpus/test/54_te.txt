 GUY!!!!! You sneaky little bastard!!!!! Using Your 'Go Blind' Administration rights (which I forgot I gave you) to sneak in and silently drop your new blog into the links!!!!!! I was just innocently scrolling down the blog links, just about to go to Symposiasts, then I was like 'Whoa, Hold the Phone! 'Petrol in the Car'????!!!! What the fuck is that?? I don't remember putting that there!!' It was one thing when I silently placed a link to my short lived 'serious side-project' ON MY OWN BLOG but I don't know about droping it on somebody else's..... You realise what this means, you're gonna eventually trail away from Symposiasts just like you did with Go Blind... you little blog-slut.. Whoa. this whole thing sounds kinda harsh.... its not meant to... I was just surprised thats all. Its a cool blog by the way. props.

 Loved last night's 'Newlyweds' show, amazing. Jessica Simpson and Nick are sooo lovely, and can actually sing. Funniest bit; where she had to re-record her single because she sounded too talented, too much like a singer, and the record company claimed the audience wouldn't be able to sing along...such bull-shit! ooh, and when she is amazed that buffalo wings are chicken, and that buffalos don't have wings?! Their relationship is so real, they have the same fights and anxieties as any regular couple despite super-stardom and shit... get into it, 9:30 Wednesdays, channel 10! later ooh, and the bit where nick has to sing at his grandma's wedding at a retirement home..he he

 Yay, a new poodle pad! Can't wait til the housewarming, which I'm sure will be a total booze-fest in the Perth tradition (which has now been brought to Melbs). It's ridiculous that since Panda and Erin have been here I've been seeing about as much of them as I did when they were in Perth and I was conducting my twice yearly visits. Blame the fact that I'm spending every day in front of my computer either writing essays or avoiding essays by writing a blog (like right this very moment). Also, it doesn't help that Erin and I function on different time-zones. My waking hours are from 8am til about 11pm. Erin seems to work, in a natural state, from twelve noon til 4am. Very little crossover. BTW, all you WAAPA people, you HAVE TO SEE CAMP before it gets booted out of cinemas. It is seriously the greatest film in the history of the world, and as its about musical theatre, you'll feel a natural affinity for it.

 yaaaaayyyyyyyyy! I have a gorgeous, cute, humble precious little poodle pad to call my own! My friend chris and i are signing a lease on wednesday morning and get our keys, and are moving into Holden road in North Fitzroy. Just a few sweet minutes to Brunswick street! AMAZING!!!! Erin will sleep in the lounge room every second eve which has two french doors so she can retire undisturbed and the poodle pad lives once more!! Hoorah! So all melbournites be expecting an invitation to a little housewarming in the coming weeks! Can't stop smiling about my new treasure! Love to all.....

 Sup. Jees, Furze, you are the master of procrastination. I'd like to announce that urlLink Amy's Blog is back on track... I got abused in the comments and I'm still going back for more.... then again, my bag got stolen at Cherry and I'm going back for more there too....... there's just no disciplining me... hate to think what might happen if I was an elephant near an electric fence (WHAT THE SHIT AM I TALKING ABOUT?) Just a few ditties I'd like to see on the RSL karaoke list (and I can't believe they weren't): Back in Black - ACDC Love On the Rocks - Darkness Push It - Salt n Pepa The Gentle Art of Making Enemies - Faith No More (love to sing lines: 'happy birthday, fucker' and 'cause I'm the best fuck that you ever had' to some 70 year old) And now, songs that I can't believe WERE on the RSL karaoke list: 'Don't want nothin but a good time' - Poison 'Ocean Spray' - Manic Street Preachers (their worst selling single ever) 'Girls on Film' - Duran Duran (think of the video!) .......Amongst others that I cant imagine any wrinkly havin a crack at .

 Nice one Laurie (good to see you on the weekend to BTW) I rarely grace the karaoke curcuit, although some people have been moved to say that I sing karaoke full time. Here's my top 5. 1. Janie's Got A Gun - Aerosmith 2. Emperor's new clothes - Sinead O'Connor 3. New York State of Mind - Billy Joel 4. Boys are back in Town - Thin Lizzy 5. Turtle Power - Partners in Kryme (lyrics reproduced for your pleasure) Soundtrack : teenage ninja turtle (1991) * T-u-r-t-l-e power! T-u-r-t-l-e power! T-u-r-t-l-e power! Teenage mutant ninja turtle! In a half shell, they're the heroes four In this day and age who could ask for more? The crime wave is high with muggings mysterious Our police and detective are farious, ,cause they can't find the source. Of this lethally evil force This is serious so give me a quarter I was a witness, get me a reporter! Call april o'nail in on this case, and You'd better hurry up, there's no time to waste! We need help, like quick, on the double Have pity on the city, man it's in trouble! We need heroes like the lone ranger When tonto came pronto, when there was danger They didn't say they'd be there in half an hour, ,cause they displayed…turtle power! [refrain] (2 times) Now our miss reporter was hot on the trail Determined to put these crooks in jail She spied the bad guys and saw what happened, But before she knew it, she fell in a trap and caught! Yeah, she was all alone With no friends, and no phone Now this was beyond her wrost dreams, Cause she was concered by some wayward teens Headed by shredder they were anything but good Misguided, unloved, they called them the foot They could terrorize and be angry youth, and They mugged the people. who needed proof? Then from out of the dark came an awesome sound! Shouted "cowabunga!" as they hit the ground From the field of weeds the heroes rescued the flower Cause they possessed…turtle power! Do you stand for what you believe in? And find the strength to do what's right? That's turtle power! Heroes in half shell, they're on a mission When there's a battle got the enemy wishin' That they stayed at home, instead of fightin' These ninja masters with moves like lightnin' They were once normal, but now they're mutants Spinter's the teacher so they are the students Leonardo, michaelangelo, and donatello, Make up this group with one other follow Raphael, he's the leader of the group Transformed from the norm by the nuclear goop Pizza's the food that's sure to please, These ninjas are into pepperonI and cheese Back to the story, it's not hard to find Ninjas not just of the body but of the mind These are the words that their master instructed, But a letter from shredder has splinter abducted That was the last straw, spring into action Step on the foot, now they're goona lose traction Now this is for real, so you fight for justice, Your shell is hard so you shout, "they can't dust us" four! Like some old coffee table Since you were young you've been willing and able To defeat the snake, protect the weak, Fight for rights and the freedom to speak Now the villian is showin' so you take a stand Back to the wall, put your sword in your hand Remember the words of your teacher, your master: "evil moves fast, but good moves faster!" Then light, shining for your illumination Good versus evil equal confrontation So when you're in trouble don't give in and go sour, Try to rely on your…turtle power!

List your fave karaoke tunes (be original, I don't wanna see songs like 'holy grail' etc) Mine - Total eclipse of the heart - Eternal flame - anthing by Spice Girls - I'm every woman - whitney - leader of the pack (never on the song list tho) more to come..

 Ahoy-Hoy Well its finally happened. Last night My family reached the height of Buntine-ness. It all started on Thursday night, when my Mum and Dad stopped in for a quick beer at the local RSL, granted they are about 40 years before their time to be going there but my dad is a sucker for cheap meals and beer. Dad enters a raffle (its for a good cause) and ends up winning first place: 100 FREE POTS OF BEER. So last night, Miranda, Ian, my Bro, Mum, Dad and Myself sit down and get stuck into it. At around the 70 pot mark, the oldies at the RSL crank up the karaoke machine......oh man it was all down hill from there, especially after we found out they were giving away hampers of alcohol to any old participant. So we sang Mona (by Criag McLaughlin), Horses (need I say who by) but I think the highlight was me and Ian singing God Gave Rock nRoll To You to a packed house, most of whom were 60+. W ended up walking away with 3 hampers!! Man, we worked that room like there was no tomorrow, we had people swaying right up to the cheap seats (i.e mum flapping her arms around at the back) I even managed to add the spoken word part (one my favourite lyrics of all time) which I better add to................... Quote of the day: 'God gave you a gift! God gave you a role! and that role's name is ROCK N ROLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!!!'..............ahhhhh the gift that keeps on giving

 dont you hate it when you blog then you go back a like a day later eager to read some news, and yours is still the most recent blog? all you get to do is read what's going on in your own life, which i would pressume is information you already know. anyway that's my beef for the day.

 hi blog felt like a while since i contributed to this scheme so here i am. but have tragically little to report. have a fucked up mouth cauuse my wisdom coming through like a mo-fo, so on almost liquid only diet, sucks, although has reminded me how much i love hungry jacks vanilla thick-shakes. shayne might come to the show next wed, what you think? you be around patrolling in a PM sort of manner? ps is going to be 40 again in perth on weekend, isnt it supposed to be autumnal you bureau of meteorolological mo-fo's? thats all - im fucked going to find more food to vitamise in the yee oldie spirit of the nursing home.

 Erin I wouldn't lose sleep, your career is definetly not over before it's begun. The good news is that the lead players in the music industry have all fucked up to the tune of millions of dollars and still managed to hang in there and thrive. Some shitty melbourne band booker trying to save his own arse and blasting you in the process don't mean nuthin. He's probably more pissed off at himself for not doing his job properly. Also, store his name in your memory. One day he'll come crawling to you for a favour and you'll be able to deal with him in kind. Some call it Karma, it certainly all goes around and comes around. I'm pretty much known for my dire forecasts and diagnosis of the music industry, but if anyone here takes more than a passing interest in the mechanics of the beast take heart from the charts this week. John Butler Trio is a shining and prominent example of how you need not work within the old, outdated framework of the industry establishment in order to achieve sucess and have a fruitful and artistically rewarding career. JBTrio funded their first album and have funded their own recordings ever since, which they put out through an independant distributor. This means that, not only do they have no label to answer to commercially or atristically, but they personally pocket $10 from every album sold (Compared to the $1.70 industry average). The major way they market their music is by extensive touring, which they profit greatly from anyway. They keep their overheads low and don't spend money unneccisarily on mainstream advertising and marketing campaigns. They built up the reputation and popularity of their act over several years, having then patience not to ever try and hype their way into everyone's conciesness. Their label mates, "The Waifs" have followed a similar career path, with fans all over the globe and very profitable concert tours. This week John Butler Trio debuted #1 on the Australian Charts with their new album "Sunrise Over Sea", selling a massive 25,000 units in only it's first week of release. This is an amazing achievement for an independant act and a level of success and profitability that Australia's major labels can only dream and hopefully aspire to. In reality the success of JBT should be a massive fucking wake-up call to the majors. It should spell out that the days of signing some act just because everyone else wants it, while having no vision for the act nor any idea of how to develop it other than to throw huge bundles of cash around and hope that something sticks are over. That spending more on marketing and the paychecks for outdated, dinosaur execs than on development is stupid. That signing acts that will do well with 14 year old girls for about a month before dissapearing is short-sighted and ultimately unprofitable. That signing acts that simply ape what was popular six months ago is not progressive, imaginative or very smart. That the internet was the most exciting music delivery system to emerge in 1996 and that being eight years behind such a crucial technology and failing to see it's potential is unforgiveable and incredibly fucking incompetent. That bitching, whining and sueing fans now that the downloading horse has bolted is pointless. That telecommunications companies are acting more efficiently as record companies with their ringtones then the actual companies are. That their days are numbered and and unless they repent and change they will eventually dissapear to be replaced by a system that is more efficient and kinder to artists and fans. I'll now quietly step off my soapbox...

 wowy...what an awesome night was had by me at hifi bar. Was so impressed by elbow, what a great set, heaps of songs from asleep in the back, performed seemlessly, effortlessly, beautifully....esp Newborn... that blew me away. Great crowd, great lighting, great sound, great gig. And very pleasantly surprised by cut copy, seeing as i had never heard any of their stuff....and so cute too! Thanks to Craig for the tix, what a little gem.

 yes yes the cunt who stole my bag (phone, wallet and fresh pack of ciggies) is a complete ASS-BANDIT! Meanwhile the consolation of my amazing new phone which does everything short of making a coffee for me in the morning, is quite an entertaining delight. Its one of the few things in my life which i can turn to at any minute of the day or night to make me smile........(cue post-adolescence world-owing-me-something monologue here) ......... I am actually now in fear of despising the music industry as well (although I'm surprised it didn't happen sooner) after getting the shit blasted outta me by an ABSOLUTE CUNTY-CRAPBAG band booker from a well known city venue which shall remain nameless, for something that wasn't even my fault, in fact, it WAS HIS.....the fuckin little cock-jockey..... so now I'm sitting here hoping my music-related career hasn't ended before its begun... lucky for me i get to go to an awesome gig tonight ....that is ELBOW (supported by CUT COPY :)) and hopefully Placebo tomoz.... so I'll be back with reports. Love yas! ps- Hannah. where the hell are ya? oh and Shayne, where the hell are ya?

 It's amazing how all sympathy for Erin's plight with the lost handbag dissapated the instant she got home with a better phone than me and Panda. It's almost like the scene from"American psycho" where Patrick Bateman thinks murderous thoughts apon his workmate because he has a nicer business card. Mobile phones used to be such a status symbol. Now it's just about how many gimmicks you can fit into a tiny plastic casing. Take Erin's new phone - It has a camera (With a flash!), it connects to the net, it has bluetooth, it checks email, it sends pictures, sounds and movies, it stores 687 names, it has a diary, an organiser, a calculator and 24 different versions of Tetris. It has a clock on either side of it that even turns into a vanity mirror. It slices, it dices. It does your homework, washes your car and remembers to put the bins out. It can locate Bin Laden, it can produce a Jay-Z album. Last night I spent fifteen minutes watching Erin open and close the damn thing just so she could hear it go "Bing!" Thank god for technology...

 here here leon.....Malena from average joe is a stupid fucking hoe bag slutguts. Sorry to steer the blog back to the real world furze! I can't believe she picked Jason...erin and I were basically in tears. She really did not make the wisest decision (i know i am completely lame...my life revolves around trashy tv, sushi and tequila), but what has Jason got? As far as i can see; bad skin, no job, no prospects, no money...and he is a total player....trying to get her drunk so she can "lower her inhibitions"????? That doesn't even make sense! On the other hand, Adam is so adorable, so sweet, so thoughtful, and not really all that average, being a millionaire and all. How hilarious when he got her Victoria Secret pjs and that big pink dog teddy which he set fire to with the billion candles he laid out all over the room!! classic stuff. Oh well, Adam is now set to star in his own spin off reality dating show, as they all do, like that complete dick with the stupid laugh from the last one of those shows....cant remember his name, not important anyway. May have been rob...anyway..... On a more serious note, some fucking moron stole erin's bag last night from Cherry. And they must have done it while we were standing right next to it. Poor poodle, her last 50 bucks, beloved phone with the ball game, various cards (that are such a fucking bitch to replace), and whatever else a poodle carries around with her on a saturday evening. Well my offer still stands Erin....you can have anything that i have got that you might want, to cheer you up! And if i find out the mother fucker that stole it....beware the wrath of panda! Furze...your eyes did not decieve you, i was, in fact, mega dirty pashing a gay man. However, i was just a pawn, god knows what buff, bronzed man was being imagined while i was being mauled! Not a bad pash though for a gay boy!! And just so you know, gay men find me more desirable than straight...i think i have pashed more gay than straight. Jesus, imagine if i moved to sydney...i wouldnt have a night off!!!! Oh and erin seems ok now...she has just got home with a brand new, specky LG phone that is way better than my 7250i, so you cant have anything of mine now because youve got a better phone than me! Love to all Leon...i dont want to know what mischief youve been up to...and dont say you havent, because i havent heard from you in two days....how weird is that...ive been ditched.

 Was reading the paper yesterday when it occurred to me that there is the slightest, most minimal chance that Howard, Bush and Blair could all be voted out of office within the next twelve months. The thought of the three blokes responsible for so much that is not good being simultaneously swept from office filled me with so much joy I nearly choked and my cornflakes (which were as always covered in huge quantities of vanilla yogurt, the only way to start the day). Does anyone else feel a gathering sense of excitement from the opinion polls lately that say Labor would win by a landslide? I haven't been this happy since Jeff got the arse by a record margin in 1999. Hate getting too political on this here bloggy blog, but responsible social and economic policy still means something to me and I can't wait to vote for a viable alternative to the current mob. Went to Canberra a couple of weeks ago and talked to a lot of people in public office. Already large numbers of public servants and departments are re-aligning their offices in preperation for a change of government, perhaps the best indication yet that somethin's about to happen. Welcome with open arms Mr Leon to the blog. That last post cracked me up! May your adventures continue to appear in this here blogg. Gardiner, if you're reading this, Incubas are confirmed to play Rove. Probably a stupid question but let me know if you want to be in the audience. That goes for anyone else in melbs...

 Come one come all and read my blog. The World has stopped ... i am in BrisVegas. I have my cowboy hat on, my white pants, hawaiin shirt and i am ready to go. I made the flight on Virgin airlines on Saturday and i am sure that you all realise that it would have to be the most unglamourous airlines to travel in the entire universe and as you are aware i am far from unglamm. Anyway to cut a long story short i dont do very well with having a bloody aisle seat, being served by girls wearing cardigans and blue plastic rubber gloves, being harrassed like a mofo about needing a panadol.....NOT PANADEINE... for a bloody headache, only serving bacon as a choice piece of food...... yeah a pig at 3000miles so classssy.... Anyway without sleep i arrived in Brisbane. TO my amazement it was so fuking hot i couldnt breathe and went straight into the toilet to get changed into short and a tshirt..... totally hideous conditions for my first stay. Anyway met up with my friend Trindy and we went to grab some breakfast.. So assured of the idea that Brisvegas was full of absolute freaks. This notion was right and i will divulge. The waitress who popped out behind the bar was thin... when i say thin i dont mean the kind of thin you say about celebs i mean the kind where your knee bones are so sharp and pointy you could carve lamb...... anyway not important, was is important is how 2 seconds seconds later this guy came in so fat that he needed to sit on the couch, next a guy in a suit so short his feet could not touch the ground, then 10 mins later a guy came in who was so tall he had to duck when he came in the door......................... very fucking freaky i say. Well i went back home and spent the entire day asleep ..... no suprised how traumatised i was from the experience.. I then spent the night watching Meet Average Joe ............. could you believe that piece of shit..... putting that poor average men through that fucked experience with those hot guys. Now while in certain areas of my life i like everything picture perfect their is more to life than the surface.. What the hell was she thinking,,,,,,, i couldnt believe it. nearly fell off the back of the chair when she chose the guy with the perfect looks...... WHAT A SKANKY WHORE..... SHE IS A TOTAL SLUT AND I HATE HER....... ANYONE AGREE. Meanwhile caught the bus down to Byron Bay this morning.... my life is so galmmaaaaaaaaaaaaa. i feel like its an episode of Kath and Kim. The bazarre thing about the trip was all those wierd theme parks..... whats the deal.. Anyway when you travel one hour down the coast you go into a different time slot because of daylight saving, how bizarre. SO i went one hour forward by going one hour down........ does that make sense. I have spent the whole day hiking through the rainforrest and learning from Robert how to cook. He made Pavlova.................. again another K$K special (kath and Kim for all you slowies). Well i better go outside and play with the butterflies..... love to you all... 1) Shane i hope that you are welllllllllll, where are you when i need you 2) poodle, piche and Bunts loooooooooooooooooove you work girls 3) Tiff and Trennnnn you rock my world (wedding temp rising) and to the rest of the Blog world, which ever timeslot you are in goodnight and farewell... all my love LEON PS FORGOT to tell everyone not to worry, my life is now back on track, i will not spend the rest of the year in a silk gown, sipping cosmos and eating dip... that time of my life has ending................. well until poodle comes to stay with me!!!!!!

 Panda you are a beautiful, affectionate poodle and I know that you like to spread the love but did I see you locked in passionate embrace with a gay man? I must admit that the scene caused me great amusement. Now you are turning gay men straight. Is there no end to your poodle powers? Rockroom keeps throwing up the funniest nights of my life... Just booked tickets to the coachilla festival, a massive 3 day rock festival in the californian desert. Most amazing lineup, and probably wouldn't have even discovered the whole shebang if it wasn't for Erin blogging about it (thanks girlfriend). In addition I'm doing a 3 week road trip through america with my compadre Benno. Think two guys in a big Caddillac travelling through Nashville and doing there best to accurately re-create scenes from "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas". Hopefully I'll be able to blog some sort of road diary for y'all...

 buntine sorry i havent called you back, keep remembering when im nowhere near a phone. hope all team melb enjoyed the pub hol yesterday. im going to cook risotto havent had it in ages, mmmmmmmmm note of warning - do not attend boring parties with boring people you have no interest in if A) you havent eaten dinner/ lunch B) there are people constantly feeding you cheap chanpagne/ wine in plastic cups. C) you exchange talking to these losers with consumption of their alcohol.......... take it from me can lead to depressingly hammered state and perhaps chunderous vomitting. gross. spewing when you havent even had a good time being drunk is just shit.

 for anyone who's interested, I've been doin a blog-surf, and chucked some interesting links to your left......

 Has anybody else been having dreams recently where Reggie from Big Brother 3 makes cameo appearances??

 hmmm I've come to the realisation that my life is ridiculously fun, hilarious, outrageous and stupid, and I earn absolutely no money (apart from my $20 a week from uncle johnny, he's oh so generous) I mean, I go out almost every freaking night and get ab-sol-utely trashed (not just drunk) and various establishments then somehow stumble home at around (average time) 4am, then (4 days a week) get up at 7am (usually still drunk) and go to Tafe then do it all again. I feel like I'm reliving last year! except that i actually do constructive things as well. I've also come to the realisation that I might actually die soon. I mean, most people pay attention to the warning signs that their bodies give them..... when I die my mind is gonna pissed off: (roleplay) brain : why the hell didn't you warn me this was gonna happen? body: how many warnings do you need? brain: what the fuck are you talking about? body: ok, I gave you a severe headache for a week and a half for which you were prescribed pannedine forte brain: yeah....... body: I made you pass out at the dinner table and you almost smashed your head into your food brain: oh yeah......... body: you've thrown up in the toilets of almost every bar in melbourne brain: i guess so..... body: and after each and every incident you went to a bar and continued to get wasted brain: so......... body: SO DON"T FUCKIN BLAME ME MOFO! brain: oh............ok. BUT ITS ALL GOOD FUN!

 So, it is blogs birthday, and i dedicate last night to it! An evening of true debauchery on my behalf once again...Erin and Furze can vouch for this. I talked to a drum that was sitting seat belted in the back of furzikins tarago, marvelled for a long period at the possums on the powerlines at 1am, convinced some indian and english tourists that i drove a formula one at the grand prix and hosted a cartoon show (nice touch furze), had an in depth conversation with a cabbie that involved me repeating the same words over and over again without realising, waking up a random room of people at pony that had somehow all simultaneously fallen asleep at 3am in a roaring pub (which erin titled a german art installation), pashed pashed and pashed again, and the list goes on! I believe that tequila has some kind of magical effect on me, and furze i think on you too, as soon as consumed i actually can not stop laughing....it's laughing juice! And there does'nt even have to be anything to laugh at. Furze, we must investigate further..... So happy birthday bloggy....don't say i never do anything for you! i love melbourne

 I'm back alive and well!! So good to be home its unbelieveable! Adelaide was an interesting trip never to be repeated again... So firstly, happy b'day to the blogg... Secondly sorry never made it to Melbourne, qantas would'nt allow it! So i'm feeling a little weird, not a lot of people around these parts of town... missing you guys terribly. Would like to catch up with those who are still in Perth at the scotties or somethin and talk about those who aren't... (hannah,leon,tiff,noni,tren etc...) Hope all is well with everyone over in melbs! Just wanted to say a quick hi to all....

 Yes...shayne you have a very neat way of saying things that i'm sure everyone thinks but does not have the eloquence to convey....well i'm speaking for myself here anyway, actually probably only for myself! i'm with poodle........eeeeeeeeehhhhhhhh......eeeeehhhhhhhh..........shayne. Wishing love and good luck to my Leon in Brisvegas....you go schmooz your hot little ass off (i didnt mean that literally!)XXXOXOXOOXXOXOOXOXOX

 OH Shayne....... that was really sweet!! I really wanna print it out and frame it but it belongs here and nowhere else.......... eeehhhhhhh shayne.... i love you....ehhhh. GUY!!! I lost the 'comments' can you please find them?

 WELL HAPPY BIRTHDAY GOBLIND@BLOGSPOT.COM... I must admit that since erin squeezed you out, you have developed into quite the post-modern, information dissemination platform. Or to put it another way... you have become a fascinating, integral and voyeuristic pitstop in my day to day life. You represent an abstract and unfocused distillation of what we think is important, the things we want to reveal about ourselves, our belief systems, our tastes, our flights of fancy, our whimsical musings, our accute observations, our fears, our dreams and most importantly a lasting record of a most remarkable set of relationships. Its strange that many of the throw away comments made in this forum, actually combine to present a wonderfully revealing, warts and all picture of those that made them. Blog is a strange little miracle of the modern age, a document that hints at honesty and community. The sum total of whatever we felt like contributing. and look at what we made...

 ok this colour scheme is some kind of compromise........ i wasn't a fan of the 70s beige myself, but can't be bothered thinking too had about these things, one day I'll stop fucking around with it and actually take on a professional template..... until then the colours are all too inviting..

 Shit WAAPA scandals, forgot those things existed. have just sunk further into my chair at the realistion and breathed sigh of relief i am no longer any part of them, thank you very much. go President Shayne, am sure your diplomacy and addiction to making tools around you look like the dweebs they are will save the day. Ps is there a hot girl in first yr SM? god five lines of WAAPA banter, i have to go clense myself..........

 Greetings and salutations fellow bloggers...was that festive enuf for a bday message? am back at uni, in my 5th year, hangin with the 1st year students in my repeat classes... has anyone noticed that the fashion at uni is resembling temptation island stylz? anywhoo, I had better get back to my office at uni where I regularly occupy myself by stealing my roomates cookies from his cookie jar when he leaves. Mamma Laurie's cooking tip of the day: AC's (Kmart brand) Decandent chocolate cookies are prime!...taste better if they are someone elses... peace

 FUCK....!!!! Today is officially my crappest day in 2004... WHY??? Those that care may ask... well to cut a long story short, I am at the centre of a WAAPA scandal that involves new staff members, offensive anonymous e-mails, 1st year lighting and as of today the rest of WAAPA. More on this later... Blog looks gross

 erin i don't want to spew on this new blog format cause it looks like someone has beaten me to it....... did you or did you not go to design school for three years, can you not tell when something looks ugly? please remove. take this not as a request but as an order. thank you. also has anyone debriefed on how fucking dumb jessica simpson and her newly- weds program is, or does this not need further comment? i thought not.

 this blog is a dark little place where we confess our dark little secrets about our dark little lives. Now it feels like we're lounging around in a beige 70's waiting room exposed in all our ugliness by harsh flourescent lighting and the even uglier thought that NOW PEOPLE CAN SEE US! Please go back to black soon... or tartan, that would be cool... Does anyone remember that mysterious globe symbol that used to sit in the top left corner? Whatever happened to that? Or when we used to link to sky kicking? Or when Laurie D used to blog about her hockey adventures? Or when I used to write big long sermons on the ills of the music industry like I was lecturing some TAFE... those were the days...

 OK, YOU MIGHT WANNA SPEW ON THE NEW LAYOUT, BUT I'M JUST TESTING OUT THE COLOUR SCHEME FOR MY WEB DESIGN ASSIGNMENT.

 Oh no! 'HANNAH ETHO DESIGN' has a prowler............ hang on a second........ who the fuck tries to rob a FLORIST? What the hell? Did they think they were in 'Adaptation' thinking that the Spanna's protecting some rare ghost orchid? aghh i'm getting kicked off the school computer

 wow bloggie got so many pals wishing it happy birthday........ number one, the big uno.... think i'll get bloggie a little rattle or a stuffed toy of a water pistol thing.... they are appropriate pressies for one year olds. just been long weekend in perth for those not in the know...so good feels like so long since i saw a flower. just lots of boozin by the pool....... also my little DES studio had an intruder last night looking for my cash - but he got nothin, mostly cause there is none at my shop. so i got to talk to police constables and such and sound important, me being the "property owner" / leaser...whatever, i was in charge. they didnt even smash any vases, gee i want to smash vases and they are even mine so why wouldnt they?? so happy b'day blog etc - ps shayne want to hook up for a drink this week? feels like ages...

 My life is a disgusting, lonely mess... I have no one to watch the oscars with. woe is me... ... oh yeah blah blah blah happy birthday blog

 Let's call next Friday 5th March the "Official Birthday". As shayne suggested, on this day all bloggers, past and present, must post something of note. love to all

 Yes friends its Bloggy's first birthday!! awwwww..... I can't believe its been a year since I ...well......gave birth ...to it (????!!!???) In celebratin of this, please note that I have indeed changed the colour of the title, and added the profound words 'Birthday' and 'Edition' this simply means that all posts for this month shall carry some kind of 'birthday spirit'.... although I'm not completely sure what that means. that is all.

 I've had six hours sleep and now i am at uni........ blah blah blah.... Actually, I was just thinking how lucky we are to have blog.

 yeah... I just pulled a fourteen hour shift at Blockbuster Galleria... Besides being tired, having sore feet and a profound desire to spend the rest of my life silently horizontal. I am actually surprised. Surprised that the bogans i serve (SO WIERD TO USE BOGAN AND SERVE IN THE SAME SENTENCE), are actually starting to hear what i've been saying all this time about qualitative film experiences. I have a hard core clientelle of recently converted (perverted) bogans who can't get enough of the smaller, non-studio, foreign, edgy, a grade/b grade, socially relevent, totally irrelevent and offensive film material that i keep putting in their grease stained, tobacco yellowed, peroxide smeared little hands. Amazing....!!! Thats all really... just needed a lil' blog to unwind. Had a wierd day missing you guys today. love to all oh yeah, Furze i should be over in early - mid april (fingers crossed). and I think we should celebrate the birth of blog with a commerative, compulsory blog day were everyone with access must contribute something of significance.... just a thought. nuff said

 ps my previous post is very perth orientatedm, sorry to all melb crew who have a thousand streets as cool as oxford...........

 hey bloggers just scrolled down the blog to see when my last entry was and it seems to have been so far into the past that it no longer rates a mention on the current page. thus i thought it was about time i got off the bloggin sidelines, reading and not participating, and through a spanner in the works........so to speak. totally non-related point of interest for my day was heading into oxford st leederville for about the first time in six months and a) remembering how good the st itself it is, great cafes, great clothes/ homewears etc b) that really good looking funky people stiil also exist - they just hang out in leeds and not claremont - no surprise there. c) diference between a good coffe and a shit coffee is so extreme they shouldnt be referred to as the same beverage. d) a point not really restricted to leederville - there are so many wicked fashion/ design mags to buy (or read in the newsagent) if you look in the right places and, they do not have the words cleo or cosmo on the front. anyway am going to a casino high rollers 21st tonight am going to attempt to look like any of the girls off "LAS Vegas" think if i refrain from wearing a top i might be on the right track..........or could always wip up a life sized poker chip cossie......... mmmmmmm later team - H

 This week I'll be doing a feature on the handful of albums that have shaped me to be the person you see today. I was inspired to to do this after I blew the dust off my copy of The Cure's 'Pornography' last night and gave it a spin. Man oh man did the memories come flooding back. To those unfamiliar with The Cure's work other than their sugary fun hits like 'Friday I'm In Love' , 'High', 'Lovecats', 'Just Like Heaven' etc I imagine them to be portrayed as a slightly wierd yet ultimately superficial band with some fat dude up the front with big hair and make up. But what never ceases to amaze me and the main reason why I love the band so much is the vast scope of emotion they've poured into all their songs over the past 25 years. Ok, granted the Cure's lineup has basically changed every 2 years which will account for the amount of variety in their music, but good ol' fat Bob keeps on rockin and I have no idea how he survived writting this album. 'Pornography' has often been voted 'the darkest' or 'most depressing' album of all time by the likes of NME, Rolling Stone etc. But the words 'dark' and 'depressing' don't even begin to describe how horribly heart breaking this album really is. It was actually quite firghtening to realise that these songs were once so much a part of my life that they were basically my soundtrack. Every track swirls and washes into another with a deep grief, the lyrics bring up images of black haired girls, hanging gardens, black flags, and who can forget : 'A hundred years of blood, crimson, the ribbon tightens round my throat, i open my mouth, and my head bursts open, a sound like a tiger thrashing in the water, trashing in the water' . It was actually rumoured to have been written about the suicide of Joy Division's Ian Curtis a year before its relaese in 1982. What makes me most uncomfrtable about listening to this si the fact that Robert Smith actually lived on to write such stupidly happy songs like 'Lovecats' and 'Mintcar', at least when you listen to Joy Division , you pretty much know what you're gonna get, this might sound wierd, but the fact that Ian Curtis died brings some kind of sick comfort. 'Pornography' is just disturbing. Admittedly yes, I do suffer from manic depression (like every other fucker on earth) and this album might not be for everyone, but its definitely worth a listen. I'll leave you with the lyrics to my favourite Cure song ever, track 4 on Pornography..... SIAMESE TWINS I chose an eternity of this Like falling angels The world disappeared Laughing into the fire Is it always like this? Flesh and blood and the first kiss The first colours The first kiss We writhed under a red light Voodoo smile Siamese twins A girl at the window looks at me for an hour Then everything falls apart Broken inside me It falls apart The walls and the ceiling move in time Push a blade into my hands Slowly up the stairs And into the room Is it always like this? Dancing in my pocket Worms eat my skin She glows and grows With arms outstretched Her legs around me... In the morning I cried Leave me to die You won't remember my voice I walked away and grew old You never talk We never smile I scream You're nothing I don't need you any more You're nothing It fades and spins Fades and spins... Sing out loud We all die!!! Laughing into the fire... Is it always like this?

 Don't think I can wait 2 months to see the "Hot Property" tape. Too funny. Don't have long so I'll make this a quick travel update for anyone that cares... The musical odessey of a road trip that started in Nashville (country and bluegrass), continued in Memphis (birth of rock and soul), is reaching it's conclusion in New Orleans (Jazz and Blues). The whole trip has been an amazing experience and a lesson in how much you really don't know about music. Hit New Orleans last night, it's mega touristy on the main strip but an absolute alcoholics delight. Every drink in every bar is custom made to get you smashed. They also serve it plastic cups and you can just walk out of the bar if you like and drink in the street. There is even little vendors selling $2 beers at the hotdog stands. What seemed fantastic about all of this last night is a little less thrilling this morning coupled with a giant hangover. No more hurricanes for me... Leaving for LA on friday and then Coachella festival on the weekend. Pixies, the cure, darkness, radiohead (full gig report please erin), muse and SLEEPY JACKSON!!! woohoo! umm, yeah... Gonna be quite a riot. love to all of you, happy birthday shayne, elanor you rock, hugs and kisses to the poodles. hope you are all well and happy Andrew

 Ok for those who missed my family on Hot Property last night, I think they're gonna be on it next week as well. But oh my lordy lord.... that was hilarious! My brother looked completely GAY! I can't believe how gay they made hime look Ahhhhahahaha. I guess this is only funny if you're aware that my brother is like the straightest guy like...ever ! And he's on national televion in some hideous pink candy stripe shirt and tie surrounded by tables with huge hot pink bows on them going 'Yeah I'm an Events Coordinator, today we're going for a ' racing' theme... appropriate cut to mum sitting in her pink tinted sunglasses stroking our toy Pomeranian sitting on her lap! hilarious! can't handle....... it was so funny I almost exploded..... ah finally Fudge is a star.... Meanwhile Elanor, I stand corrected. Went to Rove last night... Jet were on... they were standing a metre away from us... They kept staring at me and Alana cause we were the only ones they could see... They were wearing leather... and..... i gotta admit..... THEY WERE FUCKING HOT! SO HOT I ALMOST COULDN'T HANDLE IT yes the bass player is the hottest, only coz I've gotta MAJOR thing for porn star facial hair at the mo' So we left via the guest entrance and I'm running down the corridor with leon sceaming 'CAN THEY GET ANY HOTTER?' when we walk straight past them having a ciggie.... how embarrassing..... meanwhile rumour has it they're playing a secret gig at Pony on Saturday night at 4am

 phew.... still gainfully (?) employed....

 OH YEAH! And my family is on Hot Property TONIGHT! Sorry about the false alarm last time But its definitely on TONIGHT CHANNEL 7 7:30pm hilarious

 yo. Check out Elanor's post at Symposiasts to read my exact feelings about the gig last night (man that's lazy blogging). Radiohead were amazing beautiful, electric and magnetic as usual. A wonderful wonderful gig. And what's with bars not being open on Monday nights? Imean sure it was pouring with rain but cmon! Thank god for the Vineyard, always a trusty friend. PS - Comments not working properly, if you wanna read them click where it says 'Edit Comments' on the pop-up. PPS- Shayne I'm more than surprised you've kept your job this long!

 hmmm... or should i say grrrrr! i'm at work... i just finished telling a horrible, skank, whore of a customer that "perhaps it would be better if she came back between 9 and 5 tomorrow and bought her shit from the manager, as I am no paid enough to pretend to like her or put up with her personality which by the way i find completely offensive" i hope i still have a job tomorrow...

 Hmm, I been thinkin, there are quite a few things to look forward to at the moment, let me just name a few: - Radiohead tonight!!! (yay!) - Elbow guest programming rage this Saturday - Me going to Perth in exactly a month - Muse touring in Septemper with 67 Special - Franz Ferdinand tour - Electric Six tour - PJ's new album, which sounds awesome so far, and tour - Me finally getting to go to Livid this year so it better be a bloody good lineup, equal to those I've missed - New rock bars opening in the city - My exhibition ... he he he gonna be so fun - Finally getting some money tomorrow, so i can actually afford to get to school - and did I mention Radiohead tonight ? yeah baby! So all 'n' all I guess life aint that bad at the mo' keep on truckin.

 Can't believe I forgot to write this yesterday but: HAPPY MOTHER FUCKIN BIRTHDAY SHAYNE! hmm.... probably shouldn't have put the 'mother fuckin' in, as birth can kinda fuck a mother up... let alone the bad context of fucking your mother and...... oh god, I'm in too deep. I'd also like to voice my disgust for AMERICAN IDOL for kickin out Jennifer, man the American public should be ashamed of themselves, and to think that talentless fucker with the red hair is still in it. Thank god it wasn't Fantasia, girrrl i love you, and thats somethin. Meanwhile in other unoriginal news, Popstars sucks so hard that I feel like I'm watching DIY television. Wait a minute, I guess I kind of am, it is channel 7.

 i realise the blog looks gross its under construction.....

 just a few things to comment on as I wind up the week: - Urinetown, the Musical is freakin awesome, I never thought I'd live to see the day when I actually enjoyed watching Lisa McCune perform, let alone enjoyed a musical in general, but this show is a bloody corker and if you have the opportunity to see it, do yourself a bloody big favour. - I'd like to congratulate all those who participated in my test about me , especially Miranda for topping the class with 90%, Hannah coming in second with 75% and an equal tie thrid with Anna and Laurie on 70%. Top work. Meanwhile Furze, I can't believe you only got like 65 or whatever, you really have been tuning out while I've been talkin haven't you! - Thank you to all who came along to the gig on Wednesday night , your pressence was greatly appreciated. Sorry about having to sit through the evil tripple M-ness of Avenza , hopefully the Beings made it a little better. - Cheers to everybody involved for a tops night last night: Trenna, Greg, Leon, Marnie, Bridgie C, Crackers, MacGregor, Jono, Poodle , Bronnaz (tho brief), Alana and Anthony....... of course I was rock n roll wasted as per usual but in such fabulous company which made it even better................ and now I'm walkin on sunshine whoa!!!! and its time to feel good! whoo! ........... oh fuck yeah. Albums I'm surprised I want to buy: - new Eskimo Joe - new Youth Group Albums I damn well NEED to buy: - Cut Copy 'Bright Like Neon Love' - Eagles of Death Metal - the new Datsuns album... can't wait for that one

 ok, don't have much time in this starbucks (every starbucks in america now has wireless internet access it's awesome) so I'm going to put some free-form New York musings for y'all. New York is the best city on earth New York is not that bad - I don't know if it's a post 9-11 thing or what, but new york is not nearly as intense, rude, crime-ridden, or nasty as everyone says. People are generally polite, if brisk. The service is never too bad (hey do they want the tip?), the weather at the moment pleasant and the taxi's generally B.O free. And this isn't rose coloured glasses either, i've been looking for the worst and just not really finding it. New york is easy to get around, the subway is clean, cheap, safe and efficient. the cabs are unbelievably cheap, it's virtually impossible to run up a fare past $8 in manhattan. The bouncers at the clubs have been cool, the cops on the street jovial and the little dogs that ridiculously dressed women on 5th Avenue walk seem to yap not too much. Brooklyn is becoming safe and a little gentrified. The village is becoming a bohemian fashion capital. Oh my, the village (my future place of residence). Full to the brim of record stores that have savaged my credit card to the point where I may have to return home several months early. Full of obscure anonymous bars where bands of every genre occupy the floorspace of a phone booth and play nightly, full of colour, culture, history and attitude. I am moving here without a doubt, just find me a place in manhattan for less than $400 a week... Every single person on the island of manhattan own an Ipod. Period. New York has 130 people in it. The lonely planet will try and fool you into believing that 8 million people co-exist in this thriving metropolis but it's complete bullshit. I've made same amazing friends here who I've met in completely different circumstances in unrelated places and they all FRICKIN KNOW EACH OTHER! over and over again. This point was undelicately illistrated to me on monday night. Me and Benno attended the launch of a new Tommy fragrance (try if you will to imagine me and Benno on the red carpet with the photographers snapping like crazy, behind Maris Tomai and the cast of "queer eye"). I was kind of hooked up with Jesse Malin's keyboard player who was playing the party. Across the room I spotted an MTV presenter I had kind of hooked up with several nights previous in a bar on the other side of town and had been in contact with since (friend of Carlos' for the benifit of Ez) . Sure enough to my horror they have mutual friends and in about 4 seconds I'm in a pile of shit. Benno later ends up having conversation with MTV's ex-boyfriend in completely unrelated bar while going home that night with Ryan Adams ex-girlfriend (quote: "I've been where ryan's been..."). Jesse Malin was a really great guy by the way and went out of his way to get us into the gig. Sorry Ez, but Mr C is a complete animal. Half the women I've met are connected in that they were once with you-know-who, even one girl from London and another from Germany. 8 million people on this island and I meet random people who are all connected. I guess it's because everyone over the age of 24 on this island has some fabulous job, costume designer for Law and order, MTV presenter, (successful) musician, (successful) models, (successful) artists and, dare I say it, (successful) actors. No wannabe's like LA, just people doing their thing, and well. And you'll never get out of them what they do either. Big note-ing, networking, name dropping and bullshit are all things they do in that plastic fairy-tale known as L.A. In NY people are busy getting on with the business of doing it for real. And no one cares that you are from Australia. New Yorker's to a man loathe Bush, and I love them for it. So much more to say but I'm completely out of time. Off to Carlos' birthday party tonight. Open bar upstairs at Piano's, huge night ahead. Got a flight out of here at midnight tonight, got a feeling that I won't be going to sleep... Love to everyone, Erin hope your gig went well. everyone else hope you are well and having fun, especially you shayne, you sexy sexy man. ciao babies!

 Coming to the realisation that I may not be able to eat sweet food anymore thanks to mystery ache in tooth..devastating BARGAIN BUYER'S TIP: Also, discovered that Home Brand "Tim Tams" ($1.32) from Safeway are almost as good as regular Tim Tams ($2.68). After a packet, also realised my mouth was in agony due to sore tooth...

 Hi there... Hey Buntine, i know i probably shouldn't admit this on the blogg, but i'm kinda enjoying these test thingies you keep finding... send me more!! Anything to take my mind away from this hideous show... Oh yeah and i might just be lucky enough to have the opportunity to work with the one and only............ John Milson!!! on an opera... Miranda and Tiff are you gasping!?! I'm desperate... Well back to work... Love eveyone :)

 Now, I spend a lot of time and energy convincing myself and other people that my course (music industry [business]) is not a waste of time, and is not a rediculous thing to study and is not taught by jack black. But looking down at the 3 page assignment which took me 2 hours to write entitled: Obtaining Sponsorship PA971 Case Study: CHRISTINA AGUILERA AND SKETCHERS FOOTWEAR my entire theory is blown to shit.

 Yes its true i have been in blog hybo for weeks now. Been very busy..... i know i know just been jet setting up and down the coast (hard life but i am managing to keep afloat). But on a serious note it was one of the most amazing experiences of my life to see poodle and Bumtine walking down the street in Melbs. (fuckin hot suprise that was) CANT HANDLE IT WANT IT TO HAPPEN AGAIN. easter was fucked (everything closed......Melb was a ghost town) but i didnt care, i had my poodle and i was happy again. ..... so much has happened to me so i will have to do point form 1) nearly finshed at QTC ....fucking love Queensland, hidious i know.... 2) Have turned into an alcoholic, might be a "Bris thing - avrg 25 caprioscas a week 3) Cherry Orchard looking pretty hardcore 4) Went down to Sydney for weekend to see GRant .... totally hot, hate Sydney....spent more than i can afford on clothes, drugs, transport and alcohol.............oh yeah and i ate like a horse......

SOON YOU WILL BE MARRIED LOVE YOU ALL EVERYONE..... THIS TRIP HAS BEEN GOOD FOR ME BUT I MISS YOU ALL TERRIBLY LOVE LEON

 I'd also like to recommend Tiny Mix Tapes in the links. Tops blog. And I'd also like to ask the question, where the hell did all my valued bloggers get to? Please don't be scared off by all my testing, I promise, I've given up!

 Miyah. obligatory Logies Blog. I have a feeling I should make this in point form otherwise I'm gonna ramble. I have a feeling I'll ramble regardless. * Firstly, the entire production was HIDEOUSLY Channel 9. a) Obviously, Eddie being his usual annoying fuckwit self, but more on that later. b) The Nine Network had rigged the awards in such a way as to give the majority of the minor awards to their own programs in hope that we wouldn't notice as much, well that's my theory anyway. Cmon, who the hell actually watches Mc Leod's Daughters? c) The set was hideous. It was all washed with that horrible and unmistakable 'Channel 9 Blue'. It was cheap, tacky and embarrassing. I felt like I was watching the Brownlow. d) The Sound and Camera work was appalling, most of the live acts' mics only kicked in 1 minute into the song, as if they were doing a soundcheck as they went. * Guy and Shannon's performance reminded me of the P.A.F or some kind of Rock Estedford. * Yeah, the whole Delta (or Deltra, as Eddie would say, and did say, 3 times) Cancer thing. I can't believe they did it again. After being appalled at the on stage 'conversations' she was forced to have at the ARIAS, I cannot believe, Eddie went out of his way three times to mention it and ask her how she was going. The look on her face said nothing but "Yes, fuckwit I have cancer, I know it, You know it, everyone here knows it, let's get on with it" * Very impressed with the CNNNN win. Can't believe TV week buyers voted for them but fuckin good on em. * Elanor, just read your blog about Rove's acceptance speech. I think all he was saying, and I agree with, is that the Logies really are important to have in Australia. I mean Rove knows they're a pile of shit, and must be pretty boring sitting at that table just drinkin away, and that oddly, there suddenly seemed to be a lot of people reading TV week around the office at Channel Ten in the months prior. But really, what else do we have? Australian television is something that should be nurtured, congratulated and celebrated. Its part of everybody's lives, even if we watch it just to bag it! And with 90% of Australian Actors being unemployed, I think its something that should be encouraged. So yes the Logies are a sham. But we love it. We love seeing Home n Away sluts coked to the eyeballs and falling out of limos. We love violently throwing things at the television when Eddie McGuire comes on. We love cringing at Bert Newton. We love wisecracks about Larry Emder. We love perving on Dicko with his new hair and proclaiming how hot he is...... oh wait. Thats just me. But anyway. I guess I'm just saying I love any kind of awards. They're hilarious for a number of reasons, usually the wrong ones. And I'm tired of comparing them to American or British awards, because you just can't! They're cheap, they're tacky, they're try-hard, but I say embrace them in all their glory!

 Ok Iknow I've gone too far this time, but I have actually created a test about myself, and would be very interested to know how you all go Here's my first question: 1. What's my sign? * Aries * Aquarius * Capricorn * Pisces Just urlLink click here and you'll be taken to my quiz.

 WWWHHHHHATTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I can't believe my Inner Rock Star is Britney Spears!! That sucks ass! I'm taking it again! Lucky my Celebrity Soul Mate is Johnny Depp!

 oh man, I have 2 assignments to do before monday, but all I've done since I've sat at the computer is those damn tests!! I wish I never discovered that damn site! In the last 2 hours I've done: Career Personality Test Right Job, Wrong Job True Talent Test Ayurveda Body Type Test Discover Your Sexual Personality Gender Identity The Colour Test How bright is your Aura? Your Subconscious Self Finding Mr Right and the Sexual Turn On Test........ ok, this whole subconcious obsession with sex thing is beginning to freak me out, for the Sexual Turn On Test I got: you get equally turned on by physical appearance, personality, and environment People who are equally turned on by a person's physical appearance, their personality, and environmental factors appreciate a man in his entirety — how he looks, what he's like, and the circumstances the two of you share. Find out why you're physiologically wired to react this way in your personalized Sexual Turn On Report. It's ready right now! So basically, I'm turned on by everything under the freaking sun! THIS HAS GOT TO STOP!!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

 Ok, I'm not a freak talking in the third person, that was Miranda being a tool! and not going into her own account. end.

 Just so everyone knows, Erin is far from detoxification! There may have been a few nights of quiet contemplation (or rather ferocious coughing), where not a drop was touched...but that was all shot to hell when wednesday came around!! And i did not spew this week at Rockroom, quite proud of myself actually. Cant wait to see a bit of the old Perthski, and some old perthonalities very soon.... Please make a note that my sister Paula is havin me another partay on the 29th May, with more jelly shots, so get yourselves ready to rock and roll!! Not much happening at the mo.... getting very used to reverse parking lexii (multiple lexus), bmws, mercs, porche, jags...etc Cant wait for the bentleys and lambourginis!! For all who dont know, am working in valet carparking at the Arts Centre!! But apart from that, not a lot. Hi Furze in NY.......you big bastard! We missin ya back here xo

 Ra ha ha ha ahhahahaha! Check out the results of my urlLink INK-BLOT test: your subconscious mind is driven most by Sexuality What this means is that when your unconscious mind sees an opportunity to remind you of your sexual desires, it takes full advantage of it. Because of this, things that have very little sexual content or that seem sexually neutral to others, may register as sexually charged to you, at least on an unconscious level. Your unconscious mind recognizes the value of sexuality. The reason it may do so, is because of a deep-rooted fear of the opposite — living a life that is numb to sexual desire or is turned cold by it. You unconscious mind may be trying to avoid this sexual dullness, and so it reacts by swinging to the opposite extreme, strong sexual desire. By sending you these sexual messages on a regular basis, your unconscious makes sure you don't forget about sex. If you view your sexual desire with a positive attitude, you can welcome the vitality and strength sexual thoughts can bring into your life. This would allow you to honor the drive your unconscious has chosen to be an important focus for you. It is a message that you are very much alive, and have a great deal of passion to bring to life. Though your unconscious mind is driven most strongly by Sexuality, there is much more to who you are at your core. Yikes... that ink really knows its stuff

 The other night I did one of those Internet IQ tests that you only ever do at like 5am, when the thought of answering anything like What number should come after 161, 174, 134, 221 ..... and If Jack is shorter than Jane but Jane is Taller than Harry but Harry is fucking Jane... Seems like it might make your head implode.... so you avoid it... along with most of the five page test. So I have now been informed that my 5am IQ is 125, and I have no idea what that means. I have also been informed that I am an Insightful Linguist. (Just like Charles Dickens! aint that dandy?) 'This means you have the natural fluency of a writer and the visual talents of an artist. You also have a creative and expressive mind.' What a pile o' horse-shit, but so intriguing.... especially that ink-blot test....always wanted to do that

 Last night marked a very sad moment indeed, the end of ROCKROOM. Thats right, I rocked up to pick up my pay and guzzle some free alcohol while I was waiting, only to be informed by the gorgeous Stacey (bartender) that Rockroom shall be no more. With that news I made everybody in the room make a pact that they were gonna get drunker than ever before, and boy, did people keep their promise. Think I can safely say that everyone was completely ratshit, at one point I turned around and realised "wait a minute, this isn't Rockroom! this is Alana's apartment! I drove here! and now I'm dancing in her loungeroom with Adrian, Jonothan, Anthony and MacGregor, and poodle has vomited and passed out!' Ah classy classy classy. Gotta admit, I'm pretty sad, I was really growing to love my ROCKROOM family, I wish we didn't have to part/ have to PAY for drinks now..... I'll really just miss djing [my only source of income, and the greatest job in the world] oh well, i'll just have to find some other trashy bar to work in. FUCK YOU FURZE GOING TO THE MUSE AFTERPARTY IN NEW YORK! I HATE YOU!

 Dear god, matt bellamy split up his face playing in Philidelphia a few days ago and now Muse might have to blow out their show at the Bowery Ballroom in NY, leaving me completely deflated. Please get better matt because I've been building this gig up in my mind for over a month now, damnit. (that was just in case matt tunes into this blogg and needs a bit of inspiration to get off the canvas, everyone else just ignore that little tidbit...) AAAGGHHHHHHH!!!!! Anyway New York is wonderful and I can't really complain. Got another studio today but after that it's party time. Actually it was party time sunday night the day I arrived. Might have gone out a "little" hard in my excitement to be in this wonderful city. Hit the town with Carlos who was a wonderful and benevolent host (maybe too benevolent). Started at a soul/rock bar called 13th, progressed onto Black and white where the bass player for some band DJ's. left around 4am and stumbled back to my hotel. Erin so sorry for the phone calls, emails and sms. I'm afraid that I was a little trashy and really have no idea what I was on about. Actually a bit annoyed at myself for wasting a lot of yesterday in bed but, do the crime, do the time. Going to see the mel brookes broadway show tonight "the producers" tonight and an AIR gig after so fun times to be had fer sure. This city is magnetic, teeming, inspiring and I can't get enough of it. Just walking around soho and the village is enough to make me start seriously considering moving here (god I wish). Much more to tell but out of time. Hope everyone is well. Love you all

 since when are you detoxing erin? what the? yeah leon when are you coming home, it feels like you have been away for ages? Blog very nostalgic at the moment, looks like it is looking for some serious porch lovin. have just been to denmark, south of wa, not netherlands, for easter.....very nice, went with another couple to, unbeknown to us, a couples spa retreat thing, so most of the weekend was spent with the owners giving us cheeky smiles and thinking we were all swingers. but was a bit of a laugh, lots of oldies thinking we were very risque......giving us winks across the breakfast table. love to all -- hope the sun is shining on your pretty faces xox spanner

 Hi there!! Leon heard about your amazing entrance into Melbs!!! Would love to be over there with all you guys right now, really missing everyone... Leon when are you coming home? I want you to come over and watch Zoolander for 5mins then fall asleep on Shayne's bed... Looking forward to 'poodle and poodle' visits... Means living on the edge again... Lifes ok but pretty dull.

Erin I'm proud of your detoxing... Love all of you.

 shayne your freaking me out ha im great wat you guys doing tonight babe



 I am so excited about seeing lil Panda and Erin again....... Ehh I love you guys

 I turn 29 soon. This means that I am well and truly in my late twenties, and only one year away from my early thirties. Scary stuff. Worse still are all the warning signs looming in over me. Strange things that all point to impending thirties. The very fact that I have started to want to own "High Fidelity", which in spite of Jack Black coolness screams "30+ and male" is causing alarm bells to go off in my head and also preventing me from actually buying the DVD. Go figure... What does it all mean?

 Hello friends I was just reflecting on my life (it's pretty quiet at work tonight), and came to the conclusion that life is pretty good. BUT I'm not having enough fun... ...period. I long to get boozy with Erin and Poodle and dance like dickheads to eighties music whilst subtely sending up everyone around us, and pumping people we hardly know (or don't know). I long to fall asleep, half drunk and talking about physics and god with poodle and then get up late because no one knew how to set the alarm right. I wanna play video games with leon and marvel at how wierd and cool it is that i am actually playing video games with leon. I can barely remember what you guys smell like cursed nostalgia

 BEWARE PERTHONALITIES: I have booked my flight and shall be arriving in Perth on May 28 at 10:15 AM and shall be leaving on June 4 at 11:40 PM So get ready for a drunken whirlwind churning through your wonderful city, dropping in to say hello and then passing out on your couches!!! WHOO HOO!!!!

 i have almost officially had a coronary! Yesterday is was the most surprised EVER...casually strolling down brunswick street with erin...pestering her about when i was to receive the "present" she had informed me of an hour and a half earlier...when someone slams into me half way across a very busy intersection. Rudely shocked out of my three year old pleading and wailing..i've gone to be all "yo biatch watch where your fuckin' walkin hoe..." when i see Leon 3 cm from my face!! I then proceeded to scream, jump and hyperventilate...while still standing in the middle of the road. Erin kindly yelled "get the fuck off the road dickheads" so more screaming and general hysteria on the footpath! How AMAZING! Was so happy, and in awe of the fact that both Leon and Erin had managed to keep this from me! Couldn't have come at a better moment...esp. that it was easter and was feeling a little glum about being away from the fam and charming little perth! So in the words of my mum..."Leon is a legend...and so is Erin!" What a great surprise. Furze, saw you on the front of NW making out with David Hasselholf outside of the Viper room.... you dirty slut! We missin ya back here, but i'm lookin after poods, so all is good! Have a blast...glad the atm visits bring a smile! Shayne.. i love you and miss you like a mofo, cant wait to see you and talk a lot! Tiff.. you HAVE to save some of those hard earned pennies to come visit me and stay over mine and have bessions...i could maybe even organise some sunblest and olive oil as a treat for you! Erin...my thoughts exactly on the Von Bondies... but i was kinda expecting what we got... oh well, it turned out to be a great night...with all the ingredients of hilarity...me spilling beer on myself (a whole glass), toad in the hole, giggling fits in the cab, stupid dancing, and being poor!! A1 material! Love to all and to all perthonalities...cya real soon!

 Got 2 seconds left in a internet booth in dosn town santa monica so here goes... been in LA for five days now and I'm leaving on sunday for new york. My head has been constantly spinning in a kind of try-and-take-these-moments in dickhead-because-it's-not going-to-happen-again-soon kind of thing. I'm staying with a guy named named Allan Spearman at his LA bungalow from hell not far from Hollywood. He's an older sound engineer guy who's worked with bands like Sugar Ray and Cake and runs this awesome studio in sth pasadena. Been working with him on a couple of my songs and it's going really well. Went to Viper room a couple of nights ago and they had then most fantastic hair-metal tribute bands going on, like full spandex, teased perms, make-up, the lot. The crowd really came dressed to impress too. I'v never seen so many grown men wearing makeup and with big hair. It was a really funny night, epsecially after meeting "Bud" who's pretty mush devoted his entire life to honouring Motley Crue. For 2 hours I got a song-by-song, album-by-album breakdown of why they were and still are the greatest band to ever grace the stages of rock...Hilarious...AMAZING! Anyways gotta roll so here goes... Shayne - If you liked belle de jour make sure you latch onto "true porn clerk diaries" - one of the greatest online journals ever written. I think belle de jour links to it on her page. otherwise google...Also life is this amazing thing that rolls on and on and churns up people as it goes. it's too short and you are too much a good person to worry about anyone who's not along for the ride. Erin I'm missing you like you wouldn't believe. Everywhere I turn there's something going on and I'm thinking "Erin would love this". Start planning international trip 2005 girl (preceeded of course by gallery exhibition "2004 - 2000 and more"). Love you heaps Panda love you too. Missing poodle kisses like crazy. Still smile everytime I queue for an ATM... EVERBODY- please keep posting on da blogg. You are all so beautiful. so far my travel journal here's been kinda crappy, but in reality I've been working pretty hard. Promise to spice it up when the road trip happens. Ciao!

 been a while since i wrote to you all,... well now that i think about it, its probs my second or third time- very shame! Shayne was great bumping into you at waapa those few times yet we didn't keep our plans an meet for lunch, its a must! its crazy ...we HAVE to hold up the fort back in perth, while it seems the crew is all in melbs- LEon so lucky you are there!!!! will look forward to having you back in perth soon. I hope to be able to earn some money so i can go to melbsand stay at the new poodle pad- oh my ha plus catch up with friends of course!how exciting! well i miss you guyslike cRAzy! erin i feel your pain for missing adam at rove? wats with that. TAKEcare All spent the arvo watching movies - very random collection too... Royal Tenenbaums whale rider spirited away

 Miyah. So saw the Von Bondies last night, and frankly, was kinda disappointed. I mean, I'd heard rumours that their gigs hadn't been that great, but with the amount of hype they've recently recieved, like, outta nowhere, just in the past few weeks, was getting me really excited about seeing them. When I got there I realised that as always, this hype was generated purely to boost ticket sales, as it obviously wasn't sold out, and I had a spare ticket that I had high hopes of selling out the the front, and ended up not being able to GIVE it away. Don't get me wrong, they were pretty rockin and the performance of 'Rock n Roll Nurse' was one of the most rockin things I've ever seen but there was something lacking. There was no bonding with the audience, they just powered right thru for a measly 1 hour set. I think the only time anything was said was when they were encouraging us to clap along, asking if anyone had been in love, and then doing the oh too common line 'wow, you guys are awesome, you're living up to everythig we've heard about Melbourne, we heard you guys rock!!!! and there's so much talent in this city! blah blah blah......' that aint impressin me anymore, infact its giving me some kind of 'legendry music city' ego, so much so, that bands are really gonna have to put out to impress me. However, there's no way my ego could ever match that of the Von Bondies . I mean yeah its cool to have rockstar 'I'm so cool it hurts' attitude, but for a band who a have around 4 awesome 'party songs' and aint being terribly original the rest of the time, I really think they should lose the toode and stop taking themselves so seriously.



 hey guys 's been a long time between blogs i know. I have actually become addicted to Belle De Jour (THANKS FURZE!), so I have been catching up on 7 months of posts over there. Awsome blog. I miss you guys as always, that doesn't actually go away... ... but i got something on my mind. At first i was amused... You see, it all seemed ridiculous that someone we all thought was our friend would call up from another state and speak poorly of someone who is right at the hub of our fantastic Melbs/Perth collective, and is important to all of us. In fact it was so ridiculous that no one really even stopped to consider how rude and underhanded it was. It kinda just passed me by. Then someone crosses the nullabor and once here, makes a paltry effort to show up to a couple of shin-digs and does little but bitch and complain, and continue to slag off my friend. Again, I didn't really think about it. I was too busy enjoying my last booze up with a wonderful poodle person. I just didn't notice how bitter you were. Soon after I started to see you around again, sometimes daily. It was wierd because you were strangley detached and had this thing going were you would just blow people off (including me). You did this inspite of the fact that you had (apparently) enjoyed their friendship for quite a long time, and had even told them on occaision. Fine with me, I think i get it now. You've moved on. No hard feelings right. So it's been like that for a few months now, and i've noticed how no one really minds to much. No hard feeling right. And then out of the blue you get in touch cuz you want help to get some drugs....!!!??? No HOW ARE YOU?? or WHATS BEEN HAPPENING? Just a meezly SMS asking for a dealers number... Your loss noni... your loss

 I have decided that any pop-single sounding remotely unusual to start with will inevitably be successful eg's yeah-Usher etc Heya- outkast Milkshake-kelis new single from neptunes/nerd can't get you outta my head- kylie slow-kylie I had more when I was thinking about this on the way to uni... more later happy easter all

 Whoa. Mega Quiet Blog. So, anyways, finally bought the Franz Ferdinand album. i.e JB HiFi only just got it in stock. It seems such a shame that they've become the latest NME hype band, cause they're so damn cool and as soon as the NME jumps on something it seems to make people wanna chew them up and spit them out almost as quickly as the magazine itself does. Although, its not like they don't deserve the hype, they are fuckin cool and 'Take Me Out' is possibly the best song to drunkenly dance to at 4am ever! But sometimes I just get this sickly feeling when I suspect that certain bands were actually 'created' by the NME by doing things like puting the demo of Franz's 'Tell Her Tonight' on their 'Hangin With the Strokes' compilation in mid 2003..... and proceeded to get me all hooked on it...... wait a minute, i don't know if any of this is making sense coz I'm trying to listen to the album on headphones at the same time. Anyways Dick Smith Power House Rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! All singles $2, Vinyls $8-20 and you can order them in!!!!!!!!! and average album price $18, looks like I'm never going to JB again.

 I've never felt like so much horseshit in my life, apart from maybe, last weekend. But yknow, had to get wasted, last night being Amy's housewarming and Furze's going away drinks and all. However, let it be said: I AM DETOXING FROM ALL DRUG-USE FOR AT LEAST 2 WEEKS (except cigarettes). Now that it has been said, I'm relying on all of you to hold me to that. I fucking have to, my brain is so fried, my hands are shaky, I've only just peeled myself off the couch to type this and you can probably hear me coughing from Perth. To make things worse, my little Furzikins is leaving me for NYC,..... come to think of it, who wouldn't? Needless to say I shall be heartbroken, and won't know what to do with myself, and considering I'm detoxing........no furze, no alcohol, no drugs..... WHAT THE HELL AM I GOING TO DO AT NIGHT? I'm gonna be staring at a wall counting down the hours. Oh god, its hell! HELL! But I'm really only cursing so much because I'm insanely jealous. Andrew, You will have an amazing time, and you have to find the most random place you can to blog from! Safe and happy travels. Now, back to what I was doing: oh yeah, mope.

 Shayne from this angle that looks like an entire blog devoted solely to your love for WAAPA.... wooo that is some wierd shit. in other news it apperas the weekend has just sprung itself on me once again, yippee. am thinking i may just have nice quiet one with good food and a few beers........ hope all melbourne folk are taking this nanna hannah opportunity to appreciate the overwhemilng amount of flora in you town at the moment with the flower show giving all victorian grannies entertainment this weekend. sorry i have boycotted it this year but will be back to visit soon. furze are you leaving soon/ left?.... safe travels buddy.

 Well FUCK!!! I never thought that I would give so much of a fuck about theatre, much less a WAAPA show. But then I guess life has been full of surprises ever since I stopped using drugs. I just finished working with Adam Cook. Apparently he is the hottest ticket in Australian Theatre at the moment. A BIG SHOW. A real mind fuck at times. So yeah... My point is I actually really loved it. Life is really wierd...

 is that bad? no of course it isnt bad? it is funny to laugh at people when you know something they don't - particularly when is about stuff you know they want to know....hehehe vicious laugh inserted here. am now feeling very elite having seen the only crows concert this time round in oz. that is it for news, week seems to have choofed past quite quickly, yippee.

 Spotted 2 fresh-faced (hence annoying) first years discussing the coolness of Counting Crows, only for one of them to wish the other well at the concert (which was meant to be that evening). I laughed, in that evil way that makes you look like the private joke you are having with yourself is psychotic, b/c I knew, thanks to furze, the concert had been cancelled... is that bad?

 Erin...Shayne hugs are still so mintox, you are seriously gonna do it for 20 mins...but pashing piche? those days are gone girlfriend. Be prepared for a "new generation" at the Scottsman, although i do believe with your insane powers of persuasion you will be able to haul all the old crew from far around back to their roots on wednesday! Better get those panics tix asap...Perth seriously is about 30 years behind...Panics cost $5 and the shops are still shut sunday, being a 'family' day and all!!! But thats why i love it. I am now fully booked until i leave perth. I have lunches, dinners, arvo beers, movies, bbqs (oh bbq i love u...and i dont even eat meat), cocktails, bessions, theatre, amplifier bar....AMAZING!! And still the sun shines, only been one cold day! Think i will die on return to the icelands of melbourne...

 Ahoy-hoy. Yay! Miranda informed me last night that I will get to see the Panics in Perth after all, at the old haunt: The Velvet Lounge , and to sweeten the deal, its only $5!!!!!!!!!!!!! yippeee. In other news, ummmmmmmmmm.......... wait, I don't have any news. OH YEAH! I'm djing @ Revolver this evening for Indie Initiative , so come along y'all for cool 'straight-edge metal' times (thanks Graham). I hope my head feels a little better by then coz I'm kinda in a weird space since last night, MacG, I dunno what you gave me but I feel weird. But hey, it made class a little easier and more entertaining today! (ps - I told people about the whole smoking banana skins thing, and they said it doesn't really work, then somebody else said to try smokin dried up vegemite, seems to do the trick) ahhhhhhhhh the things we do for cheap thrills. And so yes, that is today's news. I'm Audi 5000.

 urlLink And by the way Laurie, I'm not obsessed with any guys! I don't know what you're talking about! ..... drool.......&nbsp; urlLink

 Doop di doo. Hmm it is rather unfortunate that during the week I am going to Perth, all the good Perth bands are touring Melbourne. That'd be bloody right. Was quite looking forward to Eskimo Joe, the Panics and End Of Fashion (always knew those guys would take off). But.... blah what are ya gonna do? In other news, I scored Top Of The Class again today with my third High distinction ... 'because I'm such a girly swat' I seem to be unknowingly setting a high standard for myself. I mean, this is ridiculous, this mark was for the Study of Christina Aguilera and Sketchers that I mentioned! I mean cmon! It took me 2 hours including research! Its not that hard people! Either I've finally found an industry that I excel in, or the rest of my class is completely fuckin stoopid, I think the latter is more likely. (jokes! To anybody from class reading this!) In more news (the lazy way): - the Vines suck ass. And the singer is a complete child. - I was gonna see them tonight to make fun of them but now I shall be hitting revolver to see Aaron rock out as his band is playing there, and I've been promised some serious scissor kicks and stage dives. - Speaking of scissors, the more I hear from the Scissor Sisters the more they totally rule. - Ouch! Just realised I haven't bought any albums since Franz Ferdinand ! And that was ages ago! FUCKIN DAMN BEING POOR! ITS SO FUCKING SHIT! - And I am soooooooooooooooooooo excited to go to Perth on Friday to cop a huge hug from Shayne, get wasted at the Scotsman, drink beer with Bec, cop a dirty pash from Piche, and check out Leons's swingin pad'. YEEEAH! GET DOWN ON DA WESTSIeeeeeeeeDE!

 He he he, just rediscovered the joys of the 'recorder'. For some unknown reason, my Recorder from Grade 3 was randomly sitting next to me, so decided to give it whirl. Man O Man, I dunno how the hell teachers put up with this crap, I'M ANNOYING MYSELF HERE! Let alone multiplying this ear drum bursting squeal by 30! I've now resorted to sticking it up my nose like Ralph Wiggum and just breathing normally. Pretty soon my mum's gonna come in and ask what hell keeps making this noise: "whhhoooo......whhhoooo......whhhhooo........whhhoooo" hehehehehehehe sometimes I amuse myself so much that its scary.

 I was just thinking about how i hardly ever really blog these days... ... and thought I better blog about it.

 aaaahhhhh Perth. I thought the homeland had forsaken me on the day i arrived...it was cold, windy and raining. But this big wad of a state has come through for me and busted out some warm rays. Oh sunshine, how i've missed thee. I can truly say that the weather has a profound effect on my mentality. It could be the fact that im seeing all my greatest pals, my loving fam, and am not working in the fume factory (pet name for the arts centre carpark), but waking up to rays of warm light through my window, after sleeping on a proper bed, and the first thing i see is my little meow meow snuggled up and purring...is the greatest thing in my world! I've also seen some great critters in the 3 days i've been here...dolphins, quokkas, bob tail goannas and seagulls. The seagull is not usually something i would usually class as a "great critter", but after the episode on rottnest island, i have to say that i think they're ace! Shayne..i know your currently pissing your pants if ur reading this! Shayne, myself and tiffany decided to take the little runabout boat for a chug around the bay on sunday after trennas wedding. We all piled in with a box of bbq shapes for the ride and proceeded to leisurely boat about on the open sea. I think it was Tiff who thought she would throw a shape to a one legged seagull flying parallel to us(where do all those legs go by the way, and how come so many freakin seagulls have lost one leg in the first place?)sorry about that...i will now continue with the story... But as you can imagine, in true seagull style (you throw a tiny morsel of food and they start flying from antartica), we suddenly had a swarm of sky vermin flying behind us! This caused Tiffany to have about seven coronarys in succession. So Shayne sped up, and to the average boater or person strolling on the shore, we would have looked like three screaming twits flying across the bay dodging boats and bouys (those floating bobble things), with a plague of seagulls chasing us trying to steal our shapes. The fact that the boat only did about 6 km, tiff was screaming like someone had just chopped off her nipple, and the army of seagulls were flying 5cm from our heads all added to the hilarity of the situation. As all those who know me could imagine, i was about to combust! Laughing with such force that i thought all my organs were going to come out of my mouth at once! This is not so great when you are trying desperately not to fall overboard. And it wasnt a short episode....this went on for a good 7 minutes or so till we had driven the entire length of the bay to nearly the edge of the island! Something i will never forget. And this is an example of why i love Perth....cos this random shit could only happen here in this random gigantic state! Hope all is well in melbs, and poodle u are not going crazy just yet. Cant wait for u to get ur ass to the west side...i'm starting to realise that u are actually my "other half", as some people like to say. Everyone over here is coupled up, and i just thought...well my partner is getting here on friday, so nnnnneeeerrrr! Well, i think i have satisfactorly bored you all enough now...so take care me heartys Hooroo

 As if I'm not already pissed off enough with people being overseas for summer, today i read this: The Curiosa Festival 2004 will feature the Cure headlining a bill that also includes three bands plainly influenced by Robert Smith and company: Interpol, the Rapture and Mogwai. A second stage will also be part of the traveling road show, with Muse, Thursday, Cursive, Melissa Auf Der Maur, Cooper Temple Clause and Head Automatica rotating as performers. gggggrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

 Hey all, thought I would break up erin's obsession with 'the guy' with some nostalgia I was thinking about my internet-laurie-hoochy days and just remebered www.picturepoll.com, fucking hilarious, except the link no longer works on my computer...sob, however, there is a newby, www.hotornot.com...some people are so desperate. that is all

 urlLink some of that 'hot slow sex' i was talkin about (the music that is..) ....(ok, I promise I'll stop posting photos now, its just so much damn fun tho!).............&nbsp; urlLink

 urlLink The Beings.... for anybody needing a visual....(photo by Spencer Smith used without permission but I'm sure he aint gonna kill me!) ....&nbsp; urlLink

 urlLink YAY! How exciting to finally have pics on the Blog WHOO HOO!!!! ......&nbsp; urlLink

 urlLink ehhh Elbow, how I love you. And Furze! this is my dream guitar! what is it?&nbsp; urlLink

 Abandoned Its official. I have been ditched by a large majority of my small group of friends. Furze MIA O.S somewhere, Poodle in Perth and now Kate leaving for the UK today, with Prue soon to leave. Goddammit. I'm gonna be so bored! I do realise that I'm going to Perth next Friday, but it just seems like this week is gonna last forever. Considering I can't afford to get to school its gonna last even longer as I'll be on the couch for the most part. Sick of being broke. (yes, I can hear you all saying "get a fucking job erin!") But I can't handle it! I can't handle doing any more shit kicking jobs when I should be doing something fabulous by now! I should be doing some kind of fantastic music/arts related job, and generally getting paid for being fabulous! WHY AM I NOT A ROCKSTAR!???!! Hello!? If anybody needs to be a rockstar its me! God damn me not having any musical talent!!!! Maybe I'll just become like the 'CLUB KIDS' of NYC early 90s and just be famous for the sake of being famous and wear cool outfits, go on talk shows and take lots of drugs, and then get wound up in some kind of dodgy murder scene... hmm maybe not.

 Whoa. According to that profile thing on the right, I've blogged 38,000 words since March 2003. How much time have I wasted?

 Just for the record, I DID actually write that Beings review BEFORE last night. Just to clear up any suspicions of clouded judgement! Meanwhile check out their rad review by urlLink Neil Wedd

 Thanks for the advice kiddies, think I'm all set now. Craig's hooked me up with the inside info. (thanks Crackers!) Elanor, your comment was hilarious! But I just couldn't do that. Name dropping is very frowned upon in our class. I learnt that through observation. Plus, half the girls in there are band-aids anyway (finally! I belong!)I don't think I'd be teaching them anything new! Deary deary me. Hmm whats been happening? Indie Initiative was on Thursday night so I toddled off to that and was bloody awesome. Bands: Waitress - Pretty fuckin shit. Thank god they were on first when nobody was there. The (supposedly) female singer was dressed in some kind of "I work for an accountant" outfit. We had sneaking suspicions that she was really a boring secretary by day and nobody in her workplace knows that she's a singer in a band by night. The Kissingers (formally known as JetSet)- Hilarious. At first I was like "What the fuck is this?" The singer was about a metre high and he was jumping and dancing around like some kind of Vegas Lounge singer (the silky shirt wasn't helping) but after a while I was like "yeah! I can dig this, these guys are awesome and funny, and I hope they're not taking themselves seriously" They'd be a great support for Franz Ferdinand The Beings - Sigh. The best gig I have ever seen them play, it was just fuckin beautiful. To quote Alana "It was like when you haven't had sex for a long time and you finally realise what you were missing". I think that pretty much captured the performance. The whole set was like fuckin hot slow sex. Amazing. Goddammit! If they don't get famous soon I'm gonna kill somebody! Are you listening Labels! THE BEINGS ! goddammit! Fuckin do your job properly! jesus.

 why don't you do an expose on celebrities in the music industry. You must hear alot from craig?! Pass it on, everyone will be thankful

 Advice? So, I have to do a 10 minute 'Presentation' on 'anything related to music'. Considering, this is a fairly broad subject I'm asking for suggestions. So far people have been getting up and talking about their favourite albums and shuffling a few blank pieces of paper to make it look like they've written notes. I'd like to be a bit more 'organised' and 'professinal' than this. And please do not suggest anything to do with downloading, the internet, and how this effects the industry, coz I'm bloody sick of it. I need something edgy, cool, relevent and interesting to everybody. AND I'M SERIOUS PEOPLE! I NEED SUGGESTIONS! Also, it has come to my attention that you cannot use this new commenting system unless you have a blogger account, which completely sucks ass and makes for why there's so little commenting going on. However, in the meantime if you do have a suggestion PLEASE EMAIL ME! Meanwhile! PERTH! HELLO? WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU ALL? AND WHY AINT YOU BLOGGIN?

 N.E.R.D Ya, so last night I went to N.E.R.D (aka the Neptunes , aka writers of almost 50% of high rotation songs played on U.S radio (Justin, Britney, Kelis etc) )at the Forum. Hot Diggity Dog, its was the best live show I've seen a long long time. This might be due to the fact that I don't see many gigs outside of the 'rock' genre too often, and I'd forgotten how great hip hop shows are. Although you can't technically put N.E.R.D in the 'hip hop' box, or any box for that matter, but its the same energy that they bring to a show, the kinda vibe that makes everybody go insane. Plus the show sold out pretty quickly which always makes the performance more special because everybody there was a realy big fan. And I mean REALLY big. The audience were amazing, they knew every song, every word, every beat and they never ever got tired. At one stage Pharrel had THE ENTIRE FORUM, every single person in the maxed out room; jumping up and down with their hands in the air. It was quite awesome. Also a big highlight was when he goes, "Right, now, I want y'all to put up yo' cell-phones! Light up yo' celly in da air yknow what i'm sayin? yeeeeah'" It looked so cool, it seems mobiles are the new lighters in the air. The only bad thing was Pharrel's over-protective body-guard who followed him to whatever side of the stage he was on, like um 'hello? aint no fool gonna stab you in Melbourne yknow what i'm sayin daawwggg?' But a tops show. five stars. *****

 Guaranteed Cheer-Up Whenever I feel like I'm just moping around the house and nothing seems vaguely exciting or even generally interesting and I need a bit of pep in my step, there's one thing that is guaranteed to make me laugh: The 2001 Michael Jackson Tribute Concert Yep, I just bust that baby into the VCR, and set myself up for some serious laughs. I highly recommend it for anyone who's feeling a bit down in the dumps, here's a few scenes that'll have ya chuckling: - Shaggy's ridiculous power thrusting during his now forgotten hit 'It Wasn't Me' - 98 degrees trying desperately to pull off the intro to Man in the Mirror, (with Nick Lachay looking stupidly tanned, buffed and good looking compared to those other 3 dweebes) Then to be taken over by Mivas (male divas) Luther Vandross and Usher "Don't just talk about it! Be about it! whooooaaaaaaoooooooo ahhh ooooooh!" and then once you've been warmed up with those lil acts, its time for the big guns, bring out the CHAMPAGNE COMEDY! The moment where your laughter turns into a cackle: LIZA MINELLI oh man. Liza, oh Liza....... you're so unbelievably bad, I almost don't know what to do with myself, but laugh laugh laugh. The chest clutching, the stupid trademark chuckle in the middle of a dramatic pause, the SHOWING SOME LEG WHEN YOU JUST DAMN WELL SHOULDN'T! and then mistaking the crowds applause for love when they really just want you off the stage! and then! blowing the audience kisses until SOMEBODY DRAGS YOU OFF AND THEY CUT TO AN AD! AGGGHH HA HA HA HAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA AGHHHHH HA HA HAHAHAHAHAHA! ok maybe I'm the only one who's as amused as this, but I doubt it. Watch it people!

 Eurovision Ah, television's night of nights is over. Yes I did my homework and watched Eurovision like a good little girl, and boy was it worth it. Man I laughed so hard that my entire body hurt, and here's a couple of reasons why: - first up, Spain's entry where the singer is holding an acoustic guitar to play 2 chords at the beginning then have the guitar whisked away by a random dancer - Norway's entry which sounded like John Farnham - France's entry with a random Grace Jones lookalike on stilts flapping her arms around insanely in the middle of a ballad and making the singer look like a dwarf Robert Mills - Greece gets special points because they were the only entry to capture 2 essential Eurovision ingredients: a white suit AND a 'reveal' - Malta's entry 'On Again Off Again' possibly one of the funniest fucking songs I have ever heard. It was like all the songs from 8 different musicals rolled into one, it was just insane. - And, my favourite entry: Bosnia. With the ultra camp 'Deen' singing 'In the Disco' singalong in standard European accent: 'I'm running Late, I'm losing my weight, kiss me, turn me slow, up and down here we go.... music's what I want, music's what I need... in the disco' - And the ugly as shit female host with the most hideous dress I have ever seen, constantly saying: 'And! In the top five places with the smiling faces! Are!' oh lord it was so funny... for anyone who missed out, download Malta and Bosnia's entry now!

 On sat night, I was once again reminded how thankful I am for having the friends I do when confronted with the most infuriating female of all time: Let's call her Pulie the dental nurse, and her much older dentist boyfriend, let's call him Pan. Anyways, I arrive at restaurant after everyone has eaten, and Pulie and Pan are complaining about the service as their main topic of conversation (faux pas number one as an ex-pat of the hospitality industry). Then Pulie starts to tell everyone about how Pan drives a porsche and it has 300 horsepower. And how her and Pan are going to drive cars at Sandown with 600 horsepower, and how Pan's friend, the ORAL SURGEON (ooh, like they are soo good) has an even better car...and how Pan also has an mg... blah blah blah WHO GIVES A TOSS???!!! WHAT DOES THIS MATTER TO ANYONE??!! then the conversation moves back to bad service, and general obnoxious comments. grrrr anywhoo, I found it annoying later

 yay for urlLink Perth Rock City answering my prayers with a whole animation dedicated to Kenny Kidna !!! You guys certainly do rock

 current music: the inevitable 'I Wanna Dance With Somebody'. I dunno if anybody else experiences this, but I have a default song that resurfaces in my head when I have nothing else to sing or hum along to. For some reason that song is Whitney's 'I Wanna Dance With Somebody' was it Whitney? I think it was. Anyways, its been in my head for the past 3 years or so and its not going anywhere fast. Its just so great for belting out random diva wailing and bad eighties dance moves as I jive down the hallway and do the ol' 'socks-slide' into the kitchen, maintaining just enough balance to finish with some retarded kick and a 'whoo!'... or the part where it goes 'don't ya wanna dance say ya wanna dance don't ya wanna dance - DANCE!' whilst doing the 'running man'. OOOHHH YEAH. man, the fun of socks on lino never ends.

 Man my discman rocks!! I just dropped it down the wooden stairs while listening to it and it didn't skip once! amazing! thanks bec. Meanwhile KISS is tonight and tomorrow... I really wanna go dammit!!!!! I wanna rock n roll all night and party ev-er-y day! If anyone finds any tickets lying in a gutter somewhere give em to me ok?

 Ezla I can speak with great authority about music being ruined by an understanding of either how it is made or the biz behind it. Once I started getting heavily into music production I couldn't listen to anything and just enjoy it anymore. Instead of just appreciating the overall song I had to mentally rip it apart piece by piece. Instead of being swept away by some great melody and lyrics I'd sit there wondering what guitar amp they were using and what EQ settings they had on the kick drum - painful! Then maybe I'd heard on the grapevine that the album I was listening to cost too much or had to be remixed or some useless shit and I'd be obessing over that. Then worst of all I'd start listening to bad songs because "the production was great" (like avril lavigne - amazing production, annoying artist). Then I'd do this whole ridiculous "Can't see the forrest for the tree's" thing where I'd listen less to an artist because they had no obvious marketable value and I knew that it would ultimately fail, even though it was really good music - stupid. For about 2 years I don't think I really appreciated any new acts for my own pure love of them as against my perception of their worth within the industry. uuugghhhh! And then one day about 12 months ago I found a subliminal switch that turned all of that off and I found myself loving acts just for the fricking hell of it and ignoring the industry babble. I'm still partial to ripping apart people's records and analysing production values, but I've also started jumping up and down on my bed again, and playing air guitar - both very good signs that you've forgotten about an act's marketing potential. I think you just learn to trust your own instincts about music and worry about the rest later. That said, I'm so glad that you're throwing yourself into your course. It's a real tough industry, but you remain the toughest person I've ever met, so I've got high hopes. A future in A&R awaits...

 Meanwhile ... for good times and a bit of 'fond smile' link to the AUGUST 2003 archive, its one of my favourite months on file, ah life seems so much better and rosy when you read back over it 9 months later... also meanwhile ... Interpol's 'Hands Away', is possibly the most beautiful song/thing I have ever heard.

 current music: Interpol 'turn on the bright lights' its been a while ok! I fear something horrible is happening.......... I may be losing my love of music. ...Along with my sex drive, my lou reed tshirt, and my mind. CURSE THIS MEDICATION! Anyways, I don't think I'm actually LOSING my love for music but more that I look at it in such a different way now. Obviously I should have known this would happen undertaking a music BUSINESS course and all. I never thought I would become so business minded! Even the people in my class still OBSESS over new bands and stuff, but now, when I hear a new band or a new song, my immediate reaction is: What do they look like? How can I market this? What should the video treatment be? Regional tour, national tour, sponsorship, stylists, management, contracts, promoters, booking agents, producers, labels blah blah blah blah blah BLAH BLAH BLAH! Its horrible! I've lost all my music listening innocence! I guess its not that bad, I actually quite enjoy it. Lucky I'm not a musician then it would be ten times worse! PS - Laurie! You're still alive! Where you been all my life?

 Tips for the wise: Do not see Starsky and Hutch!! waste of time and brings nothing new... Ben Stiller is losing it, Along Came Polly was a train wreck.. Also, Erin, you spell it CYPRUS, and btw, those points could have easily gone to Turkey... (Cyprus: half Turkish, half Greek)

 HAPPY BIRTHDAY MACGREGOR! YOU SEXY BEAST!

 My Homework Man I really do love my course sometimes. Our teacher Dobe (cool old rocker type) says to us today: "Right, I can guarentee yur response to this, but I'm going to get you to do some fucking homework for once!" (class groans) "But you'll be thanking me, because its kind of 'fun' homework. Sunday night holds the Music highlight of the year. Eurovision. Your task is to watch it, enthusiastically, possibly whilst drinking a few beers so you get over excited, and vote for each act. We shall then compare our scores on Tuesday and determine our own hideous fucking Eurovision winner. Won't that be fun!?" (class cheers) Ah, excellent, my favurite television night of the year and I get to watch it for 'homework' But I'm slightly disappointed that they've stretched it out into half hour slots every day, then a Preliminary final on Friday night then the big one on Sunday. Gone are the days of staying up all night for 7 hours listening to: Host : "Cypres, your results please?" Cypres : "Oh hello! we would like to say you are doing a wonderful job.. Host : (cutting her off) "Yes, Cypres your results please!" Cypres: "oh yes, 12 points to Greece!" surprise surprise

 hehehehehehehe Vanessa Amorossi is back where she belongs ... well at least nt making recrds, but urlLink ERRECTING FENCES !! hilarious

 hehehehehehehe Vanessa Amorossi is back where she belongs ... well at least nt making recrds, but urlLink ERRECTING FENCES !! hilarious

 Yay! Blogger finally has a new look and new easy templates, thus I have changed the entire template, seeing as i fucked around with the old one so much that it didn't resemble anything of its former self. On the downside I lost all the links so I'm slowly rebuilding.

 new blog lay out, very cool although not sure if this is ever going to get published cause new fonts and stuff freak me out.... but think i got it right so far. just dropped in for a jiffy cause i got to go out, in my news the last week has revolved around mother's day - not for my own she was away, but for financial prosperity - people have gone nuts for flowers on this ridiculous day, particularly boys such a token easy gesture, ah i'm not complaining. and yay winter finally hit perth, woke up to a storm yesterday... yum yum bubblegum - doona so good. think at this point i may be dribbling so ill hit the road toad. hope all well got the email about your party miranda, cheers big ears, will be there but see you first at the wedding in 2 weeks!!!!!

 Ok, once again I've been proven wrong. well.... not wrong exactly...... When I saw Street Kid Vandal a few months ago they were a little too big for their boots. They had the look but not the sound to back it up. However when I saw them on Thursday night, they fuckin rocked! Rocked in a way I haven't seen for a long long long long time. The improvement was almost unbelievable. I don't know what happened, possibly new management, possibly just workin real hard, or possibly just had a real bad gig that night. All I know is they actually ARE what Jet has been hyped to be (but still haven't delivered). They know how to write a bloody good rock tune and can belt them out even more convincingly and louder than the Datsuns . Plus they're all pretty fuckin hot. Nothin like a band fulla 3 dirty rock boys and one smoking hot pseudo goth chick bass player. No doubt about it, urlLink Street Kid Vandal are my hit prediction of the year. If only I actually did do A&R instead of just pretending that I do. Ah one day. One day.

 trying to score some franz ferdinand tickets tonight at the hammersmith odeon. wish me luck??!! Just landed in london. It's cold, overcast, gloomy and I couldn't be happier to be here. Staying with my good friend andrew Blain, who, as fortune had it, had a room for me to rent for the next three weeks in his all-aussie sharehouse (God there are so many aussies here, it's riduculous). Mr Stephen "Deluxe" Tucker is also here so much good times to be had. Even ran into a guy from school on the tube in from the airport. One thing this trip is teaching me is that the world is an incredible shrinking place. Missing melbourne and all you guys lately. missed you ms buntine most of all during the cure's set at coachella, mostly because I'd never heard half the songs before and kept thinking that you would have appreciated it so much more than me! Plus I'd just read your cure dissection on da blog and was feeling a little emotional. I'm so jetlagged right now I'm not sure if i can keep my eyes open. too many 14 hr flights methinks. Going to be good to just stay in a one city now for a few weeks and really sort of soak it up. Travelling at breakneck speed through the US meant I haven't really digested a lot of what's been going on. Can't say it enough but I am missing all you guys like crazy. Hope you are all really well and happy. My old email address is working again so email if your bored with melb stories: afurze@bigpond.net.au listening to: Kasey Chambers doing Ben Harper's "Lonely Day" Reading: Tourist maps in the middle of the street and looking like a dickhead tourist doing it...hang on... I AM a dick head tourist. Loving: Seeing old and very dear friends, getting lost in london in the rain (really, i love this) and Wireless internet in trendy cafe's. Hating: My inability to stay up to date with emails, my inability to adequetly document everything I do for posterity, my inability to find the perfect rock suit damnit cheerio

 current music: Dallas Crane Like to give my eternal props to Sharon Osborne. Just watched her talk show and it freakin rocks. Its so like..... Unpretentious. She walks out to her adoring live audience on the set made to look like her house (complete with dogs) and says " Ok, right, what we're talking about today is something that everybody does but for some stupid reason doesn't admit: plastic surgery. I have no hesitation in telling you I've had a leg lift, tummy tuck, arm lipo, bum lift, boob lift, neck lipo, face lift, eye lift and a nose job (to name a few). And I still feel crap about myself but most of that was for medical reasons. Here's a great friend of mine who also won't hide what she's had done, Kathy Griffen ." Yikes. after, seeing those before photos, thank god Kathy did get some stuff done. But what I really enjoyed is just how honest the entire show was. eg - Sharon and Kathy blatantly bitching about how immature and stupid Ryan Seacrest is, Calling for make-up touchups in the middle of the Little Richard interview, throwing silicone implants into the audience and just having fun. Special highlight: at the end when Sharon is reading off the teleprompter and stuffs it up, then goes 'God! You know I hate reading off these bloody things!, see ya next time" PS- somebody keep me away from Sticky , if I make any more badges I'll be swimming in them! For good times, come to Revolver tonight, I shall be there a little later on, gettin drunk and rockin out.

 Quote of the Day: At the start of Ryan Adams' 'Heartbreaker' album there's an amusing little argument regarding which album Morrissey's 'suedehead' is on, the most amusing part of is when they're about to start a song : Ryan: '1!.. 2! ... uh... uh oh....(music stops, says in bad english accent) he's go' a mouff fulla cookies!' Other Dude: 'We'll be bashed by facists and left for dead!' Ryan (high pitched) 'Left for dead!!!!!!' oh man.... so random. If anyone can explain what this mouth full of cookies thing is please, actually no, don't its actually funnier not knowing what the fuck they are talkin about. Current Music : Obviously Ryan Adams, but I've discovered that 'Shakedown On 9th Street' is the most rockin song I've ever heard, you gotta love a track about a rumble between straits and greasers.

 I'd like to say, that I am thoroughly enjoying listening to urlLink Triple J these days. I might go so far as to say its a god damn fuckin delight especially during the day. Simply because I already know when I turn it on, that I'm gonna get gold: Adam and Will until 9 in the morning, on the way to school: comedy gold. Makes the trip through peak hour Camberwell so much more tolerable, plus I always call up to speak to Adam Spencer, coz he's the greatest. Mel in the Morning from 9 : possibly a little more subdued than I would like, because by this time I'm late for school an need something a little more upbeat, but still, there's always some nice, 'relax into work mode' tunes on at this hour Miff: My favourite JJJ DJ, she plays such fuckin great music (although its possibly not her who's playing it) I just know that every song that comes on is gonna be great, always try to leave tafe early to hear some of her show (even tho she's on holidays at the mo, I'm eagerly awaiting her return) Today Today with Chris and Craig after 3 : Boy oh boy, this is a fuckin funny show from the genius behind CNNNN , even though I have the suspicion they have no idea what music they're playing its still fuckin hilarious for the drive home. Ok, if the ABC/JJJ don't give me a job now after that little plug then I will take it all back! Seriously though, I never thought I would say this, but Kingsmill , you've done a great job.

 can I just point out that there some FUCKIN HILARIOUS annimations over at urlLink Perth Rock City . You gots to check em out.

 roving reporter update - What this blogg really needs now is some independant analysis of international rock festivals, so as a service to you all I'll be at Coachella this weekend soaking it in for your later blogging benefit. We have a tent bought at Walmart, an Avis convertible and a whole lotta dreams. Actually we are so underprepared for this it's not funny, but the important thing is we are here. Erin wish you were here right now, seeing as I didn't even know about this festival until you posted about it on da blog so many months ago, didn't dream back then that I'd actually make it. Love the cure dissection and the album reviews by the way. The list that shaped my life is not nearly as cool but here goes anyway (this is not my favourite albums of all time, merely the ones that had the biggest affect on me over the years)... John Farnham - Age of Reason I listened to this cassette so incessantly as a kid that it wore out and mum had to buy me another one. Played it all day, every day on one 5 day car trip top perth, nearly inspiring parental infaticide. Musically doesn't have much to do with me anymore but definetly inspired me to want to perform. Hi-light: johnny's ode to human imperfection "we're no angels" Faith No More - The Real Thing Got this album a couple of years later in Grade 6 (on cassette again). One tragic listen and suddenly poor johhny wasn't speaking to me quite the same. Hi-light: "Mid-life crisis", mike patton inspiring in me a hard rock crush that took a decade to die. You Am I - Hi Fi Way The album that tought me how to play guitar. Easily one of the best Australian albums of the 90's. Hi-light: "applecross wing commander" with an ending that makes me want to smash something, or dance, or run naked through bourke st mall, or maybe just form a band and play gigs. Smashing Pumpkins - Siamese Dream When this album came out it seemed almost too cool for me to own. I have personally bought 6 copies of this album and, thanks to the CD handling abilities of my siblings, am probably destined to buy more. Hi-light: Billy corgan sums up every 15 year old kid's angst in mayonaise - "No more promise, no more sorrow No longer will I follow Can anybody hear me? I - just - want - to BE ME!" ahhhhhh Silverchair - Frogstomp. Probably raise a few eyebrows here but let me make it very clear - This album is a fucking great rock record. Most australian bands would severe their collective limbs to be able to write an album as complete and well written as this. Add the fact that they did it all at age 14 out of newcastle in 1995 - amazing. Shat me to tears when critics at the time called them "nirvana in pyjamas" when their sound owed everything to detroit-scene hard-rockers like Helmut, and much less to the quiet/loud Nirvana. Hi-light: cheesy lyrics aside "Israel's son" is a corker. Honorable mentions: The Beatles - Abbey Road (played till the vinyl melted) Nick Cave - Let love in Ice T - Power (Don't ask) Stone Roses - Self Titled Nirvana - Bleach Cream - Disraeli gears The meanies - 10% Weird Pearl Jam - Vitalogy Violent Femmes - Self titles Smashing Pumpkins - Gish Snout - Circle high and wide Led Zeppelin - II Best of Dire straits Jeff buckley - grace Ani Difranco - Up, up, up etc Once again only a few of these would make my all time top 10 but, as erin said, they made me who I am today. Love to all, hope you are all well. Glad to see laurie D blogging too, hope everything is sunny in your world. ta ta!!

 In my attempt to live a life identical to that of John Cusack's character in High Fidelity, and after being asked last night what my top 5 albums are of all time, I think I've narrowed it down... 1. The Cure 'Pornography' Favourite moment: The chorus of 'The Hanging Garden': 'fall fall fall fall out of the sky, jump jump out of time, fall fall fall fall out of the sky, cover my face as the animals cry' 2. Muse 'Absolution' Favourite moment: The point where Matt breaks into some kind of heightened desperation in the chorus of 'Sing For Absolution'... sing for absoluuuuuuution! I will be singing and falling from your grace 3. Ryan Adams 'Love Is Hell Pt 1' Favourite moment: The entrance of the Cello on 'The Shadowlands' 4. Counting Crows 'Recovering the Satellites' Favourite Moment: Adam's breakdown at the end of 'Miller's Angels' : 'Can't ya hear me? coz I'm screaming. I did not go outside yesterday. Don't wake me please, don't wake me! coz I was dreaming. And I might just stay inside again today. Yknow, I don't go out much these days. Sometimes I stay inside all day. So leave me leave me leave me alone. 5. PJ Harvey 'Stories From the City, Stories From the Sea' Favourite Moment: During the beautiful duet with Thom Yorke, 'This Mess We're In' when they get down to the spoken word bit and I'm pretty sure PJ says 'The sweat on my skin, (orgasmic 'uhhhh') ' I'm still not entirely sure of this lineup, it changes every week anyway. Honorable mentions: Depeche Mode 'Violator' David Bowie 'Low' Elbow 'Asleep In the Back' Strokes 'Room on Fire' Manic Street Preachers 'The Holy Bible' Interpol 'Turn On the Bright Lights' Ryan Adams 'Heartbreaker' Oasis 'Definitely, Maybe' The White Stripes 'De Stijl' Starsailor 'Silence Is Easy' Muse 'Showbiz' Pulp 'Different Class' Joy Division 'Closer' U2 'Achtung Baby' Radiohead 'OK Computer' BRMC - self titled James 'Pleased To Meet You' Counting Crows 'Across A Wire' The Smiths 'Louder Than Bombs' Morrissey 'Suedehead' All of these mentions deserve a place in the top five.... its just so hard! TRY IT!

 I shall now remain silent for the rest of the day in respect for (MUSE) Dom's Dad who passed away on site after their set at Glastonbury.

 I'm feeling so oddly positive today! I don't know why! But it just feels like a really good, day, I got outta bed, made myself a pipin hot mocha, realised there was nothing on t.v so decided to do my hilarious early 90s Jane Fonda Lean Routine. then felt pumped so went to the gym!!!!!!!!! Came home ate yummy Thai fried rice and now I just feel fan fucking tastic.... although a little full. Meanwhile, I'm noticing huge side affects of my medication, especially after the group of meds I'm taking have been in the news a lot lately for the bad affect they can have, I heard them talking about it on Hack (JJJ). Like I can't stop shaking/figetting, wake up with a headache and nausea every morning until I take my pill, and my mind is racing all the time, like I'm on speed, that's possibly why I'm freaking blogging so much!! Oh well time for coffee with Guy, yay! More caffeine!

 ok so i have been hiding in the miserable world of wisdom tooth extraction. actually hasnt been too bad, but today have some wierd tingling in my bottom lip and teeth. anyway not exactly exciting reading. just thought i'd let people know what rock i was sleeping under. apart from that life generally quite uneventful probably due to the fact i have only been leaving the house to get more jelly / custard / milkshake. hope all other members of team blog are well, maybe cheeky gin sometime shayne? peace out fat cheaks.

 MEANWHILE! HELLO? PERTH PEEPS???!!! Like where the hell are you? I want know about your lives godammit, I want something to read on this blog besides my own miserable dribbled shit! So get crackin! Speaking of dribbling shit, my observations of the day: - Kings Of Leon totally rule, everytime I listen to them they rule even more... altough I can't believe Caleb shaved off his beard! - Caleb is a really cool name - I haven't had a proper job for 7 months! goin strong! - Mercedes totally should have won America's Next Top Model - I blog way too much - Need more activities that don't require money - Velvet Goldmine is possibly the greatest soundtrack of all time. - Sometimes when I'm alone I'll just blurt out random things for no reason, like when I was just driving before and outta nowhere shouted out 'SHUT THE FUCK UP!' to nobody! blah blah blah blah blah talking way toooooo much SHIT

 urlLink had to post this photo... its so cute, and I'm getting all interpol crazy again in anitcipation...&nbsp; urlLink

 urlLink mmmmmmmm&nbsp; urlLink

 Meanwhile, what the hell has happened to Perth Rock City, could it have died??????? NOOOOOOOO!!!!!! Save them Arseman! Anyways, Da Boosh was on last night, fabulous. This show may just be the new Young Ones except one of them is REALLY hot! Yay for great British comedies now I can complete the top 5: 1. Young Ones 2. Bottom 3. Da Boosh 4. Black Books 5. Ab Fab Hmmm... I'm sure I must be missing something, but that sounds good to me. I could happily watch nothing but those 5 shows for the rest of my life.

 The following are a list of AWESOME gigs that i will not get to see because I'm living below the poverty line...... I think I'm going to implode: Ben Kweller, Belle and Sebastion, the WHO, Kelis, Young Heart Attack, Electric Six, Fiery Furnaces, Jurassic 5, Blonde Redhead, Ugly Duckling, the Streets, Brides of Destruction and sob sob sob..... Franz Ferdinand....... CURSE THIS POVERTY! THAT'S IT! I GIVE UP!! I'M GONNA LOOK FOR SOME SHIT KICKING, SOUL DESTROYING JOB! oh the humanity....

 boo hoo...My sisters have gone back to the west side. They arrived on Tuesday the 22nd, and left Sunday 27th. That's 5 full on days and nights my friends...But I think I did a pretty good job of showing off our little vic! Every night at least 3-4 different bars/pubs/clubs, and every day shops and landmarks...And it was great for me..cos half of em I had never been to either (being relatively fresh to melbs!). But when they packed up and left my little flat on Sunday I bawled my eyes out. Not only because I don't know when we will all get to spend so much time all together ever again, or when ill next see them...But because I realized I am the luckiest person in the world to have such an amazing bond with them. Just thinking about them makes my heart all gushy and whimpering sounds come from my throat! I don't care if I sound like one of the Brady's, they are so dear to me it hurts. Ok, I've probably made some of you spew by now so ill cut it out. Hallelujah...I have a mattress! A real one! New, bouncy, soft...Yet firm, no bugs in...And its all mine...Every night (actually don't know if that's such a good thing!). I just slept a whopping 12 hours on it, so it must be a goodie. Speaking of many hours spent....I calculated I spent 9 whole hours with my sisters at the espy on sat evening. That's longer than the average working day...And I spent it solidly drinking...Its actually disgusting! However, in those hours from 6pm till 3am, I did not stop laughing. Highlights included: -The best air guitar session I have EVER witnessed. Small, fat, bald rocker running around the espy doing scissor kicks and guitar and drum solos simultaneously! Laughed for a good hour at him. -Being told I had "nice puppies", then Prue slapping the culprits ass and telling him he had "nice puppies" -Prue in general...fucking hilarious gal -Seeing random guy from my highschool in WA and a waapa pal as well -Guy who came over to us an said "hey I'm Deano, and IM here to make you smile" then he pulled his pants to show us he was wearing Calvin Kleins!!!!!!!!!!Was probably funnier to be there. -Deano coming back to pull his calvin's off and shove his bare ass five centimeters from mine and Erin's face! -Generally all the randoms met...And there were many (Brendon the plumber from Canberra calling the toilet a shit shoot). -Coming home to deface my fridge Perth style with buntine...Then continuing to laugh myself to bed for laughings sake (Furze and poodle you know what I mean!) In conclusion, what a pearler of an evening....Will go down as a fave. As will the last week. Hope all are well. hooroo x

 Currently really digging: diet coke with lime dijonnaise microsoft publisher classy porn, erotica, if you will my dog mojo's wierd pizza sleeping return of Aus Idol ghostbusters holidays scotch randoms sex fruit n nut chocolate and bubble baths Certainly NOT digging: my tooth ache gretel kileen and her constant smug tone kylie minogue (thinking its her god given right to sleaze onto the entire world) spewing driving petrol

 OOOH! and another band for y'all to check out: Spoonful. So fuckin cool man, Rock n Roll in its greatest form, very talented guys. Saw em at the Espy last night, but couldn't buy their CD cause they'd already sold out. OOH! and a sandwich for y'all to check out: ham that you cut yourself of a big chunk like at christmas, avacado and dijonnaise ..... oooooh baby.... there's a party in my mouth... a taste sensation.

 The world is becoming more human. Well maybe not so much the world, but certainly my world. People are talking more. Its nice to talk to people you don't know and find out stuff and learn from them. Our greatest resource, afterall, is other people. I've only just truly learnt this lesson in the last 24 hours. Just thinking about all the wierd and wonderful people I've met in that small space of time, and how I learnt a little something from each one of them. Its so much easier to talk to and understand people when you're comfortable with who you are. Its so strange how people build up all these walls just to protect themselves from other people. This is probably why I'm enjoying it so much, because I've only recently become comfortable, I mean I had to go through hell and back but it was worth it. Now I realise that all the things I thought were problems, weren't really, they're just stuff that happens around you that passes in time and you out-grow it. I realised this walking home from the train station today, still drunk at 10am. And although I had black eye make up smeared all over my face, and my hair was pointing in several thousand directions, and my cowboy boots were giving me blisters.... I decided not to wait 20 mins for the tram but to walk instead, and then when i got to my street and the tram i would have caught went zooming past me.. i just smiled.

 Although I find it very amusing that 15 people have come here looking for 'This Is Rock Bitch photos' and another search for 'she was chlorophormed and bound movies' and 'larry emder' surely the most amusing one was somebody searching Yahoo for : 'DOES SHAYNE LIKE ERIN' AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA LOL I'm serious, somebody actually searched that and was lead here. I hope its true Shaynal.

 I must say that I am lovin my new hair... especially now that I've patched and bedazzled my denim jacket (with 500 silver studs) I keep catching glances of myself in the mirror and sayin 'hey. you rock.' Ahh heheheh I'm so falsely conceited. i love it. Anyways, I've got nothing else to say really... so... here's some of the songs in my head today... sing along if you will: The Paybacks - Scotch Love The Hells - Time Killer Pretty Girls Make Graves - Speakers Push The Air The Strokes - NYC Cops Kings Of Leon - Red Morning Light Victory, Victory The Winning Blinds 13 13 99 Soledad Brothers - Prodigal Stones Blues Metallica - Enter Sandman Madonna - Cherish hmmmmmmmmmmm a pretty rockin day when ya put it like that.. smell ya later.

 Well I said I was gonna get Rock n Roll wasted... I certainly Rocked and I certainly Rolled over outta bed today to spew my Scotch Love into a nearby bucket ....... all day. But myeeehhhhhh it was worth it!! So I went to Revolver for Indie Initiative and I might go so far as to say it was the BEST one yet. Unfortunately I missed the first band: Sojourn but made in time for the others: The Pranks: I can see why people love this band, and why they have such a lively and large following. I must say the audience added a great deal to this awesome performance. They had it all: stompin' good rock songs, quirky rocknroll singer with zany attitude and an awesome strong voice, a cool guy rockin out on the Rhodes......... but this business of 'having it all' only makes me think I've seen all this before. I mean sure, they had great songs, the crowd loved it, the singer jumped off the stage and rolled around on the ground.... but isn't that what everybody does? hmm.... maybe I'm being overly critical, and acting like a typical spoilt little melbourne audience... The Roys: In a word: sensational. No! wait! I need more words! It was so refreshing to see people handpicking EXCELLENT influences on their music and turning them into something uniquely their own. This band seriously was one of the best I've seen in a long time. They were like Kings of Leon/Johnny Cash/alternative country/southern rock ... with the vocals and demeanor of Julian Casablancas... and some hilarious facial expressions from the drummer. If you get the chance, go out and seem em. Yeah so, the rest of the night is pretty much a write-off... the more scotch i drank the less i remember.... and that weed tipped me right over the edge... I do remember being at Pony when it closed and taking 2 random boys with us .. and I do remember driving my car home from Alana's at 9am. And I certainly remember spewing my guts up all day..... didn't get outta my pjs till 6pm. rock and or roll ciao

 urlLink Interpol's new album to be released in September is called ANTICS. And gdammit, they didn't include the song called Rod Laver. Shit. I was looking forward to that.&nbsp; urlLink

 La La La.... I'm gonna get soooooo Rock n Roll wasted this evening, I can feel it in my bones!!!!!!! I've got that energy buzzing around my body that can only mean one thing: That I'm gonna drink a shit load of 'Scotch Love' on the rocks, see some rockin bands and go crazy styles! yeeeeeaaah! I AM A DEMON AND I LOVE ROCK N ROLL! Destinations on the list this evening: Revolver 161 Flipside @ Republika Cherry/Pony OOHHHHHHHHHHHH YEEEEEEEAHHHHHHHH!!! PS - Straight Scotch is the new drink, G&Ts are so last season. So this means I'm changing my DJ name from DJ Messy G&T to DJ Scotch Love. Audi.

 MY BEAUTIFUL HAIR! Yes, in another fit of rage and insanity yesterday, I cut all my hair off. I dunno what happened really, one minute I was calmly painting, the next minute I was hacking into my hair with a handy Stanley knife, .... then decided if I was gonna hack into my hair I should really do it with scissors. So the result is, most of my hair being around 3 inches long... but the sides are still touching my shoulders. ok thats not a very good description, but it looks alright, in fact it'd be pretty cool... if I was a boy. Why do I always end up with cool hair for a boy? Anyways, I guess I'll just have to live with looking like some estranged member of Supergrass or somethin. BUT IT TOOK ME SO DAMN LONG TO GROW ALL LONG AND GIRLY! oh well.

 Hey Elanor! I just realised that 'This Is Rock Bitch' is gonna be on SBS again on Friday night.... ahh hehehehe that hilarious band/sex commune.

 Can I just point out that Monday nights (particularly last night) are TV GOLD! jerry! GOLD !!! Just like the best night of TV ever! Let me break it down: 6:00 flick between the Simpsons (Ch 10 or Fox8) and Get Smart (TV1) 6:30 Eastenders (UKTV) 7:00 the Simpsons (FOX8) flick to Allo Allo ( UKTV) 7:30 Classic Albums (SBS) Last night was Lou Reed Transformer (so good) 8:30 The Boosh (SBS) MY NEW FAVOURITE SHOW!!!! so hilarious 9:00 Queer Eye (10)(second half) or Pizza ( SBS) 9:30 Enough Rope with Andrew Denton (ABC) or Astro Boy (Cartoon Network) 10:30 Inside Edition (trashy hollywood news) (arena) 11:00 Friends (arena) 11:30 Saturday Night Live (arena) Ok, I'm not saying that I'm doing nothing but watching TV that whole time (ok maybe I am) but at least the options are there! Its GOLD! And everybody get into the Boosh , its soooooooo good, and one of the guys is soooooo hot... and soooo brrritish and its on SBS so everyone can watch it! yay!

 check this I just finished reading that FIGHT CLUB may be getting turned into a Broadway Musical with music and songs created by the Dust Brothers. At first i thought that this was crazy, but the more I think about it the more it strikes me that this might be an amazing idea. The worlds first Neo-Facist Post Millenial Break Beat Guerilla Musical. Kinda Cool!!

 Considering I can't buy new music, I've been rediscovering my old collection, and I've just realised how many little gems I have! One in particular that I bought last year during my obsession with the best city in the world: YES NEW YORK . Its got so many awesome tracks on it! Including stuff from Radio 4, The Rogers Sisters, Ted Leo/Pharmacists, Calla, Le Tigre, the Strokes, Interpol, the Rapture, the Walkmen and lcd Soundstystem . So fucking cool. Go out and buy it.

 Hey yo, I can't believe how good the Virgin Suicides soundtrack sounds on awesome headphones. Its like a sound sensation! Meanwhile, I'm gonna do the whole 'Look what people were searching for to end up at this sight' thing, coz I always think they're hilarious, and disturbing: Rebecca Cartright Naked Rock Your Body John Sex Justin (???????) McLeod's daughters McLeod's daughters Soundtrack McLeod's daughters theme song McLeod's daughters naked Kathy Griffen Kathy Griffen Nude (!!!!!) Lyn Scully pictures (!!!!!) Nude Girls Playing Twister (?) Molly Meldrum Toasted and Roasted Australian Rodeo Circut And more McLeod's Daughters crap, I can't even remember writing anything about McLeod's Daughters! I wasn't even aware that people actually watched that fucking show, oh yeah... the logies.

 HAPPY BIRTHDAY GUY! Yay! yay! YAY!!!!! Let's all celebrate urlLink Guy and how wonderful he is, and how's he's touched our lives! And how he's just so damn cool! And how he's 23! WWWWWWWWWWHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHOOOOOOOOOO- HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! I love you Guy!!!!

 hello friends and lovers... ... dunno why it's been so long between blogs, I guess i been introperverted or somethin'. For the record Bumtime, the job you have described is not a job. It's your life. So I guess if yo gettin' paid for that it's cool. I think a Melbourne holiday is so in order that all it will take is a day of cheap flights anf I'm there. Especially now that I don't think that i'll be over for Fashion Week (I got offered a really good, meaty, secondment here in perth Production Managing a few venues for the Art Rage festival). Hope you are all okay... ...and balls

 Finally, an AWESOME job Yes, yes thanks to Craig I finally have my dream job. In fact this is possibly what my brain was designed to do. In fact, I'm sure I've written here at some stage: Why can't I just talk and gossip about British bands and popstars and get paid for it? Well finally the gods have taken a liking to me. Coz that's basically what I'm doing! Yippee! This is the greatest job in the history of the universe! I love it i love it i love it. sigh. Plus I've finished school for 3 weeks! yay! Time to celebrate by going out and seeing some mu-zac ... possibly the Beings. yes, I think that shall be in order.

 oh man, why can't i write that much on my S.W.O.T analysis and market research for sponsorship assignment? doh.

 I don't want to make you more depressed little Poodle, because I love you, but something you said has been a matter of intreague to me for some time. The fact that we try to sleep for longer to avoid the day, and is this some non-permanent form of suicide? Avoiding life, sneaking into oblivion in hope that life will pass us by. It reminds me of a confession made by an anonymous English writer in Alfred Alvarez's classic study 'The Savage God': Both my parents, for different reasons, regarded death as the perfect release from their troubles. Like my father, I have always demanded too much of life and people and relationships - far more than exists really. And when I find that it doesn't exist, it seems like a rejection... In the afternoons, my mother and father both retired to sleep. That is, they retired to death. They really died for the afternoons. My father was a parson. He had nothing to do, he had no work. I begin now to understand how it was for him. When I'm not working, I'm capable of sleeping through most of the morning. Then I start taking sleeping pills during the day to keep myself in a state of dopiness so that I can sleep at any time. To take sleeping pills during the day to sleep isn't so far from taking sleeping pills in order to die. It's just a bit more practical and a bit more craven. But during those afternoons I used to be alive and lively. It was a great big house but I never dared make a sound... I felt terribly rejected,... their door was always shut. ... And those afternoons went on a long time. Because of the war I went back to live with them, and it was still exactly the same. If I ever bumped myself off it would be in the afternoon. The reason is simple: when I'm alone, I stop believing I exist. Sorry...... that was really really depressing, it wasn't intentional, just something I'm interested in at the moment. But Poodle, I've come to the conclusion that you can't wait for something to happen, you have to make it happen yourself. Think in terms of a slate: with layers upon layers of projects, thinking about one while you're in the middle of something else, always keep the ball rolling, always keep your mind active and progressive otherwise it will fall numb and give in. It is much more exciting and fulfilling to try and fail than to never leave your pillow. And try at a million things! At a million billion things! even if thy're just a floating fantasy that popped into your head oe day, do something about it, talk to randoms in the street, write it down, tell somebody, get excited. Once you start, it will become infectious and wild, and you'll find yourself a whole lot happier than you are now. DO IT NOW!

 This is a call out to anyone else who is a) sleeping in as long as they can to pass time, b) watching a collection of dvd/videos they have seen a billion times to pass time, c) reading cookbooks to pass time, d) is lacking any kind of motivation to do anything but these hideous activities! Yes people, its a vicious cycle when you find yourself at a point in your life patiently waiting for something to begin (like your fucking work experience), and you become depressed because you're not doing anything. Then you are uninspired and you can't utilise your "free time" doing things because you feel too pathetic and miniscule to attempt anything but the activities i've listed above. Sorry to be so lame and self pitying...basically just asking if anyone wants to have coffee?.......Guy?

 urlLink Indeed. Some dickhead on eBay is actually auctioning a 'Merlin Commemoratve Tshirt' Which says Free Ta Refugees in tape! Its just Tape! Its not even printed and the current bid is $45!!!!!!!!!!!!!! what is wrong with people? Ok, now, I'm REALLY procrastinating.&nbsp; urlLink

 Anyways, here's Erin's recommendations for the week: ALL NEW RECORDS FROM: The Walkmen Van Las Veda (dunno bout the spelling, but very very cool) Modest Mouse The Beastie Boys PJ Harvey The Hives The Panics The Datsuns Riff Random (they're growing on me ok! ...and their random riffs) Ben Kweller For those out to purchase CDs think of me, who can't afford to actually buy these

 HEY SHAYNE! YEAH YOU! I SEE YOU IN YOUR BLOCKBUSTER UNIFORM READING ALONG COZ YOU'VE GOT NOTHIN ELSE TO DO! You better start bloggin on this bitch like a flavour sachet on noodles, you feel me? Or I'mma buss' yo' ass like a sissy virgin bi-atch, and you gonna take it, fo' real. fool.

 She started freezing, lungs all collapsing The momentum is passing But the moment is eating us whole We're surrounded Put the guns in the water, they're turning to vodka Triggering nothing we're sinking, the sea takes the ship. And I'm really dying in here I'm really dying in here And I'm afraid, No I'm scared, I'm just scared Just let me down. -Ryan Adams

 So.... My Mamma lent me the money for a new canvass. Boy it feels good to paint again, its been so long! Even though I dipped my brush in what I thought was oil paint medium and was actually my wine... then I accidentally took a sip of it ..... oooh nasty. But I got a good feeling about this one, I think its a winner... its very .... Confrontational, and not in a sexual or perverse way ... For a change. Something interesting we learnt about at school today: yesterday they released 'Air Express' along with Air Tunes. A device which acts as an adapter to your stereo plug about the size of 2 matchboxes stuck together. What it does is similar to the iTrip (iPod) in its wireless connection to a spare frequency on your radio. Allowing you to play digital music files from your computer wirelessly to and iPodish remote to any stereo/speakers in your house to a range of 45m. The same thing will eventually happen with televisions, allowing you to wirelessly watch movies stored on your computer. The cool thing is they only cost around $50! Finally, technology is becoming exciting again. Just like when the cassette-based walkman was invented to revolutionize the music consumption and experience. Pretty soon (and probably happening now) everything to do with home entertainment (music, movies, television, radio, surround sound, internet, downloading) will be operated from a device the size of a matchbox, tuned into a small notebook computer. Awesome.

 urlLink Here's another one.... my favourite, which is as yet untitled. Meanwhile, I hope this exhibition actually happens. Can't paint at the moment 'cause the funds have depleted but one I start workin the streets, doing Dallas shall we say...... i may be able to produce some more. This is what its come to folks. &nbsp; urlLink

 the invite and collection so far look amazing, make sure you let me know when opening is so i have enough time to get on a plane and organise a manic ruffle skirt to wear to the party........

 Met this German guy last night who waxed lyrical and at length about how melbourne is the best city in the world and being there was the best time of his life. I´m now officially homesick, and really surprised at myself for it. Didn´t think it was something I was capable of. So tired today I couldn´t even organise myself to see yet another museum, so I randomly walked the streets of Berlin listening to the Datsuns over and over. Think the Berlin police have probably put out an APB by now on a weirdo air drumming furiously outside various city land-marks. Air drumming is my favourite past time of all time. Any one who ever came to the now infamous (is it now infamous? can we say that?) rockroom will attest to my air drumming enthusiasm, if not quite my talent. truth be told I´m a pretty average drummer in real life, but in "headphones on, air-drum" world I am the love child of john bonham and Chad Smith. My air drum kit is a massive 80´s Tommy Lee style cage with 13 rack toms, 9 floor toms and a double kick. And cymbals, yeah, shitloads of cymabals like on Wayne´s world when garth does that wicked solo...cool. I rule the world-wide air drum scene with an iron fist and I´m constantly being sought out to play on high profile "air-sessions" with bands like Jefferson Airplane, Aerosmith and ummm...AIR. yeah, rock. God I wish i had a mullet.

 urlLink PS - This is what the invite MAY look like. by the way, the details like the address and details and stuff are wrong, I just had to make it up for an assignment. but it is definitely called: YOU MAY KISS THE INSIDE OF MY HAND AS WELL &nbsp; urlLink

 urlLink 'If The Moment Ever Comes'&nbsp; urlLink

 urlLink YAY! thanks to Chris I can give y'all a sneak peak at some of the stuff going into my exhibition! This one's called 'The Sea Takes The Ship'&nbsp; urlLink

 erin step away from the blog - you seem to have taken procrastination to a new level. hopefully one day you will find yourself a course where you can submit this website as you assignment.......then it really will be watch out class.

 Oh GOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I NEEEEEEED WINE SWEETIE!!!!!

 OH GOD OH GOD OH GOD OH GOD!!!!! I feel like Bernard in the first episode of Black Books when he's trying to do his taxes and has to reread the question 800 times and still doesn't know what it means and then does anything to avoid it including inviting Jahovah's Witnesses in for a cup of tea and a chat about Jesus. I've been reading this question for the last 2 hours: The artist's first album is released by the company on the 31st Jan 2000; the Contract is signed on the 30th April 2000. If two options are exercised by the company, on what date with the contract terminate? 'Option Period' means the period commencing on the expiry of the Initial Period or previous Option Period (as the case may be) and expring nine (9) months after the first cmmercial release in Aust on Records by the Company of the Minimum Commitment for Option Period. AAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHH there's pages and pages of this crap. Its not my fault I couldn't pay attention in this class! It was so boring! the only time it interested me was when we got to make costumes at lunchtime and come as our favourite part of a recording contract; in which i made a crown out of sticks and came as Overseas Royalties. Oh god oh god oh god oh god sweetie.

 I was also impressed by this: Leno's Voicemail Message Pauses For Laughter LOS ANGELES—Tonight Show host Jay Leno's home outgoing voicemail message stops briefly to allow for audience laughter, sources reported Monday. "You have reached the home of Mavis and Jay Leno, and if you don't know what to do by now, then you've got bigger problems than Martha Stewart,'" said Leno's recording, followed by a five-second silence. "But seriously, callers, at the beep, leave a message." After a short pause, Leno's message concluded, "Am I right?" Ok.... now I really gotta do some work.....

 urlLink This is one of the most disturbing yet fascinating things I have ever read. Man, I really wanna read the whole letter but I can't find it!

 So, we went to see Justin Timberlake last night (me, poodle and laurie d). I dunno, mixed feelings. Even before I went a found it a little odd for him to be still touring an album that came out at the end of 2002. I also found it odd that he was playing at Festival Hall , also known as 'Festy Hole', had I been willing to pay $140 for a ticket, I would have been very disappointed. Justin was his usual average kinda self, tryin to talk all black but occasionally slipping back into default white boy accent and sounding like Ed Norton. He was completely overshadowed by his band who were just: SO ....... FUCKING ....... GREAT They were the main reason I wanted to go to the gig. Or the main reason I wanna go and see any of these huge Popstars, because they have the most fucking amazingly talented bands in the world. Especially somebody like Justin, whose music I admired purely for the sounds they were using and all the incredible detail that goes into the music when you really listen to it and ignore his wailing over the top of it. But yeah, thats my cheap thrills for the week, seeing another popstar. Getting all wierded out when girls absolutely screamed a lung out when he took off his shirt (to reveal ....oooooh another shirt). And seeing Cam Diaz watching on from the side and having a bit of a boogie, for some reason my brain is telling me that that's kind of special or something. Anywho, thats that. now I gotta run and do 8000000 assignments before Wed. So expect an even greater amount of procrastination posts in the next 48 hours. PS- I'd like to add that when I offered a ticket to urlLink Guy, thinking that he's finished Uni forever and is free to do anything and everything for like ... the rest of his life, he replied 'Hmm Justin, one album, not worth it.' to which I replied 'Not worth what??!! Its a free ticket!! What are you going to do instead?' he replied ' Cher is on TV, I think I'm gonna watch it, don't tell anyone' well I'm tellin ! Coz that is the lamest thing like ..... ever!

 Bought the Datsuns album today at Dussman (das Kultur Kaufhaus) for 9 Euro. What a steal! Listening to it now on the ol' pod while on a beanbag at Mitte Backpackers Hostel, watching Greece destroy Portugal in the Euro 2004 madness. The Datsuns are even better than the Greek striker Savoulakis, who is, incidently, wearing a headband. I'm in Berlin, a city that is quickly proving so cool it's intimidating. So many randomly amazing galleries, graffiti and haircuts. The music scene here is unreal and everyone is so sophisticated, but in an unpretentious, bohemian, politically enlightened kinda way. Going to Bastard tonight to see some of the local talent and get rock and roll wasted. At some point I may even close my eyes, sway awkwardly and pretend I'm at Pony... Quick "rock am ring" report - did the kind of silly thing of spending more time backstage getting pissed than watching bands, but what we did see (from side of stage) rocked the casbah. Jet, Muse, Faithless, Red Hot Chilli Peppers and a bunch of Kraut rock that I can't quite pronounce or remember. Hi light was definetly playing pool with Muse backstage. Chris and Dom were absolute sweethearts. Watching Chris tackle Deluxe (Steve Tucker for the unititiated) to the ground while I poked him with a pool cue will remain one of the more bizarre memories from this trip. Actually even better was returning to camp site only to hook up with some hilarious locals, who showed us how to smoke hash and do vodka shots with the aid of wizz-fizz. Muchos political discussion ensued, noone hates Bush like the Germans (or the French, or the Russians, or anyone under 35) So what the hell is going on back home? I turn my back for one second and you guys let Millsy release an album. Shouldn't you have been waging an orchestrated internet-based hate campaign or something? Slack guys, real slack. Even heard he hooked up with Paris again, what a classy guy.

 Ron. the red headed kid, his name is Ron. thank you. wish i was in melbourne this weekend, but hey what's new wish i was in melbourne every weekend. feel particularly like having my face frozen into pain at this point in time, and Pert feels a little bit more lifeless than usual tonight. ie the city has fallen into a coma. thank you.

 After that last post I realised how much shit I've been dribbling recently, also realised I haven't taken my meds for 3 days. So its back to the sweeping generalisations which have made me the hypocritical bitch I am today: - The Dissociatives' music is over-produced, over-polished wank. When you combine 2 perfectionists like Paul Mac and Daniel Johns you end up with music which is about as interesting as staring at a coffee table that's had a once-over with Mr Sheen. - Miriam makes me extremely uncomfortable. Her appearance in the Big Brother house was the most distasteful non-event I have ever witnessed. Not to mention how awkward everyone was when Gretel asked her if she was a feminist, to which she blankly stared. - the kid with the red hair from Harry Potter has grown up to be HOTTTT Diggity Dawg. I'm lovin the whole rock look. - The Datsuns album is ridiculously good. Unrivalled even... as far as recent rock albums go. - Somebody should shoot Rob Mills in the temple, then run at his body with an axe, carving up every bloodied inch of him and then stick them in a blender, then drink the puree of his body and then vomit it all over his new record. That's what I think of it.

 Just remembered my Strokes/Honey-Wafer analogy. Can't remember if I ever blogged about it. But I was just listening to Room on Fire again and its so true! If the Strokes' music were a food it would be crushed up wafer biscuits, and Julian's vocals are honey being drizzled all over them. ITS TRUE PEOPLE!

 In the few hours I have the house to myself before my mother gets home and questions my entire reason for existence, I like to potter around the house and do useless shit like, blogging, watching TV (without disapproving looks)and today I sat down to play the piano, something I haven't tried to do seriously for a good 15 years. After simply making noise for around 10 minutes and realising I can't play much but some very basic scales and some little tune about a river, I opened up my piano stool thingy where I used to keep all my theory books. Whoa. Haven't looked in there since I was about 9. I came across a small music exercise book from when I was 6, its so cute. There's all these adorable little scribbled notes in it like: major = happy, minor = sad ; and 'a phrase is a curved line over the notes, it is a musical sentence' . I remember how much I desperately wanted to be good at piano and how much I would punish myself when I wasn't. Hence the very last page in the book was my first attempt at writing a song, I remember it was the most personal thing I had ever written at the ripe old age of 6 and it was called 'Creating'. I played again today for the first time in years and its the saddest song I have ever heard. I'm pretty sure I quit learning piano soon after writing it.

 My dog is getting smaller.

 I've been listening to a fair bit of Morrissey's new album 'You Are The Quarry', and I dunno if this was the intention, but all I can do is laugh. Everything about it is just sooooo Morrissey that it seems like he's taking the piss. And considering this is supposed to be his most acclaimed solo album, that wouldn't surprise me. The funniest thing about it is the song titles, for anyone who was ever a Morrissey fan to have a chuckle at: I Have Forgiven Jesus The World Is Full Of Crashing Bores How Could Anybody Possibly Know How I Feel All The Lazy Dykes You Know I Wouldn't Last and this is a corker... the B-side to the new single (First Of the Gang to Die) ‘My Life Is An Endless Succession Of People Saying Goodbye’ Ah Mozza. So tortured. Meanwhile it seems like the NME is still obsessed with him, posting a whole article about his 'controversial' comment at one of his own gigs about wishing it was George W. Bush who'd died instead of Reagan. I mean really, everybody's thinking it!

 Blog has been a thoroughly entertaining read lately. Can completely agree with the poodle point. As distateful as working within the framework of modern society can be, it's hard to turn your back on it without discarding everything it provides. I've never been very comfortable working a set hours job for someone else so I chose/choose not to. That's probably a complete oversimplification (i still got some bosses) but at least it's kind of on my own terms, which keeps me from going crazy. I still get people asking me what I do for a real job but, hey, I'm no slave to the man. I HATE it when I have to get up for work, I mean like, really loathe and despise it. I think the ultimate goal is to subvert the reality you must exist in order to bring it slightly closer to your own little insane vision. Like Guy said, just inject enough of your own insanity to keep everything from overwhelming you while reinterpreting the modern existentialist reasoning of....J-LO GOT MARRIED AGAIN???? Why didn't anyone tell me this??!! Ahhh....I can feel blog floating back into normalcy. Guy have you heard the new Britney album?

 urlLink He he he he he ehhehehehehe. I just couldn't resist the temptation anymore! This photo is just so damn hilarious and been patiently sitting there waiting to be posted for so long! See Furze, this is what happens when you don't post hilarious photos of yourself overseas, I DO IT FOR YOU! ahhhhhhhhhhh hahahahaha&nbsp; urlLink

 urlLink Man, Ladytron just so like continually RULE! I don't think they could ever become uncool. I just can't stop listening to them! just so coooooool..... yeah....&nbsp; urlLink

 Yeah, sorry to open up the 'serious' can of worms, something that isn't often done on Maybe I'll Go Blind. But the reason I've been posting absolute shit lately is because I'm really thinking about this crap 24 hours a day and can't really think about celebrities anymore! What's happening to me? How dare I not be concerned with celebs!!! I didn't even know J-Lo got married til yesterday...... wait, maybe that's coz nobody else cared either. Indeed Poodle, The Unbearable Lightness Of Being is an excellent book, but somehow I actually feel Milan Kundera is partly responsible for this creeping craziness....... in fact if I read any more of his books or indeed re-read them I think I will go insane! I can't handle having anything else to think about! It hurts my head! I say this and then look down at the books I borrowed from the library: The Irvine Welsh OMNIBUS (trainspotting, the acid house, marabou stork nightmares) White Rabbit - A Psychedelic Reader 'tripping' with Miles Davis, William S Burroughs, Oscar Wilde, Paul Gauguin etc. and 'On Suicide' - Great Writers on the Ultimate Question (plath, camus, tolstoy, greene etc) Catherine - I woulda got out Miller, as I've always meant to read it but I go to crappy NMIT where they've only just realised that books exist. hmmmm.... don't think I'm doing myself any favours.

 Ok...have thought about your last post in depth poodle, and i do agree. I have often thought our society is a load of absolute wank, and still do, and why should i have to work? It can be, and has been, at times soul destroying. However, it is contradictory to "talk this talk" and then turn around and indulge in every other aspect of society besides work. No one i know (including myself) works souly for basic human rights such as food, shelter etc. We work so that we can obtain and enjoy the "fineries". To buy clothes, cd's, cars, alcohol, cigarettes, computers blah, blah, blah.....Do any of us really want to give those things up? I suggest if one disagrees so much with the society we live in....go bush! Ignore every part of it. I remember saying to my mother at approx. age 13/14 "I just want to go and live on an island, with no people and just catch fish and draw!" ...Jesus...can you imagine?!!! Think of that film 'Human Nature'! And that thought still comes back to me. But I am not willing to do that just yet! Despite what some of you may think about me frolicking about in nature! I am currently reading/re-reading 'The Unbearable Lightness of Being' and it seems to make everything make sense. I don't want my life to be "light"...i want some parts of it to be heavy..i want some weight...am not really expressing myself very well here! But Erin, maybe go back and read over that...it may help. Woah...It's all very serious....

 As far back as I can remember, I've had this sneaking suspicion that I will one day end up going insane. Has anyone else felt that? I've just always felt that my brain is actually capable of insanity, that one day I'll just completely lose it, completely lose the ability to hold it all together. I'm not trying to be my usual attention seeking overly dramatic self here but this is seriously what I've always thought, and I think the moment has arrived. I've noticed that especially in the last 12 months I've been drifting further and further away from reality. This used to be because I had nothing to do, and thus nothing to focus on. And that extremely brief stint that I did working full time kind of helped because it gave me some kind of false sense of worth. I convinced myself that by getting up at 5am and mixing paint for Tradies til 6pm I was actually servicing my community, I was actually giving back to the society that had supposedly given me so much. I've since convinced myself that this is a load of shit. Everybody is convinced that working is the right, good and honest thing to do with your life. And if you don't do it then you're a disgrace and a bludger and a brat. The fact that I don't work at the age of 22 is frowned upon by basically every single person I know. The main reason for this I guess, is they see it as me relying on others to get me through life financially, and I should stop being such a spoilt brat and get over it. But there's a larger question here, is our sole purpose to simply arrive at the workplace the majority of us despise to do shitkicking tasks for richer, ignorant people (who are simply doing jobs even richer and more ignorant people) purely to attain this abstract concept of money SIMPLY SO THAT WE CAN CLOTHE AND FEED OURSELVES? I refuse to do that in order to have those simple human rights! .... ... And that brings me back to my point of not being in touch with reality. ... This is the kind of shit that is constantly swirling around in my head and its getting worse every day. To the point where I'm completely unaware of my surroundings. Today I snapped out of one of these weird 'thought comas' and realised that lunchtime was over and my class had gone back inside 20 minutes ago and left me sitting there! Getting scared....... not quite sure what to do.

 Whoo-Hoo! REAGAN'S DEAD! Its so funny, how basically everybody hates this guy,.... well maybe mainly me, and then the news comes out with this: LOS ANGELES - Ronald Reagan, the cheerful crusader who devoted his presidency to winning the Cold War, trying to scale back government and making people believe it was “morning again in America,” died Saturday after a long twilight struggle with Alzheimer’s disease. He was 93. What a pile of crap.

 Back in Melbourne. And I just remembered that I forgot to stalk the guys @ Perth Rock City while I weas there. Dammit! Anyways, thank you to all of my beautiful perthonalities for looking after me, and giving me a place to stay that wasn't the gutter and for just generaly being the majority of ultra-cool peeps in my life. In other news.... WHOO-HOO! Creed have broken up! Yay! No more god-rock! Now we've just gotta get rid of fuckin Nickleback . In more news, my hair looks kind of retarded now that I don't have Piche's Straightener.... I look kinda like Baby's sister Lisa in Dirty Dancing mixed with Betty Page . Hmmm... I know which one I'd rather be. And finally, I am going crazy styles at bars this week coz I've missed them so, So if you're lookin for me, I expect you'll find me at any of the following: Pony, Ding Dong, Cherry, Revolver, Duke, Sin-e, Weekender, Republika, Pony, Pony, Pony, Pony, Pony.... and Pony. ciao.

 Yes yes hello. Agghh, I've felt so naked without my precious bloggy. So, yes I am on the westside for one more night only. Any volunteers in Melbourne willing to pick me up at 5am from Melbourne airport? No, didn't think so. So yeah, Perth is kinda cool, but I have no idea how I occupied my time here for 4 years. What the hell was I doing all that time? Am majorly disappointed that they've converted Amplifier into some shit-ass 'sports' bar. That place was like the only cool place Perth had going for it! And no Elanor, I didn't vandalise the Restaurant that stoopidly won 'My Restaurant Rules' But I was pretty bloody tempted. Meanwhile with all the shit-house 'DIY Rescue' style artwork in that place it already looks like somebody has come at it in a pink wife-basha and polystyrene.....shudder..... thats enough vandalism for one place. And as Poodle pointed out, nobody goes to the Scotsman anymore. I dunno what happened here. But all the magic seems to have vanished. Evaporated. There's no longer a certain buzz that gushes through these flat, rusty, bland suburbs. Instead, there's a shell. A place which once held a group of people who essentially all wanted the same thing. And now, the things those people want have changed, and they've drifted elsewhere. And there's strangers living in that house on Walcott St. And... I guess... that's ok.

 Furzikins...back in four weeks? Wow that seems quick...mind you, you have probably lived 10 lifetimes per month away! Will b great to c u. Still rockin out in perthy, havin some fun, drinking far to much...tuesday involved boozy lunch, one bottle of wine to myself, and dinner, bottle of wine and bottle of champas, then post dinner cocktails, half bottle of gin!! Consequently i was severly hungover and ill on wednesday and could not have anything to drink, meaning no scottsman action. Poor erin then had no one to drink with at the scotty as everyone else had bailed. Not a happy lady. Perth is in her bad books. I'm still lovin it though and will b sad to say goodbye again. I do kind of miss the bright lights of the big smoke... melbournes night life is A1...perths is below sea level! Oh well enough from me. Ps cheer up poodle xoxo

 Hi gang, just a quick note to say I'm alive and well and temporarily relocated to Amsterdam. Beautiful city, lots of canals, mary-jane, bridges, cafe's where you can buy pre-rolled joints, 300 year-old architecture, weed, museums, galleries, "A" grade skunk, jazz, spliffs, trumpets, angels...oh you can also get marijuana here. It's a really fun city, probably the most liberal bunch of people I've ever collectively met. And not just liberal in the "h my god they've legalised hookers and soft-drugs" sense, but also in the "golly gee they believe in a moderate government that gives everyone great healthcare, scaled taxes and looks after the old, sick, drug addicted and poor" kind of way. Kind of a lefty utopia, even though I'm assured that there's plenty of right-wiongv tendancies under the surface. Imagine perth but with legalized drugs. Shit, I just described the WAPA utopia. Still I'm not here long enough to find out. Off to rock im ring in germany this weekend. Not going to post a lineup because a)you can look it up for yourselves and b) If I do Erin will have another coniption and I'll get abusive SMS messages for days. Needless to say should be fun. All this perth blog talk is making me miss you guys. Coming home in about 4 weeks, so keep a few beers on ice for then. love to all

 aggggghhhh I hate my computer and its stooopid virus!!! Anyways, after watching last night's rage it dawned on me how incredibly lame Sydney is... I mean how many good bands have they produced in the last say... 3 years? Besides Youth Group ? If anyone suggests the Vines I'll remind you that I said GOOD bands.... huh? huh? None. That's right. Then another thing dawned on me, the only good music in this country, is comin outta Melbourne or Perth. And thats just bizarre. ... let me just back that up: Melbourne: Jet Ground Components Riff Random British India Spazzys etc etc etc Perth: Eskimo Joe Sleepy Jackson Little Birdy (ggrrrr even though i hate them) Gyroscope (even though I hate them too) ehhhh Perth Rock City Anyways, I'm proud to say that I've, at one stage, made both of these wonderful towns my home..... sigh..... In other news Franz Ferdinand are hosting Rage tonight! whoo hoo!!!!!

 and now its time for my favourite part of the week: SEARCHTERMS OF THE WEEK yes welcome back to the lighthearted segment where&nbsp;I expose what wierdos have been Google searching for to somehow arrive at this site: 1. 'penis of nick lachay' 2. 'download malta 2003 eurovision performance' 3. 'interpol groupie stories' 4. 'lyrics by emmanuel carella' (now thats funny) 5. 'NON-NUDE pictures of Kathy Griffen' (ahahahahaahahaha) 6. 'spectettes' (!!!!!!) 7. 'chicken heading sex' 8. 'female infaticide' 9. 'Kylie Minogue Street Fighter' 10. 'Gretel Killeen nude' *shudder*

 Indeed. Franz Ferdinand certainly have blessed us with their kick-ass, action packed live show. Let us all bask in the golden light that miraculously shines&nbsp;from their remarkably unfashionable 1980s haircuts and superb guitar-dance moves! Oh what a night.... the music and heat stifling every breath of fresh air in the house ... the crowd: a ferocious ocean swaying, jumping, gulping down its victims as they stretched out to touch those almighty sexy Scotsmen............ the kinship amongst audience members as they made room for their lungs to expand enough to&nbsp;shout out lines like "you're sexy, I'm sexy, so come and dance with me Michael" and going absolutely spastic whilst screaming 'THIS FIRE IS OUTTA CONTROL! I'M GONNA BURN THIS CITY!"... that random dude lifting me up to surf over the crowd proclaiming my longing to have sex with the bass player ............. ahhhhhhhhhhhh...... sigh..... fun times... and many more fun times ahead......... Datsuns!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SO EXCITED!

 Today i have only 6 words...... &nbsp; Franz Ferdinand have rocked my world &nbsp; I'll leave the report to Erin as the sound of the keys is making my head hurt. &nbsp; sorry, so that was 36 words, including these ones..... &nbsp; : ) &nbsp;

 I'm really concerned about this Sony/BMG merge, its becoming dangerously clear that we're one step closer to the concept of 'THE Record Company' wherein all majors will have merged to collectively sack thousands of people and use their monopoly to further rip-off the artists. It is kind of a strange merge though, I mean, I always thought of Sony as a cold, heartless money-making machine, not concerned with the welfare/longevity of the artist, whereas BMG seem more Artist oriented... Maybe I've just been brainwashed by Australian Idol. But what has emerged as a more hilarious strategy to combat&nbsp; downloading and its threat to Record Companies, is BMG have come up with the ridiculous concept of selling High, Mid and Low price versions of the same CD. 'High' have all the pretty artwork that people&nbsp;pay to get and Low having absolutely no artwork at all. HELLO!!!!???? That is the most fuckin stupid thing I've ever heard!!! A) As if anyone is gonna pay $14 dollars for a CD (specifically from BMG) without artwork when they could much more conveniently download for the same or even lower price (if legal at all). B) what&nbsp;Artist is gonna want their product sold for $14 looking like shit, stripping them of artistic integrity&nbsp;and blatantly exposing them solely as a 'product' for shipping and sales?&nbsp; C) people only BUY CDs these day for the artwork so it won't make a shit of difference!&nbsp; grrrrrrrrrrr.... its obviously monday.............&nbsp;

 wassup. so its been a little while since the last post, mainly because I've been driven out of my house since my mother's brilliant idea of have the whole fucking carpet dyed a different colour!! and now it stinks like wet dog. Indie was good on Thursday, I'm glad to see Avenza have improved immensely since last time I saw them. Seeing Pixelated for the first time was also rather interesting. As it is a running joke in my class that if you wanna bag somebody you say they love Pixelated and have a Pixelated tattoo on their arse. However I am OUTRAGED that the Beings are not playing at the Best Of Indie in August, Neil's excuse for this: they're playing a gig at Revolver the week before.... thats outrageous!!! Durrrrr.... they're only like the best Melbourne band like.... ever! Meanwhile.... won't be drinking Scotch Love for a while as I spent all of Friday throwing up/feeling dead/drunk/half a person. Can't really think right now so I'm gonna break it down again: Really Diggin: Freshly made quater pounders Southbank $10 CD shop (my eternal downfall) the Police (" Sting is a real hero of mine, the music he makes, not that I really listen to it, but the fact that he's making it, I respect that") The Astor Spiderman, Spiderman, Does whatever a Spider can! Really Not Diggin: Scotch Hungry Jacks Double Delish (it had so much promise) Spewin the Smell of my House!!! Pony closing at 1am on Thurday nights.

 Well hi to all.&nbsp; Thought I would post seeing as I haven't in a while, although I don't have a whole lot to say!&nbsp; Went to Rove on Tuesday and got a good glimpse of Franz Ferdinand...Love, love, love them...So good.&nbsp; Once again laughed my tits off during the entire show, there's somethin about that damn studio that makes me giggle like I did when I was 10 and in church and not aloud to be laughing!!!&nbsp; In fact I think I have some kind of problem with laughing...Its out of control these days, once I start I just cant stop.&nbsp; Erin can vouch for this...I think I really scared her last night when I began insanely laughing and could not stop for no apparent reason.&nbsp; And the night before I was supposedly laughing in my sleep and woke her up!!!&nbsp;Better than crying I suppose. Not working a whole lot...It seems the fume factory have abandoned me, so looking for a new job...Anyone know of anything?&nbsp; Somehow though, after not working for a month, I have saved enough money to pay my rent this month.&nbsp; Wonders will never cease...And my mum will be happy that I'm not sneakin into her netbank and transferring moola across to my account! On another note, if anyone is looking for some light entertainment this evening, come down to indie initiative at revolver.&nbsp; I'm not referring to the live music, but rather my hilarious love life.&nbsp; It seems that every person I've "shared a moment" with since moving to Melbourne (a whopping 5 lucky people, and I'm not talking about shags...Mostly...Just dirty pashes) is going to be there.&nbsp; Should be interesting, and in the general pattern of my romantic life, fucking hilarious. Anyway, that is all.... Bye now x

 CURSES! My fuckin doctor refuses to prescribe me any more Stilnox, coz she's thinks I'm all 'addicted to it' or some shite, so now I'm down to my last 25 tabs of Temaze (coz she won't prescribe me any more of that either) and I hate Temaze it doesn't knock me out like Stilnox it just makes me sleep deeper and longer once I actually get to sleep. So all this means is the insomnia is back in town, and I'm double tired when I have to get up coz I've only been asleep for like 3 hours and the Temaze makes me wanna sleep longer. So for the first half f the day I'm completely out of it so I have to use Mark as a prop to keep me upright during class, to which the&nbsp;extraordinarily immature people in my class make wedding jokes about....... grrrr....... thats my beef for the day.... time for a siesta....

 ooooooooohhhh I love PJ Harvey soooooo much.... she's like the definition of sexy rock chick... nobody even comes close to comparing........ love her, just love her. &nbsp; AS you can probably tell, I'm enjoying my new purchases immensely, in fact they're the only thing that's getting me through the nightmare of my current painting...... agggggh!!! Its so shit I can't handle it, that chainsaw is lying dangerously close to it..... If only it didn't cost me so much then I probably would hack it up! &nbsp; Am really intrigued to know who this secret admirer is..... I hope a random comes up and buys me a scotch this week, that'll be so funny! Meanwhile, the shittest bands ever are playing so I doubt anyone will be there..

 ahhahahahaahahahahahaaa I was just checkin out the Indie Initiative Forum, to see what people could possibly be talking about there, and found urlLink this ....... ah ha ha hahahahahahahahahahahaa That sounds like something I would write myself! ahahahahaha I really wanna reply... myyehhh can't be bothered signing up..... It better be a hot BOY though...

 Oh yeah... I reluctantly Dj'd Revolver last night, (when I reeeeally wanted to go with Elanor to Die! Die! Die! ) Um yeah Indie Initiative... its getting down to the wire... only a couple more weeks till the big BEST OF showcase in August. Now that will be a really good gig. Last night.... &nbsp; The Vasco Era - DO beleive the hype. These kids were fuckin wicked! At first I was sceptical, as I always am when people hype up bands to me, but fuck! WOW! They didn't win Pushover for nothin folks! I highly recommend you go out and see them, very very talented guys. (they'll be back for the BEST OF) &nbsp; Quarterlife Crisis - Great name, not so great band. Don't get me wrong, they&nbsp;were great at what they did ... wishy washy melodic triple m ballad rock... not my cup of tea but a very polite bunch of boys.&nbsp; &nbsp; Zoophyte - I can't believe I dug a band with a didge. Maybe I'd had a few too many scotch loves but these guys were actually pretty cool, even though the singer thought he was Brandon from Incubus. I mean, they didn't quite excite me, but they certainly interested me.

 OOOHHHHH Go Blogger with the new font and colour system!!! Lovin IT!! &nbsp; I just did something amazing...... I bought CDs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! amazing........ No, you don't understand, I haven't been able to do that for like 6 months! Finally I get a little bit of cash and go crazy....wel not really. After walking around JB with a shortlist of around 15 albums in my hand, I eventually narrowed it down to the following: &nbsp; PJ Harvey - Uh Huh Her

 MY MEMOIRS A Tale of Summer Past Crackers has requested that I write a little summary of what we did last Summer. Just to look back and have a little chuckle over. So here we go, gonna have to do this in point form of the things I remember most clearly: - Day ONE: The Big Day Out, where I met Crackers for the first time. I remember sitting there whilst he Andrew were mumbling something towards each other then suddenly Furze goes "Gee Erin, you don't like Cocaine do you?" I reply in mega sarcastic monotone "No Andrew, Cocaine is not my favourite drug of all time" And it was all downhill from there. Best Big Day Out ever. - Getting a driver to pick us up from the Big Day Out! The most outrageous thing I had ever done at that point - Convincing Benno to come to Revolver by promising him a dirty pash - Grove driving us to HiFi for Muse the next night, completely out of heads. Me freakin out looking at Furze whilst Crackers talks business with various huge Industry people. - Having an orgasm during the concert, then freaking out when the guy next to me has an epileptic fit. - Blurting out my favourite line whilst wasted "I wanna trash a hotel room!!!!" and Crackers replying to my surprise "yeah Let's do it!" .... so we did - Furze cracking it at the Westin reception for not giving us good porn ... on time - Me being ultra pissed off, having to DJ RockRoom whilst furze and Crackers are at the Strokes, they come in off their face of course and do lines behind the dj booth. (JUST OCCURRED TO ME I HAVEN'T GOT OUT OF THE FIRST WEEK YET!!) - Julian Casablancas cracking the shits and storming out of the Marriott hotel he he he so funny - Various nights out with Grove the Driver to Honky Tonks, Cherry, Pony, Ding Dong etc lots of expensive champagne and drugs flying around. - My Birthday party which was just tooooo outta control for words!! But I'd have to say my all time favourite memory f the extravagance of summer is: Poodle sitting in a massive suite at the Westin Hotel, in a hotel bath robe, stubbing out her cigarette in a Pringles container, then freaking out coz it wouldn't go out. Furze's solution: pour a bottle of Moet into it. Hilarious. The End .... or is it?

 Meanwhile I am SO PISSED OFF!!! Muse are playing at Festival Hall. Why oh WHY must another awesome concert be ruinned by this terrible VENUE??? What are people thinking?? Perfect venue for Muse = the Forum!!! IDIOTS!!!!

 Am I turning EMO? Its been a long running joke in my class to tease people for being Emo. Whenever the guys say something to suggest they're little more sensitive than your average 'hardcore/strait-edge/metal/punk' taunts of 'Emo! Emo! Emo!' are thrown accross the room. Such is life in the School of Rock. But regardless of what shit I may get for it, I've found myself slipping into Emo life. I'm wearing my glasses more often than I really should, wearing a lot of stripey scarves and re-realising the brilliance of Ben Kweller's 'Sha Sha' album. Hopefully this is where it ends. I pray god I don't end up crying over an accoustic guitar listening to Dashboard Confessional . Then I really would be on the lower end of the music industry class food chain. Its such a funny phenomonon, Emo's been around for a pretty long time and people are only naming it now and fitting a uniform for it. Its getting a little difficult to write any more on this subject as my stereo has just changed discs to Gerling, its screwing up my thoughts on the matter. ps- hi Tiff! good to have ya back!

 hello All!!!!! i hope this is'nt too much of a shock me finally writting another entry on the blog! Erin that would be pure gold if you went on BIg brother!!im in monkey mia atm, with the family! i donno still how i survived the car trip... sitting in the midde seat ollie to one side and his friend to the other!!! very very very painful experience, still asking myself if being here is worth all the stress i went through on teh way up. let you know at the end of the trip the reason why im blogging is not actually to winge was just to pop in and tell you guys how much i miss you are VERY well and happy my time is up on the net so gonna love ya and leave ya

 I just got all nostalgic.... goes through archives again... Shayne you used to write the most amazing posts, they were so full of life and you had so many funny things to say that make me chuckle out loud... please come back to the blog... you have a cool new computer and all... you could tell everyone about cows! And Furze you too! Just coz you're in amazing cities doesn't mean you can slack off. I miss having the blog the way it used to be..... sigh.

 Yo. - I've had a disturbing amount of people suggest that I audition for next year's Big Brother . Why? I don't think I'd be that intertesting to watch on an every day basis, and plus I'd be the totally non-blonde, non-beach, non-queensland, non-pink clothes, non-good looks that everyone evicts in the first couple of weeks. Plus there aint no way I'm EVER wearing a bikini /nor going nude so you can count me out peoples! - Loving Australian Idol being back, but majorly embarrassed at the amount of shit Melbourne churned out for the first auditions. Meanwhile Dicko remains oddly attractive..... - CAN'T BELIEVE 'THE PRICE IS RIGHT' IS FILMED IN MELBOURNE AND NOBODY TOLD ME! I'm totally going! So excited! mental note - wear a good bra. - I'm DJing Revolver again this week kids so come on down Thursday for the following bandy treats: Vasco Era, Quarterlife Crisis and Zoophyte (meanwhile I'm gonna try n' leave early to get to Pony in time for Die! Die! Die!)

 Ok, now I'm really taking advantage of Picasa being online again, I've wanted to post photos for so long! .... mmmm vince noir.... &nbsp; urlLink urlLink

 ehhhh.... its my dog looking so cute...&nbsp; urlLink urlLink

 hilarious! Everyone jumping for joy outside of Rose Portius' house&nbsp; urlLink urlLink

 Some days, in fact most days, I wonder why I bother going to school. I mean today was a classic example of what a shambles my course really is. And considering my last course was a shambles as well I think it just has something to do with Tafe really being as slack as its reputation. Today we had nothing to do for an hour because our lecturers didn't bother thinking up anything to teach us, so we went for a cruise around Collingwood trying to find a Club X so that I could prove to Kate that 3-way Dildos exist. We came back and the other half of the class was watching Oprah in the Classroom, for like an hour. Then our Lecturer finally rocks up and goes, "ok let's start a new Module, who can tell me what a band Manager does?"(!!!!) My jaw dropped. I couldn't believe he was being serious. Then he went on to ask equally as challenging questions like "What does Marketable mean?" WHAT AM I DOING HERE? THIS IS SUCH A RIDICULOUS WASTE OF TIME!!!

 very fragile Ok so I feel like my brain has been replaced by some kind of bubble bath foam. Can't process anything. I know I've said this before, but this is official: I have never EVER been so fucked in my life. NOBODY in the WORLD has ever been as fucked as I was on Saturday night. And I have one person to thank: Crackarini. He has demanded me to give a full report, but to be honest I really can't remember much at all. I can only remember snapshots, they're like little photographs in my head. Here's what I remember: - scotch love - lots of substances - the house of crackerini - drag queens - finding the only gay guy who likes muse - sitting on the floor in the toilets, talking on mobile to andrew, when I see my phone bill I am going to die - blatant name dropping to get into the MARKET! (gay club for those who don't know) - looking for a guy to set up with the boys and managing to talk to the only strait guy in there - smoking a joint at 8am - really yummy salad the next day Here's what I've been told (and can't remember any of): - there wasn't a second when I didn't have a scotch love in my hand until around 7am - I was talking to ugly guys - the entire gay scene in Melbourne has my phone number - I was found throwing up into the men's urinal at the market, standing up, next to guys taking a slash (didn't want to admit that but it has to be said) - couldn't find the stairs - passed out in the cab - Kim wanted to leave me in the gutter - spewed into a bucket when we got home There its been said, now lets never speak of it again. Fuckin great night though, loved ever second of it! thanks crackers!

 after spending my mid-morning yesterday with leon creating little teal green cushions for his new lounge setting we decided to have perth-a-nality catch up..... so for those who are interested and live in the state we were thinking dinner at red orchid wednesday night.......... any comments or acceptances welcome on this blog or to either of our mobiles/ email/ fax machines or paging systems.

 Ez, after the barrage of abuse I received after admitting my passion for Big Brother, I can't believe you have backflipped!!! In true Erin style!! Now the series is "interesting"... outrageous maybe we will have to have eviction nite parties and what not, as I have always been an "open" fan of big brother (even when it is not uber cool) he he later PS, info for all- am now officially back home, the dream is over, and romanitc idea of living with my parents is quickly fading into long internet sessions and lockup time in my room!

 I'm really quite proud of myself. Last night I managed to thoroughly entertain myself without spending money and without getting drunk. I owe it all to an awesome LP video I found with the following on it: Standing In the Shadows of Motown Sweet Home Alabama The Laramie Project Iris Followed by a healthy dose of 3 hours of Rage which I might add was sensational. Highlights: the cure, the veils, the hives, butterfingers, and the killers. Now I'm gonna go eat my multi-award winning sandwich* and watch my illegal dvds of Spiderman and Spiderman 2 (I mean, they're not mine) * disclaimer : the awards mentioned were presented by me to me, in my kitchen, 20 mins ago. The sandwich in question was awarded the following: - best new comer - most outstanding performance in a sandwich plus - Diet Dijonnaise was awarded best performance in a supporting role.

 The Mono nerds tell me that Melbourne has an awesome new plush rockbar called Moser, its opposite KFC on Chapel St (whoo-hoo! my side of the river!) and get this......... opening hours: FRIDAY and SATURDAY 12am - 8am (!!!!!!!!!!!!!) I like those odds.

 SO EXCITED!!! Finally an awesome band worthy of buzz So me and Poodle are sitting in the DJ booth waitin to start, when this typical Emo kid (including classic fake black frame glasses) comes up and says 'Hello', so I say 'Hi', just then one of the badges drops off his jumper, (I presumed it was a Get Up Kids or Dashboard badge) he awkwardly picks it up, says 'sorry' and scuttles off. So me and Poodle have a little giggle about this. Meanwhile, about an hour later HE'S ON STAGE, fronting one of the most kick-ass and exciting bands I have seen in a long time. He's jumping around like a maniac, screaming into whatever mic was working, getting tangled in leads, jumping off the stage, falling over, yelling away to some of the tightest, awesome punk/rock/I dunno what, songs I've heard. The music was just like a fantastic conglomeration of divine screeching, driving and powerful sounds, using vocals as a more confronting instrument than a rockin guitar. They're called Die, Die, Die And they're from New Zealand and they're doin some gigs around town for the next couple of days, think they're at the Tote tonight. If you like music, and you think you're down with the kids, well you're not until you've seen this band. Its simply something you MUST do before you die ..... die, die

 It kinda disturbs me that by using Blogpatrol, I can find out almost everything about anyone who views this site, what they searched for, where they were referred from (yahoo, other blogs etc), what operating system they used (Windows xp, macintosh etc), what browser (explorer, navigator etc), their screen resolution !!! (1024x768 etc), their internet/computer ID, even their colour level (32 bit etc)........... so basically I know everything about you! YEAH YOU! hehehehehehehehe.... wait.... this means other people know all about me, and possibly more coz their smarter than me, and have better, more advanced programs than crappy old free blogpatrol........ ehhhhhhh BIG BROTHER!!!! Meanwhile, speaking of Big Brother , is it just me or is the series actually interesting to watch this year? Or am I just really bored. I dunno, its not like they're doing anything exciting in the house, or anything at all for that matter, but I've found myself really enjoying watching the people who are left in there. I think I really like em all, even Paul's growing on me! and I don't give crap about Wesley, I mean sure he's boring, which is cool because it means we don't have to see him! I'm scaring myself here. abort. ps- come to revolver tonight!

 ERIN'S GIG RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE WEEK: Thursday: Come hang with me at Indie Initiative@Revolver as I shall be djing and there are some cool bands a-playin: Silence Means Everything, the Secrets and Die, Die, Die Saturday: Kelis @ Metro Sunday: The Roys @ Espy 5:30pm (they're fuckin cool)

 'Maybe I'll Go Blind' Search Terms of the week: Porn Clerk Diaries Cabaret Slut Money Diva Wanking infront of Mum Prague Kiddy Stroll Leon's Lounge HEHEHEHEHE people will never cease to amuse me.

 I've rediscovered the wonderful world of Trivia Nights !!! So much fun! Man I knew there must be more things to do in the world that are both fun and free. Even though our team didn't win over-all we got a few individual prizes, I personally won the 'Battle of the Sexes' sidegame which won me a free pot! yeah! What's really funny is quickly knowing exactly who to phone to get what answer (cheating basically, everybody does it!) I'd like to thank Laurie for letting me know Passions is on channel 7, Poodle for having the Dirty Dancing soundtrack on hand to let me know who sang Big Girls Don't Cry , and my dad for last year's Melbourne Cup Winner. Of course it was truly my time to shine with the question: "Name this song, the artist covering it, and the original artist" Within literally 1 second of the intro, I flung myself across the table grabbed the pen and scribbled: "Bizarre Love Triangle, Frente, New Order" AHHHH if ever there was a question for me, truly that was it. good times, good times.

 how come no-one blogs anymore.....apart from of course you erin, think if you were away from a computar for more than 24 hrs it would be like disabling the life - support from your body. anyway perth is overcast and rainy, no more tropical cocktails for us until winter passes in probably about a week. Myself i have been celebrating the end of my first financial year, just getting down with the accountants and tax collectors....no not really, and also celebrating the regaining of feeling to the left side of my face after the removal of my teeth ten days ago. so yep that is pretty much my week in summation. riveting i know. Went to dinner with some girls from school i hadnt seen in over two years on saturday, which was to say the least interesting. probably more for me than for any of you so i won't expand. just wanted to make it sound like i had stepped out of my house in the last week. ps my house is having a new kitchen put in, and has rekindled my number one hate in life - demolition noise and dust and not being able to find anything or eat anything or...........that's it im going out for breakfast - bye.

 Well I really have no excuse not to blog now, as I am currently typing this blog on my brand new, blisteringly fast and powerful Macintosh Powerbook... But in light of the fact that Marlon Brando has died, I will refrain from saying toomuch for now and resume my silent vigil for one of the greatest actors (and eaters) in the history of the craft. Marlon Brando, we respect you...

 As I haven't been doing anything but laying on the couch coughing up chunky custard, as my lecturer Graham would put it, there isn't that much to write. Except for the fact that I can't believe Jack Black plays Sean Penn's brother in Dead Man Walking, I never realised that before. I love Sean Penn , there's something so oddly attractive about him, especially in that role, ehhh I'm a sucker for criminals. Just about to attempt the biggest canvass.... I'm freaking out! I'm totally not convinced of what I'm putting on it so I think I'll avoid it for a while.... Meanwhile.... getting well sick of Melbourne, everyone's in such cool places, Prue - Thailand, Kate - Paris, Furze - Who knows? with all their cool stories and new found excitement for life, that's what I need, I need something different to remind me of how cool the world can be. Because I'm becommiing bored with my outlets to it, like music, t.v, internet, books, nothing holds my attention anymore, nothing compares to feeling it with your human senses. mmmmmmmyyyyyyyeeeehhhh. Never gonna happen, god I complain a lot.

 Jees.... Its nice to see nothing's freakin changed around here! Furze what happened to you being the foreign correspondent on this here blog? Or have you sunk into London/Greece extravagance? Meanwhile, I've lost my voice due to a ripper cold/shoreham country air/ too many cigarettes. My voice is now at that weird 'speaking in fragments' phase so that you only actually hear 2 fifths of every word I say. Its kinda cool, even though I sound like a demented drag queen fem-bot. Weekend report: Thursday: Indie Initiative shithouse ska bands, then to Pony lots of Scotch Love and drunkenness Friday: Rescue Poodle from strange Italian guy's house where she ended up on Thursday night, then escape to Shoreham with Guy for Project: Evil Angels (ps - guy, read the herald-sun today!) Saturday: Attend brother's lame party, then escape to Chapel st. where couldn't get in anywhere decent coz had no money Sunday: today. sick. nothin. myehhh. Currently debating whether to include photo on Blogger profile or remain anonymous

 UH OH! I almost spent all my Grant Money at JB HiFi before the cheque has even cleared!! But I did get some frickin awesome CDs: Happy Mondays - Greatest Hits

 Firstly, AMY: so sorry didn't make t to drinks last night, I stupidly set my phone reminder memo to go off at the actual time the drinks started, and by that time I was too drunk to go anywhere! But Happy Birthday!!! Anyways, my greatest accomplishment ever is complete: ROCK WHO? Translation: I've taken my old Guess Who? game and replaced all the faces with photos of Rock Stars, thus making hella more fun. You can ask questions like: Are you a sad old fuck still pushing your career? yes Are you Iggy Pop? yes or Have you been banned from one or more airlines? yes Are you smoking a cigarette in your photo? yes Are you Liam Gallagher? yes Ahhhh its endless hours of fun! I love it! In other news, for some fucked up reason, I have been employed my Myer, thant's right, I'll be one of the women in black with flawless make-up and silver jewellery looking at you as if you're too dirty to enter the store.... ah how the tables have turned. In more news, everyone come to Revolver for the Beings tonight.

 ok so i havent blogged in about a century but since all the old folk ie you shayne seem to be coming out of the woodwork i decided i would too. so i'll begin with a gripe. saturday night was my sister's 21st, we had a bash at ours, for those lucky enough to be present at my special day it was along the same lines. sit down dinner for about 75.....event styling by myself obviously. anyway went up to my room at end of the evening around 1am to get my bag and jacket etc to go out on the town when i find my mobile missing from next to my bed. so yes folks i was robbed by one of my sister's fucked up friends in my own house, while my parents paid for this thief to eat a three course meal and drink their booze. i was violated. was a three week old phone and now i got to buy it again. in a word it is bullshit. so in summation if anyone thinks i am avoiding them it is because i now have about 3 numbers in my phone book. other news, so many desserts left over from the party i am now in the process of disposing of them via consumption, mmmmmm. yay miranda back in the design world where you rightfully belong, someone to hold that withering torch. will be back with another update in about three months, mery christmas if i miss it. The Spanner.

 i spelt comment wrong...

 puke!!!!! grosss!!!! ewwww thats is so fucked up!!! A woman just came into my shop wearing a long sleeved shirt that's denim on the front (sleeves and all) and beige woolen knit on the back. Like 50/50... It's the kinda shirt that I'll lose sleep over it's so wrong. She was russian... ... and I'm reasonably sure her husband would have killed a few people at some point in his life. So I decided not to coment... To close I would like to share the final sentence from the Directors notes featured in the programme of the show I am working on at the moment. "May we use this musical tonight to reinvest our faith in the artless verve and optimism of the new generation, both on and off the stage." WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT SHIT!!??? It's like the funniest thing I have ever seen in a programme. It's great to blog again!! Welcome home Furze! I love you Poodles! nuff said

 hee hee hee heee...i have a weird giggling feeling...as a result of the weekend im sure...but i keep laughing about silly things in public places..like on the tram/train in peak hour, when your face is so close to someone else's that you cant possibly hide the fact you're laughing, and they either think you're a raving lunatic or laughing at them. Today all i could think about was our friend Marnie walking around Munich in a sheet with a zebra print belt around her waist, and consequently violently giggling. I happened to be in meetings and costume fittings all day...so i'm sure i came across very professionally! I also managed once again to become preoccupied with my mobile and get on the wrong tram...then looking up after 10-15mins and thinking"where am i?"...then insanely laughing infront of everyone on the platform. OK enough on how daft i am. Big call out to Craig to say thanks for a great weekend...and Furze...nice to see you returned the same silly fella that you left as! eeehhhh, we all bring out the stupidity in each other and its AMAZING!! Interesting fact: It apparently takes 68 weeks to train a train driver...and as my gorgeous housey chris stated..."they don't even have to steer!!" Bye now xo

 oh yeah i forgot its wednesday! SEARCHTERMS OF THE WEEK: What have freaks searched for this week, kids? 1. 'Pixelated tattoo' (ahhh hahahahaha that has to be someone from class!) 2. 'Fun with Zanax' 3. 'How to get a body like Nick Lachay' 4. 'Chlorophormed sex pictures' 5. 'Scientology Tehan' 6. 'the cure robert smith photos sexy' (I'm not alone!) 7. 'Fucked Up Blind Kids' (what the?) 8. 'Delta Goodrem on the cover of a magazine wearing red' 9. 'Clem Bastow rocks it' (that was totally her.... loser) 10. 'date soho january boyfriend date surprise' (don't you know I'm loco?)

 Ok Crackers (or anyone else willing to donate tix to yer ol' pleb pal Erin), you said to write a gig wishlist, so here goes. Please note tickets to any of these may cause me to collapse with a spontaneous orgasm: Muse the Datsuns Supergrass Eskimo Joe Cut Copy There I'm done. Man, that's a cool month in gigs. AAAAAAAAAAAnywho.... We had our 'Open Day' today for NMIT, for some reason it was held at Darebin Arts Center in like Preston or something... twas the most hideous day ever. Ok so I only had to be there for an hour and sit behind a desk looking surly enough as to scare kids away from asking me questions. But EW! (at risk of sounding like mega snob) skanky highschool chicks are sooooooooooo disgusting!! where the hell did these kids come from?? and where the hell are they going with their lives? Like, they were only there because it was compulsory for them to ask about a certain amount of courses, write down the answers and then spend the rest of the time smoking out the front or taking advantage of the Hairdressing Course stall, where they could get their hair straightened before hangin at a shopping mall. The hairdressing stall was rather tempting, I tried to hold Kate back from asking for a free haircut, as I feared she'd return with ghetto hair and lose her whole Indie Pop thang. Oh well, each to their own, I was just hopin for some rockin kids to mould, but alas, Preston aint the rock capital of the world. Aint that the truth.

 That's right, I'll be DJing the FRIDAY night with performances by British India, A Ghost Devotion (pictured here), Avenza and the Pranks, and SATURDAY night will be the Vasco Era, Zoophyte, The Roys (pictured below) and Quaterlife Crisis. So come on down August 20+21, both nights shall be very entertaining, showcasing some of the best bands in Melbourne&nbsp; urlLink urlLink

 Pleased to announce the final lineup for REVOLUTION 2004, the best of Indie Initiative has been announced. &nbsp; urlLink urlLink

 STILL BREATHING .... Miyah, so its been a fairly full on weekend, what with the return of Furze et al. I have only just grown back enough braincells to realise what a wanker I was being, talking so so so so much shit to so so so many randoms. Somebody must restrain me next time, keep me a fair distance from any drugs, otherwise there'll be no stoppin me. Meanwhile I realised this afternoon that I went to the Libertines at the Corner last night! And they fuckin rocked! Furzikins and I scored some tix at the last minute. Yeah man!! I mean yeah, I was the one saying 'Derrrr....like who the hell wants to see the Libertines without Pete in the band' but they were very very impressive. At least I thought they were in my state of mind, even though i spent most of the time talking shit by the bar. Tad pissed off I didn't realise the Pictures were supporting until we walked in and they were playing their last song. Of course the urlLink coolest person in the world was there, and I'm sure her review captures extactly what I would have felt for the gig if I had the energy!

 EHH ...THE KWELLER ... SO COOL Yes indeedy, its official, Ben Kweller is one of the most rockin dudes currently gracing the planet. Just so damn with it man, the swagger out to the stage the slow drawl-too-cool newyork-i'm-really-out-of-it accent. Red and black checked hunting shirt tucked tightly into baby blue jeans with a white belt, the man has got it goin on, and boy can he rock out!! Highlights include 'Wasted and Ready' 'On My Way' 'Ann Disaster' and of course 'The Rules', ehhhh I'm such a singles slut. Meanwhile Smallgoods supported, yeah they're ok, but I really don't dig em that much, everytime I see them its as if they've dug out another of their parents Kinks LPs and stumbled through the chords, making up a new tune by default. Meanwhile the Emo factor was outta control, even though I totally looked like one of the crowd wearing my dark frame glasses, striped top and angular haircut. Ehhhh Emo.... will never cease to amuse me. What was also rockin last night was Flipside @ Republika , man I have gots to DJ there, every song is like the soundtrack to my life, had lots of Perth flashbacks hearing tunes like Tears for Fears 'Mad World' and Echo &amp; the Bunnymen 'the Cutter'........sigh... memories....

 GOOD: Hannah's Dad (cheers Muzza!) Nasi Goreng My new stereo Modest Mouse album Ben Kweller tonight My new White Stripes vinyl!!! BAD: my broken record player my gut my TAFE Immature people the fact I still haven't booked the gallery!!!

 WHOO HOO!!!! I GOT A BEN KWELLER TICKET! I GOT A BEN KWELLER TICKET! I GOT A BEN KWELLER TICKET! YAY! AND ALL FOR FREE!!! FREE!!!!!!!!!! (thanks kate!!) ehhhhh i love my life sometimes...

 CAN EVERYBODY READING THIS PLEASE urlLink CLICK HERE: AND BACK UP MY VOTE TO HAVE THE BEINGS PLAY INDIE INITIATIVE BEST OF??? PLEASE!!!? I'M SERIOUS, DO IT NOW!

 Oh yeah! Its Wednesday! That means its time for my fav segment: SEARCHTERMS OF THE WEEK! Where I reveal what wierdos have google searched for and ended up here: 1. 'jerking off to bec cartwright' 2. 'fuck off i'm mixing' 3. 'erin buntine' (stalker!!) 4. 'ooooooh oooooohhh oooooohhhh' 5. 'cause i'm the best fuck that you ever had' 6. 'photos of full brazilian waxing for men' 7. 'andrew is a cockface' (ahhahahahahahaha) 8. 'pringles julian casablancas' 9. 'Mc Leod's Daughters' THAT'S IT YOU FREAKS! AND I KNOW THERE'LL BE ANOTHER 10 OF YOU TODAY, STOP OBSESSING OVER McCLOUDS FUCKING DAUGHTERS! ITS SHIT! GET A LIFE!!!!

 OUCH! IT TASTES LIKE ... BURNING!!! (I just ate really yummy curry.... damn that burning aftertaste) ANYWHO.... Its good to see Furze back on the blog, and almost back on the scene, I hope you're aware that you'll be granted absolutely no jet-lag recovery time, coz the minute you step off the plane its party party party!!! Hey and speaking of being back on da blog SHAYNE! quit lurking in the comments and show your face on the homepage you bi-atch, and also, hurry up and get yo' ass to Melb town! Its almost party season! ......... sob sob ..... i miss you so.... (ps - Poo-Poo-Poodle, sorry for raining on your fete.) Anyways, looks like I'll hopefully be spending all of September at the Forum (sigh.... my fav venue.... if only Muse were playing there .... if only Lees and West cared about their audience's experience) i.e Datsuns, Supergrass, Eskimo Joe w/ Dogs Die In Hot Cars ................ that is, if I miraculously get free tickets to these gigs................ *blink blink* Speaking of gigs......... sob sob..... the Streets tonight.............. BEN KWELLER TOMORROW!!!! ... sigh.... Man, I seriously am the most pathetic person in the world when I can't afford $35 to go to a gig......... let alone $11 to go to The Astor double on Friday (Eternal Sunshine/Girl With Pearl Earing) As my brother told me the other day: .... "[I'm] such an angry person"

 I got a JOB!!?!?!?!?!?!?!!? A design job that is.... Finally, a legitimate gig, even though it is profit share for an independant theatre company, so i may be lucky to receive about $2.00 payment for 2 months work, it still counts! So thank-you, thank-you everybody...i'm currently taking a bow... If it looks like it's gonna turn out ok, the few melbournites i know must come and see. Think it opens mid oct, i'll let y'all know... P.S. HAPPY B'DAY MARTY !!!(for yesterday) xoxoxoxoxo

 yeah, well given that I haven't posted in nearly three or four weeks you could say that, technically, it's time to post. I'm in New york, why? because I fell in love with the place and, knowing that I wouldn't be back O/S for ever and a day I had to make one final pitstop on my home. And it's been pretty worth it I can tell you. Booya! Like, just amazing. It's just the little things that make New york such a great darn city. Like the pizza, and the cool little deli's on every corner, and the Interpol/Cure/Muse concerts. And the people you meet really make the place too. Like Gino, the guy who owns the porn store down below the apartment I'm in. Or Sandra who will play chess against you in the park and beat you, as long as you part with a fiver. And Robert Smith, the slightly portly lead singer of the Cure, who was kind enough to interrupt his conversation with matt belamy long enough to give me the time of day at some party on saturday night. Little things like that really make this city just swell. Can't get enough of it. Don't really want to leave. (sigh) I could really wax lyrical for hours but that would be completely boring to anyone who's never been here. Plus I've been really concious that I've only been posting when really good things have happened and I'm desperetly worried that it comes off like gloating. I've actually written some really insightful Bill Bryson-esque travel essays that don't involve meeting rock stars of any description. not sure wether I'm gonna post em here or start another blog. What I do want to do, however, is see my friends. Like Benno. Ever met Benno? (Ben Hynes this is) If you haven't you are definetly missing out because he the topsest bloke on the planet and a loyal friend to boot. I miss this bloke like sleep, partly because he's the greatest guy to hang out with in the world and partly because he knows me nearly better than everyone else (except Erin) which brings me to... Erin. The person who keeps this blog alive. the person who backed me up publicly even when it was unwise or embarrassing to do so. The person I love so much damnit I can't wait to get home. The person who accepts me for my flaws as I accept her for hers. Actually both our flaws incude a tendancy to overindulge in a colourful mixture of drugs and alcohol, which may explain the our mutual forgiveness of each other. also panda I love you, but you knew that already This post may be a shining testament to not posting while trashed but for the greater good, I'm willing to post anyway. See y'all next weekend. The human hurricane is headed back to australia...aiiiyeeeee!!!

 DAMN YOU FRANZ FERDINAND! I feel like my entire list that I had prepared years ago for when I finally get to program rage has been stolen!! finally finished watching my tape of Franz Hosting last night, and every single song was on my list, Not only the bands they chose but even the songs by those bands!! Like who the hell is gonna chose Enjoy The Silence by Depeche Mode except for me??? Obviously Franz. Check it out, as if this list has not been stolen from my 'To Do List Diary': NEW ORDER, THE CURE, DURAN DURAN, THE CLASH, JOY DIVISION, TEARS FOR FEARS, DEPECHE MODE, PULP, SID VICIOUS, MADNESS, THE SMITHS, VELVET UNDERGROUND, DEAD OR ALIVE, ADAM AND THE ANTS, THE STREETS, THE HUMAN LEAGUE.................. it goes on and on !!!! Curses! now I'm gonna have to rewrite my list....

 i bought a mini globe today...as i have been thinking a whole lot lately how great it would be to be an explorer....and decided that i am going to have been on every continent by the time i am thirty. So the saving begins now...after the weekend...as soon as i get a proper job.... .....anyone wanna come? ?

 AAAAAAGHHH I'm so sick of my stupid jaded lecturers trying to crush our optimism! Its our god given right as the youth of today to believe our generation can change the world in some small way. Its increasingly frustrating when we have class after class of middle-aged bitter men saying 'None of the music made today will stand the test of time, nothing which is produced now will ever be re-used in 15 years time' THAT'S ABSOLUTE BULLSHIT!!!! And I'm sick of arguing with them, one in particular who claims he was a child genius (uh-huh thats why you're teaching at NMIT you smug shit), there's no telling him that he's wrong even though its been proven beyond doubt. And I'm sick of arguing with them, they say the most idiotic things like 'all Hip Hop and Rap is disposable bullshit which won't be remembered in a decade's time' to which I respond 'ok what about the Hip Hop which was made over a decade ago that people are still sampling and covering eg Kutis Blow, Run DMC, Sugarhill Gang, Beastie Boys, LL Cool J etc etc etc... just because its not appealing to overweight middle class Asutralian white men, doesn't mean you can ignore an entire way of life and extreme popularity amoungst 20 something black americans which are as far removed from you as possible!!! YOU'RE FULL OF SHIT!!!!" And then he goes 'What I'm talking about is they will never be as recognised as bands like the Stones the Beatles blah blah... you name one band who are selling out major stadium shows today." To this, once again my jaw dropped and I replied "Are you completely ignorant? there are heaps of bands selling out stadiums! and huge venues Muse, Franz Ferdinand, Jet etc etc' errgh. I'm tired of fighting with these stoopid-ass 'teachers' who are constantly revealing that they know less and less about TODAY's music industry, and trying to crush our hopes in the spirit of their own failure. idiots.

 Zippeddy doo dah!!!! I'm so excited... heading off to the not so secret Dallas Crane/You Am I gig tonight @ Dingaz ... yay! (suck on that Furze! You may be at a Muse/Interpol/Cure concert but you're also missing out on Rogers/Crane which you've seen 5 million times!!! so.... ha! ......yeah!!..... ehhhhh ok bite me) Hmmmm methinks there might be more to life than goin to a shitload of gigs, but at the moment I can't really think of what they are... plus I need to save all the pennies i can to buy a DVD player for my room so I can watch Spiderman 24/7, and learn all the words.... Props to Elanor for lending me her super-fantastique CDs.... ehhh Cut Copy are responsible for getting my lard-ass back into the gym, its just so much more enjoyable walking on that treadmill in time to those smooth 80s grooves ... ehhh Cut Copy how I love you.... meanwhile Elanor, Def Leopard went down a treat and you have to come to Cut Copy @ the Corner with us!!!
