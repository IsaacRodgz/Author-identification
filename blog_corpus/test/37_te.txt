 urlLink The Holy Light : "Inside the Holy Sepulchre the Patriarch prays kneeling and reading the special wishes requesting our Lord Jesus Christ to send His Holy Light as a gift of sanctification for the people. And in the absolute quietness at the hour when the patriarch prays a wheeze is heard and almost simultaneously blue and white lightnings of Holy Light penetrate from everywhere, as though millions of photographic flashes turn on embracing the walls and all the lamps light up miraculously. In the Holy Sepulchre the torches the Patriarch holds while he prays turn on also by the Holy Light. The crowd bursts out in cheers while teardrops of joy and faith run from the eyes of the people. For a few minutes the Holy Light doesnt have the attributes of fire. This happens the first minutes after the patriarch comes out of the Holy Sepulchre and gives the Light to the people. Anyone can touch the fire of the 33 candles and he doesnt burn.

 What ever happened to Jubilados? I really wanted to work there someday. urlLink Jubilados starting Permaculture Designed Community and Symposium in New Mexico : Jubilados is a Spanish word referring to those who, having shed their careers, are joyous. Jubilados is a non-profit corporation dedicated to promoting that joyful way of being in the elder years. Jubilados is a non-profit corporation dedicated to contemplative practice, service and ecology. Our educational program includes symposia, focus groups and study groups. As an extension of these educational efforts, a community based on the principles developed in the symposia is being planned. The community will be open to anyone with a contemplative spiritual practice. The community's physical structure will be organized according to the principles of Permaculture. Permaculture allows that in natural systems, there is no waste; all resources can create benefit. At Jubilados, old age is seen not as an end point, but rather as a rededication to creative service as an expression of the spiritual connection. The community is in Santa Fe, New Mexico. The site provides a setting conducive to spiritual practice, and is close to medical, educational and recreational services. More important, the proximity affords the opportunity for meaningful service in many community settings. The Jubilados Community will create an integrated lifestyle, based on mutual support rather than dependence. The physical plant will be constructed in traditional village design with clustered buildings, allowing for the greater part of the site to be dedicated to open space. Common areas will include a meditation hall, communal kitchen, dining facilities and administrative offices. There will also be a library, a theatre, a gym and studios. Residences will consist of eight bedroom / bathroom suites clustered around a common kitchen / living area. Jubilados will begin construction in a year and will be ready to receive occupants in 2002.

 THIS WEEK'S HOROSOCOPE: After being in Pisces for quite some time, Mars moves into Aries, and begins to stir up the area of your chart associated with your career. Things will begin to happen in this section for sure. After a time in which you probably felt stuck, or that all your efforts were producing very few results, you will certainly begin to see a difference. You will want to initiate some action, and get things moving after a period of having to wait. Thank GOD! Finally I will be able to get on with it all and put an end to this limbo routine. Having a job again here I come!

 "It is not our possessions, nor our actions that determine who we are. It is our decisions that make us. And if in this reality, with the divine power of life we have been given which is not defined, the destiny of our life is marked by its transience." ~ Don Isidro, Wise elder of the Kekchi Maya "When a wise one speaks, it is not to convince the incredulous. They do it to guide and awaken the consciousness of those that follow the path towards consciousness. Their words are not only for intellectual debate or for the nourishment of the spirit. In actuality, the spirituality of these prophetic times are not limited to contemplation and meditation. Today spirituality is synonymous with action; and action is every act of your life, in harmony with Mother Nature, and most importantly the harmony within ourselves, and in relation to the way in which we live." ~ Don Pascual, Wise elder of the Mam Maya "

 Your Week in Focus by John - December 08 to 14 There is no doubt that you are more serious about your objectives than you have been for some time, HEATHER. Yet, on the other hand, you are also a lot more fearful of failing. It seems that you have the choice to have more faith in yourself and to stretch yourself to try new things, or you can instead choose to ignore the opportunities banging on your door, and carry on in the same old way. Yet the influences around you at this time will encourage you to explore new options. Venus and Mercury in your opposite sign of Capricorn may mean that friends, loved ones, and anyone you are with on a regular basis will all try to encourage you to do things that they know will make you feel a whole lot better. You need a touch of ecstasy after all that you have been through. And your friends want to see you sing and dance, love and be filled with joy. Much of what you will be combating at this time will be the devils within, rather than the circumstances without. The Sun conjuncts Pluto in Sagittarius, which means that a change of rules or a new project may bring a delightful new element into your working week.

 The contemplation for this week is: "The Sanskrit word for trust is visvas, which means breathe easy. When you find yourself complaining, My tolerance is growing thin, take a moment and be with yourself. Feel your nervous system, breathe easy, and delight in the fullness of the heart. Breathe easy. Visvas. Visvas means breathe easy. Breathe easy, freely, and naturally. Allow yourself to be tolerant in trust. Breathing easy gives patience. Breathing easy gives you access to your core strength. Breathing easy produces stability." -- Gurumayi Chidvilasananda

 urlLink No-Thought for the Day : "The ordinary man is living a very abnormal life, because his values are upside down.

Mundane things are more important than finding some treasures which death cannot destroy. " - Osho

 urlLink My Tarot Reading For Today : Your situation is changing. Your future seems uncertain. Take heart and wait it out -- peace will return in its own time. In the meanwhile, do not waste your precious life force worrying about something you cannot control. The Situation position refers to the general set of influences that surround you and affect your personal experience of peace. We all have to deal with conflict and are affected by the process. When the Wheel of Fortune is in this position, your circumstances may be constantly fluctuating. The changes are driven by a force no mortal can control. Your immediate future is so uncertain. No one can blame you for feeling a bit overwhelmed or confused. Still, you need not succumb to despair. The force in operation is the great washing machine of life. If you can put up with the churning, the rinse cycle and the final spin, then the end result will leave you restored, like new. As with the wheel, what appears up will soon be down and vice versa. In the end, everything will be resolved. It is still a challenge to keep your composure in mid-cycle, however, because the part of you that prefers control feels helpless. Wait and watch from a quiet, meditative place inside yourself, and as you do so, try to absorb and understand the process. You'll be fine if you go with the flow.

 The Winter of Listening No one but me by the fire, my hands burning red in the palms while the night wind carries everything away outside. All this petty worry while the great cloak of the sky grows dark and intense round every living thing. What is precious inside us does not care to be known by the mind in ways that diminish its presence. What we strive for in perfection is not what turns us into the lit angel we desire, what disturbs and then nourishes has everything we need. What we hate in ourselves is what we cannot know in ourselves but what is true to the pattern does not need to be explained. Inside everyone is a great shout of joy waiting to be born. Even with the summer so far off I feel it grown in me now and ready to arrive in the world. All those years listening to those who had nothing to say. All those years forgetting how everything has its own voice to make itself heard. All those years forgetting how easily you can belong to everything simply by listening. And the slow difficulty of remembering how everything is born from an opposite and miraculous otherness. Silence and winter has led me to that otherness. So let this winter of listening be enough for the new life I must call my own. ~ David Whyte

 urlLink Workplace : "For INFPs the job search can be an opportunity to use their creativity, flexibility and their skills in self-expression. They can generate a variety of job possibilities, consider them for their ability to fulfill their values, and pursue them using their skills in communicating with others, either in writing or in person. Their idealism, commitment, flexibility and people skills will usually be communicated to others in the job search. Potential drawbacks for INFPs in the job search include unrealistic expectations for a job, feelings of inadequacy or lack of confidence, and inattention to details of the jobs or of the job search. Under stress, INFPs may become quite critical of others and themselves, and they may hold themselves back because they feel incompetent as they engage in this process. They can benefit from allowing their intuition to give them a new perspective on the possibilities available in the situation. They may also find it helpful to truly acknowledge their skills, as well as the importance of communicating those skills to others. In addition, INFPs can benefit from developing realistic expectations about the job search, and from objectively looking at the logical consequences of the various decisions they make. "

 urlLink Near Future: The Hierophant : Main meaning (positional) You are about to be inducted into the society of teachers and healers. The card in the Near Future position indicates which way the wind is blowing with regard to your situation. If you follow the Advice card, however, you can improve on or neutralize tendencies. With the Hierophant in this position, it appears that you may soon receive some acknowledgment, certification or approval from experts in your field. You are about to be recognized for your efforts, long term dedication and the passion it has taken to absorb the wisdom of those who came before you. In recognition of your dogged commitment, you are being brought into the inner circle. This is no accident. Trust the flow of events as they unfold. You may be needed to help with the transmission of sacred knowledge from the past into the future. General meaning Traditionally known as the Hierophant, this card refers to a Master and the learning of practical lessons from the study of Natural Law. This energy of this card points to some agent or resource that can reveal the secrets of life, the cycles of the moon and tides, the links between human beings and the heavens. Because monasteries were the only places a person could learn to read and write in the middle ages, a Hierophant was one to whom a student would petition for entry. He was the one to set the curriculum for the neophyte's course of study. Often pictured with the right hand raised in blessing, the Hierophant is linked with the ancient lineage of Melchezidek, initiator of the Hebrew priestly tradition, the one who passes on the teachings. All shamans of any tradition draw upon this archetype.

 urlLink From the College of Christ Consciousness : ABOUT FEAR There are 3 universal fears: (1) abandonment (2) not feeling worthy or good enough (3) loss of trust which = fear of surrender "Any time there is a fear, it will fall into one or more of these categories. Each of us is born with one of these three being our core lesson to master in this lifetime. All of our issues, no matter what they are and no matter how they came about, are related to, and can be traced back to, this core fear. I will continue to create the same kind of situations, I will keep myself in judgement, I will reinforce the lower vibrational state of thinking that it's someone else's fault, and I will keep myself in the perception of being victimized until I resolve my own fear program and learn a new perception, a new way of thinking. Fear is only a mask of my true desire." This belief system kicks ass. There are all kinds of exercises on the web site on how to get over yourself and create the reality you want - not in the cheesy way so many self-help shmoes are doing it, but in a straight forward manner that makes sense and can be practiced.

 "Every new beginning is beautiful, filled with extraordinary opportunities, like a door opening on a whole new life. In beginnings there is a childlike innocence, and this innocence is filled with humility, filled with patience. On the spiritual path, these two virtues are paramount: humility and patience. To a beginner they are readily available. A beginner knows he doesn't know, so there is humility. A beginner knows for certain something is going to happen, so there is patience. With humility and patience as his support, a beginner advances into the unknown to discover a glorious event yet to occur. Even after achieving the goal of all spiritual practices, you cannot be indifferent to a new beginning. A beginning is forever full of magic, enchantment, and treasures to be explored. No matter what the occasion, a new beginning must be approached with a mystical awareness of its potential." - Swami Chidvilasanda

 Wage Peace Wage peace with your breath. Breathe in firemen and rubble, breathe out whole buildings and flocks of redwing blackbirds. Breathe in terrorists and breathe out sleeping children and freshly mown fields. Breathe in confusion and breathe out maple trees. Breathe in the fallen and breathe out lifelong friendships intact. Wage peace with your listening: hearing sirens, pray loud. Remember your tools: flower seeds, clothes pins, clean rivers. Make soup. Play music, learn the word for thank you in three languages. Learn to knit, and make a hat. Think of chaos as dancing raspberries, imagine grief as the outbreath of beauty or the gesture of fish. Swim for the other side. Wage peace. Never has the world seemed so fresh and precious. Have a cup of tea and rejoice. Act as if armistice has already arrived. Don't wait another minute. ~ Mary Oliver

You get through tattered and torn around the edges. You get through wondering how you've managed to make it through this far. You get through hanging on for dear life. You get through shaken and shuddering and sheared of everything but your quivering mind and quaking heart, and the distant echo of a memory that this was why you came here. Though you think there has been some colossal mistake, inscrutably, incredibly, something in you knows that this is precisely what you came here so valiantly to endure: this merciless nakedness of heart and soul.

 urlLink Osho Zen Tarot : "Now is the moment to be a bungee jumper without the cord! And it is this quality of absolute trust, with no reservations or secret safety nets, that the Knight of Water demands from us. There is a tremendous sense of exhilaration if we can take the jump and move into the unknown, even if the idea scares us to death. And when we take trust to the level of the quantum leap, we don't make any elaborate plans or preparations. We don't say, 'Okay, I trust that I know what to do now, and I'll settle my things and pack my suitcase and take it with me.' No, we just jump, with hardly a thought for what happens next. The leap is the thing, and the thrill of it as we free-fall through the empty sky. "

 urlLink Osho Zen Tarot : "Every moment in life we have a choice whether to enter life's waters and float, or to try to swim upstream.

Allow this feeling of trust and relaxation to grow more and more; everything is happening exactly as it should."

 urlLink CHINESE ART AND GREEK ART by Rumi The Prophet said, 'There are some who see me by the same light in which I am seeing them. Our natures are one. Without references to any strands of lineage, without refrences to texts or traditions, we drink the life-water together.' Here's a story about that hidden mystery: The Chinese and the Greeks were arguing as to who were the better artists. The king said, 'We'll settle this matter with a debate.' The Chinese began talking, but the Greeks wouldn't say anything. They left. The Chinese suggested then that they each be given a room to work on with their artistry, two rooms facing each other and divided by a curtain. The Chinese asked the king for a hundred colors, all the variations, and each morning they came to where the dyes were kept and took them all. The Greeks took no colors. 'They are not part of our work.' They went to their room and began cleaning and polishing the walls. All day every day they made those walls as pure and clear as an open sky. There is a way that leads from all-colors to colorlessness. Know that the magnificent variety of the clouds and the weather comes from the total simplicity of the sun and the moon. The Chinese finished, and they were so happy. They beat the drums in the joy of completion. The king entered the room, astonished by the gorgeous color and detail. The Greeks then pulled the curtain dividing the rooms. The Chinese figures and images shimmeringly reflected on the clear Greek walls. They lived there, even more beautifully, and always changing in the light. The Greek art is the sufi way. They don't study books of philosophical thought. They make their loving clearer and clearer. No wantings, no anger. In that purity they receive and reflect the images of every moment, from here, from the stars, from the void. They take them in as though they were seeing with the lighted clarity that sees them. In your light I learn how to love. In your beauty, how to make poems. You dance inside my chest, where no one sees you, but sometimes I do, and that sight becomes this art. Drumsound rises on the air, its throb, my heart. A voice inside that beats says, "I know you are tired, but come. This is the way." Are you jealous of the ocean's generosity? Why would you refuse to give this joy to anyone? Fish don't hold the sacred liquid in cups! They swim the huge fluid freedom.

 Manifesto: The Mad Farmer Liberation Front (excerpt) Ask the questions that have no answers. Invest in the millennium. Plant sequoias. Say that your main crop is the forest that you did not plant, that you will not live to harvest. Say that the leaves are harvested when they have rotted into the mold. Call that profit. Prophesy such returns. Put your faith in the two inches of humus that will build under the trees every thousand years. Listen to carrion -- put your ear close, and hear the faint chattering of the songs that are to come. Expect the end of the world. Laugh. Laughter is immeasurable. Be joyful though you have considered all the facts. So long as women do not go cheap for power, please women more than men. Ask yourself: Will this satisfy a woman satisfied to bear a child? Will this disturb the sleep of a woman near to giving birth? Go with your love to the fields. Lie down in the shade. Rest your head in her lap. Swear allegiance to what is highest your thoughts. As soon as the generals and the politicos can predict the motions of your mind, lose it. Leave it as a sign to mark the false trail, the way you didn't go. Be like the fox who makes more tracks than necessary, some in the wrong direction. Practice resurrection. ~ Wendell Berry urlLink web version from panhala

 urlLink Free I-Ching Reading :: I-Ching.com :: Oracle of Changes : "After a thunderstorm, or any period of extreme tension, a period of new clarity and fresh opportunity follows. The storm has the effect of clearing the air and suddenly reducing atmospheric tension. Deliverance is at hand. In the wake of a storm on land, deliverance appears in the form of new color and life, which bursts forth in all the fields and flowers. In the wake of a storm at sea, deliverance takes the form of land itself. In the field of human relations, the rain of forgiveness washes the human landscape clean after a period of enmity and error. Great clarity of purpose and renewed vigor can follow the healing of old wounds. But care must be taken not to re-open these old wounds by moving too quickly. In the same way, it is important to return to normalcy first before moving ahead with new plans after periods of stress. Following the resolution of a difficult situation, your first priority, should be to return to normal conditions as quickly as possible. Breathe a sigh of relief, but don't relax completely. It would be a mistake to re-awaken the sleeping dogs of the immediate past before the new situation has crystallized. Look ahead. Attend to any residual matters that need resolution, and do so as quickly as possible. Make a clean sweep of the past, move deliberately, and the future will bring good fortune."

And that there's a deeper way, and a more demanding way, to try to find a road to happiness.

 Introductions Some of what we love we stumble upon - a purse of gold thrown on the road, a poem, a friend, a great song. And more discloses itself to us - a well among green hazels, a nut thicket - when we are worn out searching for something quite different. And more comes to us, carried as carefully as a bright cup of water, as new bread. ~ Moya Cannon (The Parchment Boat, 1997)

 "At the new moon, the lunar gravity pulls water up, and causes the seeds to swell and burst. This factor, coupled with the increasing moonlight creates balanced root and leaf growth. This is the best time for planting above ground annual crops that produce their seeds outside the fruit. Examples are lettuce, spinach, celery, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, and grain crops. Cucumbers like this phase also, even though they are an exception to that rule. In the second quarter the gravitational pull is less, but the moonlight is strong, creating strong leaf growth. It is generally a good time for planting, especially two days before the full moon. The types of crops that prefer the second quarter are annuals that produce above ground, but their seeds form inside the fruit, such as beans, melons, peas, peppers, squash, and tomatoes. Mow lawns in the first or second quarter to increase growth. After the full moon, as the moon wanes, the energy is drawing down. The gravitation pull is high, creating more moisture in the soil, but the moonlight is decreasing, putting energy into the roots. This is a favorable time for planting root crops, including beets, carrots, onions, potatoes, and peanuts. It is also good for perennials, biennials, bulbs and transplanting because of the active root growth. Pruning is best done in the third quarter, in the sign of Scorpio. In the fourth quarter there is decreased gravitational pull and moonlight, and it is considered a resting period. This is also the best time to cultivate, harvest, transplant and prune. Mow lawns in the third or fourth quarter to retard growth." urlLink More on gardening by the moon phases...

 urlLink HOSPICE of North Central Florida : Why do you want to be a Hospice volunteer? There are two reasons I want to work as a Hospice volunteer. First, I feel a deep desire to work in the field of death and dying. I moved to Gainesville because I want to pursue education for a future career in Hospice. I believe volunteering is an imporant first step for me in defining which direction I will take to do this. Second, I feel I am ready and capable of being a support to people in Hospice. I experienced two losses which were eased by Hospice in Broward County. The Hospice workers gave incredible care to both of my grandmothers as they were approaching life's end and the volunteers who were there played a critical role. I will always remember the support one of the volunteers gave to my mother during that time just by being there to talk to her. To sum it all up, I want to give back. I want to do it with my career and I want to start now. Thank you for asking this question.

Find the leak in the tube, and check the corresponding area of the tire for glass, thorns, or other debris. You should also check the rim for sharp edges that may cause flat tires. Remove the old tube. Inflate the new tube slightly. (Just enough to give it shape.) Put the new tube inside the tire and insert the valve into the valve hole of the rim. Mount the other side of the tire on the rim. It is best to only use your thumbs, but you may need to use tire levers. Partially inflate the tire and check that the bead is evenly seated around the rim. Inflate the tire to recommended pressure. Put the wheel back on the bike and ride.

 urlLink What makes people ticklish? : Dear Yahoo!: What makes people ticklish? Arden Dallas, Texas Dear Arden: Being ticklish is a complicated trait rooted in our evolutionary past. Two searches, 'physiology + ticklish' and 'why are we ticklish,' turned up a number of articles that helped us understand this touchy, feely human feature. Scientists suggest that being ticklish is our defense against creepy crawlies like spiders and bugs, a physiological response alerting us to a specific type of threat. That is why vulnerable parts of our bodies -- feet, chest, and armpits, are among the most ticklish. While there is no question that being ticklish is neurological, scientists contend that it is also learned. One theory sees ticklishness as a personality-based response to perceived attack. Antsy folks may laugh uncontrollably at the lightest touch, or even without being touched at all, while folks made of sterner stuff won't budge during more aggressive tickle attacks. If you close your eyes and try to remain calm while you are tickled, you can decrease panic, reduce giggles, and dull sensation. And, no matter how hard you try, it is nearly impossible to tickle yourself. Tickling satisfies our human need to touch. Robert R. Provine, a professor of neuroscience and author of Quest for Laughter, sees the tickle as a form of communication between friends, family, and lovers, playing a key role in the evolution of social and sexual behavior. He points to chimps tickling each other during play, parents tickling little kids, and lovers tickling each other affectionately. 'If you think the social component is not important,' Provine says, 'Try tickling a stranger.'

 urlLink Osho Zen Tarot : Friendliness First meditate, be blissful, then much love will happen of its own accord. Then being with others is beautiful and being alone is also beautiful. Then it is simple, too. You don't depend on others and you don't make others dependent on you. Then it is always a friendship, a friendliness. It never becomes a relationship, it is always a relatedness. You relate, but you don't create a marriage. Marriage is out of fear, relatedness is out of love. You relate; as long as things are moving beautifully, you share. And if you see that the moment has come to depart because your paths separate at this crossroad, you say good-bye with great gratitude for all that the other has been to you, for all the joys and all the pleasures and all the beautiful moments that you have shared with the other. With no misery, with no pain, you simply separate. - Osho The White Lotus Chapter 10 The branches of these two flowering trees are intertwined, and their fallen petals blend together on the ground in their beautiful colors. It is as if heaven and earth are bridged by love. But they stand individually, each rooted in the soil in their own connection with the earth. In this way they represent the essence of true friends, mature, easy with each other, natural. There is no urgency about their connection, no neediness, no desire to change the other into something else. This card indicates a readiness to enter this quality of friendliness. In the passage, you may notice that you are no longer interested in all kinds of dramas and romances that other people are engaged in. It is not a loss. It is the birth of a higher, more loving quality born of the fullness of experience. It is the birth of a love that is truly unconditional, without expectations or demands.

 urlLink Rare white buffalo born in Arizona : "Things have been hopping lately at the Spirit Mountain Ranch, 20 miles north of Flagstaff on Highway 180. Three baby bison were born in five days, culminating in the birth of Sunrise Spirit, a full-white female Saturday. Two other bison, both reddish brown, were born earlier in the month. One male, Wind Dancer, was born during such strong winds that he could barely stand. The birth of a white buffalo is very meaningful to many Native Americans, who hold that white buffalo are sacred and will return during a period of disaster in the world. Plains Lakota lore says the birth of a female white buffalo heralds a time of enlightenment and healing, bringing all races together in peace, balance and harmony."

 urlLink Osho Zen Tarot : Moment To Moment The past is no more and the future is not yet: both are unnecessarily moving in directions which don't exist. One used to exist, but no longer exists, and one has not even started to exist. The only right person is one who lives moment to moment, whose arrow is directed to the moment, who is always here and now; wherever he is, his whole consciousness, his whole being, is involved in the reality of here and in the reality of now. That's the only right direction. Only such a man can enter into the golden gate. The present is the golden gate. Here-now is the golden gate. ...And you can be in the present only if you are not ambitious--no accomplishment, no desire to achieve power, money, prestige, even enlightenment, because all ambition leads you into the future. Only a non-ambitious man can remain in the present. A man who wants to be in the present has not to think, has just to see and enter the gate. Experience will come, but experience has not to be premeditated. Osho The Great Zen Master Ta Hui Chapter 37 Commentary: As this figure moves across the stones, he steps lightly and non-seriously, and at the same time absolutely balanced and alert. Behind the swirling, ever-changing waters we can see the shapes of buildings; there appears to be a city in the background. The man is in the marketplace but at the same time outside of it, maintaining his balance and able to watch it from above. This card challenges us to move away from our preoccupations with other spaces and other times, and stay alert to what is happening in the here and now. Life is a great ocean in which you can play if you drop all your judgments, your preferences and the attachment to the details of your long-term plans. Be available to what comes your way, as it comes. And don't worry if you stumble or fall; just pick yourself up, dust yourself off, have a good laugh, and carry on.

 Cancer Horoscope Your skin may not be able to contain you now, as it feels like you are ready to shed whatever is now holding you back. As a snake outgrows its skin, you, too, have moved beyond the teachers and authorities that have brought you this far. But you're not going to escape without first finishing what you've started. urlLink General Daily Overview The Moon enters Aries, the first sign of the zodiac, at 6:02 am EDT -- thus beginning the cycle anew as it does every month. We feel the need to initiate action, to act on new feelings, to tackle a new project and in general, to jump in to circumstances before we know the consequences. Additionally, the Moon in Aries forms a tense square with Mars in Cancer, making us struggle with the question of action versus inaction. We feel ready to express our feelings, yet we tend to hold something back, as if our survival depended on it.

 The Seven Of Pentacles -- Marge Piercy Under a sky the color of pea soup she is looking at her work growing away there actively, thickly like grapevines or pole beans as things grow in the real world, slowly enough. If you tend them properly, if you mulch, if you water, if you provide birds that eat insects a home and winter food, if the sun shines and you pick off caterpillars, if the praying mantis comes and the ladybugs and the bees, then the plants flourish, but at their own internal clock. Connections are made slowly, sometimes they grow underground. You cannot tell always by looking what is happening. More than half the tree is spread out in the soil under your feet. Penetrate quietly as the earthworm that blows no trumpet. Fight persistently as the creeper that brings down the tree. Spread like the squash plant that overruns the garden. Gnaw in the dark and use the sun to make sugar. Weave real connections, create real nodes, build real houses. Live a life you can endure: Make love that is loving. Keep tangling and interweaving and taking more in, a thicket and bramble wilderness to the outside but to us interconnected with rabbit runs and burrows and lairs. Live as if you liked yourself, and it may happen: reach out, keep reaching out, keep bringing in. This is how we are going to live for a long time: not always, for every gardener knows that after the digging, after the planting, after the long season of tending and growth, the harvest comes. ~ Marge Piercy

 urlLink Neurology (general): Eye twitch Question: I was trying to find out why I have been having a constant twitching in my left eyelid. It is quite visable and extremely annoying. Any answers would be appreciated. Thanks. Answer: Twitching of the eye almost always occurs in the muscles of the eyelid. Because they press on the eye it may feel as though the eyeball itself is moving Minor eyelid twitches require no treatment as they usually resolve spontaneously. Reducing stress, using warm soaks, in some cases it occurs because of irritation in the eye, which results in twitching of the eyelid. However, if the eye is comfortable it is more likely that it is a simple muscle spasm, which may be related to stress or fatigue or in, many cases happen spontaneously without any known cause. Eye Twitching should resolve on its own it does not it certainly is worth a comprehensive eye examination to ensure that no other problem is occurring in the eye.

 Why does the world seem to be getting more fucked up every week? urlLink Harper's Weekly Review (Harpers.org) : "Six American soldiers, including a general, were facing court martial over the torture and sexual humiliation of Iraqi prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison, which was famous for its torture chambers under Saddam Hussein. Photographs of the abuse were broadcast on U.S. television; one image depicted a hooded prisoner standing on a box with wires attached to his genitals. Other photos showed prisoners masturbating; several showed U.S. soldiers smiling and posing next to their victims. Some of the soldiers blamed mercenaries for the abuses; others said that military intelligence was in control of that cellblock. Photographs were published of British troops beating an Iraqi man and urinating on him; the pictures also showed a soldier striking the man in the genitals with a rifle; the victim's jaw was reportedly broken and his teeth were smashed before he was thrown off the back of a moving truck. President Bush condemned the abuse. "Their treatment does not reflect the nature of the American people," he said. "That's not the way we do things in America." The Urban Institute released a study showing that in some U.S. counties 30 percent of the population is in prison, and an abortion provider in Kansas City was accused of practicing fetal cannibalism. The United States used F-15E and F-16 warplanes, F-14 and F-18 fighter-bombers, AC-130 gunships, and AH-1W Super Cobra helicopters to bomb Fallujah. British Tornados were also used. Some three dozen laser-guided 500-pound bombs were dropped, and at least one building was blown up by accident. A Cobra helicopter fired a missile at a mosque and knocked over its minaret. U.S. forces, fearing a public relations disaster, pulled back from the city and left a new Iraqi force in charge under the command of General Jasim Muhammad Saleh, who served in the Republican Guard under Saddam Hussein. There was some confusion among American officials, however, as to whether the general was really in charge and whether he had actually served in the Republican Guard. Iraq's Governing Council unveiled a new national flag that was immediately condemned for its strong resemblance to the flag of Israel, which features the same shade of blue. "Brother Guide" Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya arrived in Brussels, along with his white stretch Mercedes limo and four female bodyguards wearing tight uniforms, to meet with European officials. He called on the United States and China to rid themselves of nuclear and chemical weapons. "Hopefully," he said, "nothing will force us to go back to the days when we used our cars and explosive belts." Terrorists in Syria fought with police and blew up a bomb outside a former United Nations office in Damascus, and militants in Saudi Arabia attacked the offices of a Western engineering company and killed several people; one American engineer was dragged away behind a car. The United Nations Security Council voted to ban "non-state actors" from possessing nuclear weapons. Police killed more than 100 Muslim militants armed with machetes in southern Thailand. Vandals defaced 127 graves with swastikas and other Nazi symbols in a Jewish cemetery in Alsace, and the Anti-Defamation League released a report showing that European anti-Semitism is on the decline, though negative attitudes toward Israel are up. The Likud Party, in a referendum, rejected Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's plan to withdraw unilaterally from the Gaza Strip, where a pregnant Israeli woman and her four daughters, ages two to 11, were murdered by Palestinian gunmen. Child abductions were on the rise in Afghanistan, and the United Nations was having a hard time recruiting peacekeepers for its mission in Haiti. President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney met for several hours with the 9/11 commission, though they refused to permit the interview to be recorded or transcribed; two Democratic members of the commission had to leave early because they had other appointments. It was reported that more than $5 billion in antiterrorism money for local governments and agencies has been held up by red tape, and that last year the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control assigned only four employees to work on terrorist cases; in contrast, almost two dozen were investigating violations of the Cuban embargo. Since 1990, the office has opened 93 investigations into terrorist finances and 10,683 relating to Cuba. President Bush declined to investigate China's unfair trade practices, and ten new countries joined the European Union. Bosnian Serb officials revealed six new mass graves containing victims of the Srebrenica massacre. California banned Diebold's electronic voting machines, and experts said that the United States is losing its dominance in science and technology. Scientists developed a type of computer made of DNA that they hope could someday diagnose and treat diseases from inside the particular human cells that require treatment. SARS continued to spread in China. Researchers discovered a molecule, used by some cancer tumors, that prevents cells from dying. Archaeologists found an underground Egyptian maze filled with mummies, and scientists discovered that women tend to marry men who look like their fathers. A Russian museum of erotica announced an exhibit featuring Grigory Rasputin's penis."

 urlLink Abandoned Whizhost customer FAQ Due to the overwhelming number of questions generated by former Whizhost customers, PLEASE look for answers here rather than asking by e-mail. Q Could you let me know when my website that were hosted by Whizhost will be back on-line, and if there is anything I need to do? A According to the correspondence we have had with Whizhost, they have abandoned their customers.

A You will find current information on our forums Q What are the chances of getting my Whizhost accts restored? And what about backups? I have clients with databases etc on their Whizhost-hosted account and they need to retrieve the data from them. Also, retrieve emails. What are the chances of this and what timeframe are we looking at. A Sorry restoration and/or backups are unlikely. You will find current information on our forums Q Will we still be able to host free of charge for the rest of the contract we had at Whizhost? A Sorry. we are unable to provide free hosting.

A Your billing period will begin 14 days following your account migration We wish we could do more, but we're forced to limit our Whizhost "victims" offering due to the overwhelming abuse that Whizhost has imposed. This should provide ample time to decide what you want to do. We HOPE you'll consider staying with us. Q I have 2 reseller accounts with Whizhost with unlimited mysql databases, unlimited emails accounts, 6000MB hard disk space and 20 domains. I understand you guys take the customers of Whizhost but I have my own customers and they are very angry with this situation. There are a lot of people involved in this trouble. A We understand your situation and are here to help. Unfortunately "Unlimited" anything is not an option. We at SB-Host believe offering any type of "Unlimited" services is unethical. If you have specific requirements, contact us. Our offerings are flexible. Q I would like a refund of my Whizhost fees. This is all totally unacceptable, the MIGHT restore data? When I signed up it said 99.9% downtime and generators and backups and all that. Now your saying I have to set everything back up with some other company and MIGHT get my data. I dont have the data locally, so you just lost everything? Where are these backups Please refund my monies for all service as I did not receive the service you promoted. A Sorry. We didn't take your money, nor did we make any promises we did not keep. Although paying more does not guarantee better service, in most cases deals that are "too good to be true," usually are. We believe Whizhost qualifies in the "too good to be true" category. Q I had a pre-paid Whizhost account, and I'm confused. Do I upload my files onto your server, or are they supposed to come back online? A Due to the lack of cooperation by other "players" in this problem, We do not recommend waiting for the Whizhost server to come back online. Q Once all this is settled, we would like a refund of service as my customers are all finding other providers. This was all handled so unprofessional.... A Refunds are unlikely. "Unprofessional" is an understatement.

 urlLink Discovery Health :: Quit Smoking: If You StoppedToday.... This site states that "a review of numerous research studies focusing on smoking cessation has concluded that while women may suffer greater relative risks of smoking-related diseases than do men, they tend to have more difficulty than men in quitting smoking." I am sure all that's true but here are some good reasons to remember when the craving is bad (like it is right now). Reproductive health: Women smokers are at higher risk for pregnancy complications, early menopause, infertility, miscarriage, pre-term delivery, stillbirth, infant death and having low birth-weight babies. Smoking also doubles a woman's risk of cervical cancer. Children's health: Smoking increases the chances of sudden infant death syndrome, infant and perinatal deaths, learning disorders, attention deficit disorder and disruptive behavior. "If you bathe a fetus' brain in nicotine for nine months, it's clear there are profound effects," says Dr. Timothy McAfee, executive director for health promotion and disease prevention for Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound. Hormones: Smoking causes women to enter menopause sooner and interrupts the menstrual cycle. "It's also well established that the aging processskin and wrinklesis substantially faster in women who smoke," McAfee adds.

 urlLink Painting Over Plastic Laminate : "Is there any way to paint over dark-brown plastic-laminate kitchen cabinets? I can't replace or reface them right now, and they're just too dark for the room. I'd appreciate any tips." - Lyndee, via e-mail John says: If you're looking at ugly laminate, refacing it with not-so-ugly laminate is the best course of action, from the standpoint of durability and ease of care. But if it's paint you want, the answer to your question is yes, as long as the laminate is well-adhered and in good condition. First, I'd wipe down all the surfaces with a solvent such as xylol to get rid of dirt and grease. Be sure to don chemical-resistant gloves, wear a respirator, shut off any pilot lights, and kick out the dog - this is powerful stuff. Then scuff up all the surfaces with 150-grit sandpaper and wipe them down again with xylol. Next, you want a primer that will adhere tenaciously and serve as a good base for paint. The one I use comes from X-I-M, a company that manufactures bonding primers; they have several solvent-based products suitable for your application. I find that the spray-applied primer actually holds better than the brush-on version. Allow two or three days for the primer to cure before sanding it lightly with 220-grit paper. Then you can apply either a latex or oil-based paint; I prefer oil in kitchens because it gives a smoother finish and is easier to clean. (John Dee, a painting and decorating contractor based in Concord, Mass., has restored finishes on five This Old House projects.)

 Rush for surnames produces 500 Genghis Khans By Oliver August MONGOLIANS have been ordered to invent their own surnames, after generations of living with just one name on the orders of their former Soviet masters. Hundreds, pondering what to call themselves, daily besiege a small office in the centre of their capital where identity documents are issued. Held back by armed guards outside, some opt for surnames like Seven Drunk Men that hint at Mongolia's national pastime. Others prefer to adopt the name of Genghis Khan, still the mightiest of Mongols, who now has 500 namesakes in Ulan Bator. When communism crumbled in 1990 the ban on family names was lifted but many nomadic herders who roam between Siberia and the Gobi desert continue to refer to each other only by single names. Now, to fight incest and make official records more intelligible, the Government has set a deadline of June 27 for all 2.5 million Mongolians to choose a family name on pain of a fine equivalent to several months' salary. "We are returning to our ancient traditions," the Defence Minister said. The result is a stampede to state registration offices by Mongolians wearing felt hats and embroidered riding boots. urlLink more...

 urlLink A GLASS OF MILK : One day, a poor boy who was selling goods from door to door to pay his way through school, found he had only one thin dime left, and he was hungry. He decided he would ask for a meal at the next house. However, he lost his nerve when a lovely young woman opened the door. Instead of a meal he asked for a drink of water. She thought he looked hungry so brought him a large glass of milk. He drank it slowly, and then asked, "How much do I owe you?" "You don't owe me anything," she replied. "Mother has taught us never to accept pay for a kindness." He said..... "Then I thank you from my heart." As Howard Kelly left that house, he not only felt stronger physically, but his faith in God and man was strong also. He had been ready to give up and quit. Many years later that same young woman became critically ill. The local doctors were baffled. They finally sent her to the big city, where they called in specialists to study her rare disease. Dr. Howard Kelly was called in for the consultation. When he heard the name of the town she came from, a strange light filled his eyes. Immediately he rose and went down the hall of the hospital to her room. Dressed in his doctor's gown he went in to see her. He recognized her at once. He went back to the consultation room determined to do his best to save her life. From that day he gave special attention to her case. After a long struggle, the battle was won. Dr. Kelly requested the business office to pass the final bill to him for approval. He looked at it, then wrote something on the edge and the bill was sent to her room. She feared to open it, for she was sure it would take the rest of her life to pay for it all. Finally she looked, and something caught her attention on the side of the bill. She read these words....."Paid in full with one glass of milk" (Signed) Dr. Howard Kelly Tears of joy flooded her eyes as her happy heart prayed: "Thank You, God, that Your love has spread abroad through human hearts and hands." There's a saying which goes something like this: Bread cast on the waters comes back to you. The good deed you do today may benefit you or someone you love at the least expected time.

 urlLink Warning: nicotine seriously improves health Robin McKie, science editor Sunday July 18, 2004 The Observer Nicotine could soon be rehabilitated as a treatment for schizophrenia, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, as well as hyperactivity disorders. Research shows that the chemical that has addicted millions to smoking has a powerful impact on brain activity in patients who suffer from psychiatric and degenerative disorders. Some experiments have shown that nicotine can slow down the onset of Parkinson's symptoms; others have had revealed its power in curtailing the hallucinations of schizophrenics. 'A whole range of psychiatric conditions seem to be helped by nicotine,' said Dr Dan McGehee, a neurobiologist at the University of Chicago. 'However, such benefits do not justify smoking. The lethal effects of cigarettes far outweigh any help they provide. On the other hand, our research does suggest that derivatives of nicotine, administered medically, could help to alleviate a range of psychiatric problems.' Nicotine is known to switch on receptors on the surface of cells in certain parts of the brain, causing these neurones to release the neuro-transmitter dopamine, a chemical that is associated with feelings of pleasure. This effect leads to a person's addiction. More than 50 per cent of people suffering from clinical depression smoke, while the figure rises to 95 per cent for schizophrenics. But smoking among the general public has dropped to about 25 per cent. 'The assumption is that people with psychiatric conditions are self-medicating,' said McGehee. 'They are smoking because the nicotine in particularly helpful in alleviating their condition.' This point is backed by Dr Tony George, of Yale University. 'Smoking is a marker for psychopathology,' he states in the current issue of the journal Nature Medicine. Similarly, it has been found that nicotine can sometimes slow the debilitating symptoms of Parkinson's, a disease caused by the slow destruction of certain types of brain cells. 'Either nicotine stimulates other types of brain cells to compensate for the loss of the cells involved in Parkinson's, or it is somehow providing protection to remaining healthy Parkinson's cells,' said McGehee. 'Either way, the effect is noticeable.'

CS Rep: The first step is to open your HEART. Have you located your HEART ma'am? Customer: Yes I have, but there are several programs running right now. Is it okay to install while they are running? CS Rep: What programs are running ma'am? Customer: Let me see....I have PASTHURT.EXE, LOWESTEEM.EXE, GRUDGE.EXE,and RESENTMENT.COM running right now. CS Rep: No problem. LOVE will automatically erase PASTHURT.EXE from your current operating system. It may remain in your permanent memory, but it will no longer disrupt other programs. LOVE will eventually overwrite LOWESTEEM.EXE with a module of its own called HIGHESTEEM.EXE. However, you have to completely turn off GRUDGE.EXE and RESENTMENT.COM. Those programs prevent LOVE from being properly installed. Can you turn those off ma'am? Customer: I don't know how to turn them off. Can you tell me how? CS Rep: My pleasure. Go to your Start menu and invoke FORGIVENESS.EXE. Do this as many times as necessary until GRUDGE.EXE and RESENTMENT.COM have been completely erased. Customer: Okay, I'm done. LOVE has started installing itself automatically. Is that normal? CS Rep: Yes it is. You should receive a message that says it will reinstall for the life of your HEART. Do you see that message? Customer: Yes I do. Is it completely installed? CS Rep: Yes, but remember that you have only the base program. You need to begin connecting to other HEARTS in order to get the upgrades. Customer: Oops...I have an error message already. What should I do? CS Rep: What does the message say? Customer: It says "ERROR 412 - PROGRAM NOT RUN ON INTERNAL COMPONENTS." What does that mean? CS Rep: Don't worry ma'am, that's a common problem. It means that the LOVE program is set up to run on external HEARTS but has not yet been run on your HEART. It is one of those complicated programming things, but in nontechnical terms it means you have to "LOVE" your own machine before it can "LOVE" others. Customer: So what should I do? CS Rep: Can you find the directory called "SELF-ACCEPTANCE"? Customer: Yes, I have it. CS Rep: Excellent, you are getting good at this. Customer: Thank you. CS Rep: You're welcome. Click on the following files and then copy them to the "MYHEART" directory: FORGIVESELF.DOC, SELFESTEEM.TXT, REALIZEWORTH.TXT, and GOODNESS.DOC. The system will overwrite any conflicting files and begin patching any faulty programming. Also, you need to delete SELFCRITIC.EXE from all directories, and then empty your recycle bin afterwards to make sure it is completely gone and never comes back. Customer: Got it. Hey! My HEART is filling up with really neat files. SMILE.MPG is playing on my monitor right now and it shows that WARMTH.COM, PEACE.EXE, and CONTENTMENT.COM are copying themselves all over my HEART! CS Rep: Then LOVE is installed and running. You should be able to handle it from here. One more thing before I go... Customer: Yes? CS Rep: LOVE is freeware. Be sure to give it and its various modules to everybody you meet. They will in turn share it with other people and they will return some really neat modules back to you. Customer: I will. Thank you for your help.

Even the smallest sound, the faintest glow of light, can attract unwanted attention. When the darkness of stupidity reigns, it is best that your own brilliance stay 'hidden under a bushel basket.' That is, your thoughts and efforts should be quiet and self-contained, and protected, as much as possible, from harmful external influences. Whatever you do, don't let yourself be swept along on the current of conventional wisdom when dangerous uncertainties exist. Try not to become too depressed or anxious; this period will pass. Just endure it for now and inwardly preserve your self-confidence, while outwardly remaining cooperative and flexible. The time to assert yourself will come. Avoid looking too far ahead if you have not yet achieved your goals. That only brings regret and longing, which can eat away at your inner resources. Be cautious and reserved. Control yourself. Do not needlessly awaken dormant forces of opposition. During dark, unsettled periods, it is best to step gingerly around the sleeping dogs."

 Stepping Westward (excerpt) What is green in me darkens, muscadine. If woman is inconstant, good, I am faithful to ebb and flow, I fall in season and now is a time of ripening. If her part is to be true, a north star, good, I hold steady in the black sky and vanish by day, yet burn there in blue or above quilts of cloud. There is no savor more sweet, more salt that to be glad to be what, woman, and who, myself, I am, a shadow that grows longer as the sun moves, drawn out on a thread of wonder. ~ Denise Levertov (Poems, 1960-1967)

 urlLink Making Handmade Paper in 10 easy steps : Simple Recipe: Many types of paper that can be used include: Computer Paper (unprinted) Newspaper (If you want a grayish colored paper) Magazines Egg Cartons Old Cards (For heavier paper) Toilet Paper Paper Bags Non Waxed Boxes (Pre-soak in warm water) Office Paper Tissue Paper (For finer paper) Typing Paper Napkins Construction Paper Supplies you'll need: Sponge Window Screening (mold) Wood Frame (old picture frame can be used too) (deckle) Plastic Basin/Tub (Large enough to totally immerse frame) Blender/Food Processor (For making paper pulp) White Felt or Flannel Fabric Staples or Tacks (For tacking screen on frame) Liquid starch (optional) Instructions: 1. Select the pieces of paper to be recycled. You can even mix different types to create your own unique paper. 2. Rip the paper into small bits, and place into the blender. (about half full). Fill the blender with warm water. Run the blender slowly at first then increase the speed until the pulp looks smooth and well blended. ( 30 -40 seconds) Check that no flakes of paper remain. If there are, blend longer. 3. The next step is to make a mold. The mold, in this case, is made simply by stretching fiberglass screen (plain old door and window screen) over a wooden frame and stapling it. It should be as tight as possible. 4. Fill the basin about half way with water. Add 3 blender loads of pulp. (the more pulp you add the thicker the finished paper will be) Stir the mixture. 5. Now is the time to add the liquid starch for sizing.(This is not necessary but if the paper is going to be used for writing on, you should add some, the starch helps to prevent inks from soaking into the paper fibers.) Stir 2 teaspoons of liquid starch into the pulp. Place the mold into the pulp and then level it out while it is submerged. Gently wiggle it side-to-side until the pulp on top of the screen looks even. 6. Slowly lift the mold up until it is above the level of the water. Wait until most of the water has drained from the new paper sheet. If the paper is very thick, remove some pulp from the tub. If it is too thin, add more pulp and stir the mixture again. 7. When the mold stops dripping, gently place one edge on the side of a fabric square (felt or flannel square). Gently ease the mold down flat, with the paper directly on the fabric. Use a sponge to press out as much water as possible. Wring the excess water from the sponge back into the large plastic tub. 8. Now comes the tricky part. Hold the fabric square flat and slowly lift the edge of the mold. The wet sheet of paper should remain on the fabric. If it sticks to the mold, you may have pulled to fast or not pressed out enough water. It takes a little practice. You can gently press out any bubbles and loose edges at this point. 9. Repeat the steps above, and stack the fabric squares on a cookie sheet. Save one fabric square to place on the top of the stack to cover the last piece of paper. Use another cookie sheet to press the remaining water out of the stack. (do this outside or in the bathtub, it can make a mess) 10. After you press the stack, gently separate the sheets. They can be dried by hanging on a clothesline or laying them out on sheets of newspaper. When they have dried peel them off the fabric and voila! you have paper!
