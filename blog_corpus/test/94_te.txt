 Hee Hee...he said "Joke"

 God damn it, my company has blocked redmeat again. How am I supposed to entertain myself at work? Cue favourite joke about wanking in the toilets at work.

 That link thing happens to me sometimes. Don't know why.

 i remembered what i'd written - i was horrified and self-loathing at the time, but couldn't be arsed to change it. not sure why the links have moved, but i'm pretty sure that it's damo's fault.

 Also, why are the links on the right all the way down the bottom of the page? Hur hur. I said bottom.

 How did you see what he did? Did you remember, or is there some way to see changes to posts?

 Anyone seen this urlLink Star Ocean game? I'm looking forward to it as much as playing Kingdom Hearts. Man, chipped PS2's are the best thing since normal PS2's. Everyone should get one. Unless they have an X-box. Dave, I changed your use of "There's" to "There are". Now tell me I was wrong.

 jesus - i see what you did. and rightly so.

 which one and how? [furious]

 I'm not holding out much hope for Fallout 3. It's being done by Bathesda now. They make quite beardy games. Holy shit I'm bored this afternoon.

 It's a different software house making it now, right? I diddled Dave's message. I hope that makes him angry.

 there are&nbsp;strings attached. so we shall see.

 Fallout 3 was officially announced last week as well...I imagine this makes certain people happy?

 how much shit is there to sort?

 I went to the pub again, but my favourite bar maid was not there. there was a different one with a CRACKING arse, but it was scant substitute. Does that even make sense? Anyway, I'll have to go again tomorrow until I get my weekly fix of ridiculously fit bird. Am I supposed to be coming up to London on Friday then? If that's the case, I might have to come back on Saturday so I can sort some shit out on Sunday.

 I've been playing boules and now the disc space nazis are aftre me. must be a tuesday then

 o why are the adverts offering me ally mcbeal dvds now? how many women has it detected here?

 i bet you can't remember all the cheats. i've had a day of golf, and am pretty pleased, if physically broken.

 I've been playing Doom2 with a nifty little utility called jDoom. It's awesome like 5 hotdogs.

 weekend. now.

 Killing Charlie is a fundemental part of any American child's education.&nbsp; The first time&nbsp;an American&nbsp;child wakes up screaming "They're in the trees...they're in the fucking trees" it's cause for celebration within the family.&nbsp; It's kind of like the Barmitzvah (if that's how it's spelt) in Judaism,&nbsp;the Coming of age celebrations in Hinduism/Sikhism or your first car bomb in Islam. &nbsp; They celebrate with hot dogs and bud beers...it's true (see what I did there)...MTV told me.

 I noticed that Kerry snuck in a bit about believing in science and supporting stem cell research. That surprised me, and is really going to piss off the Bible Belt. Damn God-botherers.

 I mentioned in the office that I didn't think a presendential candidate's fondness of killing Charlie should really be the basis of voting for him. They looked at me like I was crazy.

 let's go and watch a film that we know will be bad, for all the wrong reasons. who's with me? fonz did this one, didn't he?

 That reminds me Dave, will we be able to see King Arfar on Sunday or not? Doens't matter if not. Right, I'm sodding off up to London. Who's with me? No one? Right.

 I just read John Kerry's nomination acceptance speech. Christ, he can talk. God bless America.

 'Reminisce' Yes, I can.

 everyone knows that sunday dvds are tfotr, ttt and rotk. ee's. back-to-back. that'll learn it for being sunday.

 can you spell "reminisce"? i'm not sure i can.

 I dun watched the Borne Supremacy yesterday. It was quite good. There were adequate car chase scenes, not (quite) enough beatings, more than enough who-am-I moments, and nowhere near enough boobs. Worth watching, but possibly as a sunday afternoon DVD.

 I'd do all kinds of things with that sort of money. Who am I kidding? I'd be dead within a year. I'd spend all that money on irradicating people who type their whole e-mail message in the subject line and leave the e-mail blank.

 i'd hire a girl to lick my balls clean, 24/7. although lewis black had that idea first. he's a genius.

 *more* porn?

 What would you do with 13 billion dollars Dave?

 I concur with damo, ross and yoav. Which is what I was stating rather confusingly below. So it's not "Ewan" then?

 $45bn - $32bn = dave's christmas bonus, i fancy.

 silly welsh.

 Hmm, I don't think that's correct Fonz. urlLink This is a&nbsp;list of all the companies in the world making more than $100bn of revenues in a year. The top is Wal-Mart who make $266bn, which is around 140 billion quid. So I don't see anyone incurring as much cost as you have there. Are you still working for the viagra people? They're raking in $45bn a year and spending around $32bn a year, which is around $60k a minute I think.

 Hmm, having looked into it (I am very bored) I couldn't find anywhere a rating of just how large this company is, or how many employees it has worldwide even. But I did find out that it's sales income is about 30 billion dollars a year, which makes me think that damo's theory about the million pounds a minute thing being rubbish is not rubbish. In summary then, Chris.

 I make it 577 billion pounds a year in outgoings. Of course, this company is way bigger than Microsoft.

 I keep reading about this guy Ioan Gruffudd , but I have no idea how to pronounce his stupid name. Can someone tell me?

 Maybe I done did the math wrong in my head but that's over £125billion a year before profit...Microsoft only do around $20billion...sounds fishy to me!

 Yeah, that was awesome, but only like two or three hot dogs I reckon. I hope Dave's right about the making profit equation. I am freaking bored, and everyone here seems to have gone home on their summer hours scheme. What shall I do to pass the next two hours?

 urlLink The Shining in 30 seconds is awesome like 20 hot dogs.

 yeah, but in theroum they're making more than that. or the whole world would explode or something. so that's some tidy moneymaking right there. go on, shake your moneymaker.

 I don't read the tabloids. I look at the pictures. The only reason I picked the Hewitt was that he was top of the 'movers and losers' list last divvy-day. Honest.

 Yeah, ed sent me some links and a squad list for the proper telegraph game. I can't remember if he told me which of the leagues we were going for, but either way picking my team was more entertainig than the work I was supposed to be doing. I found out today that it costs one million pounds per minute of each working day worldwide to run the company I work for. That's an expensive operation right there.

 well, it turns out that our pseudo-scottish snake-in-the-grass has been reading the tabloids the whole time. i think there should be an inquiry. fonz, did ed mention that he and banksy are considering going for the on-line telegraph fanfoot this year? apparently you get a 18-man squad and that. it's supposubly better. there was quite a good article on the bbc news web site last night about the bbfc and that. i agreed with it. although it quoted the professor of computer games at stafford university (or somesuch), which i thought devalued it a little.

 Well done for having the Hewitt. I don't actually have access to the tabloids, so I was wondering why the hell he was top divi this week. I concur with your rant.

 This week on the 'Daq I had James Hewitt, who did some coke or something, and the Aguilera Monster, who is a fairly consistent divvy-er. Suck my 'Daq, Fonx.

 I posted a rant about Dixons withdrawing Manhunt, but then my damn interweb connection swallowed it. Suffice it to say - Dixons bummers, mentalists bad, games not responsible, BBFC correct. Consider yourselves ranted at.

 I didn't know that was Stiller's wife. Ross, how did you do so well in the 'Daq last week? Which celb did you have? Also, has anyone icked a fan foot team for this year yet? I think I've just done mine. I think Ross should join in this year.

 guess which governator of california is 57 today? it's also ben stiller's wife's birthday. i realised yesterday that she was the bald chick in friends. and i found urlLink another one . fonz: keys are in place.

 damo's post just appeared from nowhere. it was a bit scary.

 I might try and download that album when I get the chance. I've just been over to the canteen for a cocked breakfast. Cheeky or what? Dave, did you remember to leave you keys with the man on the front desk? And if not, what should I do? I'm bringing my golf bag and clubs up with me, and I'm gonna ninja your ass on the golf course.

 why can't i post today? and why is ross reading the sun? or at least, looking at page 3. you enlightened renaissance man, you. fonz and i are going to be golf-ninjas very soon. why do i keep trying to spell ninjas with a g? maybe the ginger ones are ningas. someone get me the new soulwax album that isn't out yet.

 Jesus, Bambos, you have only just found that? Dude, you suck at the internet.

 What was actually happening&nbsp;there Dave! - a cop in the background whispering into his walkie talkie... " We have one, I repeat we have one...eta to cell 1230.&nbsp; Good condition...mild bruising to left leg, good runner, one careful beating.&nbsp;" All the cops leave the streets and convene at the local nick.&nbsp; David Dickinson makes an Orange faced appearance and wanders around all the cells passing such comments as "There's a little chip here which may reduce it's value but&nbsp;its head will certainly look good mounted on the wall...a bargain at £30"...he then introduces two fresh out of training school cops.&nbsp; "There's a £100, you have half an hour to find some bargains!" "How will our amateurs do? Find out at the end of the program!" David then introduces a hardened cop..."So how long have you been in the business?" "Oh about 20 years"..."Anything caught your eye today?" "There's one in cell 3 with a fine set of teeth...it's going for about £30 quid...but is worth well over £60...imagine the fun you'd have putting your boot through those!" Two cops return, bright eyed and bushy tailed.&nbsp; Satsuma faced David turns to them "And what have you fellows picked up today then?" "Well, I've bought the one in cell 6 for £10...a bargain...come and look" David looks perplexed..."Oh deary deary me...sometimes you can't beat experience it has to be said...that looks like a half cast to me...you'll be lucky to make back half of what you paid at auction!" I can't be bothered to type anymore &nbsp;

 I've discovered I have debt well over the national average. Yay me.

 I'm not worried about it either, because I'm a selfish bastard and I have very little consumer debt. And a savings account. So I think she and I should get together and exchange bodily fluids. I mean ideas. Yes.

 The girl with her tits out on Page 3 of The Sun today says she's not worried that consumer debt has risen over a trillion pounds, because 'we're a rich country'. Well, I'm reassured.

 You hear that? That's the sound of justice.

 damo, you'll be pleased to hear that the mugger is darrk. the policemen are not. they've not kicked him yet, though.

 i just saw three plain-clothes policemen take down a mugger on the opposite side of the street from me. there was lots of shouting, then they tackled him as he was running away. walkie-talkies and everything. one of them just brought the car around. the mugger's sitting handcuffed on the pavement at the moment, and the bald copper keeps shouting "shut up! shut the fuck up" in his ear, and pushing him over. it's like television. the whole neighbourhood's watching from its windows.

 80% of the work is done in 20% of the time. The other 20% of the work requires the remaining 80% of the time. What that really means is that the easy stuff is easy to do, and the complicated stuff is usually not necessary. It's why when you're enjoying your work, people can see results, and when you're hating your work they keep asking you when they're going to see more results. It's very handy because you can talk your way out of doing anything boring and time consuming.

 What's the 80/20 rule? It sounds an awful lot like something I can use to get out of doing any work for a bit, and information like that should be shared.

 i'll draw them a graph with a line on it represting my income, a line representing the pressure on my income, an umbrella, and a fat cash bath. i reckon i could, too. i've just been emailed a request to explain everything that's wrong with everything by the end of tomorrow. but i want to do my buttons. my buttons.

 Debbie Does Dallas Special Edition is just like the first one except all the cocks are replaced by walkie-talkies. And Han shoots first, if you know what I mean. Hur-hur. Those buttons do need re-doing. The travel system will take a while to re-do, make sure they know that because otherwise they'll say to you, look, it was 80% of the way there, why is it taking so long? You should explain the 80-20 rule with some pictures and maybe a puppet.

 my guts have got some serious ache on. i think i can hear all the porcelain within a mile radius quailing. i'm sure i have debbie does dallas somewhere. at least, debbie does dallas: the next generation. which is like the old one, but one of the characters is wearing tyre over his eyes. yove: i've given up on my real work (re-creating the travel tables in the database) and i've started making some new buttons for the menu screens. i am king.

 Yes, and this new one never says anything about queer-ies. It has no sense of humour.

 It can certainly be a bit temperamental. Unlike the old BOA, which was perfect.

 I don't think I understand this new boa. I hit publish post, and it tells me that the blog doesn't exist anymore, then it posts my message twice. I'm looking for another button to click but it's the only one i can see.

 I want to see Debbie Does Dallas, in 30 seconds, acted by bunnies. No hold on, I just want to see Debbie Does Dallas.

 I think urlLink that is good. I feel sleepy and muzzy headed. I have a sneaking suspicion it's from sitting in a beer garden drinking lager.

 i'm not sure whether urlLink this is good or not. i feel bloaty. i bet it was that third sandwich.

 Dude, she's so fine I'd happily pay you a small fortune to come round and have a turn, broken legs or no. I think this makes us both wrong in the head.

 Sorry Fonz, you went on so much about her...well - She's tied up in my wardrobe at the moment with a rag of cloth in her mouth.&nbsp; I hope one day to be able to untie her and let her roam free about my room...if the worst comes to the worst I may well break her legs but it's ok&nbsp;- she loves me so she'll understand

 Dude, that sucks. It is fricking roasting here Mr Bigglesworth, so I've been drinking in the beer garden. The good news? I am drunk. Tha bad news? I don't think the fit bar maid works at the pub anymore. She was too good for us anyway...

 it does feel an offal lot like friday today. why is that? i got my scare cut. there will be no ambiguity about my sexuality now.

 I was sure it was Friday today. I was quite crushed when I found out I have to come to work tomorrow.

 I did that once. I couldn't sit down for a week afterwards. The barber's chair had a big spring in it that upset my piles, you see.

 would i want to rent an ally mcbeal dvd? is it the way i walk? i'll get a haircut, and tell them that i want a "hard man". that should put an end to this.

 and that's why damo's not on c oh.

 You should phone up the&nbsp; people in Shanghai and say "Allo Mr Sars, it's me Mr Dave...wha' yu wan'?"

 I'm here, and I have nothing to say.

 That'll learn you.

 the shanghai office had a problem with their email this morning. the great thing about shanghai is that it's about 7 or 8 hours ahead of us. i'm on call this week. i want to die.

 I don't know about that...Fonz's response had he been the interviewer would have been "You know someone that would pay for Fonz love?"

 That was weird. At work, I couldn't see Yoav's message, hence my 'talking to himself' post. But at home it suddenly appeared in the past. I suspect witchcraft. I think Fonz is equipped to be a prostitute.

 I've done it! I've taken monday off work to shop my way around London. Now I need to go home and strip my golfing equipment down to the bare minimum and see if I can carry my shit. Oh, and practise my swing, because I haven't played since... well, since I played with Dave last time.

 ross will help you. he has the soul of a saint and the powers of a super-hero. i know that he won't let us down. right?

 Who wants to help me carry my golf clubs to london? No one? Alright then.

 he's very deaf sometimes. it must be his godzilla ears. ooh, tea-time.

 pay attention won't you?

 come to london this weeked, or i'll kick your grass.

 yes, but in lahndahn we have all things in the proper proportion (try saying that on a cold day), whereas everything in tokyo is tiny, tootiny.

 I think Wobav is talking to himself.

 i wanted to email you a supposed picture of your winky that i found on the innernet for your confirmation. i'm going to remove yoab's extra post - just watch me!

 Apparently, Lahndahn is the second most expensive city in the world, behind Tokyo. And Tokyo-ites have a much better quality of life. This must mean that anyone who lives in Lahndahn must be the very end of the bell. The donger, if you will.

 Yes, they say everything twice here to hammer the point home. Or maybe I'm not used to this new-fangled boa.

 I could have. If I remember, I'll set up one of our Blueyonder mailboxes with an alias. I make no promises about checking it, though. Why?

 What I am learning in America: It is a portion of National Public Radio (NPR) interview between a female broadcaster and US Marine Corps General Reinwald who was about to sponsor a Boy Scout Troop visiting his military installation FEMALE INTERVIEWER: So, General Reinwald, what things are you going to teach these young boys when they visit your base? GENERAL REINWALD: We're going to teach them climbing, canoeing, archery, and shooting. FEMALE INTERVIEWER: Shooting! That's a bit irresponsible, isn't it? GENERAL REINWALD: I don't see why, they'll be properly supervised on the rifle range. FEMALE INTERVIEWER: Don't you admit that this is a terribly dangerous activity to be teaching children? GENERAL REINWALD: I don't see how. We will be teaching them proper rifle discipline before they even touch a firearm. FEMALE INTERVIEWER: But you're equipping them to become violent killers. GENERAL REINWALD: Well, you're equipped to be a prostitute, but you're not one, are you? The radio went silent and the interview ended.

 *the* hole? where is it? where are you hiding it?

 Yes, it's a guilty pleasure, like whacking off while looking through the hole in the wall of the ladies changing room showers.

 *you* make me sick, ross. come to london and help me wipe the bile from my jaw. do you have an email address that isn't your hotmail one? that you read? watching friends makes me feel sad. in both ways. why is that?

 The Metro suggested that it could be Smithers and Mr Burns getting hitched. I suggest that the writers of the Metro are idiots. The SpaceShipOne team have set the dates for their attempts at the Ansari x-Prize. It's so exciting, I may be sick. Well, maybe not. I want to go into space, damnit!

 presumably, bets on smithers are pretty short.

 I agree with Fonz...he looks like he had an injection of gay at some point - not fonz...the dad ok!

 I heard that Simpson's rumour. I reckon Millhouse's dad could be the gayer.

 what's been wrong with the boa this morning? can i post yet?

 Apparently there's going to be a gay wedding in the Simpsons. How frightfully modern.

 Well at least you've proven your potential...

 The fools! NatWest have agreed to lend me ten grand, and all I needed to do was spin them some bullshit story about training to be a lawyer. Bwahaha! Oh.

 A long story for ananova really, but all you actually need to know is in the last couple of sentences of the third last paragraph.&nbsp; It runs in the family then? urlLink http://www.ananova.com/entertainment/story/sm_1035845.html?menu =

 Dave, will I have any time to do any shopping in london this weekend? I'm considering taking Monday off work and doing some shopping then instead. What should I do?

 oh, it's gone. sorry.

 why would you wear red on a friday?! surely you knew the consequences of your savage actions? how do you see at the moment, ross? are your wee eyeses all red and sore? like bloody pissholes in the snow?

 You must have loved it Ross. You're constantly complaining of lack of mansweat in your daily life.

 In an interesting development, I have become allergic to my contact lenses, apparently. Whoops.

 I've been to the New York Stock Exchange. We were there for closing. A bell rang, and everyone ran around like morons, then it was all over. It smelled of mansweat.

 I'm here for another... 7 hours. Goddammit. I went to the New York Stock Exchange yesterday with another guy from the office. We were shown around by a broker. It's a pretty amazing place. It's just this huge room (with american flags hanging on the walls) and 1366 people in it. Actually it's one huge room and a few smaller rooms next to it. There are no chairs, and basically at the sides of the room stand people who wait by the phone to get buy and sell orders. They get a call to buy shares of whatever, and they relay it to the guy who then goes to do it. He walks to something called a "post" which is a free standing circle of computer monitors reaching a few meters high, with about 5 people inside the circle and 5 people outside. Each person in a post trades between one and ten or so companies, so there are lots of posts dotted aruond the room. So he says to the person outside the post, I want to buy these shares, and he points to someone else nearby and says he wants to sell them, let's negotiate a price and we're done. Of course this is all very hectic and completely a waste of time. The NASDAQ does it all electronically and these guys know that they're doomed. Every one of them that I talked to gave me a speech on why their particular function couldn't properly be repliacted by a computer and why they can still "add value to their clients". So it was interesting. People in the office are blaming me for the market being down today because I'm wearing a red shirt.

 i'm going to give you a paint enema, wee man. forcibly.

 I got to work at 2:15 today. And I only have 45 minutes left until home time. It's like being a student.

 still bored.

 bored bored bored bored bored.

 I'm going home.

 Is this page working yet? I just ordered a gun for my PS2. I have the urge to shoot the shit out of some mofos.

 did anyone see a monkey come past here yesterday? small, hairy fella? likes climbing? no?

 I'll also be in Brum this weekend, bitch slapping pooky and drinking beers with banksy.

 you know it, baby. unfortunately, i'll be in birmingham this weekend, attempting some key-hole surgery on ross' ear with a paint-ball gun. and i'm in edinburgh the weekend after. who are we playing the weekend after that?

 Dave, aren't we're going to Wycombe this Saturday? He'll be there, will you? Is Herve Renard the most pornographic manager in the English League?

 I'm back on the BoA, cheers fonz. Next time i post i'll think of something interesting to say first. I don’t really know what I’m doing with this new blog stuff. I'm going to the Lake district for a race weekend tomorrow. I've got to run and cycle up mountains and canoe in lakes. It all has an endurance theme. It is going to be hell and i volenteered. What the fuck is wrong with me?

 You want a piece of me? Come get some.

 one of these days, ross, i'm going to catch up with you and hurt you real bad. how's saturday for you?

 I just spent an hour watching a gamespot panel discussion on how computer game graphics have progressed over the years. I am Geek + 4 now.

 I'm going home

 you can only do so much with your hands tied behind your back, can't you. metaphorically or otherwise, eh damo?

 You big Welsh bastard. I also failed to nob the Knightley last night, but I didn't feel like I was putting much effort in.

 i also failed to nob the knightley last night. i was too busy eating ratatouille. ra-ta-tou-ille!

 I'd say you were funny and talented Dave. And I am glad the damo "failed to nob" the Knightley last night. I've done been to the pub, and it has taken me two minutes to type this sentence. Bah.

 i just ate some ratatouille. cheers, lexie.

 i'd say that i was "funny and talented". well, "a bit funny" certainly.

 urlLink news Dave, at least you aren't the only one failing to nob the Knightley - I did last night...she's ok I suppose.

 She's my precious! To be honest I can't remember which of the cells I've chained her in - When I find her I'll send her your way but it's highly likely she'll be pretty fucked up...it took rather a long time to convince her she loved me.

 Well we all knew that already. Are you a lawyer yet? I'm going to the pub in a minute. I still live in hope of the fit bar maid returning. Come on damo, give her back.

 Dorothy from the Wizzard of Oz!

 Hello Lex, I was wondering if you were still alive. Have you found out who I look like yet?

 Hello? Is anybody there?

 yes, she wandered into my office just after seven and started complaining to people that she had a metal plate in her head. they knew to send for me. i had some interesting questions to answer this morning, i can tell you.

 Having spent 5 hours in the pub last night I came home to attempt something I have seen done on TV a few times. After 1 hour, 5 flies and plenty of frustration I succeeded in attaching a small paper aeroplane via thin line to the back of a blue bottle fly. It was a defining moment in my life and one I shall remember for years to come. My next effort will involve 5 or 6 flies with which I hope to stage some sort of Battle of Britain re-inactment. It's amazing what interests you whilst drunk! Did you manage to find lexie in the end last night big 'un?

 i was as professional as i've ever been in those days. the illegal spider racing was one thing, but i'll never, ever forget my short film about the hedgehog. i was the master of paint shop pro 4 and gif animator, so i was. i almost miss those days.

 Is that the word 'professional' used as an adjective to 'web developer'? After working at CIS I didn't think there was such a thing! Dave will explain, illegal spider racing and all.

 Oooh, I've been lent Ikiru on DVD. I knew this day would come.

 We professional web developers don't need lessons in that. Teach me something useful, Nemesis.

 It wasn't porn, it was a lesson in image sourcing and resizing in HTML.

 Oh. Now it's gone away. I'm not lying to impress people, honest.

 Ok, I can understand the ad for Takeshi Kitano DVDs... but why are we being offered the chance to save some stupid wildlife?

 Dude, I'll get sacked if you post stuff like that on here. And I probably won't be the only one.

 Here there be porn I see those image resize tags work though. This one enlarged from 90 x 70 px.

 How dare you drastically resize my image Dave. How would you like it if I resized something of yours? And there's is no point now telling me I got an invite when I quite clearly didn't, it's called lying and it's not cool. Anyway for those of you wondering what other amusing place names I happened to find on my travels you can look urlLink here. The photos of Bummer's Hill are still unfortunately in my camera. Dave did promise me some from the gay orgy he attended there last month, but has not been forthcoming with the goods. I recommend the urlLink original web site also.

 It's sunny....it's midweek...I just realised I'll be £800 better off than I thought this month...it can mean only one thing...drinking beers beers beers!

 My onion horroscope is pretty accurate this week. What am I still doing at work?

 no you are.

 Yes, I thought that about the translators earlier, until I realised that to translate Japanese to English, you'd need to enter the Japanese in kanji, or at least hiragana. And I wouldn't say that fucking the Daily Mail is out of character at all. Although fucking the Daily Male would be more in character. Ha de ha. Ha.

 wow, these on-line translators are bollocks. i saw that news item earlier today, and i found it grimly satisfying. some people may find this a little out of character for me, but: fuck the daily mail

 watashi-wa igiris-jin desu. dabido desu. nani da yo.

 http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?section_name=pub&aid=3918

 Sayonara, loi.

 Yes.

 Another good one phonetically is "manko"...some japs won't understand "what the hell"..."manko" is universally understood - japanersally more to the point.

 I found out why I couldn't get Zatoichi from Blockbuster - it wasn't out on DVD until last week. Stupido Blockbuster.

 that sounds spot on. an elderly villager says it in zatoichi. i pissed myself at that point.

 I'm having a little trouble with this, as I can't view Japanese properly on my machine at work. I'll have a shufti when I get home. However, I think the first one should be 'nan(i) da yo'. Nan, or sometimes nani, is 'what', 'da' is, informally, the existance of a thing, which isn't a verb in Japanese, and 'yo' adds emphasis at the end of a sentence. So it would be something like 'what (the hell) is that?', I think.

 1st one depends on where the emphasis in your accent is...gentle it means "what the hell"...if you emphasise (phonetically) the "ooooo" bit at the end it become more like "what the fuck" The second one is to commit severe "cunning linguist" on the mother "bitch" of your target. By severe I mean getting the head down there and causing nastiness to come out. Kani-Nabu-Chao-Chi-Bei is a phonetic equivalent of that in Chinese. All though this one is for doing bad things to the dead relatives of your target...(cue: some tiresome jokes from fonz!)

 well, the first thing is "what the hell?" or similar, and the second, i'm told, is the most offensive possible phrase in japanese. start with looking up the kanji for "your mother's dead ancestors" and work backwards.

 What does it mean, though? If I knew the English, I could look stuff up. Come on, you've piqued my interest now. Also, I wish my fucking interweb connection would stop signing me out of Blogger when I try to post.

 s'welsh for ian. it is. anyway, i tole you on the tube that it was either ian or yoan, and you said you reckoned it was ewan. so i suppose we'll just have to kill each other. ross, i've never seen my noise written down, i've only ever heard it, so i'm afraid that's the closest transliteration that i can manage. go on, find the kanji now.

 Yes, but I was closer then your "Ian", and you had the cheek to pass yours off as fact. More importantly, I knew you were wrong, which makes me keewwweelllll.

 wHAT DOES YOUR NOISE MEAN, THEN? i MIGHT WASTE SOME TIME LOOKING UP THE KANJI. tHIS IS HOW EVERYONE WILL TYPE IN THE FUTURE.

 you said he was called "ewan". that's not "yo-an". ross, if you were real, i'd kick your ass for being so stupid.

 Hmm, I think I just accidentally wrote a rant about King Arthur. Still, it wasn't very good, was it?

 I knew it! Welsh Actor Ioan Gruffudd (Pronounced YO-an GRIFF-ith)...

 Probably - he is a thieving barstard !

 Was it Dave?

 Just got a phone call from Lloyds TSB. Someone tried to use my Credit Card to buy a £750 camera in Canada last week ! Luckily they caught it and didnt let it through. I lost £40 though as the exchange rate dropped a lot before it was refunded. I think the insurance covers it though. Pain in the arse !

 That's just noise, Dave.

 I reckon a Monkey-Wolf-Fish-Boy has signed up to this blog and not posted anything. I reckon he's furiously blogging himself in the corner.

 manu ganegaushi

 Ikiru is the dictionary form, or present informal positive tense, of the verb to live, or exist. It looks like a group 2 (godan) verb, but is in fact a group 1 (ichidan), and so the present formal positive is ikirimasu, and not ikimasu as you'd expect. Look upon my works, ye mighty, and despair! Ozy-who-dias?

 Yeah, the bond fan has loads of kurosawa, including both those, but has thus far only lent me The Seven Samurai. I might steal Ikiru pretty shortly, though.

 james has it - he brought it round. he's left me with ikiru, which has no samurai in it, yet is still a kurosawa film. bizarre, non?

 Have you got Yojimbo on DVD? I want to see it.

 he looked a bit old and buggered in zatoichi, but i put that down to him being old and buggered. zatoichi is a good film. i watched yojimbo last night, and that is also a good film. but it made me want to watch sergio leone again.

 Today I have learned that the Takeshi in Takeshi's Castle is actually Takeshi Kitano. I also learned that he had a motorbike accident in 1994 and broke his face. Yes.

 i know. and i understand.

 I might shoot you in the nuts this weekend, Dave. You know, just because.

 i need a new word.

 i resized it, although not very well. it's just a width and height property in the img tag. today, i am rubbish. i need another weekend. although ideally not one spent being chased by bambos around some woods. although that'll have to do.

 If you right click on the picture and select 'properties', you can see the location.

 No, I haven't. I still need a computer case to actually build the machine before I can set it up. When I can be arsed, I'll find a cheapo case and put it together, then you can all give me useless, conflicting advice again.

 Who cleverly re-sized that image then, eh? Where is it hosted? I haven't managed to make struts work. But .NET does much the same thing, and that works a treat. Ross, did you ever set up a server and your own website? Or was our advice as useful as a chocolate thing that's not supposed to melt, but does because it's made of chocolate?

 tom, i sent you an invite ages ago to the board, but they expire after a few days i think, so if you missed it at the time then that was it. but you're here now, and that's what matters etc. so tired, so sleepy. struts are QAF.

 That is him. I can confirm it.



 OK, point taken. I will try and use your/you're in the correct context, except when abusing Dave because it's even more offending when it sounds like it's from a fat, dumb, terrorised American. Can we put HTML in here?

 from now on, that's how you program.

 I am so tired of this Robot bull-shit. I'm ready to go home now, Mr Hat.

 That made me laugh Ross...I'm going to admit myself tonight I think

 Also, 'bollocks' means 'postage stamp'. Go on, Yoav, ask someone to lick your bollocks.

 there's an episode of friends where rachel shouts "he touched my fanny!". it made me laugh in a bad way.

 In America, what they call a fanny is your arse, not your minge. (Ho ho)

 i knew that he wouldn't have the balls. although, strangely, he does have the nutsack.

 Why? I'll just do what I do every year - concentrate on my team for three weeks before forgetting about it, only to be reminded that I was playing when the final results come in and I'm somewhere near the bottom. I'm pretty sure I've never even made a transfer in fantasy football, because I never pay attention long enough to need to.

 Quick, let's make Ross go to urlLink www.tffo.co.uk and sign up for a fantasy football team.

 i have a mighty team of mighties. i shall win, undoubtedly.

 This fantasy football lark is hard. And I'm probably supposed to be doing some work.

 I've just been skinny-dipping with Avril Lavigne, the fit bird from reception. It was fun.

 tffo AT mr-jenner.co.uk gets you through Dave.

 Doom 3 - now there's some scary shit. I'm surprised it's had such a negative response so far. I've only played a couple of hours, but it seems awesome like several hotdogs so far.

 have you clicked on mini-league, lamo?

 I'm not even in the league at the moment I don't think as I can't see anyone?

 Personally, I'd have opted for something like "There's a challenge I can't refuse", but at least Lazer's version makes some sense. Our league might have as many as 13 people in soon. So if anyone has the ability to sign up 7 more, we'd get a free trophy at the end of the season.

 Dave, Fonz and Ross have probably suffered a heart attack as a result of your double negative. I'm surprised you didn't not know this!

 Well, I couldn't not accept a challenge like that from my nemesis. Twill do it tonight. Was intending to go out and try and put away some 30 year old Italian language student but, considering this and the fact I'm off on a stag this weekend, it can wait till next week. Is the double negative alright for you there Ross?

 Damn, I forgot all about Bridgestock. I guess that means I'm not going. Bells. Tom, we need you to sign up to the urlLink fan foot league, and we need you to do it today ! The season starts tomorrow, so get with the program and round out our league for us. You can't rest on your laurels from last time when you claim to have finished 4th without managing your team. Lies.

 I went to a strip joint with work last night...it was great. I am hungover as hell today though - tonight I go to Bridgestock and a weekend of partying with 30 or so other people...not sure I can handle it at the moment. And the weather is shit

 According to Ananova, Millenium Prayer is the worst Number One ever. Well, it's no Wake Up by Rage Against The Machine, is it? It is? Oh.

 6. blade. razor

 There was quite a good article on the onion by a guy from Gillette that definitely pre-empted that one manx. I think it was entitled "Fuck it, we're going to five blades"

 i've just had a revolutionery idea that will definately, definately make me a millionaire. 5. blade. razor

 I thought of sun cream in a spray bottle first. I did, I tells ya.....

 I can back you up on that manx. You also thought of the washing machine with three drums, which is still waiting to pop I think.

 I still maintain that four-blade razors were my idea

 It's about time, Bambos. Although Dave did mention that article yesterday, you big, hairy, razor-ruining bastard. Incidently, I have a four-blade razor now. It's like living in the fucking future.

 Opera is a good venue to experience "culture" certainly...I still don't think you can beat the ramblings of Carwyn whilst he is in the messy depths of an alcohol induced dementia though.

 That's mental. Some people have too much time on their hands.

 urlLink http://www.thebricktestament.com/ The Bible, acted out in Lego. How veddy odd. I 'recommend' The Old Testament/Law......it's very Eddie.....

 i'm about to go to the opera. i'm not kidding.

 Oooh, so can I. Nice. I'm here, I just can't be arsed to do anything. I don't talk to people before lunch anymore. It's too early.

 Ooh, I can quick-edit posts now. Where is everyone today?

 By 'the guy being sick', you mean the guy bending over to scratch his ankle, right? Unless it's invisible sick.

 i might start doing lynndies at the opera. or possibly at some drunken scotsmen. i'm not sure that i can handle the culture.

 Is this urlLink Richard Kipping doing a Lynndie? urlLink I think I found one of urlLink Taufik as well! urlLink Note the guy being sick and is it me or is the bird sitting there quite hot?

 it's true. my java is shocking.

 Yer well, when he finds out about YOUR crack habit too Dave YOU'RE really going to be in the shit, aren't you? I think the grammar is correct in that one? I'm really shit, some have compared the poorness of my English with that of Dave's Java!

 http://badgas.co.uk/lynndie/

 uh-oh - dubya's bound to have someone reading this board. and now the C-A-T is out of the B-A-G. we'll all hang. or fry.

 The A-Team one is a classic. Does anyone fancy terrorising the Americans? We could set off a bomb in one of their cities or something, you know, just for kicks. We could then look on while they invade some African nation with oil as a result.

 Add me in bizatch! I want to check out the competition

 You have a crack habit...I'm going to enroll you at the priory...although you're paying.

 you have a disorder, damo. i'm going to edit you.

 Ok have picked my "Super" team...address is damo_beastAThotmial.com They are called Dead Men Walking like the Euro Team

 i've been wondering about urlLink this myself for some time now. and the a-team one is brilliant.

 i think that's it - it's the LZW compression nonsense. might as well use PNGs instead, though - they're better, and free.

 OK I'll think about it. What's the deal with GIFs these days? Your allowed to put them on web sites aren't you? You just have to pay if you want to use the algorithm in your software.

 point scoring starts about 12.30 on saturday, with the big gay spurs/liverpool game, so that would appear to be about the deadline. i think i can add teams to the mini-league at any point. i think...

 I know it's the sort of thing that I'll tire of a few matches in though...(excuses out of the way) I'll sort it out sometime today!

 As suspected the BBC have made a mistake on the urlLink Cambridge United page of their urlLink web site. Shall I email them in an irate fan style. How late can I leave my doomed decision to enter the big gay ff league?

 I was going to play but I see Sawston Rovers isn't among one of the teams from which you can choose players. As a result I cannot choose myself, Spence, Saggs, Shoulders, Steve, Sam Simon or Big Dave and so can't really see myself picking any team that will do very well. Although last time I did come fourth having forgotten about my team three days into the season.

 i'm pretty sure that united were at home last night - we usually lose at home to orient, so that's a point of profit right there. manx and aiden are on board the fanfoot train. where's your entry, damo?

 I watched I,Robot and Catwoman a couple of nights ago on DVD. I,Robot was better than I expected whilst Catwoman was...well...absolutely shit.

 that'll be the "security". i'm about to add a batch of leaguers. are you playing, tom? head for www.tffo.com if so.

 Everyone knows you should wait for Service Pack 1 for Service Pack 2 to come out before installing Service Pack 2 for XP...christ Ross, what were you thinking?

 I used my hotmail, (fallon_paul2@hotmail.com) mini-league me up

 I installed Service Pack 2 for XP last night, like a good little Microsoft minion. Now my machine hangs a lot for no reason. Nice one, Bill.

 That's nothing, the mighty Gills beat Leeds last night at home. Myabe we won't suck so hard this season. Manx, did you use your hotmail address to sign up to Fan Foot? If not, you need to let Dave know which e-mail address you used, and he'll put you in the mini-league.

 F*** Me Dave, the U's actually managed a home draw last night! Although there seems to be some confusion on 'the Internet' over where they played. Isn't Brisbane Road Orient's home ground?

 Hmm, i'm unlikely to maintain interest all season enough to keep changing players every week. anyway I picked all the same 11 i have in my work fantasy team then i added 7, which gives me a pretty balanced squad anyway. do i need to be added to a mini leage then?

 That was my thinking, until I realised I could afford more than 11 really good players. The trick is, you can select players for Saturday AND Sunday games, so you can get all 18 of your players to play each week if you get it right. But if seven of them are bollocks, you'll only get 11 of them playing.

 Re: Fantasy League Is there any reason not to just buy 11 really good players and make the other 7 a bunch of cheap Crystal Palace losers. Do only 11 score for you at a time?

 No...who do you think I am...Mary f***ing Poppins?!

 i've seen you trying to work out what hitler would have done, damo, but then aren't you supposed to do the opposite?

 In light of your "famine" related post...the "reactions" column about Sudan on the Onion is quite amusing

 That reminds me, I'll be flapping my wings over Somalia tonight to drop off food supplies and other aid packages - has anyone got any cans of food to donate?

 Give me £20 Dave

 we couldn't help it - once fonz saved the first rainforest, it was like an addiction for us. now it's just a world of charity round these parts.

 Hmm, I see the BOA now has ads at the top Iran Earthquake relief. have you all turned into a bunch of fucking tree huggers

 ross is the one on the left.

 This fight looks pretty cool! urlLink http://www.ananova.com/news/story/sm_1051853.html

 i love that spud-faced pigdog. not vin diesel.

 Is it Vin Diesel shouting "Welcome to the Xander zone?"

 "Science has unlocked the gates to the unknown, and now only one man stands between Hell and Earth. And no, it's not Wayne Rooney." So say Game about Doom 3. Ho ho.

 he would have got the email that banksy sent, and the one i followed it up with, so it's up to him i think.

 "Ross wins" is the phrase you're after. I've said it before and I'll say it again, everyone should sign up to the Premiership at urlLink www.tffo.co.uk . Do you think we should drop manx a note about it?

 I took an umbrella. I rule.

 where are the paint-tanks and paint-artillery-strikes? i am a very wet boy this morning. the light shower when i left the flat quickly became a torrential downpour. my shoes are not, it turns out, waterproof, and nor am i. it's unpleasant.

 I'd also quite like it if there were medics who ran around wiping paint off for you - If they manage it within 30 seconds you live...obviously this is a shit idea but it would allow me to shout "Reviiive me" as well as the statutory "I neeeed Ammo"

 As I lack the skill and know how of those that play paint ball all the time the only real chance I had of victory against a team of profs last year was to purchase a shedload of ammo. Fed up with losing, on the last game myself and three friends spent around £30 each on ammunition. We were protecting the base...we spent the whole game firing continuously...there's nothing like hearing 4 or 5 of the opposition shouting "You'll run out of ammo soon" from behind a tree then 5 minutes later see them make a last ditch charge into a hail of gunfire. Next time I hope to discover the No_Clipping Mode so I can run through trees. I don't think I'll bother with God_Mode though as it will probably make it all a bit too easy.

 it's from spaced. i said it a lot that day. that and "ow".

 Is that a joke off Frasier Yoav?

 I almost got shot in the nads. Luckily, my cock got in the way.

 "You shot me in the bollocks Tim." "Like I said - no hard feelings."

 Did anyone get shot in the nads?

 I'll have you know I was a fucking ninja in one paintball game, when I single-handedly stormed a temple and took out four bastards, and then got some stirling backup from Wee Dave and his sister, and we took out another two or three. Of course, when I got shot and went back to the elimination zone, there were only three opposing players there. You do the math.

 Tom has slipped back into his naughty your/you're ways. He must be punished.

 they're sly, these dawgs. still, ross and i heroically hid in our base during one game, and were shot to shit in the bushes. they gunned up my knees, the bastards.

 Do you remember I got done for pistol whipping those guys who wiped paint off themselves and then shot me back at close range. No point going if your going to have to play against a bunch of chavs.

 i am a bad, bad soldier. i'm too big a target, and crouching makes my knees hurt. i got the cack shot out of me. still, we were playing against a bunch of cheating army-boys, who HAD A FUCKING PASSWORD and wiped paint off themselves when there was no marshal around. it wasn't as much fun as i'd hoped. but dave was a winner. a WINNER.

 Got it from Game...they tend to deliver between 3 and 7 days before UK release date -tis good. Got a mail today that it was dispatched for next day delivery this morning...Think the site is urlLink www.game.uk.com . Only time I buy games is if I want to do the multiplayer stuff...else I would have downloaded Doom.

 Did Ross get shot in the hand four seconds into a half hour game?

 Did you have as much success at paint-balling this time as you had at the Dragon's Lair in Brentwood?

 yes, it's going to hurt in many, many ways. but you only live once, eh? and at least i get to choose the manner of my passing. or is that my pissing?

 Dave, apparently you are an Edinburgh virgin and your going for the first time with Billy! I must warn you when me and Patrick went up there for a few days we got pissed on the plane on the way up and didn't return to sobriety until at least twelve hours after we'd crossed south of the border. This was mainly due to Bartram showing off his enhanced student lifestyle where if he wasn't at the radio station he was either in an establishment that specialised in the sale of alcohol or at home where his fridge contents consisted solely of Stella, Vodka and Cranberry Juice! Plus you are going for some Whiskey tasting do!

 what aboot far cry? and when am i getting my half life 2?

 I've played it for about 7 hours now in an optimum environment of small dark room encrusted with speakers on my own and the more I play it the more boring it gets. There is literaly no variety - all the rooms look the same the monsters are dull and very very stupid. The weapons are crap and its not scary. Its pretty but not ridiculously so and it really is a big tech demo to make people licence the engine. As such it should be free and you shouldn't buy it. Just download the fucker and get bored with it and imagine what companies will do with the engine. So there.

 doom cops: the taste of mars justice.

 No-one should buy doom cops its rubbish.

 Damo, where are you getting Doom from? Play still say they're getting it on Friday.

 Yeah, it's not the sort of game you play with other people around though to properly experience...it probably takes a reasonable amount of time to get into as well. Either way it's got to be better than Soldner which sucked complete monkey balls.

 No-one can come close to my 4 million in one week Keanu-a-thon. No-one. Ever.

 i believe that i have made my daq-tactics clear in the past. i am still living in hope of a hostile knightley-takeover.

 Did anyone notice Matt getting 2 million squid in the 'Daq in one week this week? I think he wasn't far off three million too. I reign supreme in the League Of Kings.

 i played some doom 3 over the weekend at dave's. i was hella-disappointed.

 I just had an email saying my copy of Doom3 is arriving tomorrow...cool. Doubt I'll be able to play it though as turning on my computer for any length of time results in the room temperature breaking 40 degrees...heat and rotting flesh don't mix too well.

 I think I may be allergic to mine....every now and again they hurt.
