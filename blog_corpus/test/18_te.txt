 The word alone is hard to spell. It is not one of the words that would freely fall off my fingers nor tongue in an everyday conversation. Ennnnn cooooo mmmmiiiiuuuummmmmm!! LOL Anyway - yesterday was our first foray into the Nuyorican with tension and some drama in tow. The tension was primarily self brought upon myself and I see no good reason for having it. This was well after the fact of having a successful evening. The night started well and everything went better then my pessimistic ass expected. Instead of beefing about the bullshit.... " ok, this is the problem - noted - think of solution " That has been my attitude towards many things as of lately. Mara started the show last night and I can't help but say that she impresses me everytime I see her perform. My favorite host ( I have a side of me that will always give back ever since my first trek into Bar 13 ) did well. I did not see one ounce of him nervous and he did not aggravate me. That is definitely a good sign. All the tribute poets were awesome and I can't tell you how proud I am of Ray and every other person involved in making this show great. I had to call Ray personally and commend him on a job well done. In staying away from the rehearsals and talks of poems to read - the show was taken several notches above my usual expectations. If most of you noticed last night... I kept an eye of a hawk on Julio on the door. I don't know him and his reputation of skimming might come into play. Yet, I was not playing. I kept track of any and all paying customers. I counted a total tally of 56 patrons with 41 paying. Julio counted 40 paying customers. So we were on the same page and I left happy. This event was my first event organized with musicians and others with there fingers stirring the pot. It was hard but well worth it with a good show. I was sad that some people didn't show up but we still had a great time. Seems that the Nuyorican loved the format of the show and they look forward to a good relationship in the future. Life is good. Thanks guys Peace, Love, Porkchops

 Everyone has a certain style of writing and getting their tidbits on mindful rants out to their enduring public. You hear Unconscious mutterings, pumpkin seeds, surreal moment # so and so. Welcome to my little world. Fish Flakes #1 I used to write these daily e-mails called "fishisms" and they snowballed into a huge following. My Blog turned into Fishism 2.0 .......I guess. Anyway, Stood away from the Poetry folk yesterday as things seem to really get more on my nerves then the norm. So, in the interest of keeping my sanity. I headed to the dog show. Ahhhhh.....little doggies being pampered more then a Puerto Rican family in the ghetto has always amused me. The handlers of some of these dogs scream " arrogance". They walk and handle these dogs like royalty and rather have you grovel at their feet. " Oh mighty Bichon Frise, I am not worthy of your puffy little white hairdoo - please pee on my leg" I love to look at the handlers and put them in their place with one look. You know the look I am talking about?? The look that says....... "if I wanted to, I could catch you outside in the dark and you would see the life leaving your body" I love dogs and have steadily thought about getting a Pug. Thing is - that little dog would go with me everywhere. It would be a staple at Bar 13, Acentos and anywhere else literary. I can't get a little dog and leave it home. That would be mean of me. I was really out of it since last week and I am feeling better. Yesterday was la bomba that made me reach the "fuck it" plateau. I had to deal with some Louder stuff and CWP stuff. In keeping my glass half full. They made sense in what they said. Even though I don't agree with it- it made some sense. Tonight might be my first Acentos that I have missed. I have to actually go to a Wake ( viewing ) of a friend that passed away last week. Young chic crossing the street and didn't quite see the SUV barreling down. 5000 pounds of metal against a human body of 130 pounds - not much competition. After hearing the news of her death and dealing with my own issues, I floundered at the edge of that depression shit. I just usually think and stay away from everybody. I was even thinking about how life is short and you can't waste it. I have been so caught up in this poetry shit and I was thinking about some things. So much poetry, programs, events, readings, books to read. I felt that my life was passing me by. I was so caught up in everything , it was hard for me to live " MY " life. Of course, shit just clicked during the weirdest conversation and I grew to believe something. " I am living my life. I am doing something I love to do" I could die tomorrow and I knew that I could die and say that I was following my dream. I am doing ok today. I feel a little better and I have to deal with people and be more receptive to shit. Maybe even respect their views on things. Yet, I am not working for the glory of others. That is my case and it is closed.

 Infect the clouds with your smile Burn the sky with your laugh battle the sun for true brightness on clear days we will smile with you 2004 isn't that great

 Long post through a migraine.... I have steadily made it public that I am glad I came into my own with a bunch of motherfuckers that put craft of poetry before performance. If you have shit work and perform the hell out of it- it makes no point to even write. I can't front and say that I am a so-so performer. I can rock that stage and I have the utmost confidence in saying I do. This means that I have to work on the quality of the words that I drop on my page. Last night was my experience with Def Poetry and being there slightly skewed my previous opinion; as pompous as it was I might add. One of my biggest problems were the lack of new voices intertwined with major repeat performances. I was not happy to hear people taping for the 3rd time in the 4 year history of DPJ. I even slightly offended one of my good friends with some comments that I made without thinking. I was angry and miffed and instead of supporting her unconditionally; stupidity took over. I have apologized to her directly and I do it here. " I am sorry V ". When I got to DPJ, it was 1:15 pm. It was strange to see not one person standing in line for a show. Turns out the show was on Wednesday night and I was there feeling really lousy. I sat down to stew some anger but also think of what strings I can pull. Pull, yank and tug and I got a poets pass and that made my evening really sweet. No lines, no muss nor fuss. Even when Rich got there and he was about 3 miles from the door, I walked him in through the back door. Yes folks, my bouncer experience came in handy and the back door searching proved handy for Rich. Shit, I even walked Matt through the back. I think the shows are nothing new. I was not terribly moved by some of the poetry. The poets I gravitated to were clearly the older one's. Don't get me wrong, most of the poets were good but could you compare Faraji Salim to Martin Espada?? Could you compare Flowmentalz to Yousef Komunyakaa?? Could you even put Speech in the same room as Reg E. Gaines?? It was a good night for most of the poets. The Poetic Rockstars were out there and it was a good time. I gratuitously borrowed (stole) a set list of every poet that has performed through all ten shows. I will get it to this list to take bets to see who will or will not make the cut. All in all, my perspective has changed somewhat and I am kinda torn as to what benefits DPJ will give the poetry community. As for the poets themselves they reap the benefits with press, popularity, exposure and many future paying gigs. I wish I was the booker for DEF POETRY for a few shows. I know the show wouldn't do that well because I will cater to true poetry buffs. The ultimate Def Poetry Show for me......... Ultimate Show: Jimmy Santiago Baca Piri Thomas Tony Brown Victor Hernandez Cruz Cheryl Boyce Taylor Sonia Sanchez Martin Espada Good experience Peace

 In one of those moods today. Went to sleep at 8:30pm but woke up at 1 am and stood awake. I have alot on my mind. I don't know If I am actually hating this year on Def Poetry Jam. Wow. The previous years I never paid it any mind but this year it is bothering me that I have heard of major repeat performances. I will always support every poet within or around my circle and I have nothing against them. Yet, the booker at DPJ needs some knowledge as to who is on the scene. From the top of my head I can think of most performances being repeats. I guess Stan Lathan pimping our community is something that I am taking kinda personal. It press right??? Well - not all press is good press. More on my feelings later. Right now, I have been really miffed over several things. Peace

 I have always prided myself in making anyone that frequents casa pescatore as comforable as possible. I want them to make sure they feel at home as they will feel in their prospective residence. Yesterday- I hope I succeeded. The masses all congregated on Perry Ave with what many consider " Extreme Prejudice". 4:30pm was the time my best friend Eric and his son NuNu came over with a huge pan of Baked ziti. The tables were set and I had all the food that I cooked and the bells were ringing crazy. Before I could blink - My best Friend from Florida walked through the door and that made me smile. I missed that motherfucker so much. The bonus was him bringing his wife along. She is expecting and this is the closest I could get to being an uncle. I spoiled that girl with tray after tray of food and tiramisu. From Oscar to Rich - Tom and Mike - Roger, Lynne, Danny, Amalia, Herman, John, Jessica, Abena, Diane, Ed , Seve, And a whole bunch of other people that I forgot. I was pretty happy with the turnout and the food that came through my table. Buffalo Chicken wings, sausage bread, Cornbread Chicken wings, Baked ziti, Turkey, Shrimp, Chili, Vietnamese spring rolls, Pork dumplings, chicken rolls, Popeyes chicken, Three kinds of rice, Corona, heineken, soda and just everything else under the sun. So in keeping on top of everything. I got to see just the last 44 seconds of the game. I had very little interest because I have a deep hatred for both teams so my night consisted of playing host, waiter, gopher. I think the best thing about last night was the diversity of friends. I had the "poet" folk enjoying everything. I had the "ghetto" folk actin a fool. I had the "loud family" thing going on. It was great to have them all under one roof and it was probably the most successful SuperBowl party to date. Well, Off to bigger and better things. Peace

 So many of us got it good and people continue to talk shit. You have a job, family, health, and 98% of you have the ability to write awesome poetry. A good friend of mines went through some shit yesterday and it ticked me off. I mean I was genuinely angry. I never thought that I would be so upset over something that I thought would have been petty back in the day but times a changing. I have a busy day today but here is a quick thing while I move to the future. I joke around with people's races but I never pass judgement on your race, culture, ethnicity, background. I respect everything about everyone because I appreciate the respect in return. If anyone has a remote possibility of saying something biased, racist, anti-semitic.... please make sure it's not around me. I am not white but I will defend my white friends with everything in my arsenal. I am not black but I will fight anyone that will try to put down my black folk. I am not Jewish but I will hurt anyone that belittles them. I am latino and I will definitely do everything possible to hurt you if you attempt to hurt me. Fish

 Nah. Just joking. I am not really in a mood to write about some dude cumming on a girls face and she acts like it's the sexiest thing that has ever happened on God's green earth. I actually think it's kinda stupid. Nuff said. Decent day yesterday. Another installment of "Raise the Red Tent". I actually have the book and I am going to try and get the whole thing read this week before I give it back to Maria next Monday. I hope it's a good read. The energy was a little bit better yesterday compared to the last couple of shows. 30 paying patrons with about 49 total in attendance. I am keeping track of how many people come through. We need more people at 13 so the marketing blitz continues. I wanted to leave early yesterday but stood until the end after seeing " Wild Fever " get on stage and do their thing. It was a fitting tribute to this "tent' series. Elana has some serious writing skills. Yesterday she showed a broad range in her set and I was really impressed. I never like her poetry when I first came on the scene since I thought screaming and ranting was the call to order. Once I started pursuing the craft and literary excellence that we strive for, Elana is as close as anyone else. Obena rocked the Q & A portion and she asked every question that was milling about the brain. They had one line ( with the ever present repetition ) that stuck to me. " When will we un-learn our brilliance?". I love that line! Most of the time I always feel, the more we increase our knowledge, the more we increase our sorrow. How can we find our happiness by un-learning all our knowledge that has harnessed so much unhappiness?? It's just hard to know about everything that is wrong in this world and still try to keep a happy face. Anyway...... Everything is good. Tomorrow will be another erotic entry. Any subjects you would want me to touch on?? Possible subjects: Threesomes Midget sex Pregnant women sex Interracial animal sex Geriatric sex FACIALS!!!!! Swallowing Perfect Blow jobs Bad Blow Jobs Anal sex Golden showers Big penis or small penis ? Hair or no hair? Fat dude or skinny dude? Pick it and the Love Fish will write about it OK I am bored Peace, Love, Porkchops Fish

 When I was first given the opportunity to e-mail the outside world from my job I acted a total fool. Not too far off from what I do now but I was a little bit over the edge. I tended to give more attention to shock value over the quality of my writings. Most of the topics of my e-mails ( Fishisms ) were my endless pursuit of the perfect Blowjob. Since more then a few people offend very easily read this blog I can't write about that. So, I will write about Buttlicking and so on. Yes folks, the one thing that will keep a woman happy and will never let her stray. Oh yea, like if ya motherfuckers out there don't do that. A man denying that he licks his woman's butt is either lying or he just refuses to give his woman the bliss that she is entitled to. I don't remember my first time I engaged in this illicit activity. Shit, I barely remember the last and even first time I ever went down on a girl. I just know that I am damned good at it. You see, I perpetuate that myth that fat dudes have to compensate. I am not going to rock you for 1 hour. You are lucky if you get a good 5 solid strokes out of me. Yet........ If I get my tongue between your legs - I will not come up for at least an hour. Then, my tongue will gratuitously grace your butthole with some slow methodic long vertical licks. So if you are on your back... Start all the way on the bottom and just lick slowly all the way up and flick the clit. You see, that is the trick. You have to put pressure on the clit and flick it. Both her legs should flinch wildly - if so, you is the man ( or woman ). I have met some dudes that refuse to go down on women. Of course they are the single fuckers with no intentions on satisfying anyone but themselves. We call them the "three stroke Ponies". I never understood how some men can actually get with women and start the whole erotic thing and not satisfy the women. Oh, and then the dudes play crazy..... " damn , I wonder why she hasn't called me back"?. Well, maybe because you didn't go down on her, you didn't shower, You shoved your tongue so far down her throat you gave her heartburn, You had trouble putting on the Old dry condom, she wasn't wet, You stroked three times and it was over. THEN, You got the nerve to ask " Was that good for you ma?". OF course the mothering instincts kick in and she says " Yes papi, it was good ". You call your boys and exclaim " Dawg, I just rocked this chic hard core ". You head home and revel in your last conquest. Meanwhile, she gets home and she has the black marker and erases you from her black book, erases you from the PDA, Erases you from the cell phone, Changes her house number and changes her cell. The voice mail at her job will always be on. She re-connects her Caller I.D and answering machine. Don't get it twisted, ALLLLLL of her homegirls will know that you are garbage in bed. All of this because you didn't lick the butt-hole. So, if you want some tips... read on young brothers and sisters. Tips for the perfect sexual tryst 1- Don't be in a rush. Even is he/she is naked, that doesn't mean you are getting laid. 2- It's all about teasing and being slow. Kiss the neck and lick everything within your reach. Literally lay the person on the back and lick everything possible. Don't concentrate on the genital area, lick there but don't stay there. This is where you tease 3- Use the hands softly and as much as possible. Play with her hair when you are licking the chest. Kinda massage the back of her head and give her hair a soft tug. If she likes her hair being tugged, she will moan, if she doesn't she will stay shut. 4- When the guy is going down on you, play with his hair/head. Guys love that. Shit, I LOVE THAT! Why you think I have all my hair now. Play with it carajo. 5 Don't be shy to whisper dirty little things in the ears. After teasing for about an hour or two ( licking, sucking, fingering, nibbling ) - whisper things like this but use confidence " I want you sooo bad " " Mmmmmmmm...... you smell good " ( breathe deep in the ear ) " How bad do you want it ?" " You are sooooo wet " If you don't get a phone call the next day, hang up your shoes and turn your card in buddy. You are now worthless Peace, Love, Porkchops DR FISH PHD The love fish

 Took a nice day off from the world today. I need one of those every once in a while. I specifically left my day free of all appointments because I didnt want to be obligated to go anywhere. If I would have stood home, I would have spoken to people and my day wouldnt have been mines. So, the hooptie was filled with supreme gasoline and the I-87 and I became one. It felt good to just bounce and enjoy the drive. Well, last night was a great evening with something historical in the making. Louder then words made its debut at the Bowery Poetry club. I cant tell you anything negative at the moment. Guy has hatched a plot for something huge and I am glad he got his finger on it. I can see the masses trying to steal this idea but we know it was born in the mind of a incindiery maniac. The show was insane. I loved the format because it was something new. Guy and his borg melded Poetry and Poet politics to give an attentive audience a first hand look into a poets brain. No more trying to get the poets attention after a slam to get a better idea where that poem came from. Now, they answer questions from the audience and the fireStarter Guy himself. Guy started the show with the necessary diatribe as to where the idea came from, his views, his opinions, and all that is him. After seeing Jessica, Mara and Luis read some awesome Poetry- up came a Diva Named Roger and a republican that goes the name of Taylor. Roger did a few new pieces and kicked an oldie. That blue sex prodigy is a piece that he loves but for some reason I am not digging that piece. Taylor came and covered several pieces and handled his time well. With the featured poets taking there places on stage to be interviewed by Guy ( bad cop ), Eric G ( Good cop ), and Helen ( the smart cop )......the fiesta started. I dont care what anyone say but Taylor handled himself wonderfully. Rog was a boxer with his guard up the whole fight without throwing one punch. I honestly think that Guy intimidated the shit out of Rog and he was so ready that he looked for the shots instead of mounting an offense. The question of context in a poem came up and Taylor used the example about writing about rape. To make a long story short, this one dude came p and it was taken in a totally different direction. The show was great and I am looking forward to the next one. Some small tweaks and changes to make it more audience friendly and this is going to be the next big thing. Fuggit Time to go Peace, Love, que se joda

 .....for three hours only. relax, I am not doing time - ever! I dont know everything but I know what makes me happy. Yesterday was my first trek back to Rikers island for my third term teaching a poetry workshop. Last term was an interesting collaboration between several CWP interns and myself. I have no clue whats going on this term ( with CWP ) but going in on a Friday and getting their immediate trust is a beautiful thing. In going to Rikers about a year and a half ago, I had no clue what I was going to teach and how I was going to do it. I always say truthfully that I am new to this field and I have alot to learn to be on the same level as anyone that has been reading poetry since who knows when. The first term was fly by night, the second was slightly focused. I can give this term a much more solid view of poetry. Compared to the first day Rog left me there by myself, I have researched enough to be a better teacher. On Thursday, my feet took me to the centennial birthday celebration for Pablo Neruda. The only one worth mentioning was Martin Espada and Illan Stavans. They discussed the impact Neruda had on them and read several translations of Neruda. An open panel discussion followed with a wine and cheese Reception. It felt really really good to Have Martin Come out with his hand to shake mines and then he hugs me. Even though Martin is not my all time favorite poet/author- he is up there and it feels good to say I know him Well, with Neruda fresh on my mind, what better way to start another term at Rikers? I did some research because I havent stolen a Pablo Neruda book yet and picked the perfect poems to start the class. It was Nerudas three poems. Oh man, The first one is called poetry,this was perfect for the class. Read on my young Schmucks...... THREE POEMS PABLO NERUDA POETRY And it was at that age...Poetry arrived in search of me. I don't know, I don't know where it came from, from winter or a river. I don't know how or when, no, they were not voices, they were not words, nor silence, but from a street I was summoned, from the branches of night, abruptly from the others, among violent fires or returning alone, there I was without a face and it touched me. I did not know what to say, my mouth had no way with names my eyes were blind, and something started in my soul, fever or forgotten wings, and I made my own way, deciphering that fire and I wrote the first faint line, faint, without substance, pure nonsense, pure wisdom of someone who knows nothing, and suddenly I saw the heavens unfastened and open, planets, palpitating planations, shadow perforated, riddled with arrows, fire and flowers, the winding night, the universe. And I, infinitesmal being, drunk with the great starry void, likeness, image of mystery, I felt myself a pure part of the abyss, I wheeled with the stars, my heart broke free on the open sky. You can't get a better poem to start a class then this. The guys were really digging the poem and I explained to them how poetry changed my life. I showed them Neruda and then read one of my poems. They were given a hugely wide spectrum on what to expect. Everything in between myself all the way back to who knows when. I lead them in a small writing exercise to write something in under 5 mins to tell me something about themselves and have it memorized. I stole the idea from Taylor's workshop. I wasn't really going to have them memorize it but I wante to jostle their brains. Mad students yesterday and they were all writing. When the 5 minutes were up, I didn't have to pick volunteers, they were all ready willing and able to read. Next Friday I am going to bring in Some Willie Perdomo. The class is a good mix and they will get a feel of Smoking Lovely Well, On that note. I am off. Tonight is the jump-off for "Louder then Words". I am actually reading for them next Saturday. I am happy for Guy, that motherfucker can't stay away from this even if he wanted to. He picked the perfect people to help him with this project. I am a firm believer that you have to surround yourself with good people in order to have shit work correctly. Peace , Love , Poetry. Porkchops P.S These are the other Pablo Poems SADDEST POEM I can write the saddest poem of all tonight. Write, for instance: "The night is full of stars, and the stars, blue, shiver in the distance." The night wind whirls in the sky and sings. I can write the saddest poem of all tonight. I loved her, and sometimes she loved me too. On nights like this, I held her in my arms. I kissed her so many times under the infinite sky. She loved me, sometimes I loved her. How could I not have loved her large, still eyes? I can write the saddest poem of all tonight. To think I don't have her. To feel that I've lost her. To hear the immense night, more immense without her. And the poem falls to the soul as dew to grass. What does it matter that my love couldn't keep her. The night is full of stars and she is not with me. That's all. Far away, someone sings. Far away. My soul is lost without her. As if to bring her near, my eyes search for her. My heart searches for her and she is not with me. The same night that whitens the same trees. We, we who were, we are the same no longer. I no longer love her, true, but how much I loved her. My voice searched the wind to touch her ear. Someone else's. She will be someone else's. As she once belonged to my kisses. Her voice, her light body. Her infinite eyes. I no longer love her, true, but perhaps I love her. Love is so short and oblivion so long. Because on nights like this I held her in my arms, my soul is lost without her. Although this may be the last pain she causes me, and this may be the last poem I write for her. CLENCHED SOUL We have lost even this twilight. No one saw us this evening hand in hand while the blue night dropped on the world. I have seen from my window the fiesta of sunset in the distant mountain tops. Sometimes a piece of sun burned like a coin in my hand. I remembered you with my soul clenched in that sadness of mine that you know. Where were you then? Who else was there? Saying what? Why will the whole of love come on me suddenly when I am sad and feel you are far away? The book fell that always closed at twilight and my blue sweater rolled like a hurt dog at my feet. Always, always you recede through the evenings toward the twilight erasing statues.

 It's funny, I was going to write some shit about that young kat that was caught trying to cross a check point in the middle east with a bomb strapped to his chest. The kid was between 14- 16. He was reported to be somewhat " slow " and he was given 22 dollars and promised 72 virgins when he died. This made me think, I am going to give some one 30 dollars and promise them 80 virgins and give them a gun - I wonder what would happen? Anyhow, In segue to Oscar's blog and what he mentioned about some of the Bronx tragedies that have befallen my fellow Bronxites - I wondered about some things. When you hear things in the Media with Anthony Baez, Happyland, Valentines day Prospect Massacre ( the only massacre in the Bronx ) how about the things you never hear??? For every murder, suicide, tragedy, accident you hear on the news, there are about 12 that go unheard of. What exactly is worthy to put on the air has always irritated me. Years ago, my uncle was killed and it made the Spanish newspaper here in NY called " el Diario ". The title was loosely translated for you English colonized schmucks...... " Shoot out between bandits leaves one dead and three injured " All of the Spanish speaking community that reads that paper read that Miguel Vargas was a bandit in the street that died while he engaged in a shootout. Not only was my family hurt with the death of a family member, imagine that story on top of it. After several well placed phone calls of threats with lawsuits that will shut shit down, a retraction was written. We didn't want a small ten word retraction- we want a fucking page and a story saying how much he contributed to his neighborhood. He was a hardworking furniture that was caught in the cross fire. I hate the media. Pathetic is that I work form one of the biggest media companies in the world. So many people that never made the news. So much tragedy that never had the light of day. "Tony Cortes Shoots himself in his chest and dies " No media "Mark Barrios Shoots himself in the head and dies " No Media Jermaine Hangs himself in his bedroom " No media Freddy Martin is killed protecting two girls " No media Charlie is run over by a city bus and killed " No Media Cano is chased from a roof by two pitbulls and falls three stories and dies " No media Suly is shot accidentally by her boyfriend and she dies " No media Jorge is killed in a shoot out with bouncers " No Media Nelson is killed in a fight while chasing a mugger into a building " No Media Angel dies of an Asthma Attack after moving to Virgina for a better life " No Media Harry plays russian roulette and loses when a bullet enters his head " no media Jose is shot and killed in a chinese food place after an argument " no Media Joe is shot and killed in an after hours club " No media" Steve is shot and killed on Elder Ave " No Media Keith is killed on a harlem street protecting his pregnant girl from someone trying to rob them" No media Carolyn, Irene, Kathy all died of cancer and they all attended the same high school " No media" Cheena crosses the street and gets hit and killed by a SUV " No media So much personal tragedy ( personal as in I knew all these people personally ) and I never heard a peep in the news, papers, radio. Back in 1995 there was a fuckin war in the streets and the news didn't have a fucking clue. 8 days straight with 9 shoot-outs and there was not a peep. What did make news on my block??? Tango & Cash was a new dope and sample's were given out to the dopefiends to get a free taste. 29 dopefiends drop within ten mins of snortin the dope. 27 are taken to the hospital and 9 die. That was some major shit. Every channel in the tri-state area came to my block interviewing everybody from the local supper's to the grocery store clerks. Amadou Diallo was one block away from my old neighborhood. I don't even need to get into that. I don't even know if all this makes sense. Shit was just fucked up and the media never gave two shits.

 Never like politics and have no interest in it My mother is funny, I buy tortillas to have with dinner and she says I am a mexican and I should be washing dishes. I tell her I rather lanscapre and she gets upset. " Oh, you can joke but I can't ?" Eric is still in the hospital I am plugging the shit out of too many shows. I hate drama I brought some fish for the tank yesterday. I enjoyed seeing them fight until one killed the other. I am buying another today to see who wins. Is beta fighting illegal? My neighbors got a dog and he yelps all day and night. I have to find out how much is rat poision in the bodega. Porn is getting boring on cable. I need to buy some tapes I am a reader at the April 3rd Louder then Words series. Guy called me and I told him he had to check with my agent. I laughed, he laughed, I agreed. I love my parents. I don't know how life would be without them. I am going to Albany for some poetry soon. I am taking the Maxima and leaving it up there too. I saw some kids slap boxing yesterday and when I was walking by I called them " Clowns". Schooled them for 3 mins on the proper fighting stance and to forget all that jousting gimmick shit that gets your ass kicked in the streets. They called me " G ". Short for old Gangster but they dropped the " Old ". I miss my guns I haven't gotten laid in while. I want to take somebody to peter Lugers but how can I ask them out when we barely speak? I am angry today I am scared I want Eric home Last fight I had was about 1 month ago in front of the pizzaa shop. I didn't tell anybody. I wish Wil wasn't such a fuckup I wish alot of people weren't fuck - ups I am tired I miss my best friends Felt like crying, no more tears Felt like breaking a wall with my fist, it would hurt My dad hates it when I get mad My mother gets scared I miss my dog, I loved that dog, I wanted to get one with Lenny, have to be together to get a dog. I want an african grey parrot I am getting one by the end of this year peace

 Late post today. I have been thinking about the things that I am a part of too much lately. I love doing tings that are productive and not staying home just watching porn 16 hours a day; even thought there is nothing wrong with that. Yesterday was one of those days that put my emotions through a grinder. I wanted to post nothing but how great acentos was bright and early this morning but perspectiveis a motherfucker. Bright and early yesterday was my first call/e-mail that made me say..... we might have some issues today . Three seconds after that is when I found out that Eric was in the hospital with a hernia that made it difficult to walk. So I didnt know where I stood or if I was coming or going yesterday. You all know the Acentos Fiesta was going to be of the hook. Even though we have set a high bar for other anniversary shindigs; Eric was still on my mind. I dont have many people that I call brother. I dont have many people that I will turn to when I want to rip someones head off. Eric is probably te only person in this world that I will go to and cry. I will drop everything at the drop of a that to do whatever he needs me to do. Now, even though this hernia shit is small compared to other surgical procedures-it is still something that worried me. He came out of it ok and a ton of bricks were lifted off my shoulders. In visiting him this morning and spending time with him being drugged up. That made me appreciate more the love that I have for him. I never had a person I can call Brother as close as to how I feel to him. It scares me to think about one day not being able to call him or talk to him. I am not talking about death, I am talking about a falling out, beef, argument, misunderstanding. I kept tabs on him most of the night with some discreet phonecalls so that was cool. Now, to the thing we call Acentos........... Shit, what a night........ I started the night early because the place was packed. Oscar suggested this and regardless how much we but heads I actually thought it was a good idea. 7:30pm saw a Blue ox at standing room only and it was time to start. Welcome to the Blue ox and our first full year here at Acentooooooosssssssssss A nice applause and we were off to what many call the races. I said a couple of choice things but it wasnt about me. I wanted to get all the open mic folks to come through and get there little piece of history. 9 people on the OPEN mic and it was off to introduce Rich Villar. Damn, it was hard not to get emotional. Acentos has been our baby for 1 year and Rich has become an integral part in every aspect of what we do. A generic intro and the tears were held back. Rich is that little brother that I never had. He is that smart little fucker that knows more then me and he doesnt know I look up to him. He is the one that makes sense when anger takes over my every move. He gives me reason to get better. He gives me reason to learn. He gives me reason for everything we do right at Acentos. He takes his portion of the mic and destroys it. He makes that part his own and does it with gusto. His humor, his style, his energy. The readers were great and 70 patrons listening attentively- surreal moment # I have no clue. The break is upon us and I have no where to move. I have the bucket and one more reader to go. A nervous as fuck Eliel Lucero comes through and reads a new piece. After some informal workshopping for the Acentos kabal. He delivers a new piece with a new found anger and intensity. I never liked him too much because he was doing shit that turned me off. After some poking and prodding from the kabal that thought he could do better, he impressed me last night. he actually touched me. Then, the break........... This is where Jessica comes up and says the funniest shit in Acentos history when she put in place the L.A.P. She reads a poem she wrote in Honor of the Rev Pedro Pietri and I am sitting there looking at her. She has gotten so far in my heart as a person and poet. She strives everyday and tries much harder then I did we co-founded Acentos. She has a glow, not a warm inviting glow, a fucking bright neon glow that brightens the block, Acentos and everything within her immediate radius. She introduced Miguel Algarin and this was another surreal moment. A packed Blue Ox and Miguel Algarin ( the co-founder of the Nuyorican poets cafe ) is reading at Acentos! Oh man, why am I not crying over and over again? After some well placed drool and he reads his poetry, he is off into the NYC night. Another quick 5 minute break and the rest of the night is upon us. The home stretch, the last mile, the last piece to a perfect puzzle. Oscar brings his sortarican style to the mic. The energy is high, the love is present, the Ox is still full. Its no secret that Oscar and I fight like cat and dogs. Yet, when all is said and done, we have the perfect mix to make what we do great. Oscar has come a long way and last night his hosting was on point. Then it hit me, we have done this for over a year and him and I started a movement. Whatever we have done, taken, borrowed, used, stolen from other venues and readings, we have learned to perfect an equation for a successful reading series. More poets that have made Acentos. Then the last suprise to make this reading the hotness in the B.X. Mayda deValle is brought to the mic for what is known as an Acentos mini-feature. She drops some new work because Rich is our resident Acentos Shout out person; Is that new work?. It was sorta new so she dropped it and it was intense. I forgot how intense Mayda is and it was more then a pleasure to have her. She finishes and only as we can do......... we brought champagne for the whole bar and engaged in a toast. to one year at Acentos........ Salud We all drink, we toast.... we say our good byes. So much energy goes into running this thing. The appreciation factor is almost invisble. Yesterday made up for so many days that we went home without a simple thank you . We have built an incredible community. We have built a family. From simple hugs to thanks for coming out....... it is beautiful to have this community standing behind everything we do. Time to say my Thanks back Peace, Love, Porkchops Fish

 Memorable quotes from Bar 13 She Says..."Fish, do you think my ass is fat?? Or is it too big?" Fish Says.... " I'd fuck ya, be happy" Yes folks, this was the type of night at 13 last night. Rather surreal evening because of all the nuttiness going on. I haven't really been going to 13 for the simple reason that I have to much shit going on. I went last night and it was ok. The open mic was interesting with some stand out poets:good or as bad as they were. This one lady got up there and read an epic poem of "War and Peace" I think. I couldn't help it but hate on her. She was there for about 13 mins. I am not exaggerating. All of the NUYO slam borg showed up last night to compete in the slam. As they say..." They all come out of the woodworks when it's time to get rank". I won't even lie to you, it was interesting to see them basically take over the slam. Last night it was Carlos, Jive, Mahogany, Ainsley, Jai, Shawn Randall, and fish. I drew up first and it was pretty fucking pissy that it happened again! That little paper always says " 1 ". I was a little bit purturbed and I was about to go with the big guns in the first round but I stuck to my personal morals and slammed a new piece off page. I got a 27.4 and I was kinda happy. Ainsley and I tied in the first round so we both moved to the second round. I went last and figured that I better do it hard. In order for me to move to the next round, I had to be Jive poetic accumulative score of 57.3. Uh, do the math, I needed a perfect 30 in order to tie Jive. I pulled out the big guns and fell short about a point. So, I won't be in the next round and my semi-finals invite might have been shot to shit. Oh well, There is so much more then slam and I am just having fun. I am laying down the foundation for my well deserved respect. Carlos took the slam and the Latino take over is here son. Anyway, many e-mails to write today. I will write later Peace Love



 Yesterday was a pretty cool day. Headed out to the old neighborhood with Peter Dressel to grab some pics. I was giving it thought as to what would be best in giving everyone an idea what I am and how I got here. It was funny when I got to my old block and started taking some pics if front of the typical ghetto memorial mural. Went across the street to where my three fingers decided to take a permanent vacation and left my body. It was weird standing there. I haven't stood on that same spot in about 14 years. Something kinda clicked inside of me and it was clear to see it was anger. 14 years later and I still get pissed when I go back to that day. Some people know a story, some people know THE story, some people know the truth. Either way, standing there with a camera in my face clicking away and my heart racing, it was probably the hardest thing I have done this year. Decided to head to the cemetery and take some shots out there. The only place where I can go and forget about poetry, life, work, girl issues, cars, full of shit niggers, rats and bitches. I go to the cemetery a little too much in my older years. I tend to usually go visit my uncle. I thought about it yesterday about how much I think about my eternal sleep. Seeing a tombstone with my very own last name always makes me feel calm. The thought that one day I don't have to LIVE life anymore is something that I look forward to. I don't really care about heaven, hell, purgatory... it 's the long relaxed sleep that I look forward to. I know, it's morbid but sleep comes far and few these days. When we posed, the sky opened up and it was clear as day. It was cold as fuck but it was beautiful. Peter was digging shooting at a cemetery. I gave him a first and that always makes me feel good. Decided to go pick up this kat that meant alot to me back in the day to include him in the " what made me Project" I haven't hung with Wil in a while and I am still amazed at how he will drop anything in 2 seconds to do whatever I say. We decided to head back to Elder ave to the building where I haven't stepped foot since the day I moved out. Walked into the lobby and took some cool shots in front of a window full of bullet holes. That has to say the most for me right there. Elder ave..... wow I miss that block but I don't want to be back there. Same shit and nothing new there. Fish

 Ok, this event at Urbana was three step beyond off the hook. I will write about Billy Collins a little bit later. Yesterday I have come to this concept.... " Poets are all fucking crazy " Ed Has issues Shappy is weirder then what I first thought Taylor is crazy Eric has volumes The limerick slam was one those moments in your life that you are glad you are not a part of. They had to be about 20 people up there going head to head with there own original limericks. Taylor created this system and it proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that he has too much time on his hands. Some of the people up there were horrible with their limericks and we made it known. The louder borg was actin a fool yesterday and it felt good. I kinda been feeling we have been toooooo serious lately and we needed an out. We got an out yesterday screaming .... " that was a piece of shit" Oh my god. you suck " " You are still there , get off " " That is not a fuckin limerick" " you can't start a new language" After yesterday, Lynne's boobs were nicknamed Canteloupe's and Melons, Ed shits in his pants, REID harris Cooper sticks books in his ass, Oscar give me rim jobs, Roger has a huge cock, and everything else under the son. Interesting night........ Peace

 Painting is done. It's about fuckin time. These dudes took a full week to paint my living room. I have seen 16, 000 square feet painted in 9 hours. It took them 7 full days to paint 60 sq feet. Well, that off the books labor can't be all that great now can't it? I am back at work after getting some things done in my house. I got a late night phone call last night from a friend that her mother was admitted to the hospital for some mental issues. It's kinda sad because I saw that coming. The lady is clearly depressed and she needs help. When I used to go over and visit and these horrible vibes shot through me, I had no choice but to stop visiting. I wasn't ready to deal with things like when I wasn't obligated to. So in the interest of being a friend, I provided a safe haven last night with some hugs and assurances. We caught some TV( Sopranos ) and a movie. I felt good when they left because they left in a much better state of mind hence when they came. So, I am getting more points into heaven. Right now I am just like the game show Jeopardy. I am so far into negative territory that I need much more then a few points to get INTO heaven. I think the only pass I could get unabated into heaven would be saving the Pope's life or some shit. Found out some interesting gossip from around the way. Makes me kind of glad I am soooo out of the loop that it really seems shocking. Some dude around my way is probably the most feared thug in the Bronx. He walks into any club untouched but very noticed. Several attempts on his life have gone unsuccessful. The ones that have attempted paid the ultimate price. Besides that..... he is a really nice guy. Turns out a gentleman doing 20 to life just found out his wife was doing the horizontal, vertical, upside down, in all ways everyday mambo with the dude. The gentleman came home and confronted the dude and several threats later........ he walks away. I have several questions....... IF the gentleman was doing 20 to life..... how did he come out to walk the street??? Why is a detective calling my house leaving a number to call them back concerning an issue? ( I haven't called back ) In the game ( Hussle ) several things will bring you down. - Greed - Women - just not being loyal The lake is being disturbed on Watson. I am off parole and they can't do shit to me right about now. Plus, I don't know anything. Stay tuned...... PEace P.s I get great writing material everyday from this fuckin block

 Yesterday was my NYC sloshing into Taylor mali's workshop. I first met Taylor during my " I hate anything White stage ". I am not afraid to admit my ignorance but I have learned that being so closed minded has genuinely hurt me in being a better person. Over the a two year period in gradually having decent conversation with Taylor- I realized why he is so good at what he does. Taylor is straight up cut throat. I admire that. In his workshop yesterday he said something that many of the louder folk would have died and fought tooth and nail against. Now, I understand the inner workings of a poet who is somewhat insane. To be honest, I am not spilling the beans about what was said in the workshop because hey......... spend the money and support a person who is doing his part to better this community. Next Class, I am helping Taylor plug. There has to be more then 10 people there the next time. With my "influence", I can get about 20 people there. We see One thing I learned is what school of poetry do you come from??? Taylor has a school that he calls " The Immaculate School of Inspirational Eloquence ". I have garnered the balls to call my school of where I have learned poetry " The school of hard knocks of no rhyme nor reason ". It suits me being an ex-knucklehead coming into a world that has accepted me. I don't know if it was fear or just that I am a nice guy. I was still accepted and it was cool...... I wrote this poem that had to say who I was in less then 30 secs and I had to have it memorized also: Everyone in life will die once I already died twice 1992, I lost three fingers along with my life 1998, I lost freedom and died in jail I came home I found a pen I found a writer the writer became a dreamer the dreamer will die a poet Cute little piece Peace Fish

 The shoes were buffed, the khaki's were pressed, the shirt was ironed - off to the Community Word Benefit I went. It was held at the National Arts Club. A place where my first hour or two consisted of me looking for Latino names. Some guy named Xavier Gonzalez was honored back in 1978. Who is he ??? I have no clue. Plenty of portraits and paintings hanging all over the place. Nice red velvet couches and a whole bunch of uptight white folk. Not attending the benefit but milling about. The benefit itself was a good experience. I gravitated towards several people here and there. I met Edie Falco ( Sopranos fame ) last night. Diane Was a nervous 15 pound of shit in a three pound capacity bag. She didn't know where to put her face when it came to meeting Ms Falco. I grabbed Diane by the hand and dragged her over to Ms Falco. Fish: Hello Ms Falco. my name is Fish Vargas and I am a teaching artist with the Community word Project Ms Falco: Oh it is nice to meet you Fish: Let me introduce you to my partner Diane Roy. She is currently a nervous wreck and couldn't gather enough energy to come meet you Flaco: {laughs} oh, that is nice Fish: I will let you both talk. It was a pleasure to meet you Ms Falco Falco: Likewise Fish So that could have been a highlight of the evening but plenty blew me away. The second grade students at P.S 79 ( my old school ) put on a performance piece by Jesus Papoleto Melendez. These young kids were incredible. Rachelle and Marina did incredible work. I was itching to write about this one....... This gentlemen slated to perform yesterday with his violin made his way towards the stage. This was totally a surreal fuckin moment. He took his violin and he made it come to life. It wasn't the classical music with Bach, Mozart being influences. He channeled Hendrix, Garcia, and thought about Santana. He did three songs and I was in shock with what he did. In one set, he played the National Anthem, Amazing Grace, Dueling banjo's with his own flavor. I can't really describe it but the guy was incredible. I had a great conversation about our different arts and he wants to come to CWP in some type of collaborative effort. I have always been amazed by artist with musical ability but this dude was beyond what any of us can undersand. I told him that many of us as poets strive to achieve with words what he has gone beyond with his notes. He spilled harmony, faith, hope, anger, intensity all with one violin. Wow Great night Funny part of the evening. I went to retrieve my ghetto coat and off to the side were some older white gentleman playing pool. I went and sat to admire their game. One gentleman actually wanted me to play but the other whiter gentleman were not feeling that. I guess if he saw I had the balls to sit and watch their game, I must have some ability. The older white dude ( Vinny ) said " not to have hard feelings but it was just a game amongst beginners". I knew if I would have got on that table I would have killed them. I would have channeled every bit of anger from Slavery, racism, bias comments, harassment and played it into my pool game. I play much better when I am angry. But........... I didn't play. They sucked really really bad too. The table was beautiful also. They didn't deserve to play on such a beautiful table. All the money in the world would never help these pompous scrubs. Aight.... I'm out.... take care Fish Peace , Love, Porkchops

 I normally write about what has happened to me personally but this kind of threw me aback yesterday when I saw it. The hottest topic these days seems about same sex couples marrying each other. In San Francisco it steam rolled to where several thousand people were married. Somewhere down the line Bush ( the guy that makes beleive he is President ) wanted to add an amendment to the constitution banning same sex marriages. Wow, that is really pushing the issue in my eyes. Iraq will not bring down Bush but if he bans same sex marriages - he is through. Anyway......several weeks ago at Q2, I was inspired to write a piece about my brother and his exposing of his lifestyle choice. It is actually more about the hatred we both have for each other but that is not the point. More fuel for the fire as they say......... Yesterday at the Bronx County courthouse were two demostrations in support and against same sex marriages. No where to my recollections has there been a demonstration against same sex marriages but in the Bronx we have em. That shit irked me. Most of the people demonstrating were latino and black. 90% of them were toting bibles -hypocrites. It seems that in most latino and black families, we all have a gay cousin or two. They are ok as long as they don't marry it seems. I honestly can fathom why the fuck people feel the need to intrude in others people's lifestyle choices. You are not gay, what the fuck, let other people do as they please. Here is the kicker, the asshole that organized the anti-same sex marriage demonstration was Ruben Diaz. He is a councilman from the Bronx that I grew up with and I am in current talks with him about finding some housing for Acentos. Now, after he did this, that puts me in an interesting predicament. The poetry community is very heavy with the LGBT. Imagine this bastid talking shit about people that I consider family. Things just get more interesting everyday of my life Oh Wrestlemania sucked ass yesterday. Peace ************************** New Poem Untitled Fits of rage crinkle a young forehead eyebrows clench tightly above beaded eyes anger typhoons in my stomach, clutches my sides, grips my throat Building breathe to muster....... FAGGOT! I was six, he was 13 he chased me from the bedroom, around the coffee table, into the kitchen where I sought safety behind my mother, his mother From the very first day he held me, I cried At 2 years old I remember disgust exude from his eyes daunted smacks across my face denied when confronted Taunts bridled with heckling laughter His amusement of holding me by my ankles over the ledge of a worn down tenement building, threats to let go If so, I will die in the same place where homeless men urinate and dope fiends shoot escape into their veins A frozen scream as I look straight down and see 7 stories of concrete. no one hears He pulls me in and walks away laughing cries on a roof surrounded by the smell of hot tar Awakening to phlegm striking my face..tears Treasured toys disappearing...tears Clothes ripped...tears why? You despised yourself more then what you hated me a world closed within the Latino machismo we feared a mask worn by many, survive the wrath of family, friends, co-workers a box keeps you trapped "My family loves me but will they accept me?" lash at me because I am not like you? hate me because I will never be you? it requires strength to write about you it calls for a passion of life to think about you 8 years incarcerated for real estate fraud You have come home to no one 40 years old and you have come out Clench what makes you a time where you can marry, live, vote, and even love My Grandmother or as you called her, "mami " died when you were in jail the family knows of your decision Metaphorical funerals and remembrances held as the family proposed death Alone uncles do not mention your name, their wives follow suit ostracized by cousins, shunned by family members feeling deceived Where are you going to turn? Boxes getting tighter no air to breathe choking on a decision commonly referred to with a low growl we came to blows at 3am on a levittown street in Toa Baja Puerto Rico mother defended when you came home and accused her of abandoning you not loving you, forgetting you Can she forget the beatings of your father? No therapy to help her years of anguish when she made a decision to leave you behind to cuddle the safety of 4000 miles from a batterer you call " father" A son left behind a mother cries Anger cascading with each blow against your face The ledge, the phlegm, the taunts, the smacks, the laughter your father, my mothers broken jaw and coma when she was 25 beating you for the treatment of me and our mother I have cried for you since the day you started hating me you have the ignorance of Puerto Rico on your shoulders can't follow my family that baptized me a criminal can't shun you for what has happened can only accept you for a decision you have made A decision which makes you as brave as any man willing to sacrifice his life to pursue what he is. what he believes is his right I could never love you but I am the only family member that has accepted you Feedback welcomed in the guestbook.

 Some poets are far more insane then others. I have come to that conclusion yesterday as Luis ( El Extreme ) Chaluisan was hosting yet another Pedro Pietri Tribute. Egads!! That dude has some issues. He is part comedian, part poet, part host, part nutcase. When I first got there it was weird to me because I keep on learning about new things in the Bronx. Not that it was totally new but new to me because I never knew it existed before. The event was held at the Bronx River Arts center. I never knew they had and arts center in the Bronx and you learn something new everyday. When it started this one chic did a poem by Julia De Burgos and regardless of how hot she looked I dont think she will ever come close to doing Julia justice. After her bit we were ushered to the 4th floor, no elevator mind you. If I catch a heart attack I am fuckin somebody up. Sit, if Rich catches a heart attack that motherfucker is going to die because I am not carrying HIS ASS!!! We made it safe and they yanked another 5 dollars from the pocket and the evening started with a film called El Cello. Que fuckin basura! It was about a young dominican chic playing the cello downtown for money. She encounters a homeless guy and they work in together and they make decent money. Some kid comes and takes her purse and she runs after him. She returns and the homeless guy stole her cello. She comes home and her mother calmly hits her with the I told you so . What miffed me was the unrealstic nature of this short film. No matter how much class they wanted to portray in this family the dominican mother would have been screaming her head off. Anywayafter the film, several people went up and it was cool. Then. The young Acentos Poets that he hopes continue to write. Rich read his poem about Lolita and the old barrio. I went and did the Bronx Piece. Oscar went down the sorta rican route. Jess Browned skinned it. After we all finished Luis calls us all back to the stage. So here are all the Acentos poets and he gives us a message from Pedro in the form of a message. When it was happening it was surreal. When it sunk in I was embarassed as holy fuck. Strip me naked and show off the small penis instead if you want pero cono. This dude has issues. We get off the stage and you can tell that we were all like. What the fuck was that about ? Some more poets and performers paid tribute and the evening was good. Carmen Pietri, Sam Diaz and Pedros Brother Showed up. We had a nice time with them as Carmen pulled out some old pics of Pedro from the 50s. Thoe pics had no price as they were hilarious. I straight up Carmen that I am ghetto and I have no problem stealing a few so keep them away rom me. She laughed and we made our way off to eat. I tried to sum up the evening in my head but there was no need to. It was an honor of Pedro and we had a great time as he wanted all of us to have. Luis had some good moments and I give him props. It was early so we hit a diner and it was cool. We spoke about the show, poetry, and slam. It was a good close to my evening as no one got on my nerves. Today is the shin dig as Seves and we are going to enjoy the high testosterone filled environment and act a fool. Catch ya soon Peace, Love, Porkchops Fish

 wow Good evening last night. For the sake of that matter, it was actually a good day in general. Giving credence to all that is surreal, let me start with Bluestocking Book store with the latest installment of Soul Nation. Since I left my job a little bit late making some new flyers for what seems to be the newest and most controversial reading in NYC add some traffic presto............Fish is late. we all know how much Fish hates being fuckin late. I got there in Time to hear some very powerful sistas read some poetry. Being biased as I am............ My two favorite readers were Nina and Our Jess. Those two girls are at the forefront of everything that poetry should be. They both had a short set but delved into humor, introspection, imagery and love. I am loving those two more and more every day. I would love to stay with them and engage in all the general jackassery in loisada but I made a commitment to an opportunity that kinda fell out of my cell phone. Yesterday at the Nuyorican Poets cafe was a theme slam on redemption. It was 10 poets vying for an opportunity to compete against other poets to promote and go on tour for this movie about Tookie Williams. This is the kat that co-founded the crips L.A Street gang that is currently on Death Row. Yet, from death row he has authored several childrens books and has been nominated for the Nobel prize three times. So......Poets competing with there poems on Redemption???? Ainsley Burrows, Yolanda K Wilkinson, Kamal, Daniel Beaty, Dinorah, Itsrealight, Baron, Lamb and Fish. Celena Glenn got some food poisioning so she couldnt make it. When the poets are called to the stage and I see who I am going up against, the first thing that went through my mind was ......... 9 poets..... maybe 3 might read about redemption. I love Ainsley to death but if he reads that 9/11 poem one more time...... I am going to cut him. He scored a 28.1 and going first- that was a decent score. Most of the night was a blur to me but I do remember the scores the judges gave over some interesting poetry. Daniel beaty went up there and screamed and break neck speed and got a 29.7. The best poetry of the night had to come from Yolanda and this lovely girl named Dinorah. Other then that , I was disappointed to hear Itsrealight do her signature piece which had not one ounce of redemption. Lamb did the same poem........again ( nice guy but he needs to write more ). Everytime I see him, same pieces. 5 poets moved into the second round. I didnt get a 29.7 but I did get higher then a 28.2. I brought my little book up there and read poetry. I didnt scream, rant, rave, yell. I read slowly and gave the best performance from the page that I could remember. So moving into the second round was Daniel, Kamal, Fish, Itsrealight,Lamb. I drew 9th in the first round so after they switched it on me...... I had to go first in the second round. I didnt mind since I was basking in the glory of just making it there. I read my I am piece and it went over well. Some chic gave me an 8.9 but the lowest score gets dropped. Daniel went up there and got a 30. Kamal got a 29.7, Lamb got a 29.6, itsrealdark got a 29.5 ( I think ). Fish got a 29.4. I swear I am a loser. All in all....... The slam was ok. I wish more poets would stay within the theme and keep it real. Regardless of how I lost, meeting Carol king and having her tell me she loved my work was surreal. I met Jamie Foxx manager and he gave me his card, I gave him an Acentos Flyer. Weird transaction but it was worth it. Plugging Acentos all night had many people laughing. Those little flyers are a god send and I thinking making more of them seems like a good idea. I loved your work fish , really?.......... here is a flyer Coming home was interesting too as keep getting more and more pissed with certain people. Yet, I am not paying anything mind. I have better things to get me upset. Today is the tribute at the Bronx River Arts Center. I am reading a new piece because nina hasnt hard me read. Gotta keep on top of those people that want to hear your work progressing. Im out....wrestlemania TOMORROW!!!!!!! .

 When eric and I hang out we act a straight fool. Last night he came to pick me up and we had a ball. Driving around and laughin at all the NYC nightlife has to offer. I even passed by the Nuyorican really quick but driving around talking was the better part of my night. Yesterday when we were heading home I convinced Eric to pick up the Acentos Collage that I put together for the anniversary show. I bring it outside to put in the back seat of the car. He want to lay it across the floor of the back and I want to put it in the seat. After some verbal back and forth about the baby seat...... he tells me to pop the trunk. I ask him " Why?". He screams... " where the fuck am I going to put the baby seat?" I started cracking up. I laughed because he screamed at me and he feels that comfortable with me. Any one else...... I would have looked at them like..... "what the fuck?" Our travels took us to a couple of places and the night was good. Joking with him had to be the highlight of my month. Then again.... the stripclub was n't that far behind. Peace

 ..............and woke up in one of those moods that no matter what happens, my day will be good. Even after I mistakenly grab the ketchup packet thinking it was grape jam and squeeze it onto my morning biscuit. For the record....... biscuits and ketchup do not go well together. As more moments of surrealism come to grace Acentos - last night was a doozy. As we were lucky enough to have Jack Agueros feature for us - excitement filled the air. A strong open mic with a virgin hosting session from our own Rich Villar paved the way for another strong Acentos. Introduction of feature...... ten minutes later..... he was done. Our faces were somewhere between "uh..uhhhh......uhhhhh" and " holy shit ". It was handled smoothly regardless and I am happy the evening was strong. Most likely at the next Acentos I will read my next poem involving my brother, our disdain for each other, and him coming out of the closet. I haven't read at Acentos since my feature and that is way too long. The next poem is going to touch on some personal feelings between my brother and I. Yes..... I have a brother. He is 40 years old and lives in Puerto Rico. He did 8 years in jail for real estate fraud, embezzlement, and an array of other charges. He recently came home to reveal that he was gay. I guess my shot at ever being an uncle is shot to shit after that declaration. Him and I never got along. In 98 we fought one inch from taking each others life. He lifted his hands at my moms and that was definitely not happening. I think about the " what if's" and I preferred those to what really happened. When I saw him take a swing at my mother - he lost his blood as a brother. He lost his right as my family. With every punch against his face, I gathered the strength to hit him again and again and again. The taste of his blood similar to my own. His cries to my mother of " take him off me ". My mother taking his bloodied side after I protected her. His accusations towards my mother of abandonment after she fled Puerto Rico to the safety of NYC fleeing a man that had broken her jaw, left her hospitalized, battered, broken and once , almost dead. Hate is a strong word. I am not afraid to use it. "Ricardo Mercado of toa Baja Levittown Puerto Rico. I fuckin hate you and I should have kept hitting you until you stopped breathing, until your heart stopped, until your face disappeared from my memory, until every single disgusting act you conspired against me is paid back, until my knuckles cracked redemption against your bones, until our blood tangles remorse on the concrete. When God begs me to stop but he even knows I am right" Sighhhhh Fish

 I am really looking forward to just chillin these days. last night I had to remove everything from my living room to make room for the painters to come and do their thing. There are two times in your life in which you realize you are the owner of too much shit 1 When you move 2 When you paint Don't get it twisted, I don't have the patience. I also know that I have tooooooo much shit and I will clean house soon. Good night at 13 last night. Regular format with a solid open mic of newbie's. I love to see new people come to the mic. Guerrrrrreeerrrrii was really welcoming to the "virgins" and they all did quite well for first timers. Doesn't seem that long ago that Fish and Oscar rolled into Bar 13 and read some bullshit and Guy thought we were pretty good. After being around for two years.... I think Guy was full of shit. I read the poem recently that I read on that open mic two years ago- it sucked geriatric ass really bad. It didn't politely suck cute little suckling sunction kisses. It sucked with two hands opening the buttcheeks and me inserting a straw into a hemmoroid riddled asshole reaking of preparation - H and giving some decrepit old lady an oral enema! I still thank the Met fan. The slam was ok last night. Ainsley rocked out with some of his big gun oldies. Carlos impressed me in the 3rd round with new work. Bonafide pulled the big guns to ensure a 2nd place finish. Some new kat came onto the slam and he was decent. Probably caught the movie Slam a tad much but it was good to see a new face up there. Last night Jai went up there and dropped his best performance that I have ever seen. That motherfucker rights some next level poetry that is soooooooo fucking good that it passes right through the judges. Taylor asked me last night who I thought was robbed. Without a moment of hesitation- Jai! Incredibly enough, Taylor agreed with me. It was a common consensus the judges were losing the poem through Jai over the top use of his hands. Jai's words are powerful enough to kill a judge without the "roger in the matrix" mode. In passing conversation with Jai I asked him to consider it and he took the opinion/advice well. I think Jai is the only one that hurts me physically when he gets scored low in slams with some incredible work. As for my slam career this year might close with very little drama. I slammed this year 4 times and garnered 2 point with a 2nd place finish in the last slam in 2003. In order for me to compete I have to be in the top 15 . As where we stand right now........ I am # 12. I should be happy right ?? The rankings haven't been updated since January 20 and I really have no clue where I stand in them. So, once the update comes........ we see. I am not sweating it. There is so much more then being on a team for me. Funny how things change. Last year I was gunning for the Union square team hard core. Now...... shit has just changed. Acentos has made me see such a bigger picture in the poetry community. Teaching has changed my perspective. Working hard to be the best has taken charge. Life is still good. I am happy and I am still learning more and more. So.... Peace, Love, Porkchops, pernil, Poetry Fish P.S Sean Thomas Dougherty is a fucking Genius!

 After about three weeks of planning, prodding, poking, thinking..... what's done is done. As respect goes far and wide for certain private matters: this is one of those times. People have to realize the love that exudes from them effects their smaller and contrite communities. Therefore..... the community will return that love. I had a interesting day yesterday as it was filled with emotion, anger, worries, and anxiety. Welcome to the full fledged emotional roller coaster scream machine known as "the mind of Fish" As I got home yesterday and I was battling this ebola that tried to take over my body. I sat and thought about the love that everyone has for me when things are great and I am healthy. The other spectrum begs for misery as you know where I am going with it. Will you come see me when I am dead??? Will you take ten minutes of your life and visit me for one last time?? My body laying stiff in an overpriced box wearing one of the court suits I own. I have on a generous amount of cheap make-up. My body is swollen and you could barely recognize me. Would you want to remember me in that manner? I heard someone say yesterday that " they don't see dead people" so going to Pedro Pietri's wake was primarily out of the question. I can't blame this person because many people can't deal with that situation. Where did we learn to mourn the passing of someone and view their " body" one last time? Isn't that kinda sick if you come to think of it? I tell everyone over and over again that I don't want a viewing. I don't want a funeral. Take the fat puerto Rican man from the morgue to the incinerator and burn him. Take my ashes and spread them in Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico, El Faro en el Combate in Puerto Rico, Watson Ave, Bar 13, Acentos....... mix it up with some hydro and smoke away baby. You can love me in life but you will celebrate me in death. Seriously, why cry when you know what I wanted? No matter what the circumstances were in my death- you can relish that I thought enough about my death to let everyone know what I wanted. Poetry...... wow.... no poet readings in honor of me. Fuck that. You know that fish just wants people to hang and remember him as long as Possible. Drink a pepsi for me. Be happy knowing that I have died doing something I love around people that have helped me. No will, no money, no tears, no hate...... just live your life as I lived mines. Happy, joyful, helpful. Love ya niggers Word Peace

 Pedro Juan Pietri Aponte (1944-2004) It is with deep sorrow that I inform you that Pedro Juan Pietri Aponte, our beloved poet has been excused from further pain and sorrow. While on a journey coming back home. It was to be a temporary timeout from a rigorous, intensive and expensive treatment. For him time is no longer of any concern, he belongs to eternity. His family, friends and poets from all over the world will grieve the absence of his laughter, genius and art, but the memory remains with all of us. Whether you met him for a moment or a lifetime you were a part of him. On behalf of his family I would like to Thank You for all the kindness, help and support that you have extended to him, especially in these last couple of months as he fought for his life. I am a witness that your kindness was very touching to him. He did not know that he was so admired, so loved by so many people. We will keep you informed as arrangements are finalized, through the Pedro Pietri Health Benefit voicemail (212-340-1237). There will be a public viewing at First Spanish United Methodist Church (The People's Church) 163 E. 110th St. from 4:00 PM to 8:00 PM On behalf on the Pietri Family and In the Service of Poetry, Art and Community Sam Diaz

 La cabeza is about to explode. Seriously, like in the move " big trouble in little China" ,my head is going to swell up to the size of a melon and explode. Why you ask?? After reading the angry pumpkin and a thread from that stegasaurous character....... opinions and ideas flow heavy from poets. My two cents are thrown into the mix from my own perspective. Since many people are using Acentos as a staple to where you can go to feel warmth, love and community - don't even ask me how we are doing it. Poetry has been at the forefront of me changing for the better. I always loved writing and tickled the pen way before I stepped foot into Bar 13. I have the BADDDDDDDD poetry to prove it. When my feet jumped into that cold lake of "uppercase" on Nov 25, 2002 - I thought my world was perfect. When and where did I want a concentration on Latino writers and poets is somewhat vague right now. I know somewhere within me was an animosity brewing when I went to a venue and the latin writers are as scarce as a Republican with public support for all political parties. Did I go out there specifically with the intent on starting a series?? No. Did I throw the idea around in my head and wished it would come true?? Yes. One new bar, one open-minded bar owner, Oscar's first Wednesday feature, several ideas, mission statements, vision statements and plenty of fights...... BANG! ACENTOS BABY! The place where we show love to everyone that walks through the door. Latino or not you are getting love. Poets across the board will always be welcomed on the open mic. All this with write-ups and media with no slam. Hmmmmm..... Makes ya think. Peace, Love, Porkchops Fish

 Go through the bodega gates of heaven/ go up to God/ Light up/ smile and say/ "God ,I left my family, poetry, and body behind but my weed comes with me" God looks down and says "I hope you brought some for me then Light up Rev......Light up " Rest in Peace Pedro See you soon

 When I was flicking through the channels and I came upon another reality show - I almost threw up. Literally, I gagged, hacked, and almost up-chunked my tortillas. They had ,on Fox 5, the Garden of Eden which was typical reality show mierda. When I tuned in it was right ot the time where someone was getting shafted ( voted off ). This one chic was doing the casting away and she lambasted this one dude harshly. She said he lacked integrity, she said he wasn't worthy of her and so on. So she chose to Banish him. WAIT!!!!!!!! The host of the series says in the Garden of Eden there is always a chance of being spared. They brought out two envelopes and she had to pick " Spare or Banish" and not show anyone what she picked. Now, they bring out another envelope and give it to the guy to read.......... " Here at the Garden of eden if you have chosen to banish you will also be banished. If you have chosen to spare , you yourself will also be spared " OH SHIT!!! PLOT TWIST!!!!!!!!!! When she turned around that envelope and it said........................ BANISH............ I WAS SCREAMING.... HA!!!! HA!!!!!!! HA!!!!!!! She passed judgement and shot herself in the foot. Reality shows are really sucking these days. Even the Playboy reality show of 7 lives exposed is really sucking. Oh well.... I should start getting into politics because things are getting boring.

 So, say you were meeting a new person - blind date, new friend, who knows. And you wanted them to have some idea of what kind of person you are, and who you are. But you can't actually tell them in so many words. Instead, you have to give them a box, with a dozen things in it for them to ponder over. What would you put in the box? No cheating - you're not allowed to include things such as links to your livejournal. WHAT I'D PUT IN MINE: 01. Extensive Playboy collection 02. my two favorite guns ( Desert Eagle .50 & Glock 23 ) 03. C-train and 13 Mexicans by Jimmy Santiago Baca 04. 3 liter pepsi 05. Public enemy / Rebel without a pause 06. Puerto Rican Flag 07. Scarface VHS TAPE!!! 08. KY Jelly 09. Picture of my Parents/ Eric and his family 10. Sterling silver pen I treasure 11. All the Acentos Flyers I have saved 12. My first Chapbook Added few for your entertainment All my porn tapes ( That box better be big ) the sex tape of me and Lenny ( She will be calling me as soon as she reads this ) The keys to all my cars Peace, Love, Porkchops! Fish

 Should I get serious???? Should I keep it real??? Well, let me just try to get this out in unadulterated " fish " style. Headed to catch the 4 pm showing of " The Passion of Christ" yesterday. I got tickets for the 9:30pm show instead because it was sold out until then. Yes folks, not even the props that I have at the movie theaters help me yesterday. With all the hoopla surrounding Mel Gibson's latest installment of Gorefest I was rather determined to see this flick. I always loved to see violent movies because I have a morbid love for anything gory and violent. Put it this way - my dad took me to see the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre when I was 4 at the movie theater, nuff said. The professor, the paranoid one and myself headed to Cross county and we made our way into the theater. Center row for optimal viewing of what was billed as one of the most violent movies of all time. I have heard this and I was pessimistic at the fact this could even impress me. To keep with the religious theme of this blog entry.......holy shit! I don't have a religious bone in my body. I believe in what I believe in and that is because I choose to. I lost my faith a long time ago. Yet, I still have some knowledge as to the story of the famed Jesus Christ. I followed the movie very closely open minded after I saw Jesus turn a Albino Boa python into a pancake. He stomped the shit out of this snake and from there on end I knew this movie was going to be different. According to the movie, Jesus was betrayed by that Judas character and turned over to what I think were the Jewish folk. They wanted him put to death but the Romans weren't quite feeling that. So the Romans wanted to just "punish severely" Jesus. This is where the movie got extremely interesting. If you are not religious, that shit doesn't matter. If you are religious, you will embrace Jesus even more. They said that Jesus paid for everyone's sins and that burden was carried by him and him only. If those burdens were in the form of beatings - he carried the sins of the world. He was beaten so bad that any other man in all of history would have died. Not Jesus, he got up after the first beating to get a worse beaten. Jesus is brought back and After some internal battles the Roman consul gave in and did what the Jewish folk wanted. They wanted Jesus Crucified and put to death. I think you can get the idea of what else happened throughout the movie. The extent of violence in this movie was beyond even my violence embracing comprehension. The only thing I kept on think was..... "there is no need to keep on beating him like that". Wow, Fish nurturing that compassionate nerve that barely ever surfaces from those deep ghetto doldrums. I started thinking once he is crucified that it will be over. Even that PG version they have given us throughout the years was harsh. Could it get worse when you are nailed to a fuckin cross??? Well, when they turned the cross over and Jesus was the floor face first with the cross on his back - I said...... "this movie is Poetry" The passion of Christ was an epic poem at it's best. If someone can write with such an intense vivid imagery that Mel Gibson used in this movie, that person will be our modern day picasso of poetry. Every detail of one's man's suffering. Every metaphor and awe catching moment was caught in this movie. It was powerful, it was dramatic, it was moving, everything that a poem has to be..... this movie had it. I am not religious but this movie caught everything in one man's vision and gave it to us in the form of a fuckin masterpiece. Oh...was the movie anti- Semitic? I don't know what to say. Does the movie portray all Jews as ignorant power hungry religion mongers? No. The movie portrays those Jewish folks that persecuted Jesus as executioners of faith other then theirs. Well, the movie was crazy. IF you are religious and want to appreciate what your Christ sacrificed for you, I wold suggest go check this flick out. It says plenty of what one man with true beliefs is willing to die for.

 Last night was my trek to the Bowery to catch their Megathermonuclearapocalypcticdisastermierda slam. I got there a little bit late because I got caught up in my house with these two hot porn stars and threesomes take a while to get over. Aye relax.. I am just joking. Got to the Bowery and I was bored. A fuckin semi-final slam and I was bored! Not even my little game of guess the score of the poet going up could keep me interested. 1 year on this scene thrown in the mix and I am already bored with the poems. I can only imagine what is going through the minds of poets that have been here for 7 years. I hope the finals next week at Urbana are much more interesting and I am looking forward to hearing probably one person. This white boy Chad went up there and he was ok. He made finals so he has something to offer. The only reason I am looking forward to it is because its new work I havent heard over and over again. Chad, if you are on this scene next year with the same poems, I will be bored of you too . I told Ed Garcia that if 4 years from now if I am slamming and I pull out my Bronx poems from the deep dark black kettle of poetry; he can stab me in my throat. I give him permission to grab my own nice and stab me in my throat going from left to right. Please make sure the esphogas falls out to ensure death. I try to ply myself as the ever loving, community building, poetry loving Fish that hugs everyone. Yet, I cringe to hear the same thing over and over again. This is what I get for attending too many slams. A piece of me understands some strategy used in slams. If you have one poem you are certain will garner a 9.9; fuck it; pull that motherfucker out. It is a competition and the one who is willing to go all out is going to win. The only thing I question is When are you going to pull out a pen and write something new?. One of my biggest fears was Oh, that is the Puerto Rican dude with the awesome Bronx poem ". Well, that has changed with the addition of another Bronx poem that is getting more accolades then the original Bronx poem. Celena won the slam again. Taylor came in second and I was happy for him. Even though he did his usual cut throat strategy; I rooted for him. Why?? Well, I never seen Taylor slam. Last year he was all over the place and he couldnt slam at urbana. He failed to make the team. This year he did his thing and he is in the finals. Big congrats to Mrs Post Midnight who is expecting an offspring in September. I have compiled a list of baby names for your choosing: Baby names: 1 Fish 2 Fish Midnight 3 Fish Post 4 Post Fish 5 Midnight Fish 6 Mid Fish 7 Mid NightFish 8 Bob Well, I am off to kill some little old ladies who just received their monthly social security checks. Then I am going to Rikers to teach some inmates the wonderful art of Poetry Peace, Love, Porkchops

 oh man, Denzel Washington is the man. I have always liked him and his more previous movies have made me a bonafide groupie. His last movie training day was straight madness. Last night I catch " Man on Fire" and he makes the role memorable. The lines will go right down next to...... " Go Ahead punk, Make my day " " You talking to me ? " " Say hello to my little friend " Yesterday was my day to be surprised somewhat by my Brother Eric who came to pick me up. He called me and said he was headed to Manhattan and he will stop by and pick me up to just hang a little. I am outside waiting for him and I am on the lookout for a Galant just like mine. This motherfucker pulls up in a 2004 Nissan Murano. I stated screaming like a little girl going on a first date. That mid-size SUV is straight up a man's toy. I was so happy because that was my first choice for him to buy when he asked me what he should get. The color he got it was a hot metallic royal blue. He needs some chrome really bad because he is riding on factory bullshit. I am putting some calls out to see if I can get a good ghetto deal. Some foose speedster J.J 19's would look crazy. Oh- I am sorry; if you don't know what I am talking about - do the research. After about 1 hour of talking over the new hooptie we head out to the B.X and get some small business out of the way. We met up with Mike Collins as he needed a look at the new wheels. I was starving and we headed to get some pizza and who walks out?? Fuckin Willie Perdomo and John Rodriguez. I start Screaming; " I can't STAY AWAY, I CAN'T STAY AWAY"!!! They start laughing and we speak some poetry lingo back and forth. Nice is when Willie points out that he heard I was in Semi's. Yes, the head swelled. Some other comments were made but I REFUSE TO APPEASE Pumpkins. After a well placed phone call to the move theater; Eric and I fly to catch this flick. The movie is well worth the reviews it got and worth your 10 bucks. Oh, I didn't pay a dime because it is who you know and not what you have to pay. After he drops me off I start thinking alot of the love I have for that kat. I never had a problem letting people know how much I care for them and how much they mean to me. Sometimes I will go out of the blue and just tell Eric I love him. As my brother and leaning tree; he means more to me then most people on this planet. Then there are the other folks that have found a piece in my heart that I can't deny. Tom, Mike, Oscar, Rich have all been there for me in a certain way. I think they can rest comfortably knowing that I will go to the end of whatever middle earth I have to destroy to ensure they are cool. The girls in my life have been the staple of my living. I always use the girls as a template on how to keep true friendships. One of my best friends that is a girl many of you don't even know. Then, the girls on the scene are becoming sisters amongst themselves and accepting us with our Jackassery. Jess, Maria, Nina, Lenny, Lynne, hold this spot also. Then the stragglers that I care for deeply...... Damn I am not even going to list it. You motherfuckers all know I have love for you. My life is good and it seems the life of my friends are exceptionally well. It can't get better then what it is now. Fish * A charger is a hollow plastic tube people use to transport drugs and illegal shit into jail via your asshole. C-4 is an explosive Figure out what denzel did

 ........going against all grains of what is right; I come home to write about Acentos instead of doing a show analysis. When you are a part of something that is bigger then you; being humble is all we got. Acentos always leaves me humbled everytime I come home. Some days more then others but today it was a good day to bid myself a humble messenger. Today was the day that Acentos paid much respect to what many consider the first ladies of our little venue. Jessica Torres, Nina, Maria Maria Nieves held center court today and gave back something that I will hold dear for a long time- appreciation, love, respect. So much work goes into a feature and it takes confidence and prudence to make it look easy. All three of them worked harder then what I could imagine. I cant give them enough credit and kudos for a beautiful set they did today. In looking back; today was much bigger then what I thought it could ever be. Today wasnt about our features; it was about the community amongst the women that make Acentos great. I got a huge surprise with Lenny coming to the mic and reading a poem introduction for the features. That is when it hit me like a bag of anthologies; the women in our series are sisters. From far to near; From there to here. All our women that come through have this essential bond that is making Acentos stronger. So to the first ladies of Acentos: Thank you for making us realize there is only one way to love Let me work Peace, Love, Porkchops Fish

 Ahhhhhhh........ Good night with some memorable performances. I will try to describe it but if you were not there- you might be lost. It was a good night with a packed house. Seems like whatever we are doing is working and the crowd is coming in. When I dropped the door; I counted 74 people walking through the door. The open mic was solid yesterday with more then 15 people coming in. The first guy to to " jerk the curtain " was the illegitamate love child of Rich and Chance. Picture Rich and chance being morphed into one: got it?? Well, that is the guy that opened yesterday. He was a member of the Delray beach team and came up to NY to slam. Uh.... I hope he realized it's a little bit too late. Before things got crazy. The performance of the night award goes to Luis Cartegena. This motherfuckin guy killed me yesterday. He started this great poem about life and a cheese sandwich. Then he pulled out a cheese sanwich and ate it on stage. Not a quick bite and he ran off. He just took his time and it was the best I have seen. Bastard got me hngry too! The slam was just that ......... A FUCKIN SLAM!!! Damn It wasn't one of those slams where the typical shit happened. The stars were actin up and the forces of the old slam deities came out hard core. When the festivities start with RAC Dropping a piece and staying on stage intimidating the judges; you knew the night was going to be weird. RAC Sacrifices her inner most demons to a 24.2 and the shooting begins. Now you fucks: don't hold my math as the official scoring Round 1 Jai 25.4 Rog 27.6 Rich 26.5 Mahogany 27.0 Mike Cirelli 26.5 Round 2 Rog 27.3 (54.9) Mahogany 26.4 (53.4) Rich 26.6 (53.1 ) Mike 27.3 ( 53.8 ) Jai 27.0 ( 52.4) Round 3 Rog 27.3 (82.2) Mike 27.5 (81.3) Mahogany 26.2 (79.6) Rich 26.5 (79.6) Jai 28.0 (80.4 ) in the previous round jai pulled some tactics out of his ass and he will definitely be the talk of the town for a long time to come! Round 4 Rog 27.3 (109.5) Mike 25.9 (107.2) Jai 27.2 (107.6) Rich 27.0 (106.6) Mahogany 27.3 (106.9) Well, My math might be right but maybe a time penalty in the last round changed shit or something. Roger took First Mike took Second Jai with the leap frog of death jumped into third So the last semi finals is over and done with and now the cut throat tactics begins. I have to enlist the help of some of my buddies to threaten some of the slammers. Maybe even show up at some residences at 4am. How about a doghead hung from the doorknob with a note " Slammers end up like this "! Finals on May tenth Rog Celena RAC Bonafide George Mike Cirelli Jai Abena Fish There is a little bit of everything in this slam. What is the best feeling I have right now?? No matter who makes the team- I feel they will be able to represent Louderarts fully! I am happy........ I Am nervous. Shit I am in it knee deep! Peace, Love, Porkchops

 Wow, Last nights dream was off the hook! I was dreaming Ricardo montalban and I found 90 gold brincks. We were picking them up and hundreds of hitmen came in. We started throwing gold bricks at them and knocking their heads off. Segue to the next dream and I was lifted away to a park where I had a rifle and I was shooting some people getting a tan. The dream was interesting. - Sopranos is still sucking ass. - Punk'd came back with a vengeance. Matthew Perry is the biggest pussy I have ever seen in my life. - Wild Boyz have issues. They were in India and acted a fool. One part of the show has Steve-O lick the feet of a young boy that had elephantisis ( huge feet ). It made me nauseous - Read Oscar's blog while he was going to D.C. The Acentos Fungus is growing. - I still don't have my cell phone - I might go to Great Adventures with Guy and the CRU. We need to get on some rides and throw up all over each other. - I am nervous about finals. ANy advice from you fuckers? - I found a small tweety bird a couple of months back and I gave it to Lenny. Turns out those Tweety Birds are from Starbucks. They had the whole looney toones Collection. Marvin the Martian rocks. - This kat in my job bet 9 people in my Job 20 bucks each the Yankees will not get shut out this year. He didn't come in today. I guess he is trying to get some money together. - Yankees, Mets, Knicks all suck this year. - My ex called me and left a message " Hi Fish, I just called to say hello, We haven't spoken for a while and I wanted to see how you were doing". Uh...... I sent her a scathing letter that basically sent her to hell in 45 different ways and she stills calls me. Women have issues. - My mother is so cool. I saw her this morning going to the doctor to get her check-up. I really love my moms. I appreciate her more now then before. She wants to stay alive to see her grand kids, she is going to hate me I guess. - Eric is my nigger - Rich Is my new hero Pimp - Oscar and I are cool - Guy better show up to Acentos because if he doesn't come tomorrow I am going to start a rumor that will deal with him being naked in a room with donkey and much K.Y jelly. - My cousin came home from Iraq. He has spoken more then three sentences in the 7 days he has stepped foot in the house. My aunt said he stood in bed for 3 days without moving. Peace

 ......... some bodies are rotting!!!! LOL Yes, yesterday was the Bronx River Alliance Flotilla Festival 2004. We were tapped to perform some poetry about the Bronx or the River itself. Rich and I stepped up to the plate and we were there at 12:45 on stage doing our thing. It was early so not many people were in the front rows. It was still packed all over with tables with Arts and crafts, painting, free give-aways, and food. The best thing after performing and getting some love from people was getting home to message on my machine...... Fish, you and Rich were great and I want to talk to you about coming down to Community Teaching and talk about starting a poetry program. Ahhhhhhhh........... A sigh of success as my words are once again taking us somewhere. As always, I will save my optimism when I am already teaching and getting paid for it. Sure enough, next year will be a year of Poetry and music performing on stage. They had no musicians, singers, or anything. I spoke to Elyse and she was adamant about trying to get something together. She wasnt quite experienced with putting together a show. I figure with Ray, SynonymUS, Peter, Scott, Maya, Abby, Rebecca Hart and every other resource I could tap, we can take a good part of the show. I am shooting for a 4 hour slot of poetry, collabos, Jamming, singing. Mark these words people. I am good I went with my Dad yesterday to Levitz and brought the old fucker a leather recliner he has been gushing over. I also got the reservations for my mothers trip to Puerto Rico. I am back to being officially broke as I spent 1300 bucks yesterday. I was a little bothered when I couldnt find my cell phone but it is in the lost and found of Levitz so I have to go pick it up. Let me run Peace Fish

 Yes folkly folks, The late night post because I am bored. I was about three seconds from heading to this beat box conference but I came home to reast. I got tired and for some reason I wasn't feeling it. I went to the Bowery to take part in this slam anonce I leave somewhere- going back is not an option. I got kinda cranky during this CWP meeting and going home was better. The slam at the Bowery was kinda cool. Regie Gibson came in and took a good part of the foolery. The high school kids were very attentive and that always makes me happy. The slam was a typical three rounds with the best two going head to head in the last round. Farbeon and I made it to the last round and I nudged him for the win. The Q & A session was the best part. Everything was asked from influences, inspiration, writing exercises. Farbeon is really rokcing out with this outreach after-school program. The young adults were geared to a direction of " love writng first, everything comes second " All is good Peace

 Where does my heritage start? Where does my culture start? Forgive me blog world for I will sin. It has been too long since my last post where I acted in a decent manner. Yesterday was my trek to Sarah Lawrence college to support Hermano Garcia in a Latino Symposium. I got there a little late and I have no one to blame but me. I still had a chance to Ed, Jorge Monterossa, Carlos Callejo, and Cesar. Please forgive me for not getting your last name. Much of the conversation touched on holding on to heritage and culture. At least that is what I got out of it. Some things were said and my mind wandered to places where I haven't been in a while. A place where my Puerto Rican heritage comes into question. Everyone knows that I am more Puerto Rican then the island itself. I live everyday to die and have my ashes carried on the shoulders of the winds of Cabo Rojo; my father place of birth. My dad always told me stories of how he grew up. The times where the family would get together during noche Buena and party for hours on end. Stories of how him and his father; my grandfather; would kill and gut a pig and the entire barrio would come over. Special offerings to the three kings were left in the doorway. The coquito; a special concoction with rum; was touching the lips of even the smallest child. The pasteles, flan, tembleque and arroz con gandules were always cooking in the outdoor patio kitchen. The women all enjoyed their sips of vinito (wine)and would ride the bochinche waves of " ay dios mio" and " eso no puede ser". You are eating until your stomach gets full and la Parranda comes and knocks on your door. They all put on their walking shoes and join them in song and dance until the whole barrio is at the square offering Christmas hugs and kisses with Quayos, timbales, and the cuatro's. My Noche buenas paled in comparison. As recently as this year when every Christmas I cry to wish my days where I could have lived deep within my culture, my heritage. Where my Christmas until I was 17 were going to my uncles house and listening to Michael Jackson and hating salsa music. Where I let out a yelp of disgust when I got a bathrobe for a Christmas Present- no six year old child wants a bathrobe; give a brotha some toys. No roasted pigs but a store brought pork shoulder that needed magic to make Puerto Rico ride my tongue. I always wondered why my father would be quiet for two or three hours during my noche buena memories, why I caught my father and uncle in the bedroom crying during the last Christmas party. Now I know. Christmas, easter, Semana Santa will never be like the one at home. The place where I want to have my ashes carried will never be home to me. I will never be accepted by the island that I bleed for everyday. I don't want to grasp the American dream but I can't find acceptance from my culture who considers me an Americanized criminal. I have read books, studied my island, cried when I got there; cried when I left, pledged my allegiance to what I know is true, que soy boriqua. Why am I hurting? Why is my culture one of Ghetto dreams? Why does my hair and olive skin in NYC make me Latino pero en Puerto Rico soy blanco y de aya fuera? I speak spanglish and barely can grasp a good spanish novela. There is so much I can change. There is so much I have to learn to keep what little I have left alive. Walking in NYC is not the same as Puerto Rico. Walking in the Bronx is not the Same as El Barrio. Walking in Puerto Rico is not the same as Spain, Africa y la aztecas. My culture can't be concrete mountains and overhead wires. My heritage can't be dope fiends smelly hallways. I could live my whole life in the Bronx but let me die where my heart is; La isla del encanto! Carajo Puneta; este boriqua se respecta! Yea, respect. Sometimes I wonder why some people insist on losing it. Well, that is another blog on another day at another time. Peace, Love, Porkchops Fish

 P R E - R E L A T I O N S H I P A G R E E M E N T The party of the first part (herein referred to as "She"), being of sound mind and bangin body, agrees to the following with the party of the second part (herein referred to as "Fish"): 1. FULL DISCLOSURE 1.1 At the commencement of said relationship (colloquially referred to as the "first date"), each party agrees to fully disclose any: (1) current girl/boyfriends; (2) dependent children; (3) bizarre religious beliefs; (4) phobias and fears; (5) social diseases; (6) strange political affiliations; or (7) currently active relationships with anyone else that have not yet been terminated. (8) Fetishes 1.2 Further, each party agrees to make known any deep-seated complexes and/or fanatical obsessions with pets, careers, and/or organized sports. 1.3 Failure to make the disclosures in this clause will result in the immediate termination of said relationship before it has a chance to get anywhere. 2. INDEMNIFICATION OF FRIENDS 2.1 Both parties agree to hold the person who arranged the liaison (the "matchmaker") blameless in the event that the "fix-up" turns out to be a "real loser" or" psycho woman". (For definition of "real loser", see "John DeLorean: My Story", available at most bookstores, or any picture of Bob Guccione in "Penthouse". For definition of "psycho woman," see Sharon Stone in "Basic Instinct" or Glenn Close in "Fatal Attraction.") 3.DEFINITION OF RELATIONSHIP 3.1 Should said relationship proceed past the first date, both parties mutually agree to use the following terminology in describing their said "dating": (1) For the first thirty (30) days, both parties consent to say they are "going out".

TERMS OF EXCLUSIVITY 4.1 For the first thirty (30) days, both parties agree not to ask questions about the other party's whereabouts on weekends, weeknights, or over long holiday periods. No unreasonable demands or expectations will be made; "rights" or "holds" on the other party's time. 4.2 Following the first six weeks or forty-five (45) days, if one party continues to be "missing in action" the "wounded party" agrees to "give up". 5.

"Gone." 10. TERMINATION 10.1 Any of the following will be grounds for immediate termination and final dissolution of said relationship: - Infidelity: Running off at any time to console an - ex-girl/boyfriend; - Ending any argument with any of the following - sentences: "My ex used to do that same thing", "Now I know why your ex divorced you", or "You women store fat in your thighs, don't you?" , or " Fuck you then "

 Depending on people is always a crap shoot- you can come off or lose like an asshole. Even though my loss wasn't so detrimental but I pride myself on dependability and support. I was suppose to go take care of some personal business yesterday but I agreed to wait around for a friend of mine to go do our deed together. Of course that motherfucker calls me and says that he is going straight home and now I am stuck at home feeling like vibrator with no batteries - worthless. Flicking through the boob tube yesterday I caught my TV stuck on the Comedy channel. I was anxiously awaiting South park and Chappelle show. Since I haven't paid much mind to these shows and the hoopla surrounding them has been huge; time for Fish's opinion. South Park is still insane as I remember it from several years back. They gave the old " Nambla " episdoe with the Fat kid wanting Mature friends. Holy shit it was funny. Chappelle's show comes up and my eyes are trained directly to the death rays omitting from that 32 inch box. First Skit: A white family with the name " Niggar" Second Skit: Samuel L Jackson Beer Third Skit: Wayne Brady as a gangster Fourth Skit: Chappelle being questioned as a juror The first and third skit had me pretty amused. I always like Wayne Brady and I think he stole that whole skit away from Chappelle. The first skit was funny. It made me think if any family in america can actually have the name Niggar. All in all, the show was ok. For him being edgy and genius is pushing it just a little. If he was on HBO his show would be cancelled within two episodes. Since he is on Comedy central; there is an edge to pushing that envelope. It's still cable in my opinion so why all the Bleeping is really beyond me. ****************************** Tonight we are headed to Sarah Lawrence College for a latino Symposium where Ed Garcia is featuring. We are going to corrupt an incredible amount of white people tonight. This Friday I am slamming at the Bowery. Farbeon is the Director of outreach and Development and he has high school kids coming through to see a slam. It's all in fun so I am pretty excited about it. Saturday, Rich and I are performing for the Bronx River Alliance Festival in the Bronx: more fun Sunday, We are headed to a petition drive in el barrio to get a school named after Pedro Pietri. Monday, bar 13 to see Rich win the slam. Yes I predict it, my nigga Rich is going to do WHAT HE WANTS TO DO and take this motherfucker to the next LEVEL!!!!!!!! Tuesday, Holy Shit!! ACENTOS AGAIN baby. Maria Nieves, Nina, Jessica Torres will be featuring at Acentos. Schedule is pretty packed. Day 13 with no release Peace Fish

 I was talking with a friend of mine last night and we were discussing my type of girl. I just so happened to mention my taste in the opposite sex. I didn't get detailed but I just gave a quick mention of one of my preferences that I discovered the other day. Well, I have been in several relationships; casual or otherwise; and it has all been dramatic to say the least. My international colors of benneton penis can only hope to conquer far off lands one day. I have dated may different colors and ethnic weirdos in my travels. I have been with.... Puerto Ricans Dominicans Peruvians Haitians African-Americans Hondurans Japanese Chinese Koreans Cubans Jewish Ecuadoreans Irish White Colombians Guyanese I think that is the extent of my list. Well, one thing I noticed is my attraction towards the women according to their ethnicity. What do I mean???? Well... here goes: If I see a girl who is Puerto Rican and she is thick ( over 150 ), I am not so attracted to her. Now, if I see a white girl with the same exact measurements as the puerto Rican girl; I am ga-ga. For some reason I have noticed that white girls who are thick grab my attention. Latina girls that are slimmer grab my attention. Black girls have to have a perfect mix ( whatever that is ) to grab my attention. It is weird and I never realized that until recently. I never gave it much thought but I think it is one of those sub-conscious things that lingers unchecked. Of course after giving all these new revelations some thought; I go back to my last relationship. She is latina but she is what I could consider thick. Why was I attracted to her?? Well, from a glance she could look white. Then again, all of this that I just wrote could be bullshit. A piece of me thinks it does not matter what she is; thick, thin, tall, short. As long as she has the ability to make you happy. It's hard these days to keep me happy because I am trying to maintain happiness from within. I have given up on relationships ( Voluntarily) to pursue this poetry dedication much more. To free myself of this wanton guilt I had to make sacrifices and I feel confident over my past decisions. ******************************* On another note: I made a pen pal with a California based pornography publicist who has a hilarious blog. Her name is urlLink Carly Milne and she is funny with her views working in the adult industry. Definitely check out her blog to view the industry from and insider female perspective. If you are not aware of it, there is an H.I.V scare crippling the industry as we speak. This dude Darren James is said to have contracted the disease and thus far has infected one other actress in the industry. Shit is fucked up right now. Several major companies based in California have shut production down and these porn actors might have to...... GASP!!!!!........... find work. I guess even fucking for a living has it's price. Oh wait, even if you don't do it for a living-it can be detrimental. I feel bad for them but if you think those 30 day H.I.V test are teflon shields against " the Monster" - you are a straight up moron. Sad is the girl that contracted the latest case. She is 18 years old and has worked in the industry for about 3 months. She caught it after doing a "double anal " scene with Darren James and another kat. That other dude must be praying to every deity known to man right now. With this latest scare, it has giving the health industry to green light to pursue " Condoms are a must " policy for the production companies. This is going to be a mission because the above average porno aficianado is going to hate it. Some of the heads of the production companies will fight it tooth and nail. Where will it end up will be a mystery. I honestly think that condoms should be made a must for scenes such as double anal and shit. Then again- if 30 day H.I.V test don't cut back the risks; every Monday should be " All pornstars get check for H.I.V day". It doesn't take 2 weeks for results to come back from one lab God knows where. Now it's a 90 minute test in a clinic. It might be a hassle but it's your life. Shit, I might be wrong but that would significantly cut down the risk and exposure. If you think otherwise - well - fuck you then . Do I have a problem using condoms??? Nope. It a hassle but sometimes you have to use them. The last person I was with saw me pull out a condom but I think it was more a fear of getting someone pregnant and having a kid. I am not trying to have kids. I should start thinking of condoms more of a protective tool then a child preventive strategy of mine. Well, Fish is signing off Peace, Love, Porkchops urlLink

 If you see alot of mistakes- I am doing my happy dance. My time to somewhat shine I guess. I just got home and I am thinking over and over again that " I " made finals. By the grace of a hairy asshole; Fish will be amongst 9 poets going to compete for a spot the LouderARTS Project Team 2004. Talk about feeling surreal. Damn, First thing is first....... All of you that e-mailed me during the day and wished me luck - thank you from the bottom of my heart. The one's that called me right before the slam - I am lovin ya. The love and support is what got me through this slam without having a nervous breakdown. Yesterday at 6pm I ate dinner at my mother's house; I threw it up at 6:29. It tasted much nastier coming up then going down. The nerves, the headache, the wooziness all kicked in. This made me happy because I know the more nervous I am; I am remaining humble in my writing and in my place in spoken word. It was a good night tonight with a sparse crowd bordering on Intimate. I tried to maintain some type of cool but I hit the bathroom about three times to do my own relaxing techniques. Breathe in......... Breathe out......... Look in the mirror......." you can do this Fish " Carlos went and did his " What are words worth" and kicked things off with a 24.8. I hit the second slot and I started my piece. The first three lines were all a blur. I know I flubbed big time but I gained enough composure to finish the piece rather confidently. The judges came back with a 25.5. After that, shit just got fuzzy. R.A.C . Morgan, and George McGibbons went after me and killed it. First Round Carlos 24.8 Fish 25.5 RAC 26.0 Morgan 26.6 George 24.8 Second Round Morgan 24.8 (51.4) RAC 25.2 ( 52.7) Fish 25.7 (50.8) Carlos 22.8 (47.6) George 27.9 (52.7) Third Round George 26.7 -.05 = 26.2 ( 78.9 ) RAC 25.2 (77.9) Morgan 22.0 ( 73.4) Fish 25.5 ( 76.5) Carlos 22.8 (70.4 ) Fourth Round George 24.2 ( 103.1 ) RAC 25.9 ( 103.8 ) Fish 25.5 ( 102.0 ) Morgan 23.3 ( 96.7 ) Carlos 25.1 ( 95.5 ) Standings RAC 103.8 GEORGE 103.1 FISH 102.0 And just like that , I move into Finals. It was a great slam and being with what many consider the best, makes me humbled very very quickly. RAC and George are by far the best people I have ever slammed against. RAC is so non-chalant and is the typical definition of Cool! George writes in a way that people should hope they can. One of the Judges were being undoubtedly extra harsh. Tyemba Jess was one of the judges and that motherfucker had no problem giving a .1 or a .5 to certain poets. I am not shittin you. He gave out 00.5 's and 00.1's. I figure that he kept it real as real can get. I am glad I wasn't on the receiving end of a score that would make you question your writing. I know some poets talk shit about judges not knowing what real poetry is when they get a low score. Here goes " Mr Academia" giving out these low scores and you can't argue that he doesn't know his shit. I was ok with how he scored me.... I think the lowest he gave me was a 7.6 or something like that. I feel good and I know I have great work ahead of me. For those three seconds in which I knew I was moving into finals- it is great. Then comes the weeks and weeks of edits and performance tips. I look forward to it. Let me run and try to sleep Peace Oh, seriously, Thank all of you that have supported me and showed me love. May 10th is Finals. I am getting the Bronx to COME DOWN!!! LOL Fish

 Sometimes TV is worse then a punch to the face- you could be knocked out or not even phased at all. Sopranos is sucking major ass this season. Anyway..... I am good. Good day yesterday as I took most of my day practicing and relaxing. The weather is going to be crazy today. I was about three seconds from staying home but I am saving all my days for the second half of the year. I am definitely sneaking out today. This weather got me all happy and shit. I finally got to write one of my boys on lockdown. I have been trying to get his addy for about 3 years. I finally got that shit on Saturday. I am probably the only kat who writes to the incarcerated brothas I know. Most of my peeps don't believe in picking up a pen and licking a stamp. If I ever get locked up, I will never expect a letter them. I would barely expect a letter from these poet motherfuckers. We should start an excercise on how to write a letter to people who are locked up. Step 1 Always start the letter: " Hello My Brother, I hope when this letter passes through the many strange hands to reach you; You and your family are in the best of health under the guidance of God." Step 2 Write the body of the text and include postive messages. Don't write about the great time you are having in the clubs and the girls you are having sex with. Downplay everything and make sure you emphasize how much things are not the same out here. Step 3 Make sure you note you are not willing to do any favors, ie; sending money, sending drugs, visiting, taking collect calls, buying clothes, taking care of his kids. Step 4 Close the letter like this " Keep ya head up and be strong, stay out of trouble After that, you should be ok. Send the letter and expect a letter from them in return still askin for shit. Oh well Let me bounce I am SLAMMIN TONIGHT!!!!!! 4 rounds of shoot em poetry Fish

 Tick tock...tick tock........tick.......tock........tick...........tock. Slowly, you are going to see the end of spoken word poetry if bullshit keeps getting 9.9 in slams judged by swedish tourist that laugh at inane lines. This is how I felt when I went to the Nuyo Friday and was totally dissappointed in what I heard. Sometimes I wonder when are people going to pick up a poetry book and realize what poetry should be. Then again, performance poetry is completely different right ? Well, if anyone wants to perform a poem and give it life with yells, rants, and bullshit lines; your poetry will leave a mark like Tony Deplastico. Do you remember Tony DePlastico???? Go Ahead and say No that is the point I am trying to make. This Kat August won the slam and is headed to the Grand Slam on May 7th. I hope to see good ol fashioned well crafted and edited work. What was cool was my Break Poet slot. I had an opportunity to practice my new memorized poem and it went over well. I made about 1 visible mistake but about 4 the crowd was not aware. Shit- I just started memorizing it this week. Give a brotha credit. The open room was cool with Rich hosting a choc full room of 5 people on the open mic list. There was some cool first timers which made me miss that humble attitude that most of us had when we first started. I ws thinking about the open room and it should have been packed. Maybe one day we should just make flyers and give people crazy incentive to come out. I think Julio would die if we had an open mic list of 20 people reading and we would finish at 5am. We should pick a date and get all the Acentos folks out there. Maybe bribe them with free libation or something. :)~ Yesterday morning was an interesting trek. Yes, you read that right. YESTERDAY MORNING. I hit the respect the mic shindig thrown together by ordinary Joe. I have some serious love for that kat because he is working hard at his series. Then he is humble and mad low key. We threw around some ideas and he is on the right track. Bob was happy with respect the mic repped pretty heavy with Acentos . The open mic was ok and I did my thing. It was too early for me to be out there. There was a moment where I was half asleep and I had to walk back and forth to stay awake. M.C s had his first official feature yesterday and he rocked out. Nothing beats that first time when you feature. You will remember every aspect of your feature; Friends, nerves, poems, lights, the love. He really did his thing and I cant say nothing but good things. He gave us his everything with New Poems, old poems, and experimental work. Matt is going to work his way to being one of the premiere poets in NYC in the future. His page work has to be one of the strongest on the scene. We all hung out afterwards and I had a great time. We headed a little cafe; Odessa; and we ate like fools. I ate a burger well done and that shit went through me faster then a warm drink of water. Mental note: Never eat there again. After some great conversation about movies, poetry, Diane admitting she was Bi, we headed out and called it a daytime day. I dropped Rich and Ray off in Dominican land ( inwood ) and it was fuckin hell. Thousands of dominicans plugging and campaigning for the Domincan president searching re-election. purple flags and cars honking crazy. It took me way toooo long to leave. After coming home and grabbing the best nap I ever had; Eric came to my house and we headed down to forbidden City. It is a little Bar on 14 street to Bid Helen yum farewell to her move to Hawaii. Yep, fuckin Hawaii. It was a good day yesterday. I spent a good time with these poet folks and it was cool. I spent the night with eric until 5am this morning and that shit is a mission in itself. Yesterday was one of those days that made me appreciate these poets more then the usual. I never hang out with them as much as I should but I know there is a love I cant describe. I got this letter from a poet yesterday wishing me luck in my upcoming semi. I get letter and e-mails on a regular basis. Something that comes from the heart and is as sincere as that poet himself makes me all tingly inside. " Fish, I may be able to get to 13 for the early segment of the evening, but I have a longstanding concert ticket that will ensure I miss your slam. I wanted to take a moment to say good luck and represent way in advance. you are my biggest single inspiration to slam - i think you said, "why not?" which is my favorite impetus to do just about anything. it has been a joy to watch you grow as a performer and an artist and i'm looking forward to the slam judges having enough sense to see how wonderfully you wear the face of poetry." My life is good. Peace Fish

 - Either luck or planning for an absurd amount of time has kept me alive and out of " graybar Motels" - Been pensive since yesterday. I realized nothing in life is secure. No matter how great it looks, it will always all be vulnerable - I need a hot chocolate from McD's really fuckin bad - I am performing with Rich at the Bronx River Flotilla celebration. About 6000 people have been mailed flyers with our names on it. Non-profits are a form of mafia - Since yesterday, I have no patience. I want to step back and stay away. I have too much on my plate and I can't take time away for me - The first one that talks shit about Kwame not getting the job because he is black - I will smack em with no qualms - People break things down they can't control. If it wasn't their idea, consciously or not, they will hate. Support is far and few these days - Kill Bill Volume 2 better be hot. - angry - I have memorized my 1st round poem for my semi's on Monday. I will read Friday night at Nuyo open and Saturday to support Matt at Respect the mic - Ms Info from Hot 97 is Korean - I thought she was black - Hip-hop sucks right now - I am slamming at the Bowery for about 20 high school kids - I am teaching at Rikers tonight. Diane is coming with me. I am not liking people e-mailing telling me that this is what's going to happen at Rikers when no one has checked with me. - I am thinking about going back to the GYM. Not to lose weight- power lift and gain muscle. - 2 people came out H.I.V positive in the Adult industry. 60 actors have been quarantined. - I would like to Punch Quentin tarantino in the face too. Why?? If Guy wants to, the reason has to be good. " Quentin, call me " - Poetry is nothing but what that person thinks it is. There is no across the board definition of what Poetry is. - Saw Lenny two days in a row; Only times I have smiled have been from 8:30am - 9:00am - My hair is long. - I haven't jerked off in three days; I have no sexual desires at all - I miss being 20 - I miss my three fingers - in 1992, 2,245 people were killed in NYC. That was a good year for me. I was happy I'm out Fish

 It's one of those days where I am happy to be......... me! Last night was a goooood night. I hung out with my Man Eric and we shot some pool. It felt so good to play pool at that level. Running out games and making shots that would make the seasoned pro go " wow ". The first 9 games were serious and teetered between "competitive" and " Hustling ". If you know anything about pool, you know what I am talking about. After some heart to heart emotional bonding, the cappucino's were ordered. That slick motherfucker made mine with a double shot of expresso without telling me. I wanted "brown red bull" with ice so I chilled it. That shit hit me immediately! I was wired son. Eric is laughing at me and convinced me to get another one. Mind ya, I wasn't aware it was a double. I get another double and I chill it and I down it. One cappucino gets me wired to the point where I can't sleep. Imagine two doubles! Oh fuck. I came home and I couldn't even write, watch TV, think, watch my Fish, Turtle, Porn. NOTHING! A piece of me was wondering what is inside of the turtle. Then I was like..... nah.... " If I open it, he would die" Last night we laughed over the stupidest things in the world. We joked on " Lumidee" ( that chic with the Oh- oh song during the summer). She is the definition of a one hit wonder and we gigged on her all night. Driving through Manhattan we would drive by Bars and look at the people standing outside. For some reason, when we were stopped at a red light, I looked to my right and saw a group of about 12 - 15 people. I opened the window and at the top of my lungs: " REPENT SINNERS AND CLEANSE YOURSELF OF THE DEVILS LIBATION!" Holy shit, I laughed so hard! Them folk jumped out of their shirts. They looked at me with my afro looking crazy and they were like...... oh shit. Eric took off and laughed to the point that our sides were hurting. Another highlight of the night was when we were driving in Queens and Eric burped. It smelled like a garlic field was growing in his mouth. He took over the car and I was like " What THE FUCK"!!. I started fanning that shit away and stuck my head out the window. How can somebody burp and have it smell like geriatric old ass? wow I love my man Eric. No talk of Poetry, drama, bullshit, issues, beef. We just joked and all the cares in the world were back at home. After he dropped me off, I was still wired but I could still appreciate the tight friendship we have. Let me rephrase that, the tight brotherhood we have. IN the pre-poetry clique, the runners were Eric, Oscar, Tom, Mike, Jose, Jay,Me, Keith and a few others that don't really make the cut. The biggest heart was always Eric in my eyes. Jose comes a close second. Eric is the one that has always had the most real advice and loving eyes that say " Dude, everything is going to be cool ". That little dude has been there for me at the lowest parts in my life and there is nothing I wouldn't do for him. I won't question whatever he needs and I will just do it. Shit, He saved my ex's life when he came to pick me up at 3am. Yea, It was bad. It's good to have a friend, a brother, and a mentor Peace Fish

 SON!!!!!!!!!!!! pool, I kicked ass!! Two cappucino's that were spiked with two shots of expresssssoooo!!!!!!!! Yeah baby!! LOL I forgot how much fun a night can be when you are wired! LOL I normallllly would punch Eric in te head but hey, we had a ball. Broke on J-lo most of the night, joked around on the 4 expressssooooo shots! WEPAAAAAA!!!!! Popeye's chicken is da shit right before callin it a night. the girl that served us is named " Shekema! I called her " he -kemo " - she didn't like that . It was funny! I don't care. Strips clubs suck! Tried to charge 15 dollars to go pee! Pee??? Get me the golden toilet puneta! I'm out! viva la le Expresso!! viva le cafe!!! Viva my type 2 adult on-set diabetes!! VAYA!!!!!!!! WEPA AAAAAAAA hasta carajo PUNETAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!

 When I gets to typing, I never really know what's going to come out. I tend to just think of something and flow. Usually, my blog gives you somewhat of an insight from the day before. So, not to break tradition - this is what happened yesterday. Anybody can tell you that has run a poetry series, it's a job that is rarely appreciated with little reward. It is hard as hell. The energy you have to put into it could never be paid back in any form; monetary, sexual, kudos or whatever. Sometimes you wake up the morning of your series and wonder why it is worth it. Well, when you have a bar with 60 people wanting to hear poetry and nothing more, it makes it special. When you have smiles plastered across every face when you hear that one line that connected with the whole crowd. An open mic with 20 people who are mixed with new voices and old. When even the regulars are gracious enough to sit back and let the new voices shine in their spot, this make Acentos the best thing in many people's lives. Yesterday I was driving home and I was genuinely happy. It was probably the first show since day one where nothing needed tweaking, change, suggestions , etc. Everything is thrown to the side on that date and we head towards perfection. I don't even know if I should dare say this. Seems that what we are doing at Acentos is seeping over to bar 13. People are coming back to Bar 13 and seeing sort of the same atmosphere we are harnessing at Acentos. A place where we are not afraid to joke. A place where we unbutton our top button from a long work day shirt. A place where we engage the crowd with a loving hug from the stage to the door. Could it be that Acentos is affecting ( or Infecting ) others?? I don't know. I do know that people love Acentos and the love they have for the art. That love follows us; and the crowd follows that love. Last night I saw Rich sitting in a corner and that seemed weird to me. He was doing the same thing I do when I go home. He just reflects at the moment. I do it when I am alone and driving home. Rich ,Oscar, Jess, and I will always have love for the art. We will always have love for Acentos. Regardless of what happens to make the unbearable justified, we will always have love for each other. A good night. A good Night Now folks, Don't even get it twisted. The next Acentos is going to be fuckin big. We have our first ladies of Acentos ( Acentas ) reppin the latinahood!!!! I am soo excited to have this show at Acentos. Peace P.S There were two people that I sorely missed last night and I hope you will both make it to the next installment of Latinoness. Lenny, I hope you will come support your sisters. Guy, where da fuck were you last night ? Fish

 ....... is gonna bit ya on the ass. Well, the first semi's came and went and Celena Glenn is a fuckin powerhouse. I can't get over her sly delivery - she has this style that I could barely explain. Last night was a good night. It was one of the better nights actually. The lull at 13 has been really upsetting but we are riding the energetic wave from the anniversary show. At least I hope so. Last night proved just that as I counted 79 people when I handed the door off to Lynne. Well, 79 people is better then 29 a few weeks ago. It was a good open mic with some of the Louder teamsters delivering new work in honor of National Poetry Month. I was the sorbet poet so I read within the Slam. My work wasn't brand new but it was only read once before for a slam. The new edits went over well as I tried to read the piece from a narrative perspective. Onward to the slam.... Oh God....... Why........oh why....!!!!!! ?????? Last night was Jive Poetic, Abena Koomson, Diane Roy ( TP ) Bonafide Rojas, Celena Glenn. I was paying more attention to this slam as next week I will partake in the festivities and hopefuly hold my on against 4 other motherfuckers that have nats experience. How did I get myself into this ?? I have no clue. Anyway...... Round 1 Jive poetic comes out with a new piece that I never heard before but it wasn't really crafty. It was more of a straight-up delivery with little imagery. In going first - that is hard enough as it is. After he was scored by our scorekeeper Seve - Jive poetic 26.3 Abena 27.5 Diane 27.0 *( -.5 ) = 26.5 Bonafide 28.4 Celena 28.1 Round 2 After the hoopla was getting heavy- Eric was blowing through the slam. Several judges repping the BX, the B.K, Russia and Mexico AND IT WAS INTERESTING.. It was to early to tell but Round 2 can make or break. From the highest score to the lowest was the order at hand Bonafide 26.6 (55.0) Celena 28.5 (56.6) Abena 27.6 (55.1) Diane 27.6 *(-.5 ) = 27.1 (53.6) Jive 27.1 (53.4) Round 3 So Diane got a time penalty two times so far. I doubt she would get a third but who knows with these slams what could happen. Round three comes and we have more of Celena Glenn Coming up. Celena 28.9 (85.5) Abena 26.8 (81.9) Diane 26.4 *(-.5)=25.9 (79.5) Jive 26.4 (79.8) Bonafide 27.4 (82.4) Sorbet Round: Some fat Puerto Rican fuck goes and reads a poem- he sucked. Oh wait, I was the one that read. I am still a fat Puerto Rican fuck! Good piece, very personal. Round 4 Holy shit!! Three time penalties in a row!! What the fuck?! She got a time penalty last year that cost her semi's. Then, she tries to sing some shit at the start and finish of a poem. Who the fuck siad you had to sing?? IT"S POETRY CARAJO!!!! Now, I could cop that plea since I am new to this whole thing. What the fuck is her excuse??? I am sorry.... Let me see........ NO EXCUSE!! From now on..... Anything you practive at home has to be under 2:50. You say it was??? Well, you are a special case now. Anything you PRACTICE HAS TO BE UNDER 2;30! Brevity is now your forte!! Anyway, Round 4 comes and the A.D.D starts to kick in as I can see who will make the finals. Celena 26.6 (112.1) Bonafide 28.8 (111.2) Abena 26.9 (108.8) Jive 27.4 (107.2) Diane 28.0 (107.5) After the usual " the best poets always lose " bit - we bid farewell to two poets. Diane "Time Penalty" Roy is kicked to the curb. Jive poetic is also given walking papers. What kills me is this " If Diane would have stood under time - she would have garnered a 109 straight. That would have been enough to get her into the finals. So, for flirting with the time penalty three times in a row - you get the jack ass poet award in my blog. Please feel free to pick up your donkey kick at your convenience" Good night and I am off to practice and make sure I hold my own next week. It is going to be hard and my nerves are stacked on top of each other. Time will tell. Fish

 I don't really sit down and think about life as much as I used to. I tend to do that when nothing is going on. I had time to reflect on " nothing" that was going on. When your life has that void, you use the excuse of " reflection" to compensate that emptiness. I have caught myself giving a laundry list of things that I have done with people I haven't seen in a while. I found it somewhat pompous and overwhelming at some points. Most of my people's that I grew up with are straight from the ghetto and haven't had a positive thing in who knows how long. When I meet up with them and speak about Rikers, Fortune, shows, workshops, Acentos, Louder, Readings, Poems, Books...... I catch them shutting down after about 5 mins. I usually get the " Damn Fish, That shit is good. You doing your thing ". After that , I just ask " What's the deal with you dawgs?" and I let them speak about their life and what is going on. Don't get it twisted, It is great writing material. I am debating on writing a poem for the dead kats around my way. Something to give them a voice after they have passed. The question is, where can I start with so many people that have passed away.? In thinking about my life and what I have been through. I have always compared myself to Janet Brady. That middle child in the middle of everything. I have felt this everyday I wake. I am in the middle between the working class corporate schmucks and the Ghetto slum lowlives. I could easily transform and be accepted into either society. I have never felt smart enough to get over this hump into the intellectual academia forums. I lost my ghetto credibility when I stepped back fully about 18 months ago. It was no more " call Fish, he'll take care of it". Now you hear names of people with no clue of how to handle things properly and discreetly. It's sad. Lift your wants between the grains of dirt. memories stain my tongue With tears, cry back to us Good Start - Peace Fish

 It's all about the hustle son. Not what you know but who you can intimidate. This has always been the rule. You can be a nice guy but make sure that whoever you grace knows you have no qualms putting a bullet in their face. This doesn't quite apply to the poetry world but in the ghetto; it reigns supreme. Even though my career as .........well....... a very convincing person is over, I relished in some of the things I did. From bouncing to just being back end muscle, it was all good. The gool ol days Now, I have Fish, turtles, and poetry LOL Fish

 My Fish tanks are rockin. I have 4 Oscars ( 2 tigers, 2 red ), 2 tinfoils, 2 Columbian Sharks ( Cat Fish ). I have totally jumped back into a hobby that found a back seat to poetry. Today, I jumped into another field of nature. I brought me a ed eared slider turtle and named him Pablo Elliot Neruda ( P.E.N ). The turtle is kick-ass. I throw in a feeder fish and Pablo does not waste two seconds in eating his dinner. I have him in a ten gallon tank but next week I am picking up a 30 gallon to give him the room he needs. I am really loving this little dude. I am good. Let me get back to editing some poems too. I am slamming the 19th. Ugh Peace Fish

 ....they beat the shit out of Jesus. It is no longer the day our savior sacrificed his life for us. They beat the shit out of him until he finally said " Fuck this, I am dying " Thank you Mel Gibson for skewing the views of anyone who sees your movie. Also, your violent ass came off with about 300 million profit from your movie. I wonder what your next movie is?? The final 3 minutes of JFK's life from the view of the bullets that went into his head? Maybe the story of the electrical currents that went into Ted Buny's body. How about the cotton that was shoved up his ass to avoid him from shittin all over the place. " The Ted Bundy story: Told from the cotton used to catch his shit" Weird I am back and I am not dead. Long day yesterday that ran into today You all be good Peace, Love, Porkchops. Fish

 Yesterday was one of those proactive and constructive days that make you happy you are alive. After much back and forth debate; my ass hit Barnes and Noble to support, stalk and show love to Willie Perdomo. One of the poets that I am still in awe from. Seeing Willie doing his thing was hot. I think Rich got to him when he featured for Acentos because he read new work from his upcoming manuscript, "Emergency Money". The poetry mainly came from his new book, Smoking lovely. The crowd was decent and the Q & A after wards was hot. The highlight came when a young latina woman asked about Cave Canaam accepting latin folks. Willie answered graciously and she asked again where can she find support for Latino Writers. Wille says: "There is an awesome groups of brothers and sisters up in the Bronx called Acentos and they have been great. They are really doing their thing and they harness mostly everything latino. They have been the best I have seen for Latino poetry. They are also a part of the louderARTS Project and they run workshops and such. Fish is a part of them and is right there in the back and he can answer any questions for you" After I wiped the cum stain off my pants, I couldn't hold on the the flyers fast enough. Talk about a great opportunity to let those white folk in Manhattan know there is something in the Bronx Willie Perdomo Respects and loves. Can you say " Wow "? After some networking and such, I was debating on heading to Carlitos or the Bowery to support brother Shawn Randall. A flip of the mental quarter and I hit the Bowery. I was kinda scared because when Shawn was doing West side Rhyme; I did not like that venue nor format. Something about it screamed " yuck". I haven't heard anything about it but I crossed my fingers and hoped for the best. I got there and copped a seat in the back. As some of the poetry came from people I have heard before, I was more amazed with their performance and the welcoming and embracing atmosphere. Mara went up there and killed it. My upcoming slam nemisis ( George McKibbons )went up there and just made me wonder how the fuck I am going to top him in the upcoming slam on April 19. What I never liked about some venues ( including Louder ) is the mix of Musicians and Poetry. It has to be something really spectacular in order for me to gush over it. Yesterday was perfect when it came down to a mix that is not my favorite. It wasn't too much but just enough. Only one dude was depressing as fuck but to each their own. I have to really applaud Shawn on a great show and a good atmosphere. He was a nervous wreck at the very start but he held his own. He spoke respectfully to the crowd and the banter was held to a minumum. The show was just about that, the show. His little skit about reading from a teleprompter was the small knack of humor the night needed and it created a consistancy of the night without a lull that made my A.D.D kick in. If you haven't checked out Symphonics, I would highly suggest to do so. His 50 or so patrons are a testemant to his hard work and dedication to this show. Shit, he even had a program of the night with all the bios of all the performers. That theater experience is a bitch. Kudos After some great conversation with Guy, Roger, Bob, Marty, mara, Eric (g)....... my ass had to head home because Fish was not staying at a bar until who knows when. Another interesting tidbit is a magazine that Guy put me on too. I never have been into Vibe and XXL and all those other magazines that want to " keep it real ". I just put my ear to the ground in the Bronx and follow the gunshots and get all the news I need from the face looking into the sky blankly lying in his blood and garbage. This magazine, Don Diva, is pretty harsh. All the shit you don't want cops to know is splattered across color pages of half naked video rump shakin hoochies. Drug dealing tips as to where to stash your shit. Personally, I don't find that too cool. The streets are like a cosa nostra that not many should speak about. Here and there you will have a knucklehead say something but not in a national magazine. Times a changing. Peace, Love, Porkchops

 Gratuitously borrowed from Guy via Tony Brown 1. Grab the nearest book. 2. Open the book to page 23. 3. Find the fifth sentence. 4. Post the text of the sentence in your journal along with these instructions. -" I have so little, my son " he said suddenly the loving patriarch. ("The Read tent " Anita Diamant) - * "Falls in it's own time, in its own rhyme, yellow leaf" ( Except by Falling by Sean Thomas Dougherty) * The fifth sentence( Line ) just had the word " leaf ", I also added what preceded the 5th sentence.

 Sometimes I check my e-mail and it's nothing more then robotic. - Sign on AOL - Check e-mail - no reaction - sign off Once in a blue moon I get an e-mail that makes me soo happy. I never know where to expect the e-mails to originate from but I do know when I get them - I am good. When I first started this poetry debacle that is quickly transforming into a passion, there was a venue in Brooklyn called " Morgies". It was the brainchild of Roger and Lynne. I am still pissed they let it go to the land of shit but that is their issue and not mine. Not the point. We used to trek it to the deepest bowels of Brooklyn to read poetry and I was really loving that spot. They had a cappucino that made sex a distant second in my book. Roger also managed to bring down some of the most awesome poets on the scene. One day while attempting to write and perform poetry ( the battle still continues till this day ), I made a fool out of myself by choking in the first three lines of my poem. Mind you, this was in front of Willie Perdomo. After that, I worked a little harder and read off the page. I read this poem called "fear", and it dealt mainly with death, my lack of fear in anything, and " if you fuck with me I have no problems killing you ". I read that poem and got my polite and controlled applause and walked off stage. That evening urlLink Bassey , Shane Koyscan and Kevin Coval were in attendance. I had no clue who they were but in the poetry community, they are what many consider heavy weights. At the end of the evening, we are all taking pictures with a digital camera and we are posing like fools. Bassey jumps in one picture and I proceed to hug her, flip her upside down and hold her by her ankles and we take a picture like that . I just met her that day and it was hard for her to warm up to me after that. She goes up to Kevin Coval and tells him...... Bassey: " You let him do that to me, aren't you going to do anything?" Kevin: " Didn't you hear the poem that guy just read?" It was one of those moments that you really can't forget. Bassey was one of the first people who has witnessed me making a fool out of myself on the mic. She saw me read this past Saturday at Louder then words and this is what I get : [hey.you] just wanted to tell you how absolutely wonderful your poem was on Saturday. I hope to God, this doesnt sound condescending, but Im so happy to hear how much Your work and your performance has grown since the first time I saw you. I think you Are absolutely brilliant and I look forward to hearing more of your work in the future. Love to love ya, B. ahhhhh... the lovely young Bassey made my month. When you are reading on the scene you tend to stagnate amongst the peers who hear your work frequently. So this e-mail coming from her ( being a heavyweight and all ) gives me good reason to feel...... well........ good. Thanks girl Gotta work.. Peace, Love, Porkchop Fishdawg

 I am happy. 120 some odd people were at 13 last night to celebrate the pompous poets anniversary shindig. I say pompous because we HAVE THAT RIGHT CARAJO! It was good to get there at 7pm and see almost the whole Louder crew there ready and willing to be constructive in their participation. Shit, Jayme and Ginna took my job of the door and I was happy to mingle out and about amongst the crowd. The night was full of Thank you's , love, appreciation, plugs and... uh..... oh yea... " Poetry ". With a short open mic with Eliel, John, Bizzart, and suzy Folliette it was solid and good to see new voices interspersed with old. I know, I am forgetting some but those are the one's I put a mental block on intentionally to forget them ( ie; Big mike ) The show itself was a nice concept as M.C had the emotional hammer of the evening and gave the best speech as to what louder stands for. Not many people understand. You can not come to louder ( bar 13 ) with a typical poem ranting and raving and think you deserve genius accolades. You better sit and edit your pieces and ensure craft is first and foremost on your list. Some slackers in the community think this mindset is elitist and exclusive. Well, if you want to write bullshit and be close minded as to the advice of others on your work; I guess we are pompous. We are pompous, egotistical elitist asshole poets with the best poetry on this side of the east coast. Rives has issues. Ahhhhhh..........Rives the white boy poet who must have heard I was a nice guy as he made some comments to me that usually would have gotten the layman poet/patron smacked. It was all taken in good gest and I was actually really impressed. Most of the people I respect on the scene I take their love of certain poets seriously. Taylor went on the stage and gushed over rives as one of the best poets on the scene. So, I naturally sat there and listened to everything that came out of his mouth. The best??? Nahhhh.....but he is certainly different and you can tell that is what puts him on a pedestal all his own. Nice night Peace

 - Friday was interesting as a student of mine at Rikers tried to Act up. He didn't want to write, read, participate. Fine, then stay there and enjoy what you hear. He insisted on talking shit and disrupting my class. He confronted me and I told him to see me after he gets out. I threw him out of my class. Fuck him. - The bus took 55 mins to come to get me off that fuckin island. I went home pissed, aggravated but somewhat accomplished with a very successful class. - Saturday saw me getting some more materials for my Fish tank project. I am getting back into my fish and I forgot how much fun it is. I got a phonecall from Eric inviting me to a birthday dinner. I was like " Who's birthday is it?", he says... "mine". I forgot Eric's Birthday. I am such a piece of shit. So now the guilt is coming on strong and I had to go meet up with him for dinner. The whole fam was there and I had one of the greatest times in a long time. - preceding the dinner was my showcased reading at Louder Then words. I can say shit about the show since I had to leave immediately after my reading. I went to go meet up with Eric and the fam so instead of moving my car from a good parking, I took a cab up. I made a mistake soo......... - I got a $115 dollar parking ticket. I am fighting that shit. - Sunday saw me searching for two Colombian Sharks ( CaTfish ) for my FishTank. I found them on my old block in a hot little pet shop. I put them in and it was so cool seeing them in my tank with my other Fish. Saw the soprano's last night and this was a fuckin novela. I am not so happy with this season. - I would write about my sexual tryst last night but I am not at liberty to talk about my personal sex life - regardless of how much I paid for her or not. - Louder Monday anniversary show tonight. It's gonna be big. ( At least I hope so ) Peace, Love, Porkchops

 How and when do you learn to love poetry is beyond me. Yesterday I went to support Ray at the Jersey ART house in jersey City. I got there in time to see some open mic folk and was eagerly waiting for Ray to assist Rick Pernod. Man, the script was flipped as Ray put it and all the open mic'ers were put on before Ray and Rick. I wanted to stay but my dawg Eric doesn't feel Poetry and the look on his face was painful. Not the hernia operation he just went through, just the amount of poetry that he considered dismal. So an early exit and a hug for Ray to show taht I came out to show him love and off Eric and I went. It was a good day to hang with Eric as I wanted to get some lovely things off my chest. Then I realized what I was getting off my chest was petty and not worth venting over. If he is not wasting his breathe, I tend to know it's all bullshit. I am the first one saying that I am not trying to deal with bullshit but here spoon feeding it by great loads. Some things in my life are pretty cut and dry. Black and white, good or bad. There are not many shades of gray when I walk my walk. Do I consider myself a self righteous zealot with no consideration for others who choose to destroy their lives??? Well, yea. I grew up in a neighborhood with a mentality that bullshit has zero tolerance in our book. I have smacked dudes for just saying something stupid and delving into territory where they deserved what they got. ie " yo fish, why does your mother have an orange afro"? One look, one smack " don't ever talk about my mother" Get my drift? well, I have had some differences with people and it does get tiring sometimes. The differences range from personal to business from my job to the workshops we facilitate. I have never labeled myself a controlling czar. I try to maintain an open mind as to what is best for whatever I/we do. I do know that if anyone approaches me with bullshit that I am going to give them bullshit back. After some unfortunate circumstances and situations- time has to come to work on some things. This reactionary brother is not running thought. I am taking my time to make sure whatever I do is the right decision. Until then life is good. Fish

 YOu ever had a moment in your life when you thought you had your finger in almost everything; then you are smacked in the face with som much new info that you are overwhelmed? This is the feeling I had yesterday with my first meeting at the BCA ( Bronx Council on the Arts ). Firstly, I went to the wrong location as I thought the Bronx writers center was the BCA. Another 5 minute drive and I made it where I was supposed to be in the first place. The brunt of the meeting were different events going on in the Bronx. Where everyone stands and who's finger is in what. I was naturally stand offish since Acentos is pretty much self contained amongst it's organizers. Coming soon we will have an event at Acentos to raise funds for a new up-start organization. A piece of me still wonders why they want us to help them. Then again, a piece of me sees Acentos reeping major benefits down the road from this endeavor. Either workshops, teaching gigs, feature work etc.. it all will pay off in the long run. When I met with the guys at Acentos we agreed to concentrate on making contact with community based organizations. We went one step further and put the finger into something that is taking baby steps. In assisting them with whatever we can do, it makes my heart flutter. Unfortunately, the lady running it has her head several inches up her ass but she is a nice lady. Dealing with Casiano, Aguado and several other folks makes me wonder how these folks do business. They are a rather " jovial" bunch in their own merry devils nectar ingesting type of way. So far it seems that we have a date nailed down and the 13th will be kinda big. It will be hot but it will be big. Sometime next week we have a full story coming out in the Bronx Beat which is a Columbia Based journalism periodical that concentrates on Bronx events. She was at the anniversary show and she has gushed over what she saw since that day. I started reading " the Red tent" authored by Anita Diamant and the first chapters have managed to keep me interested. I am not too much into fiction ( historical or otherwise ) but the book seems promising. The book is also closely related to biblical aspects and you all know I can't stand religion. Yet, diamant has some greatly placed poetic devices in this book that makes me say " wow". " words flowed out of her mouth like water onto sand " With lines like that, she better keep it up before I give the book back to Maria with several pages ripped out. Let me bounce, I got way to intellectual today ewww YUCK BLAUGH!!! FISH

 Bad- Cleaning a fish tank and siphoning out the water. You suck too hard and get a mouth full of Fish tank water Worse - Swallowing a mouth full Bad- getting caught watching a porno Worse - with ky and a sock in one hand and the penis in the other Bad - Saying another's girls name during sex Worse - saying a guy's name Bad - Can't get it up during sex Worse - she pulls out a dildo and says " use this " Bad - You are ON the train and fart worse - when farting you feel an escape from your ass and it drips Bad - Her breathe smells like rancid death Worse - Her Blowjobs are incredible ( You are torn ) Bad - You are doing 69 and she farts in your face Worse - you fart back and she likes it Bad - is it in ? worse - are you done

 I will never ever in my fuckin life rent a u-haul. but I will definitly eat more steak in my life

 This is what I get for writing on blogger instead of microsoft word. As I was saying before my post was lost - I was doing some things yesterday and it took alot out of me. I got home and layed on the couch and I slept heavily. Of course being on the couch until 3am is one of my more common mistakes. I should learn by now that sleeping on the couch will rob me of any and all energy for the next day. I managed to peel this fatness off the couch to wash my face. After coming back; I was visually kidnapped by the TV-HBO to Be exact. They were giving "Natural born Killers" at 3am. How much do I love this movie??? Enough to stay awake and lose some serious sleep. When this movie came out in 1994, I was amazed. At first, I was completely awestruck over the killings and murders on the big screen. Not many movies delved into violence but this movie jumped head first. As I got older I started dissecting this movie more and more. The symbolism and message was far deeper then two serial killers catching wreck across the United States. Every killing, every camera angle, every line was a segue to a deeper meaning. The media was perpetrated as the whore's for ratings they are. The killings were glorified in the media as we have seen even in real life. IF Nick Berg was just found dead; would he have gotten that much media frenzy. Something about this flick always touched me and even back then I knew I despised the media. Seems as if nothing has changed in the 10 years since the release of this film. I hated the media back then; I hate them more now. Ironic is how I have become an avid reader of the times, daily news, post, and varied news sites. I have always loved hearing about news but as time moved on, you see how full of shit they are. Then the fuckin Big Machine manipulates the media like fuckin chess pawns. All of this from a movie. Peace, Love, Porkchops Fish

 I WROTE A WHOLE POST AND LOST IT!!!!!!!! I will write later! Fish

 Dear Fish: I know the counselor said we shouldn't contact each other during our "cooling off" period, but I couldn't wait anymore. The day you left, I swore I'd never talk to you again. But that was just the wounded little girl in me talking. Still, I never wanted to be the first one to make contact. In my fantasies, it was always you who would come crawling back to me. I guess my pride needed that. But now I see that my pride's cost me a lot of things. I'm tired of pretending I don't miss you. I don't care about looking bad anymore. I don't care who makes the first move as long as one of us does. Maybe it's time we let our hearts speak as loudly as our hurt. And this is what my heart says... "There's no one like you, fish." I look for you in the eyes and crotches of every man I see, but they're not you. They're not even close. Two weeks ago, I met this guy at midtown Bar and brought him home with me. I don't say this to hurt you, but just to illustrate the depth of my desperation. He was young, maybe 22, with one of those perfect bodies that only youth and maybe a childhood spent weightlifting can give you. I mean, just a perfect body. A perfect ass you wouldn't believe. Every woman's dream, right? But as I sat on the couch blowing this hunk, I thought, look at the stuff we've made important in our lives. It's all so superficial. What does a perfect body mean? Does it make him better in bed? Well, in this case, yes. But you see what I'm getting at. Does it make him a better person? Does he have a better heart than my moderately attractive fish? I doubt it. And I'd never really thought of that before. I Don't know, maybe I'm just growing up a little. Later, after he tossed me about a half a pint of throat yogurt, I found myself thinking, "Why do I feel so drained and empty?" It wasn't just his flawless technique or his slutty, shameless hunger, but something else. Some feeling of loss. Why did it feel so incomplete? And then it hit me. It didn't feel the same because you weren't there, Fish, to watch. Do you know what I mean? Nothing feels the same without you. Jesus, Fish, I'm just going crazy without you. And everything I do just reminds me of you. Do you remember Freddy, that single dude we met at the Nuyorican? Well, he dropped by last week with a pan of lasagna. He said he figured I wasn't eating right without a man around. I didn't know what he meant till later, but that's not the real story. Anyway, we had a few glasses of wine and the next thing you know we're banging away in my bedroom. And this guy's a total monster in the sack. He's giving me everything, you know like a real man does when he's not hung up about his career and whether the kids can hear us. And all of a sudden he spots that tilting mirror on your grandmother's old vanity. So he puts it on the floor and we straddle it, right, so we can watch ourselves. And it's totally hot, but it makes me sad too. 'Cause I can't help thinking, "Why didn't fish ever put the mirror on the floor? We've had this old vanity for what, 8 Months, and we never used it as a sex aid." Saturday, your friend John drops by with my copy of the restraining order. I mean, John is just a kid and all, but he's got a pretty good head on his shoulders and he's been a real friend to me during this painful time. He's given me lots of good counsel about you and about men in general. Hes pulling for us to get back together, Fish, he really is. So we're drinking in a hot bath and talking about happier times. Here's this hot dude with the same looks as you and all I can do is think of how much he looked like you when you were 18. And that just about makes me cry. And then it turns out John's really into the whole anal thing and that gets me to thinking about how many times I pressured you about trying it and how that probably fuelled some of the bitterness between us. It's only a dildo Fish, alot of guys do it. But do you see how even then, when John is thrusting inside my cinnamon ring, all I can do is think of you? It's true, Fish. In your heart you know it. Don't you think we could start over? Just wipe out all the grievances and start fresh? I think we can. If you feel the same please, please, please let me know, otherwise, can you let me know where my earrings are ? Your ex Disclaimer: This shit was just a joke

 ...... CHULETAS BABY!!!!!!! Ahhhhh..... that is the best thing in life; porkchops! Yesterday was a good fuckin day! Eric came to pick me up and we headed to meet up with OMX. After enlisting the services of Eric's SUV to drop off some stuff at the condo, we headed to eat. Yesterday was a really good day. I haven't hung out with Eric and Oscar alone in a long time. All three of us have gone through some shit in the past couple of months. It felt good to hang with them and just laugh and act a fool. It has been a very very long time and I felt a serious support system yesterday. Oscar there for Eric Fish there for Eric Oscar there for Fish Eric there for Fish All three of us about to hug each other and GET NAKED BABY!!!! Heehee. Oscar is not my type; he'll fight back. I got home and I have been diddling with this poem about the male lineage in my family. It is touchy - probably the deepest I have gotten into me wanting to end my male bloodline. Alcoholism, womanizing, domestic abuse, even justified death is swirling in the dome. I should have a good draft by the next Acentos. Gotta bring the new shit. Short blog Peace, Love, Porkchops Fish

 .......I mean, you always talk about how you'd do anything for certain friends - even help hide the bodies - but I mean, how much respect do you have for someone who could possibly do that to someone and how much respect do you have for the cops that may put someone away? So maybe it should be about respect. Yeah, that's it! By the way, I hope I'm not making any assumptions here, I dont really know much about your life except for what I read on the blogs, but it SEEMS you've changed a little over the years, no? ************************ There are two great topics to blog about today. I could go the respect route or the " how much has Fish changed route". I will try to integrate the two as best as possible. Have I changed over the years?? Yes. As to how much; you will never understand how much. Everyone in life changes from one unique way to the other. In which direction the change takes them-it's on them. I did the typical ghetto shit and suffered the consequences. I will never blame anyone but myself. I fucked up and did stupid shit and I am paying for them. I made seriously bad choices - Never finished college - Engaged in more violence then the average Iraqi citizen - Justified my actions under the " Friendship" umbrella. - Broken more hearts then I really needed too - Lost the respect of my parents - Managed to get a record; therefore shitting on my chances of ever running for office. - Hated more then loved The one thing I have always hated is when a black person starts talking shit about being opressed and slavery and all that shit that happened 400 years ago. I barely like thinking about my past which was about 5 years ago. Thing is, I learned from that past. The worst moment of my life was walking out of Jail to a waiting mother and father; the look on my fathers face broke my heart. He raised a failure. Now, if you know me, you know I have 7 fingers. You would think the worst moment of my life was when I lost them and spent 33 days in the hospital. Kinda strange if you ask me. I never had a chance to think about much after facing 60 years to life for four attempts. You ever been in a situation where your life could be taken from you??? Not killed in a nice way; locked up? That shit puts your life in perspective. SO after about 10 years of carrying a gun everyday and finaly getting caught; no more of that shit for me. I took the gun collection; threw them in a safe; stashed the safe behind some drywall and plaster; haven't looked back since. It's been since April 6, 1998 since I last touched my guns. I questioned this mentality of being a ghetto thug and keeping that respect in the streets. Was it respect or fear?? I don't know and honestly don't care. Slowly and methodically... I made my exit from around the way. I didn't hang that much; I stayed away from clubs; I stopped bouncing; I went with Oscar to read at an open mic for he won't have to do it alone. Story plays itself to the present. I give respect as I want it returned to me; unconditionally. I have some people in my life that I respect and walk with them to the ends of the earth. There are some people that have loss my respect and I never gave them a second chance - fuck them. Some people have earned a right to a reconcilliation of sorts. Respect is a dangerous street with me too. If I trust you and put you in a position that you have earned that trust and you fuck it up; I am making your life a shit fest. I have no qualms smacking you in front of everybody if you fucked up on me. That is ghetto but I am working on that. What I am high on is my business. If you know something about me and you choose to blab it to anyone after common sense tells you not too; you are threading thin water with me. If it comes back to me and I know for a fact that only one person knows that certain thing; refer to previous comment about the smack. There is a code in the ghetto. You do your job and we do ours. Even though yours is to catch us; we will work as hard as possible not to get caught. 99% of the time a person gets caught is because of greed, poor judgment, stupidity. If you do get caught, pues, they are doing their job son. Call Fred [ neighborhood Lawyer} and hope he can get you off. The best cop to the worst thug will tell you........ " Respect from both sides is what makes this game workable " Did I answer the question?? I have no clue. I do have to make believe I am going to work Peace

 Today was a good day at Acentos. We are going to change the name to " Acentos - Una Relacion de Nu Shit ". I didn't keep a solid track but the new shit on the mic was heavy tonight. I haven't been feeling poetry for a couple of days and Acentos was all that I needed. Today was the day that I knew what "keeping it real " meant. Just have some fun and enjoy everything under the umbrella of poetry. I finished that Bodega Dreams; ugh. I really fucked up readng the Red Tent and then starting Bodega Dreams. The caliber of writing was ions apart. The dreams of Willie Bodega were as real as my incredibly sexy body. Get the point?? I wouldn't suggest that book unless you really really have to read it. Fiction or not, it wasn't on the money. Well...... much need rest calls Fish

 These are kinda in the middle of a regular blog entry and the shortened Fish Flake style. Good weekend....... - Hung out with the masses this weekend. I did the family thing on Saturday and chilled with the Parental units most of the day and evening. We all truly overdosed on seafood. My mother has to be the funniest old lady in this world. When I start joking with her about her belly and how it's getting bigger -she says " eso es la leche de tu papa ". Loosely translated: " That is your fathers sperm getting me swollen ". My mother is 68 years old; do you think I need to picture my parents fucking? - Headed to the old block and chilled with Andy and a few of the new young stragglers who looked at me as if I had 5 heads. Andy is the brother who was immortalized in my poem; Perdido. This cat is young and he is a little too experienced for his years. Street life makes you grow up quick. We were discussing how the young girls around the way have all been getting knocked up. He says the little girls are growing too quick for their own good. Here is the kicker: Fish: 33 years old ~~ Little kids are between 18 and 22 ~~~ Andy: 22 years old ~~ Little kids are between 14 and 20 ~~~ When I first moved to Elder; some girls were just born; Jayme, Dorayma, Ally. ( 1985 etc etc ) There were already girls there who were considered the little girls; Kamalish, Glenda, Maria, Jessica ( 1980's etc etc ) Then the girls around my age; Yadira, Millie, Milagros, Cindy ( 1972 's etc etc ) When I am on the block and I am seeing the girls I saw in carriages pushing around their own carriages; That shit makes me feel old. Even better is when I see Jayme at 19 with her daughter who is 5 years old. That made me see that vicious fuckin cylcle first hand. How can this chic instill morals and values in her daughter??? She barely has any of her own. I always wondered about me and kids. It has come to a point where I refuse to have them and I can't see myself with them. The last girl I was with thought I had issues when I said " I don't want kids ". A great piece of me feels love is needed to create life; refer to previous posts. - Eric came to pick me up to do a little more male bonding. My nigga is going through some shit and it's affecting me pretty badly. I just have to be there for him and try to think as clearly as possible. It was cool to actually drive around yesterday. We drove around Washington heights and oggled at the half naked domincan women. It's a world of a difference over that little bridge. - Coming home I stopped by Jorge Merced place in his celebration of Oshun*. I haven't been in that setting for a long time and it felt good to see so many different faces. I was asked the question: Y usted tiene su santecho?" I replied kindly , " no, toda via no lo tengo ". I was offered a blessing and told " Tu corazon esta claro pero negro para un tiempo muy largo ". Translation; Your heart is clear but it was black for too long. After some blessing from the padrino; more seafood for me. I stood there for the ceremonial offerings to the various saints. It was cool to see the horses tail bless the house and the shrine. Santeria isn't the widest understood religion; it is cool though. - Got home and jumped in the recliner and put my face in my hands. I looked up and spoke to God, Allah, Budda, La Orishas, Krishna, Tao, and said thank you. Regardless of everything going slightly batty, I am good. My life is good. *Oshun - rules over the water of the world -- rivers, streams, and brooks. She embodies love, beauty, and fertility. She represents the blood flowing through and creating human life. She is also associated with culture and the fine arts. She is the youngest of the Orishas and the messenger to the house of Olorun. Her saint is Our Lady of Charity, Cuba's Patron Saint. Her colors are yellow and gold and her number is 5 _

 Eternity: The moment between you cumming and her leaving Friend: A person that bails you out of jail Real Friend: a person that helps you dig the hole to get rid of....whatever you need to get rid of. LOL Love: Tolerance of bullshit Sex: You home alone at night with K.Y, a sock, and porn Poetry: stealing other people's words to read it in front of a crowd to get laid { it hasn't worked for me yet } Blow-job: Employed for about 1 day and getting fired aNAL-sex: Anal sex Peace

 JUST GOT HOME FROM PROBABLY THE LONGEST DAY OF 2004. Why do I involve myself in things where my body can't keep up is never suprising. By the grace of your deity; it gets done. I wasn't at work today and I didn't get my usual blog fix for the day. I woke up at 4am today and I got to make a quick entry to satisfy those stalkers. I was thinking about em and I decided to make a quick stop by their tiny slice of cyber space; urlLink Big Dy touched on the surreal today. It takes a certain type of man to look another in the face and pull the trigger. One who has no care for life nor consequences; who doesn't think twice about throwing a wrench into the lives of everyone connected to that one life just ended. That dude is a bitch compared to one who has no fear of getting hurt from falling in love. I have been in relationships where I thought I was in love to relationships where I am thinking; " What the fuck, you came three times, GO HOME!". I can't be the voice of authority when love is involved, I can only give my perspective on it. Thing is, I barely know what it is. I am not going to detail about my lovefests gone awry. I can't explain how many women have fallen in love with me and I have pushed them away farther and faster then the black plague. Why?? I haven't gotten hurt in my life with love. I have gotten surely fucked, stomped, kicked, and dare I say; jaded. When I thought I was in love and I dedicated 5 loyal years; it boils down to: " Fish, I just need time to live my life " Translation: I am currently fucking another guy at my job and the different dick after getting just yours for 5 years seems great. Conclusion: I found out about the next man 16 hours after we broke up. I cried for about 20 minutes then waited to go to her job the next day. " Luis " wasn't there but she was. After " loving " her with every fiber of my being; I didn't make a scene and I walked out after telling her " I gave you my life and you threw it away ". I walk out of her job and see " Luis " brother waiting for his girlfriend that worked at the same place. I walk up to him and told him to give a message to his brother. I grabbed my knife and shoved it in his nose and pulled it out. Was it wrong? yes. Did I care? No. I called the one person that I knew cared for me as a shoulder to lean on. The next day, we were an item. Did I fall in love??? Itwas the epitomal definiton of rebound. I loved as I was loved. Tic for a tac per se. $10,000 dollars later, a move to Queens, 4 years of replacement sex, hugs, and affection; I get......... Lisa: We have to talk Fish: About? Lisa: Come to the bedroom and sit down Fish: Question Lisa: What? Fish: Are you going to give me a break-up speech? Lisa: Why? Fish: If you are; don't bother Lisa: What? Why? Fish: I just gave you mine Lisa: What do you mean? Fish: Well, you want to call it quits right? Lisa: Yea Fish: Well, I do too Lisa: I am staying in the apartment, I am not leaving Fish: That's ok, I already have an apartment, I am leaving Next Friday Conclusion: After some serious shit popping off. I did some more of my detective work. Turns out she was fuckin a guy named " Larry ". I wanted out of this relationship so bad; I didn't care. So larry got away with his nose intact. I moved back to the Bronx and I promised myself that I was staying alone for one year. From the age of 16 to 27, I was never single. It was time to find myself spiritually, emotionally, and all those other tidbits of self-finding-power-modes that make us get by. After Lisa there were three relatonships that have stuck to me. All three have fallen in love with me and I haven't been able to return that love. I could possibly go to the end of the world for them but loving them unconditionally has been difficult. Giving myself 100% and moving forward has scared me to the point where I freeze, stop, shut down. I know love will stop eluding me eventually. Better yet, I will stop eluding love one day. There has been times where I have known for a fact that my fears have cost me very special partners. Relationships where I know happiness was definitely thrown in for both our future benefits. IF I know I would be happy in the future, why not go for it?? Well, Would it be fair to stay with someone who provides happiness but you can't love them ? Better yet, refuse yoursef to love them? It's just not fair in my eyes. How do I love? That seems to be the question of the hour. Just to jump in head first seems best to describe it. Just no care for hurt, worries, pain, regrets. Stand by the lakeside of love and know the water is freezing. Take off all your clothes; admire the penis that will definitly shrivel to a raisin when that water hits it; take a deep breathe; close your eyes; JUMP IN!! I can't et past that breathing pase it seems. I know when I do, it will be incredible. I will want to live every waking moment thinking of the love I have at home. The long nights of laughing at everything. making love in the weirdest places. Never having an awkward moment. Living passion bridled with adventure. The notes more important then gold. The dinner more important then intamacy. Sharing health problems and comparing liver spots. Loving love until I have to bury you, until I can't live without you. Not being able to fucntion as a lone unit. Love is hard My life is good but when love hits me Life is better Peace P.s Big Dy, thanks

 I don't have a clue how I used to wake up at 4am to get to my job by 5am. Better yet, I don't know how I used to bounce at a club until 4am and go straight to work! I am getting old. Fish Flakes - Played pool; I suck - Louder then words tonight; if you miss it- consider yourself an asshole - Say good bye to Eric - Oscar won the Brio - Rich will be home by Tuesday - Tom is huge - Strippers no longer turn me on - I think Great Adventures is this weekend ; niggas better call - I am not going to work today Peace

 ....was good to me. My batteries which lost life were energized yesterday. Got to the Nuyo early as I braved the trains and headed downtown sans the hooptie. I figured why bother going home to pick up the car to drive back down. Yesterday was the day that I gained more respect for Fred. He has always been touch and go with me with some of the things I've seen him do. His poetry, bookings, events, personal style ....etc.... etc... etc. I do have to say he was a gracious host and he made me feel very comfortable. It was shameful the nuyo was empty compared to other crowd standards. Some of the Acentos borg came down to support and that was nice. The cinnamom Gorilla, our personal Pablo Escobar and the squishy butt have become some serious staples almost everywhere I pop my head up. It's not bad since seeing their faces makes the little security blanket just a little softer. The sets were great and I had soooo much fun. I forgot how to have fun. Yea, I admit it, I got lost in the competition of things and stop practicing my preachings. " Just go up there and have a good time ". I haven't followed that; it has bitten me on my ass. Yesterday featuring with Bone and Oscar gave me a new memory to look back on. I think we are all fools but we take what we do to heart. The hat wearing sorta rican rocked this new piece that made me go " wow ". The battlefield re-visited has definitely showed how far Oscar has come. Shit who the fuck am I to judge or give kudos but that kat is doing it. Bonafide rocked with some new pieces of his book. I agree with someone who said his poetry is far better when he features and not in the slam setting. I came out with most old pieces and hit two new pieces. Even my newly memorized " perdido " seems kinda old since I debut it in November. The newest piece was my 1 minute piece that I am really loving. It is quicky becoming a solid mantra of mine. The crowd was sparse but I loved it. Got some wonderful hugs from the crowd and we plugged Acentos within an inch of life. I wanted to Plug louderMONDAY but it didn't fit last night. I don't mind, we did a job, we did it well. As for Bone and Oscar; I love ya niggas. Yesterday was the first time that I felt professional with you two fucks. We joked, We laughed, we gigged, the show was awesome. For me personally, thank you for giving me reason to continue. Quick and much love for Lenny coming down and letting me bother her most of the night. When my nerves are getting the better of me, I bother her and I feel better. Thanks Let me bounce and get upset about Puerto Ricans being under the poverty level amongst all latino's in the United states. We came to the United States and started poor; we are still fucking poor. Oh, where is the outrage with 40 iraqi's getting smoked by those Helicopter gunships? Was it an "insurgent" safehouse or a wedding?? Peace

 Tonight I read at the nuyo; there is my plug I am ok today. I had a good start this morning with a good smile. I didn't have my usual " I want to kill everyone on the train " moment. You ever thought of the raminfications of taking the D train early in the morning and having some sick fuck walk on with several guns??? The massacre would rival that one of Valentines day 1993 on Prospect. The D train has a stretch of about 10 mins from 145 th to 59th street. I think if you go to the end of the train car; shoot the first men you see. Everyone will automatically run to the end of opposite side of the train. Then you just pick them off from a distance of 10 feet. No, I am not using a bullshit 22 cal automatic. I am talking about HK-91 fully automatic 308 cal assault rifle. That shit would leave holes in ya! Dare to dream I'm not sick, I just get bored. Get up shit shave shower dress go to work work sleep eat lucnh come home Thank God I am a poet. At least I get to read and write poetry. Peace

 THat is how I describe my life sometimes. Everything is much roomier being alone. I never been the type of person delving my business in public forums; I won't start now. Everything is cool. I didn't go to Bar 13 yesterday as my buttons were pushed royally last night. I decided it was best to go home and just enjoy an evening of TV. I wanted to finish Bodega dreams but the book is bordering on disgusting now. Disgusting that I am going to write a poem dedicated to this motherfucker that did a disservice by writing this book. I am debating on reading DaVinci code, Down these mean streets, or When I was Puerto Rican. I have noticed that reading books has been keeping me pretty calm these days. I started reading to get a feel of what was going on in the minds of these poet fucks. Now, I am doing it after I have found an enjoyment out of it. I am featuring with Oscar and Bone for Machismo re-defined at the Nuyo tomorrow. It should be fun. Back in the fray

 ......bare with me. Dear Tolerance; you and I have known each other for a long time. We have embraced each other in times where I never knew it was possible. One thing I have noticed was the fact you always drag that other dude around; patience. I know some where in my life I gave patience a good chance and I always got along with him. I never had a problem with you but today; I do. Tolerance, bare with me as I think you and I need to part ways. As you and I have had a troubled and rocky relationship; time to walk. Just let me be for a while Fish

 ....does the throbbing pulse from the vein in my neck expand further with the whisper of your hurt a soft uncertainity between want and needs gazing upon moonlit rooftops clouds baring down; blocking suns razorblade memories acid breathe your name rides heavy on my halted thoughts burn the rooftops to avoid memories slash soft skin to reveal scars of what was clear the fields with sickle swipes tell me" Do you know what is pain ?" air burdened with heavyset monotone pleasantries slicing pressure with undo kindness Thunder overcomes my screams I kneel to the Gods under charring skies Clouds blackened with failed kisses; Lined with good-bye gazes Nights filled with uneasy calms that are far too long Pour the blood at my feet melt the faces of wanton bravery break the calm of river waters cold colors of the sun bending time let me bathe in what I will be alone

 What's the deal I just picked up a new phone. I have to add on all these numbers. So, if you are in my life ( reading this blog ; call me 917-209-4211 unblock your number for I can add you to the Celly! Peace

 - Van Helsing is eye candy; it's worse the second time around. - I bumped into a friend of mine that I have not seen since I graduated high School ( 1989 ). I looked to my right and I said " Doris " and this girl looked at me like I had 13 heads. I took off my shades and she jumped on me like I was her long lost brother. 15 some odd years have passed and our friendship was tight as the day we left. Her boyfriend wasn't an asshole at least. We spoke and exchanged numbers and hopefully we all can chill. - I was hanging with Eric yesterday and had a very bad hair day. We joked all day on the side of my hair looking PUFFED! - WWE JUdgment day was serious last night. I turned it on in the last match. Bradshaw and Eddie Guerrero and it had to be the bloodiest match I have seen in Wrestling. Stone cold was bloodied one time so bad he was streaming blood; Guerrero matched him. - Bodega dreams sucks - I am buying a new cell phone today - I am taking a workshop tomorrow - I am performing for Machismo re-defined on Wednesday - I'm a poet - Elder hasn't changed - My Lobster and biggest Oscar fought all weekend. The lobster is getting the better of the Oscar - My turtle ( pablo ) is getting bigger. He eats more then a normal turtle. He like pernil; he must have some Puerto Rican in him.

 A couple of months ago, I wrote an entry about some model types I saw on 5th ave at a flagship grand opening of "MEXX". I wrote " out of 100, I would have fucked 99". This is the mentality I have while watching Troy yesterday. I figured the movie should pander both my eyes and my intellect in cinama antics and dialogue diatribe. I was rather hesitant seeing this flick after Gladiator, Scorpion King, Braveheart and even Ben Hur. I was even more stand offish after seeing Brad pitt in the starring role. Let me get to the movie....... The movie was above average and I wasn't pissed after I left. The constant tug of war between Agamemmnon and Achilles( Brad Pitt) was great in giving the movie that push of reality or believability. Even though a king in those days would have chopped Achilles head off; it was good to see the best warrior of the Greek era not bowing to a king like most movies. The constant pursuit by one king to rule the world and love thrown in the mix made the movie so-so. Some of the fight scenes held their own but we've seen thousands fight already. My main problem with this flick was Brad pitt being too fuckin pretty. He was fabio with a fuckin sword. He was the super model of the Grecian wars. His skills in the movie were crazy and he killed many of men. Yet, he is sooooooo pretty I can't see him killing so many people. If that push between the king and pitt wasn't there; the movie would have sucked. Pitt's character was great in that rebellious sense. He went against the grain but we have seen that before. If Bradd pitt had a clue; use the fight club character in troy and the movie would have been golden. One scene in the movie had Pitt fighting an army and not one ounce of " true" dirt on his face. " Chip a tooth, chop that long flowing mane off, get some dirt on your face" The movie was ok and worth your 10 bucks. Of course, I didn't pay for it so I can't complain that much. Peace

 I don't have the slightest clue when it comes down to these shows on CNN,CSNBC,MSNBC,FOXNEWS, etc.....etc. I stood home yesterday( far cry from my usual Friday jauntings) I needed some rest regardless. I think it was more of time away from the Poetry. After some cleaning and hanging of a new movie poster; the boob tube and I bonded. I came across some Bill O'Reily and his show. The topic was rap music and the effect it has on younger folk. On the show was damon dash; founder and CEO of Roc-a-fella records, Cam'ron; a rapper, some principal from an urban school in America. I was amazed at how that KKK loving O'reily was skewing the conversation and twisting words around. Damon Dash held his own and made some very good points. Cam'ron's and asshole. O'reily: Do you think your music has an effect on children? Since your music does not promote a positive reflection on life, how can it be positive for children? You rap about everyday things from your urban upbringing; how is that positive? Those are the one's I remember but if you don't see those are loaded questions ready- you's a fool. Does rap effect children??? Of course it does. I levy rap to the poetry I teach to the inmates at Rikers. They will only listen/read to what they can relate too. Not everyone is like Bonafide, Oscar, or even like me. People who grew up in the ghetto but had enough thirst to seek out other music besides Rap. Rap was thrusted down our throats at some points and living in the ghetto; that was typical. Back in the day Hot 103.5 ( now hot 97.1) played Freestyle and house the majority of the time. Some rap found it's way to the radio but it was a happy time of pre-pop and fast love songs. When the move happened and Rap found a home; shit flew. Gangsta rap in the early 90's was pretty heavy. I never viewed it as Gangsta rap, it was more reality rap. If people are getting shot up and a rapper writes about it; this makes him an urban reporter. Liz Cho reads the news and no one gets on her for delivering the heartache's of the ghetto. Biggie raps about the ghetto and he is a gangsta. Rap is as diverse as anything in life. When rapping about the ghetto; you have everything from good to bad. This is when you have to educate yourself and figure out which rap music would be suitable for your child. Most of the rap these days is not that bad. I am not to heavy on the " bitches, ho's, pimp's, and bling". Then again, it's better then having some dude come out and say "he'll bust you in the head/ until your dead/ cause you have no street cred" Would I stop my kids from listening to rap?? Nahhh..... I will let them know life isn't all about what they rap about. Rap is just like the newspapers; they only feed you what they " think " you want to hear. For every subject someone raps about; there are about 50 you haven't heard. Favorite rappers 1 Nas 2 KRS-One 3 Public enemy 4 Tupac 5 Biggie 6 Big-pun 7 Fat joe 8 Chad-eo 9 Remy Martin 10 DMX Least Favorite Rappers 1 P-diddy, puffy, sean combs, 2 Mase 3 Anything southern 4 Anything from "2 live cru " 5 Fabolous 6 Memphis Bleek 7 Bow-wow, little Romeo 8 Master P Peace 7

 .......currently in the land of " Blah, blah, blah ". One of my biggest arguments about the beheading of Nick Berg was the physical description of his executioners. They were all tall and they didn't look Arabic to me. After some jostling back and forth last night and Roger making a point. I searched for a better copy of the video. I got it and I was pretty amazed how wrong my perception was. When I thought they all had gloves in one grainy tape; the clearer one shows much more detail. To be honest, it's all water under the bridge for me at this point. War is not pretty, killing is not pretty. I still am sticking to my guns and saying there is much more then " just a beheading ". Last night was a good night for me. I headed to celebrate Ed Garcia's birthday at a small bar called " Company". It sounds more like an underground elitist agency with a strong concentration on spying. I normally like to stay home and not come home to fight for parking. Ed garcia is one of those people that I will definitely go and support his projects, brithday's, celebrations. He has been there much more then he has to for us and it is just right to see some love thrown his way. I got there pretty early as those late entrances were never my thing. I sat and spoke to Omar and Ed about High School, life, work, and a variety of stupid shit. Several of the regular borg dwellers showed up and we had a great night. The highlight of my night was when I was saying I went into a peeping booth years ago and I slipped and busted my ass. Put the story together. Peeping booth Porn video privacy tile floor I slip and bust my ass. If you don't know what I fell on; you need to delve deeper into the porn industry. Omar comes out and says he had a friend who used to Janitor those booth and he used to mop the ceiling! I almost died laughing. It was a good evening and I enjoyed myself. I took my typical walk to canvass the area to find something interesting besides the joint we were patronizing. Behold around the corner; it was the famous bar called " Coyote Ugly". Complete with Bartender's dancing on the Bar top. Bras and Panties on the moosehead in the corner; and the evil smirking bald bouncer with an inkling to throw someone out on their ass. One small detail folks, the bartender dancing on the bar was about attractive as Roseanne in a Thong. It was sooooo not pretty. I came home last night and I unfolded the Van helsing poster I have for my apartment. The thing is 10 feet by 40 feet long. I am going to paper the whole wall with the poster. I think it is going to look awesome. I am good today. I started reading Bodega Dreams by Ernesto Rodriguez. I am already 50 pages in. The book is good but I am not believing much of what he is writing. As entertaining as it is; the all knowing drug kingpin of a neighborhood isn't as believable as it once was. Willie Bodega seems more myth then legend to me. We see as I finish the book today. Yes, I will fly through this book because it is an easy read for me. Everything he wrote I have lived. Peace, Love, Porkchops Fish

 .........I have soooo much to write about. It's just a matter of " WHAT " I will write. I could start off with the fish flakes but that will take up toooo much of my two page limit entry. I finished reading this book; The Red Tent by Anita Diamant, yesterday. The book is the brainchild of the Raise Red Tent format for the LouderMONDAYS series at Bar 13. I was always interested in getting into the brains of the women of louder and picking it dry. I figured I would start by reading this book. I won't give ya the impression I have read hundreds of books. The red tent is probably book number 30 or 40 in 33 years of my life. I should be somewhere in the thousands from a personal standpoint. The book is written very nicely. The author flowed vividly and transitioned between stories right when you knew it was about to happen. With the content being Biblically historical fiction; it was something completely new for me. The book was a far cry from starting a feminist movement but it did show the beautiful life of a midwife who sought happiness even in the worst times of despair. The positive impact the strong bonds formed between the women in the first tribe of canaanites were completely striking to me. Those bonds followed the main character through most of her life. As she dared to dream happiness and fulfillment; she received it when you least expect it. When anyone asks me about the Red Tent; I will say the book stands for love, community, bonds through womenhood, and happiness through the love of life with family; most of all, the book shows sacrifice. I joked with Maria; the owner of the book; how Jacob was a pimp with 4 wives but that was just a small part of this book. I would suggest this book. Shit, If I liked it and it makes me understand "Raise the Red tent " a little bit better; I am happy. ******************* American Idol sucks ass. I am probably the only one in NYC that dares say " That show fucking sucks". Middle America who has no clue what talent is votes off the best singers. I am comparing America to slam. Vote for the best singer with the most talent; stop that sympathy voting shit. I will definitely butt fuck Simon Cowell if I catch him in a dark alley. Randy Jackson is a droppy skinned bitch. Paula....... I don't have enough time to write about her. ******************* I have to read " Bodega Dreams " next. Can I borrow this book please. Whenever you have a chance ******************** Hatemail to the people that posted video of Nick Berg ( dude that got the dome chopped off ) Sent: Wednesday, May 12, 2004 4:44 PM To: Marc Subject: American decapitation video I can't believe you liberal pieces of shit would condone something like this. If any of you fuckin scumbags have a problem with this country and what we are doing, get the fuck out. I could barely watch what they showed on the news and i dont even want to see the whole thing. You people are fuckin white trash scumbag losers with too much time on your hands. That sux that you people can't find better things to do than sit and watch a horrific thing like this and have the balls to say it's reality and what goes on over there. That's not what goes on. Our soldiers didnt do anything close to this and he wasnt even a soldier. The only thing our troops did wrong was get caught, but they still would not have done something like us. Now i know all you liberals would rather give money to trailer parkers on welfare with ten kids, but that isnt how things are gonna be right now so get the fuck over it and start showing a little pride for your country and those who help defend it. Im gonna do my best to get people away from this scum infested website and hopefully some day it'll be closed. And CKY, your a fuckin jerkoff, yeah lets show the videos of our troops beating them up right before the video of them chopping off the head of a civilian who volunteered to help the war effort. Good idea asshole. CONSERVATIVE! p.s. how do you think his parents would feel if they saw his son's terrible death all over the internet cause of scumbags like you. Or even better, how would your parents feel. Have some consideration dirt bag. Marc's Response: In short, fuck off. In longer version, the bottom line is that we're showing what other news organizations don't have the balls to show: the truth. > Wrong, it did happen. Whether you like it or not it did. You're saying just b/c the US soldiers aren't killing people that somehow makes the video not real? AND more importantly you ignorant fuck, this IS what's being done by US troops. You should actually try and do a little research before you bitch. Watch CNET. There have been 3 confirmed homicides in the jail in Iraq that those pictures came from. > "The only thing our troops did wrong was get caught, but they still would > Are you fucking kidding me? You're saying there was nothing wrong with US soldiers abusing the prisoners? > "Now i know all you liberals would rather give money to trailer parkers on > Rehashing and regurgitating the propaganda you've been taught. Try having some original thought. This has NOTHING to do with Liberal vs. Conservative. God, I hate your type of redneck. Anything or anyone that actually disagrees with the government is immediately labeled "Liberal" and ignored. This is about human rights. Murder is wrong. Abuse is wrong. No matter who is doing it! Just to be clear: what happened to that US civilian is horrible, fuck-up, and CANNOT be justified. I personally don't think we should be in Iraq. I think we're doing our country a grave disservice and slaughtering our credibility in the world's eyes. Does that mean for one second I condemn or in any way don't support our troops. FUCK NO. Our soldiers are doing what their country told them to do. Being a soldier doesn't give you the luxury of worrying about politics. You do what you're told. They're ALL heroes for dropping their lives, risking their lives, and doing what their government says needs to be done. BUT the soldiers that crossed the line and violated those Iraqis' human rights went too far. That is when soldiers do have to think for themselves. They should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. > As I said, I support the troops for doing their jobs. But tell me how Dubbya ordering the invasion of Iraq is defending the US. The rest of the world hates us more now than in the history of our country. Where are the weapons of mass destruction? NO WHERE. Weapons of Mass Distraction are more like it. > "gonna do my best to get people away from this scum infested website and > Fucking hypocrite. You obviously come to CJ all the time. We're an offensive website, what the fuck do you expect. Go on your little crusade. Anyone that would listen to you I won't miss. > "lets show the videos of our troops beating them up right before the video > Abso-fucking-lutely. I agree. If we get those videos we'll damn sure post them. We show what's out there. You figure out how to deal with it. > "how do you think his parents would feel if they saw his son's terrible > I've been asked that question by better than you. Just finished up an interview w/ a reporter from the NY Times and she asked the same question. Here's the answer: Just like everyone else, they have a choice whether or not to look at it. I promise, they're too busy dealing with their grief to come to our site. My opinion is that the pain they will have from seeing it is far outweighed by the value in showing the world what's really happening. What's going on over there, in my humble opinion, will be the biggest thing in all of our lives. We will be dealing with the ramifications of this conflict for the rest of our lives. The more people can be informed the better. We hear about murders all the time on the news. We're de-sensitized to it. BUT, when we see it in all it's gory details is grabs our attention and forces us to deal with it. The TRUTH is never a bad thing. Give me one good reason why something that is real should be censored. If you're rational and honest, you can't. In the words of Jack Nicholson "you can't handle the truth." *************************** Peace,Love, Porkchops Fish

 ........ a little bit somber today and it is bordering on fuckin mad. Yesterday the news came out about a white boy in Iraq that was kidnapped a couple of weeks ago. Not many people knew of his whereabouts until a video came out showing how he died. Now, believe it or not; I have some scrupples left and I will not direct you to which site you can see the video. I saw the video yesterday and I can say that it actually bothered me. Not the way he died; people suffer worse fates then a beheading. Just his family having to know their sons head was chopped off and now the video shoots across the internet like wildfire. It's really sad that technology can be used for these purposes. This Iraq shit hasn't phased me since it's republican inception. Now- I think I hit that mark where I will be more vocal about it. It's insane because it is reminding me of a ghetto turf war we were a part of back in the day. The Elder kats went over and took over Ward ave. Ward kats wanted us out and the shit hit the fan many time. Over and over again: fights, stabbings, beatdowns. They grab one of us, we grab one of them. They grab two of us we grab two of them. That is what is playing out in this bullshit war. They attack an outpost and kill a soldier or two. The soldiers kill an " Insurgent " or two. I think of what an Insurgent is; a person who acts contrary to policy or authority. Well, For some reason I am believing the definition of "insurgency" is being painted with broad strokes. Too many Iraqi citizens have died. Don't get me wrong- I am not too happy that they are killing U.S Soldiers. I could just see the pop-shots in the middle of the night and women, kids, getting killed. It's one thing the United States being there trying to establish control. Taking over and keeping your finger in there for years to come is another. If the Iraqi people want the U.S out; what the fuck; LEAVE! You caught Saddam and killed his kids. The whole deck of wanted loyalist to Saddam have been caught or killed. No WMD's have been found. Nothing but wasted tax-payer money and meaningless death every single fuckin day. It bugs me when a soldier is killed but when a civilian is kidnapped and his head is chopped off and broadcast around the world; that shit is not cool. The protest come and go but nothing stays long enough to make waves. If fly by night protesters beef for 3 hours but remain quieted the remainder of the time- shut the fuck up. The almighty full of shit media is not keeping the truth behind rating curtains. If morals and values had a candle; hold it to the coffins that come home at 2 in the morning under the cover of darkness. No cameras, no coverage, no reporters. These guerilla tactic filled paparazzi will follow J-lo to the ends of the earth but they don't have the balls to follow the sacrifices of true men and women. You thought I was going to say " Hero "? Fuck that, they are men and women that are doing there jobs. Hero's are the mother's , fathers, wives, brothers, sisters, who will be forever scarred by burying a loved one who joined the armed forces in hopes of a better education, life, career. Give me a gun, fill it with 21 shots, label each shot with the reasons why the United states needs to stop invading other countries. 21 shots is not enough?? Well, next to my feet is a box that will continually be filled with rounds until the day I die. I will keep shooting that gun in the air until I am heard. " Yo George, let it go. You already look like an asshole. Dick is a heart Attack waiting to happen. Donny screams KKK and you think America doesn't notice?? Do you want to hear the voice of the people??? Here goes: Bring em all home George. Chalk it up as an experience worth learning from. Your dad has his fingers so tight around your neck we can see the capillaries bursting with each word you try to enunciate; correctly or incorrectly. Let it go George, let it go " Fish P.S To the secret service Fuck you all too

 WHat's the deal folk!? All is good in casa Fish. I got mad support and love from all the one's that mattered in my life and it feels good to know people love you. Thanks. Well, Yesterday I was going on in my endless pursuit to finish surfing the internet. I came across Hot97 website and clicked around to see what caught my eye. Oh man oh man........ Smackfest 2004 is da shit! In the morning show, the host don't matter because they all suck, they had this small bit called smackfest. Contestants would call in to take part in this shit to get Summer Jam Tickets. The game is easy. You stand toe to toe one arm behind your back Wind up and smack the shit out of the guy in front of you. Whoever gives up loses and the other gets summer jam tickets. I clicked on the real media and I was crackin up in my office. The one I would suggest is the day two smackfest. This short little dude smack the bejesus out of this Brooklyn kat and it was awesome. urlLink www.hot97.com Nothing like seeing people smack the shit out of each other to get you out of a funk! Peace

 Stick with me until the end and I will answer this question. It is now 2am and I have gone through an array of emotions that I never knew crept inside of me. I was already nervous as fuck early this morning at 10am. I even called Rog to ask a couple of questions and bust a joke or two. The time clicked closer and my nerves were in check. Of course after throwing up about 4 times in a span of 2 hours doesnt make this competition thing pretty. The slammers were set and placed in their prospective order and off to the races we went. Rich drew the wonderful slot of first but he did something I never seen him do; he channeled God directly and fucking opened up to a 28.7. That is how you start a slam and I knew it was going to be interesting. Slammers 2 and 3 were a blur as was the rest of the night. I went up there with all my confidence and delivered a solid performance with not one mistake; practice paid off. Judges thought different as I was awarded a 25.1. After my set I pulled a marty and went straight to the hallway. I couldnt fucking breathe and my throat tightened up like if I swallowed a bees nest. I came back inside to hear the score and I knew my work was cut out for me. This is where the blur started and I needed to bring the next round hard. Round two came and I was the last poet to go since I had the lowest score. In order for me to get to the next round, I had to better Jai to at least pull out the big gun poems. Jai had a 25.3 in the previous round and he garnered a 26.6 in the second round. I needed a 26.8 to move ahead ( I think ) and my one minute poem was delivered to a great response from the crowd. Judges score: 26.7. I missed the 3rd round by .1 ! After I knew it was over, I heald back the initial shock of it all being over until they called my name and I bowed out gracefully to the crowd and went outside to unwind, relax, and cry. I missed all the poets in round three. I didnt want to deal with everyone asking me are you ok ?, You did well . I wasnt quite ready to deal with anyone and I refused to let anyone keep me company in my moment of misery. How did I feel ??? I dont know. I stood around out of sportmanship to see the team that is going to be sent to Nats. I went up there and hugged and gave my all. I waited to fill up inside but I came home empty. I left everything on the stage tonight and It will take me a little while to find it; about 2 days. I worked hard to come to this point and the last year has been a worldwind experience. My first year slamming and I make the finals by the grace of who knows who. My writing is growing and I can see bigger things in the future. Right now, its so on next year. The work is growing and that . 1 isnt shit in my eyes. Tonight, I got my respect from my peers and I got some serious love from the poets. The final tally??? Mike Cirelli, Roger, Mahogany all tied for first place. Abena and Rich grabbed 4th and 5th. Yes, my nigger Rich made the team. It was hard not to be there cheering like a mad man but inside of me, mi hermanito is going to Nats. Was it all worth it?? Yes it is. I learned alot from this finals and I will definitely use it towards the future. Being in the mix is stressful but rewarding t say the least. With tighter work delivered one inch from its life; its on. Acentos will rep hard at nats with Rich. The ladies will rep hard with Abena. Rog will be Rog. I feel good and I could say that I made the Bar 13 Slam Finals. I didnt make the team but its just been a solid year. One more year and its on. Thanks for the love Thank you Lenny for coming home with me and seeing me cry too much Congrats guys Peace Fish

 ...........of what's to come; life is going to suck. I am updating from the crib to avoid the shit talking from the bosses that I spend too much time behind my computer. Thing is, I don't have sit to write about. Well, from when I write this- 12 more hours until first blood is drawn in the slam tonight. If I am not ready by now, I don't deserve shit. I wanted to call people to chit chat last night but the only thing on the people's minds are " are you ready?, Aren't you nervous?". Shit, I wanted to hear something besides poetry yesterday. Oh, here is something good. I was talking to Mike on Saturday and the subject of favorite firearm came to the surface. I have always fancied the Glock 20; 40 cal. He comes out and says its a typical thug ghetto gun. I am quick to argue this point because I know for a fact Glocks are one of the best firearms out there. Getting to the point - Glocks no longer sell multi-capacity magazines. I was hurt when he told me this. When I had my glock, it was a 17 and one { 17 in the magazine and 1 in the chamber}. Here I am thinking " wow, that is a significant number of less shots ". Why the fuck would anyone need 17 shots in the streets you ask ? Well, when you are a loner and you engage a group bigger then 4 or 5 - the more shots the merrier. Off to work to leave early The mind has to be clear today Fish Peace, Love, Porkchops

 - Rich went to Rikers and his butthole is still intact. Smooth class and Rich was awesome. Keito showedup and he was great assisting Rich; The book of genesis according to St Miguelito. - Nuyo was the nuyo. Daniel Beatty won the slam. Desiree had the tightest writing. Carlos Gomez made providence along with Jive Poetic. Vanessa was looking hot. The open room was actually kinda packed - I dont think I will ever trust the sanctity of a relationship that will lead to more committed waters. I have my reasons - I have no clue why I bounced at a club for so many years. And yes; I do have balls to go to the club where I bounced and looked at all the motherfuckers that hated me with a smile. - I missed Salon Lucero; duties of a brother called - I divulged wayyyy tooo much info about some private things in my life to Eric - I lost a good friend the other day. We have decided to keep going our seperate ways. - Still practicing - Wish me luck tommorrow Fish -

 I love our little game of " Guessing the score of the poet before the poet finishes the poem". It makes the night very very interesting. Rog killed it with 6 wins but he didn't guess the team. Ed didn't get one win but he guessed the team in the order plus the alternate. So, I will give a tie to Rog and Ed in yesterday's pool. Well, last night was the Grand slam of all slams at the Bowery. Well, nothing suprising. The 2004 Urbana team is this......... Celena Glenn George Mckibbons RAC McKibbons Anis Alternate Taylor Mali Nothing surprising except for Anis making the team. I am happy as Fuck that George and RAC made this team together. This means on Monday....... They will not Slam. I think Celena Glenn will step down also. Coming up from the doldroms will be Morgan Janssen, Diane Roy, and Mo Brown. After Diane wrote some scathing non-sense in her blog- who knows where her head is and if she will actually come and slam at 13. I would find it genuinely hypocritcal and full of shit if she does come through with some bogus excuse. Thing is, I know that chic well enough and I know that she thrives on drama and getting under people's skin. I personally would like to see her come through and slam. Why?? It creates a much more competitive atmosphere and the ante will be brought up. If she chooses not to; I won't mind neither as Rich will have a chance to make the team then. It's a win win in my eyes. As the biased side of me wants to see Rich, Bonafide, Myself and the Dominican Roger make the team; I just have to just give it 100 % and accept the chips where they may. I was hanging and having great conversation with Beau yesterday and he has been so far out of the loop in slam. He was giving these hi scores and it was hilarious how far off he was. He said some key things at the spectacle slam has become. I counter that it has but the true writers are the one's getting up there and doing it. Sans the greybeard mentality; the Urbana team has some strong writers. They are not new voices but their shit is tight. Anis will definitly get better under the watchful eyes of Taylor. That is a plus for him and he better take advantage of it. Alot of people are already saying Roger has a definite slot on the team. Me personally, that shit is bogus. 9 poets are going into this and it will be equal footing. Shit, I think that Bonafide could take Rog out with a good round. Shit, I am getting cocky and don't sleep on the fat puerto rican man. It will be brought Monday!! Well, the weekend will be good as I have a couple of things going on. I am hangin out with a friend that we need to air out some shit after not speaking for months. I also need a good steak really really bad. Hasta pasta Rasta Fish

 I come to the blog with all intent purposes on last nights jaunt at the Blue Ox for the Bronx council of the Arts Culture trolley First Wednesday series featuring Taylor Mali. Of course; my eyes wander to other blogs and I get thrown out of wack. I hit the favorite menu drop down and I pick them at random. Guy hasn't updated much and my interest in his blog has weened dramatically. I click on it and see one of the best post he has ever written to anyone or anybody. Besides the love that I know he has for his wife; I never thought he could have such a genuine love and admiration for someone in the poetry scene. This dude has been jaded and dare I say even fed up with much of the bullshit on the scene. I could never blame the dude for lashing out and being his incendiary jackass self towards the scene. Scary thing is, that motherfucker speaks the truth and I agree with him about 75% of the time. What he wrote about Bassey is something well deserved. That girl is neurotic at best but she has a good heart and I never could take that away from her. After reading his blog I figure " let me head over to Bassey's blog". Turns out that she entered a pissed off entry because someone tried to......well........... enter her apartment forcefully. Can you blame her for wanting to move?? Do I feel that she would be going against the grain and leaving " her " people behind while she treks to the safe haven of the upper west side ? Uh...... " Bassey...... Bounce the fuck out. The same people around your " hood " are the first one's that will rob you " I am speaking from the perspective from a former hood rat. I told Roger one time the Bronx is full of sheisty ass folks that will rob your last dollar from your pocket and smile when it is happening. I even have a line in my Bronx poem " Watson Brings the lowest and yet the savviest" Where I grew up: we are straight shiesty. We never had a problem going into an apartment where the local domincan drug dealer had over 50 g's in drug proceeds and making " personal Withdrawls ". Girl..... The upper west side is calling you. Yesterday was a great day as Acentos took over the Blue OX on a Wednesday and made it our own. It was a sparse crowd and I was suprised no one; I really mean no one; got out of the trolley to hear Taylor Mali at his best. With Oscar being the special guest host; you thought I was joking about the take over?; everything was ripe for a practice run for Monday's finals. Taylor was already at the Blue Ox when I got there at 7pm sharp. He fit in quite well and didn't have that " I am lost in the Bronx " look on his face. We had some good conversation and I asked him........ " Why in the hell did you take that President position at PSI ?" Since personal conversations are just that, personal. We will keep the etiquette of the blog consistent. Oscar opened the evening and took full advantage of a new crowd searching for poetry. He dropped two good pieces and started the open mic. I headed ip after him and dropped my new 1 minute piece and my Perdido en la calle nene with the new body movements I have tried to interpret into the piece. Taylor liked it and asked if I was doing that on Monday. I am putting it all on the line in the first round and I hope it pays off. Rich read a new piece as he knows how. Tim rocked out with his pieces. The fast up and coming cinnamon gorilla Eliel rocked out with two pieces. I think he is finding his voice and now it's time to pursue his delivery. Up comes Mr Taylor Mali slightly buzzed after the signature Blue ox Shot. He lost his mind yesterday and it was the best that I have seen him. He should rock hard tonight in the slam and I will be rooting for my newly minted " Favorite older white boy poet ". Matt still holds title but the younger version. I had a great time at the Blue Ox but my patience was tested when I was playing pool with this knuckle head last night. He had a good run of the table and I had 6 balls to run to catch up to him trying to sink the 8 ball. I got into pool mood cuase this dude tried to hustle me and I ran the 6 balls but I had a little trouble with the 8 so I played defense and left the ball at one end of the table and he had no way in hell to shoot the eight. Then he looked at the eight ball for 5 minutes; aimed; got up; put his cue down and said he had to go take a piss. If you had to go piss, go piss and then come take your shot. He was wasting my time. He went to the bathroom and I grabbed the eight ball and forfeited the game . I hate playing at Bars with motherfuckers who think they are fats domino re-incarnated as Jennette Lee. Shoot your game and take your loss as a man. Even when I walked in this old man that my man whooped the other day asked if I could shoot some pool. He stated " I would love to learn a little on how to play the game ". I told him " You can't shoot and I have seen you play, don't try to hustle me like I am an asshole!. My man whooped you the other day and you cried that he wasn't calling his shots". Real men that know how to play this game do not have to call every single shot. That was my night I came home and I stopped off at White Castle's and my stomach is screaming for a forensics specialist because what is coming out of my ass is not right. Peace. love, Porkchops Fish

 Ladies and gentleGERMS; today in Washington Square park will be the world record attempt between couples kissing it out. So at 3pm, head over with your significant other and kiss at the alotted time and try to make it into the guiness book of world records. Last night was one of those nights. In an endless pursuit of finding an open mic to practice for Monday-Verbal Rayne in Mount Vernon was my stop. How can I say this nicely?? WHY THE FUCK ARE THEY PLUGGING IT AND NO ONE WAS THERE?!!! I hate this shit. I jump in the hooptie knowing parking will be a bitch when I come back and I head out there. I get there and the place is closed. Not a soul lingering out or about. So for the curators of Verbal rayne in Mount Vernon; You are all straight up full of shit! IF you can't keep it going, let the shit go! When I was coming home yesterday, I made my stop at the Pet store. I brought a small lobster to throw in my Fish tank. Well, it's not really a lobster. It is more like a diesel Crawfish. In the fish tank you have to have a certain fish that serves a purpose. Catfish eat algae off the glass Oscar are for show but eat smaller weaker fish that get sick- those sick fish won't get others sick Tinfoils are fast and run from Oscars Oscars get exercise chasing tinfoils Crawfish eat leftover food in the gravel ( rocks ) There is a method to the madness of an Aquarium hobbyist. I had some interesting dreams last night. I didn't get good sleep because I was thinking over some issues in my life. Firstly- I never felt so alone in the poetry world as I do now. I know that I have always prided myself on doing everything for me and me only. Now, I know for a fact that I am standing alone on my little island with no company. If my island turns into quicksand, I will die alone. Back to the dream; it was just weird. Dream sequence....... I was walking to a college gig of some sort with two black chics that were speaking nothing but french. It is weird for me because those are two of the most far fetched things to cross my mind. I don't think I have thought about something french in years. So here I am walking to this college and it is raining hardcore. Wait- did I mention that I was naked and wrapped in a blanket??? I hate walking around naked and here I am with two french talking black chics naked as a jaybird wrapped in an argyle blanket! Why?? I have no clue. Tonight is the true meaning of gentrification of the South Bronx! As Taylor Mali heads to the Blue Ox Bar to Feature for the Bronx Council on the Arts Culture trolley " First Wednesday " series! Taylor has never stepped foot in the Bronx ( to my understanding ) and he will be there tonight! I should get every ghetto thug that I know to descend on the blue ox. It is an open mic and I will be able to practice my new 1 min piece there tonight. I might ask leslie to rock out with two pieces and do Perdido with the new body motions I have been practicing. We see Peace, Love, Porkchops Fish

 why 5 rounds of poetry ? why a 1 minute round? I'm tired Rikers seems to be something from the past. Warden doesn't want to have classes taught after 5:30pm. I have a day job Groove Nation has to be called Chocolate City or better yet Negro Noise I was in a good mood last night Why do some people refuse to wear deoderant? Why do I shave my balls? It serves no purpose having hair there or not. It makes no sense. Better yet: Why do women shave? Those a la naturelle porno's from back in the day were the shit Eliel's a funny mothefucker Marty Has too much hair; She needs to shave it off The feature last night was totally old school and he rocked out I am giving up I can't do it any more Sleeping alone gets lonely I need a dog My turtle needs company Seikou looks like a cartoon Blogs are starting to bore me I am going to Albany Saturday Life is hard

 I would never do to someone what I don't want done to me. I always use this motto in friendships, relationships, associates etc. It gets difficult sometimes to deal with those awkward moments ending a relationship or a friendship but I firmly believe that everything is possible. I have no qualms maintaining a freindship after a relationship. I understand that it is difficult and it probably takes more work after the end then anything else. The one thing that is hard for me is to deal with is the after effects of a relationship when they move on. I have no problems with people moving on; just don't do it, flaunt, or do it in front of me. This is why when my realtionships end, I never start anything with the remote possiblity of previous said relationship coming in contact with the newness. I tend to say it's a " respect " issue. It is more of the asshole in me to be honest. Some people are better then me ten-fold when it comes to this. I am not. I can not see the person I was with bringing someone into my little world. A piece of me feels it is selfish but that is my issue that I have to deal with. If I am with someone for several years and we break up- respect me in having your next relationship a distance from me. Just like everything takes time to heal. I need my time for even that much. That is definitely a fault and I should start working on that. As it goes for now; I have no time for that . Fish

 Sometimes when you do something for the love and nothing else; the reward is bigger then anything you can possibly give me. Since Rich Villar was hosting the open room at the Nuyo; support of my hero pimp is of no question. After my exit of teaching my poetry class at Rikers I headed out there to enjoy the wonderful weather and some poetry. I drove by first and I see a very sick looking Julio at the door. I parked the hooptie and kept him company from 9pm or so. After some cordial conversation; he goes inside and I take the door for the next hour and change. Talk about feeling right at home at that chair. Lois came to me and we started talking about some things back and forth concerning the nuyo an some people on the scene. It amazes me how loose some tongues are in this world. I always come to my own conclusion concerning people and judgement is only for me to pass. Karen shows up and I am loving her more and more. You can tell a person is genuine is just the way they hug you; Karen has that. More cordial conversation and before I could blink- I am agreeing to slam. What better way to get practice for the Bar 13 finals then to rock out on the Nuyo Stage. Three rounds of memorized poems and I did quite well. I didnt win but yesterday was the day that I had the most fun on that stage. Win it or not; semis are over. Winning yesterday was a mute point from what I saw. One of the highest scoring slams I have seen at the Nuyo and I was in it. I had a fuckin ball last night. I was joking and just actin a fool. I think that seeped over when the crowd gave me nothing lower then a 9.3 the whole night. this Young kat from Jersey won and he did his thing. The nuyo is the nuyo It was a good night. Oh- I have a new motto!! Whatever happens at the Nuyo stays at the Nuyo!!! These two girls came outside and they were some over the top issue pushing women. I wont make mention as to what they did and what WE ALL ENGAGED in but is was a memorable evening. It was a good night. I came home wanted to have some company at a diner but all my calls went unanswered. A lone walk home Club bed was off the hook Peace

 Guess what??? I will not be around until Tuesday July 6th!!! Have a great weekend and be safe. I plan to engage in some serious stupidity so wish me a safe return. Peace, Love, Pork chops

 I wasn't going to do it but I might as well. Afer reading urlLink Rich's blog and seeing he jumped into the conversation we had on the ride home; I might as well get into it. We touched last night on the topic of religion. First and formost, I will not give you this sense that I am an expert on religion. I am far from it. In my life I could count the number of times I have voluntarily entered a church on my own. Excluding funerals; I could count it on my right hand. The proper way to properly decribe my crisis of faith is to explain most of the shit I have gone through. Of course we have no time for every detail of every fuck up that I CHOSE to partake in. Now here is the one thing that I have to stress. I have gone through more shit then the average joe. You know what; I wake up with regrets everyday. Those were my choices and I have to deal with them. If God is going to judge me on those choices according catholicism; I am destined for a warm and toasty eternity in hell. The one thing that I will never say is that I condone all the WRONG SHIT I have done. I am not going around and justifying the beatings that I gave out under an umbrella of self righteousness. I know everytime I beat somebody's ass; it's wrong. I still go ahead and do it knowing it's wrong and that makes it worse in my eyeballs. So that whole shit about doing something wrong but thinking you are right to justify your means is out the window in my eyes. So if you step to any of my boys, family, pompous poet friends with the intent to harm them; I am going to beat you until you are no longer a threat. Is it wrong??? yes. Will that stop me from doing it?? no. I always felt religion is nothing more then a comforting olive branch for the " unknowing". It is also a means of getting mankind to walk a straight line of creating a fear of the "unknown". I am 6'1 and 230 pounds and I am currently living in 150BC. I catch some little thief bastard killing and eating my chickens. I proceed to get my largest machete to carve his ass up into next weeks meal for my pigs. He tells me.... If you touch me; I have my God that will strike you down and curse your family. I will stop and think about it for a few seconds. Maybe he does have something almighty and powerful I don't quite fully comprehend it. The 150BC fish will probably take him off my land not to anger his God. The 2004 Fish will feed that motherfucker to the homeless. Religion; like law; was created, coerced, constructed for the purpose to level out the playing field amongst man. Without law nor religion, we would have plenty of dead people lying in the gutters. I lost my faith and I lost my love for the unknown. Soooo........ Here goes Dear God Stop Aids, Cancer, Human bombs in the middle east, and get Bush out of office within the next 5 mins; then I might get my faith back. Fish 5 mins past Nope..... everything is the same When I die; I will still blog and let everyone knows what is going on Peace

 When you have nothing to write about; Make faces :-)

 Many of you know that my life dealt with everything violent until I got locked up. Facing 60 years to life brings new perspective to your being. LOL Anyway, I was extremely knowledgable when it came down to one of my favorite pastimes; guns. Everything from field stripping to cleaning to shooting all types. Today my soul has been re-energized and quenched!! I headed with my boys Tom and Mike ( Collins brothers )to the wonderful state of Pa. We headed to Stoudsberg to a shooting range where Mike has a membership. Yes, This was a slice of heaven on earth to me. When we get down there we went to the sporting goods store where over 500 guns were stocked against the wall. Over 200 gunns were in the glass cases just ready for the pickng by an upstanding citizen; surely not me. After my penis was hard for over 40 mins; I had to leave. We stopped by this little diner THAT KICKED EVERY DINER'S ASS IN NYC!!! The breakfast alone was worth the 90 minute drive. We scarfed the food down in a record breaking 19 mins and we were off. Getting to the range was a bunch of twist and turns of the backroads of redneck country. I was looking for a naked white chic running from a maniac with a chainsaw; sure enough; that didn't happen. The range was kinda cool. We got there right on time to put up our own targets. The first gun that I tried to shoot was Tom's 45 cal. It had some serious recoil and it took me for a slight loop. I then regressed to Mike's 380. Shooting between the two was hot. These other kats showed up and they were shooting this 44magnum! That gun grew hair on your chest quick! That fuckin thing was the equivalent to a concentrated batch of viagra in your hands! We shot for about two hours and I haven't felt that good in years. I ddin't have to worry about cops running after me for shooting at somebody. I shot and shot and shot and had no worries. I had a great time with those two and they didn't get on my nerves. Afrodeus has quenched his violent bone!

 .......was a waste of my fuckin time. A bunch of Black tie motherfucker that did nothing but speak of how great the Bronx is. Maria Sonia Manzano was sweet though. Grandmaster Flash is still a loser. Now; It is bad enough that I killed myself for two weeks worried about what was going on in my body. Then when the blood results get back; I am in picture perfect fuckin health. I despise doctors more then I hate dope fiends. Check this out: My Blood pressure two weeks ago was 150/ 100. The worthless medical assistant called it that. Then; the digital machine was hooked up and it was 126/ 82. It took every ounce of energy not to curse that stupid bitch out. The thyroids are fine. I am actually healthy. I am not going to binge out like a starving ethiopian; I am going to maintain healthy eating habits. I am joining the GYM soon so it's time to kill some folk. Let me run Peace

 The definition of "mongo" in the latino slangness is basically weak, soft, fragile. So last night Mongo affair at summerstage was basically just that; weak. There were some highlights to the show but the lowlights almost overtook the high's. From top to bottom the show was a rollercoaster ride. When I saw Freddy was hosting; I was scared. I was almost praying to God he didn't open the show with.... " I want to eat........ YOUR PUSSY " His presence was good because he has that deep voice that carries and he sounded good on the mic. The lowest point of the show was this singer from; (sniff, sniff), the Bronx named Erinyes. I am going to kick Algarin just on general principle for saying this chic was from the B.X! Ooooohhhh she was horrid. She was a cross between Roseanne and Rosie Perez belting out some of the worse ballads in the history of summerstage. Most of the show was ok with Miguel, Emanuel, La Bruja reading a nice collabo. I felt their words forced out of their mouth's at one point( Emanuel and La Bruja ). They still did rather well. Amiri Baraka went up there and I was not impressed. I have my own personal thing against that flake so it will take a while for me to get used to him. The newly minted " Acentos Street Team " went to work and busted out flyers. I have to love their entusiasm. After some general stupidity at BBQ's and some gratuitous fat chics dropping plates; Rich drove me home. It was kind of funny seeing Miguel Algarin up there in front of over a huge crowd. To be honest with you; it seemed there were as much or maybe more people last night as there were at the Nats finals last year. A whole bunch of white folk enjoying Nuyorican poetry. Getting over there I passed by a strands book store and picked up " 3 tragedies " by Lorca. the damned book cost me three bucks. You can't go wrong with that. I am off to the doctor today to get my results of my Blood work. If I don't blog for the next couple of days; leave me alone. I will have some serious personal issues to get used toooooo. I'm out Peace Love Porkchops Fish

 Two of my favorite things in the world are in the subject header. Yesterday I had the greatest time performing in Taylor's little reading series for senior citizens. We met up at this little old folk home on 93rd street. I got there a little bit early and the hunger pain kicked in so I headed to go buy a slice of pizza. The reading started with taylor doing a great cover by Robert Frost to a crowd of 12-15 of the cutest little old folk. Before you think about it; I didn't flip and scream out " Precision guided bombs are dropping!!!! ". I went laid back with " the Weather " and hit that nostalgic string. The string was a little off-tune but they appreciated it. Jessica and Oscar were in attendance and they also read and did well. There is something about reading for a small crowd that is very comfortable. These beautiful senior citizens were attentive and they made me feel soooo good. Taylor has more issues then what I normally thought. I love the guy to death but he almost killed some of the old ladies!!! He has about 20 foam apples that state " Speak with conviction" on them. He gives them out ( well, gingerly throws them )to the audience. He starts a poem in hopes they would throw the apples at him and he can throw them back. Well, one little old lady threw the apple at Taylor and he proceeds to pick the apple back and LAUNCHES it back at the old lady. Dudes- this lady had to be at least 85 and better and he hit her right in the chest. My mind was running in circles. I was thinking " Taylor, you are going to kill one of these old ladies dude". It was all in fun and they loved it. As Taylor proceeded to tell us this was his test run; no one at any other VENUE better talk shit!! 90 year old ladies held it down and didn't complain. We finished and headed to eat and had some great conversation involving poetry and some other topics. It was a blur once I got my steak. It was an "ok" steak but I had worse. It was all in the good of poetry so I really can't complain. The evening was kinda hot as Eric, Tom, Mike, Oscar, Kelly, Lourdes and all met up at City Island for a post post post birthday shindig. We had a great time and laughed sooooooo hard. I acted a fool with my hair and sitting between Lourdes and Kelly both brushing my hair made my sexual fantasies kick in. Before you all get your britches bunched; Kelly and lourdes are a couple. Good night, Life is good , Peace, love, Porkchops Fish

 Sometimes life gives you a moment where it forces you to say " life is good". With everything on my back as of late; if I were suicidal; I would have swallowed a " lead Latte " a long time ago. Yesterday we had probably the best Acentos for me personally. Why you ask?? Not one moment of stress last night. Nothing aggravated me, pissed me off, I didn't think of anything at all. I just enjoyed a packed open-mic, great hosting, and a feature with huge appreciation for what we do. As I tried to stretch the evening out; I stood at the Blue Ox until 12ish or so. I am usually one of the first of the organizers to make his exit. I had great conversation with Rich and laughed those deep belly laughs. One of the first dawgs I met on the scene popped up late but he showed. Nocturnal roots showed up with homegirl Inez. I chatted with them for about an hour and it was so good to see them. Even made them see the " Acentos " view of creating poetry for the love and not the slam lure. Inez seemed to have Met Abena several weeks ago and Abena made such a lasting impression with just her spirit; Inez was floored. rep Louder ABENA!!!!!!!! I feel great today and I am working on this Fundraiser on the 13th at Acentos. I need to get the crowd to come through. I also want to put together a show that will leave the blue ox gasping for more.

 is blogger actin up?

 yo; staying home was actually alot of fun dealing with most of these crazy ass people in my life. The conversations ranged from my irritated butthole to the on-going relationship between Diane Roy and I. It was weird just Im'ing people all day. If I had the ability to IM from work; I wouldn't do shit all day, { not that I do much now}. Memorable moments conversation 1 Her: Have you and Diane made nice? Fish: Yea; the make up sex was great. She gives the best head on the scene. (Note: Here is where the rumors start that Diane and I have been fuckin. Meanwhile, the only thing that ever happened was Diane getting drunk and having sex with 12 midgets and I watched; it was awesome!) conversation 2 Her: How do you feel? Fish: I have about 900 pounds of acid oozing out of my ass every three seconds; I'm peachy Conversation 3 Him: dude- ****** was actin crazy Fish: I would behead my mother to have a go with her conversation 4 Her: What did you eat that got you so sick Fish: it wasn't a good piece of ass so I really have no clue conversation 5 her: swallowing is like swallowing phlegm when you are sick Fish: since you have been sick and swallowed phlegm; get used to it and swallow conversation 6 Him: My throat hurts a little bit too Fish: Stop sucking dick Him: fuck you Fish: see, stop actin gay and your throat would stop hurting him; you stupid Fish: no, I'm bored conversation 7 him: you need to get laid Fish: where's your mom? Him; seriously Fish: I'm good; I don't need drama conversation 8 her: Acentos is tomorrow? Fish: Yep Her: I don't think I can go Fish: Then why ask if you wasn't going? conversation 9 him; Drink cranberry juice; it's good for your stomach Fish; I hate cranberry juice him: Take some Fish: I hate that stuff him: Drink it anyway Fish: esta bien ( drinks ); this taste like viejo piss Conversation 10 Her: Have you been writing? Fish; Not too much; I have been really lazy Her: wow Fish: I am performing this Wednesday, I will get on it soon. I have been reading alot. I am back at work and my flow will be back to normal soon. My ass has stopped perculating so that's a good thing. Acentos tonight Peace

 .......calling in sick was definitely going to happen. I am feeling better but still not 100%. I already gave my day off notice to the Bar and also my job. I can't take a chance hosting or working and having to run to this bathroom at lightspeed. I was ok yesterday; I actually went out and enjoyed the weather for about an hour. The weather was a Godsend on the emotions. It gets trying stuck in the house. I bumped into a friend of mines that refuses to be identified in the blog. Due to the possible implications my words could have in court; he was like " don't be writin my name nigger; I can't take no chances". LOL. He kills me. I have known this dude for a good 20 years already. The last 15 he has been hustling in the streets and has suffered every possible positive and negative aspect of street entrepeneurship. I finally heard the words that I wanted to hear from him, " I want out Fish - I am tired of this shit ". No matter how much money you make these days, you will get tired of it. We touched on everything from "back in da day" to his Motorcycle that I rocked for about 20 mins up and down Webster. Something about a GSX 1000 makes you forget everything bad in life. I need to get me a bike really fuckin bad. Well, let me go try and function to be somewhat constructive today. Peace

 No, not a bomb strapped to the chest of a confused islamic brother; not an envelope filled with some weird white powder that turned my insides to mush. Well, shit, maybe!! It is Sunday and I am back to my normal self. I had no clue what the fuck happened to me Friday night and all day saturday but I almost died. I was the victim of food poisioning it seems. If food poisioning is a watery brown juice coming out of your ass about 30 times in an hour; I had it. It seems the salad I had on Friday for lunch had a great effect on my insides. It hit me hard at about 9pm and it was no joke. I was out and about ready for a great evening and I had to turn around and come back home. To give ya an idea of how bad it was...... I went through two rolls of paper my asshole is raw to the touch I feel dehydrated How do girls enjoy anal is beyond me. I was even worried that I wouldn't be able to host Bar 13 tomorrow and maybe miss Acentos. I woke up today without a full sprint to the bathroom so I knew I was getting better. One thing for sure; I will never eat a salad from that spot by my job ever again. The owner of the establishment is lucky I won't punch him in the face. Peace Not

 ........ NOT!!!!!!!! Last night was the Nerd Slam at the Bowery Poetry club. It was my first trek there in a long time and it felt good to be out on that scene again. This whole hermit thing wasn't my bag of tea. It was great to see that Shappy did " curate " the shit out of this nerd slam. You can tell he put alot of work into it and I have to give him kudos on that one. With a band playing behind the poets most of the night; orkos? I have no clue, it was kinda vague to me; I was soaking most of my evening in. Ed Garcia writing right before the slam as only a true nerd does delivered with his unique style [spock ears] and won the honor of being a nerd slam champion. So, this year has Eric Guerreri winning the Limereck slam and Ed the taking the Nerd Slam. Does anyone see a pattern of the louderARTS borg dominating their theme slams?? LOL Came home last night and had the best night of sleep in such a long fuckin time. It didn't feel stressful, I had great dreams that involved poetry; that is some shit. I woke up well rested and in a great mood. This is how my life should be every friggin day. Yesterday after I left work I headed to the furniture store with Lenny for she can buy a sofa set for her Mother since her Birthday is coming up. I am shopping for a wall unit for the condo and I saw one for 900 beans. My man had another one closely resembling the one I liked for 375 but the first one is bangin. It is going to make that empty wall look superb. If you read closely, yes I spent time with Lenny and I had a great time bothering her. Just jokin and actin a fool and trying to guess the color of her panties since she didn't want to tell me. I know they were black but she won't confirm nor deny this. DEM SHITS WERE BLACK CARAJO! Great time, no stress. Tonight I am headed to the Nuyo and I will either sac goat or be the break poet. Most likely I will hit break poet. Since my man dickboy is going to go with some of my other people's; I am not trying to sac to a 19.5. LOL. The weekend looks good as I will clean Pablo's (my turtle) tank tomorrow. I will definitely try to catch a movie; any takers to run with me Saturday during the day???? It's free and I'll pick ya up. Have a great weekend for all you Monday internet stalkers. Peace, Love, Porkchops

 ........ so not a nerd. Ed Garcia is!!!!!! The 2004 Nerd Slam champion!

 When your hand caresses the white chalk outline of death, you wonder how many miles are traveled between here and the forgotten.

 ........that will never be forgotten: After seeing Detroit Spank the Lakers; one certain dude was screaming his head off like he struck lotto. After my nerves getting touched and I tell him " Dude, relax, it's just a game, you are not even a detroit fan and you are screaming crazy" This other cat says " I scream like that when I cum ". I thought I was going to die. Definite surreal moment. I feel good today. Most of the Latino borg sprinkled with some whiteness met up at the Blue Ox to see the Lakers lose. Sure enough; Benedict Arnold Malone was on the bench to witness the championship slip away. :) Oh, and for all you NY/ Laker fan... Fuck ya too. You live in NY and you root for a west coast team?, I am glad the lakers lost. I feel really good today and I think I found the right mix of what to eat to maintain some energy. Going on a diet is kinda harsh on the body when it is screaming for what it is used too. This Friday I am headed over to the NUYO to catch some poetry. My friend Dickboy is suppose to head out their with his girl so I might try to perform. Peace

 it is weird how when someone tells you you have something; you have all those signs and symptons. I had a great time last night as we all pulled a rabbit our of our prospective asses at Bar 13. The Crowd was light and we still managed to have the theme slam. The urlLink sorta rican said it himself last night: " It is easy to host the nuyorican when you have 300 people jumping on your every word" Man, try hosting a room with about 15 people and ten of them being your friends! I had a great time being a jackass and we pulled it off quite nicely. One thing for sure; Acentos will take over before you know it. I hate when the crowds are light and we need to get people at that bar I feel good today. I was really tired last night and I went straight home. It was hard as hell not to go to RES and munch out. I have to maintain a promise to myself that I will not eat past 6pm. those late night dinners is what probably got my pressure going through the roof. Also, record this in your brain; I no longer drink pepsi. It has been 7 days and I think I am finally over it. The first 4 days were crazy as my body was craving that caffeine. Once I kick the vices; the diet comes on strong and I get my ass back to the gym. No bulk this time; it's all about reps and cardio. I want to get down to 200 by years end. Everything has to changed. Peace, Love, Porkchops Fish

 .....bloggin on Mondays. Most people read my wekend entries and they are quenched! I didn't write about this last week after getting caught up with my new obstacles in life. I had an aunt in Puerto Rico kick the bucket last week. This was my fathers Mothers Sister. Making her some type of family member. This lady brought new meaning to extravagant. She was one of the first people in Puerto Rico to strike it rich in some sorts. She had about 40 acres of land in which sugar cane ran supreme. After that went to shit; she sold it to some developers and before you know it; el centro was born. That was the story my dad told me and for some reson I think he embellished a little. I do know that the old lady was rolling in money and she spent her days traveling and seeing the world. To my knowledge she sold her land but got a pretty stipend from each bit of land sold. So she was set for life; life ended for her last Tuesday. After some travel with the Latino-American Legion, she complained of pains in her arm. She went to the hospital and the arm pain became chest pain. The chest pain became a full fledged heart attack. All that money couldn't save her. My father wanted to send some roses to the funeral but I had to remind him how she completely seperated herself from the family and felt it a need to become a " traveling hermit". For some reason she awlays thought the family was after her money. I never understood that because the Famila Vargas has always been well off. Of course the first thing out of my mouth was who was going to get all her land and money when my dad told me. A piece of me expected my dad to get at least and acre or two added on to what he already has in Puerto Rico. Sure enough, the American Legion is getting every red cent of hers in the bank, all her land, all her property, even her horses and cows. Her husband fought in WWII and they have always taken care of her after he died during the D- Day invasion. According to her; he was some type of hero who fought to his very last breathe. According to my grandmother (R.I.P abuelita), he never got off the boat. Regardless, Tiva (my aunt) lived a full life and did her thing. Fish

 ..........for this post for a minute! Feast your eyes on the ever definite boricua post after engaging in some jackassery at the Puerto Rican day Parade! Yes, I am 33 years old and my old ass threw on the ghetto gear and headed to el Defile . Egad it hasnt changed a bit. Speaking matter of factly; it has readily gotten worse. I wasnt completely full of enthusiasm to wake up early and head to what I hate most; crowds. A friend of mine hasnt graced the parade route of rowdy Boricuas in several years. When she asked me if I was going I was hesitant but with good company- I was there. Fortunately, Eric called me and I guilted him into heading out here with me. After meeting Eric and taking a non-eventful stroll to 51 st and 6th; things just went into motion. Historically the parade has been a feast of beautiful women eagerly awaiting catcalls from desperate men seeking redemption through one last hook-up. k, maybe that is pushing it but the parade has always been through the roof with the hottest women strutting up and down fifth ave. In the past several years we have witnessed some seriously barbaric behavior. Men throwing water on women, grabbing them, sexually assaulting them. Then the police presence has gone to a new level- Central park is closed, barricades are all over, under-cover cops harassing every alcohol drinking person between 44th and 86th street. Welcome to the world of over an estimated 3 million latinos invading 5th ave. This year was probably the worst year of the parade in my experience. Regardless of the great company I was in; the parade was still commercial, the girls were an issue onto themselves, men were bordering between "pigs" and "maggots". Lets break this down into designated areas - The company we keep I met a friend of mines that is actually extremely attractive to many of the normal men out there. I knew it was going to be one of those days in which the whistling, thrown kisses, cat calls were going to be heavy. I counted; 27 Rubias 17 mami 5 yo baby looks???? Wow, almost every single man that passed her gawked. The situation was interesting and I think she handled herself with grace. The endless comments didnt phase me and luckily not one drunken baffoon decided to lay a hand on her. I firmly believe once you touch; all bets are off. - They all have defined the words perfectly- This might be long. Since the women were plentiful; of course I was going to look. As respectful as I was to my company, it was hard not to see the winners of the day. The winners are not exactly what you are thinking. The winners were the exposed stomachs of 200 pound behemoths, the short skirts revealing butt cheeks, The see through shits exposing bras that are too small. Holy shit, what the fuck are half of these girls thinking of? I left the parade and I was thinking; more then 90% of the women at that parade were chickenheads. It was scary at what some of these girls thought was stylish and trendsetting. the guys dont stay far behind. Every guy was dresssssed straight out of a Jay Z video. If the cops put an APB on the guy with the white shirt; 98 percent of the men would get locked up. ********************************* It was an interesting day today as I saw much more then what I bargained for and didnt see enough of what I hoped for. Sometimes I wonder why people get upset when they get stereotyped. Well, don't perpetuate the myth and you will be ok. It was bad out there to see men actin like fools and women tolerating it. Women walking more like overweight strippers and not having a classy care in the world. tell ya this, it was bad. Boricua everyday except tday

 ......author of The Da Vinci code kinda rocked it. Besides the simplistic writing; I do think he truly brought you deep inside the story. The context was crazy and you definitely wait for more. Oh, if you are catholic; this book will make ya question your faith. I feel good today. Fish

 ......I walked home from the doctor to kinda clear my head. I have to take some steps in ensuring that I will be around for a while instead of kicking the bucket even before I get published. It was cool taking a nice long walk by myself. The walk took exactly 2 hours. It is really crazy the shit you see when you are walking through places your car can't get through. - around white plains an older white lady was screaming into her cell phone inquiring the whereabouts of her son. " I want to know where the fuck is my son!! I have been waiting out here for over an hour and my son didn't get off the fucking bus!! I don't want to go down there because I will go to fucking jail. I am going to transfer my son out of that school becaue all you have if fucking niggers!" Yep, ignorance lives in the Bronx - Passing by Mosholu parkway over the Bronx River Creek; a young couple throwing rocks into the water. It looked like an episode out of Dawson's creek - Cutting through Bronx River Park East park; a couple of young domincans playing baseball. They sucked too. At least they were practicing - Passing through Frenchy Charles Playground; a whole bunch of girls with carriages. This is the hangout for all the hot single chics with kids! - 207th and webster; little kids playing with dog hair from a freshly groom poodle that didn't look too happy. The bronx is just a little bit brighter. It is also a littl bit weirder. Fish

 .....like my thyroid glands have gone on vacation and forgot to tell the rest of my body. Either that or it's a work slowdown; I think it's the second one. Yep folks; I am now one of the 5 million Americans with hypothyroidism. A major slowing down of the output of glands from the tyroids. Another obstacle added in my life. I was the picture perfect example of health when I was doing dirt and banging hard in the street. I find poetry and decide to live this righteous life; this shit pops up! Oh well I have to wait for more test before we proceed with treatments. My life is different then yours Fish

 You're the tough boriqua who gets the most poet zombie kills. You make it most of the way, but die heroically by sacrificing yourself and taking out hundreds of poet zombies at the climax. urlLink How fast would you die in a cheesy zombie flick? brought to you by urlLink Quizilla

 .....are going to mean the death of me. Last night I got home after a good night at Acentos. I was happy and I crept into bed early to get some good sleep. Somewhere between poetry and the Da Vinci code; my sub-conscious is buggin the fuck out! I am dreaming that I am at the new place and my desk is right under the skylight. First off; I don't have a skylight and that got me pissed. Ok, I walk in and someone is throwing rocks through the skylights. I see them coming and they get bigger and bigger. With a weird order of the rocks coming through; I head to the roof to see who is throwing these rocks. I see about 25 people across the other roof. They are dressed in Napoleonic garb with the funky hats and all. The head Napoleon starts shouting that I have twenty minutes to exit before he comes in to " take over ". I see the rest of this spontaneous "army" pull out swords and you can tell they are waiting for the words to attack. I come back down and I am genuinely scared so I called " 911 ", A cop comes to my door and I take him to the roof to show him Napoleon who is about to attack me. Behold, he is gone and there were no signs of anyone on the roof. I immediately start thinking of ghost and that shit freaked me out. I woke up and here I am thinking; " Why am I dreaming about ghost ?" Napoleon ghost at that ! ah fuggit. Peace, Love, Pasteles Fish

 ....... Rich Villar walks out of the Acentos Corral and leaves bodies riddled with holes behind him. That is the closest I can put the evening in order. Tonight was a different night with some obstacles in the way of making my night of hosting a smooth one. overcome and adapt; thank you Clint Eastwood in that movie in which the name is escaping me. A good night with a standing room only crowd. Singers, rappers, poets, and readers all came to the mic and completely killed it. The night was just straight up hot. Rich got up there with Mom and pop in the audience and delivered an incredibe set. It touched on the blue, the bright, the love, the humor that makes Rich a special fuckin dude. When I featured back in Nov and he had the balls to say I was his hero..... Hermanito, Put on some blue tights and a red cape. You are my super hero. I am going to cal you........ " PERNIL MAN" Peace

 ...... to be a fuckin host. Last night was a good night but it was hard. I was drawing some serious blanks last night. I guess it was the first slam hosting jitters. I never hosted a slam and I think it showed. Well, at least I got balls to get up there. After some practice; I will get better. Any input for those poetry host out there??? Then again, that is me! LOL I feel good today. Got some good rest and that is always a good thing. Tonight is another hosting jaunt at Acentos where Rich is about to show some love to the Microphone for about 30 mins. It's his time to shine and I can't wait to see what he comes out with. Well, let me have some fun...... an ex-girlfriend of mines happened to come upon my blog and it seems that she reads it religiously. I was with this girl uhh........ 14 years ago. I have always maintained a friendship with almost every girl that has played an integral part in my life. I remember the first day I met her- it was insane. I went to her high school to a dance that my man Wil was going to to meet a girl he was trying to get with at the time. We met up with them and we were just outside of this Gym chillin and talking shit. Emely was sitting on a desk and wil said something to her and she was like " I wil fuck you up Wil". She got up from desk and she kept on growing. I told Wil ' Yo, you on your own". This chick was about 6 ft even. I looked at her my my mouth dropped. After some general stoooopidity going back and forth we walked Emily home. I wasn't sure if she was feeling me but I was kinda feeling her. Those days weren't the days of pagers, cell phones nor e-mail. It was all about the house number. I almost walked away from her and didn't give her my number. She asked me for the number and I was like " Yea, that would be a good idea ". I should have takin this as a sign of how crazy this chic is!! LOL Nah..... we spent alot of time on the phone. We joked and she was probably the first recorded case of " Fish writing a poem for a girl". I gave her a nickname of " My Princess ". We spent alot of time together when we had the chance. I started working and she used to come visit me in my job. I think things started going sour when I hit that confused stage in my life. I am still currently going throigh it. At the time I was also talking to my other ex Fatima. It was hard for me to feel something emotionally for two different females. So, I made the logical choice and broke it off with Emily. Funny how I reflect 14 years later and I realized the huge mistake I made. Fatima fucked up on me big time. I should have stood with emily and I know for a fact we would have gotten married. She loved me that much. Maybe speaking from hindsight; I would have fell in love with her just as hard. I guess we will never know. One thing for sure; when Emely and I got together the sex was pretty crazy. For two young kids with no clue on what they were doing; we thought we were porno stars. LOL I think the funniest thing to ever happen to us was in her house. Wil was in the living room with Ivette and I was in the bedroom with Emely. Ivette never wanted to give Wil ass but he was always all up in there; get my point? So I come out of the bedroom after rocking some Keith Sweat " make it last Forever " and I walk to the living room. Will gets up and says " Yo Fish, Smell my fingers". I look at him with this look and I am like " nigga, Smell mines ". We cracked up as only we do and it was one of those moments we could never forget. Over the years Emely and I have gotten together as friends, lovers, butt buddies, and everything else under the sun. I usually cut her off years at a time when she fucks up on me. She pormised to come to my uppercase and I didn't speak to her for about 2 years. She recently just got married and I am happy for her. She got married and her last name is Pinero. The same last name one of my all time favorite poets! Ironic in my book. Oh, when it comes to the oral department; " Emely, you are about 7 in my book" I am sorry but I have had some girls that know these tricks with their tongues that are certainly toe curling! Peace, Love, Porkchops Fish

 A quick requested overview about the Sopranos. I wasn't much of a fan this year. The show bordered more on an afternoon soap opera then a prime time dig into a mafia family. Then again; all this is just what I am entitled too; a fuckin opinion. Yesterday's episode set the precedent for next year. It will most likely come back on a high-note. The NY family will not go to war with the NJ clan due to a Fed pinch ( Gotta love that Taxpayer money ). Interesting was Tony smoking his own cousin to put at ease the dissention in the ranks from his own crew. In order for the spaghetti eating bat wielders to head over to NY to bash some heads; they needed Tony's ok. He wasn't giving that to avoid throwing his family in an all out war with NY. Since it was his own cousin that planted the seeds to nurture this war; Tony was the one that wanted to take him out. His cousin was a fuckin massaging knucklehead anyway. After some mafia tactics to track the cousin down; Tony comes from the shadows and pops him point blank with a shotty. Been there, seen that; it's not that neat. Tony will go through some serious guilt sessions. Dr Melfi will have to prescribe him some valium chasers after the prozac. The guilt he felt after his cousin did over 15 years in jail and never said a word. He owed his cousin and he delivered by giving him a gambling operation. He gets paid back with his cousin going into business for himself as a Hack hitman. Talk about being the very cause of your own death. Johnny Sack which is the boss of the NY family lives in Jersey. That is kinda ironic if you think about it. A N.Y boss in the Back yard of a N.J boss. When Johnny Sack and Tony S seem to have struck a deal; the feds come down! This fat bastid NJ boss runs through the back woods of Jersey to his house. On the real; David Chase ( Writer of the Sopranos ), Don't make James Gandolfini run like that, he is going to charge you for every step he takes through the woods. James: " I have to run??? Oh that is going to cost you extra." This season was really a deep trek into the minds of the soprano clique. It made ya understand the decisions they all made. Even when Adriana was smoked about two episodes ago; Christopher made so much sense. Chrissy: She was willing to rat me out instead of doing five years?? I thought that cunt loved me "? Tony S has issues with his crew and with his family. None of those can compare to the shit that he deals with within his own head. When we hear on the news about mafia related activities; we never think of the behind the scenes. Gotti had a wife, Carlo Gambino had kids, Gigante had a Priest brother, They all are trying to put food on the table just like the rest of us. I wonder if the mafia will ever try to infiltrate the poetry world. Well, we had Guerriri and he went into the witness protection program in FT Collins Colorado! Heard about the Tank he flipped in?? ERic: THE POETRY HERE IS SOOOOOO BAD!!!! Peace

 ...... I was still a knucklehead! Picture this; A dewalt drill with a 3/4 inch attachment socket at the end; somebody elses Galant in silver; 20 seconds and I have readily replaced my broken gaslid. I just came from the dealer and what pisses me off is this; The GAS LID DOESN'T COME PAINTED!!!!! That shit is not cool! Gas lid - 30 bucks Auto Body Paint - 50 bucks Labor - 20 bucks This fuckin bites. If the Galant was a piece of shit from 1980; you damned real I would be driving around sans the gas lid. X'ibit - PLEASE PIMP MY RIDE!!!! FISH FLAKES - On other fronts, Lakers were shocked by the pistons. Yeah baby: fuck Karl Malone. - They found a body stuffed in a trunk on 13th street yesterday. Any poets missing that thought yesterday was Monday? - Oscar De La Hoya fought like a piece of shit. Bernard Hopkins wasn't much better. They should meet this september and it is going to be about 1 hour wasted of my life. - I feel like setting up a paintball trip. I wonder which poets have balls. People who I think would go paintballin: Bonafide Fish Oscar Guy Juan Eliel M.C Rich People who would dare step foot on that field: Everyone else Ya gots balls; bring it - Is kidnapping a dead president against the law?? He is dead so it doesn't matter since he won't know it. I would take pictures of a naked Ron getting butt fucked. That would be some internet worthy material. - Sopranos ended pretty deep. If you watched it, the guilt TONY S is going to go through for killin his cousin when the whole NY crew was pinched is going to give Tony Nightmares. Looking forward to the next and final season in 18 months. - I am going to see a doctor this Thursday about my head. Seems I might have some issues that came back with a vengence. Peace, Love, Porkchops

 ...know you are dead when you have alzhiemers? I am just askin. When you catch alzhiemers; do you thnk you make new friends everyday since you forgot about the one's you have ? "Yo Ronny; you might be dead and that is not such a good thing. I am hearing every right wing conservative brown noser calling you the greatest President of our time. Well, In a time where the Bronx was burning and the National deficit tripled under your watch; fuck you. Reaganomics is finally dead in my eyes. " I know I know, " That is mean Fish, he died ". Well, Let me check my conscious really quick. Uh......... nope, don't care Fish

 Saturday Morning Fish Flakes - My turtle (Pablo) eats dry catfood. He stopped chasing the Fish around. - Someone tried to break into my car. Guess what they tried to steal??? My Fuckin Gas! They broke my gas lid but saw my gas cap was locked with a key. They have no clue how close they were to death. My car is not the car to fuck around with - Couldn't go to this BBQ today; looking for a gas lid. - Some dude in Colorado freaked out and made a tank out of a bulldozer; Eric(g), feel safer over there ?? - The Da Vinci code isn't half bad. - Poetry has eluded me for about three weeks; nothing new; nothing inspiring - I am hosting Acentos on tuesday - Saturday's are sooo great in my book. - I ate tuna Fish last night; it is similar to ex-lax being introduced to my system - 5 Yankee players hit home runs yesterday; that is insane. - I should cut my hair into a mohawk and dye it bleach blonde for nats! " There goes the Fat Puerto Rican dude from NYC with the Blonde Mohawk"

 ........ when the fuck you bringin dem kats home. "Five U.S. soldiers were killed today and five others wounded when an explosion ripped through a Humvee in eastern Baghdad, a U.S. military spokesman said. The deaths bring the number of U.S. troops killed in Iraq to 825 since the war began, including 605 in combat." urlLink This is all bullshit. I was talking to a friend of mines yesterday and we hit the voting subject. She used a metaphor for putting people in the white house that blew me away. Fish: So the reason you don't vote is........ her: I can't vote when my only choices are putting cancer or AIDS in the white house to run this country. I can't call dubya a cancer. I could consider him a form of flesh eating bacteria. A fuckin e-coli bacteria which is eating away at the United States. So far the first appendage has fully rotted away; Tenet. urlLink 825!!

 .....the fish is here, the Fish is here. It gets kinda stressful when you go home and you have absolutely nothing to write about when you get to work the next day. To my loyal insurgents; I still give you some mental rantings. This morning I got up and threw on the gratuitous cable; 6 years going strong; and I catch urlLink Stand and Deliver with Edward James Olmos. This was always a sensitive flick for me. It runs side by side to how most of my people's grew up. I start thinking about my most influential teachers in my 18 years of school. Kindergarden - Ms Rimple 1st Grade - Ms Wainwright 2nd grade - Ms Koslow 3rd grade - Ms Finnegan 4th grade - Ms Kimtis 5th grade - Ms Brau 6th grade - Ms Steinberg 6th grade in texas - Ms Montegomery Junir High School in Texas ( Lamar JHS ) 7th grade Math - Ms Portillo English - Ms History - Mr Ortega Phy Ed - Mr Lamont Spanish - Ms Lupilla Band - Mr Thornebush Back to NYC ( JHS 123 8th Grade Science - Mr White English - Mr Bello History - Art - Ms Woodrow That is all I remember; that is sad. JHS 123 was a fuckin blur as my time spent in class was only matched to my time spent running in the hallway playing round-up. I was incredibly bad in the 4th grade and in JHS. In the 4th grade was my rebellious stage. The teacher considered me so bad she had to place my desk in front of the class. I spent the whole school year right under the chalkboard. THat could explain my hatred towards chalk dust. When my mother came in one time to give me the keys because she was called into work; the teacher sandblasted me over glass and hot coals. Every word out of the teachers mouth was.... " Your son is the worst behaved in the class " " He doesn't respect me " " he doesnt do his work " My mother ran straight to my desk and beat me in front of the whole class. The teacher didn't know what to do. Those white teachers think latin kids get a verbally stinging reprimand; no; we get our ass beat. I cried and stood there. The teacher put her hands on my shoulder and I didn't say one word for months. here was the teachers dilema now: I never did my work I never gave in homework I never participated in her class I aced every single test she gave Math - never lower then a 90 English - never lower then a 90 Spelling - hundreds almost everytime Quizes weren't even an issue. I was a rebel every single day. Even when we were suppose to write in script; I wrote in print. The teacher gave up on me. Wanna laugh?? Until this day, I can't write in script! LOL How could she fail me? I was there every day and passed every test she gave; I just never did her work. Well, in her class I never did shit. At home I didn't even give my mother the satisfaction of seeing me reading books. I just watched TV and spent my time drawing. How I never became an artist was beyond me. My room was always filled with drawings and sketches. It was a talent that never prospered no matter how much I practiced. Yet, I drew letters in their own form. The spelling words we were supposed to practice were hidden behind the buildings I drew. After passing the citywides, I passed the 4th grade. I never liked that teacher and she was one of the first people who I wished death upon. Guess what??? MY mother was never far behind. After that; my mother was on my shit list until I was 28. I never disrespected my mother but we never got along. My father was the typical absentee parental figure most of my life. He was the 6pm pop. I woould see him at 6pm when he got home. I should have nicknamed him the M & M pop. He would bring home M&M candy every time he walked through that door. Them shits were the bomba. My favorite teacher of all time was Ms Wainwright. My first grade teacher that always made me and every other kid in her class special. She must be old now if not dead. She was the typical black teacher with that special kind of hug for all the kids that did well. Shit, a teacher hugs a kid today and get ready for the media to record your perp walk out of the local precint. My worst year was my attempted acclamation to the 6th grade in texas. I fought every single day. I tried to do my work but everything I did was wrong. It was a hell living in probably the most racist state in America. I know for a fact if I would have stood living in Texas; I would have been on death row. my first day in that school I fought the school bully in the bathroom and beat his ass. Instead of me getting the props; I was despised by every race of white, black, mexicans. I was the new lone wolf vying for power. Instead, I was the alpha male of my own cru that consisted of another half white and mexican, a black and latino and me; the Puerto Rican. We were the mutts of Benjamin Milam elementary. That was such a long time ago Peace, Love, Porkchops Fish

 ....... should be shot! Oh my God he sucks some serious geriatric ass! Eric and I walked into the stadium and it was the Orioles leading 1 to nothing. What the fuck??? After sitting and looking at my surroundings and being dumbfounded; I settled in. Hit, walk, hit, walk and it's the Orioles up 5-0. Did I mention this was all in the top of the first? The first fuckin inning!!!!!!!! I had a great time yesterday. All the poet borg showed up except for Oscar who got caught up at work. Actin like total fools we just yelled, shouted and had a good time. Upsetting was when they started the fuckin wave! That is some loser Shea Stadium Met fan shit. Meanwhile, Bonafide and I just sat down while Eric ( asshole that he is sometimes ) was counting to start the wave. I have totally rescinded his Yankee card; Shea stadium awaits your arrival. The chants we started were fun. You can't go wrong with: " Let's go Yankees " " Box Seats Suck " " Boston Sucks " " 5 Dollar Tickets " The Yankees were losing but Sheffield Homered, Jeter Homered, Matsui RBI'ed. When the smoke was over; the Yankees came back to win the Game 6-5. Ahhhhh........the sweet smell of Victory. The song that makes you a true New Yorker: Start spreading the news, I'm leaving today I want to be a part of it - New York, New York These vagabond shoes, are longing to stray Right through the very heart of it - New York, New York I want to wake up in a city, that doesn't sleep And find I'm king of the hill - top of the heap These little town blues, are melting away I'm gonna make a brand new start of it - in old New York If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere It's up to you - New York, New York I love ol Blue eyes and his gangsta affiliations. Going to the usual diner to eat and act a fool; I was totally overwhelmed with Eliel on one side and Tom on the other. IF you haven't hung out with Tom; well: he's different. He can be just slightly revolting in some ways but he's a nice guy once all his stories of porn, killing, windpipe crushing, jizz, and bee vomit all said and accounted for. Shit, that sounds like a night out with me. Besides that, we had a great time. We bugged out and had a great time. One thing for sure; the women at Yankee Stadium were crazy. I never have seen so many beautiful white women to catch a sports event. I don't know what they are doing in the Bronx but I need some duct tape really bad! Peace, Love, Porkchops Fish

 ........Blowjob! Yes, I am back. A dirty minded pervert talking about sex, lovemaking, fuckin, and midgets. Like if none of you have ever thought of fuckin a midget! Not a short chic or dude; a bonafide little person. I was doing my usual surfing of the internet and hit some sites that dealt with midget porn. There isn't much of it but the one's that do exist tend to be hilarious. Let me explain the thought process of many dirty men in your midst; they do not want to fuck a midget; they merely want to stand up and have the midget standing in front of them worshipping the love wand. Oh, as most of you sick bastids are most likely normal to average size in penis length and girth; don't front; the magic stick would look gigantic in the hands of a midget!! I have gotten some crazy e-mails from people surfing my other blog. That is the one where the sex talk goes unchecked. I have one religious reader that takes hints and pointers from what I write over there. I have no clue why people are so enamored with sex talk. It's all something that we talk about; maybe some not as candid as I. The topics can be broken down in several categories; Best sex Worst sex Quickest sex longest sex hottest sex Weirdest sex Craziest sex I strongly encourage you to think of what is "morally repugnant" to " Side splittingly hilarious " Ask yourself these questions: - Why did I fuck that person? - Oh God was I that drunk ? - I wonder if they are busy tonight? - Why did I leave her?? She did anal!! - Why did I leave him??? He likes it in HIS ass! - Why oh why did I let him cum on my face? - Why not a threesome with my mother??? Ok ok ok ........the last one is pushing but shit happens!! Forgive me as I am pushing the envelope today. Peace, Love, Porkchops Fish

 ......... is energetic; life is easier. Last night was my first hosting duty in a minute. It was the uppercase land of new voices coming to the mic and saying " I am fucking here " I was hoping to have hundreds of people at Bar 13 but I will settle for just a few. I still had a great time and kept the evening moving right along. A good host is important but I firmly believe the night belongs to the people. The past two uppercases have been just that; their night. I still am miffed over how my uppercase was fucking shot to shit with an aweful manangement decision. I hold no ill will but I have the right to be miffed so fuck everybody. I can't even be happier for the three yahoo's that featured last night. Maria, Matt, and Jessica rocked out last night. They all brought it to the table and slammed it down. Afterwards was the usual stupidity at res. It was higher then usual as some fucking paper throwing started going back and forth. I know we can act a fool but throwing paper is pushing the envelope. I can't take people no where. Funny was going home and Eliel grew some balls and asked me to drop him off anywhere in the Bronx. He is luck I didn't take his ass to the Yonkers border. I dropped him off at Westchester and Whitlock; I hope he didn't get mugged. My Fish Tanks are beautiful as I cleaned them within an inch of their life. In previous post; I did swallow some Fish water; I almost died. Good night and everything is cool.

 peace

 I have written three blog entries and all of them end with " Saying Good-bye" I have deliberated ending my blog run for a while. I have caught myself writing less and less poetry and in my private journal as I have gotten my "fill" on here. Instead of making a point to blog I am going to change up these priorities and shift my energies. So...... it's not good bye; it's more like an official quasi-hiatus. it's kinda weird Peace Fish Faranheit 9/11 tonight, Old San juan tomorrow, la playa Saturday, y el barrio Sunday evening. Life isn't bad. 9:42am

 If my day will be fortold by the early morning events in my trek to the job; I'm fucked. It is serious when I am walking in this rain and I step on what I thought was a clump of leaves and it turns out to be a dead sparrow. After hearing the crunch of the little birdbones, I look down and his little intestines came out of his ass. Fish weighing in at 240 pounds -VS- Sparrow weighing in at 9 ounces Fish wins but he is going straight to hell. Everything is cool with me today. I feel some what antsy as I woke up thinking about some of my past relationships and friendships going to shit in 2004. So far I have lost three friends for varying reasons this year. I am anti social sometimes because once I make a friend, I like to keep them. Especially after several years of talking, loving, and being a shoulder. Last week a good friend was hurt after I made it clear that I would not be ready for a relationship with her; not now and maybe ever. Seems that she was holding out with some hope. She figures down the road we would have been perfect being friends first and then becoming more. I always knew she wanted more but I always turned a blind eye to it. Even though a decision was made for us to still remain good friends, I know it will be different. Relationships are the very thing that makes me go round and sometimes stops me dead in my tracks. Seems that all around me most of the rock solid relationships have gone to shit and it hurts. Man, it even fuckin terrifies me of getting together with someone. That love shit is a bitch. Lately I have cuaght myself tearing away from my typical " The world is fucked up " type of poetry. I have written three love poems in a span of a week. Granted I think their shitty but it is a new ground that I have never broken. At one point I bash love over the head with a sledgehammer. Then I hold it and cry why I killed love. It's one of those things that you are scared to death of it but you want it. I live a very good life and many would kill to be in my situation. I have a nice apartment in a good area, bills are paid, car is good, money in the pocket. I live alone and I am never stressed in my palatial penthouse on Perry Ave. Then I see there is something missing and I spiral directly to a shithole named depression. Not clinically but enough for me to be upset and pick up a pen and write. I am not ready to give it up yet but if I don't, I doubt I will commit fully to that love bug. See the dilema? I'm out Peace, Love, Porkchops Fish 10:01am

 Why am I so ga-ga over women in whit pants?? OH MY GOD!!! The spic-nic was a success if I may over-step my boundaries and say so. I invited the pale folk to come down and offset the colors of this so-called picnic ala spic-nic ala general jackassery I do have to say that I had a great time. We ate plenty of chicken and salad that Nina slaved over. Pobre muchacha was sooo stressed and everything came out fine. After a little trek to waste my time at teachers and writers we came back and enjoyed the rest of an awesome evening. We hit the cards and played some good hands of poker. The dominoes were chipping off the table with Jess dancing over the table; that girl has issues. Maria showed up with a huge vat of " ensalada guineo ", you can't go wrong. Oscar Slept, Chance avoided the columbian festival in Queens, Eric made people laugh, Rich was Pedro Guananaba, Tom was snake Man, Mike was mike, Racheal was cute( Mike you lucked out), Juan Carlos was the token immigrant, Diane is a poker junkie, Duffy was DIAT, Raj was raj, Maria and Bill need to have kids, M.C siegel was with Hat....again, Nina was gracious. And too many more to remember The interesting tidbit of the day/night was the explosion of someone's insides in the men's bathroom. Me personally, the worst conditioned bathroom I have ever seen was in the bullpens ( central booking ) in the Bronx. It was covered with piss, shit, vomit, blood, and other bodily fluids. This men's room in the park yesterday was worse then that. Picture you go into the stall and see splattered shit all behind the toilet. It looks like some swallowed some gunpowder with a nitroglycerin chaser. They ran to the bathroom when nature called and pulled down their pants and their ass exploded with such force it left a three foot splatter behind the toilet. It had to be the most disgusting thing I have ever seen. The surreal moment was Maria's boyfriend playing this flute thing and a squirrel coming down and staying there for about 10 minutes watching him play. The squirrel was completely orgasmic. I love Maria's boyfriend to death but I would have killed to see that squirrel jump on his face and start humping away. This has been a good summer so far. Yesterday was a relaxing day and no drama what so ever popped off. The tight knit group of poets can actually hang out and not talk about poetry. They have excelled through that poetry community and have become friends. That is cool in my book I was kinda sad that more people didn't come out to enjoy this spic-nic. I understand the circumstances of babysitting, previous plans, new beaus, and just the errant need to just do something with other people. I am guilty of that more then anyone else on this scene. I am organizing a huge BBQ at a park to be determined. I want to see who is coming out with the excuses now. This will be a huge production of food and grilling and some serious stupid shit popping off. I tentatively wanted the BBQ for July 25 but that is toooo close. I plan on doing it after Nats. August 15th which is a Sunday seems to be the best day for getting together. No excuses, no bullshit, Bring food, bring rum, bring condoms Peace, Love, Porkchops What???? Condoms make great water balloons Fish 10:08

 The day goes well when you have nothing to worry about sometimes. After a rather constructive day of shopping at Home depot; Eric came to pick me up at the condo with spontaneous plans in tow. We decided to go eat at City Island. Our stomachs led us to the famed Tito Puente's Seafood SHITHOUSE! Oh god the food was sooooo bad. Mind ya, I've had worse but this food had miles to go before it hit the near edible plateau. To top it all off the shit was kinda pricey. The best part of the restaurant experience was relishing in the neighboring beauty of a party of at least 20 of the most gorgeous white chics I have ever seen. It had to be some model party because they all wee tall and hot!!! :) Another great part was leaving the parking lot and these three puerto rican chics were looking at Eric and I like we were about to be served up on a Cannoli platter. A few smiles and polite pleasantries and we were off to catch a movie. Heehee........ Fish still got it! We caught the new bomba of 2004; Anchorman. THis movie was sooooo bad. It had it's moments but for the general feel of this flick - it was bad. Several cameo appearances might have made me laugh but all in all the movie sucked. Spiderman 2 will keep it reign it seems. Since today is the infamous SPic-Nic; I had to gather some soda and plates for Nina just to makes sure she has something. I met up with her very quickly last night and dropped over 2 cases of soda with plates and and forks. With me taking my cooler packed with ice, everything should be enough. It was a good day yesterday as Eric and I were hopped up on jackassery pills known as " general stupidity". It was one of those days that we laughed at everything known to man. We called Oscar up about 9 times and left long ass messages just to show him some love. It was funny to us. Spic-nic time if you read this and you want to meet us out there; cal a nigga 917-209-4211 Peace Love Porkchops Fish 10:35am

 so yesterday the new timberlands were put on the feet. The new shorts with a new Ghetto t-shirt and the hair was slicked back into a pony tail and I was off to the races. I caught a movie last night and I had a pretty good time. As my joke for the evening was....... " So, are you going to jump on me?. I brought this new Axe Body spray and according to the commercial, you are supposed to jump on me with this errant need to fuck me" Well, she politely declined to fuck me but she did say I smelled good. Seems that I will sue someone for false advertisement as soon as I finish these 5 cans I picked up yesterday for 5 bucks on my old block. I am pulling out all the stunts in my vain attempts to get laid. LOL I am even thinking about getting.......... a haircut! LOL nahhhhh........... funny ass post but I am actually good. The hair is staying and I am happy with my porn Oh, if you are wondering who I wanted to fuck me; it was more like askin your sister for a blowjob. Peace 11:13

 You ever thought over the years how many secretary's have been getting their groove on with their bosses??? I say we poll and create a percentage based graph on the matter. This morning I was watching this movie with James Spader called " Secretary". It was funny to me at how some bosses use that power trip to get over. " there are eraser shavings on your desk; bend over " " You were late 23 seconds, please swallow today " " You looked at me while I was looking at you, today is anal day" I am not saying every single secretary is fuckin their boss but let's be real folks, some of them have to be sucking the he-whistle during lunch. Don't get it twisted neither, I am not being gender biased. Some of those male secretaries have to be tube steaking all day long! Boss or no boss you do have to love those during the day booty calls in the office. Can you even fathom the fact you have someone to come over and give the quickest but yet most erotic fuckin of your day? Awwwwww .........the good life. Would I fuck a secretary if I had one??? Well, it depends if he doesn't mind me taking his temperture rectally! LOL Yep One of those days! heehee Peace Love Porkchops 5:48am

 When you go somewhere expecting the world to bow at your feet but you get a friendly pat on your ass and sent on your way; shit is anti-climatic! Yesterday was a pretty good day after work. I headed over to Bronx Community College to perform in Jessica's class to give the young chitlins a taste of performance poetry. During the writing exercise I was bored and hot and assissted some of the rug rats. Some of them had some pretty decent work considering they all wanted to run out of the door. I performed three quick pieces with Rich ( my newly minted partner and lover ) going right after me. I call him that because I introduced him as Rich Villar; my partner and lover. Yep, my streak at shocking people remains intact. After some general poetry talk and questions from the students, we were off the attack the remainder of the day. As Jess didn't even think about fighting me for the front seat, we got some pizza at my favorite spot and we munched hardcore. After some general ogling at this fat chic with the most beautiful eyes I have ever seen, we had to go to Hostos for....... Oscar's BRIO award ceremony. That shit rocked for the 20 mins that it was. I was pretty happy for Oscar as he pulled out all the stunts with the "come fuck me" gear. My surreal moment of the night was one of the BRIO award winners for poetry came to me and personally thanked me for convincing her to go for the BRIO. I met her at the WORD festival last August and read some of her work and it was definitely BRIO award worthy. She sent it in and she won. She thanks me with a kiss and a hug. Ummmmmmm....... you got a check for two g's in your pocket and you kiss and hug me??? Fuck you! Put some money in my hand! LOL ..... nah.... I am happy that I touched someone. Of course I was kinda pissed in reading Oscar's Bio on the program for the night. Some brainiac spelled Acentos wrong. I tried to correct as many as possible with my pen but I wasn't going to ruin my night. The fiesta continued at the Blue Ox and it was cool. It nice packed house with an abundance of readers on the open mic. Oscar was on point hosting and everything was cool. I read two new pieces and I have some work to do on the love poem. Yes.... Fish wrote a love poem. It was a good day with a mix of being proud, worried, happy, miffed. You know how it goes..... Proud of Oscar Happy for the Bronx Worried about Eric Miffed over general shit My circle tends to give me an erray of emotions. Life is good though. 6:13am Peace, love, porkchops

 Yep.... the body acclamated rather quickly to waking up at 4am. It was second nature for a while and my fears of falling asleep at the wheel have diminished rather nicely. Either that is the case or all this is a fuckin dream. Last night I caught a great BBC special on channel 13. The typical documentary about the rigors and emotional strangulation of reporters on the front lines of war. Which war???;Iraq you fucks. The documentary was a "farenheit 9/11" light. Maybe if you add the voiceover of the fat bastid, the similarities would have been humorous. I caught about an hours worth and it was enough to make my stomach turn and bring the blood pressure up several notches. Most of the time we were given a first hand view of the reporters being filmed reporting. Kind foolish if you ask me. What threw me was the treatment of some of the Iraqi folks by the American soldiers. At one point they showed 6 soldiers hog tie about 30 iraqi's and ask them questions about weapons; shove their faces into the dirt; talk to them as demeaning as possible. The thug in me strted to understand why so many iraqi folk make a bomb and leave it on the side of the road now. It is the age old mantra of.... " You do this to me ; I do this to you " That vicious fuckin cycle that was initiated by us going over there. Can you blame someone taking an AK-47 and shoving it up your ass after that person tied you up and left you in the 105 degree sun for 5 hours??? Then they let go of one Iraqi and give him clippers to release the rest and the Americans leave. Shit is not right Kerry and Edwards...... you want to win??? Say this: " We will bring our troops back home and handle the middle east and Iraq crisis diplomatically" Shit; lie or not..... I'll vote for your ass. Then again.... I don't trust none of you fucks. 5:49am Peace

 Sometimes you hear things that you know will happen. No matter how much you live in reality and trace your steps on the borders of life; it hurts. Life keeps moving and it never waits for you. This is something I have grown to accept over the years. You have to either grab that horse by the mane and hold on for the ride or just admire the horse from a distance and relish in it's beauty. Fish

 Hola young nose pickers. I am back from probably the best vacation I have had in years. It is one of those " refreshed " feelings of having time off type thing. I completely acted a fool and did my thing at....... Jones Beach Orchard Beach City Island Central Park Bear Mountain Poconos Norfolk Ct ( KickBox ) .....and it all rounded off hosting Bar 13 last night for the man himself; Jerry Quickley. After feeling so much stress; time off has re-newed my faith in hitting the fucking lotto and giving this job the perpetual finger. Maybe even pulling down my pants and mooning everybody on the way out. My next jaunt away is for three days to the Jersey shore with more poet folk. I am really looking forward to having a good time. I am taking my hammock and I hope there are two eligible trees out there. Then...... August 3 is nats I will be out there. St louis...... you better be ready.... NY looks heavy this year. Long day today.... IF ya love me....... E-mail me DAMMIT!!!!!!!!! Peace Fish
