 "Ever notice that most computer books fail to provide the information you need? Most simply rearrange, reformat, and regurgitate the same information included in the manufacturer's documentation. What good is that? The whole point of buying an additional book is to benefit from the insights of an independent, unbiased expert." I don't know how many times I have bought a computer book, and have read maybe one or two chapters, and then never pick it up again. It's not because I am not interested in that topic. It's just a lot easier to reference Google to find examples of what I am looking for at the time. From a reference point of few, I think computer books are obsolete , but books that are more "strategy oriented", and offer examples of real world tasks, I would be willing to purchase. Most computer books try to teach you syntax. Although this is important, I don't care about that at first. I have a certain type of functionality I am trying to get to work, help me do that first. I'll figure out the syntax as I go. A good example of a book I actually used is the recent Wrox book urlLink Professional ASP.NET Web Forms Techniques , which is less about code and syntax, and more about good techniques with real world examples.

 "Online journals provide early feedback and help developers build better products." I am all for developers using blogs, but the example CNet chose was terrible. urlLink Mitch Kapor's , founder of software pioneer Lotus, has only made one post in the last month, and a total of seven in the last two. I was already to "blog roll" him and discovered his posting frequency a joke. Call me crazy, but for a blog to be successful you need to post at least a couple times a week.

 "Surprise charges. Annoying .Mac pop-ups. Hijacked e-mail preferences. Apple's overzealous drive to sell may create a user backlash ." The "Mac faithful" does whatever Steve says, so I imagine they will deal with the hassels. Just like windows users deal with Bill.

 "IIS 6.0 may be the best reason for developers to embrace Windows 2003 Server. New secure operating modes, ASPs and ASP. NET, and COM+ partitions figure prominently in our rundown of Microsoft's new web server."

 "As the web finds users and builders demanding more and more richness, we need to re-evaluate the technology that 99% of it is built on. No matter how sophisticated our back ends get, the front ends seem to remain stagnant. Yes, HTML transformed to XHTML, but that is such a small step and it is a problematic one when we consider the still eminent requirement of multi-browser, multi-platform, multi-device support." The idea that "users are demanding more and more richness" sounds like a Macromedia employee promoting Flash. Who are these users? If anything they are demanding simplicity and easy to understand user interfaces. I guess it really depends on how you define "richness", but if it adds more complexity from a users point of view, I think you are just adding to the confusion and frustration. I don't care what the technology is on the front end, it has to be simple and easy to understand on a moments notice.

 "Port80 Software conducted a survey of the 1000 leading corporations' Web sites and discovered "Microsoft Internet Information Server" commands a strong 54% market share in the race for Web server dominance." I was surprised by this one. Although I always thought IIS was more prevalent in corporations, mainly because whenever I did a job search, "ASP" was always the most popular server side development environment.

 "The ibm.com business mission is to support the IBM e-business transformation by creating a "one IBM" Web experience that reflects the IBM identity.

 "Sales of portables running Microsoft's Tablet PC OS are fast out of the gate, says market researcher Context. Early numbers suggest greater sales than previously forecast. Despite only a partial quarter of sales, Microsoft tablet PCs accounted for 1 percent of European portable sales during the fourth quarter." Can't wait to get my hands on a urlLink Tablet PC . However, I am waiting for second generation machines only because I can't justify spending the money at this time.

 "Apples decision to build its own browser tramples another third-party developer. The company has expressed significant doubts it will continue producing a browser for the Macintosh operating system, echoing a growing problem for third-party Mac developers as Apple Computer steps up its own application development efforts." Steve Jobs is a control freak. As cool as Safari is, that's what Apple's new web browser is all about, and Opera's reaction is the fall out. As a designer I understand Steve's need for controlling everything that ever goes into using a Mac. From a business standpoint its just plain bad. He needs high-profile third party developers now more than ever with the release of OS X.

 "Wandering the show floor of Macworld, I took a close look the Macintosh OS X. They say it's the hottest new operating system with the slickest user interface, but all I could muster was a shrug. Some new bells and whistles, but I wasn't fooled: This is basically the same interface the Mac made popular 20 years ago. What's going on here? Why hasn't usability made any progress since point-and-click and drag-and-drop replaced typing in command lines? It's as if the user interface folks have had their clocks flashing 12:00 for two full decades." Hey, hey don't blame all the designers. It takes a commitment from management to spend money on user interface design resources to insure usability. Management certainly worries about functionality, regardless if the user will even understand how to use it or not.

 "Visual interfaces are inherently superior to auditory interfaces for many tasks. The Star Trek fantasy of speaking to your computer is not the most fruitful path to usable systems. Voice interfaces will not replace screens as the medium of choice for most user interfaces." I agree with this. Imagine sitting in your cube and barking out personal e-mails.

 I thought the Tom Hank's spoof of "Castaway" was urlLink the funniest .

 "One of the great things about the fast-moving technology field is that companies can improve their products in major ways fairly quickly. Today's example is XM Satellite Radio, the leader in the nascent business of beaming numerous channels of music and talk to subscribers with special radios."

 "Jef Raskin, who helped design Apple's classic user interface, is working on a new system, THE, that could be a big improvement."

 "When it comes to Web development, everybody has taken short cuts over the years. This holds especially true when working on low budget projects. One of the most costly short cuts is skipping the development of a sound and highly functional information architecture (IA). While this short cut may take several forms, failure to devote enough resources and to document it properly will cost the owner of the Web site more than just a few cents." I don't know how you can even begin to create a usable yet scalable web site navigation paradigm without using even the basics of Information Architecture principles.

 "The place to find and share plug-ins, skins, and visualizations to enhance your Windows Media experience." I was pretty impressed with this site. This site came out of nowhere. A great example of Microsoft's strengths&#8212;building your product, and the industry with third-party vendors. Apple could learn a thing or two in this area.

 "Art vs. engineering. Aesthetics vs. usability. Usability experts are from Mars, graphic designers are from Venus . The debate between design (of the visual sort) and design (of the technical sort) remains ongoing. A website, however, can't take sides: it needs both to be successful." The eternal question&#8212;are you a left brain or right brain person. I still don't know the answer to that question.

 "With her glossy blond bob, chic librarian's glasses and "yes I'm as smart and fun as I look" expression, one model bridges one of the greatest technology rifts of all time: that between Linux and Microsoft." I thought this was pretty funny. Yeah ... I am amused easily.

 "News and Analysis on Microsoft Plans, People, Strategy and Products: Microsoft watchers probably know Mary Jo best for her award-winning ZDNet column about Microsoft, "At the Evil Empire." She's reported almost exclusively about Microsoft for eight years, for eWEEK (PCWeek) and ZDNet, and most recently for Baseline." I think this is an interesting daily blog. Regardless if you love or hate them, it doesn't hurt to get an objective viewpoint about what Microsoft is doing. After all it will probably affect you one way or another.

 "IDC reports that PC shipments worldwide grew by 1.5% in 2002, while Gartner estimates that the market grew by 2.7% for the whole year. So which companies were the big players?" I was surprised to see that Gateway was nowhere to be seen from a worldwide perspective.

 "Designers at Fossil say their mission is to geekize fashion wear &#8212; that is, to make watches that look good and just happen to contain a computer."

 "How do you prove your worth to clients in today's difficult economy? One of the tools in my arsenal that has proved tremendously effective is a website evaluation (or assessment). Performed as part of a sales proposal, a site assessment can help you speak knowledgeably about solutions to your potential client's problems. As part of a discovery phase of a project, it can help uncover opportunities for improvement. Additionally, it can serve as a benchmark to be tested against later in the design process."

 "So much cool stuff was on display that I started to get worried. Why? A few simple reasons: Too much stuff is precisely what crushed Apple in the John Scully days. And for all the snazzy offerings, Jobs didn't talk much about the segment that matters most for the bottom line -- high-end PowerMacs aimed at graphics professionals. He was also mum about Apple's plans in the education market, where the company has been struggling of late." Apple is adding all these additional areas to the Mac offering for one reason. Steve Jobs is a control freak . It's that simple. He doesn't want anyone else touching his baby. Why do you think he killed the mac-compatibles when he came back as CEO in the late 90's? The good thing about a dictator is you can can come up with some pretty cool designs when you control everything from the hardware to the OS to applications and peripherals. However, this is just bad business in the computer industry as you diminish all third-party vendors who can add value to the Mac platform and allow it to grow. Steve is the only one who is aloud to do that. It is Steve's selfishness that hurts Apple in the long run. To bad the "Mac Faithful" is too blinded by his "charm" and annual keynotes to see that.

 "One of two major product announcements Microsoft made at CES, Microsoft "Media2Go" is a platform for portable media players that will begin shipping from OEMs such as Viewsonic in late 2003. From a practical standpoint, Media2Go is essentially a video iPod, albeit with understandably larger dimensions. The devices themselves were codeveloped with Microsoft partners such as Intel, which designed the original prototype device, but Microsoft was solely responsible for the software side. In this preview, we'll take a look at Media2Go, both from a platform perspective, and from how it works in everyday use." urlLink For a company that "doesn't innovate", and only "steals" others ideas, they sure are coming out with a lot of new products lately. They aren't exactly all the best ideas, but they are breaking some new ground in a lot of areas.

 "Let's say your development organization has embraced design as a key to creating successful products. You've devoted time and energy to creating the perfect, goal-directed design for your product. Your programmers are ready and eager to start putting that design into code. Sonow what? How do you communicate your design to your development team, accurately and in sufficient detail? One approach is to produce a Form & Behavior Specification."

 "MandrakeSoft, the financially strapped creator of the Mandrake version of Linux, says its financial liabilities prompted it to seek the French equivalent of bankruptcy protection."

 "Washington's XM Satellite Radio Inc. announced yesterday that its subscription radio service will be available in 75 percent of General Motors Corp.'s 2004 models, expanding its presence at a critical time in the 16-month-old firm's development." I know I'll be looking for urlLink XM Radio to be preinstalled in my next car. Once you go satellite you'll never go back to FM/AM.

 "Microsoft plans to share the source code underlying Windows with several international governments." Proof yet again, Microsoft will do "whatever it takes" to keep large oraganizations from switching to Linux.

 "FM has the advantage of using infrastructure that's already built and can easily handle the type of tiny, continuous data downloads DirectBand will require.

As one of the first devices to utilize Microsofts dynamic new Smart Personal Objects Technology platform, this watch will deliver customized information directly to your wrist, in stylish watch designs that look every bit as good as they perform. The new watch will be available under the Fossil, Philippe Starck, and Abacus brand names." I had a Timex " urlLink Internet Messenger " powered by Yahoo! using the SkyTel network. At first I really liked it, but it didn't always work as advertised. A lot of the time the messages would come in gibberish, plus the actual Timex watch kept loosing power regardless if I changed the battery. I like the idea as long as it works as advertised, after all I always have my watch near me, unlike my mobile phone. You can also urlLink check out some other brands of watches using SPOT.

 "Cable television network CNBC, mired in a ratings slump, will air its first documentary Thursday evening as part of ongoing efforts to entice its core audience of business-minded daytime viewers to tune in at night."

There is an encore presentation at 12:00 Midnight as well, if you don't want to miss CSI or Will & Grace.

 "XM Satellite Radio Holdings said Wednesday it has signed up more than 360,000 total subscribers to its satellite radio broadcast service, and expects further strong demand in 2003." As a XM Radio subscriber myself, I highly recommend the service.

 "When we told our readers what technologies they needed to learn, they told us: easier said than done. While that's true, there is an approach to learning that can make it easier. With the right attitude and some essential resources, you'll be on your way slowly but surely." Always learning, always learning ... does it ever stop?

 "Windows Powered Smart Displays from ViewSonic work wirelessly, but not as well as laptops that cost less and do much more." urlLink Here is just one of the negative articles I was talking about in a previous post. I think these will be cool, but not in version 1.0, which we all know is pretty typical of Microsoft. They get it right, it just takes a couple times.

 "Development projects should spend 10% of their budget on usability. Following a usability redesign, websites increase usability by 135% on average; intranets improve slightly less."

 "Microsoft is already preparing an update for its Smart Display technology, which is due to launch late Wednesday during Chairman Bill Gates' keynote speech at the Computer Electronics Show. It will be too late for the first buyers of the technology, previously code-named Mira, but an important upgrade is under way and will be available later this year." Judging by some of the reviews I have been reading, it sounds like it will need an update. Whith this announcement of an update in six months, who would buy one now? As much I think this looks pretty cool, I'll have to do a "wait and see" approach.

 "Mention the use of HTML for wireframing or prototyping, and some information architects and interaction designers frantically look for the nearest exit. In some circles, HTML has acquired the reputation of being a time-consuming, difficult undertaking best left to developers. Im here to convince you that this is very far from the truth. In fact, using HTML as the basis for your wireframing and prototyping can be a quick and rewarding experience with fabulous benefits, including easier user testing, improved client communication, and faster, more effective use of design time." The issue with HTML prototyping is you need to let go of "code tweaking" and use an WYSIWYG editor like Dreamweaver MX. At the same time, you have to commit to whatever HTML "code" you create in this process is to be thrown away. If you make this decision up front it is easier to let go of being a "control-freak" code monkey that a lot of good web designers can be.

 "Apple accounts for 3.62 percent of personal computers shipped in 2001 , according to IDC Research. The company shipped 11.5 percent of personal computers in 1994 ." I honestly believe the macs are cool, and I think the new "iLife" is pretty cool integration, but their market share is dwindling in mainstream america. I guess the "switchers" program doen't seem be working. In fact instead of coming up with hard fast sales numbers, Steve Jobs talks about browser stats on their switcher web site instead. Nice spin.

 "I've gathered all the main tweaks and optimal settings which apply to most XP-based systems and put them here in an easy-to-follow format.

 "In a move that could anger customers, the company next week will announce a plan to charge for upgrades to some of its highly acclaimed "digital hub" software." Considering Macintosh owners are the urlLink smartest of all computer users , they must make more money than Windows or Linux users. I am sure they won't mind the upgrade fees. They urlLink didn't mind paying for ".mac" at all. And Mac users blame Microsoft for the "bait and hook" business model? Regardless, I believe in paying for good software like the Apple " urlLink iApps ". I sometimes wonder if Mac/Linux users understand companies are in the business to make money.

 "Co-founder of the Microsoft ASP.NET Team. Scott gives an inside glimpse into the development of ASP .NET: project history and motivations, design decisions." This is very, very interesting. Scott Guthrie, from Microsoft gives a very candid look at why Microsoft did what they did when creating ASP.NET. No marketing spin here. It's a very informative and entertaining presentation.

 "We want you to help shape the future of MSDN. Peruse the three designs below and let us know what you think. Use the poll to the right to vote for your favorite design and submit a comment, or drop us a line." I chose version three , mainly because the content that was new to the site was very clear to me, plus the navigation doesn't take up a majority of the page.

 "The Netscape DevEdge team undertook a massive redesign in a relatively short timeframe to show how advanced CSS and XML can help web developers worldwide in their quest to create cross-browser sites based on web standards." In a perfect world web standards are a great idea, however other than personal blogs, I don't know of any major sites that uses standards-based XHTML. Until someone within your organization makes it a "business" decision to incorporate web standards, then I don't think standards will really ever catch onto mainstream businesses. I think it's up to web developers to express in dollars to management what web standards mean, and not just their technical aspects. Of course that is much easier said than done.

 "Apple, formerly the undisputed leader in sales of computers to schools, has lost ground to lower-priced PC's that run Microsoft Windows." I always thought it was weird that schools were teaching students to use a Macintosh, but when you got out into the "real world" you could never find anybody using them, especially in business.

 "Although it's way too early to put money on Outlook 11.0 as the best e-mail client this side of, well, Outlook, we're tempted. This long-awaited version of Outlook, the e-mailer-cum-scheduler that's among the cornerstones of the Microsoft Office suite, won't debut for at least six months, but from what we've seen of an unreleased beta, this PIM might finally get it right."

 "Microsoft's slice of the web browser pie is 95 per cent with Internet Explorer (IE), according to internet research company OneStat. WebSideStory puts the figure at 96 per cent. But just five years ago, that same pie was split almost evenly between Netscape and Microsoft, with a few crumbs left over for all other contenders." It still amazes me that Opera, Netscape, Mozilla, and the new Apple browser get any press at all considering how little they really matter.

 "Google, which runs the Web's premier search site, has purchased Pyra Labs, a San Francisco company that created some of the earliest technology for writing weblogs, the increasingly popular personal and opinion journals." This makes no sense to me, but as a Blogger Pro customer I am looking forward to finding out what this really means. This has to be a good thing considering Blogger's current offerings.

 "Most of the hard core C++ programmers I know hate user interface programming. This surprises me, because I find UI programming to be quintessentially easy, straightforward, and fun." Easy you say. If it's so easy why do so many user interfaces suck? End of rant.

 I can't imagine Apple makes a profit with their high-rent "yuppie" retail outlets. They are nice, but all Steve Jobs will say about sales is that the browser stats of their switcher campaign web site is mostly windows users. I think the reason most people visit the site is to make fun of those freaks.

 "Microsoft partners will be showing their support for the software giant's development tools platform at the VSLive developer conference here this week."

 "First published seven years ago-just before the World Wide Web exploded into dominance in the software world-About Face rapidly became a bestseller. While the ideas and principles in the original book remain as relevant as ever, the examples in About Face 2.0 are updated to reflect the evolution of the Web." This is pretty cool. Do out March 17th, 2003.

 "At this week's VSLive! developer conference in San Francisco, Microsoft will be doing more than showing off its next-generation tools suite. The company also will be beating the drum for its ASP .Net scripting language &#8212; Redmond's alternative to the open-source PHP." Uh ... this article really underminds the credibilty of this site. First of all ASP.NET does not use "scripting" languages like "classic" ASP, but rather compiled code and the full power of VB and C#. Second, the source projects she talks about have been available for free for months. There is nothing new here.

 "On average, sample sites evenly distributed valuable screen space between content, navigation, fluff, blank areas, and system overhead. Areas of user interest should occupy more than the current 39%."

 "CNET's Brian Cooley - "The Voice of Technology" - will host these two daily reports combining tech news, interviews and experts like Stock Talk's Rob Black. CNET Radio Direct will be concise, important, and useable. You'll get this all in a compact, high-fidelity MP3 file that plays on the device of your choice." With the new urlLink CNET Radio Direct there will NOT be any "streaming" audio, but rather the listener must download a MP3 file and play it locally. I would assume this is much cheaper to produce considering CNET doesn't have to maintain a "web farm" of costly servers for streaming from both Microsoft and Real's streaming server products. However, you, the user will have to install a client application which takes advantage of "peer-to-peer networking" technology to manage the timely delivery and download of a twice daily MP3 file. Since you could download the MP3 file from your nearest neighbor rather than CNET's own servers, this further minimizes the cost to CNET of delivering their radio program to the masses. Could this be a new trend of listening to audio on the web? On a personal note, last summer I did purchase urlLink XM Radio mainly because of CNET Radio. I'm not even sure I'll even keep the XM Radio service now that the CNET channel is no more, although I do find myself listening to FOX News just as much. The comedy channels are pretty good as well. With everything that is going on right now, I really do like the up-to-the-second news. I guess the web and XM have turned me into a news junkie.

 "Last October, America Online declared it would phase out its longtime practice of serving third-party pop-up advertisements, a bid to win back the hearts of its members. What AOL didn't tell members was that it would increase the number of in-house pop-ups instead." They didn't lie, but they certainly misled their users. I think the reason they phased out the pop-up ads was because nobody was buying them anymore.

 "Rendering glitches in Microsoft's flagship MSN.com site have sparked renewed criticism from a competitor that the software giant is undermining its browser. Opera Software said Microsoft has been sending its browser a faulty style sheet, which determines the presentation of graphics and text in a browser window." Don't get me started on this one. I certainly don't know this for a fact, but this seems to me as just a case of Opera releasing a new browser, and MSN didn't update their site to handle the changes to their "browser-sniffing" code. Considering Opera's market share, I am not sure I blame them. I can guarantee there are other sites out there don't work correctly in Opera 7, but there are no conspiracy theorists working those stories. By the way, if you are using Opera, you probably dislike Microsoft anyway, so why would you even visit MSN? I know that isn't the point, but I think it should be asked.

It was, in fact, an application where we should have had more content. The tray navigation was a deep applet that allowed one click navigation. The product and solutions pickers were an attempt to allow you to drill down a couple of levels into the site without leaving the home page and without experiencing annoying page refreshes along the way. Neither worked as well as they were intended." Even Macromedia has to admit that an all Flash site isn't such a good idea. At least they are learning from their mistakes and responding to them.

 "The tablet has done better than the industry expected for the short period of time they've been shipping," says Roger Kay, an analyst with IDC.

Pretty aggressive expectations, actually." More positive feedback about Tablet PC sales.

 "The new design of Macromedia's Web site has more fundamental problems than its incompatibility with Apple Computer's Safari browser. Instead of devoting two-thirds of the site to a dizzying, animated ad, Macromedia should follow the examples of urlLink The New York Times , urlLink Lands' End and urlLink United Airlines . Their home pages use no-nonsense, multicolumn layouts that immediately dish up key content and function. By showing off the flashier features of Flash instead of using the technology to deliver value, Macromedia plays into the hand of its critics." Looks like all the people who dislike bad uses of Flash design are coming out the woodwork ever since Macromedia released their urlLink new "Flash heavy" site . Like the " urlLink Flash: 99% Bad " article before it from usability guru Jakob Nielsen, this has to be upsetting to the "Flash-is-the-answer-to-everything" community. From their point of view, they probably can't understand how a boring black and white design (NY Times) could possibly be more useful than the new Flash intensive Macromedia.com. All they typically tend to care about is how does a site look, rather than how useful it is to the user.

 "One way that Web sites and applications become better able to meet the needs of customers is by allowing them to personalize their experience. For Web sites, this means displaying the content as the user wants to see it. For rich-client applications, this often means allowing the user to choose the user interface through a technique known as skinning, which is similar to themes in Windows XP. This article shows how you can apply skinning to Web sites, wrapping their functionality in a new user interface. The technique uses the rich XML classes in the .NET Framework and the built-in extensibility of ASP.NET."

Self-help, computer programming, the Koran and jihad are all aspects of the same thing, he says: a search for a way for a good Muslim to live in the modern world." I guess you can call this line of thinking as "selective values".

 "I honestly feel that a lot of uses of Flash will turn people off of RIAs rather than turning them on to the concept." I couldn't agree more. I think Flash definitely has it's place, but trying to be everything to everyone is just plain stupid. I have said it before, but I feel you should use the technology or tool that best fits the job. Flash is great for some things, but you shouldn't try to do "form elements" in Flash, which is much best suited with good old standard compliant HTML.

 "The Intel "Most Unwired Cities" survey ranks the top 100 U.S. cities and regions with the greatest wireless Internet accessibility. The survey reveals a growing number of metropolitan areas across the country where people have greater freedom to access information and entertainment on notebook PCs and wireless Internet connections. Today, there are more than 3,7001 hotspots in the United States in locations such as cafes, airports, public parks and hotels." Cincinnati is at #57, although I don't know of any public Wi-Fi hotspots that don't include a hotel or airport. None of the coffee shops I know of have wireless access.

 "Geeks celebrate the 10th anniversary of the browser that allowed regular people to jump onto the World Wide Web. Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina led the Mosaic team in 1993 at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications; now NCSA is throwing a birthday bash." Do you remember your first web browsing experience?

 "What I need are highly condensed overviews, I thought, like those comic books that convert great literary works into a few illustrated pages. They condense Moby Dick down to 12 pages and provide a version of Great Expectations that can be read in 15 minutes. So that's why I collected comic books as a kid. And I thought I was a geek.

 "Apple Computer's new music service could help shift the battle to control digital media away from Microsoft's proprietary file formats, according to analysts." I think that iTunes 4.0 looks pretty cool, but considering Apple's dwindling market share I don't think Apple's music store itself will make much of dent. The more interesting thing to watch will be how the other broader market online music services react. However, if Apple releases some form of "iTunes for Windows" with the same type of rights then that would be interesting. Even then we all know competing with MS on the windows platform is pretty near impossible. However, I do hope Apple does something for the "iPod Window users" as this will force MS to come up with something better.

 "For all the glitz surrounding the unveiling of Apple's new music service, a quick look suggests that it's a solid, but hardly revolutionary, addition to the market." Hopefully this will cause other music services to fall into line and offer unlimited burning to CDs and syncing with mobile devices as well.

 "XM Satellite Radio made its 101 channels available to personal computers Monday, unleashing new competition for the recording industry, which is now streaming music into millions of homes via the Web." I really like XM Radio when I am in my car, but if I am at home I have too many other options that I would choose.

 "A revolutionary music store is now open: on your computer. With the new iTunes Music Store, you can search or browse to find songs youve never heard, or havent heard in years. Preview any song for free, then download your favorites in 100% pristine digital quality with just one click for only 99 each." Here is a key statement which actually sounds pretty good, although I still wonder what happens five years from now and you have a new computer:

 "Text-only advertisements work far better than banners, but is this only due to their novelty? Search engine text ads will retain their superiority over time, but text ads on other sites will work only if they focus on directly meeting users' needs." All text all the time is all good.

 "Microsoft's new Windows Server 2003 is opening up opportunities in the server landscape, particularly in the high-end area once dominated by Unix machines."

 "Available Now! The Digital Video Recorder (DVR). Now you can Pause, Rewind, Record Live TV at the touch of a button." Finally! I can't wait to take this for a spin.

 "Tree controls provide a hierarchical view of data and XML provides a way to structure data hierarchically, so viewing XML data as a tree structure is a natural fit. But browsers don't provide a tree control. Instead, use this mix of XML, XSLT, JavaScript, and CSS to produce an extensible HTML tree control."

 "Spring into creativity and download screen savers, PowerToys, and other tools that help you have more fun and create amazing things with Windows XP this spring." I haven't played with all of them just yet, but I do like the "Windows XP Desktop Wallpaper Changer PowerToy". Also, the "Blogging Plug-in" looks interesting although I am not sure anybody would care to know what music I am current listening to within Windows Media Player.

 "Software maker Macromedia hopes to encourage the proliferation of Web applications based on its Flash language with the addition of a new set of drag-and-drop developer tools."

 "Fancy media on websites typically fails user testing. Simple text and clear photos not only communicate better with users, they also enhance users' feeling of control and thus support the Web's mission as an instant gratification environment."

 "After earlier balking at a new contract, several of Apple Computer's key resellers have inked deals to continue selling Apple gear." Turns out the Steve Job's regime isn't as harsh as once thought.

 "If you're going to make interactive applications you have to give users clickable apparatus. Learn how to create buttons in Flash MX and then assign complex events to those buttons using ActionScript."

 "The wireless telephone industry appealed to a federal court in Washington to block a government effort to allow consumers to keep their cellphone numbers when they switch mobile phone carriers." I can't imagine a plausible argument for the phone carriers other than they would now need to compete on service and features.

 "Flash, of course, is neither inherently good nor evil. Neither is Flash just a tool. All tools have built-in biases. Flashs programming makes it effective for some applications and ineffective for others."

 "The shape is shifting for tablet PCs as manufacturers test computer buyers' tolerance for offbeat designs."

 "What is brand? More than just a corporate logo, brand is that tangible&#8212;and intangible&#8212;something that makes your product jump off the shelf and keep consumers and customers coming back for more."

 "With a paper prototype, you can user test early design ideas at an extremely low cost. Doing so lets you fix usability problems before you waste money implementing something that doesn't work."

 "It's tax season in the US again, and Nielsen//NetRatings reports that 22 million US Net users visited a tax site in February 2003, most of whom were from middle income households."

 "The below list reflects the five best Web sites in 30 categories for 2003 as selected by members of the International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences. These nominees exemplify the very best that the internet has to offer." I am not sure who picks these nominees, but there is certainly a bias on technology.

 "The chief news executive at CNN saw many awful things in Iraq that could not be reported. Now that Saddam Hussein's regime is gone, the stories can be told." A article everyone needs to read about the war on Saddam.

 "A number of Apple's resellers are no longer authorized to sell Macs as of April 1, following a shake-up that occurred during the company's annual renewal process." Another sign of Steve Job's brutal regime. ;)

 "More carriers now let you download software and information services"

 "How large can you make a laptop's screen without making the overall computer too unwieldy to be described as "mobile"? Apple Computer, famous for its slick designs, thinks it knows the answer. It's in my hands right now."

 "The key difference between user interfaces for sighted users and blind users is not that between graphics and text; it's the difference between 2-D and 1-D. Optimal usability for users with disabilities requires new approaches and new user interfaces."

 "Pew Internet & American Life Project finds that 56% of Net users in the US say they have gone online for information, news or updates on or related to the war in Iraq. Specifically, 61% have visited either US newspaper or TV Web sites while just 4% have turned to blogs."

 "First came the crushing traffic and the hack attacks. Now Al-Jazeera has lost Web server support for its troubled Internet news efforts."

 "A preview of an upcoming version of Microsoft's MSN service has leaked onto the Web, offering an early glimpse at the software giant's ever-evolving online strategy. The new software, dubbed MSN 8.5, comes five months after the launch of MSN 8, which Microsoft considered the most significant update of its Internet service since its inception." It use to be I would never think of using AOL, MSN, or even CompuServe for an "internet service". However, since I have been using MSN hotmail as my main e-mail address I began storing my address book, favorites, stock listings, files, and calendar online so I could access it from any computer. I love this capability of accessing my data regardless of what I have installed on my current machine as well as the ISP I was using. So when MSN 8 came out I gave it a try with the upmost scrutiny and unfortunately I became hooked. Although its not perfect, no matter what machine I have in front of me I can access my data from whatever computer I am currently browsing the internet. I can still access my data through MSN.com without having MSN 8 installed minus the rich user interface MSN provides. MSN 8.5 fixes a lot of the little things I hated about about MSN 8.0 even though the changes are only subtle. Now if If an get them to tone done some of the colors I would be really happy.

 "More with less seems to be the mission impossible for web designers: Addressing more customers, a broader audience, more diversity in terms of browsers, more accessibility, users asking for more speed, while spending less to maintain or redesign a web site. Caught between a rock and a hard place, web designers face a formidable challenge. Yet they are finding an unsuspected ally in the battle: web standards." Personally I feel the business benefits of web standards are far more important than anything technical, after all I think we all understand what really drives decisions on producing a web site.

 "Over the last two years, we've heard from increasing numbers of executives who want to bring interaction design in-house because they've realized how critical it is to product success. There are plenty of challenges involved in doing this, including hiring and training the right people. One of the challenges companies may not expect, though, is in deciding how to use those resources once they've been found."

 "Gates & Co. are paying a licensing fee for SCO's Unix technology -- and some techies see a plot to derail the rival operating system."

 "Evaluating a new product can be difficult, and with each version there are always new features to navigate. Enter Macromedia On Demand seminars, the fastest way to get up to speed quickly." Macromedia keeps coming out with interesting ideas.

 "Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT) provide a powerful and easy way to convert XML documents into other types of files, such as HTML. We'll compare building HTML objects in classic ASP vs. XSLT."

 "ActiveWin's Byron Hinson has posted up his review of Macromedia's popular web site building suite -Dreamweaver MX as part of an ongoing review of their Studio MX package."

 "Web designers often rely on personal preferences or gut feelings to make decisions about a site redesign. See how collecting accurate usage data can set your design on a better course."

 "While Apple Computer grabs publicity for its new 99 cent music download store, Microsoft is quietly preparing for a counterattack by improving its own technology for supporting subscription music services."

 "A new updated version of Web Matrix is in the works. A few of us on the ASP.NET team have been working on incorporating some of the comments and suggestions made by users alongside our ASP.NET v2 features."

 "NASA released what it billed as the first portrait of Earth as seen from Mars. The colorized photograph shows Earth from 86 million miles away as a small blue dot orbited by its even smaller moon." I thought this was pretty cool.

 "According to the latest report from Leichtman Research, the top cable broadband providers in the US added over 1.2 million subscribers during the first quarter of this year, while the leading digital subscriber line (DSL) providers in the US added over 650,000 new subscribers."

 "Visio 2003 gives business and technical professionals the power to visualize and communicate ideas, information, and systems. Use the simple, flexible tools in Visio 2003 to easily create business and technical charts and graphics that capture your inspiration and communicate it with impact."

 "The Companys interactive Internet division, urlLink www.CoActivity.com , provides real-time interactive computer-based sales and marketing staff training and support, design of multimedia electronic sales tools and presentations, Internet web site designing, hosting and e-commerce software." After a year of contracting I have finally decided to take a full-time position.

 "Here's a question: what if I was to tell you that you can write your own version of Word using something like HTML and JavaScript? What if I added that you could run on your hard disk or launch it directly from your Web server and use it to update your site's content? It sounds a little far fetched, I know, but it's right here, right now -- and it calls itself "Zool"."

 "Not all animations should run automatically and continuously. ActionScript gives you the ability to provide users with control over animations and other Flash actions. In this tutorial you'll learn how to create complex buttons that use ActionScript commands to cause movie clip objects to disappear and reappear."

 "Sites re-launch all the time in spectacular fashion. But this is starting to change. Jared points out how the best design teams are slowly evolving their sites, not drastically overhauling them."

 "The Mozilla Firebird project is a redesign of Mozilla's browser component, written using the XUL user interface language and designed to be cross-platform." urlLink I downloaded Firebird and I was quite impressed. I still like IE, but MS hasn't released anything new in a long time. It was a nice breath of fresh air.

 "On July 25th and 26th, we're doing it again - Gnomedex 3.0: Fellowship of the Geeks! Once again in downtown Des Moines, Iowa, Gnomedex 3.0 will bring together geeks and non-geeks (as well as the entire Lockergnome crew) for a two-day conference with one geek to rule them all!" urlLink It's official. I am going to Gnomedek 3.0.

 "Ive been involved in the redesign of a lot of Web sites. Depending on how the sites were originally created, some redesigns were easier than others; however, most of them were still more difficult and time-consuming than they needed to be. As a result, I made a New Years resolution to start using XHTML and CSS2 exclusively when building or rebuilding sites. Not only do XHTML and CSS2 result in cleaner, more efficient code, but they also improve accessibility and scalability."

 "The ability to parse XML and rely on XML-driven data in MX opens up Flashs development potential. With this functionality, you can modify menu items by changing an XML file instead of rehashing your ActionScript."

 "While many commercial websites struggle to be noticed, some bloggers are unintentionally attracting lots of hits. Their daily utterances, even on topics they know nothing about, are generating high traffic from search engine queries."

 "Jason shares his knowledge about RSS: What it is, how it's used, and why you need it. Just don't ask him what it stands for."

 I thought this was pretty funny.

 "In the late 1990s, Netscape had an idea. Instead of writing applications for a particular operating system, write them to a Web browser. Given ubiquitous Internet availability and the presence of a known reliable middleware platform, people could work whenever and wherever they had a Web browser. History reveals that the plan didn't quite work, as incompatibilities, monopolies, and other intangibles interfered. However, the idea never went away. The W3C eventually standardized a set of technologies that made dynamic HTML possible. Mozilla finally released an amazingly powerful and mutable browser suite. A few client-side plug-ins evolved into quick and easy UI components from annoying toys. What follows is an email discussion between some of O'Reilly's editors. "

 "The Samsung SCH-i700 Pocket PC Phone is a sleek, attractive, and functional communications tool. It's also a top-notch PDA, and a cell phone capable of replacing your trusty old Motorola or Nokia. Being able to access your e-mail, and surf the net without wires, or troublesome IrDA connections is a pleasant and rewarding experience, if you're willing to pay the price for it. The i700 isn't for everyone, only those willing to rethink the way they use a cell phone will find this type of integrated device truly useful." Definitely looking into this.

 "US vendor was too inflexible and 'high-maintenance' complains distributor." They actually compared Macromedia to a "high maintenance woman". Ouch!

 "In a surprise move, Microsoft on Wednesday reduced the price of its Xbox video game console by 10 percent." I don't know if I'll finally take the plunge. Maybe eventually Microsoft will just give them away.

 "Good organization, complete information, and clear writing are, of course, key to the success of any design document, but there are some other, less-obvious techniques you can use to make your documents more readable and understandable. Here are a few of them."

 "Another interesting aspect of Longhorn's graphics architecture, or Desktop Composite Engine (DCE), is that it will offer users a choice of three different user interfaces."

 "But interface designers are often blinded by their own habits, which prevents innovation."

 "Get comparative information in the ongoing debate over which platform is better for building Web applications: PHP or ASP.NET. The two platforms are compared on the basis of installation, framework, developer productivity, and data access."

 "One of the things I dont hear enough about from many usability professionals/pundits is the importance of specific interface elements setting expectations. What happens next after when I click this button? Can I cancel this order later? What if I cant do what this button is asking me to do? What do I need for step 3 of this four step process? The answers to these little questions are absolutely critical when it comes to building a great customer experience online."

 "A few years ago, when Steve Jobs introduced Apple's popular iMac computer, his archrival, Bill Gates, groused that Apple had reduced innovation in the personal computing world to translucent colored plastics. Now Apple Computer is dissing back in repspone to the annual Winhec computer hardware conference."

 "The new version of MSN Messenger is coming this summer and we want you to be the first to see it! New features make Instant Messaging better than ever."

 " What can you do with the digital content you "own"? It's a controversial question that both Microsoft and Apple must address. Here's what I think Steve Jobs could teach Steve Ballmer about the issue."



 "Customers can now consolidate charges for the company's Wi-Fi service on their monthly cell phone service bills--a feat wireless carrier have maintained is technically difficult." This is great news for the future of Wi-Fi and wireless access. Unfortunately it does us no good in backward Cincinnati, Ohio.

 "Now in its eighth year, the User Interface Conference has earned a reputation as the best conference to learn the latest design techniques. On October 13-16 , User Interface Engineering hosts the conference in Cambridge, MA ." If you got the cash and the time it is well worth it.

 "Alan Cooper speaks out about turmoil in software management, why .NET beats VS6 by a hair's breadth, and more." I thought this title was quite funny as it points out the obvious joke. We are all paid to build web applications for our clients, but do we actually look into how users will interact with the software we develop? The struggle continues...

 "A recent Builder.com article suggested that PHP is not ready for enterprise class development, especially when compared to ASP and JSP. One writer disagrees, and he offers this rebuttal." From my experience ASP/ASP.Net/JSP pays the bills in corporate America, but PHP actually runs all the personal blogs via "Movable Type".

 "Bill Gates pulls a few tricks from the Steve Jobs playbook as he launches Athens, the translucent new multitasking PC he claims is "everything a user needs." But lest attendees at WinHEC think Gates has gone Mac-mad, he also promises to unveil Microsoft's plans for secure computing."

 "The PC manufacturer is expected to begin shipping the new version of its tablet PC, with Intel's 900MHz ultra-low-voltage version of the Pentium M."

 "Microsoft's next conquest could be your telephone. Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates says future versions of Windows will be more phone-friendly, as he demonstrates prototypes at a company-sponsored conference." "Sorry I hung up on you, but I had to reboot my machine."

 "RSS is a syndication standard that specifies the syndication format. RSS feeds are XML-formatted files, with a tag for each content item that you want to syndicate. This article examines how to consume an RSS feed via an ASP.NET Web page. Specifically, it demonstrates how to display the data from the ASPMessageboard RSS feed using an ASP.NET DataGrid."

 "Apple says its new online music store sold more than 1 million songs during its first week of operation. Analysts say that shows people will pay for downloads if given the chance." The question is how does this compare to other music services, and is this just a bloated figure that will dwindle after the "honeymoon" phase wears off. Regardless, Apple has made an impact on how music is sold over the internet. They just need to tap the larger PC market.

 "Lots of downloadable apps now come with unwanted add-ons: "spyware" programs that observe your online moves, then deliver targeted pop-up ads. I hate this stuff. Here's what I do about it."

 "Web users are highly goal-driven, and ads that interfere with their goals will be ignored. To succeed, ads must work with the medium, as well as with the user's aims and mindset."

 "With the introduction of components in Macromedia Flash MX, complex functionality became easily accessible. Rather than creating custom buttons, scroll bars, and list boxes, we can now quickly drag and drop these components to add functionality to our applications."

 "As numerous readers have pointed out, a job posting on monster.com seems to indicate that Apple will indeed develop a Windows version of iTunes. The question now, of course, is whether the Windows iTunes version will offer all the functionality of the Mac version, or if Apple will limit the product to simply accessing the iTunes Music Store and playing back the downloaded music." Here is a portion of the urlLink job description on Monster.com :

 "Apple's new iTunes Music Store is what many people have been looking for: a legal way to buy music on the Net without a lot of ridiculous restrictions. The downside: all the money I'm spending on it."

 "I asked Tony Lopez, the executive producer for the new macromedia.com, to give you an overview of the changes we have made to global navigation. I thought you would be interested in hearing the rationale and challenges straight from the horse's mouth-so to speak."

 "What if you could see screen captures of your web pages as they're going to look on any operating system platform? On any browser? Now you can, with Browser Cam. We've designed Browser Cam to make life easy for you whether you're a web master, web developer, or QA engineer. Browser Cam creates screen captures of your web pages loaded in any browser, and on any operating system, so you'll be 100% sure your web pages look good-and work right-on any platform." This is a great tool and the UI is really done well. Very usable site. However, it is a bit pricey and obviously only tests how it looks rather than functionality. Still pretty interesting though. You can view my site's browser cam urlLink here and urlLink here .

 "Installing Apache and PHP on Windows isn't easy, but it doesn't have to be a process of trial and error. With our guide, learn the tricks you'll need to get started."

 "Last week, Steve Jobs unveiled some speedy desktops, an attractive OS, and a slew of other hardware and software products. But I don't think Bill Gates will lose any sleep over it. Here's why."

 "I like watching how people react to software. I also like watching how people react to me: I am often the first UI designer my clients have worked with. They say the most interesting things. Im sure youve heard some, too."

 "Google is in the process of releasing a new browser toolbar that lets people block pop-up ads and easily update their blogs as they surf the Web. "

 The Google Toolbar increases your ability to find information from anywhere on the web and takes only seconds to install. When the Google Toolbar is installed, it automatically appears along with the Internet Explorer toolbar. This means you can quickly and easily use Google to search from any website location, without returning to the Google home page to begin another search.

 "Who needs Internet Explorer, now that Jobs & Co. has its own browser? The much bigger threat is the growing chance that Microsoft will abandon Office for the Mac."

 "They have Google in their crosshairs. They are trying to replicate every feature of Google in the next year, and have tie-ins with the next version of IE (including a 'search' box right on the browser toolbar that by default points at MSN Search) and in Windows Longhorn (the Search function in the shell will have an Internet option that will go to MSN by default). They made a build-vs-buy decision in the last few months (in fact they made an informal offer to purchase Google, which was refused)."

 "This is the second of our two conversations with Jeffrey Zeldman. Our first conversation covered the wonderful world of Web standards: from The Web Standards Project to his latest book, Designing With Web Standards."

 "As it prepares its own algorithmic search engine, MSN quietly launches software that will index Web sites, a move that raises questions about MSN's deal with Yahoo unit Inktomi."

 "The Treo 600 smartphone looks more like a modern cell phone than any of Handspring's previous products." This looks pretty sweet. Read all about it at urlLink News.com and urlLink eWeek.com .

 "Now that I've had a chance to live with a Tablet PC for a while, I think it's about time to ask: Would I trade in my laptop--or a digital pen--for one? My answer: Not quite yet. Here's why."

 "It's becoming the dominant way to search the Net, and that worries critics who see problems with its privacy practices and ranking methods."

 "3DOSX is a file system browser that utilizes three dimensions to view directory hierarchies. It supports a full range of file system actions, such as copying, labeling, creating new folders, and ejecting disks." This looks like an interesting idea, but a very poor implementation. The file system get's way to much in the way of the desktop in this version. I could see if someone put some thought into it they could create a much more usable version.

 "Technical muscle and a history of innovation made Sun a Silicon Valley standard-bearer. It also blinded famously combative Scott McNealy to the coming Linux wars. Now he's fighting to survive."

 "Roz Ho, the general manager of Microsoft's Mac Business Unit, has confirmed that no future versions of Internet Explorer will be released for the Mac."

 "In the latest deal in the rapidly expanding online music business, MusicNet said Thursday that it would offer more than 350,000 songs to subscribers in Microsoft's Windows Media format." Since RealNetworks was dumping them for Rhapsody this seemed like the only obvious choice left.

 "Apple's vertically integrated approach offers a hidden advantage. By setting design and performance specifications of Macintosh hardware, writing system software becomes easier. There are fewer variables to contend with and less testing and debugging required. Such a controlled environment produces excellent code quickly at lower overall cost." Whenever you compare PC to Macs the above fact has to be taken into consideration. Apple doesn't design for the broadest reach in hardware, thus they have a distinct advantage when creating an operating system. However, they pay for it with market share as you are the only one producing the machine."

 "Tabs and toolbar search top the list of must-have features in Firebird that put the catch-up ball finally back in Microsoft's court."

 "Presented by The International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences, The Webby Awards is the leading international honor for the worlds best web sites. The Academy is proud to present The 7th Annual Webby Awards Winners."

 "Jeffrey Zeldman is a founder of The Web Standards Project (WaSP) and the author of Designing With Web Standards. I have had the pleasure of working with Zeldman, creating server-side code and content management systems to power some of his designs. Since many Web developers do not get the opportunity to work directly with Zeldman, Im happy to report that reading DWWS is a lot like working with Zeldman himself."

 "A new film that Democrats hope will help to unseat the president has no basis in science ." These are the type of things that make me lean to the right.

 "Robert Williams is an exec on the Tablet PC team. So, we thought we'd ask him for his version of the influences (and influencers) that brought about the Tablet PC."

 "As some of you might know, Microsoft has been working on the first revision to the Windows XP Tablet operating system, code named Lonestar. It will ship under the name Windows XP Tablet Edition 2005 and will be a free upgrade for tablet owners." Second generation TabletPC are coming out soon. I said I was waiting till then to purchase. I think I just might take a very hard look.

 urlLink This sickens me...

 "How does a user interface designer know that a given design will work? How does anybody develop enough confidence in a design to move it toward the real world? The methods designers use to evaluate user interfaces require training and experience. But the people who need to hire designers are unlikely to have those skills. How do the people who are paying the bills know they are getting good answers?" It's like selling anything in life. You need to express confidence if you want someone to buy something from you, whether it's a product or an idea.

 "Kam, and his team, are building the new user interface for the next version of Windows, code-named Longhorn. One of the complaints we hear from people is that the computer is too controlling. In other words, Microsoft's programmers, in the past, have chosen defaults that made the experience inflexible."

 "Bryan and I were talking last night about Microsofts incredible number of bloggers. And why Apple doesnt have the same kind of blogging community. Its a pretty easy answer. Apple has a culture of fear ." Yet another negative side to Steve Jobs.

 Ever since the new "Blogger" came out I have been toying with the idea of canceling my urlLink TypePad account and using this free service. I know urlLink TypePad has more functionality, but not exactly sure if it's worth the money. I'd love to see a head to head comparison from TypePad telling us why we should use TypePad over Blogger. I would think it would be in their best interest to do so. Heck, just add a Blogger column to urlLink this comparison .

 "..Web search tool, Google has added features and worked to make others more appealing to non-techies. It recently rolled out a streamlined version of Blogger.." I have to admit, I am liking the new and improved Blogger. And I am impatient.

 "Dr. Maeda, an associate professor of design and computation at the M.I.T. Media Lab and an award-winning graphic designer, has spent eight months putting forward his own one-word vision of the future: simplicity." Keep it simple ... stupid.

 "A star-studded list of technology executives on Wednesday plan to endorse President Bush for another term, saying they believe that the Republican candidate's positions are a better choice for the high-technology industry." I was somewhat surprised by this.

 I emailed the Wall Street Journal editors last week about publishing XML/RSS/Atom feeds. Here is their response I received today: "We're in the process of designing an RSS news feed now and hope to launch it before too long. Unfortunately, I can't give you a more precise estimate on when it'll be available. I hope this helps. Thanks for taking the time to write."

 "Why are more and more people getting their news from amateur websites called blogs? Because they're fast, funny and totally biased."



 "Dan Rather and Tom Brokaw have wondered aloud whether the media has overdone its Ronald Reagan (news) coverage. They needn't worry, because if the Internet is an accurate guide for what's on the minds of Americans -- and studies indicate that it is -- then the public in big numbers is craving news about the recently deceased former president."

 "Roll out the red carpet; somebody will definitely be thanking the Academy. See how ASP .NET provides starter kits, opportunities for free web hosting, FTP support and more." If you want to learn a little about Visual Studio 2003 web development, this is a great place to see some quick demos.

 "At some point, and possibly very soon with OS X 10.4, Internet Explorer will disappear from retail copies of OS X, from the desktops of new hardware, and from online software download sites. The result? A generational line will appear between those Mac users who have IE, and those who do not, and new Mac users will have to scramble to find and old copy of IE just to write an electronic check." That's the price you pay for owning a computer with less than 3% market share. One of the many reasons I keep myself from purchasing a Mac, although I would love to have one. They just aren't practical.

 "The boys are back!!!! The first songs performed with Sammy Hagar in 8 long years! ENJOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Credit to Anubis at VHLinks for the "tweaked" version of Up For Breakfast." Fair warning, you may be disappointed. Maybe they will grow on me.

 "Recession is when your neighbor loses his job. Depression is when you lose yours. And recovery is when Jimmy Carter loses his." Read urlLink more...

 "Californians converged by the tens of thousands to pay their respects to former President Reagan, choking freeway traffic, shuffling in lines for hours and forcing surprised organizers to extend Tuesday's viewing period." If there was ever a doubt for the love of this president.

 urlLink "Essentially, AirTunes is a method of creating remote speakers for a copy of iTunes, and sending data to those remote speakers via a wireless network." Although this probably is a good idea for most, it's worthless for me as I no longer have a seperate "stereo system". My main desktop computer and it's attached speakers (dare I say digital hub) are now my main "stereo system".

 "there is a both a great need and a great opportunity for visual designers in the Linux desktop world. The Gnome and KDE desktop environments are themeable, and have plenty of themes available. However, like with Firefox, its the default theme that matters to me, and to the majority of people using the software." Do they ever. What is ironic to me is the tools a designer would use to help enhance the UI of Linux would no doubt come from a competing platform.

 "Dan Cederholm is an award-winning web designer and author living in Salem, Massachusetts. As principal of SimpleBits, Dan's design and development consulting firm, he brings years of experience in designing and building sites with web standards. Dan is well known for his redesigns of Fast Company and Inc.com using standards-compliant methods, while pushing the limits of CSS." This particular "Blogger template" I am using temporarily was designed by Dan.

 "This kind of baloney underscores how important secrecy and surprise are to Apple, which relies on periodic PR drama to keep its salivating fans chanting and fist-pumping during Jobs keynote events. After all, how could Steve Jobs bask in the glow of a friendly crowd if they had all heard what was coming already? But Apple's attempts to control every little bit of information about forthcoming products stands in sharp contrast to the consumer friendly image it tries to portray publicly."

 "But usually I am the kind of person who looks to the future. In the last few months Microsoft has made a couple of very significant announcements with possibly quite negative implications for the future of a standards-based web - which has me thinking about that future, and wondering whether there even is such a future."

 "Rebecca Norlander gives us a thorough demo of Windows XP Service Pack 2. Takes about 10 minutes. There's a lot in SP2, and this will get you up to date. New wireless features. Tons of security updates and enhancements. And more." Great demo of upcoming service pack 2 for XP

 "Bradbury added, " [Moore] is a horrible human being. Horrible human! " When asked if he agreed with Moore's political positions, Bradbury replied, "That has nothing to do with it. He copied my title; that is what happened. That has nothing to do with my political opinions." According to the Swedish daily, Bradbury said he had tried to discuss the issue with Moore several months ago, but that the director avoided him, the site reported." He is a very large, horrible human being.

 "In a clear sign of improved business confidence in the economy and its prospects, the Labor Department said this morning that employers added nearly a quarter million jobs to their payrolls in May. As significant, the government said that hiring in March and April was more robust than previously reported." Even the New York Times is reporting positive news about the economy.

 "In January, Paul Haigh downloaded Google's toolbar to dispel annoying pop-up ads. By March, they were back." I have noticed some pop-ups getting around Google's pop-up blocker.

 "Employers added 248,000 jobs, making three-month gain best in 4 years; jobless rate steady at 5.6%."

 "May's employment report seems certain to bring more good news of solid hiring -- news that may well spur the Fed to begin raising rates" Of course, Bush will get no credit for job growth.

 "Microsoft's Longhorn will introduce XAML, an application development framework for Web and Windows apps. But just how different is XAML from the already-available public standards set by the W3C?"

 "According to the Seattle Times, urlLink this article is about "A former Microsoftie says addiction to Windows revenue, mediocre products, and missed opportunities could doom Seattles most successful company." It sounds interesting, but the author gets so much so wrong." You gotta love Paul's straight-forward repsonses.

 "The Redmond strategy is scale. Standardize the software. Sign on licensees. Get the RIAA on board (after all, they need all the friends they can get). Ink contracts with the record companies promising Janus DRM and the widest deployment of players in the world. The industry buys this. ... Microsoft will provide it. We will shun it, scorn it, diss it. But it will succeed. Ultimately." This article is right on in my opinion. Too bad other Macintosh zealots nor Steve Jobs get it. You would think they would learn from Apple's past mistakes. I guess that is what you get from a control freak.

 "XML is well-suited to GUI development. With an appropriate set of primitives, it can provide the familiar feel of a markup language while enabling the broad range of capabilities required for application development. Its declarative approach removes a lot of unnecessary procedural code. It simplifies the programmer's task of creating the initial structure of an application, facilitating prototyping and flexible design. Declarative programming is effective for frequently used elements and patterns, and can be combined with scripting to allow procedural code for specific tasks." "Decalrative UIs" are the future of rich web applications.

 "Originally scheduled to be a minor upgrade to Windows Media Player 9 Series, Crescent has grown in scope. Now dubbed Windows Media Player 10, the software is a major release that addresses three major concerns. First is a refinement of the user interface to make it more streamlined and refined. The taskbar has been moved to a top-mounted row of clearly labeled, task-based navigation bar buttons ("Now Playing," "Library," "Rip," "Burn," "Sync," and "Guide")." A third party view on the update. I have installed it and I do like the simpler interface, but unfortunately there is no new Napster plug-in yet for it. Looking forward to seeing the new Napster integration. Update: The current Napster plug-in for WMP 10 pretty much sucks. It seems like it wants to use the WMP 10 library instead of it's own (like previous versions), but the integration doesn't seem to be completely finished. I'll reserve judgement until the final plug-in is released later this year, but as it stands now, I'll stick with the previous integration.

 "Windows Media Player 10 is being refined to provide a great experience for discovering, playing, and taking your digital media anywhere. We are still in the early stages, but this technical beta lays the groundwork for the great end-to-end digital media experience coming with the final release for Windows XP."

 "The subscription model may get even more appealing if Microsoft Corp. succeeds with its new "portable subscriptions." Later this summer, the software giant is debuting new software, code-named Janus, that lets subscribers listen to rented music on portable players that use its Windows Media software. While Jobs and many others have doubted that the record labels would ever support this approach, Gorog says Roxio has signed deals with the five big labels. Janus "has the potential of cannibalizing download sales," says a top record exec. Jobs needs to swallow his pride and get in the subscription game so his old nemesis doesn't gain any advantage -- again." I personally think subscriptions are the way to go. I have been an iTunes/iPod user for several months now, and I have learned I would rather "download at will", rather than to debate with myself on every single song I like. It's really quite frustrating, having to consicously say to myself "do a like this enough to buy it, or should I just listen to it on Napster for free?" When "Janis" comes out, I will be all over it!

 "Web usability is about creating your Website in such a way that your site users can find what they're looking for quickly and efficiently." Nobody's perfect.

 "Just got a scoop from one of our reliable sources that Dell is planning to have their first Tablet PC out before the end of the year (probably October) and that itll have a be a convertible-style model with a 12.1-inch screen (basically a laptop with a screen that swivels around and folds down), run on the 2005 version of the Tablet PC operating system, and possibly weigh under four pounds." Looking forward to seeinn what they come up with, but more specifcally the price. Afterall, that's what they are best at in the pc market.

 urlLink This is pretty funny regardless of who you are going to vote for in November.

 "Too many designers advocate the application of standards over the use of sensible design practice. Christian argues the case for a flexible approach to the appropriate use of standards in today's sites." I believe highly in using web standards, but I am not dogmatic about them.

 "Bad design is based on the arrogant and extremely difficult attempts to modify user behavior. Good design derives innovation from existing user behavior." Go with the "users flow", not against it.

 "Good design is problem solving and should always be presented as such. Whenever a designer (be it an interaction designer, an information designer, or a visual designer) presents a client with too many options they risk undermining their value and opening themselves up to design by committee. The message is I dont know enough about your users or goals so you pick what works best. Now the design is in a non-designers hands .... every interface designer should focus on building a reputation as a problem solver and communicating that through the language of design and business. The design medium will change, the need to solve problems will not. " I couldn't agree more.

 "Screenwriter John Brancato told SCI FI Wire that he and partner Michael Ferris have turned in a draft of a script for a proposed fourth Terminator movieone that works around the expected absence of previous Terminator star Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is now the governor of California." This would be interesting!

 "Democratic candidate John Kerry, whose campaign demanded to know on Wednesday whether President Bush read a key Iraq intelligence assessment, did not read the document himself before voting to give Bush the authority to go to war, aides acknowledged." Unbelievable...

 "Until Microsoft proves it can fix IE's security bugs, you're better off using one of a few good alternatives as much as possible." I have finally switched to urlLink Firefox for the time being, not so much for security concerns, but for the additional functionality it offers. The " urlLink Bookmarks Synchronizer " I find incredibly useful.

 "At last -- all of this year's Star Wars Fan Film Awards finalists are in! Now the fate of this generation of Jedi filmmakers is in your hands." There are way to many geeks out there.

 "Here we attempt to bring to light those "other" facts about Michael Moore's new film "Fahrenheit 9/11". We try not to make this an opinion blog- it is a fact one. We make sure to source every post, and will either cite or link to the source of the provided fact. It is our desire to see a well-armed populous that is ready to evaluate the film from an informed perspective." Just the facts mam ... no opinion.

 "Think large screens. Multiple screens. There you'll meet Patrick Baudisch, researcher, who'll show you through the lab and give you some cool software that is designed to help with large and multiple monitors." This a very interesting look at some of the cool UI enhancements under development within Microsoft research.
