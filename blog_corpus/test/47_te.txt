 right I have thought this through before i type it and here are my views; When i have a break from school, I tend not to follow the news because it ususally ends up depressing me, and also I'm not usually here to see it. Ask me on again about any news story and I will be happy to talk, in the mean time just bug off. That is if your going to ask me about the news. I have also decided that Champain is yucky, and insted of having that at my wedding, WHEN i get married, I'll have Ribena, or orange squash. A little thing to think about; why when u visit a friends shud u take ur own cup, and always make your own drink? All will be reavelled on monday! (I learnt this off a television programe, and no it was not Look around u!) Toodles xx

 Hmm... cloaning. Is it right to cloan some one? Technically they would be exactly the same as the person, but they might develop differently. Imagine growing up with people expecting you to be like some one, some one that you can't be. What if some one died and then a baby was cloaned from their genes. Imagine knowing that you are purely alive because of the person you got the genes off. Cloaning is a way of being 'god' and I'm not sure I agree with it. A baby who has the original genes of a sixty year old will infact have the frailty of their bones, is it fair to do that to some one? Hmm.

 Ahh I feel so peaceful. I got really upset last night because of ...stuff. But then I started writing poems, it's my way of venting stuff and feeling better! And hell it worked! Even if they are crap I don't really give a damn!

 I. Am. Free.

 urlLink http://uk.news.yahoo.com/030103/80/dhsnd.html Wow, that's gotta be a whole new way to transport drugs. And what exactly were they gonna do with the fried chicken? Re-heat it and gather around the cooker? I'm still waiting for a house full of pot to burn down. *imagines the stoned firemen with hoses*

 Mmm... I've been eating chocolate cookies! I did have two, then I completely spaced out and there was only one! I can't believe I forgot I ate one! Geez, I must really be getting fat! I'm actually very proud of myself, being a true slob I woke up at 12:00 today! I almost got up at 7, but my body wouldn't let me so I went back to sleep! Wow, maybe me and Laura can appear on 'Fat Club' now! *Or some thing like that, hey I don't watch that type of tv! I don't wanna be anorexic! And I would be if I started to watch it!*

 We all have perceptions of things, we assume too much. If some one says some thing, then we assume that they mean it *and that I can spell assume* We expect oxygen to be in the air tomorrow, we take it for granted that the world will be there tomorrow. We expect this web page to be here tomorrow, maybe we're assume, expecting whatever too much. Haven't you ever had it where some thing isn't there and you just accept that it's gone with a slight shock. We need to stop assuming things, if you take things for granted then you don't truely appreciate every thing around you. Life, how easily that can be taken for granted. What if it was taken away suddenly? I just think it's amazing to think that we're alive, we're on a planet and we're eating the world's food supply, that if equally shared out could fead the whole world. Open your eyes and unlock your brain.

 I just feel content, No reason to care, Nothing to worry about. I am happy knowing, That people care, People worry, For me instead. Me Damn, definatly needing to get out more. Actually, I think some sane people might arrest me if I do!

 Ahh feeling... relaxed and smug. For some reason my english teacher says that smug is bad. Eugh no, lets not go down that road and turn left because it'll probably get me crawling over a dictionary checking the meaning of things. I hate that in english tests "Why does this make the story seem scary and horrific" Umm... well what do you mean by scary and horrific? Wow, completely changing the subject! And needing a new pargraph badly. Wow, Lemon Jeeeely! (Or Lemon Jelly for all you normal people) Thank you dadorail for telling me about them! I heard this cool song where all it says is "All the ducks are swimming in the water" in Forbidden Plannet and they wrote it! So what, do I care if every one knows this already and they're number one? NO! Some one should make a "Freak persons chart" much better than the normal one! (Mmm... the men in white coats will be coming soon) Good good.

 I love number 6) thats fabaty fab! Ahhhhhh i'm very upset, no one has foned me, so as promised i am crying.:( I have really got nothing to say apart from that i think u r all ignoring me, and if u r plz b decent and tell me wot i have dun! Toodles xx

 Oh dear, I've done mellowed-happy. *gone* Ahh... so relaxed...

 HAPPY OLD DAY! for all you backwards people out there!

 Heeey! We wish you a meery chrimbo, we weesh you a meri chrismas! *too much monty python* Oh yeah... HAPPY NEW DAY! Wait a sec... HAPPY NEW YEAR! WOOHOOO! Ok, so 2003! Yeah! Soon we'll build floating cities! *according to all the comic drawers of the 70's, I can't wait!* My New Years resolutions: 1. Stop smoking. (I haven't started so it shouldn't be too hard) 2. No drugs. (Don't do drugs!) 3. No getting drunk. (I don't drink!) Well, that was fun and educational! (Not really) Sorry, hyperness kicked in right now, I had Izzy over *shiver* and we stayed up till four, watching tv and playing games! She wouldn't play checkers at two in the morning! *sob sob* Oh, my brother and his friends came in at half two, he was pissed and one of his friends were really polite, that's all I remeber. *remember* Hmm... do I? Oh yeah, we went all out monty *how the hell do you spell it?* python *ditto* and the holy grail *err i'm not gonna even ask* watching! The Knights who say Ni! Oh, they're sooo cool! On the dvd version, it's got the Knights of Camelot Lego style! It's sooo cool! We have to make every one watch it! Ok... running out of energy and general things to say... bi!

 Well hello there!! I finished my DofE walk yesterday, and now my legs are v. stiff! Hoo hum pigs bum, do i care? NO!! I have just spent the afternoon at Sniz's and we wrote a song. It's fab!! It's all about Sparrows!! Don't even ask! I'm sat here reading how to have a good argument, and finding out all about Basingstoke Canal. Fun fun fun! xx

 Hey, sorry I've not been going on this. Not that much to type about, you know. And I'm sure you love being bored. Ahh.. but yes, my head there's so much in there, but if I started telling you about that I'd probably have the men in white coats coming to take me away. Last time they did that, they took the lucozade off me. :( Actually! I have lucozade! Yeay! Sorry, I'm content at the moment, I just read a relaxing manga :) I just care about being relaxed don't I? The one thing that is hardest for me to be! *geez, I am relaxed, I can't word things very well!* Hmm it's interesting to be in this mood, to see where you mind wonders when you're not driven by emotion. Seeing as I'm listening to the weird music that is the start of fushigi yuugi, I'm scared by my brain. Hmm... guess it's a good thing that I don't get to explore it today - I've got things to do. *shock* Hey, don't go all out, I'm just gonna wrap some presents up and go 'HOLY SHIP!' because I'll realise I've got billions of pieces of homework. Isn't life fun?

 urlLink http://www.fictionpress.net/read.php?storyid=1187479 Damn I'm good. (Quick some one get a pin and pop her ego!) Uh... sorry about that sudden burst of... egoness? Now what's that clever word that I should -but don't- know? Lo siento, guess I'm going mad! When I was younger, Heaven was so weird to me. Surely it must be full by now, Will there be room for me? Who gets to decide who goes to hell? Will I go there instead? So it's the creator that destroys what he created, Surely no one should have that power. But then he is god. Now I am older, And heaven doesn't seem so weird to me. Because I have found it, Here on Earth. And I think I'll stay instead. Yes... mad. I've got kind of stuck on this song by S.E.S called Dreams Come True, but hell it's in Japanese and I can't find it any where! :'(

 I'm back my english C/W still aint finished, but its nearer to being done than it was this morning. I have one poem left to write about. *Achew* I still have my cold. I have now taken some cough stuff to try and make me better. I hate taking medicine. MY NOSE I SORE!! :( *cough cough**sniff* anyway. yesterday was fun!! poor Nohj! The only guy there again. O well, my mum felt v. sorry 4 him! xx

 Take the urlLink "Which Flower are you?" quiz by urlLink Hazel See! That's why no one likes me! *insert manical laugh* Ok. HAAHHAMUHAHHAMAUMAUMAHHAHAHA! *thank you, please come again*

 *ahem* I'm back! Soooory! urlLink http://www.ebay.co.uk took me, and chained me to my computer! :D Not that I was complaining... sorry guys! urlLink http://www.xe.com/ Wow! I found a currency convertor! Finally, I actually know how much things cost! Ahh. Oh yeah, I'm ill today, that's why I'm not at school. I actually had some damn freaky dreams! One was where my mum died, and I was gonna see this lady he liked... apart from I was in the PE changing rooms after we had had PE and suddenly Mango appeared, so I ran down to the gate and threw him out. Loads of guys were there, and they were saying 'did you see those two things' and some one said 'one of them you might have seen, one of them you shouldn't have seen' or some thing like that, then one of them said 'one of them was a skull and wearing a tutu'. So Death of Rats and Death were in my dream! *Read Thief of Time to get it* C'est tres bizarre! Mmm... other freaky stuff happened but I forgot it. Oh, I also dreamt some one poked me in the head and it woke me up. (Weird huh?) Definatly ill, I always get freak dreams when I'm ill! Ahh I better go do some thing ...useful because it's becoming hard to type and spell *must be illness kicking in* or it's just me... Hmm... definatly me.

 I think I'm gonna cry! My FFX cd's gone wazzoka and won't show the FMV's at the end!!! Noooo!

 Whats the point in war?? You kill innocent people, u learn how to hate and not love. thats my thing 4 day. I would just like 2 say 2 u Kes big up darling! You have done something that i could never do. :) xx

 urlLink http://www.engrish.com/ Wow. What a weird site! It's erm... freaky...? Go see if you haven't already closed this window because of the pink! ^-~ Hey! What can I say! They won't let me change it! (Izzy would throw a strop if I changed it!)

 Well happy valentines day. I love you all, no really I do. U all did really well in the play! so there u go! xx

 YEAY! It's Valentine's Day! Wohooo! Give it up for all the broken hearts out there! Aww! My brother gave this girl a really long stemmed rose! Why can't the boys in our year be like that! (Freak. What are you saying?)

 Have you ever wondered why people are like that? Okay, so maybe I psychoanalyse *no, no, i'm not clever. i'm sure it's spelt wrong* people too much (or maybe it's because I'm listening to Goo Goo Dolls) Hmm. Why do people ignore you? Why do you ignore them? Maybe you're ignoring the fact that you don't or do like them or some thing. (I'm sure there's too many inuendo's to list in that!) Why do some people go out of their way to make your world worse, why do they go out of their way to make it better? But then, if you analyse things too much then you don't live, you watch. It's hard.

 Why did you explode like that? Everyone's staring at you now. Wondering why you're so impulsive, Why you don't think.

 Well I have one heck of a head ache!! I have been watching netball all day. It was fun, my backside! I didnt get through to regional though. Yippeeeee!! im sat here eating iced gems with my sister! why are you feeling sad Kes?? Do I need to be concerned?? :S xx

 Hey! If you feel sad, download Earth Wind and Fire - Lets Groove. It's stupidly funny! AAARGH! I'm actually listening to it! EEEEK! Aaaahhh. Manu Chao.... much better!

 Life isn't fair, Justice isn't just. This is the life we lead, The one we hate so much.

 AHHHHHHHHHH!! I have to leave my house at 07:30 2 moz, and i aint best pleased! O well I will b able to meet up wit me mates. Hey rite i had better go now. Speek soon!! xx

 You leave every one broken, You shattered our stone. We were the statues, You played with alone. You twisted our bodies, You broke our bones. We were your friends, You chatted about. We were the enemy, You shouted about. You spread your lies, As thin as silk, So we would never know, Who you were. Who are you?

 You're bubbly! Life doesn't get you down, or if it does, not for long! If your friends need cheering up, you're right there for them! urlLink A different quiz, what strange type of person are you? brought to you by urlLink Quizilla Wow! I'm a freak in a bubble!

MORE THAN THIS ONE! :O Cue *yes, I learnt how to spell* massive applause followed by enormously big laminated cheques being thrown at us *boing* Damn! I said laminated not rubbernated! *spoke too soon about the spelling!*

 ooo helooo!

 wow im drinking ribena out of a pint glass. mainly because it was the only glass left in the cupboard but it's fun you should try it sometime. wow how weird am i. earlier i was trying (and failing) to do my maths homework when i decided i wanted to colour my hand in blue sparkly pen. i did one whole index finger and then decided it was a stupid idea. i tried to wash it off but my finger is kind of tainted slightly blue. well it's a look i suppose. i dont want to be depressed i want a blue hand! and hey who was telling you to shut up? whoever it was willies to them. WILLIES TO THEM ALL! willies especially to mr.thackray who failed to mention that we have a maths challenge tommorrow. how shite is that? willies willies willies. merde.merde.merde. shizercroft. okay i dont know how to spell shizercroft so im just gonna guess! wow dado rail what an damn cool name. well ill be off now. before i freak you out any more.

 Every one has different priorities. Randomness! Every thing is simple, we make it difficult. Or at least I do. Take this for example, walking past a door. Normal people just walk past it, I however have to trip on the mat and throw myself at the wall or hit the door frame. Or maybe it's just me... Do you really think that every thing changes? That scares me! Change always does, I think that's more scary than the thought of change scaring me, the fact that it does. All the major changes in my life haven't been the best ones. I figured that if I stayed the same, no one would notice me and they would have no reason to pick on me or any thing. If you become the backround then no one will see you. Sadly that doesn't work. Bugger, aye? Some people pick you out of the backround for no reason and turn you into the foreground, because they're actually cowards who are trying to cover up the fact that they're cowards. People always try to cover up their insecurities by pointing them out on other people, maybe it's like a cry for help or some thing. This was from ages ago but my computer wouldn't work! But it's better now... Yeay! *read next blog for uninteresting info on it*

 YEAY! I'm back on this! Thank you Dado Rail! (Yes, I have real... internet friends... shut up!) For helping *cough telling me what to do cough* me fix it! Yeay! MUHAHA! I can annoy you all! :P Hey, I DON'T DO VIRUSES! Hallelujiah! Hmm... hallelujia! halelujia? hajellila? Hmm... let me go consult Microsoft Word... Aha! Wow... Microsoft is kind of good for some thing! If only it could do my homework! Hallelujah (It should have an i in it...) Definatly! Nih! Sorry, too much Monty Python! Mmm... every one went too serious today. Maybe too much for me, seeing as every one was telling me to shut up all the time! Ahh heck, who wants to be depressed? I better go... chop potatoes and stuff... Wohooo! Yeah, that's my hobby... chopping potatoes... Imagine doing a piece of French Coursework on that! Ok, so biiiii!

 OOO I'm talking 2 my mate from Cheltnam, she is MAD!!! O well. I can't believe I left my trainers in Kes's car thismorning! O well I survived. SHE SAID YES!!!! I just caught the end of it and was like rrrrrrrr. xx

 hmmm, dammit i have a chemistry test tommorrow. soooo gonna fail. but never mind as long as ive tried thats good enough for me. its looking tres glooooooomy outside but c'est la vie tommorrow the sun will shine. seriously running low on va va voom though. and tommorrows monday. merde. merde, merde and merde. ahhh got that strangely cheerful monday, monday song in my head. ahhh get out get out! what are the guys inside my head trying to do to me!

 do you know that one of the biggest beliefs in buddhism is impermanence. nothing is permanent. everything will change and the more you learn to accept that the happier you will be. that makes a lot of sense, not saying im ready to become a fully-fledged buddhist or anything but a lot of buddhist beliefs make a lot of sense. dukkha is suffering and it is said that people suffer because they don't understand that things constantly change. i think it's true that people can change but the trouble is people like rosie + others dont think about that they should change they just think about not wanting to. maybe that does'nt make a whole lot of sense to people outside my head, but oh well.

 OOOO RRRRR you what???? O well, I can't write because my dad is having a go at me for being more interested in this than my course work that I have spent the last week on. personally I think this is sooooo much more interesting than a load of junk written by me about Romeo and Juliet. xx

 Views are opinions. Different opinions make views.

 Boo! I am here wit Laura H!! She says that Izzy should tell her when she aint walking home from school. Why is nothing simple anymore???? Its a bit of a retorricle question so dont even try to answer it Kes. O yeah the toodles thing is mine but you may have it if you wish! :) xx

 Just lost my last post, sorry. Maybe it was for the best.

 Spontaneous poetry! (+ bad spelling! Sooory!)

 I look to the clouds for answers, To questions I don't even know. My feet keep walking, On their own down this road. I keep my head up, Staring at the sky. All the time wondering, Why. I don't want to see, What's ahead or around. All I want to see, Are the pure white clouds.

 Eek. Sorry I've been ignoring this. I've had mocks all week - stupidity all around, and I've been affected. To tell you the truth, I'd rather be alone than in a crowd. Weird huh? Sad, yup. I was thinking about that... seriously shouldn't be musing about that on this now should I? But it's good to think... in your head at least. Some people don't like to hear thoughts, but it's good to share them. What would happen if we didn't? Hitler? Hmm... see what happens when I think? Well... eugh, let's talk about test. (Fun...) Yeesh, can't believe I'm doing the mocks of the mocks! What's up with this world? (Under pressure... dum de di dum dum) Umm... yeah... guess I've have gone a bit crazy under the pressure. I'm also a bit annoyed that they didn't put cool stuff on the tv! It's all been crap! (During the day I mean, normal school hours) The tests were stupid though, every one finishes about half an hour early, but they can't let us go! Eugh, I've had enough, any way I've only got three left - Biology, Maths and Music! (Aaargh! Music's too hard!) *pull yourself together!* Really need to get out more!

 Well we have all been busy blogging this week haven't we?? Exams are so not fun! I have gone mad and people think i have been hitting the booze, which may i make absolutly clear is not true!!! xx

 My Lovely Horse My lovely horse running through the field, Where are you going, with your fetlocks blowing in the wind, I want to shower you with sugar lumps, and ride you over fences, I want to polish your hooves every single day and take you to the horse dentist. My lovely horse your a pony no more. Running around with a man on your back, Like a train in the night. i though that people may need a little light relief so i found the words 2 my lovely horse, u no how it goes people sing a long!! xx

 Well hello my happy little bunnies!! I hate revision. I have made an amazing revision planner thingy!! It basically means that i revise for 1/2 hour do nothing for 1/2 hour. I now do it every hour under the sun! It's terrible, apart from today though I have only done 1 hour today, and nothing yesterday, I have promised on this computer and hereby in writting that I WILL start tomorrow! Are you going to the thing @ the Grove next week end, Saturday 14:00 @ the Grove to mess around, leave whenever??? xx

 Yeay! Space Ghost... better go check right spelling *smacks self over forehead... is really happy that she could change the spelling of smack back there...* Space Ghost Coast to Coast! I love that programme! Or... used to! It was on really late on Cartoon Network (don't ask why I watch it late...) and it was sooo random! Finally! A website that's ...kind of about it! Yeay! We can all sleep happily tonight! (Every one else is already...) Right.. geez I better hit the sack! (Love that!) I'm scary at night... better go guys! urlLink http://justapplechance.com/sgdrinking/ Ohh... I also just finished watching Endless Waltz after downloading it. (It's GW) Tis v good! If you've watched the series though!

 Hey. So woo. Tests. Not only tests, but study leave. Hmm... study leave to do tests in? Weird. Sorry... just find it weird. Either that or I'm tired... *zzzz* Yup, tired. I was the living dead in school today, mixture of stress, lack of sleep and protesting (it takes up a lot of energy!) Yeah! Hey! I'm a celebrity! I was on GWRfm! I hope they put my point across ok... and didn't make me sound ba (I probably did that any way) Who needs editing when I can muck up for you! (...) But it was fun and we got our point out, we were heard! (In the wrong light in some cases) But we spoke louder than the politicians. (I think we did!) Well... I'm really bored... there's nothing to do! I'll have to arrange all this stuff to do next week, but I'd rather just laze around. Oh, feel free to come to my house *people that I know* and do... whatever. Just don't paint it green... I hate green. Oh, and I'm broke! Fun! Oh geez... depressing music, well I'm kind of down and I don't know why... *sniff sniff* It all starte- *We don't want to know about your twisted life* Oh right... stick to the non-existant point, got it. Mmm... well better go talk protesting with my brother. Remember - No one's life is worth it

 Anti-war protesters in Bristol! Yeah! And I was one of them! Yes, I'm a student. And I wan't to tell you. We weren't truenting - we were voicing our opinions and protesting. I was proud to be one of the many. And I am proud to have made a difference. I would rather have not protested, but the war started so we stopped. If George Bush is so high and mighty then why is he supporting the innocent murders of Palestinians by Isrealies? Surely they are terrorising people. That man has double standards. Go support our cause, and find out more if you are a student. urlLink http://www.studentstopwar.org.uk/index.php FLY MY PRETTIES INTO THE NIGHT! Yeah... getting a bit serious, I always use 'humour' when things get serious. Some situations shouldn't get too depressing. You always need a spark of the alternate emotion to bring you back to Earth.

 uhhhhhhhh i'm tired, big up 2 my gals!!! Love and peace xx

 ANTI-WAR PRO-LIFE ANY IDIOT CAN START A WAR AN IDIOT HAS

 Hey! How is every one! Still listening to S.E.S.... damn song in my head! But oooh! Found the funniest game in the whole world! urlLink http://www.wedu.com/sledrun/tobogganrun.php Toboggan jump! Yeah! Just the kind of stuff we need, being near test time and all. It's so fun! Oh, I'm reading MARS at the moment, just incase you were wondering. (I've gone mad!) urlLink http://www.fetchfido.co.uk/games/menu/games_menu.htm That place has some of the weirdest games! WOW! A flea circus!

 War teaches you how to hate and not how to decide things. A little bit of philosophy for you there. I'm sorry i am not allowed to walk out, dont know why but all i know is that I aint happy about it. Im getting really sick of people saying what difference will it make. for all they know it could be the thing that finally pushes good old Tony over the edge! You dont know untill you try. xx

 Hey. Anti-war, non-eating-non-fair-trade slightly-hippy person here. So, what are you doing about the war? We're gonna walk out of school and protest in Bristol! YEAY! Well, I think some people got it wrong, they were walking into school when I walked out (at the end of school, not an actual protest thingy) Hmm... Yeah! WALK IN! Woohoo! (I some how don't think that it's gonna catch on guys!) Mmm... Also we're gonna protest in the middle of our school during school time! YEAHHH! (Look out for me, future world wide human rights activist) Yeah right, probably in some crummy factory job or some thing... any way! Aaargh! I'm getting really annoyed by people who 'don't care' about the war, or think that 'nothing we can do can change the situation'. Yeah. Tried that already in France. Remeber Le Pen? He would have become the next racist leader if the people had not come out in force and stopped him (the fact that their current president is actually corrupt doesn't really matter...) Mmm... Well. I'm changing what I want to change. I'm not eating any chocolate, apart from fair trade chocolate. Mad? Nope. I just believe in ethics, and I want to feel good in my heart as well as my stoumach, don't worry, I'll still eat as much! (When this damn lent thing is over!) It's good to do lent though, it makes you think about things. (Don't ask how, haven't got there yet) Hey I better go. Adios.

 Uhhhhhhhhhhhh. I have just spent the last hour+ sorting out a map thingy 4 our DofE presentation. I have bee lining them up delating them etc. xx

 Stuff??? That sounds dodgy!! O well. I'm sat here with my computer, and suprisingly im doing some typing!! No really! I have not given up the choccie as i am sat here now scoffing it!! Yummy! I am feeling really strange, rite must dash and check up on nan and sis. xx

 Hey. I'm not at school today. Let's call it a head thing. And leave it at that. Mmm... no more chocolate for fourty days and fourty nights! Oh well, doesn't seem that hard to me now, seeing as coco bean people are being ripped off, and I'm anti-Nestle, not much chocolate that I want to eat! Fun! I better go do stuff, sorry!

 AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! CHOCOLATE I may give it up after all!! thats all I have to say, o and can any1 fix cameras?? xx

 Some people are just cruel. For no reason. And some people like those people? Why? Because they're pretty. Because they laugh when they're required to. Because they don't give a shit. Should we really respect these people, just because they are 'pretty'? And what effort do they put into looking 'pretty'? Should we respect them for that? And when they pick on people who work so hard to do well, should we laugh? If we laugh then we just fuel their idea that they are doing well. The 'pretty' people I've so far met are mostly stuck up whores, but that's only the people that I've met. Oh, when I mean 'pretty' I mean down right ugly, but some people like that sort of thing. Have a nice day thinking. Hate mail welcome. ;P

 Hi. Welcome to anti-Racist-Bastards home. Other wise known as anti-British-National-an-all-that-shit-party-website. Geez, isn't that a mouthful? Mmm. Well, to all the racist bastards = move . To all the subjects of their racial hatred = don't listen to them! Well, yeah, I am pretty crap at making a point!

 Geez, this play list at the moment is gonna melt my brain if I listen to it any more. *i'm weird* Some times you have to be happy with what you got. Ahh, then there's greed. Why must their always be greed? To keep us alive I guess, if we always have some thing to aim for, some thing to look forward to, then we will keep going. If you get nothing out of some thing then you probably won't do it. *probably? aahhh!* Doesn't life make sense when I explain it? *no*

 Ahh! it's YOU! (AHH! IT'S ME!) Ha, confusion, confusion! Mmm... any way, I'm back from Harrogate! *yeay!* And I don't even know if that's spelt right! *yeay!* Ditto for that! Woohooo! Oh, I was measured for the dress! Yeah! Woohoo! Well I'm tired, and heh, this has taken a long time to type! *i'm busy* so I better be off bisi!

 Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr! I cant fone u in 1/2 an hour Laura because I'm not allowed 2 use the fone. ??????? Random thing there soz. Gliding was a good laf! xx

 Hummmmmmmmmmmmmm..........................I'm going gliding tomoz and i'm soooooooo scared!! :O I have never been off the ground before! :S O well. xx

 Deaf of the screaming, Blind of the sights. Senseless to guide, Into the night. Numb from the cold, Scarred from the pain. Shielding the others, I'd do it again. Looking out the window, Into the sky. Waving at death's wagons, That fly easily by. Cursing the men, That sit in the seats. Wondering if, I will be kissing their feet. With death they come, With god they will leave. They are more powerful, The can do as they please. God can't you hear me? Screaming for help. With my burned out throat, And my burned out core. God can't you hear me? I can't take this any more! I'm staring at you. Safe in the sky. Oh how much I want to, Take off and fly. The bombing won't stop, The dying won't stop. What did we do to deserve this? Deaf of the screaming, Blind of the sights. Senseless to guide, Into the night. Why try to live, When I will die. Fearless I step, Into the sky. Dead already, Wasn't that lucky? I didn't suffer, I wanted to die.

 Hmm... geez it's too dark in here! I hate it being dark! *not that I'm afraid of the dark* Nahh... that was when I was younger. And for the record! ...I was more afraid of the toilet monster. :| Go figure. Woohooo psychological jargon! (Most of it is!) If you study something too much then you may miss the real meaning. (That's what I keep telling myself!) But seriously, if everyone studied stuff too much no one would live! On that minute point *seriously minute* what do you do when you do nothing? You know... when you're really trying to think about nothing. I play piano in the air. Hell, at least I'm not thinking about actual stuff! It's bad to do that! Well sometimes. When you get all caught up in it, and you forget the breathe then it's bad! *geez it's hard remembering how to spell breath and breathe!* Well I guess someone had to say it! (And it had to be me *sigh*) Any way... I'm ill and tired. Night night.

 Hisi. *disinfects area* I'm ill! Yeayyyy! Isn't having a heavy head fun? *thud* Ok... too heavy. Well, it isn't really! We haven't got any chocolate in our house! What good is staying in your house if you have no chocolate! Also my dad kind of isn't talking to me *he's ill too* I 'threw' *dropped* the remote and he had a major go at me. Apparantly I'm a good outlet for anger and sicky stress. Oooh fun. *thud* Really gotta do something about my head! Mmm... I think I'm gonna have to kick some virtual butt on Little Fighter 2! (Soooo boooorreeed!) Ahh! Yeay! I can watch Neighbours twise! (Oh dear GOD!) *zzz*

 When I say I don't care I do. Some times when I say I do I don't. Double meanings. HOW DAMN COMFUSING DOES THIS WORLD HAVE TO BE!!!! (Very) Why? For blogger obviously! It's the only thinking keeping me sane! (Hehe, probably making you madder but hell, some one's gotta have the excess madness!) Hmm... just feel like going aaaaaahhhhh in school! (Don't worry, I'll probably do that tomorrow!)

 Heeey. I've decided. I need new knees and a new ear... hmm... might as well get rid of the whole head! Do you think I'd be able to get them on Ebay? Well... they've got virtually everything for sale! *clueless* Aaargh, my head hurts! Geez isn't it static? (When you're hair all goes paton) Mmm, I'm sure everyone understood that! Well, I'm back at school... and life's gonna start to drag again *sigh* why does it have to drag? (More like scrape) Why can't it roll or.. erm... slide? It just kind of gets to a point where it's like ...why bother? Well, I'm not quite sure what I'm going on about *side affects of head ache* So I better quit while I'm not there. Sorry... everything seems so pointless at the moment. :( Bleurgh, I hate feeling like this! I'm gonna go... go... sleep! Yeah! I feel like I'm going crazy, I don't breathe enough. And yet all the time, I think too much. Why is it that I think through life, And don't live it? I am walking through this life, Outside my body but inside my face. Living in fear, Of all my mistakes. Waiting for the past and the future, To colide into one. Waiting for them to crush me. Wondering what I have done.

 I know what you mean, it comes up all the time with me. Mayby we should write a stern letter to blogger asking them what they are playing at?! I read Barry Trotter, its well strange at the end. O well, I get back into England and its bloomin raining, flippin' typical!!! Kes do u think that anyone apart from us ever comes on this site?? xx

 Mmm... can any one tell me what the error is?

 Welcome the weather girl, so she can tell you about the wonderful rain I'm always under! Oh yeah... say a permenant goodbye to the archives. They're kind of missing... come here archives! Here archives! *dog calling style*

 Yeay! Just found out that one of my mum's friends has given birth to a baby boy! Yeay! (poor her, she doesn't know what she's gonna put herself through!) Just kidding... hehe. YEAAY!

 Ahh... I recon they should put slippery pears in the dictionary. What does that mean? Pears! Duh! Along with soluble fish... hmm... this would have to be a pretty dumb dictionary. *looks to you* Hey! You've got to be dumb if you've actually got this far in the blog! *EUGH* Soo any way *quickly changing the err unidentifiable subject into a even more unidentifiable subject* (EH?) Umm... flowers? Okay pretty bad but any way. I'm just sitting here waiting for my phone to ring... any second now... Don't you hate doing that? Knowing *slightly* that some one's gonna ring, but being unable to phone them. Wait a second. No. That's probably just me. I blog too much don't I? Mmm... way too many anti-climaxes today. (Piano pieces actually, there's this big build up a then a *twang* that's supposed to be the ending chord! What is with that?!) Argh I'm supposed to be writing one! I can't remember how fanfares go! *thump = head hitting table* God I'm gonna fail music! Oh yeah, I saw Johnny *can't spell* English yesterday, we were the oldest people -minus the kids- there! Never mind... Oh and it was incredibly stupid if you're into that type of thing. (And I am)

 Hmm... seems like johnny-come-lately is a actual word... weird huh? (What the hell does it mean?) urlLink http://dictionary.cambridge.org/wordoftheday.asp

 Audioslave - Like a Stone. It's good! ...Different. Hell, that's what I'm all about! Err... no one's seen a big purple book around here have they? I've lost my English book and I need to type up coursework! AARGH! Ahh don't worry... found it! It's Great Expectations coursework, kind of interesting actually. (Well it's better than history's - copy but rework homework) Erm... just remembered I haven't cleaned my teeth. (Crappy excuse to leave aye?) Better than Emma's 'baby sitting' one.

 Heeeysie. Hmm... kind of getting caught up in MARS at the moment (it's a shojo) Really upset at the lack of fan sites though! Aargh... I'm in my house... all alone... and scary moving people are outside the window! *smile and run* Nah it's ok really, my neighbours are moving. It's really tight on their kids, they were crying the other day :( poor kiddies. Must be really stressful. I don't really want to find out what it's like. Isn't it really weird to think that your parents, the people who have been together all your life could split up? That would really make me question the stability in relationships or some thing like that... But don't! Relationships are good... relationships are good.

 Ahhh... Our Lady Peace. Alright band actually. Listening to 4am. Stuck in weird short sentences *can't spell that damn it!* mood. Ahhh... so refreshing clearing out my spam e-mail, you wouldn't believe how unlucky I am! I delete every chain message thingy, cbb really. Yeesh, do I really give a damn about tax when I'm not even old enough to do anything about it? I don't want any INK THINGIES! (Really losing my grip on spelling! cartridges? *didn't wanna put it in caps incase it was wrong :P *) Ahh good old Manu Chao... always gets me crazy! (That's better than uncrazy) (usually) I've been having fun with my ears, they've gone all clogy and deaf *almost wrote death... just typed almoist* (Eugh) Yeay! I'm in a happy, nothing's too much to ask mood! Oh dear... some thing usually goes wrong when I'm in one of these hyper moods. Ah well... that's hyperness of life! Really not making sense... go. watch. friends. good.

 Hey Kiddies. My computer's gone wacko again. Apparantly I'm posting to ee e Sane. Weird huh? Little green men again! Damn them! *yawn* I think I need a nap. Too much chocolate... Aargh it's so weird though, it tastes pointless! (v weird) I haven't been eating it for ages (lent thingy) and then suddenly I start eating some *cough cough cough*. Okay, okay, three eggs isn't that much you know! (Still got the big one left!) Aaah! Some one help me. Wait a minute, noooo! My chocolate! Get off! (Ehe) Aaah so frustrated... too contained... need to go mad again... You know, when you go all serious and don't have fun, mostly cause you're not with your friends.... aaah better phone Izzy... are we doing any thing tomorrow? (Probably) Hehe... so much for being arranged! Yep, English totally doesn't make sense! Or maybe it's my use of it that's flaud (Both?) Never mind. I've gone all arty at the moment, I'm trying to do some 'painting' *eeeeeeeee* Not good. And general lets think about life thingy. DAMN! NEED MINSTRELS! More like E numbers. Am I actually this boring in real life? Yep, definatly one of these 'i am not worthy oh god of pink bunny flowers'. AAAH listening to Beetles. AAAH! MISSING SIMPSONS! AAAH haven't phoned Izzy! AAAH AAAH! Definatly need to get out more. Some one come and drag me out of my house please! AAAH BEATLES STILL ON! Phew, it's only... Crosby, Stills, Nash? and Young? Who the hell? Sounds like the Beatles though.... AAAAHHHHH!

 Hellllllllloooooooooooooooo!!! I'm back online!! So howz my peoples??? I'm not gonna b online nxt week, so Kes talk some rubbish for me. Prague sounds like fun. I have had a busy week!! xx

 HEEEY! I'm BAAACK!!! *from Prague...) ^_^; Uhh... yeah... Well, it was really fun! (I can't believe Cardiff was the hottest place in Europe on Thursday!) Prague is really nice... it's full of Baroque buildings and all the architecture *just pretend that's readable* was amazing! It was even kind of hot! *yeay!* Only bad bit was me on the plane back, my ear was completely gunked up with wax so when we landed it absolutly killed ^_^* (still does!) So now I'm deaf in my right ear! YEAY! And then it hurt to breathe when I was trying to go to sleep *at home* so I kind of woke my mum up and fainted... then it was alright! So if I just forget about the last bit of Thursday, it was great! Is it Friday...? Ahh! So it is! Ahh.. only had about 70 bits of spam floating around in my soup, so that's alright! Any way... Prague. It's Czech Republic's capital! (That took about five minutes to work out how to spell it... I'm tired ok!) It was really amazing because it was full of so many different nationalities, there were French, Spanish, German, Dutch, English and Czech people! And Prague was covered in amazing stuff! *slightly in awe* Ahh... and I loved Charles Bridge. It was covered in amazing statues, and had people playing music all along it (and shops *teehee*) I got this cool fish bracelet from there! We heard a load of jazz, it was really cool! It was actually a really cultural place... hmm... I think I am crazy. I really need to stop talking to myself/brick walls. Which one's worst? I've been having one of those 'oh crap i'm so stupid' days, you know? Like when you think about things that have happened and realised that some stuff completely went over the top of your head! I hate that! Hmm.. soluble fish. Cool eh?

 Did every one hear about that British guy who went to help the Palestinians, and end up getting shot even though he was protecting children and wearing a desognated orange thingy? That was where the poem came from.

 Ahh I'm going to Prague! Yeay! From Monday to Thursday, so sorry but no insanities from me on the site then! (Hehe... actually I'll probably find a internet bar some where so I can delete my junk mail!) *sob sob* All the mail I get it junk! Unless... I'm deleting all the non-junk mail. ^_^; Hehe... Eeek! Nahhh! Any way... zzz... so tired! Ooooh! I better go phone Izzy, she thinks that lent is over on Monday! (Dumbo!) Aaah! She might break the fast a few days before it ends! That would be bad! Okay, so I'm hyper on the net, but whacked out in real life... why can't it be the other way around? What if we died in silence, No on heard the scream. What if no one saw, The body that was never seen. Why won't some one stop them, The murderers in the world. Why won't some one help us, Bring peace to all. When it is right in front of you, Staring you in the eyes. Why won't some one help, The Palestinian's lives.

 hello, the girl with the short hair here. O Monday @ the Grove with lunch 11:00 till wen eva, hope u make it. xx

 Ahh yes... sorry about the influx of poems! It's just that I find that I can express myself easier that way... plus it sounds better and is harder to understand! HAHAHAA! (Not sure if that's a good thing...) Yep... been thinking too much again! Some one's hacked at my piece of the jicksaw and now it has no where to fit. :( You know the feeling? ...Um... ok then. Mmm... feeling pretty useless and unworthy at the moment, but hey, I'm me. The mood changing colour ring girl. Yep... what colour... hmm... turqouise? Yeah! Cause I can't spell it and don't know what it's supposed to represent! YEAY! Go rip up some tissues!

 I seem to have a problem in life, I remain unable to fakely laugh. I am friends with who I want to be, If I don't like you, Then you don't like me. However I am surrounded by Jesters who play, And fakely laugh every single day. People who go out into space, Just for a chance to spite me. I don't want to be, Stuck in a miserable world like this. Help me break free. All 'poems' on this are done by me - stilldreaming *pen name* kes *fake real name!* YEAY!

 Hey. I've been having kiddy days. My brother's gone wacho and we're having kiddy fights. Life is fun. :) Oh, then nojh *pronounced nodge, actually john* has gone all excited about playing rounders with a big stick... my conclusion? Obviously the laughing gas has become a part of the atmosphere! Ahh, and that's good! I hate becoming too stiff and serious, that's gotta be bad! Oh, did I tell you about all the stupid things we've been doing? It's been getting worse recently! Teehee, must be teenage rebellion against all the boring adults. We were actually having fun in PE the other day! I stepped into the long jump and got a 1m30, and Izzy cartwheeled into it! Ha! Dig our crappy rebellion against PE! YOU CAN'T FORCE US TO DO ANY THING! that we don't want to do. Eat a whole chocolate cake... definatly a yes! Ehe... see kiddy mood! Lately I've been too old mood, but I'm getting into stroppy teenager mode! YEAY!

 Sitting here laughing, Hearing the sound bounce back. When will some thing absorb it, And listen to it for me? Sitting here crying, Wishing for comfort not grief. All I can think of is my lonleness, As the puddle forms at my feet. I drowned from my tears, My ears burst from the sound. Laying there dead, Under the cold solid ground. Why didn't it absorb it my fears? What will protect me now?

 Ahhh... I think I'm having a start of my life crisis. Where is every one...? I finally went on MSN after years of ...not being bothered (i'd had enough!) And then I go on it... and no one's on. Oh, and I used to go on this chatroom, where I knew every one (and was a foot) *...* And I was gonna go back on... but then I realised that I haven't been on it for years and I wouldn't know any one! I need a community! (Jeez) Hmm... I was thinking about taking Tae Bo classes or some thing (with Laura of course) or maybe ruling the word. (Learning to spell would be better) Sorry about randomness, I've been playing on LF2 : Little Fighter 2! It's so much fun! You get to kill people! In the game of course... ^_^

 I pull my hair, In front of my eyes. To protect my face, To keep up my disguise. I take a step, And wobble inside. I am the pillar, That has demised. Some body reveal me, Some body help. Some body protect me, From the dark of myself.

 Ahh... so physically drained. Yeesh, I feel like I'm gonna faint. Damn exams... *yawn* I'm going alright so far, I've got three results back; English - A, History - A*, Chemistry - 67%. (I almost put Chimistry, that's how bad I am at it!) Ahh I should be find... mind over matter, I've been doing a lot of that recently. Or is it mind over mind? Ahh... sooo tired, I keep typing the wrong stuff sorrrry! Hmm... but I did badly in chemistry... well... kind of.We do three sciences and get two GCSE's for it! How whacked is that? Mind you, doing three GCSE's in the sciences is supposed to be hard! *i'd rather do one!* Aggh, my right ears packed up! STUPID SCHOOL! (Ahh, you can blame school for every thing!) I HAVE NO LIFE! STUPID SCHOOL! (Well... maybe not that...) Has every one been following the war on the news? It's so different on Sky news and BBC news. We don't really know what's going on though. Half of it's propaganda, and the other half is rumours, what is going on? Every point of view is bound to be biast though. Oh, and we should care. This is happening because we can't stop it. People are dying. We should at least try. Why create more deaths and suffering, when there's already too much in the world? Why bother? As some person said, (or my mum :P not sure) truth is the first victim in war. Ooh, meaninful point: we shouldn't take things at face value. I found a point! *finally!* I have meaning in my life! (Oh dear God)

 Woohooo! I'm Baaaaaaaack! Well, not exactly, I'm in IT, but OH MY GOD - there are sooo many things wrong with my computer my mum is going mad!! So It could be a while before I get back to regular blogging

 YAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Exams are finally over, o hang on deep conversation becans! I feel fantastic and will cry if I fail all my exams! xx

 I'm deeper than I look, I'm deeper than I feel. I wish just for once, I could crawl out of this hole. Why do I have to be the one, To translate meaningful words? Why can't I be the one, Who has fun in this world! Maybe my release, Comes from my bounds. It's some thing that I'm searching for, Some thing that wants to be found. Won't you help me up, Or will you fill in the hole? Did you know, That your deeper than you look, It's true for us all. AN: Deeper as in... deep thinking, deeply psychological!

 I'm too irrational, I'm too bouncy, I'm like a kitty on LSD. But don't you like me, Hyper as I am? Or would you like me more, As mellow as can be. Never mind, It doesn't matter. But then maybe it matters to me, Your hyper little kitty, On her cute pink LSD. Realisation is the biggest disappointment.

 Bonjour my little things!!!! im sat here still doing maths coursework and i have done it all bar the flipping nth term, as i have no idea how to do it. hence the reason that i am sat here frantically surfing the net for some help at this tiem of the morning so that mayby just mayby i can have some kind of social life this afternoon!! my little holiday was fun. i went to a river with my devonian friends and had to prove that the water would not go over my head, and got wet and sunburnt in the process. i went to the beach and went in the sea upto my waist in my swimming cossie. it was a little funny as mum had put my suncream on when i had my tanktop on and she missed a bit on both shulders, so i now have these two burnt lines on my shoulders and they hurt, o well, it was fun!!

 Por que Bill Gates llamo a su sistema operativo 'Windows' ('Ventanas' en ingles), si lo podria haber llamado 'Gates' ('Puertas' en ingles)? *accents taken off, blogger doesn't like them apparantly* Teehee, that made me laugh *give me a break, I'm doing spanish coursework! It says something like: Why did Bill Gates call his operating system *or something like that* 'Windows' ('Windows' in English) when he could have called it 'Gates' ('Gates' in English)? Don't ask. I was looking for English in the i section of the English - Spanish dictionary. Get it, inglish? Makes looooads more sense! urlLink http://www.sitiodesordos.com.ar/los.htm Look at number 29. It says something like: If a person with multiple personalities decides to commit suicide... can they be consider to have taken hostages? Ahh... urlLink babel.altavista.com Translate here. Mmm... it's a bit weird actually. Remember: Fish may be pink, People may be blue. But sure as hell, That smell is you.

 Did you know that apparantly they take temperature readings in the shade? So when it says the highest, it's probably higher! *if that makes sense... go get yourself checked out* Aaargh it's so hot here! 24!! And yes... it's a beautiful day and I'm doing ENGLISH COURSEWORKK!!! AAARGHHHH!!! Eugh... I feel like my brains melted inside my head... (I had a brain?!?!?!!) Yeesh does get a bit tiring though... 5 pages on size 10! *save me!* Oh don't worry, still got Spanish, Maths and Chem and Hist homework to go! Actually... that's a lot... and only today and Sunday to do it! Bisieee!

 Ahh... so tired... I got a bit of heat stroke so I'm really tired... and I've been trying to do coursework! Some how I've ended up with all my coursework to be done in the holidays, the teachers probably think that the other teachers don't do that, but then they all do! (Maths coursework must be getting to me, I really don't make any sense) Any way... yeay! I'm back from Harrogate! Woohoo *zzz* I had fun trying on my bridesmaid dresss *eugh* it didn't make me look like erm... bad or anything which was good *sometimes they do... must be the bride flaunting her power over it* and my Auntie has a massive hat for the day *apparantly, no one can take their hat off until the mother of the bride has taken hers off* which gives her a load of power! (Ahh well... I'll just hit some one with my pose, or stand really close to someone with hay fever) *muhehe* Heeeheee, we saw this guy in a open top car with a inflatable woman dressed up in a red wig and a fancy dress! Yeah, go guy who doesn't give a damn! *and cheese snaps to the rest of us* Err... it's the heat stroke... Mmm. Oh, and I got my ears pierced but no one notices! It is me or are my blogs disappearing? *I'm going mad again* My pills! My pills! Where are they?! Mmm... maybe I need to electronically tag them ---*cut here*--- Really needed to end that randomness! Need a new head... need... mmm something. I'll find out some day what I need. *I actually need to go to sleep* Geez, I'm always really sleepy. *zzz...* urlLink http://pub44.ezboard.com/fthelionsgrovediscussionfrm21.showMessage?topicID=103.topic That's just boringly weird! Have fun kids.

 Hmm... I really should stop wandering around the net, some one should tie me to a post or something. urlLink http://www.geocities.co.jp/Hollywood/9060/holye.html And trust me, I have absolutly no idea what it's going on about. And 'BAKA' means idiot, or idiotic in that context. Go figure.

 Hehe, so I guess you want to know how the three-people-chained-together day went then huh? *Well you're gonna hear about it anyway!* Eh... I didn't mean it like that... Yeesh I'm stuck now. *Best to carry on and not pretend to notice* Okay. Umm... so any way, it went okay. We got a load more suc- I mean friends to give us money- no, no, I mean sponser us. *to what, go on holiday?* No, the culture the culture!!! Yeah... *teehee fools* Well anyway, I'm gonna be in Harrogate from Sunday to Wednesday this week. *God help me, I'm trying on my bridesmaid dress* Geez... so long as I don't breathe every thing should be fine... yes fine...

 HEY! I'm baaaackkk! *aaahhh! run for cover!* (dig a hole and stay in it) Yeesh, I really have needed to talk to any one pointlessly for ages... I've missed you blogger! *big hug* That wasn't pointless or anything... (Could've been spelt better!) Any way onto pointless ramblings.... Today I watched Russain Arc *Yes, I put arck* which is the first film to be filmed in one continous shot! Woohoo, go Russians! (Which involved watching a lot of subtitles and getting annoyed when they didn't put any on for some people) Geez, before it started this guy behind me was talking too loudly... God he was annoying. He started off saying stuff like how there's no basis for a relationship unless 'she's' attractive, even thjough before he was saying he was like 40 with two kids *what a catch* Like that guy can be picky. Then he was saying how these 16 year olds wouldn't go out with him *for god sake, don't let him be referring to us!* and the person next to him was trying to comfort him. I was gonna turn around and go 'no one would' but I didn't. Actually I probably would have punched him and said something really memorable... why can't I ever think of anything memorable?! *probably because when i do say something like that, I say a million things after it so it becomes less memorable* Ahh, I see.

 Weeeeeeeeee day off school because i am ill. Blurghhh. I have decided that being ill int that great becasue you get sooo bored, and day time tv from about 1 on wards goes from bad to bad!! O well, the barn dance was fun. He played the YMCA for ME!!! xx

 Ahh yet another can't-work-out-what-your-trying-to-tell-me school day. Some how you're supposed to psychologically figure people out, it's hard some times. What are you supposed to think of people when they obviously lie to your face? Are you supposed to believe everything that you hear? Who invented popcorn? Mmm... there's a lot of psychological stuff that people don't pick up on, gets a bit annoying though. When some one asks to borrow a pen, are they actually asking for a pencil? Well not... but inuendo in a way I guess. Hmm... And what are you supposed to think of people who obviously lie to you? Do they not respect you or some crap like that? Aargh school's too hard, it's too hard to try to understand people. (How the hell do you do that?) *...guess?*

 urlLink http://www.sparknotes.com/ Thankfully I tripped over that websie earlier today, I just wanted to make sure that I am doing the English essay right!

 Hey! I went to a barn dance yesterday! It was fun! Half way through we all had to go out because nextdoor they were doing this show, and they forgot to put the smoke covers over the fire alarms and they had some smoke or something *breathes* Then two fire engines turned up, and this lady started taking photos so I started to hide. YEAY! It was really fun though! It was my brother's girlfriends thingy, but he didn't turn up till late cause he was with his friend at the hospital who broke his leg. *aww* But he ended up dancing really stupidly with his friend, then the rest of his friends started doing it, got a bit crazy. Then Lynne requested YMCA at the end, and I did it backwards *took a lot of brain work, at least I'm doing something with it!* Uh yeah... isn't this pointless? Never mind! It's damn interesting boring! YEAY! Let's all go eat erm... bourbons! *drool*

 Isn't it really sad how Britain's really un-European? We sit here on our tiny island, sticking to our language and not even realising what amazing stuff is out there. No one speaks anything apart from English, our music charts are ridiculed by sad English pop music that you can't even compare to some of the international stuff, and yet we're European. We don't even take the Euro. It is sad! There's all this amazing songs, art and stuff that we don't even bother to look at. *majorly changing the actually good point* I wanna learn Spanish well! :'( Not just so I can sing along to Manu Chao... really... I wanna go on holiday to Spain and not be arrogant to think that they speak English. I don't want to be arrogant or ignorant.

 Hehe. My mum's friend came down from Southampton today! She saw these banners on the way out of Southampton *worded wrong- it's hard to type, and sing along to things you know!* that said - George Bush the weapons of mash *yes I wrote mash* MASS even . Ok... so now it's ruined, let's start again. George Bush, the weapons of MASS destruction are here. Funny huh! Oh yeah... I forgot about all the backround information! Well Southampton are playing *or were* the FA Cup final today at Cardiff's ... *won't even try to spell* stadium. (Ok, so they lost but oh well) Have you ever had a dream where you're actually some one else? When I was younger I used to have it, I would get all worried because they wouldn't know anything about my house, where to go or what to do. Why didn't I just screw up there lives? Because I was too worried about them doing that to mine! Ok... so enough of the freak lesson that goes nowhere... I hear you, I hear you. Umm... I just kind of broke Kazaa... I'll just kick it a few times... *KABOOOM*

 Ahhhh...Emma Bunton song stuck in head!! U should be glad that your cats love you enough to bring you presents. My guinea pigs dont give me things. Hummm I have a tiny head ache, that aches. tis sad that. xx

 Looking forward to National Watercress Week, as I'm sure you all are: urlLink http://www.watercress.co.uk/home/ And don't ask what watercress is.

 Hmm... damn cats. I came back from Izzy's to find my mum screaming and pointing at a bat. Yes, a bat. My cats caught a bat. I hate that, how they have to catch something just because they're cats. Supposedly it's a present, I guess it shows that they care. But sadly I don't think my wardrobe this summer will appreciate a bat purse. *it's tiny* Ok... bat thimble then. Ahh, I really need to go to sleep and... sleep. *I actually read for ages* I'm so sure you didn't need to know that. My handy furniture friend has just told me about Cadbury's latest marketing ploy, putting: "Do not eat if seal is broken" on Cadburys Animal Biscuits. Must be some conspiracy so you have to buy another packet! *Don't worry if you don't get it at first, took me about five minutes* I think I use the word conspiracy too much. Inuendo. There are too many. With the lovely corrupted French Government, and our totally unpopular doesn't-do-what-the-public-wants government, and let us not forget the American elections *sigh* Now weren't they just a bundle of twine? *laughs actually, couldn't be bothered to type it though, trying not ot go to sleep without pressing publish*

 Tengo nada porque quiero nada! Wahay! Sorry... it's been rattling around in my head for ages! *hey I can't speak English... lets try Spanish instead!* Hey wait a minute... that bit of Spanish didn't work any way! *sigh* Hmm... wonder if I could try french. Je suis Le Poisson Soluble! *well isn't that boring?* Hmm who votes russain! (Don't worry I'm not that freaky* all eyes to Izzy! Nah, I'm crap at those languages anyway. But I guess I could go into my oral exams and tell them that 'I have nothing because I want nothing' and 'I am the soluble fish'. A*! WOHOOO! Nah... I wanna find out what eternal is in Japanese or Chinese and have it enscribed inside a ring. Eternally what...? Eternally here. Ha! I so don't make any sense! *sorry about my delicate 'condition' today, I've had school :P*

 Yeesh. Just watched Donnie Darko. Mmm.... jeez... still getting my head around it *seeing as it's so big it could take some time* HEY! I object to this sort of treatment! I could get my head around it anyday! *you're head maybe... but you're butt...* Grr... Anyway, go download it! It's good *very confusing* but still good. Sad at the end, but hey I didn't cry! Black Cat Banzai (1933), in which Japanese toys defeat an evil Mickey Mouse. *Damn I never put quotes in the right place* urlLink http://animezone.co.uk/anime/history.htm What a cool idea for propoganda!!!

 Ahh. My room's a total mess (some how all my clothes are on my chair!) Yeay! Finally, room in my closet! Eugh, it is kind of hard to walk around the chair without it falling on my foot though... hmm... Owchiesie! My arm hurts. :( I had two jabs today, cause I'm going to Russia! Yeay! I was fine having them done... but they kind of made me a bit dizzy and my arm hurts now! And that sugar cube... what a weird polio taste! *mmm freak taste* But hey, I got a Australian crunch later! *and I just had a gingerbread man* I'm ill I swear! I'm not usually this mad... *yeah... right...* What happened to bracket girl? *wouldn't you like to know teeheehee* Mmm... but any way... I really should be doing homework. Nahh, I'm ill right! *actually really dizzy and a bit zonked* Uhuh, normal then I guess. Hey woow! You can download FY from here: urlLink http://www.animezone.co.uk/home.htm Wow! And I am so not ill enough to be this excited... *I have weird dreams when I'm that ill* Yeay! Freaky dreams! Woohoo! Ahh... need... another... gingerbread *hell it's one word now* MAN!!! AAAHHHH! Or a bourbon I guess... what? We're out?! Where's the chocolate! I neeeed chocolate! *mmm... need to go be 'normal'*

 Heey! Akira messed with my head! (even more) So now my brain's like a fried scramble egg! *i've had that!* Any way... it was really weird this morning, I woke up and my pyjamas were on back-to-front, inside-out! * - or not? * How tired was I last night! Or maybe in my sleep I turned them inside out... *hehe both spellings in! one of them's gotta be right!* The weirdest was waking up when I was really young in a cocoon! *my douvet was kind of wrapped around me really tightly* I had to roll onto the floor to get out of it! *freaky kid* Yeah... I used to hide all my toys under the douvet cause I thought the toy monster would get them! Then when I would find them on the floor, it only proved it! *FREAK* I only had half a bed! Then I used to think that if I didn't sleep upside down, under the douvet the vampires would get me. Then I would forget how to go to sleep. Geez, getting to sleep was a big deal for me! *cause my brother was taken ill in the morning and couldn't wake up or some weird freak thing like that* Nope, just me. Mmmm... I just blogged about sleep... mind you, that takes about two thirds of my day!

 Mmm... I'm cold! Eugh... feel kind of sick, I just had one of Rik's special dinners. *so fattening!* It's cheese, egg, bread crumbs and bacon all fried and weird. (Sounds nice huh?) Ahh I'm going to see Akira at IMAX! Yeay! (I sound like a kid again!) Aaargh Kazaa's annoying. Every one gets really good conections with us and we get 0.09kb/s! Damn it! *we're too nice* Not really, I close it so it gets rid of all the uploads and then reopen it! *muhahaa!* Mmm... I really need an After Eight! But they're Nestle! Are there any fake rip of After Eight's out there? *maybe I should put an add in the paper*

Some times you just don't care what happens to them (fine, JUMP!) Hehe... I don't really mean that! (Damn brain) Jeez I'd really freak out if some one did that... even in a movie! I'm always afraid of the invisible enemy. (Mmm hmm. My IQ!)

I'm getting drowned in loud posh -owchie my head hurts- guitar music *from the PC* (No really... I'm being serenaded by a guy who's hidden in my PC) *ahhh that guy...* EH? Aha... must be the paint fumes I guess. Yes, I painted the fence! Woohooo!

Apart from people shouting across the IT classroom (Pete, Chris) and Beki obbsesively trying to beat her previous score on Clevermedia arcade. Wow I haven't done any blogging for ages. *sniff sniff* need to excersise writing skills somehow without blogger - argh! It doesnt help being a slow typer, it takes ages to convey anything!

I'll just be sending plans off to microsoft now... nevermind if they're evil...how are they evil exactly? I'm a very anti-evil anti-capitalist anti-globalisation kinda person but what have microsoft actually done? I'd be interested to know. Oh well there's always Intel.

 Eugh I'm getting annoyed with myself. I always see the bad things in people! *inwardly* It's really, sad really... well I do internally you know? But everyone's so great! (It's only with people who are smelly) Nah, I just ignore them! *hah take that!* But then I also ignore people that I like... I don't want people to have that bigger influence over me. *plus all the people I like don't like me* and I get confused. Which I'm trying to do to you now! MUHAHAHAAA! Look left! To your foot! *why does feet always come into it?* I hate looking at people and thinking 'why are they alone?' cause everyone's so great! *hypocrite* No one should be alone. *that's why i annoy people so much, cause i don't like leaving people alone* Ah yes, this is why I'm alone! *oh well* Scary huh? I'll just be crawling away and coming back wearing a french wig under a different alias! Bye! Bonjour. Vous avez un poisson?!?!?!!! ... Maybe not ...

 Ocean Colour Scene - Profit In Peace. Good song.... not that I sing along with it or anything... Mmm I'm kind of in a 'everyone's alone' mood. Damn, I hate it!

 Ig / Arr - ogance What if I heard your words, You whispered to an ear. What if whenever you did these things, I was standing near. What if I said that I know your game, I've followed and learnt the rules. What if I said maybe I hadn't, What if you had to choose? Ahh... just trying to keep you sweet ;)

 Hey.... sorry about the lack of posting! It's just that I've been uhh... preparing for Russia! *and trying to learn how to say prepare!* Ahh, now that's just impossible! Anyway... yeay! I'm going on Saturday at 2am! AHHHH! Well it should be fun, we get to meet a non *well kind of* materialistic society! *is there such a thing?* We're learning about cultures in English.... does ours suck? We've got the whole rich / poor divide, we've still got racism, sexism etc and we still have corruption. There will always be one person who sticks to this though, sad aye? *sorry if i'm talking shit, i'm hot and tired!*

 Woohoo! I was up for 24hrs yesterday! *we went a bit psycho at about 3 or 4* Sorry neighbours! For some reason everything was hysterical and I was the cardboard faerie! *we were having a discussion about what the tooth faerie did with teeth* Interesting huh? We're this weird without alcohol!

I've got some really weird dares lined up! &#61605; Spend 2hrs without saying the letter e. &#61605; Dont turn left for the rest of the day. &#61605; Every person you say something to you have to bow at their feet and call them omnipotent god of cheese And that's only 3 out of 16! MUHAHAHA THE POWER!!!!

 Erm... we've got it already Lynne don't worry! AAAHHH! I'm listening to this song that we song in Primary school! AAAHHHHH! HELP! The horrible memoriesss! Ralph McTell - Streets of London. Thus proving that teachers are trying to brain wash us into liking certain things! *it gets weirder* I had a dream that my earing had ripped out but my ear was alright and I couldn't get it back in! What a freak dream. Oh yeah... AHHH must change the music! From the Guardian (12 Nov 94), re: Paul Ridout, one of the British backpackers kidnapped in India by Kashmiri separatists, and recently freed: The first thing he had done after arriving home was to eat some Marmite on toast. "It was pretty good. It's just one of those thingsyou get out of the country and it's all you can think about." Yeah... hmmm... I don't think that I would be thinking about marmite if I was kidnapped! urlLink http://www.gty.org/~phil/marmite.htm#wherebuy And don't ask how I got onto a site about Marmite!

 Well i have looked for my name on google and all it came out with was this websits so im not tooooo scared, at the moment. its 1984 by George Orwell i do believe i will look on amazon for you whilst looking for cds 4 my friend in Devon. weeeeeeeeee nearly kes' party!! xx

 Mmm... if we are going to be reincarnated *not that I'm saying that we are gonna be* Eugh... stick with it guys! (Fetch!) That was lame... anyway.... what would you want to be? I told my mum cat, but if you think about it... cats just eat crap and sleep *that's me! ;)* So that's not exactly an ideal reincarntion. But what is? I don't recon a human is the best form to be in *if we are in a form* We can lie, and are deceptive. We're also extremely selfish and destroy the environment around us *purrrr* Shh! Damn second half of my soul *mumble mumble* Aww.... Mango's with me! *so's my box of celebrations! teehheee!* No, I am not feeding my cat chocolate if you were wondering... worth a try though! (I'm gonna be seriously dangerous when I'm let loose on the world!) Hmm... don't you find that you always get the wrong end of the knife? *wrong end of the stick is just a boring saying!* Anyway... knife works better metaphorically so :P! (Now I'm having fights with myself) Oh well *sigh* WEEEEEEE!!!

Mmm... wasn't I going to take off my e-mail address so I get no more sep*tic tank info! *have to do the * otherwise I will* Geez, privacy doesn't exist now! Quite scary! Read 1984 and you'll understand how scary! (It could be 1982... I'm never sure!) Or go watch Gravitation and go 'hmm' until you get to the 2nd one! Err... yeah dammit I control your life!!! *now THAT would be scary! Trust me, it would. I'ld probably have you eating peanut butter with cheese! *mmm* I... have to... go now... *mmm peanut butter and cheese* to do homework and play the piano! (Pfft. Yeah right!) Woohooo made up homework! YEAY!

I knew if I left it alone and did nothing everything would turn out alright! *my philosophy on life... you should see my room...* Yeah, I'm still waiting for that to work itself out, at the moment it looks like an elephant has sat down in it. Hey, no rude comments on me! *it was because Izzy came round* Teehee. Picking on friends is fun. So long as they realise that you don't really mean it... Actually all the butt jokes have made me very butt conscious! Err... okay... so the webpage is err blank and empty... but the posts are on the blogger posting admin thingy that I have! *that's alright then* Hmm...

Cheese is edible finally... thank God! We had an ...interesting day at school! Erm... this boy took a fire hydrant and hid it in his jumper, then he left it at his desk still in his jumper in a science room *duuuuuh* He really needs some lesson in 'getting away with it'. Ahh... my dad's discussing his 'computer diary' with his friend... why is it that old*er* people don't get that you just have to mess about with new things to get them to work! *a little thing called responsability and -no guarentee comes with this product I guess* Ahhh! Where are my posts?!?! Must - have - link - to - unreal/fake/can'tthinkofwordatmoment - world! AHHH!

 YEAY! Russia here we come! Weeeee! Ahh I'm excited now! I think I'm gonna come back with about 50 Russian dolls though, they'll do me for smuggling! *trust me, it'll be a lot worse with vodka!* Mmm... what else err... Russian jelly babies? Err no. And there's NO way I'm going to McDonald's in Russia! I don't care if I eat a cats intenstine, I'm not going! *please don't hold me to it! I love cats* Hmm... has any one watched 'Stop it and Tidy up'? It was sooo cool! And the big thing that said 'I said noooo' that was the best! Lemme go search for it *sigh* ...

 urlLink http://www.maketradefair.com/registration_lips3.asp?cat=1&subcat=3&select=1 It's a Oxfam petition thingy to make the world fair trade! Yeay! Yes, yes... I've signed it! *hell, I thought the wearing fair trade clothes and only buying fair trade chocolate would be enough!* Not to put any pressure on you or anything... *tap tap* Don't worry I'll do nothing ... just sit here tapping my desk waiting for you to click *tap .... tap .... tap ... tap* Oh, and sign. *tap... tap... tap... tap... tap... tap... tapapapapapapattatpapaptaptpatpataptpatpatpatpatpatpatpatpat* How the hell did it turn into pat?

Damn. *why am i always going on about pills?* I'm not a druggie... honestly! *set myself up then... eugh* But yes, I talk to myself so I guess I am mad. Do you recon that we're all mad, and the people we see as insane are actually sane? *it's things like that, that prove that I'm mad.*

 Mmm... I think my hotmail's been hacked... apparantly I was trying to send a virus to someone that I've never even heard of... *scared...* But a lot of things scare me. Like the lack of careness *caring* yes, yes, whatever shut up! (Like there) But people don't seem to notice, the world's so cold. It's scary. Like the girls who are obsessed with themselves and their problems, and try and convince you that breaking their nail is worse than anything that could ever have happened to you. *bitter sounding* Well... I've had to put up with it enough, we all have. What about *the children!* No, what about the people who are dying because they don't have any food, that simple thing could save them. What about people who have been ill for their whole lives and are waiting to die? Oh, but you're right. Nails are important, aren't they? *i think too much*

 Hey... wouldn't it be cool if someone made a rolly ball pen *think about it...* ball point pen! Yes one of those! *already done* Hey, wait for the imaginative bit! With... *dadadedum* Okay so it's a crappy idea so bluergh *like the rest* with.... Ok DAMN I've forgotten what it's called!!! Oh... erm... body paint! Hold on to your chair... yes... don't fall out and stop looking at me like that! *just talking to Mango* Maths coursework is bad for you. Remember that.

 Muhahahaaa! *well who likes lemons anyway* Err... my brother would actually eat them... err... But anyway! They're too sour! *Aww but they're cool* Damn alter-ego. Damn not knowing-where-to-put hyphens.

 Ahh... right, done all the coursework apart from the Maths! FINALLY! And guess what... Yes, I've ran out of paper and I can't do that maths... damn... I'm screwed. But, apparently it's in for Wednesday *but we have a lesson on Monday!* My other friend thinks it's supposed to be in on Tuesday *... don't know what's going on there* Heheee my brother's wearing a kaftan to the wedding in June! *i get a bridesmaid dress!* It's really cool though... *note to self: nick kaftan* Ahh... so tempting to make a bad joke... must fight it! Aww... Mango's sitting here with me! He's sooo cute, he's orange *not ginger! damn that Spanish test...* and he has orange eyes! And he's pretending to be asleep so I'll hug him more... *sneaky cat* Him and Brodie *his brother* have cute posing competitions on the lawn.

 HEY I'm back again! *Geez I just can't stay away for too long can I?* My mum had a really clever idea *well, I kind of did* All the old rock stars need OT's for grab rails and risk assesment!!! And guess what my mum is... that's right! ... A FISH!!! *insert clever profession here more like* Uhh... no... I'm pretty sure that she's an Ocupational Therapist. Well... if you don't know what that is, go here: urlLink http://www.occupationaltherapist.com/ Oh, anyway Exmoor was fun! It er -cough- didn't rain one speck... *it rained several large oceans instead* Don't worry... that didn't stop us from going on four 5 mile walks! *and they were uphill loads!* But hell, it was fun! *especially playing Happy Familys, I won!* Hehe... and due to our rutheless Pontoon betting, I won a load of Skittles! MUHAAHAAA! Not that I let it go to my head ;) And not that Izzy won everything else... oh, and not that she's overly OVERLY obsessed with her boy friend Pete. *sigh* It's tough being stuck with some one like that... kidding kidding, it was loads of fun! Woohoo, London on Tuesday! Don't worry, I'll be back on Saturday if you miss me.

 *Much much later MUCH later. Infact so much later that it may actually be considered to be 24hrs later* Sooory peeps! Oh well... I guess you don't really want to hear about the inflatable cabbages. *mmmm* Uh - actually, there weren't any, but hey you missed out on the 'posh' food on plates at the wedding. (Ok, so food on plates sounds a little bit stupid, I mean the stuff that the waiters / waitresses carry around.) *FOOD ON PLATES?* Err... Anyway, I brought the tone down by 'gracefully' falling on my butt *which is hard to do!* My brother threw a tooth pick down my dress, and I stepped back and because the bottom of the dress was so tight I stepped back onto it and fell over! (Trust me, it's easy to do that!) *I guess you don't have to be there...* Ahh but I'm tired cause we were up on our feet for about 18hrs *zzz* so I made up for it today by staying in bed till 11! (pm?) Yep, I'm typing this in my sleep, freaky huh? But I'm gonna leave you all on your own on Tuesday! *again? sob sob* Hey, that almost sounded fake! *almost? drat!* I'm going on holiday to Exmoor with Izzy and my crazy travelling circus. *I'm the professional faller-on-her-butt-gracefully, we're a rare find!* Then I'm coming back next Monday, then going away again and I'll be back next next Saturday! *Not this one, the next one* Or was it Tuesday? I dunno... the 2nd of August! And wooohooo! School holidays! YEAAAAYYYYY! *On Tuesday for me, WEDNESDAY for every one else! MUHAHAHAAA!* I love being special! :D

 Yeay! I'm baaackkk! Incase you didn't know *shock* I was a bridesmaid at my cousins wedding! Ahh, it was sooo fun and amazing! She had a crown and an amazing white puffy dress *unfortunatly, the 'netting' around the bottom collected flies! But she didn't know so it was alright...* Geez I'm tired. I'll go phone Laura, sleep and then blog later ok?

 urlLink ACE Official I.Q. Test, optical Illusions, and Games Website 2003-2004 (Psst... that's a link) Don't ask what I'm doing on a intelligence website! The optical illusion thingy is weird... you can make your own, and even though I know what it's supposed to say, I don't see it!

 *Yawn* I'm so sleepy. I read until about 1am, but I woke up at 1pm so why am I so sleepy? I think it's just me... wait a minute, this music is really slow.. it's Opeth they're kind of heavy but Benighted is really soothing and nice! *Heavy music's cool too, but it just makes you more depressed!* Woohoo for teenagers! Mmm... I need to write more, there are too many things flying around my head. Ahh, but I think on this, I'd bore you all to death! Wait a minute... *poke* ... *poke* AAAHHHH! Ok, erm, don't panic... Or you can... wait a minute check for your pulse! *I couldn't find it once in science, so technically I was dead* (Still am... MUHAHHAA!) Er, maybe not. It's weird, I'm listening to music from different nationalities with different languages! German, Spanish, French, Japanese, English *booo!* and some Italian I think... but their music is so much better than pop music! (Not that I like J-pop or anything...)

 Well, Izzy et Moi had fun. We went to the skate park with Pete and his friend. Izzy took me along for some strange reason, and we kind of ignored Petes strange little friend, who is strange by the way. We went to Tesco 3 times, and saw mrs Smith, and Petes Lemonade bottle fizzed everywhere so Izzy and I ran. Its SOOO COOL there is now a zippy wire at the sotch horn park wotsit, its sooooooooooo fun. I nearly pulled Izzy off it though. So she chased me and i ran. Then we came to my house had an ice lolly and she went home. Which was good, and I have been online ever since! HEHE. Ricotta Cheese sounds absolutly minging, I can tell u that I will not be trying it. U can!!! Then tell me how bad it is. xx

 urlLink Treats that Beat Disease Dis you know (or care) that purple grape juice protects against strokes and heart disease. (Did you know that you could buy purple grape juice?) Sorry, just stumbled upon this website while I was trying to searching for homework answers, damn, still waiting to trip over them. WOW! Ricotta cheese lessens PMS!!! (Have to buy some for Izzy ;P ) Shh, don't tell her. No really... I'm in doodoo now. (Just kidding) I always have to say that so people don't think that I'm actually serious, and to tell people when I'm serious *well duh* Sorry, I've been writing a letter for the people in Russia I stayed with, and you kind of have to speak straight English to them. (Even though I'm not bothering) Yup, confuse them to hell, that's one of the 400 commandements I'm sure... Hehe, looks like I'm doing well on you! *Weirdo* I know, I know, I'm brilliant *freak* Well, minus the two extra heads of course.

 Heeey sorry about lack of blogging... I've typed it twise though! *and I keep going and someone closes the window!* Aaargh that's just too annoying. But yeay! I'm typing it now... (And I've kind of forgot what the other two were about) Ahh, I'll just keep going and hopefully meet an elephant along the way *or a point... a point would be good* Geez, that's getting a bit too optomistic if you ask me! Uhh... failing that I'll erm go away and leave you to wonder about the point of this *and life* on your own, sorry! (I know it's tough without me, but I'll be back tomorrow) Oh, and don't wait up for me next week, I'm gonna be a bridesmaid!!! YEayyyy! (Which means Tuesday-Friday off of school) Ahh, there is a God! *and he's smiling at me*

 Don't you hate it when u think of the best thing to write and then it jumps out of your head like a bouncy ball??!! Or does that only happen to me?! So I recon for a silver wedding anervisery thing u shud get ur folks a silver candle thing their quite cool and they come in all shapes colours and sizes. YAY!! I am sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo sick of doing h/w and c/w all at the same time. It is doing my little head in. I really dont get the point of soooo much homework and coursework, do u? I think that homework should be abolished. it's mean and smelly and takes all night, quite literally, then I get lumbered with a stupid Graphics teacher, mentioning no names *Coumrsaundersgh* decides that he is going to check our work yesterday for today, fine spend 3 hrs doing it, does he check it NO. GRRRRRRRRRRRR he is soooo annoying. Rite moan over. I have smelly hayfever that smells and is annoying. Kes I feel selfish all the time, but u never hear me complaining, k well mayby u do, but not that much, and they way i see it is people like u and me spend 2 much time thinking about the wellfare of other people and not about ourselves. Ok well not all the time but sometimes is good. xx

 Geez I feel really selfish today for some reason... well, we all are I guess. But... I dunno, I guess I just get random weird feelings. When I was younger I used to get cravings for salami and carrots! Mind you, they were damn good carrots! I'm also more awake in the evening than in the morning, I'm really lazy when I get up. I also should be doing homework right now... Whoops. Oh well, probably only some Spanish stuff or something! Umm I should probably also be doing several other things simultaneously at this moment, but hell, Blogger needs me! Well... not so much as blogger needing me, but me needing blogger! Ahh I get dangerous if I can't write my thoughts down, too many, it gets cluttered in my small mind. It's good to record your thoughts I guess, then you have proof that you're sane (or not). Hehe... sanity. I have weird way of linking things though so maybe it's not too good for me to share my thoughts! But Blogger is good, hey, if it keeps you sane as a kitten it's got to have worked hasn't it! *shameless plug*

 Have you ever wondered if you're too much in the way or too much out of the way? Are you too aloof, or too clingy? Aaargh! Not... that I ever do... of course. It's just hard to tell when to leave people alone, when they go off sulking, say that they're alright and to not worry you stay with them of course! But then some people get angry because they actually meant it. Hmm... I'm in a random mood I guess. Yeayyy! Cheese cake and salmon sandwhiches! *Mmm salmon* I actually like salmon now, all that force feading actually worked! (But it still smells, hah! They'll never convince me otherwise!) Ahh I've got one million and three things to do, but I really can't be bothered to do them! (It's always like that with me) Damn homework...

 Hey I went shopping! Yeay! Serious lack of silver wedding anniversary - from daughter - cards! (Breathe people... breathe!) I'm gonna give them a book of poetry... let's not say anything more, you don't want to hear about my scary poetry! Eugh... what are you supposed to write for a 25th wedding anniversary? 25 years of emotions... Swimming in a botemless pitt.. Erm... I think I've confused me now! (I will rule the world!) If someone offered the world to you, would you take it? Someone was saying that they would, and would make it democratic, by having a representative from each country, but then you wouldn't have been elected so surely that's pointless. It would still be a dictatorship. I wouldn't! Simply because I don't want to corrupt myself or others. Yeeaaay, a morbid conversation! Woohooo! *morbid sounds cool*

 Ahhhhhhhhh, the page 4 the Ashton court festivel is pants!!! All i know is that there is a dance y bit, 2 stages some cool rock stuff, loads of stalls and a general happy atmosphere!! I hope that peoples still want to go, cos I do!? Umm ust do history work, really dont want to..... must get Emily a pressie, dont know what to get..... must unpack from the week at Nans, can't be bothered to move. I'm feeling so blooming lazy today, and I don't know why!! xx

 Hey... so... What are you afraid of? *sand* AAAHHH! (Don't worry, it's more of a split personality joke) Be afraid of that! MUHAHAA! Are you afraid of FOOD? Er... that's pretty damn stupid, but I bet their is a fear of food *maybe it's called anorexia* Nah, that's different I think... Anyway I have to gosie nowsie. Don't worry, I'll reflect my rays at you.

 urlLink Google Toolbar Installed Uurrr... it's telling me to put that in, let's not knock the 'we now have control over your computer and can advertise if we want to'. YEAY! Anyway... today was fun at work experience I guess! Hmm... did you know that kualas are hermaphrodites? I'm guessing that if you're my friend then you probably do... urlLink http://www.adbusters.org/campaigns/dirty_dozen/ Go contribute to the world. Show the finger to the bad corporations. *Interperit that how you wish...* Apart from a finger that's on fire and's shooting fire at them... although... it's not up to me how you ruin your life. ER... run, run, I'll do the ruining! *badumchee* (...) Heey I think I hear a blade of grass calling for me.... Later.

 I'm stupid, ne?

 Heeee! The Spanish person says jejeje, which is like hehehe! Hoohoo!

 YEAY! I'm speaking to someone in Spanish! *badly :( * And don't ask why someone would actually want to talk to me over the net... ask them! Well yeay! Russia was sooo cool, but the first day we were all like 'WHAT THE HELL ARE WE DOING HERE?' But then it got better! *phew* Do you know what it's like spending a week with a family that speaks to each other in a different language?!?! (Well... apart from my family) Me = Martian . Them = Aquatic *whatever that is..* Oh dear... I really do suck at Spanish! Anyway, we eventually settled in and eventually we all found Russia amazing, the food was so great! *Yup, I suck at describing words today* (It's worse in Spanish!) Oh, btw, no one in Russia likes Tatu! Ha! They really are crap! Uhh yeah... I'll just mold *or is it mould? Mmm... one of them's edible... * (Maybe not) myself into the pink *don't touch the page!* Oh, ho>? *typing kept in for added realisation that I'm not perfect* Well... not online ;) (Is it me or does that sound extremely err dodgey?) It probably would be if I could spell dodgey. Yeay! I can scare Spanish people too! I just said: Lo siento por mi falta de palabras y cerebro. Oh err crap, apparantly it means this : I feel it for my lack of words and brain. AAARGHHH! I seriously can scare Spanish people with my lack of Spanishness! What the hell are they talking to me for?!?! *probably for a laugh at my feeble attempts*

 Wowww! I just watched someone win Crystal Maze! *i'm obsessed, i confess! i watch it all the time!* But it's like Takeshi's Castle hard to win! *err... that's more of a need* AND I saw someone dressed up as a Ghost Buster!!! WOWWW! I sooo should have said something! (Actually it was a bit scary cause they were standing outside the house opposite!) Hmm... hehe... cool idea for my 18th birthday party! Muhahahahaaa... *not that i'd invite anyone serious enough not to be that stupid anyway* Hehe, maybe I should say that to people. that would confuse them well enough!

 urlLink Political Compass Good news! I'm Economic Left/Right: -3.00 Libertarian/Authoritarian: -6.46 YEAAAAY! So I'm about six billion million miles away from Hitler and Stalin, but close to the Dalai Lama and Gandhi! I'm within walking distance from them! Yeay! Infact... I think I'll go and have some beer with them. Go check it out, but it is five pages so you do have to care *sorry peeps* But really... it is actually really upsetting what we're doing to the planet. Shit to all you who don't care, but some one's got to! urlLink http://www.stopesso.com/coverage/00000058.php Oh yeah, don't worry right, it's not our fault, right? It won't affect us, will it? I think we all deserve to roast alive. I think we are responsible for the starving, slavery and extinction. We screw the 3rd world countries. I guess that's why I'm a communist, I buy fair trade *Monsoon guys!* and free range. Oh. That explains a lot. Umm yeah... I'll have a moral rant later, let the rich people choke in their own selfish greed. :D

 ugh! my sis woke me up at 5:30 this morning cos she had kicked her covers off by accident while she was asleep, then woke up cold and took my covers cos she thought thy were hers. And thismorning we had an argument about her stupid babyish clock being up on the wall, i mean, for gods sake, its got bloody teddy bears on it and it is soo lame! Did u c mars last nite, the brightest star in the sky it was, closer to the earth than it has been for 60,000 years, i saw it, i thopught it was quite cool being able to see mars but the rest of my family weren't convinced, my sis shouted 'take me home, i wanna go home' when she saw it which was rather amusing to say the least. Still doing homework, it is soooo boring, but i don't get half of it so i need to ask some of my teachers to explain it to me. hee hee! extra time! thats about it for today. xx

 sounds painful, last nite i kicked the computer table, and now i have a bump on my shin, it looks quite funny!!...... went swimming this morning with my retns, wasquite fun but then had to go food shopping! : ( I h8 food shopping, it is the only type of shopping that bores the hell outta me! mmmm should be finishing my c/w and h/w but really can't be arsed to do so cos it is soooo boring! o well just gonna fiddle around on the net for a while. Am sorting out another webby at the mo, with geocities, www.geocities.com/fluorescent_frog, u can view it but it ain't quite finished. And don't worry, the link to 'My Blogger' doesn't come to this one, it goes to my other one that i haven't quite got ne one onto yet. may blog l8r.... xx

 Owchieee! I just head butted the computer! ... Let's not go into expinations ... (okay, okay, so I reached to put the phone on the floor, on it's charger and acidentally head butted it) Geez, I'm dangerous, lucky no one's here! Anyway, breaking away from my musings, err to the err still non-existant point. *yup i came on here to make myself feel stupid, i reaaaly need a computer for that* Anyhoo, only a week away till school! Aaah! Okay, so it kind of sucks stretching my brain when it could be rotting in front of the tv, but it is fun to be around friends and mess about!

 can neone think of a sign in name for me, something along the lines of pink panther, but i can't have turquoise tiger or lilac leopard.....xx

 Johnny Depp is cool in that maniac sort of way, he's bloody funny, but i still think that orlando bloom is gorgeous! Even my mum agrees with me!!!! be bck in a min to blog xx

 Orlando Bloom? Nuhuh! Johnny Depp! He's sooo cool in the whole stoned maniac role! *i love the freak dreadlocks and the eye stuff!* Orlando Bloom was waaaay too serious *and who cares if that's his character!* What was the girl thinking... it's Johnny Depp!

 yeah, nervous energy. a loada crap if u ask me. lalala! I actually have no idea what to write. Ooo! I saw pirates of the carribean yesterday. It is really good and quite funny and orlando bloom is as gorgeous as ever!!! then we went for a meal, which was really nice. Neway its not me who worries about my weight its my rents, but if u ask me i think they are just jealous! mmm, dunno what to put so will blog l8r when i mite have something interesting to say! xx

 Ahhh.... nervous energy huh? Guess I have a lot of that too... I fidgit loads! And Laura, you shouldn't worry about your weight! My plan is to leave it alone, hell it can do what it wants, I don't care! urlLink http://www.mess.be/ Muahhaaa... mess around with MSN! Umm sorry this has been up for ages and I'm trying to do loads of stuff! Better gosie...bi!

 hhhm, i have thought about that poemy thing, is it supposed to be about how we have come into this world and destryoed and everything horrible. hmmm.... i found out what nervous energy is.... apparantly it is has something to do with not be able to chill out and switch off so u burn alot of calories cos ur body wont relax or some thing along those lines.

 Hmm... feeling really deep and EUGH get me out of this mood! (You know?) It really is dangerous to leave me with myself... Anyway. Think about this. There are too many people in the world to hurt, Too many things to see. Stolen souls seek their lives, Children learn how to grieve. I'm surrounded by the ocean of ignorance, Floating on the statue of me. All the people have left the ocean. They've washed up on a beach full of rage. Wreaking havoc and destroying things, The leapt back into their cage. No on is ever free from the ocean, Enlightenment is learning how to float. It's the curse of all human beings, That we can't learn to build a boat.

 well, not much to say really. didn't get much sleep last nite so am very tired. My sis broke our bedroom door, so there was light coming thru, and my sis and dad were snoring and oh, it was dreadful, i finally got to sleep at 2:30am, and then joy of all joys, my sis woke me up this morning at 8 o'clock, refusing to get on the scales so that my parents could see how much she weighed. I then shouted very sarcasticly, Thanks for waking me up, and managed to wake my bro up aswell. And everyone's blaming me. I then found i have lost a pound in weight instead of putting it on and my dad ses it is because i have alot of nervous energy (will have to look up what that is in a min) and because i don't sleep very well. And he has finally admitted that i am not anorexic because i have eaten more than normal over these hols and have still managed to lose that pound. They wanna know the secret to losing weight but i don't know how i do it. be bck in a sec just gonna find out what nervous energy is............

 wahey! went shopping in The city centre for the 3rd time this week!! didn't get much, just stuff for school *BOO!*. am now bored outta my mind. am still really happy though.

I mean, I knew she was smart but i didn't realise quite how smart she was. Spent 50p credit which is all i had on my phone, txting tim about stuff. Thursday nite, got a phone call from robyn, the first time in ages i have actually spoken to her and not just emailed her or on msn msngr.

 Muhaha... swamped by coursework? I get my minions and slaves to do it for me! Muhahaaa! (You haven't done it yet, have you?) Nope. Last minute is more fun. Hehe... really should get that part of me kicked. Mmm... I know that everyone says it's better to get stuff out of the way, but for me it's something to do in the future... and when I have nothing to do... *not that I ever let that happen* I just feel wasted! Erm... yes... strange... Uhuh, probably some deep psychological problem running through there, but do I ever let that get in my way? Nope, being a rock suits me fine... *yup, gone* Anyway peeps and peepesses... *not that that is supposed to be offensive... not that that it... *yargh!** Yeah I have to go now... seeing as I actually have nothing to say... (!) Bisi.

 mmmmm......computer just crashd on me, that can't be a good sign. Has anyone else got so much coursework that they haven't breathed proper fresh air for about 2 weeks or something stupid. I am absolutely swamped. Although I have to say I am getting quite into my media studies coursework (its fun ain't it lynne!!), just generally rambling on about violence in society and the media and such. Its nice to have a good old rant!!!! mmmm.... i'm hungry, think i mite go raid the cupboards hang on a sec.....

My mum was going on about how Kate Winslet (who plays rose incase u didn't no) is such a good role model for young girls cos she ain't fat but she's not really skinny either.

 Err... is it! Yeay to Rhapsodyyy! (Weird band) Hey Lynne, if your back we have to do something! I was thinking about getting everyone to go bowling on Monday or something... or you know... a weird cult thing *...?* Just a thought! Anyway, I have to go try to get Larua H on this! Wait a sec...

 Its one hour behind us!

 JAM! i dont get Bloggers time!

 Helo!!! I am now going to write a proper blog whatsit becasue it is a nice break from doing homework. I know its 1/4 2 10 in the summer hols and im doing h/w, but it has to be done. I'm getting quite into it, scary!!! I like media studies ok?!?!? umm jam and Bread, sorry am eating my brekkie at the same time as blogging, its more fun that way. I had my teeth out yesterday. My Bum it hurt!! My mouth now only hurts where i had the injections put into it. I had lots of fun on my hols. Made friends with some tarts!! What? One of them wanted to b a pg3 model!! Then they went home and i met up with some mad people from Twickenham, the home of english rugby!! they were sooooooo funny. O there was a French kid who liked to sing or try and sing English songs, as u cna imagine i just laffed at him, because i am mean!!! xx

 Yeayyy Lynne is back! Woohooo! Someone else to live in the void of this!!! *trust me on this, the internet is a never ending void* I just hope I don't have a dream about getting stuck in it... I'm having weird vivid dreams. Last night it was a weird one about saving the Thunderbirds pilots from these 'villans' which was interesting... considering that I was trying to push this teeny 'car' along, when the people could have caught up with us in seconds... *don't worry, i bet i saved them... in the end.* Anyway.... how is everyone? Coping with the heat wave? *it just gives me an excuse for being lazy* I go through fazes of hyperness and lazyness, I guess it's when I think I have to try and when I don't! Mmm... I should start writing again, it's nice when no one tells you how bad at something you are. Muhaha, but I guess I'm not, confusion is a good point.

 You act like a 3 year old most of the time but you have a ton of talent stored inside you. You are passionate about the things you're good at and you love to have fun. You always have a cute stuffed animal beside you and you love to play around with it. You have a weird way of helping people, but you help them nevertheless.

 WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!! I hear u all cry Lynne is finally home!! Ok come on some enthusiasm w2ould be nice plz. Will tell u more later, but am being kicked off.

 You know those *oh shit i wish it wouldn't have happened to me* situations? I get into those a lot. I either speak my mind (to the wrong person), hit (the wrong or right person depending if it's a good day) or do something like that. And then I end up with one of my stupid apologies and run away. But it's not because I'm stupid *could be because I'm klutzy* it's more because I'm not afraid of people doing anything about it. Who cares who knows? I'm dangerous when I'm impulsive. It's not because I'm mean, it's just because I can't control what I say sometimes. *Damn impulses* It gets me into loads of trouble. And I've just been blocked! *Yeay! One down, and only a few thousand other people left who know of my existance!* But then... isn't it good to speak your mind? (I tend to do that sometimes) Most of the times it's my friend saying that she really wants to know my opinion about her new top, and me saying that I hate it. Their's a fine line between lying too much and hurting people. Don't you hurt people when you lie? WHO STARTED THIS DAMN THING OFF ANYWAY?!?!?!!!! *i blame cheese, it's always bad to eat it before you go to sleep* And then you end up thinking... maybe you should be left alone in that corner.

 He...he... I just was talking to someone on Msn... you know the whole, who the hell are they but they know you thing? That really gets annoying! Yeah but I'm a bit slow with names anyway, it takes me about three days and a whole load of sticky notes to actually process who someone is. Why do we need to remember names anyway, thingy will do won't it?! Umm... yes... I do have things to do I guess. Oh fine, I'll crawl away untill I can actually think of something!

 Ahh... lack of blogs... a. I've been feeling like a dot on a very big page recently... *start of life crisis!* b. I've actually been doing things! Okay.. so maybe not today... but I was planning to do something today! (Yeah, yeah) Oooh... I can hear out of my ear again! (it sporadically goes *i love that word... i don't care about grammer ok?!* and i can't hear... which is sooo annoying! it's like being . . . unable to hear!) Mmm... I guess I just need some 'aaah isn't it lovely doing nothing' time. Mind you... if I had my way I would probably end up doing nothing the whole time, and that isn't good! Thank you people for dragging me out into the big wild world! Uhuh, let's just say that I'm drunk, it's easier that way! *mind you, if i was drunk i could probably actually speel* Ahh, that's the life. Woah, I really don't make any sense at all, couldn't you have told me?!?!!

 Wait a minute... I am a viking is playing (yargh) It's a bit ... weird ... Ahh I'm sooo happy! My brother e-mailed form Peru! Wooowweeee! Luckily he hasn't broken his leg... arm... or head! *i get worried about stuff like that* It sounds like he's having such an amazing time! I wanna do something like that next year! Infact!!! I think I'll drag my friends with me ... hehe. He's drinking mate de coca which is cocaine leaves! Apparantly it helps with the aclimitisation *don't worry, I checked it, it's right.* But in Peru it's winter at the moment, *muhahaaa it's boiling here!* and the sun sets at 6! Aww, so it's actually quite cold, and seeing as he's near Lake Titicaca, which is the highest lake in the world, it'll be freezing! I have to go sooory... I'll blog later if I remember *slight chance then*

 Hideho. I went to the zooo today with my Dad! *okay, so maybe it was a little under our age.. maybe we were surrounded by parents with 2 year olds pointing and screaming. Oh wait... that was me.* Mmm... argh on Saturday I'm going in the morning to the Balloon Fiesta thingymejeeby at 5:30am (or something ridiculously early and annoying like that) Er... do you ever find that you don't think about what you say *okay so maybe i'm a bit tooooo loose* Or you just ...speak? (devoid of emotion. yup. the guys in white will be coming soon) Okay, so maybe I am amazed that we can speak! WOW! I'll be ...running away faster than a really really fast speeding bullet with 'wow this is fast' etched on it.

 Hihooo so anyway... my happy happy vibes go out to all you people out there! (So I'm left with all the bad stuff... greeeeat) Nah, I'm a happy vibe planet! *should have put plant, but didn't. You know, the erm - industry plant, not a green thing.* Yup, my confused happy vibes (just don't get them angry) Ooh no, that's scary! Uhh... weel how is everyone? Good, good. *imaginary conversation* He stood on your foot?! What??? Air fresheners are .... just CHEAP PERFUME!!!!! Umm... enough of this weirdness I have to go and be the perfect freak hostess *people are coming over* I have to save this weirdness and cultivate it MUHAHAAAA! *I'm actually going now, bisi!*

 Now for some stupid Yahoo news... *yawn* urlLink http://uk.news.yahoo.com/030802/80/e5hcu.html = Soldier sleeps in fridge to escape Iraq heat urlLink http://uk.news.yahoo.com/030801/80/e5epl.html = German police arrest man firing potato bazooka

 Ahh I keep having freaky dreams! (Do you want to know what's inside my head? I don't, it's too scary! *runs away*) ... ... Anyway! It all started one dark evening *...* Ok, so I was walking down this road with some people when I head this person scream "AMY NOOOOO!" and then I turned and saw a car run someone over, then there was a sound like someone hitting a football and the persons head flew off near to us. Then everyone started crying and saying "Amy's dead!" But when I looked at the face, I didn't recognise it, but I should have *I think it was my face!* so I started crying anyway. Oh, and the voice that shouted "AMY NOOOO!" was Amy... freaky huh? Ok... so maybe no one wanted to know at all! It's just too freaky! Get it away! Nooo! Then I had another dream where I was horrible and everyone was swearing at me and telling me to go away, so I asked someone "Am Ireally that horrible?" but I woke up before I got a reply! (I don't think I would have wanted to know anyway) Ummm anyway... I'll just be crawling away now to do homework...

 Heeeey I'm back *again, this is getting old now, isn't it?* Well anyway... London was sooo cool! I loved it! :D We saw Bombay Dreams! Which was really good, (ok so the plot was predictable and corny but hell, the music was good!) It's kind of one of these 'oh, this would be good for people who didn't know this moral lesson already'. It was one of the 'we can't be together' 'but i love you' things, you know? Good the first time, but predictable the next. Oooh, and what else did we do? Oh yeah, we saw Buffallo *how do you spell that!* Soldiers. It's probably the most depressing film that I've seen. Don't believe the reviews, they were calling it 'really funny' and 'like catch 22'. Catch 22 did not have all the gore and head screwy stuff that went on! It was a really sad.. and disturbing movie. Err, hell go blow yourself out if you want to watch it, but don't expect it to be funny! London is sooo amazing, it's full of loads and loads of different cultures, religions, languages! One day I heard Spanish, Italian, German, French, *and a whole load of languages that I couldn't even begin to understand (hindi), Japanese, Chinese! I loved it! The diversity was just soooo good, I love that *compared to Nailsea it's heaven*. Err also we went to Notting Hill, *there was a cool market* and I got this cool pathwork silk skirt for 5! Hehe I'm gonna love freaking people out with it... not that it's not cool... *hehe* Ahh I have fun wearing whatever I want in Nailsea *it has to be the most boring place in the whole world!!!*

 Aaahhh! Is there no one out there who actually wants to help us with our bloody coursework?!?!

 urlLink ChamJam.com - Home Shameless plug - sorry. Heheheee! My cousin is a 'event organiser', he invented Cham Jam! How cool is that?! Oh yeah, and he err kind of flunked some tests, but look how far you can get! Yeaaay! There is somewhere out there for me! *and not the mental hospital yeay!* Whoops... slightly supposed to be doing French coursework and Spanish... hehe.... whoops.

 Damn it! i wrote a really long blog yesterday cos i ain't been on for ages, and then the whole of the www crashed, as i was saving it, and so i was hoping it had wrkd but, obv, it didn't. Am feeling alot betta, for anyone out there who cares *which ain't any of u lot so y am i wasting my breathe* nah, just kiddin ya, i luv u all really!! *nows my chance while they have been lulled into a full sense of security!* Sorry, alter ego out burst there, a bit of a powermaniac ego, wants to take over the world...shut up ur ruining all my plans...thinks she can then take over the universe...shut up and i let u have half of it...i'm sorry, did i say take over the universe, i meant, er, she's taking up classes at university, he he?! My god think i am going crazy *either that or turning into kez* god, i wudn't be able to handle being kez, u no with the big bum, and the big brother, and the big pressure of stupidity!! *JOKE (for those of u stupid enough to think that i may just be a big bully)* right enough blabber, will hopefully c u lot tomorrow. xoxox

 Yeah... I'm taking Grade 5 this autumn! *Only 3 more to go!* No... no! Mustn't think that scarily! Ahh, I found the perfect GCSE Maths revision site! urlLink http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/lookaroundyou/quiz.shtml WARNING: Going on this site could damage your mental health. WARNING WARNING: If you're revising for GCSE Maths then your mental health is already damaged; click away! Ahhh... I'm lacking stupidity! Damn coursework! Actually trying to make me sane! I need dumb comedy... must find Monty Python!

 Hey! I'm jumping in the deep end for Grade 5 piano! *whatever that means!* Well... basically... I'm too good for it ( :P ) So errr... something's happening... let's not question what, I don't know! Ahahaaa... power *it's dangerous to give people my age a hockey stick* Now... I will go and write something to do with fish! Weeeeee!

 Wow... this is interesting. I'm having one of those 'and I've done what apart from pee today...?' days. You know? *I've got a really varied assortment of days!* Yup... then there's the psycho balloon popping blood day *see IT for futher details* and the help I've turned into a marinaded chicken day and I can't spell marinaded. Is that it? No really I'm sane! Don't adjust your volume control! *that isn't me screaming no!* But really... what have I done today! Wait a minute... I probably killed a small gathering of trees in maths today. ... ... Okay, so I destroyed a whole forest trying to work out what was going on! So sue me! *eeek, don't!* (Actually, me and Izzy put together probably destroyed the Amazon *shhh!*)

 FECK!!! Reading your blog Laura really scared me. I saw that you had said that anna had died in casualty and i thought u meant Anna W. I nearly started to cry and had to read it twice. Please in future when you are telling me that someone has died make it slightly clearer!!! Phew. I have had fun!! I cant believe it Emily and Samantha are obssesd with police men!?!?!? Flipping scarey and weird if you ask me. jenny and i had a lush pizza last night and i'm still sat her feeling hungry even though i have eaten loads of food. Ummmmm listening to J trousersnake and its that bit that Tom always sings!!! I like this bit. Its Rock your body by the way!!! oooo Now its travis. Umm period pains! I wish they didnt xist! xx

 am bored as hell. am supposed to be upstairs doing txtiles cw while rents are out but can't b bothered *i no, i am very lazy*. still not feeling well, but there's nothign i can do about it. kez did we get ne science homework on fri. if we did i still ain't gonna do it even if u do tell me what it is!!think i mite go adn curl up in bed bye xoxox

 Cool, my brother's going to be 18 this year! Proving that humans can survive anything! *If he can make it to 18, then I can make it to 60 easily!*

 urlLink ALFY - Arcade - Adventure Games - Pang PANGGGGG! PANG PANG PANG PING PONG! This is sooo cool, I love this game, but Izzy's crap at it!

 Yeay for not shaving legs! (Seriously considering taking sociology next year.) Then you can learn how shitty our whole society is! Wohooo! *Stupid globalisation* Hmm... but is it better than anarchy though? In Russia one of my friends was trying to convinse me that anarchism is good... we have a big argument, fun! Anarchy is based on the idea that people don't go out and kill, rape, steal. Let's face it, if that didn't work for the Vikings, Stone age people etc. why's it gonna work now? And how come we've evolved to be like this, a non-anarchy society. I don't wanna devolise! From human to fish... nasty.

 Kes ur ranting again dear! am sooo glad u can come lynne, tis gonna be alot of fun, am gonna go up shops 2moz after skool and get some sweets and magazines and stuff. dunno what else to write *god my life is sooo boring!* ooo...my necklace has strange powers. whenever i take it off i seem to injure myself greatly. its really wierd. cos at cdts the other nite i had to take it off and i buggared my hip *damn staying still in the bushes and bracken and stinging nettles for 1/2 an hour* and i took it off this morning to have a shower and cut myself with my razor about 5 times cos i dropped it hit my wrist tummy and toe and cut them all and then when doing my legs i cut myself again. *damn idealistic images of female with super smooth legs!* i say we protest and don't shave *better wait until the skirt and shorts season is over and we can wear trousers in P.E. just to make sure* okay maybe i did have more to say. will shut up now. xoxox

 Bloggers changing everytime that i go on it... scary!! Well we dont have to go to school untill 11 so i am using my time productivly by revising and going on the internet. I'm like superman i can do two things at once. 2 days and counting till Kilve :) xx

 Ahh sorry guys... I'm so clumsy, I lost the post! Yup, clever but clumsy. *sometimes people get those mixed up* I hate being clumsy though! One mistake and things can go wrong, the repercusions. Don't worry, I try at school, but at home I let it all hang out. Sadly, I end up walking into door frames because of this slight 'technical error' - arms mainly, they're annoying. Mmm... slightly ever so slightly changing the subject... don't you just love hearing about other people's trails of thought? Like how you get from crackers to elephants. Err, actually that would be quite hard! I'd probably do crackers - wallace + gromet - moon - cheese - mouse - elephant. Watching tv. Bratz adverts. Feel like killing makers of Barbie. Damn stereotyped ultimate women - big boobs, completely ditzy and 'available'. Real ultimate women - friendly, lovable, UGLY! Who care if you've got a texan zit on your eye! I hate this stupid programme on Sky 1 *don't worry, it's american* about this women trying to find her ultimate date, by meeting them, but they've got masks on, and her they unmasking her 'chosen one' (yup, it's star warrrs!) then if he's ugly, dumping him. *breathhheeee...* How damn stupid is that! If I find my ultimate man to be 'ugly' I think I might kick everyones stereotyped backsides and burn every diet book, and glossy magasine in sight! Infact... I'm gonna do it anyway! Death to Barbie! *note to self: search for anti-barbie website. not to self: join it.*

 urlLink So You Want To learn Japanese... Hehe, now that's a funny website! *Read it all!* Then you hit the bottom... "I love the Japanese language, and I think everyone should give it a try. You should just be ready for a whole lot of pain.TM" Scary huh? Oh well... on with the torture I guess! *It gets kind of boring knowing how to write screeech and thud in kanji... *ahh yes, unflipped manga... *drools** Oooh... just learnt that the little hiragana characters next to the kanji are for kids who don't know their characters so they can pronounce them! Clever huh? Yeah... yeah... I'll run out of battery power soon don't worry. Ooh... go to this website too: urlLink http://maddog.weblogs.com/ It's also weird but good... gotta go read stuff!

 Owchie my head hurts... I've been up for too long (sleepover) Yup, that's understandable, ne? And I'm thinking too much, that's really annoying. At least I haven't got the freaky eye thing when you can't concentrate on anything and your eyes wonder everywhere! Yeah, I freak people out when I do that and try to talk to them! *but the walls are sooo interesting!* Ahh I need a new head... *optional donations of pink matter are ... optional* If you had a chance to 'choose' your kid, then would you? Wouldn't that be like expecting them to be like something without even knowing them, I would hate to live in that society! Every one would expect you to look pretty and get good grades, they'd expect that from everyone. And what if because of your environment you were a failure? Would your parents have a right to blame you and punish you? Ahh, don't you just hate 'the west' sometimes too?

 Kes!!! shut up!! wot the hell r u on about. I mean, i thought some of the stuff i wrote was random! but that just tops it really. I don't want to be put in a glass box and dropped into the ocean, i want to fly in the sky in a giant pink bubble, in which i have all my belongings and a lifetimes supply of sugary stuff!!!!!! hee hee!!! xoxox p.s. the school should be made out of liquorice and chocolates and sherbet....

 Hmm... don't you recon that we should all be put in a glass box and dropped into the ocean *seperatly of course* And er... maybe we should be rescued. *maybe* Ahh heck, does everything have to have a reason? *not with me* What? I'm sick of school already? Well that didn't take long! It is crap though... maybe if it was made of marshmellow and jelly I would like it. Mmm... but then everyone would like it. *don't worry guys, i'm sure it would be vegan jelly and marshmellow*

 yeah! u think having fights with emma about who has the biggest butt is silly, welll, last nite we were arguing over who would make a better barbie!!!! Lynne, practising for the ball!!??? we've still got god knows how many months til the ball u do not need to practise now!! erm.... we have a new washing machine, was rather disappointed though cos neither of the delivery guys were fit, one was old, and the other had stupid sideburns and worse roots than me!!!!! gotta go bye xoxoxoxo p.s. kt they r not fish they are hugs and kisses!!!! hee hee!!

 AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!! Blogger made me type in my password and i had forgotten it again, thank goodness i kept the email that told me it, how else am i meant to know that my password is laurasmells, only joking it's not really. I am going to Jens Laura and yes i will somehow copy Coyote Ugly, u may have to wait a few weeks though as dad is rather busy, and if i did it there would probably no longer be a copy to copy from!!!! I have been sat watching Hollyoaks this morning with rollers in my hair. I know look like an olde world french girl!!!! It looks better if they are tighter, am practising for the ball!!!! OMGOODNESS!!! Did u c popidol last nite, some of the blokes were well fit!!! The girls were really good singers however. My mates dumped/been dumped by her boyfriend not sure which yet. To KATIE if u come online before three today and read this do you want to share lifts to Jens if u r going??????? xx

 Oh, sorry I haven't been posting a lot. I've been manic present buying! (I had to get them for three people!) Hehe, I got a key ring that says - Jesus loves you, every one else thinks you're an ass hole. Muhahahaaa.... that's for big ass Emma! *aww i don't mean it really! it's a running joke!* We have big butt arguments in school... totalllly normal! (For us anyway) Yup, us, I drag people into trouble by saying that a lot. Well I'm actually supposed to be with my parents so I'll go. So long and thanks for all the fish.

 y hasn't ne one been on?? are u lot goin to jen's tomoz, if u r good, if not boo hoo! *secretly screaming YES!YES!YES!* Lynne if u cum online tonite, bring ur Coyote Ugly CD tomoz. Is it possible that u cud copy it for me at some stage, i will pay the price of the cd to copy it onto. I was still singing One way or another on Friday, and i saw matt in the computer room and got the tune back into his head!!!!! Hee hee! Erm... i still reckon its a pre C18th Barbers to those of u who know what the hell i'm on abou! hee hee again.!! gonna go and sort out my geocities webby a bit more!! bye xoxoxox

Lynne Were u on thisevening? soz i missed u if u were! *stupid washing machine people* I have managed to change some of the colours and fonts on my blog thingy. take a look at it if u like the colours are very erm.... interesting as for some reason it would only let me use some colours and not the others. its http://angelicsweetheart.blogspot.com and my other webby is www.geocities.com/fluorescent_frog but that one isn't finished yet. xx

 HEYLO!!!!!!!!! I really must stop spelling hello like that other wise i will write it really wrong one day. AHHHHHHH first day back at school. If that is what the rest of the year is going to be like i want to leave now!!! School i mean, nothing else. sorry im going weird or am weird rather. Sooooo science is alright maths is well maths and english is blurgh. Better go. xx

I got told off for admitting to shoving the little kids outta the way cos i was late for tutor time. *ggrrr, stupid rents, stupid little kids, stupid school, stupid town...etc* Lynne, I agree u should write on here more often. As for the swimming thing, when it comes to making excuses i am not going to emma's party, me and my family are going to my 'cousins christening' so that my bro can get out of it aswell. okeydoketey!! *oo there's a butterfly in our conservatory* Oops! sorry! got a bit distracted there, with the flapping and the colours and the flapping and the colours and o my god the flapping!!!!!!!!! Katie i am a good girl, i have already done my chemistry, its fairly easy actually and hardly takes anytime at all *oo felt like i was on Blue peter saying that last bit, 'And here's one i made earlier kids!'**cough**cough* NEEEWAY!!!! can't think what else to write so am just going to blabber for a little bit.... blabber blabber blabber blabber blabber blabber... ok bored of that now. bye bye xx

 Ahh... feeling a bit useless today. (I guess the first day back at school can do that to you) I guess I'm jsut feeling a bit distant from people... I hate it when that happens. This DAMN sound in my ear doesn't help either! It's constantly bubbling, and I can't hear out of it! But it's sooo cool... it's like the sound of the ocean constantly! Wow, I have a ocean in my ear! Oh well... on to my search for veruca treatments! (First I have to check how to spell it!) I'm really really sure you don't wanna know how this goes... so I'll be running away *don't worry, I have socks on!* Not really... muhahahaaa.

 Right! I've lost a blog... sorry about that! Don't worry I'll come up with a compact form: (Now you can carry it everywhere with you!TM) ... pancakes ... Mars ... fish ... See! My words can be compressed! I don't really waffle on and on, do I? (Mmm waffles.) Ahh... just thinking about life I guess. It's never easy is it? There is no multiple choice answer... there's always consequences to unseen actions. It's never black and white because black is white, and white is black. (Hah! Got em confused! Now to add a clever 'money saving' offer... muahhaaa) *sigh, just when you thought I had brains* Hehe, I like to keep them hidden though, everyone thinks differently of you if you don't. Ahh! Look Around You is on DVD! Who wants to get it for me first? :P I will... I will... I have to fuel my brain with more randomness! It's kind of nice to think that other people get your humour. And annoying when people don't get when you're not being serious *i'm sure that gets everyone else into trouble as well* Gary Jules - Mad World. It's a good song, sounds like it should be in a movie though...

 I'm just... searching for something. Don't mind me.

 I think I'd rather do coursework than tidy my room! Ahh that is... err... not sure about physics coursework! I couldn't write simple sentences. Science is tooooo confusing sometimes. Eek Halloween aye, sad to say I'm not doing anything! But my brothers going to a party dressed in a business suit, that's enough to scare me for today. No one's really making a fuss over Halloween anyway, so it's alright. *sob sob* (And I could have worn my usual clothes!) :P

 No, no, no ur both wrong, the best film is Pirates of the Caribbean. U can't get betta than having both Orlando Bloom and Johnny Depp in the same film!!! YAY! Hallowe'en 2morrow, and i'm going round samanthas, but first i have to go into weston to return my shoes *DAMN BIG FEET*, then i have to go to the gym with samantha *DAMN IDOLISTIC VIEWS*, and then i have to get the stuff for hallowe'en and put on my false nails *DAMN ME ANNA AND SAMANTHA FOR OUR IDEAS*. O god i'm busy, and i've hardly done any of my coursework, and i had to spend the whole of today tidying my room. anyway rant over c ya soon xoxox

 Naah, Hot Shot (is that what it's called?) Is cooler! It's a total spoof on American Vietnam films, and stuff like that in general. It's sooo cool. (Or it is at 11 at night, I can't really tell what it would be like when you're actually awake) Ahh... but are you anti-army? It wouldn't work having a world of pacifists, because then idiotic villians would take power. When it comes down to it, the only thing that will get you power is money and violence. Ha, what a great view on the world. I suppose there are people that do good, but there is always an opposition to them, so do they cause that opposition? Wooh. Getting a bit too confusing now. (My mum's reading about quantum physics, and evolution, I guess I get it from her!)

 Wow! I went flying today, I went once in the morning and then the people for this afternoon didnt show up so I went up again. I can now loop the loop and do a barral roll!!! I also watched Top Gun. Its such a good film: fast planes, one fast bike and 1 rather young and hot looking Tom Cruise. You will be forced to watch it at somepoint!! Hee hee!!! Its very good. xx

 urlLink http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/cinema/features/experiment.shtml They did this for real. Gave some guys some weapons and 'authority' and the others chains. What happened? Human nature? The guys acting as the 'police men' started acting violently towards the 'prisoners' and the experiment had to be stopped. Apparantly there was an experiment where people were told to listen to people answering questions, and press 'yes' or 'no' according to the answer that they gave. If they pressed no, then they would hear screaming, as if the person had been given an electric shock. But the person in the white coat behind them told them that it was ok, so they kept going, until the screams stopped. Human nature? Or the corruptive effect of power?

 Anyway... sorry got on a moral high point, and needed to rant. I'll err... try not to next time. (Well, I will anyway) Ahh too much stuff going on in my head. Anyway, I need to go downstairs bibi

 Hmm... should we mean what we say and not say what we mean? I can't remember what way around that goes! It's scary that people don't mean what they say... I know that people do, but does that mean that we should question everything they say and the value of their words? (Yup, about four years of thinking) Ahh... it's scary. Our world's so capitalist. People just want your money. Apparantly it's fine to screw the third world, so long as we benefit. But what if we were born differently. What about the third world? Yeah, they might be poor, but that's through no fault of their own. They could be the next superstar if they were given the chance. I'm willing to bet that if they were where I am they wouldn't be sitting around, they'd be grabbing every oportunity, because they know what it's like to have none. Is life too easy for us? All we have to do is selfishly go to McDonald's, paying 99p for food that's destroying the world around us. Just think for a second, what did they have to do to get the price to 99p? How many people did they rip off? We have the money to pay for fair trade, yet we selfishly keep it to ourselves. All because we were born here. What rights should we have because of birth place? Because of a fusion of egg and sperm we are somehow viewed differently by society and have more prospects. In this world money is all that matters. Only people who have too much of it do good with it. Why do we refuse to spread money equally, giving everyone a fair chance to eat and grow? Why do people die from obseity when others die from famine? Why can't I stop it?

 another product u could try is toffee peaches, although i have a horrible feeling they may possibly already make something along that line...YUK.... Sounds revolting! *YAY* My rents have bought LOTR; Fellowship of the ring on video!! it was 5.99 in Safeways!!! It was cos we went shopping, i got a witches hat, flase nails, new coat, new school shoes, new book, headfones, wot else, i'm sure there was something but i can't for the life of me think what is was. O well, i got alot, and only spent 6 of my own money (Ihad 50). It kinda stupid cos i spent 6 of my own money and about 35 of my parents!!! am going swimming tomorrow woth samantha and anna, YAY!!! then my grandparents are visiting on sunday, going round emma's on monday, tues i'm free, and weds and thurs, fri i'm going to samanthas, and sat i'm going to annas, and then sun i'm free, and i have to fit in c/w at somestage!! o dear.... its all so hecktick (?spelling?). bye xoxox

 "Never open that trap doooooor! There's a monster down there!" WOOOW! Doesn't anyone else remember that kiddy tv show? And 'Stop It and Tidy Up' Ahhh... that was amazing! (Doesn't sound like it, but it was) Well... I'm feeling better, but I'm free from school cause of holidays, so I'll be running around like an idiot anyway *ah well* Actually, I think I'll act dead for a few days, then go on a hyper sugar streak of activity *mostly running around buying chocolate bananas* Mmm... random. Heeey that would be lush! Chocolate bananas! And... and... strawberry cheese! Wow, I should totally become some one in the food industry! 'You don't need to diet when you've got Katie's TM R PQC food near you' Muhaha.... dieting fools, I shall rule the world! (Funny how most of my blogs come back to ruling the world)

 Ahh... Lynne's taken over the blog! (Sorry, we tried to restrain her!) Oh, I'm ill... so I actually have an excuse for my random babblings and lack of english. I've got a bad cold. :( And instead of going in and spreading it, I thought I might stay at home. (Aww, aren't I nice) Yup, that would also explaint he weird lack of mood I'm in... you know... where you don't really know what your feeling? Angry and sad are easy emotions to know, they camp out at my house sometimes. Mmm... I really want an ice cream cone covered in chocolate... anyone offering to get me one?

Aaah, I love their music! We danced the whole time... ok, we didn't dance we just moshed! Yeay! The sideliner guys were 'Simple Kid' (?) They were reaaallly good, but they were on first and the whole crowd just wanted OCS so no one danced! There was a age gap of about 14-50 in the crowd! (But we got everyone dancing!) I loooved the atmosphere, everyone's so happy and jumping madly! I'll have to go see another gig, you should too! *brainwashes you into watching OCS* *adds some polish for good measure*

How unfair?! so i am just gonna have to stick to my crappy geocities one... www.geocities.com/fluorescent_frog Don't ask about it being fluorescent frog, its supposed to be like pink pather but no one ever picks up on it, so neva mind, no one goes on it anyway cos its soo crap and i haven't up dated it for about 3 months!!! aaah well, thats my complaint. More under 18 websites for creating websites for free!!! xoxox

 Isn't it amazing what a game of Tony Hawks PS2 skateboarding against your brother can do? (Ahh, don't worry, you'll have to read that about four times to figure out that it's actually metaphorical for: I want to eat your chocolate cake.) Mmm... but yeah, having people care can solve anything! (But chocolate solves more) Back vile stoumach! Ew... have you washed recently? A bit of acid's leaking... (Oh that, hehe, that's nothing.) Oh wait... YAAARGHHH! And yes, I'm board. WOOHOO! It's ... Tuesday ... Did anything interesting ever happen on Tuesday?

I'm a Philosopher/Scientist! urlLink Which Enemy of the Christian Church Are You? urlLink Take More of Robert & Tim's Quizzes urlLink Watch Robert & Tim's Cartoons Ok, ok, I didn't say how less random it was! *sorry* Just had the whole atheist / theist / agnostic thing today. (or was it yesterday?) *that's not the point!* It was another of our schools 'we should be christians, let god come and clean his finger nails with you' thing. Why do we have to do so much christianity in RE, yeah sure it's the national religion, but what about all the other religions? I've had about 11 years of christianity! Aaahhh! I think I'll stick with being an atheist thank you very much. Now take your lemon and leave!

 I WILL STAND IN THEIR WAY! Get that egg head out of there! Ahh I love the conservative party... they really inspire me to go against them all the way! You see... I am more of a communist than George Bush's IQ score. (Which could make me very conservative.) Empathy for all! I hate the whole right's view of 'bugger everyone else I'm getting out of here' it's closer to anarchy than my blue socks. (Yup, it's a random day) Doesn't everyone just love my words of advice? (Don't you mean commands of acceptance) Well... maybe... Ahh but I've decided that if the Conservative party becomes the next goverment or if the BNP get any seats I'm moving to Cuba. And I'm taking my cats with me! Actually... I think I might leave them in Britain and infect some pain on the people. MUHAHAHAAA! Nah... I couldn't live without them! I'm gonna kidnap them and hide in my flat when I go to London. Actually... I think my parents will willingly throw them at me when I go! They're so cute, but no thanks to the load of dead animals! Ahh, not that I can't handle dead things, but it's just kind of waste. I bet they're causing an extinction in rare birds near us or something like that. I LOOOOVE MY CATS!

 "Some day mom, I'm gonna get a real job" But until then, I'll just slob around.

 Well... it's the moment of truth... I've decided on my ball dress... I'm gonna get a *insert fancy crap that no one understands here* black dress and cover it in... CANDY FLOSS! YEAAAYYY! (And who cares if I get followed by rats all the way home!?) Umm... but people might notice the flies... HEEEY! How about a bine liner dress! Ahh... people just don't bother to follow fashion do they? Or... a superman outfit! *new and improved* i.e. cut up scab clothes. Seriously, I don't care! Everyone's getting worked up, well, know what? Mine's gonna be free apart from the top cause I'm recycling stuff! Muhahaaaa... the ultimate freak strikes again!

 I have issues with... innocence submission women intelligence nature urlLink Take Word Association Test Wow! I have issues! (actually, I wasn't paying any attention, I just got into a kind of left right clicking pattern. I hate getting into patterns. They itch my skin.) Wow, pretty weird today huh? Ahh well I've had a kind of weird day! I told people about stuff that five miles down the line people weren't supposed to have told me. And I've been pessimistic. I hate being pessimistic! It sucks! Come on people, mindless enthusiasm! I will get out of school.. I will... maybe. It err... probably killed a few people but never mind! Muhahaaa... I think I'll go... hmm... light some candles! *don't know how to play kumbyahh, don't even know how to spell it!* I have to learn it on the guitar for all those camp fire oops i set alight to the house again times!

 'It can be done, It should be done, It will be done.... TOMORROW!' hee hee, i keep finding all these random cool sayings. I got my history coursework in on time *its a miracle*, and he still gave us hmwk today which we all thought was rather unfair, especially as we have had less time to get ours done than everyone else. hang on, someone has just come online who i must talk to......never mind then, they had to go moreorless as soon as i started talking to them. Lynne, i cna think of many people who wud love to see the back of ian at cdts. Me, my brother, matt, kristian, mike, carrie.... and the list goes on.... face it he is annoying everyone but you. and he is bullying me, bullying means anything that is insulting, rude or abusive be it mental, physical or verbal. He is always insulting me and being rude and calling me names, he tried to spit in my ear the other nite, and he constantly treads on my feet, trips me up and he tried to knock me off my chair the other day. Thats verbal and physical already. and mental, well, he is driving me the afore mentioned. No one likes him. there. thats betta. c ya 2moz xoxox

 Hmm... *considers moaning about Adidas* ... *instead decides to discuss the relevance of cheese newsletters* Hehe... I need to find one on the net to send to a friend, because she's got me signed up with a buddhist newsleter! Aaargh! urlLink http://www.geocities.com/athens/parthenon/1251/newsletter2.html Uhuh...

 Geez. 9D. Isn't that a stupid size. *No, it's not a bra size* It's my stupid non-fittable feet! The ones destined to be coated in gold and stared at in awe - not to have shoes put on them. Why D? D for deranged, D for different, D for Dennis. Eventually, after about one hour in the Clarke's shop, and about five different people.... I HAVE SHOOOOES! Now all I need is socks, pants, a top and trousers and I'm fit to live in this world. I may have killed five slave labour children who were hurt when the shoes fell on them and killed them, but I finally have some. Hmm... on Sex in the City they have this whole shoe shopping fetish that goes on... *dramatic sigh... kind of like huh but more like oohioha* If only they sold stuff for big footed people *my bro's a size 13* Now that's manic!

 WOW! Jess's Party was soooooo much fun last nite!!! and the lady let me keep my bright pink boa thing, which is quite cool! Am gonna wear it to da nxt party *sorry to claire in advance!!* and on the nxt non-school uniform day *sorry to all of u in advance!!!* What's this stupid thing that has appeared on our blog about taking a 15 min survey, probs a load of crap if u ask me!!!! Lynne u don't have to worry bout coming 2 netball, it doesn't bother me whether u come or not, i am sure i can find somebody i no there, cos lisa and lucy will definitely be there, and i'm sure phillipa will be there this time aswell. okay rite.... ooo ooo ooo cool saying: LOVE UR ENEMY, IT WILL DRIVE THEM NUTS!!!!!! bye xoxox

 When you wrote that it yesterday would have been friday would it not, laura?? I don't think I did anything or anything happened in the quad on Friday, o well question me about it anyway!!!

 Sorry I never realised that you had come online Laura!! Any way what had happened in the quad, did it involve Kev by any chance??? Please tell me then I can clear it all up for you!! Hee hee. I'm all prepared for maths am now trying to learn all this medicine through time stuff, does anyone really care who invented this that adn the other. I mean yeah its good that it happened and all but who really cares??? Am listening to Meat Loaf, yay, do you know that I'm pretty sure hes a vegetarian!!! Useless fact there for you! Had better go, public health through out the ages is calling!!! xx

 Yeah, revising time! (That's good cause I get a load of yummy food to keep me high!) First we've got a maths non-calculator, which is okay so long as they don't expect our brains to act like a calculator, or anything clever. I'll try kicking the blog again to see if it'll work, or maybe I'll show it some revision stuff. *muhahahaa*

 u r sooooo weird lynne! this blogger is really stupid. it still ain't working properly, its showing blogs that u 2 have put but not the ones that i have written which gets me very confused as i have a memory like a seive and can never remember whether i have already written a blog today or not. I was online earlier i no that, and so were u lynne but u bugarred off as soon as i signed in *highly suspicious if u ask me considering u probably knew i was gonna pester u about what was going on in the quad yeaterday* actually thats a point, what was going on, i tried to get izzy and pete to talk, but no amount of tickle torture seemed to work *just kidding*. have finished my forever friends x-stitch, and am now starting a geisha *for those of you whose cultural knowledge is lacking, a geisha is basically a chinese/japanese (can never remember which) lady* It is so cool! but quite hard. it is my present for agreeing to go thru with the needle. my trousers should be coming on tues or weds so i will wear them when they get here. I am sooo glad the hardest exam is over first, but i am beginning to doubt the difficulty of the paper, of course, i am talking about maths non-calculator. rite am gonna stop wittering now. xoxoxox

 Well heloooooooo ladies!!! hee hee have again gone potty, a bit like yesterday!! Wot was going on in neighbours at the end??? Gros or gors, actually it was natural the birds and the bees blah blah blah, lalalala u can t get me down.

Final question; do you need to go and revise the history of medicine, get off the the intrnet and charge your phone??? (me.....)Ummmmmmmm .............mayby, Oh ok, YES!!! See how mean I can be when I want too!?! I'm actually trying to make some labels for my nan for her christmas cards so that she doesnt have to write lots of adresses and hurt her hands!!! But will the computer make 21 labels? NO ahhhhhhhhhhhh, it only makes 18 per sheet. Grrrrrrrr. Ho hum; breath in breath out, kick someones backside breath in and out. Thats a bit better. Did anyone see that program on Jonny last night?? I videoed it for Anna, its very interesting, gets a bit boring in the middle, good music, fit men and a rugby ball!!! Would I not make a great film critic?? Actually dont answer that one! Right had better rocka'n'roll, o by the way Laura ignore chris or talk 2 him about planes and get it all wrong, he can then tell u all about them and correct u. I recon he gets turned on by planes!! Hee hee!!! xx

 It's undeaded now *the blog works yippieee!* Well... kind of! We now have mocks, which include two weeks study leave, which includes the mocks. So basically, we're doing tests one every day with breaks. No time to relax kiddo, this is study hell. Ahh, so I might come on later in the week, and if I'm acting drunk, I won't be *i hope* I'll just be stressed. Actually, I might be drugged up on herbal medicene. No really, this is herbalist stuff. (or mate de coca... hmm, tough choice)

 thats annoying, wrote a blog earlier on in media studies and its not here....mmmm..... o well. Had a bad day i have. i had everyone trying to chuck me outta the quda for no reason that they would tell. I had dan throwing my baubles in my face and trying to pick me up. i had emma take my shoe and put it in the tree. i had everyone just generally being rude and mean. i don't understand. and then when i got home i had to do my papers and i put one to the wrong house (by accident obviously). o well, lynne i have just been talking o chris it was totally random. ermm. dunno what else to put really i'll go now bye xoxoxoxoxoxoxox

 Ahh... slightly been neglecting this! Sorry! Just been kind of lonely, which makes a bored non bothering me. Woohoo! Also, I've been wondering what the deal is with the obsession that teenage mags have with people farting? Seriously! *no, seriously* It's really quite weird, and it's not like you can not fart! (Hands up who've tried) Yeay, now I'm talking about farts and you've freaked out yourself / the neighbours / your goldfish! Woohoo! Yes, I really can get around to talking about anything. Ahh, but I've mellowed out a bit, which isn't good! (Hmm...) Other excuses: I was eaten by aliens. I am an alien. The dog ate it. (Wait a sec, I don't have a dog!) Noooo! Ah, I could try my brother ate it, he tried to eat my English book once! Ah, actual excuse: I've got mocks next week! AAAHHHH! These are mocks, not mock mocks, which makes them confusingly kind of important *i'm gonna wing it like i always do* Yeay! Oh, and I've got... wait a sec, new excuse... I've got a concert today! I get to HIT a BASS DRUM! Now, that's something to be proud of! It is kind of hard though, you have to count the bars, and when you end up going 43 2 3 4 44 2 3 4 you get a bit lost! I'm always one beat out! *oops* Yup, I mess up the whole thing, YEAY! Ahh it'll be fine though, like everything else *ignorance is bliss*

 WAAAAAAAAAAAAHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Jonny Wilkinson and Jason Robinson are legends!!!! We kicked some serious butt today, however the match was a bit nail bitting at sum stages, especially when extra time was called. Sorry Katie, I'm talking about the rugby incase u hadnt noticed!! Ummm lalala, chamions! Chamions! lalala....... Went out this alvo, was very cold. xx

 'Somewhere in Texas there's a village missing it's idiot.' Heheeeheeee... NOFX are cool!

 katie, ur def gonna be a homocidal illiterate maniac, it suits u to a t (what that saying means!!!). i don't think i'll be gettin food while i'm there, unless i beg and plead and say its part of some sort of coursework that we have to try some sort of local cuisine!!!!!! i don't normally mind hospitals as long as it doesn't involve needles or long waits (like yesterdays long wait). i can't believe its three weeks and 4 days. (its on monday 15th dec for u deaf people who can't hear ranting about it at school!) its the last monday of term, and i wont be in for most of that week but hopefully i'll make it in for the last day. yay, we have a non school uniform day on friday, i need to find out what everyone is wearing *just so we dont have a repeat of what happened with me and emma during our yr 10 exams*. I have wearing my jeans, a black top of some sort (depends which one i feel like wearing) and my bright blue hooded fleece. katie please wear ur cool knitted top, if not give it to me!!!! *and i'll conveniently forget to give it back to you for the next 20 years!* aaah... for the days when i was young and carefree and could wear wot i wanted with out some one saying something and being a bitch!!! I take u are coming to claire's suprise party that isn't a suprise party, if dan can persuade his parents!!! it was originally dan's idea and then we both made a guest list, and claire was sat between us with out a say in the matter. ne way must stop ranting and ranting and ooooo.......... sorry went off into a world of me own then (you dont wanna know what i was thinking). rite. rite. rite. erm. bye xoxox

 Aww Laura!!! Poor youuu! I hate hospitals, but apparantly the eye hospital has good food! *Yeah right, like that can ever happen!* Oh, Mr Linnet/Linnit/Linnitt is back! *AAAHHH!* He was on paternity leave, which is really cool! Fathers should get time to spend with their new kids! Dad's don't get to see enough of their kids! *Ahh it's a pro-dad thing!* Yes, when I'm older I'm gonna... not be a dad. Sadly, I think at most I'm gonna be a mum *sigh*. Yeesh that was scary to say! Nah, I'm more likely to be a homocidal iliterate maniac! *Yeay!* Aww, and they don't give careers advice on it! (Do I get a CIA record now or later?)

 ur pc is a freak. i went to the hospital today, as u probs no already considering i wasn't in school!!! was not fun at all, i spent 3 1/2 hours there, saw 4 different doctors and nurses, and done so many tests my eye aches. was quite funny seeing how bad my eye was. i got a date for my op though but u will have to wait til tomoz to find out more so that nearly everyone finds out at the same time. *sorry anyone who doesn't walk my way* but i can tell u i will be getting a whole week off skool!!!!!!! YES!!!! wot did i miss at school today?! Has mr linnitt taken down that stupid dragonfly yet and does he want our coursework in now cos i think i may have lost all the graphs!!! o well, how was biology katie? lynne, how was media? and of course i can't ask claire how was maths and english but i'll say it anyway!!! i did a quick iq test thing the other day and i think my iq was something around 145/150 but i can't remember. was quite amazing actually. c ya 2 moz xoxox

 ...What's up with my pc? It's finally found out that there's more to the internet than it thought. It's suddenly found the backrounds for pages and annoying little extras like that that it's been missing. Maybe it just got lonely. Ahh, some nice person probably came and fixed it during the night *aren't burgulars nice?* Oh, about my last post. Sorry, but d. was probably a sane answer! I mean, who wouldn't beat up margret thatcher? Who actually wears blue on the day of the elections? *apart from the poor little dogs that ian duncan smith has employed to help promote the conservative party by making them wear blue poncho's* Ahh, but it's not him anymore is it? It's that vampire guy... Michael... Howard? *if he's a childrens tv presenter, sorry!* On the topic of politics... urlLink http://uk.news.yahoo.com/031115/325/ee1zu.html Only one in three think that George Bush is stupid?! Come on guys! He thought Wales was a state in the US! What type of idiot leader doesn't know their own country!

 katie, u've been ranting again!!! the body shop party was sooo kool. i can't believe how much money we spent *tho i don't think it matches the bill we rang up for all the food we ate when we went to St Caths for Drugs Awareness eh Lynne?* ne one no where i can get a cheap t.v. that hasn't been stolen, broken, hidden cameraed (?), etc.... me and my sis want one for christmas but we don't want to have to spend more than 50 pounds between us. (other wise most of our money will be gone) in answer to that test question thing katie if i was doing the test i wud probs have to say (C)! thats sounds about normal for me. I have missed cdts thisevening and am obviously having with drawal symptoms as i have spent the whole evening doing h/w *so what if it was fun, cos it was txtiles, its not rite to spend the whole evening doing it!* rite g2g, will blab more tomorrow during Media!!!!!!!!! xoxox

 Heeey... I feel like some random violence. Anyone seen my mob? *Hey GUYS! Over here!* Nothing quite like some random violence to kick someone's credit card up the ass. (Don't worry, it'll be fair trade anti-globalist violence, nothing too drastic) *or sanatising* Hmm... sanatising... weird word. I mean it in the sanity way. (I wonder if I'd pass a shrink test?) I honestly think that no one would! We're just lucky cause no one's asked us to take it yet! *muhahaaa fools!* Uhh well not it my present state of mind. Actually... they'd probably put test questions on like: An old lady comes up to you in the street. Is she... a. following you with her rabies infested dog. b. brandishing a knife behind her back. c. not there, you're hallucinating again. d. margret *damn i'm proud at not being able to spell that!* thatcher and you're about to do some bodily harm to her because of it. e. asking what street this is so she can call the cops to come and get you. f. you're mum with your pills. And... the catch-22 is... there are no sane results! Horrar!

 Heeeey. Ahh happieeer! YEeeay! Even though I have frozzie fingers, that'as why my typings a bit bizarre today. (No, I said the tyoping, not thaee words!) Well, mauybe bth. Woohoo, I'm carting my fair trade ass to a Body Shop party thing! *yeah, an excuse to buy all the lush stuff!* *i mean literraly, carting it!

 scythe is a Jelly-Eating Vampire Monkey with a Battle Rating of 4.5. Unleash your own Food-Eating Battle Monkey . Geez! I can't believe my monkeys a vegeterian! BLOOD GORE!!! He might... even... be a vegan... *damn you! (to my ultra vegan friend)*

 bloddy hell! i hvn't been on here 4 ages. well, i'm bck. and i come bearing news. those of u insignificant people that don't no, i got a letter, a very important letter, a very important letter from the eye hospital, a very important letter from the eye hospital saying i have to go for an anaesthetics assessment on the 18th Nov. YAY! and then my op will b soon after. It doesn't feel like a friday nite, i'm not sure y it doesn't feel like a friday nite, it just doesn't! had an email from Tim, but he was supposedly too busy to actually say something half way worth reading. *all he sed was half a reply to what i told him which was that i mite b able to go to x-country* DAMN THE MEN OF THIS WORLD. *Actually don't damn all of them, just damn the ones that purposely wind me up (Ian, Tim, Liam.....)* KATIE!!! U forgot to mention what i wasn't allowed to talk about. How could u? SOB! SOB! LYNNE! I am not a little lump of chocolate thats melting! hee hee blah blah blah, dunno what else to talk about, but tell me some other people to damn and i will see if i approve. xoxox = )

 Gyaaah! Plastic wallets! Someone should make a robot that can open them and shove bits of paper in them! Cause I can't!!! (Ahh, the weather got boring so I'm talking about plastic wallets!) Uhuh. Don't worry, people are walking around my house with colourful umbrellas in their hair. Wooohooo! (Is it really cannabis at Lebanese restaurants) Hmm... (?)

 Noooo we were sooo not drunk! It's was 7! That's too early! Anyway, we just went a itzy bit hyper at the firework display... (I tried to get everyone to go 'eee' instead of 'ahhh' but it didn't work!) Counting the wrong number for the countdown worked though! (And I get away with it, if anyone turns around I can just stare at a kid near me!) MUHAHHAAA! So this is why people like being adults huh? (I'm not that ignorant!) Ahehehee... ok. Ahh tomorrow I made a pact to ...er ... what was it? Not talk about my cats and spinsterhood ;P and Izzy has to not talk about Pete (her bfg) and Emma has to not talk about her hair! So we're all gonna end up talking about the weather! Woohoo!

 Hummmm kes, Jenny and I are adiment (oooo big word) that you were drunk last nite!! We never went into the rugby club cos Anna wasn't feeling to good so we laid on the pavement insted!! Ummm lalala.... the gang show on friday night was good, when we were waiting to be picked up there were scary people. Ahhhhhhhh xx

 Heeheeee I'm sooo happy! Erm... ahh I watched Field of Dreams yesterday, and I was in a 'sucker for soppy movies' mood, so now I'm all mushed up. (Someone should really check my English skills) And I do look like a marshmellow in my white jumper! Not that that's got anything to do with it... Err, yup, I'm weird when I'm happy! (Happy all the time makes weird people!) Especially if you laugh a lot, apparantly that's the secret to old age, so I'm goona be immortal muhahahaaa! Makes kind of a nice change from 'screw the world' mood aye? Woohoo!!!

 Hello my little lumps of chocolate thats melting!! I have nothing to report apart from= Circumfrence= pie x diameter that's all folks! xx

 Yeay New Year! Woohoo! Er... new years resolutions: same as last year. I'm gonna keep them some year! Mostly: get fit, but I guess I'll actually stick to that one when I get nearer to going to Kygrystan! *i think that's how it's spelt...* I didn't tell you I was going? Well it's in 2005, but it costs 3000! Eek! That's a lot of money! So I've been bag packing like crazy!!! Ahhh! Haa it's going to be soooo fun though! Who cares if we don't wash for a month! We'll all stink so nobody's gonna notice! Well actually... I think the people on the plane back might notice! Oh well, their loss. Oh I'm having people staying over the night New Years Eve... err sorry peeps but I invited so many people that I don't know if there's gonna be room for everyone! I guess I'll just sleep in the rabbit run, Lynne can have the rabbit hutch and Laura can go in the garage.

 Uhh yeah... sorry about the last post. Watching Laputa and trying to clear out my room really phased me. Yup, it's time for the Christmas clear out! I spend most of it adding stuff to my cupboard... I decorate the front with loads of crap! Yeay! Agh but it's so hard trying to find places for presents to go. And... I'm talking crap again! Come back brain, return to me! I watched the Return of The King yesterday! I can't believe they cut out Sauroman.. or whoever the bad guy dressed in white was. I want to watch the extended one, even if it's five hours it will still be amazing!

 Ahh finally... slightly real post. I feel like a yeti! Wearing my poncho... who knows what kind of guns I could be wearing... muhahahaaa. Not enough time. :P

 meesa exicted, meesa very excited, which if u have read my previous blog, u will undastand, also if u r lynne who i hv jst spoken to u will undastand!!! hee hee! hv jst been given a bottle of reef to drink, very randomly. none of us are really very well at the mo so my parents can't give a crap about what we do!! FREEDOM!! FREEDOM!! hee hee hee hee hee!!! i am getting a pair of boots to go with my short skirts, they are 19, and soooo cool, well, i'm not entirely certain i'm getting them bu close enough to certain!! i can see i am gonna go on a blabber again so if ur bored already save the rest for another day!!! my sis is getting boots aswell. but she wants ones like samanthas slouch boots. shocking news: MY BROTHER IS THE SAME HEIGHT AS ME! AAAAGGGGHHHH! for the first time in my life i feel short! was reminded this christams of all the people from chessington and all the m8's i left behind. (Ben, Katharine, Sarah, Vivki, Katie, Adam, etc,etc). good piece of advice; never agree to move house, unless u are staying in the same town! what brought all this on was the crimbo letter we got from denise (bens mum), we always get one cos me and ben and liam were quite close (cos ben was 10 days older than me), we always shared parties etc and my mum and his mum were good friends so every year we get a Scorer update letter ! it seems strange to be part of someones life when you live soo very far away! we haven't been on the relative trail yet but when we do go there are gifts waiting for us! YAY! i really wanna get more pressies and more money and more more more!!! *mmm....slight power mad moment there!* right must shut up, i always end up writing tonnes, i could sit here and type for hours, of course i wud probably repeat myself a couple of times!! and for those of u who r dumb enuf to have not worked out y i am excited, its becos i get to c tim sometime in the near future!! YAY! bye xoxoxox

 Yeeeay it was Christmas! (Er... little bit late!) Ahh, I'm finally home after going on the relative trail. It was really fun though, and we managed to spread opening our presents over three days! I just opened my last one which was some cool lights for my room. *which is the first and only temple dedicated to me* ... Ahh! I have to go work out my feng shui garden and watch Galaxy Quest! (Actual blog when brain meets body) *sometime tomorrow* Pika Shuichi!

 Sooooooo my christmas was alright, i really want to go out on new years eve so hinty hinty peoples!!! I'm up for most things within reason!!!! Christmas presents are good, I now have the darkness album, my uncle gave it to me and then before I had even listened 2 it he took it back, copied it for himself and then gave it back to me, mean or what??? I dont think the rest of the family like it too much though!!! My Grandma and Grandad gave me and my sister trinket boxes, that r not too nice!!! Grandma phoned up and sed that i could put it on my dressing table, two difficulties with that 1) what is a dressing table and 2) I dont own one!!!! So I'm taking it to a charity shop at the first chance I have, unless any body wants it????!!!! I also got sum make up, money to put on my phone, o and an alarm clock radio!! I got two other cds, my skiing holiday and lots and lots of sweets!!!!!! Yummy!! Laaaallllllllaaaaaaaaaa, think I might go shopping tomorrow, buy some things curtisy of my dad, i got so9me skiing stuff today, gloves, socks etc, but still have no goggles. so if you know anyone with skiing goggles, put me in a good word, but only if the person is vagually human!! Had better go am luking for stuff to buy!! xx

(shared wiv my sis), 6 videos, a dragon neckalce, a book that is a story based on myths, a cool scarf and fluorescent pink gloves, two pairs of stripy tights (one pair are black and white, the other are pink and black),my two linkin park cd's which are soooo cool.and thats about it i think. oooo and i got money from my paper round. i didn't drink as much this year i dont think. i only had 3 vermouths with lemonade (which were 3/4 vermouth 1/4 lemonade), and 2 or 3 reefs, and i was totally unaffected, i didn't have a hangover today at all. my body has a high resistance to alcohol, which is good cos i love reef, despite the fact that the alcohol makes my skin yucky!!! i am puttin an end to the orlando bloom/johnny depp arguement once and for all...... THEY ARE BOTH GORGEOUS NOW LEAVE IT AT THAT!!!!!! good news. i am meeting up with tim at some stage, whenever we can both get to the mall, cos we worked out on christmas eve (despite the fact that he'd had about 10 cans and had been playing drinking games, and i had had a couple of drinks) that the mall is the mid point more-or-less between us. YAY! i got chased by the ducks at backwell lake on christmas day. i had bread and of course no one had been there so none of them had been fed, so the chased me (or followed, either way) 1/2 way round the lake, and it was geese and swans aswell which i am totally scared of cos they try to eat me! wot else has happened, my eye is alot better. my auntie got engaged christmas day, i am very happy for no apparant reason, and i have lots of money that i can spend or save and gain interest on! okay i think that is it so i will stop blabbering on and on and on.......................... bye xoxoxoxoxox

 Helooooooooo!! I'm back now so you betta stop chucking insults at me!!! Everybody loves fit men, katie I have heard about you and your small Jonny Depp infatuation. i did watch pirates of the carabian yesterday it was very very very good, was loving orlando Bloom and jonny depp. i would however like to make the point that orlando bloom has thus far only been fit in that film. Also everybody loves the YMCA so dont insult it, i requested it on saturday nite and it got played for me again!!! I rule!! Hummmm had better go and have some tea in a minute, went out for the traditional xmas eve trip 2 pizza hut 4 lunch and ate toooooo much, i had an all you can eat and then an ice cream factory!!! Yummmy, and not to greedy!!!! I cant wait for Sanrta to come, oooo christmas is nearly here, hide all the drink from weird twice removed uncles that suddenly appear at your door, other wise there could be trouble!!!! Glad that you all had fun at izzy's party i was asleep by about 10, so it was a gd idea that i wasnt there, and any way Anna filled me in on everything that happened!!!

What other news do I have for you all, hope u all liked your pressies i realy liked them and wanted to keep them all, which I know would have been greedy but hey!!! Kes; last nite your carol singing was fab!!!! My mum really like it and wouldnt shut up, she says are you going to do it next year??? Also about 10 minutes after you left a load of year 8 girls, dolled up to the 9's called and started singing, they were shockingly awful and had the door closed on them!!!

Tim actually replied to my txt mesage (yes i actually hv credit on my fne for a change!!!miracle i no!) he is okay, got the same stinking cold that i have, and as per normal, he hasn't trained for the regional xc. so i txt him saying it was typical him and blah blah blah, i'm sure u dont really want to hear. any way MERRY CRIMBO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! hee hee!hope u get what u want and according to GWR Santa will be in Bristol at 1am so he shud be here soon after!!! : ) : )xoxoxox

 urlLink http://uk.news.yahoo.com/031222/80/ehobi.html - 'Loose screw halts nuclear power station' I would hate to be living in Spain right now! *hell, actually i wouldn't care if there was a nuclear melt down if i was living in spain!' Mmm... might make the pina colada taste funny though. Anyway... oh wait, I still don't have a point. Paragraph spree! I slept for five hours so I'm less sleep deprived *or derived?* but still totally crazy! Heeey I was wondering *uhoh* when people are the opposite of you does that mean that you shouldn't get along? (in english-more likely to not get along) *spell check on opposite... bing correct* I used to think that everyone could be friends with everyone else, but it's truer if you say everyone can tolerate everyone else, but then that's not always true! Ahh, but you might as well try. Anyway, I should probably stop pretending that I know something... and that my brain's not just a pile of grey goo. *hey, mine's probably grey goo with pink strips!* Mmm brains...

 Wahay, got about three hours of sleep last night. *izzy's sleepover party* It got quite dangerous; at 4 in the morning we were trying to play clever word rule games *very very dangerous* but everyone kept forgetting what they were supposed to be doing! Sadly the stripper failed to turn up for izzy's party, but we've got johnny depp booked for next year and hopefully he should actually turn up! Yup, that's sleep deprevation kicking in! It was fun though! I had a sudden impulsive urge to watch Muppet Treasure Island but izzy didn't have it so we watched the Christmas one. Then we all had a foot war *so fun!* you have to err... whack the person with your foot... to win. Yup, absolute crap. Well, seeing as this room is getting dark, I'll go and lie down in a different one.

 Lynne's dangeroua though! Definatly don't go to a barn dance with her! She goes hyper and starts shouting strange requests at the DJ. (No one wants to do the YMCA dance!!!) Anyway... HAPPY BIRTHDAY IZZY and to everyone else in the world who's having a birthday! *don't you think that there should be a birthday channel on tv?* (Nope...)

 YAY! went to get izzy's pressie today, got her...............not gonna tell! gr8 bit of advice: NEVER GO TO THE CINEMA WITH LYNNE (especially if the film stars colin farell). she is hell, aren't u babes?! lynne sat there and went...erm...'celebrated' everytime he came on the screen. and me and matt had to put up with it as we were sat either side of her. gotta go xoxox

 Aww poor laurie! Get well soon! Sorry, I've been doing revising for two speaking tests, went to a gig one night and did bag packing this evening so I haven't had a spare moment to think. *can someone lend me some please? i'm desperate!* Err... yeah... anyway, unless I'm too busy to come on MEWWY CWIMBO everyone! I expect you to be at least 2 stones bigger and unable to do a 10m sprint in two weeks! Luv Kes and -^*.*^- (ahh call pest control!) For the weird letter thing, not me! *even though the weird letter thing was my name!* ...

 yeah, kinda was in a bit of a hurry earlier. my eye is sore, red and swollen, and sore, and red, and swollen!! hv had a fone call from lynne and samantha which was nice, and crimbo cards from jess and claire, claires had a special message in it!!! : ) am going out with cdts tomorrow nite, not sure that i will b able to watch the whole film. good luck in language orals if u havent already had them. 'see' ya soon!!!xoxoxox

 katie, if u come online thisevening, sally came round earlier and sed that izzy is a bit upset that no body has called her as she is off ill and sumthing bout a meeting from monday. cud u pls call izzy but not let on that sally told me to tell u to call her if that makes any sense to anyone. and b4 u ask, i'm fine, and u can call me aswell if u want but u mite get my deranged brother or wacko sis answering it. : ) : ) xoxox

 Let me set the scene... this is after one of the FBI guys got up, and figured that he was sitting on the hole where Saddam was... FBI1 : Go on, Mr Hussein, Sir. Tell us where you put the weapons. Saddam : I have no weapons, you Western Infidel. FBI1 : Yes you do. We sold them to you in the 1980's. Look, here's the receipt. Kurdish Gas, Botulism spray, Meaballs in gravy. It's all here. Saddam : I take them back to Argos and get refund. 14 day return policy. Not suitable for purpose. Bracket missing from self-assembly ICBM missile. Meatballs particularly unpleasant. I get vouchers and buy DVD player and free Bruce Willis box set. Top Banana! *aahhh, so much better than my one!* Hey, I've been having a stressful time from the tests, and now I'm freeeee! *wahoo!* Anyway, this was done by Vegan Shoe a.k.a. Dado Rail a.k.a. Ian. Personally I think he should have mentioned peas at least once *mine was better!* (was not, fool!) :P Anyway, let's all be thankful that they shoved Bush down the hole after they got Saddam out. :D

 urlLink Gwyneth: My Pet Hates About UK Any normal person could tell you these things! Why is it that the stars comment on these useless things?! *i'm an acception, i'm not famous yet* :P

 About the whole Saddam Hussein thing. They're illegally going to try him, not in a court of world affairs, but with a bias court set up by the Americans. I hate this only because it enabilises the pro-Saddam supporters to condemn the Americans for not giving him a fair trial. It gives them something to fight for, and to become martyrs for. Did all these people come from Harvard who arranged this? Pumped full of American goo? About the whole WMD thing. Can't you imagine the Simpsons doing a take off of them questioning him. Scary Guy FBI Agent Number 1: Okay Saddam, tell us where the WMD's are Saddam: No. SCFAN1: We know you've got them somewhere! Saddam: You can't prove that! SCFAN1: Err... go on... Wait a sec they're behind you! Saddam: ... SCFAn1: Pretty please? Saddam: Hey, I hid all the money so that I could get a good lawyer, go away! ...

 Heeey Santa's Little Helper TM here! *i did bag packing so i'm official* (eh?) I also went to my brother's 18th birthday party. Scary! I only 'knew' a few people, but I 'knew by sight' everyone else. Me and Izzy ended up with a bottle of red wine between us, and someone thought I was 19! *muhahahaaa evil plans forming* It's very dangerous to tell a fifteen year old kid that you think they look eighteen! *dam, must be my new hair style! aaargh everyone thinks it's permed!* Whenever I get my hair cut I always look older! *so if i get it shaved, i'll look 50 and get away with absolutly anything* Yeay! Fun!

 "Ladies and gentlemen, we got him." Not some cleverly thought out historical speech but something that seems like it should have come from a soap opera or a games show. Months of searching in an illegal war that has killed more during the illegal occupation than the hostile invasion did. Not that I'm saying it was wrong.

 Hmm, anyone else noticed the mass murdering of the junk mailers? I haven't got any in a few days, and hotmail's filter isn't that good! Maybe they've realised that I'm not a man that needs to take viagra! *for gods sake, don't go on this if you search for viagra!* Anyway... onto things that won't get me tagged by the CIA search engine... Crap, probably already am for including CIA in this. Good luck with your operation! Hopefully the surgeons won't have hang overs! *eh?* Naaah, I'm sure it'll go fine! Well, I hope it will! I've gotta go revise for my spanish speaking test tomorrow! *don't worry laura, we'll both be suffering*

 heeeeeellllllooooooo! hv my op on monday so may be on here tomoroow in a vain effort to calm myself down. but seriously, i am not that nervous bout it, as i explained to lynne the other nite, i did all my freaking out last weekend! slept over at samanthas last nite, that was fun. we got to sleep at 4 and had to be awake again at 8:30 cos claire had to go to gym o well, in a can't be bothered mood, which means i cna't be bothered to rite reems and reems of useless random junk that noone will read anyway cos i rote it. xoxoxox

 Rite katie what you need to do is get some mud and a bucket!! Then you put the two together and wahay you have a mud pie just like you used to make when you were little!! Am talking to my mate and I have just seen a picture of her boyf, hes gorgey!! xx

 Has someone got some inspiration for me? My mum's making a looooad of cool stuff for Christmas *yes, cooler than my ultra cool big jumper* and no one's making her stuff! I need some thing that doesn't involve a lot of skill... I could write a poem! Yup, with my talentless skills I'm sure I can make mum and something rhyme... uhh bum? ...crumb? Jeez it's tough!

 Blogger gave up on me! So I can't see it, but I can type it *it's better than writing on walls!* (insider joke. i don't get it either) Anyway, did someone say something about a vegan society? My friend seems to be attached to all things vegan. Oh my GOD! A vegan pig! Here piggy piggy! Eww, I bet it's full of cabbages! Can someone... write it on the wall for me please...

 You know you're in trouble when... you sing along to Goo Goo Dolls - Iris with your eyes closed. Not as random as you think! We were in a science test and this girl was singing Killing Me Softly sooo badly! So if I fail science I'm blaming her. *or maybe i should blame my cat for distracting me all the time by sitting on my revision books* Mmm... random cheesy 80s love songs are getting onto my pc. *aaah!* Aww, but weren't Wet Wet Wet cool? *...* I wonder what they're all doing? Living off their one hit wonders? I would be! Probably ended up playing in bingo halls for 80 year old ladies who are deaf anyway. Nice.

 Katie, Katie, Katie, I can only think of one thing actually worth saying........SHUT UP UR BLABBERING AGAIN! if my concious mind and subconcious mind mixed who no's wot sort of mess we'd all b in!!! hv 2 do my papers soon but i really don't wanna go back out into the cold. hopefully i will have some tips today, my bro has got a box of chocolates for the both of us to share. but thats it. i wud give out my crimbo cards to them but i have been told to leave it until at least monday. o well life sucks and there is nothing i can do about it! xoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxoxox

 Do you ever get those 'aaahhh now i get it' moments? I seem to be having a lot of those recently. Only one problem. It's my subconscious figuring it out, so all of a sudden I'm wondering what it is I've figured out. It takes a few days to reach my conscious mind. More like a week. Which isn't good when you're in a test. I think my subconsious mind and conscious mind need to mix more! Hmm... wonder when someone figured that you had a subconsious mind and a conscious mind? *see! it takes a paragraph of dribble to get clever intelligence!*

 *has a sudden desire to be a boobah*

 Never ending exams. And they're all higher tier! Gyaaaahhh! *played too much FF10* The English today was slightly bearable *you wouldn't guess it from reading my spelling though* It's one of those subjects that I'm apparantly good at... actually, more like everyone else is really really crap at it so I look good. *sorry, but it feels more like that!* I think they should supply us with batons made of foam so that we can hit the desk/supervising person when we get stressed in the exams. Or at least supply us with mittens or something! I think my hands might drop off in a test someday now. *fun!* Free my pretties! FREEE!

 Stillll revising. Never ending puddle of exams! Aaarrgghhh! This is doing my head in! And half on them are impossible anyway (ie. FRENCH!) How are you supposed to do a french exam without a dictionary? It's as close to impossible you can get without us not having to do it. (Exams really affect my communication) Talking to a revision book all day gets to you I guess. At least we've only got English tomorrow! Ahh, nah, I'm not actually that worried. (I think) Some how I'll fluke my way through it! Yeay!

 urlLink http://www.b3ta.co.uk/ Verrrry strange website! But it's got Name That Beard and the wierd Kill Your Parents... freaky. Oh yeah, the coursework... Err I better actually do it!

 urlLink www.howies.co.uk For the believers of fair trade, organic and pro-environment is... HOWIES! Okay, so maybe I've been talking to somebody who gets sponsered to ride by them for too long but never mind! (I'm gonna get a catalogue!) Seriously sounds like a good company though! (Go check it out to see how good...) Hehe.

 Yay!!! Im listening to Snow Patrol, they are toooooooo good!! really have to get their album. I had a great time with my Dad last night, we couldnt stop laffing adn got told off by my mum who's ill!!! OOpppsss!!! hope you all ahd fun, Im currently messing up my graphics coursework, like the majority of people really!! xx

 Stupid post disappeared! DAMN IT! I wrote some really good rambling stuff as well! Ahh well, start again. Lynne, Laura, peace, love, empathy! *but worded better and actually sounding like it means something* Ahh, I don't have the time! But I still care, really! Anyway, erm something like 'if you don't make up we're gonna shove both of you into a room continually listening to the Barney theme tune' but the same as above. (worded better) Yup, definatly a C in english! Don't take your anger out on each other, go kill some monkeys: urlLink http://www.mohsye.com/nu5va/diving.html?namn=290

 Update! Sorry, I've just been really busy this week so I haven't blogged that much! (update?) Sorry, I've been on scanlation sites too much *i live for that word* Mmm... stop saying sorry! No really, I've been out most nights or doing something... aaarghhh let Saturday come! I need a rest! Tomorrow I'm going to Samantha's party! Yeay! Gaaah! Save me from the 'you have to go to bed now' monster! AHHH! It turned into the 'I mean NOW!' monster. All states of my mind have not in any way been induced by harmful substances. Apart from maybe the tv...

 wahey! i am doing biology, geography, psychology and design tech at A level! Woopee! That was some funny chemistry we had today. Izzy was still singing on the way home. we're all crazy together! did u actually do any work? i got a surprising amount done considering i was the only one who understood it and you lot wouldnt leave me alone! Samanthas bday tomoz. and mine in two weeks. its gonna b soo cool. am going to get my pressies tomorrow! still havent decided my fancy dress. anna is coming as sandy from grease, emma is coming as barbie, emily as tinkerbell, samantha as britney spears and they are the only ones who know so far...one of the guys said something about they wish they could come but i cant remember who. i mite just invite them and not tell my mum. g2g xxxxx

 Someone do me a favour and hack this site: urlLink http://www.georgewbush.com/ And don't forget to tell the CIA to tag a 15 year old kid.

 Heeeey I dragged myself out of bed again to post. (Yup, I'm a 500 pound hairy gorilla!) Well... you never know! How far are you supposed to trust people on the net without being gullible? (or gullable I guess) Ahh I'm not really a 500 pound gorilla! I'm a 30 stone teapot! Hmm not many job opertunities open to me then I guess. We got all out GCSE predicted you're gonna get this grade or your conscience will kill you grades back and I did ok! Yeaaay! Only two grades to up and then I'm gonna be an aaa student! Woohoo! Mind you a baaa student would be quite cool. (Probably end up being a baaab) Then onto AS and A2 levels! (Gyaahhh!) I did some Japenese drumming today! Cool man! It was soooo much fun but I forgot the name of the cool group who are performing in England and are 'world class'. We also did some gamelan, which is also loads of fun! Ahh but I wanted to play the gong! The Japanese drummer guy came in and started hitting the gongs (shows what he loves!) Gamelan: urlLink http://www.joglosemar.co.id/gamelan.html I was playing a saron! I love all these other culture things, I wish I could join a group or something... Japenese Drumming: urlLink http://www.kuenstleragentur-karinkaiser.de/tte_tai.htm Yes, the links really do have to be that obvious. I'm one of those people who spends about five minutes on a splash page trying to get in!

 yes lynne i did wanna go to sleep, b cos i havent slept properly for the last 4 days. have decided i am getting jewellery and ornaments for my bday and then once i have finished on the net i am going to start thinking about what colour each person is going to be and i am gonna start drafting invitations. Lynne robyn has just signed in and she thinks dominic monaghan is fit aswell, so there (in case u hadn't guessed ihave him as my foto!) did some more media but got pissed off with the computer (which is why i cant undastand y i am on it now) and decided not to do anymore. anyway cant be bothered to rite anymore, despite the fact that i can think of tonnes to say. will just have to spend tomorrow at skool yabbering on! xoxoxox

 Eugggh heavy headd! I'm at home cause I felt ill so I didn't go in. :( It feels like the gravity on my heads quadrupled! So being the good student like I am, I've spent the whole day drooling as I watched Gravitation, and then downloaded some of it for good measure. *ahh it's like she's talking code!* Hehe Shuichui's sooo manic! Waaahaaa Pika Kumagarooo! I love people who are free to be manic! It's too boring keeping it inside yourself, that's why when some one tells you to get up and dance, you don't just dance, you sing too.

 Im sure that we will find your new blog thingy katie, we always do! missed you walking to school thismorning, i found myself talking to the trees!!! Am in media at the moment, and am really quite bored, had better go and do some work in a minuter, otherwise I could be in for a ticking off from CJ!!! Laura and Samantha are busy working, at least i think they are, Laura is currently having an argument with her mouse, it keeps on sticking to the table!!! Tis very funny, think I might give her a book to lean on, hang on...she diddnt want it!!! She thinks she wants to go to sleep. Ummmm lardy da!! xx

 Geez I haven't posted since Wednesday! *teehee wed-nes-day!* Err yeah... I've just got a new blog... don't look at me like that! I'm not abandoning this one. And I'm not gonna tell you where it is :P Ahh freedom for thought! Well yeah... what's changed since Wed? Oooh, I went to a yoga class! *this last time i chose to do exercise was when i did ballet in year 5* Hehe... so as you can guess I was the one at the back of the glass who cheered when the lady said 'don't do this if you feel that you can't'. Yes, once again Britain's youth is up shown by the older generation who were happily snapping their back in two. *don't worry, Laura came with me and she was the one doing the back bending* Also, our friend Dave fractured his skull! :( He was playing football and somehow ran into a wall! He was unconscious for ages. :( I hope he gets better! Ahh it's not as crazy and random without him! I wanna hug from Davvveeee!

 Technohead - I want to be a hippy How come no one ever told me about this totally freak song! Ahh sooo coool! I now have a new thing to sing to freak people out! MUHAHAAA! Don't worry, I'll never forget about Rage of the Winter! Or Smashing Blue! *yup, i circulate around freak songs* I swear you could almost see me in the Donnie Darko sound track! Ahh I've been looking at AS/A2 level courses... I said that I couldn't do some and my mum hit me with her ball of wool! It really hurt! Apparantly I'm not allowed to say stuff like that again! *aww, what a loving mum* But she didn't have to hit me so hard!

 Hummmmmmm.........Jenny and I were talking about the ghost busters music yesterday. I came up with the fantastic suggestion of watching the Ghostbusters Video that Katie has and listening to the music repetativly, untill u can copy it. That way all u have to pay is Katie for all the food you eat, and Katie's parents have to pay the electric bill. Sorted!!! I've been having a fun day, went down the cdt sqd this afternoon and did some demolishing, and moving and binning. I did media this morning, and have been talking to Ian on the phone, what a fun day. OOOOOOOOO I dislike this haily weather, it hurts your head!!! xx

 Geez, I'm actually using hair products. :( After all these years of screaming if I walked into the hair spray section... *sigh* But it's just mousse! *nope, can't spell* and hair serum! *Now it sounds like I put an animal and human sweat on my hair* Well I don't know! *crazy day* But that's so that I don't have to brush it or bother with it *muhahahaaa* So actually I'm bothering so that I don't have to bother! On to things that are slightly more interesting *this is our first meeting, I don't want to go too far* Does anyone know where you can buy the Ghost Busters sheet music from? Ahh ebay search! *random music plays in the backround as you edge towards the exit* I'm just bored. There's only so much enjoyment you can get out of singing along with Roy Orbison. WOWWWW! You can BUY the GHOSTBUSTERS PROTON PACKS!!! My god, I've been living in the dark for so long! *needs to get the courage to use mIRC or find a dark chat room*

 urlLink Webmonkey: The Web Developer's Resource Finally found Webmonkey! I've been searching for the bloody website for ages and ages! :) Ahh now I can mess up the wonderful layout... how fun. I just have to put a link to it here incase I forget it again *noooo!* But hopefully I should remember it! The colour codes page is just too helpful! Yeay! *so simple minded* Yup, aren't elastic bands cool? On a random note somewhere on my desk: I have a pirate bandana! Woohooo!

 Hello.......... I have my dress!!!! YAYAYAYAYAY!!! Its purple and nice and purple.... ummmmmm sorry got lost in it there then. But I musnt forget its a dress, ughhhh, I dont do dresses. I really wish that people would not buy me smarties, one pack is fine but 4, im talking tubes here, is a bit excessive. Hummm........ jess jenny Anna and I put all the fotos for the year buk that we had onto a cd today, great fun!!! Then we had a little disco in Jess' room, twas fun!! Ummm i had another message but have forgotten it.... nope I haven't actually. katie i would not add more hours onto the Bill, because I no longer watch it. I don't know what I would do, actually yes i do I would save up all the time and stick it onto the weekend, so that i diddnt have to go to school for longer. Or I would give myself more time asleep because I'm nearly always tired!!! xx

 Katie as per usual ur wittering on! think about something actualloy worth thinking about for a change! gotta go busy looking for a holiday for me samantha claire and emily. xoxox

 Ahhh! Life's just too confusing! How are you supposed to fit all the things that you want to do into one day? I recon a day should be at least 5 hours longer! *ahh more time asleep :)* Actually... probably more time drinking! *i mean non-alcoholic* I just like drinking more than eating... yup totally bizarre. Apart from tea's, what satisfaction can you get from drinking tea? Well I guess that's a really dumb idea... geez instead of using it to cure a disease or save a life I would be drinking cranberry juice *sigh* Actually... Lynne would probably add an extra hours onto the Bill and Laura would probably have five hours for break time! So I guess it's not that weird. *phew, got out of that one* Anyway I gotta go shopping in Bristol! Bibi.

 it isn't rite to have it on a sunday. and its not just pete and izzy, its samantha and dan aswell, and hopefully by that time anna and bertie will have got themselves sorted. i dont think i am gonna do anything. bye xoxox

 Ahh Laura, have your party whenever, but have one! I want an excuse to go crazy and hyper!!! Have it on valentines day, but late in the evening or something... anyway it's only Izzy and Pete and they probably won't come if it's around valentines, cause they'll be too starry eyed and confused! *shivver* It looks better with two v's!

 If it's not right to have a party on a sunday why did i Have my 14th birthday party on a sunday, the same with Emily's 14th and 15th?? xx

 nah! i can't have a party on a sunday. its not rite to have a party on a sunday! i dunno boo hoo! xoxoxox

 Bonjour!!! Laura why dont you have your birthday party on Sunday the 15th of Feb. That way the loved up couples can be loved up and go to your party, I can't but, hey I might be with some fit guys!!! Letty and I learnt a new word last, night, its rather rude but very funny, and I cant even remember how its spellt, but no doubt it will come up in a media studies lesson. My mother and Father are out for lunch at some of our neighbours houses with the rest of the neighbours, which means I could either stay at home and be a little bored and look after my sister or I could go and die of bordem, I went for the first option. Glad you had fun yesterday Laura, i am ill and am not venturing out of the house to much. I agree with you Kes about the whole New years resolution spice grils thing, at least I do up until the next time we all get together and party a bit to hard, or not as the case may be. xx

 aaaaaaaah i saw katie and izzy in bristol!!!! aaaaaaahhh!!!! But we had a good time, me anna, and tim. we did some shopping, and i bought the evanescence album, and then we did more shopping and then we had lunch, bought some sweets and went to the cinema and saw the new Peter Pan film *which isn't actually half as crap as it looks!* then we did more shopping and then we came home *sob* we had a good time tho. rite, i need ur help............wot shall i do for my birthday and when? cos i can't do it the saturday after my bday bcos those who r delightfully attatched (izzy, samantha.....) will want to be with their other halves that day bcos it is valentines day, sop that day is out of the question. and i can't have it the weekend b4 bcos then u'll have samanthas party one week and mine the next and i'll end up getting really crappy pressies cos none of u will have any money. So, i'm a bit bugared. I'm actually starting to think that maybe i shud just forget about my bday this year. *tho i dont think thats quite as easy as it sounds*. rite im blabbering again so im gonna shut up *again*. bye bye, c ya nice and early in skool tomorrow! xoxoxox

 Ahh I'm here... I'm here! I've just been out shopping for ball dress stuff *bluergh* I'm wearing my skirt that I wore as a bridesmaid to my cousins wedding *tried compacting that sentence, didn't work*, a cover thingy *?* that I got for christmas and a 10 top! Woohooo! The most expensive thing about the ensemble is the bag! Izzy also got a really nice dress! Yup, we danced to Spice Girls and sang along. Let's make that one of our New Year Resolutions to never do it again!

 Cough, rolling thing across screen.......................is anybody out there....................more rolling things across screen!! xx

 hee hee me again, have u had a Lynne overload yet?? xx

 Sorry i would have run off again but OMG!!!! News just of IMDB.com Johnny Depp is going to be in Pirates of the Caribean 2 in 2005 playing Jack Sparrow again, and and, this is my favourite thing hes going to be in Charlie and the Chocolate factory, again in 2005 playing non other than Willy Wonker!!!! YAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAY!!!! Sorry thought you might like to know that. 2005 is the year for Johnny Depp fans!! xx

 Wow, brad pitt is sooooo gorgey!!! Was reading about him in the paper, why do some men have to me absolutly drop dead gorgeous and then others, mainly all the ones we happen to know are ugly as wotsits!!!! Ummmmmmmmmm...... U really should ban me from talking about men again, it should shut me up for a while. I really like pink Jelly Babies, in small amounts they are really very nice. Sorry I am sat here with a bag of jelly babies and there is only one left, a black one, which I strongly dislike!! Poor old Jess, she is ill with a cold like the rest of the nation. OOOO it snowed over night, yes the snow was slightly pathetic, but it still snowed!!!! Yay the first snow of winter, wasn't that a name of some really bad film?? Lalala i'm rediculously mad. I really hate shopping for dresses. Im sure you have all seen what women want, well when I go shopping with my dad its like shopping with mel Gibsons character, he wants you to have a dress that makes you look like a nun!!! Or an old lady. I really don't ware dresses. Have you seen me in a dress in the last 5 years? NO!!!! Ahhhhhhhhh I hate them they are soooo ugggghhhhhhh. Right rant over, o I hate shoes with heels to, I really cant walk in them, they make me fall over to much. Ummmmmmm I really need chocolate and Coldplay, ooooo coldplay. Did you have a nice time with Tim laura, I was going to text you during today but I keep on forgetting and I expect your coming home now or something. O well. I'm all alone, dad and nicole are with the caravan cleaning it and Mum is at nans, at least I think she is. When I go sking my loverly family are all going to London, and France I think without me. But muuuhahahahahah *evil laugh* they wont be able to get a family ticket for anything, because they are all based on two adults and two children, I know these things, don't ask me why. Hummmmmmm had better go and do something constructive, but then again what is constructive, this could be said to be constructive as I am entertaining millions *cough*!!! That is a very interesting thought!! xx

 heloo!!! What did u all get up to then after I left on thursday morning??? i think we were all a little bit laaaaed!!! At least i was, i fell over in the kitchen and the hall when i got in, very funny and very noicey, adn anna izzy and i tried that thing where you put your finger on your nose to see if you are drunk as a skunk and we all failed miserably!!!! Hummm i'm not to sure about sleeping in the rabbit hutch, as much as i love your rabbit Katie, I really dont think me and her would fit in it!!! Sorry about waking you all up, Jenny should really learn to keep her phone turned off!! I think she is a bit annoyed with me becasue she wont return any of my texts!!! I made three new year resolutions originally, but then forgot one so I know have two; 1) to do well in my gcse's and 2) to get a guy and keep hold of him, cos you neva no when u mite need 1!!!! laura are you looking forward to seeing Tim, you will have to fill me in on all the goss!!! Humm had better go jess stocks email is working again so have to email her, all before eastenders starts. xx P.S Jonny Depp rules!! P.P.S did we really dance to the spice girls or did that just happen in my head!?!?

 Aww poor little Mango hurt his paw, so now it's bleeding. :( Don't worry, I've hugged him for hours and he's kind of gone into a state of constant purring. Mmm... but school's on Monday! Ahhhh! It's too hard to get your brain back into work mode after it's gone all soggy from Xmas tv. *repeats rot your brain* I actually uhh better do that whole load of homework now, anyway I'm being selfish staying up here. Have a nice 2004.

 Yes... it's finally happened... I'M BLOODY DEAF IN BOTH EARS! Actually... the one that I was originally deaf in is now... not so deaf, but the other one's completely gone! Ahhhh why do I not get any spam about clearing wax or something useful like that? *and totally gross* Gyaaahhh but how will I compose!!! *does a sakano-san style tornado and hits the wall* Ahh, all better. Umm... don't ask I drank last night and I haven't had much sleep! Then I woke up deaf and croaky... and not with 1m at the foot of my bed! *dam wishes don't work!* (...going byeeee...)

 i didn't go in the garage tho did i?! and we all fitted into the front room (altho ur dad did have to try and navigate his way thru in the morning!)that was sooo much fun last nite. my mum and dad didn't care about the amount of alcohol i drank, in fact their actually encouraging me to have more thisevening, bcos where we bought it all for crimbo adn then most of us weren't 100% we still have quite a bit left, so i get to drink as much as i like. but even if they didn't like me drinking, i have a perfectly good excuse to; my new years resolution (not really a resolution but anyway...) is to put at least 1/2 a stone by my bday, which means i would then be about 9 stone *amazing how someone of my build can weigh soo much!* just had to do a whole paper round rather than the normal half a round that i do cos my bro did my half yesterday so that i cu go and see LOTR so i had to do his half today. Am now extremely nackered *which wud explain the crap that i'm typing* LYNNE! Dont u eva do that to us again, u woke up more or less everyone thismorning txting jenny, we managed to go back to sleep but we were not best part pleased when we woke up and found out that it had been jenny's fone beeping bcos u had txt her despite the fact that u must have known that we wud still be asleep bcos we had been up late (4 o'clock to be precise). We were playing dance mat at 2am. anyway gonna shut up. *someone tell me y i always end up saying that......*xoxoxoxox

 do you have any objections to me putting our random scribblings on my webpage as i think they are quite amusing!!! xx

 Ahh sorry, I still love you but I need to do someone's birthday present so I don't have time! Sooory! Check out my moral blog if you really are going to suffer from cravings: urlLink http://moralplains.blogspot.com/

 It's snowing! It's actually snowing in Bristol! And it only took ten years for it to properly snow again! Yes, I have frolicked in the snow, but I'm still really excited and hyper! Woohooo! And yes, I have walked through it until I got caked. Nothing can stop my hyper happeeeness! Ahh well some things will... but I won't let them happen! (Everyone has to not say anything now!) I loooove snow though... I wonder where this obsession came from? Oh god, not another obsession! Also I'm becoming obsessed with polar bears although I think that has something to do with giving up chocolates and sweets for lent. That big shock to my system has to have affected it a lot! I keep forgetting as well and going to eat chocolate, it hasn't reached my conscious yet but then some things never do. Ahh well guess I'll have to wait another ten years for it to snow again. Might as well go roll around in it.

 am busy sorting out the pics on my website, at the mo they are all of dominic monaghan and orlando bloom and elijah wood. cant find any really nice ones of johnny depp, not enough to create a link to another page and make a page about him.i need at least 5. my address is www.blondebombshell.tk in case u were wondering which u probably werent but never mind c ya xxx

 We're going back to school... Well we're probably get dragged back. That would explain why Lifehouse music is booming out of the house, the haze of insence smoke and the lack of lights. Worth a try, but nothing's gonna save us. Woohoo for monotonous living! Actually... it's crap, but nevermind my life changes but working life seems to ...not. I think I'm just gonna have to buy a pair of tye dye thongs from Izzy and wear them over my trousers. No one would notice though, for me wierd is normal. Ahhhh! Anyway, stuff has happened. Like... I've become friends with one of my brothers friends so he's kind of 'warning' me not to be, and destroying a picture of the guy he sent to me. Hehe, tis quite funny really. Apart from the whole locking the front door, not letting me out thing. Ah well.

 Im back!! There really is no need to run and hide, thank you!! For those of you who care, I had a great time and my hair is now even blonder!! An icscuse to be an idiot me thinks!! xx

 still trying to sort out pics for my collage but having lots of fun drooling over the pics that i find *!!!!!!!* hee hee hee hee!!! o god im in a giggly mood! cant wait to gt my new fone but it aint coming til end of march but it will be soo cool once i have it. will have to txt you my number cos it will be different cos i am going onto orange. cya xxxx

 was completely knackered all of yesterday cos of you katie!! hee hee! had fun though.was supposed to be going shopping with my rents today but got into a big arguement with them cos they lost my kangol trousers and i didnt have anything to wear. going to dans this evening so that should be fun apart from the fact that i look like crap today. then tomorrow i have to work and in the evening me anna claire laura and samantha are going to il bots which we decided last weekend whenn we were sat on the swings at hannah more park. at the moment am in the process of collectng pics for my orlando bloom/johnny depp/dominic monaghan/elijah wood collage!!!!! g2g cya xxxxxxx

 urlLink Police rapped for detaining war protesters Ahh yes, justice at last.

 Currently: Our Lady Peace - Is Anybody Home Hmm... to go to the party tonight or not? Hey I actually need a hair wash! (even my bandana can't help me now!) Anyway, seeing as the second christ and the next reincarnation of buddah haven't appeared yet I've given up hope and instead I'm gonna have a Johnny Depp night! Yeaym at last a true god who comes with good looks and sexiness! (Ignoring the whole wife and children thing)

 hee hee! went round to anna's yesterday. it was me, anna, samantha and claire. we watched shakespear in love *its crap!* and then we walked to mace and then back to the park. we had soo much fun. me and samantha got a bit hyper and giggly. i have found the perfect formula to get you hyper; 2 bottles of dr pepper and a couple of bags of skittles. we didnt have the dr pepper yesterday but we had a bag od skittles, chocolate raisins, starburst and i had a bit of a pick'n'mix. i still didnt get any valentines cards. boo hoo! i knew i wouldnt, i neva have had any. if you ask me valentines day sucks!!!!! :( c ya xxxxxxxx

 Eh I need a guy? *screams and runs around* Sorry can't talk, doing the relative visiting thing, so I'll be with people I love *aww* and I don't need to pay for a crappy card! Woohoooo! Seriously in NEED of a lie in and a day with no drink!!! See you Tuesday. Well actually I'll come on and blog about crap cause I'm tired! Yup, it is obvious isn't it. Bisi. Have a nice black valentine.

 katie, to get round this whole I need love thing wot you do is get one of your friends, for example Laura and tell her that you love her (in a friendly non lessie way) and then she tells you da same back, and you realise that really u dont need guys, as friends really do love you and are there through thick and thin because of the love they have for you, guys are just a different kettle of fish all together. Anna and I tried it in a very boring German lesson the other day and we felt lots better, then we had to list good things about ourselves. Basically we all need to be pro me (or pro yourself, wotever way you look at it, its the same!!) This could well be my last blog before I go skiing so, adios amegoes and Happy Valentines day, love you both lots!! See you when I get back. Mwah xx

 okay i will tell u that it is not bright pink! my rents think we're all mad. with all the pink and the dressing up and all. i found kens sunglasses!!!! i found them among my pressies so i will have to give them to emma tomorrow. hee hee! am still trying to think of something to have for my bday, but whatever i decide i ownt get it on tuesday, its too late now. so my bday is gonna be pretty crap. my mum liked the photos that i got on friday but hse sed its a shame that i didnt get one of everybody. emily wants a copy of some of them so at some stage i have to load them onto my computer. robyn also wants a copy so i will have to email them to her. soooo much to do and such little time *considering changing the length of a day to 48 hours...* it wouldnt work would it *rethinks plans and gives up* o well. g2g xxx

 Oh yeah Laura, like we couldn't guess already that you're gonna turn up in illuminous pink. Aww, I haven't got a date! Izzy's got Pete... Sam's got Dan... Emma's got Ken... *sigh* Guess I'll just have to get Ken to set me up with a guy... *shiver* Hehe (So isn't thinking of sending Emma a valentines ecard from Ken) Yup... (Isn't checking out if they do them) AHHHH! Phew, breathe breathe. Geez the Barbie website's scary. It's like kids get brainwashed, like they're coming out of a factory pre-programmed to want to grow up, get married, have children, and die quietly. Nope, maybe not the life for me. I'm gonna die kicking and screaming! (Hopefully that won't be because someone's trying to strangle me)

 katie stop talking to yourself! went into bristol today to get bday pressies, and failed miserably. went in with no bday pressies (except the ones from last nite) and came out with no pressies but did come back with a new top and some trousers. also got my material and have have chosen the pattern for my ball dress. it is going to look gorgeous but it is a surprise as to what colour it is. g2g xxxxxxx

 Onoly two things to do in this mood: get depressed or amazingly angry. Rage against the machine should help. Ahh I love them :) urlLink http://dear_raed.blogspot.com/ "The station-breaks on it have people sounding like the Simpsons saying things like I havent had so much fun since Afghanistan this is such bad taste, its hilarious." BWAAAHHH face my wrath George Bush. When I'm older I will change the world. I will demonstrate. I will sit on the street and revise every human right so that I know that I am in the right. I will change the world! It's my only aim in life. Who cares what your job is, if you haven't engraved yourself into a bit of the world then what's the point? Maybe that's where my passion is.

 Depress-ed. But not crack-ed. Need time to think-ed cause I thunk-ed but I can't think-ed. *thanks Edd!* Don't blame me, blame my state of mind. *crappy psychotherapy doesn't even help!* Just kidding! Boy, what I would do to get a psychiatrist. (Idiot, if you do anything you're gonna get one!) Maybe I should just become one and save this country some money.

 Feeling soooo much better! *bows down to person who made water bottles* *falls over clutching stomach* Ahh well, I'll be fine in the morning *i guess* Hmm, brackets don't really work for anecdotes do they? You can't really put them into writing, well not into story telling. Must be a social thing or something *doesn't really know* Eeek I should be picking my A level choices! It's gotta be in by Friday! *crap!* For once in my life I better actually not miss the deadline!

 *plans to get high on lucozade some day and change the layout* Yup, one of these days... Oh wait a sec *plans to get high on lucozade and kidnap someone who can change the layout* Much better. :( The Real Big Fish / Goldfinger tickets are sold out! They're the best bands ever! *waaah!* Guess I'll have to go see Hundred Reasons instead *sigh* Ahh well, they'll rock my lame ass anyway. *or should it be arse?* Never really got that. Oh wait... I found the tickets! Yeay! Now I just need to get a lift there and back and money for a ticket... umm... anyone offering? Sorry, I've been reducing to shopping on the net cause I feel sicky and no one's here to throw up on! *mind you, if i was you reading this bright pink freak blog i think i would want to throw up on me* Go download some Jeff Buckley, you don't really need to resort to shoving fingers down your throat.

 *floats in with a haze of lemon grass incense smoke* *checks that it isn't poisonous...* Crap.

 Keeping secrets is important cos it emans that the person can trust you. I'll only ever tell some one else if i think it is really important that they no *like they've seen some ones boyf cheating on them or woteva*. Generally if I have a secret I tell everyone in due course anyway so there isnt really any reason for you lot to talk about me BEHIND MY BACK! but if i dont want everyone to no then i dont tell anyone. The first people that i alwas tell stuff are emily *cos i have a stupid number of lessons with her*, samantha and anna *cos they r my bessie mates* and robyn *pretty bloody obvious why*. God i am starting to sound old! gotta go, some people have just signed in! xxxxx *hugs and kisses*

 I guess what you keep a secret and what you keep a secret within a group are two different types *duh* The first one's more scary. I'm bad though, I tell everyone everything most of the time, and if I don't I just tell Laura and we sit down and go "God that's so bad" for about half an hour. But keeping something a secret only hurts other people. Let's face it, one person alone gives crap advice, stick two people onto them and suddenly they're the next Rikki Lake. And they're wearing spandex. *ahh!* But if someone's talking to you it means they want help, or if you're a pessimist and believe that your grandma's trying to kill you, you think they want attention. Whatever they want, just be there from them. And if they've shot me remember to tell the police.

 my god. i no i hv sed it hundreds of times but my dress is going to be THE best! my mum has cut out all the pieces and it is going to be amazing. Pigeons are penguins. now b4 u go 'shes off her trolley again' i am not i merely sed the wrong thing at wrk. i was sat at the front of the shop minding my own business, there was a stupid dog tied to a tree and some pigeons eating a biscuit. the dog starts barking at the pigeons, debbie asks wot the racket is, adn me being me i shouted back 'dont worry its jst some silly dog barking at the penguins!' trust me, bloody typical. my nu fone still hasnt been dispatched but kes i will email everyone wen my nu number comes and then it is up to u 2 put it in ur fone if u want it. cos i f u dnt and u txt my old fone u will get my mum or my dad, *and that does mean going and sending txts to my parents 'by mistake' sayiing things like 'u no that guy u like' or woteva*. I got paid yesterday! but they put tax on it when they arent supposed to but we r gonna claim back wot they took off which means i will get 248.something!!!!!!! to add to the 532 that i already have, but 248 is 2 1/2 months wages, more or less. hmmmmm.................................need to talk to anna and samantha bt s is round dans and i dnt no where anna is and i dnt hv ne cred on my fne! o well xxx

 Hi I'm the one that randomly appears on this says very little, never says anything intelligent and usually agrees with Kes, and I'm about to do it again! That made sence, my first impressions of people that I met at primary school still stand and I think that they probaly will for the rest of my life. I also think that in the long term your first opinions are usually your final ones, what is it they say, once a bitch always a bitch?? Sorry I'm having an actual break from coursework for a change, I'm a bit annoyed with it so am leaving it for 10 minutes listening to some loud music and then I'm going to go back and tackle it. We had this silly revison seminar today. I expect that some people found it helpful, but personally I did not. I want to have a rant but don't know what to rant about, actually yes I do. I have some friends who tell me things and then expect me not to tell anyone else, this is all good and fair but do they not realise that this is putting alot of pressure upon you? For example Bob tells you that Jim has been sleeping with Sue, whilst Jim was going out with Jane. How are you meant to react?? (That little story was purely fictional I just made it up, no one is sleeping with each other, well they are but you know what I mean!! I hope!?) How are you meant to keep something like that to yourself? So you learn to live with it, when Jane says to you that she has secretly been doing things with Fred?? Please please please bear in mind that I have made this up!!! I actualy have made it up so dont go saying that one of r mates has dun this and the otha has dun that. Anyway back to my rant.............. So you know these two things and dont know what to do when Martha and her cat cum up and tell u that they have been beaten up by sum fatty blokes. But you cant tell anyone because then they'll get beaten up again!! This is the dilema that many of us face daily, do you say something to someone and face the consequences of your actions or do you keep quite and keep on mulling over what is going on in your head. I'm a person who usually tells because aledgedly a problem shared is a problem halved, but is that really true?? And dont you want to protect your mates, cos int that what a good mate should do??? xx

 Isn't it strange what changes your perception of someone? Like you may think that someone has no friends, but then they always do. Everyone always knows someone that you don't, has been somewhere you haven't and knows things you don't. Somehow they always want to rub this in your face. "Oh, you don't know Bob?" Then Bob turns out to be the saddest person on the planet who's hobbies is collecting glass. But you weren't to know that, and for all you know Bob might be the next Bon Jovi *better not to know him then* I still haven't placed some people. They're swimming round in my head. What makes someone cool though, or funny? Does one thing that they say alter your whole view of them and should it? I guess it depends what it is. If it's something really prejudice or anti-you then maybe it should *sudden pear craving* but if it's only something that they say off hand *is that a real word/thing?* then maybe it shouldn't. Most people say that first impressions always count and it's hard to change those. So people that you've known for years base their view of you on how they first say you all those years ago? Maybe I should become a Psychiatrist. Then I can think of all these questions for other people to answer. :D Uhh... or maybe Mr Nutbrown *my english teacher* will lock me in a room till I think of the answers... Hmm... *insert clever conclusion here, or in the comments box :P*

 Ahh head ache. Ah well, loud music anyway! Woohoo! Mmm... I did have something to blog about, I swear! Oh yeah.. about Coke. Not satisfied with killing prople of the third world, the company decided to start on England by bringing out Dasani TM 'A little bottle of time' (ie ticking time bomb that's gonna kill you) urlLink http://uk.news.yahoo.com/040319/325/eozdd.html Actually... it wasn't that dangerous. You'd probably have to drink about a bath's worth to actually get cancer from it though. But still! Coke are evil! *don't make me give you the coke talk again* Yup, there's a lot of boycotting out there to do and I intend to stick to it! *hell, there'll probably a boycott to boycott my boycott but that would just be confusing.* Umm... my pc's cracking so I'll have to post later.

 aaaah! my mum has started to make my ball dress and it is soooo confusing *tho confusing me isnt hard*. Its 10:14am and i am still in pyjamas cos i cant be bothered to get dressed. according to my mum i am looking for ball shoes and a bag and jewellery. as my dress is lilac i am having silver accessories as i decided it would be too hard to try and find lilac ones!!!!!! *whoever heard of lilac jewellery that wasn't plastic* I had work yesterday adn sepnt most of my time doing my media coursework. it was sooo quiet, just becos there were 3 of us there rather than 2. and the stupid wind kept blowing open the door *which has a beeper* so that kept annoying us cos we thort it was someone coming in to be served. bye bye xx

 not sure where the link has gon ull have to find it urself its on funnynet.com i think, i dont know cos i followed a link! xx

 urlLink go visit this site, its a thing to see if you were a child from the late 80's early 90's, by heck is it true!! I nodded in agreement to many of them. please go check it out!! Have nearly finished my Media studies coursework, just have to write sum stuff change a couple of fonts and wala!! hee hee my french sux. Im not very happy, my mate Emz sent me a txt asking if i wanted 2 go up 2 da mall wit her and sum otha cdty people, cos apparently they'l "luv me"!!! But i cant cos i have too much work and now have no fone credit left! :( O well, how does that song go; things can only get better?!! Bu labour did use it as their campain song so ill shut it!! xx

 For Mothers Day I got my mum some fair trade roses :D Aren't I just darling? Hehe go download Pudelsi - Tango Libido soooo funny! Hehe, this is just too stupid... ahh new theme tune for me. Mmm quite scary that I can actually imagine listening to it! Oh, I'm doing a tango for one of my compositions so that's why I'm listening to it! Not too random. Wow, it just got cooler, the 70s backing singers! Yeay! Ahh, it's people like Pudelsi *is it a person* who make GCSE music worth doing... heheee! she plonta? What's that all about...? Anyway back to a slightly more interesting for you but less for me point.... Taaangoooo Libiiiidoooo! *ahem* Oh, it's Polish! That's why it's so strange to listen to! Geez five minutes? No chance! I also got myself some fair trade chocolate! The fair trade freak in me has been set free! No one is safe! Well... actually you are unless I see you near Nestle products. And fair trade clothes too! Yeay! So go order a catalogue ok? urlLink http://www.peopletree.co.uk

 Me no have good day. Me lock out house second time two hours. Ahh well, life's life. But damn some people can moan better than others! This will be an optomistic post damn it! Well... starting from here it will be! Wow I'm so happy! All these wonderful exams! *sarcasm is pessimisum right?* Me thinks so. Oh shit I've got some over due by a month music theory to do. Ah well, bibi. Woohoo for pessimisum! Woohoo for lack of grammar education in schools!

 i was in txtiles til 5:30 after skool. how stupid is that *never let miss tell u 'all u need to do is....'* am completely knackered and i still have a pile of coursework that is about as tall as i am *maybe a slight exagaration*. I have just been emailed a quiz from tim, its a 'how well do you know me? quiz' and there are questions on there that u lot wouldnt know about me! *damn now there gonna wanna no everything* i will make one for u lot and see how much u dont no about me! xx

 Ahh I'm having a crap day. I blame all that chocolate I ate! I insulted my french teacher by telling her that I think Wales is dirty. But I didn't know what the french word for Wales meant! Anyway how was I supposed to know she was Welsh? Basically, big OOPS. But I would never say that anyway. Mmm... I just need to go to sleep, that always solves everything, I need to recharge my hyper batteries. Then I got locked out of my house for a hour and a half cause my brother had my key and didn't leave it for me to find. I gave it to him cause he wanted to get it! Yup, definatly cursed. Then just generally being an ass all day, not good! Guess I'll have to bugger lent and go eat a load of sinfully dark chocolate. Sounds good, ne?

 O well done for lasting so long Katie, I'm proud of you!! I've gone mad again, my mum seems to think im going out with a guy 5ft tall and thats bout it really!! I watched that new programme on channel 4, the OC, its really gd, tacky American and good. Anyway I had best be off im sure there is something good on telly as I am a little bored!! xx

 Yeah I guess that last post was a bit random... Lustful? Moi? Nah I'm a complete angle! *Hehe fools!* Ah guess I better stop eating all those aphrodisiacs... and start a new paragraph... Anyway I was doing good yesterday! I was at the co-op promoting fair trade products, surrounded by fair trade chocolate samples... But I held out! (for about two hours) Then I gave in and ate a load. :D I guess about two weeks of lent is enough really. Seeing as heaven doesn't exisit and all, it was more like a test of will and an experimental try and be healthy for a bit. Guess it failed. Ah well, back to chocolate... Mmm... Green & Blacks Organic orange chocolate is definatly to die for!

 Aww, but everything's my business! Yup, today's been a wierd day. We had our year group photograph taken, ahh any chance to miss a lesson. Oh, and Dave's had a brain scan, *we loooove you dave don't go normal on us!* Ah, who's the we? Hundred Reasons tomorrow! Woohooo! Actually, I was thinking about going freakily dressed!

I dunooo! + I'm getting my hair cut so pretend to notice tomorrow!

 Katie, yes it was a guy the email was to and no, its none of ur business!!! My sister got hold of the sacred scroll adn read some of the stuff, lets just say she may never talk to any of us ever again! Was at work yesterday so am completely knackered *its sooo hard doing practically nothing all day*, and then i was playing board games again last nite becasue i had no one to go out with adn no where to go! I live such an exciting life. In fact its soo exciting i get to spend today tidying my room and then i have to go down the RC to watch my mum play my bro at his own game! *btw, the answer to my current screen name is not perspex man and i am not going to tell you the answer no matter what u do. u'll have to kill, and then you wont get the answer anyway cos i'll be dead* xxxx

 Oh it's fair trade fortnight! (Have I mentioned this already?) urlLink http://www.fairtrade.org.uk/get_involved_fairtrade_fortnight_2004.htm I'm gonna go help out in the co-op promoting fair trade stuff. I'll use my new found mafia techniques to convinse people to buy it. Or I'll drug the coffee. Warning. You don't want to meet me there. I'm gonna be on a mountanous moral high ground. And hell I'm gonna have a cape and a spandex outfit.

 Lol Laura. So it's a guy you're sending this email to? Teachers are dumb when it comes to notes. So long as you're writing something, and looking at them intelligently they think you're doing the work. Fools. Oh, have you heard about the theft story yet? It's official, me and Izzy are outlaws. :P Not exactly your average criminal but hey, variation helps the world go round. There was a painting of Izzy's being displayed in the entrance hall that she didn't want there and didn't give her permission to be there so obviously we went and nicked it. Hehe, or I convinsed her to *i'm a bad influence on everyone* So we legged it down to the drama block, and tried to take the picture out. Then Izzy broke the glass *cringe* into three perfect bits *wow, isn't that lucky! it's a real story though kids, don't try this at school. my freak luck doesn't rub off on everyone* she must have been leaning on it or something... Then all these kids came in cause it was 'there room' so we made up some lame excuse like 'modern art' and told them not to tell anyone. *sheesh gullable* Then we legged it and asked Pete what to do. He didn't know so we legged it back to the frame and Izzy panicked. But I was cool and calm, hehe I could be a con artist! Izzy wanted to take the 'dump it and run' option, but who the hell would nick a painting, take it out and dump the frame? Oh, I mean who would nick a school persons painting? So we took it up to the art block, glass and all. We told them that some kid had nocked it off the wall during between lesson time, it broke and it took us 90 minutes to get it to them cause of various things. Man we're good. Muhahahaaaa.... I could be the next evil mastermind in a James Bond movie.... Or a Disney movie, I'm willing to start small and work my way up. :) Little bit psychotic. Totally in control.

 KATIE!!!! THE SACRED SCROLL IS IN MY KEEPSAKE BOX!!!!!!! :):) Mr Linnitt is soo gullible. he just lets me do wot i want. i told him we hadn't been writing notes and he goes okay. and then he got me an elastic band without asking y. i love it when teachers are push overs!!!! i get away with murder! any way gotta go finish writing an email to someone (and its not perspex man for ur info!!!!! :) ) xx

 Mmm... Alice in Chains is definatly a good band to listen to when your angry. It's easier than shouting go away at whoever opens the door, and hey I need self expression. The piano was too hard to play today, so I got someone else to express for me. Maybe I just need a monkey and a drum. That would keep me happy. *?* Yup, it's probably my hormones running around. They keep knocking into walls though. And it's black.

 Bonjour, I'm doing some online shoe shopping, yay!!! Meant to be working but am taking a break, need 2 stop and breath. i have heard of 100 reasons and there gd, dont treat me like a plank, have u heard of the distillers??? Spect not!! xx

 MATHHHHS! What is a reciprocal! Woohoo for A level! Nevermind, I'll just bugger further maths. I wonder if vegans condone the use of maths in school?

 Err... that's a bit scary Laura! I didn't think you had any secrets! (Muhahaaa I know everything!) Wooow, I just watched Vampire Hunter D! Tis v. amazing! Aww, I love it's wierdness and english voice actors, they're all sooo low that you can't hear them! Yeay, we're going to see Hundred Reasons next Tuesday! They're cool! Any one heard Him? Err... they deserve a ... .

 OMG! How wierd was I today?! Odd statement to make but...yeah... anyway...I was just stupidly extremely happy today, for like the first time in ages. Any suggestions? Cos seriously I have no idea! Anna said that it might be radiation (we were in physics at the time) but thats not possible cos I am not exposed to excessive radiation! : ) RANDOM HAPPINESS! I need an answer!!!! its driving me nutty. there is only one time that i can remember feeling like this and that was, like, about 2 years ago, i think summer 2002 if you can remember what happened then. if not i will not explain because you were probably one of the only people that wasn't told about my little secret. : ) : ) : ) : ) hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee!!!! cya xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx : )

Fun for winding people up with though *not that i have...* It actually a lump of ice-cream covered in chocolate and extra bits so you get this really hard lump that's inedible. *i guess describing it like that didn't help* Eeek I think I might end my blog here before it gets worse... *i also have to go do stuff. i really do have a life you know!* (Yeah right.)

 urlLink TPS Registration Why did no one tell me about this before? Finally, a legal way to actually block spam calls. And if they do get through you can complain and they get sued. So everyone's happy! And it doesn't cost money! Yeay! Not that I didn't like talking to all those nice people who were trying to sell me cars... Unsolicited? Me thinks yes. All I need now is a massive block of cheese covered in chocolate to make my day complete.

That's why I have to drag all your butts out of your houses and get you guys to do stuff! Really :P And you lot are soooo heavy! *hehe tis fun to insult peeps when they can't insult me back* Anyway, I think I might have burned off som calories while I was typing so I'll have to go back downstairs and eat more chocolate.

 Yeay it's a open mouth insert foot day! Kinda feels like you've been detached from your body. You're looking at the fool who's spouting all this crap and obviously being clumsy with everything. Then you realise it's you. Crap. Might as well keep going anyway.

It's sooo annoying! What else can I have as a gift for passing my GCSE's? (It's impossible for me to fail) I've been chained to the pc now until the page loads *damn page work!* Apart from that... freedom from school! For a whole two weeks before the exams! Yeay! I'm having a seven dwarfs gathering on Tuesday, everyone has to dress like one of the seven dwarfs and sing along to Disney videos! What a great break from revising!

(That's kinda the theory that goes for this year though) Oops... I honestly plan to start revising someday soon... maybe tomorrow or the day after! I'll just have to kidnap somepeople to help me revise *excuse to stop revising*

 OOOOOHHHHHHHH MMMMMYYYYYYYYY GGGGGOOOOOOOOODDDDDDDDDDDD!!!!!!!!!!!! Friends has finished!!! (Did u like the Janice impression there??!!)i watched the video of it that i recorded last night, this morning and had a little cry :( my mum and sister were laffing at me, they do not realise the sentamental value that it has, Anna and i have discussed it and decided that life will never be the same again. On an even more depressing note, Big Brother is back aaaaghhhh, find a rock and hide! Im waiting to try and find this evilness quiz but its taking forever! Grrr OOO here we go...., or not!! ....... Have given up, im obviously just too nice. Such a shame!! xx

 Ahh half term, a week free from exams but full of stress and revision. It really must be getting to me... I've started to listen to bad music and music is one of my outlets for expression... 'Free Falling' is a bit past it! *Only cause I watched Jerry Maguire the other day!* I'll just have to try my best to stay sane until Glastonbury and after the exams, after that it doesn't matter what I do!

 urlLink Kill the background music - take the quiz. Quite easy really! Oh, we've got two English tests tomorrow and then a week of freedom! Might get a bit deep and blog about ethics... it's what tests do to you!

 Yeeeah the novelty (new blogger layout) Ahh had my first test today = :| It was Spanish listening and it was stupidly hard! One of the guys had a really low voice, and they didn't do the whole speaking happily when they were being positive thing! How confusing :P Ah well, I'm sure the almightly power of fluke will pull me through some how. Was kind of scary though... we've actually reached our exams. Yeay for Glastobury after them!

 This new blogger thing is strange!! OOO... Im really sad about leaving school, think of all the nice people we may never see again like Katie Quin, im gonna miss her. They are playing abba on radio 1, im scared. O well. How was your first day at work Katie, I have spent the day revising it has been sooo fun! Plus to top it off i have a relly sore throat and cant talk, and charz de gal airport has fallen apart, which is where im flying into in just over a month. WOOOOOOO!!

 The Class of 2004 has finally broken up! Aww, and a whole two days study leave until I see people again, how will I cope? :P What stupidity, having the ball then doing all our exams! Oh well, it was cool.*two late nights = :|* Sooo tired. I'm actually moving forwards though, tomorrow's my first day of work and I'm going a little bit non-revision crazy which isn't too good... ooops. Sorry pessimism. urlLink www.nailsea-school-2004.tk There's the point to this blog. Don't worry, I won't blog during the exams! It's our year's forum thingy so you can talk to people from our year, which is kind of pointless cause we don't not know them yet so we can't isult people!

 Ahh damn, no one told me Eurovision was yesterday. Oh well, woohooo! I missed it - yeah! I was revising instead... that's not good. Stupid amount of exams are gonna come my way in the next few weeks, why the hell do we do 11 subjects anyway? It's just stupid. Damn educational system. Damn testing. Damn my Birthday's in the middle of it :( In all my Birthday cards there's gonna be good luck with your exams notes. I shall never be freeee! I'm gonna go soooo insane when we get to Glastonbury! I wish we were there now!

 Err... go see a shrink dear :P Anyone gonna watch Eurovision? Eugh, I know, it's complete crap and I'll be revising but stil... urlLink http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/eurovision/2004/contestants/ I say go Albania! It's really annoying how most of the songs are in English, come on people be proud of your nationalities! Sorry, strage mood. I'm trying to swap all the Spanish that I have in my head for Frech and it's not that easy.

 I NEED SOME ONE TO STOP ME HAVING A BREAK DOWN!

 kes have u gone insane, and wots this about a stalker? r u seeing things again? have you been drugging again?! or have you just lost it (again!)?! hmmmm.....theres lots of frogs in my garden at da mo. it is very funny. we reckon if we rounded them all up thered be at least 20-25!!!! there taking over the world! Woohoo! UP WITH THE FROGS,DOWN WITH THE HUMANS! *erm...do u think i might be back2front?* does anyone else watch 'SMILE' on a sunday morning, if so i have found the Nev Games. go to urlLink www.bbc.co.uk/cbbc/games and then click on the pic of Nev and then which game you wanna play. but for it to work properly you have to have a good internet connection thats pretty fast *like the ones at school* otherwise they take ages to load and then they move really slowly hmm.i really feel like ice dream gonna go find some bye xxxxx

 Hmm.. seems like my stalker *who for some weird reason is called Iain* wants a place on my candy floss page. *note: need more dental floss* Oh dear guess I'll have to bury myself into layers of HTML *literally* Why aren't monkeys trained to do this stuff? Oh wait, they are, but in companies. Damn, have to get me one of those. Well, if any stalkers out there want a place to call home on the net feel free to have a bit of the corner of my blog *no teeth marks please* and keep the graffiti to a minimal: you're blogs shit and you can't spell! If everyone respects these rules we'll get on fine... (just stay away from the fridge)

 Todays a goth day. And we all know what that means - loud Metallica, depressing bad vibes that seem to spread everywhere and stress. Ok, so maybe stress is always an issue... or maybe it's all in our heads seeing as it isn't anything physical... so it's all in our heads! Obviously my way of dealing with unhappiness is to get so confused that I can't remember what I'm sad about! It works too, until about two days later when I can't remember why I'm unhappy and why the cat is locked in the fridge. Ahh well, I'll just blame my brother and continue blissfully unaware *then about two days after that I'll go crazy* Oh, my brother's back from hospital which is cool. The phone will be jammed with all the calls though, and the tv will be playing non stop kiddy stuff *it's what happens to you when you're ill* I guess I'll just have to hide upstairs and revise. Have a nice day and try and stay upwind from the evil goth vibes. Peace, love and cheese cake *and hopefully someone will teach you how to spell and you won't be deluded by my bad use of english*

 Hey guys! I changed the blog. The whole archive thing was just tooo annoying... oh and it'll take about half an hour to actually post something on this! Argh! Oh well... tis worth it to spread the love! :P *yeeeeah* And everything went with the old layout... where's my weather pixie?!?!?! Oh and the little pink tag board went as well but I get to do less clever work now so I'm happy! Yeay back to vegetive state! Woohoo! Oh, and I'll make it so anyone can comment *no swearing, and we know about five languages so no foreign swearing!* And I'm as crazy and stressed as ever! Yeay! I actually should get a revamp in my head one of these days... hmm maybe after my mid-life crisis I'll consider it. Woohoo for lack of spell check!

 aaaaw poor little kez! *Big Hug*. am still really knackered, lack of sleep. have stuck loads of post it notes around my room (much to the annoyance of my sis) with facts about A.W and Medicine! was supposed to do athletics today but friday nite i slept awkwardly and managed to pull all the muscles in my ribs again so i cant breathe properly. and i was soo tired that i cudnt take another early morning *what idiot decides that we have to be at portishead at 8:15 in the mrning!*. *daydream* i keep doing that and i dont no y, any ideas or explanations?!?!?!

 Ahh lack of posting, lack of revision, lack of rational thought. Well it can be explained I guess... apart from the whole random crying thing the other night. My brother is in hospital cause he's got appendicitis, my aunty's got cancer, so's my Grandpa and I've got a lot of stress about exams and everything. Actually... good excuses to go mad aye? Well... I was thinking about putting psychosis down on a form the other day as 'medical information' because I never put anything which is really boring! And hey, I need to be different! Err... sorry tv, as much as I love five hour old movies I think I'll have to miss this one. Geez... it's like lemmings! Loads of people/little green blobs running around and being stupid. Oooh... good thing for exam stress / lack of knowledge about who you are - Lifehouse. Yeay! Mmm... I think I might go sniff some glue :P

 urlLink there you go im sporty hee hee

 Rubber Ducks?!

 urlLink So what if I was trying to buy rubber duckies on the internet :P

 OMG OMG OMG! I tried on my ball dress a minute ago. its not quite finished but it is absolutely 100% f***ing amazing!!!!!!! and the i put he shoes on and it looked even better and then i got the bag and OMG it is just sooooo brilliant!!! *not meaning to rub it in at all.....* going shopping in bristol tomoz, spend some money! YAY! if u went to dans hope u had fun. cya monday! xx

 pink bananas?! Interesting concept, so weird it may just work! lol. no u katie, u can make it work! Woo, GO KATIE! cant wait til tomoz lunch, i love pizza! but i dunno whot to wear, whether to wear my little black dress which i have worn yet or wear the stuff i wore to my aunties wedding or something entirely different again! Will decide when i see the weather tomorrow! I have finally figured out why it is i have been so miserable recently. I was supposed to be going on hols with samantha and claire and emmy, but then our plans fell thru for a number of reasons. the theory only came to me yesterday when my dad decided that i was invisible and he could just talk to liam, who i ws trying to talk to, over me. and thats it, when i am with my friedns i can get myself heard cos i have more power over you lot than i do with my family, and i am more at ease with u lot, and thats wot i missed. i wanted to be able to have the power for a whileand i just wnted to be away from my parents so that i had control over my own life for a while am alot happier now that i hv realised this but i wud have prefered to hv realised it earlier!

 I dunno about the evil thing. Shouldn't we rebel against the state? I don't think people who are weak willed do rebel, it's the strong willed ones. These people exploit problems in the system. *yes, it's the system* There are people out there getting away with millions of pounds of fraud and yet for the public face we look down on petty thiefs more. I think people take things too far if they don't understand or can't empathise. We're all human! *well i'm obviously from Beta 5* Anyway, seeing as my random ramblings aren't really that coherant... Back to thinking about how experiences affect you *always an easy mind numbing topic* Do you think people would be phased by pink bananas?

 YEAAAAAAAAAH! Glastonbury was soooo cool! I even have a bottle of Glastonbury mud! And we didn't care about the rain - it made it more fun! It was hot for half of the time anyway which was cool. I wore my sumo suit when it was sunny! Yup, I was the freak everyone pointed and laughed at. And it was fun! The whole experience was worth all the bother; the one and a half hours of hell, lugging around a massive bag, the money, the annoyance when it rained, and dealing with bugs in the tent. But then for all that you get a once *hopefully five :P* in a life time experience, with all the hippie extras that no where else would have! What other festival would have people doing free massages and a giant LOVE statue that you could sit on? And I got to see all these amazing bands! Damn, missed out on I am Kloot, and they're actually kinda good! Anyway... so much stuff in my head! I'll go phone someone otherwise I'm gonna piss everyone off :P Haha, inflict it on one person only :D

 well, i had work today and me and debbie (who i work with) have decided the customers are getting more and more picky and just trying to cause a problem for us. Spoke to izzy's mum tho who came in to get her jackets dry cleaned for a wedding (?), she seemed rather surprised to see me, so i take it izzy didnt tell her! All i can really say today is HAHA! UR AT GLASTONBURY, OUTSIDE AND ITS RAINING!, where as i was at work in the dry and warm! lol

 Did u no that to join YHA for one year, for an U18 its only 7, thats really good, cos its for a year. A bit random i no but me and samantha mite be going t ostay in a youth hostel at some stage during the summer. Word has it that most people got invited round to jenny's this evening, those who werent on hols or werent already busy. well, i fell into neither of the previous catagories yet i wasnt invited. Thats gratitude for you, i spent ages trying to get hold of people so we could go out, half of them couldnt come so i wasted loads of credit and then they dont even invite me when they all go round someones house. I mean, i could understand if it was just really close people going round, but for god sake, shes invited emma *no offence to emma meant*, but her and emma hardly ever speak. It just seems really strange, i've even started coming up with conspiracy theories aswell, cos samantha and anna havent replied to the texts that i sent them. o well, no one loves, except for the guys last nite trying to save form the little twirps! lol xxx

 i disagree with you Katie, I think some people do not have the power to be good. These are the people who are weak willed and rebel and dont understand right and wron and when a joke isnt actually funny any more and when they have taken things to far *not talking about certain people inparticlur, honest*. I had such a good time yesterday. I am really glad i came out cos i wasnt gonna. Its a shame i had to leave just before 5 but then i wudnt have had a brill nite last nite. We went walking on the Mendips and it was soo cool. There were 8 of us, me, mike, steve, ross, ian bell, james rogers, reese owen and *dont no his his first name* crosby! We were at the sqdn choosing groups and i got shoved in the group with the little brats, but credit where its due, mike did try to save me from them but mr bloody fat bastard satcey wouldnt have that. So we went walking and then we got back to the mini bus and found out that ross and the two little ones in his group had got lost in the woods, so mr stacey and mr trenchard had to go find them while me, mike and steve and the rest sat in the minibus *me, mike and steve were eating my strawberry laces!*. but it was a good nite. would have been better without the brats but hopefully ext time i'll get put into a good group! This morning has not been soo good. My is snapped at me when i told her she should get up cos otherwise she was going t obe late, then a huge arguement erupted that ended with me slamming my bedroom door on her and then sitting down cos i felt faint and being told off for doing so and then falling up my ladder getting onto my bed. I have been sat in misery most of the morning and i have noone to talk to cos everyone has gone on holiday, so this weekend and all next week is gonna be so boring. i will keep postnig to let u no what happens in nailsea while ur off on ur jolly at glastonbury!

 But isn't evil a strange consept? Is it born from natural desires or beginnings, or is it something that we are subjected to? Something that we learn? Is it something that is born with us and dies with us or does it gradually develop if we are surrounded by people who encourage the behavior associated with evil acts? We all have the power to be evil and the power to be good. *couldn't you just tell that was coming?*

 Evil sides with Evil, and it cannot be stopped. An important lesson to learn when dealing with ignorant family members. I h8 my brother and sister sooo much it is unbelievable. We were sat having tea and they ganged up on me, taking the mick adn winding me up. I got upset, went upstairs but my mum persuaded me to finish my tea cos she didnt want me getting ill again so i went downstair to eat it, finished and then went and sat in the front room with mum and dad. I sed 'Why are there Evil things in this house?' and my dad started taking their side, saying they are not evil and that i provoke them adn do it to them and that i get all that i deserve. I dont no y but i just feel really down at the moment. Its probably the weather, and the stress and the fact that everyone is going away next week except for me, matt, dave, meg, claire, emily and emma. but chances are the only people who will come out everyday will be matt and dave, and i dont think i can spend a whole week with them. Its just not fair, i worked so hard to organise for me, samantha, emily and claire to go away, i made all the arrangements and found out prices etc and then they just gave up on the idea. o well, its not fair for u to listen to all of this. i'll go find somewhere else to rant at.

 Heeey Laura that sounds cool! Good luck planning everything - it's hard enough to get everyone to come to a party! But I'm sure everyone will go. Obviously it'll just be so that they can buy candy floss... but that's cool - we can steal it from them! Oh who cares if it rains, I have two heavy duty army poncho's that will fit at least three people under each one! And it would be cool. We could try to fly a kite! Of course everyone will have forgotten physics by then and probably try to fly the handle while holding the kite. Yup, sounds like good fun!

 Aww. Turning point in life. *just don't turn around, someone's bound to have left some screwed up stuff* Face it with naive optimism! Wish for the best and look to find it. Don't expect anything - go out and get it! Okay... prep talk over, ok everyone? *how patronising, make your own dreams and drive!* Uhh I guess I haven't been reading enough to communicate through words very efficiently. Damn, now I'm using long clever words! One more exam left, then our GCSE's will have completely finished. By Thursday we'll all be free! So don't just bum around at home, live the life that's out there! Don't rely on other people to wait for you otherwise you'll fall behind. Make it so that when you go back you have a whole load of stuff to tell people. Yup, confused brain. Hmm... must remember the Battle of Little Big Horn was in 1876... then everything will be fine... Or it will when m brain stops singing in exams! Aargh!

 God that last post was way tooo sane! I'm losing it, i am losing my insanity! aaah, that sounds about normal *does a quick trial run of freakiness on Megan , Megan just stares at me blankly* YAY! My brother came 5th out of some odd in 800m! (out of those doing GCSE P.E.) which i thort was quite good. not as good as my first (obviously not at school, cant beat bethan!) but good all the same, adn my sis came 6 out of 8 in 1500 for year 7, and 13th out of 20 year 7's and 8's overall, which was good. I am losing my hold, but i am health wise feeling pretty crap at da mo! I gotta go to the doctors at some stage cos my mum thinks i mite have skin cancer. She's probably just worrying too much! LAST EXAM TOMORROW! YAY! Cant believe its history, but hey who cares, no more exams. You lot can all come round to mine afterwards i wud expect, that is if u read this in time. but we'd have to go up in my room, and u'd have to sit on the floor, cos noone can sit on the bottom bunk cos its my sisters bed and only one can sit on the top bunk and thats me! lol xxxx

 Either Thursday 15th July, or Friday 16th July, I am thinking of planning for the whole group to go into weston, just have a chilled day down on the beach. we'd have to go by train, but that'll only be a couple of 's and then there would spending money, but i think it would be quite fun. Obviously it would depend on the weather and the number of people around that want to come, but all going wel, i think it would be really fun. tell me if ur interested

 Well, I went to my aunties wedding yesterday and it was soo much fun! After the Ceremony we went to this really nice pub, and had loads of nice food and took loads of photos. and then some of us went back to my aunties house (my family, my grandparents and my mums uncle and his sons) and all the kids, we were all in the garden mucking around. I was looking after Katie, megan and debbie were mucking around, and my brother was playing football with ricky, ben and dean. I dont no where emma was, apparantly her family havent seen her since easter when she walked out, and she didnt come to the wedding. It was really nice to be able to see everyone again. Ricky has the cutest cat, and his cat has kittens and they have two left, and they were trying to get my mum to bring it home but my dad wouldnt let us have it. It was soooo cute, it was ginger and white and i really wanted it. But what i was really amazed about was that me and ben are still quite close and so are me and Katie and we havent seen eachother for three years. since the christening. Ben was winding me up like he always does, telling dean to get me and kick the football at me but we both wind eachother up so we're even. as for Katie, she delighted in giving me a tour of the house, and dragging me outside and inside and outside and inside! It was such a good day. cant wait until the baby is born and it has its christening! But then there will be 7 kids!!!! god ive blabbered!

 Noooo there's loads of nice Vans shoes out there in size 7! You can even get womens Vans... such novelty! 25 on a pair of flip flops?That's actually kind of psychotic! I went shopping today and I got a german army waterproof poncho for 6! Hell it may smell funny but it's gonna keep me nice and dry at Glastonbury! *even if the hippies do give us dirty looks :P* I also bought some stupidly bright pink hair dye and I'm gonna take my inflatable sumo suit. So that means everyone has to watch all of Glastonbury and look out for me cause I'm definatly gonna be on tv! Just a bit scared that someone's gonna try to sumo wrestle me... but it'll be ok. I'll run away screaming. We also got glow in the dark stars to stick on our tent, we still won't be able to find it but it'll look really cool! Eugh slightly too much information on the whole Glastonbury plan. Muhahahaaa but I don't care - it's gonna be loads of fun! Warning kids, too much shopping and smelling funny plastic affects your brain in weird ways.

 Hummm liking the rant there. I buy mens running shorts because I dont want floressant pink ones and I always get strange looks!! O der I spent 25 on a pair of flip flops, nearly bought some rocket dogs in raw aswell but they didnt have my size, then I went on the hunt for a pair of vans but they didnt have them in my size anywhere. What is this, lets not do any nice shoes in a size 7?? Humm my shoes rant over. xx

 Why is it that in our society just because the younger generation doesn't have as much knowledge as the older generation people feel that they can abuse their ignorance? Shouldn't we encourage the younger generation to learn these things so that they won't get scammed and instead know their full rights? And for the lady at Cassidy's: it could have been a fancy dress party, and women can wear men's t-shirts, get over yourself! I don't want to rant. It feels like a waste of space.

 Ahh come on summer's gonna be sooo much fun! *i'm planning on spending the whole time not recovering from glastonbury* ... How many exams left? My brains too dead. 4. Argh! But then we'll have ageeees of freedom! Totally worth it. The only time in our entire school life that we won't have a legal obligation to go to school! Woohooo party! *or wait until you gett to glastonbury*

 god explainging to robyn that i mite not be able to go and visit her this summer in norfolk is like explaining to a brick wall that humpty dumpty is sat on top of it! Pointless! anyway.i have sooo many peeps i need to talk to about days out, like down to paignton and stuff. god i am going to busy this summer. and this summer is supposed to be my break! its too warm, or is it just me. i cant believe it is this warm and i'm not even slightly tanned. its just ridiculous. its being stuck inside revising. i mean, i know i cud do it outside but its just too distracting. better go. gotta revise for history..... *damn distractions*

 Hehe I would edit your last post Lynne but I'm not that nice! And it's obvious that we're shit at football anyway! Oh well :P Millionaires become so by being stupidly lucky half the time. The other half of the time they're people who aren't amazing but have a hell of a lot of dedication. Then somewhere there are people who are actually clever and become millionaires *i'm sure i'll fit in somewhere* :P Naaah I don't actually mean it, I would probably boycott myself if I did become a millionaire! So therefore tests are pointless and therefore is over-rated. Damn hyphens, who created them? They're sooo annoying! But anyway... it's A Levels that actually matter, they make up your UCAS points and that dictates which university you can get into. Still it's not good to totally fail your GCSE's, it's about proving something to yourself plus it can't be good for your confidence. Just try your best and do good! They onl matter for people who are leaving really. Also it's kinda good to get an A in that one subject where ou were predicted a C and the teacher patronised you all through GCSE's. Ahh I'm gonna enjoy that.

 I have to say I have given up caring about exams, no really! People make out that they are the be all and end all of your life, they are definatly not. So what you fail all of them, there is someone somewhere who will listen to what you have to say, and you will end up a millonaire. Or you could take them again, what does it matter?? That said I really need 2 work for history, such a shame!! Please dont let it slip out that my true love is karl the gay gnome, I love him too much and it may damage his reputation.....I shall be playing human ping pong though it sounds like great fun, not that I ever get that bored, deffo not! Hee hee! There are small children in my street chanting and blowing a loud hooter, is there like tennis or football on or something? That beckham bloke, really no idea!!!! NOT we are currently winning one nill to FRANCE! Tis amazing!! Best be off second half is just about to start.

 i am the only one in our group thats not completely freaking out about exams. well i am kinda freaking out about history, cos if i dont get a high enough english mark then i have to rely on my istory to get me into the psychology course. its quite amusing really cos most people think that i am amazingly clever and that i will fly throught the exams, but i'm not, i am shit at exams. yes i no alot but all the stuff i no about is completely irrelevant, unless they have started an exam on chart music, or on wildlife from al around the world. i mean, i can name an animal for every single letter of the alphabet.... a=antelope, b=butterfly, c=crocodile, d=duck-billed platypus *or wud that count as p?*, e=elephant, f=frog, g=gorilla, h=horse, i=iguana....etc, etc i am wasting my life but there is a good thing about exams. i have made many realisations. most people say dreams are about something that will happen in the near future. this is not true. ur dreams are always based on some thing that has happened in the last few days before it. also, in the R.E exam, it was saying that it was not gods fault that there is suffering in the world, it is our own but surely god created us in his image and he created us so therefore it is his fault due to causation. as you cans ee i spend too much of the time in my exams doing absolutely fuck all, and i think about things to much.

 Write about anything and everything! Like how you play the ping game when you look at people at the end of exams. *you can ping off people to see who they're looking at, and then who that person is looking at until you hit a wall or a clock...* Ping cause of computer stuff. And you can write about your true love: Karl the gay knome. Gnome? Where did knome come from? Oops 6 hours sleep not good. Anyway... that's enough random crap for today I have to save if for exams! *yup RE was one big block of random crap* Like history... how are we going to survive?

 Heylo! It's only me.... I 'm not really sure what to write.... Kes i'm sure you will get to glastonbury in the end, quite how though i dont know! I will get to Paris and all will be fine and dandy. I was doing yoga in my front room at about 1oclock this morning; Anna thought it would be fun!!! Its not!!! Heehee lalalala...... Had better go revise mwah xx

 It's weird not being at school. *damn analytical button is turned on... i should turn that off someday* Now we're not forced to spend time with anyone, or to see people that we don't like. We could go and hide in a hole I guess but there aren't holes big enough out there. But not being at school has kind of screwed the whole social system that we had going... not like anyone was really paying attention to it anyway. All the layers have been destroyed. Theoretically anyone could talk to anyone else. But we still don't. Is it gonna be any different when we get to 6th form? Am I ever going to get to Glastonbury?

 Neh. Elitest groups scare me. I figure if I use big words no one will properly understand me :) Even though it's supposed to be the other way around... Anyhooo... Exams! Stress! No fun :( Hehe I wrote that in my English exam though! My brother must have influenced me too much because under the 'ideal school' question I wrote a load of socialist crap! Which is good I guess... in a very small way. Hmm, I wonder if the guy who marks it will notice? Oh well. Yngwie Malmsteen is such a weird guy... is it a band? Oops. Hehe... Just checked - he's a guy and he has a 'Ask Yngwie' section on his website. Awww that's just asking for trouble. urlLink http://www.yngwie.org/ Download - I am A Viking - damn weird.

 Hello, I am at home and am bored, there is nowt ont telly and nowt to do :(. O well I shall talk some random rubbish to this little baby instead! Hee hee..... I have gone properly potty. Today I went to school and participated in two exams. English was interesting to say the least and I feel that geography was a breeze. O for all people who do not know the first history exam is MEDICINE THROUGH TIME. Just to make it clear I put it in capital letters. There is a guy opposite my house who has a mohawk that goes all the way down infront of his eyes, how annoying!!! Strange also. I think to curb my boredness I shall go to bed or something, I probably wont get alot of sleep tomorrow night because Anna and Jess are staying over. It should be a laugh, only 17 days until we fly to Paris. I'm so excited!!!! AGGGHHHHHHHH. Right controlling ones self. I am going to go and make a sandwich and eat it! Toodle trundel xx

 HAPPY B'DAY 2 U! HAPPY B'DAY 2 U! HAPPY B'DAY 2 KES! HAPPY B'DAY 2 U! Wow u made it to 4 years old, you r now one of the priviledged that get to go 'nanenanenana, i'm 4 and ur not!' I have come to a gr8 conclusion that my sis is a SPILT BRAT! Oooo! we have english and geog tomorrow. english will be okay and geog i will soooo def ace! I think i did good in my textiles exam today aswell! YAY! xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

 Maths isn't good! 60% for an A - sounds easy huh? NO! It's soooo hard! Eugh... oh well, we'll all flukily survive some way or other (it always happens like that) Damn, just got it for another two years after that. :| I'm crazy! Aww, good luck Laura... and generally everyone who is doing GCSE maths cause we all need help! Oh, did you know that some year 10's are going to be doing it with us, a year early? How stressful must that be, fitting the whole GCSE course into a year! We're gonna be soooo gutted if they get better marks than us!

 Kes, i'm sure u wil b glad2 no that i hv no permanent damage frm dave throwing da tenis bals at me! My burn hurts tho, my sis almost dobed me in about how i got it! i think my mum mite no bt as lng as my dad dosnt find out i'll be fine. he'd go completely ape if he new i was burning random stuff in my room, and he'd go up the wall and round the bend if he new i dropped in on the carpet, never mind my foot! well, robyn is deffo going to bloody australia. i no its not fair on the australians but i hope a nuclear bomb hits them cos then she wont go!!!! well thats another evil plan forming! muhahaha! o well maths tomorrow! YAY! An exam that i mite actualy possibly get a decent grade on! xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

 Sausage...? Don't worry, the cats have probably eaten it! So long as it wasn't soaked in Reef or something like that... Oh we found the Reef box! Very clever :P Uhh where's the santa's hat? I'm glad everyone had fun! But come on, the sadistic pass the parcel got everyone in a stupid mood. Wasn't it cool! *slightly obsessed with sadistic pass the parcel* Hehe we got Laura to gallop down the street with a plastic sword making the clip clop sound! Wow, how er... different? And dig my unarrangedness! I like parties more when they're go with the flow and not at set times we have to do set things *also it's a lot less hassal and I can be lazy* :D Ahh so long as everyone enjoys themselves who cares :P *that's my ethos* And don't worry... if anyone wasn't having fun I would've really made them dance on nails! But I did wear the sumo suit! *runs away leaving a big crater* (phew) Yup, in my head I make sense.

 Hello tiny little people who undoubtably look upto me!!! Heehee.... Well I have to say your party was a laugh Katie. Have you found the santas hat that we put on the statue thing?? It looked bloomin good when we put it there. You may also find a sausage hiding in a bush, that was all Jess's fault, her idea not mine, lay the whole blame on her!!! You may also find a reef box, that was on her head to at some point, it luked bloomin gd too!! Ummm had best be off, cant remember a thing about biology or geography, uh oh!!! xx

 Oh yeah my 50th birthday party (as if) Weeel I was planning on just having everyone over.... maybe throwing water balloons at them while they're stading on pins - nothing special. Nah I don't know but maybe going on the Jackass website will give me some inspiration! Hmm what about the fun party game of 'who can jump the active volcano'? or 'lets find out if dogs really do bite' (that's a bad mental reference to a saying i can't quite remember but figured i'd throw in anyway) No really what are we going to do? Any good party films? Er... I don't think 'Drinking Milk is Evil and Soya Rules The World' got that good reviews. (you know who you are :P) I'll go rent a crap one that involves vegetables and plywood... *in a non dodgey way* - just incase you were thinking of suing me.

 cant wait til ur party kes! dunno wot to wear tho! wot are we gonna be doing cos if we are, like, muckin around then i wont wear the short skirt that i was probably gonna wear, i will wear trousers instead.

 three words- 'what the hell?' doesnt matter. i am going to london tomoz nite. we were going sunday morning but we decided that we wudnt get much time there if we went then so i have to rush home from work and get changed and then we are going! means i get to spend more time with my grandparents. i'll also get to see my auntie and possibly charlene-my cousin.

 Hey kiddies. I'm gonna be on holiday for the next two weeks, so while I'm away carpe diem and all that. In fact carpe diem all the time :P

 What's better? The vacuum that is silence or arrogant noise?

 Lol awww how harsh, just get rid of your siblings! It is kinda annoying though when they're at home and you selflishly want the whole house to yourself. Like on a 'me' day, you need them sometimes. Mmm I smell nice :P Or maybe it's the polish that's on all those cloths beside me... hmm. Stalked by polish again? *sigh* Oh Laura you should find out when people go on holiday or someone should generally know... it would make arranging things a whole lot easier! But on the day of our exam results we definatly should all go out and do something, you know the usual, trash someones house, go into Bristol etc.

 i cant believe i am having this party. my parents are gonna freak&nbsp;if they find out that about 20 people are coming instead of 10. (thats if everyone invited comes!) and i have just done the single most stupid thing in the entire world. i have invited robyn to stay that weekend so she can meet everyone and we can see eachother. i am actually kinda hoping that she says she cant come that weekend because i dont no where she's gonna sleep if she does come down cos we dont even have a spare mattress any more i dont think. may be i can get rid of my bro and sis for a couple of nites. that'd be a bit better.

 u'll never believe this kt. after talking about the fact that my brother didnt get punished for always stealing my stuff and that he'll never learn his lesson, guess what he went and done. stole my tape player again. and then when i shouted at him and then at my dad for not doing anything about it, i got bollocked. he isnt even getting punished this time, he has been told, like every other time, that if he does it again he will be in serious trouble and he will get punished. life is sooo unfair. had a great time today tho, cant believe how lame i am at bowling. i didnt win a single game, i jst kept coming second!&nbsp;

 Its a good idea kt, but i'd only be able to go on the sunday, cos i work on saturdays and we'd have to leave pretty early in the morning to get our money's worth. and then there is the cost of travel. does ne one really have parents who are willing to get us all down there?

 urlLink Beautifuldays Festival 2004 Hmm... anyone wanna go? Okay so it's about 30 for one day... but the Levellers! Who wouldn't kill to see them live? *i did :)* urlLink Levellleeeers! And if you don't know who they are then be ashamed, they're sooo cool! (Yeah I'm sure the kiddy tone of voice helped to convince you) Nah go download some, it's illegal to not have at least ten Levellers songs on a PC. *will hunt down your IP addy and check :P*

 sorry but i mite not come bowling after all. reason; three letter word begining with 'd' and ending with 'n' with an 'a' in the middle. i cant be in the same space as him, cos he goes out of his way to wind me up and make me feel miserable. sorry &nbsp;

 Umm I haven't invited Lynne, Jess and peeps but I'm hoping to (sometime or other) I was kinda hoping everyone would phone everyone else though. But I guess I'll just have to phone people *so much for being lazy* Anyway I better go sleep in my purple spotty room. Actual blog sometime in the distant future.

 i had to read that last post like 3 times before i understood half of it! bowling; samantha and emma definately cant cum; emily can only cum if she can meet us there cos she aint allowed to use the buses (dont ask); apparantly sunita is coming and she has invited kimmi; i dunno about anna and claire, but if they can cum i wud have thought they wud have txted u cos thats wot i told them to do. is there anyone else u would like me to tell/ get hold of?&nbsp;

 Woooow it's like a whole new how to blog thingie! *just let me play with it for a bit* Woooow! Huh... Kinda kiddy. Is the small small even readable? I kinda like it like this. Uhh where'd the photo thing come from? Oh yeah... meaningful post meaningful post. Not one full of butterflies and strawberry flavoured apples? Oh. &nbsp;Shame. What about my 'long term relationship'? Nope, that would be too sweet and I would babble for aggeeees. Okay, point: Do you think people know who you are better than you know? Like when you're mean or something and it's completely unexpected to you but the pschoanalyist in the corner knows why you just released your angry rage on that person at that time? And habits, but I guess they're accepted by your brain as normal and not to be analysed. But how do they become habits in the first place? And psychiatrists... they seem to know some people better than they know themselves. Or is that just through learning and knowledge? Ok pointless babble over. Now to find a picture of my room colour.

 the bus webby is impossible. it doesnt give a proper service, it is crap and it doesnt even tell u what specific fare charge u'll have to pay. i am sooo confused. i am jsut gonna give in &amp; not go cos it is not worth the hassle. tis a shame cos i didnt go last year but i went the year before and won a space hopper as it bounced off everyone else!

 Well then we are screwed! cos i cant get bus times cos i am at work tomorrow.&nbsp; i cant get hold of people cos i have no cred and have hardly anyones home numbers and i'm not allowed to call mobiles from our home phone! damn it. it looks like it mite end up as me and samantha and knowing her she'll bring along her bastard of a boyfriend so i'll be little miss third wheel (again). *contemplates what to do................... mind is blank* &nbsp;

 Uhh... Sorry about Wednesday! I was err... doing something... And soooory but I'm not going on Sunday! Laura B knows all the bus times anyway or Megan has a bus timetable ooor I'm sure there's one floating around the net somewhere. I'm going to see relatives. And might not go on Saturday cause I'm going to meet my brother in Wales, there's an Amnesty thing going on there *yeeeah that explains it* Oh sorry about shitty meaning nothing post. When my room's painted and all my stuff's back in the dark corners it used to be in and when my head comes back down I guess I'll say something meaningful. *comment BBE: a few years*

 for some reason the dash board is saying that there was a post written yesterday when there clearly wasnt! Kt where were u last nite. we had soo much fun at anna's body shop party, or at least i did! U no the whole phone tree idea for when organising things? I tried to make one up but its really difficult to do it cos i dont have evryone's number and there are certain people who only talk to certain others and getting it to go in a circle is very difficult. Cos i dont want people calling someone elses house unless they are really familiar with the household they are calling! Do u wanna have a go? also ne news on bus times for sunday?

 if by recycling it, u mean taking off the internet connection and shoving it in my room then yes we are recycling it. it will be used for all our games and crap like that!

 Hehe yup, I'm going to the body shop party. How can anyone not go? It is a bit stupid though... there have been about five body shop parties, one after another. Aaargh how much make-up is out there to buy? I'm broke but nevermind, I guess I can buy a toothbrush or something. I think I'm gonna stick with this old crappy computer - too much electrical waste, you better recycle your old one! Maybe if I save money by not buying a new pc my parents will buy me a piano to take to university... Hmm. *or maybe not*

 Our new computer is the coolest in the world! Its soo much faster than our old one. It is easier to type and it doesnt crash after jsut an hour on the net. it has a flat screen moniter and it has some really cool games on it like spider solitaire! and Pinball *remembers playing pinball instead of doing physics work LOL!*. are u going to anna's body shop party? how much money are you taking cos i have 15 in my purse but i'm not sure whether to get some more to take, cos i really dont think there is actually anything that i need this time!

 Haha, the inside of my head. Pretty opaque.

 Where did that come from????

 What if all your thoughts and ideas mean nothing? What if they aren't original consepts; useless musings that someone has documented and has already been labelled. Is there any point to them?

 I am COMPLETELY knackered! I dunno y cos i havent done much but i am. Its not fair, i really wanted to go to emilys sleepover but i cant cos i am working and i wanted to go to all of the party in the afternoon but i cant cos i am working. i wont be thre til about 4:30, so i will have missed an hour and i will be starving because so that i can be there by 4:30 i am working thru my lunch hour, so as soon as i get there all the food will disappear! (nothing unusual there, then) Biology thismorning was soo cool. We got to cut up a liver, and kimmi was completely grossed out by it all so i waved a bit in her face, and then she saw the half filled pot that the liver pieces came out of and freaked! I am deffo doing Bio, Geog, Psych and DT next year. Its gonna be hard work and alot of money but it should be fun! (250 for the geog trip and at least 200 for the bio trip!) gotta go, cant wait to see shrek 2 tomorrow, but have no idea what to wear!

 Hmm... oops looks like I'm too late for Psychology! Ahh well. Geez no pressure or anything, "Just have your choices in by Friday" There's no just about that, that's finite. Oh well I guess we all have to go with what our brains tell us, let's just hope they haven't been totally fried by revision! Anyhooo life so far - I kinda broke my wardrobe; the door, the draws, the pole thingy that you hang clothes on. Ooops. So that means I have to go Ikea shopping! Yeay! It's such a freaky place though! Never mind... I can buy a really cool strange lamp or something. Oh, and I broke my toe and it's all red/purple down the side :( Nowchie! Eww and then at night I have a banana strapped to it and in the morning my foot is washed with tea tree oil. Niiiice. Oh that's not cause my toe's broken, it's for veruccas. So life is weird. Like always. Kinda nice and refreshing, maybe the future is worth the wait.

 YAY! I only have to be in school til thursday! I am doing Geography tomorrow and poss media studies, then wednesday i am doing Psycho (!), and then thursday i am doing design tech and then biology! It's really funny, cos we have two ants nest in our rundown conservatory, and some of them are flying ants, and there is a little whole that is just big enough for the sparrows to fit thru, so they are coming into the conservaotry to get the insects and then they dont realise that there is actually glass there and they fly into it, altho the last bird was smart enough to realise it was glass, and no exit with out got thwack into it! its still quite amusing and the birds are so little and soo cute! lol! I am going to have to go on a huge shopping spree and get some more clothes for next. I have plenty of tops but i need more trousers (at the mo i have 3 pairs that are constantly on rotation) and i need to get some more jackets and jumpers cos i have three nice ones and one of them is a huge bright blue fleece (i'm sure u no the one i am talking about). This will please my dad becos he is always haveing a go at me about spending my money! Its strabge i dont write o here THAT often bt whenever i do, i start with nothing to write and then end up writing quite alot, most of it being complete crap!

 Hey guys, I had fun in Paris hope ur all really jealous and go into ceasure because of it, heehee only messing!! See you all tomorrow...................school.........

 *insert clever stuff here* Last post - deleted comments. Life - wasted time. Sleep - too little of it.

 It's a free world. Do not start an anonymous internet war. You coward. We can be who we want to be. Variation leads to evolution. IT'S A FREE WORLD. BUT DON'T ABUSE IT.

 hey, erm, i actually feel like i am talking to myself writing all these posts and wot not but never mind. i will probably see you tomorrow so u probably will be reading this thinking 'she has already told me that' but basically, on the 28th i have decided people can come round at anytime they want (with in reason) but be warned i wont be awake and moving til ten and i will have to have a shower and get dressed! (unless you want me walking around in my pyjama's and scruffy hair all day) u no i wouldn't let u in if i wasn't ready for u anyway. i dont think any of you have seen me without make and thats the way i wanna keep it! lol!

 hey. thort u'd probably be on here when u get back from ur hols. i can come on monday! and times for the 28th are 7 til when ever u wanna leave but i'm not sure about sleepover yet. it will be very limited numbers if i do have a sleepover. i havent summoned the courage to ask my parents yet!

 okay, revised gest list is as follows you anna samantha claire emily emma izzy laura jenny jess dave matt alex and obviously me. there is room for one or two extras if ppl really beg me, but i can't have evryones boyf over cos i told samantha she wasnt to invite dan bcos he really gets on my nerves, and a load of other peoples aswell (e.g. matt and dave) d'ya think that is okay? i invited robyn but we looked at travel prices and it would be quite expensive for her to come down so she aint coming. pls dont arrange nething for next thurs if ur around becos i am working that day!

 london was good. charlene wasnt at my nan alice's but ben and debbie were at my nan and granddads which made it soo much fun. too much to tell you here. it would take ages to write it all down! Am in a bit of trouble. my mum asked me what is happening for the 28th and how many people are coming, and as i cant actually lie to my mum, i had to tell her the truth and say that possibly more than 20 peop,e were coming (if evryone can come that is) and she is not happy. i have been told i have to let a few people down. will give you the revised guest list as soon as i have done but dont worry u will still be on it!
