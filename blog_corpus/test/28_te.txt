 P3 Public-Private Partnerships. There's urlLink this story from the Star this morning: The coalition claims Great Britain's experience with privately funded hospitals is proof the extra borrowing costs for the private sector and the profit motive will suck billions of dollars out of medicare. "Privatization comes out of the cost of your operational budget, and that means a cut and slash to programs, a cut and a slash to beds and it certainly means a slash and a cut to jobs," said Nancy Pridham, a Toronto mental-health worker. Is an organization, that is committed to quality, efficient and effective health care, in a conflict of interest if it is required to turn a profit in order to operate? Will decisions that affect "patient care" (things like quality of food, patients per nurse, number of beds, etc) sway towards "the cheaper" over "the better" in a private system? I guess we'll find out.

 Roast a Mayor I don't mean to dwell on things past, but I got an email today from "the Friends of David Miller" at the Miller for Mayor office. Who knew, they were still in business... Anyway apparently, on my birthday, David Miller will be roasted by such celebrity guests as David Crombie, Anne Johnston and John Tory. Subj: Roast Miller - Wednesday, January 28, 2004 Celebrity Roaster: John Tory with David Crombie, Anne Johnson, Jane Pepino and Friends The Concert Hall, 3rd Floor, Royal York Hotel, Toronto, Ontario (Front and York streets) Wednesday, January 28, 2004 Cash Bar and Hors d'oeuvres: 6 pm, Dinner: 7 pm Dress: Business Reservations: $500 per guest or groups of 5 for $2500. urlLink Order Online Now If reserving or making a donation by mail, please send your reservation information and cheque to David Miller for Mayor, c/o Janine Anderton, 260 Adelaide Street East, Suite 180, Toronto, ON, M5A 1N1. For further information or to order by phone or fax, please contact Janine Anderton Tel: 416-350-3574 or by email: janderton@look.ca Reminder: The maximum donation to a mayoral candidate is $2500 from an individual, business corporation or trade union. If you have not donated to David Miller before, you may reserve up to 5 places. Otherwise, you can only reserve a number of places that will not exceed a total donation of $2500. For full information on the donation policy and the City Rebate policy go to: urlLink http://www.toronto.ca/vote2003/pdf/rebate_bulletin.pdf Authorized by the CFO for the David Miller for Mayor Campaign At $500 a person it's a little out of my reach, but I have to say it sounds like it would be an entertaining event. Anyone who caught debates, especially those that were pared down to just three candidates (Miller, Tory and Hall), knows that Miller and Tory trade barbs on stage like two brothers. Each usually had a comeback for what the other dished out, and the best part is that it was all done with an amazing degree of humour, despite the circumstances. Watching Tory roast Miller would be a perfect event to listen to these two professional debaters go at it. When I grow up and have a lot of money, I'll go to political fundraisers. But for now, I'll just have to wait for the DVD to come out...

 Two things to tell you about First and foremost, 5 simple words: Law and Order Colouring Book. Via urlLink Something Awful , you can urlLink find it here . My only concern is that feisty Assistant District Attorney Claire Kincaid wasn't featured. [Editor's note: Try to think up a saucy "Hard to stay inside the lines" joke to go here.] Secondly...

Both shows are at 7:00 and both are followed by that other Bill Murray classic... urlLink Caddyshack , at 9:10. If, like some of my colleagues, you've never been west of Bathurst, take the subway to Dundas West station and walk south. Or better yet, take the 505, or 506 to Roncesvalles and walk south. Or, take the 504 right past the theatre. Dr. Egon Spengler: There's something very important I forgot to tell you. Dr. Peter Venkman: What? Spengler: Don't cross the streams. Venkman: Why? Spengler: It would be bad. Venkman: I'm fuzzy on the whole good/bad thing. What do you mean "bad"? Spengler: Try to imagine all life as you know it stopping instantaneously and every molecule in your body exploding at the speed of light. Dr. Raymond Stantz: Total protonic reversal. Venkman: That's bad. Okay. Alright, important safety tip, thanks Egon. Heh. I love that movie.

 The Red Box Sue Ann Levy's column caught my eye this morning. Forgive me, but I'm going to put the whole megillah here, because the Sun doesn't archive it's content... Bordering on trouble City's trash trucks face U.S. tie-ups By SUE-ANN LEVY -- Toronto Sun With the New Year's bloom barely off the rose, one hates to engage in more security hysteria. Heaven knows we've heard plenty over the past few days about the heightened "orange" terror alert in the U.S. and cancelled international air flights. But let's not forget that - for better or for worse - up to 140 trucks take Toronto's garbage down Hwy. 401 each day to Michigan's Carleton Farms landfill site, located about one-half hour south of Detroit. Those trucks - which carry about 22,000 tonnes of waste each week during the winter months - cross at the busy Michigan border points of Windsor and Sarnia. With reports of border patrols being beefed up in the past month, what does that mean for Toronto's trash? Angelos Bacopoulos, the city's general manager of solid waste management, told me yesterday "no doubt" there's a concern about the trash trucks making it across the border in a timely fashion. He says the only reason they're not yet feeling the impact is that traditionally the amount of waste is down from January to mid-March compared to the busy spring and fall - which translates to 120-130 fewer truckloads per week. "We certainly do have concerns," he said, noting last year with far less scrutiny they "struggled" during the peak periods to get the trash over the border on time. "We understand the threats are to a great extent political posturing but we are taking them very seriously," adds new works committee chairman Jane Pitfield. There's so much concern that Bacopoulos, policy and planning director Geoff Rathbone and Pitfield are travelling to Michigan tomorrow to meet with four officials from the state's department of environmental quality and a representative of the governor's office. Update required Rathbone says they've been asked to provide an update on Toronto's long-term waste diversion efforts and how the city is managing to keep hazardous materials out of the trucked trash. The Michigan people will also be giving our officials an update on the legislative situation there. Now, I hate to sound less than fawning but prior to the election our new mayor didn't have much of a garbage platform - except to ask people to recycle more and to explore new and emerging technologies. He openly derided his closest rival John Tory for daring to suggest state-of-the-art incineration, a proven technology being used in many European cities. The city's green bin composting program will be rolled out throughout the city this year and Pitfield is determined to ramp up recycling efforts in apartment buildings. But Bacopoulos says the very earliest any kind of full-fledged emerging technology plant could be up and running is 2008 or 2009. And in the demonstration phase, a plant would at the most divert 25,000 tonnes of Toronto garbage a year. Asked about incineration, he said it's a "proven" technology and if officials "could navigate through the public approvals" it would take less time to get a plant up and running. COMRADES-IN-ARMS: You just have to read the latest CUPE 79 newsletter to understand the tight ties between new Mayor David Miller and his CUPE brothers and sisters. And what price, in my view, he will pay for that coziness. In a glowing report, president Ann Dembinski talks about how much Miller appreciates their hard work and what "great news" his win as mayor is for her local. She makes no bones about how "actively involved" CUPE 79 was in that election. "We organized phone banks to support David ... many of our members worked on election campaigns, devoting their time and energy to get David and union endorsed councillors elected," she writes. There's no question Dembinski and Co. are expecting a big return on their investment. As she continues: "We are hopeful that with a new Council and with David Miller as mayor, we will find a more receptive and cooperative mood at City Hall." Hmmm. I always felt the last, more right-of-centre council kowtowed to the powerful CUPE unions. Just how much more co-operative can this new left-leaning bunch be without breaking the bank? Will the union be just as "receptive" to the city's fiscal woes and offer up $75 million in efficiencies? Nah. You can forget that. Wow. Boy that's really something eh? All those unions and stuff.... Weren't we talking about border security measures, and a garbage crisis a few seconds ago? Ms. Levy never misses an opportunity to seethe about the City's unions, and when an opportunity doesn't present itself, it seems she just shoves it in at the end of a column. Was the topic too thin? I mean, is the fact that Canada's largest city on the verge of a major environmental crisis too boring of a topic for Ms. Levy? Did she feel the need to punch it up a little, with some juicy bits about unions? Just a little focus, that's all I'm asking for. Maybe she's got that urlLink Adult ADD I keep hearing about....

 Overnight It's a common theme, among these bloggers, to point out the silly ways that people find blogs through search engines. Type "gay garbageman" into an AOL search engine, and urlLink there I am . urlLink Je T'Aime Moi Non Plus (1975) Dir. Serge Gainsbourg Joe's favorite film of his own work, this is a cult classic waiting to be discovered. A rich, tightly directed, sexy and very wild little film, it tells the story of a gay garbageman (Joe) in the American Southwest who falls in love with a girl (the incredible Jane Birkin) because she looks like a boy from behind. They spend the film trying to consummate their relationship. Filled with poetic touches using color, space, framing, dialogue and action, it's easy to see why Joe loves the film so much, though it will initially be disconcerting for fans to hear him dubbed into French (with English subtitles). Available for purchase on video through specialty video vendors and in France on DVD from Wild Side Video.

No "hotballs69" or "lick_me_nastygirl". Hell, there's an Ondaatje title amongst them. I'm sure the mild names will act towards mitigating the situation....

 The colour of things to come I got my new metropass in the mail yesterday. It was in the same unmarked, envelope it comes in every month.

A dark, chocolate, brown.

 Bringing down corporate America Polaroid did some urlLink PR work a few days ago advising their customers that if they "shake it like a Polaroid picture", as advised by Outkast, their snaps will turn urlLink out blurry . urlLink Look at all the news organizations that picked up Polaroid's response to the Outkast song. Basically, Polaroid had to spend time, and possibly money, to react to some lyrics in a popular song. There was no ill-intent (presumably) on Outkast's part, it's just that Andre 3000 probably wasn't all that interested in researching Polaroid's position on instant photo developing procedures. Polaroid had to move to ward off any possible customer complaints of poor quality photos. "Shake it like a Polaroid picture" is just such an amazingly effective hook that it has become entrenched in Polaroid's brand almost instantly. So there it is, all you culture jammers out there. If you're really intent on "bringing down" the corporate giants, just work the improper use of their products into a catchy song hook, and they'll have to spend their time and energy reacting. Some possibilities include: "My big booty baby always supersizes at McD's....I'm lovin' it" from I Like Big Butts (remix by Justin Timberlake) Wait a mintue.... I was going to try to think up other examples here....but now I'm just stuck on that one. I really, really want Justin Timberlake to remix "I Like Big Butts". Who do I have to talk to to make that happen?

 Two birds bought for $30,000 Who says the French are arrogant? The Americans that's who. The Americans are never arrogant themselves of course, they just like to think the French are... There's the story of urlLink this guy who flipped off Brazil, twice, and was fined almost $30,000 for it. See...it seems that the US brought in photographing and fingerprinting rules and technology called US VISIT around Christmas of 2003. Foreign nationals from a long list of countries that the Americans have deemed hostile, are now required to submit to even greater public scrutiny in the name of national security...or homeland defence...or whatever they're calling it these days. Countries who thought they had a good relationship with the US, like Brazil for instance, found themselves on the "list" and had their nationals stopped and documented at the border. Brazil got so pissed off that they responded by requiring all Americans to be fingerprinted and photographed upon entering Brazil. No one seems to doubt that this is more of a "show them what it's like" action, then an actual "national security" action. After being "shown what it was like" for so many foreign nationals to enter the US, this guy flipped Brazillian authorities off.

 And on a completely unrelated note... While searching for how to spell "stocky" I googled..."stocky" and among other things urlLink I found this . Turn the volume way up.

 Not funny. Shitty. Man, there's a whole lot of shitty behaviour going on in the world today. Little urlLink girls being killed . Precursors to urlLink pandemic flu . And urlLink subways exploding .

And those urlLink damned Australians are going to finally make the CN tower officially useless. I've got no point. As usual.

 It takes something like this.... Ok. Dogs poisoned, intentionally or not, in Withrow Park in the Danforth and Logan area. Have you heard the discussion going on about this? It's barely about "we need to find out who's doing this" and mostly dog owners and non-dog owners going at each other. The blue box keeps the urlLink flame alive here . Forgive me, but I don't want to loose these: All dogs should be on leashes. All. They are the responsibility of the owner, and the owner should always be only a few feet away. That is for the safety of others and the animal itself. Unfortunately, in our society, it is often the dog that's walking the human. Anthony Grieco, Los Angeles, Feb. 5 If people don't like to be around dogs then they shouldn't be in, or choose to reside near, a designated leash-free zone. Wendy Tideman, Toronto, Feb. 5 Off-leash areas are great but they should always be fenced in. High Park on a Saturday seems to be a huge off-leash area. Jason Mote, Toronto, Feb. 5 Leashless areas are no problem as long as the dogs are not attacking people and the owners pick up after them. Lino Cafazzo, Hamilton, Feb. 5 Dogs are animals. They are not completely within a human's control. Dogs off-leash are at best a nuisance and at worst a danger to small people, children or not. Marion Macdougall, Toronto, Feb. 5 It's obvious that kids and dogs shouldn't mix at parks. Both dog owners and parents pay taxes, and therefore have the right to use those public spaces. So why don't we just fence these off-leash areas and make everyone happy? Rob Drynan, Toronto, Feb. 5 I believe that there should be designated off-leash areas for dogs in the city since there are no other legal areas for a dog to walk around and get exercise. Nicole Hanhams, Stayner, Feb. 5 We have a very nice, and very big, off-leash dog park here in Austin. It's fenced, patrolled by the Parks Dept. and is locked at 10 p.m. No one is allowed in without a dog. In other words the park is just for them. Why not have a park exclusively for dogs and let the adults and kiddies have fun in another park? Christine Giles, Austin TX, Feb. 5 City parks that are habitually used by dog owners and dogs are less susceptible to gangs, drugs and violence. Dogs in effect make the parks safer for everyone. Garnet Marziliano, Toronto, Feb. 5 Off-leash parks are great, but it is imperative that they be fenced for the safety of others and for the dogs. Some people are terrified of dogs and we should all be able to share the parks. In Brampton we have no issues because are parks are fenced and located away from homes. Jerry Castle, Brampton, Feb. 5 Leash-free zones are valuable assets for both dog owners and their dog. They promote physical and mental benefits and as long as the owner is responsible and knows their dog's behaviour well, there is no reason for alarm. Melissa Whetstone, Toronto, Feb. 5 The majority of dog owners are not responsible. While I complete disagree with harming an animal, I can understand the frustration. In my neighbourhood, dogs run without leashes, dig up gardens and bark all night. Lori Nyles, Toronto, Feb. 5 The city has smoke police but has never cared to act on the by-law requiring dog owners to pick up after their dogs. My former home in the area of the Humane Society was constantly subjected to dog feces on the bricked front yard. The parkette at King and Sackville is a disgrace, and the streets of the city are unwalkable. Why are the taxpayers funding dog bathrooms? Robert Berg, Winnipeg, Feb. 5 It is only fair that parks include off-leash areas in parks as owners of mans best friend are taxpayers too. We and our beloved dogs have a right to exercise and socialize just as much as a parent with their child. Michelle Coutu, Toronto, Feb. 5 Off-leash parks are great, but it is imperative that they be fenced for the safety of others and the dogs. In Brampton we have no issues because are parks are fenced and located away from homes. Jerry Castle, Brampton, Feb. 5 There is a lot of work that goes into a leash-free park. The local government must agree to location and size of the completely fenced-in area. If non-dog owners wish not to have a leash-free park in their local park then they can speak out at the meetings. Rhonda Smith, Georgetown, Feb. 5 I have been taking my two dogs to the leash-free park in Hamilton, Oakville, Burlington and Belleville. These parks differed in some respects but they all had three things in common: They were fenced in, they were away from residential areas and the dogs had a great time. Why is this even a question? Frank Olah, Eldorado, Feb. 5 I could never understand why a city dweller needs a very large dog. Surely not for protection. Hal Watt, Toronto, Feb. 4 In my area of North York there isnt any (off-leash area) and it is a shame. I would even pay a user fee for the privilege of a safe environment to socialize and exercise my animals. Liz Johnson, Toronto, Feb. 4 Dogs, on or off leashes, do not belong in public parks or on city streets. William Bedford, Toronto, Feb. 4 Dogs, especially large breeds, have no place running freely in an unfenced area near playing children. Many children are afraid of dogs, many dog owners are ignorant or uncaring of boundaries, and many dogs are poorly trained. Michele Craig, Barrie, Feb. 4 In using Withrow Park for almost 15 years, Ive learned that many dog walkers release their dog at the border of the park, rather than waiting to get to the off-leash area proper. This mightnt be so bad, were it not for the equally numerous lot who appear to have little command of their pets once released. Ross Turnbull, Toronto, Feb. 4 I strongly disagree that dogs should be allowed off-leash in open areas. It is completely irresponsible and dangerous. I am speaking as a dog owner in the Bayview area where off-leash dogs are becoming an endless battle. Just because your dog may be 'friendly' doesnt mean ours will be if it is approached. William Sawada, Toronto, Feb. 4 Im sick and tired of the holier-than-thou attitude of Riverdale dog owners. Two of my kids have been bitten by out-of-control dogs in Withrow Park over the years. I dont condone this crazy poisoning but I do believe big dogs dont belong in a city. Ritchie Leslie, Toronto, Feb. 4 You want a leash-free zone? Then put a fence around it! Parks are first for children, not dogs. Jim Anderson, Toronto, Feb. 4 Having an area where responsible owners can let their dogs socialize with others is important to the emotional health of both owner and canine. Byron Patchett, Toronto, Feb. 4 I understand the frustration that many people feel when dealing with the small number of anti-social and irresponsible dog owners who take great pleasure at ignoring all rules and normal codes of conduct but to deliberately seek to harm these animals is a serious crime against us all. Phillip Wallace, Toronto, Feb. 4 There will always be dogs in parks, so we should have times that the park is considered off leash, with each park setting different times, depending on the location. John DeBoer, Toronto, Feb. 4 There need to be more (leash-free zones), and they need to be fenced in. In Philadelphia, a neighbourhood dog owners association held fundraisers and got corporate sponsorships to finance the building of a fenced-in area in their local park. Jill Skorochod, Toronto, Feb. 4 Our four-legged companions need playtime as much as peoples children do as well as socialization. Leslie Ogilvy, Toronto, Feb. 4 For years, I lived near Withrow Park and was treated to the nightly sounds of wild dogs barking, growling and snarling as they tore around the park with their irresponsible owners huddled together, 50 or 100 yards away. Andrew Morgan, Toronto, Feb. 4 I live by a dog park. Most residents do not want it due to continuous barking 24 hours a day. The city has to enforce better laws to protect all people that use parks. Kim Halfyard, Toronto, Feb. 4 Is our planet so small that we cant afford an area for dogs to run and get exercise under their owners supervision? Norm Ullock, Ajax, Feb. 4 I have seen dogs repeatedly chase tobogganing kids If your toddler was repeatedly frightened out of her wits, and even put in danger by a nonchalant dog owner refusing to stop the dangerous situation of his own making, how would you feel? Geoffrey Lumby, Toronto, Feb. 4 There are a lot of parks in the Greater Toronto Area and if people do not like to be where dogs are loose, there are a lot of parks where they must be leashed. Lynn Hutcheon, Brampton, Feb. 4 We take our 3-year-old lab to leash-free parks in our area After this we are not taking him there any more. Its scary. Lisa Sheppit, Burlington, Feb. 4 Dog owners should be responsible and pick up after them, and not allow unruly or bad-tempered dogs to run free (the majority of the people are responsible). There are enough other parks for those people who do not like dogs running free to go to. Sharon Smith, Bradford, Feb. 4 Off-leash areas in parks are fine, but the city should rigidly enforce the fines for having a dog off the leash outside the designated area. In High Park, there is a major problem of dogs roaming all through the park off the leash, inconveniencing other users of the park and totally uncontrolled by their owners. Ash Baker, Toronto, Feb. 4 I attend a leash-free zone within a large park in the Danforth area with my dog. I have seen two problems: Dog owners socializing without having a clue when their dogs are eliminating or running off towards other people, and not having the skill to call their dog back and mothers and children determined to walk through the legally leash-free zone without teaching their children how to deal with dogs, such as not pulling their tails and not running away. Liza Bryant, Toronto, Feb. 4 In the local parks in my area, not one single dog has ever littered. But I see baseball teams, soccer teams, teenagers out at night, all littering. And theyre the ones complaining about the few people who dont pick up after their dog. David Cook, Toronto, Feb. 4 Wow. That last one was funnier then I first though. It always comes back to litter or garbage. I've totally seen entire soccer teams NOT playing soccer and just throwing garbage all over the place. And teenagers. But no dogs... Probably has something to do with the opposable thumbs.

 A Case for Keifer I got off the streetcar today at Broadview and Danforth. About a subway stop and a half west of a black and red helicopter that was hovering over a spot on the earth.

 Keep this one in your back pocket Might as well put the text of it urlLink up here : Scalia Was Cheney Hunt Trip Guest; Ethics Concern Grows Thu Feb 5, 7:55 AM ET By David G. Savage and Richard A. Serrano Times Staff Writers PATTERSON, La. ? Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia traveled as an official guest of Vice President Dick Cheney on a small government jet that served as Air Force Two when the pair came here last month to hunt ducks. The revelation cast further doubts about whether Scalia can be an impartial judge in Cheney's upcoming case before the Supreme Court, legal ethics experts said. The hunting trip took place just weeks after the high court agreed to take up Cheney's bid to keep secret the details of his energy policy task force. According to those who met them at the small airstrip here, the justice and the vice president flew from Washington on Jan. 5 and were accompanied by a second, backup Air Force jet that carried staff and security aides to the vice president. Two military Black Hawk helicopters were brought in and hovered nearby as Cheney and Scalia were whisked away in a heavily guarded motorcade to a secluded, private hunting camp owned by an oil industry businessman. The Times previously reported that the two men hunted ducks together while the case was pending, but it wasn't clear then that they had traveled together or that Scalia had accompanied Cheney on Air Force Two. Several experts in legal ethics questioned whether Scalia should decide the case. "In my view, this further ratchets it up. If the vice president is the source of generosity, it means Scalia is accepting a gift of some value from a litigant in a case before him," said New York University law professor Stephen Gillers. "It is not just a trip with a litigant. It's a trip at the expense of the litigant. This is an easy case for stepping aside." Aides to Cheney say the vice president, like the president, is entitled to travel to vacation spots on government jets and to take along guests at no cost. "The vice president is on duty 24 hours, seven days a week," said Kevin Kellems, a spokesman for Cheney. "His security is important, and a certain number of people must accompany him." Judges are bound by different rules, however. Federal law says that "any justice or judge shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might be questioned." When asked about the trip last month, Scalia confirmed that he had gone duck hunting with Cheney, but said he did not see a need to withdraw from the case. "I do not think my impartiality could reasonably be questioned," he said in a written response to The Times. He said "social contacts" between justices and high-level government officials have not been seen as improper, even when those officials have cases in the courts that concern "their official capacity, as opposed to their personal capacity." "I expect that all of the Justices were invited to the Vice President's annual Christmas Party. The invitation was not improper, nor was the attendance," Scalia wrote. This week, the justice was asked whether he had traveled to south Louisiana as Cheney's guest or paid for the trip. He refused to comment. Two years ago, the Sierra Club (news - web sites) and Judicial Watch sued Cheney, seeking to learn whether the vice president and his staff had met behind closed doors with lobbyists and corporate officials from the oil, gas, coal and electric power industries. A judge ordered Cheney to turn over documents detailing who met with his energy task force. Cheney appealed, and in September, Bush administration lawyers asked the Supreme Court to hear the case and reverse the judge's order. It "would violate fundamental principles of separation of powers" to force the president or the vice president to disclose who they met with, said U.S. Solicitor Gen. Theodore B. Olson. After considering the appeal behind closed doors on three occasions, the Supreme Court on Dec. 15 announced that the case of "in re Richard B. Cheney" would be heard in the spring. It takes the votes of at least four justices to grant review of a case, but the court does not disclose which justices vote in favor of such appeals. The hunting trip took place three weeks later. Northwestern University law professor Steven Lubet said a vacation trip with the vice president is not the same as attending a Christmas party. "This is certainly a level of hospitality that most litigants are not able to extend to Supreme Court justices," he said. "It also reinforces the perception this was an exceptional event, not a run-of-the-mill social event or a White House dinner." The Washington legal director for the Sierra Club said his group is considering filing a motion to ask Scalia to withdraw from the case. "On the face of it, that makes things worse," said the Sierra Club's David Bookbinder, referring to the justice's trip aboard an Air Force jet. "The fact that the vice president is his host and, in effect, is paying for his vacation puts it in an even more awkward light for Justice Scalia." The decision is likely to rest with Scalia himself. In a response to a recent inquiry from two Senate Democrats prompted by the hunting trip, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said the high court does not have a formal policy or rules for reviewing decisions by justices on whether to withdraw from a case. Gillers said he found Rehnquist's response troubling as well. "This has exposed a gap in the ethics rules. This is a federal law that applies to the justices, but in this instance, Scalia is the judge of his own case. I would think the full court has an interest in its institutional reputation and would want to review a decision like this." In south Louisiana ? the state bills itself as the "Sportsman's Paradise" ? the Cheney-Scalia trip drew the attention of local officials because of the unusual security precautions. Scalia had hunted ducks in the state's southern marshes several times before, and in November, Secret Service agents visited the area to plan for a visit by the vice president. Ken Perry, who runs the Perry Flying Center at the Harry P. Williams Airport, said Secret Service agents were there in November to study security plans for the upcoming trip. They returned for a second trip around the Christmas holidays when the nation's terror level was raised to orange, or high, he said. He and St. Mary Parish Sheriff David Naquin said that on the morning of Jan. 5, a large security contingent was in place ? two Black Hawk air combat rescue helicopters, a line of armored sport utility vehicles and a ring of federal agents and sheriff's deputies who set up a security perimeter. The area was declared a no-fly zone for other aircraft. It was raining when the two blue-and-white jets, with the U.S. flag on their tails and the fuselages clearly marked "United States of America," appeared under the clouds. Perry said the planes radioed that "Air Force Two was on its approach." Perry said Cheney was among the first to deplane, followed by Scalia and a young woman who was identified to Perry as one of the justice's daughters. Both Perry and Naquin said there were orders prohibiting photographs of those who exited the planes and climbed into the motorcade. But two days later, Cheney returned to the airport without Scalia, and photographs were allowed. Perry and Naquin said the vice president happily posed with them for photos at the Patterson airport. Scalia stayed on to hunt for a few more days, the sheriff said, but local officials said it was unclear how he returned to Washington. Perry said the planes were piloted by Air Force crews, and he added that the Air Force paid $2,000 for fuel to return to Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland. Lt. Col. David Branham, a spokesman at the base, said the 10- and 12-seat planes are assigned to the 89th Airlift Wing there and are typically used for trips to rural airports too small to handle larger aircraft. "That's part of the package for moving the president and the vice president," he said. The hunting camp is on private land and in a secluded section of a bayou. According to several local hunters, it includes a large floating camp where guests stay overnight. During the day, hunters armed with shotguns go out in small boats to duck blinds to position themselves for shooting. Scalia and the sheriff said the hunting was not good in early January, probably because of inclement weather. "It was terrible," Naquin said. "There were very few ducks killed." The camp is owned by Wallace Carline, the head of Diamond Services Corp., an oil services firm that is on 41 acres of waterfront property in Amelia, La. The company provides oil dredging, pile driving, salvage work, fabrication, pipe-rolling capability and general oilfield construction. Carline, who founded the company 42 years ago, also contributes money to local Republicans running for office in Louisiana. He refused to comment on the visit by Cheney and Scalia. Carline's secretary said he was in Mexico and had nothing to say about the hunting trip. "He enjoyed the visit," she said. "But it's over with now. It's old news. He's not going to talk to you." -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Serrano reported from Patterson, La., and Savage reported from Washington.

 Well this is new... I saw my first " urlLink See you in Athens " ad tonight. It shows an American flag reflecting off of a young woman's face. She looks something beyond sad. I missed the tag line completely but I think it was something to the effect of "She didn't let her country down by loosing the gold medal. She didn't even get to go to the games". The camera pans back and we see she is standing at a storefront window with several TVs on display. She's watching an Olympic medal ceremony, featuring an American athlete at the top of the podium. Our woman is wearing a red "Canada" jogging suit, as she quickly runs away from the storefront and camera. The onscreen text says 70% of our Athletes live below the poverty line. So...who's doing PR for them? That's a big message, that carries a lot of weight. If our athletes don't get the money, America wins. The message is so familiar (we hear it during and after every olympics), but someone had the brilliant idea to rub our noses in it before the Olympics. Or at least, long enough before the Olympics for us to actually do something about it. Like give money. You're either with us, or you're with the Americans. Don't let the Americans win... I wonder if it will work.

 Men who aren't men My girlfriend and I were killing time in a bar the other night. We chose an establishment close to our eventual destination, which was in the heart of the downtown core, and as it was after work on a weekday, the bar was filled with Bay St. suits. I've got nothing against suits. Suits are the reason that I get to have pretty things to wear and an iPod to listen to. However, I find that suits are generally phony. They've got big salesmen smiles, and hearty handshakes that imply a lot, but don't mean anything. They drink imported beer when they're with co-workers or a mark, and light beer when they're at home. Whatever company they worked for, whatever job they were on, it required them to wear identical blue-gray suits, and carry identical black leather briefcases. Maybe they were twin brothers. Maybe they had a special mentor-protege relationship. Maybe the blue-grey was the new "power colour" and anything that they said would be discounted as schizophrenic ramblings unless they were clad in that particular shade. A waiter approached: Waiter: Hi, what can I get you fellas today? Suit one: Yeah, I'll have a Stella. Suit two: Yeah, I'll have a Stella. Waiter: Ok, so that's two Stellas; Any food tonight? Suit one: Yeah, I kind of feel like something to eat... Suit two: Yeah, me too. How about something to eat? Suit one: Uh.....how about we get an order of 10 wings and fries to split? Waiter: Ok, and how would you like the wings? Suit one: What do you have.....Medium? Hot? Waiter: We have hot. Suit one: How hot is hot? Waiter: Not that hot. Suit one: Ok, we'll have those. And some fries. Suit two: Yeah, that sounds good. Fade to black.

 Glasses I'm always on the lookout for a new pair, and a new style. If you listen carefully in movie theatres in Toronto, I'm the one you can hear whispering to my girlfriend "What about a pair of glasses like that? They look pretty good, don't they?"

 This ain't good You know...as a casual observer, who's not invested in either side, I have to say that killing urlLink this guy seems like a really stupid idea. I know it's hard for those of us who haven't subscribed to a formal religion in quite some time, but someone who can be described as the "spiritual leader" of a group of people, carries an enormous amount of emotional support from those people. The kind of emotional support that will convince people to kill themselves for his cause. urlLink Here's what the UK said . Here's what urlLink we said . Here's what the urlLink US said . Here's the part that I don't get: The reaction from the US President. I can't find any mention that he was aware of the action at all. I mean, it's been a full news day, it had already happened when I woke up at 7:00 this morning, so he has to have been briefed on it, or something. I find some stories that say that the " urlLink Bush Administration " is " urlLink deeply troubled " by the killing.... but no "President George W. Bush said 'something'" about the Yassin killing. Surely the man who was installed on earth by God himself to rid the world of evil has something to say about what happened. Maybe he'd say "Yassin's death means greater security in the region. He will no longer lead the Palestinian people blindly to their suicide deaths. The Israeli people struck back at terrorism today, and won another battle in the war against evil." Or maybe he'd say: Terrorism reared it's ugly head again today in the Middle East. The Israeli government needlessly killed a spiritual leader to thousands of civilian Palestinians. As of today I am requesting that Congress back my upcoming bill to sanction Israel and cut off all business ties with them. I know it's an election year George, but come on....you've got to back your horse, you know what I'm saying? You can't pledge yourself to a war on evil, and then not say anything when evil happens in the world. In fact urlLink you just got finished saying "We will never bow to the violence of a few. We will face this mortal danger, and we will overcome it together." And further.... The war on terror is not a figure of speech. It is an inescapable calling of our generation. The terrorists are offended not merely by our policies -- they are offended by our existence as free nations. No concession will appease their hatred. No accommodation will satisfy their endless demands. Their ultimate ambitions are to control the peoples of the Middle East, and to blackmail the rest of the world with weapons of mass terror. There can be no separate peace with the terrorist enemy. Any sign of weakness or retreat simply validates terrorist violence, and invites more violence for all nations. The only certain way to protect our people is by early, united, and decisive action. Just give is a blink to let us know you're not too hungover... Just hold all those who meet the definition to the same standard.

 Burma This is a urlLink pretty funny story. Bush campaign gear made in Burma His campaign store sells a pullover from nation whose products he has banned from being sold in the U.S. BY LAUREN WEBER STAFF WRITER March 18, 2004, 9:49 PM EST The official merchandise Web site for President George W. Bush's re-election campaign has sold clothing made in Burma, whose goods were banned by Bush from the U.S. last year to punish its military dictatorship. The merchandise sold on www.georgewbushstore.com includes a $49.95 fleece pullover, embroidered with the Bush-Cheney '04 logo and bearing a label stating it was made in Burma, now Myanmar. The jacket was sent to Newsday as part of an order that included a shirt made in Mexico and a hat not bearing a country-of-origin label. The Bush merchandise is handled by Spalding Group, a 20-year-old supplier of campaign products and services in Louisville, Ky., that says it worked for the last five Republican presidential nominees. Ted Jackson, Spalding's president, said, "We have found only one other in our inventory that was made in Burma. The others were made in the U.S.A." He said the company had about 60 of the fleece pullovers in its warehouse, and that a supplier included the Burma product by mistake. Bush campaign officials did not return calls seeking comment. The imports are potentially an issue because outsourcing has become a hot political topic in the election. Bush last July signed into law the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act, saying "The United States will not waver from its commitment to the cause of democracy and human rights in Burma." Violators of the import ban are subject to fines and jail, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. Burmese textile workers earn as little as 7 cents per hour, according to the National Labor Committee, a human rights group. "If it is true, it is very contradictory because the sanctions were imposed by the Bush administration," said Bo Hla-Tint, a spokesman for the Burmese government-in-exile in Washington, D.C. Spalding, which works exclusively with Republican candidates at both local and national levels, tries to order American-made products, Jackson said. "Our first effort is always to source things from the U.S., but not a lot of garments are made in the U.S. Friday," he said. He said all embroidery is done in the United States. The Bush-Cheney fleece pullovers were imported to the United States by Denver-based Colorado Trading & Clothing. President Jeff Schmitt said Thursday the pullovers were included in one of the last shipments brought in from Burma last year before Sept. 1, when the import ban went into effect. "It's a terrible irony" that the Burmese jacket landed at Newsday, he said. Schmitt said Colorado Trading employs an agent in Asia who conducts checks of factory conditions. Human rights watcher Charles Kernaghan, director of the National Labor Committee, said the slip-up showed a lack of conviction on the administration's part. "Given the debate about outsourcing, it's amazing that the campaign would be selling stuff made in the most brutal country on earth, known for things like child labor and sexual slavery," he said. "It shows a crude indifference to this issue." The National Basketball Association recently vowed to stop selling Burmese-made sweatshirts after a campaign by the NLC. Last week, Newsday ordered a hat, T-shirt and fleece pullover or jacket from both the Bush and Kerry campaign stores. The Bush merchandise - which totaled $81.85 - arrived this week. The Kerry products, worth $62, have yet to arrive because the fleece jacket was on back order, according to Financial Innovations, the company that licenses and sells Kerry merchandise on the Web site www.kerrygear.com. The campaigns receive no profits from the merchandise because of federal election regulations. The Kerry merchandise was made in the United States, according to Mark Weiner, the president of Financial Innovations. The company, whose employees belong to the Communications Workers of America Union, sources most of its merchandise from union factories. "It's becoming more difficult to find American-made union product, especially in textiles, but you just have to look. We pay more money for them, so we make a smaller profit margin," said Paul McConnell, Financial Innovations' vice president. Copyright 2004, Newsday, Inc.

We take great pride in providing this service to your campaign, and at your request have worked with our vendors to distribute goods that have been made in America. Unfortunately, in one of our recent shipments, a vendor inadvertently supplied us with foreign goods, and our own company did not discover this mistake before distribution to the public. The purchase orders for these items included a statement specifying "Made in USA products." (See attached document). We received an acknowledgement from our supplier substantiating that it was their factory mistake. (See attached document). We have already reviewed our entire stock of items and have pulled from inventory all foreign products. Of the 60 fleece jackets in stock, only two were from Burma. According to best estimates by our supplier, less than a total of ten items from Burma were shipped to the public. We have taken corrective action to assure this will never happen again. We are a small company employing 40 workers and take pride in the professional services provided by our hard-working American families. Please accept my sincere apologies for this error and let me assure you that all necessary steps have been taken to guarantee that all future shipments will contain only American made products. Sincerely, Ted Jackson President, Spalding Group

 The colour of things to come I got my new metropass in the mail yesterday. It was in the same unmarked, envelope it comes in every month.

Most research projects and environmental education programs are funded for a limited period of time, and their resources are targeted towards complimenting the projects, rather than conducting the longitudinal testing. Often new initiatives and intervention strategies are explored by investigators rather than the development of monitoring processes to assess the effectiveness of recent or ongoing initiatives. And so we're caught in a loop. Do we want to put the time (years and years of behaviour analysis and research) to decide on a litter management strategy that works or do we want to deal with the problem immediately as it arises? If we choose to be academic about the subject, then we're stuck with dirty streets and no plan for a few years. If we throw more money at it, then it gets picked up but no behaviour ever changes. Happy medium time. The review of the litter-ature concludes with this: Littering is a complex activity, influenced by interactions between personal perceptions, attitudes, values and behaviours, as well as environmental factors such as prompts, the presence of bins, the amount of litter already present at the site, and the presence and actions of other people. In order to achieve a comprehensive understanding of littering behaviour these elements must be studied from a holistic view. For those interested in what the Ausies are doing about litter, you can urlLink check it out here . As a side note, one should keep in mind who's doing and funding this research. Is it State, National or Municipal governments? urlLink No . I'm not implying that the research is biased or tainted at all. I am implying that your City, Province or Federal government will use research like this (should it exist in Canada), but won't fund it in a million years. Perhaps some group, urlLink somewhere , would do the right thing and pony up the dough.

 Beg pardon? From a review of the litter-ature: In one Australian study (Leigh, 1995) 52% of the subjects thought that throwing an apple core under bushes was acceptable behaviour and not really littering. Cigarette butts, used matchsticks, icy pole sticks and organic material such as some food scraps were also considered not to be litter by many subjects (Leigh, 1995) It took me a few minutes but "icy pole" means "popsicle" right? Right? Maybe "Mommy can I have a pole to suck on for dessert" doesn't carry the same implications in Australia. The good people at wordreference.com define " urlLink icy pole " as the Australian name for an ice lolly. Which, of course, clears everything up.

 A form letter in bag format I sent away for some information from the Australian Beverage Industry Environment Council. They've done some very comprehensive studies on litter behaviour and attitudes. I finally received the literature in the mail today. The package was hermetically sealed inside a giant, thick-gauge plastic bag, that took me 5 minutes and a pair of scissors to remove. The envelope inside had been torn and taped back together, and on the bag itself was printed this note: We apologize Dear Customer, The enclosed item of mail was either received in this condition or damaged during its processing. We sincerely regret this unfortunate incident and any inconvenience caused. We are always concerned when mail entrusted to our care is damaged, and we have made considerable improvements to reduce such incidents in our operations. Please be assured that we are continuing to make every effort to improve our service. Warning: Please keep this bag away from young children. So there you have it. Mail was damaged.

 Local business The Music Hall has been closed since the 3rd week of February. I just did a search to see if anyone else has noticed and urlLink one other person has : Danforth Music Hall Now Closed? posted by jlangdon on March 11, 2004 at 10:15am TORONTO, CANADA - Yet another historic cinema in Toronto is closed. The Danforth Music Hall, which started life as Allen's Danforth Theatre in 1920, has been closed since the third week of February. Since 1998 the Music Hall has been a member of the Festival Cinemas chain, showing second run films mostly with the occasional concert or play thrown into the schedule. It is the last operational theatre built in the Allen's chain. All its sister theatres have been either demolished or converted into other uses. No details are being provided as to the reason for the closing. The message on the Festival Cinemas' Hotline (416-690-2600) states simply that the theater is closed. Given the recent collapse of the Uptown and ceiling falling at the Bloor cinema, Toronto cinema fans have reason to be worried about this old movie house. The Music Hall is my "next door" theatre, and I'd hate to see it closed permamently. I'd hate it even more if the roof caved in while I was watching a movie, mind you.

 A Canadian Ethical Dilemma It's that time of year. The debate remains strong. Two men take turns buying the coffees for each other, every day during their break at work. It's a long-standing Canadian tradition of "I got it. You get it the next time". Each spring the devil creeps into the mix, when Tim Hortons starts urlLink putting prizes under their cup rims . The question is this: "If I buy the coffees this time, and one of us wins a prize, who gets to keep it?" I mean....if it's a donut, or a coffee or something, then good-on-you for winning. But what if it's cash, or a bike, or a plasma TV.....or one of 30 GMC Canyons? If I bought the coffees and you win the truck, then we sell the truck and split the money right? No? What if I bought the coffees and my rim has $1000 under it. Good luck for me, and you'll buy them tomorrow right? Not fair? What if you bought the coffees and after setting them on the work bench we got mixed up as to who's was who's? What if one of us won? There's lots of stuff about odds of winning, skill testing questions and prize distribution urlLink in here , but nothing to answer our question. Every day, all over this country, men and women are stepping up to Tim Hortons counters with slips of paper in their hands containing the individual cream and sugar combinations for entire offices. Usually, getting the coffee is a sign of camaraderie and solidarity with your fellow worker: I'll get it today, and I trust you to get it tomorrow. But Every Spring, Tim Hortons mixes a double-double of greed and desire into their brew, and it's tearing our country apart. I'm not suggesting that we cancel the contest, but I think we need to start a national discourse, to try and resolve this issue.

 In the bar the other night. I can't bond over sports. I never have. I can't shoot-the-shit over scores and standings, or rule changes and officiating. But it's such an integral part of masculinity, that I have to fake it sometimes. It's a rare moment when I CAN make a relevant comment about a play, or a game. So I was in the bar downstairs the other night, enjoying a pint of Creemore Springs. A middle-aged man sat beside me; receding hairline, sports-team jacket, jeans, and a newly-divorced air about him. He swigged his beer, and then watched the Leafs game on the TV. The puck is behind the Leaf goal and Antropov moves it out from behind, and then in front of Belfour where he gets knocked to the ice by an eager Boston winger. Puck stolen, shot and mercifully blocked, in one swift move. The guy beside me snorted and shook his head. I did the same, and we spoke for the first time: Me: Boy...what was the first thing they teach you in Junior? Don't bring the puck up the middle in your own zone.... Him: Junior? How about Pee-wee, Atom, Novice. That's the first thing you learn, and they're still blowing it at the professional level. We chatted like that for a bit and then fell back to watching the screen flickering in the haze. Eventually a commercial for Tim Hortons roll up the rim came on. I asked aloud: "Is roll up the rim back?" My barmate told me that "Yeah...it's been on since Monday". He then launched into a brief but familiar tirade known to Canadians around this time of year: They're really cheapin' out over at Tim Hortons. I hardly win ANYTHING anymore. 5 or 6 years ago I'd buy all kinds of coffee and win 2 or 3 times a week. Now? Nothin'! I hardly won anything last year, and I had 4 coffees yesterday and today, and nothing yet. They keep saying there's millions of prizes but nobody ever wins them anymore. I've heard a lot of disaffected Canadian caffeine addicts harp on this same note: "Roll-Up-The-Rim is a scam nowadays. I used to win a lot, but I don't win as much anymore." I lost my head at that point. I should have nodded, or agreed, or provided details about my own frustration at those donut-makin' bastards, but I didn't. Instead, I thought for a moment about what my barmate had said and then offered this: Yeah....But Tim Hortons has really expanded in the past few years. I mean, it's not just the small towns anymore, there's thousands of new franchises popping up every year in suburbs and office buildings all over the country. Maybe, with all those new locations, it's just that there's MORE cups out there and more people competing for the same amount of prizes. He stared at me for a brief second and then faced forward towards the bar mirrors. He mumbled: "Yeah...could be....could be...." sipped his beer, and looked back at the TV. He didn't speak to me for the rest of his beer, and then eventually paid his tab and left. I had either blown his mind, or crossed a line that you do not cross while watching hockey in a bar. I have a feeling it was the latter. The Leafs urlLink won 3-2 .

 Brampton is dirty too... There's been a lot of talk about litter lately. A whole lot of talk... So much talk, in fact, that urlLink the following letter from a Brampton resident caught my eye: Brampton needs more cleaning I recently read that Toronto city councillors have approved a $3 million plan to clean up the city. Also, many residents are suggesting everyone pitch in to pick up garbage that is strewn all over our streets and parks. We, in Brampton, need to do likewise! Our streets, parks, shopping areas and storefronts are a total disgrace. I remember way back when Brampton was beautiful, clean and, indeed, deserving of its former name of Flowertown. In my opinion, we need to start at the grassroots level, by educating our children in the schools that littering is wrong. There are certain basic moral principles that are obviously not being instilled in our kids and are missing from society in general. It is beyond my comprehension how people can throw their trash on the ground without a care for their community, expecting someone else to pick up after them. Littering is an obvious epidemic in our city. This is a symptom of a more insidious problem: a complete lack of regard for others and a lack of respect for society in general. This is manifested also by the great increase in violence. This should all start in the home, but if parents are not doing their job, the school-system is compelled to do it for them. We must teach our kids right from wrong. Mandatory community cleanup as part of a high-school education should be instituted, as so should fines for littering (which many other cities have), and they should be strictly enforced. Adults need to lead by example, and not throw pop cans, cigarette butts, etc. out the car window, or while walking. Ditto for 'poop-and-scoop'. More garbage bins need to be placed around streets, parks, and stores and emptied regularly. Ad campaigns can be run on community-cable channels, buses, in our schools and our newspaper. This problem can be changed for the better, but it will take a little effort from all the residents of this once beautiful city. Annamarie Bohus, Brampton Wait a minute.... go back there for a second please? We, in Brampton, need to do likewise! Our streets, parks, shopping areas and storefronts are a total disgrace. I remember way back when Brampton was beautiful, clean and, indeed, deserving of its former name of Flowertown. Flowertown? I think I speak for all Toronto residents when I say "I just completely lost respect for Brampton".

 Canadian porn star? A Canadian porn star is missing in urlLink Pennsylvania (link via urlLink Bourque ). She made the trip down to Conshohocken in a '92 Saturn for a photoshoot. The ADA is on the case, and has her priorities straight: "We certainly hope that the exotic film industry or anything connected to that is not going to be centred here in the region," Ferman added. "That is not our primary concern in this investigation. Our investigation is centred on finding this woman." People getting naked for money in Conshohocken? They better not be! It just makes me sick to think about the depravity that is goin.... Pardon? Oh. Yeah, we'll see what we can do about finding this missing girl. That's all well and good for how the AP newswire carried the story. But what about the local coverage? The Philadelphia Daily News couples her story with another missing person under the banner urlLink 'Sexy Canadian' disappears; search still on for elderly man . The story includes her measurements, and a website where you can view nude photos of Natal King (who performs under the name Taylor Sumers): Graphic nude photos of Sumers are featured on two Web sites, and one of them, urlLink onemodelplace.com , gives her measurements as 36D- 26-35. On onemodelplace.com, King, posing in a firefighter's hat and boots, describes herself as an actress, dancer and adult performer. "My name is Taylor and I am looking to hit it big within the adult industry," the resume reads. While Philadelphia ADA Ferman is hoping that no porn stars will grace her jurisdiction, I have a feeling that the Philadelphia Daily News researchers welcomed the assignment of "finding background material" on the missing woman. Oh and make sure you get her cup size right. We want to keep the public informed.

 And they can't roll the shooter out of the back for 12... It's 11:45 at night and I'm watching 8th draw action at the Nokia Brier, live from Saskatchewan Place in Saskatoon. Saskatoon, is in Saskatchewan I believe. It's the 3rd end and the hometown crew is down by 2 to those lobster eatin' bastards from the Maritimes. "The reason he wanted it clean is because he wanted to block the come-around from Nova Scotia." Indeed. But it's not just for the close-shaven stones, or the men getting around the guards and coming in the rear, it's for the love of urlLink the game .

 Tooker no more The first, and possibly only, time I saw urlLink Tooker Gomberg was in front of City Hall almost exactly a year ago. Rumour has it that an email was sent to some senior management at City Hall inviting them out to a Smoke and Skate party in Nathan Phillips Square, to protest Marijuana laws in Canada. Tooker Gomberg himself was hosting. I could see out my window as a small crowd (like 7 people) gathered and started making a snowman. I wandered past the party site after the festivities had broken up and the only remnants were a fat white kid with a blond afro filming a lopsided snowman which sported a giant newspaper spliff. It was an argument simultaneously for and against decriminalization.

 "The melting snow was coughing up junk" That headline came from a urlLink Brett Lamb dog-walk-photo-essay two weeks ago. It's the clearest description I've ever read to explain the springtime litter phenomenon. For those of you who didn't take the red pill on Tuesday morning, you missed urlLink Ms. Levy's column detailing her walk from Yorkville to City Hall. Ever get deja vu? It seems that every spring, columnists like Levy make their money pointing out the obvious, but generally assessing blame to the wrong source. Levy claims that bungling at city hall, wasted public education campaigns, and the city's unions are to blame for the increased litter and junk on the streets around this time of year. I've got another reason that you can see more litter on the streets. It has a lot more to do with what happens between December and March every year in this city, and less to do with politics, spending and the Left and Right wings. Snow. When it snows the city can't pick up litter. If you take a bag and a broom and walk around the sidewalks in the wintertime, you'll sweep up more snow then garbage. If you drive one of those cool litter vacuums around the sidewalks in the middle of January, you'll suck up more slush and snow then cigarette packages. Some of you might recall how difficult it was to park on city streets with 4 foot high snowbanks on one side and streetcar traffic on the other.... Could you drive a street sweeper into that fray as well? I doubt it. The reason there's "more junk on the streets" in the spring, is because the accumulated litter and garbage that's been throw, blown, or seemingly magically appeared on our streets, is released from it's icy prison and free to offend people like Levy. Give it a rest. It's not a surprise every year, it's not a result of over-spending, and it's not Miller's fault.

 The 905 and 519 weigh in on how filthy Toronto is I happened upon some letters to the editors at the Toronto Sun this morning.... The text in brackets after each letter is, as always, the response of the editorial staff to the individual letter. I've taken the liberty of linking to the self-stated hometown URLs, to give everyone a better idea of where these carpetbagger-letters are coming from. You people in Toronto should be ashamed for making Nancy from Beeton feel upset. I'm sure she drove her SUV home and complained to the other 4 people in Beeton about how dirty and scary a place Toronto has become. LETTERS -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- KUDOS TO the Sun for blasting City Hall for the disgusting mess Toronto has become. Now, how about addressing another revolting habit that seems to be back in vogue and which was against the law years ago: Spitting. On the sidewalk, into garbage pails, even opening car doors and horking into the street. It's repulsive and likely very unhealthy. I can't believe how low Toronto has sunk. Nancy Paul urlLink Beeton (For a sure cure to this problem, see next letter) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- MY WIFE and I just returned from Hong Kong where there's a $1,000 fine for littering and a $2,500 fine for spitting on the sidewalk. The city is spectacularly clean ... no wonder. When we arrived there someone told us to be careful about dropping anything: "They take littering very seriously here." Perhaps a couple of Hong Kong-style fines levied against messy Torontonians would make the point and clean things up quickly. It sure isn't the same Toronto in which I lived in the '40s, '50s and '60s. In those days, people were proud of their city. Jim Lawrence urlLink Wooler (Now they escape to New York. Read on ... ) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I JUST returned from a two-day trip to New York City. What a nice, clean place to be. We were staying near Times Square and our city council has a long way to go to even come close to getting Toronto to compete. NYC is clean. Why? Because it has workers who clean up the sidewalks, roads and garbage bins on an ongoing basis. NYC is safe. Why? Because it has police patrolling the streets in numbers - a deterrent for any criminal. In two days of walking midtown and downtown Manhattan, I was not approached by one panhandler. If council doesn't get its act together, our city won't even be a blip on anyone's vacation radar. Me? I'm going back to NYC. Joseph Marn Toronto (How times have changed) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- CLEANING UP Toronto should not be a problem. First of all, you could start handing out fines for littering and put the money from the fines into a fund to hire people to clean up after those who don't get caught and to pay for a special litter police to catch the rest. This might be a little too logical for your leaders to understand without years of million-dollar studies. Clean up this pigpen and the tourist dollars may flow back to what once was a beautifull place to visit. Dennis MacMillan urlLink Mississauga (You should try living here) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- IF CITY staff cannot keep parks groomed, streets clean, or pick up dead animals, contract these jobs to the private sector. Private contractors either work within a budget and do a good job or they do not get the contract next year. Eliminate city departments that cannot provide service and contract to private contractors. Louie Goodwin urlLink Elmira (Won't happen with this mayor and council) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I JUST have to get my two cents in. Why hasn't anyone else seen what I have been seeing for the past several years in Toronto, namely the now infamous Dundas and Spadina area? The big, dead rats, the small spaces between buildings crammed with trash, the industrial-size garbage bins with a smell that literally makes me gag. I grew up in Toronto and it makes me so sad to see it in decay. If it isn't a law that you have to keep your own property clean, maybe it should be. For goodness sake, clean up your own spaces. Gina Straine urlLink Mississauga (Some people won't, unless they're forced to) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I WOULD like to question the criteria used to determine the filthiest street corners (March 2). I agree with some of the selections and also agree that something has to be done with the attitude not only of those living/sleeping in downtown Toronto, but also of those that work downtown. Has anyone tried walking up Bay Street, from Adelaide to Queen in the mornings? The stench is so unbearable most pedestrians cover their faces - and this is in the cold winter mornings! Imagine what it's going to be like when the sun warms things up. Barb Worthington Toronto (Pee-uuw! We hate to think) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- SO MAYOR David Miller wants every Torontonian to spend 20 minutes on April 23 picking up litter. Shouldn't this be the job of unionized city maintenance workers paid out of ever increasing property taxes? Silly taxpayers, expecting essential services to be funded out of their taxes rather than having their money wasted on every special interest group and professional grant-getter that appears before council. Chris Dedyna urlLink Kitchener (Sue-Ann Levy couldn't have said it better)

 Witness Relocation They called. They called and left a message this weekend. Hi, this is Elder Witt calling from the urlLink Church of Jesus Christ of Later-day Saints . I'm kind of new in the area and I'm trying to get to know some of the members in the area and people around here. So we want to know if we can come and see you sometime this week or whatnot. If you can give us a call that, would be fantastic. Our number here is (xxx) xxx-xxxx and we look forward to talking with you. The funny thing is how bored he sounded on the phone. Apparently, telemarketing for Jesus isn't a sparkling endeavor. I didn't even get one of those seductively naive, peppy Christian girls calling me and asking to come over to my apartment. No, I got a bored Mormon guy. Some of you might recall my last brush with urlLink a pseudo-christian proselytizer . At least I was sober this time.

 Wow, this guy really hates Rogers Do you hate Rogers Cable? urlLink This guy sure does. The site indicates that it's written (or written with the help of) an urlLink ex-Rogers employee who details how Rogers alegedly gouges and cheats it's customers. Personally I don't have an opinion, except that I tend to get frustrated dealing with any large company.

 Friday Night Feels good to be blogging again.... So in the midst of it all, there was urlLink this racket at the foot of Bay on Friday morning. I had heard about it on the radio, and just in scanning the day's headlines. Apparently the protesters were pissed off about Mills' "reversal" on a promise to turn an abandoned building in to shelter for the city's homeless. My confusion over why Mills' press conference was being protested was probably shared by anyone who's actually heard Mills speak about anything. If he isn't dancing around the question outright, he's snapping at the reporter who asked the question, as he did famously during SARS-stock when questioned about the cost for the day's event. I gave my girlfriend a call at home to let her know that I was leaving work late (on a Friday night I might add...) and she said "There's all kinds of reporters and protesters at Dennis Mills' office across the street". I told her about the press conference and then headed home to see the fuss. It's certainly not the first time that Mills' Danforth office (across the street from my place) has been picketed. A few months ago I was enjoying a lovely Sunday afternoon nap on my couch when I was slowly awakened by a nagging sound....singing.... "This is the day.....That the Lord has made.....We will rejoice.....And be glad in it....." An anti-gay-marriage protest was cutting into my Sunday slumber. As a side note, that rude awakening was one of the chief reasons I now support legislation to recognize same-sex marriage. Don't piss me off during nap time. By the time I got home the protesters had dispersed leaving only CTV and CBC news trucks parked at the curb. My girlfriend and I sat on the couch beside the window, and watched as Mills was interviewed live on the local news. We watched Mills, then the TV, then Mills.... If you listened closely to the broadcast you would have heard: "SPEAK UP!! WE CAN'T HEAR YOU!" shouted from an open window on the Danforth. One of his messages during the two snarky interviews was: "the NDP wants wall to wall condominiums on the waterfront". Oh come on now. Layton is starting to put some campaign ads on TV, and it's going to be a hell of a run in my riding. Mills vs. Layton on the Danforth. I'll keep you posted...

 Just one more thing ma'am At that litter meeting....? The Mayor came to address the delegates. It was the closest thing I've come to celebrity in quite some time. The following day, after lunch with a colleague, we walked back to the office. On the way, we passed the Mayor with an entourage of 6 or 7 staff members. As she and I passed the group, we gaped, made eye contact and nodded slightly. We got a nod back and after he'd passed we got all giddy: Me: Psst.... heads up! Her: Wha...Oh my god. Look at the size of his entourage! Me: Did you see that? He nodded at me. Her: You!!? He nodded at me! Me: He did not. He must have remembered me from the meeting. Her: Yeah right, he was nodding at me. Come on. I've only got a little bit of time before gushing over a mayor with a friend is really embarrassing. More embarrassing then it is right now, that is...

 Just where the hell have you been? I'm going to take a step here, and write about some of the work that's kept me so busy over the last few weeks, and hence not blogging.... I've usually avoided talking about my job here, and I'm going to continue to avoid it...so pardon the generalities. There was a meeting last Wednesday. Municipalities and brand owners (like restaurant chains and product manufacturers) from all over the province were invited to the meeting to discuss litter, and to share ideas about how to address the optics of litter and the cost cleaning it up. Litter is linked to civic decline, and groups representing business and tourism industries are VERY interested in reversing the perception of civic decline in this or in any city. Municipalities presented some of their experiences with litter reduction programs. Famously, Mississauga has the "Litter Not" program in which they revived a classic (retro?) logo from the 60s and 70s... urlLink the litter bug . Mississauga put its program together, raised their littering fines, set up a urlLink snitch-page , and got a urlLink celebrity endorsement . While JYD now plays for the Bulls, it hasn't stopped Mississauga from spreading their litter message to a pile of urlLink municipalities . Last spring Toronto launched its own "Don't Trash Toronto" campaign care of the Clean Streets Working Group. If you live or work in the city you'll probably remember bus shelter and litter bin ads that noted the new $305 dollar fine for littering. Toronto set up a litter reporting hotline (39-CLEAN) and an adopt-a-bin program based on NYC's Adopt-a-Basket program where local merchants report overflowing litter bins and the city will clean them up. The City of Windsor showed off their urlLink Make it Shine program which features, among other things, litter postcards that are mailed to offenders when an address can be found... Toronto spends something in the order of $16M on litter cleaning every year, including sweepers, bag and broom crews and all of the litter bin collection. It's a chunk of money to spend and we still claim to live in a dirty city. There have been editorials, town hall meetings, and an election campaign which trumpet how dirty (filthy, disgusting, sickening, putrid, among other notable adjective) the streets have become in recent years. Honestly I can't tell if there's been a decline or not, but then I've only lived here for 3 years so maybe I just missed the Utopia this city apparently once was. Research was presented about how other countries deal with litter. A country like Japan has very few litter problems, partially due to strong enforcement of cleanliness laws (fines for gum, etc.) but mostly because residents simply pack their garbage away until they can find a place to dispose of it. There were some images of our city....garbage stuffed into a hole in a light standard, 1/2 a block away from a litter bin at Yonge and Eglinton. A picture like this highlighted two messages: People are willing to "put" their litter somewhere, and not just on the ground People aren't that willing to carry their garbage with them until they can find a litter bin So what to do? Municipalities say they put money into the problem (more routes, more equipment) but that doesn't seem to be helping. If it's agreed that there is a certain level of civic decline, and that litter is one of the symptoms of this problem, then simply sweeping up the litter faster isn't going to solve anything. Can municipalities, and perhaps the province, engage an increasingly cynical population into a discussion of "who is responsible for your society?" I don't want to make litter into something that it's not; we're still talking about garbage here, but dare we ask ourselves, and our fellow citizens to take some pride in the cities and towns that they live in? If I asked you to "pick up that piece of litter, and put it in a bin" would you tell me that it's not your job? Would you tell me that your taxes pay someone to pick it up? Would you tell me to go to hell? Or would you pick up that piece of litter, and turn around and ask me to pick one up too? Pollyanna blogs. There's lots of talk about increased enforcement of littering fines, but their effectiveness at actually causing social change is debatable. There's lots of talk about producer responsibility, and asking manufacturers to contribute to municipal litter programs the same way they contribute to municipal blue box programs. Is more money going to be the solution to the problem? If money is put into an education campaign, on the order of "The Three Rs" or "Don't Drink and Drive", then we might actually see some results. Watch the papers, there's going to be some buzz in the future.

 A night at the opera Again. It was a few weeks back and I'm just willing to articulate it now, seeing as how the urlLink COC season is officially over and my embarrassing story won't affect anyone's viewing of the opera in question: Die Walkure (the one with the Apocalypse Now helicopter song in it). While waiting in line for our cheap youth-tickets we were informed over and over that "Die Walkure is really really long. It's 3 and a half hours and with intermissions, the opera that starts at 7:00 will end at 11:30 or later". Sure, we can hack it, we can handle it, we're all cultured and shit. No. We're not. After a long work day, my girlfriend and I met up and had a beer and some dinner before the show. How are you doing? Think we can handle it? Yeah I'm pretty tired too. We got to the Hummingbird Centre early and killed time in the usual way: We looked at the walls and walls of photographs of the previous shows and stars to visit the Hummingbird/Okeefe Centre, and tried to count how many times Liberace played on stage over the years. We're up to 400 so far. That guy really liked Toronto for some reason... He was so good to his mother. The show starts, and not really being familiar with Wagner, I initially compared the long lost brother and sister twins Siegmund and Sieglind, to Luke and Leia....that is, until they had sex, fully aware of their common history. What the hell is wrong with German people? The opera is long. The music is dark and brooding, and meant to be sung at a snail's pace. It was very cool to see these all-powerful gods and supernatural beings fighting for power, and being bound to their own contracts and decisions....but it wasn't enough to keep us in our seats. Wracked with guilt, we finally slunk away at 10:00, just after the 2nd act mercifully drew to a close. There was still an intermission and a 3rd act on the slate. We chastised ourselves for not being more cultured. We made excuses and justified our 7th inning dash to beat traffic. We were tired, it was a school night, but all the same, we felt bad; that is, until we got to King station, and rode the train home with the other 10 people in our car alone who were all clutching their opera programs and wearing decidedly less guilty looks on their faces. On the whole I liked Rigoletto much better then Die Walkure, but I think that has more to do with the fact that I just like urlLink seeing clowns emotionally tortured.

 A contract All city services should be contracted out. A contractor can get the work done cheaply and efficiently, unlike city employees. If a contractor can do the work for cheaper then why wouldn't the city hire them to do it? It's just silly to pay staff to do it when there are companies out there who do this work cheaper and better. Contract. Contract. Contract. Yeah...except when the contractor doesn't make money on the deal anymore and urlLink wants to back out . Trash hauler wants contract declared void Dispute over money-losing arrangement could lead to garbage pileup this summer Toronto could be faced with piles of rotting garbage this summer if the city cannot resolve a dispute with the company that says it is taking a bath on its deal to ship the trash to Michigan. Wilson Logistics Inc., the trucking company that carries Toronto's trash to a Michigan landfill, is trying to get its haulage contract with the city cancelled. A change in U.S. trucking laws means it has been losing more than $10,000 a day on the contract since the start of the year, according to chairman and chief executive officer James Wilson. "Wilson would be very prepared to pass on the baton, if there was someone to pass it on to," he said in an interview. The news that Wilson Logistics is trying to get out of the contract hit city hall like a bombshell, only two days after council passed a budget handing home owners a 3-per-cent tax increase. Since last fall, the company has been trying to get city officials to agree to a $5 increase in the $33 a tonne shipping fee to make up for increased costs under the new rules. If everything stays on track, the company will ship about 950,000 tonnes of trash this year. With the talks at an impasse since December, Mr. Wilson said the company has been forced to refer the contract to an arbitration panel, which will have its first meeting on May 19. A ruling against the city would throw the trash-collection system into chaos, because Toronto has the capacity to hold only two days' worth of garbage. But city politicians did not know about the problem as they prepared the budget, they said yesterday. "We haven't been briefed by city staff at this point. We've only heard from the company," said Paul Burns, senior council liaison adviser for Mayor David Miller. Councillor Gloria Lindsay Luby said she does not know why councillors were unaware of the problem when working on the budget. "It would have been good to know," she said. Mr. Wilson said Washington's new rules, which apply to all truckers in the United States as well as those who enter the country as part of their daily runs, are much tougher than the old ones. The previous regulations limited work shifts to 15 hours, required drivers to have eight consecutive hours off between shifts and allowed drivers to take the time for coffee breaks, bathroom stops and meals out of their hours worked. Rules that came into effect Jan. 4, however, limit shifts to 14 consecutive hours, including breaks, and require 10 consecutive hours off between shifts. Until recently, a Wilson driver would pick up a load of garbage at a Toronto transfer station, drive the truck 475 kilometres to the Michigan landfill and bring the empty truck back to the transfer station, where the next driver took over. The routine roundtrip took 12 hours, Mr. Wilson said. But trips have been taking longer. One reason is slower loading and unloading as both the city and Republic Services, the operator of the Michigan landfill, adjusted to increased tonnage after Toronto's Keele Valley landfill closed. The company also has delays of up to three hours to get across the border in the wake of stepped-up security after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, as U.S. officials check paperwork and each load carefully. After tracking his trucks with global positioning devices, Mr. Wilson now estimates that four roundtrips out of 10 take longer than 14 hours. To ensure compliance with the new rules, it now takes two drivers to get a truck to Michigan and back. One driver, who does two runs a day, drives from Toronto to London, Ont., and turns the truck over to another driver, who does one run a day from London to Michigan and back. That has meant that Wilson Logistics has had to hire 150 more drivers and build a new terminal next to Highway 401 at London, where the drivers do their switch. The arbitration panel will have to decide whether the new U.S. rules create what the contract calls uncontrollable circumstances, and if it so finds, it must rule that the contract between the city and Wilson is null and void, Mr. Wilson said. A city official who has been dealing with the issue said yesterday the city believes it likely will win the arbitration case and that Mr. Wilson is trying to panic Toronto politicians into cutting a deal.

 "I answered every question" urlLink Every single question . No doubt about it, he answered every question that was asked. There were questions asked, and they were answered by him. Every single question. You tell me if this guy is going to get re-elected. He'll 'testify', but not under oath, not alone, not on camera, and not on any public record. Wow. Seriously? Why bother showing up? Do Americans actually trust this guy? I can't imagine it, but he seems to still be wielding power without a passing sense of accountability. He appears to have lead the US into a war, predicated on a false premise. He's put the government so deep in debt that it will take decades to get out. He's alienated the sentiments of just about every country on the globe. And now....when he finally agrees to speak about the worst mass-murder on American soil, he won't do it under oath, without Cheney, or on any public record. Why...why....why would you trust another word that comes out of his mouth? I'm really at a loss here. I just can't empathize with his position. What's the argument for NOT testifying under oath, alone, or on the public record? Is it a national security issue? Every other principle involved has had to testify under oath, alone, and in part, on the public record. How is he different? Like....what does he know that say...George Tennent doesn't know? What Rice, Powell, Clarke, Ashcroft, Reno, et al. don't know? THEY are the ones giving him the bloody information in the first place, and THEY had to testify in the usual manner. But somehow, he doesn't have to testify under oath, alone, and on the public record.

 100% Grated Parmesan Cheese From the urlLink Kraft FAQ : Q: What is Kraft Grated Parmesan made of? A: Kraft Grated Parmesan cheese starts with milk which has been heat treated and pasteurized. Cheese cultures, enzymes, and salt are added. The cheese is then allowed to age for at least 6 months to develop its full flavor. Q: How is Kraft Grated Parmesan made? A: Grated Parmesan is made by taking aged parmesan cheese and grinding or grating it into a smaller, granular form. Moisture may or may not be removed from the cheese after grating before packing by some form of drying process. Q: What is the difference between Kraft Grated Parmesan and Kraft Shredded Parmesan? A: Shredded Parmesan and Grated Parmesan begin with the same cheese. A cheese is referred to as "shredded" if the particles are in the form of cylinders, shreds or strings. A cheese is called grated when it has been ground into a more granular form. Different pieces of equipment are used to get such forms of cheese. Q: Is the milk used in Kraft Grated Parmesan pasteurized? A: All Parmesan produced by Kraft is made from pasteurized milk. The FDA does not require the milk to be pasteurized in Parmesan production, but for safety and quality reasons, Kraft has chosen to use pasteurized milk. Q: Does Kraft Grated Parmesan qualify as Kosher? A: Kraft Grated Parmesan is not Kosher. While most/all ingredients used in the production of Kraft 100% Grated Parmesan are Kosher, the cheese itself has not been classified as Kosher by a rabbinical agency. Q: I am lactose intolerant. Does Kraft Grated Parmesan contain lactose? A: Aged natural cheeses such as Parmesan have almost no lactose. Q: I am a strict vegetarian. Are there any animal remnants or enzymes in Kraft Grated Parmesan? A: Some enzymes used to develop flavor in Parmesan cheese are derived from animals. The majority of Kraft produced Parmesan contains no animal products. Kraft is making an effort to remove all animal enzymes from its Kraft Grated Parmesan. Q: How should my KRAFT 100% Grated Parmesan Cheese be stored if it hasn't been opened? A: Store unopened in a cool dry cabinet. It is completely safe when stored in the pantry. It is not necessary to refrigerate unopened product. If your KRAFT 100% Grated Parmesan Cheese was refrigerated at time of purchase, we recommend keeping it refrigerated at home, otherwise the temperature variances may affect the quality of the product. Q: How should my KRAFT 100% Grated Parmesan Cheese be stored once it has been opened? A: It is NOT necessary to refrigerate opened product, however, refrigeration will help to ensure the best flavor and quality of the product. If opened product is kept refrigerated, it can be used up to 3 months past the "Best When Purchased By" date on the package. Q: Can I freeze my KRAFT 100% Grated Parmesan Cheese? A: We do not recommend freezing this product, not because it is a health or safety hazard, but because the quality of the product will decrease if frozen. Freezing this product may negatively affect texture and flavor.

 Red and Blue go at it From the roundup of the 20 Minute Toronto Makeover in urlLink the Star : [Miller] also saluted the participation of corporate sponsors, including the Toronto Star, Home Depot, The Beer Store, Tim Hortons, Pizza Pizza and McDonald's. Uh...Actually the Toronto Sun was in there as well....The Star's spell checker probably cut it out of the story.

 When the AP reads like The Onion This is it. This is everything in one, neat little package. Right here: Beef-scarfing couple booted from buffet SALT LAKE CITY, Utah - A couple on a low-carb diet were kicked out of a buffet restaurant after the manager said they'd eaten too much roast beef. Sui Amaama, who along with his wife has been on the Atkins Diet for two weeks, was asked to leave after he went up to the buffet at the Chuck-A-Rama in suburban Taylorsville for his 12th slice of roast beef. "It's so embarrassing actually," said Isabelle Leota, Amaama's wife. "We went in to have dinner, we were under the impression Chuck-A-Rama was an all-you-can-eat establishment.'' Not so, said Jack Johanson, the restaurant chain's district manager. "We've never claimed to be an all-you-can-eat establishment," said Johanson. "Our understanding is a buffet is just a style of eating," he explained. The general manager, who was carving the meat Tuesday, became concerned about having enough beef for other patrons and asked Amaama to stop, Johanson said. The offended couple asked for a refund. The manager refused and called police when they would not leave. The couple said they had eaten at Chuck-A-Rama's $8.99 buffet at least twice a week, but did not plan to return.

 Happy day after earth day Another gem from the red box this morning: JUST A note to everyone involved in today's 20-Minute Toronto Makeover, especially where children may be participating: I found a condom outside the fire station at Regent and Dundas streets yesterday morning on my way to work. This is close to Regent Park School in Ward 28. Many of you in downtown wards are familiar with the Harm Reduction Programs we have in our neighbourhoods and know condoms, needles and crack pipes are all over the area. Please use extra care when cleaning your neighbourhoods. Gloves are vital and children participating should only do so with strict supervision. The condom I found was a pretty purple and children could mistake it for a balloon. Have fun cleaning. Linda Dixon (It's a dirty job, but ...) Pretty Purple Prophylactics. Yes. Safety first. This is a real pickle here isn't it? We want everyone to be safe. We don't want anyone picking up condoms and needles. My God, if you find one just mark where it is (put something over it so no one else will mistake it) and call the City's Solid Waste Management Hotline at 416-338-2010. Don't let children pick up litter by themselves, and use your own common sense. There's another side to this though. Being safe, and watching for dangers is just part of the human condition. But at what point will people simply not participate because the perceived risks are too high? The above letter from a Sun reader is very anecdotal. She saw a condom! The implication (and in so many words) are that the area is a minefield of pestilence covered with "condoms, needles and crack pipes" like a playground in some after-school special. The logic goes something like this: I think the City is dirty; I have an urlLink opportunity to help clean it up; Pardon? You saw a condom?; There's no way I'm going to participate because my health is much more valuable then a clean city. I'm so glad that SO urlLink many people are going urlLink to participate in this 20 minute urlLink clean up , but if "condoms" and "needles" are going to be an excuse for not participating then we just go back to square one, where everyone complains, but no one is willing to do anything. The attitudes of the residents of this city have changed so dramatically from last year to this. People are very interested in helping out, people seem less likely to simply blame city hall because they can see garbage outside. Honestly, it's a very promising attitude and I hope it stays with us. Taking responsibility for, nay, even acknowledging our own garbage is a step in the right direction. I hope everyone reading this will take a few minutes and tidy up an area they feel is unsightly. If you feel it's too much for you, then please at least call 39-CLEAN and let the city know where you see litter.

 In my head Not sure where this one came from but I've got a Futurama line stuck in my noggin': Fry: I refuse to testify on the grounds that my organs will be chopped up into a patty. Judge Whitey: Ah yes, the 67th amendment. Thank you for indulging me.

 The colour of things to come I got my new metropass in the mail yesterday. It was in the same unmarked, envelope it comes in every month. Obviously I can't possibly use it until May 1st, but like every month, I opened the envelope 2 weeks early just to see what colour the Metropass is going to be. April's went from green, to black to white at the top. May's metropass follows the same pattern, but it's a light blue at the bottom, then green, then white at the top. I wonder if June will have a new colour at the bottom, then May's blue, then white. I suppose only time (mid-May) will tell.

 Windex Brad over at From A to B tells the tale of the urlLink Snowflake Maker doing his part to keep Toronto clean. Far from simply making things soggy and blue, Windex, when properly applied, can clean curbs, vans and cynical hearts. We all wait, eager to read more about the Snowflake Maker.

 The Anglos take a stab at it "Unibroue" Our man in Quebec (Matt over at urlLink Living in a Society ) wrote to me an suggested that it's pronounced "Unibrew" and not "Unibrow" as I had previously thought. He noted that he's never actually heard a francophone pronounce the word, and that he and his anglo friends may be getting it wrong, but I've got to trust him on this one. Didn't Unibroue own part of the Jays at one time? I suppose I should really look into that myself instead of asking no one in particular.

 Tips for aspiring letter writers Did you ever want to match your opinions and wit against those of the Sun Editorial board? Here's an example of the level of sophistication required to get published in the Sun: I'M LOOKING for backers to finance a great new Canadian sitcom -- The Khadr Family. There's already a theme song we can use: "They're creepy and they're kooky, mysterious and spooky, they're all together kooky, the Khadr Family." Joe Flaherty can play Papa Khadr, who teaches his kids to "blow up real good." Sheila Copps can be Mama Khadr, who teaches her children how to manipulate and abuse the goodwill of multicultural Canadians. We could sell it to Aljazeera, the Arabic cable channel. It's a guaranteed money maker. Who wants in? Ron Laffin Toronto (Sounds like it could be a hit, so that rules out the CBC) Editorial response is in parenthesis. It took me a while to figure out some of the gags, but here's a quick guide to "getting" the jokes in Laffin's letter: "Khadr" and "Addams" have the same number of syllables, so the two words are interchangeable in the familiar Addams Family TV show theme song. Joe Flaherty was a cast member on SCTV in the 80's where he created a movie reviewing farmer with the late John Candy. The two characters liked to see things "blow up real good" in movies. The reference to Joe Flaherty as a father who would encourage his children to become suicide bombers, is based on this character. The fact that Ahmed Said Khadr the patriarch of the real Khadr family is dead, seems to have eluded Laffin', but I'm confident he'll realize his unfortunate error and correct it in a re-write. The Sheila Copps reference comes from the fact that Copps traveled to Afghanistan to orchestrate a series of bombings and ambushes against Allied forces in the war-torn country, not only because she is a terrorist, but also because she wants to waste tax money. Including her as the matriarch of Laffin's family is subtle and satirical beyond anyone's comprehension.

 Stressed There's been a lot of talk about urlLink stress lately. While out and about in the downtown core (taking "before" pictures ahead of urlLink Friday's event ), I passed by the Bell Trinity Square building. A woman stood outside an emergency exit, frantically puffing on a cigarette. She looked stressed. In her smoke-free hand she held a small blue ball, painted to look like the earth. A foam stress ball, that she was methodically squeezing over and over and over. She was staring straight ahead, eyes fixed on nothing. I've seen stress balls, and I've been given a few of them at trade shows. I've seen them sold in execu-toy stores, and I've seen them displayed proudly and ironically on desks. I've never actually seen someone use one. She must have been really stressed, because unless she kept that one in her purse or briefcase, it means that she had to go and get it from that bottom drawer of her desk where she shoves her pay stubs, dried out highlighting, power bar wrappers and promotional ephemera, to retrieve it. It wasn't something that she just picked up from the sidewalk outside the building. At some point she had to have thought: "Fuck....I really need a smoke and my stress ball". Now THAT'S stressed. I wonder if it helped.

 Beer Please please please tell me that urlLink this is pronounced "Unibrow". I vote that Sleeman change it's name to urlLink Unibrau in honour of their new francophone component.

 Festival of Meme's These have been going around for a while. Rather then post my contributions one at a time, I'll shove them all here like a closet that needs cleaning.

Post the text of the sentence in your journal along with these instructions.

Acording to urlLink meme.org , memes are more like "mind viruses": ideas or practices that spread from one person to another in a culture or society. I'm trying to think of examples and let's say something cute like "eating your Snicker's bar with a knife and fork" might fall into the category of a meme. The belief that Clinton had a number of people urlLink secretly murdered during his administration is an idea that began with "conspiracy nuts" and was then repeated over and over in, somewhat slanted, media circles. I think that could be considered a meme as well; as it spreads it looses it's shell of creation and gains credibility by virtue of the number of people who mention or talk about it. It's an idea that creeps into consciousness, and eventually the line between the factual components of the meme, and the innocent or sinister conclusion draw from those facts, is blurred. It's a very interesting concept.

 The Mayor I'm talking about Kevin Clarke here, not Miller. Those who work in and on the area in question know Kevin Clarke as "the Mayor". He's the one on the south east corner of Bay and Adelaide screaming at the top of his lungs each morning. He gives passers-by sermons on subjects ranging from "The one true path to God is through his Son Jesus Christ" to "The Government cannot show love for it's people". He was the guy who let us know that urlLink SARS was our fault. He's loud, aggressive and you can smell the corner of Bay and Adelaide from both Queen and King, depending on wind direction. But he's true to his faith. This morning I walked up the east side of Bay, to find Kevin wearing a suit jacket and his usual bedsheet. He had fashioned a 10 foot cross by lashing two pieces of 2"x2" together with some twine, and had hung himself from the cross. His bare feet were planted on an overturned green bucket, and his hands left their grip on the cross only long enough to scratch an itch, or adjust his sheet. Sometimes yelling about the true path to the Lord, and sometimes standing quiet, eyes closed, imagining the Passion of the Christ.

 Liberal-in-Exile If you're like me you've probably had trouble following the subtleties and political bob-and-weave involved in the AdScam Sponsorship Scandal, or whatever they're calling it now. Lucky for us, urlLink Mr. Kinsella and the Navigator public policy group posted urlLink a presentation he gave recently, which includes a detailed timeline of the events that have unfolded thus far.

Kinsella was a special assistant to that tall guy who puts pepper on his eggs.

 Bush on TV No cable, no TV. I watched Futurama episodes from a box set last night. I strongly doubted that the bar downstairs would heed my request to change the channel from the hockey playoffs to the Presidential press conference last night. Thank god for the White House site which urlLink transcribed the entire press conference , including this little Q and A: Q Mr. President, thank you. You mentioned 17 of the 26 NATO members providing some help on the ground in Iraq. But if you look at the numbers -- 135,000 U.S. troops, 10,000 or 12,000 British troops, then the next largest, perhaps even the second largest contingent of guns on the ground are private contractors -- literally, hired guns. Your critics, including your Democratic opponent, say that's proof to them your coalition is window dressing. How would you answer those critics? And can you assure the American people that post-sovereignty, when the handover takes place, that there will be more burden sharing by allies, in terms of security forces? THE PRESIDENT: John, my response is, I don't think people ought to demean the contributions of our friends into Iraq. People are sacrificing their lives in Iraq, from different countries. We ought to honor that, and we ought to welcome that. I'm proud of the coalition that is there. This is a -- these are people that have -- the gut leaders have made the decision to put people in harm's way for the good of the world. And we appreciate that sacrifice in America. We appreciate that commitment. I think -- one of the things you're seeing is more involvement by the United Nations, in terms of the political process. That's helpful. I'd like to get another U.N. Security Council resolution out that will help other nations to decide to participate. One of the things I've found, John, is that in calling around -- particularly during this week, I spoke to Prime Minister Berlusconi and President Kwasniewski -- there is a resolve by these leaders that is a heartening resolve. Tony Blair is the same way -- he understands, like I understand, that we cannot yield at this point in time; that we must remain steadfast and strong; that it's the intentions of the enemy to shake our will. That's what they want to do -- they want us to leave. And we're not going to leave. We're going to do the job. And a free Iraq is going to be a major blow for terrorism. It will change the world. A free Iraq in the midst of the Middle East is vital to future peace and security. Maybe I can best put it this way, why I feel so strongly about this historic moment. I was having dinner with Prime Minister Koizumi, and we were talking about North Korea, about how we can work together to deal with the threat. The North Korea leader is a threat. And here are two friends now discussing what strategy to employ to prevent him from further developing and deploying a nuclear weapon. And it dawned on me that had we blown the peace in World War II, that perhaps this conversation would not have been taking place. It also dawned on me then that when we get it right in Iraq, at some point in time an American President will be sitting down with a duly-elected Iraqi leader talking about how to bring security to what has been a troubled part of the world. The legacy that our troops are going to leave behind is a legacy of lasting importance, as far as I'm concerned. It's a legacy that really is based upon our deep belief that people want to be free and that free societies are peaceful societies. Some of the debate really center around the fact that people don't believe Iraq can be free; that if you're Muslim, or perhaps brown-skinned, you can't be self-governing and free. I strongly disagree with that. I reject that, because I believe that freedom is the deepest need of every human soul, and, if given a chance, the Iraqi people will be not only self-governing, but a stable and free society. Let's see here, hold on. Michael. You're next. Ahem. The second largest group of guns on the ground in Iraq are PRIVATE FUCKING CONTRACTORS. Not nations, not countries, not contributions from the UN security forces. Companies like Haliburton. A coalition of the well paid. That wasn't even the funniest part of the press conference: Q Thank you, Mr. President. In the last campaign, you were asked a question about the biggest mistake you'd made in your life, and you used to like to joke that it was trading Sammy Sosa. You've looked back before 9/11 for what mistakes might have been made. After 9/11, what would your biggest mistake be, would you say, and what lessons have you learned from it? THE PRESIDENT: I wish you would have given me this written question ahead of time, so I could plan for it. (Laughter.) John, I'm sure historians will look back and say, gosh, he could have done it better this way, or that way. You know, I just -- I'm sure something will pop into my head here in the midst of this press conference, with all the pressure of trying to come up with an answer, but it hadn't yet. I would have gone into Afghanistan the way we went into Afghanistan. Even knowing what I know today about the stockpiles of weapons, I still would have called upon the world to deal with Saddam Hussein. See, I happen to believe that we'll find out the truth on the weapons. That's why we've sent up the independent commission. I look forward to hearing the truth, exactly where they are. They could still be there. They could be hidden, like the 50 tons of mustard gas in a turkey farm. One of the things that Charlie Duelfer talked about was that he was surprised at the level of intimidation he found amongst people who should know about weapons, and their fear of talking about them because they don't want to be killed. There's a terror still in the soul of some of the people in Iraq; they're worried about getting killed, and, therefore, they're not going to talk. But it will all settle out, John. We'll find out the truth about the weapons at some point in time. However, the fact that he had the capacity to make them bothers me today, just like it would have bothered me then. He's a dangerous man. He's a man who actually -- not only had weapons of mass destruction -- the reason I can say that with certainty is because he used them. And I have no doubt in my mind that he would like to have inflicted harm, or paid people to inflict harm, or trained people to inflict harm on America, because he hated us. I hope I -- I don't want to sound like I've made no mistakes. I'm confident I have. I just haven't -- you just put me under the spot here, and maybe I'm not as quick on my feet as I should be in coming up with one. Bush is apparently the kind of guy who would answer "I just push myself too hard, I'm a work-a-holic" when asked "What's your worst quality?" in a job interview. This is the guy that will get elected again in November? Wow.

 John Denver Frequent ejaculations you say? Helps to lower your risk of urlLink prostate cancer . This study confirms an earlier one (.... urlLink mentioned here ). On the same subject, " I'm going home to listen to some John Denver " just replaced " Pulling the goalie " as my euphemism of choice for lowering one's risk of prostate cancer. The logic (as it was explained to me by my local bartender) is that "...everyone does it, but no one talks about it." Smart woman. Variations on a theme: I'm just listening to some 'James Taylor' I think I'm going to stay in and put on some 'Andrew Loyd Webber' Yeah I went to a 'Nickleback concert' last night

 A brush with tallness So my girlfriend and I went to see urlLink Rigoletto last night. Good show. Too many kids.

The performances were excellent (read "Amazing" in the case of urlLink this redhead ). The sets left a little to be desired (I was getting dizzy just looking at the weird perspectives) and the lighting at times reduced the actors on stage to an order of fries waiting to be sold. But what the hell do I know. I do know that the time required to stand in line for a free urinal at the opera is directly related to the sum of the conditions of the prostates ahead of you in line. So while waiting, I noticed a familiar face in the lobby. I asked my girlfriend later "Isn't that former Mayor of Toronto John Sewell?" She wasn't sure because, like me, her only image of him comes from that tiny little picture every week in the urlLink Eye . I mean, I've never met him, I don't think I've ever actually seen him in person, but this guy was a dead ringer. So I did what I normally do in a situation like this: I called my mother. Me: Hi mom. Her: Oh it's so good to hear from you. How are you doing? Me: Great, we're at the opera tonight and it's intermission. I've got a strange question for you. Her: Ok...? Me: Do you remember former Mayor of Toronto John Sewell? Her: Yes. Why? Me: How tall is he? Her: Oh, really tall. Like 6'1'' or 6'2'.' Something like that. He's probably taller then you. Me: Ok great. Thanks mom. I should note at this point that I didn't just cut my mother off there. We chatted about Easter plans and my brother's birthday. She's making a ham. So that was all the evidence I needed to walk up to a complete stranger and tell him that I read his column in the Eye every week. Nice guy. Really tall.

 A postman, a policeman and a hot dog vendor I was walking home yesterday after work and I happened upon an impromptu meeting of 3 men in the street. A traffic cop was smiling and chatting with a hot dog vendor and a Canada post employee. They all stood at a corner, the postman holding his mail bag and standing beside his bright red, Canada Post truck. It struck me as a very wholesome, Norman Rockwell-esque scene, which brightened an otherwise gloomy day. A bite of banality to soothe the soul. As I approached I could see them chatting and joking with each other, maybe sharing the day's experiences and stories about work. There was a slap on the back and a hearty laugh as the group dispersed. A scene like this is comforting, life affirming, and shows cynics like myself that there is a little bit of good in each one of us. I was so moved by what I saw, that I turned to look back on the men after I had passed by. They went off on their separate ways: the postman to the mailbox to fill his bag with love letters and bill payments; the hot dog vendor to a new customer on the approach; and the police officer to the Canada post truck to write down the license plate, fill out a form and post a parking ticket under the wiper blade.

 A personal apology To my girlfriend, Who has had to endure the joke in the previous post, more times then any human being should be reasonably expected to do. I'm sorry. And I'm sorry for the numerous times that it will inevitably surface in the future.

 The Alarms The fire alarm went off in the building where I work. Right above my head. It was a constant, loud, *booooooooooooooop*......*booooooooooooooooop* for about 15 minutes, broken only by an intercom voice stating the obvious "Attention please, attention. An alarm has been activated. The fire department has been notified. Please stand by for further instructions". When the alarm turns on, the fans go off. I'm sure it's like that in every building....something about feeding the fire I think....so there was this weird dusty funk in the air. Sneezing, beeping, voices. Oy. Weird Dusty Funk? I saw them open for Random Emo Band at the Rivoli. Good show. Too many kids.

 Now that's just great See...if the Sun could come up with headlines urlLink like this , then I'd read it more.

 Overheard In the AGO public washroom (take the stairs from the main lobby down, follow the hall and make a left, then a right): ".....was good, I mean, it was alright but the whole thing was just so lugubrious that it was hardly worth it." In the McDonalds at Broadview and Danforth: ".....would you just shut up and eat your fuckin' Happy Meal." I had to urlLink look it up too.

 Call me Kramer I don't get cable anymore, which kind of means that I'm reduced to a single, blurry channel. Sunday morning (whilst watching the Coronation Street with a certain lady-friend) an ad for Tim Hortons came on. As I don't watch a lot of TV anymore, I'm not sure how long the spot has been running. It was the first time my girlfriend had seen it too... We open on an office scene. A couple of young employees meet at a desk, one of them holding two, red, roll-up-the-rim cups in his hands. He's clearly bought a coffee for him and his co-worker... The co-worker stretches his hand out in anticipation of receiving one of the cups, but they are withdrawn. The man holding the cups, dramatically weighs which one he will give to his friend. Eventually one is offered and the co-worker makes a point of taking the other cup. The tag line is...."Nobody wants to give away a winner". Now, I'm not saying that they stole my idea. I'm not saying that it was directly lifted after I so urlLink skillfully articulated the scenario. But it's awfully close... And, I had this idea for a cologne that makes you smell like you just came from the beach....

 A shiny new red pill The urlLink Toronto Sun (the paper with pictures) has redesigned as of this morning. Go on. Blow two bits and pick it up. The editors highlight the changes for you: I'll direct you to a few of the more noticeable changes and enhancements: - A new, strong Page 1 title-piece, displaying the Sun's traditional white on red colour combination. - An expanded Page 2 index to direct readers to their favourite features. - A greater number of stories every day, many in a news-in-brief format. - Larger photographs throughout. - An improved Two-Minute Markets listing (Tuesday-Saturday), but no full TSX listings. Yeah...Larger photographs, less words. News is too wordy anyway, it should all be in easy to understand, analysis free, news-in-brief format. And an expanded index to help you find the articles that aren't there. Oh. And a new logo.

 A beautiful day While cold it's so clear and beautiful out today. Why, from my office window you can see clear across the lake to Hamilton. Yeah. Even on the brightest, clearest most beautiful day, I can still only see Hamilton.

 What's the deal with Dennis Mills? Someone asked me the other day about why Dennis Mills is in the news so much, in such a negative light. I'm certainly not an expert on the campaign but let me try to recap what I can pull together and we'll go from there. I haven't been a constituent of his for long, so the first time I recall seeing him in the news was last summer as the architect of the rockin'-awesome SARSstock concert at Downsview park. I was there and had a great time, so I suppose I owe the Member from Toronto Danforth a thank you. My first encounter with his arrogance however came the next day while watching the local urlLink Bell Globemedia news. A reporter at the concert asked Mills to respond to reports that the price tag for the concert was going to be much higher then he'd originally insisted it would be. He responded (and I'm paraphrasing here because I didn't have the foresight to write it down 10 months ago): "I'm not accountable to you. I'm not accountable to the media. I'm accountable to the House of Commons." Yeah I guess he has a point there... Do other politicians do that? I mean, just give a Royal "Fuck You" when they can't, or don't want to, answer a question? The next round came in February, when Mills released his familiar-looking report on urlLink Toronto's waterfront . I kind of thought it looked like Fung's version, except the Casino was substituted for a "United Nations University of Peace". Whatever brings in the crowd I guess. Mills had a press conference on the 27th of February to announce the plan, but was shouted down by a group of urlLink OCAP protesters demanding that he resign. The OCAP protesters were urlLink then shouted down by a Liberal press handler, causing the Harbour Castle Weston staff to flip the lights on and off quickly until everyone returned to their mats for quiet time. Now, I couldn't figure out what the hell the big deal was at the time, but apparently in November of last year Mills promised to convert an OCAP occupied building on Gerrard St. to social housing within thirty days, or he'd resign his seat. So it was THAT promise that OCAP was holding him to when they crashed his press conference. Thirty days huh? Has any government, anywhere, ever done anything in thirty days? Granted it's been about 7 months since the promise and still no social housing at 558 Gerrard, but really. More recently Mills came under some fire for illegally putting up "campaign" signs. The urlLink City's bylaw officers took a few of them down from public property and gave orders to remove more. They went up all over Riverdale shortly after Mills' waterfront announcement in February. Since the election call (like the day of...) the signs magically changed from this: To this: And in many places the signs simply switched from one to the other overnight. Mills' chief competition in the riding, Jack "First Federal Leader to Campaign with Facial Hair Since the 50s" Layton put up signs of his own long before the election call, but they were ads on billboards up and down the Danforth. Layton and Mills jockey'd for ad space throughout Greektown with Mills winning the coveted Broadview/Danforth "Gateway to the Danforth" corner billboard high atop Wong's Camera shop. The first Layton one is further down the strip, closer to Logan. That's what I've got so far. Yes I took the pictures.

 Eventually it will become passe But for now, I'd like to take a moment and answer a question that was posed to the MSN search engine. Since this site was ranked #1 in the response, I feel an obligation to attempt to answer the query. urlLink "Is pepper the spice bad for the prostate?" Pepper the spice is not bad for the prostate. In fact, if you listen to Ben Kerr (the old man singing on the north east corner of Yonge and Bloor), cayenne pepper (the spice) is good for the prostate. "Pepper", the 'independent entrepreneur' on the corner of Jarvis and Dundas on the other hand is probably bad for the prostate, as well as the mucous membranes, so you might want to steer clear of "her". I hope that clears things up for you.

 Oh you have got to be kidding me Reading from Left to Right: urlLink Jim Harris, Leader of the Green Party of Canada. urlLink Jack Layton, Leader of the NDP urlLink Dennis Mills, incumbent Liberal MP And on the Right end of the Toronto-Danforth See-Saw, up in the air, kicking his feet and hollering at the other kids to please let him down now... Loftus Cuddy, candidate for the urlLink Conservative Party of Canada . Sorry, I'm coming into the coverage pretty late in the game (compared to my honourable urlLink bloggerparts ) but really... the leader of the Greens and the leader of the NDP in the same riding? Jim Harris thy name is Nader.

 Chewing Gum Returns to Singapore Here's a fun little nugget urlLink from Salon : Ultra-tidy Singapore is lifting its notorious ban on chewing gum after 12 long years -- but only for registered users. Gum dealers face jail if they break the rules. Before Singaporeans think about unwrapping a pack of the Wrigley's Orbit gum that's just started selling here -- and only in pharmacies -- they have to submit their names and ID card numbers. If they don't, pharmacists who sell them gum could be jailed up to two years and fined $2,940. This Southeast Asian city-state, known for its immaculate streets and tight social controls, outlawed the manufacture, import and sale of chewing gum in 1992 after the country's founding father, Lee Kuan Yew, complained that it was fouling streets, buildings, buses and subway trains. In the time that I've been...uh.. "Professionally concerned with litter in our city" I've heard a number of colleagues, superiors and assorted citizenry chastise the City's approach to litter management by invoking the world-class example of Singapore. Real people, like you and me, honestly and openly suggesting that Toronto take a Singapore-esque approach to curbing litter. Suggesting things like fines upwards of several hundred dollars for anyone, including children, who are caught littering. "That will teach them". Generally, the suggestions stop short of the corporal punishments that Singapore is also famous for, but not too far off the mark. Singapore banned the sale and use of chewing gum on the whim of a single man, because he felt it made his city unsightly. Here's a brief sampling of the suggestions I've fielded to help curb the litter problem in Toronto: Pass a by-law banning the sale of fast food to any minor, during school hours. Fine school children if they are caught littering and make their parents pay the fine. Place video cameras in heavily littered areas to catch offenders For litter. For LITTER. These are the lengths that some people are willing to go to in order to get their way. The short-sighted, single-minded, knee-jerk solutions that are proposed....the justified means to a desired end. If you thought the ban on pesticides was rough, try banning something like gum, plastic shopping bags, fast food packaging, or the like. It's probably worth noting here that the only two brands of gum which are for sale in Singapore (for therapeutic use only) are urlLink Wrigley's Orbit and urlLink GlaxoSmithKline's Nicorette . Gum became a sticking point months ago in Singapore's free trade talks with Washington, when Representative Philip Crane of the U.S. state of Illinois -- home of chewing gum giant Wrigley -- pressed the issue. Ok so...the powerful multinational chewing gum/pharmaceutical lobbies took issue with Singapore's hard line on gum, and worked their business into free trade talks? What's the Singapore market worth to Wrigley's? 8 Billion? 9 Billion? Why on earth would an American house representative push for this? Can anyone have an opinion of their own, right or wrong, without a corporation thrusting itself on the issue?

 Yeah. THAT Bill Gates You know...I'd read that Bill Gates partially owned the landfill in Michigan that Toronto sends it's garbage to every day, but I kind of thought "it's a common name....it couldn't possibly be THE Bill Gates." Well yeah, it is. William H. Gates III owns (I think) urlLink just under 12% of Republic Services which owns the Michigan landfill that has a contract with the City of Toronto. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF FIVE PERCENT SHAREHOLDERS The following table shows certain information as of March 1, 2004 with respect to the beneficial ownership of common stock by each of our stockholders who is known by us to be a beneficial owner of more than 5% of our outstanding common stock.

This whole post is of course in reference to this morning's article in the Globe urlLink which again mentioned Bill Gates as partial owner of Republic's landfill. I know this is all investing, and corporate governance, and ownership of companies that own other companies.... And that Bill Gates isn't sitting in his mansion, wringing his hands and salivating at the thought of you throwing bag after bag of garbage on Toronto's streets.... But who knows. Maybe he is.

 Sorry I can't resist. This is so strange it needs attention. Bush. He got scuffed up a few days ago after a fall from his mountain bike ride around the ranch in Crawford. A Whitehouse spokesman (Trent Duffy) explained the fall this way: "It's been raining a lot and the topsoil is loose," Duffy said. "You know this president. He likes to go all-out. Suffice it to say he wasn't whistling show tunes." Ok so...he wasn't gay? What the hell does the show-tunes thing mean? It was Raining. A lot. In Crawford. Loose topsoil. Actually no, it wasn't. urlLink Daily Kos compiles the quotes and the precipitation reports for the area where Bush took a tumble.

 Greater men then you have tried to censor him Now...I'm not usually one to take the Drudge Report at face value... According to urlLink Drudge : ESPN SCRUBS HUNTER S. THOMPSON BUSH BASH Monday May 24 2004 17:50:09 ET Hunter S. Thompson's ESPN column was scrubbed of controversy late Monday afternoon when online editors worried the famed gonzo journalist had gone too far. In a column entitled, "Let's Go to the Olympics," Thompson went off on the Abu Ghraib prison picture scandal, exclaiming: "Not even the foulest atrocities of Adolf Hitler ever shocked me so badly as these [Abu Ghraib] photographs did." But after being linked to the DRUDGE REPORT, a top editor demanded the sentence be immediately edited --without Thompson's okay, according to an ESPN.com staffer. "Hunter can go too far sometimes," the Bristol-based ESPN employee told the DRUDGE REPORT. The cleansed paragraph now reads: "These horrifying digital snapshots of the American dream in action on foreign soil are worse than anything even I could have expected. I have been in this business a long time and I have seen many staggering things, but this one is over the line. As with the original, Thompson still concludes with the thought: "Now I am really ashamed to carry an American passport." Developing... The column in it's current, allegedly sanitized form urlLink is here on the ESPN website. Of course if the good Doctor intended to use the original phrasing, he'd be in violation of urlLink Godwin's Law , and we'd have to dock him points.

 The Prince Edward Viaduct I was walking home from work the other night. As I crossed the Danforth bridge on the south side there was a guy playing the luminous veil like a harp. He was getting pretty good sound out of it. I asked if he played professionally, and he told me that I could catch him, and the rest of The Infrastructure Players on Thursday night at the Dufferin works yard. I hear the guy on the salt dome is amazing.

 To the Queen Word. So I see that while I was in the warm, pine-fresh comfort of a loved one's family cottage this weekend, an election got called. I suppose it's about time for me (and the rest of us) to stop paying attention to the sleeping elephant next to us, and do some good, old fashioned Canadian introspection. It's suffering from night terrors recently and it's been keeping me up, so it's probably for the best. I'll reveal now that I live in the home riding of a certain, federal leader and intend on seeing a few debates during the run. You know...to get my money's worth out of this. urlLink Jack Layton : Let his mustache tickle our economy's upper lip. (That was the best I could come up with tonight. Give me a couple of weeks...) By way of housekeeping.... This site ranked 28th in the list of pages returned by urlLink this Sympatico search . Sounds like I should get a little more focus around here....

 Who would have thought.. Via urlLink Shatnerian : Toronto urlLink What Canadian City Are You? brought to you by urlLink Quizilla Maybe it's got something to do with the fact that I am 2.5 million people. We are legion.

 Garbage Man. There was this little bit in urlLink the Globe this morning from the AP: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says it is taking some steps to deal with the flow of thousands of tonnes of Canadian trash into the Michigan landfill. In a letter to U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, made public yesterday, EPA administrator Mike Leavitt said the agency may give Michigan a one-time grant to help make sure trash crossing the border meets its environmental and recycling regulations. The press release from Stabenow sums up the urlLink details here . I hope to God you're not looking to me for a solution to this problem... urlLink Seriously , maybe I'm just a pessimist, but I think we're boned. I'm not just saying that as someone who may, or may not, work for the Solid Waste Department of this fair city; I am saying that as a casual, tax paying citizen who has no direct control over this situation. Let's forget everything else here: Let's forget the 125-145 trucks filled with 30 tonnes each of our garbage that we send to Michigan every day; Let's forget about the piles of garbage dumped in our alleys, laneways, parks, hydro corridors, and ravines by jackasses who don't want to pay the fees or abide by the procedures to dispose of their garbage properly; Let's forget about the editorials that spout how "dirty" and "disgusting" our city has become, and how it's all the mismanagement and fault of City Hall that bits of garbage are visible to the easily offended eye; Let's forget how "difficult" and "confusing" programs like the blue and grey boxes and the new source separated organics (Green Bin) programs are for the average citizen; Let's forget about the fact that Toronto has no operational landfills, no space within it's borders for a new landfill and that the Province has no new landfills under development, let alone under the 8-10 years of review required for approval, essentially indicating that we have no intention of building a landfill within our borders; Let's forget about how outraged business owners are that they have to pay $3.10 per bag of garbage that they want the City to pick up; Let's forget how close that system of "user-pay" is to being imposed on each one of us; and Let's forget the sanctimonious harping of every doomsday-sayer like myself. Let's instead, remember that every bag of garbage that we put at the curb may be the first bag returned from the border, dropped at our feet, with no legal ground under which to bury it... Let's remember that for a few moments. I'm sorry if that sounds righteous and holier-then-thou, but the truth of the matter is that a little thing urlLink like this , will close the border to our garbage, and force us to, for the first time in our lives, take responsibility for the garbage that we buy, produce, consume, stuff into garbage bags and will away with the power of "paying taxes". I need a beer.

 To another blogger urlLink Kinsella . I've been there. My dear brother, when I was young, and when he was even younger. And yes, it's madness. I still can't imagine what our parents went through. No one knows how to react, no one knows what's going to happen, and every curveball feels like the breaking point. Put faith in your support and put faith in the system that we all take for granted in this country. We're all wishing the best for you and yours.

 It's been a long time running... It's been a long time coming.... It's well worth the wait. I hope anyway. It's been a week since I last opened this thing up, and I see that at least one urlLink person out there was wondering about my opinion on a topic true to my name. Got to get a few other things off my chest first... Flitting back to that subject for a second.... Hamilton, Copps coliseum, as 2002 merged seamlessly into 2003, Gord Downie singing acapella on stage, balloons and streamers falling from the rafters, and a redhead on my arm... If that's the last thing that flashes through my head, they'll find me with a smile on my face.

 Where's a high powered egg launcher when you need it? It's 7:30 and I have a serious homicidal urge. Or suicidal. Either will suffice in this situation. I am one of the mercifully few people in this world who live across the street from an amateur improv theatre. I know there are much worse things to live across the street from: an open pit sewer or a Denny's come to mind, but an amateur improv theatre is right down there. Tonight, due to the warm weather (thank you very much God), the burgeoning improv-lets are doing their warm-up exercises out front, on the street, directly across from my open window. They must be plenty warm by now, because it's been going on for a half an hour. I swear to the aforementioned God, that they've been rhythmically clapping their extroverted little paws together and chanting in some creativity-inducing, pre-acting warm up since I poured my first shaky glass of scotch tonight. Improv dipshit #1: (as fast as his tongue will allow) Money money money money money money money money money money money STOP!!! (excitedly points at Improv dipshit #2) Improv dipshit #2: Money money money money money money money money money money money STOP!!! (excitedly points at Improv dipshit #3) Continue ad nauseum. Meant to sharpen their skills of "hand off" or "Spot grab" or whatever, but like their final product it dissolved into a group giggle. Next week. On the roof. 2 dozen eggs. I'll be waiting.

 Van Helsing I'm not usually one for internet movie forums, but Van Helsing did something to me in that dark theatre on Friday night. I just had to see what the rest of the world had to say about it. I found the urlLink following post about Van Helsing at urlLink rottentomatoes.com 1. THIS ISN'T GONNA WIN ANY OSCARS - don't go in expecting Titanic or Gone With The Wind. 2. THIS ISNT TITANIC! - So don't go in expecting Titanic 3. What you don't understan is that you can't think through this movie. This isn't Titanic or a foreign movie. You just have to look. 4. The acting isn't that great, but again, THIS ISN'T TITANIC! Don't go in expecting good acting. 5. It's not all that funny, but this isn't Seeinfeld or Titanic here. The jokes are excellent for this type of Summer movie 6. It plot is confusing at times, but this movie isn't running for any Oscars here. And if you think the plot doesnt make sense, well, do Werewolves make sense? Case point. 7. Don't go in expecting nipples, this isn't Titanic here. It's questionable whether or not vampires have them, so enough said. 8. The begining of the movie has no color. This may annoy some people or think that somethings wrong, but it's not. Just try to think of it as an old movie, or watching a new movie through sunglasses and it will make sense. 9. It's very entertaining and a visual treat. Great movie to eat with popcorn. 10. It might have just been in the version of Van Helsing that I downloaded, but it sounded great and very loud. I live in Chile Boy I really wish I had read that before going to see Hugh Jackman battle Dracula, Frankenstein and the Wolfman. I'll admit I was kind of expecting Titanic.

 Once again Here you go. Read urlLink this one too. From the Article 15-6 Investigation of the 800th Military Police Brigade 6. (S) I find that the intentional abuse of detainees by military police personnel included the following acts: a. (S) Punching, slapping, and kicking detainees; jumping on their naked feet; b. (S) Videotaping and photographing naked male and female detainees; c. (S) Forcibly arranging detainees in various sexually explicit positions for photographing; d. (S) Forcing detainees to remove their clothing and keeping them naked for several days at a time; e. (S) Forcing naked male detainees to wear womens underwear; f. (S) Forcing groups of male detainees to masturbate themselves while being photographed and videotaped; g. (S) Arranging naked male detainees in a pile and then jumping on them; h. (S) Positioning a naked detainee on a MRE Box, with a sandbag on his head, and attaching wires to his fingers, toes, and penis to simulate electric torture; i. (S) Writing I am a Rapest (sic) on the leg of a detainee alleged to have forcibly raped a 15-year old fellow detainee, and then photographing him naked; j. (S) Placing a dog chain or strap around a naked detainees neck and having a female Soldier pose for a picture; k. (S) A male MP guard having sex with a female detainee; l. (S) Using military working dogs (without muzzles) to intimidate and frighten detainees, and in at least one case biting and severely injuring a detainee; m. (S) Taking photographs of dead Iraqi detainees. There is so much more to come, and I don't think that an actual, or sort-of appology, from Bush, Rumsfeld, or whoever, is going to make it right. Iraqis, and Arabs in general will be looking for vengance. This is going to get so much worse, and we should all be very very scared. I know I am.

 Just to let you know: From the Presidential urlLink Executive Order 13303 : I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, find that the threat of attachment or other judicial process against the Development Fund for Iraq, Iraqi petroleum and petroleum products, and interests therein, and proceeds, obligations, or any financial instruments of any nature whatsoever arising from or related to the sale or marketing thereof, and interests therein, obstructs the orderly construction of Iraq, the restoration and maintenance of peace and security in the country, and the development of political, administrative, and economic institutions in Iraq. This situation constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States and I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat. I hereby order: Section 1. Unless licensed or otherwise authorized pursuant to this order, any attachment, judgment, decree, lien, execution, garnishment, or other judicial process is prohibited, and shall be deemed null and void, with respect to the following: (a) the Development Fund for Iraq, and (b) all Iraqi petroleum and petroleum products, and interests therein, and proceeds, obligations, or any financial instruments of any nature whatsoever arising from or related to the sale or marketing thereof, and interests therein, in which any foreign country or a national thereof has any interest, that are in the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the possession or control of United States persons. And from Presidential urlLink Executive Order 13290 : I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, hereby determine that the United States and Iraq are engaged in armed hostilities, that it is in the interest of the United States to confiscate certain property of the Government of Iraq and its agencies, instrumentalities, or controlled entities, and that all right, title, and interest in any property so confiscated should vest in the Department of the Treasury. I intend that such vested property should be used to assist the Iraqi people and to assist in the reconstruction of Iraq, and determine that such use would be in the interest of and for the benefit of the United States. I hereby order: Section 1 . All blocked funds held in the United States in accounts in the name of the Government of Iraq, the Central Bank of Iraq, Rafidain Bank, Rasheed Bank, or the State Organization for Marketing Oil are hereby confiscated and vested in the Department of the Treasury, except for the following: (a) any such funds that are subject to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations or the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, or that enjoy equivalent privileges and immunities under the laws of the United States, and are or have been used for diplomatic or consular purposes, and (b) any such amounts that as of the date of this order are subject to postjudgment writs of execution or attachment in aid of execution of judgments pursuant to section 201 of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (Public Law 107 297), provided that, upon satisfaction of the judgments on which such writs are based, any remainder of such excepted amounts shall, by virtue of this order and without further action, be confiscated and vested. But it's not about the oil, right? It's about liberation.

 What do we do now? Ok, I was just flipping through urlLink this site , and this particular article has come to light a few times recently: Art. 13. Prisoners of war must at all times be humanely treated. Any unlawful act or omission by the Detaining Power causing death or seriously endangering the health of a prisoner of war in its custody is prohibited, and will be regarded as a serious breach of the present Convention. In particular, no prisoner of war may be subjected to physical mutilation or to medical or scientific experiments of any kind which are not justified by the medical, dental or hospital treatment of the prisoner concerned and carried out in his interest. Likewise, prisoners of war must at all times be protected, particularly against acts of violence or intimidation and against insults and public curiosity. Measures of reprisal against prisoners of war are prohibited.(Convention III, Art. 13) There's lots to say, and lots has been said, but I'd like to look at the last bit of the second paragraph, which indicates that Prisoners of War must be protected "against insults and public curiosity." Last year, on urlLink Face the Nation , Donald Rumsfeld accused the then Iraqi government of violating the Geneva convention, after footage of American soldiers being interrogated was aired on Al-Jazeera. urlLink Human Rights watch agreed , but pointed out the unintentional irony in Rumsfeld's view. Seems the US did the same thing. (Thanks to urlLink Slate for the links and the memory refreshment) A year and a month later, MORE pictures have come out that show, not only Iraqi Prisoners of War, but showing them being grotesquely humiliated. Clearly a pictorial representation of violations of the Geneva Convention (wrt POWs), but also a violation itself in that prisoners are shown off as public curiosity. Ok. But the US government didn't release the photos, they were taken by individual US military personal, and obtained by a US based news agency: CBS, owned by a US based communications company: urlLink Viacom . There seems to be no indication that the pictures are fake (I'm talking about the American ones here, not the British ones). So it would follow that, if the pictures are what everyone claims they are, then they are a violation of the rights of prisoners of war as stipulated in the Geneva Convention. So: Who do we hold responsible? An Iraqi would, presumably, hold the US government responsible. Viacom, and therefore CBS who first broadcast the pictures on "60 Minutes II", is an American company, and as such falls under American rules and American responsibility. The US government should have reigned in CBS once it was clear that CBS was going to air the pictures, to save itself from violating the "public curiosity" part of the Article. It would of course still be responsible for the actual POW violations that occurred, but at least these men might have retained their dignity. Vicom might declare their right of free speech, and the right of the American public to know what it's military had done to Prisoners of War during the present conflict. The press in the US is free, and as such isn't under the control of the State. The fact that everyone knew that the pictures were going to be aired, should indicate that the US government had all the time it needed to obtain any court, national security or presidential order (could such things occur?) to halt the public broadcast of the pictures. Presumably, no orders were given. Would the US government really throw up it's hands in the face of a violation of their own constitution, and allow a repeated violation human rights, simply to preserve the freedom of its own press? The US Government might claim that the prisoners were violated without official knowledge. That the pictures were taken by individuals who have been subsequently reprimanded, and were broadcast by a international corporation whose various holdings and assets are invested in the global economy....perhaps it's was as much Canada's, or Britain's responsibility to force Viacom to not air the photographs. Arguably some benefit has come from this violation of the Geneva Convention. I certainly wouldn't be talking about it if CBS hadn't aired the pictures nor would anyone else, save the dipshit who snapped the shots. Since this "public curiosity" part of the article has been broken, we now know about all of the other mistreatments that POWs have had at the hands of their American captors. Ok, next question. What are we calling the guys in the picture? Are they Iraqi military personal? Under what military do they now exist? After a nation has been toppled, with no rulers, no military, and only the present occupiers in charge, what do we call the subsequent men in uniform? Are they Prisoners of War? Are they these now the "enemy combatants" that we've heard so much about? I hear that one has rights under international law and the other doesn't.... What if these guys are just some men like us or our fathers, who fought against the invading military force who had taken over their country? What are they then? Are they prisoners of war? There's lots of room for the definition of a Prisoner of War under urlLink Article 4 of the Third Geneva Convention , and therefore lots of reasons to classify the men in the pictures as recognized Prisoners of War. Maybe there's some argument that the men in the pictures are excluded from POW standing, but that's for the lawyers to decide, right? What do we do with the urlLink private contractors who are involved in this same incident? Do Geneva convention rules apply to companies who's employees violate human rights, and the rules of war? Finally, what will happen when the US inevitably spins its way out of this one? We've all just witnessed a clear violation of international law by the United States, and when they tell their people that "they were all bad guys", or that "a few bad apples spoiled what was otherwise a very pleasant war", or that "freedom ain't free", or whatever homespun metaphor will help the Yanks justify what has happened.....what will we do then?

 Voted most likely to be ignored Wow. Remember when the US was accused of human rights violations in Iraq? urlLink I do : U.S. accused of human rights violations in Fallujah Last Updated Mon, 03 May 2004 18:42:28 BAGHDAD - UN human rights investigator Paul Hunt is calling for an independent inquiry into how the U.S. military's siege of Fallujah has affected civilians. Hunt says that while reliable information is difficult to obtain, there are credible claims that U.S. forces have been guilty of serious human rights breaches in their month-long siege of the city. He notes some reports say that 90 per cent of the deaths during the fighting have been non-combatants and he is urging the U.S.-led civil administration in Iraq to launch the independent probe. Meanwhile, U.S. officials have tossed aside one Iraqi general and named another to command an Iraqi brigade in Fallujah. They now say former intelligence officer Mohammed Latif and not Republican Guard veteran Mohammed Jasim Saleh will lead Iraqi forces in disarming Fallujah's insurgents. Saleh was the Pentagon's choice until the weekend when officials in Washington voiced misgivings. Critics say Saleh took part in the bloody suppression of a 1991 Shia uprising in Iraq. In contrast, Latif has a history of opposing Saddam Hussein. U.S. troops also came under heavy fire in the holy city of Najaf on Monday, where fighters loyal to a radical Shia cleric have attacked with machine-guns and mortars. The U.S. has vowed to capture or kill religious leader Muqtada al-Sadr, whose militia launched an uprising early last month. In Baghdad, U.S. forces used artillery to pound rebel positions in the west of the city. More American soldiers were also killed on Monday. Iraqi fighters killed one U.S. soldier guarding a captured weapons cache in the capital. West of the city, a U.S. marine was killed, bringing the total of American dead since the war began to 755.

 Warren Kinsella-type ass kicking urlLink Warren recalls the past.... May 2, 2004 - It would be churlish - cruel, even - to suggest that a journalist of Ben Mulroney's immense stature receives his columns from his father's secretary, via the fax room at Ogilvy Renault in Montreal. The Sun papers - all of Canadian journalism, in fact - are honoured by his continued willingness to balance TV celebrity interviews with scintillating political analysis. How does he do it? And all whilst keeping his hair so neat and tidy? Let me say it, once and for all: Ben has his weekly Sun urlLink column because he is our generation's I. F. (Izzy) Stone. The fact that his father is the chairman of the newspaper's board is entirely coincidental. Ahem. In any event, in today's masterwork, Ben writes this: Obviously, to attack the Tories makes political sense for the Liberals. But what is politically effective is not always good for the country, and what this country needs more than an election campaign, more than attack ads and more than a Warren Kinsella-type ass-kicking is an open and effective debate. I could not agree more. What a genius this fetching young lad is. But - and I hesitate to raise this, so forgive me - what is Benji's view of his father's celebrated decision to, and I quote, "bomb the bridges" about his Liberal opponent in the federal election campaign of 1988? You know, the one that relied upon millions in business contributions, and shadowy "independent" corporate coalitions, to deploy some of the most vicious attack ads anyone has ever seen in Canada: what about that? Given the junior Mulroney's newfound fondness for "open and effective debate," I can only assume he will now condemn his father's shocking descent into the political depths. Here is Ben's personal email address, should you wish to urge him to take a stand on this important issue: justben@mail.com. Tell him Warren Kinsella-type Ass-Kicker sent you! Heh..."Benji". Mental note: Don't piss Kinsella off.

 Wow Uh..wow. From the urlLink transcript of the Rose Garden press conference with Paul Martin: Q Mr. President, could you tell us what you'd like to see Canada doing on Iraq, both diplomatically and in terms, eventually, of getting possibly police and troops on the ground there? PRESIDENT BUSH: My first answer to that is, I want to Canada to do what it feels comfortable doing in Iraq. That's -- and that's what I told the Prime Minister before. Canada is an independent nation. Canada makes -- will make its decisions based upon her own judgment. The Prime Minister shares my deep desire for there to be peace in the world. And to the extent that the country feels comfortable in helping that, we're grateful. Canada is doing a lot in Afghanistan. Canada is doing a lot in Haiti. Canada is a contributor to reconstruction in Iraq. And I am grateful to be able to talk to a friend who shares the same goal, which is affecting behavior in a way that's based upon our values of human rights, human dignity, and freedom. And we've got no better partner in understanding the power of free societies. There's a lot of people in the world who don't believe that people whose skin color may not be the same as ours can be free and self-govern. I reject that. I reject that strongly. I believe that people who practice the Muslim faith can self-govern. I believe that people whose skins aren't necessarily -- are a different color than white can self-govern. And the Prime Minister -- I don't want to put words in his mouth -- but I think he shares that great sense of optimism and possibility. And it's good to have a friend who shares that with us. Would you like to have the First Ladies come on up? PRIME MINISTER MARTIN: I've got to say, though, I really do like sharing a press conference with you. You answer those questions perfectly. (Laughter.) PRESIDENT BUSH: Thank you. Record that. Q (Question asked in French.) PRIME MINISTER MARTIN: (Responding in French.) If you can give me just two seconds, I'm going to translate. They want it. PRESIDENT BUSH: Some of these guys understand French. (Laughter.) Raise your hand, Gregory. (Laughter.) PRIME MINISTER MARTIN: (Translating his remarks in French.) PRESIDENT BUSH: Listen, thank you all. Ahem....first of all: There's a lot of people in the world who don't believe that people whose skin color may not be the same as ours can be free and self-govern. I reject that. I reject that strongly. I believe that people who practice the Muslim faith can self-govern. I believe that people whose skins aren't necessarily -- are a different color than white can self-govern. Bush went on to say: "Look, there's a lot of people out there who believe that murdering little babies is ok. I reject that. I reject that strongly. Folks, President Bush believes that people whose skins aren't necessarily -- are a different colour then white, can self govern. Welcome George. Welcome to, what...reality? the 20th Century? the 21st Century. Could we please let India know that Bush thinks it's ok that they govern themselves? Wow. He's the one that's going to get re-elected huh? I've got to say, though, I really do like sharing a press conference with you. You answer those questions perfectly. He sure does Paul. He sure does.

 Poisoning 8 year old girls for attending school Silly girls, school isn't for you. Not in recently urlLink liberated Afghanistan anyway . "I will not call anyone an Afghan or a Muslim who poisons an eight-year-old child because she is schoolgoing," Karzai said. "They are beasts." Vikram Parekh, from the International Crisis Group, said there had been a series of attacks on girls' schools, particularly in the south of the country, in recent months but this was the first time children had been attacked. "A girl's school was recently burnt to the ground in Kandahar and others have been attacked, but this is a horrible development to see that the girls themselves would be targeted," he told the Guardian. Same story. urlLink Different paper . Children are the future indeed.

 The painfully obvious urlLink Here are the most predictable results of a hypothesis ever published. Obese girls and boys bullied more often, research finds Obese children and teenagers -- and chubby girls in particular -- are far more likely to be victims of bullying than their normal-weight peers, according to new Canadian research.And, as they grow older, overweight teens -- boys especially -- are far more likely to turn the tables and become bullies themselves, the study revealed. "Almost all the research that is done focuses on the physical aspects of obesity, but this study tells us that there's this whole other psychological component that's really important to explore," Ian Janssen, a researcher in the department of community health and epidemiology at Queen's University in Kingston, Ont., said. The study, published in today's edition of the medical journal Pediatrics, found that about one in seven Canadian children aged 11 to 16 are victims of bullying. Ten per cent of girls of normal weight are bullied, compared with 15 per cent of overweight girls and 23 per cent of obese girls. Among boys, 11 per cent of those of normal weight are bullied, compared with 14 per cent in the overweight group and more than 15 per cent of the obese boys. The research showed that bullying of heavy children gets more frequent and more violent as they move into their teen years, when adolescents are overly conscious of their maturing bodies. It also revealed that obese children strike back. "My guess is that after being bullied for a while, they retaliate," Dr. Janssen said. He stressed, however, that the research was designed to look at the link between weight and bullying, but does not explain why it occurs. "We can only hypothesize about the whys," he said, before adding: "But it kind of makes sense that the fat kids get picked on." Dr. Janssen said bullying has particularly devastating effects on teenagers, because their most important relationships are with their peers."Bullying can have devastating developmental consequences. It can really affect these kids profoundly," he said. The research was conducted on a sample of 5,749 boys and girls aged 11 to 16 from across Canada. The information was collected in 2002 as part of a 35-country survey by the World Health Organization. The researchers looked at various forms of bullying, including verbal (name-calling, teasing), physical (punching, hitting, kicking), relational (being ostracized) and sexual harassment. Girls were most likely to be victims of physical bullying, while boys are victims of relational bullying. Dr. Janssen said what surprised him most was the violent behaviour of girls. "You don't usually associate the hitting, punching and kicking with girls, you think it would be more about relationships." Dr. Janssen said the lack of physical attacks on obese boys is easy to explain. "Boys who are overweight and obese are often big and strong -- the kid who is the offensive lineman on the football team -- so not many others are going to pick on them, at least physically," he said. Dr. Janssen said schools should also take some lessons from the data, and adapt their anti-bullying programs so they pay particular attention to obese and overweight youth. I added the italics to point out that the scientist in question, probably administered his share of wedgies and pink-bellies to the lard-os in his 7th grade class. That line about the offensive lineman on the football team kind of makes me chuckle though. God help you if you go to suburban highschool just west of Hamilton that has NO interest in supporting a football team. The fat kid who should be an offensive lineman, ends up being the fat kid who plays tuba. Trust me on this one....there's no respect. I'm waiting for the next study that shows that fat kids are the funny ones, and that girls like them, but 'just as a friend'.

 Heh... From the Spam folder this morning: Subject: Startle the women with your big p .eni s Wow...really? Startle them? I guess the element of supprise is desirable in both love and war.

 Today's the Day Ok. The polls have been open since 9:30 this morning and they'll be open until 9:30 tonight. After I vote, I'm getting together with my girlfriend and we're going to watch the election night coverage in the traditional Canadian way: Take-out pizza and some beer. We'll probably flip channels and compare coverage, hair pieces, news sets, and affects of the urlLink hosts and urlLink little helpers . I hear urlLink Kinsella will be one of the talking heads on Global tonight. After reading an email from a friend who was confused as to where she should vote, I submit the following two links to help her, and anyone else who might be confused about the procedure for today: Don't know where to vote? Click urlLink here . Don't know when to vote? Click urlLink here . Don't know how to vote? The polling location has instructions and diagrams in a number of languages. If you need help there's plenty of election volunteers who you can ask. Don't know who to vote for? You've got some reading to do. Try urlLink here , or urlLink here , or urlLink here to start. Don't know what to wear while you vote? Casual or business attire is acceptable, as is anything you normally drape yourself in outside of your apartment. About the only thing you're not allow to wear are political buttons or party support t-shirts. Those returning officers are usually 80 year old women and they can get pretty feisty about the rules. Leave your "Jack it up" thong at home for tonight. Don't know why to vote? Simply (and there are many other reasons) this is, by all accounts, going to be one of the closest elections in Canadian history. A small number of votes can and will change the outcome of the election in many ridings in Canada. If you sit this one out you're not allowed to complain tomorrow. I've got my voter card at home but apparently I don't need to bring it with me. Photo ID with a signature and your address on it (like a driver's license) should suffice. If you're not on the voter's list, you can fill out a form at your polling station and get your ballot. The good people at Elections Canada make it remarkably easy to contribute to democracy, so you should take advantage of their hard work and benefit at the polls tonight. I put my postal code into the urlLink Election's Canada site and it told me that I should go to Chester Village at 717 Broadview Ave. It's a nursing home and it's the same place that I voted in the Provincial election in the fall. It was right during dinner and while I'm sure the residents weren't thrilled with the public intrusion, the bean salad and cherry cobler just wouldn't taste the same if they knew a young scamp like myself was skipping out on democracy. Me? I'm doing it for the Grandmas and Grandpas at Chester Village. Word. Have fun, and you're only allowed to have a beer after the polls...not before.

 Cannon I just shot one off down the hallway and no one noticed. There is no one here today. I hear some faint typing off in the distance, and some fax machine beeping, but other then that there might be 3 or 4 people here. I'm pretty sure we can't take a day off to vote, and I'm pretty sure that it makes more sense to take, say, Friday of this week off instead of Monday, but there it is. A big cannon ball bouncing around at the other end of the hallway with no one to fire it back to me. A municipal summer. It doesn't get any lonelier then this...

 We Made Fox News Anything to do with guns and urlLink crazy people . And the prize goes to... urlLink Ingrid Philipp of Toronto for writing the most predictable letter to the editor of all time.

 Garbage Day There's a Works Committee meeting Tuesday at the City with a meaty garbage urlLink agenda . From one of the reports... (6) Recommendation No. (24) be amended by defining the meaning of 'litter'. Litter can be generally defined as public space waste. It is commonly understood to be waste (garbage, recyclables and organic matter) that is consumed, and its usefulness terminated, in public spaces. It is either disposed of properly (in litter bins) or improperly (on the ground or otherwise). In 2002 the City of Toronto conducted an audit of the "on the ground" litter stream, and identified 5 major categories of brand ownership: - Beverage containers (e.g., aluminum cans, glass and plastic bottles) - Confectioners (e.g., candy wrappers, gum) - Publishers (e.g., newspapers, magazines) - Quick Service (e.g., fast food wrappers, coffee cups) - Tobacco (e.g., cigarette butts, packaging) While these five major categories of brand ownership comprise most of the litter stream, they do not account for every possible example of litter. Other common examples, which fall outside of these categories, include: plastic grocery bags, drinking straws, napkins, condoms, fruit peels and cores, plastic cutlery, etc. The purpose of designating litter under the WDO funding model is to attempt to recover some of the costs of municipal litter management from the manufacturers of the products which end up in the litter stream. As such, identifying and defining the exact brand makeup of the items in the litter stream is important, but very complex. A new committee, the Provincial Litter Reduction Committee, is currently being formed and will be facilitated by the Municipal Waste Integration Network (MWIN). One of the objectives of the committee will be to examine the designation of the litter stream, regulatory framework and funding partners for a litter program, and present the findings to the Province and WDO. The City of Toronto has been invited to be a member of the new MWIN Provincial Litter Reduction Committee and, working with other municipalities and brand owners, will attempt to define and designate litter for WDO funding. Heh...condoms. Bet you didn't see that one coming! There's also this little gem: (b) an action plan to find and/or create markets for aerosol cans and aluminum foil to allow the quickest possible introduction to the blue box. Empty aerosol cans and aluminum foil containers are already included in the Blue Box program. This whole report ( urlLink here, in PDF ) is basically in response to all of the motions and questions that the Councilors had for the original report ( urlLink here, in PDF ). It must be oddly satisfying to answer a Councilor's suggestion for service improvement with "Yeah...We already do that, and we've been doing for 3 years now." There will no doubt be some news and reaction on Wednesday.

 The F-bomb I'm going to leave tales of Dogs and Monsters and the Clash of the Danforth Titans for a few moments to focus on the Elephant to the south. If you haven't heard yet, US Vice President Dick Cheney said a bad word to a Democratic Senator. The word was "fuck" and it was either in the context "Fuck off" or "Go fuck yourself". urlLink CNN tells the tale : Cheney, who as president of the Senate was present for the picture day, turned to Leahy and scolded the senator over his recent criticism of the vice president for Halliburton's alleged war profiteering. Cheney is the former CEO of Halliburton, and Democrats have suggested that while serving in the Bush administration he helped win lucrative contracts for his former firm, including a no-bid contract to rebuild Iraq. Cheney's office has said repeatedly that the vice president has no role in government contracting and has severed all financial ties with the Texas-based oil services conglomerate. Cheney was chief executive officer of Halliburton from 1995 to 2000. He resigned when he became George Bush's running mate. In response to Cheney, Leahy reminded Cheney that the vice president had once accused him of being a bad Catholic, to which Cheney replied either "f--- off" or "go f--- yourself." Similar version urlLink here at My Way Ok, so it wasn't on TV and the Senate wasn't in session, so there are some immediate contrasts to the point I'm about to raise. But bear with me because there's relevance here. The FCC ( urlLink Federal Communications Commission ) are the American broadcast regulators, and they're like the CRTC up here. They, among other things, decide what can and can not be broadcast over the television and radio signals in the US. The FCC has been in the news a lot recently for their crackdown of offensive material on public airwaves. Most notably, they fined Howard Stern and his carriers for broadcasting a description of a "blumpkin"; they raised a stink over Janet Jackson's "wardrobe malfunction" during the Superbowl half-time show; and they ruled against NBC, in a landmark decision, for failing to censor Bono when he exclaimed that his Golden Globe award was "fucking brilliant" on live TV. As I mentioned, the FCC is not only cracking down on offensive material, but are defining what is and is not offensive, in decisions urlLink like this one against NBC's Golden Globe broadcast. From the decision (see the urlLink decision document for footnotes): ...we disagree with the Bureau and conclude that use of the phrase at issue is within the scope of our indecency definition because it does depict or describe sexual activities. We recognize NBC's argument that the "FWord" here was used "as an intensifier."23 Nevertheless, we believe that, given the core meaning of the "F-Word," any use of that word or a variation, in any context, inherently has a sexual connotation, and therefore falls within the first prong of our indecency definition. Fuck, in any context, in any variation, has an inherently sexual connotation. OK? Fuck off, fucked up, fucking brilliant, fuckin' eh, that fucking jackass who lives down the street... all invariably invoke a corse sexual image. Continuing, on whether the broadcast is inherently offensive: The "F-Word" is one of the most vulgar, graphic and explicit descriptions of sexual activity in the English language. Its use invariably invokes a coarse sexual image. The use of the "F-Word" here, on a nationally telecast awards ceremony, was shocking and gratuitous. In this regard, NBC does not claim that there was any political, scientific or other independent value of use of the word here, or any other factors to mitigate its offensiveness.25 If the Commission were routinely not to take action against isolated and gratuitous uses of such language on broadcasts when children were expected to be in the audience, this would likely lead to more widespread use of the offensive language.26 If Bono saying the "fucking brilliant" will lead to more widespread use of the offensive language amongst children, then surely the Vice President of the United States saying "Go fuck yourself" to an elected colleague will do the same. Right, right..but the Senate wasn't in session. The comment wasn't broadcast, and clearly Cheney's political enemies are using this incident to further their own partisan interests. But here's my point Dude. The FCC has said that the use of the term, in any context, is patently offensive. Now, while that may not apply to the local shmoe on the street (no one has banned the use of the word outright), but surely this federal decision would carry some weight with the man who sits in the second highest seat of Federal power. Surely the VP would agree that the term is offensive and would take responsibility for setting an example for American children by not using the word anywhere, let alone in the hallowed Senate chambers. My beef isn't with Cheney here, he can fucking say whatever he wants, it's with the idea of legislating morality. My beef is with the hypocrisy of a nation which prides itself, seemingly ahead of everything else, on free speech but will say, in black and white terms, that a certain word means a certain thing in any context, and that it is offensive when used. "Fucking brilliant" is without a doubt an intensifier, which reflects the common speech and language of the vast majority of listeners. Did anyone picture two individuals having brilliant intercourse when Bono won his award? "Go fuck yourself", on the other hand, does attempt to invoke a coarse sexual image of either masturbation or gymnastics. Or politics, I suppose.

 Dog from God urlLink Well this just scared the pants right off of me. I'm completely pants-less with fear. A man drove from the Maritimes with a carload of guns and ammunition, vowing to kill as many people in Toronto as he could ? before a last-minute encounter with a wandering dog inspired a change of heart. The New Brunswick man, in his 40s, surrendered to police yesterday afternoon in front of a supermarket at Leslie and Eastern Sts. He had a loaded gun in his pocket and a car crammed with more than 6,000 rounds of ammunition. "At that time, he decided he was going to shoot people in the area," said Detective Nick Ashley of 55 Division. "He attended a local park nearby and was preparing the weapons to do that." By chance, a dog approached the man and started playing with him in the Victoria Park Ave. and Queen St. E. park. "He happens to be a pet lover and decided that if there was such a nice dog in the area the people were too nice and he wasn't going to carry out his plan," Ashley said. His car, a red Subaru caked with mud, provided the testament. It was packed with doggie blankets, a big plastic dog dish still filled with dry kibble - and the biggest single arsenal Ashley had seen in his 17 years with the service. The car "was absolutely stuffed," he said. Stuffed with guns, ammunition and a self described crazy person. "He told me he was crazy and he needed to go to the hospital," the officer recalled. And, Douglas added, he had a loaded gun in his pocket. "He said, `I'm just going to drive around and kill people at random.'" Officers were tallying their cache last night at their Coxwell St. headquarters, counting carton after carton of bullets. The list included: a 12-gauge shotgun, a bolt action rifle with a telescopic lens, a 9-mm semiautomatic, a machete, throwing knife, camouflage ski mask, black leather gloves, and 6,296 rounds of ammunition. "He felt that if he shot enough people he would stay in custody permanently," Ashley said. "This could have been a very dangerous situation had his plan unfolded." "It's scary how close it could have been. We have a dog to thank somewhere." Thank Dog that dog was there. You know, I don't mean to get up on a soap-box here but, this really underscores the need for more.... I mean, it's obvious that something like this is going to happen when funding gets cut from... Clearly we should be putting more time and political effort into... Yeah. I don't know either. I mean...was this guy forcibly discharged from a maritime mental hospital, screaming about how he's going to drive to Toronto and kill a bunch of people? Were all of his guns registered with the Feds, and if so was there some indication in the database that he'd do something like this? There's an inevitability to an incident like the one we narrowly avoided. How on earth do you stop something like this before it happens? There's been mass shootings in the States that we look down our noses at (you know...because they have GUNS down there) and this one was going to rival any of those. San Diego McDonalds, New York Subway, Virginia Beltway, Toronto Beaches. How do you prevent someone unbalanced from inflicting terror on the rest of us? I've got a prize for the first letter to the editor claiming that the details of this story are proof that owners should be allowed to let their dogs run without leashes in Toronto parks. I've got another prize for the first letter to the editor who mentions that the dog was actually an angel, or perhaps Zeus, transformed to save us all. As grateful as I am for that dog, a mercifully benign coincidence is still a coincidence. Good boy. Come get your treat.

 Rumble in Riverdale I tried folks. I really tried. I got to Jimmy Simpson Arena at 6:30 for a 7:00 debate and the line stretched out the door, down the stairs and along Queen. By 6:45 it was clear that the line of constituents outside the building was not going to get inside for the Toronto-Danforth All-Candidate's debate. Cursing and whining from the frustrated residents was directed at the debate organizers, and eventually back at the crowd itself: "They're not letting the voters of this riding in!! There's party supporters in there and the people who can actually vote can't get a seat inside!! There's only one all-candidate's debate in this riding and we're not allowed in!! Hey, fire codes are fire codes. And besides, if you wanted more seating available then you should have organized a debate yourself. No one's rights were violated last night, and an event like that takes weeks of planning and lots of volunteer support. Those of us who couldn't get in, pulled up a speedbump or patch of municipally landscaped garden and sat outside, in the rain, and listened to the 2 hour debate on the loudspeakers that the organizers had provided. Past the initial frustration of not getting into the community centre auditorium (gym), spending a couple of hours in the rain with my fellow residents, people who really really wanted to hear what was being said, is something that I'll remember for a long time. Of the approximately 100 people outside (150 according to urlLink the Sun ), there were groups of party supporters (most of whom were using their lawn signs as rain cover), Mom-and-Pop citizenry, and cops. Cops. There were between 10-15 cops on site, 4 of whom were on horseback. By 9:00 when the debate culminated, the 2 squad cars parked across the street magically turned into 6 or 7 bearing officers sporting belts full of zip-tie protester-pacifiers. They were clearly ready for a riot in Riverdale. Eventually a familiar voice came over the speakers; Andy Barrie announced that he was moderating. He laid out the ground rules and announced the drawn order of speakers for the night: Jim Harris - Green Party (Leader) Marcell Rodden - Marxist-Leninist Party Loftus Cuddy - Conservative Party Jack Layton - New Democratic Party (Leader) Scott Yee - Marijuana Party Dennis Mills - Liberal Party (incumbent) The proceedings began with opening statements from the candidates. Most augmented their party's platforms with some statements relevant to the riding itself. Only Layton and Mills could describe public work they have already done in the Riverdale community. Layton spoke of his Council fights to keep schools open an close incinerators along the waterfront. Mills spoke about his opposition to Meech Lake back in the day, and lauded his party for setting up the "best fiscal framework in the G8". Among the questions for the evening, a couple of topics jumped out. Toronto-Danforth claims to have the 2nd largest population of gay and lesbian constituents in all of the federal ridings. As such the issue of same-sex marriage was raised not only at the debate last night, but at a Mills headquarters urlLink protest on Sunday afternoon . The questioner took Mills to task on his support of "traditional marriage" and asked the Liberal, Conservative and NDP candidates to outline their positions on same-sex marriage. Cuddy said that he, personally, was in favour of same-sex marriages but stressed that there are "arguments on both sides". In a cool little bit of spin he said that as a lawyer he's handled same-sex divorces and they are "equal in their awfulness" to traditional divorces. Layton reiterated his position that same-sex marriage is a human rights issue. Mills, on the other hand, supports the "traditional definition of marriage" but will support any decision that the House produces. Boos and cheers all around for all candidates on this one. I might as well throw in the most entertaining candidate of the evening at this point. Scott Yee, the Marijuana Party candidate doesn't exactly support same-sex marriage because he doesn't support marriage at all. He'd "rip up the Marriage" act because "What's next? Will we need a license to become friends too?" Breaking bold new ground man. On proportional representation and electoral reform Yee started working blue: "Why should I have to vote for him? I should get to vote for my own fucking Prime Minister!" Yee was talking reforms beyond the scope of my humble understanding, and was advised by one questioner to "not smoke that stuff before coming to the debate." OCAP's issue with Mills got the floor via a question about affordable housing and the Beatitude House on Gerrard. "Why did you lie? Why are you even running in this race? You promised to resign your seat if that house wasn't converted into affordable housing and you didn't." Mills explained that the process failed. He had all the approvals ready to go but the necessary permits couldn't be obtained in time. He also said that construction is going on down at the house right now. The explanation wasn't good enough for Marcell "Marxist-Leninist" Rodden, who interjected on top of the discussion, shouting that he was at that house when the promise was made, and...and... The moderator had to step in, calling for his mike to be cut. Mills concluded by wondering out loud why Layton didn't use his City Hall connections to help the process along. The debate drew to a close at 9:00 sharp and, similar to the cheers that start up around the first "We stand on guard for Thee", the partisan chants and shouts began as the Green leader was making his final statements. " urlLink Someday is now " was drowned out by the "Jack Jack Jack", "Den-nis Mills", and "Na na na, hey hey hey, Goood-bye" chants outside the Community Centre. This morning there's a urlLink few articles about urlLink the debate and, having seen Don Wanagas wander through the crowd pad in hand, there'll be another on in Thursday's urlLink Now . I got soaked, but I got soaked for democracy. I earned urlLink my pint last night.

 And for my own father... ...who is spending the weekend with mom in Niagara on the Lake, watching Pygmalion and drinking some wine, urlLink here's a treat for you: It's a song that is instantly identifiable by its opening chords, striking a chord in the hearts of millions of Canadians. In this CBC Television clip, Lightfoot performs the stirring Canadian Railroad Trilogy for the very first time. As the building of Canada's railroad is re-enacted behind him, Lightfoot strolls across the stage strumming his guitar while singing: "There was a time in this fair land when the railroad did not run / When the wild majestic mountains stood alone against the sun." With Lightfoot's trademark silky, soulful vocals and the help of an accompanying orchestra, the song builds to a brilliant crescendo as Lightfoot continues to tug on our heartstrings with this unmistakably Canadian narrative. "O'er the mountain tops we stand, all the world at our command / We have opened up the soil with our teardrops and our toil." I was in the St. Lawrence Market last weekend buying a marble rye and some chicken for dinner, when I heard an unmistakable voice. After gathering my change I turned to see a busker standing by the south east exit, guitar strapped around his body singing the Canadian Railroad Trilogy. He must have spent years making his voice sound like that; Lightfoot's vocal doppelganger: you can catch him by the Montreal bagel stand at the south end of the south building. I dropped a toonie into his guitar case and said "you sound just like him". He nodded a smile and kept singing. Happy Father's Day.

 On a much happier note I am glad to see that Kinsella urlLink is back . The last few weeks has been rough for him, but I know the support of his own family gave him the strength, and the context he needed to bring him through a difficult period. If anyone missed the final, moving words he wrote about his father, you can find urlLink them here .

 Why hasn't Jan Wong been arrested? urlLink Her column today in the Globe: How long would it take a someone with zero expertise to find child pornography on the Internet -- the same kind of images Mr. Briere said drove him to his crime? The answer: one hour and ten minutes. But those 70 minutes were a journey into depraved cyberspace that left me feeling nauseated. There you go. Jan Wong took it upon herself to locate some of child pornography that exists on the internet. Jan Wong, Globe and Mail columnist, sought out child pornography for a story she was writing. Remember when Pete Townsend did the same thing? Remember when Pete Townsend got arrested, got his computer confiscated and said that he was "doing research" because he was abused as a child? Remember when he got his name dragged through the mud for what he did? Can someone tell me why Jan Wong hasn't been arrested yet? In her column Jan says that it takes an hour and ten minutes for a self-described non-"technologically savvy" person to find some of the most disturbing images that men have ever created: One child stood innocently in a bathtub; others wore black garter belts or thongs that somehow fit their narrow hips. One girl looked as young as 4. Others were probably five or six years old. Some appeared to be about 10, the age when they lose their baby fat. You know Jan... I've never seen child porn. I've never wanted to see child porn. And I've certainly never gone looking specifically for child porn. But you have. Then a series of photos flashed on the screen that made us sick. It showed men raping little kids, including a little girl who couldn't be older than 4. I hadn't touched the keyboard or the mouse when another set of photos replaced them. They showed a pot-bellied white man, his face hidden, having sex with two scrawny Asian girls, perhaps five or six years old. In one photo, the little Asian girl appeared to be giving him oral sex. She was standing up, and didn't even come up to his navel. Another photo showed the other little girl, her wrists duct-taped to her ankles, being raped by the man. The expression on her face was vacant. She says that she passed the URLs onto the Toronto police. She says that this was an "assignment" that she was given. Put your hands up if you found Jan Wong's article helpful. Put your hands up if you previously didn't believe that child porn existed and could be easily obtained by someone who's willing to put an hour and ten minutes worth of effort into a search engine. Put your hands up if we should applaud Jan Wong for viewing child pornography in the name of journalism. You know Jan, I hear you can make a lot of money by selling crack to teenagers. You should do a story on that too.

 Rockin' with the Federal Leaders Well most of them. Not Gilles "The Right Honourable Buzz-Kill" Duceppe of course, but the four top english leaders. Puretracks.com, in a cool little urlLink PR project , polled Martin, Harper, Layton and Harris about their top 5 songs. We apparently urlLink get to vote on the playlists. Let's urlLink just review shall we? To qualify as "Canadian content" for the purpose of radio broadcasting Canadian content quotas, a musical selection must generally fulfill at least two of the following conditions: M (music): the music is composed entirely by a Canadian A (artist): the music is, or the lyrics are, performed principally by a Canadian P (production): the musical selection is: recorded wholly in Canada, or performed wholly in Canada and broadcast live in Canada. L (lyrics): the lyrics are written entirely by a Canadian. The MAPL system is used by both the CRTC to check Canadian content compliancy by licensees and as a basis for eligibility to the federal Sound Recording Development Program (SRDP). In general, 35% of the sound recordings played on a radio station between 6 a.m. and midnight must qualify as "Canadian content" as defined by the MAPL system. Ok? Harris: 1. Rascalz - "Top of the world" 2. Joni Mitchell - "Big Yellow Taxi" 3. BTO - "Taking Care of Business" 4. U2 - "Elevation" 5. Black Eyed Peas - "Where is the love" CanCon = 60% Harper: 1. ACDC - "Thunderstruck" 2. The Beatles - "I wanna hold your hand" 3. Johnny Cash - "Folsom Prison Blues" 4. Original Cast of Cats - "Mungojerrie And Rumpelteazer" (A favourite of Mr. Harper's children) 5. Duke Ellington & His Orchestra - "It Don't Mean A Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)" CanCon = 0% Layton: 1. Barenaked Ladies - "If I had a Million Dollars" 2. Barenaked Ladies - "Lovers in a Dangerous Time" 3. Joan Baez - "Blowin' in the Wind" 4. Buena Vista Social Club - Soundtrack 5. Barlow - "Married by Elvis" CanCon = 60% The other guy: 1. U2 - "Beautiful Day" 2. BTO - "Taking Care of Business" 3. Nana Mouskouri - "Moondance" 4. Simon and Garfunkel - "Bridge Over Troubled Water" 5. Diana Krall - "A Case of You" (Joni Mitchell cover) CanCon = 40% Harper, you Yankee-lovin' SOB. Not a single Canadian artist? Clearly going for the boomer/pensioner crowd with his selections he completely overlooked, and could have easily gone with The Guess Who, Neil Young and, I think most damning of all, Lightfoot. Johnny Cash I can respect but..."The Original Cast of Cats"? Jesus Tapdancing Christ. No Lightfoot, no Hayden, no Tragically Hip, no Constantines, no Weakerthans. Just a whole lot of Bono and Burton Cummings. You want "disaffected voter"? Here I am.

 Post-punk? Franz Ferdinand, Monday night at the Kool Haus. Were you there? No? I'm surprised because the place was packed, and we were sandwiched between polyester and tube tops. My god but it was a sweaty crowd. Toronto's urlLink Controller Controller opened the set at about 9:30 or so with a really great performance. My first time hearing them and I wanted to hear more right away. I even went looking for a CD long before they went on sale. My spot on the floor was more important then picking up a CD that I can find, if nowhere else, urlLink here . Vocals were a little self-conscious but that will pass. In the parking lot, I got a kick out of watching one of the guitarists slide a 26er of rum into his back pocket, pull his too-small jacket down over the bottle and walk in past security with his girlfriend tugging at the back of his jacket to keep the secret. Why he didn't just put the bottle in the case that he was carrying in one hand was beyond me. Rock star all the way. Ferdinand's Scotch opening band was " urlLink Sons and Daughters " (which must be a take urlLink on this ). Another pretty cool act. No show, just music. This would be a running theme of the night. Their album debuts in North America in August. "Three things: We're Sons and Daughters. We love you. We'd like to play you a song by Johnny Cash" Perfect opening. Franz Ferdinand took the stage after the biggest, meanest looking roadie I've ever seen finished preparing the stage. If you've never heard their sound I really encourage you to pick up their self-titled and give it a listen. Strokes without the drunken attitude and just a little bit gayer. A little bit: Michael, you're the boy with all the leather hips, sticky hair, sticky hips, stubble on my sticky lips. Michael you're the only one I'd ever want, only one I'd ever want, only one I'd ever want. Beautiful boys on a beautiful dancefloor, Michael you're dancing like a beautiful dance whore. Michael waiting on a silver platter now... and nothing matters now. These guys put on a great performance. Solid, polished and very very clean. It's been a long time since I've watched a band act as if they enjoy playing their music, and like being on stage. Their music you want to Russian dance. There's some very cool 50's and 60's brit-rock influence that bubbles through and, again, they enjoy being there. It's just something I like to see in a band. Between them and the 45 year old stoner who passed out and collapsed on the floor behind us, it was a great night.

 CalgaryGrit Tuesday's English Federal Leader's debate had 3 speaking formats; individual answers, one-on-one debates between leaders, and a free for all. Good on the CBC for mixing it up and not letting things get too out of hand. For the one-on-one urlLink Anna Maria Tremonti would pick two leaders and set them against each other. urlLink CalagryGrit has a pretty funny take on the Layton-Ducceppe pairings. urlLink Go here to read it.

 A decisive end First of all, thanks for urlLink pleading guilty to the crime that you committed. Secondly, have fun getting broomstick raped in prison. I think it will help you think about the terror and violation that you leveled upon an innocent girl before you choked her to death and dismembered her body.

 Garbage in the News Like most healthy, red-blooded, 27 year old guys living in Toronto I search through the online papers and Google news service every day for stories about urlLink Toronto garbage . Often it's local content from the red or blue boxes, but every so often our trash gets some international attention or mention in places other then Michigan. Like "Dallas Forth Worth" which, I am told, is a small island nation located off the coast of Tanzania. The Star-Telegram (a Dallas Forth Worth daily) recently urlLink ran a story about the success of some local private trash haulers who (you can gasp if you'd like) are making a living collecting garbage. GARBAGE TIME Local company turns hauling trash into treasure By J.G. Domke Special to the Star-Telegram Empty cartons, boxes, wrappers, paper towels, plastic cups. In today's disposable world, the amount of trash thrown out grows by 2 percent each year. That amounts to more than 5 pounds of trash a day for every man, woman and child in the United States. It's a problem for many, and an opportunity for a few: those who collect, haul and store the nation's trash account for $45 billion in revenue. And it's becoming more complicated. New laws protect the environment from toxic waste, causing 70 percent of landfills to close in the past decade. Toronto closed its landfill and now exports its trash to Minnesota, which wants the practice stopped. Toronto is working to recycle 100 percent of its trash by 2007. Beg pardon? I know Dallas Fort Worth is a long way away from our little town here, so we can forgive them for getting the some of the details wrong. I'm certainly not going to nit-pick but I'd like to set the record straight, should any of the island's inhabitants ever stumble across this page. Ahem The City of Toronto exports its trash to Michigan, not Minnesota. I get them confused too as a result of their similar "Mi" sounds. Toronto is working to recycle as much of its waste as possible, but we can't technically recycle 100% of our waste. The portion of waste that can't be recycled will have to be dealt with in "some other fashion" that no one has, of yet, determined. That little fact is easy to get wrong and to be frank, a lot of our local papers here get it wrong sometimes too. If we were to recycle 100% of our waste we would be, without question, the coolest, most awesomest city on the planet. Yeah Lisbon, I said it. What are you gonna do? Nothing, that's what. The goal for 100% waste diversion (our little term for 'not using landfills anymore') is actually 2010. You can read all about our urlLink goals here . The 2010 date is easy to remember because the 100% diversion date has been worked into the Toronto Solid Waste hotline: 416-338-2010. There you have it.

 Debate Aren't you supposed to attack the front-runner in a debate? Why are the loudest voices I'm hearing tonight coming from urlLink #2 and urlLink #3 in the polls? You know, urlLink the Notwithstanding Clause is one of the most potentially dangerous, contentious tools that the Canadian Government has in it's drawer. It provides parliament to overturn a supreme court decision and impose the will of a 3 or 4 year government on the Constitution or the Charter. Why is Stephen Harper talking about when he will and when he won't use the clause? I'm really torn here. I mean, I'd like to know if I'm going to help elect a guy who'll attempt to use the Notwithstanding Clause at the drop of a hat. I'd like to know the leader's position on using the Clause but if a party is talking about using it at THIS stage of the game and not after a Supreme Court decision or public debate, I'm really afraid of that kind of abuse of power. Waving the Notwithstanding Clause in front of the Supreme Court and in front of the issue and debate itself, regardless of the issue, is playing a dirty game with the Constitution. We've got a Supreme Court to interpret and answer questions that Parliament poses to it. If our new Prime Minister is going to flaunt this Clause to overturn their decisions, then why bother having a Court at all?

 Well? What do you think? I thought I'd spiff up the joint. Seems I lost my links on the side, but given enough time, booze and fitful, frustrated tears I'll get them back.

 Friends Gilles Duceppe to Paul Martin, on Martin's assertion that we maintain a 'good friend' relationship with the United States: Being a 'good friend' does not mean that you are kneeling in front of him. Right on Gilles.

 Walking Downtown Personal music is almost a necessity in a city. We've all seen the sanctimonious TTC riders who write into the Star and complain about the scary teenager beside them on the subway who plays his headphones too loud. "It's a violation of my personal rights, and besides, doesn't he know he's damaging his hearing?" Thanks, but I think what you really mean to say is "I'm not familiar with that music and I don't like it." The reason that scary teenagers and a growing number of suits, skirts, and assorted converts listen to music everywhere they go (via iPod, mp3 player or Discman), is to drown out the auditory madness that bumpers every step in the downtown core. The cars, the schizophrenic rantings, the political candidates; it's all too much. On mass transit in particular, it's a sanity-saving necessity to override the overly loud personal conversations about office politics, fashion and gynecology that weed their way into our heads. A pleasant side effect of personal music devices is that when music combines with the visual candy that a major city presents, the world suddenly turns into a music video. Skateborders glide through the air suspended by a guitar chord and landing on the one. Subways stop at the end of a track and accelerate into the next. The palsic walking beside you keeps the beat with his stilted gait. The world starts to gel around the music in your head. Play it on random.

 It's on. It's Mills vs. Layton, Red vs. Orange on urlLink Monday Night Debate Y'all... Toronto-Danforth candidates to square off at June 21 debate Federal NDP leader Jack Layton will be squaring off against MP Dennis Mills (Toronto-Danforth) in the first local all-candidates debate in the federal election June 21. The debate will take place at the Jimmie Simpson Recreation Centre, 870 Queen St. E. near Logan Avenue starting at 7 p.m. and it's being organized by a consortium of community service organizations working in the south end of the riding. Pablo Escobar, an outreach worker with the Woodgreen Community Centre, is working to develop an education package for disadvantaged voters living in south Riverdale's estimated 70 rooming houses. "What we've been doing is organizing an information package handed out door to door - registration and voting information," he said. "We'll be handing out information on the platforms of the various candidates, and on the all candidates meeting. It will be tailored to vulnerable populations." Campaign offices for Layton and Mills have both confirmed their candidates will be in attendance. Also running is Jim Harris of the Green Party, Scott Yee of the Marijuana Party and Marcel Rodden of the Marxist-Leninist party. Well, I'm marking on my calend... Wait. Pablo Escobar? It's probably not the same guy. But if it was, I'm sure he and Scott Yee would have to have some words about their competing products.

 Pure, unadulterated earnestness I must share this. Found on urlLink Something Awful as a link of the day. Kigurumi. Anyone? Anyone? A potential definition can be found here: urlLink In Japan, there is a form of theatre seen often at malls and parks called Kigurumi. Kigurumi shows usually promote different cartoons that are popular on television, by staging plays featuring the characters. The weird thing is that, rather than just have actors play the roles, they dress from head to toe in full costumes and enclosing masks so that they look "exactly" like the characters from the TV show. Kigurumi has a large adult fan-following, and a lot of fans dress up as Kigurumi on their own. It's even showing up in the states. It sure is. urlLink Yuri's Kigurmi Paradise . Yuri is a guy who dresses up as urlLink anime characters . Yuri explains: I first found out about kigurumi a little over 4 years ago. This was by finding some sites in Japan through I think the female mask page. urlLink http://www.maskon.com/marti/station.htm I was fascinated with the idea of doing masked cosplay. I had done cosplay before, like many others I was not satisfied. Why you ask, well I found most of the male anime characters to have plain uninteresting costumes. I have always thought the girls had the best and cutest outfits. With kigurumi I am able to fully bring to life the anime characters I play. One misconception is that you must be gay to dress as a girl. This is simply not true. I am certainly not gay. I am playing a anime character, and like doing any kind of acting it is a lot of work. It is also a lot of fun.

 Uh Did Greece win something today by any chance? Because it's as noisy as a post-soccer-victory, predominantly immigrant neighbourhood out on the Danforth right now. urlLink Oh. Opa!

 Ray Charles Aw man. We lost another good one. urlLink Ray Charles has died at 73 . I'm gonna go home and put "Georgia on My Mind" over and over tonight.

 Whither strategy? This is getting pretty wild. Martin called the June 28 election with no plan or strategy in mind? Do I have that right? I'm basing that on the fact that David Herle, Liberal campaign co-chair, said of the new Liberal attack ads " urlLink We are desperate ." Now, I'm no political strategist, but I think "We are desperate" is something that you really shouldn't say during a campaign....or ever . Liberal MP Carolyn " urlLink Damn Americans, I hate those bastards " Parrish wandered into the spotlight again yesterday when urlLink she told us all that "The [Liberal] campaign has been a comedy of errors. It was like the Keystone Kops running around". That's quite the damning assertion about her own party's strategy. I'm not even sure how a comment like that would do anything but help to condemn her own chances at re-election. Last Friday my girlfriend and I sat down to watch the Great Canadian urlLink Jorb Interview on Newsworld. Paul Martin and Jack Layton were the only Federal party leaders kind enough to show up to the youth sponsored event. After the event (and after being tipped off by Kinsella's blog), we remained tuned in long enough to see Kinsella as the urlLink Prince of Darkness . Thanks to urlLink Andrew Coyne for doing the screen captures. Kinsella was on the show to talk about spin and the art of politics. He's advised on strategy for a few election campaigns in the past (Federal, Provincial and some Municipal), and has a lot to say about what works and what doesn't in a campaign. Notably, sending cabinet ministers out in red t-shrits to harass Harper when he campaigned in Toronto a few weeks ago was something that "didn't work". He talked about spin and how a campaign is framed in the media. The host asked about the difference between lying and spinning and Kinsella said that you can never outright "lie" because that will come back to haunt you, but if you just phrase something in a way that's beneficial but still letter-of-the-law truthful it's fair game. I think another famous orator phrased this concept in a much clearer fashion: Jake: You lied to me. Elwood: It wasn't lies, it was just bullshit Kinsella has been kind of critical of the recent Liberal campaign, not only because of it's bits-and-pieces strategy, but because he's not involved in this one. When his successor David Herle comes public with "We are desperate", you have to wonder if the Martin's strategy of severing all ties with the Chretien-ites was good business. It's almost reminiscent of the Bush administration's knee-jerk severing of all things (and people) Clinton to try boost themselves up. It didn't exactly work for them (Tenet, Clarke, et al.), and it should serve as an example of "pick the best person for the job." and not just "the enemy of your enemy".

 Questions to no one Bloggers tend to watch their stats pages. Mainly these are our first pages, and more importantly, our first attempts at communicating individual thoughts broadly. It's vanity media (as urlLink Ikram Saeed has told us on many occasions), but gosh-darnit I'm still really interested in finding out how people come to my page. Google searches are the most popular, and since bloggers are prolific, and write on a variety of subjects, there's lots of text floating out there to clog up the Google engine. If memory serves, this is partially why Google bought out Blogger last year. All of that aside (we're getting closer to the funny here), I'm in awe of the variety of questions posed to the various search bars, which end up at my door step. Like this one, from sometime late last night, posed to the Yahoo search engine: urlLink how do i tell my wife i wear diapers I'm one for inflated back-stories, so I imagine a man, drunk at his computer at 1:54 am. He's clearly got a big secret. The kind of secret that he can't tell his buddies, can't tell his brother, and can't even tell his bartender. I figure he's tormented with this secret, because he didn't even use the concept of a search engine properly. He didn't search "+adult +diapers -fetish +medical +homecare" or "Depends FAQ spouse", he just laid it all out there to the only thing that would listen, but not judge: "how do i tell my wife i wear diapers". What's not clear, is whether he likes wearing diapers and doesn't know how to communicate his fetish to his loving spouse, or whether he's just learned that he has to wear diapers due to incontinence or post-surgery complications. It's also not clear if he's been wearing diapers for years and has somehow managed to keep this secret from the woman he shares a bed with every night. All we know is that he's tired of the secrets and lies, and wants to be frank with the woman who wears his ring. I'm sorry man, I just don't know on this one. But I hope you find your answer. She'll still love you man, she'll still love you.

 My spidey sense is tingling There's something besides smog in the air this morning. I haven't been downstairs since I got in this morning but...there's a CFRB live remote van parked out front... The chairs are being arranged in neat rows in front of the Nathan Phillips Square bandshell. Tables, sturdy enough to support information pamphlets, have been lined up and adorned with blue bunting. There's booths, and promotional tents being erected... I think it might be urlLink Old People Day at City Hall again. I'll check back in after lunch. Update: No old people per se, but definitely an old people friendly event. Also a CFRB friendly event... The banner above the bandshell in the square read "First Annual Crime Free Day". Ok so... Was it? I mean if I get shoved on the TTC on the ride home tonight what then? If a crime is committed today do we have to re-do the day until we get it right, like Groundhog Day?

 Street Furniture urlLink These things are going to look very cool. They won't work in every location, but they'll work in enough locations to raise the issue. According to the article: The new bins will be laden both with trash and high expectations. These novel contraptions will resemble large, broad slabs, standing well over two metres high and will be decked out with various compartments, advertising, perhaps even electronic tourist information. "It's a well-disguised garbage bin, which is a good thing as long as people know what it's for," says Toronto works committee chairwoman Jane Pitfield (Don Valley East). Later this month, the committee will get its first glimpse of the proposed redesign, intended to succeed those unloved and much-abused OMG Media boxes that have sprouted on sidewalks across Toronto over the past five years. Yeah, "much abused". Besides becoming impromptu billboards for every poster-plaster kid in the city, they've been clipped with snowplow blades, pried open by people looking for food, smacked into by unsuspecting cyclists (when the doors have been left open) and, like all garbage bins, been set on fire. Hell I've had to call 911 myself to put one out. In the curious lingo of waste management, works officials want this model to "capture" wads of gum and cigarette butts by providing special receptacles for each. There will be rubberized flaps instead of stainless steel ones, making it easier for pedestrians to shove refuse into the maw of the container without touching its disgusting surface -- a perennial complaint with the first generation of OMG bins. Instead of three holes, there will be two: one for run-of-the-mill garbage and a second for recyclables. But Angelos Bacopoulos, the city's general manager of waste management, says the bins can accommodate a third hole for "organics" -- banana peels, half-eaten sandwiches, etc. (Open-mouth garbage cans are going the way of the dodo because they attract insects, fill with water and invite the illicit dumping of large bags of junk.) Toronto was the first city in the world to offer its residents street-side garbage cans with recycling features. The attempt to equip this latest model with an organic option -- consistent with the thrust of household waste policy -- keeps the municipality on the cutting edge of urban trash. Hear that? There's a reason for all of these 3 compartment bins out there. Offering recycling in a public space isn't just to make us all feel fuzzy and granola, it's so we can get MONEY . urlLink Lots of money in fact. Some of which we've already got (ahem...saw the cheque with my own two peepers). This past week Stewardship Ontario made good on their side of the bargain and sent the first cheque as part of the WDO agreement. Manufacturers and First importers of products which end up in the municipal recycling stream ("blue box" and "gray box" in non-curious waste management lingo) have agreed to pay a portion of the costs of municipal recycling. The litter connection to all of this is that the recycling that we do on the street (i.e., those 3 compartment silver bins you see everywhere) counts towards the tonnages that we get money for. The more recycling we can show, the more money we get. Money is good, so keep up the good recycling work, yo.

 Young People and Voting urlLink Rachel Sa wrote a urlLink column in the Sun yesterday on a popular topic these days... "Lazy and ignorant: Why youth don't vote". From the column: I would like to defend my generation. I would like to think so few of us vote because we are frustrated with the election process. That our first-past-the-post electoral system, which distorts voter preference, rewards the large parties and punishes the small, turns us off voting. But that argument assumes that young people know enough about our electoral system to actually be frustrated by it. I doubt many do. That's a problem that goes beyond the 20-something set. Sadly, plenty of people out there don't even know the different levels of government we have or which one it is we're electing on June 28. No, I can't defend my generation on this one. We're not showing our discontent by refusing to vote. There's nothing political about it. If you're not going to vote, not even a protest vote to a fringe party, or a strategic vote against a candidate rather than for a candidate, then you're lazy. You're not hip or cool, or angry or disenfranchised. You're just lazy. And by sitting on your butt, you justify the actions of the political parties you complain ignore you. Can't argue there. Not voting comes from the same Avril Levigne school of being-pissed-off-for-no-reason-at-all logic. Flipping a middle finger to the Moms and Dads and SUVs and phoneys of the world is great and all, but when you don't have a point for doing it you're kind of a phony yourself? You're all angry and depressed, or pissed off at the Man, or...wait...where ever could we have learned this romanticized view of societal rejection...? urlLink Hmm. urlLink Hmm. urlLink Hmm. urlLink Hmm. The boomers respond to Sa's column in the red box today: RE RACHEL Sa's commentary, "Why youth don't vote" (June 3): Ah, yes, now we have the "young" as victims of politicians who lie and obfuscate, thereby giving them a right not to vote. We must "encourage" them to get interested -- gently, of course. Please. This is just another result of a generation brought up being "reasoned with" as toddlers having tantrums, "time outs" for bad behaviour and "inclusion" in adult conversations. Many, many young men and women died to give you your supercilious attitudes. It isn't your "right" to vote -- it is your duty. Fail to do it and your children may not have the opportunity. Get informed. Stop whining. Vote. N. Paul Beeton Right, because the only way to ensure that people vote when they're older is to beat the shit out of them when they're kids. Wait...."N" from Beeton.... This isn't urlLink Nancy is it? Dammit, I'm gonna take the bus up to Beeton and vote right there on her lawn just to piss her off. "N"'s final point is valid though. Voting is a duty, as is being remotely engaged in the political process. Being an expert on the subtle differences between which party's version of health care spending will have a greater impact on the Provinces, is not. Look. Old people vote on one or two issues (Fiberals, Gun registry, Insurance promises, Taxes) so why shouldn't we be granted the same liberty? Pick your issue and start small. Environment? US Relations? Unemployment? Then take a look a the party platforms. Which party falls more in line with what you want to happen? Now pick another issue... Does that same party offer something you want? I've got to get back to the job that I'm apparently too lazy to have, hold, or find, so we'll do more on this later. I'll leave you with one more jackass from the Sun: RE RACHEL Sa's commentary on why the younger generation doesn't vote (June 3): She has the answer right there in her article but only vaguely identifies it. The real reason why Canadians from 18 to as old as 35 don't vote is because too many of them still live at home with mom and dad. Property taxes on the rise? Doesn't affect me, mom and dad pay! Car insurance and the cost of gas increasing? Doesn't affect me, mom and dad pay! The list goes on. If anyone is responsible for today's governing disasters, blame the boomer generation for allowing their children to slack off! Cut the apron strings, and do us voting taxpayers a favour! Chris Varadinek Toronto (Today, those apron strings are made of elastic) Hey Avril, if you want to flip someone off, flip off Chris Varadinek from Toronto. He actually deserves it.

 Boy Collapses at Spelling Bee, Nails Word These kids are too smart/dramatic for their own good. I've yet to see "Spellbound" but I have watched more then a few riveting hours of coverage of the National Spelling Bee finals on TSN. My parents spent an afternoon wondering exactly what kind of children they raised as my brother and I watched the repeat of the finals, at home last Christmas. Also, I love it when urlLink the AP reads like urlLink The Onion . WASHINGTON - The National Spelling Bee took a scary turn Thursday when a 13-year-old Colorado boy appeared to faint and collapsed on stage, drawing gasps from an audience packed in for the finals. Akshay Buddiga gathered himself after a few seconds, stood up and, to the amazement of the judges, immediately started spelling his word: "alopecoid." He got it perfectly, drawing a standing ovation. Akshay went back to his chair, looking uncomfortable, when a Bee employee came to escort him off stage. He received medical help and was expected to return. For the record: Alopecoid.

A vote in the June 28 election is up for urlLink grabs on eBay : I respect democracy but I am protesting the $1.75 "poll" tax that the politicians in Canada are collecting when I vote in this upcoming election. They have stolen enough money from taxpayers and I am asking that they pay me $1.50 minimum for my vote. They collect $1.75 so both parties benefit. If you send me a cheque I will vote for your political party in my riding. The Bloc Quebecois are disqualified because they are not running a candidate in my riding.

 The Believer ( urlLink The Magazine published by urlLink McSweeneys every month). This month is the " urlLink Music Issue " and either the free CD included this month or the growing popularity of this periodical meant that I had my choice between only two remaining copies on the shelf, as opposed to the 30 or so that I usually find.

 Some memory hole work Richard Perle is a former head of the US defense policy board, former member of the " urlLink Project for the New American Century ", and general neo-con extraordinaire was interviewed last week on the BBC: Perle: I understand the obsession in the United Kingdom with weapons of mass destruction. Interviewer: You say "obsession with weapons of mass destruction in the United Kingdom". Wasn't that the reason we went to war? Perle: I..I happen to believe that the liberation of 25 million Iraqis from the one of the most brutal and sadistic regimes in modern times was a very good reason for removing Saddam Hussein. Interviewer: But that wasn't the reason we were given, was it? Perle: Well it was among the reasons that were given. It was actually a more prominent reason in this country then in the United Kingdom. urlLink Richard Perle pre-invasion of Iraq: Preemption "Let me say a word about what you call the new strategy of preemption. There's nothing new about preemption. If you know that you are about to be attacked, it is certainly sensible if you can act first and avoid that attack to do so. I don't think anybody would dispute that. So then the question is how imminent must the attack be to justify the preemptive response. Here, we need to think more carefully about the concept of imminence. In 1981, the Israelis, after a long and, I gather, a heated cabinet debate, decided to destroy the reactor that Chirac had sent to Osirak, not because it was about to produce nuclear weapons. It wasn't. It was about to produce plutonium and it was under IAEA safeguards so the Iraqis would have had to siphon off small, undetectable quantities of plutonium and it would have taken them time to build a nuclear weapon based on what they would get from the Osirak reactor. But, nevertheless, the Israelis decided to strike some years in advance of the production of the nuclear weapon that they were concerned about. "Now, why did they do that? They did it because the Iraqis were about to load fuel into the reactor and once they did so, they would not have had an opportunity to use an air strike without doing a lot of unintended damage around the facility, because radioactive material would have been released into the atmosphere. So from an Israeli point of view, what was imminent and what had to be acted against in a preemptive manner was not the ultimate emergence of the threat but an event that would lead inexorably to the ultimate emergence of the threat. They had to deal with a threshold that once crossed, they would no longer have the military option that could be effective at that moment. If we think of imminence in that sense, if we think of it as the thresholds that once crossed will so worsen our situation that we can't allow those thresholds to be crossed, then you start looking at how far are they from achieving the means to do the thing that everyone would recognize we were justified in stopping at the moment that action was taken. In the case of Iraq, we're talking about stopping the further development of nuclear weapons, we're talking about new systems of delivery for the chemical and biological weapons Saddam already has, including systems with much longer range. What is imminent about Iraq and what may be imminent in some other situations requires you to look back and decide when a threat becomes unmanageable ." urlLink Further from February 12 on PBS NewsHour: Perle: But let's just agree that Saddam has had those weapons and he is perfectly capable of transferring them to al-Qaida. Perle: You know, crown jewels were the jewels in the crown, and you don't give them away because you're giving the crown away, but Saddam has lots of crown jewels, plenty for himself and to distribute to others if he chooses to do so. And the only point I want to make is that as long as Saddam is there, with everything we know about Saddam, as long as he possesses the weapons that we know he possesses, there is a threat, and I believe it's imminent because he could choose at any time to take an action we all very much hope he won't take. Don't you go to hell for this stuff? Got much of this from urlLink Le Show this week. To listen to the Perle section of the show urlLink click here (Real Audio).

 Photography I'm one of those guys who carries a digital camera around with me all the time. Problem is that I've not been savvy/engaged enough to figure out how to share my snaps with y'all. Lucky for us, Dennis Mills' campaign/non-campaign signs provided the impetus for me to find a photo hosting site. As such I've got hundreds of pictures just begging to be shown off to friends and serendipitous Google-searchers alike. The following two offerings clear up a bit of unfinished business. This is the infamous Coffee Time at the corner of Nightmare Ave. and BadTouch St. where I saw the urlLink midnight clown .

 Woman arrested for eating a candy bar From urlLink the story : WASHINGTON - A government scientist finishing a candy bar on her way into a subway station where eating is prohibited was arrested, handcuffed and detained for three hours by transit police. Stephanie Willett said she was eating a PayDay bar on an escalator descending into a station July 16 when an officer warned her to finish it before entering the station. Both Willett and police agree that she nodded and put the last bit into her mouth before throwing the wrapper into a trash can. ... "If she had stopped eating, it would have been the end of it and if she had just stopped for the issuance of a citation, she never would have been locked up," Transit Police Chief Polly Hanson said Thursday. Metrorail has been criticized in the past for heavy-handed enforcement of the eating ban. In 2000, a police officer handcuffed a 12-year-old girl for eating a french fry on a subway platform. Hey, that's the law right? And laws are made for a reason, right? This isn't a terrorism piece, but I'm sure that it's connected to the general insanity of arresting someone for eating in a city's subway system. Let's look at this from a "This City Needs to Get Tough on Litterers" angle. The ultra-clean city of Singapore got it's spanky reputation by enforcing littering laws in a similar manner to what's mentioned in this story. Hefty fines for little annoyances makes those little annoyances go away, right? I mean, this woman will think twice before she eats another PayDay in the Washinton subway system... Probably not. She might expose the lunacy of the law which lead to her arrest. She might sue the transit police for exceeding their authority and needlessly detaining her for three hours based on a chocolate fix, a snarky comment and a brisk walk away from a transit cop. She might do what people in a free-er society (Washington DC. vs. Singapore let's say) would do, and explain how the law doesn't apply in her situation. She'd probably win too, because I doubt that any reasonable system would equate "eating in the subway" or even "being an ass about it" with "being detained for three hours". Let's ride the subway back up to our town here. Listen carefully during the spring litter whining season around here, or to those who cry that "more bylaw officers" are the best way to curb the litter problem in this city. Is this really what we want? The Washington transit system implemented their "no eating" policy for a reason, and they've chosen to enforce it with a heavy hand, again, for a reason. Whether it be for cleanliness of the system, accident avoidance, or national security, they've chosen to enforce this "little law". I'd look forward to a slate of stories just like this one if our City ever decides to start "cracking down" on litter. TORONTO - A 78 year old grandmother was handcuffed to a park bench for an hour in the hot sun yesterday, while bylaw officers waited for police to arrive. "We told her to pick up her coffee cup and she told us that she's been paying taxes for 50 years, and that she has a bad back." said SWM bylaw officer Kent Walker. "We have these laws for a reason and this woman was witnessed committing an offence by myself and my partner, we're only doing our job". The woman's family is outraged at City officials. Her daughter demanded an explaination from the Mayor. "The real litter problem in this city comes from those punk teenagers over at the highschools, and hanging out in front of the convenience stores. Why don't you go arrest them and stop picking on little old ladies!?" Yeah, I don't think the Onion will be calling anytime soon either.

 A cartoon cat From the letters to the red box this morning: I WISH to send my condolences to Lennie Peterson, creator of the comic strip The Big Picture, in the death of Ginger (July 23). She was a fine feline member of the comics page of the Sun and other publications. The Big Picture is a strip that will live through the ages as it is truly about life! God bless Ginger.

 Deep Throat....? Fred LaRue, former special assistant to Nixon's attorney general John Mitchell, urlLink died yesterday . LaRue was one of the prime candidates for the true identity of Bob Woodward's Watergate source "Deep Throat". If I'm not mistaken, the chief evidence points to the fact that Deep Throat gave details about a meeting at which only Nixon, Mitchell and LaRue were present. As the legend goes, there's only 4 people who know the true identity of Deep Throat: Bob Woodward, Carl Burnstein, former Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee and, of course, Deep Throat himself. Woodstein have said that the only time the will reveal their source is when Deep Throat dies, or reveals his identity himself. The only clues they've given is that Deep Throat is still alive (i.e., they haven't revealed his name yet) and that Deep Throat is a single person, not a composite of sources, as Fred LaRue once suggested. If LaRue was indeed the infamous Deep Throat, we should expect an announcement from Bob Woodward and Carl Burnstein within the next couple of days, but if not, it's just another one off the list. Me? My money is on former Nixon staffer Patrick J. Buchanan who appeared completely loyal to Nixon right through the entire scandal and was quoted by Woodward as urlLink saying : "The Watergate's all you had. Some Cubans going in to look at Larry O'Brien's mail. ... You blew it out of all proportion." After Williams replied that they had won the 1972 election in a "dirty" manner, Buchanan answered "A little spying, Ed. That's politics." Sure Pat. I know your righteous Christian conscious got the better of you back in '72, and you had to spill your guts to somebody about all the naughty things you saw the bad men doing. Now all we have to do is wait for Pat Buchanan to die and we're all set. To learn more about the Watergate scandal, visit your local library. Or just click urlLink here .

 The Sun Gets it Wrong Again You know I really wonder about the Sun sometimes. Here's a story in urlLink today's paper : Baring all for Canada FOREIGN STRIPPERS MUST SUPPLY NUDE STAGE PHOTOS TO OFFICIALS IMMIGRATION OFFICERS are having to pore through naked pictures of hundreds of exotic dancers to keep impostors out of Canada. Foreign strippers planning to table dance in clubs here must now provide photos of themselves with no clothes on to qualify for a visa for Canada, immigration officials say. "Stage photos during performances are required," said Sergio Mercado, of the Canadian Embassy in Mexico. In a memo to fellow visa officers around the world, Mercado said if a dancer passes the no-clothes test, they may then require a police certificate or medical examination. The memo was obtained from access to information documents obtained by the Sun. The potential dancers have to prove they can dance in the nude, immigration lawyer Mendel Green said yesterday. "They can't be partially nude," he said. "If they don't have pictures in the nude, they are not going to wiggle their bottoms in Canada." Immigration lawyer Richard Kurland said the women have to show nude pictures to ensure they're not abusing the system. When it comes to Russia, the visa officers are looking for "headline performers" who can be paid up to $5,000 weekly and are often featured in ads of which they are expected to have copies. Officers at the Canadian Embassy in Moscow said most headliners have been subject of photo spreads after vying for "Miss Nude North America or Miss Nude Europe" contests. Immigration officer Dorothy Christie said once dancers arrive here they are usually placed in strip club lodgings and paid $60 every time they're on stage, $10 for a lapdance and $20 for a VIP room lapdance. Each week the women must pay $100 to an agent and $50 for a driver as well as $10 nightly to a DJ, the officer said. There they go again. They always going for the sensational story. They're always going for the sensational spin. I mean, if a dog is run over by a car on Jarvis, the Sun will probably interview the two prostitutes who watched it happen from the sidewalk. If it's a toss up between a spelling bee and a park flasher, they'll cover the pervert every time. Jesus guys... I mean we ALL have to supply a nude photo when applying for a job in Ontario; not just the strippers. It's a part of regular human resources policy, and a reality of finding work in this day and age. Hell I couldn't even join the union until I supplied at least a 10 shot portfolio to the proper officials. But there's the Sun, always covering the "stripper" or "bikini" end of things just so they can make another 50 cents. Lowest common denominator I tell you. They should be ashamed.

 It's better then slander. It's better then lies. When Lulu's (formerlly home to the world's longest bar) shut down in Kitchener a few years back I really felt bad for Kim Mitchell. Every time I passed by the place, his name was somewhere on the "Comming Soon" marquee. Well, him and April Wine, anyway. The Mighty Q (and CanCon requirements) has always been Toronto's source for mucho Mitchell, and now we can listen to him promote contests and introduce songs, drivetime weekdays 2 til 7. From urlLink the Star : Mitchell was in the studio as morning host John Derringer announced the news and he told listeners he's excited about the possibilities. He'll be heard weekdays between 2 p.m. and 7 live from the studio at the Hard Rock Caf, by Dundas Square. The station plans to celebrate his arrival with a special edition of their monthly "Breakfast With Derringer" live broadcast on Aug. 27. "I'm looking forward to bringing my experience as a musician, artist and entertainer to the microphone at Q107," Mitchell says on the station's website. "I am rocked and ready, let's go!" As are we Kim. Hopefully Kim will be with us here in Toronto until he's finally headlining at that gig in the sky.

 A triumphant return Not me, urlLink him . While lazing about and reading this past week, I got reaquainted with an old friend named CBC radio. They've been doing some urlLink test marketing this summer, and one of their weekend offerings is urlLink Sunny Day's and Nights . Sunny Day's, urlLink CBNR 's long running show, was formerly hosted by the "still-at-large" Frank "Sunny" Day, and is currently being manned by the legendary Paul Moth during Frank's sudden and, if the RCMP gets their druthers, permament absence. I was a huge fan of Paul Moth's broadcasts when the CBC picked up "The Great Eastern" from the BCN (Broadcasting Corporation of Newfoundland) back in 94'-'99. Hell, I even won a contest by suggesting a tattoo that Moth later had misspelled on his arm: urlLink Thinks To Do . Memories. I still have the T-shirt. Like yours truly, and every other 14 year old girl on this planet, urlLink Paul Moth has a blog . A companion to the show and to the legend that is his life.

 Fox and the Navigator There's a urlLink comment piece in the globe today from Rudyard Griffiths of the Dominion Institute. He's referring to a poll conducted by Navigator a few weeks back which included, among other things, a section about how young Canadians describe the US. The results showed that 40% of those polled would describe America as an "evil" influence in the world. From the urlLink Citizen's take on the poll: In a telephone poll of 500 teens aged 14 to 18, more than 40 per cent of respondents saw the U.S. as an evil global force. Among French-Canadians, that number jumped to 64 per cent. Ontario proved the most conflicted on the issue; there, nearly one-fifth of youth were on the fence. "Teens have taken (Ronald) Reagan's concept of the Soviet Union as an evil empire and turned it back on the U.S.," says Rudyard Griffiths, director of the Dominion Institute. "Clearly, the anti-American sentiment isn't just something coming from 30-somethings or even 20-somethings." Jump ahead a few weeks and a few kilometers south to Fox News and Bill O'Reilly. Griffiths describes the infamous Fox commentator's reaction to our America-hating youth: I suspect [O'Reilly's] producers have Google news alerts set up with the key words "Canada," "socialism," "draft dodgers" and "anti-Americanism." On his show, Mr. O'Reilly used the single survey statistic to let loose on Canada's political leaders, the media and our "ignorant teens." One of his choicer utterances included: "The truth is that the USA has freed more human beings in 230 years than the rest of the world combined. France has freed almost no one. Ditto Canada. . . . I object to the anti-American foreign press and bums like Chirac in France and Chrtien in Canada." Sorry, but didn't our Governor-General and President George W. Bush just commemorate the 60th anniversary of D-Day together in France? Last time I looked, we fought alongside the Americans in Korea, during the long grind of the Cold War and served with distinction in Bosnia and Afghanistan. And by the way, we have had a new Prime Minister for seven months and his name is Paul Martin. There's a lot of reasons to dislike America's foreign policy these days, and honestly, that's about the only thing that we Canadians are really allowed to comment on with any seriousness. It's easy for us to fall into the trap of criticizing the State's domestic policy (e.g., same-sex marriage ban, cutting Veteren's benefits, the declining quality of their school system, seemingly institutionalized racism, etc.) but really we have no business there. It's not our country and if they want to live like that then it's their right. Right? But when it comes to foreign policy; when it comes to how America, the biggest, toughest kid on the block, behaves in the school yard, then yes, we can comment. We can have opinions and we can voice them. We can dissent without fear of being labeled un-patriotic or un-American; a luxury that our American friends don't seem to have these days. In fact, It's been argued that being "un-American" is about the only thing that Canadians agree that we are as a nation. Our ever changing, ever searching self-identity is first and foremost Not-American. What does it mean to be Canadian? "Well, it means that we are... We are all very... Maple syrup and um... The French are in there too... Well we're not American, that's for darn sure." Griffiths continues on Fox: Three days after our poll appeared in the Drudge Report, I got the opportunity to go on Fox News to try to do some damage control. It was an interesting lesson in talking to the prickly and standoffish America that Fox News proudly champions. The show was aptly named Heartland, and its host was the combative former Republican congressman John Kasich. Right from Mr. Kasich's first question as to whether Vietnam draft dodgers had taken over our education system, I knew I was in for an uphill struggle. I tried to explain that Canadian teens were no different than American teens. They wear Nike shoes, listen to U.S. popular music and most likely know as much about U.S. history as their own. My conciliatory tone didn't satisfy the former congressman. What about the press? Is the same liberal media cabal that banned Fox News from Canadian airwaves responsible for our teens' anti-Americanism? My five minutes flew by and I felt I was failing miserably to counteract the stereotype that all Canadians are Yankee-haters. Have Vietnam draft-dodgers have taken over your educational system? That was really a question? Wow. The urlLink Heartland website contains only this line: Does a good amount of Canada's youth think the U.S. is evil? Don't miss this! But since we can't watch Fox news up here, I guess we'll have to wait for the transcript... Wait..."Does a good amount of Canada's youth think the U.S. is evil?" Could we get one of those draft-dodging english teachers to take a look at that sentence please? Thanks.

 My Spidey-sense is tingling. As are the tips of my fingers. New York bans the distribution of mercury batteries in toys and novelties because of the likelihood that those items are improperly disposed of (i.e. in a landfill). From the urlLink Star this morning : Caught in a web of criticism over a Spider-Man toy found in cereal boxes, Kellogg Co. announced yesterday it will never again use mercury batteries in its promotions. .. Kellogg's spokesperson Celeste Clark said that while the toy meets federal safety standards "and has no effect on the quality or safety of the food, we are taking this action to go beyond what is required by law to address an issue important to our consumers and the environment." Battle Creek, Mich.-based Kellogg's put the toys into boxes of many of its sugared cereals, separated from the cereal in a plastic pouch. The toys project a spider, a web or a rendering of the villainous Dr. Octopus on to a wall. The boxes also advertised a separate mail-in promotion on the front panel for a Spider-Man wristwatch toy. Anyone selling theirs on eBay? Because those do sound pretty cool. If I get one I'll promise to dispose of the battery properly. I suppose we're a far cry from the sugar-cereal of our fathers, where die-cast soldiers and cars made of lead were dropped into specially marked packages. Mmm...Debilitating.

 And then? My office blew up. Now..I'm not usually one for zombie movies, but there was one that was following me around the city a few months back. A movie, that is, not a zombie. There were some scenes shot here at work last fall, and along the Danforth where I live. The production closed the viaduct bridge for a few nights, and I went out to be a lookie-loo with the rest of my neighbours. There were helicopters, there were black SUVs there were explosions, there was some guy in a wheelchair, and there was Milla Jovovich. It's all here in urlLink this pamphlet . Well I just saw the trailer for the upcoming urlLink Resident Evil: Apocalypse , and boy howdy do I ever love watching my work explode over and over. Rockets shoot through the sky, helicopters congregate in the square, the Nemesis wanders around town with a great big gun and shit blows up real good. Also urlLink this woman runs straight down the side of the west tower of City Hall. Runs. Down it. Like Batman, only down. And running. Here. urlLink Watch it for yourself . Yeah, I'll be there opening night. You'll know we're in the same theatre because I'll be the one giggling when council chambers explodes.

 W Ketchup My brother sent me urlLink this one , and I'm sure it's making the rounds out there. From the urlLink FAQs : What does the "W" stand for? The "W" stands for "Washington" Oh I get it.... ...Because if you use Heinz Ketchup you're supporting John Kerry's wife's trust-fund or something? Well that's just un-American. Not like W Ketchup though... What percent of W Ketchup is made in America? 100%. Every ingredient is American. Yeah, but the bottles are probably made by child labour in Taiwan...Heh heh heh... 100% American? What about your bottles? Yes, every bottle is made in America, every label is printed in America, and every step of the manufacturing process takes place in America. Oooohhh!!! Damn you W Ketchup! Is there no path around your carefully erected logical barriers? But wait... I thought Heinz was an urlLink American success story , building their empire through successful and honest American business practices, coupled with hard work and stick-to-it-iveness: The first product was horseradish, and the glass of its bottle was clear. There was a reason: while competitors extended their horseradish with fillers, concealed from view in green glass jars, Founder Henry John Heinz took his stand on quality and proudly displayed his product in transparent bottles. See? No leaves, no wood fiber, no turnip filler. Can W Ketchup say that they don't have turnip filler? What are the ingredients? W Ketchup contains: Tomato Concentrate (Water and Tomato Paste), High Fructose Corn Syrup, Corn Syrup, Vinegar, Salt, Dehydrated Onion, Spice and Natural Flavoring. Aaarrggghhhh!!!! Curses, I've been foiled once again by W Ketchup, with its relentless pursuit of truth and freedom! You've anticipated my every criticism, and bested me in a match of wits. I tip my hat to you, W Ketchup, and declare you "America's Ketchup" or "Liberty Ketchup" or whatever works best for you. The message is clear, American's want a choice in Ketchup. When the Ketchup that Americans have always used, turns out to be manufactured by a company owned by the wife of a presidential candidate, it becomes sour and inedible. Heinz Ketchup has betrayed America, and as such W Ketchup must rise to defend freedom. And priced modestly at $3.00 a bottle (minimum 4 bottle purchase, plus shipping), it will soon become the Ketchup that REAL Americans are willing to wait for, and then go and pick up at the post office.

 Hey! Why is my pay so low? On my pay stub this week: BEGINNING JULY 1, THE NEW ONTARIO HEALTH PREMIUM IS BEING DEDUCTED FROM YOUR PAY. IT IS INCLUDED IN THE TAX DEDUCTION AND IS BASED ON YOUR TAXABLE INCOME. Best..uh.."Amount-based-on-my-taxable-income" I ever spent. You know something? The health premium that I'm paying is about half of what I pay for union dues every two weeks. So basically I'm a heath care premium, plus a double health care premium to have someone sit and write a letter to Dalton McGuinty to complain about the new health care premiums. It got me thinking: I spent 2 health care premiums on dinner and beer the other night. I spent almost 8 health care premiums a month on digital cable and internet. I paid just over one health care premium on a magazine subscription to Toronto Life last year. I hear companionship is going for around 5 or 6 health care premiums on Jarvis St. Yeah yeah, but he said he wouldn't raise taxes. He broke his promise he broke....FIBERALS!!!! He's a PHONY!!! A BIG FAT PHONY!!!!!! Tell you what. I'll pay my health care premium without complaining, just as long as everyone who uses or makes money off the system pays into it too.

 Roger Moore's Son Next Bond? That was one of the urlLink stories on urlLink Borque this morning. I think that's great. I mean, you get the tradition of an established, successful Bond, who can really carry the role forward. I've never seen this guy "act" exactly, in the traditional sense. I mean, he's got his little stunts and street performances, but he's probably been studying acting or something between his other films. I'm not sure how I'm going to feel about a really politicized Bond movie though. Maybe Bush will be the super villain and, I guess, Susan Sarandon will be the Bond Girl? She might not be as hot as Shirley Eaton or Jill St. John, but she's got a sassy down-to-earth honesty and charm that will really bring something to the role. I'm sure she'll balance with this new Bond, while they fight to discredit Tony Blair's assertions that Iraq tried to buy yellow cake from Niger. I just can't imagine the two of them in bed though. I hope they'll cut that part out. Damn, I just don't know how he's going to fit into that Aston Martin. I think they'll have to have one specially made. I've paid for all the other ones so I'm going to pay to see this one too. Maybe I'll bring a book or something.

 Shades of Green I keep my eyes to the ground out of force of habit. Normally I'm looking for examples of garbage and other things that make their way onto the sidewalks and gutters of our little burg. A pile of cigarette butts in the middle of Dundas St clearly emptied in while someone was waiting at a red light, a raw pork shoulder gathering flys by the curb on Elizabeth, a pair of chopsticks across a storm sewer grate with no restaurant in sight.... It's pretty interesting stuff, this crap that doesn't interest us anymore. I was around Yonge and Dundas when I first noticed the shades of green. At the North West corner of the square (kitty corner to the Gap) there are adjacent sections of the concrete sidewalk which have been painted two shades of green. One is a light, lime green and the other is a darker blue-green...like a teal I guess. The really strange thing is that the concrete is painted with an eye to detail. Only the two sections of the sidewalk are painted, and one colour doesn't bleed over into the other. Initially I thought the painting might have been left over from an event in the square until I noticed two concrete barriers, side by side, painted the exact same shades of green, on the south side of Dundas, just west of the Eaton Centre parking garage. If you want to check them out, you'd better hurry, because hoarding is already going up along that stretch of Dundas for the garage construction. It must be a pattern right? I mean the two examples of this are 1/2 a block away from each other. A statement? A path to follow? If you put your left foot on one shade and right foot on the other, which way do you face? What if your feet are reversed? Well it sure seems like a pattern. There is a 3rd example of the side-by-side green concrete close to where I work. There's a concrete path which leads from Nathan Phillip Square to the side of Osgoode Hall. If you start at the statue of Winston Churchill and walk north across the grass, you'll almost walk right across them. Once again, the same colours, on adjacent concrete sections of sidewalk, painted with care. I've only noticed the 3 examples of the green, and I'm looking for more. Check them out and let me know if you've seen other seemingly random sidewalk paintings. Not the growing trend of painted sidewalk advertising from Monster.ca and Much Music (which seems to be drawing significantly less public ire then another urlLink infamous proposal for public space advertising), but more of the green-on-green sidewalk paintings. Oh and the trees and flowers are beautiful I'm sure, but they're more for the tourists... Me? I like concrete. Oh, and just one more thing Ma'am : Yeah, I've noticed the colours of this page, and while similar they aren't the same as the pretty concrete. No it's not me doing the painting. I was never a stay-inside-the-lines kind of kid, and doubt I could pull off such an artistic job...without the use of masking tape and a crew from one of those design shows, anyway.

 Let me tell you a little story It's about this place, here, where I work every day. It's lunchtime now, so I've got a few minutes to share a frustration with no one in particular. It's 1:30 now, and I haven't had any access to my email since I got here this morning. Your post office is unavailable. Please contact your system administrator. The guy at the IT helpdesk told me that "yes, there are some problems with one of the post offices in your department, but they haven't given us an estimated uptime yet. Maybe noon?" Great. Thanks. Now I complained to a few colleagues who were fortunate enough to be on a different post office. They laughed, slapped my back and said things like "Boy a young guy like you must not know what to do when his email goes down! Heh, what did we ever do in the day's before computers eh? You'll probably have to pick up a phone or something!" Yeah...the phone. Imagine if the phones went down, but the email stayed up. Imagine the cries and wails to supervisors and managers from frustrated workers who want to go home because something as basic as "a phone" isn't working in the office. Imagine how quickly the problem would be addressed, and how much pressure would be applied to the proper department to get it done. "Email? Yeah, I get emails, but my secretary opens them, and prints them out for me. I can't figure out any of that computer mumbo-jumbo, and frankly I'll be happy when the whole fad blows over in a couple of years. Just give me a sturdy #2 HB pencil and I'm ready for the day." In the time that I've been working (for whatever organization I'm working for...) we've had a number of email outages. The most common kind around here seems to be when someone decides to send an email to every one of the 10,000 email addresses in the book. In one instance, someone attached a word document containing a description of a house for sale and hit send, hoping to drum up some real-estate interest in St. Catherine's. That act alone should have been enough to: a) restrict access to the group distribution lists in the address book; and b) initiate a disciplinary review, or at least a return to public stockading. Not only have variations of the incident occured a few times since, there's been virtually no action taken save a few reminder emails from IT about "vacation rules" and "forwarding mail to outside accounts". To add insult to the "Subj: House for Sale"-injury, was the fact that hundreds of employees who were on vacation at the time decided to set their automatic-replys...to all. Since everyone was privy to the initial email, all of the reply-to-all'ers out there started replying to each other, and to the rest of us. I opened up my inbox one morning to find thousands of messages. The backlog crippled the email for a few days afterwards, until the messages could be dumped, and another message was sent out reminding employees to not "set their vacation rules to 'reply to all' as it generates hundreds of irrelevant mailings". But that couldn't possibly apply to me.... I mean, when my cousin sends out her "Fwd:Fwd:Re:Fwd: MORNING GIGGLE!!!!" to all of our friends, I want them all to know that I'm on vacation...right? Well I have a funny feeling that someone's email privileges should be suspended and replaced by a #2 HB pencil for a few months. Because if I find out that a power point presentation featuring sad kittens is responsible for this, I'm going to kick some ignorant asshole back to the 70's. Wow. Look at that. Still no email.

 Remember when? Remember when it was Un-American to question the assertions that Iraq had WMD? Remember when the Yanks were told to stand behind their leader, no matter what? Remember when Bush said "He has them, we know he does"? Well it was all wrong. Wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong. And thousands of Iraqis are dead because of it, and as of today at least urlLink 1,000 American troops are dead because of it. urlLink Because of what ? A "global intelligence failure". A "group think" dynamic. Oh, and an Iraqi defector code-named "Curve Ball". From urlLink one story : WASHINGTON (AP) - The key U.S. assertions leading to the 2003 invasion of Iraq - that Saddam Hussein had chemical and biological weapons and was working to make nuclear weapons - were wrong and based on false or overstated CIA analyses, a scathing Senate Intelligence Committee report asserted Friday. Intelligence analysts fell victim to "group think" assumptions that Iraq had weapons that it did not, the bipartisan report concluded. Many factors contributing to those failures are ongoing problems within the U.S. intelligence community - which cannot be fixed with more money alone, it said. The bold is mine. They were just victims see? Just innocent victims of....Well I guess it was peer pressure, wasn't it? Like a bunch of innocent children who just wanted to believe in Tinkerbell so much that they clapped their hands together until blood poured down their wrists. Millions protested, demanding to know why their own children should be sent without proof of any of the Administration's claims, and they were called un-patriotic because of it. They were told: "You don't know what we know... You don't have the secret intelligence that we do, but you should trust us". Well what now? Who can be held responsible for this violation of trust and needless bloodshed? I don't know either, but if John Kerry gets into the White House he'll probably force you to have an abortion against your will, so you should probably vote Bush. He seems like a trustworthy guy.

 That Ad. There was an ad on TV a while ago, for cookies I think, or crackers or something. I think it was urlLink these things . There was a guy sitting on a plane, and across the isle beside him was a woman in a business suit, glasses, hair up in a bun. The palette was all grey and kind of boring, and the guy had a disinterested look about him as he glanced over. The woman was working on something at her seat and accidentally dropped her pen, and as she leaned down to get it, we (the disinterested guy) catch a glimpse down her blouse to see that she is wearing a scarlet red bra with black lace. Man that was hot. What's got me wondering right now is, why did I think of that while staring at this spreadsheet? And why can't I get it out of my head now? And why can't I remember what the product was for certain? And where can I buy the product if I ever remember what it was? Cookies? Maybe it was a commercial for pens. Or bras. Or WestJet.

 Garbage day at the Star urlLink Royson James : Let's face it, garbage is a political hot potato. The City of Toronto has spent tens of millions trying to find a solution. The province has wasted tens of millions of dollars meddling in the issue and then dumping it back on the city. And through it all, one thing remains, few of us city slickers want it anywhere near us once it leaves the curb. The City of Toronto has embarked on a process that is sure to lead to controversy, protest rallies, confrontation at city hall, chaos, legal battles, frustration and delays and, finally, abandonment in the face of intransigent and angry residents. It's called an environmental assessment a ridiculously tedious, inexact, convoluted search for the best of several waste management solutions. It could take three, four, five or six years, or more. It will not satisfy residents. It will be blasted and dismissed as "fixed" to deliver a certain outcome. And it will cost tens of millions of dollars in a futile search for a dump or an incinerator for between 200,000 and 400,000 tonnes of Toronto waste the "residue" after the city reaches a target of 80 per cent reduction of its waste. urlLink Christopher Hume : Even the members of the Downtown Yonge Business Improvement Area, the most built-up and ad-heavy part of Toronto, which includes the Eaton Centre and the corner of Yonge and Dundas Sts., showed up at the meeting to voice their opposition to the monster bins. So did representatives of the Beaches, Cabbagetown and Bloor-Yorkville. One delegate after another worried about the size, the height and the obtrusiveness of the trash cans. That didn't stop the works committee from approving the proposal (4 to 3); their argument, made over and over again, is that the deal is one the city can't afford to turn down. Toronto is broke, don't forget, so selling off the public realm makes good sense to councillors such as Mike Del Grande (Ward 39, Scarborough-Agincourt), Michael Thompson (Ward 37, Scarborough Centre) Glenn de Baeremaeker (Ward 38, Scarborough Centre) and chair Jane Pitfield (Ward 26, Don Valley West). And the urlLink Star Editorial Board : The company that supplies the city's trash and recycling bins has offered to provide 2,500 oversize bins with the ads and 2,500 regular bins without ads. Thousands of current bins would be moved to places like parks. The city would still pick up the trash. Toronto would get $1.8 million annually in royalties, plus a share of ad revenue. It's a tempting proposition. But do we need so many 7 1/2 foot tall ad platforms? There's no sense in having clean streets if they can't be seen over trash cans, of all things. Why not just increase the number of regular-size bins, with regular-size ads? That would bring in more revenue, and decrease litter, without cluttering the streetscape.

 Scotty Scotty has urlLink Alzheimer's : One of Doohan's sons, Chris Doohan, of Thousand Oaks, California, said the Alzheimer's diagnosis stemmed from his father's increasing loss of short-term memory. "His longterm memory seems to be intact," said Chris Doohan, 45. "If you ask him how he got his role on 'Star Trek' or (about) D-Day, he can talk for an hour about that. But if you ask him what he had for breakfast," he can't say. That's all reversed. Doohan should be able to say what he had for breakfast and should be completely forgetting his involvement with Star Trek. There are legions and legions of Trekies out there who will gladly recount every detail of every episode for us all; Scotty doesn't have to remember any of that.

 The tradeoff They're big. 2.3 m tall litter bins. They're mainly billboards (lit up from the back, like a transit shelter ad), with a litter bin sandwiched between. The City's Works committee approved the proposed design at it's meeting yesterday. From the Star: Eucan, the private company that has the contract to supply sidewalk trash/recycling bins, is offering to provide up to 2,500 of the oversize bins and 2,500 regular size bins without advertising. As well, 3,000 of the current bins would be stripped of ads to be placed in off-street locations such as parks. The proposal, if approved by city council, would see the new bins appear in late fall, said Angelos Bacopoulos, the city's general manager of solid waste. A prototype wasn't available for works committee members to see, but it's hoped one will be when the issue reaches city council, said Councillor Jane Pitfield (Ward 26, Don Valley West), who chairs the works committee. The proposal was embraced by the committee over objections that city streets have too much advertising. Dave Meslin, who heads a group that opposes corporate ads in public spaces, said he supports reducing litter and increasing the recycling of cans, bottles and paper. But he hates the idea of bus shelter-sized ads. Meslin's website is urlLink located here . Publicspace.ca has been kind enough to post a document containing the proposed design, and urlLink dimensions here . The staff report mentioned on the website is urlLink located here , the concluding paragraph reading: There are at least two options available to the City if we wish to enhance the City?s Clean City campaign by installing at least 1,000 additional recycling/litter bins: (a) continue with the existing contract for litter bins with advertising with Eucan and purchase 1,000 additional recycling/litter bins without advertising; or, (b) accept the proposal from Eucan, which would extend the term of the existing agreement by approximately five and half years, amend the financial returns and place 1,500 or more large advertising bins in the road allowance. The financial analyses in this report show that accepting the proposal from Eucan appears financially better for the City rather than maintaining the existing contract and purchasing 1,000 additional bins. These analyses assume that if we continue with the existing agreement and go out for bids once it expires, we would receive royalties that are similar to the existing agreement. Without actually tendering or conducting a financial analysis by an independent party with knowledge of the advertising industry, there is no way of determining what the City?s royalties could be after the current agreement expires. It is not possible to say unequivocally that accepting the proposal from Eucan would end up being financially advantageous to the City compared to maintaining the existing contract, purchasing 1,000 additional bins and tendering once the current contract with Eucan expires. Due to the various considerations of: retaining flexibility that harmonizes street furniture as part of the City's Beautiful City initiative; the implications on the streetscape of introducing 1,500 or more large illuminated advertising structures containing litter/recycling bins; the concerns with undertaking significant modifications to an existing contract without the benefits of a competitive process; and, the uncertainty around the financial benefits; it is the staff recommendation not to proceed with the current offer from Eucan to modify the existing contract. And you thought litter was just a little bit of junk on the ground... Recycling is important. We cannot return to the days of open-topped litter baskets or bins on our streets and in our parks. Everything that's put into those bins, be it cans, bottles, newspaper, etc., is wrapped up and thrown into the back of a truck with the rest of the garbage. It's not the fuzzy "let's all recycle because mother earth wants us to" argument, it's about money. The more tonnage of recyclable material that we can divert from landfill, means more money to this municipality from urlLink these urlLink two organizations. As we recycle more, the cheque just gets bigger. The other half of the money argument is that, as a municipality with no operating landfill, and a cross border contract to dump our waste, we must aggressively work to reducing the amount of garbage that goes into the Michigan-bound trucks. It's costing us a lot of money to send our garbage on an American vacation everyday. Programs like home, work and school recycling, the Green Bin, home composting and public-space recycling are all efforts to reduce the Michigan-bound garbage. We absolutely need street-side bins that have several compartments, to separate the recyclable material. Public space is important. We're bombarded with ads, and mass-marketing every day. Signs, billboards, buses, washrooms, and now even painted on the public sidewalks. It all adds up to visual pollution, and I agree it's really annoying. But you know...I'm a big boy, I can ignore it. We live in a time when consumerism is global and reaches into every aspect of our lives, and it's not going to change because the City allows or disallows ads on litter bins. Council has held out against the advertising demon over the years, first refusing to put corporate sponsor logos on the blue boxes (a proposal which would have seen boxes offered at even cheaper prices then we have now), and then refusing to put ads on Works vehicles (like those on busses and streetcars). The cost of doing the business of making our garbage disappear has skyrocketed in recent years, so that additional $1.8 million is a tempting carrot. For the most part the jump in operating cost is not big-fat-union pay raises, and it's not corporate bungling (if it is, then I got left of the loop on both counts), it's the fact that we used to pay $12 a tonne to dispose of our garbage in our own landfill, and now we're paying $52 a tonne. Advertising on bins may be a little ugly, but we have to face the reality of either higher taxes, or a bit of cash from the private sector.

 Kiss me I'm Greek So....did Greece win some sort of contest? Did they best a rival in a test of skill? They might as well have won their independence or slayed a Minotaur, for all the noise outside my Danforth digs. From the urlLink CBC : Toronto's Danforth Avenue erupted into a cacophony of car horns honking the instant the referee blew the final whistle in Lisbon's Stadium of Lights. Yeah. I know. When Greece beat Portugal in the first round, I knew. That cacophony of car horns and drunken screams went from Danforth Ave, west to College and Ossington, just to rub it in. I came home one night after Greece had beaten France in what one amateur Hellenic scholar described to me as "A fuckin' miracle, man. You have no fuckin' idea". The car horns lasted from the game's final whistle to about 2:45 AM while I was beating my head against the wall in an attempt to drown out the noise. As a loyal member of the neighbourhood and supporter of whatever these people are interested in, I decided that a walk up the Danforth was in order after today's victory. Danforth was blocked at Broadview (the crowd control barriers have been sitting roadside since early this week) and all the way to Pape. I live in the barely-Greek area of the Danforth: the area that has lots of bars, but only one decent Gyro stand. Greektown doesn't officially begin until you're east of the Carrot Common at Chester, and extends mostly until Pape with a smattering beyond. The street was as crowded with as many people, if not more, as a Sunday at urlLink Taste . I was pushing past soaked Greeks (thanks to God's impromptu wet t-shirt contest at around 5:30 pm), in an attempt to move further east along the street. Whistles, screams, chants, and OOOOPAAA!!! filled the air from one end to the other. Around Logan, crowds formed in front of the various media trucks; CBC and CP24 were the most popular, but CFRB somehow snuck their way past the legitimate media and found a spot in front of a Greek bakery. I knew we were live when the crowd started to scream and chant for a 10 second bumper-spot, before dying off to wait out the commercial break. Good spirited, nationalistic pride was no match for entrepreneurial libido however, as the street was also packed with "legitimate" vendors selling "Greece: Champions" t-shirts, soccer ball shaped whistles, and enough Greek flags for every available window in Riverdale. One old man even sold floral-print umbrellas from a shopping cart during the post-game torrential downpour. Overheard: "I'm ready for a big meal, some cold beer and some hot sex." And... "Hey ladies.... We were just wondering what you were doing after the street party tonight. Perhaps you could join us for a drink...." Greek boys will be greek boys. Greek boys with their priorities in order. Who's up for some Ouzo and a Gyro? Lord knows I am. It's going to be a long night.

 Reason I like winter #476 My skin stays one colour. We spent a good part of the weekend outside. I've been off work since Wednesday and between a round of golf with my father and brother, a Canada Day Hip concert, a picnic in High Park and a hike along the Scarborough bluffs, my head is starting look like a bronzed bust. Actually, because I'm one of these guys who keeps his shirt on under any circumstance (save morning showers and sweet lovin') the bronzed bust analogy is more like: "Shit, we're running low on bronze. Ok, just do the head and leave the shoulders and chest in pasty white plaster." Once again this year, probably around August, I'll start to get pulled off flights and busses by armed police and scrutinized about my involvement with Al Qaeda sleeper cells. "But my father was a protestant farmer from Stayner!" I'll protest. Yeah sure, save it for your Gitmo celly, freedom-hater.

 Garbage Week in the Globe The Globe's Marcus Gee has a 4 part Toronto garbage series all this week. The schedule: Today: The garbage "crisis" is really no crisis at all Tomorrow: Landfill phobia lies behind the garbage crunch Part 3: Why incineration is a burning issue Part 4: There's no turning back on recycling That's quite a slate and I'll be looking forward to all of them. I'll put links and sophomoric comments up here as the series unfolds. Onto the "crisis". From the urlLink Aug 2 Globe : Is Toronto facing the same fate? The city has been looking for a garbage solution since at least 1987, when the government of now-defunct Metropolitan Toronto began fretting over what to do when two local dumps filled up. Tens of millions of dollars later, it still has no answer to this most fundamental of urban problems. The best method it has been able to find is shipping the garbage to a private landfill in Michigan. Every day, about 140 enormous, six-axle trucks make the 12 to 15-hour round trip, taking their crushing toll on highway surfaces and spewing exhaust all the way. Almost everyone agrees that exporting Toronto's garbage is a poor solution -- including the people of Michigan, who have made unwanted waste from Canada one of the biggest political issues in the state. At the same time, no one can agree on a better way. Well when operations becomes a political issue then yes, no one will ever agree on a solution to anything. If there were bi-partisan battles about how to fill potholes in this city then every suspension would be shot. If bus schedules, or subway car maintenance were a debatable point then no one would get anywhere in this city. Garbage and "what to do with garbage" is a political issue plain and simple. It shouldn't be, of course, but it is. Adams Mine was a solution that was researched and presented and, under pressure, was abandoned ( urlLink decisively in later years) with no alternative presented. Increased recycling, green bins, and deterrent programs (like the commercial Yellow Bag program) were implemented, but the unacknowledged elephant in the livingroom is still "what do we do with the rest?". In the 1990s, Ontario's NDP government banned the building of incinerators. Just this spring, the current Liberal government cancelled for good a long-standing proposal to ship Toronto's trash to an empty mine near Kirkland Lake in Northern Ontario. "We're busy ruling things out before we really look at them," says John Tory, a contender for the leadership of Ontario's Progressive Conservative Party. In Toronto's mayoral race last year, he stood out from the pack by supporting incineration (and lost to David Miller). That's a great quote from Tory by the way. It really sums up the experience around solid waste planning around this city. Proposals and potential new technologies are vetoed at the committee level with no further direction then: "We don't like it (or 'These community groups don't like it'). Give us something else". There seems to be an unsaid theory that there is some thing out there that will get rid of garbage, not produce any emissions, not produce any residue, be cheaper then the current operation and be safe enough for kittens and babies to roll around in, and that we just haven't found it, or done enough research to find it yet. The reality is that no such technology exists anywhere and we're fools to think that we can keep futzing around and gently testing the waters to see if everyone will be ok with the solution. When it comes to new technologies (read: incineration, pyrolysis, etc.) the war cry against is usually "It hasn't been tested. It hasn't proven itself safe and effective." That's a very reasonable point to consider. But proof that a technology works for a given city, in a given scenario is no guarantee that it will work here, and simply dismissing technologies on this basis is just childish. We have to, pardon the phrase, but think outside the box of what we know and what we're comfortable with. We have to have some fortitude to take a plan and move forward with it. Currently we're lacking in fortitude department. "You can easily find holes in the ground of sufficient size within convenient distance to take all of Toronto's waste, but nobody wants it," said Richard Anderson, who teaches geography at York University. "People freak out over garbage issues." Some environmentalists even say we are wrong to produce garbage in the first place. Our trash is proof of our wasteful ways, they argue. "There should be no such thing as garbage," Frank de Jong, leader of Ontario's Green Party, wrote in April. "Garbage should be recognized for what it is, partially used resources." Right and what of the toothbrushes and potato chip bags? So the fact that we have garbage is just laziness on our part? For a resource to be utilized there has to be someone willing to utilize it. Municipalities can't effectively produce recycling markets with the stroke of a pen. We rely on the whim and call of business and industry to dictate what can and can't be recycled. If there's no market for, say, green glass bottles, then guess where those bottles end up? The city had a foretaste of what could happen when the U.S. border was closed for 16 to 18 hours last year because of the scare over mad-cow disease and Canadian beef. Garbage trucks lined up by the dozen at the transfer stations. Ahem. Yes. urlLink I remember . To complicate matters, the provincial government decided in June not to let Toronto open a research facility to study high-tech options. So council voted to conduct an environmental assessment, a process that could take several years and cost millions of dollars. Naples tried for a high-tech solution, too. City officials wanted to build two new low-pollution incinerators to deal with the overflowing garbage. Residents and environmental campaigners resisted. No one wanted an incinerator in their backyard. And so we get to one of the keystones of the debate: everyone wants a solution but no one wants it to affect them in the slightest. Gee's final point should be taken seriously. Instead, they got piles of refuse in their streets, a medieval scene of squalor straight out of Roman times. Looks like a well researched series. I'll post some updates and future articles from the Globe.
