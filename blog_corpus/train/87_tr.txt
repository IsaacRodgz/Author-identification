 Conform, Consume, Obey! urlLink |Mr Snaffeburger is Happy!|



 Oops, did I put that? ^ ^ my bad! such an oxymoron

 Evan, pretty, hahahahahaha......

 ACK! David has informed me that we had a repeat today! >

 My parents left me alone for 2 hours and insanity took over. First I washed my hair...with Herbal Essense. I started yelling "Where are my Elf guys?! Come to me pretty guys! Come and wash my hair!" ...no one came... \/ \/ Then I went outside and was walking on top the snow. I was like "O! Look at me! I'm an elf! Walking on the snow! I'm a beast! ...geez I sound like Destinie. Okay, going back to being kim!" Then I fell into a hole and snow went up my pant legs >

 gah, sorry guys I got backed up > Dest's dream: Well at least I'm noticed missing. you see me and Bakura were uh.."cleaning" the supply closet for Mrs. Swann...yeah *cough* -^ ^- Yami: Yami or Yugioh is a thousand years old pharoh from Eygpt. Back then, they used magic to have battles with monsters as fun. the loser lost his life (thats always fun). but then the monsters started to get out of hand because of a magical demention called the shadow relem. here, the monsters actually came to life. to seal way the shadow relem, yugioh trapped himself and others into 7 "melenium objects". Now, several people have possion of these objects. when yugi needs help with the duel monster cards, yugioh takes control of his body.He's called yami because its the jap. name for dark. Yami also calls yugi hikari (light) or aibou (companion). so basically, Yami isa spirit thats takes control of Yugi in times of danger. Janine: Hun, you are in the reality bound comic but you are not part of the crew. The Group is the basic cast and crew. Answer this: Do you sit at the third table in the CCSA caf. at lunch time, at 11:10 everyday? No? Then you arn't in the crew. Piccy of Janine: Very nicly drawn Dest! You keep getting better at drawing anime us :) wee.just in case anyone is wondering where i am, i had a doc. appointment. he still isn't too sure about me going to school >

 O_O;;; fun?

 Ah thancks, and no, i've gotten busy .... * cough cough* with Chris. Ooo yesterday was our 2 month annaversary, So we decide to adopt a fish. Its so cute and spoiled. Its all pretty and its name is Dara the Ass bandit Cunt Master! and on her tank is a name tag that say "Hi, My name is Dara, i'm here to Waaaaaaaaaaarssh Your Vagina"



 O_O;;; Okay, Yugioh is a schizo so when his little magical thing errupts, this big tall guy with the same hairdo appears and his name is "Yami" or something like that. His voice gets deeper too, it's weird. Omg, I was playing the Two Towers video game and the actors do the character's voices. (he he he) Oh yeah, and Janine is always like, "where's me? I wanna be in the RBcrew picture" and I'm like, "You're not in the crew. The crew is the group" and she doesn't get it!! GRRRR! What is her problem! Someone explain it to her! I will draw her tribute and post it here but she needs to realize she is not in the GROUP!! Hey David, did you finish the quiz yet? :)

 If it mean naked.... welll... then Des..... That wasn't a dream........ It was a wet dream...... Of......Tks........How'd you get it?.::runs away::

 WHAT THE HELL IS YAMI!!!! Me and Chris are curious!!!!!!!!!!!!

 OMG OMG OMG I jus read. We are off of school UNTIL MONDAY. This week jus keeps getting better and better!!! THERE IS A GOD!!!!!!!! And its not counted against our Summer Vaca!!!!!!!! Oh Joyouse day! ::prancesa nd skips away happily::

 Okkkkkkkkkkkk

 I am so bored. I want school. >D I had this weird dream... So I was walking down a dark alleyway at about four in the morning. I was walking along side of Joey and Yugi was to his right. I was dressed in a robe, laced with gold with a bunch of gold chains and cloth underneath. Joey, was clad all in black with the same. Yugi, was well, Yami. Three people blocked our way up ahead and I couldn't make them out until the moon shined down on them and I noticed it was Yami Bakura, Marik, and some guy in a turban. Marik, who looked very mad, said something that I could not understand and a big moster appeared. It was Obelisk the Tormentor or something like that. Yugi's pyramid began to glow and the monster was all sucked up. Then, Marik, Looking even more pissed off, sent out a big, golden gryphon thing. I wipped out some Jackie Chan, Tossing aside the robe and sid some flips and stuff. Then I swung this big, gold staff that I had and the gryphon got sucked up. I smiled. Then Marik was really really really mad and he sent out an invisible moster that began to chase me. I was scared. I ran to a corner then Joey kicked a paint can full of blue paint. I then saw the feet that looked like elephant feet and then I swung my staff and electricity ran out. Then, a big bolt of lightning shot down from the sky and killed the monster. I looked around the corner and the police were coming! So I ran and was like, "The police! The police!" The two other people ran away but Bakura was like, "Quick! Follow me!" So we climbed up on a roof and flattened ourselves out and laid there. Then one of the officer's looked up and was like, "I see you, come down" (Meanwhile, two kids were running around screaming, 'Yo Trabajo! I'll get you!') "We're not the bad guys." I told him. "I know." We all began to walk away when Bakura was like, "Come here, look" And pointed to our staffs. (Joey's red, Mine gold; we had left them up there) And he said, "I could take them if you'd like." I gave him a sideways glance and uttered, "Noooo." We worked our way to school. When I finally got to school, the teachers were lined up at the doors talking about the "electric storm" so I stopped by my spanish teacher and asked her about if she saw the electric storm. She said, "No, I was taking care of my ferret." So Joey decided to run off (meanwhile, I'm still holding his staff in a plastic shoprite bag.) I went to look for him, when someone told me we had a half day. I seriously needed to look now, so I went into the cafeteria and called for him, he didn't come. Sighing, I walked away to board the bus. The bus was driving away when I ran and jumped into the bus (still holding the staffs) and I began to fall asleep because I was tired. I had spanish homework in my lap and the kid was like, "Hey! Don't stare, look, you're doing your spanish work wrong! That is nosotronamos!" I glared and thought, no way that is nosotrosamos! Outside, someone was flagging me down going, "I FOUND JOEY!" I jumped out of the bus and ran into the school where I saw David and Assia. "Hey!" David cried. "Have you seen Joey?" I asked them. "No." They said. "How about kim?" "No." They said. Sighing, I noticed that the bus was leaving. I asked TK if I could use his cellphone so he handed me a yellow remote. "You have to press this, this, this this this and this, to get it to go. Then you press the number and then press this, this this and this!" I put in the number but it was wrong. I tried to press the buttons in sequence to get it to work, but I did it wrong. Then I remembered that Joey and I were going to WALK home so I didn't need to worry. (Though my school is 40 mins away from my house) Then, while I was walking down the hallway, I saw Yami Yugi. "Have you seen Joey?" I asked. "I looked in the cafeteria, he wasn't there." Yugi said he didn't and I was sad and then... I woke up. >.

 NO SCHOOL TOMMAROW.YAY

Yugi: yeah, me and Dest went on a rampage, but you have to admit the psychopaths are really cute ^ ^ Quiz: I was bored and taking random tests and I took the RB test again, and I was David... Rave: Raves are Nice... ~ ^ Thursday Lunch: We were all really bored and were pretending to be the power rangers. Then Mouse complained that she's always a cat thing in stuff and was going to make a Mouse Zoid. So there's your explaination. Guess What?! I forgot to enter this today, it's my Dad's B-Day so bow down to him...at least say happy birthday ^ ^ HAPPY BIRTHDAY DAD!

 Sorry about yugi. I will stop with the yugi. XD The test does not lie!! WAHHHHHH! OMG- I will try to put in Gnome, I rushed a little and I was weak on questions. I am sorry, D, You sound upset. O_o; I don't know what a rave is...

 I HAVE AN ALMIGHTY ANOUCMENT TO MAKE! kim and i were talkin a while ago (for over two hours, WE WERE REALLY BORED!) and we decided not only on some new t-shirt slogans, but also to put up all kinds of posters around the school telling people to join my military! MWA HA HA HA HA HA!!! "you have a lava lamp, i have a bucket." "most people would be happy meeting themselves once, i get to meet myself twice!" "Welcome to the TK army, and remember, it's not the size of your heart, it's the size of my paycheck. NOW GIVE ME A DOLLAR!" hehehe, you'll have to ask kim for explanation... "happiness in a warm gun"- John Lennon/Paul McCartney

 Oh and Kim I also didn get the thursdays lunch thing, maybe I jus dunn remember that....... Dragon machine? Wait, I wasn't there thursday? Maybe someone needs to fill me in?

But I decided now I'ma post the good juicey, sexy, (no elves, or cartoons) version. Ah, the drugs, sex, lies, and Group fucking...... look for it later. maybe tommarow or tonight. Does everyone know what a Rave is?

 ::Throws a single streamer, and pathetic confetti falls:: Whoo..... Des. said ass......::twirls fingure::

 Ok, this blog, well, I won't go in detail. Is starting to annoy me, well, theres a few things any way. So, after reading everything in the past few days I guess, I'm like ok..... I'm not takeing that stupid Yugi test, Yugi is highly starting to annoy me. I mean its reach its level of "I don't give a shit" I don't want to hear it...... but the yugi stuff isn't what annoys me, alought it did peve me a lil on the page to scroll down and see 5 huge pics. I dunno. Any way. I like your song kim yay fer you. yeah des. we had a theme song apointed by you but, does that song really fit, I dunno I remember thinking it didn't.....

QuyteDragonSlaya: well, we though jus by chance it maybe jus you could pay for a thing, no... so we backed out.... and were about to go back on the street when we notice QuyteDragonSlaya: that lil parking loops around, and comes out to our right, with no gaurder things blockin it, and jus "wrong way, and one way street" signs on it...and there was parkin at teh end of it... RavNic1: oh no you didn't QuyteDragonSlaya: So turn to Tai and I'm like "wana be daring" "Sure" "hang on" and speed down the one way parking thing hahahaha QuyteDragonSlaya: in the wrong direction hahaha QuyteDragonSlaya: and people all out and watchin us, givin us looks hahaha QuyteDragonSlaya: and we park, and on the slant you are not supoused to be able to park, amazeingly, i did it perfectly QuyteDragonSlaya: so we jump out, and are tryin to act all casual.... haha QuyteDragonSlaya: and of course we relize, that to park there... you need a lil pass in your window as well... which we did not....

 LOOK! It's Dest. and Smurfy.. lol. >>; isn't it cute!

 Only days I am busy are thursday when I see Cho and also Monday or Tuesday one of those days I am spending at UoD wit Gnome

 I got Kingdom hearts Kim Yay, and also my da said he can take me to the cristiana mall but only around 2, and I have to figure out a ride home cuz it'll be on his way to work. But yeah, so I'll go play it, and Kim and me WILL beat it tommaro!!! Yay!! AND WHY WEREN"T we invited.... Me and Kim should get our OWN beach house.....

 I'm bored...D and I are going to rent Kingdom Hearts tomorrow and play it so we'll give everyone the low down on it. You know ...if we had a beach house we could play it there. But no no one invited us nor do we have a beach house so now we're all stuck in our non-beach house like houses . *cough cough* *hint hint* *wink wink*

 i'm going to the beach tomorrow morning an will be back around on tuesday so i'll miss spending the Martian New Year with you guys! not that we planned anything...but anyway. i will be taking my laptop so i'll be able to keepin touch, so the chat room still might work. we must see each other some time though, that much i know!

 Blah, I'm leaving for Trap Pond (Lower DE) on Monday and won't be returning till Friday. ( Ideas for what to do over vaction: Movie Party (Randum has yet to see Rocky Horror Picture Show!) Easter Egg Dyeing Thing Martian New Year (?) Prom Dress Shopping Dest's B-Day is the 25 BTW Chat Room With Everyone If anyone whats to do something else post it or if you have any comments on what we want to do. Especially with the last one, I need to know dates. If I do find an internet connection down there, we could have the chat during the week, otherwise you'll have to have it with out me. Blah, what else? I can't think of anything. But then again I just woke up so don't hit me!

 That sounds odd "I got my room!" Does it come in a can? Buy it at the local furnature store?

 What is this? Everyone thinks "We're so cute?" Whuuhhhh!! (thanks D...) Oh! I GOT MY ROOM! YAY!!!

 Awwww, but you SHOULD go out ;) hehehe

 ((I already voted... ^^')) Contrary to popular beliefs, I am NOT going "out" with Connor. Nothing is nothing as of yet. x_x; (If that makes any sense at all.) I got final Jeopardy right!! And the Cash 5 first number! My lucky number 27! It's a sign!! :)

 Just to update people, the caption contest has a current tie between Assia, Dest., and Gnomie. I'm going to change the picture on Friday so vote while you can! http://www.geocities.com/demonangelwolf/caption.html

 DEST HAS A BOYFRIEND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

 gah. this layout sucks. XD Kim, you should have been @ skool today. It was ... odd... asi and I'll call you later. ^^

 *wishes she'd stop being sick* :p If anyone wants to blame someone for me not being there today, blame TK. I had this dream last night...well actually i had two but anyway, the first one, I thought it was today, and we were going through the normal school day, i was late so i didn't get to see TK and his scythe it'll 4th period. at lunch, we all went up to my locker, per normal except TK was really going at it with his cloak and scythe. And then he opened his locker grabbed pete, who was for some reason in there and why did i make him sound like a person?. and stabbed him with the scythe. Friut guts went everywhere and it smelled horrible! I mean, it was so nasty! Dest, Assia and I ran to the bathroom next to the dance room and D and Tai ran the other way. I woke up in my bathroom throwing up. *shivers* it was sooooo nasty!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (pete i mean but that was too) Ugh! the second dream i had when i got back to sleep about 7 o'clock. For some reason, we (my family) took a train to a mall where there were all these fansy resuranunts. We going to have dinner with my aunt and grandparents there. We met David and TK in front of the resuraunt, they were just there chillin' . But the i remebered i didn't have time to change from my p.j.s (i'm standing there in a mall in my pjs!) so my dad and i went into stores trying to find a fansy outfit for me. We went into this one store and he picked up these cool sparkley pair of pants and then he said they would fit cause I was fat. HE CALLED ME FAT! and then I woke up. > *Sounds like Cho making fun of her mother* Moral of story...don't drink a bottle of v. coke when yo feel sick at 1 am in the morning then go to bed. Also, if your friend tells you they love you...DON'T PUNCH! say...thank you.

 wizdom from Dest....that no one can understand

 Tk. Watch what you say. Sometimes the tounge is as hard as nails. that's all I have to say for now.

 well, here i am, it's 3:05am... wachin tv, thinking abou how i'm not gonna pass school this year so i'll probably drop out or somethin... wow, got a little blah there, didn't i? anyway, just heard an interesting quote: "i'm gonna kill you so hard"

 For those who don't know, beware of Monday. TK's gonna wear his cloak and have his scythe . So yeah, be careful. Also, if you can't tell yet, I love random quotes. Hinting the following sentance. "In the land of happily ever after live those who aren't."

 ATTENTION DUELISTS! no i'm not going to say the quote, i just needed some sort of heading. anyway, as some of you know i went to my sister's play at her school a while ago and there are some weird things that you must know! first off, THEIR SODA MACHINES ARE OFF EVEN AFTER SCHOOL HOURS! that was some good cherry coke.. i did have to bribe hitty-smacky with a soda so she'd stop dancing and stripping on the table in front of the rest off the cast after the play. but her soda got stuck so it al worked out, HA! and yet another reason why our school is better than thiers, they don't have an autoturrium, they just set up chairs in the cafeterria. AND THEIR CAFETERRIA IS SMALLER THAN THE SENIOR LUNCH ROOM! yeah... so anyway, their smoke machine set off the fire alarm, every night so far, lol, and my sister has a reputation as a whore at her school (we won't discuss that) so thats it. oh yeah, she did try to convince me that this guy she knew is another stalker to add to my list (if you don't know the story about the first, welll... ask someone else, i am done tellin it) wjere was i, oh yes, just because he was askin my sister if i was gonna be there for the show that night than hangin around me till i left does not mean he's my stalker! don't they have to be hiding in the bushes with a camera or somethin? anyway, my sugar high is wearing off so i'm gonna go! see you all on monday, with my sythe MWA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!! ps okay, i have to say it: attention duelists, i'm not wearing any pants! and dest, have you ever been to the dentist? hehehe, i'm gonna have to put up with mr thirsty a lot on monday now, but it was worth it

 Dest! I can't find it!!! > ... WHY IS THERE A GREEN MOOSE?! IT A MOOSE! AND IT'S GREEN! WHY!

 -^ ^- Ewan!!

 Kim, you have done something horrible to me. I am having dreams with EWAN MCGREGOR!!!!!! AGGAGAGAGAGAAAAAA!! Anyway, so I was riding on a bus with you and him sittin' there dressed up like Obi Wan. And I'm like, "gee, mister, you look familiar. What's your name?" And he's like, "Ewan Mcgregor." And I was like, "Wow. You're famous!" So then we get off the bus and he's running around training jedi and kim's having mucho fun at this point and I'm so bored. Then one of the jedi throw on a magic necklace that allows them to do like harry potter crap and I'm like... what happened to the force? "that's outdated" anyway... it was weird. I'm advanced! go to: oekaki.n3.net and go to the advanced board! I have a pic of link up there!! :)

 Dest, can you type up what the dream was about? between the play and my head going 25 mph i kinda lost you ^ ^;

 *blinks* I ruined what now?

 *nice quote kim* Yay! just to clear everything up, I am not going to prom this year, I will be attending next year. Okie dokie? Yay, we get to see Les Mis tomarrow. ;_; (nooo.) AH! KIM!! YOU RUINED THE DREAMMMMMMM! Oh, by the way... I went to ringbearer.org the other day and they had lotr answering machine messages and I was like, "FUNNY! Weee!" So I wrote my own: Legolas: Sorry I'm not availible right now. Please leave a message and I'll get back to you after I lather, rinse, and repeat... wait- I missed a spot-------- Aragorn: This is Aragorn, son of Arathorn. I'm not here at the moment for I am busy saving some poor pathetic race from destruction, being smelly and manly, or hanging with one of my many girlfriends. *slap* ow! *beeeeeeeep* Arwen: Hello, this is Arwen, daughter of Peter Jennings... I mean Elrond. If You wish to talk to me, leave a message after the beep. But- If it's Aragorn, don't bother. I'm not talking to you. Tom Bombadill: This is Tom! Are your ponies smarter than you? Are you lost in the Barrow Downs? Are you looking for a good time? Then stop on by, me and Goldberry have Karaoke every thurday and tuesday oh! But if this is Peter Jackson, I keep a machetti in my closet so don't even think of coming by!! You and your tom-less *beeeeping* script!

 *heads slams onto the desk* Someone...shoot me...now

 Random Quote: Bad News For Tai "The Bigger They Are, the farther they Fall, A Womans Breast are like a jouney, the destination is their feet"

 I'm so tired.... so so tired. I have been working on my essay for 12 str8 hours... TOO MUC TOOO MUCH> I AM MOOSH

 *yawn* I'm so tired... - - Anyway, this came to me after reading the story of Newark and at 12:00 at night. > Author: Snarky (Kim) Rating: G (A few curses) Disclaimer: This is the only story I have ever written that I can say IT'S ALL MINE! Please don't steal! ^ ^ Summery: The Title says it all. Now, the show...err Story! Reality Bound Productions Presents... Looking For A Gnome! On the streets of Newark, the unsupecting shoppers, students, wanderers, and couple are forced out of their Sunday stuour by a life size Gnome running across the street. A few minutes later, a couple is confronted by...a midgit? Tai: Hi! Sorry to bother you but have either of you seen a Gnome? *holds up a shirt* She needs this. A few minutes later, a block away a girl and a guy appear with guns. They look around the street before looking in trash cans and under rocks. Behind them a cloaked figure carries a sign reading 'Gnome Hunting Season'. Seeing the people's eyes on him and the sign, the cloaked figure takes out a scythe out of his cloak and turns the sign around. It now reads 'I am Death.' Turning the sign around to Gnome Season again, he continues to follow the two. Just then a Gnome runs across the street just behind the trio. On another part of Main Street, the midgit how has a friend. The two girls walk down the street calling for...a gnome? Tai: Gnome! Come Out! Dest: Here Gnome! Heel Girl! The others around them don't know how to react. Meanwhile, down the street a bit, the girl and guy are currently against a police car while two police officers pat the teenagers down. Kim: They're fake! We swear! It's all a fun comic...thingy! David: yeah! ...uh...the guns were supposed to be fake? Kim: ...yeah... The two look at each other but for Kim starts slaming her head against the car roof and David looking at the sky whistling. Elsewhere, The Life size Gnome is being chased by the cloaked figure, aka Death. They duck into an alley way and a bttle or struggle can be heard. The cloaked figure comes out of the alley with something in his hand. As he speeds off to find the others he doesn't see the life size Gnome peeking out from the alley. Somewhere...Out there...okay back to Newark. The gang has gotten back together when TK crosses the street. TK: I found her! I found the Gnome! He holds up the object, which turns out to be a garden gnome. Kim: Thats a garden gnome. David: We're looking for a pimp life size one. TK: oops. Tai: Nuts! (Kim: Cheese!) She's gotten away again! Dest: What do we do now? David: We have to find that Gnome! It's our duties as Cabbies and original Reality Bound members! We have to find her and we will! With Satan,a nd God laughing their asses off at us, by god, we will find her! Everyone: *blink* *blink* TK: Or we could get Ice Cream. David: that too. To the Ice Cream Shop! They cross the street and enter the parlor only to stop just inside the door way gasping. Tai: It's the Gnome! T o B e C ontinued! David: And She has Ice Cream! How come she gets Ice Cream?! Kim: Shut up! The Story's over! Go to fade out! *~Fades To Black~* TK: *with a flashlight* look look! Shadow puppets! *@*% BANG !*#@* *the light goes out*

 Dest! your up in NY?! see this is why you people need to blogger! I had no idea! You should have taken us wth you...I can fit in a bag. BTW, i'm home ^^ Lookie at blogger! It looks all spiffy!

 Hey D! I did what you said and got a tan!!! (and also a burn...)

 I haven't been blogging since I'm up here in NY peeps!! I miss you all! And Janine has frantically been wondering around looking for someone to let her buy a HP #5 without being on a waiting list. Sucks, doesn't it? We're too lazy to put our names on waiting lists.... I got Lost Kingdoms for my GC- Arg, our basement flooded and my room is all moosh, I hope it's better by the time I get back.......... "STELLLLLA!!" Hollywood Homicide... ^______^

 D--Transmit--can't--hear--damn--battery--fuck--phone--grr!--D!--Can yo-- Okay I Changed Phones -^ ^- D, Kim, and the dying Phone

 Nah, she has a wig on her head. haha hehe *smacks self* Anyway, are we the only two here?

 Something just hit me as I read kims post.... hedwig... the Hairy Owl.....

 YAY KIM, hehe I was in the harry potter book!! I attacked an owl. I am famous!!! Oh, btw I have yet to go to bed since the last time I posted I should go to bed like 2 days ago....... I truely do not sleep. I LOVE SUMMER. Sleep is over rated. Man, ugh. I am in a good mood!! Hey kim lets do soemthing today!!!!

 LOL D, in the book Hedwig (Harry Owl) was attacked. I know who attacked her! Run D! Run! Anyway, I thought I'd share this with everyone since D's in such a good mood over HP. In the Book, Ron (Uglyest of the ugly children) and Hermione (robyn played her in our comic) have this conversation and I could swear it was D and Robyn. "Ron! We're supposed to show the first years where to go!" "Oh yeah," Said Ron, who had obviously forgotten. "Hey--hey you lot! Midgets!" "Ron!" -^ ^- Doesn't that sound like them? Finished the book in a recorded time of 6 hours 23 minutes and 45 seconds. BOO YA! ... *realizing she has to wait another 3 years for the next book* ... D@MN F*CKIN& $HIT! F*CKIN& @$$ ^#*!^ %$!#! *%^#!!!!!!!!!!!!! *Goes back to slash fanfiction muttering about authors who update sooner then Zogby getting thin on Jenny Criag*

 Ah, reminiceing Tk:"I'm going to pass out" Tegan:"NOT BEFOR I DO!!!"

 Its 5 am....... no... no I honestly don't bother to sleep........ I hear birds......... and I hear an owl...... hes a lil late..... ::shoots owl::...... guess we know who died in harry potter now....... can i stop hearing that being talked about everywhere now? Aol, Neopets, Tv.... all of them talk about it.... don't they know.... THEY ALL DIED, I Shot them just as I shot the damnowl ::shoots owl again.....::maniacl laughter as I dance over the dead owl:: I shot the owl, I shot the owl ::doing lile funny dance::

 haha, yeah, me and tai thought, if Kim did not take the pic. Becky took it, but luckly we know now Kim has it and its ok, we are all still safe from Beckys..... um.... dreams.......... it was a close one.... maybe too close.... lets blame Robyn ::point fingur::

 LOL! Okay everyone calm down. The prom picture was taken from the locker on Friday by Me (who is having fun with the copied versions i made -^ ^- gotta love photo editing programs) and not Becky. i repeat Becky did not steal the picture. thank you for your...attention? yeah right

 la di da di da, bordum, la di da di da ::dances around, does the hula with Gnome, rips up preordered copies of the new harry potter book and burns them, then wonders when the porn version comes out, finally runs away and screams:: "Why the Owls, WHY!?"

 la di da di da, bordum, la di da di da ::dances around, does the hula with Gnome, rips up preordered copies of the new harry potter book and burns them, then wonders when the porn version comes out, finally runs away and screams:: "Why the Owls, WHY!?"

 I'd Tell if You would call me back when I fuckin call you!!!! lol. Its you I need to talk to first..... grrrrrrr..... On another note...... Glitter thong? I want one....

 A suspicion about what??? Tell Tell! BTW, Thought i'd share this with everyone. I had me laughing so hard i was tearing up. By Hogwarts Dropout (aka a fanfiction author) Well ladies and gentleman, I've donned the drag, consulted my horoscope, and sat down to predict the happenings in book 5 (order of Pheniox). Let me say now that I'm a serious diviner, and that this information is 100% accurate. And in case it's not, my name's not Hogwarts Dropout and if you're an angry mob of bloodthirsty fans, I ran the other way. So smack your five bucks on the table, give me a minuet to shuffle the cards, and without further ado . In chapter one, Harry's going to have to do some work. It will mostly likely be hot outside. I'm fairly confident that at some point in chapter one, Rowling will comment on the heat. Not Harry in heat - Harry in THE heat. That's a common mistake that inexperienced fortunetellers make. Particle words can really screw you over sometimes. In chapter two, the fates are telling me Harry will wear some article of clothing. It could be a glittery thong, or it could be a smelly sock. The ball's a bit foggy on that. Oh yeah - Voldemort will take over the world and Dumbledore will have a bag of popcorn. She won't talk about the popcorn, but he's going to be eating it. You can put money on that one. In chapter nine, Harry will discover the Order of the Pheonix. It is not an award, nor is it a super secret organization that inducts teenagers into their ranks because that's SO realistic and that's what ALL super secret agencies against the dark do. No, it is just Dumbledore's unique filing system. You heard me. It's how Dumbledore keeps things in ORDER. He leaves all his important papers out and the ones that his PHEONIX shits on are the ones he throws away. Mystery solved. In chapter four, Harry will comment on one of his teachers. There will be a new teacher, but no one cares about her or the millions of fanfics that will be written in which she transforms into a Mary Sue and has randy sex with Snape. We're only interested in the new Hogwarts janitor. His name is Bob, and he's eventually going to leave because of alleged claims of sexual assault. Bob, if I've told you once, I've told you a million times. Flitwick is gonna grope ya, and you have to be prepared for that. In chapter negative two, Harry will suffer through the death of one of his dear friends. Is it Ron? No. Hermione? No. Well then who is it? Give the spirits a second - they say it's the battery in Harry's vibrating dildo. Holy shit, this IS scary. In chapter twelve, the Quidditch quandary will be resolved. The new keeper is the ghost of James Potter. He's not very good, but nobody really cares because we just don't want to let Harry's parents stay dead. They must appear in every friggin book, so that soon Harry's going to get sick of his parents and they'll have a fight and he'll tell them that he wishes they were dead in a fit of hormonal teenage angst. Then he's going to realize that they really are dead and we'll have to go through the whole sob story all over again. And the new captain of the team is Terry Boot. No one can explain this, because he's neither Gryffindor, nor a quidditch player. I just call it as I see it. In chapter thirty six, the famous narrator of the Harry Potter books, who is so great he got a grammy, will loose his voice four words before he reaches the last phrase - which is - after much debate - "This is the end, dumbass. Close the friggin book." In chapter fifteen, the romance issue will be addressed. Harry is going to find out that he suddenly has a raging stiffy in the presence of his owl, but bestiality is not okay and will not be addressed. Instead, he will cover his secret urges by a seemingly normal and sickeningly superficial relationship with 'I-want-to-be-popular-and-date-Harry-so-much-that-I'm- going-to-slit-my-wrists' Ginny Weasley. We'll have to put up with her bullshit for an entire thirty-eight chapters until we can get back to fanfiction and read normal, healthy slash fanfiction. I predict that it will get harder and harder for fanfiction slash writers to transform Harry's hetero urgings in the book into homo fantasies in fanfiction. God I hope they can still do it believably. In chapter twenty-two, Harry will see a book/read one/mention one/be in one. It's one of those - take your pic. And that concludes my prediction. I hope this clears up any confusion out there. I know a lot of people are spouting bullshit about an actual plot, but we fanfiction writers know that's just another word for 'annoying thing that gets in my way when I'm trying to write it the way it should have been done'.

 GRRRR I hate this thing, it dosn't know when to stop burning, now I have to restart my comp. jus to get the damn disk out.... grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

 3 -4 pm honey. BTW, Dest. I was thinking about the animal pictures that we drew and instead of (random thought: I forgot about gnome! Damn!) doing out own story, I thought we could copy Fruits Basket. For those who do know what fruits Basket is, Its a new anime about a family and a girl who comes to live with them. The family has a curse on them though, if a person is hugged by the opposite sex, then they turn into an animal. -^ ^- Isn't that great? lol. Just think, D, Tai and I are alway hugging each other so it's like every five minutes "Oh fuck!" "We forgot...again!" "Squeak!!!" LOL

He has a hairy chest!!! :p -^ ^- So yeah, if you can't guess I'm back from Trap Pond (It's really a lake > 1. Since it's only the week after school ended, everyone should be home, right?

 If penguins can fly, than so can I! (that rhymes...)

 Maybe there's a switch or something?

 I know! But its still an intresting question. I mean, if gravity was lowered enough... they could fly, lowered enough, we all could fly. Getting back down may be a prob. though.

 You do know that a penguins bone structure and not the g-forces for the gravity is what keeps them *D glaring* ...from...flying...yeah... *walks away twidling her thumbs*

 (Everyone MUST answer)Davids Random Question Of The Day: Should The Laws Of Gravity Be Changed So That Penguins In fact Can Fly?

 Hey all. Got back from taking my SAT w/ Bobicus. There were only 4 Cabbies there (at least from what we saw). Bobicus, Me, Nicloe (Carrow) and Ariana (The one who wore the purple tutu thingy at Prom). So yeah, It was at St. marks High School. For those who don't know, it's a privite Catholic High School. But, OMG! It made me want to go "Yay for God!" They had carpet everywhere! Of course there wasn't a clock in any of the rooms. But talk about a huge school. They even had a chapel thingy. Oo; It's behind a huge graveyard and has a huge field. Plus the student parking lot is big. It was just soooo nice! Except...they have smaller lockers then us. Which makes me start thinking, do they have as many books as us? HMMM... Anyway, I fixed Randum's hair as D said, now...GO ADOPT A RANDUM MINI....THINGY! urlLink Clicky Here!

 Do you mean the big one or the small one. the small one, the hairs to long and poofed and the Big one I like :) Oh, and About the Echo, I didn't post the first time, so i redid it, but when I posted that, it posted both, grrrrrrr

Kim, David, TK, and Connor head out to the fields. Rhandi, Robyn, and I to do clean the house and gather eggs and milk. Everyone meets back up for lunch made by Rhandi. After lunch the others head back to the fields while Rhandi takes the milk and eggs into town. It's my turn to do the laundry. Kim and the others return for dinner around 5 o'clock carrying vegtables and some fruit. Kim and I start to make dinner. At 6 o'clock, Rhandi and Robyn come back from the town with meat. Today they bring back chicken. Yesturday we had beef. Dinner is done around 7 and everyone is happy. After dinner TK and David do the dishes then we all play for an hour. Now it's time for bed! Tomorrow will be like today but everyday is different. I love living with my friends. Goodnight. So is it bad? it is! all well. I think it's sopposed to be ^ ^;

Its the main point of the site and yet the link to read it is jus kinda flimsily throw in there somewhere... I was like oo.... read it there..... In with the Bios.. shouldn't it have a movieng thing of it own, Or shouldn't the movieng thing go to the comic and at the comic is a link to the bios, not the other way around? I dunno, it just seems to make more sense to me. Cuz like I said (knowing I'm dumb) I couldn't find where to read the actual comic when its the main point of the site!

 OOOOO

 I'm here I'm here... Oh and I have some reality Bound Quotes from last night!!!! Tai: "I did not influence him, I just suggested it..." Me and Tai: "SNACK PACK!!!" the last one we need to explain. There was this guy in wawa (besides Anth) who was hott. Then he went in a back room. I was sad. We saw boiled eggs in a pack that said SNack Pack. I said, "Ewwww, those arn't my snack pack.... my snack pack went in to the back room. :(" and then the guy came back and I kept calling him snack pack and checking him out, all night we kept calling hot guys snack packs. I thinka snack pack, is either a guys package, or his 6 pack, not sure what, but its something ah well. SNACK PACKS FOREVER!!!!!!!!

 OMG! that is so cool! I'm so jealous of you guys :p Tai, you suck. ...now what you suck we still don't know. ;p But really, that is so cool! Damn W. Virginia for being 3 hours away. > BTW, Dest. That pic? Can you give me the link again? My laptop froze and I lost everything. Including D. *whistles* D! here boy! where did ya go?!

 Ok So, the concert.... hehehehe Was awesome!!!!!! First we went, and had crappy seast that omg sucked, they looked like dots when we got there while The Goo Goo Dolls were playing and me and Tai said "Screw This!" and left Cindy and people and went to the lower level and stole much much much closer seats, Next to the stage!!!! No one cared, or noticed as we inched our ways closer and closer to the empty seats down belowe hehehe. We could actually see their faces and sweat now, :), and the music was loud, and we had room to dance our ass's off. We made friends with security so they let us stay there. And later, We got to go on stage!!!! Cuz they were letting people from the low ground level go on stage, and our security friends hehehe, let us go down there and get on with people!!!! :) We got to see Bon Jovi real up close, and he blew Tai a kiss she flipped omg haha was great :). Then we went back to our plat form and danced all night to the music and screamed till we no longer could, my throught still hurts!!! My legs hurt when we got home, we made that place a club. And when we got home, Jess told us, Me and Tai were on Tv danceing last night hahaha, on the news!!! We were on tv hahaha we were that much of hoochies!!!!!! A great night!

 And the Final winner, by a hair, Is Tai. Me and Tai are goin to the concert :) can not wait

 Can't see the piccy!

 When was the last time I was here?? Oh well. Anyway.... In case any of you care/haven't seen yet: Sirius black is all the way on the right and yes, that's his costume. I saw Dragonheart again last night and cried again. Not because Draco died, not this time, but because David Thewlis is playing Lupin... *sniff* What a cruel cruel world we live in. Hey! The guy they chose for Peter might actually be a good fit. ^^;;;;

 For those who doesn't know, i'm leaving to go on vacation today. i'll be back sunday night. see everyone later! (btw, i don't think i'll find an internet connection too easily so... yeah. byes!)

 Question for everyone (btw, since some people don't come to blogger I'll e-mail this to everyone). I am creating a neohome on Neopets for us. How? Well, we now have a neopets account. (reality_bound) The reason i did this is mostly for advertisment purposes. Also, if you don't have a neopets account and wish to see what its all about you can go on the groups. (reality_bound) If you people do have a neopets account and reality_bound has yet to ask you to be it's neofriend please either mail me your account's name and i'll ask or you can ask reality_bound yourself. Now, back to my original question. I am making a neohome for us all. What floor you you want your room? You have ground floor, 1st floor, and then 2nd floor. Also, if you have any preferances on who you want to be next to or you want to be on the east side or something please tell me now. Otherwise i'll get very pissy at you. ^^ Any ground floor people, I need to know now what you want your room to be made out of; cardboard, straw, twigs, bamboo, wood, chocolate, jelly, stone, brick, white chocolate, marble, silver, cloud, gold, or transparishield. I only need to know ground floorers room types at the moment. Everyone got that? Or are they confused? Also, Dest found place we can make our stuff online. It's better the 99dogs D, they have mugs, mouse pads, posters, and (i'm mentioning this just to make you happy.) thongs. Happy D? you can put doritos or penguiens on a thong for you ^^;;;

 yay! we all saw PotC! Orlando was hot and Johnny Depp was cool. We also got some ideas. But, really, that was a wicked movie! Our parody is now called " Pirates of the Carrybean The Curse of the Black Mango " ...even though the comic has no basic relation with the movie ^^;

 wow, i'm here...

 I'm going crazy, I need outa this house. MINI ROAD TRIP TOMMAROW. If I call ya, your invited, and if not, you prolly live to damn far for this rd trip!!! O, and I wana pick up Anth. :)

 First. For a sec. You did scare me.... I was like, What!!! No Shes jokeing, but thinkin about it made me wana cry :( . Second, I got the Pics thing too, and if they want me to take out earings, or if I don't agree with the way the out fit looks, or I wana wear something else, I Won't Give a Shit What they say, Its my damn pic!!!!!!!!!!!! hahahahahaha. And Why do you have to wear a skirt, The pic is only from the chest up!!!!!!! NO ONE WILL SEE THE DAMN SKIRT, So who cares. Reality Check to the school people.

 In case anyone one was wondering, and I know someone told me to tell them but I forgot who (> In about 80 years ^^ *grins* who did I scare? *snort* Seriously though, Doc says everything looks right. However he wants another test done. I dunno what but my appointment is in October oO; yeah. So who got the senior picture thing from the Fhosi place? "skirt and blouse" my ass yo. I'm wearing pants!

 It's alright D. chillies yo. go hang with ya guy and get better ^^

 So Dest. Whats this about a new hair cut? I hear you look like your Mom. *raises an eyebrow*

 I'M BORD Ok so I am gonna babble cuz I am bord and have nada else to do but, never mind, ok so a Duck runs in to a pickle, and says hey, ...... umm...... he says.,...... "hey, wana go see a cat" and the pickle of course can not talk, cuz pickles can not talk so it replyed "Sure"..... My sis. just fuckin ate my Mac and Cheese!!!!!! UGH. I was gonna eat that......

 HAHAHHAHAHAHAAH, My Mom just asked me, "Who was that guy who was here tonight?" I was like "Anthony...." she said "Oh, where did you meet him?" I Lied, said through Tai she said "Oh, well, tai Knows a lot of people" so i replyed "yeah, well with Breasts like that you tend to meet people" hahahaahahaha she was like :-o hahaha

 I AM SOOO SORRY KiM. I was really sick today. The guy I like came to see me though, :). But I felt bad for not being able to go to movies!! I talked to him so many times about it, was like I feel bad.... :( . I am starting to really like that guy, (Anth. btw, I've yet to say his nae in here lol) hes really cool, really cute, sweet, ....... I hope maybe we can start going out or somethin.... like more the just dateing or whatever, .. but right now he has a lil bagage, but thats ok. I understand that. Any way, how is everyone?

 I am so damn tired...... I could not sleep last night. It suck, I dunn why I couldn't sleep. And when I did, I'd have a odd dream and wake up, and not wana go back to sleep. I slept maybe an hour in the past 24 hours, and still found energy to go out. The guy I keep going out with is prolly thinkin I'm some kinda quiet, tired, boring, sleepy jack ass lol. Which we all know, is only partly true j/k. I actually kinda like him thought so I guess that sucks haha. ::passes out:: Oh yeah ::sleep talking:: I .... forgot what I was gonna say...... ah welll

 Ok, I will try to be there tommarow, for I will be around tommarow, Yay backness, whatever, any way, o, and I may bring a guy, ;) lol

 I got the joke, HAHAHAHAHA thats great!

 BTW, I figure we'll see PotC on Monday at Movies 10 at 3:45 for who ever wants to come. If you can make it then we'll see you there. Also, afterwards some of us are heading to TK's house to chill. Plus I'm probably going to bring over my tape with has Teen Titans o it, 'cause I know none of you saw it ^^; It's funny! And it is so us. BTW, D and I figured out who everyone will be. Robyn is Robin (*snort* she's gonna kill me), Dest is Starfire, Assia is Raven, Gnomie is Cyborg, and Tai is Beastboy err girl errr mouse. Beastmouse. > "My double is the prime minister." "George, your exact double is the prime minister?" "Yeah, thank god he doesn't look like me." LOL! ^^ yeah yeah, none of you got that, whatever. ^^

 all well. we tried. *sigh*

 #1: Smurfy doesn't like "online" XD #2: I checked out the rules for the Manga contest, Snarky. They said that any comic that makes fun of actual people/plagerizes/ takes other peoples ideas will be disqualified. This means Reality Bound. *sniff* But I am going to try!! I'm going to try with Toro Dimensional Warrior!! (And I won't make it probably, but I'll be working hard!) Keep me in... er... thoughts er prayers er whatever... >0;;

 So, I am talkin to Smurfy today, and I am wonder why hes not on the blog again. by now he has to be a full member of the group... Des, get him in here, somehow!

 I didn't get out of the MRI till the end *feels all proud* but i was so scared. > O! btw, for the pirate-y comic, you should have us all singing "We're the pirates who don't do anything (Kim: Shit)" and then after that verse you have D and I sqinting to off screen to were there are flash cards with the words of the song on. Of course da nd I don't have our glasses so we can't see it ^^; I dunno, i thought it was funny. YES! Sirius is dead! poor Harry. He has this attutide through out the whole thing ^^ I was bagging up.

 I just taught Austin to Throw Ice Cubes at My Mom and Sister haha its so funny

 .... Why else does Dinsy make their crappy sequals.... TO MAKE MORE MONEY!! And.... Your mom climbed out of the MRI.... awww ::snicker:: Awww......

 Ok, so I have been wokring on and thinking about the Wiz Of Oz, Reality bound comic I said I'd write forver ago. I know I'm slow, but I have been wokring on writeing other things too. Heres a lil part. ::lil people singing:: We are the lolly pop kids, the lolly pop kids, the lolly pop kids, and... Me: STOP SINGING!! ::grabs ones lolly pop and bashes him on the head with it, then throws it to the ground:: ::munshkins all back off in fear, hushed:: Tai and Gnome:: ::Look at each other:: 5 SECOND RULE!!!! ::Jumps after the lolly on the ground and bonk heads diveing for it::: ::The Lil people smile::

 Huh? I am so lost! ;_; Yeah, I already saw POTC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Janine fell in love with Johnny Depp- Why are they making a sequel?? Orlando is too cute, though. ^_^ *girlish sigh* Ah! KIM!!!!!!!!!! I am writing a fanfic based on our RB Harry Potter thing in which we all get to go to Hogwarts (TK calls it Pigzits) and we can write all five books out in OUR way, cause we're cool. ^^ (I finished 5.... Hah hah. Sirius died, but Lupin's still alive!!!!! :)) Oh, okay, so... I need ideas. I was writing the 1st draft but it sounds like poo. So yeah... and I was gonna type somethin' else but I forgot but now that I saw POTC I can work better on our pirate chapterness! (Still not done.. sorry!) OoH! I got my haircut! Oh yeah, and I had a dream and Snarky, you were flying around with demon wings and such... it was odd... Did u go in the MRI/catscan thing yet? My mom went in an MRI and freaked out so she climbed out. But not that bad. Gee- I'm really late... ^_^:;; Enough random notes from me.......................

 doom

 Well, theres now officially gonna be a sequal to PotC, and the cast and crew will all be back. Who knew?

 Ok, question, I am kind alookin at the blog stuff, and on the right.... is the thing to loo up posts, and next to from you can see, "Everything, Current Posts, Drafts, and Future Posts . Blogger can see in to our future now????

 Wait, the only memory of me you could come up with is me pokeing your shot area!!!!!! ::humph::

 O, and I did eat a Sub (Or, for Tk, an elongated sandwich) in front of Gnome, but I brought her a slurrpee to make her feel better, so its all good haha

 Yes, yes Kim I did pee right afterwards, after the edit, I ran off and peed...... I thought about peeing on the blogger, but figured my comp. would not like it too well.....

 OOOOOOO

 well...that was all weird. anyway, kim i am following orders and like the idea of seeing PotC on friday.

 I'm back.b Thank you both again for the fudge ^^ it's good. Just the thing I need to eat after an MRI. Okay, the was the most scary thing in my entire life. I started hyperventilating and scared the people. they thought I would pass out or something. my bad. I felt like I was going to pass out too. > ... my bad. :p Run D! *munchs on her fudge* yum! -^ ^-

 mom says no one can come >

 *snort* I love your rants D -^^- they always make me smile :) You have to write on a grey background? Mine's white. although, i agree, they didn't need to do it all up. I'm having a hard time finding stuff > ""STUPIDER AND MORE UNWELCOME THEN HOW ROBYN FEELS, DIMMER THEN A JOKE BY DES, AND TWICE AS FAT AS TK, AND SOOOOOOOO FAR LESS PRETTY THE ME"" *raising an eyebrow* ""SHOULD BE PRISION RAPED"" Nice choice of words. ""MY MOM LOOKING, FAT UGLY, i gotta pee, SHITY ASSS"" Did you at least pee after your rant?

AND WHY IS THERE A RE-EDIT BUTTON WHEN YOU PREVEIW..... WHEN THE HELL DID I EDIT FIRST.....BESIDES NOW!

 Ok, whats up with this new funkiness on blogger tonight..... where are all the other posts. I don't like this.....

 Thank you gnomie ^^ I'm still freaked out about it tho. (it's later today. "How about we see PotC (Pirates of the Carrybean aka Orlando Bloom's movie to try and get people to see he's not just an elf) friday? okay with people?" Friday . How about we see PotC Friday. I know you can't talk gnome, but it might be good to get you out of the house. ^^

 How about we see PotC (Pirates of the Carrybean aka Orlando Bloom's movie to try and get people to see he's not just an elf) friday? okay with people? Ok. Gnome can answer this!! Considering that it was posted on Tuesday, and it is now Thursday, it is irrelevant if I can go or not because I cannot go back in time. Am I right?!?! But seriously. I've been on a deathbed basically since LAST Thursday, haven't even touched the computer really. Until Wednesday. And since I'm not allowed out of the house anyway, I figured I'd answer your question later. As in right now. But you didn't know that, so I apoligize ::holding out a big bundle of flowers:: I think your other question was "will someone go to the MRI with me?" Which was Wednesday. AS previously stated, I was in my sick bed and could not get up to go w ith you. My heart did however go out to you while I read this, and I sternly told myself to write a reply. Which is right here. I hope it went well, my mommy has a big problem with MRI things too. If you really get freaked, you should get your parents to take you to the one in Philadelphia. They put on music for you, it's completely open, they let someone sit beside you........ Totally user-friendly. There's even a little fan blowing air on your face so you know you're ok. Seriously babe, if you need anything call. I'll help as much as a chipmunk-faced Gnome can. Love ya!!!

 I'm not talking to any of you until you answer the fucking question!

 GOD! why can't anyone answer my questions?!!?!?! Fucking Hell!

 why do i even bother to return to this horrid place when the only reward is to read your insane chattering!? ah yes, because i'm just as crazy as the whole lot of you... anyway, david i read your whole bed dilema and know this: i will kill you.

 . . .

 okay then. I have to take my bro to see a movie either today or tomorrow (most likely tomorrow). How about we see PotC (Pirates of the Carrybean aka Orlando Bloom's movie to try and get people to see he's not just an elf) friday ? okay with people?

 Yay! D, TK and I saw Nemo! What a depressing movie. "Happy Feeling Gone." LOL!!!

 I SEE MY DOG TODAY!!! lol

 Ok..... ok.... I have decided...... I won't get up and pee, but I won't pee in my bed either.... I'll piss in tks bed..... I can aim....... and then i'll blame it on that guy ::points out window:: now, bout those over due movies...... hmm.... damnit..... Its been 2 weeks.....

 So, its 5:30 am. I just woke up, everyones asleep. Tk made me go to bed at 12 rather then my usual 4 or 5 am, and I usually will only sleep 4-6 hours, so 5 am, I'm awake now. LA DI DA DI DA. And Energized and thirsty, and I think I gotta pee. I'll fix that later. So how is everyone? Yeah...... I'm chillin, waitin for like, normal people hours, man thi is gonna throw off my whole "day system" maybe I'll sleep in the car later to put it back on balance, that way I get toi much sleep and am forced to stay up till 8 am tommarow, be tired the next day when I get up at 12, go to bed at 2-3 and then the next day I'll be back on schedual, its a 3 day proscess hahahaha. I miss everyone. Des. has a butt? OMG I got a butt!!?! i notced the other day hahaha I was walking woith Tk and was like... oooo look... my butt! and he was like.... omg..... shut up..... and I was all like wne t home and in the mirror like.... I've got a form of a butt! So, Tk said another thing in his sleep again, not sure what, something, only one thing tonight, as he rolled over he kinda let it slip like..... ::roll::::snorr::" Whatchamanak"::roll roll::::snorr::settle::...... It suddenly is raining! Where the hell did that come from. I have over due movies. Wow, this is like a freak rainstorm outa no where. I like rain, I wana go play in it. I wanta drink. All we have is water, and I am fine with that, but its down stairs. I have to pee, but that involves etting up. Should I get up and pee.... Or just go in the bed? It'll Be warm for a minute, Its a big bed, I'll just roll over, I'll just blame it on that guy::points to right:: NEW POLL!! ...........j/k need.... something to do...... hey theres a guy outside....... what funny i befor I noticed I thought..... I sense dick..::looks out window, theres a man:: hahaha, in all seriouseness....... Omg the other day Tk and I were walking and I could not hear him talking next to me, but somehow, I heard someone say penis in a building like a mile away..... was like " My penis senses are tingleing" ......... and when we got closer, sure enough, they were talking bout penis..... Moral of story... if Tk really wanted me to listen to him, he should start his sentances with the word penis!

 ...you already saw it, didn't you? -_-

 your butt's fine. now, when will your parents lat you see Pirates of the Carrybean?

 My mom says my butts not big enough and wayne said it was just fine, so I need another opinion!!!

 Egad, this i why i don't come here very often... ITS TOO WEIRD IN HERE!! let's see, david- i hate you, i don't talk in my sleep, kim- you type a whole lot of funky stuff, gnome- what the hell was that!? and destinie- ...jut no, i never want you to say that again EVER! ok, have a nice day! LLAMAS SHALL INHERIT THE EARTH!!

 A new poll (well actually the first). How many people has actually contemplated Destinie's butt? D says send a picture

 BG, I'm about to make you mammoth if you don't choose something, you too TK, gnome, and ppl. It can be D, boy wonder vs. 5 mammoths and believe me your defects will be painful and embarressing.

 I'm sorry D! When i posted my "Come on" post yours wasn't up. Blogger is being slow. When are we all going to see Pirates of the Carrybean?

 PS- Snarky, love the shortie. ^_________________^

 Is my butt too small?

 I SAID WHAT I WANTED DAMNIT!!!! I get no credit around here, sheesh!! Any way... ::In a ghetto black girl in australia (if that can happen) australian accent:: There is a half naked, cherry red, snoring Tk sleeping on the bed across from me......Look at it, crikie, sure is fat....... :;shhushs the room:: I believe he has begun to talk in his sleep..... Lets listen in ::waves the camera over closer to him..... Tk: .......... I beleive he just murrmered the words Cheese cake, twice, but I am not sure...... ::puts ear closer:: Tk: Cheese cake........ chee.....::snor:: chesse....... fritters....... Ooooooooooooook, I wonder what hes dreamin bout, .... Tk: .....::snorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr:: Doom...... ::weeze::::snor:: Doom....... Cheeesee......doo.......dooom..........cake...... In the words of Bg: x.x;;;; Make sure to tune in on monday night, when me and Tk (who has no idea he is talking in his sleep) Will be invadeing a certain snarky shadows bedroom to see if a frying pan really does stay close to the nest. Until next time, this is Meta on "WTF Is that Noise, While Reality Bound Members Sleep........" ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ UPDATE: ::about to smother tk with a pillow..... evil grin:: STOP SNORRING.... I DON"T CARE ABOUT CAKE >>>>>>>...... :runs:: I think i woke him up, shit, ::points at kim:: at least hes quiet now, he kinda goes off and on...... Do I smell vics?

 *whines* Come on you guys! Don't be lazy! who do you wanna be?

 well, I think, I should either be Raven (sounds cool) of course kim prolly wants to bve her, or maybe Robyn (hey, hes cute and I want the name Dick), or or, don't make me cyborg...... Tk should be mammoth (fatty)

 Gnome and my mom went to the hospital on the same day, weird. yeah, my moms in the hos, she may finally die, but satan wouldn't be so nice. So she won't, so i am not rushin home to see her or anything, since I';ve been at the beach with tk for 2 weeks and the last words i said to her wewre, Bitch i wana talk to my dog. LoL. Glade ya thing went well gnome, we will visit. Also, umm, Me and Tk are red and sunburnt like shit!! Pain! lol hahahaha, aww well. Well ttyl byee

 Gnome had returned from the hospital!!! I hope all you guys had fun while I was gone, feel free to come visit me whenever you feel so inclined over the weekend, i miss my Cabbies!!!! *hugs all around, really carefully b/c of the chopped bones in the Gnome face* Anyway, time to go back to my sick-couch. Talk to you guys later, yay percosets making Gnome sleepy..........

 I need white out. damn. I did a short lil comic! yay for kim (a made in 25 minute comic mind you) boo for kim (shut up!) Anyway, I have an idea for a shortie (btw, anyone want to submit ideas for a shortie comic? you only get three squares though. One Day at a random movie theatre... "We are the pirates who don't do anything (Kim: shit) and blah blah (doesn't know the song > Dest: Arg! We are pirates! We're here to steal ya bootie! David: Bootie? where? *searches the crowd) TK! I want- TK: NO! Kim: *at the ticket window* 5 for Pirates of the Carrybean! TK: it's Caribbean. Kim: I care? We got tickets! TK: ... David: alright then lets go! Dest: Wait! TK: Now what? Dest: *looking between Conner and a cardboard cut out of Legolas* TK: You want us to steal that for you? Kim: Yeah, TK can hide it up his shirt like that last time (TK! LOL that was so funny!) Conner: i think they'd notice. Dest: ... Dest: ... Dest: ... Kim: Oh for the love of-! *BAM!* Conner: *Is now stuck with his head where legolas' head used to be* oww... Kim: now can we go? Dest: yessh ^^ End. :p

 ugh all that and you didn't tell me who you wanted to be! > Yeah, I know Saiyuki. Hakkai is so kawaii! Your right, they are like the marauders (except Sanzo has a drinking problem...oh! the wolfsbane ^^)

 *whoot!* I want to see Teen Titans!! ^___^ Omg- I found the Marauders snarky, but only you would probably get this. YOU HAVE TO SEE SAIYUKI!!!! IT'S HILLARIOUS!! In Saiyuki I've found them!! The marauders!! ((oh, I've just finished the part in the book where Sirius was all happy because it was christmas and stuff- it was funny. OMG- David does remind me of Ron a little.... I don't remember what part it was but he reminds me of him...)) Okay- It's: Sonzo (blonde-headed dude): Remus (He has a paper fan!!!!!!!!!!!)

Goku and Gojyo are always flipping out and Sanzo is like, "Get a room--" HEHEHEEEEEE!! BLAHJAA... >D I'm done now...

 *eye twitches* Okay then. We could have D, TK, and I play the villians? Or the newbies (Randum, Smurffy, and someone) play then villians... I dunno! pick who you peeps wanna be! Randum could be Raven (same everyone's an idiot attitude.) or Jinx, who is more gothic like. I don't know her grr >

 Arg, I think I'm so bored that I'm talking. > The Teen Titans are: Robyn (Richard "Dick" Grayson): Leader of the Group. Grew up with Batman (Bruce Wayne) after his parents were murdered. He's human, no super powers or anything. However, he's really acrbatic (his family were trapeze artists for a circus) and has all kinds of gagets. (Future: Nightwing) Personality: He's really Cool ^^ Raven (Raven is the only name she's had): Raven is the daughter of a union between Trigon the Terrible, a powerful extra-dimensional being, and Arella, a woman who was sued by a satanic cult to try to bring Satan to earth. She has magic-like powers. (Future: Raven in White and Gold) Personality: She's very..uh..depressing and gets annoyed easly. StarFire (Princess Koriand'r or Kory for short): Princess of the planet Tamaran. Her ability is to absorb the energy and then expel it in ferocious destructive blasts called Starbolts. Future: returns to Tamaran to be ruler.) Personality: Childish and fun, but can have a temper. Cyborg (Victor Stone): After a fatal accident, Vic lost most of his body and was put back together with machinary by his scintist father (S.T.A.R. labs). (Future : becomes Omegadrome and then with DNA they create a new organic body for him.) Personality: The oldest, I think. He and Robyn have lil tiffs here and there. Beast Boy (Garfield "Gar" Logan): He's Green. What else is there to say? He can change into any animal he wants too (they're green too). He's also the youngest of the group btw. (Furture: Changling) Personality: Very optimistic and and child like. He and Vic are together a lot playing video games and stuff. Their Villans: (Only using three) The H.I.V.E. (The Hierarchy of International Vengeance and Extermination) Jinx, Mammoth, and Gizmo. I don't know anything about them 'cause they weren't in the original series. Check out pictures of them at http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/titans/index.html And there ya go. Yes yes, i know I'm obsessive. ^^ But Dick's sooooooo cute! Any Anyway, I need you peeps ideas on who everyone should be. Obviously not everyone will be in it and it'll be a shortie (aka not like HP or LotR {which we still haven't finsh > *singing* Lets Go!

I was at the beach with Connor last wedz and I was in the candy store and there were these two doggies. You pull em and then they go back together and start making kissy noises. The funny part is that one begins vibratating as it moves to the other one. "This must be the boy dog..." I said. It was funny. Anyway.... Snarky- I'm reading HP5 and doesn't Umbridge remind you of Mrs. Zogby?!?!?!! OMG!!!!!!!!!! I had a dream with sirius and dragons last night... zZz... I'm workin' on the comic! Really! I AM!!! XD;

 Good Luck Gnomie! Hopefully they won't switch your file with a Tahra Stone and then cut out your heart and subsitute it with a baked potato. ...hopefully a chedder and bacon potato. ... ^^

 My blog's being gay right now... *sigh* Snarky, I had a scary dream: My mother and I were taking a walk. Our neighborhood was all underwater for some reason, but we found a path on dry land that led right into a forest. We decided to explore so we went in and found a little village. In the village were all sorts of monsters like grim reapers, skeletons, werewolves, imps, ghosts, gouls, anything you could think of. They were ravaging and pillaging the houses and killing the people. They ran off into the woods laughing and stuff. And then, after a few minutes, they came running out, CRYING in FEAR. Now I was scared out of my wits to see what would come out of the woods and would scare all of these terrifying creatures. And I was not prepared for what would come next.... It was YAMI BAKURA (yes, from Yu-gi-oh. I'm not kidding, I have a fear of that guy) He was laughing hysterically and he looked so.... demonic. The people of the village didn't know whether or not to call him their savior, or to be afraid of him. I wanted to leave, but it had gotten so dark that we couldn't....

 D, I'm sorry about last night. We got done running around at 11 but then had to go to Chichester and back >

 LOL. I just went to an Irish Pub for dinner, and it was sopposed to have a one man band, or so said DelawareOnline.com >

 Some wonderfully funny jokes to cheer anyone *coughdavidcough* up. When Mr. Monroe and his lovely assistant were traveling on business, they checked into a hotel that was overbooked and were told they'd have to share a room for one night. After the inital awkwardness, they tucked into seperate beds. "Mr. Monroe," the assistant called out in the dark, "I'm chilly. Would you mind getting me a blanket?" "I have a better idea," Mr. Monroe replied. "Why don't we pretend we're married, just for tonight." "I'd like that," said the assistant. "Good," said Mr. Monroe. "Then get your own blanket." * There's a knock at the front door. A man opens it and looks down to find a snail sitting on the stoop. He picks up the little creature and throws him as far as he can. Three years later, there's a knock. The man opens it, looks down, and there sits the same snail. The snail looks up and says, "What on earth was that about?" * Former Vice President Dan Quayle says that if you take out the profanity, the TV show "The Osbornes" is about good family value. You take out the profanity and "The Osbornes" is about 30 seconds long. * "I was walking on fifth avenue in Manhattan when I noticed a panhandler sitting on a box in front of the First Presbyterian Church. He was calling after passersby, "change, change, change." A young man in a business suit strode by and repied, "I'm trying. I'm trying." * "On my way to work one morning, I saw that someone was actually commuting in a Humvee. "Why would anyone drive such an ugly military vehicle for personal use?" I wondered as a drew closer to the truck. The Humvee's license plate answered my question. It read "4 NO RSN."

 YO~! Greetings from Watkins Glen, New York! ...did I do this last year too? Any who, no one is here! Where is everyone? Don't make me e-mail you all again. I will. :p

 Just a lil thing that has been cracking me up for a few days. As everyone knows (or should), alcohol is not allowed in state parks. Monday Night, Mom and Dad walked out of the motorhome with a champane bottle. Mom: We don't have any alcohol. *the wine bottle's cork pops and echos in the forest* *smacks her forehead while giggling* You have to love them sometimes. Now how many things do you know make that popping sound? lol

 Hey! *echos* *blinks* Where's everyone? Just so everyone knows, I'm currently up in the Poconos...well actually I'm at home, but yeah. Tomorrow, I'm heading up to Watkins Glen and won't be back Monday night. Oi, a 6 hour trip home > What else? ...i dunno. I'll be seeing you all soon, hopefully.

 Its starting to feel lonely in here......

 umm..... did u mean error... and need A computer, or was that part of the joke..... I'm not sure...... can i kill the people in my house? Please..... someone say its Ok.....

 A quote from my Dad's work group: "To err is to be human, to really F things up you need a computer."

 Hahaha, I didn even notice I typed birthdat, LOL, haha ;-P It was 4 am, sue me!!!

 YO! I'm back! ...and I'm leaving ^^;;; I've been busy getting ready for our camping week and painting D's room. How does it look finished btw D? Dest, the pirate-y pics are so cute! I like your pirate-y elf ^^ It's belated but....HAPPY BIRTHDAY(BIRTHDAT if your D) MOUSE!!!!!

 OOOOO, also I went to that link u posted Des. saw all the pretty pics...... why was that.. Dragon-man thing, not anatomicly correct!!!!! J/k, he was hot! lol

 So mew, thanx Des. No hurry. I think the new layout theme should be us as pirates, just cuz we did the pet shop one while we were planning a pet comic or us as animals comic or something, now, if you look on neo. and everywhere, we are all about us as pirates, so that should also be our blog theme. Any one agree? It will go well with when you finish the pirates comic and be released at the same time. be kinda cool. ::shurgs:: its 4 am..... I have been working on my new web site, to be opened soon, and its kick ass, better then anyone I've done thus far. I keep getting better and better at this shit haha. O, btw, I called her earlier and said this but here again, HAPPY BIRTHDAT TAI!!!!! (Her b-days the 31) ::tear:: Our mouse is now 17..... were growing up so fast. Next year, we all get reality bound symbol tattoes for our 18th b-days...... except Des cuz I already know her mom won't let her get even the tiniest of any tatto, so guess I'll be first lol. I want to any way, reality bound forever :-P So, blah. 4 am...... tired, yet not. No room to sleep in. My rooms still not done, Didn't get any black paint to finish up, hopefuly tommarow. I can't put shit in there and sleep in there till its done. My sis and her bf are sleeping on the couch, and I am just no where to sleep, so I'm staying onthe comp till my dad goes to work and I can steal his bed. haha.

 BTW, remember to put when your done! Otherwise all the other posts will be that color. Thankies! *~*Snarky Out*~*

 yeah, well we all knew that. Myew. See this? Click edit by my name and see what the html code I used was. Then just copy and paste it into your post but change the color. ^^

 i give up.. i have come to a conclusion. i am html impaired. gah.

 font colors of your text? go to funky-chickens.com font is: without spaces. F-C.com has a good color table with the hex #s under font.

And I was with my wife and my baby at the supermarket and I didn't think. I just put my hat on Clara's head, because it was cold. And the looks. I couldn't figure out why I was getting death looks. And then I realized my 10-month old baby's wearing a hat with the word pervert written on it and these people were like, 'There's Satan! There's Satan out with his kid!' And then I made a point of her wearing it every time we went there." - Ewan, on an experience during filming A Life Less Ordinary in Denver, Colorado; Buzz Magazine March 1997

And sorry I have not been able to much plan things or coroperate as much and well as I should, but I do have my own life to plan for, my own future, and some things are takeing a back seat to it, and my jobs are takeing a lot of time and energy out of me and I've been a lil sick the past few weeks. Also last thing thats on my mind that I will post here, I officially anounce this to me the last halloween party at my house. Well, at this house, cuz I will not be liveing here nor doing anything much here next oct. So lets try to make this year a good one. I'm trying kinda hard to get stuff for it and even thats been hard to do. thats my last post for a while. So there ya go.

 OKay, I talked to Kelly today in spanish club, and Cream-O-Land is a go. ^^ Also, we have our place between the gym doors. And I have our $10 for Dry Ice in my agenda. So we're a go! ^^ I would really really REALLY opresate it if you guys get Katy and Tegan's e-mails (or if you have them give them to me. Dest- the pirate one didn't work) so we can add them in blogger. (You know I'll forget to ask them ^^;) Blogger could really help up organize things like today, everyone knows the name. And know when people get stuff; glitter, ect. And are done stuff. We have lass then three weeks to get this together but I know we'll do it. Go team! --- There is no 'I' in team...but there is a 'me' if you look close enough ^^;

 Go Bobicus!

 WEE! ^^

 i liked commercial #1. and . . . . . BOO! and i'll do something for the caption contest and whatever else. . . . eventually. . . . sometime. . . . maybe. . . . .

 The second one was funnier. XD Hehehehe!

 TK! ANSWER QUESTIONS! *eye twitches* Anyway, half way thru Virginia, the teen titans came into my head and I made commercials for Reality Bound based off them ^^ Commercial #1: Annoncer: Coming soon to Cartoon Network! Meet Meta (Meta: At a cafe, winks at a guy passing. "yo!") Snarky (Snarky: *fire in the background* You wanna meet me frying pan?!) TK (TK: *with Meta and Snarky* Egad!) Baby Gomamon (BG: *at the table* Leggo my Legolas) Mouse (Mouse: *in stairway* Lets adopt him! *points at random Charter guy*) And Bobicus (Bobicus: Thats it, your blessed!) Annoncer: They come together to fight crime and the forces of evil! oh, wait. Wrong show. BG: Dude, We are the forces of evil! TK: See? Kackis! Kackis! Annoncer: Reality Bound. An all new show, premiring this Saturday at 9. Only on Cartoon Network. Commercial #2: Annoncer: This Satuday, at 9, Cartoon Network as an all new show! Reality Bound! David: *at the table* Yeah...we were going to be stars...but we were too lazy. *fast foward* Dest with hearts for eyes Kim slapping TK upside the head Dorito Tegan and Katy Robyn blessing people Drake chasing TK with a chair Katy hugging her potato Dressed as pirates Link Orlando Dest as Nightcrawler Tai and David with heart eyes, cheering the football team on Rigby losing his hair Zogby snapping at the screen *normal speed* Tai: *blinks* That all went over my head. TK: Of course it did. your so short! Tai: Hey! Annoucer: Reality Bound. Premires this Saturday, Only on Cartoon Network. Told ya I was bored. ^^

 right i'm here, perhaps this should have waited until i had something of importance to post... ooh, i know! YOU CAN NOT CLAIM MARS AND SELL SECTIONS OF IT TO HUMANS! THIS IS AN OUTRAGE! okay, i'm down, bye.

 It's official, for in favor of Hallows Eve, I an now putting a prize on the caption contest. What is it? i dunno. Haven't gotten it yet ^^; But I will tonight. And it will Hallows Eve nefty.

 O.O;;; I come back to this?! *bangs her head on the keyboard* BG- Taped? Whu? Y7? Whats that stand for? (Butt-Shots! WOO!) Bobicus- Sed? Meta- You did good. except you didn't answer much ^^; U wanna do anything to your profile? Or how about some senior memories? And what is with the BOOs? Boos from Bobicus, Boogas from BG, oi! It's not Hallows Eve yet! *sniff* I never got to do my "Greetings From" thingy. *cries* I found the AOL trailer on Friday but the driver who runs the AOL car decided to sign there and I couldn't use the computer and it was too far way from the infield and and and... GREETINGS FROM CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA! WOOIE! Okay, I feel better ^^;;;

 BOOOOOOOOGA!!! The person sending me weird e-mails is creeping me out. oO;; I know David is going to kill me for talking about this, but SOMEONE neeeeeeeds to answer me! *ducks* WHY THE FRIG IS YUGIOH RATED Y7?!?!?!?! I mean, COME ON!!! They were giving us WAY to many Marik butt-shots on saturday. >D *ducks again* And people strip... I haven't been online a lot recently, but I still post here when I get on. :D

 O and Kim I think the reason everyone stopped comeing here is cuz this was our place to talk at times when we couldn't like over summer, when we don't see each other everyday, or wlel most of us didn't haha, but now, we see, and talk to each other all day long and ... well.. when were tired, home on the comp.... if we make it that far.... theres nothing left to say, as for caption contest.... I still have nada to say for it.... how about this caption "Damn, hasn't this pirate things worn out by now... I liked it better when everyone called me siscor hands and asked me to cut bonsi trees...."

 O, btw, did we ever decide what were doing about the site, buying a name or whatever..... when will that happen? Has is happened? Hmmmm.....

 mOO...mooo... I'm tired, working, blah balh blah.... la di da, and all that shit. So Gnome has a play tonight, Me and Tk gotta go, some of us also have sats tommarow, grrr, ah well.... So... hm.... what to say, I should go eat my lunch, but umm... no Im here. Writeing..... what toi write what to write,... HI!

 What kim said confussed me? name shouting, humiliation, hint..... So did I do good, or should I say screw it all? I don't know!!! O I added the internet to my comp at work today, so at least every sat. on my break I can post for shure..... since no one comes to eat lunch with me any more :(... At least I get to eat with Tanya Steph and Liz hehe Hope your haveing fun in ... Wherever Kim....

 ^_____^ I taped it!! MWAHAHAAA! I mean, urm. I know you don't care. -_-; Never Mind.

 Hey all! Greetings from... *looks around* where the hell are we? o! harpers ferry, West Virginia. Just a quicky stop to dump and to rest here at the KOA. Then we're off to Charolette, NC. Mom's dancing behind me cause she won tickets to be in the infield during the race. > Yeah, Thanks Meta for posts in thoughts!!! Now see, if you all did that, I would shout your name on here and humilate you too. Don't you want that? (hint hint you do) I gtg. rest over. see you all monday!

 Me and Tk watched a movie tonight about Giant Evil penises from space!!!!!!! It'll give me worse night mares then glowly inny outy things..... They were penises with ... eyes, and rows of teeth, and they likes to bites guys dicks off and if ya wana know aht i am talking about watch the Movie Dream Catcher. They are Evil penises I Swear!!!!! Also me and Robyn Read a very wrong Book Today. Hey Bobicus... My genitals are starting to smell funky, is this normal??? Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha Inside joke from the book..... It was of sex questions no one really should ever Ask. FO course it did have a big page long explaination of herpes I was gonna photo copy for Tk lol Also, I'll do the caption contest when I think of soemthing but right now I'm really tired. Also, good on fixing the site, and adding all our memories is a good idea but everyone remember, don't post up your senior memories that you put in the year book, well not word for word, just to make things clear, cuz I think those will be best read when the books comes out. But do post anything u didn get to add and all moments that you want in memories.... did that make sense. Ah well..... Ummmm. ummmm..... Time Line, ah yeah.... we'll get to it.... maybe one day after coffee.... but since someone never wants to hang out with us anymore no wonder we don't get anything done...... especially now that I work all the time. ::Eats the left over mozzarella stix from tonight:: Anything, else any thing else??? I think Not, ttyl, need to go to bed, 14 hour work day tommarow!!!!

 OKay Guys. Very important! I'm going through and updating everything on my site. Mainly because Bobicus wanted her nickname so I'm do it for all of us. however there will be a key on the bio page. However, look at this list: D, you and I still have to finish the timeline. Quote have been updated yesterday, I haven't gotten today's in yet The Wee Book. Are we going to start this again or is this a lost cause? Senior Memories. Everyone give me their so I can put them up on the site. Try to think back to when you first because part of the group. Anything and everything goes! Websites. I need updated links! Pictures, Dest I need you to draw T, KT, Rhandi, Jordan and Hiller for their bios. Caption Contest people! It's an easy one!!! Villians! Are there any I missed? Rigby, Drake, Hiller, Swann, Zogby, and Becky Bios. Anyone want to change or add to their bios? And I think that's it. i know I'm being a pain in the ass, but I need this stuff so the site looks cool! site being: http://www.geocities.com/demonangelwolf/realitybound or just click urlLink Here Thanks you guys. now I'm off to Charoltte...tomorrow morning ^^;

 Wow, it's so you BG ^^ Me! \/ -Perfect- You're the perfect girlfriend. Which means you're rare or that you cheated :P You're the kind of chick that can hang out with your boyfriend's friends and be silly. You don't care about presents or about going to fancy placed. Hell, just hang out. You're just happy being around your boyfriend. urlLink What Kind of Girlfriend Are You? brought to you by urlLink Quizilla oO;;; Anyway, Hey D. Sorry I got on you earlier. If you had to deal with Jared too, I think you'd be more cranker than me ^^; I love you! I really really do ^^ I love you so much that you don't have to pay me back! Yup Yup ^^ ...iforgettoreturnaphotothingytofhosiitwashereonthedeskandiforgotitandnowidon'tknowwhattodo... I LOVE YOU! ^^;;;

 -Not- You're...not girlfriend material. Not because you'd be a bad girlfriend, but because you're not in the mindset to be one. You're childish and silly.

 -^ ^- I'm sorry, I'm such a pant stealer. For those who don't know (are absent or Gnome) Connor has asked to leave the table. He wants to be with people his own age. We are letting him go. Why? Cause he hasn't seemd to be part of the group since Dest broke up with him. *shrugges* Thoughts, Questions, Comments? No good.

 BTW, everyone I had to order your x-mas presents this year, but since i've had no time to till lately, they will be shipped really late, like may not get here till january, so you'll prolly get my preants late this year, depending on when they ship, you know chirstmas chipping is slow as fuck, grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr. It'll be worth it though.

 they schedualed me at 3 on friday, even If we didn have the Feast I couldn't do that cuz I work at foshi then... so I am calling out no matter what, So the feast is on!

 ps- I got fleas in my room. :( And I have to go for training in about 40 minutes

 Well, what should I do with RB now? I have a writers block! We get to the island and janine floats by being chased by a shark and somehow beowulf comes and jumps into the water and drowns or something...

Dest needs to draw you in RB form, then perhaps I'll get it right. Speaking of Dest *hinthint* Your lucky I probably won't see you tomorrow, otherwise I'd be bugging you about coloring and clothing and everything that I need for pirate adoptables! O! Speaking of tomorrow, since you guys probably won't have a very good show, it being our first time putting things together (*eye twitchs* Tornado watch my @$$!) Perhaps you all should come to the Saturday night (7pm) performance and see us all at our best! And Support your Snarky! This is my last Showstoppers! *sniff sniff*

 WEE! *dances in a circle* I got honors! *stops and actually thinks about it* woh...i did good... ^^ Yes! Where were you slackers! We should have stolen TK's report card from Hanel, Bobicus. ;P Underwater cows? is this a quote I should put up? And why do I get the image of a drawing that Dest would do with a Cow swimming with swimming goggles and that snokle thing? Oo; Anyway... THANKSGIVING!

 David.... sooooooo tacky. good point though. still, . , . , not aware of what we were doing so doesn't count. and snarky... it's still following , but she's following you. and *poof* i am so sick of steak. i think i'm going on a beef strike for the next week or so. yup. strike it is. TURKEY DAY!.. yes, still 2 weeks away, i know. Don't care. still happy for turkey day. i need ice cream . . . . with sprinkles. and a cookie(not with the ice cream). .... can anyone tell i just ate dinner? ... * * *final POOF * * * gone

I'll show you where...... ::creeps down the dark hall:: ::walking:: ... . . . ::walking::. .. . . . . . .::and were scrolling... and still scrolling::: ::sign says cool stuff ahead, we keep walking::: ..... and thats all it took to make you all my followers. I AM JESUS!!!!!!!!!!!!! lol Hear me Meep!!!!!!

 no, 'cause I'd make sure she next to me ^^ :p

 wouldn't being dragged around make someone a follower? ...... *poof!*

 I'ma leader not a follower. D's a leader too. And I drag Dest around so technically she isn't a follower either. Assia just randumly comes and goes so she's not a follower. Bobicus too, here there everywhere poof. Tai has too many Boyfriends to be a follower. Tegan will whack you if you even try and say she's a follower. So I guess you army consists of Katy and Connor. Poor You.

 *Voice of Hamsterveil* why do i not have an army!? i want a list of my follower's screen names sent to me or i will be forced to say nasty things to your face! .........................please?

 .... *e-wacks TK* Yeah! So.. ^^;; o! I had this dream last night about all of us at school at the table and yeah. It was really funny. We're chases by Zogby and Clack with sticks. *nods* it was so scary. O! It was funny cause it sounded like one of our quotes, but anyway, we were at the table and I go "That's it! I need the thingy!" Everyone: ... *looking around nervous* Me: "NO! The other thingy!" Everyone: "O!" ^^; anyway, going now. HAPPY BIRTHDAY TK!

 these puny humans shall soon meet their fate! the time has come to form my army! go forth and gather followers of the mighty TK-thian empire! MWA HA AHA HA AHA HA HA HA HA!!!

 My god, no one's here... Anyway, WAY TO GO TEAM! even though the wall fell and the lights fells and we couldn't get the dry ice and the lights were all messed up and and and...i swear a feather went up my nose!!! > Anyway, we look great. Cheers to Reality Bound and Club Creme!

 no resolution's for me this year. nadda. however, if everyone would stop calling me mannish(and mansly, and manly, and so on..) that would be nice... but, i can't control that sooooooooo . . . ...winter break is half-over ... *frown* ... - - - and your going to ireland for spring break? - - - no fair.

 What's everyone doing for new years? David and me trying to figure this out, he's sitting on my floor reading about the TNBC game coming out for PS2. Anyway, adios!!

 It's not Christmas because no one is in the spirit. No one is feeling giving or happy. All they care about is shop shop shop and decorating their house etc. Can't we all just pause for a minute and tell anyone, "merry Christmas." Or Jesus loves you or something!

 D told me he would post the assignment up here about 10 tonight. No fret Bobicus. He has it.

 Snarky's Restraunt Report: Tonight's place - Jose's Border Cafe (The place on the way to Christanna Mall with the huge "EAT" sign) Atmosphere: Lots of noise and loud colors. Very lively place. Wait time at peak: 40-45 minutes Food: Very, very hot! If you like spicy stuff, you'll love this place. (Personally, I don't like hot stuff, and tacos shouldn't be hot!) Drinks: Very, Very nice Margaritas. (*grins*) Prices: Low for both food and drinks, probably the reason there are tons of people there all the time. Kids?: Yes, there are tons of kiddies and there are two kids menus (lil and big) Rating (1-10): Food: 5, Over all: 6-7

 i am not obsessed with shatner.. he's just so mockable.. i find it amusing. ..and give up on the assignement.... d doesn't have it.. i asked. unless he finds it by tommorow we are doomed... kinda.

 Shark-bait: Well, if you need help with circus stuff, look at us. Especially TK, he's such a fat clown. And I can say that 'cause he never come on here. Meta: Take a deep breath. Only a few more months and you and TK are moving down to the beach, right? Bobicus: I get the money thing. If you fail you get a penalty type thing, it's cool. We'll help you pass. And, why are you obsessed with Shatner? ALSO META : Bobicus and I both need the assignment so please just post it here. And we'll pray that he'll accept them on Monday/Tuesday. Gnome: LOL suicide gnomes!

 http://www.weeklyworldnews.com/news/index.cfm?instanceid=60546 This is going TOO FAR!!! I AM NOT A TERRORIST!!! Not fair me. But anyway, ya'll call me and figure things out for this performance tonight, if anyone's going....... I'm home, anyway, so yeah......... ~*~sigh~*~ Oh, and work schedule. Screw it, I don't feel like going downstairs to get it. Anyone start NQ II yet? Anyone going to? See ya'll kids Sunday, if I don't see you sooner.

 and you people should feel VERY lucky. i was THIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIS close to put a picture of william shatner on here for absolutely no reason at all.

 i need that killhefer paper info! .... if ANYONE has the information for that hideously dumb, annoying, waste of my time, pain in the rearend(*you know what i meant) assignment. ironically enough ... killhefer has my darn(*) paper and my whole freakin' notebook. on the good side of things however... i am going to get straight A's for the third marking period. you people get to help keep me in line. if i don't get all A's at the end of the third marking period you each get 5 bucks( except gnome. what? it's understandable enough .) oh... and since that 5 dollars seems like an insentive for you guys to let me fail.... if i do get all A's you each get a dollar. ( gnome - you might actually get a dollar if i pass.... maybe. ) yes i will put the cash stuff in writing .... signatures, all the particulars, ya da ya da ya da... and somebody please find a copy of that god foresaken, useless, piece of crap(*) paper for killhefer for me.... enough ranting.. i have to finish getting ready for work. almost at car .... so close

 Ok... I am about to snap.... I've reach my point of agression again.... I'm done.... I can not lie here any more.... I can't keep being bullshitted out of my life.... I can not just be so disapointed in these people and so resenting of these people and look at them every day any more... I'm seriouse.... i'm to a its them or its me point.... let me back track.... they put furniture again in the liveing room.... and that was my last personal spot besides my room in the house.... they sit out here, watch tv, talk all loud to me, fight with each other and me next to me.... won't let me get to the comp. when I need to any more... I mean I need this shit for school and work now and I can't get on it when I need and when I can I can't work cuz I can not sit and work with a tv in my ear and someone bitching at another.... I'm thinking.... David... Your only 17 for a few more months... a few more months you can me tried as a minor..... I don't know I'm just sooooo built up anger from this week rebubbleing.... but seriousely as I reach the end... I also reach my breaking point... either I'll turn 18 and leave, kill someone, or kill myself... which one will come first.... I'm fine anywhere else with any one else..... I need... out.... and I've run out of options..... I could get a loan and get a place, but I'm to young.... or I could ..fuckin.... put more money in to my room.... get a comp. and microwave and my own line so i really don't have to get out... but that'll take a few more months.... I don't know if I have that long.... I want jess dead... i want it now.. Any one have space in their house for 5-6 months.... anyone?? Tk... I know you do!!!!

 as far as i'm concerned malcolm definately died in macbeth.. at least that's what i'm gonna tell swann..... oops. and do you think my parents would notice if i just burned my next report card? ...ugh.

 dirty evil bad people who get their exam make-up day. Charter's like, "Meh, fuck you kids. Work it out with your teachers to take them after-school. Yeah, you'll get zeroes on your report cards, but its ok, colleges won't notice." bloody twits. Mrf. hmm, at 10: 48, i would be in...third period, which is history, which is room 2...something. but thats lober's class, and if you were to run into it and attack me, she would eat you. honestly. she's a moo-bitch. OOF. I have to start history-day. We are doing our performance on Travelling circuses, sideshows, and burlessque houses of the 20's and 30's and the effect they placed upon media, both past and present. Shoot. Me. please?

He has it so blame him, not me. ...at least I don't think I have it... But I shall look in my black hole and see if it's there. gtg to my voice lesson. Meta, the button up there, SPELL CHECK!

Or you can say "I'll take you there and bring you home, Gnome" and I can give you directions from inside the car (hopeful).

 destinie's being so produtive. ... i made waffles - - - is that being productive, or just hungry? o well, i'm off to make more waffles.

 I just dug out my agenda book and found some: TK: I wanted to make postcards for my room, but I thought it would be weird to have a picture of my bed on the back saying, "Wish you were here". TK: Destinie, Pharoahs didn't wear pleather pants, either. TK: I'm going to have 28 sons...all of them boys. Assia: No one calls Fat Tony a pigeon... Crooo! TK: I'm okay with Herpes, just give me the lollipop. Tegan: I like Random elves, they're fun. Tegan: It's a side of Destinie I've never seen before- TK: The Fortune Cookie Side! Tk: Streakers should not play with nails. Tk: Why is it called Homecoming if I have to leave my home to get there? Destinie: ... And then the chickens said: "It was workin' for the cows!" Everyone else: ...................................................................................................... (That would be us in Art Class o_O) And we can't forget... The Hanel Ho-down: Swing your partner left to right Draw tin foil in the light Kick 'im in the shins, like you're mad Then put on a shirt that's plad Jump around like your free Talk about your A.D.D

 OMG I AM SO BORED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am drawing a contest entry for a club on DA but I'm bored! Omg- Snarky! I NEED THE LEXG COMIC BACK! IT'S THE LIBRARY'S!! And yay! X3 I got this book and I really should start reading it. It's about a half-vampire and a half-elf and they slay vampires. o_O; I FINISHED THE REALITY BOUND ANNIVERSARY PICTURE! OMG! Hey! Look what snow days do for me! I finished my parody, part 2, rb pic, and I'm finishing the pirates as soon as I get over this writer's block thingie. Yeah. All the little kids were against me: Destinie: Please hold off the snow so that I can finish my mid-terms GOD! All the little kids: GOD! LET IT SNOW FOREVER PLEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASE!! GOD: Sorry Destinie, Majority rules. Destinie: Oh poo.

 If anyone is up for a good laugh or finding out why people say if you look back at what you thought years ago you'd be embarrassed, could you take a look at the quote page ( urlLink Here! ) and tell me if I made any mistakes. Like I misspelled something or have ; instead of : Those kind of things. I'm updating later, so yeah. Thanks!

 And again... no school. Are we ever going to take the last two mid-terms? This does mean a four day (five for Snarky!) weekend. If they let us take the tests tomorrow and make-up is friday. Anyways, glad you liked the quote ^^ I'm going to go play on neo now.

 ::dies:: best. quote. ever.

 charter closed... good for moo. anyway.. tv stinks this early... no wonder i'm usually asleep now... i'm sure not missing anything. thank god for snowdays though..maybe today i'll actually read macbeth... then again... maybe not. and needless to say ..... interesting quote - - has anyone seen my phone? - it appears to have disappeared.

 ooo, and before i forget. I just have to put this quote on here, I think some of you might find it funny. (it's from a fanfic! ^^) ~ "How many fingers am I holding up," Daniel asked, trying to gauge Jack's current level of intoxication. "Seven," Jack said, squinting mightily. "I'm only holding up one hand." "Yeah? So what's your point?" "My point is that you should just proceed directly to passing out," Daniel said sharply. "Do not pass go, do not collect the archaeologist's ass." "Awww," Jack complained. ~ *giggles insanely*

 aww, poor shark-bait. And damn-it! I wanna take the mid-terms and get it over with!!! BTW, Dest. I got the beast boy one. That is so us. I only got it 'cause he turns into a wolf on the cover ^^ And I got a big Nightwing comic booky thing and one of the New teen titans where they fight JLA and Nightwing has to break it up. ...I like Nightwing! So sue me! :p You know, I havn't been online at all the past 4-5 days >

 WTF, Charters Open, unless they call it off within the next hour or 2... poor Andy :(

 YAY ANOTHER DAY OFF!!! WHOO HoOOOO!!!! Its nice to be a senior.... no makeing this up....

 Oh, another thing. I figured that it would be a good idea to post my work schedule on here since I never know when I'll be home. Or, just because I'm strange. Tuesday: off Wednesday: 2-9:30 Thursday: off Friday: 12-4, show 6:30-11:30 Saturday: 12-4, show 6:30-11:30 Sunday: off Hehehe. That's great. I'm gonna go eat now, and call my boyfriend. Love ya'll kids.

 mewmew!! Gnome has returned! And due to the snow, she got off work all early and stuff today. Coolies. Gonna go call the boyfriend in a bit. I just wanted to tal kto all of you,oh and give directions for my show. Well, I can't find them. I'll search. I can't find the address to the theatre. I will later. Anyway. $5 for ya'll that are under 18 $10 for everyone else. The shows are: One about these stupid doctors on their first day. One about a ghost that talks to a guy who's trying to commit suicide because he's pregnant. One is about these actors that suck and a critic that is an asshole. Then intermisson. Then there's one about a cat turned into a woman and the scientist that made her. One's about two kids that are waiting for Santa. Then mine. Four women meet in a liposuction clinic and share their stories with each other. Anyway, you're allowed to bring your own drinks and food and such. it's a quaint little theatre. Talk to you kids later.

 http://www.petitiononline.com/mrphelps/petition.html (Casper, Wyoming) Anti-gay preacher Fred Phelps has announced intentions to erect a monument to Matthew Shepard the gay college student brutally murdered five years ago near Laramie. But, the monument will be no memorial. Phelps says the monument would be 5 to 6 feet tall and made of marble or granite. It would bear a bronze plaque bearing the image of Shepard and have an inscription reading "MATTHEW SHEPARD, Entered Hell October 12, 1998, in Defiance of God's Warning: 'Thou shalt not lie with mankind as with womankind; it is abomination.' Leviticus 18:22." The monument would be erected in downtown Casper, Shepard's home town. Phelps has sent details of the monument to the city of Casper city council and there may be nothing the city can do to prevent it. Phelps said he intends to put up the monument in City Park, already the location of a controversial statue of the Ten Commandments. The Ten Commandments statue was donated to the city by the Fraternal Order of the Eagles in 1965. After a court battle over a similar monument in the city of Ogden, the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that any city that displays a Ten Commandments monument on public property must also allow monuments espousing the views of other religions or political groups on that same property. Phelps told Casper council in his letter that if it attempts to prevent him from erecting the homophobic monument he's prepared to go to court. "That is exactly what I said would happen," said Councilwoman Barb Watters. She said she warned the city when it accepted the Ten Commandments statue that the city risked other monuments advocating anti-Semitism and hatred of other minorities. "I think the hate language will find a very cold reception in this community," councilor Paul Bertoglio said. "I think this community's backbone is going to come up and say 'We are not going to accept it.'" The city council is looking at several options, one is fighting Phelps in court, another is moving the Ten Commandments out of the park, and yet another proposal would be to sell the land the park is on. Phelps says he doesn't care what the city decides. If he is unable to put the statue in City Park he said he will find another location in the city. During Shepard's funeral members of Phelps' Westoboro Baptist Church demonstrated in front of the chapel. Article 365Gay.com, 2003

 Poor Snarky. I called you this AFTERNOON but you were asleep and I had the english info for you: Samuel Taylor Coleridge. =_= I'm sleepy today. I couldn't sleep either. (SUGAR HIGH!!) I went to bed at... 12:30-1am?? I got up at 8 and laid in bed. Blah. Went to church and he talked about Hell. Nice, huh? I think that quiz needed more results so we all won't repeat. Some of the answers didn't fit me well, I think. "Oops, I dropped 5,000 Yen..." "I will curse you so that everytime you go to the bathroom there will be no paper and you will have to wipe with the color inserts from your favorite magazines!!!!" Bwahahahaaaaaaaaaa! ^.^

 ugh...I can't sleep. I keep thinking about Gnome's wizard topic and David's "I will swim till I fall" song by the guy with the alto 1 voice who's name I currently can't remember. Anyway, I'm laying here and I'm like, "okay, I need to take my mind off this topic. I know, I'll go watch Stargate." 'Cause during the day everyone else is either watching my Stargate dvds or one the computer which is currently the only comp. with a dvd drive (the other one's drive won't open for some reason o -;) Anyway, I'm half asleep and forming this plan, "I can sleep during the day and do my outlines tomarrow night..." when I suddenly hear the steps creak. Like someone is going down them and is trying to be quiet but they can't do it and hitting the gate at the bottom sure as hell isn't quiet or sneaky. Anyway, who ever it was went into the parent room (parent room- orginally was the guest room until Danny got his toys everywhere in the living room and you really couldn't live in it so we fixed the guest room up with the rule of no toys allowed and the room with said computer above.) > urlLink Which Pirates of the Caribbean character are you?

 ugh, I need to take Dest's quiz, and go to Shark-Bait's links, and I will, just not now. Snarky ish busy (that is not a typo). I need to know what people want to do about a .com domain. Well, do we want a .com, .net, or.org domain? The resone I bring this up is 'cause we're running out of room on geocities. I don't think we could get one more comic on. We could get another geocities name and store the comics on there or we could get a domain, but we have to pay. Personally I think getting another geocities would be best for now, considering we haven't really done anything. Oh! I was reading Megatokyo (vol. 2) and Saw they do a monday, wednesday, and friday update. They're short 4 to 6 panel comics, and I remember we wanted to try that but...never did. Mostly to lack of plot. Do we wish to try this again or should we stay with the long comics? (speaking of which, I need to scan LOTR... *looks at scanner* ... *looks at the over a hundred pages in a floder waiting to be scanned* ...later...) If we do do weekly(once, twice, three times whatever) , we could do real life stuff like we ment to at the beginning. *~*~*~* Example: Snarky: A year ago, you couln't mention the word "Pokemon" without Meta going on an endless rant that usually ended up with two or more people comitting suicide to make the noise stop. Snarky: However, after one beach trip on new years eve, i think something changed that. *Snarky, Meta, and Shark-Bait are on a bed, each with gameboy advances, Meta and Snarky are linked by a game cable* Snarky: *blink blink* he..beat me... - -; Meta: *grins* My *enter pokemon here* beat your *enter pokemon here*'s ass! Snarky: *looks at Shark-Bait* Shark-Bait: O O *in pain* Snarky: You better get off him or you won't be getting your prize tonight. *~*~*~* A sad true story. ^^; Anyway, questions, concerns and comments?

 well Des-des, i have one in a book about the death of king arthur. how he was influenced by myth? what do you mean? like, Lady of the Lake type, or Merlin, or what? ::confuzzled:: and yeah celtic peoples have had influence on british literature. Do you need like authors, or ways they influenced?

 To Sharkbait: Just stuffie about how Celtic myths may have influence King Arthur and also if Celtic peoples had influence on any other british literature stuff. Pease and Tank you!! *glompage* To Everyone else: Take my pointless quiz!! My mom bought a Gameboy advance. o_O; We got the Zelda game which is the same as the snes one...which I never beat because it kept erasing on me. T_T

 *giggles insanely* Big Sis: Today were going to talk about MeTa's wurmple, Dick! Dick seems to get a lot of loving care. The trainer had to only throw this many balls to catch it:1! Big Bro: Then to give it the nickname, Dick. You get a good sense of the trainer's sense. Big Sis: Dick the Wurmple? Doesn't that sound perfect? *contunues to giggle insanely*

 Dessie-chan what do you need to know about Arthur and the Celts? Myth? I can help with myths if you need.

Anyway, I have something for reality bound... an idea. *cough cough sputter cough dies* ............... *comes back to life* In egypt: Destinie comes up to Kim wheeling a wheelbarrel with a giant brick. Kim: What is that? Destinie: A brick. Kim: I see that. WHY DO YOU HAVE A BRICK?! Destinie: Some guy traded it to me. He said it had magic powers. Kim: !!!! .... What did you trade?!?! (Sees the guy walk by with a gold ring thing around his neck) Kim: NO NO NONONONONNOOOO! COME BACK!!! ARG!
