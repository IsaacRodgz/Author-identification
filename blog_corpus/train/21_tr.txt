 It's now 8:40 pm, and I am sort of still recovering from last night. I went to a fundraising party at a dance school. We stayed there until the metro opened. We were: Eugene "The Dance God", Audrey "The Straight Hair", Sarah "The "That Face Again"", Andrei "The Ultimate Chessmaster" and me. It was pretty cool: the obscure stuff that we drunk made us sing and dance all night. We went home at 7 am. I called Andrei two times already, but he is still asleep (it's been 12 hours, hello?!! :) Oh, yeah, Sarah. Poor her. She is new to our crazy bunch. Sarah, you rock! I am glad that I have such a wonderful new friend. (this last word will clear out the misconception that might have taken place lately :) Anyway, yesterday's party coincided with nice news for me. I got the admission offer from McGill and am going to start pursuing a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering next fall. I think I am going to take a minor in software engineering. I am also planning on taking part in the Provincial Physics Contest in April. Wish me luck!

 Ok, so I am getting there (in terms of redoing this whole thing). The nav menu is almost ready. None of the buttons works so far. Drop by tomorrow.

 Hi vladster.net is currently in the process of a complete redesign. There will be some flash and other fancy stuff. There will also be a new page dedicated to nonsense we hear every day (no offence to sensitive readers:). So far I will only put my own impressions. I'm also giving the blogger a second chance. urlLink Daily Log Archive

 I was listening to an old song yesterday, which made me remember my grandparents' huge old house where all the relatives used to get together for holydays and weekends. I was just a little kid then, and I am now starting to realize how much it all meant to me. There was this song. Somehow, it was always in the background, even when it was quiet. I remember my mother playing piano in that house and myself desperately trying to catch up on the accordion, thus ruining the whole thing. I remember jumping into the snow hills in the back yard from the balcony with my cousin. It was such a pure airborne sense of happiness... the ultimate bliss. We would then run to the kitchen and eat pancakes with honey and hot tea. I can clearly see my uncle's room with the Aeroflot posters all over the place. He was just a rookie co-pilot then. Many of the people I remember from that time have now spread all over the world; some died. The house has been sold along with the piano and all the happiness once reigning inside. Yeah, I know, life goes on. Damn, I would give everything I have now to bring that time back for just a minute! Nothing is so close and yet so unreachable to us than our past.

 Hey ppl! Tell me how much you hate the new layout.

 PriMat, the last day of classes on Tuesday is Friday's schedule.

 Hi ! I geeked out for 4 hours doing weird math and physics and now I'm here to tell you that I'm sorta bored and tired. Also, what are these juicy details anyway ? And, yeah, I've heard that on some date we follow a different schedule, like a Friday is going to be Monday, or something like that ? When is it ppl, cuz I don't have an agenda this semester.

 Exams? What exams? What is "study" anyway?! Ok, seriously, I need to get those ass'ts done as soon as possible, otherwise I'm f&#ked, big time. There is so much stuff to be written that I am seriously considering starting studying after two years of slacking-off. Man, she wants juicy stuff. How about going first you little pervert? ;) We'll catch up. We could start a whole thread, put a password on it and grant access to whoever we think appropriate. Just joking of course :). P.S. Mr. The Chessmaster is getting the award for an outstanding contribution to student life! He is too ... hmm... SHY to brag about it, but that's what i'm here for. Yo the MAN, Andrei! Keep it up. Nu, teper' vsya utka nasha!!!

 Man I want some juicy stories. C'mon people detalis!!!

 Yo, what's going on everyone! nobody posts anything on the site anymore. Do you guys have news or something to say? Anyways, I`m just wandering how you guys are doing; I have a little bit of free time today. Now, I'm going back to "study" physics, becuase there is a pretty girl sitting there (perhaps I should study chemistry instead). Good luck on your exams, people!

 What a boring day it was! I can't wait for the weekend. It's going to be a change finally. On the other hand, it might suck just as badly. We'll see. I have an unbeatable desire to say something profound and/or philosophical, but I just won't bother. Gotta go home.

 By 'collective description' I imply a collection of phrases, opinions etc. Anyway, it's way too early to talk about it yet. Have to go study.

 Collective description - cool idea, but in what form it will be posted? Cows, smiles, planes or ....? :^)

 I got some good news (actually, it depends). There is a new layout coming soon. It will be even more simle and clear. Perhaps, it will look a bit similar to that at the urlLink blogvoices .com. I am really obsessed with clarity, simplicity and alike lately. There is also going to be a new section. In there I will post the ever-expanding list of this blog's members (of course with their permission). Below each member's nick there will be a collective description of that person consisting of others' opinions about him/her. It is all expected to go online around May 15 - the last day of classes at Vanier. Oh, man, I just can't wait! Let me know what you think.

 Hurray! Everything is fixed now!

 hmm...was my previous message posted or not ? something wierd is going on, I guess it's all about that server migration.

 hum...

 For Russian-speakers here: �������������� ���������� ������ �� �������� ������������� ���������������. Fro non-Russian speakers: It is just a funny example of overly heavy vocabulary. [you need to set the encoding to "Cyrillic (Windows)" to see the text properly]. Audrey, try that one.

 Man, I'll probably think twice about what I said previously :). "Life is good. Please enjoy it, while it lasts." [ DMX - Ain't No Sunshine ] Note: The site will be unavailable this weekend due to the server migration (not my fault). We will still be able to post in the blogger with one slight difference: press the POST button instead of Post&Publish. And the last thing for today. I got an award. Sorry, I just have to brag about it :). It's called "The Alan Liddlard Memorial Award for Oustanding Academic Achievements and a Significant Contribution to Student Life". Oh, yeah baby!!!! VIVA THE CHESS CLUB AND THE SCIENCE CENTRE!!! OK now I'll shut up. Good night everybody.

 The urlLink Ultimate Happiness . [click on it please] Imagine flying it while listening to "Only Time" by Enya or, even better, Depeche Mode's "Dream On".

 I got it, but who needs total control? What I'm persuaded in is that we all do equally stupid things sometimes. It's a quite dull subject to argue about anyway. The thing I can't figure out is why is it more fashionable to keep all your stuff inside, not to let anybody know what's on your mind? Why is it cool to be cold and insensitive? I have been like this for the most of my sensible lifetime, and it proved to be a successful way to get people's attention, respect, love, whatever. I have changed a lot during the last two years and I am finding myself loosing it, loosing control, loosing discipline, loosing friends. I feel I am becoming weaker every minute. Anyways, no sarcastic remarks on this one please. I don't need you to feel compassionate either. I'm just thinking aloud here... And the last narcissistic note for a long time to come: I am comming back, back to being the person I used to be. Andrei, what do you think? Scary eh? Later,

 Ok...ummmm....Ok. Gee I havn't been on the site for a long time. Sweating chicks, battle field, surprises, riddles, insides, apologies on en a de la jasette! Audrey...you know men know they can't live without us. So if you look at this logically, pilots, engineers...whatever wouldn't exist without us. We have the upper hand, total control. And between you and me...girls just don't sweat. Guyz on the other hand bring disgrace to socks and stink up the clubs when they dance. Did you realize that for the last 3 days the posts have been nothing but about gurlz?

 My dear friends, what do you think of celebrating at my friends house this weekend. If the temperature is nice, we could have a nice delicious Brunch! hum...well...if that's ok with her of course!

 I have suprises every day!

 Seriously, Audrey, sorry for making fun of you. :)) Just go there and play! Who cares what they all think/say?

 Who said sweating is legal ? I think ppl who sweat too much must be arrested and prosecuted. Period. And, yeah, watch out guys, watch out for sweating chicks!

 What the heck? Of course there is a problem with women playing soccer! What's next? Women in basketball? Women-pilots? MAn, I don't know where this world is going. We have to really be careful with these chicks. Turn around for a second, and they're already flying to space!!! Watch out guys. Watch out!

 It's almost one...and I feel inspired by Vlad's angry picture! ...I like to run as I please, to jump as I please, to have fun, yell and sweat as I please...which is of course a free and legal way of expressing ourselves. What is the problem with women playing soccer???? Is it a plasure only reserved to men? I think not! You agree, disagree or have valueable arguments or facts that considers women playing soccer impropre, please post it... My inspiration has left me...I shall go to sleep now! :)

 Do you want to see me young and angry? Click urlLink here .

 OK people. It's getting a little sick. We're starting to look stupid. It was a big joke to begin with. Sorry if I have offended anyone. This is the official end of the topic. Should you have any additional comments, please do not hesitate to use the form called "Message vLadster" on my site . Sincerely yours,

 Hmmm...... "I have a question".... What is the issue? Whatever; I think I lost the hole point of what is going on.... hmmm...

 O.k. people, like Mr. Cheeseburger said it's my turn to come into the game. You guys seem pathetic arguing about such an issue over the internet. I mean we all know what you are both talking about. Stop all your deep thinking about choices Vlad and pick the one that comes to you first, naturally. Andrei has a different poimt of view on things and you guys shouldn'd even be discussing such an issue together. Besides the fries and the cheeseburger are to different maels that could be mixed together only if you have some Coke with it. What I mean is that I could solve the problem if you guys need me to (just ask). What I really wanted to say is that I'm back to Montreal from Toronto. Even though Idon't have the best news I'm full of inspiration and especially, like Andrei said once again, it's my turn to sing "lubov zachem ti mouchaesh menia". And by the way Andrei, I am able to save the trio from being completely eaten, because the coke always had the skill called "refill". As to you Sarah, you don't have to mind those two guys. It is ust some kind of late "crise d'adolescence" that their experiencing. You can be sure that Vlad is going to pick the right choice for him and Andrei's opinion will not be the obstacle in his case. Let me just tell you that everyone will end up happy within a short period of time from now. Don't worry and have fun everyone. See ya.

 d00des, u've written so much over the weekend, I just can't keep reading it!

 What the... Andrei, you didn't get the point again. There is no fire. There is no "change of mood". Nothing got me so far. Don't be happy for me. You better take that post seriously for that was what I was thinking. Am I being too imperative? OK, let's quit there. Sarah, if you're confused, that's OK - so is Andrei. :)

 Oops, I guess I took my time eating dinner and some new info appeared before I posted my previous note. Vlad, your mad note made me laugh a lot, because I imagined how ... well let's not get into funny details. :) But anyway, what upseting is that you didn't realize that your answer to my post was more comic then anything else, hehe. Nevertheless, I assume, that from now on, its PARTY TIME on this site, so I'm leaving the birds to show off their feathers:)).

 Wow dudes, it all sounds pretty interesting :)) , but "did I miss something?" . Hehe, I guess I did. :)) Annieway, I think there is a misunderstanding problem here, probably due to the middle of Spring :) You don't have to be sorry, Vlad; I'm not taking seriously what you posted, you were not thinking, rather feeling :). Just don't get emotional over this post too... For everybody else who didn't get my previous post...oh well :) ...do you remember: "Isn't it great to feel alive!!!!" ? :)) hehe. Ahh...Vesna, vesna. Koroche, Vova, kak viju ti menia sovsiem ne ponail. Damn! Wow! Haha, something really got you! Pretty funny, and I'm happy for you :)). (Although, I was pretty astonished by your vivid reaction). Sarah, you rock, eventhough you don't know what you are talking about. It's ok. Vlad, sorry that I wasn't aware of your change of mood lately :), I didn't imagine that it's going to follow the behavour of an exponential function. I'm going to stop here, in order not to spill anymore oil on fire. :) (before it use to be a calm lake...oh dear...!) Once again, WOW, I'm very, very, very impressed! Just hope you made the right choice dude!! Good luck! hehe. :) Sincerely yours, Andrei. P.S. as for battleship statistics: there is only one man left in the sea (I hope) ... the rest of the trio is almost eaten. Mr Coke your turn to sing : ..."luibov', zachem ti muchaesh menia".... :)) (Shuchui, esli ne ponitno). Have fun guys! :))

 This is splendid. I have just come to a striking realization of how amazing our life really is. :o)) (�� ����� ������ �� ����� ���� ����). "...I might get you guyz upset but you can't understand everything..." Sarah, I know exactly what you're saying, but do you think YOU understand everything when it comes to shopping in THE mall? :)) By the way, our Dance God is back from Toronto! Hurrray!

 Ok...you guyz are freeking me out! Did I miss something here? I read the shopping problem , riddle, joke, test whatever it is...ummm is it some kind of practical joke or do you really have to make a chioce Vlad? N-e-wayz if you really want my opinion on this, I'm on the wild side, the 3rd choice is my pick. Live a little, relax. Sorry to let you know this and I might get you guyz upset but you can't understand everything. And the part about the remote control, who needs it! It will keep you on your feet if you have no control at all. Your whole relationship or time spent with this object will be a surprise, something ur looking forward to, or trying to figure out still! It is what stands out! It's what you like, go for it! The two other choices are B-O-R-I-N-G! Luv ya Vlad! Calichickxox

 Well said... Andrei, you know, I will thank God for the rest of my life for not ever having to look at things "through your eyes". You think I'm joking, right? No man, I'm darn serious here. Who the #@&% are you to talk about being "aware of respect"? C'mon, look at you! My goal in representing the situation as the choice between three 'items' was merely to make things simple. It was a free-body diagram, if you will. It did not in any way imply disrespect. Your 'pet' thing, on the other hand, was a great demonstration of YOUR way of thinking. You could at least try to make it look like a joke. Do you at all realize how sick it is? (By the way, dare not edit your post - it's a matter of respect!). Now, on top of it all, you didn't get the main point. What I meant there is not what you call a PROBLEM. There is no problem. I might not buy any of the things right? There is the fourth possibility. Andrei, in any case, thank you very much for your post. You made me make a decision. Sorry for putting you down like that. I just thought I could say what I think. That's what I call friendship anyway. :)

 Well...hmmmm... :) Usually girls have that kind of problems when they go shopping :)). However, if you look at the problem through my eyes, I'm sure you'd find AN answer... Just keep in mind that you're in a "pet" store, not somewhere else :)) [no offence to the pets]. And...hmmm... Try not to think (if you can), simply be aware of respect , and ... don't overflatter yourself :)). Besides, if you're in a shopping mall, than who cares! It's not going to make you compose poems! :)).

 I think I want to write something, but I'm not sure how to put it...OK, listen carefully. Say, you're in a mall and are looking at three different 'items', one of which you can buy. Technically, you could afford all three, but it isn't your style - you never buy more than one when you go to this particular mall. The first thing is cool. It looks extremely nice and is just asking to be bought by you. You know for sure that anyone would buy it if they were you. It sort of suits you and everything, but it is somewhat boring. You can't really think of an occasion where you would REALLY enjoy it. Moreover, you have a funny feeling that you will regret buying it... a really funny feeling. The second item totally corresponds to your style. You can sense your own persona in it. You feel secure with it and, besides, it's doesn't require a frequent maintenance. It seems very reliable, but there is a circumstance that is stopping you from buying. Everybody has a similar kind of thing, and you HATE the crowd. The third one BLOWS YOUR MIND. It is way beyond your comprehension. You don't know if it is what you want/need. You can't even decide whether it is what you like or hate. Yet, you are very attracted to it. You don't get why, but deep inside you have to admit it is true. The more you look at it, the more you want it. It occupies twice as much space in your mind as the other two altogether. However, it is completely out-of-phase with you stylewise. More still, it doesn't come with a warranty of any kind and lacks a remote control. I was just wondering, what would you choose? If you didn't get AT ALL what I'm talking about here, then GO AWAY AND NEVER COME BACK. I don't care who you are. Peace :)

 YES!!!!!!!! I am going to fly a urlLink Piper Seneca tomorrow! Well... not exactly fly, I will observe my dad practicing before the flight test. Holly sh!t, I'm so excited!

 Hey everyone! Today is the 40th anniversary of the first manned flight into space. Congratulations to all humanity and be YURI GAGARIN remembered forever! Now, Audrey is in. I'm sending the invitation to Aster. Welcome gals! Audrey, here's the place for your occasional 'sparks of imagination'. You can even make them regular if you will; I don't mind :))

 O.k., Wednesday 7h15 pm, I'm going to practice. Mary is going to be there, updates tomorrow. Andrei is signing up Audrey. Anyways, I hope that something happens to Andrei today too, I'd like to laugh just as much as Vlad did. I think it's time to go now, because there is lots of girls on the bus at this time, or else Andrei will get them all. (just kidding; never) The news session is posponed till to tomorrow. Bye everyone.

 "make posters of any embarassing info, pics, etc... post them next morning...." That sounds interesting, Californiachick! Did you take a picture of me singing at the dance school by any chance?? I would love to post it! By the way, Sarah, you're going to a party with me on Apr. 28. No, you don't have a choice. Seriously, don't get too excited though :), it's not going to be a date. I just need somebody I know well to go with. Coming back to Andrei. Well... that was quite spectacular! I'm sorry, I just can't help it :))))

 Hey Guyz!!! Before we get all serious with this newsy daily info we should all take an oath. (first put your left hand on the Bible) I promise to never keep secrets to myself, make posters of any embarassing info, pics, grades, etc...*and post them the next morning all over V.C.* I also promise to give money to my fave chick in the group every friday or at least before the weekend. * This exept for Californiachick

 M-da, rojdenni polzat' letat' ne mojet!! Theme: "I hate gravity"; for detials see further postings. P.S. Damn! Jeans were white...and my knee hurts. :)

 Yeah. this blogger feature seems to be pretty cool.. Exams suck, spring is cool, summer is coming. Peace, dudes.

 Oh dear, if only Venus knew that her greenhouse ranaway with effect!!

 Observations from Earth revealed the presence of carbon dioxide in Venus's atmosphere but were inconclusive about other possible constituents. We now know that carbon dioxide is in fact the dominant component of the atmosphere, accounting for 96.5 percent of it by volume. Almost all of the remaining 3.5 percent is nitrogen. Trace amounts of other gases, such as water vapor, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and argon, are also present. Oh my God. I AM TIRED!!! Someone help me. Please. I am dying studying astrophysics here in the IT-Centre all by myself. Oh, no, there's one more near-dead body here... Andrei, are you OK? What? What solar wind?! No, that's the runaway greenhouse effect. Could anybody imagine a runaway greenhouse on Venus?

 He is just kidding huh!

 Good Morning Montreal! Oh my god! I saw such a hot chick, OOPS I mean a young beautifil lady :) just kidding :) /Andrei/

 Great! There are going to be many people posting here soon! I hope it'll work! Alright, I'll go have some sleep now.

 Today was a crazy night studying Astrophysics (hope Don Hetherington will be proud of Andrei and Vlad). But the brightest star on my mind was not one of those in the sky, but the one from the town past Laval. P.S. I almost finished units 4 and 6, Vlad however was stuck on Venus (unit 4).... /Andrei/

 'Projects' section updated. For the first time in my life I think I failed a math (CAL III) test. Not cool... not cool at all.

 Wow! We are the VIPs of the week for organizing the Chess Championship! Pretty cool eh?

 Yes we will vlad, yes we will

 Wow, Tygon. You got me worried here. Forgiveness... I dont' know man - you failed cal3. That's pretty serious stuff. It's intrinsically wrong. We are gonna have to discuss that on June 14's reunion. Until then, I don't know what to do with you... but, rest assured, you won't die; we need you alive... so far that is. I'll let you go for now. Represent!

 To bother everyone with my mishappenings, I ask for forgiveness. So in other stuff, whats up all???? howzit goin?? Mo, ur gonna enjoy france. I'll c u guyz on graduation!! Oh ya that night is gonna kick ass!! See you all I'm out Peace

 Well, well, well........Fate it seems has a twisted sense of irony. It reserves me good tidings and graceful news. I have met Advising and have been said that as I have been taking Organic Chemistry, it shall remplace my Cal3 failure. How refreshing is it to know that my future is still in hand. And to top it off, I shall get a full refund for the Organic Course because it will be considered as a normal semester course. Somewhat of an invinsible weight has been lifted off my shoulders and I am somewhat relieved. But the memory of a failing course is one that still lingers in my mind. True, I do not need that course since i will be attending Cell and Molecular Biology. Therefore an advanced course of Calculus is unnecessary. Though I can guarantee this much, in the near future I shall register for this course and redo Calculus 3 in University. Until then I will be nagged by that unshakable feeling of an unfinished business. So for now, the weather seems right and the mood is good, time to go learn about the hybrids. This is Tygon and I'm out. Peace

 I will go now to Advising to see what they have to say.

 So this is the grand announcement that I have to make. Pacholke has screwed me. And I have failed Cal3, on my graduating semester. It seems that everything that I had hoped for has come crashing down. I hoped to graduate this semester. The hope of graduating now seems dimmer knowing that the registration date for the summer course is over. I can't even get the Dean to grant me late access, because I am already taking Organic Chemistry as a specialization course just for exemption. Mind you I have never failed Organic. But what am i going to do about Cal? It wont suffice my DEC. And that probably means that I will probably have to stay another semester or do something else just for one course. I feel very depressed and suicidal. Never in my life have I failed a course not to mention Math. I have always been on top in Math and I have a natural ability or so I thought. My futur is in stake here and I dont know what path to take now. What I am going to do now? I leave you with sighs of desperation.

 What is this? Summer? I don't think so. I know it's stupid to complain about whatever we can't change, but, damn, I hate this weather! Other than that, everything is moving along pretty smoothly. Don't kill me people, but.... hm... I miss college. Yeah, I really don't know why.

 Hellooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo everyone. First, welcome to Faisal. Ok, summer school sucks, however it's not that bad. And guess what, I'm going to grad anyway poeple. So get ready to party hard and drink yourselves to death. Well not as much. Annnieweiss, Andrei, I'm no longer wishing "Mary" X-Mass to anyone but rather I'm ready for some new stuff (not very new but you know what I mean). I hope we'll see you sometime before Friday night. I think we should all get together sometime soon, and Roman what about basketball. So what's everyone doing this summer? You know, besides basketball, we could make a BBQ party sometime soon as well. I'll try to take care of it and I'll let you guys know. If anybody has other ideas, post it on the site. As the activity director in the Chess Club, I'll be glad to hear. Audrey, what about Spanish and Salsa and stuff. See ya all later and have a nice summer (P.S. Mo if you have a chance to look at the site, tell us how France is)

 Sup people, Waj, sorry i didn't call you, there was no party on monday for various reasons. I'll try to come up with something before this week-end, or after, since for the week-end I'm going to NY!! hehe. By the way people, I'm working, well training, at a rafting place!! At the "rapides de LaChine" , it's soooooo cool and fun!!! I think i got a cold though, since it was raining all the days I wend down the river. (And I had to jump and swim in the river every time my boss is there to show that I "love" COLD water and water sports. Nevertheless it is actually very fun!! What else, well, Faisal... hmmm... interesting stuff :). BTW, Roman do you still want to play basketball anytime soon? If yes we can all get together at my house, there is a basketball court 2 min walk. So call me. See you later.

 Hey Waj, I've looked at the remainders of my notes and found just one test. It's the very first one on tensile stress, bending, torsion etc. I'll be at college (learning centre) tomorrow at around 11-12 am. Come get it if you want. (I spilled some juice on it though :).

 Good afternoon people, How are you all doing on this fine day of stuff? I just finished my physics class, and, MAN, Cowan is a god. The class is really interesting. Hmmm, I think im going through some kind of writers block heheheeh, I dont know what else to say...hmm, oh yeah, umm Vlad, would you mind giving me your tests soon, it would be good practice for the tests.I would really appreciate it thanks alot. well, im ogg to go and work on some of the problems he assigned....Take it easy doods bye bye

 As I enagage myself in an orgy with my keyboard and my video card(ge-force2 32mb GTS!!!!!) I realize that i am bored. I have been playing nothin but games on the internet. you name it, I've played it. I am sick bored of the summer already. work starts on friday. I'll work at Beaver Tails or some of u frenchies know it as Queues de Castor. You feel like u want something. Drop by, I still charge you full price. What u thought I would give u a discount, u sadistic money-sucking capitalists. Just kiddin. So whats up with u all? Vacations anyone?? Holy shit i just remembered!!! I got number 6 wrong on the cal3 test. Damnit!!!!! Oh who cares ! Pacholke can go suck his integral. While he's at it, i hope his differential equations gets him bent, and his spherical coordinates gives him some BDSM. I swear to you this guy's fetish is Math!!! He's not a good engineer, only a good mathmatician, not wait, he's a slick mathmatician. I got the 20 i was hoping for my astro website, kickass. Anyone of you guys into computer multi-player games. If so, tell me. I have no life anyways. I'll be up all night playing. Oh jesus, i 've been playing so much and meeting so less girls that i think that the mouse is sexy. Look at that round waist and that sleek body. she wants me to push her buttons. I'll double-click her.... Hmm... I just realized that that last sentence was my cue to leave. see y'all around. latez

 Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side... Yeah right. She will "finally get discovered". :)) Since you have already predicted our reaction, I'll just limit myself to a mere "dream on". By da way, there's an amazing song, newest form Depeche Mode, called "Dream On". I recommend, if that's of any help :))))).

 Hey Guyz!!!! Congrats to all the grads! And happy birthday to Andrei. Sorry I missed ur Rusian bash. What's new boyz? Man I havn't been on this blogger for...well lets not go there. I'm going to New York and Cali this summer I can't wait to beat this town. I'll probably bump into Andrei down there. Anywayz, as soon as my agonizing summer course is over, I'm gone baby! Maybe I'll finally get discovered by some famous agent. New York and Cali are the places for that. So if you don't here from me next by the end of the summer, look for me on TV, the radio, magazine covers, Oprah, MTV...who knows? Ok I'm going to shut up now. And I'm lookong for all the...dream on girl, yeah right, someone's full of herself 2day comments. Ciao 4 now chicos!

 Hey guys, How are you all doing? Im tired as hell, my boss decided to put me on the night shift for 4 nights in a row. Im so f*%$ing tired. You guys happy to be done? Monday I start my physics class. ROCK ON!!!!!!!!!!!! Andrei happy birthday DOOD!!! did you call me yesterday? if so, I do not have your number!!!!! So please call me back and leave your number or post it up on the blog so I can get it. Im gonna tell my boss to put me off the schedule for monday night. I really have to get going.

 Those gorgeous houses on Summit Circle... Every time I'm there, I fill with determination. Wait and see. I am going to get one of those eventually. Just wait and see...

 O.k. I have something to say to Wajdi and Roman. Some poeple seem to be very excited about getting their diplomas here, I mean I don't care, good for you. However, even if I still have another stage of college to go through, I say woohoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo. Why? Well, as Vlad said the summer is gonna rock. So Wajdi, I think we should be happy and proud to stay at Vanier for a few more weeks. Doesn't it just tell you how important we are for Vanier? Anyway, don't worry people, I'm still going to grad and I'll make the big party happen. Have fun people, keep in touch and let's do something on the week-end, possibly today. Audrey, call me please when you get a chance.

So when are u guys gonna be in school so we can see eachother one more time??? I'll be there tomorrow at around 12:00. Hope to see some of u there... Bye guys and girls.. momo2001

 Good evening everyone, Well im back from a noter linear algebra marathon...why am I trying so hard for this exam? Ah, whatever, its just this last exam, but I still have a summer course, I hope its not that hard, but its with Cowan, is it really easy? Vlad are the tests really from the problem sets? I really do not feel like working that much this summer. Its almost university time, almost.....I cant wait....well sort of. When the work starts, then I want out....The best thing is to take a year off to relieve all that cegep stress from bhola, chahal, dunsky.....That is what we all need. Let us all go to Cuba and sell Cigars for a year, then come back to the wonderful word math and physics. WOO HOO!!!!!!!!!!!! Sounds good? Vlad, you up for it? We leave tomorrow!!!!!!!!!! Im registering tomorrow for the statics course, it better be open, cause if im stuck taking bio2 or organic 1 im going to go NUTS!!!!!!!!! NUTS I TELL YOU!!!!!!!!! there is no way I want to touch anything that has to do with carboxyl's and animal anatomy and circulation. And there is no way I am taking prob and stats, that is just freaking BORING......Well I think I shared enough of my thoughtless thoughts of the evening, now its time for me to exit and enter the world of dreams. I wonder whats on the menu tonight? saving the world or running away from that guy with the cane.....Hmmm, I wonder......well its time to go find out, the suspense is killing me :) hehehe :) Goodnight dudes P.S. If it smells like crap, it is crap PEACE!!!!

 I am temporarily drained of my emotional and intellectual vitality by that tripple integration transformed into the spherical system of coordinates. Sometimes it seems equivalent to navigating the Ste. Croix - C�te Vertu intersection using the map of the southern hemisphere. But that's still GOOD STUFF!!!!!! OUH! I just found out that all the graduating Science Plus people are going to have lunch in a nice resto at the college's expense. Ain't that nice of them, eh? Now I see why they were trying to fail so many of us - to spend less money on the lunch! :)) But we're tough stuff! We made it....well...we're almost there... many of us. Am I flattering myself? Oh, yes indeed! May I? Thank you very much.

 Hi Wajdi, Cowan's the best physics teacher at Vanier. The class is real easy. You saw me "studying hard" all semester :). What do you think I got? Exams are the same as the examples in class and in handouts. Just go to classes and study for a couple of hours before every test. That's guaranteed 90's. (well... don't show this to those who failed OK?)

 Good evening, How are you all doing on this fine evening? Hope everyone is having FUN FUN FUN!!!!!!! its SUMMER TIME!!!!!!!!!!! almost :) still have a linear exam and a summer course to take care of heheeh :) OH, I passed biology and physics!!!!!! HAPPY HAPPY.....Glashan called my house saturday morning to tell me my mark.....saweeeeeeeeeeeeeet Hey Vlad, how is Cowan and the statics class? is it easy enough to pull off an 80? and how are the tests structured? Well, its getting late and I really need sleep. I have been reading about vector spaces and subspaces for the whole day......WHAT AN INTERESTING COURSE THIS LINEAR ALGEBRA IS!!!!!!!!!!!! well goodnight folks. night

 It is Saturday night. Where do you think I am? Right! Studying. Let's look at it positively though: it's the last Saturday night that I study for a long time to come. There is so much neat stuff on the net - it's unbelievable! Thanks to urlLink her I now know what to do with my award. I will buy a digital camera! She is also partly an inspiration for the future layout of this site.

 OK, Astro is past... maybe not as distant as those globular clusters are, but it's moving away at the rate of the accellerating expansion of space-time. I'm listening to some good old underground hip-hop of Jean-Juc's. This is good stuff... yeah, baby, yeah, yeah, yo...B-Boy. Goota go have my lunch and write that essay. See yall brothas and sistas. YO, REPRESENT!!

 Hey guys, How are you all doing? I just finished my biology exam yesterday, I hope it went ok, I think I did ok, but hey you never know. With biology, what you think you got you never get....Lets hope Glashan gets the nice disease and lets me go to university :) Well guys, its almost over, for some of us (Mo) its already over. Guys its been a long tedious semester, but we got through it. Most of it that is. I hope I get a passing grade in biology. Cause when it happens, its gonna be smooth sailing from then on... BOOM BANG!!!!!! So how is everyone doing? good? good.....Im nervous as hell. I have to find out what happened in biology. Have to.... Gotta make this one short, I have to go and do the groceries.....hehehe, little does my mother know, never send your boy to do the groceries, cause he is gonna come back with nothing you told him to bring......OH YEAH!!!! here come the chocolate bars and coke.....alright guys, its shopping time see you soon :) l8er doods P.S. stay out of the oven!!!!!

 I came to college to study for my astrophysics test. Despite the special kind of mood I was trying to set myself into in the morning, the right half of my brain was doing its best to make me slack off for a little while. It was a good sign, however, that there was nobody in the library who would draw my attention for more than 15 seconds. As a direct consequence of the latter circumstance, I came down to the cool comfort of the IT centre and started dilligently omiting boring selections from my astrophysics CDROM. (10 mins later) Audrey is here too. She is writing some paper, and she asked me for a summary of what had happened to the Soviet Union in the late 1980's - early 1990's. Well, knowing that it would take me an hour just to lay some ground for further discussion, I had limited myself to a two-minute overview of my own simple-minded opinion on the subject. She seems satisfied. (7 hours later) Oh god, it's never going to end. WAAAY too much stuff. Time to read summaries only. (10 hours later) OK, I'm done now. 'night.

 It's about time for another pathetic interlude that nobody, not even you, will get the way I want it to be understood. Am I complaining about something? Not at all. I GIVE UP. It's not what I do very often, but I just can't help it anymore. These a few months have definitely been something in my life. There was plenty of what I had done for the first time, failing a cal test being one and the least significant thing. I have failed to do and not to do so much that I am even getting used to this weird looserish failure state. Tonight I was talking to a friend in an old port caf�, and she totally unintentionally made me realize exactly that. It seems that eveything I touch or even think about tends to go wrong. No, I didn't drink tonight, nor am I being paranoid. Gosh, I can clearly see the two faces here "knowing" where this all is coming from. They are wrong. Seriously. All I wanted to say is that I am going to quit. I will quit worrying, quit trying to control stuff, quit trying to keep balance and play it safe. Maybe it's just a way to say I'm tired. I am very tired. I need some hard and dull physical work. P.S. unless...

 oh sh*t, Evgueni... ain't that a bit dangerous... I mean, you still got the finals to go through. I realize how much you love her, but, hey, i think it's an overkill :))) I hope your prob/stats test went well today. Hey Andrei, it seems like I am moving out too. Where are you going to live? I saw an ad at Vanier - there is a sublet available for June only. I might consider that one, 'cause I just need a place for June.

 Hello people. Yes, this was the last day of classes. I had three exams today and I don't how they went. But as Wajdi would say THE HELL WITH IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Wajdi, wasn't the physics exam fun today? By the way, I had exactly the same topic for the essay as you. Finaly, this day came and we are going to enjoy the summer guys. I'm already starting to prepare myself to go to Cuba in august (what dop you think Vlad). Mr. the Chessmaster, we ARE going to Cuba the second week of august. There are still finals, but it's alright we'll survive. Anyway, the day tired me up pretty much and I have nothing say or even no inspiration to wright. Just wanted to let everyone know, I'm still alive. see ya at the exit exam tomorrow

 Ok guys, for those of you who have been desperately trying to publish over the weekend. This blogger thing has got me so mad lately, I almost deleted it and set a normal bbs system. They are saying that everything is back to normal now. It seems that it got a bit faster too. So, I say, let's give 'em one more chance. If this kinda thing happens again, I'll do something about it immediatelly. d'night.

 Hey guys, whats up, guess what, its thougthless thought time. Yes, im back with some more thougthless thoughts and my hair is longer than ever.....I think my head is going to tilt soon. I just finished writing a nice little essay on Dr. Kevorkian and how he self glorifies himself, sound familiar Mo? which one did you do? This whole weekend was devoted to biology, I was studying all the phylums, the evolution of plants and ecology....you gotta love all those cycles, and who can forget the GREAT chapter of vertabrates, 40 pages of FUN FUN FUN........so who so the baskteball game today? did Philadelphia win? I did not catch the end of it...>I was too busy studying BIOLOGY!!!!!!!! well im not going to be able to get to my thoughtless thoughts tonight, I am really tired and im just so happy that I finished this essay early :), yes thats right, finishing an essay at 2 am is early for me.....I did start it at 10:30 so that could be another reason :) well, its time to catch some ZZZZZZZ, I have a french exam at 8am, should be pretty fun NIGHT EVERYONE!!!!!!!!!

 Hey guys well i have not written in quite some time because of all those last tests. I have two more tests, one in chemistry health and beauty, and one in prob.and statistics. Then i am done. Hahaha!! I am not even worrying because even if I fail both tests with a zero, i'm still passin the classes!!! Anyways guys, hang in there, this is the last time you will have to study and then you have all summer. So just sit infront of your books and tell youself you want the best grade possible so that you can be soo happy and you will have the nicest summer. Also, my new super computer will be in my house on thursday! Woooooohoooooooo. I have a feeling i will take over the world with that machine. By the way Vlad, i am really Jealous that you have a new screen and a CDRW. You are soooo lucky. I need a new screen really bad and i would do anything for that CDRW. So, anything you want..i'll do for you..! Oh and i have good news. My best friend was going to France with his friend this month and now his friend cannot go so he sold me his ticket for 350$. Isnt that amazing??? I am so happy. I'll even be staying at his place and eat there and all so it'll end up being sooo cheap and fun and such a good relieve for me as i graduate. I'll be gone on the 28th. Well people, i must leave.

 Hurray! I just got myself a new monitor, scanner and a CD/RW!! There are a few nice pics coming soon...

 Watch this. I am starting to learn Spanish this summer! Cuba!!! Here I go! Now I can't wait for August to come. What's left is to find a more decent job. I am staying in Montreal this time after two summers spent in the northern Quebec outbacks. So, guys, if you know somebody, who might know somebody... you know... I would really appreciate. You know how responsible and reliable I am... :)) (duh).

 WASSUp People!! I finished my organic, math and humanities!!!!! ya-ha-ha!! Well It's all cool. i'm moving out like in a week or two, so hehe, we'll have fun! Besides, let's make a graduation party or something, basically, let's invite around 200 students from Vanier and not only (i'm exadurating, but sort of). man, "Bois de Bulonge" rocks!! I'm transfering!! hehe, do you believe me?? and please no commnents on the web! :) . haha. So, hmmm.... so far we're biking to ottawa, swimming to cuba, what's next? Walk to NY :) Anyway, I have to go.............guess where? hmmmmm...... last friday of school> last tutoring in the science center!! bye

 Guys, c'mon. We are really starting to look like nerds. Look aroundja! Man, I don't know what happened. Somebody brought all those cute girls to the city. It's amazing, somebody does this every spring. If I knew who it was, I would definitelly ask where (s)he is from. The bad thing is that the same somebody takes all the hot girls away for the winter. You know, I think they all come from Cuba! And that means, if we go there in August (WHICH WE WILL!!!!!), the girls won't be there, because they are all in Montreal for the summer! Anyways, guys, stop whining about your courses. Concentrate and study. We will all get there and drink our asses off on June 14. P.S. As promissed, the new layout is coming pretty soon. This one's ugly, I know.

 Hey everyone, It is 1 am and I am still awake, I tried going to sleep but it is just not working, too many things clogging my mind, too many things worrying me. I cant believe I blanked out like that in biology, I think I overstudied. Well, looks like I will have to work twice as hard for the final now. I need to do really well on this final to pass this course. Cant do it again, cause if I have to memorize another phylum or cut open another pig I will go nuts. And physics out of all the courses I am struggling with...HOW????? The one course that I was never worried about is my biggest worry now. This semester was such a slap in the face, I hope I can make it out alive. Alright im going to attempt another shot at sleeping, see if it will work this time, maybe looking at the computer monitor will tire my eyes out. Well, goodnight everyone oh and btw, Andrei I found the papers, I will then to you 4 to 5 pm thursday... goodnight

 O.k. You now after finding outy yesterday that i could not produce "induced current" during the whole semester, I decided to consume som pure methanol. When this happened, I realized that the standard deviation of the expected value of school performance was way too high and did not follow the normal distribution. I therefore synthesised a new poison (chem of health and beaty) and decided to give it to Bill Webb. Finally, I opened my russian book and concluded that "s tochki zrenia banalnoi irudutsii, kagdii chastnii individuum podvergen deistviu totalnogo opophiosa" (to vulgar to be translated). Wuzz up, science fricks. The only thing that made my day different though is giving a dance course to a bunch of Vanier people at U.B. Man, I had some teachers come and learn from me. And you know what, one of the was Lucienne Namer, hehe. It all ende with a nice party in the learning centre afterwards. Anyways, gotta go consume some mor methanol now. See ya, bodies

 Wassup people. Man, sometimes I hate school. Particullay when I have work to do. Now, swallow this, all you physic and math maniacs: when a compound A with formula C6H10 is oxidized with hot basic potassium permanganate and the resulting solution acidified, the only organic product that we can be isolated is CH3(CH2)3CO2H. Compound A is also soluble in concentrated sulfuric acid and rapidly decolorizes bromine in CCl4. Write the structure of A. Isn't it interesting?? Awwww, how devine! (not) Today was my last official Extreme Chess in Vanier as a student! Ten games at the same time, and it was done for !fun! hehe, score hmmm...well, 7.5/10. Evgueni also kicked ass: dance courses for like 15 ppl, but he'll give you all the details. By the way, Wajdi, do you still have the paper Ron gave you last semester for revision of Nature and Humanity? Chiao dudes. P.S. we are all biking to Cuba in August... hmmmm....

 Hi, Ppl, how about a basketball game right after we finish the semester? let's gather together somewhere and play some basketball, or anything else

 Good evening everyone, I haver returned, as I promised. I just finished studying for the lab exam, first time I ever finished studying before 1 am for a test, something is odd.....Aw well.....we will just see how it goes tomorrow right? RIGHT!.....I cant wait until this semetser is over, it was such a slap in the face, Now I am struggling to pass, its really scary, well I should of seen it coming, I slacked off too much this semester....now im paying for it.....I think I got burned from the sun, I was on the balcony today reading my bio lab book and the sun was frying my ass.....Its gonna be one hot summer dudes..... Dont you find it funny how you always make a schedule for yourself and you end up not following it and screwing yourself over BIG TIME? yeah, its pretty funny isnt it? Well guys, im out of thoughtless thoughts for tonight, the only thing I can think about is that bread mold produces sexually, LOL, that is just too funny......aw well, its time to go to sleep and think about prtozoans taking over the world MOUAHAHAHAAHAAAAHAHAHHAAAAAAH!!!!!!!!! Well, goodnight people P.S. Vlad how did the french exam go? make it on time? night

 Talking about motivaion with this kind of weather! hehe, well let's not get into details. All of ya talking about physics and math, think of organic chemestry!!! I have an exam on thursday and I'm going to die!!!!!! It's not even funny. Actually all the sciences we're studing here are pseudosiences. Why? Because while walking from D building to N building and observing the views on the left and on the right, especially after spending two sleepless nights of creazy studing for some test that suppose to be crucial in your future career, you realize that what ever you do, you'll end up there... and you know where! Nevertheless, the school is almost over and summer makes it all! Gosh I can't believe it's the almost the end of the adventures of the Russian Trio, the Arab gang, the chicks and other brave pupils who undertook the challenges of "the tripple B", of "Hindu-bio", of "Husband's and wifes Chemistry" and all the other famous dares; and yet, were able to accomplishing these feats!!!! However, It's not over yet! One two weeks to go, (for some people one; b-----ds!) Damn I'm late for class! See you later!

 Hey fizyxx, Mahajan's good. I took E&M with him. As for the rest, I have managed to escape "the tripple B". Mike Cowan rocks, so does Don H. Nice problem Mo! Here's one more for ya guys. It's called "the snow plow problem" It's winter, and it's snowing all day long at a constant rate (you can already smell differentiation eh?) The snow plow starts plowing at noon. It goes 2 km in the first hour and 1 km in the second hour. Question: When did it start snowing? Huh! Do you want to know the answer? 11:23 AM !!! :))) It's CAL 3. Here's some stuff I've read recently. I think it makes perfect sense. How can you become known as a person who consistently demonstrates excellence? [...] Motivation is required for excellence. [...]Motivation is what we like to do naturally. It's like being right or left-handed. We don't even think about it. We just write. The same is true for people known for excellence. They have a group of motivations that work in concert to help them perform at a higher level. Like all motivations, these were inborn and are as much a part of them as their eye color or their height. The best we can be with low motivation is adequate . No matter how hard we work and desire it, in the long run we will never be excellent at something without high levels of motivation in that area. In other words, if we toil in areas where we have low motivation, we resign ourselves to mediocrity. But who wants to be mediocre? Who wants to be known as "adequate"?

 Good evening everyone, How is everyone doing on this fine evening? good? well thats just swell!!!!! :) How is everyone handling the final week? Thank god its almost over, cause this weather really makes me wanna say the hell with classes.....How bout some FOOTBALL!!!!!!!!!! and I mean real football, not american. What do you say Mo? you wanna play? :) I just finished torturing myself with biology and reading about all the different phylums and subphylums in the plant and animal kingdom. Learning about all the different kinds of protists, bacteria, fungi, and plants....its so WONDERFUL!!!!!! and how can we forget our favourite one, genetics and evolution.....OH JOY!!!!!!! you gotta love bio!!!!!!! Thank god im going to engineering, cause I cant take another bio course, im too lazy to read 400 pages. I want my calculator and pencil, that is all I need, thats what makes it so much fun (to an extent). Oh btw, I got a letter from concordia about burseries, telling me that I have until May 18th to reply, hmmm....what to do? Did you get this Mo? maybe that is the letter that Chadi got also..... Alright, something came to my attention today in bio class that Karram pointed out to me....When a teacher is talking about something and he/she knows that the class does not understand, do you know how easy it is to play with students heads and fool us into believing things that are not even true? Its amazing how much power teachers have, its insane.....Just imagine when we go to university and we find out that alot of the things that were told to us in physics by good ol' Benson's book was all wrong.....WELL guys, looks like we learned PSEUDOPHYSICS!!!!!! Arent you glad we are at Vanier????? damn, when you really think about it, it would be really bad if that really happened!!!! But in all seriousness, the physics here was good, with the exception of the triple B Crew, BHOLA, BHATIA, BENSON....oh and who can forget the hidden character MAHAJAN.....oh those guys, never giving up on their endless effort to make us all feel like we have an IQ of -10...YOU GOTTA LOVE EM!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Well, looks like Im done with my thoughtless thoughts of the night.....now I will go sleep it off and think of more gibberish to tell you guys tomorrow night, tune in same vlad place, same vlad time, same vlad channel..... Goodnight everyone, P.S. THATS MY STORY AND IM STICKIN' TO IT!!!!!!!!!!! goodnight everybody

 hey everyone.. well, i have around 8 days of school left. After that, i am finished!! I really cant wait to be done and for some odd reason, i cannot get myself motivated for any of my last term tests. I am the only one here guys? Anyways, i've finally ordered my new computer and i cant wait till it arrives. It is going to be my super computer!! If anyone wants to race my computer, just let me know... So anybody here into hockey or basketball. Well either, i think we should all support the remaining Canadian city in the playoffs, the toronto maple leafs in hockey, and the raptors in basketball. I really hope they kick some american ass!! And for all of you soccer fans, come watch me play in the playoffs on wednesday, Universal break, at the gym. Well, i've got to get back to my probability and statistics, but i'll leave you with a fun problem to tackle. It is night and dark with no moon, The war is raging and 4 people come to a rickety old bridge down in the valley. The bridge is not very wide and is strong enough for only 2 people to cross at a time. The group has only 1 flashlight. So someone will have to bring the flashlight back for the others. The condition of the group is such that each person takes a different length of time to cross the bridge. The following table shows the times, the name have been changed to protect the innocent: Mr. White - takes 1 min Mr. Red - takes 5 min Mr. Black - takes 15 min Mr. Pink - takes 20 min As they get to the bridge they notice dynamite around the bridge and a timer showing 36 minutes until the bridge is destroyed. Your mission is to get the group across.

 OK, here's a word of support for Mo: math is the best subject, everything else is trash. (hehe) (especially theoretical math is good, if you'd like to burn your brains for no reason.) math is cool, I do like it more than other subjects, although I'm not good at it. Also, I really think that the name of a school matters only if you decide to go abroad. If you're staying in the same province, I guess it only matters while you're fresh out of uni. At least, that's what my friends, who graduated many years ago say. And, really, ask anyone in Quebec if they've heard of any good technical schools in Germany or Sweden, or any other European country. I don't think many ppl will come up with a decent answer, even ppl in industry, at least it seems to be so. For North America that might be different though. I believe what matters is positions you've held, projects you've done, and so on, but the path to these is not only through the name of your school, hehe May be I'm thinking about all that in this way just because I'll most likely go to Concordia, McGill is not taking me for sure, whatsoever, hehe, so I'm practically guaranteed not to have that "name" :)

 An alcoholic and THC addict with his iq next to 64 is looking for a smart and "good to moderated" looking female _WITHOUT_ sense of humour. A Guy.

 This one will be exclusively dedicated to Mo. It's the worst possible time for me to comment on your post, Mo, but I feel I have to. We all know why people apply to McGill. We all know why the applied/accepted ratio at McGill is among the highest in this country. We all know what it's all about (name, prestige, contacts, whatever comes to your mind). We all know it, but some people are having a hell of a hard time accepting it. Oh well, I really don't think it's reasonable, to say the least. And all that crap about atmosphere, teachers... C'mon, Mo, let's be adults here. Do you support that "Don't let friends go to McGill" stuff? If so, I am really sorry, and I don't have anything else to say to you my friend. I know you chose Concordia because McGill didn't offer the program you wanted, and I respect your choice. However, please stop this Concordia-oriented brainwashing here. You're not even their student yet. Wajdi, talk to students and teachers from both institutions and make an educated choice. Secondly, Mo, I have noticed lately that you are really obsessed with "superiority". "... mathematicians are the most important because they could derive formulas from physics and chemistry". Now, what kind of nonesense is this? Scientists invented math as a tool to communicate and reason their discoveries. Don't get me wrong though: I am not saying math is not important. Nevertheless, your whole statement is just silly. I know ( read: I hope ) you didn't really mean it. Anyways, Mo, don't get too pissed-off. I'm just this kind nasty person picking on people's words. I am a little upset myself, that's why it's not really a good time to write this :) Sorry about that. See ya in school! P.S. I don't want to trigger a major discussion on the above subjects, but I think it's inevitable. Oh, well... I'll just go have some normal sleep, which I haven't had for three days now. Bye.

 hey everybody forst of Vlad, i never said that 0 was equal to 1, i said 0! was equal to 1. Now u try to figure that out mister physician. Hey guys, dont u feel the sort of quiet competition in school between math, physics and chemistry teachers. I think they all work in groups and believe that they are superior to others. I personally think that the mathematicians are the most important because they could derive formulas from physics and chemistry. Without mathematicians, this world would be corrupt i believe! Anyways, congratulation Wajdi on ur McGill accecptane. I do not think u should consider going there because there are too many risks involved. It is true that you will get a better name at McGill, but after u get a first job, companies dont care where u came from. So just come to Concordia, there are better teachers, better amosphere....cool? ok! Well guys see ya soon!

 Hey people, How are you doing today? I got called off of work. WOO HOO!!!>..gotta love the rain, it sometimes comes in at the right times LOL. Today I received acceptance into Mechanical Engineering at McGill, and this left me in a huge problem. I am stuck choosing between McGill or Concordia...Concordia I am guaranteed a spot in electircal, however in McGill I will have to take Mechanical get a 3.4 gpa and transfer to electrical, that requires a HELL of alot of work to do. And I am ready to make the sacrifices in order to get that GPA, however if I do not, I am going to dig a HUGE hole for myself, so I am right now stuck in a tough decision and I do not know what to do, cause McGill carries the name, which is incredible for international affairs. I would really appreciate your ideas and thoughts on what I should do...thanks :) Well other than that I am trying to deal with the final week of classes and the "nice" work load the teachers left us to take care of due to their lack of organization. We all have a HELL of alot of work to do. Its going to be a fun week right???? :) For most of us it is our final push before the big leagues. Guys, lets do it. Lets leave Vanier with a BANG. its time to pull off those first semester marks all over again :)....Remember first semester when we were all serious and hard working and stressed because we thought College was strict stuff?.....Well, we sure learned something there...So dudes, good luck to all of you, this is it, the final step. Alright, well its time to go and join my biology book in an evening of phylum memorization.....Here I come Arhtropods and Foriminefora...... :) you gotta love bio, OH YEAH!! OH I forgot, Mo, someone got a call for Electrical co-op this week, and some other people got calls, that is not a good sign for us habibi. I think we should call them on monday and give them a piece of arab mind. :) Well im leaving Good bye everyone, and remember, Bhatia is watching you, so be good :)

 Hi Mo, I am definitely going to the grad. ceremony. You don't have to get awards to go! After all, we need somebody to clap too!! :)) I too have done some serious research in math when I was young. I came to the conclusion that 0 is never equal to 1, even for very big values of 0 and very small values of 1. I had sent my application for the Nobel prize, but they said, whatever you do, you won't be able to get the prize if you're mathematician. That's why I quit math and am doing physics now. And you will have to live with it I guess :). I heard some people applying for Comp.Sc. have already been called for the interview. Good luck Mo! And the last thing. Some people think we're pathetic. Well, life is pathetic my friends :). And yes, I happen to be "smart", as you said, to get your email and IP. :)

 hey everybody i am back!!! First of all, what the heck is all this take about Andrei Moskvitch???? He does not exist anymore...damn, i'm really gonna miss that chessmaster. Too bad he never got the chance to be the Mulanda's...hehehehe!! Oh yeah, Vlad is right guys, stop the crap about mafia and stuff coz i am very sensible about that and we might get in trouble and all. So who here is going to the graduation ceremony?? I dont think i am going because i did not play chess nor dance so that i can earn an award. However, i believe to be nominated for a nobel prize this summer, so i'm lookin forward for that. Yup! so u wonderin why?? well i prooved why 0! is equal to 1!! Anyway, i got to go and continue reading this english story!!! Oh and i am still waiting for Concordia to call me for a co-op interview. Please guys and girls, give a prayer to your good friend mr.momo!! see ya all.. the one and only, aka, momo

 Guys, it's all good and funny, but please cut the crap about mafia and stuff... It might be a sensitive subject for some of the people here. Also, check out my new nickname :)

A very open mind is required to read and tolerate this. The administrator is not in any way responsible for your brain falling out due to the excessive openning of your mind. [!] END OF NOTE [!] Alright People, Listen real carefully. Yes, it is true, Andrei Moskvitch does not exist, his (its) actual name is Podoprigora from former planet KGB (For simplicity, we will stick with the name Andrei). This species of blonde, russian accent beings come from the former planet KGB. The Andreis apparently landed on Earth during 1995-1996. Through extensive research, the only way we were able to come into contact with this unknown type of species, was by using "Vodka" to lure the Andrei's into laboratories for experimentation. While holding a few of the Andreis in the laboratory we conducted many experiments. Dr. Evgueni Chaoulski performed one experiment that astonished many scientists. He used "Vodka" to see the effects alcohol would have on the Andreis. The following results were taken out of Dr. Chaoulski's log: two isomers could be isolated from this particular compound named Andrei CycloMoskvich. Following the Markovnikov's rule, the isomer which demonstrated to be the major product of the reaction was the one bad for the human environment, which [he] called "Bad Andrei". Later on, Dr. Wajdi Al-Hawari conducted experiments in order to see the genetic code for the species of "Bad Andrei". Through many experiments, and using mendelian theories, we found that there was a dominant allele which gave the species an instant need for "Vodka". However the genotype for the Andreis showed that there was a recessive allele that led to many physical and mental defects when "Vodka" was not present in the system. When given excess "vodka", Andrei became very fatigued and went into hours of sleep. However, he was still in need of "vodka". Dr. Al-Hawari decided to see what kind of physical and mental disabilities would occur after "Vodka" was not put into the system. Andrei became very violent and harmful to the environment. Therefore by using Dr. Evgueni Chaoulski's results, we decided to destroy the Andrei before more damage was done. Finally, we destroyed the major product of the reaction that was bad for the environment, that is why the Andrei CycloMoskvich virus no longer exists. However through the process of destruction a hybrid between the cyclomoskvich and the bacteria used, a new breed of Andrei's was produced. This new breed was called Andrei Moskvich. Going back, if you recall, there was still a good isomer, that Dr. Chaoulski named "Good Andrei". Which had a dominant allele for "vodka" control. Therefore as you can see, there are now two Andrei's. One of which no longer exists. However, the good Andrei's name, is not Andrei, it is in fact Podoprigora. Nevertheless, due to its amazing history we still call it Andrei Moskvich. This concludes the "Andrei Moskvich theory".

 Alright, it's about time I put in a comment. What the hell is going on!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It seems like this dayly log thing became a subject of disscussing Mr. THE REAL ANDREI MOSKVITCH. I will tell you the truth people, me, the real Evgueni Chaoulski. Andrei Moskvitch does not even exist. At least, not on this planet. It is MOST LIKELY some *******d from another planet. Why you think you're supposed to believe me? Well, that's simple, the real Andrei Moskvitch, if he is really real, should know that KGB no longer exists (got it Andrei's, both of you). So that's why I'm saying to you, russian poeple, the following secret code: " lubov zachem ti mouchaesh menia ". And by the way Mr. Momo, you still don't know what the RUSSIAN MAFIA IS. Now that our Godfather is pulled back in, as he said it himself on the site, you people will regret it. Besides, everything else is fine. Have a very good end of the semester everyone

 OK people, listen carefully. When you press the POST & PUBLISH button, WAIT. It takes about a minute to post. Even if you don't see any immediate response from the browser - wait! Just in case, before you publish, COPY your useless scrumbles so you don't have to retype everything. Hey, this guy is getting all angry. I like that!

 Man, I'm wondering how many people are mixed up about Mr. Moskvitch? Especially those, who don't know us in person. :) Seriously, it looks stupid, Wajdi. If you have problems spelling my new nickname Vladster, do copy-paste, it's easier. :)

 Good evening everyone, I JUST WROTE THIS LONG PARAGRAPH ABOUT NOTHING, AND I WAS ALL HAPPY THAT I WROTE IT, CAUSE YOU WOULD OF ALL JUST SAT THERE AND SAID.....WHAT THE HELL WAS HE TRYING TO SAY???????/ BUT NOOOOOOOOO I HAD TO GO AND PUSH THE POST BUTTON SO IT RESETS EVERYTHING, I BLAME THIS ON VLAD, NOT BLOGGER, BUT VLAD? WHY? BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE IT. AND YOU KNOW WHAT ANDREI? I AM STILL THE REAL ANDREI MOSKVITCH, SO LIVE WITH IT.... Alright, now that I got that out of my system, time to tell you what I wrote in a nuttshell....mmmm nuts...hold on, let me go get some nuts.....(1 minute later) good nuts...salty.....oh Momo, this is for you, Kaif halak habibi!! :) Arent you people wondering what I just said, I guess its only the arabs that are gonna understand this now. AW WELL!!!!!!!! So how is everyone doing on this fine evening? good? well thats swell, btw Vlad, you should enforce a new rule on your site, no lame people allowed, and I know what you are thinking, and dont even think about kicking me off, just make me an exception and we will all live happy :) its gonna be pretty ugly if we get the gang wars started over the internet, lets keep it clean over the net....hold on, need water, these nuts are salty........(2 minutes later) now that was refreshing.....how many of you just went to go get some water, or want some now? huh? huh? :) I thought so.... well its time for me to go and prepare my french oral on Einstein, im going to prove his theory on relativity for the class, lets see how many people understand what I tell them..... TOODLES!!!!! P.S. Andrei I have the essay I just have to transfer it to this computer then send it to you..... oh and its ok if no one believes that you are the real Andrei Moskvitch, cause everyone knows that I am the REAL ANDREI MOSKVITCH!!!!!

 Dear SubCheesyGNU, blogger is doing fine. Just wait a few secs and let it publish properly :)

 What the hell is wrong with Blogger, I've tryed to publish my last post like 5 times and it doesn't work. Or maybe there are some changes with the service that I'm not aware of?

 Hello everybody!!! NOW LOOK!! This is the REAL Andrei Moskvitch!! And anybody who is going to sabotage or reveal the identity of super-secret-undercover-retiered KGB agent shall get in trouble!! Man, science freaks! It's been a while that I haven't posted anything! Can you believe it, I'm in McGill library and it's 8:30pm doing my stupid humanities project!! And I'm probably going to stay here till 10:00pm! It' not funny! BWT, Wajdi, if you found your essay from last year, e-mail it to me, andreim@ureach.com. I'll really appreciate it. If anyone is interested in becoming a member of rock climbing club, tell me, it's pretty cool, there are hjiking, rock climbig, kayaking, biking etc. Roman, thanks for the CD and the serials. Take care people, it might sound funny, but this is the third copy of this post, I've closed the browser two times by accident! P.S. Mumu, oops, Momo, that's very cool that you don't have finals you lucky ******d !!! :)

 Yeah right Mr. Momo. C'mon people. Those are all stereotypes.... don't you agree? I mean, what can a 19-year-old science nerd as I am possibly have to do with "mafia"?? Think about it. :) By the way, we have at least one international terrorist here. He has that really long name: "I AM THE REAL ANDREI MOSKVITCH". Wajdi, I might need your help someday. Keep in touch.

 hey everyone... yup i am new here and i think i know most of you. Anyways, I feel so good to be part of this no-life science people group!!! heheh... So finally, after four loooong semesters, i am graduating out of this place!! To those who are still staying here in science, all i can say is enjoy it while u can, and never, i mean never, take Bhatia for physics!! So there is only 11 days of school left and i have no final exams..wooohoooo!!! I cant wait till i get liberated out of this place and especially this science center!! People here are starting to act weird, especially those in the "russian mafia!!!" Yeah, you know who you are! But i am not worried, they cannot do much to me since i am their superior!!

 Andrei, I forgot to give you the serials from my CDs. Check your email, I've send some of them to you.

 Howdy everybody, How are you today? you all doing good? Thats fine and dandy, im doing grrrrreeaaaat. Super Duper fine, I just finished a physics exam, and I had alot of fun doing it too. So much fun that I decided to dedicate Physics to Andrei Moskvitch? So who is the real Andrei Moskvitch? no one knows, only one thing is known about this KGB associate. He is a master chess player and russian roulette player. So where is Andrei? who knows...............

 You know how some people just suddenly open your eyes on something... It's amazing. Thank you very much. You know who you are. You have always been like this. You freak me out occasionally, but it's very... very rewarding to know you.

 Vladster 'daily log' statistics for April: 54 posts; 4,207 words; 24,059 characters. Wow! Keep it up guys!

 Waj, man! Nice to see you again. Unfortunatelly, I'm not going to take that course because I got a nice job, which I don't want to quit for now. One more thing for today: there is a new layout coming up soon. 'night

 Hey guys, hows it going? Im here at Mcgill working on these corel draw drawings and powerpoint presentations. Its pretty cool. I like :). Im just about ready to leave now. I think im going to do NOTHING. Yes people, believe it or not, when I leave, I will do NOTHING. and it feels good to say that. I have nothing to do. nothing nothing nothing... hehehehe well that was fun. Anyway. I spent the day working on these drawings while at the same time reading the nasa website and downloading movie trailers and playing on the ms hearts network. who knew those games would so much fun over a network...So Vlad, you are going to be taking a summer class here at Mcgill, kewl, we can probably meet up once in a while to do stuff. Well im dying to get out, so I am going to leave now. I will try posting something else up soon, for now, good bye and stay out of the oven...... l8er

 Privet to all new comers!! Guys, you have an interesting discussion about crime going on here, but I guess I'm not in, since I'm dealing with 20 potential criminals everyday at my camp, and these boys are devils!! Aged 12-13, you know how they are... :) But it is fun!!!!! Nice pics, Vlad, but I know that there are more.... :). Vlad and Jeka, are you going to help Astere this Sartuday with her moving? She asked if we can be there around 10:00 am. I'm going to help her out. BTW, I'm leaving to Philadelphia on Tuesday for a week, I'm pretty excited; but you can't imagine how tiered I'm. What esle? well, talk to you later, P.S. Vlad and Evgeni, call me I have something interesting to show you. :)

 you guys check this is pretty funny, at least i think so, u can use this tool when (as often happens) talking about a hi-tech topic and not knowing what to say, but wanting to sound smart........ urlLink here by the way, the day and time is to come soon............ thanx for the reply

 to iLya N Canada is quite a rich country but its crime rate is not as high as , let's say Jamaica. whatever you say crime doesnt occur in places where money grows but in places where reside a lot of uneducated and poor people. I mean Harvard and Yale, just to name some, are the wealthiest institutions. How come there names are not on that list ?Its because people there have moral values. I mean I am pretty darn sure that students that afford to go there have laptops galore! . Anyway I just wanted to demonstrate that big universties actually protect students from their own mediocrity. Phhbbt! We're all doomed anywayz. 2 russo russo ya sure im up, tell date and time, ill try to make it, I hope more people join too.

 Hey guys, waza? crime?, I actually agree with Tygon, !!! it is not proportional more wealth != more stealling, it is human values no? changing topic, a frien of mine is trying to organize a go out to a paint ball game, price? it is $20 for the equipment for as long as u stay and $0.07per bullet so if any of you is interested let me know, I really wanna go and kill some of you there hahaha! I have to mention that these prices are pretty cheap so think about it, ok!

 2 TyGoN 1. Stats says that in US % of crimes per man twice more than in Russia. IMHO this problem too complex and has mor than 1 criteria. 2. All presidemts are men (with nervs). :) 2 Vlad I've moved up, you know were. All news by mail.

 Whazzup yo! Nice pictures Vlad. If you need other pictures, mine are gonna be ready soon. Btw, some people turned out prety nice on those pictures. So, have fun everyone. See you soon.

 Vlad I think ur wrong, theft doesnt occur more in places with more money but often in places which are very poor. Correct me if i am wrong but there are much more thefts and burglaries in countries such as 3rd world countries than Canada or the US. I think the reason why there is theft is some places and not in others is because the people there do not carry the intrinsic values of personal goods. thats my two cents.

 Well how bout that ? check this out, seems that all the presidents are the same, democrat or not, urlLink here

 I think the rate of laptop stealing is approx. the same everywhere, but much more students have laptops at such universities as MIT (the best engineering school in the world), than, say, at Concordia. Therefore, more of the laptops are being stolen. Correct me if I'm wrong. Yeah, in case you want to see some urlLink grad pics ... There are a few. The rest will be up as soon as I get them reprinted at some legitimate place.

 Hey hey! hi all, welcome igar. im up for the movies or something, gimme a call or just post up on blog. found something funny Kryptonite's Top 10 Worst Colleges/Universities for Laptop Theft* 1. Massachusetts Institute of Technology 2. Stanford University 3. Georgetown University 4.Purdue University 5.Southern Illinois University/Carbondale 6.University of South Florida 7.University of Georgia 8.University of Illinois/Urbana 9. University of North Carolina/Charlotte 10. Duke University Amazingly in the list reside most and some of the best universities in the world.apparently.so we judge a university not by its cover but by its students, right?

 Wazzzzup, many of you won't be happy that I am here but here u have me, hehehe.......... guys, what about a sort of pic-nic all together? one of this weekends................? or movies, or something, man this is summer come on let's enjoy it, no? ok so ............ think about it

 Ladies and gents, Please welcome: Igar Perez!!! Our new member.

 Phew! My first day at the new place is finally over. It was cool enough. There is nothing much to do - filing, faxing, copying etc. The people are extremely welcoming. I got a $0.5-per-hour raise my very first day. Besides, there are like four male persons out of about 20 people. I guess I'll spend the rest of the summer there... helping the ladies get their stuff organized... ;o)

 TyGoN. Yeah, I heard the news about the Snowbirds. A midair collision; nobody died, thank God. Not sure what you want my opinion about (?). Today was a tiring day :). Andrei, I don't know how you can hadle that on a daily basis :)). Just joking actually. It's cool. Good luck at work tomorrow. By the way. Everybody wish Andrei to get well! He is sick. OK, I'm done for now. Good nite people.

 im hearing visinting friends and family !! Its pretty cool here! No rain!! HAHAHAHAA!!!! hey vlad since ur a plane avid want to know ur opinion about the snowbirds, i think u heard the news, and just wanna someone's opinion from someone who enjoys aviation. Was having an argument with someone here about the snowbirds. So else um....ya....whats up?... anywayz im out peace

 Hey TyGoN! What are you doing in Toronto? By the way, it's raining in Montreal. The heat is gone for good. No, that's not my car... not yet anyway :o). Wajdi, I don't know why, but I find your posts very amusing. Keep them up! As for doing something, I'm all for it! How about tomorrow? We could go for a movie or just a beer somewhere... I'll try to get in touch with everybody. 'night P.S. Here's what I ran into today (by accident, I swear!). It seems to be common sense, and I wonder how many years of research it took to just reinforce the common perception. Physical attractiveness is a powerful personal reinforcement (by means of socialization in the relationship) and a powerful social reinforcement, due to the high importance socially attached to this characteristic, even though it is not often acknowledged. A partner much more attractive than oneself could involve a series of additional costs and additional effort in both starting and maintaining the relationship. Similarly, a much less attractive partner involves a high cost (or a deficit in rewards, at least in physical appearance), for which reason either the partner is not chosen, or else is chosen at the cost of an increase in the PPAO, as suggested by the cognitive dissonance perspective...

 What? Wajdi's back here? Oh my LORD. No, I'm gonna quit posting now. So Dr. Al-Hawari, how are you doing? So, you say the fireworks were fun, what do you think Vlad and Andrei? Did you guys enjoy them just as much as Wajdi did? So, as Vlad said, it's fun to see that many of you are back on the site, because my fingers were getting tired ( I meant tired from typing). So, Vlad you're going to summer school, well, jion the happy club of "summerschoolers". Anyway poeple, I don't have much to say besides the usual stuff like school, dancing, work, girls and party (man that's quite a lot actually). So, I hope you are all doing great and are ready for something big to happen some time in July when we all finish summer school (or more likely, some of us). I don't know what yet, but TRUST me. So, boys and girls, be good and listen to mom and dad. See yuo all later. (huggs and kisses)

 Hey guys. IM BACK the master of nonsense has returned to tell you about ALL THE NOTHING I have been doing. :) I saw some of you at the fireworks the other day. How did you guys find it? It was not that bad. But I have seen better. So how is everyone doing? How is the summer going with you people? Everything good? Did anyone register for classes at mcgill/concordia? Im sort of worried because I dont know the teachers names. So I have to register risking the chance of getting a bhatia :) ALRIGHT...BHATIA ALL THE WAY!!!!!!!!!!!!(note: before you decide to shoot me for that last comment, I was being sarcastic) Hey dudes, you wanna do something soon? Would be cool to do something. Im keeping myself busy studying for Cowan's next exam. ITs all good. THe class is pretty interesting, but what we are doing now is so boring. Waves is zzzzzzzzzzz........Especially wave optics...GOOD GOD........I quit Dairy Queen. So Vlad it looks like we both left the food industry and we both will not be getting free food anymore. Aw well, it was a good sacrifice. I just could not deal with those annoying customers who seemed like they were being stupid on purpose. THe worst thing is....the people who serve us at various places probably say the same thing about us. Its a strange twisted cycle. :) Well guys, I have to go, I have people, need to show my respect and get off the net. Just wanted to put a message up to say hello. l8er people

 very nice car! hey vlad howzit goin?? is it ur car? hot wheels! so howz everybody else doin? seems to me everybody's silent now? anyway give me a shout, enjoying summer talkin from Toronto baby!! very nice weather unlike heat in Montreal!!! im out peace



 Yeah! How's everyone? Faisal, thanks for, hm... nice comments about the pictures. You know, I have always been the same arrogant jerk, as I am now, but at that time I could hide it better, I guess :). Well... I'm just sharing good news with you guys. I got a new job! I now work in an office in St. Laurent. I was so happy to quit that "Veggirama" thing today! On the other hand, no more free lunches for me :((.

 Good It seems like life is coming back into this blog. Nice to see you all here again. I think I'll spend this July studying full-time. I am going to take an intensive int. calculus course at McGill to ease my Fall schedule a little. Oh, yes. Back to school baby! Damn, I have yet to enjoy a single bit of the summer.

 Hello my people , how r u doin? I c that life treats you well. Vlad, those pics, hahahahahaa, they're just too funny, hahahahahahaha, .....no no just kiddin......phhbbt HAHAHAHAHA. How could what seems like a polite young man turn into you? I cant seem to recognize. I do see you were quite different from the other physics students in there(not nerdy) that was cool. N E wayz im still enjoying summer. working the usual stuff. preparing for the next semester. anywayz peeps im out peace

 Wassup my dear friends!? I'm back! And back for good! Actually I came back from NY a quite a long time ago, I just wasn't posting anything here. So what can I say? Well, there lot's of new stuff going on, and I'm for the get together you guyes are planning but cann't set up. I'm for the pool. I'm also for the rock climbing. Audrey, can you please tell me when are you at home because I called you lots of times and so far it has been useless. :/. Jeka, I'm free on the 29th, but I think we'd have to call everybody sinse they don't come to this site anymore. What else? Well, I'm working, having fun, having some creazy ideas about some creazy stuff...as usual; always smiling (hope you people are too), and I expecting to have almost $0.01 in my bank account for various reasons :)). PS if you care, I'm going to have a cold (I think). So good bye, luv you all, and Audrey call me please, thanks. yours

 Evgueni, I'm not nervous :). urlLink The pictures are not from Vanier grad. They're from my high school's graduation party back in 1998. The latest ones are coming soon. You won't have to look for them, don't worry :).

 What grad pics? I haven't seen any. Are they on the site yet? If so, please tell me where to look. Btw, dear Vladster, don't get to nervous about my nick name. It is soon going to be changed.

 strange Somebody found this page yesterday by plugging keywords "������ ����" (rector kerk) into the Russian search engine urlLink aport.ru . Interesting, isn't it?

 Nice grad.pics Vlad. Like our friend said, if we can not coordinate a date for a swimming barb. session, you can always come for a swim, just call first please. En tout les cas, I would like to know what are your plans this weekend, at knight! What do you think of rock-clibming!!? BTW where is Andrei? NY? I thought he came back! Ciao ciao!

 Nice Wow, Mr. Viva Dedic (damn, change your freakin' nickname for god's sake!!!). It's a pretty interesting story you got there! It makes me envious. I haven't been into anything this exciting for... say, half-a-year or something.

 Oh well, there is always somebody to keep me, poor kid, intertained. Have a look at urlLink my guestbook for details. What you will see there is the latest from the raging email battle of two days.

 Thank you Audrey and Vlad for your congradulations. Vlad, I would also like to congratulate you too for your " Alan Liddiaard Memorial Scholarship". What a name for an award. Btw, Vlad I have an idea where to go for your birthday, it's a nice camping place. Audrey, I don't think that the big pool thing that we wanted to make is going to happen before the month of July, unless everyone is free on friday June 29th. I'll try to let you know more precisely. In the mean time, it would be fun to at least go for a swim.. So peace guys, and see you soon.

 Mais, merci beaucoup Audrey! I was cool, although quite bureaucratic, as all the official ceremonies. Congrads to Andrei and Evgueni with their student life awards! After the ceremony, we went to the Old Port, then to the Peel Pub. There were many people from Vanier, grads and not only. So, we drank beer until 3 AM. Got home at around 4:30. I'll be posting a lot of grad pictures as soon as I get the film developped. By the way, I've started putting up my old high school pics urlLink here , if you're interested. Then, yesterday there was another party at "Cirque du Soleil". Free food (unlimited) and free drinks (3 items). It was quite an experience. Everybody was so... different. It's not my crowd, but I enjoyed being there very much. Audrey, pool sounds great. I'm free after 4 PM any day, except tomorrow.

 Honestly OK

 Dido

 Hi to everyone! F�licitation � nos gradu�s!!! I would like to hear about your Grad.!! I have seen Mr. Eugene this afternoon, hope I'll see everyone else very soon. Btw you should post the days where you have free time ...I would like to see you ALL ... swim. pool maybe? :o)

 So, how's everybody feeling about the whole thing? Personally, I don't really care. These two years went by so fast and seem to be so meaningless that I can't even make up my mind about what I am supposed to feel right now. Time to name "champions", I guess. I have reasons to assume that this blog is regularly read by a few Vanier teachers. That notwithstanding, I would like to express my personal opinion about the courses I took and instructors I had pleasure to be taught by during these blissful years of our collegial studies. Alright then. Courses. The... ... most boring : World Views - East and West (Daniel Tomas). ... most useless : General Biology (Ernst Bleichert). ... easiest : Photography (Pat Masterson). ... intrinsically good : Ethical Choices (Michael Dandy-Smith). ... hardest (aka "good stuff"): Calculus III (Gerry Pacholke). ... smallest amount of studying : Calculus I (Steve Papadakis); Linear Algebra I (David Gates). ... simply the best : Mechanics (Don Hetherington; Electricity & Magnetism (S. Mahajan); Statics & Engineering Physics (Mike Cowan); English (Pat Tedford); Ethical Choices (M. Danby-Smith) See you at the grad.

 urlLink This is very engaging. By urlLink Shannon .

 Alright guys. What do you think we should do on Thursday night? If you people have an idea for some kind of an after grad thing, don't hesitate to share with everybody. How about going to some quiet place and have a nice drink (someone's house perhaps)? Btw, Tygon and Vladster, what happenned to everyone else, where are they? Wajdi, Andrei, Sarah, Audrey, etc. What's up guys? I haven't seen you in a while. I hope you're all doing great. For some of you see you on thursday, others, see you sometime soon.

 Hey TyGoN. We were in the old port on Thursday at about 10 pm. I was there on Saturday night as well. I bought a sugar and a chocolate beaver tails and LOTS of icecream, but I never saw you! Do you work there or are you just consumming the tails under the counter? I got a letter in the mail with the confirmation form that I will the attending the ceremony. I brought it back to them on about June 6. We have to come to college tomorrow to pick up our gowns and tickets. I hope it helps. Evgueni, all that sounds great. You seem to be one of those actually having a time of their life :). I have had three job interviews today and have been explicitly promissed two jobs. It's mostly boring clerical office stuff, but it's still much better than what I have now. I hope they'll call back. I have an idea. Who wants to go Alberta to plant trees? They pay $200-300 per day. Yes, it's hard, but we're men aren't we? I'm sure it's a lot of fun, good workout and a nice tan. Alright, I'll see you guys day after tomorrow.

 One little thing vanier grads, do you have ur tickets or something ? its the 11 June and i dont have any tickets for the 14, should i have them by now or something?ill call those money stealing bastards tomorrow anywayz see you all u guys anymore in the old port and feel like eating at beaver tails, drop by ill chip you one. Anywayz im out peace

 Prety cool Vlad. So how was your week-end, everyone? Mine was pretty cool. As some of you already know I spent Thursday night in the old port. Friday was pretty borring though. Can you believe it guys? I studied Physics all day (and I really mean it). Saturday was another marathon: I was working 12 hours straight, from 10 to 10. Imagine, "welcome to the royal bank visa..." for twelve hours. Finally, Sunday was a big reward for all the hard work that I've done last week-end. It was my dance school's annual graduation ball. You know what i mean when I say that. My partner and I were the best perfomers of the evening ( sorry for my modesty), after the performance i was enjoying the female entourage (some of them are quite nice btw and they're not all that old) and i was also swiming in the fine waters of the open bar of the reception hall. Right on the day before my exam. Cool, don't you find? So that's about it for my nice little week-end. I hope everyone is doing good. If you have a chance, share your news too. see you all. P.S. Countdown: 3 and a half days before grad. Get ready to party.

 Updates anyone? Hello. It's me. First off, urlLink this site definitely has something to it. It's about time for another short-handed movie review. Yesterday I watched "Swordfish". I recomend you do so too. It's good stuff, although the plot is a bit confusing. The central idea, as I see it, is the utilitarian approach to international terrorism. The whole thing is centered on the cheesiest incarnation of the idea of protecting the american way of life. The movie is worth seeing at least because of the brilliant John Travolta's acting. I love this guy.

 Hey everyone. Well, what can I say? There are no updates so far. I am in some kind of a hovering state, half asleep lately. I like it pretty much though. It's like being stoned every day. Slowly getting used to not worrying about tests, labs and that sort of stuff (as if I ever did worry about that :). In short: working, listening to DMX and Chilli Peppers, watching movies, eating a lot of junk, but, hey!, running every morning. OK, OK, starting tomorrow... :) And, yeah, did I mention becoming more and more arrogant every day? OK, have to go now. See some of you tonight and the rest of you someday soon. Have a nice one.

 Hei guys. Where the hell is everyone? What happened to you people? I want to have some news and updates.

 Hey Vlad, Centre-ville where,in what? stripbars?.... Anyway where i work we offer pieces of death. I dunno why people have to suicide in Quebec. all they gotta go is to come eat out hypercholesterolated-heart-blocking-heavycalorified food. Im telling you, we bring it right out of the thick running oil which is still dripping mind you, and then apply the fattiest substances on this God given earth, and people wait almost 30 minutes in line and pay the price, 4 dollars for one beaver tail!! But I have to admit and so will others that it is so good!!!!!!!! Hmmm....chocolat....husjghfkshg...(im drooling). Howz everybdy else doin? did u guys get the english exit result back?? i got nothing back. maybe i gotta call em or something. anyway im out peace

 You know Vlad, I'm very happy you're refiguring your whole life plan, but competition is a dirty business. I'm sure you know it just as well as I do. Even though I like competition, I wouldn't want to compete with you. Btw, speaking of Centre Ville, that's where I work as well. So tell me when you're working, I may pass by. I'm not going to say anything else for know, I have to go to bed. So good night to everyone and have a nice day tomorrow.

 Oh, no. I'm not messing with you man. There is no point in doing so, is there? I don't feel bad and lonely either. Speaking of inspiration, I am in the process of refiguring (!) my whole life plan. Indeed, working in Centre Ville (shuuut �p!!!) makes me think differently about my objectives. I haven't come to any clear conclusion yet, but I'm beginning to think we might compete for the same job one day, Mr. Viva Dedic (of course I don't mean dancing!). Whatever it makes you think about my dear friend, I am not messing with you... not yet anyway. Yours truly,

 What do you mean yeah whatever. Are you like messing with me or something? If so, just tell me: je vais regler ton compte tout de suite. Btw, Andrei, how was NY? You know it would be nice to hear from a friend sometime, especially when he is back from NYC. Anyways, this was another borring day of stupid summer school (don't you people laugh at me while reading this). So if anyone of you feels bad or lonely on one of those "nice", "sunny" and "hot" summer days, just give me a buzz and we'll complain together. How fun, don't you think? Sorry for complaining guys, but I just had a little bit of inspiration. Take care, poeple.

 yeah whatever

 Wuzzup yo. Yeah man, "we're gonna rock this town alive" on June 14th. Dear Tygon, it may be kind of late for me to tell you this, but it's okay to have failed a course. Don't let yourself feel depressed, just remember "life is a b..ch and then you die" (just kidding). Anyhow, whoever you are, vladster, tygon, chessmaster (NYC guy) or even Wajdi, just take out the old suit that you wore at high school graduation and start ironing it. Because, after June 14th, you won't see it for the next 3 or 4 years. So be positive people and let the "fun stuff" begin. See ya brothas

 Almost forgot. Daily Log stats for May: 73 posts, 10,480 words, 57,727 characters. Wow! Look how much saved paper and waisted time! Keep it up peeps! Love ya'll!

 Hey NYC people! Andrei, how are you? You know, we don't miss you. Huh! Annie, you can keep'm there a little longer. I watched "Driven" again yesterday at Guzzo. Good stuff. Not too much of a plot, but a lot of F1 fun. Pretty cool movie. And, oh yeah, I'm not the first one who happens to LOVE Guzzo's seats. You just dissolve yourself in there for good two hours. It's a very important constituent of enjoying the movie..

 Hey guys, does anybody here have Photoshop? If so, can I borrow it for a day or so? I want to put some pics online, and I am freakin' tired of this "user friendly" Unlead software that came with the scanner. I wonder, will this post suffice for Adobe to sue me?

 This image reminds me of something (or somebody... or, perhaps, myself). Most likely all together. Source: urlLink harrumph.com

 Russo, you know, you surprise me sometimes. Please point your mouse to the keywords in my previous entry, and you'll see the search results. As you will also see there, those are not my comments, and I didn't write "mumu" or "bsdm". I found out about it from my traking system report. Buh-bye,

 Hey everyone, Vlad sorry about the non-paragraphing message. I agree with what you said, I would of been pretty annoyed with it myself. its all good :) Im going to be going to the radiohead concert this sunday, I am really excited about it. I cant wait to go. I hope they play some songs from their older albums. Does anyone here listen to radiohead at all? Well nothing new here in the wonderful word of web making. I just made some additions and editions to the site that the prof wanted me to make. Now I am sitting here listening to the voice of Thom Yorke typing on the keyboard, constantly checking my mail to see when the documents will come in from the prof. telling me what else I have to do on the site. For now the only thing I have to do is nothing. Alright well it looks like I am going ot have to be going to run some experiments on the reactor downstairs. Finally something to do. Well guys Talk to you later. bye bye

 Comments........ Waj, I agree & disagree with the song, I mean we are being controlled by technology but we are not there yet, not totally till we heve to work to get the technology improved........ and about the centering your images try absolute positioning and giving it coordinate to where you whant the layer with the image, this might not work in netscape, but it is worth riying, you know te sintax for layers possitioning, don't you? And the beloved Vlad, Tell me something who the hell writes words such as "mumu" or "bdsm" what does it mean any othe these? and also google generates automatic pages almost every time, so when I triedad the blog was not even close!!! and about the words such as "prety young" tell the truth you tiped that cuz u were looking for pretty and young girls right!!! anywayz........... c ya soon

 Holly ...!!! This page pops up first on Google for the keywords urlLink mumu bdsm . It also pops up 10th on Lycos for urlLink prety young . Now, guys, don't you find that it's... hm... should I say... disturbing?

 Hey Waj, no, you don't irritate anybody! However, would you please divide your posts into paragraphs somehow? It is SO hard to read a cloud of text like that. I hate to be annoying, but... anyway. I totally agree with you about the song though. I often think about things like that, but rarely say them aloud due to being afraid to look silly. You, know, most people are quite dull (yeah, whatever, call me arrogant, but you surely agree with me deep inside, I know), and the last thing you want is to look silly in dull people's eyes. Regards,

 Hello Boys and Girls. WHAT IS UP!!!!???? Really? that is interesting. Im listening to this song from Radiohead called "My Iron Lung" and there is this one line that stands out that reminded me of something, "when the power goes out we'll just hum". I remember being in a radiohead chat a few months ago and people were talking about this song, "My Iron Lung" and we all figured out that it was a song about how technology controls us and how without it we are nothing, we just sit there "humming" waiting for something to happen, waiting for the "machine" to do something to save us. No one does anything on their own anymore. "when the power goes out we'll just hum"...it explains itself....alright ill stop now.....Sometimes I just get in the mood to analyze songs and bash society, I do it alot and dont share it alot, anyway back to normal Wajdi.....how is everyone doing? Someone fell for the virus here at McGill and since everyone here is connected through the server, ALOT of computers are getting it and guess who got it as well? yes yours truly.....WAJDI!!!! Thank you....thank you, no need for aplause, thank you very much.....Well I just needed to take a little break editing the site and thought I will see how the guys are doing, I see Igar is having some fun being confused heheheeh :) Umm I have another question (hope im not irritating anyone with these questions, sorry if I am)....I made an image that will not center properly. It is basically the title of the site but its a gif and the thing is I cannot center it properly even by using HTML or MS.....anyone know what is going on? Oh I should mention that on some computers the alignment is fine, but my computer and another one have weird alignment.....alright back to work. Bye guys :) have fun :)

 ok, no hard feelingd, but what is this Jerry Springer nick name anyways??? and the spammer was actually supposed to be a deadly virus, we even got adviced at my job, "Quebec gouvernement" remember, to do not open this cuz it is werry dangerous, so ............. make conclutions

 Forget it Russo. I was just angry for some reason.

 Hey guys. Look at this. What a silly spammer: From: Reina Akl Date: Fri, 27 Jul 2001 14:34:52 -0400 Subject: Facture 529 To: artem@vladster.net ---------------------------------------------- Hi! How are you? I send you this file in order to have your advice See you later. Thanks Facture 529.doc.com (Binary attachment) ---------------------------------------------- Even my thirteen-year-old brother knew right away it was a virus. Get a freakin' life you goatish beef-witted boar-pigs!

 irritating??? read what??? irrelevant comments? what the hell r u talking about???

 What the hell is your problem Russo? You're becoming irritating. Please read carefully before putting irrelevant comments. Wajdi, the browser won't stretch the pic. It will tile it over the screen by default. The background of this page, for instance, consists of tiled 1x1 pixel gifs.

 and try optimizing ur pic with adobe to make it lighter

 i didn't really get ur question but a guess is try this: &lt;BODY background=image.jpg bgproperties="fixed" &gt;

 wht do u mean by "tile effect"? and jerry, is vlads name inside the blog if u c..........

 hey guys, Im back again to ask another web question. I have a picture that I want to put on as a background. Thing is it is 1 meg, so I am going to shrink it. However how do I make the background have a tile effect. Because it is just going to stretch the picture and make it look ugly. Need to get back to work. Thanks alot for the help guys :)

 Hey guys, Here I am with about 12 windows open. Programs like Adobe, IE, word, picture editor, leap FTP, notepad (for real programming :)) and of course real player because without music I would go insane. Vlad thanks for the code. I really appreciate it. I am guessing that is a java script because of the onclick command right? I will figure it out. Thanks alot :). So Igar what are you talking about this Jerry Springer thing? I dont understand. Well I have alot of work to do today and I have a meeting to go to with the prof in about a half hour. So I should be going. good day :)

 and who the hell is Jerry Springer, ur new ...... u all know what I mean, don't ya?

 very funny vladster Mr "I'll include a link back", hehehe

 OK, Waj, here's the trick. Include onclick="top.close();" into the tag when targeting the link back to your initial window. The active window will try to close. However, some paranoid browsers may ask if the the user wants to close the window. Secondly, I am completely unaware what will happen in Nescrape (but who cares anyway). I hope that helps. And, no, you are not required to credit me in any way. Have fun.

 Hey Waj, I didn't really understood ur question but from what I got I can ask u that how r u going back to the other page if it is by an url link then the solution to ur problem should be a simple javascript that plays with the history it is something like onclick history(-1) the exact spelling i do not have it on me right now but can be found if requested ;-), man I am gonna exige partial credits on ur site hehehe, a simple tag such as "powered by IPASystems" hehehe ok so if u think that the java script might help tell me I have it at home c ya, what was the url of the site u r working on again?

 Hey guys whats up. How are things. Good? Im having fun here using that HTML. Today I was made fun of because I do the coding all myself. I think the fun part about the website is programming and writing out the code. So I was convinced to use a web designer. However I did not want all the coding to go to waste. So what I did is that I wrote out a basic layout for the site and then used MS to just edit and make it look pretty. Nothing special. Ummm I had a question though. One of my links opens a new window. However there is a link in that new window to go back to a previous page how can I automatically close that window so the new one will appear right away instead of having to click on the new page. Thanks for the help :) Time to get back to the fun. bye bye

 Hey, yeah, sorry Igar, I can't go. You're totally right about frames. No one likes them anymore. No one ever liked them. Frames is a nice idea technically, but they conflict with human intuition. That's where one looses in usability. We (humans) are still into papers, books etc. And when you read printed material, you don't expect the table of contents to stay in place when the page is flipped, even though it would seem more convenient. We've been flipping pages for centuries, and it will take awhile to get used to reading from radiating displays. Kill the frames.

 Hey whats up guys. Ok, Igar I forgot to answer your question. Here is the answer. The professor in the Wong building is a good friend of my dads, and he asked my dad if I would like to come in to help them out with stuff. So I said yes, and then he made me a research assistant. So now I am here being a research assistant, making websites, drawing reactors and conducting experiments. That is the low down on my job. good? good. I have a question to ask to people going to Concordia. After we register for our classes what is left to be done? or do we just wait for that orientation at the end of August? Btw, guys, I found 5 mullets when I was at La Ronde on saturday. If you guys do not know what a mullet is go to urlLink Mullets Galore Its really funny :) I think mullets are funny looking people. If they just did something about that hair, maybe they would actually be considered normal. Those mullets. Funny little people. Well guys, its time to get to work, have a nice day and watch out, there are going to be fireworks tonight :) hehehe :)

 Waza, Waj tired, hehehe, yep u got the answer right u just target the links from one frame to another or from one frame to itself nothing from the other world, if any other questions feel free to ask, but why r u using frames? frames suck and suck badly suck so much that no one likes them aymore!!! ok but if that is the only way well good lucck, and u still havent told me how did u find the job. Now, Vlad, man thanx for not providing me with any answer about the canoe-camping thing, now is too late, but still don't I deserve just a "sorry man, can not go" man, that is kinda rude u know.............. Next, Andrei you pimp, now u r doing 11 years old boys, man, tah is pervertion at it's maximum!!!!!!!!!!!

 WEIRD Somebody found this blog by typing " urlLink prety young " into the Spanish version of Lycos. Cewl eh?

 Andrei? What's wrong with the background? We called the guy yesterday. He doesn't know yet. I'll call him next week again. It will most likely work out, but I can't commit to the contract until I'm sure. Hope you understand.

 Hey hey its me again hey Igar about helping me with that coding, nevermind I just remembered. I had to just set a target in the link. Wajdi tired, Wajdi need sleep, Wajdi not sleeping very well....hehehehe............Alright guys, time to get back to work and go at that HTML!!!!....and java. hehe ;)

 Hey guys. Sorry I have not posted anything in a while. Been pretty busy these past few days. Ummm I just had a sudden case of amnesia with HTML and I forgot how to use frame commands. Igar, is there anyway you can help me out. I got pretty frustarated when I forgot and now I am so frustrated I dont want to think. I am trying to get a link to open up the page on the frame opposing it instead of in the same frame. What I mean is that i want one frame to stay the same and the other one to change. Know what I mean? Sorry for the dumb question. I just completely forgot how to do it. Anyone here interested in fishing??? I went last year with a few of my friends, it was pretty fun. Well I should get back to work. I need to try to get this thing to work. Bye bye :)

 Hello Ladies and Gentlemen! Nice layout Vlad, the back ground is quite original. By the way, for all who thought that I won't be able to stay single for more then two days, well, it's been a week...it's pretty sad. And I'm not really planning to get into any relationship within next one or two days either. Later everything is possible :) Ah, yeah, feel like sharing, I'm deaf on my left ear. And it's not a joke. I hope it will be better by the end of this week; and I'm also covered in scratches and brouses. Don't ask why and how...I work in a Camp... You guys want to do something Friday or Sunday night? BTW, VLAD, the Cirque has a party this Friday, and the person responsible for the actors will be there, forgot his name. I might go there for like an hour or something; come also, you can talk him there. All right, I'm out, have to get back to work ( a group of 28 eleven-year-old boys). hehe the funnest age ever!! (Gosh) Bye Bye.

 hey guys, whats up. Im here at Mcgill taking a small break. Wanted to know if you guys were doing anything soon, I would really like to meet up with you dudes soon....Back to work. l8er guys

 thanx 4 the invitation zhenia, but too late ;-( Waj, to put that sort of applet on ur site it ain't that hard, u can get it everywhere, the thing is will it have a real pourpoise? and, what was that, what vlad said that this kind of job u don't find it by sending ur c.v. did ur dad help u or soemthing???, can he help me??? please??? c, ya,

 Ok guys. I know it's a little late to anounce this, but if you can makeit it would be fun. Today, we're having a little BBQ party at Audrey's house. Feel free to come. It's at 457 Springfield, corner of Maple, in Greenfield Park (south shore). You have to go to Longueuil metro and take bus #15. So come if you feel like it. It's around 5 or 6 pm today. Any questions, call me at (450)651-9390 or Audrey at (514)923-0055. Once again, sorry for the late notice, it was not for sure before.

 Waj, I have no idea. I would pay to know how. By the way, I remember talking to Mr. Kozinski once at an orientation session. I asked him if I had chances with a 33.4 r-cote, silly. :)

 Hey whats up guys, Andrei Congratulations on the tournament, way to go :) Ummm Igar no more stealing IP's hehe :). The adress for the site I am working on is ( I hope I can code in HTML on blogger, here we go: urlLink Minmet I still did not touch the website, this is what is left from the last guy who played around with it. I am still waiting for the password so that I can start editing the site. I have alot of work to do. Igar thanks for the url to check out the 3d tour. I want to learn how to code that, it would be awesome :) Well guys its time to leave now I am getting pretty tired and I had a looooooong day sitting on the couch playing Gran Turismo 3 with my neighbour. Yes it was hard winning the clubman circuit, but guys we did it in the little Miata after we riced it up to 291 horse power grrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.........oh btw Vlad, ummm Z3?????????????? you lucky bastard, how? must of been a realy nice ride :) Alright guys, goodnight

 Wassup everybody!? I got back from the tourney this tuesday. It was pretty fun, I tied for 57th place in the open section ( the highest) out of 228 people. I finished 5/9 (3 wins, 4 draws, and 2 loses). And now I'm damn tiered since I worked all week starting the day I came. Congradulations on graduating guys!! I'd say we can pull off a party this week-end. :) Vlad, depends for what and for whom you want the perfume. What's the address of the site you're working on Waj? Alright, bye, bye

 Thanks Waj. That's what I chose too. Coming back to your comment about 3D tour, urlLink Carleton has one. Although the U itself isn't the best around, they got one of the most user-friendly websites I've seen. To Igar: I would assume that the kind of jobs that Wajdi has is not found by faxing a CV :)). And stop looking up people's IP's through my stats! :)) Igar, don't take everything I say personally. I like you (not this way, f*ckin' pervert!) but it's just way too funny to tease you time after time! OK guys, listen to this. It happened today at 8:30 AM. I am sitting in the office minding my own business (actually, playing minesweeper) looking blankly at the screen and trying hard to remain unnoticed by my omnipresent boss for a little longer. Suddenly, I notice a poetically fearful and divinely proportional, Nikita-like silhouette in the ugly white door frame. Into the room SHE comes. I can feel the smell of an expensive perfume rushing into my nose and my heart rate blasting off to the outer limits of the mesosphere... I am trying to say "good morning", but all I can pronounce at the moment is a rather unintelligible sound resembling the belching of an awakening rhinoceros, which she, apparently, likes. SHE comes closer, (oh god!) TOUCHES THE BACK OF MY monitor and says: "Vlad, your monitor is HOT..." I feel my back sweating like hell, and my whole body is starting to shake. Soon, I realize that I'm shaking so hard that the chair that I sit on is beginning to creak. No, this can't be happening! I turn around and see my boss shaking the chair behind me and yelling "Wake up!". I look back, SHE is gone!!! Oh no, it was a dream. Well... not really. I got a ride to the metro in a Z3 after work. But, f*ck!!! She is like... 27. Again! No, there won't be any of it this time. Promise. Besides, I'm still confused about my feelings for some other person. Pathetic as it is, I just felt like sharing.

 Waj, how did u find that job??? u got pertty cool contacts here, btw, is this ur IP adress? 198.168.178.6 ? hehe... and channel all the way, classic and cool

 Hey hey, Answering your question Igar I have a job at Mcgill working with the metallurgical department with a phd research group. I am redesigning their website completely, it is a site basically about the research they are doing and information and stuff about the students. I am not sure how much I am going to get payed but I do know it is going to be a nice sum :) It is pretty cool. I like :) So how is everyone doing? btw Vlad ummm I would go with Channel or ummmm yeah, go with Channel

 Vlad, F. U. and thank you for ur kind words, notice the irony there!!!! Waj, what site are you working on, how did u find the job, what is the pay etc, etc....??? sounds interesting............!!!!!!!!!!!

 "Good artists copy, great artists steal" Bullshit. Guys and gals, I have a dilemma: Nina Ricci, Paloma Picasso, Hugo Boss or Channel. Please help. No nonsense.

 Party sounds good Just tell me a few days in advanced so I can get the night off guaranteed :) I am here at mcgill looking through the website to see what kind of changes have to be done. I have to redisgn the site completely and give it a new look. should be fun to get my hands back into html. Im thinking about adding some java to it. Or making a crazy aplet to allow people to take a 3d tour of the facility. That would be sooooo sweet. I think im getting a little out of my league here with that aplet idea :). Im really happy here. Its a nice job. I get a beautiful computer the room has ac the people are nice and the hours are very flexible. and its fun, cause its what I want to do. Not only that I get to listen to my MD at the same time so I dont get bored :) Listening to my Md right now, niiiice music :) Gotta love radiohead :). I am right now alternating between making the comments about the site and writing on the blog. I started writing this message like 10 minutes ago. I dont know how long I am going to make it. If I make it too long that would be pretty boring for people reading it. wouldnt it now? :) Well I am really hungry and it is lunch time and I did alot of work already :) So I think I am going to treat myself to a nice lunch bye guys. oh and please contact me if there is something going on. would love to see you guys soon :) l8er

 Party sounds good......... let me know, so, everyone is leaving me fucking alone in Vanier, f. u. guys, what am I gonna do there all by my self??? anywayz one more semester and I am out too. Vlad, you, it seems to methat you do not know what of a website you really want, my advise is sit and start drawing sketches of what it should look like, of course the final version is nothing as those sketches but just to put an image of what you want in your brain, by the way I am starting to write tutorials on JavaScript on my site, www.ipasyst.com remember, it is kinda advanced programming level, so if you, as you said, know all the basics take a look at it. also theory color is not as important as originality and new ideas, ofcourse you won't put green with ogange, but do not spend as much time in that, it would be better to invest that time is browsing the web and looking what you like, and starto to do something that looks like something that you like, it is not copying it is molding views, as I like to call it, the best site I've ever seen u know it www.ozones.com he has many good ideas in his sits so look at all of them, also u might like goldeneyedesign don't know the url, so relax and if u aint an artist remember this cool phrase that some computer knowledgeable guys repeated from van ghog or picasso,: "Good artists copy, great artists steal"

 Congrats to you guys. I know exactly what you feel, and it makes me a little jealous. Party sounds good. How about Friday, Saturday, Sunday and... (heck!) Monday too! "737"? "Groove Society"? "Dome"? "Extreme"? "Thursdays", anyone? :)) I also haven't been to that Guzzo pool place across Place Vertu for quite a while. Choose and let me know.

 Yes, yes,yes. IT'S ALL OVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEER. So dudes, get ready to party. Oh yeah Wajdi you're so right, it's al over. Hahaha. Anyway I'm just very happy. So I'm goona go home now. Dudes, it's time to Salsa.

 Hey guys, Its all over, the summer class is over and I ended it with a bang. BOOM BOOM. So happy, so happy. Its all over, and now its time to have the summer of nothing. What a beautiful summer it will be. A summer filled with nothing. Nothing at all. oooooh yeah. Well I am writing from vanier and I really want to leave because I should. So This is going to be a short one. Good bye everyone, talk to you guys soon. l8er

 Wow! Look who's back from France! How was it, Mo? You owe us a HUGE entry here!

 Well guys I am down to the last few hours of studying for my last exam for summer school. and the best part, I cant screw up. I love it. P-A-R-T-Y. Well I just felt like postiong something up for the hell of it so im gonna get back to my show "statics/engineering physics". Bye guys, oh and yeah I checked out the standings and last I checked Andrei was 79, congratulations Andrei way to go :) alright time to hit the books. bye people ;)

 does anyone now where mo is??

 Man, so much stuff happened here over the week-end. It seems as if there was war or something. Wajdi, I feel so sorry that you got burned. It must hurt a lot, right. Well, look, if you never got cheated on, there is certainly someone to take care of you. Andrei, how are you doing? I saw your sister in the metro today. She told me that you're like in the first 80 or something. Alright man, I hope you won something. Btw, Wajdi, it's true that summer school is almost over. Don't you feel like partying (actually I do it every day anyway). Listen up everyone, soon we're gonna all do something. If Audrey has a chance to read this, please call me. How do guys like the weather lately? Nice, don't you think? Alright, my last exam is on Wednesday and I need about 33% to pass. I think it's gonna be "tough". Ok, I'll shut up, nothing else to say. See you all soon.

 Hey guys, Vlad thank for understanding how hard it is to deal with the rotten cheese and whole wheat bread. Atleast you understand the dilemma im going through. Well I went to the waterslides on saturday and my god am I burned. I have never been this burned before. I have 1st degree burns, and DAMN my nipples hurt, im burned everywhere, I cant move properly atleast this tylenol is working properly, taking away some of that pain :) and this cream is not doing that great of a job. Im glad that im already more than passing my course because I really dont feel like studying for tomorrow's exam, im just gonna write everything on my formula sheet. About me being cheated on....NO I did not get cheated on Andrei, no no no.....things are aaall good :) and good luck Andrei with the tournament.kick ASS!!!!!!!!! Well guys its time to vegitate on my couch for an hour or so before I go to class. Take it easy guys see you soon....and Vlad ill take your offer on getting me another job :) ill work both mcgill and the Vlad job!! :) alright guys, take it easy :)

 "A modern paradox is that it's simpler to create complex interfaces because it's so complex to simplify them." Nice urlLink article featured on the urlLink digital web about design simplicity.

 Wassup guys? How is it going? I'm not really following the conversation here... Did Waj get cheated on?? or something? What the hell? I need some more explanation, or Waj if you need some help, well, you know, the "russian trio"... :) By the way, the tourney sort of sucks so far, you can follow it on www.worldopen.com I have 3/5 with 4 rounds to go, and I'm getting sick (I think). What esle? Everything else is fine if you know what I mean. Today I've cut a watermelon with plastic knife :) And if anyone wants a pic of my g-f, well, I can show it to you Faisal if you really want. Anyway, take care people and wish me luck. Good bye.

 Russo: So far, I've been blessed. I've never cheated and have never been cheated on.I would like it to stay this way as long as possible. Thanks for the advice about spylog. I don't really need coordinates. I use Dreamweaver, forgot? :) Anyway, I like the new system better. Rape Vlad ??? C'mon baby, you don't have to be so rude... just ask... ;o) You're not right about Wajdi though, It f*ckin' sucks to be him! Poor guy's having so much trouble with that rotten cheese and whole wheat bread...! Don't they pay him enough at McGill to buy some food? If so, man, call me, I'll get you a better place. :)

 wajdi, stop bitching about everythin man many people would wish to have your troubles, no? Fais, I dunno, but poor guy, imagin how he must have felt! maybe he went crazy for a wile and did what he did, and Vlad it is not your fault if that "biatch" cheeeats on you, come on , u never got ur little tiny heart broken? get real!!!

 You guys wazaaaaaaa, ok u r fun talking and stuff but come on let's get toghether someday this weekend...... to have a beer or to rape Vlad, whatever pleases you guys, :-) Talking about vlad, you, if u r tired of the pic of spylog, y don't u cover it with a layer of the same color as you backgroud? Here is how to do it in ie: &lt;DIV ID="layer1" STYLE="position:absolute;left:360;top:70;width:150;visibility:visible"&gt; &lt;IMG ="http://www.url_of_the_image_color_of_your_background.jpg" border=0 name=layer1 &gt; &lt;/DIV&gt; use it, just give the coordinates from the left and the top to cover exactly over your counter and that is it, and pay attention to the order of the layers which cover wich. so guys, come on let's enjoy this winter, sorry canadian summer, a picnic or something!!!!!!!!??? what do u say about his sunday???

 Traur v strane. Novosti ne vozmozhno smotret.

 Alright im mad, I just wrote a blog and then all of a sudden what happens? It all gets erased. and I had a whole paragraph about nothing too. Aw well. Im writing from mcgill right now. I am going to leave soon so I can catch the train to get to class. Only three more classes left and its all over :) soon my time at summer school will be replaced with time spent at mcgill. a fair trade :) You know what I feel like doing? Playing a trick on someone like they do on spy tv. Like this one episode where this guys friends played a trick on him by getting him arrested for shop lifting. It was hilarious :) we should try that one day. what do you think? I actually slept at 12 last night, for the first time in like 2 months. Pretty interesting eh? You know what really pisses me off though? rotten cheese in a fridge. When you are hungry and you feel like having a cheese sandwich and you go to make yourself this cheese sandwich, but there is this HUGE WHITE piece of mold, sometimes green that grows on that food you have been craving for the past 10 minutes...SO NOW WHAT???? only one solution left...put on my shoes and go to the supermarket to buy cheese, because when I want my cheese I get my cheese dammit. So when I get back, I find that there is only whole wheat bread.......WHOLE WHEAT!!!!!!!! whats up with that??? I dont want no healthy food...I want my bread without the healthy stuff, I want it white. Alright so that is enough complaining for me for one day. I have to get going now so I can go catch my train and get to class, maybe on my way I can stop by my house and make myself a sandwich :) Alright guys. its been fun talking about nothing for one day See you soon :)

 I dunno ur probably right vlad. hey Andrei, for the public at this blog, how bout a pic or something of your girlfriend. Not a naked one, u sick pervert, just a normal one. Geez we would like to see the person you talk to us always about :) Im out peace

 Yeah, I heard a dozen versions of this story over a couple of years, and what I want to say is that the guy must be pretty dumb. First of all, bride's parents have nothing to do with their daughter being unfaithful to her boyfriend... nor do all those people who came to the wedding. He humiliated himself in front of 300 friends and relatives and gained a reputation of a looser. He must've looked so pathetic I would laugh my ass off. I'm sorry, it's bad, but I feel no compassion for these guys. I think it's your fault if your girlfriend cheats on you. It is your fault either because you aren't "good enough" (not necessarily sexually!) or because you let a b!tch be by your side.

 Read this: Below is a true story about a recent wedding that took place at Clemson University: This was a huge wedding with about 300 guests. After the wedding, at the reception, the groom got up on stage at the microphone to talk to the crowd. He said that he wanted to thank everyone for coming, many from long distances, to support them at their wedding. He especially wanted to thank the bride's and groom's families for coming and to thank his new father-in-law for providing such a fabulous reception. To thank everyone for coming and bringing gifts and everything, he said he wanted to give everyone a special gift from just him. So taped to the bottom of everyone's chair was a manila envelope, including the wedding party. He said that this was his gift to everyone, and told everyone to open the envelopes. Inside each manila envelope was an 8x10 picture of his best man having sex with the bride. He had gotten suspicious of the two of them and hired a private detective to trail them weeks prior to the wedding. After he stood there and watched the people's reactions for a couple of minutes, he turned to the best man and said "F--- you", he turned to the bride and said "F--- you", and then he turned to the dumbfounded crowd and said "I'm out of here." He had the marriage annulled first thing that Monday morning. While most of us would have broken off the engagement immediately after finding out about the affair, this guy goes through with it anyway as if nothing was wrong. His revenge: Making the bride's parents pay over $32,000 for 300 guest wedding and reception. Letting everyone know exactly what did happen. And best of all, trashing the bride's and best man's reputations in front of all of their friends, their entire families i.e. their parents, brothers, sisters, grandparents, nieces and nephews, etc. This guy has balls the size of church bells. --------------------------------------------------- and evgeni ur the salsa dude

 Thank you so much sweety! I appreciate it. Really, really looking forward to meeting you! By the way, we (I, that is) can make you a full member of this "blog", if you will. Just urlLink let me know . We want some kinky stuff to rage about :)). Russo, there was no birthday party so far. I was thinking about doing something in two weeks. I'll let you guys know. Jeka, nice nick... hm! People, I've got an idea. Send to me a picture of something representing you in some way. It could be anything from a 3D tetracycline model (TyGoN) to shampoo (Russo). I'll put it onto this page. Send all you've got to vlad@vladster.net. Blog stats for June: posts = 56; words = 4,979; characters = 27,748; point = none :)

 Well, well, well. Hello Annie. It's about time we communicate with you a little bit too. Andrei told us about you and we are very anxious to find out who you are. So tell me how's NYC? Is it like really cool? Because I'm planning on going this summer. Anyway, I won't keep too buzy reading it, go take care of Andrei. Can you please make sure he wins the championship, or else we won't take him back to Montreal. So HUGS and KISSES Annie, and hope to meet you one day (Andrei don't get mad). So how's everyone else doing? Now, Mr. Russo, what's with the Paint Ball all the time? Don't tell me it's that much fun. Guys, summer school is almost over and I'm feeling great about it. Wajdi, don't you think so. So take care everyone and I'll see you all soon. P.S. I have a new nick name, try to guess who I am (I hope it's not to hard).

 Happy B-Day Vladimirrrrrrrr, man shit, I am older than you for almost a year, so more respect here!!!! ;o) by the way what is the plan, r we invited somewhere??? P.S, thatnx 4 the interest in paint ball, I am also looking forward to it, but we need more people, the one in front guzzo, is not that good, the big-foot one even has one helicopter and an anfibious sort of tank, man imagine the possibilities ;-)

 Bon Soir everybody!!!!!!!!!! Vlad, darling!!! HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

 Hey russo, Thanks for the advice and stuff. I appreciate it. I guess I would be very worried if you liked the layout :). I'm fine with this one for the time being. I like black'n'white. There is Paintball next to the Guzzo movie theater across the street from the Place Vertu. Been there a couple of times. I'm not really fond of this stuff. I don't know about the rest of the crowd, but I'm not in, sorry. 'night. P.S. Igar, next time you post, press TEAM -> EDIT MY PROFILE, and enter your nickname please. You are welcome to use the ABC button in there too. :))

 Guys & girls, me again............, this time to formally invite you to play paint ball, I did my homework and found this site urlLink http://www.bigfoot-paintball.com this is the chapest and clousest to mtl that I could find, it offers a pretty desent package, we need someone or better said someones with cars since in is like 20 min from mtl. and it would also be nice to have a big group, invite ur friends, brothers "sisters" children, lovers, etc, etc....... come on I think it is gonna be nice... c ya, russssssssssoooooo

 waza!!! first, Vlad, sorry don't like new design, too black and white for my taste, the former was nicer, you just could have incerted some graphics or design an interface 9in photoshop or something, this black pictures are too sad, a way too sad, come on, who died??? we r youn healty, full of life and u come with this black and white thing, man change it, I am not sayin' this to hurt you just telling what I really think, andother advise before posting a layout for publick view make it for yourself , look at it love it or hate it and then post it... as I said the former was with more class, and if u need help don't hesitate in asking me.... c, ya second, guys I am planing in buying a bisicle but the prices change so vastly, and the only difference that i c is that one is blue and the other one is yellow, I plan to buy one today so any replies before 4:30 pm will be wellcome c ya luvs ya, me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

 Hey Vlad, I just wanted to wish you a happy birthday. I'm really sorry, I couldn't call you today. I was working all day and it was buzy. However, I'll still call you tomorrow. Have a good night man.

 Hey guys, how do you like those dear to our hearts pics?

 The thing you found, Faisal, is the Electrical Engineering program rankings only. The link on the bottom of the page will take you to the overall rankings. Yes, I'm sure the guy just wanted us to feel proud of ourselves. As for med schools, it's very simple. Med people usually apply to all the schools there exist. Thus, if the applicant is good, she gets 2 or even 3 admission offers from different institutions. Therefore, for a given number of universities, there are much more admission offers than actual freshmen. You can even calculate the number of offers per applicant from those tables.

 i found urlLink something by the same ranking and Concordia's 23 instead of 25 and Mcgill is 2 instead of 1. I wonder... One more thing I find unbelievable. Check urlLink this out, go all the way down. Look at the table where it mentions offers and places filled . The number of applicants is about 10 times the number of places offered but then why is the number of places filled smaller than the number offered !!!! In some places only half of the places are filled!!!! Someone explain to me please cuz i'm gonna crack!!!! One more thing.... "first time ever in history this year the grade requirements for admission into ECE at McGill were higher than those needed to get into Medicine " T he Engineering may be the best in Canada, but it will never surpass the requirements for Medecine. Last I checked people with CRC of 34 and average of 90 have not been allowed in Medecine, but others with CRC 29 and marks 80-85 have been. I think the guy just wanted to incite you guys. anywayz have fun. I'm sure I will. peace im out

 Roman, here's something of interest to you, since you're interested in urlLink rankings .

 Hey!!! Mulanda the egghead! How did YOU get in here? :)) There used to be a few gals, but I guess they got lost somehow... Let me try this one: I guess they couldn't handle the intellectual intensity of our elevated conversations. :)) I hope this will get the scarce female population of this blog furious. To those of you who don't know what nurse Roman and I are talking about. The Nurse is a girl we worked with in a camp last summer. She was a very hot nurse assistant. I was hm... a little head-over-hills with her (as well as most of the male contingent of the camp). She wouldn't even look at me. Well... that was not entirely true. I just fucked up the whole thing though. As always. But it's funny stuff to remember. Cheers,

 hey everybody??!!! how come nobody told me about this place!!!! it rocks and sucks at the same time. Is this like an all guys haven??! I All i see are guys posting stuffffff. Are there any girls posting stuffffff here?? Well they better be some, coz vlad is russian and russians always bring girls with them. Let me know about it, Ok?. Any ways i am not gonna bore you guys any longer, school starts in a week and i wish everybody alll the best in their programs.

 How come I always thought she's from Ottawa. Damn, that article is right, my memory starts failing :(

 Hey people! urlLink Look how many familiar names! Note that there's no Dean's Honours. I can't believe none of the graduates pulled an overall ninety last winter. Damn, I was so close!!!!!!!! 0.2 %!!!!!!!!! Should've handed in those astrophysics assignments. Sorry...

 Hi Roman! The nurse was from Kingston, ON. I do still maintain (what a big word) the blog. The banner to your left is all could find. If you have anything else, email it to me.

 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. The National Capital is online. Well. ..Well...well... Who is responsible for this blog? Does Vlad still run it, or is it someone else now? Whoever you are, post a UofO banner on the friends page, so to reflect the fact of my long awaited admission. And..I always wanted to know who is Faisal. Evgeni, Andrei, and Vlad tried to explain me, but I still don't know who the hell is he. Faisal, do I know you ? I really want to say this : It seems that we, or at least just I, are really obsessed with rankings and all that :) What I think, it's only you who makes it, of course name and reputation of the school helps, but still, it's pretty much yourself who has to work to succed. I feel obliged to inform u guys, girls in Hull are really good looking, as for Ottawa chicks they are soooo ugly and fat. (well, most of them). I can't believe that THE NURSE was actually from Ottawa.

 Hey! Look who's urlLink here ! Jaques man!

 Well, Faisal, I must admit I agree that such universities as Duquesnes build a strong character. The main reason of the institution being highly religious is to reinforce discipline, both mental and physical. And that's a very good thing. The disadvantage here is that it affixes a permanent seal onto the students' views. Off subject, here's something quite scary I ran into recently. urlLink Are you ready to start deteriorating?

 Yes, yes, yes. I'm back on the blog for today guys. Missed me? So why is Andrei crying alone? Why don't we all get together sometime to drink and cry before school starts? As Andrei said, there must be a lot of things said about the summer. I know Vlad was proposing something for tonight. So I hope to hear from you guys. Later people

 Well I am back in Canada. Actually I am in Toronto in another freind's house. And I have a lot to tell you about Pittsburgh, my freinds. I visited about every University in Pennsylvania. There are three of them. There is Duquesnes that I have told you about. And there is Pittsburgh University and Carnagie Mellon University. Carnagie Mellon very recently was ranked first in United States for Computer related sciences. That includes the engineering component as well. Pittsburgh University is an overall good university. I looked at its structures and was amazed by its interior. It is very similar to a cathedral. I have taken numerous pictures of it and will post them up very soon. Duquesnes on the other hand is very modern. Its infrastructure is late last century glass building design. I have already mentioned to you about the eductaion system and was quite amazed about their science program. They do not have a diverse science program such as Concordia or McGill. What struck me as funny is that they are proud that their University builds character !!! On a brief note, I was very impressed by the history that resides in the Pittsburgh University buildings. Wait till you see them. They look more like cathedral towers and curches than schools. Anywayz I will post up soon. P.s: Why is Andrei crying. tell me all about it. Have I missed something? Im out peace

 Hello everybody, long time no writing. So much stuff to tell, so many stories had happened this summer. Well, it's not over yet. I'm at Vanier College right now. I can't belive it. It feels so weired, all these....kids.... :-0. hehe. Sorry, I'm just being mean. Anyway, school starts in a week guys, ahhhh, now it's time for drinking and crying :p . Who is going to Evgueni's danse party today at 9:00 on metro beaubien on St-Hubert street at his danse school? I am. Have fun guys, I'm heading home.

 Hi again. I'm totally bored. Evgueni just called. He and Andrei are drinking vodka there alone. Andrei is drinking and crying; Evgueni is keeping a company; I here blog and feel compassionate. Been readin' thru urlLink old stuff lately (remember to read bottom-to-top). Youth, spring, love... I don't like the way it all came to an end (oh, did it ever begin). I think I've been misunderstood. I think I had misunderstood myself. Sorry?

 Yeah, I'm getting pretty interested in robotics, especially things like Canadarm on ISS. You're right, I should've got involved at Vanier, but I didn't quite appreciate some of the people there (none of you guys on this blog). What I saw from outside was a lot of pompous talks and very little real action. I might've been mistaken though; don't make a big deal of it. As for the site, I think it will stay blogger-powered for the time being. So far there have been no forecasts of the blogger.com turning commercial, and even if it ever does, there are alternatives out there. Having used it for almost a year, I really like the concept. The design is totally up to you guys.

 ok, thanks for the cheers ups (is that a word?) anywayz, I fell fine,,,,, Faizzz, what does this mean exactly "Big Universities protect students from their own mediocrity. " I didn't really understood this phrase...... but is cool.......... Personally I think that humanity itself is not ready yet for this cloning thing.......... but go ahear Fais, impove the human race....!!! Vlad, why would you give up to the idea of taking out the page.......??? it is pretty cool that you got all of us cennected, it is cool.........!!! About the design of the site, I have many, but really many ideas about it, some of them you might like and some of them you might hate, but if you want to head them write me an e-mail, ideas such as stop using the blogger software cuz it might get to be paid sooner or later, I am almost done with a perl scrpt that will almost do the job, but it needs server right to do the right performance, also some lay out ideas, colors..... add ons............ etc... Changing topic, Vlad, I c you ur apetit for robotics just woke up??? hehehe, you shuold have had tried at Vanier it was pretty cool, right Fais? Wajdi, what happened to ur site, it is not there anymore??? come on do not hide your master piece....... ok, bye for now........ Ah almost forgot, can anyone give me advise with Masao Chen, I have him for Prob & Stat we are only 13 in the class..... it is scary.

 Hello fellows. It seems to me the blog is coming to life again. Very well, very well. Faisal, I totally agree with you about big universities. Also, I am an ardent opponent of religion interfering with ethics and education. That is the main reason I fiercely dislike George W. B. Don't get me wrong though - I am not a atheist. As a matter of fact, most of the commonly accepted ethics strikingly resembles the fundamentals of the prevailing world religions. That notwithstanding, in my opinion, one can still lead a perfectly "good" and sensible life not being religious at all. In any case, I better stop there or I will get carried away by my own words and will lose my point, which was nonexistent to begin with. There is so much information about biology (genetics and cloning in particular) being poured onto people's heads these days that nobody seems to have a well-defined point of view (not to be confused with strong belief). Some folks especially like the word engineering after genetical . Me too, I think it sounds pretty neat. For more such stuff check out a few last issues of the Canadian edition of the Time Magazine . The Mad Scientist is back. Keep us up to date Faisal. I like the atmosphere you bring into this discussion. To tell the truth, I was about to abandon the whole idea of keeping this site up, but you made me change my mind. Congrats to Roman! You finally made it! We should definitely meet before you leave. Cheer up Igar! I'm sure you'll join the rest of the crowd soon. Get your stuff together and finish with a blast! Also, guys. I would like to make things more interesting here by adding a page containing info about the participants of the discussion. Please use the form on the home page to write a brief self-description (don't worry if you get an error - I will receive the message in any case). If you want a picture of you to be placed there as well, send it to vlad@vladster.net. Also, send me any suggestions you might have about a new design of this page. Let's make it a team effort! Regards everyone,

 Good morning all, I trust everyone is fine. Can anyone guess where I am?? I am not in Canada. I am in the United States but not in New York or Washington. Any guesses?? I am in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the library of Duquennes University. Yes that's right. I came here to visit a friend. I have visited the entire facility. It is a private catholic institution. I have to tell you, I am amazed by the hi-techness of this place. As I expected, their views in science on ethical subjects are one-sided. What struck me as very funny was the ressemblance to the movie,"Dead poet's society". You can see everywhere proud parents accompanying their "children", walking with them up the hill, patting them on the back. Smiles run wild. Pride is stuck everywhere. This entire institution is based on principles and rules of the catholic morals and ethics. What happens in the dorms are anything but that. It takes a student to know one. I talked to some fellow science student concerning the discipline and their science education they receive. I have to say the secret that I learned from a fellow friend at Cambridge is true. Big Universities protect students from their own mediocrity. Alas that is true. I thought that was only true in the UK. That same is the truth in the US. I asked couple of students, apprently holding GPA's higher than 3.5, about some notions in genetics. Their answers and opinion sickens me. I can feel the pain of the parents who send their students with their hard earned money. Anyway that's my two cents on this university for now. I'll be back soon to keep you up to date. Im out peace

 Wasting half a year at Vanier, really thanx Roman that makes me fell so fucked up!!! fuck class started this monday and as you people c I am not happy at all!!!!!! anywayz congrats Rom, good luck in the capital......

 Hi guys! It's Roman again, yeah! So you all graduated ? hehe, i'm leaving Vanier too, just got letter of acceptance to Comp. Eng. at UofO, whatever, the school might not be the best, but still I don't have to waste half a year at Vanier. So......I'm leaving to Ottawa soon, I even got a room already.. Anyway, take care ppl, cya around

 Hey Waj. The best way to add moseover effect for text links is using style sheets. I will again refer you to the front page. It's very simple: &lt;STYLE type="text/css""&gt; &lt;!-- a:link { text-decoration: underline; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; color: #000000} a:visited { font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; text-decoration: underline; color: #000000} a:hover { font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; text-decoration: underline; color: #000000} --&gt; &lt;/STYLE&gt; Substitute your own colours and decorations (bold, itallic or underline). Remember to include all this stuff within HEAD tags.

 Ok waj, I didn't get the Grrrrrrrrr part............. wajdi tired, wajdi needs sleep.......... hahaha! look about your problem, I tried and this worked perfectly: &lt;a href="" onMouseOver="document.pic1.src='image2.jpg' " onMouseOut="document.pic1.src='image1.gif'"&gt; &lt;img src="image1.gif" border=0 name="pic1"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; just change the names and copy and paste it, maybe it wasn't working because ur hasn't closed a tag or something but the above is perfectly right....... good luck, changing topic, shit guys next monday I gotta start school, man I haven't got any vacations at all, fuck, sorry about the swearing part but I am not happy about it at all!!!!!!!!!!!!

 Hi everyone It seems to me that everytime I ask a web related question Igar and Vlad just go at it. GRRRRRRRRRRRRRR...........peace, love, come on guys :) Alright ill stop now :) So how is everyone doing? Things are good? ALRIGHT!!!!!!!. ummm I was trying to make the navigator on the site look nicer so I tried some Java scripting. It worked for the first image, and then it did not work for the rest. I want to make an onmouse over and offmouse over event. I have the images made and everything, I have to decrease the size but that is not important. I just wanted to know why my script was not working. isnt it just = onMouseOut="document.pic1.src='NSERC.jpg'"> Why wont it work? btw, one more thing, What would be the code for on and off mouseover events for text, no images. Man I am tired. I think I am going to go home now. I am pretty tired. I need my sleep Good bye everyone Thanks

 Vlad........... hum what to say.........??? What do u mean by: "You behave like some misunderstood half-baked genius" those are heavy words, give them an exact meaning.... Yes u r right that I have a big hunger for recognition, and I do not consider this a defect, it just makes me work better, I'd like to be on the cover of "Time magazine" one day, wouldn't you??? There is something I don't get, about Waj's problem with the lins inside the page, havent you noticed that I had already wirtten the right answer??? I mean there is nothing more to that subject, is there? Funny note: Vlad your obsetion with those phalic symbols is getting pathetic Jak, Yak,.... Vlad u say u consider me a friend............ so treat me like one to keep up with your words, I feel that we are like Spok and the doctor from Star Treak, alwayz fighting.......

 Waj, I just took a glance at your work for the first time in a week or so. Gettin' much better! Congrats. But the pic on the front page is 233 kb for chrissake!!! That's way too much even for cable. Get your 'shop to work man! I also like your filenames: researche.html, pub.html, jak15.jpg. Jak (aka Yak) is a russian military aircraft manufacturer. Just a coincidence, but a funny one. Keep it up!

 ... urlLink time evolution of the laws of physics ... Is it just me or it smells biology here?

 yur dady sent the following comment... ------------------------------------------------------------ thou artless, bat-fowling pigeon-egg!! ------------------------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------------------- You suck......... Not funny Igar. Not funny at all. Yes, you're right, there's much more to web design. There should be something behind the code. I am not claiming anything on my part, but there should be some talent and a little decency. You behave like some misunderstood half-baked genius. Your thirst for recognition alone won't get you one. Relax. I know you think that I'm treating you with a fair amount of prejudice. That's right, but you should at least give me a credit for saying what I think. I only allow myself to do it when I'm with friends . I hope it will make you feel a little special.

 Hey Wajdi! I see you're still stuggling :o). You might have noticed the system you're trying to employ is hard at work on this site. It's most clearly seen on the urlLink front page . The "link" after each post takes you to a specific location within a blog archive file. Feel free to copy the source. I am proud to announce that, unlike this page, that one is written almost exclusively in notepad. (!)

 ok, waj here I go again, ;-) it seems that u only got half of the stuff rigth hehehe, look this is the way you do it: &lt;A HREF="#nameoflink"&gt;GO!&lt;/A&gt; more stuff stuff stuff stuff &lt;A NAME="nameoflink"&gt; more stuff more stuff more stuff notice the Name inside the down &lt;a&gt; ? and no, it is not a mistake you don't need an &lt;/a&gt; at the end. good luck

 hey guys. whats up? You know what? Some people can be really stupid sometimes. In a certain part of the page, in the publications section I decided to divide the publictions by year and each year would have its own link. The department said that they wanted to stay consistent and that the publications had to ALL stay on one page... YOU KNOW HOW BIG IT IS?????? if someone wanted to read it, they would not bother because of the length and they would have to scroll around looking for a specific publication. So now I have to remake that page and put the publications all on that one page. But now I want to put a page jump thingie. Like click on the link at the top and it will take you to that specific part of the page, but it will not work, dont I do it like this: things ? Ugh, im hungry, bye guys. and thanx

 Man, one last thing, your main page looks too much to the left and you are not using all the spase provided by the screen, you don't have to but it looks akward........... Vlad, why do you always have to critisize my critic reviews? ...........Whatever, do what(@#%@)ever you want........... but that won't change the TRUTH!!! that truth that is that there is much more to web design than just theory of colors are some tutorials of coding wrongly interpreted using all those tools, the genius comes from simplysity, it is an art a way of expretion that actually has standards of good taste to be followed.

 Fair enough Igar. The reason the friends page is so different is that I try to separate it form the rest as much as possible. It should look like it's an individual site. Let me kindly ignore the rest :o). Thanks!

 OK, V;ad I know almost exactly how u feel, every time I produse something I whant the whole world to c it.... but man, understand something, do not post up something that is or: not finished or not the final version or you aren't completely fallen in love with that particular design, othervise it gets anoying... and also the inconsistensy of colors from index to friends is quite anoying, guy, I am not attacing u just advising you... you like the images that is fine, you have choosen a stile.... I am really into the borthers u r using for your tables, but I do not like the general structure itself, is not as user friendly as u want it to be.... if you want another advise: why dont u create the blogger page desing or template as they call it and you use a javascript to write it in it, it works pretty nice in my homepage, take a look: urlLink www.ipasyst.com take a look to the scrolling news it is updated trough the blog but is writen by JS with something like this: &lt;document.write('&lt;Blogger&gt;&lt;BlogDateHeader&gt;'); document.write('&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;$BlogDateHeaderDate$&gt;&lt;/em&gt;'); document.write('&lt;br&gt;&lt;/BlogDateHeader&gt;'); document.write('&lt;em&gt;&lt;$BlogItemBody$&gt;&lt;br&gt;'); document.write('&lt;$BlogItemAuthor$&gt;'); document.write('&lt;br&gt;&lt;$BlogItemDateTime$&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;'); document.write('&lt;/Blogger&gt;');

 OK gyus, tell me what you think about the changes on he front page. Any sensible criticism is very welcome.

 well I read an article in a french magazine which said that scientists have used carbon dating and found that it is not as old as Jesus's time.In fact, dating the shroud indicates that it was a burial blanket but for someone in the middle ages, therefore, it could not be of Jesus. Some other proofs are that on it was marked Iesus Christus. And that is impossible in Jesus's time, because during his era, he was never called Christus. So all of science's tests have shown that it could not have been that old. But hey u know deep religious people, they'll believe anything and refuse to believe otherwise. So if they were to clone anybody out of if any cells present in the shroud, they would probably get a cobbler from the middle ages.

 Hey Faisal! Yeah, that's really hilarious. But do you think they could still find a DNA sample in the shroud after like 2000 years in open air (provided it's really what they think it is)? happy b-day Igar! so, do we call you "Sir" now? :o)

 also, guy yesterday was my 21st B-day, man I feel old........ and I think that makes me the oldest here, am I rigth, hope no!!! anywayz take care

 u r wellcome...... I checkd the site it looks much better now, a bit too simple 4 my taste, but u know that I like fancy... but seriously it seems that it does the job, a sort of advise would be to change the table borthers but that is up to you stuff like this people like it a lot: font-family:Arial; font-size:7pt; letter-spacing=1px"> also, if u want to include a search engine in the site I have a pretty good javascript that is extremely eazy to set up so if u want it just tell me.

 Hey guys, Cant make a long one this time, I have some work to do today, Igar thank you for the mail, appreciate it, Vlad thanks for the suggestion. Just wanted to say hello and ask how everyone is doing, I have to go, I have alot to do today, bye guys

 Waj, check ur email

 I see what you mean Wajdi. The site that looks as if it has frames is a non-frame site. It's background is a big gif with a sidebar. It makes it look like frames. As for the problem on your site, I think you just need to specify the background for the left frame's source file. Another thing is... try changing the font color on the Kozinski's page. The way it is now it's very hard to read. Try white or something... Getting together is great. Friday night would be fine with me. Pool? Movies? Anything.

 waj, i know that ur message was addressed to vlad, and vlad only, but sorry got to say that the html goodies has no frames, and for your porpoise of the shared background the www.f2s.com site is a better example the getting tpgether sounds cool

 hey guys, Thank you very much Vlad and Igar, I really appreciate it. Ummm, there is one slight problem though. urlLink The site has a slight problem in it, I wanted to know if there was anyway in fixing it. Vlad if you go to urlLink this site you will see how the site is set up, it is one whole bakcground and when you are browsing the site it looks like there are frames. I dont know if you understand what im getting at. Anyway, how is everyone doing? Alright check this out, do you guys want to meet up sometime, go out do stuff? sound good? You want to fix a day so we can all make it? All the amazing summer movies I have seen and no other good ones are going to be coming out after American Pie. AW well. Summer is almost over. It went by pretty quickly. Well sort of. Well off I go to another day in the lab and more web designing (ick!). Well goodbye everyone :)

 &lt;frameset cols="177,*" frameborder="NO" border="0" marginwidth=0 marginheight=0 &gt; &lt;frame marginwidth=0 marginheight=0 name="nav" scrolling="NO" noresize src="blah frame one.html blah"&gt; &lt;frame marginwidth=0 marginheight=0 name="mainFrame" src="blah frame two.html blah"&gt; &lt;/frameset&gt;

 Yes I think ur right vlad, we may think that what we are doing is helping society not knowing what damned consequences may arise. We are searching for the meaning of life and we continue on a path we think is right, I just hope im not around to find out the result. You know what they say, "The light at the end of the tunnel is the headlight of an oncoming train." P.s: hehe found something urlLink hilarious , while we're on the subject

 personally i think it is not the border but this the solution, but whatever pleases you: just change the numbers, and if u can not c anything then open the goddamed source ;-)

 Hey Waj, As I already told you, just specify "0" for the frame borders when defining the frameset. It will look like this: [FRAMESET cols="blah,blah" border="0" ] Replace [ ] brackets with when editing HTML. If you're doing it all in Dreamweaver, just set "0" for the frameborder in the properties inspector. Pretty interesting article there Faisal. If you want my opinion, I don't think there is something profoundly wrong with human cloning from scientific pt. of view. However, problems will surely arise. First of all - ethics. Mr. Danby-Smith will have to think about this one for quite a long time to come to a conclusion. There may also appear a new kind of discrimination: clones vs. non-clones. As well, the situation could become similar to that with abortions. Some fanatics might start shooting down doctors and scientists. That's just a short resume of a few potential negative aspects of human cloning that come to my mind. All that said, I can perfectly understand the scientist who doesn't give a fuck about right or wrong and just wants to do the darn thing, because it's just plain interesting. The last thing for today. As any new scientific/technological idea/invention, this one will NOT bring new problems. It will merely highlight the old ones. It was like this with nuclear energy; it is the same with cloning; it will always be the same with anything else to come. All the dark sides of our souls stay intact as we think we evolve to become a better society. Every new advancement acts as a catalyzer, brightening some bad stuff about us we try hard to eliminate.

 Hey waj, the best advise I can give u is to look at other sit's sources, this one might help: urlLink www.f2s.com enter the site and look at the source, it will really help u cuz basically that is what you need. good luck

 Hello hello, I have to make this to the point because I do not have much time. I really need anyones help on this. I am not good with frames and my prof wants them. Now I want to make it so that the border between the frames is not there so that I can have once whole background to make it look like there are no frames and I have no idea, tutorials are not helping me much on this. I would really appreciate it, if you guys can help me out on this. Because I really do not know how to do this and I need all the help I can get. Thank you very much for this. back to work now....bye bye

 .... Vlad, man u have a problem, I said "a" no u have many of them, look! the guy asked sincere critic for his site I gave it, but havent u realized that I havent asked for any critic on my critic? man I do not give a shit about what u think about my comments what bothers me is that ur prepotense is too big, and I think one day it is gonna outgrow u, and when that day comes, man u will feel and fall missarable, and beleive me I won't be there nieghter to laugh nor to cry for your missery.... about the site, it is not fanciness, but if there are norms of stetic that a majority agreed cuz of presentation and functionality then I think y not , but at the ent it is up to the webdesigner.... Fais, about the cloning thing, man I don't think that we r ready yet, we will be one day but not yet, we better still with sheeps and mice, man comes when perfection is acheived, and 227 tries to acheive a sheep it is quiet a rist to take with humans....

 Hiya guys, ive been lazy lately trying to cope with research and work, so i really didnt feel like blogging. First of I consider myself a geneticist but why then do i have doubts about cloning. Have you guys read urlLink this ?? I cant believe it, so thats it, i guess. The human race is doomed.

 ".- Kill the frames, or atleast make them fade into the backgdound using smaller text or images" That just makes me laugh. Hard. OK, Waj, the site is quite usable. I hope you understand you don't have to make it glitter in style sheets or stuff like that. It's a purely academic site for a very limited audience. One can pretty safely assume its potential visitors won't give a damn what it looks like, as long as they know where to click and the font is not too small. So far, so good. The only thing I would do is set "0" for frame border size. Cheers,

 by the way I knew how jerry etc. was, i didn't know y vlad used that stupid name, but now i know he just admires him too much and has some weird fantacies with him, but that is his privat life so we shoudn't talk about it ;-)

 Hi waj, yes I loved the movie, I also loved the yesterday's gay pride parade, it was awsome, sadly didn't get laid, heheheh u perverts!!! Waj, ok don'T get mad but the critic it unevitable: 1.- Kill the frames, or atleast make them fade into the backgdound using smaller text or images and make the horisontal bar gone by making the mcgill logo smaller and the auto scroll to off, cuz the huge bar there in the middle just spoils it all, but that is only if u plan to keep the frames, my best advise would be to make individual pages for each with the menu on side on each page, it is not hard just copy and paste and looks more proffesional. 2.-equipment & teaching give me 404 errors, maight be cuz the site is not done yet? 3.-profesor kazinski, what happened to the picture? it looks kinda weird... and the headings are too BIG 4.-http://www.minmet.mcgill.ca/people/janusz/researchi2.htm the image doesn't fit in a normal 800x 600 window 5.-the other pages with no bkground?? it might be nice but be consistent, or is cuz u r not done so do not pay attention to this comment. 6.-do not use too fancy backgrounds, they make the text be difficultly readble. 7.-if you cuold include some cascading style sheet would be really nice, not trying to show off but can take something from urlLink here good look and againg do not get mad at me, just trying to help, and being sincere ;-)

 Hey guys, Well I did not post up anything in a while. I went to the radiohead concert lastnight and all I could say is wow. The best show I have been to yet. Incredible. No one was jumping up and down going crazy and moshing or anything, we all just stood there dead in our tracks staring at Thome Yorke listening to his soothing voice while the synthesizers go on and the guitars played vintage radiohead melodies. Best time I had in a while. It was awesome, Thom Yorke actually played a request from the audiance it was incredible. They came back for three encores because we could not get enough of their music. It was well worth the 9 hour wait in line, I was right in front of the stage, only 2 people in front of me from the front bar. I see there is an ongoing conflict between Vlad and Russo, russo do you know who jerry springer is? well the way I know jerry springer, he is a cheesy talk show host who brings the biggest freaks in america like men who are women and vice versa and people who have affairs with people and kick the crap out of eachother on tv. and strippers and stuff. That is who Jerry Springer is. Now, Russo, do you FINALLY know who Jerry Spriner is? you want the site? here it is, but it is not even half done and ignore the main page it is not done yet so please restrain from criticizing the main page. as for everything else please go ahead, oh and a reminder my knowledge in html does not even come close to anyone on the blog. so please keep that in mind urlLink MinMet bye everyone btw, Russo did you like rush hour 2?

 I repeat "???"

 Yeh. Get real. Have U seen great movie with Jim Carrey (that one when his life is broadcasted 24 hours to the whole world)? Do u remember how this ended? BB

 nevermind

 ???

 Yeah, indeed. Let's all get real! Let us get a life aswell. A good life... with a big pool in a huge back yard. We will drive our reliable Buicks to Reno Depot to buy a new hot thing, a special device designed to catapult the freesbee to a maximum of 500 meters. Imagine, we will play with our hounds in our back yards, catapulting the freesbee to 500 meters... and it will still land in our backyards. Sweet... We will spend our mornings listening to the reliable news headlines graciously brought to us by Dagwoods Sandviches and optimistic weather forecasts brought to us by Jean Coutu (they've got it all, even a friend). We will spend our afternoons reading Globe and Mail while sipping Irish Cream at the Paris Cafe . We will watch CTV news at night. Lloyd Robertson will fill us with reassuring comfort of being connected to the world, of being on top of it all, of having made it so well in life...

 Vlad, or jerry, whatever, I c u had an identity crisis there, hehehe, look I don't hate u, come on do u actually think that u r so important to me, so I would spend time hating you? get real...... changing topic, guys any of you is up to c "Original Sin" this weekend?

 Ursso, you know, I think my sense of humor is OK. You may, or may not draw further conclusions from this. You've been telling me that I suck for the past year or so. I now think of it as a compliment. I mean, how weird would it be if you told me I'm a nice person? As long as you hate me, I'm fine :)). Jerry Springer... I don't know why I wrote it there. It was the first name that poped in my head. Boring as that. :)) Cheers,

 Vlad, first you suck, second, man u have the worst sence of humor that I've ever seen thind still not answered what is the jerry Springer thing with you?

 Russo, you definitely have a problem. I am not nearly as obsessed as you are with all this web stuff to do such a thing. There are three digits in the lower left corner of this page. It's a counter I put last week. Click there and look under "referrals". You'll see what I mean. Damn!! It takes so long to explain! The most recent google keywords: urlLink laptops in swordfish pictures and urlLink aeroflot posters

 What do u mean those r not ur comments? and also your traking system report, what a bullshit amn, come on! what u have a software that generates random words and searches all the engines to c if it will show ur site... hahahaha!!! and r u going to answer what does it mean the jerry springer name or not, or I do not deserve an answer I've been asking many times already and no answer yet, come on!!! on the other hand, Waj, what was the url of ur project, to give it a little critic ;-) and how much do u get paid? c ya, answers are compulsory!!!!!!!!!!!!!

 Hi Faisal. I was observing the issue with not much attention and from outside. Here's what Mcgill Tribune says about it. urlLink This is the response to urlLink this article. I have too little info to properly address the topic, but they say the reason for expulsion was not the rasist remarks, but simply a failure to register. Thus, they claim, the expelled individuals were not even considered Concordia students at the time of commiting the acts. Similar stuff happens regularly at McGill as well. Take the Student Society "execs", as they like to be called. They are lobbying the gouvernment of Quebec against differential tuition fees. They say that a higher tuition for out-of-province students is discriminative. Yeah right: $3,000 at McGill as opposed to $5,500 at any Ontario U. They want the same fees for all Canadians, but, apparenlty, they are leaving it up to Francois Legault to decide whether to reduce the fee for "them" or to raise it for "us". Guess which one he'll choose. What bothers me a lot is the Society President's comments on this. He says the Society's actions do not defend the common good of the majority of McGill students, BUT it is ethical to defend the rights of the minority of out-of-province students. Fuckin' nonsense. You were elected by the majority and are supposed to defend it's interests.

 Fais, Itought u were in Mc Gill, anywayz, man u r scaring me with all this shit, man next semester I am gonna probably go there, cuz Mc Gill does't exept students in my program in the winter semester, and then If I get stuck there and Such events occur again I will have to kill some of the people who are so stupid, man it is frustraiting, and the worst part is that u can not do anything about it, shit!!! y don't u start and anti-CSU, will be cool, and write apologizing letters, or somehting.......... take care, Igar

 I am starting to hate activitists. The couple hippie freaks that govern the CSU (Concordia Student union) are making it bad for the rest of the students. Especially the ambitious ones. Sometimes I think that student activitists do what they do, because they want justice for the rest of the people. The rest of the time, its because they're good at nothing else. Sometimes, they realize their mediocrity and want to piss off at others, or the '"establishment" as its called. This is what happened. At the beginning of the year, two arab students were expelled for writing and displaying remarks such as Long Live Palestien or such. I thouht it was pretty rough that they were expelled without any notice whatsoever. they werent even allowed to a trial or anything. They were just expelled and I found that outrageous. So the CSU set up protests and demanded they have a trial re-instated. Concordia establishment denied it. So the CSU then did something that enraged me. They sent letters to companies such as Bell and Nortel accusing them of associating with an anti-humanitarian establishment such as Concordia. Bell and Nortel backed up from the convention they were supposed to hold in Concordia to recruit graduating students. Not only that, they sent to 3 or 4 huge Accounting Firms that were very important for the commerce students. And the Accounting Firms backed off as well !!! What really pissed me off the most, was that they sent same letters to Merck Frost. Merck Frost!!! Its is the future employment stand for all Biochemists and so on! And Merck Frost backed off as well. I swear I really hate a specific number of people of the CSU. What beats my intelligence is that if the Concordia Student Union does think about the students , how could they do this to them? Fighting for 2 students and injuring for the rest of them does not whatsoever justify their actions! The only thing that changes the world is scientists, Activists and politicians are just phooey. Just my ramblin peace im out

 Fais, stop reading Nostradamus, is really afecting your normal behavior! hehehe, and close that dictionary, cuz if u didn't know u r studing bio, not Philology.......

 Hmm..Your interpretation or anyone else's for that matter is correct. However, here is one hint, "The answer is 42!"

 Well, I've never heard of the " unparalleled definition of reverse entropy " as such, and I can hardly conceive what our life would be like if the nature indeed followed it. Would that mean a reverse evolution (in the scope of our comprehedning of this abstract term)? Would that signify we're en route to the caves. Moreover, would that suggest we're on some " Hyperspatiale Express Route " with the definitive singularity as the ultimate destination? OK, really, I ain't gotta clu watta fuck ur talkin' about, FAis. Explain.

 What am i doing ? I'm "swimming with fourty-two thankful fish-eating dolphins on my Blue-Green planet thinking my digital watch is pretty neat and wondering what is a Hyperspatiale Express Route anyways?" "Life is paradoxically coincidental to the ironical tyranny applicable to the unparalleled definition of reverse entropy." Im not talking gibberish. Anybody know what i'm talking about ? Please blog back.

 A couple of somewhat disturbing recent search quieries leading people to this blog: "prety ladies+images" from Google and, oddly enough, " pervertion " from Lycos. Well, my dear perverted friends, we're getting quite prominent I must say!

 You know what they say about chicks: "the buns are tight, but the price is right!" No, actually, they say it about hot-dogs. There are very few girls in engineering (10% maybe), but their mostly pretty hot. Or, maybe any girl is hot for me now after spending my days with 200 nerdy males. :))

 Hi there.... OttawaU is a pretty easy school..or may be every school in Ontario are like that.... so far I haven't seen any new material at al....gets boring after a while.. Yea..but I'm kinda worried about all that military crap in US, that can affect our economy and if the prices are gonna up... btw, are there any decent looking chicks in eng. programs at mcgill..? I'm not even asking about Concordia, u lucky guy, Evgenii, end yeah, happy birthday to you once again. I'm sorry i could not visit you there guys. anyway, best of all to you ppl, good luck with midterms

 Well, I don't mean to be a show-off, but it seems I'm one of those few who are actually enjoying school. I guess it's going to change after I take a couple of those eighty-percent exams.

 Yeah. I heard Bushe's speach too. It sounded very general I find. Well, I'm sure he didn't have a choice to say anything else. So, hopefully it will all happen the way it's supposed to happen. Like you said Vlad, a war against terrorism, not religion. Do you guys think Canada will be affected in any way from all this? I hopee everithing will stay safe. Besides, don't worry Vlad, you'll catch up with the "crazy fuckin shet". Just get ready to drink some more the up-coming week-end. I have a question. Is it only me or you guys don't like school either? I mean, university just started, but I can't wait to finish it. I'm already thinking of the end of the semester (like Christmass, you know).

 Hey everyone. So, did you get it? EVERY WEAPON OF WAR. Other than that. I miss the science centre too. It's amazing, guys! They STUDY in the libraries here. Now, did it ever cross your mind that you could actually STUDY in the science centre? To me it always meant the humiliation of the holy slacking-off place. It's very different here though :(. Having spent one weekend drinking cost me a week of catching up with the stuff. I say, crazy fuckin shet. Yes, shet.

 About Nostradamus. I think what people say about him is quite true. I have red a book of what he wrote and he was very precisely describing what is happening now. Besides that, hi everyone. Man, has it been a long time I don't visit this site? How is everyone? Right now I'm sitting at Concordia library, reading a 100-page assignment for tomorrow, I look around and say to myself: "This is not at all like the Science Center". I have to say I kind of miss Vanier a little (don't kill me please). However, Concordia seems very nice also. I especially feel surrounded by lots of attractive objects which keep on walking around me (well, I'm sure arround everyone). Btw, Vlad and Andrei, thanks very much for the CD player, it's a really cool gift. So, that's about it for the little piece of information about me for today. I'll try to keep up posting as much as possible. Bye.

 I'm not sure about Nostradamus either. You are more likely to be right Faisal. Other than that, Autumn is about to encompass us with its yellowish charm of descending leaves in the foggy glittering of the setting sun. It is for this reason do you observe the changes on this page. I trust you will like it, ladies and gentlemen.

 Fort vrai, that piece of by Chopin is trully remarkable, however i love more his Nocturne in B Flat minor.I am not sure, but wasn't Nostradamus writings in French originally? I think so. I may be wrong. I 'll check back and tell you.

 Have you heard his Waltz in C-sharp minor - a marvelous piece. Yes, it's amazing what Nostradamus saw. The unfortunate thing is that we can't really use his writings to predict anything. We can only go back and compare what he wrote with what happened. And that gives rise to speculations. There could be numerous interpretations to what he originally wrote in Latin. This is not to say that I totally reject him.

 As I was mellowing down into Chopin, I came across the tomes of Nostradamus on the internet. In this time of world conflict, it is enlightening to see what an ancient skeptic prophet has said. And what I have discovered has shook my spine. Century 1, Quatrain 87 Earth-shaking fire from the center of the Earth. Will cause the towers around the New City to shake: Two great rocks for a long time will make war, And then Arethusa will color a new river red. Century 8, Quatrain 17 Those at ease will suddenly be cast down The world put into trouble by three brothers, The enemies will seize the marine city, Famine, fire, blood, plague, all evils doubled. Century 10, Quatrain 97 Triremes full of captives of all ages, Times good to bad, the sweet for the bitter: Prey to the Barbarians hasty they will be too soon, Greedy to see the feather of smoke wail in the wind Oh this world seems too conflicted. May the result be in favour of the living and the consequences be subtle to an instant. Humans are affectionate to doom and are soon to have an appointent. Our crooked thirst for death, I hope, will be quenched once and for all.

 hehe Olympics it's something so distant...I wish I'd ever qualify to go there and get the last place. Canada is not a fencing country whatsoever, and Ottawa is not a fencing city, really (Sadly enough, Montreal is, it's said to have strong fencing school, due to many fencing masters from France). Actually, there is a tournament in Montreal this fal, with many strong fencers, which I'll try to visit, but only as a visitor, I won't fence this year, so if you want to come and see some real fencing action, let me know. I think there won't be any charges for visitors, but I'm not too sure. Cya

 Wow! Roma! Congrats! I guess we'll hear about you in the news soon! I mean, you could make it to Athens in 2004, couldn't you? How's the competition there? I'm really glad for you, since it's what you like and can do well.

 yeah, "fencing class was ruined " that is a real tragedy............... some people lost family, other lost fencing class.....................

 Take a look at the homepage of my fencing club, ppl http://www.excaliburfencing.on.ca/

 yeah, conclusions.. well, my conclusion is that it's a very annoying event. my fencing class was ruined because i didn't have a partner to fence with, because everyone was glued to TV!, damnit. yeah, if I didn't mention it before, I'll fence for the U of O varsity team :) nite.

 No comments. No opinions. It would be very foolish to discuss it now. NO conclusions or accusations can be made at this point by ANYBODY, let alone us. Let us not look silly. What do WE know for fuck's sake?! It's sad. We're sorry. That's it.

 Andrei, thanx for your help, don't worry i'll contact u later for more help......... about the news.............. man,fucking shit, fucked up people, krazy bastards how do not undestand what humanity is all about

 Any body alive? on the blogger?

 latest news about the terrorist acts in USA. all the islamic organizations are denying the responsibility for the acts. Yet, JAPANESE Ren Army is claming to be responsible for everything in USA, saying that tthis is the revenge for the Heroshima and Nagasaki. And that they were preparing it for almost a century.

 Hello everybody. So what do you think about USA? I don't want to be politically incorect to anybody, but if I had the power to hang the people, who highjacked the planes and flew them into the twin towers, I'd do it in a matter of minutes. Moreover, all the terrorist organizations need to have either SOME brains and attack ONLY military related objects, or simply they all need to be electicuted. Anything else that I have to say, not really. I'm upset. One of the people I know was inside the one of the twin towers half an hour before the collaple making a report for the news. I hope he and his crew got out in time. foolish terrorist bastards.

 What's up Vanier Lounge publishers. Jessus!! What happened to Vladster.net? It seems to have vanished somewhere... There are even no links available to go to our lounge... Man. By the way, Igor. If you want to have good prizes for the tourney, you have to start a club. It seems like a lot of work, but it is not a big deal. You just have to type some stuff to start it and that's it. If you will have the club going, then you would be able to access the money from the VCSA and they are very supportive, I mean very supportive. Having a club will also allow you to ask for money from the student services. With the money you can organize some activities. And it is not hard to do that either. To organize anything in Vanier, first you have to commence to do activites for FUN. It means that you have to tell everybody (in the TLC, VSCA, SC) how fun such an activity is. Then you have to say that you are organizing because you want to have fun and you want to attract more people to chess so you (they) could make new friends and enjoy Vanier. Then you say that you just need some help to organize this activity, i.e. posters, space, equipment, etc, but NOT MONEY. All this stuff is needed to show to the administration that you are involved in organizing this activity because you LOVE chess and you want other people like you to love it and play it TOGETHER. Besides, you would have to be nice to everybody while talking about this activity and smile. PLUS, very important to have someone presenteble beside you who aslo LOVES chess and want to help and is willing to volonteer day and night (like Audrey or someone who is loved by the administration). Only after you do all these things you can actually start doing something to directly organize the activity: book a date, a place, have an approximate amount of people intending to participate. Only then you must talk about money for the prises. And NEVER MENTION THAT YOU OR ANY OF THE ORGANIZERES WILL GET ANY MONEY OUT OF THE ACTIVITY!! The money will come itself. To ask for money you need to type a letter of demand to TLC, VCSA and SC. You must have a chess club going to ask for money from VCSA or SC and they are always the major sponsors. So after you'll do all this stuff, you can ask me for the rest. PS Try to involve in organization Audrey, Olga the chess player, and somebody cute or charming who will do all the negotioations. Besides, Olga knows how all the tourneys work. Good luck. For everybody else, see you later!!

 Hey Jack. Isn't it a little too early to judge yet? PS: GO TO TEAM , CLICK YOUR NAME, MODIFY PROFILE AND ENTER A NICKNAME. ONLY YOUR NICKNAME WILL SHOW UP ON THIS PAGE.

 thanx Vlad......... who is this jacko eh?

 Well my dreams have crumbled A simple dream, the thought that one day I'll study something interesting and challenging Concordia killed my dream, being neither interesting or challenging.

 Well, then just go to TLC and talk to Judy about the date of the championship and the prize scheme. Then print some advertisement, put it everywhere a week before the event and let people sign up at TLC. At the day of the event make pairings according to the strength of the palyers. Make a separate card for each player, where you will mark their points. I think you know how it works after that: 1 for won, 0.5 for the draw, 0 for lost. Make sure there are people helping you. You won't make it yourself. Another thing, if you want to be in control of everything, you won't be able to participate. Find guys who are willing to help and not play. I think that will be it. Hope that helps.

 thanx vlad, but I do not wanna start any club, just to do the tournament and that is it....... I got no time for the club thingy....... so how do I procede?

 Hi Igar, first of all, to get money, the chess club must be officially registered at VCSA. To do that, you have to submit a paper with the list and signatures of all members, detailed list of the activities you're going to do (like field trip to NY :) and a budget proposal for each activity. This budget proposal needs to be approved by VCSA too. Then you go TLC and negociate about when and how it's going to happen. They are usually OK with that. Good luck!!!

 hey guys, me here back, good luck in the U life, gonna be there soon.............. hahahha Andrei or Vlad, I told andrei that I wanted to organizwe the chess championship at Vanier this semester, I already told the guys but how do I do the rest? what do I write and to whom to ask for the money$$$ please help me, ..................

 My latest update on my books. I will get one of them free, and even because of that, my bill for books is a definite 640 dollars. Bye bye beaver tails money. But hey i got scholarship money to be happy about . woohoo.

 Well... books are pretty expensive here too. I bought three books so far: Multivariable Calculus, Elementary Diff. Eqn's and Engineering Ethics. They all cost me a little less than $300. It's a good thing I am buying one book used and borrowing another one. Otherwise I would be facing something like $500. In any case, I'm not surprised; the prices are what I expected them to be. Ok, tomorrow's the first day (!) (a meaningful pause) (!). I dont' even know where my classes are. This is gonna be so much fun! Wait and see. Faisal, thnx for the feedback :).

 Hey guys. I had to change my plans because there were problems with my registration, and I had to register in person. Finally, I got my registration done, which wasn't a very pleasurable experience. I wasted like a day trying to get my courses and resolve time conflicts...then I had to waste three days...well, I played basketball with some guys, there is a playground not too far from my house, like right next to it. The prices are incredibly high in Ottawa for some reason, but it's not that bad. My room was like the best deal around. Not very close to campus tho. I'm just off my orientation day, and I'm so mixed up now. I was told many different things, I don't even know what to believe now. We had some alumni coming in and giving speeches, and they say that your GPA isn't that important, well, of course, it matters, but not that much. And for rankings, what I wanna say, is that I don't think it matters that much. It's all about selling yourself, at least it seems to be so. All these Gourman and McLeans rankings I've seen before, I'm pretty sure they are subjective. There is no such thing as objectivity in this world anyway. Now, what ranking does employer believe in ? This is a pretty complicated game, there are too many factors too consider. Hehehe, and sometimes you choose schools not because of rankings, like I did, I applied to UofO just because they still were accepting applications, and I didn't want to wait anymore. I don't even know if I will regret it or not, but seems to be pretty boring here in Ottawa....prices for books are like incredible, i mean, REALLY-REALLY HIGH, I'll have to spend like 300-400 bucks for books, dammnit. Anyway...cya Roman.

 Hi guys! Roman! I didn't even get a chance to say bye to you. I thought you said you would leave on Saturday. Anyway, best of luck to you man - you deserve it! Tell us some stuff about where you live, first impressions about the school etc... BTW, we were about to board a bus to Ottawa last night out of boredom :).

 No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm sure universities know the approximate percentage of people accepting their admission offers and give more offers than they have space for. As you see from the data, more than enough people apply, but fewer of them are qualified. As I have already said, a qualified applicant is likely to get more than 1 offer.

 wow wow vlad, r u telling me that every year medical schools start their year with a lot of empty seats because not enough people applied ? For crying out loud Vlad, please tell me it aint so.

 "Boogie Nights" = "His Powerful Device Makes Him Famous." Go urlLink there for more Chinese movie titles. It's hilarious.

 And a short up date, yeaaaaah they made it, four gold medals, the best overall nation so far. (Well, Italy will get gold in team competitions in foil, most likely, that can change things) I can't wait till I finally get my VHS with semi finals and finals.

 Cool. Russians got 3 golds and one bronze this year at World Championship. And hopefully they'l get one more before the championship ends. So, they must end up second or may be even first overall in the World! Man, sometimes I'm proud I am Russian.

 You know what, I'm goina go home. Fuck that class. Fuck the quizz. I'm goina go home and pack my stuff... And I'm goina drive it to Verdun tonight. Man, that blondie chick across the desk is driving me crazy... almost the same way the chick from our cal course is driving me insane. Andrei, you know that blonde hot girl we saw first in the computer lab. She has my favorite haircut and ever-smiling eyes. God she's gorgeous! Come on guys! This place needs a shake-up. Let's talk about chicks! Any suggestions, Mr. Lion Pimp? Cheers. Update: Oh my goodness, she gave me this longest look ever. She was walking all the way through the lab (about 30 meters) slowly turning her head and looking directly in my eyes! And I was looking directly in her eyes! Holly shitttt! Why am I writing this? Why am I not running to buy her flowers and ice-cream?!?

 hhmm!!! how is everybody doing?? i happen to have a BIG BIG BIG midterm tomorrow, so before sleeping make a little prayer for me guys, i really need this ONE.. the Lion King is out...

 Duh!! :)

 Oh, don't worry about the economy. It will be up'n'running by the time we graduate (provided we don't die of Anthrax :). Breaking news : I finally got around to get myself a cellphone. Yeah. I also bought new genuine Italian shoes, sweater and a jacket. Pretty cool shit. Government pays :). Today's a party at Shatner Bldng. But before that, there will be Blues Pub in the Eengineering Common Room. Besides engineers, education and NURSING students are invited. Now, nursing rocks. I think you all know why :).

 Damn, economy is goind down, markets aren't likely to rebound, etc-etc That just sucks. I broke two blades yesterday. That sucks too. And yeah, about the unis, you know, after I moved, I don't think that names matter. in Montreal everyone is hyper about McGill, here everyone is talking about carleton, uofo, etc Sounds like it only counts for graduate degrees, and as for undergraduate doesn't matter much where you got this stupid bachelor, what do you think on that Vlad ? Comparing qualities of program is a pretty hard thing to do. Lot of ppl say that ottawa is respectable, I find the program sux. so far I have learned zero knowledge. Hope they will start actually teaching me something next year or smth. What's that thing with TV ? RP.

 Did someone say Concordia is bad? If you did talk to me. I'll quickly make you change your mind. Got it? About TV. Soon I'll be on TV. Chanel Global. For precise information, I'll tell you later (don't know yet). Roma, good stuff man. later.

 I am happy for u guys and for all the human society!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! you, what the Fuck with the [banned word] thingy, man it is a quite good product of the russian langage and u take it off, man, let the people laugh at u as I do, ok? c ya just another thing, guys how bad a U, is concordia?

 Hi Roma! Hope to see you on Eurosport someday :)! Waterloo's admisson standards are not entirely due to the quality of education. It's because of it's accessibility for the US companies to hire grads. Qualitywise, the best Comp/Elect Eng. program in Canada is at UofT; second is McGill. And those are the only two Canadian institutions in this discipline that are seriously taken into consideration in the US and in the world. The situation might soon change, 'cause McGill's really getting ahead with new fascilities. All that is to say that the university reputation is only significant provided all other things are equal. Of course, a 3.9 CGPA at UofO will get you a better job than 2.5 at UofT. It depends on the personality and connections as well. It's been said and discussed way too many times, but I just wanted to emphasize it once again. Good luck everyone! Gotta go have some tea.... :))

 Ok, here is a short update. I live a perfect live too, but for some reason, there isn't any reason. There is no such thing as U of ontario. Ottawa is not very hard, but more expensive. it's not the best uni either. my reason for applying to ottawa were different from choosing the best school or the easiest school and the ones alike. I only applied to ottawa because it's not in Montreal, and I knew I'll get into what I wanted for sure. McGill is a better choice if you are willing to live in Montreal. Waterloo is the best, but I'm not sure it's recognized for bursaries from AFE, and it's next to impossible to get into engineering at UW. HAS ANYONE GOT EUROSPORT CHANNEL ??????? World championship in sabre and epee will be broadcasted live this saturday. www.eurosport.com, if you care. I got a friend of mine to record this event. There are must be some Russians in the finals too, at least in sabre Hopefully, Charikov will get gold. Chan is hard, but he isn't that bad. I managed to get 70-75 in his Linear Algb class.I think it's good enough in his class. Girls can blind you. Beware. Later.

 I'm impossible today, I know. I think I better keep off the computer :)

 Hey! I'm happy for you man. Be happy for me too! I have a quite similar reason to be happy. Although the whole thing is quite fucked up, I must admit. :) LOVE, PEACE, WORLD TRADE.

 I think Vlad stradaet [banned word] , it is ok, no hard feelings............. Vlad, can u just be happy for me, at least once? can u ? please? You Andrei, kato is happy, next wensday we have the chess tournament and since neighter u nor his brother is there he thinks he is gonna finally be the "CHAMPION" as he said................. hehehe..........

 Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks for asking. How about you? Good. How's school? Wow, great! Having your midterms? Terrible eh? Yeah, same here. Anyways, gotta go study. Yeah, see you around. Say hi to Blah. Take care. I will, thanks. Good luck.

 Vlad are you ok? Or did you have too much exams lately?!

 Yeah guys, whatever!!!!!!!!

 issue? what issue? I'm just havin' fun. so are (i hope) all the others. chill. and who the fuck are YOU to tell me what to write, fuckin' peacekeeper!? :) weird idea of fun, i know. nevertheless...

 Guys get real. You're like little kids. And let's not any concluding posts from any of you upon the issue.Aright?!

 Oh, sooo old and sooo fuckin' pathetic (your response that is). Read your comments from the summer. You never learn, but that's fine. You don't seem to recognize my glamourous humour either. There is a very good Russian proverb about you, but I won't tell it here to avoid further humilliation. Enjoy your perfect life, while you can. When you grow up, life won't seem like such anymore :) Say hi to Sasha.

 Vlad, kiddie, I didn't know that I was so close to ur heart so u get so influenced and so touched by my words, man that is the best compliment that I can get from you, I guess.........

 Hey you arrogant lil beatch. Are you implying anything there about popularity??? I guess you just put your sexey pic on Ms. Dedic's desktop, and she gave you the reference just so you please remove it. Oh "the road to humility", I have yet to experience what you have felt while we were at the Sci, poor kid :). The best tutor... hm... I've never had any illusions about Vanier standards, but that's a little over the edge I guess. As for my life, it's quite good as well. Especially recently :)). I AM MOVING IN TWO WEEKS BABY. GRRROOVEY!

 Wazzzzzzzzzzzzaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!! Hey guys did anybody miss me? Hell yes!!!!!! Guys I am the happiest MAN in the world, the factors that influence my happines are: 1.-My life is perfect 2.- I am so in love with Sasha!!!!!!!!!!!!! (She makes my life be perfect) 3.- Teachers Love me (I can tell that from the recomendation letters, they even refer to me as "the best coach" in the science center) and No, guys I didn't have to kiss any ass to get the popularity!!! 4.- I am doing web design for Vanier and finally I am getting paid, it is nothing big but still makes my day. 5.- I am so in love with Sasha!!!!!!!!!!!!! (She makes my life be perfect) What else? well I hope to pass Probability and Statistics, guys did any of u had the chance of taking any course with Mr Masao Chen? he is so horrible, God help me to pass this class, please if there is any hintswith this spesific teacher please yeal out!!! My english teacher says that I am stealing stuff and not writing it, fucking bitch, i wrote it, what a poor Ucranian- Nicaraguan Immigrant can not write amazing and astonishing words? fuck that! OK, Mucanda the Karismatic, how come I never saw u surrounded by any girl......... ok u must have your own reasons to hide them... hehehe....... Vlad You Rock as andrei said!!!!!!! congrats man I am very proud of u, u finally realised that u can not add numbers, and also were enlighted that u r not the smartest being around, good that is the first step in the long road towards humility, a road that I hope never experience the need to take....... Roma, better luck next time...... tell me something, how easy is the U of ontario? Andrei, I join with Zhenia to shoot you, just say when!!! by the way what program r u in? and u Salsero, what r u studing, and where? ok c ya guys later....... my mom is kiking me out of the computer.................

 Ok, guys. I went to Kingston. The tournament sucked. The machines were faulty, one reel failed when I was fencing, the judges were so shitty, I was about to get a black card. anyway, I didn't make it to semi-finals, I only managed to get into top 8. It's all good. I'll have my revenge on Nov 3-4 when we're gonna fence teams :) All my midterms are all in high 90-ies btw :P Till later.

 A town in North America... 11:00pm. Geoge: "Did you hear? Somebody is crying for help. Maybe we should take a look." Bob: "Nah, don't bother. We'll find out about it from the morning newspapers."

 Did somebody say Venus??

 Yeah, thanks, Mr. Charismatic. I have a question to you egg-head: what do you do when you desperately need friends all of the sudden? The lattitude, eh? What's lattitude anyway? No, seriously, I can explain, but that would mean I would have to dig up my Astrophysics notes, and I'm not quite sure where they are :). Secondly, it's not a CHART room, Mulanda. It's a very complicated and serious thing called "the blog". Good luck there on Venus! Breaking News: I got 95% in my Dynamics test!!! Yeah baby! Class average = 60. There are a couple of people who got 100% though. Why didn't I? Apparently, I don't know how to add and subtract numbers over 10. But the teacher says it's OK for U1 Engineering :).

 hey guys, how come everybody forgot me..i am still ALIVE, and better than ever. Bear with me guys, i am trying to get ready for my midterm next week. the course is Planets stars and galaxies..since all of u guys are enginneer freaks, maybe someone could tell me how to calculate a star's lattitude knowing it's right-ascension only..i hope there is someone who can answer that question in this chart room..and what are all these stories about gay clubing, i know not everybody in this chart room has the charisma that i have with the LADIES, but please guys if you need advices, just ask... i am calling a psychiatrist.

 Man, just tell me when. I'm so gonna shoot you (hehe). Just kidding. But what is true is that those fricking comp assignments take lots of time. Each one of mine takes a good 5-6 hrs. Imagine, I have ten of them during the semester, two of which are major projects with colours and sounds. Tabarnak, yo!!! later.

 hehe, man you guys Rock!! (and I hope you don't roll). Nonetheless, yesterday night I was doing my computer assignement for 6hours and 15min. NOT kidding. I started at 5:55pm and finished at 12:10pm, 'non-stop'. I was in McGill and almost missed the last metro home. Yet, I did it!!! I frik'n did it, and it's only 1.5 page long and it works!! Today, I have to do my mech-1 and cal-3 assign-s. Shoot me if it will take as much time.

 Hey Fais, how was the test? Aced it I guess?

 Clarification: we were singing Karaoke in a bar. OK, fine, it was a gay bar, but I swear we came with girls. There were a few straight people there.

 Vlad, you're fucked up again? I'm not sure if understand you corectly, but is there something to be fucked up about? Andrei, juicy stories are not always desirable. For instance, I don't think you're gonna like this one. During the gay bar singing, Vlad and I sang the following words together: "Love me tender, love me true. All my dreams fulfill. `Cause my darling, I love you, And I always will." So do you like this one or not? O.K. everyone it's a joke, I only sang WITH Vlad, not to Vlad.

 .....ahem.....

 Night before Genetics Midterm Ring around the rosies Pocket full of posies Hush-a! Hush-a! And we all fall down!!!! Applause Morning of Midterm ..............zzzz................. After Midterm Time for me to study

 INDEED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! HAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!! :) this is so amusing........Man!!!! :)

 Andrei, stop confusing people with your misguided interpretations of my words. I suggest that we refrain from further developing this conversation for the rest of the members not to feel left out. I'm fucked-up.

 Ji! Man! I think some people are missing the point of what to write about :) :) I mean I wasn't out with Vlad and Evgueni with some OTHER friends on Sunday... But what the f*ck were you guys doing there?? Signing in a gay bar?! And what happened after?! The only thing that I know that at 9:30 in the morning in calculus class Vlad was intriguing me with some stories about a sleep-over at Audrey's house of an equal amount of fairly drunk boys and girls... :) I coundn't believe my ears... Gosh, I hope this will not become a blog discussion, but I want some jucy expressions, especially coming from Audrey and Evgueni... hehe :) P.S. (oh my god) :)

 Oh yeah baby. Crazy is the word. I didn't sleep at all, but I got a nap in the library for about 2 hours. Security woke me up. I have about three gallons of coffee in me, and it makes my chin tremble. My differential eq'ns midterm is in two hours. NO MORE SUNDAY NIGHT GAY CLUB SINGING.

 I have to say something. I think I'm crazy. It is one of my busiest weeks in school, and I started it with an alnighter on Sunday. Last night, I slept exactly for seven and a half minuts. Right now, I'm sitting at Concordia and writting these stupidities, also thinking should I study or go home and get some sleep for Christ's sake. Now, will you tell me I'm normal? Crazy shit, guys. later. P.S. If anyone thinks he or she is crazy too, why don't you share your thoughts?

 all the authors of careless entries on you know which subject will be mercilessly punished according to the laws and equations of my present state of mind. If you don't know what I'm talking about, you're safe. thank you.

 If A equals success, then the formula is: A=X+Y+Z X is work. Y is play. Z is keeping your mouth shut. /Einstein/ I'd go for A = (Y+Y+Y)Y! /vladster/

 Enjoy the bandwidth young warrior. May you use the holy power of high speed for the good of the world.

 O.k. Russo congradulations. But guess what guys? YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH I have High speed edition now at home. I know it's not a big deal, but I'm still happy. later.

 I know a girl named Sacha who fence foil at Olympia Montreal.... Is that her..? Laters.

 Congrats on perfect life Russo! We are gonna miss all the love you use to give us man! "so sweet..." is not enough. Who's the girl?

 Hello guys...... man, I am so happy, my life is perfect!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the name of my happines is Sasha, (Aleksandra).......... yes guys, belive it or not I got a girlfriend, she is so sweet....... ok, mobody get jalouse, remember I got too much love to give......... ok, bye................

 Andrei,wake up, it's time. Btw, did you publich that article about chess? What was the reaction? Pause for a moment, hot chick passing by. O.k. , let's get back to writting. So, it's cool that you're getting back to chess. I just didn't know that you stopped. When did it happen? You know, it sucks that you''re joining the club. I mean, after being the president of one. And the worst part is that I won't be the activity director, someone so important in chess. o.k., I'll stop now. I am happy for you. Make sure you kick some ass at McGill. later.

 hello ladies and gentle-men :) Good luck Roman! I wish you to fense off all of the asses, I mean aces in Kingston. I actually might get back to playing chess, and maybe join a chess club in McGill (they actually have one!!) I just got this idea two minutes ago, because today someone asked me to organize a chess tournament for my department. Well, I just thought like sharing :). Now, I'm going to get a nap on the grass some where on the campus.

 O.k. I'm piced. My progamming teacher, whose name is Carlos Santana btw, took out 2.5 points from my assignment for almost nothing. Imagine no spaces between the lines. i think those fricking guitar players have nothing else to do in their lives, idiots. Pizdiets blia (for russian speakers only). Besides, what's up guys? I see you're complaining about mid-terms, well, luckily mine haven't started yet. In a week or two, I'll be crying n blogger. Roma, I hope you win the 13th, in Kingston. You know what they say: break a leg (I ment good luck). Enough for today. later.

 I love genomics. We are talking in Genetics class now about mutations that cause albinism and polyploids. Very interesting. Next thing, our study will be derivation on diseases in alleles. So now that I am sitting in the Concordia Webster Library waiting to start my study on Plant biology and cell respiration I can't help but ask why people would even want to take such a class. I have to take this class. It is pre-requisite for a next course. However, the latter half of the course will be on animals. Much better. Anyway better get back to oxidative phosphorylation. Piece of crap. Damnit, I hate plants!!!! and I hate cell respiration. That said, I hate the important things that permit me to live. Super. let me crawl back into the dark demented world of the plant..... im out peace

 You may see the same post twice. I think something wasn't working. So I posted it two times later.

 YO! If, by any chance, there is somebody in here who doesn't subscribe to the urlLink Next Draft , you still have time to be saved! Way to go Roma!

 I wanna know why did Andrei ask me first about how are we doing, and then "note: please, don't give compassionate comments. Just tell me about your sufferings, it will make me feel better." Am I supposed to suffer a lot or something..? :) Just to let you know, guys, I'm doing just fine, my midterms are not hard, and hopefully I did pretty well. Also, my first tournament is coming up, i'm going to Kingston on Oct 13 to fence in the Queen's Invitational tournament. Cya.

 Congrads Faisal! That's really nice that you got such a good grade. By the way guys did you know (not if you care of course) that the first helicopter-like device was dicribed by the Chinese in the fourth century A.D . in the book called "Pao Phu Tau" which means: "Tells of the Master" describing flying cars. Cool heh?!

 Yeah, I followed that one. It's all good but quite funny as well. It seems that the only people who give a flying f*ck about academic freedom are Art History students and alike. They don't care, 'cause nobody's going to hire them anyway.

 Well there is good news. The notion to kick out the companies such as Bell and Nortel was voted down at the General Assembly. So they stay! Alright,so far so good

 Oh, Faisal you suck. There's like five people in front of you on the list. Next time try harder.

 congrats Fais, way to go

 HEllo HEllo!!!! All my citizens!! Yes I am happy!!!! My head is so damn swollen out of all my pride!! LOL I should stop, but I got one of my midterm's back!!! Oh man I am good!!! Get this, my class result for the Bio results A+ , 1 person A, 4 people A-, 14 people B- to B+ , 35 people C- and under, .......................................102 people..... I got a A- and I am too damn proud!!! Oh ya!!!!! I am really am so sorry to use the blog to spill my gut, but i couldnt resist. Sorry it couldnt help, vlad or mulanda. I say" If Ignorance is bliss, then I'm in heaven!"

 hey guys,how are you all doing? Andrei what's up with you?you seem to be hiding in some kind of basement...I have not seen you in school,not even once..i guess you've got too much to handle...anyways i just had my first university midterm and i feel horrible about it..maybe i should have just gone to concordia...i can't get any kind of help here at Mcgill,it's horrible... see you later guys.

 I think for 1.a. you have to integrate... by parts... a few times.

 1.a is a ratio test = converging. I did 1&2, the power series..., well i missed the class today. And 1.i is interesting hmmm...

 I am suffering of my own humble stupidity. Is that OK enough for you? Schoolwise, my midterms are coming up, and I ain't got a clue what I'm supposed to know at this point. Andrei, that 1.a) thing is fuckin' killing me. Did you do it?

 hello people. Roma, I'm curious.... How are you doing?? And how are you all guys doing? (not to be impolite) I think, for instance, that just now, I did very bad in my mechanics exam. What about you? note: please, don't give compassionate comments. Just tell me about your sufferings, it will make me feel better.

 This is too funny to be missed. Recent search keywords: "hot nurse" and "phalic symbols". Hilarious.

 Wow, thanks Andrei! You actually took time to register and stuff :) kavkaz.org is a terrorist web-site . I visited it about a year ago and never went there again to avoid puking on the keyboard. See, they evoke nausea in me. Strange. I'm probably alergic or something.

 Coincidence or not? "Before the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, the Bush administration was on the verge of announcing a Middle East diplomatic initiative that would include United States support for the creation of a Palestinian state..." references: russian sites: http://www.lenta.ru/mideast/2001/10/02/ties/ english sites: http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/02/international/ middleeast/02MIDE.html to get on the New York times cite: Handle: vanier_lounge Password : 12345 Plus interesting info for russian speaing community on the similar issue: http://www.kavkaz.org/news/2001/09/27/news1.htm Check the four last paragraphs only, if you guys are too lazy to read it all. I didn't really look for an English version of that, maybe I'll do it after my midterms. cool stuff later

 Well, it's still a plan, and it's pending for Audrey's final approval. You're right, I will probably barely survive, but I still want to try it. All I've got is my student loan, a possible bursary and some savings from the summer. My parents are willing to help too. The place is in Verdun, so, it's not that expensive. So, I guess I won't die. But, as I said, I'm not totally certain about the whole thing yet. I'll let you guys know :).

 Hey Vlad, I c that finally ur dream of cutting the umbilical cord from ur beloved parents is come true, well, good luck.... me too I am diying to leave home but the finances do not really allaw me to do that, i mean if I do i will barelly survive and pay school, and food, I know is a price to pay, but isn't it a bit hard, unless u have gotten the loto, I think it is gonna be hard. If u can say more about ur foolprove plan I'll be glad to hear it, to reconsider my situation........ and if it is none of my bussines just say so......... ok good luck again, Igar

 Actually, I don't know about Vermont. In any case, it will be far more expensive than just to go to St. Sauveur or anywhere else up there in the north. And, since the cost is a primary consideration for me now, I'm out.

 1. For the past 300 years or so there was only one queen under whose "controll" Canada is. That is the queen of England. Since when does Canada has a queen? Or did the queen of England change tittles to Queen of Canada. 2. Vermont sounds very good. I wanna go, but everyone has to go, because we planned to spend the new years together. Oh, did I get it wrong? Are you going just in december or for the hollidays? 3. Doing something really cool is also a good idea. I mean after biking to Ottawa we will certainly handle skiing there. But more seriously, Roma if you're not coming to Montreal, we could come visityou in Ottawa, by bus you know or by car. Who's for it? Post your oinion. 4. For the chalet, I'm gonna call Dasha today. Promise. That's about it for now

 Yeah, post the prices. Hey Roma, are you coming to Montreal for Xmas brake? Let us know man. Secondly, we have to do something all together after the finals. I don't mean just getting drunk. We have to do something cool. Like... I don't know... skiing to Ottawa maybe? Salsa man, did you talk to Dasha about the chalet?

 Queen of Canada???

 By the way, anybody is interested to go to vermont to ski this december??? I'm going, Annie as well. And we are inviting everybody to join in!! I'll post the prices within a few day from now. That's pretty much it, Take care,

 Alright. Today I became a Canadian Citizen... Hmmm.... Does it have to be have some special meaning for me or something?? Do I have to feel different now from what I felt before? Well, I did immigrate to Canada. I left my country to live here, and to be a part of the society. But am I really part of it or am I just full of shit?? :) There are the questions that I posed myself while coming from the exam and while sitting in my Intro to Mech class. I don't know if I'm a pure Russian anymore like I always wanted to be. (not because I got my Canadian passport, but because ir's been a while that I haven't lived in Russia and the people there do not accept me as 'fully' Russian) Hmmm... Well I guess I'm a Russian immigran to Canada, who sweared to the queen of Canada that he will be loyal to her majesty for all his life. Yeah, whatever.

 Yeah. I went to Toronto for the varsity practise tournament, and you know, I had to fence foil that I have never even tried before..hehe, won 9 out of my 10 bouts. pretty cool, eh. very soon our coach told as that the points will be awarded for participation and not for how well we do, so we suddenly decided to get it done as soon as we can, and we quickly flunked out of the tournament, and went drinking and seeing what this stupid toronto is all about. you know, Toronto sucks. that stupid CN tower is nothing exicting to see...streets are like a big pile of dirt and pukes. And nobody fucking wants to take INTERAC. took me like an hour to finally find an ATM. Geez....

 By the way, people. Did you know that............... ASTERE has a new boyfriend, and that he is CHINESE?? Can you believe that?? I can't. I mean I have nothing against Chinese people, but ASTERE!!! With her attitude and her world views!!! Man, that girl has some inter-overlaping-weather-dependent-encyclopedia-wide state of spirt! (wow is that an adjective that I used?) well, maybe I'm just being no fair to her. She is a nice person (just in case she reads this)

 Just as the final conclusion of the recent events that hapenned in this interesting location. Apperently ducks turned out to be dragons or God knows what happened. Moreover, sam pipal found out zey dont nou hau to rait inglish. Vell, its okey. Also, modern teachers try to impress their students with some unexisting words. Guys, why dos it all happen when I have to leave this place for some time? Come on it's fun to see action like that on blogger. At least we get news about each other. As to myself, I think my teachers speak to each oter outside of class. Each one of them gave us work on the same week and retty much on the same day. Now I'm just enjoying my Saturday. Anyways, keep up those posts people. Btw, how about a little get together afer the finals? later.

 hey mu! i didn't see your post! it's too small! make it bigger, and by the way, when you type stuff, press 'post&publish' instead of just 'post'. :) take care

 you guys are lucky good stuff

 It feels so hot around here

 Nope. :) I didnt even have my bag open !

 Hey Igar, you will surely like this: http://members.tripod.com/~Raincloud771/poetry/cohen/spekpoet.htm

 Oh God, their after me!!! Can you hear the voices? They're attacking me. Yesterday they attacked my music, today they're attacking the way I see things. What's next? My haircut? God, I can't handle this!!! I AM NOT PARANOID. I vant tu no y thei r tryin to kil mi. Pleese halp!!!

 You andrei, what the f@##@#$ with the Hyena thing......... can't u just realize that i was on ur side? man, if i don't use pompous words in my arguments, it is because i do not neer to decorate my ideas, if u can read them!!! and since i only like the basis of things, i do not c the y r u attaching me.......

 and vlady, u can not surf from inside the metro, hooo come on future elec. eng..........

 it seems that Vlad is gonna loose his virginity with some Samba dansing females....... interesting..........

 I know exactly what you mean, Faisal. Some people just don't seem to get it. They think it's all about integrals and circuits. They think learning is about taking notes and drilling. They live their lives outside the classroom the same way, concentrating on getting the routine perfect and missing out on the stuff that matters. Making that conection with the prof is important. It pisses the hell out of the rest of the crowd, but who cares? The most ridiculous thing to be desired is to be liked by everyone. By the way, you did copy it down, didn't you? :)

 Have you ever been in a class, where the teacher is talking about something absolutely fascinating and you are actually smiling, but you then look around the class and you start frowning !!! Because the bunch of people around you are actually secretaries copying down what he's saying, instead of actually listening to what he's saying and giving into the amazement of the subject matter!!!!!!! You feel like grabbing by the collar, and then screaming, hey Mrs. Nesbit ! copy it later! Listen to what he's saying!!!! Geez , he just mentioned the coolest thing, and people didnt even pay attention. Beause if they would , they would say "ah!!" and start asking questions. Instead most of them were so fucking occupied writing and maintaining their handwriting, that they lifted an eyebrow, when I asked a question about what the teacher was talking about. I was saying in my head" Bunch of fucking morons, you would know what I'm talking about, if you were listening to what he was saying!!!" What really got me ticked off was as the teacher was taking the slide containing the very exciting subject away, a girl raising her hand, a flourescent pink pen in her fingers, and asked if the teacher could put back the slide!!! At that time, I was testing my Physics. If I threw my book with enough velocity , would it reach her head? However, this same teacher got his way today. Somehow he read my mind! As soon as he entered the class, he went upto the board, much to the expectation of the prepared secretaries, and jotted down " infundilibulirum " As the secretaries finished recoping it down, only couple of friends and I deciphered the hidden smile of the teacher, as he realized that a lot had fell for it. I wont call it sucking up, but there was a glance when he passed his eyes around the class and for a split second, paused at mine, fabricated somewhat of a restrained laughter, and continued to look around the class.That teacher kicks ass.He had his way of fun. By the way, infundilibulirum means .... well...........it means whatever you want it to mean.............in other words...nothing. My two cents 00 peace im out

 good

 First of all, I never called myself a duck. :)) Check the text more carfully, "we" was never defined!! Moreover, nothing ever was taken personnaly, it was fun. If you find this "boring", then I don't know what kind of sense of humor baby-dragons have (well, maybe they are still developping a sense of humor, but that's another topic for a research :)). Nonetheless, I never thought that someone can accuse me of plagerizing or copying someone's style! That's a first one. Yet, that's an easy way out that you chose. You are accusing me with no proof, basing your evidence on the fact that I discussed upon mostly dragons. Quite poor, not to say more. To add, the expression "lame duck" used was not reffering to ducks directly (even you said it). I made the lame ducks 'real' ducks!! And I brought the pets and other creatures to this blog. So... sorry dude :) And smile :) P.S. I'm not competeting with anyone's "wordy diarrhea". I'm just having fun. :)) Mr.

 All I said was that ducks were smart. I didn't call *you* a duck. It's all your imagination. Ducks are ducks. Turkeys are turkeys. Lame ducks are a different concept. You got all personal. I'll take it as a compliment and end it there. Secondly, don't fuckin' try to imitate me. Be original for once in your life. Domestic animals is my thing. Get yourself your own topic. Like... worms or something. Don't elaborate on my style. You sound disgusting. In any case, this all is getting pretty boring. None of you will ever beat me in this wordy diarrhea race (I hope you've realized it by now). Get over it. Gotta go do cal. See y'all. P.S. I wonder if the spider reads this. Let's check it out... oh yes! Baby-dragon is live!

 Hey Roma, how's life? :) :)

 man, how come you became so talkative..? can't believe it. aren't you supposed to study, u lazy asses?

 Watch out of whom you are calling turkeys, fire-burper!!!!! By the way, did you know that chickens grow to be cocks?! But that's not the point, since you've decided to be a baby-dragon. So the new research in psicology in relation with bodily fonctions that we are involved in, implies, that since adult dragons burp fire, therefore, when they were still babies, they had to undergo a prosses of learning of doing that. In the lab, we have performed various experiments on the topic of what would be the most efficient way of learning of flying and burping fire for a baby dragon. And sinse efficiency is the most important factor for the dragons, we have observed that first they learn how to fart fire. It gives them the ability to have fire powered flights, at the same time as experimenting with the internal combustion of hyena-based food products. After gaining a suffitient control of the so called "natural fire engine", they develop heat-resistant skin around their bodies which usually results in greenish color (yet sometimes it's pink, but then they don't fly and are relatively close to ducks behind the fence, yet on a lower evolutionary step :)). Then, gaining experience, the baby-dragons learn to fly without their inretnal combustion engines (because it doesn't look respectable flying like that, and moreover it doesn't smell well at all!!), and they reverse their fire extracting prosses from fire-farting to fire-burping, which in THEIR opinion is looks and smells much better (of course unless they are pink dragons). Well, that's pretty much it for our research, because other amazing facts about "psicology in relation with bodily fonctions of baby-dragons and other pets" still need testing. But there will be other posting if the audience is interested. (If there is any audience at all) Thank you for your time, Sincerely yours, Dr.

 I always said ducks were smart birds. It just so happens that their wings get cut short at puberty. They never get to fly over the fence and "get into the position" of freeing their mind that way. So, our poor ducks go out and invent their own artificial freedom (they call it AF). At this stage, they are smart and persuasive enough to make some other domestic birds believe them. It's a great puzzle to us scientists as per why they mainly concentrate on young turkeys. The preliminary analysis of observational satellite data shows that the reason might lie in the ducks' eternal confusion about rabbits and pigs. They just don't seem to understand why the pigs' 8-minute orgasms have nothing to do with the rabbits' population growth. Chicken? I'm a Dragon, baby! Well, a baby-dragon at least.

 "patetique, patetique, patetique" What else can I say?! _________________________________________________________ Diarrhea: n. Excessive and frequent evacuation of watery feces, usually indicating gastrointestinal distress or disorder. __________________________________________________________ Say YO!! Who's a duck?! You are a chicken!! And Igar is Hyena!! "Liberte! Egalite! Fraternite!" I can't believe you actully answered the kid. Like a pianist, and the keyboard are the kyes!! Amusing. Unfortunately none of you is in the position to "free your mind" (well, in Igar's case it's to get a mind). Nonetheless, I don't see any postings of other members of this blog... Hmmm... Come on guys! Join up!! "ONE DEATH IS A TRAGITY, A MILLION IS A STATISTIC!!" face it! "No passaran!!"

 Kicked my ass? You know, some people never learn. Grow up, kid. Just because I didn't go on rambling about something pointless doesn't mean I lost in the *discussion*. In case you didn't know, a purposeful discussion is the one with a subject and a potential useful outcome for debating parties. Both factors were missing in Andrei's arguments, which made him a lame duck from the beginning. Putting him down was like hitting a child, I'm sorry. Anyway, I don't think I need to defend myself here :) Next time you're desperate to argue, write something at least marginally exciting please. To the spectators: the *discussion* starts at the bottom of November 21. Have fun. I don't have neither desktop nor laptop right now. The desktop stayed at my parents' place. I am probably going to buy one for the next semester. I think (and that's my personal opinion) that to buy a laptop is not very reasonable. First of all, you pay much more for the same parameters. We have all the facilities at school, and, to tell the truth, I didn't even need a computer at home this semester. So, unless you just want to be super cool and do your stuff in the metro on the way home, go for a good desktop if you don't have one already. By the way, does anybody want snowflakes on this page. Would it make you happier? You know, being happy is important ;)

 Someone kicked Vlad's tall ass in a discution, and made him shut his arrogant mouth for a sec.......... "interesting never happening before event" Nice Andriusha, very nice............ Vlad, how much u paid 4 ur laptop, u have one right?

 By the way, check out my computer's problem: ______________________________________________________ 1) The spring is not ideal and its force may be a non-linear function of position, here perhaps k*(Y+eta*Y^3). 2) The spring could be hung down from an above surface, adding gravity (Mg) 3) The fluid around the mass will also offer some resistance based on its viscosity and the velocity of the mass such as some coefficient "mu" times the velocity squared. To keep sign information which is important for the direction of the viscosity force we take the absolute value of one of the velocities in the square. Equating the sum of forces to the sum of the spring, viscous and gravitational forces we then obtain the following system. F=m*a= -k*(Y+n*Y^3)-mu*V*|V|-m*g So a+[k*(Y+n*Y^3)]/m+[mu*V|V|]/m+g=0 With a=second derivative of Y V=derivative of Y Plug it into the equation above and solve it for Y. Note of the TA: "This is a very ugly differential equation indeed. If you know the solution offhand please tell us how, you obviously deserve some sort of prize (go for Nobel). It is sufficiently ugly that I'm not entirely sure Maple can even solve it." (the needed constants are given) ____________________________________________________

 hehe, nevermind. you know that you lost this one. better luck next time..."son" :)

 Diarrhea di-ar-rhe-a also di-ar-rhoe-a n. Excessive and frequent evacuation of watery feces, usually indicating gastrointestinal distress or disorder. Keep in mind, son: when you want to prove something to the people, first prove it to yourself. Otherwise, you get sidetracked and sound incoherent at best. Big words do not compensate for the lack of point (well, unless you're a politician of course). I'm out.

 "fascist crap"? irrelevant. "ironic play of words" and "fucked-up leader" is just an excuse for any 'normal person' to skip over the mental pathology that he/she has without having to face the challenge of accepting something 'amoral' which my distinguish him/her self from the pattern of 'normal, resonable, open-minded' human being. It's a self defence reflex that anyone has. The reflex is to reject anything that might cause any substantial change in the stabilized mental consciousness of the person.

 Well, I wouldn't go so far as saying the phrase is **true**. It provides with some insight into the mental pathology of some fucked-up leader, but is absolutely sensless to a normal person. I certainly hope so at the very least. I also disagree about this phrase being *universal*. Anybody in their right mind understands that it's nothing more than an ironic play of words that makes you wonder for a second or two. In other words, cut the fascist crap.

 The most universal phase ever pronounced: "ONE DEATH IS A TRAGITY, A MILLION IS A STATISTIC" I can repeat this a million times and it still true. Fuck.

 Btw, is any body good in QBasic programming? I have a midtem on Thursday, but I don't get a f....ing thing. Respond if can help please. later

 Snow flakes? Interesting.

 hey, today was pretty ordinary day, except that it SNOWED!!!! by the way Mulanda, call me, we need to set up a meeting with all the team, or tell me when you have free time this week. later

 Hey guys! I am in LOVE with MAC OS. She is sooo sexy. I stood there in the computer store playing with her for like half an hour or so, non-stop, until the sales guys started to get sort of nervous. Too bad I won't ever ask her out of the store simply because I will most likely be forced to buy her licensed software. That's why I'm staying with the sure thing: the un-sexy, but ever-low-maintenance daughter of Bill The Mighty Gates of Hell. Seriously, I have NEVER bought any software in my life. Anyone know what it feels like?

 Wazup, guys.... you, any one of u know for how much is a good second hand laptop?

 Yeah, yeah... I actually did appologize something like half an hour ago. Meaning that I said: "Sorry for what I said in class" She said that it's all good and she "doesn't think about that so I shouldn't either". Fair well. By the way, people, today is going to be my "first night out", sort of. Good night.

 Well, you better have a bad day. Calling the girl a whore. "Five minutes later I realized..." I'm glad you did at all... Better appologize on your knees. The fact that you feel bad doesn't make the world around you reverse its spin.

 What's up guys, I'm in a bad mood, and I'm intending to share it with you. First of all, I was very tired this morning because I didn't have a lot of sleep, but who cares. Then I have some stuff to think about which doesn't make me happy (which is the cause of my being moody that I don't want to reveil here). And at last, I was sitting and talking with a good friend of mine, Patricia, a blond basketball player with an exposive attitude. So she said something, I misheard it and called her "A Fucking Whore" very loudly. Everybody in the class turned and looked at her and me.... She got very red and said: "Fuck you!!! Don't ever call me that!" I said: "Oh, sorry", and continued on coping off the board. Five minutes later I realized that I insalted her. She wasn't saying athything, still looking like a tomato. So I said that I don't want to continue the conversation we had and changed the subject. We continued on talking in a normal manner. However, I still feet bad for imbarassing her in front of the entire class. Dang! I think I'm going to have a bad day

 I'm all for it! By the way, how about getting Dasha in here to blog? I sense the wave of sarcasm coming up. :))

 Yeah, I spoke to Dasha, she said that it would be cool to organize a party at her country place, and that she was thinking about it her self (can you imagine her thinking??). Anyway, she is still waiting for her parents decition if she can use it or not, however, I think that we should already make up the lists, and also look for some place for rent. By the way, anybody wants to go to Rhode Island on dec26 to dec29? I'm most likely going. take care

 New Year? Talking about it, Andrei, what's up with the whole thing? Did you speak to Dasha again about it? We really have to do something this year. I'm waiting for news.

 Hi, Vlad. Heh. I might come over to celebrate the new year with you guys and stuff, if you still tihnking of getting somewhere out of the city to a chalet or something like, dunno. Just let me know if you are thinking of celebrating the new year all together. The sign with "please ignore the moron picketeers" is cool too :)

 I agree about boredom. Thank goodness it's Friday. This weekend looks somewhat promising in terms of having a little fun. Updates on Monday :) Cool nick, Roma. Coming to Montreal any time soon? Check urlLink this out. More.

 Bored, who is bored.......... man now i am everything but bored, with this lack of sleep, and an ansiety to thet out of this college, man no time for boredom, and less with masao chen, man i hate this guy, the other day i learned how to say "teacher, I do not understand" in chinesse, sound funny, something like" lao chie, wo bo ming baai" hehehe, .......... ok nevermind, gotta sleep a bit, c ya somewhen....... bye

 Boredom? I think that at the end of the semester, one cannot be possibly bored. What do you guys think?

 Argh. Things get boring after a while. What do you guys do to shake off this damned boredom..?

 Fais, thanks for the link, but those are not really cracks. They just buy the corporate keys to the software. What we're interested in are actual bugs modifying the program to go around or generate the pass code.

 hey Andreii, i will not be able to make it for today, something came up;i will call u tonight so we can fix another date for ur meeting...

 By the way, IS ANYBODY LOOKING FOR KITTENS??? I HAVE FOUR TO GIVE AWAY. THEY ARE REALLY CUTE, KNOW HOW TO EAT FROM A PLATE AND DON'T PISS AROUND THE HOUSE. What else do you guys need to have a perfect pet? later,

 hey, Mulanda, if you can make tomorrow at 4:00pm at Burnside bld. on first floor, call or e-mail me. We'll have a meeting about the pan-ams. Take care

 hehe vlad check this : urlLink http://www.hindustantimes.com/neweconomy/news1211a.shtml hope you win your bet

 I see a lot of action going on here. Cool.

 What's up everybody... If any one of you came to McGill engineering buildings today, and wondrered why are there so many people walking with faces as if someone died. Well, they are mech-eng students who have experienced what it means, to have an 84 average for the first mid-term, when the usual rate of failures for the course Mechanics-1 is 40%, which didsn't seem to be the case. Therefor, as the teacher said before the mid-term today: " The second mid-term will be somewhat harder, since we do need to bring the average to the grade like we had years before". Result: spitting the disgust of desperation of all the students, since the 84% average we had will inevitably drop to the "usual average" that this stupid faculty had for years before. Oh well.

 Way to go TyGoN ! Yeah, you probably read what I wrote about my dynamics teacher. She mostly teaches Civil Eng. and sucks ass big time. That being true, I can't complain about my other teachers. So far, they've been top-notch (compared to the tripple-B at least :). Hey Igar . Long time no see. Answer #1: The "Unaited States" thing is a script that is supposed to determine the country according to your IP. As I now see, it mistakingly treats some Canadian IP's like they are American. Oh well, nothing's perfect. Answer #2: You're probably missing my point in that post about BSB, NSYNC etc. I am not attacking them. I'm just making a short-handed comment about the society. I don't care what music one listens to, really. There are other, more reliable, ways to look at people. Yes, Roma . You suck. :) What's up with that? Eh? Let us know when your next tournament is. We'll come and stab all your opponents in the face if you're unable to do so. See y'all.

 Well , well. It is the war of the T.A's. I cantbelieve what you guys are saying. Your TA complained to the Dean??? What a double-assholed coward! Tutorials are for solving and asking questions! My guess is the TA sucks and doesnt know the answers to the questions you're asking and is missing the nuts to tell you that he doesnt know. You see, he's got fucking dignity to take care of. Somehow showing that he is flawed somewhere proves his imperfection and bleeds his dignity. What a moron. Heard about the teachers too. Must be the same problem. Anyway I'm having a blast with my TA's. We went for beers last week. Anywayz peace Im out

 You know. I suck. I lost in the match for bronze. and the tournament was such an easy one... shit..

 and Vlady, what the....... is the "Hey there in United States. How are we doing?" thing? who is supposed to answer this question?

 Youi Vlad, u know, actually i like bsb, britney drives me nuts and ncynk are not bad also, they are a bunch of talented ppl who r succeding in the field they were determinded to do, so y r u attacing them.........

 fuck the TA who is a carless moron becuse he writes down problems in the solution's sheets with mistakes (yet he copies them from the book), then makes a mistake in his math and after geting a wrong answer he changes it on the next line to the answer from the book. Such an asshole. Moreover he complained to the dean last week that we are a bad class with no respect and that measures have to be taken, such that tutorials should be only problem soving sessions without any quetions asked!

 It's 7:59pm on Sartuday night. I'm in the computer lab at McGill, planning to go to the library to study. I have a huge headache. And I really don't feel like being here, or being anywhere and having my fuck'n mid term on monday. Man, is it worth killing so many nerve cells for such a thing?

 Clarity...

 urlLink A few things of interest to the biochem-maniacs here.

 See, that's the thing about physics. It was invented for arrogant lazy-asses like me. Makes chicks think I'm freakin' smart while I just keep pluggin' the digitz. Know what I mean?

 Sweet! (just dreaming). See the difference?

 Good stuff Igor. By the way, Three hours of doing Dynamics, and I actually found it fun... There are two possible explanations for my enjoying of mech problems. 1st: I liked it because I was able to insert values into the formulas and get the answers, which made me think that I'm smart. 2nd: I liked it because I'm psicologically unhealthy and I need a break. Good night

 Hey guys I am still alive having lots a troubles with prob & stats, fucking masao chen!!!!!!! can u beleive it is even harder than cal III? fuck this, anywayz i am happy with my girl and everything is pretty good, it might been better if the english theacher (another bitch) would not have caought me pligirizing a sentence in the damed essay, but anywayz i think i will survive......... so ZAGOMBEmaniacs, c ya hopefully soon in the U.

 hey Faisal, the only interesting science class i can think of, is my physiology class; right now we are talking about sensory neurons.. the lectures are only one hour long and there are about 150-250 people taking the course..the schedule for the course is monday, wednesday &friday from 1030-1130.

 Well, life in Verdun is... special. It's very quiet and boring. There are no bars, and EVERYTHING is closed after 9 PM. It quite safe, despite the general misconception. The good thing is that it's only 25 mins from school by bus or 20 mins by metro. Could be even faster if I were in Concordia. I have quite a big room with my bed, desk and a sofa (a great socializing tool, by the way) in it. I like it.

 Sup everybody, World Chess Championships Under-18 Boys 1st-RUSSIA, 2nd-RUSSIA !!!! 3rd-GEORGIA, 4th-Ukraine Under-16 Boys 1st-GEO, 2nd-UKR, 3rd-RUS Under-14 Boys 1st-HUN, 2nd-GEO, 3rd-HUN Under-12 Boys 1st-UKR, 2nd-RUS, 3rd-FRA

 what's Lion Pimp ? how's life Vlad ? I guess you already moved to Verdun, eh ? How things are, where in Verdun u live, etc-etc? (Our team kicked major ass at Royal Military College)

 HAHA! ZAGOMBE!! I remember that!!! Anyway, Mulanda tell me of an intersting large science class. and tel me its timing. Ill try to see what i can fit in. ill get to meet the crew.

 Hey Faisal, make sure you let us know when you come here! Call my cell or something (it's in the "Team"). Now, Mr. Zagombe, relax. Get all your ladies together and retire to a sauna for a couple of days. That'll put you back in shape!

 hey guys, the King is in da house.. iam having the worst opening semester one could ever expect, i think i should consider returning to the jungle... Faisal, i have no genetics class this semester, genetics courses are only offered during the winter ,at Mcgill..we do however take biology and physiology courses this semester, and u are most welcome to come and sit among us, no ids neccessary... As for "Depeche Moderator", don't u ever call me "Lion Pimp" again, severe consequences might result..and Andrei, i hear there is something cracking!!! i tried to reach u on your cell over the weekend, but instead i got this chick who told me i had a wrong number..don't do that to me again, itching consequences might result... Alright guys, now that i am depressed, i need a vacation, any suggestions??

 Hello all my citizens, life bids me well. Hey Mulanda, do you have any genetics class this semester? I would like to sit in one of them unless they check ids. At the same time I'll get to meet mcGill crew. aright i await ur answer! Peace im out

 by the way, anybody interested in getting kittens? I have 4 cute kittens to give away. They are two month old and have black as a dominant color. Inform me if you guys (girls) want any. thanks

 What? The chessmaster is no longer popular among the female population? Hey chessmaster, I seriously gotta talk to you man. Are you playing to much chess or something?

 What establishment...? A+ on the midterm, pretty cool, eh... I almost failed my chemistry midterm,damn, it's only B, or may be even B- :( sux. gotta make it up on the final. Yeah, the world champ is over, and Russia did fiinsh first, cool, eh? Too bad I didn't make any bets with my buds at the club, heh :)

 hey salsa man. in case you haven't heard the news: according to the chessmaster, he is no longer popular among the female population of this establishment. let us hope it's just a temporary recession , so to speak. thanks for offering help, but I'm fine :)

 Yeah, yeah, Jeka. Read the last paragraph of my previous post again, it's explanatory about my evening yesterday.

 First. About myself. A+ on a midterm, best in the cass. Second. Andrei you're pathetic. Trick or treating at your age. Come on man. Well, actually, it's kind of normal for you. It's too funny, I can just imagine you with a big smile: trick or treat. Third. Roma, what's up man? Nice "hearing" from you. I may be going to Ottawa in February for a competition. Fourth and the best. Chicks. Vlad, you know I don't get you. Seriously, why aren't you running after her? Btw, if you need a hook up, ask Andrei he'll do it for you. You know what I mean? If he's not available I can try. O.k. just kidding. I'm writing this, because, myself, I've been staring at all the posible chicks you can see around here, at Concordia. Even now when I'm writing my head keeps on rotating (360 degrees about its axis). O.k. gotta go study now later

 Cool stuff Roman!! By the way, 2.5 hours of 'trick or treating' yesterday. Cool costumes from Cirque du Solei. Resulst: no candy. Reason: TOO BIG to be a kid!! Huh! (consequence: crying in the coner for 2.5 hours). End of sad story. Actually, I was looking after a group of kids who were 'trick or treating' yesterday night, but I still had a costume. Pretty fun, considering it was raining and it was cold. But who cares, the kids loved it!

 Last sun this year is leaving my sight. In a few minutes it will be gone. This year will be gone, so let it pass and let everything that happened this year pass. Pass for good. We can remember it if we want. We can remember from it what we want. Let's move on to new year, to new life, to new victories and new failures and their glory! Because every failure is a victory for someone else and vis-et-versa! Vivre! Mes amis, vivre! Cheers!

 Well, you might be very suprised by who may be possibly involved in a fight :)) Moreover, I'm anticipating a very curious life's situation arrising there, and the actors didn't get their roles yet... :) However, I can't say more than what I said, but I know for sure that someone will be "walking on the eggs" tonight trying not to break them. And maybe that person will not be alone. In any case!!!!! Everything will be fun after a couple of drinks. :)) Happy New Year everyone!!!!! Happy Holidays!! Have fun!!! Enjoy yourselves alone or with anybody you want!! And the only thing that I wish to all of you is: "Have a good next year, and let it be that your next year will be as good as this one or better, and that all of you will live up to your expections, your highest expections! Good luck."

 Dear Friends! Happy New Year! It's ironic how many "officially single" people will be attending the party. Looks like... ok, let's not go there. I want to finally see a fight or something. Getting into one would be the ultimate fulfilment. :)

 yeah, man, kick some ignorant redneck american dork ass!

 Nu Andruha, molodets. Seriously, it is nice to hear from you. I'm happy that you're celebrating the New Year's with us. So, it wa confirmed today about everything. There is going to be a gift exchange and obviously lots of fun. So good luck on your tunament, and you'd better come back as a champion.

 Hey Andrei! Nice to finally hear from ya. Roma is coming on the 28th or 29th. Good luck over there!

 Good afternoon Madames&Monseiners. It's presently 11:51 at Providence, Rhode Island. I finished my game 7mins ago. It was a fast win for me against some guy from Univ. of Wiscomsin or of Univ of Wayoming. The rest of the team is still playing. The tournament so far is not going too well. I have 3 wins and one loss. The loss was against a poor player from Univ of Toronto, but I coundn't care less about chess that day. Now everything is back to normal. There are 3 more rounds left. And I'm coming back on the 30th. I'm celebrating New Years in Montreal. I'm officially single now, so there is no particular reason for my going anywhere esle. Besides that, I'm going to work out and chill in the jacuzzy later on today. By the way, I hope that there is a plan for the New Year's eve, and I hope that Roman is already in MTL :) . And also to whom am I giving a gift, if we will have a girf exchange?! I have some spare gifts laying around that I'd like to give out. See you all soon. take care,

 Famous quotes (at an imaginary interview for developping cold fusion): - "Fuck Yeah!" - "No shit!" - "Duh!"

 Yeah, whatever...

 Oh, c'mon there. Don't make a friggin' big deal of it. The eternal fuckin' pondering on ever-important questions.

 And now, almost 24 hours later, not wasted anymore, I'm still pondering on a few questions that just don't stop bugging my mind. Oh well, we'll see.

 Ooooh, my friggin head...

 o.k. I'm sitting here half drunk. Andrei is leaving in a few hours, and man, we're having a blast now at Audrey's house. Man, I mean it's too bad he's leaving toight, becauase, there so much now that we could do to have fun (you know what I mean?). Well, anyways, the evening was a nice party to start with. I hope that in 2002 we'll have a good time. P.S. I'm so wasted

 By the way, check it out! I got an e-mail from our tenants in Moscow and that's what it said: " 2 days ago police came.They were looking for you because you have to serve a millitary service.Nastya." Cool stuff huh?!

 Tzaritca Polei!!!!!!!!!! sweet dude! :) Have fun everyone. Happy New Year if I don't see you. P.S. "spider_blabla" is what a computer leaves after it visits a site.

 My next assignment : A Guide to Torture.

 Fire howls madness When hate is brewed. Humans wage wars When time is cheap. And children drink blood When the mind is skewed. As the race pays high When troubles are a heap. A pacifier then.

 Merry christmas! Happy hannukah! Crazy Kwanzaa! Solemn and respectful ramadan! An overly enjoyable non-demoninational or pagan holiday! You get the point...just chill, people, enjoy yourselves!

 Jusus Christ the news spread fast!! lol. I came on to write something and Vlad, you made me smile, thanks. Yet, I don't want my life exposed on this blog, so let's keep it simple. Happy Christmas everyone. Anyway, I lived to bury my desire, To see my dreams corrode with rust. Now all that's left are fruitless fires That burn my empty heart to dust. Man, it's Chistmas!! Eventhough it's not the Ortodox one!

 Hey Andrei. Cheer up man. We're there for you. I've got some �������� in the fridge. Feel free to drop by before you leave. We'll poison some of those insects in your head.

 Hey everybody, just saying hi. I'm leaving to a chess tournament at Rhode Island at 4:30am on dec 26th. Wish me luck, I might need it. Yet, my reason for going there won't attend the tournament... What can I do? The spider left. That's life.

 Loki, maybe u didn't get the sort of inside joke in my last statement, but nevermind...... by the way, I am pretty much alive, radiant with energy, and so much love to give that is unbelivable :-)

 "the seed of all evil i suppose?" I'm sorry, being the seed of all evil, I cannot take credit for this man's fine writing...as for poetry, if you don't know where it comes from, you might want to check your pulse, I think you may just be dead...

 Guys I am the happiest man on this world!!!!!!!!! by the way, Fais, what's wrong with u? what is allt his poetic stuff? where is it comming from? the seed of all evil i suppose? tell us?

 Errors of grave nature Are suppositions of confusion. Stab in the dark is a Lying loss of emotions. All but sanity.

 Although I'm not the religious type, TyGon, I must admit that has quite a poetic ring to it, some sort of a romanticized tone of impending doom to it... As for you, Vlad, may you be smitten in divine anger the next time you choose to partake in a bottle of fine spirits without telling me while my proximity is such that a few strides only would have taken you to my door...a pox upon you! I am forsaken! Murther! Murther most foul!

 Good morning everyone. Having been prematurely awaken[ed] in a dying glitter of the afternoon sunlight, I allow my disturbed mind to wander upon the illustrious ventures we had embarked upon herein last night. Few could grasp the utter meaning of our philosophically intense conversations filled with intricate details of the most marvelled at natural process. But those fortunate enough to withstand the temptation to quit reading this post three lines ago will shudder at the significance of the impact we created on the issue of women's rights to freedom of sexual preferences.

 man!! YYYYYYIIIIIIIIIIHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!! The school is over! and i have so much stuff to to!!! some much fun stuff!!! I got my ticket to winnipeg on the 1st and I'm getting tickets for boston on monday!!!! playing chess!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

 Sacrilege and Fire both kindle from the same master. But only the blade of damascus shall hail the caster.

 Mmmh, yeah, you got a point there...that's a very interesting angle you're approaching this subject from...but, I guess this wasn't meant to me...for future reference, let me say this to the "Vanier Graduates": Congratulations...I hope this diploma helps you get from point A to point B, where point A is hell and point B is a fiery inferno of pain...oh, and in my dictionnary, congratulations means "screw you people I'm officially pissed (and somewhat jealous) right now..." I WANNA GO BACK TO SCHOOL...man, I hate this...

 Well, hello to all the graduates of Vanier college. I hardly wrote on the Blog, but now...now that I am drunk, I have a glimps of inspiration. Lets see, what do I feel like writing...nothing really. I guess it's not the best time for me to write, so ...yes that's it.

 Just to specify, what Vlad is trying to say is that the price for staying over at our place is usually paid with booze, blood and signing your soul over to me. And some more booze.

 Hard work pays off after some time. Laziness pays off NOW! Roma, I talked to my 'mates: you can stay over at our place, as long as you bring food and drink. Well, actually, drink, and some more drink. And - did I mention? - don't forget drink. Don't bother with presents - we'll settle for boooooze!

 Phiuh!! I'm through.... 6 out of 6. pretty sad, I got used to being stressed... and I've learned again one thing:'Studing pays off'. take care, see you in the library, next year... Man, that was fun!!!!!!!!

 Harrumph.... rgh ghg rght. YYEEEHHHAAAA!

 Kool-kool. watching porn and getting drunk for the NY is good enough. what kinda gifts do you guys expect, so that mine wouldn't be too obscene.. Lemme know asap if it's ok with the roomates..i'm gonna get my tickets soon

 hey, I still have two more exams.... two more, only two more, just two more, simply two more, not more than two, just two to go, it's like 1+1=2, only that. that's it, two more.... I'm FUCKED. man I'm going to freakn' jump around when I'll walk out of the examenation room on friday... I'll start jumping and yelling yayayaya,yeyeyeye (P.S. I'm fine, I already had some "pproffesssionall" help). :)) Jis!!!! I can't belive that if I'll study and study, i might actually learn something and do my exam and IT WILL finish... man, just a little more patience... alright (please no comments)

 Somebody is fairly regularly reading this blog from Quebec-City. I mean, welcome, of course, but I'm dying to find out urlLink who you are ! The fact that I don't have any friends from over there makes you even more interesting.

 Yeah, no shit, Salsa-man! You fucked it up! :) It's all good now, I fixed it :). We're definitely coming to your party! Roma, I'm gonna ask two of my other roommates, and, if that's ok with them, you can stay over at our place. Mind you, the sofa is horrible. I want ALL of the people to respond with their plans for the new year's. Even if you're going to get drunk watching porn. If you're still undecided, join the party.

 Yo. did something happen to this page? I'm not sure my last post went o.k.

 Gift exchange. That's for sure guys. Anyone whose comming to the party is bringing a gift. Just a little something that doesn't have to be expensive. it's simply symbolic. As to the place we just need a confirmation from one of the members of the blog (Josee?). I'll try to call most of the poeple this week. P.S. If you guys have no plans for Friday come to my dance school's x-mass party. It's free and I'm doing a show. later.

 Great. took my only 2 hours to guess my password. I've beaten all records.. That's what free alcohol does to you...I just found out that my fencing club is sposored by a local bar, and that every x-mas they give us two kegs of beer for free...man, that's something. I wouldn't wanna go into details what happened afterwards.. Ya, I think I'm coming over to Montreal for a couple of days to see ya, i'm planning to come somewhere around 26-28..and spending about three to four days ...and I'll probably need place to stay, too, any volounteers..? I also propose a random gift exchange for the New Year, and let's make it nasty and stupid, so that someone can get stuck with my wacked gift I'm gonna get...I'll try to make it as nasty as possible..Also, are you gonna go to some club for the NY or smth ? And I tell you what, let's stay at someone's place rather than going to some club..nice savings on alcohol and u know. What r the plans anyway.lemme know asap so i'd be prepared...u know..

 Deeply in the state of a temporary thoughtless apathy I am. So sick of studying I am! Not only can I not see any ending to this torture, but also start I seeing things very few of you mortals can even dream of seeing. Sitting in my refuge cave, I have discovered something groundbreaking. One of the tomes of the "Antarctic Record" on the shelf that angrily faces my tired face has a spelling mistake in its very title!!! It says ANTARTIC RECORD. Oh, amazing powers of comparison! There are dozens of tomes , and only one with the mistake! Gosh, so proud of myself I am.

 da da man, I don't know what to say at all. And it's not about TyGon. I'm just mute. I have a comp test to study for and I actually might succed in following my plan and finishing all that stuff today. Yeeeee. Just need a little more effort and time... Cool eh?! I don'y know why I'm saying all this, I guess I'm just tired and nervous before the test. take care guys,

 Oh, I see, I see... TyGoN. The "it's-not-you,-it's-me" stuff :). Hey, I've got nothing to tell ya. I don't think you need my compassion :). BTW, look what I found: urlLink faisal.co.uk . A curious URL. Other than that, ladies and gents, congrats on the snow! Viva winter! Josee, you promised to show me where to buy skis. I can't wait. Or, just tell me where it is. By the way, I haven't talked to you after Wednesday night. Did you have fun? Share.

 You Faisal, I didn't know u were, well , u were you. i mean in that way, I realize i don't know u at all, there is more to you, that meets the blinking eye they say, interesting........... well man it is all good.......................... I could propouse u many solutions, one would be, go and get drunk, really DRUNK.............. or getsomeone else, there is plenty of them around there, just don't deprive urself of the beuty of life, just be, I mean BE and that is it, fulfill ur dreams with anly your being u, do u really need something eles than just being? really, do u?

 Hmmm..why am i pissed? No particular reason. I'm fine. I'm doin very well, thank you very much for asking. No really! I am fine. What? that? Oh no thats nothing. Just my futile attempt to auto-destruct. Nothing too serious. i am ok. I really am. Dude! seriously! I am fine. I am calm as the desert breeze and light-headed as the african monsoon. I am one with the universe. I am the guru of calmness. I am in peace and serenity. No really! I am good. I am fine. Dont u worry about me, no sirree! I am as clear as a whitsle. I am as good as a new pair of boots. I am fine. I am doing very well, thank you for asking. She told me only now, that she happens to have a boyfriend. Oh well, thats nothing. That does not affect me one bit. No sirree! I am as strong as a bull. She wants to be just friends. Hey ! I'm up for that. That sounds good to me ! I am fine. I would be glad to be her friend while her boyfriend nibbles her ear. Hey , i'm a man. I can take anything. By the way, have I told you I am doing fine? No? Well dude! I am doing great! I am A ok. I have also developed an epileptic twitch in the left eye. Cheerios!!

 Alright, guys, let us not promote patriarche too much here :). At least because now our fraternity is broken into by Josee. I mean, admit it, girls are nice sometimes. You know when.. :) I'm tired. I'm going home. Fuck dynamics. (wow, that has a double meaning :). If anyone has any ideas for tonight, come on over. Make sure you bring enough [i.e. A LOT of] alchohol. I'll probably cook something :). Later.

 To start welcome to all the new members of this blog. You'd better write some good stuff here (just kidding). This information may be useful to Roman and all those who are intersted. We are not going to the states for the New Year (or at least most of us). We are partying in Montreal, and probably going skiing the week-end after the New Year's Eve to Laurentides. So Roma, it would be nice to see you there if you can make it. If anyone is interested, post your concern about it and we will evaluate your application. I'll post more precise information later, unless somebody does it before me. So I hope you guys are all finished soon with your exams. P.S. I totally agree with the mathematical proof given below.

 You know, TyGoN, I think you're right. They're evil. They fuck with your head. Especially those self-sufficient and yet badly attention-dependent sluts with high ambitions and strong beliefs... They make me feel nauseous. Ah, whatever. Sorry, it was quite a morning today :). My differential equations test is in an hour, and I'm out of my basement cage. Don't wish me anything. I'm ready. I slept well. I am prepared, relaxed and confident. Yeah, no shit I am. On Wednesday night, four people from this blog went out to drink and dance to some place I have a great trouble remembering the name of. It was cool, but the timing was sort of bad. It's finals time, you know. As you probably noticed, this post makes almost no sense. I'm just releasing the tension before the test. So, you may go about your own business right about... now. No, not yet.... now! Go! What the hell? Why are you still staring at me??? And yeah, I finally asked her phone no. But it got erased in my phonebook somehow. Oh well, I'll ask again. P.S. Good job Roman! Way to go, man! Way to go.

 Oh yeah. I've done my exams two days ago, sweet. How's your exams guys? I must finish up with an A- average, or may be B+. Here is a cool pic for you guys, http://www.virtual-hideout.net/news_images/dog.jpg Gotta run for my fencing lesson, ciao.

 Congrats Russo! I've never had any doubts about you. Well.. maybe just a few :). You'll pass the interview if you finally get a haircut and try not to swear. Show them your pics too :)). TyGoN: excellent proof! Which course is that for? Looks like the Fundamentals of Macroevil Microanalysis. And, most importantly, why are you so pissed off at women all of the sudden? Hey, I barely recognized you that day in the metro. Is Concordia treating you well? By the way, you people have the best pizza over there. Jouejoue: As for female population, I can see four names on the list, but we haven't heard anything from those peolpe for months. Audrey's on the list two, but I guess she is either too lazy to bother or thinks we're too pathtic for her :) Cheers.

 * Ahem!''phhbbtt(.....clears throat phlegm.....) * Mathematical proof Women = Time and Money or Time * Money Time is Money so Time = Money therefore, Women = Money * money = Money**2(or squared) Money is the root of all evil, so the square root of evil is Money hence, Women = (square root of evil)**2(or squared) Women = evil. ..... QED

 Guys I just got my Admission letter: "Software Eng. Co-op" yeah baby, "Co-op here I go" just need to pass that dammed intrewiev, what ever u spell it, ok, one thing cleare, there is no Vlad team, there never was a Vlad team and there never will be a Vlad team, CLEAR? and ofcource wellcome all of u

 hello people! Hi Im josee. Dont feel like writing just wanted to say hello and glad to be part of the Vanier lounge. Oh by the way I used to go to vanier and I studied music but I walked out the day they told me I wasnt gonna get a singing lesson cause they didnt give a fuck about me.... (not with a bottle of vodka in my hand like ben though....damn!) So see y'all later and I might surprise you vlad.. by the way, is there even a female population to this site?

 3 down, 3 to go

 2 down, 2 to go

 I am sttrrrraiiigghht! No, I am NOT in the closet. I am openly straight. I realize it's not cool to be straight these days, but I am straight. Hm... straight, straight, straight. Man, that sounds so straight its' unbelievable. Sometimes I think I'm too straight. But, as straight as I can be, I am open to adventures. Straight adventures. I suppose it's straightened out now. Phew!

 Let me start off by saying it's a great honour to become a part of Team Vlad. Be assured I will not let you all down when we make the secret sign and assemble into a gigantic robot that shoots lasers from its eyes to fight off radioactive dinosaurs. Man, those pesky radioactive dinosaurs. A word of introduction, I'm Ben, Vlad's second roommate, once a Vanier Computer Science student, until I walked out of class with my trusty vodka flask after the teacher started reciting binary values one by one ("so, as you see, this is 1-0-0-0-1-0-1-0...the next one is..."). I've jumped from one tech job to the next, passing through and leaving most of the top telecom companies, before spending a year as a tech director in a small web design firm and going freelance when it closed. I'm aiming to return to Vanier next september to wreak havoc upon the unsuspecting masses' sanity and corrupt the girls from the christian club. I have a thing for sarcasm and cynicism, and a theory that everyone is bisexual deep inside. Vlad only admitted me so I could point the fingers he couldn't...*evil grin* Til next time, enough useless blabbing...

 Hi. I'm a permanent resident, and I guess I would be able to get visa and stuff, it's just that this way it's gonna come up way too expensive, plus, Im not a big fan of skiing, u know Oh well, I guess this new year i'll have to spend with bunch of assholes from the fencing team. Who's Ben and Josee anyway..?

 it seams that the female population of this blog has increased by 100% compared to the previous months............... and andrei, don't get sad, u still have me............... (not in that way u pervert, just like a friend !!! )

 Alright, ladies and gents. Please welcome the two new members of this fine blog: BEN and JOSEE. They are fully qualified to participate, since both of them studied at Vanier at some point of their lives. BEN is one of the two people I live with. He is a web-designer and a very disciplinned person to whom it takes absolutelly no effort to get up before 2 pm. He's gonna tell you the rest. JOSEE is a friend of ours. I've met her about three times. She dances, sings and does many other interesting things. In case you're wondering... normally, I wouldn't ever think of bringing these people here due to their dangerous potential to suddenly make this place cool. But it's 3 AM, the plastic bottle of brandy is empty, and we have nothing to do but discuss kinky stuff listening to Depeche Mode. So, Ben [aka Loki], you finally have an occasion to bring your wise word to the masses. Josee [aka joseita], welcome to the sissyfight paradize. Bring it on! P.S. If you ever happen to read the archives, remeber to read bottom-to-top. Otherwise it doesn't make sense.

 hellooo

 Well, all I can say is that right now I'm just left to watch if my boat will sink or if it will continue flowing down the stream. I finished my exams today. Now I'm waiting for results. Good luck on your exams people.

 thank god I didn't get inspired like that during the exam, otherwise I would of just went to 'Pont Champlain' and the newspaper had my name on the last page... :) "There is yet powder in the podwer-horns!"

 Yeah, no shit Andrei. It's pitty that you don't get inspired DURING the test, as opposed to when it already passed [away]... along with your *boat*. Sucker. Don't worry though - you'll get another chance to test your *boat* again... in the spring waters... of the next semester.

 it's an interesting feeling after you have submitted your exam... It's like... as if you made a paper boat and let it flow down the stream caused by the spring rains on some street nearby. You made that little boat, and it's there, it's flowing, rasing dry last-year's leaves and parts of smoked cigarettes that melted out from the under the snow. You cann't help your boat, it's there, it's in the stream. You don't know when it will sink and you hope that it would flow far; that it would flow forever... But it will sink and it's not up to you to deside if it went far enough. Yet, it's up to you to face the concequences. If it sank too early, then it was a bad boat. It's your falt. You made it. And imagine if there is a kid beside you who is watching your boat flow... If it will sink, then you suck in his eyes. And you better have another piece of paper to make a new better boat. But you don't have anymore paper. And you suck even more. He won't forget that... He barely knows you. And he knows that you suck...at making boats. Imagine now that there are a group of people watching you. And those people love you respect you. And they also know that if your boat sinks then you suck. If it does, then they won't look at you the same way again untill they forget. You might be a good guy, but they love ones who make good boats. Too bad, they are not somebody off the street. They love you and respect you. Yet, you might suck. What can you do? You can pray and drag your ass to the library and study. Because if you suck, there is no place for you in this world.

 alright, Hmmm. I see Roma that you can't go to US. that kinda sucks. It also sucks that Vlad can't go. Well, for those of you who are willing to go, well, we are making the reservations tonight or tomorrow. So I guess that it would be something like dec30 to jan1 up state NY, something like 1.5 hour drive from MTL. It's going to be a chalet and skiing there. Maybe the chalet will have a pool and a jacuzzi, I'm not too sure. people who are going so far: Annie and me, that you know. People you don't know are from US Dima, Andrei, Ben; from Canada: Pascal, Annie-Marie. (all of the people that you don't know are chess players) people who are interested in going, but I still need to have a confirmation are Evgueni and Audrey, Katy(my sis), Janna, Lili, and Donovan. The total cost for the trip would be 150$US all included. i.e. chalet, ski, food. Transportaion from MTL will be provided by car either by Pascal or my sis or Donovan. So if there are anybody else who want's to join in, you are welcome. Take care, Andrei P.S. Roma, what is your status in Canada, maybe you'll be able to get a visa to the states?!

 Hi, Andrei, I got the message. Man, you could've figure out the answering machine isn't mine, in future leave messages in english, or smth If you called about the new year stuff - i'm not going to the States. If you are gonna stay in Canada for the new year, let me know.

 hey andreii, i am in school til 08:00PM, so tell me where you are hiding and we will meet

 I'm not going to New Hampshire, I can't. I would go if you are guys going somewhere in Canada, if it's in the States, its not only the money, I would have troubles with visa. So I guess I'm not going to New Hampshire..

 Ok Roma, are you going to New Hamshire skiing with us or not????? it's 100$ US per person people coming so far: Jeka, Audrey, Annie, Andrei, Dima, Pascal, maybe my sis, maybe Janna, maybe donovan, maybe Lee and Joana, maybe some Annie's friends. We are going to reserve the place this week end. dates are either from 24 dec to 1st JAn either 29dec-1st Jan. Questions, contact me or Jeka.

 I want you guys to finally decide, what we, or at least, you, are gonna do for the NY, X-mas and all that crap. U know, it is kinda late, really. We should've start earlier.

 its rilli pritti chip, jus 150 dollorz u knaw, for de whol ixpriens an its for a weackk!

 yeah, thanks for the info Igar. Have a great one.

 guys u planned it all wrong......... look me and like 10 frinds reserved a chalet in octomber in st-anne, for the holly daz period, to go and ski for a weack, it doesn't cost that much, the whole expirience is around 150$ adn for a week of skiing that is pretty cheap since we r a big group..... so if u plan now it is a bit too late............... too bad, c ya i am exausted

 4 tests in one day, plus a fucking assigment is this phun or what?

 Hmmmm.... Vlad...?!

 OK guys. I think... count me out. Even if the prices are the same, we still have to get there somehow, and we need food and drink and all that. Way too much to be taken care of. And it's much farther away than, say, St. Sauveur. I'm kinda not comfortable with waisting 150 bucks for spending a day in the car just to get drunk in the US. No offence. It's not just money. See y'all. Later

 O.k. I checked out the prices posted by Andrei. It seems that all the prices are about the same as here in Quebec. So it really doesn't matter where we're going. Yesterday, Andrei and I talked about New Hampshire. Apperently, it costs 30$ U.S. per person per night. It sounds perfectly fine with me, because as I said the prices are the same as here. Someone needs to do the reservations, and for that we need a for sure confirmation from everyone whose interested. So please post your confirmation or let's call eachother. Our suggestion was to go from 30th of December to 1st of January. So please let me or Andrei know as soon as possible. Roma, I think you wanted to come. Am I right? Here are the links about places in Quebec. http://www.bonjourquebec.com/francais/cms/hebergement/921053.html http://www.bonjourquebec.com/francais/cms/hebergement/905069.html http://www.bonjourquebec.com/francais/cms/hebergement/900018.html http://www.bonjourquebec.com/francais/cms/hebergement/914061.html http://www.bonjourquebec.com/francais/cms/hebergement/854810.html http://www.bonjourquebec.com/francais/cms/hebergement/6721438.html later

 Hey everyone. I was doing some clean-up on the server. The address of this page now vladster.net/blog , as opposed to vladster.net/blog.html earlier. Update your bookmarks please.

 Alright, guys I have some intereting prices for us. Take a look. these are cottages for a number of peple. Ski tickets are not included. It's in new hampshire http://www.sunnybrookcottages.com/rates2000.htm this are condos that may include ski ticket prices. Very interesting http://package.worldres.com/cgi-bin/package/pk_search.cgi? pkg_id=559&lang_id=1&site_id=48&front_end_id=703 this are also cabins http://www.riverbankmotel.com/#winter_rates Ok tha;s it, I'll have some more stuff later. PS. all of this is in USA and can everyone who is interested in going anywhere tell me what exactly he/she wants to do and when I suggest go somewhere on dec 23-26 at least. later

 Andrei, did that guy play Kramnik or something??? Give us the link.

 Ruslan Ponomariov of Ukraine became, at 18, the youngest world chess champion. At 18!!

 Thanks for your advice Vova. In fact I did go to the student exchange office and will aply for England as my first choice. I'm also very happy that you've come realize that you're not me. Finally! It's about time man! But imagine, Vlad in Australia, Andrei in France and me in England. We'll have connections all over the world. (if at leaest one ofus gets accepted of course). O.k. enough for now

 A note on the wall in a secterary's office: "Do you want to speak with a man who is in charge, or with a woman who knows what's going on?"

 Jeka, your university must have the student exchange office. They have all the detailed info concerning Concordia specificaly. If I were you, I would go to England with no hesitation. But, thankfully, I am not you, so I'll go to Australia :)).

 It's called the CREPUQ program. www.echanges-etudiants.qc.ca/en/accueil.html or check the Bilateral partners of Concordia

 Late responce. Andrei, Germany doesn't have programs to study in English. Some of the Scandinavian universities do however. I was mistaking. Now I'm really considering to go to Europe next year too. I'm thinking either England or France. I have untill Feb 15th to apply. So I think I'll go for it and then who knows?. So which one of the two would you people suggest to me. And, Andrei, where do I find out about the Quebec government giving money?

 Hey, Mulanda's back! Are your ok? I heard about that terrible thing in Congo. Social Scientist said you went there. Is that true? Yo, Ben, I made you an admin. Be a good boy. :))

 I'm not in biochem. I'm in Cell and Molecular Biology. But I still have to deal with this course for lab technique purposes. Only one actually.

 hey faisal, i never knew you were in biochem.. I thought i was the only one in this blog who had to deal with this ridiculous class they call "Anal chem" Cheers.

 Heh, fun, fun, fun!!! The process requiring the most precision in our lab is putting one's feet on the desk while avoiding flipping the oscilloscope over, because when the oscilloscope lies on the side [or on the floor], the x-axis becomes y-axis, which in turn introduces considerable [and very mean ] deviations into one's measurements. "And these drunken idiots will build bridges and design spacecraft."

 Welcome to Analytical Chemistry. In today's lab and the labs for the rest of the semester, you will come to understand that 0.01 percentage deviation from the expected result will be penalized for 1 mark of 6 for results. every increment of 0.01 away from the expected result will result in further penalization till the mark of 0 for your lab report. Therefore, remember that you are not allowed to have higher heartbeat or pulse. You are not allowed to micropipette and think about anything else at the same time. You do not try to relieve your itch or pain anywhere. You do not bother to look at anyone else and read your buret while taking its measurement. You clean your glasses to avoid distance from desired result on your graduated cylinder. You measure your substances to nearest thousandth of a decimal. Please refrain from all moisture around the lab to avoid product loss. Dry your palms and your skin. If you sweat naturally, please use tar on your skin to block your pores. These are simple instructions to avoid result deviation. remember that failure in lab result will mean a failure in the course. There are 5 labs. Have fun. Breathing is optional. I hope you enjoy ur session.

 your momma's ass

 Yeee. baby!! I've got an almost free tuition this semester. Don't ask how. I don't know! :)) Jeka, do you know which Universities in Gremany are offering these programs? I need it ASAP, because I'm sending the applicaion to France next week, since I didn't find anything in Germany that's in French or in English

 I know that Germany has programs in English. Other ones, I don't know.

 I wouldnt believe the no experience needed thing. Get some knowledge about PCR, and DNA isolation . not hard. They'll probably tell you to move bottle from one place to another, and switch bases and solutions.Thats what RNA isolation and PCR amplication is. Move, wait, change, out, move wait. Get some lessons with micropipettes. They might give you some tutorials. Have fun.

 "By the way, whatever, Roman." What's that supposed to mean ?? Crap, man, thousand bucks just to study away! Does anyone know if Sweden or Finland have programs in English? And, yeah, does anyone thinks that idea of going abroad alltogether would be cool ?

 To the biochem maniacs overthere (namely Faisal and Mulanda). I got a little confused: Montreal Neurological Institute. POSITION Laboratory Assistant. JOB DESCRIPTION Plasmid DNA preparation and characterization with agarose electrophoresis PCR product amplification. Site-directed mutagenesis Isolation of total RNA from tissues. SKILLS REQUIRED None Do you think Ishould apply? I AM serious.

 I did in fact check it out . Fortunately, there is no special preference given to Europe (which would make no sense anyway). So, I guess we're cool.

 Cool. Check out the scolarships offered to Australia. You might have to pay for everything from your own pocket. Europe, I think there is $1000/month from QC gouv. By the way, whatever, Roman.

 Heyya! I looked at some Australian universities' websites, and their winter semester starts on July 29 and lasts until Dec. 7. Sveeeet! I'll probably go somewhere like Sydney in 2003. We'll see. There's also New Zooland. I would really want to go somewhere in the Southern hemisphere.

 Tell us more, Andrei, tell us more..

 I'm most probably going to France to study for next year. Quebec gouv. is giving a few scolarship away and I heard that this year there is not enough students going, so everybody gets them.

 I always wanted to go abroad, but I think it's gonna cost u a fortune, unless you get a schoolarship or smth.

 Not bad Roman. O.k. Who's interested in going to study away? Like in Europe (eg. England) or something.

 I just had to share this. I finally qualified for the inter-varsity championships in fencing, and currently seeded 5th.

 Bouf, sure. By the way, history can not be wrong or right, bad or good. It's just history, thus the word used.

 I like the zero-constant thing. It's pretty deep. As for the history, I don't think anyone should avoid commenting on that. History is not holy. You should not hold your breath when thinking about it. If it's wrong, it's wrong. True, we can't do anything about it, but we should not blindlessly agree with whatever happened. Humanity has an inherent condition of picking wrong geniuses that tends to fuck it up every now and then. 226 million of silent people = mass psychosis, a desperate dream that lasted for 74 years and is thankfully over. Think about the symbolism: 226 million of silent people . 226 tonnes of dynamite waiting for a spark. Russia is a country with an unpredictable past.

 :) Man, I like the statistic: every two days at least :) Well, makes me smile :). By the way, today is the day of Lenin's death. Twenty years ago there was a minute of silence over an entire country during this day. How freak'n impressive!! 226million people, silent! And they believed! (please, no silly comments. Have a little respect, it's our history)

 Laws on Love: Brains x Beauty x Availability = a constant the constant is usually zero.

 Laws on Life: If anything can go wrong, it will. If there is a possibility of several things going wrong, the one that will cause the most damage will be the one to go wrong. Corollary: If there is a worse time for something to go wrong, it will happen then. If anything just cannot go wrong, it will anyway. If you perceive that there are four possible ways in which something can go wrong, and circumvent these, then a fifth way, unprepared for, will promptly develop. Left to themselves, things tend to go from bad to worse. If everything seems to be going well, you have obviously overlooked something. Nature always sides with the hidden flaw. Mother nature is a bitch.

 Are you serious? Could you write it here, because I need to know it too. You know I have this condition.

 Ye baby!! Of course it does!! Ever since I got her phone number she changed a lot!! :))

 I know that's a little late, but I want to post it anyway. So that at least it would be officially recorded somewhere. Last Saturday, I competed in Longueuil. Heidi and I took 3rd place in standard dances and made the finals in Latin. For the first time we kicked some serious ass. And we'll continue doing more of that in the times to come. Now, I'm just wandering: does it have anything to do with my partner's breaking up with her boyfriend?

 Man! That's some pretty words used there! :) Jis! Should I feel like some kind of pimp living legend or something? :) And I thought that I lost this reputation when I entered McGill, and now it's only Danny The Civil and The Lion Pimp whos life depends on the species in question. Anyhow, there is nothing more to post. And I'm looking foward to the new design of this site. Hopefully, it will work with Netscape.

 I think the time spent studying is irrelevant in your case, Andrei. Your (academic) success is largely dependent on the percentage of female species in the library. Furthermore, your (overall) success entirely depends on... the inhabitance density of the aforementionned species at school in general. Think carefully before you take that as a compliment :). Don't look for too much coherence in any case. I'm allowed to write ingenious nonsense, too, you know... Yeah, by the way, where's RUSSO ??? I need somebody to bark with [at] :). Come on, Igar, did you just give up on us altogether? How's life? Another thing. This place is going to turn 1 year old soon. Do you think we need to do something special? Like assembling all the (active) members together somewhere? Opinions?

 Ha! Life crawls back to this place! :) So *my future kollega! If it will take 50 years then let it be! (Assuming our mutual progress and yours at a slower pace :)) Just kidding. Anyway, whatever. Dancing is cool and I like it. As for ingenious thoughts... While going for a walk today, I figured out an important mathematical relationship between marks at school and everything else. It is: GPA=T*(MA) where GPA is the grade, T is time spent studing and MA is not 'mass and acceleration' as most of you might think, but MA is metnal ability, which can be any real value from 0 to 1. Farther, T&MA are both functions of two variables 'I' and 'N' where 'I' is the interest in a particulat subject and 'N' is the need to study it. To make this formula accurate and universally valid, one has to trust his/her/its conciousness and honesty and be aware of 'external factors' that constitue the uncertainty of such calculation. for further information please refere to my research site: www.myass.qc.ca

 if you did refer to www.myass.qc.ca and you found that this site does not exist, try pressing the 'refresh' button and keep on doing so untill you reach the site in question (keeping track of how many times you have pressed 'refresh') Now, when you finally realized that there is no such site, and you have pressed 'refresh' for more than 5 times, you can definitely put 0 for the value of MA in the formula mentioned above and calculate you GPA with a 200% accuracy :)

 I'm expanding the science&math section of my three-story library with some new rare acquisitions, and I need a cheap shelf really bad. Where can one buy a good (read: cheap ) bookshelf in Montreal? Help? Anyone?

 Right! No shit, who do we got here! A fucking dancer, private Merengue. You can come over to my dance school and fuck "your" teacher. O.k. don't take it bad or anything, but in order to call yourself my "kollega" you need a few more years (say about 50). As to my popularity as a dancer, you will never succeed in taking it away, once again, because it will take you some time. Oh yeah, Andrei, I didn't know that Audrey is that good for you. I mean now she's gonna have to take a few steps down to "reach your level". And if you want to compete, gosh, I will laugh my ass of when I see you wearing make-up. Finally, don't you change your nick name. Or do you want us to be alike even here on vladster? But don't worry, I like you anyways, it's just funny what you wrote. So, what's with up dancing, everyone seems to be so into it now. Vlad, are you getting any better? P.S. One last thing, Andrei. I've always believed that people do professional ass shaking in other circumstances (let's not get to dirty here). So if that's what you want to compete in, then... I'd rather keep those issues personal.

 Oh, Vlad, you think that's bad? You should see what she does to me since she started taking that "12 easy steps to becoming a tortionnary for the medieval Qing chinese regime" course...Buddha save my soul!

 Yeah, like HispanicDanceMaster or something. Can't wait to see you compete. OK, seriously Andrei, I want you two to quit that thing. See, I happen to be chosen as Audrey's dance-practice dummy at home. And that means she is trying to reach your *level* at the expense of my sanity.

 Hey!! I had my first dance lesson in Evgueny's dance school with Audrey yesterday night!!! iiiiIyyyyyyyyyyaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!! That was sooooooo freak'n damn sweet :)) We've learned *TANGO* and a Hispanic dance that I don't know how to spell. I mean Audrey is a good partner, hmmm... she is good, hmmmm, just a little more practice needed to get to my level, but she is fine :P. And Jeka... I didn't really want to give you competition in your popularity as a dancer, as well I didn't really want to win any of your future trophies in dance turneys, but you see.... :)) Remo asked me if I want to compete and I said maybe, so soon *kollegga* :)) Audrey and I will see you and Hidy* on the dance floor!! (if Audrey will be good enough) (huh!) So take care!! And prepare to some professional ass shaking! Jis! Should I change my nick name now or something?! hehe

 Hurray!

 To the russian population of this blog: Happy Old Russian New Year!! :) (*kollegga) hehe.

 I found one too. It measures about 6 cm, but I cant find its picture.

 Shit!! The integral thing actually works and it's freak'n cool!!! :)) Man, you won't believe this, I just got invited to such a tournament in Europe!!!!!!!! But it's too early to brag about it, so I'll get some more info first. :))

 To those of you who had weird fun designing those fiesty online robos at Vanier (remember?), have a look at urlLink this . Fun, eh?

 Fais, are you still there? Come on, talk to us. I finally got that particle accelerator you asked for. Wanna take a look? It's inter-galactic. The beast accelerates the freakin' particles like crazy. I shot a few rays at Betelgeuse last night. Now waiting for the light to come back, so I can see if I shot it down.

 yo mummah

 O.k. guess who's here with me now. Please let's welcome Evgueni's new sex toy... Alright, I didn't know that. Are you for real? Yes, my shift starts in 69 minutes... and our contract is an open one. That's too long. Why not 69 seconds? You're a student and you cannot afford me yet... Can't wait to graduate People take a guess who that is. later

 Holly cow! This thing fuckin' rocks! http://integrals.wolfram.com/index.en.cgi

 Wai, je suis ton pere. Now, how come je suis ton pere? Huh?

 Drunken orgy at my place tomorrow at 9pm...bring some booze, then we'll all share...or Binaca... *shivers and vomits*

 Yes!! They changed it :)) So 3.01 and may go higher, because there was a mistake in grading of Computer final :))

 Yeah! No s**t. Btw, C'est qui ton pere.

 At the forefront of the scientific progress ...

 Whoa, dude, anybody else experiencing Binaca withdrawal symptoms? *shake and vomit*

 Got my marks for the past semester. Mediocrity sucks. Need to go study. See you all in May. P.S. Hey Andrei. Give me a call.

 hey-o, I'm back in Mtl :)

 Check this out!! AUTOnomy concept vehicle are sandwiched in the skateboard-like chassis, and the application of a new technology eliminates foot pedals, the instrument panel and the steering column. http://www.gm.com/company/gmability/environment/products/ adv_tech/autonomy_design_010702.html AUTOnomy is the first vehicle designed from the ground up around a fuel cell propulsion system and the first to combine fuel cells with x-by-wire technology, which allows steering, braking and other vehicle systems to be controlled electronically rather than mechanically. http://www.gm.com/company/gmability/environment/ products/adv_tech/autonomy1_010702.html Basically the car will turn or stear by speeding up or slowing down one of the four wheels. Cool huh?! GM presented this hybrid yesterday in at the North American International Auto Show. There is more stuff at the GM's site, I gave the address above.

 Yes, Jeka! Tell Audrey that as soon as I'm back in Mtl, which will be tonight, we can have our dance courses. And if there is a deposit needed, she can pay for me and I'll give her the money back. Man, I can't wait to start dancing either!! :))

 Andrei, first congrads on your 2nd place man. Of course, you are still not as good in chess as I am for example. So I don't think that it's a bad result for a beginner as you. Second, I'm all for Vancouver. It's been a long time I wanted to go. Let's plan it and make it, even if "are" going to Cuba in the summer. Skiing? Not a bad idea, but in two weeks I have a competition so I can't. Maybe this week. We'll see. And finally, are you seriously gonna take dance classes? 'Cause Audrey can't wait anymore.

 Ok, the new champion is not that of a dork. He is ok, I feel sorry for him at some aspects, but he is fine. I was just mad yesterday that I didn't win. Oh well, I didn't even expect to come second, or moreover to tie for the first. Anyway, now I came to realize that I'm just empty; I did what I wanted to do and now there are no more goals left that I can think about. I mean I know that you don't care, but I don't care that you don't care. Anyhow, what about going skiing some next week-end or something? By the way, anybody interested to go to Vancouver over the summer just for fun? No, no, not by bike or anything of that kind. I'm serious and Ev and Vlad and Audrey don't give me this funny look, it's not as mad as swimming to Cuba. I mean we'll visit Vancouver and then take a short trio to the montains. Huh?! :)

 Alright, well, hi everybody. Basically, I tied for first with that dorky guy. Then I lost in the playoffs, so officially I'm second place in Canadian Junior Chess Championship. Not bad, although there were no trophies just money prices, so I guess I don't have a proof of my result. Yet you guys can check it on www.chess.ca or www.chessmanitoba.com if interested. Besides that, I'm going to see the city tomorrow and I'm coming back on Tuesday night. So see you all soon! Take care. P.S. I might go see some curling game tomorrow, how exciting!! :)) (it's the national sport in Manitoba) P.S.S. I can't belive that I did actually not bad in this tourney, considering my mood and state of mind when I came here. And now I'm just dead tired.

 A little recap on the most recent week-end at Dasha's chalet. Upon arrival we truly enjoyed some Evgueni made sausage with rice (at list some of us). Of course the night unfolded into the usual drinking process followed by a snowfight between some members of our crew. At about 5am silence took over due to Vlad's falling asleep on the couch and not telling anyone that it actually unfolds. As a result two people were sleeping on the floor. The next major event was the skiing on Mont St-Sauveur. It was quite an experience because a few people fell on their asses quite often. Who were those people? Sorry, I can't tell you this. The hottest point was the after skiing getting high on BINACA, brought in by David. Man, these are some serious drugs. (for those who don't know, it's a breath refreshner). In the middle of the night, having had enough BINACA, some of us decided to make a dance competition. So who do you think was the best? We ended the trip with cleaning up the chalet at 9am on Sunday and meeting Dasha's parents. We then went home and are now all safe. This is a general overview. There are some important conversations which we had to be posted, but I'll leave this to someone else. If missed out any important details please feel free to correct me.

 urlLink What is the size of a new particle accelerator? I'm thinking of buying one.

 Sample conversation at the Ben/Vlad/Audrey apartment/lair/cave/mountain hideout... V: So, they swim in the reactor water? B: Yeah, so the salmon would be bred in the Tchernobyl coil-cooling water... V: And then the evil fish would rain radioactive caviar death on Europe! B: Bow to our giant cyborg fish overlords! V: It's the gamma radiation... B: Ack, gamma rays! Gamma rays! And this is table conversation, perfectly sober...

 Andrei, see it this way. This is a little something I like to think of whenever someone beats me at anything. Sure, he may be an asshole, and a dorky asshole shouldn't be able to beat you, and sure, he may win the tournament, but there's one thing you have to take into consideration, very seriously: he is most assuredly a virgin, and will probably be for the next 10 years of his life, until he hangs himself in his mother's basement. Seen from this angle, things look a whole lot better... BlackLeatherJacketPimp? BrownLeatherburgertrio? Those sound like class names from the Unreal engine...oooh, ooh, can I be BigFuckinDemonThatShootsMissilesFromHisFingerTips?

 Hey Mulanda. Yeah, the biochem chicks are special alright. Not as special as the Special Olimpics, but they got their own thing :) Anyway. I'm here, in University of Winnipeg in Winnipeg. It sucks. It's cold. The weather reminds me of my native city in Siberia. People are nice here. The university is full of all kinds of chicks, but I'm too busy with the tournament and I'm not in the mood for making friends. By the way, did I tell you: "I hate chess"? Well now I did. I just lost a game to some tapete de merde de tabarnak who is a small arrogant dork from Toronto with no friends and no social skills. He is an asshole, but that's enough. I may as well say that I'm an asshole, because I couldn't beat him. Now he is going to be the next champion. He is fuckn lucky!! He didn't beat anybody, people just lost to him. And now he played against all the top players and they lost to him, and he will most likely win the tourney now. Anyhow, I'm pissed, and at the same time I don't care. I just want to go back to Mtl and not to have anything to do with chess again. So far it caused me only trouble. Man, I still have 3 more games to play.

 one sec, BrownLeatherburgertrio, first of all my country's name is written C O N G O, secondly, the bio-chem chicks are too special to be with mechanical or electrical engineers who always have dark rusty hands at the end of the day and who never keep their promises.. they belong to science angels like me that alwalys look fresh and angelic at any time fo the day, so i guess my answer to your question is NOPE, go get girls elsewere....(BlackLeatherJacketPimp is a very artistic name, keep up the good work)

 Ho, Ho, Ho! Mr. Zagombe The BlackLeatherJacketPimp is back from Kongo! Well, thank you for the wishes. My wish would be that all those bio-chem chicks miraculously transfer to Electrical Engineering overnight. Can you arrange that, Mulanda?

 hey people, the King is back and wishes everyone in this chatroom (or @#!Blog) a happy and safe new year, may you all finally make wise decisions and succeed in life... HAPPY NEW YEAR

 Bullshit! I can't hear you!

 sir, yes, sir!

 http://english.pravda.ru/usa/2001/12/08/23232.html Read it.

 ... and make the South African Journal of Antarctic Research a compulsory and only allowable reading.

 Oh my... urlLink Vlad's evil twin has broken free again...better stuff him back into that cage in the cellar and feed him his fish heads...

 You see Vlad, I cannot tell what hapenned at Josee's house during your abcence. I really tried hard to remember, but I couldn't. Everybody got pissed drunk, including myself, which I regret to some extent. You know, the usual stuff. I don't know if I caused any dammage, but if I did, sorry Josee. Other than that, Happy New Year to everyone. I hope that the resolutions that you've made for yourselves will be realized. Andrei, I wish you to kick some ass in Winnipeg. So, may the new year start with a victory for you. Once again, Happy New Year people and love you all.

 Thank you Ben. You always dilute the thick solution of lameness here. Please, people, enough of that ultraphilosophical semi-instant double-messaging! Happy New Year, and have a great fuckin' time everyone. As for Dec 31, it was curious, the most interesting thing being all the hugging and french-kissing with complete strangers on the street. People seemed to have been freed from some kind of cage or something... Happy fuckin' St.Valentine's. Provided that's what they really feel, why not express their feelings every night of the year (girls that is)?! Other than that, I am eagerly waiting for first-hand accounts of what happened at Josee's place during my being absent consumming another bottle with some other people :). I know pretty much everything (I also sort of prevented another small incident from happening), but I don't want to follow the Simpson's philosophy and make people feel bad about themselves... Anyway, later you all. And remember who yo daddy is, motherfuckers.

 Andrei, about "Because every failure is a victory for someone else and vis-et-versa!", let me quote from a man high in my philosophical esteem, Homer Simpson: "To feel good about yourself, you have to make someone else feel bad, and I'm tired (add from my thoughts: "and fucking fed up") of making others feel good about themselves..." Who wants a piece of me, next motherfucker in my way gets it, that's my new year's resolution... But happy new year to all the non-motherfuckers!

 It's 8:27am January 1st 2002. I'm back at home packing my stuff for Winnipeg. Man, I guess I was the only one who was able to meet the first sunrize this year. Have a good sleep everyone. See you in a week. :))

 Alright, how about urlLink this ? Or maybe urlLink this ? (it says: "what's the holiday today?")

 Hey, Vlad, that pic of me and Mike isn't exactly accurate...care to replace the beer with vodka or JD? And you just wait til I find a picture of a giraffe, jerkoff!

 come on, Mulanda, I just thought it would suit your nickname (the Lion Pimp, that is :). "As for the main topic at hand", there is something I have to tell you about Santa, my friend...

 hey!! i don't know whether that was a joke or simply a reflection of your intellect but i need an explanation for that ridiculous picture Vlad... As for the main topic at hand, here is my take: African elite athletes are rarely involved in doping and guess what: they are winners....To say that all countries do it but only a few are targetted makes me sick...I have never been in Russia, but i don't believe that the government puts pressure on the athletes, and even if they do is it not the athlete's responsibility to say no !!! The IOC has to do some restructuring i agree but i think it starts with the athletes first, most of them are just a bunch of losers in search of endorsement deals...

 Crap. Everything I was typing just dissapeared!:( No enlightment for you today

 On a lighter note: urlLink Boris (this picture has not been altered), urlLink Mulanda , urlLink Ben and Mike , urlLink Faisal urlLink Our neighbor urlLink SUPERFLY! urlLink hm... urlLink aww . .

 See, Fais, I think you're missing the big picture. Athletes are slaves. It is the case with ANY country's team. In most sports there is no discussion whether to use or not to use doping. Everybody does it: US, Russia, Norway - every fucking athlete is on dope, largely because they have no choice. It's just a matter of how to do it and not get caught. I think it's not enough to just target athletes. You're going to ruin people's lives for nothing. The whole system needs change. What IOC should do is to find a way to penalize the people responsible for pressuring athletes to use doping (although I can't immediatelly see a way to do that).

 Vlad is very much right. It is possible that the drug has worn out. Just a like a flintstone vitamins that people take. Its durability in body does not exist for a long time. If you test the athlete after the race, the "leftovers' will show up as normal body enzymes, and hence will escape the eyes of testers. testing should be done anytime whenever is wished. Screw their psychological pain, its their fault!! Its like catching a murderer shooting a kid, and not wanting to arrest him in his marriage. Damn it, its his fault. Testing has to be done much more often, and the science of detection has to surpass the science of enhancement, though it is unlikely . I mean, we did invent the bulletproof jacket after the gun. and the armor after the sword. So yes, should we sympathize for the athlete if she or he is caught with drugs? Hell no! Make them pay, they knew the rules. enhancement drugs are supported by people who are too lazy to practice and sweat hard, or by people who cant get results even if they try. Well, too bad, try thumb wrestling instead. thats all i got to say now.

 I don't agree, i think the whole principle of "boosting drugs" and blood doping is based on increasing an individual's hematocrit which is the percentage of red cells in the blood..Therefore the number of red blood cells will not dramatically decrease until a few days after the race, It therefore does not really matter whether one takes the test before or after the race...the drug is no supernatural power that will simply evaporate at the end of the race.

 Disagreed. In such race as 50K, just to take samples after the finish is not enough. The effect of the drug wears out during the race. After a few hours of extreme physical strain the athlete's blood might not contain the substance which might have given him a considerable boost in the beginning. Correct me if I'm wrong, Faisal.

 As for when is the best time to take doping. It should be taken in advance way before the competition and after, as soon as you're finished. That's how Sports Canada is going to test you if you are competing in national events. As soon as you're done they ask you to go with them, and then they watch you peeing to make sure the sample is yours :) I think taking dope control after a race or a match is done is enough, really. You are evil Vlad, psychological pain and stuff sound sick :)

 I'll only care about the olympics when they legalize performance drugs (as well as recreational), and why not, in the near future, grafted muscle and tissue or cyborg implants? Either way, my not caring much for the olympics saves me from a month or two of boring debate about "fairness" when all people are really doing is backing up their favorites (oh, my, he was the best, it must be foul play if someone else was better!)...Wake me up when the olympics are somewhat like Rollerball (the old movie from the 80's, the new one sucks...), or when they introduce "Chainsaw Death-Match" as an event... Mmh, talk about olympics, cool quote from urlLink Something Awful , about the future of the olympics: "2012 - Scandal rocks the Special Olympics when it is revealed there never ever was a Mount Special Olympus. The contestants are then rounded up like cattle and never seen or heard from again." Let it be, people, let it be...

 It makes perfect sense to take samples as late as possible , so the skiers don't have time to get onto something after the check-up. It would make even more sense to check the athletes 10 minutes before the start and then take them out during the race, thus inflicting as much psychological pain as possible. Man! Don't you think doping defeats the whole fucking point of the competition? Obvious, eh? In the case of Lazutina, she is not the one to blame. There was a tremendous pressure from the gouvernment and the president particularly to bring Russia to the first spot no matter what. The athletes had no choice whatsoever. They had to do whatever they were told to. It's not about sport anymore. It has never been, in case you didn't know. Last time it was about sport and genuine fitness, was back a few thousand years ago in Greece. Today, if you want to see fair competition and pure excitement, go watch my younger brother play water-polo at Claude Robillard.

 Why cool me down? What I didn't like is the fact that doping control must have been organized pretty sloppy. Getting results 15 minutes before the start ? This is wierd. Why did they need to wait so long. Poorly organized (which is strange, this is not some stupid regional contest) doping control just harmed teammates who were tested negative. It has nothing to do with justice or anything like that. I'm pretty sure that just about everyone uses some kind of doping in competitions of such level. At least in sports requiring inhuman efforts, like 50k race or weightlifting. Just wait till genetic dopes will become available, and see how suddenly all world records will be improving.

 yup, im trying to prove that if x=(a to power x +b)/n, then God exists.

 hey Fais, u sound like you're trying to prove something to someone :)).

 injustice, right? oh my sweet urlLink Lazutina why oh why

 urlLink The scandal continues. Log on to nytimes.com for complete details. Roman, here's some stuff for you to cool down a little: urlLink one , urlLink two .

 cutting onions actually "hey Fais, I have a funny feeling that you have your own blog. maybe not a blog, but some place that you write in. a very funny feeling... :)" (what u talking about vlad?) in ferro, constructive criticism please.

 tolja

 I just wanna know where the hell has Tygon got so much in-depth knowledge about international class judging and analysis of whole countries. At home peeling potatoes ?

 hey Fais, I have a funny feeling that you have your own blog. maybe not a blog, but some place that you write in. a very funny feeling... :)

 oh my lord. Fais, watch out for the avalanche :) i sense a snow storm here.... :) Last night we watched Russia loose to US in ice hockey in the Engineering common room at McGill. What I found astounding was the strong support for the Russian team among the Canadian students. To the absolute surprize and bitter disappointment of the few Americans in the room, everybody went "BOOOOO!!!!" when the American team rolled out to the ice and "GO MOTHER RUSSIA!!!" when the Russians did. :) Goh, Canaduh!!!

 Holy flaming balls of Jesus! That's more like 42 cents if you ask me...

 As the long tradition of the Olympics in the cold version was coming to Salt Lake City, everybody silently foresaw history in happening. There were a number of controversies that sparked word fights. one side blaming the other of setup. Let us then stop there and rewind our story. The Winter Olympics is a fairly new tradition. Can anyone tell me why? Well, throughout the long history of summer Olympics, the most successful teams in the summer Olympics were hardly the Europeans, they were only North Americans, few Asians, Africans and some South Americans. The Winter Olympics itself was built to show a country's performance through the sports it exceled in all by winning and having the Olympics seal branded.Not to mention, that most of the industrialised countries are winter nations. It was much better than it being ridiculised infront of other countries at the traditional games. The Winter Olympics was a little arena for the countries who couldnt despite all, ever get medals in the regular Olympics because they were always tormented by blistering cold and not enough money for their athletes to train in the adequate environment. And let's face it, the summer Olympics are much more exciting than the though spectacular Winter cousin. Then now back to the controversies at hand. First, my impartiality is justified, for my country, bangladesh, participates in neither Olympics, because it costs the country's gross revenue to purchase a jersey. That said, then this is my hand , as sport lover and an Olympics admirer. Hand 1: If it is new to anyone that this is the first judging controversy in skating, then may they keep silent and mumble to their own satisfaction. European judges have already been reprimanded in the past for siding with the skater's nationality. Let's face it, you dont want any country to win a sport that was made for you to win in. Then why was the false and blatently apparently misjusdging never taken to a higher level? The location is the answer. While most events occur in European cities because of sponsorship and ability, to accuse a country against itself is not highly recommended. Skaters have often complained about biased judging, but the ears were not interested. The Salt lake location was excellent. Excellent media coverage as well as the silent biased Amercians. Now there should be no controversy. Everyone should say, "finally!" It has finally happened. Justice has finally been rendered. The french judge admitted to partiality and spoke of other judges involved. Why is there than a controversy? To the eyes of all, the male Russian skater did go for a walk when he was supposed to jump! Irina slutlskaya did go weak in the knees and did look like she was pulling a Michael Jackson after her jump. Hand 2: The Russian team complains about a bad referee and demands retribution. And they still continue to do so. However, are they blind?? Women's team Canada won their gold medal match where they were 11 powerplays against them all thanks to the American referee!!! Until the games they had 10 in total. 11 in one game!! But they won! Because they played superbly well. Maybe if they would have played as the female team they wouldnt complain. To say that the referee was the cause of their loss is wrong. The Canadian female hockey team is proof of so. Hand 3: The final reason for Russia complaining is that it does not feel comfortable being ranked low in an event in which they have invested a lot of time and money. Russia is classed as either the first or second country in medal standings for the last Winter Olympics all the way from the beginning. Russia realizes that they might have not done well as they had expected and therefore, refuses to believe that their athletes might have underperformed. Therefore, they rely on the memories of the cold war days and bring them up saying to everybody that the whole world is against them. God knows what would happen to a non-Russian winner chess player in Russia. Watch out Mulanda. Last hand: The only controversy I am angry about is the following. The short track speed skating should not have gone to the American. Korea rightfully won it. There is investigation going on. I will be sincerely pissed if the Korean is not given is his gold. So last points? 1) Americans side with Canadians as long as it is fight against Russians. 2) Finally judging partialities have been uncovered. 3) Russians always think that when nothing goes their way, it means that the West is against them. In cases, it occasionally is true. 4)Russians have hard time admitting failure. Blaming is easier. 5)Canadians are the little bastards, laughing behind Americans watching them duke out against Russians. 6)I am hungry My two cents. Tygon.

 my olympics two cents soon.

 Hey Mulanda! Yeah, the spring break is just around the corner. The midterms are over. For now. I got two more right after the break. Just had my circuits test - a royal screwup. I got negative capacitances, real-domain reactances and shit like that. So much for slacking off. It's disgusting. But I'm happy it's over. Anyone up for a drink or two tonight? Anyone up for a nine-day 9am-12am studying marathon with me? How's everyone anyway. Concordia dudes, congrats on the end of the break! Hope you had fun; now it's our turn :)). One more thing. I went to the Concordia computer store a couple of days ago and found that it rocks. Imagine: they actually sell customized desktops, the ones for which you can order the components YOU want - a truly remarkable thing unseen at McGill.

 hey people, how is everyone doing?!! i hope the mcgill people are as excited as I am about next week: NO SCHOOL.. .. c'mon admit it Vlad, u can't wait to practice your dancing moves....i hear they are pretty EXCITING...

 take it easy roman

 I just got off the PC when I've heard on the news that our skiiers are disqualified! That's outrageous. U.S.A sucks. Favoriteesm is all over the Olympics.

 Congrats! Why idiot anyway?

 Allright...... I won the intervarsity bronze medal, hurrah.... I also feel like and idiot after this, somehow.

 urlLink Heh, look who I cloned.

 urlLink I cloned my cat.

 It's easy, about the medal thing, when everyone acts like a retard, they should just say "Everyone's a winner" and take them to McDonald's...

 To all you single desperate mothafuckas: urlLink what women want . Enjoy.

 you didn't get it, Roman, did you? That was supposed to be a joke, you know. J-O-K-E. Personally, I think Canadians won. It's just funny to observe all the controversy, considering the fact that the result is unlikely to change.

 I just wanted to say about a word about the poor canadian team. I don't think anyone gets robbed anyway. The judging call is a judging call, and that's just too bad if it's not in your favor. Anyway, appeals to the IOC and stuff looks pathetic. And where did u get this thing about 50 medals...newspapers? It does't even seem that medal count has hit 50 medals in total yet. Peace

 hahaha :)) no fee Chen Lee

 Thanks, Ben. (I just noticed :)

 He kiss she, she kiss he. He play with she, she play with he, I play with me... Vat ze hell?! :)))

 I'm a drunk slut, do I get a beer? P.S. Vlad, that pic of Vanier was kinda boring, so I photoshopped Ultraman into it...hope you won't mind...

 Here is an interesting story. Just before I want to warn you that the following piece of writting is based on a real life experience. So... There was he as well as there was she. They knew each other for a long time and have been together in a variety of situations (hmm). After some serious obstacle came across between them, they found themselves separated physically and mentally as well. Time went on and communication between those individuals became easy again. So on one of these days he and she met together and finally did "it". What hapenned after, so far is undetremined and God knows when was the next time they came across each other again. The only thing is that he still can't believe what hapenned and is concerned with a couple of thoughts, yet he feels that it was one the best circumstances in which he's been with her. "WHAT THE HELL? " P.S. Vlad, I'm not sure if this story qualifies for the contest.

 So, Audrey, if I understand correctly, you're saying you need a hug? Why do you people all take yourselves so seriously? Capitalists are productive, all this mental garbage we're dumping on the page sure as hell isn't, and that's the whole fucking point... Peace out, man!

 Hey Audrey baby!!!!!! How you've been! Long time no see! I urlLink got something for you! " Step on someone to feel higher? " Hell, YEAH! This place is not meant to be "productive". Bitching is what it's for. You know, we get enough of the stupid productivity at school. This page is all about feeding the ego. Mind you, it ain't no useless rambling. I would call it a satirically-offensive INTELLECTUAL prose. :))) It's not real life. It's like the complex variables: there's the real part, and there is the imaginary one... It just so happens that every now and then people confuse the domains and take their existenz here a little too seriously. But it's ok, I guess. The above, of course, does not relate to routine news, jokes and stuff.. What's up with the rest of the crowd? Wajdi, Faisal, Mulanda, Jeka, Russo etc... how's life everybody?

 This is one of the reason I do not post; for fear of being criticised. I am not saying I am against criticism and its virtue of stimulating the brain for corrections or quest of ideas. But rather that you should show a little less pride in your comments which are, from what I have seen for the past year, purposly Mean ,or very presumptuous. This is pure egotism: Crush the other's argument, crush his ideas...might as well just crush him!!!! Yeah that's it...crushhhhh him!!! sweeeeet! Makes me feel goooood! Who ya daday!! Non mais t's�!! C'est quoi la l'affaire. Step on someone to feel higher? Very "Productive!" : " Congradulations you have won gold medals for best interpretation of: a capitalist "

 Chill, people! Anyone need a hug?

 Offence taken, Andrei. I hope you know that coming down to physical remarks is the lowest form of an argument, the one that usually stays in pre-adolescence. Please, don't humilliate yourself like that anymore. At least not in my presence. It's all cool though. I realize you had to somehow try to recover your stained ego. :) It's not the extravagance that I despise. Hell, I love extravagance. It's not a matter of what you mysteriously called " pompessness " either. The thing is that I am severely allergic to any trace of melodramatic pretentiousness [or, simply speaking, obnoxious corniness]. As you might have found out lately, women rarely like that too. Oh, can I please smile now? Thank you :))))) Mind you, I can tolerate many things, but please, make it fucking funny at least! Learn to make a joke, pal. Otherwise, be damned and burn in the flames of my dictionary browsing skills!!! Amen. P.S. Do you really caress yourself with a hope that I could put my "self-esteem" on the line while making fun of you? Come on there, I could do better than that... :)

 As banal as Vlad with his usual pompessness, arrogance and self confidence. "Logical errors", huh, good job. You must have been bored or tired. Anyway, I knew that you never had the guts to accept something extravagant relative to random people; yet I wasn't aware that you could have such low self esteem while making up a conversation with a girl. To make you feel better, I should modify the that really tall friend though... very cute. to "an overgrown guy with a constant malcontent look on his face". (No offence) Learn to take a joke, pal. :) I didn't really want to shame you this way. As for Ben... Bouf! You're funny. P.S. I won't be able to read your lovely answers tomorrow because I'll be gone for the week-end, so you'll have lot's of time to make them amuzing :)). Take care,

 Mmmh, I can't resist this one...gotta join in...this is how it would've happened in Japan... Engineer: Hi, is this your friend? First girl: Yes, she doesn't speak much though... Second girl: Braaaaaains, must eat brains........... Engineer: Cute... First girl: *evil laugh* You can never hope to defeat my army of mindless undead drone cyborg chefs! *more evil laugh* Engineer: Witness the power of engineering! Super-Engineera-Tron-MegaBot, Phoenix Formation Science Ninja Happy Meal, go! ***they fight*** Second girl: *evil laugh* Hahahahahahaha! While you thought I was a mindless zombie, I trained to become a mindless zombie cyborg ninja whore! ***they fight*** Engineer: Fools! You cannot hope to defeat the supreme bridge-building righteousness contained in my super engineer crystal! Engineer-crystal, mega morph transform double shrink expand, super-ultra mode! ***everything gets bigger*** ***they fight*** Will engineer man-sama defeat the evil Psykology sisters? Or will he simply make up a story to pretend he did? Find out in the next episode of "Engineer Man: The series"... "When you make up a story, check for logical errors, Andrei" I say, when you make up a story, add robots, zombies, ninjas and giant mutated alien dinosaurs! Oh man, forgot the giant mutated alien dinosaurs...

 When you make up a story, check for logical errors, Andrei. ... this is my friend, ... , she is in psychology as well. Engineer (Looking indifferent but thinking: "nice ass"): Hey... Second girl (Blinking): Hello, nice to meet you. How could you see her ass while talking to her??? I guess she was really pleased to meet you while walking away and shakin' that aaass. Secondly, really, Andrei, have you ever seen yourself being indifferent in the presence of a girl, let alone a girl with a "nice ass"... :) Good story line though. - Hey! - Yeah, whatever, how are you. - Going to the engineering library to study again? - (non of your suckin business) Yeah, sort of, but we're leaving soon. - Is that your friend? - (good guess, duh) Aha. - Is she like... in psychology too? - Aha, but she has a boyfriend. -... -... -... - (walking away) who was that dork? ...looked at me as if he hasn't got any forever. Eewww. - ... I don't know... saw him a couple of times. He says he's in engineering, but I really don't know. I think he just comes to the engineering library to stalk on psychology girls. He has that really tall friend though... very cute. - Shit, why didn't you tell me?? I could have given him some kind of a piercing, full of sophistication and comprehension look or something... Yeah, Andrei, I AM THOOO THKEAD, iths unbelievable..! NO MORE THALTHA for THITH CUTE BLONDIE OVERTHEAR!!!

 "You are just following the fashon of critisizing Microsoft products. Besides, the age of 13 year speaks for itself. :)" I am not following any fashion...hell, I love Microsoft, and if you wanna know why I love them just go on their website and see the record number of security advisories released since XP came out... It's not pointless bitching, Microsoft has a reputation for releasing unfinished products (it took over 2 years for win98 to finally become a stable and viable system, through patches and service packs...), so you wouldn't catch me dead installing one of their products only months after it came out, as anyone with a shred of computer-knowledge will tell you... Still don't believe me? Why don't you just run a Yahoo search for "Windows XP hacking" and see what comes up...if you want your computer to have more holes than swiss cheese, go ahead and install it...I'll really like you for it... :)

 McGill. A hallway in an engineering building, around 6:00pm. Two joyful girls from psychology U2 accidentally bump into a dead-tired engineering student. He knows one of them and with the other he was exchanging meaningful glimpses for one semester in the library. Engineer: What's up?! First girl: Nothing much and you? (Giving him a piercing full of sophistication and comprehension look.) By the way this is my friend, ... , she is in psychology as well. Engineer (Looking indifferent but thinking: "nice ass"): Hey... Second girl (Blinking): Hello, nice to meet you. Engineer: I think I saw you in the engineering library last semester, or something. Second girl: Yes, we go there pretty often to study. It's quiet and comfortable there. Engineer (Thinking: "sure it is, just like at a market place") First girl (smiling with the same look as before): And we like to analyze the people there, it's so straightforward! Engineer: Thanks. (Turning to the second girl and blowing from nowhere) You know, I think you are a very sensitive person. You must be brilliant and you learn and understand everything very fast. Yet, you are very emotional and moody, that's why the guy you like is not sure about two of you, and mean while you flirt with cute men. But you have good taste. Second girl (widening her eyes and smiling): how did you know that?! Engineer (laughing): If I will tell you would kill me. Second girl (thinking: "he must of spied on me, oh!! or somebody told him about me, ah!! Who?!! He may be a maniac, but he is cute, ehh!"): please tell me, tell me, I promise I won't do anything to you. Engineer: Alright. Well, you see, it doesn't take a psychologist to figure out a person, but it takes an engineer to build a rocket. Second girl and first girl together (Angrily) How could you?! You are so old fashioned and full of prejudices! How dare you? (Thinking: "bastard! is he wearing Gap?) Engineer(laughing even more): Oh ladies, you are so cute when you are angry! But wrong answer! (Girls-staring at him) You should of said that it doesn't take a rocket to save someone's life or to make someone leave a depression, but knowledge of psychology does. Take care! Around 6:10pm, hallway McGill engineering building. Two psychology girls-blinking.

 You are just following the fashon of critisizing Microsoft products. Besides, the age of 13 year speaks for itself. :)

 "And running infinite loops just screws your computer if you don't have Windows XP..." ...should have been... And running windows XP just screws your computer if you don't have any common sense and actually install it... There, now that makes a lot more sense...and before anyone tries to defend Windows XP, why don't you try recovering from one of many major crashes it causes (or that will be caused by any 13 year-old who can run a port-scan...) without DOS to help you out...CMD.EXE, don't make me laugh, what the fuck happened to COMMAND.COM? And that was today's computer geek rant...

 Ye, ye, and another joint will do, right?! It's like peace... man, or what?! No! Life is beautifull and exciting! And running infinite loops just screws your computer if you don't have Windows XP or if you don't know how to press ctrl+alt+del. [(1+2)))^3??! :) Carpe diem! everybody. I don't know why, but it feels like within last three days I lived for at least a month! Latez!

 Waj, I know what you mean. Try screwing with infinite loops (like " while n>1 { n=[(((n!))!)!)]^n } " or something). Or, if you have 486, n=n++ will be enough :))))))). Fun, fun, fun!

 LOOK HERE. Concentrate. Do you see anything? Are you sure? Do you see your reflection. NO??? OK, then it's not a mirror. Good. Progress. Or, maybe it is? Perhaps, but it's a special kind of mirror. What's so special about it? It keeps your reflection long after you're gone. An ordinary mirror shows you what you want to see. This one also shows what you are... to everyone else but you. Think about it tonight. Peace. Power to the people.

 Oh, come on there. Midterms aren't that scary. They are 10% at most. Besides, we have the option of having 100% finals. So, chill everybody. University is a life experience. Let us make it a little less stressful for everyone. Sound hypocritical enough? Oh well, that's me and my melancholic indulgences into the euphoric nature of our existence. [courtesy of webster.com]

 Nice, my 1st midterm is february 13th. But I don't care(yeah right!). Anyways, I have a competition on Thursday and it's gonna last till Saturday night. All the European and North American hot-shot dancers are coming to Montreal and I'm planning to kick some serious ass there. But strangely enough, today while practicing I felt that there is lots of room for improvement in my dancing. Interesting, why is that? Oh well, whatever happens Thursday I'll try to stay satisfied with my result. Oops. Did I get carried away? (just trying to cheer myself up).

 it was a good week-end. Not productive at all, fun though. Sartuday night 6/49 dancing and Sunday skiing for 8$ for the lift and 12$ for all ski equipment at a mountain hiegher than St-Saveur and others of that sort. Yee. Now, chilling dead tired in a computer lab (if it is possible to chill here) waiting for 30 mins to pass so I would go to my dance practice. What else? Well, I'm just making you all jalous of my slacking off. Yet, I'm feeling that sufferings are near, because Feb. 14 is my first midterm! Yeeee.

 Heyya. Alright guys. Need to share smthng. I have decided to go study at the University of Melbourne, Australia next February. They say it's the best U over there, and if it works out financially, I'll be a happy camper next spring. Meantime, gotta bring up my hm... marks a little and buy a tan cream or whatever it's called. :)

 Hey guys, well its Sunday evening and im at Heathers house studying C++ (hey everyone..this is Heather...what's up?? how is university for everyone?..okey..wajdi wants computer back now..so BYE!!) Alright, im back. As I was saying, im here studying C++ trying to get a few of my programs to compile but apparantly one of my programs really did something to Visual Studio and now I have to reinstall it. I think it is because I kept on overshooting my arrays (for anyone who understands the tedious C++ language). Hey Vlad, not going with the girls was a stupid move, but an understandable one, and kudos on the Will Power to say no. If I were in your position I think I would of said no myself. Well, its time to go and look over my assembly notes with the time I have left before my beauty sleep. Good bye everyone and have a wonderful day at school tomorrow ;) l8er dudes

 Wajdi, baby. Nice to see you. (well actually to see from you). But this is not my point. Vlad, I got only two words for you. I mean if you have to study, it doesn't mean that your friends do. Imagine a jaccuzzy and five ladies around. Do you need professional help or something?

 According to director Graham Bell, "the new exhibit will describe how some of the most dramatic events in Earth history have occurred in or near Quebec &ndash; among them, the emergence of the first land plants, the first amphibians and their ancestors, and the first true land animals." Most of these were discoveries by McGill scientists http://www.mcgill.ca/releases/2002/january/redpath/ Cool stuff heh?!

 Shit man! You didn't tell us the entire story!! Jis!! Oh well. :) Sup Waj! You should come visit us at the Mac, it's pretty fun around here. (I mean not as fun as slucking offf in a jacuzzy with *five ladies, but some people have to study, you know, oh oh oh). As for other stuff, well, I have a slight feeling that the midterms are coming...

 Hurray! Waj is back! Man, long time no see. By the way... I have a huge favor to ask you :). Not a big deal, but it's very delicate. I'll email you. What can I say? Life at the Mac is good. I have 5 courses, and I am enjoying most of them, especially Java. Life on my own is excellent. Jack Daniels is my best friend, well, actually it's his other incarnations, like Absinth and Moskovskaya. Other news. I was invited by a friend of mine to the restaurant tonight. But then she called and offered to go to a chalet with jakuzi (sp?), sauna and swimming pool along with her friends and any three people I would invite with me. I cancelled. Why? Need to study man. Sorry guys, right now you could be slacking off in the sauna with at least five girls (hm... ladies actually), but I had to cancel. I don't think any one of you would go anyway... :)

 Hey guys, Its been a long time, but im back!!!!!!! :) How is everyone doing.....How's life at the Big Mac...Im having fun here in Concordia with the crazy C++ teachers and weird assignments we get. I just got a new lab top, its sweeeeeeeet. So Vlad, hows life living on your on? is it all good? Well, my old computer crashed and I lost 3 years of work. Everything I have done in the past three years is lost because of a trojan that got into my computer. FUN FUN FUN!!!!!! The drive is fried and I am currently using a 540 meg drive on my P2 350....cant wait to get my new system, this half a gig of hardrive space is killing me, its no fun...I tried installing visual studio and the download stopped halfway....that is when I knew I was totally screwed. How is everyone else doing, you guys having fun? Sure hope so.....Remember, if you ever come across a problem you dont understand, always remember Mr. Jack Daniels is always there to lend a hand. After a few minutes with him, everything makes sense :) Alright guys, gotta fly, have labs to do, C++ assignments to destroy and tests to study for....l8er dudes :) -The WAJDI

 ... and also those who didn't get any tatoos or engaged in anal, oral and/or other inappropriate activities posessing the risk of alteration of the organic constituents of one's brain cells since last week. I, the undersigned, certify that I indeed have repeatedly lied and utilized the words "fuck off" in public during the past 1 (one) hours. I thus request an exemption from further questionning. :)

 I forgot to mention. The question applies to those who are sober and have been so since last week.

 Well, well, well. It is now officially 12:54; I've got myself a coffee jar and gracefully sat down in front of my beloved SyncMaster 755. As much as I despise the word "official"... I am now an official... we are now... anyways, you get the point. As for the brain cells, let us clearly define an official battlefield with officially proclaimed boundaries. Because our official finals session is just around the corner, and you will (well... I will) need every single one of those mathematically altered cells. I don't know about that person being a liar or not, but when I say "I am a liar", I usually do it before I actually lie. People don't believe me and think I'm the honestest person alive, which prepares their innocent comprehension apparatus to embrace my next point. I usually top that off with some simple truth, like "the sky is blue", just in case.

 How about something to waste brain cells on? Have too much anyways What is this person really saying. "I am a liar" Is he lying or not?

 O.K. Just to break the silence. Today is exactly 6 years that I live in Canada. Feels just like yesterday. Happy now?

 yes in ferro, brothers are genetically different but by a very small percentage less than 0.1 though. much less. In some cases, mutation of one gene is good enough to be a goner. the monkey and human are 97 % genetically identical. Says a lot, doesnt it. Among humans the differences are very minute. As i said, the differences are in the lower decimals. Things that seem so different to us such as colour or height and so forth are actually very little details. Very ..VERY.....little details. You have to know that organisms that perform same bodily functions and operations are almost genetically identical. I say almost because the only genetically identical organism to a human is a clone of himself or his identical twin.

 a question to tygon and mulanda how big is the diffence in genome in brothers? I've read somewhere that mutation in more than 3 genes can be mortal for an embryo, or smth like that. and that difference between monkey and human is such and such(I don't remember the number, but it's huge). I just wanna know how big difference is among humans themselves. anyone has a clue? (and don't complain about my ignorance, and lack of proper terms, etc..)

There is something eye-opening in waking up on Saturday with a slight headache, someone's hand on your.. shoulder, empty bottle of conjac on the desk and Depeche Mode's "Sister of Nights" looping in your stereo. It's a good thing the brain has this curious self-defence mechanism that prevents you from recalling everything at once.

 pig's balls sucks. global warming swallows. long live alcohol.

 Wwwait a sec. I mean, I realize my pitcher looks kinda transparent, but I still can't see the connection between pig's balls transplantation and the danger of global warming. Aside: one of Russian interpretations of misantropic sounds like this: chelovekonenavistnicheskii (������������������������ in Windows Cyrillic encoding), if that helps illustrate my point at all.

 Fee Fi Fo urlLink Fum

 just to break the silence

 Yeah, I'm not sure if Bhatia is still in a coma, but while I was at Vanier, I heard that he was, earlier this spring, due to a car accident. As to Mr. Kayembe, man you should have taken an English elective :P. By the way, is it true that Kato is going skydiving soon? off topic: Life is like a glass of wine. The more you drink from it, the sweeter it gets. Yet, when you are just about to finish, you realize that there is no refil, and you are just not drunk enough... :)

 Drama day #5: i think i finally assured my first A of this dreadful semester....my Stats elective payed off nicely... Mosvicth, i suggest you take a little bit of Lion Simba, it should cool you off nicely.

 Bhatia's in a coma? really? ur kiddin right?

 Morning, d00des. How's life. I guess i finally managed to cut back on internet a bit, eh Who do you think will win the WC in hockey this year? the website is www.ihwc.net, if u wanna check the scores. Cya.

 I do not fuckin get it!! My last final that I studed my ass off for 5 days was a the stupidest crap ever. Written by a fuckn French dunkey who can't teach for shit, it was freackin impossible to understand what the fuck was he asking for!! All my exams are over and (along with my first university year), and I'm damn pissed because some ass-hole, i.e. piece-of-little horses kaka, couldn't pose the questions properly and because half of the material was not part of what was tought in class, and eventhough we all learned it anyways knowing the dumb-short-dicked-egghead the teacher is, the exam was not even half consistent with the vocabulary used in the class slides and class notes. "You could find this vocabulary in some reference books upon the subject" the teacher told me after class smiling. Greasy-pussy, do I need to read some more reference books along with my 4 course books already, for an "A Class" as it always used to be called?? Anyway, fuck the dork. If he gets hit by a car and falls into a coma I'll thank the driver who ran over him. And I mean it. (Just as much as I mean it for Bhatia who was hit by a car early this spring and is still in a coma). Take care people, and have a good ending of the examination period and a great summer! ~~Peace~~

 Hellow fellas. A few new impressions from VladsterMeister. I was browsing through the stacks at Chapters on Ste.Catherine the other day and ran into urlLink this book called " Taxes for Canadians for Dummies. " Hmm... da. Cool. Also, chapter 2 (p.24) of the pocket manual I am currently reading ("Coping with Excessive Free Time After Finals: form A to Z") says: "The three most important words in time-wasting business are: Movies, Movies, Movies." Well, Audrey and I watched "Changing Lanes" last night. Truly amazing. The best movie I've seen in a long time. This morning, Audrey (directly), Billy Joe, Salsa-man and I (indirectly) encountered the health emergency system. It's not pretty. Everything is cool now, Audrey is sleeping home. In other breaking news, yours truly is starting working on Monday. Ew. From now on, all the air disasters involving Boeing 737's air pressure gauges and altimeters can be legitimatelly blamed on VladsterMeister. Latez doodes.

 Yeah, I clearly remeber blowing that guy into pieces in my journal entry (for which I, of course, got 10/10 and was called a "star pupil" by the teacher thatnkyouverymuch). In the story, it was just a stoopid american highschool kid who was unsatisfied with the way he was taught physics. I think it's not true that it was Bohr. Mulanda, dude, you're a fucking looser... just like the rest of us here at McGill being fucked up the ass...

 Dude?? Anal Chem??? Wow that must hurt, figuratively speaking , of course.

 Hey Mu!! Failing Anal Chem class.... That's sounds really bad! I mean failing, and not just failing, but a Chem class, and not just a Chem class, but an ANAL Chem class. Jis! And that matata mingi sana ... Is that what lions roar out when they're out of lubricant? (Just kidding) :) By the way, do you remember our last English course together? (Sure you do). So the story about a student who showed to his phisics teacher ten different ways of measuring building's hight with a barometer and none of the ways was the one the teacher wanted to hear. Guess what? Apparently, that student was NILS BOHR!!!!!!!! (I heard about this today and not sure for it's trustworthiness, but I'll check it later.)

 hey fellow bloggers, A BIG tragedy occured today, oh no! I am not talking about some guy blowing himself up or Andrei sniffing you know what, no.no., this is a lot bigger: I think I Failed my Anal Chem class.....the LionKing has been slaughtered.... matata mingi sana.

 Relaxing Russian SuperFly! :) http://www.mult.ru/

 Information richnesss is the potential information-carrying capacity of a communication medium . Together with institutionalized socialization and unbriddled inqusitiveness . How can people actually teach this in schools? Makes me wanna puke.

 words of encouragement from the wise one: hakuna matata

 Johnny, the word you're talking about is "buff" . Secondly, I never alter anybody's posts. On a lighter note, I am done. The last test was actually not bad at all. I think I got at least a B+. It's a good thing I didn't defer it. To sum up, I am now looking at one or two A's, two C's and a B. Bad, but could be worse. I've had waay too much life this semester. Good luck dudes. When you write those tests, just think of me relaxing somewhere in a park reading a second edition of "Coping with Excessive Free Time After Finals: form A to Z".

 hey Andrei, i hope you did not write any Genetics exam today, coz it was hard, i don't recall having ever taken such a hard exam in this 'dump'.....oops!....i am too depressed, can anyone revive the LionKing with words of encouragement?! i still have three more exams to go before i can get start "sporulating" again.

 Funny, I can't remeber my writing of some setences in my last blog... I must have been ...hmmm... tired? Or did some admin added then to my post? Anyway, who cares. Ah, yeah, 'bouf' is a French word that means 'whatever' or in Russian: 'da nu'. It's sort of slang so it's not found in some dictionaries.

 okkeya Ladies and gentss, you are about to not witness the miracle of unparalleled, inhuman effort leading to the ultimate victory of all good and world peace. What you ARE to witness, however, within the next 4 hours are: hope, confusion, effort, failure, desperation, denial, effort, hope, "time up", tears. Have a good one everyone, I am out for a few days. Drinkin' time.

 ... still alive mo&&$%#^@&th#!&%$!((*^$@^^king *&b%*%it is killing my brain. More Kenyan coffee and a Wonderbar . Or is it wonderbra? They should write bigger letters on those chocolate bras... bars. I'd go for a chocolate bra any time... Applied Linear AlgeBRA. Oh mine God, Bras all over the place. I think AlgeBRA would be a cool BRAnd name for a bra company in Algeria. Don't you think. Do they wear bras in Algeria? Hm... chocolate AlgeBRAs. Andrei, what's "bouf" anyway? It it one of the copyrighted words of yours? Sounds pretty fucking dumb, imsorry. need sleep

 Alrighty now!! Just celebrated the end of first four finals with a bunch of French friends in an amazing atmosphere, that was getting into a 'weed' stage as I left, decling an offer to sleep over with a hot blondy in my bed...(I'm not gay. bouf , you won't get it anyway, we're just friends). :) So now it's quite late and feels sweet. I'm actually thinking of going to Genetics test today; sit there for an hour, fill in all the circles on the answer sheet and leave, just to piss all the science students off. :) Oh well. Good night everyone and have fun on your remaning exams. :)

 One exam down, three more to go. Why does Concordia schedule exams on Saturday and so fucking late? Life is not fair is it. I also noticed an increase in the female population of the blog lately and most importantly blogger's anyversary has never been celebrated. All this together with the upcoming ending finals needs a certain amount of alcohol intake (after the finals). Don't you think?

 it's ok. you must've been tired. I am discovering so much interesting stuff about my courses! It's actually exciting... like this exponential matrix function... gives you all the explicit solutions to a system of differential equations simultaneously! Neat shit! Man, I have been missing so much while skipping those applied linear classes! I love math. Seriously. My Masters will either be in math or comp. sci. I have decided not to defer the test and bravely confront it tomorrow. The most important conclusion I can draw in the end of this largely unsuccessful for me academic year is that University is a full-time job. You need to stay here all day. Only then it will be both interesting and rewarding. Truism? Well, it wasn't so obvious to me :) I think I will kick some ass next year. Yeah sounds painfully familiar, but I do mean it.

 Tygon approaches his lab bench. Someone has left their previous material on the desk. The objects includes a scalpel, a probe and what appears to be a frog. Tygon rearranges his books and is prepared to set up his Southern Bloting experiment. Suddenly... -Wrrrrreebit. -ITS ALIVE!!!!!! KILL IT ! KILL IT! DIE YOU SLIMY FIEND !! REAP THE BENEFITS OF HELL, FOR YOUR TIME HAS COME!!!!! Tygon regains his composure, as he stares at his latest accomplishment. There seems to be a different arrangment of the internal organs of a frog. He questions himself on wether it is normal to find a frog's liver away from its body. There seems to be also an increased amount of blood. He concludes that as he calculates the amount which is scattered over his lab coat. He also tries to understand why the scalpel is in his hand, and its blade, half-broken, basks in the aqueous solution of the frog's intestine. Tygon finds himself in an awkward situation and investigates for answers. He inquires next door, and gets an ecology student, also known as a tree-hugger. He brings him to the scene and awaits answers. - OH FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!!!! NO!!!!!! SKIPPY!! WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU!!! WHERE'S YOUR.....OH MY ....*gurgles his vomit and spits it out*....your liver... He then proceeds to vomit and sob. After he regains his senses, he roars out. - WHO DID THIS??!!! WHAT THE ..... The hippy realizes that he is talking to an emptiness, for Tygon is far....far....away. As Tygon has reached the basement in his secret hiding place, he realizes two things. One, the experiment can wait. Two, the exams are destroying him.

 Wow, Bill, is this what I think it is? In any case, I'll be there for you (and not only you) at 12:09 PM tomorrow. Put the vodka in the freezer. NOTE: Bill, aka Josee, aka Joseita, owns a two-room hotel in the McGill ghetto, at which we incidentally (as opposed to accidentally) stay over now and then. The hotel offers free room and sometimes board, and sometimes even more than that.. Reservations are to be made by phone. According to the latest rumors, orgy requests are no longer considered. Bill went to Vanier, too. Repeatedly. Apparently, quite a few times. Yes, folks, it will be my last and hardest final tomorrow. I know you've all waited for it. I will be playing with myself in the Eng. library till it closes or I die (whatever cums first) and in the FDA comp. lab. for the rest of the night. Anyone wanna drop by and hang out? You're NOT very welcome... but bring loonies for coffee anyway. Tygon. What's up down there in the frog morgue?

 -yeah.....so.... Brad Pitt's my ex.... -oh yeah? Me it was Claudia Schiffer.... - ...Who wants to live in Hollywood anyway? -yeah... um....Hollywood sucks... lets just kiss. Josee's Hotel is currently offering vacancy and free vodka shooters! For more information please call. Oh and good luck on your exams everyone...:)

 Two more to go. I'm in the Eng. Lib on 5-th floor. My exam is at 2:00 to 5:00.

 need to get in touch with Andrei, dude.. I got one to go... and one for here. The one for here is likely to be a repeat. Ha Ha. I just want to get this shit over with. Seriously, guys, it's becoming too annoying. I can't even release stress properly: it just gets deposited somewhere and burns everything inside of me, leaving the outside intact. It's not fair. Nevermind. Two more days... to go.

 ......hey Vlad, i need to check into your stress clinic, i have got 2 exams down, four more to go..

 A leftist (read: communist bullcrap) party of the Russian parlament submitted a new motion for discussion. The motion suggests 1-3 years of imprisonment for engaging in male homosexual activities. Yes, you heard it right. Of course, it won't be passed, but the mere statement makes me spit in disgust. This is one of those times when, even though I'm straight, I'm glad I'm out of there. Mind you, a similar law had existed since 1930's and was abandoned in 1994. So, if you, by any chance, had male gay sex in Russia before 1994, you risked 3-5 years in prison. :) http://www.utro.ru/index2.shtml?2002042217113674291

 hello my fellow bloggers, my exam was a remake of the holocaust. No exageration present. However, I have come out with a high head, and for all you desperados out there, turmoiled by the finals, keep this in mind. What can not kill you, only makes you stronger.

 Heyyo. Tygon is probably having a breakdown right now. Bhahahhhaaahah! When I asked my math teacher if it were possible for me to cover most of the semester's material in 4 days, I saw a compassionate yet pessimistic spark light up his eyes: "Fucking freshmen; dummies they really do think they're geniuses to skip 90% of classes and still ace the final." Anyway, he sorta generally commented to me on approximately what would be on the test. Heh :) life is unfair isntit. LET THE MORTAL COMBAT BEGIN! IT HAS BEGUN!

 It is now one hour before my exam, and I refuse to continue studying. If I dont know it now, I wont know it later. My brain has reached its suction capacity. Breakdown of information to be held in about an hour. Proliferation of any exagerated consequences will result in drastic operations led in psychological miniturations. whatever that means.

 Good stuff Tygon. By the way, why the fuck is it 2:14am and I'm nither asleep nor studing for my final tomorrow? Dammit, I have never been as stressed and not being able to cope with it. Fuck, anyway, back to my bed desperately trying to get some sleep.

 Tygon takes a gun and fires one shot at point blank range towards the bolbing head of Loki. There is a thump and prompty queued by pool of blood.

 In any case, I have probably lost my academic virginity (failed my first course, that is).

 Funny. I learned more on the way out of the exam room.

 Well, I don't want to encourage the mood of desperation since it's the first day of examination period. However, well, just fuck it.

 I walked into the test room calculating how much I need to get an A. Now � am desperatly trying to guess if I passed the course.

 aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

 And let the fun begin. Just wanted to wish to all of you guys a HAPPY examination period (although, as we know, it cannot be happy).

 I say: UPRISING!

 We are slaves to the law so we may be free.

 Hey! Watch the spelling Mr. Zagombe!! It's Moskvitch !!!

 Hey guys, I want to wish everybody good luck for these exams, I know for some of you, this is just another lonely walk in the park(Moskovich) but for me it's CRUCIAL.....I am going to retreat in a cave.

 And it will... P.S. Do not ask why posting at this time.

 Show must go on!... :/

 I know. How unfortunate... Oh well, that's life.

 so I woke up with a cold this morning...hum...yeah it was REALLY cold last night...

 Hey TyGoN, thank you for that. It touched me on the raw (seriously). I think this is what our lives will be all about in a few years. It's hard to find balance between career/school and personal life. Lately, I have been leaning towards the opinion that it's an "either-or" situation. When I try to disprove it, I suck at both. Make your choice, gentlemen. And for God's sake, somebody, please prove me wrong.

 Freind of mine at the Jewish General invited me to a Friday Bash at McGill Thomson house. Had a good time. Had a conservation with a brunette, with the cutest face. She was 15 metres away on a third round table away with the lurking smile and , did i mention the cutest face. She crossed my eyes, devoured me by her stare and I felt helplessly weakened by her. You know, the little type with cute glasses, dark brown hair, and a nice white tone of skin. I watched her, and she tried to tell me something, was she signaling me to come over? or was she cracking her neck? she then, so I thought , cracked her neck again. But nobody cracks their neck again , not on the same side!!!! She then proceeded to excuse herself from her table, and come out of the room. That was my queue to go. However, my friend's friend jenny thought that it would be nice to talk to me about her research project, since she was sitting beside me. I itched almost to leave my chair, and meet the goddess of brunettes as ,I observed her waiting outside!!!! Damn shut up , Jenny!!! For the love of God, Jenny, shut up, I was thinking. i could not leave my chair, for she was with her research supervisor, the very reknowned Dr. Blaistak. My friendship was an insurance for my success. Leaving in front of him, as his student talked to me would be an insult. But the brunette was waiting. Throughout jenny's babbling, I once noticed that the brunette disappeared. She went to the bathroom, I guessed. She then came out, stared at me, waved her arms, shrugged her arms and returned into the room, went to her table, took her jacket, told everyone , she had to leave, left the room, and left Thomson house. I remained in awe. And Jenny ended saying, "..so that's why Beta mercaptoethanol is essential for blotting, especially after using SDS. " i answered, that's nice Jenny, thats nice. Its weird, I had an enitre conversation with the brunette , but we never spoke a word. As I sipped my Guiness while walking down MetCalfe, I just hoped I was smarter.

 Technically, the blog exists since March 25. No rave for me. Studying.

 Just one little correction. The anyversary is on March 30th. Anybody's up for a rave night at the dance school to celebrate it? I think Sarah would like it.

 check email

 ok I am here!!

 Oh my god, Bibi. Last night, I was rehearsing for a persuasive speech to decline your kind invitation. Listen, people; I am really dying. There is so much work, you won't buh-lieve. My finals add up for a total of 330%. I am hopelessly behind in Linear, JAVA and Measurements. Also, my account statement shows a highly negative balance. Besides, when did I manage to become so important? There are like... 956257 of you people. You won't even notice my not being there. Who's the nice woman anyway?

 A very nice woman is giving you, Vlad, the opportunity of using her vehicle for TONIGHT! Will you please accept, so we can all enjoy the wonderful world of maple syrup! I understand you have a lot of work, but she wants you to drive it...no one else!

 I say keep the name :)

 Holly shit, Johnny! How the fuck could I miss it? It was March 25! This place is one year old! You may now start feeling special and proud to be an integral part of this elite congregation of high-spirited thinkers and well-spoken womanizers! By the way, I think there are no current Vanier students here anymore... Anyone for a name change before the new era begins?

 Yes... too much brain drain.. :) Good evening gang of lazy procrastinators, are there any Drill Sergeants, private Snowballs or Cowboys? Who do we have here?! Private Jokers?? Choke your self students! Get on your knees and choke your selves studing, so I can hear you! I don't want to see anymore drains around here! Anykind of drains, students! True, I am a liar. I knew that a long time ago. Yet, I apprehend it vividly nowadays. Man! Happy One Year anniversary to this place!! It passed a few days ago, I believe!

 Some interesting news. Russian ministry of education deems there are too many people in Russia with a university degree. They are going to try to reduce the number of universities and university students in the future. I guess that should also take care of the brain drain :). http://www.5ballov.ru/news/edu_rus/index.shtml?2002/04/02/16423

 I always knew this place was insane. Anyway, how are you people? Today is a very special day. I am at school before afternoon. School actually feels good in the morning - everyone should try and visit it one day. There's all those poli sci girls "dropping by" the engineering building to "grab" a "coffee" and stuff... Hm, yeah. On the other hand, it's sort of nice not to be single again. Again, heh? It's been a while :). Think about it, gentlemen: the summer begins in 3 weeks. 3 weeks of sleepless crazy geekyness, and we're free like birds. I foresee a magnificent summer. Lot's of camping and biking. Not that anyone of us will actually do that, but it would be nice to, wouldn't it? I shall now leave you suffering in your pre-finals misery. Stoke's Theorem help us all..

 So, fuck my dick, what's up people, fuck my dick?

 Anybody need advice on how to behave on a job interview? Check it out http://www.sendthefun.com/interviews/

 Yeah. I don't like that.

 exams r coming, eh

 good morning gentlemen. Fais, what did you mean anyway? P.S. I can't believe you actually posted at 8 AM on a holiday :). Don't you bio people ever sleep?

 done

 How old are you now, eleven?!!!!....congrats kid, now I can truly call you my boy.

 Invitation to a Party, Saturday, June 1st at 7:00pm Located at 279 Woodland, Verdun (intersection of Wellington and Woodland) The reason for this party is my birthday that passed on May 24.

 What about the same problem as A student is provided with three 2-ohm resistors. How many different total resistances can be produced if all three of the resistors are used in a circuit? but with n resistors? (make them also 1-Ohm each for simplicity) I spent 2 weeks working on it and couldn't get it ... any clues ? I am reading a book on Quantum Mechanics now... Amazing... Linear Algebra all over again but really cool....

 Now, the second part of the story... I feel kinda tired and exauhasted so I'll get straight to the point. There was a MILF travelling with us with her husband and little Stiffler, yet to become Mister :). I'll drop the details of this encounter and just say that most of the time during the tournament on Sunday and Monday I spent with the sister of the one of the player's (the 24 yr. old) TALKING. I also was training and yelling at my student when I didn't like his games, as well as training other kids. In the evenings I was riding around the city with the newly acquainted Noufy friends. And one of them was... hmmm... anyway... nice. We've excanged e-mails and phone numbers. Besides that we didn't do much. There was also the nationals for the Syncro sweeming for juniors, so that was quite cool too (to watch). To conclude, my student finished 3rd, the team got 2nd (Ontario first) and the worst thing was that Ontario beat Quebec's record for team score of 96/108 by 97/108. That sucks. The record was standing since the 70's. :( But in general, I'm pleased with my trip. Besides, the chick that I liked is coming to Montreal later on this summer and what's more, is that her dad has a very important position at a university there in the faculty of medicine. That's it, I'm out, if you need any more details, well, too bad :). But as bad as it may sound, I'm back to being myself at the tournaments as I have been long time ago :)

 Mulanda: there are four possibile total resistances: 6, 3, 2/3 and 4/5 Ohms. OK, Fais, I get your argument. To tell the truth, I didn't read Tolkien. I watched the movie, and it didn't have enough of an impact upon me to make me do so. I think it sucked, except for the animations and music. Now, someone who had read the book might have had an entirely different impression. What I truly despise is people reading certain books as a trend. I guess you don't see it this way. And I can see how you may see it. In any case, I don't like fairy tales. :)

 @lrighty, I'm back. Yes! I was an interesting experience. Ok, (sorry I'm not entering the subjects of conversation right away, but I'll answer to Mulanda: "I have no clue"). So, we had to make a stop in Halifax on both, way back and to New Foundland. The Planes were pretty old and rusty (B-146, agrh, and some airbus which was ok). The weather was colder than in MTL, and we decided upon our arrival to go whale watching :). The taxi to some bay was 20$/each for 6 people and 20$/each for the boat; well, I had to pay for my student, from the money his dad gave me, but it was worth it. The entire boat just for 10 chess players with a beautiful deck and the Titanic song on repeat was marvelous. Our sight didn't catch any whales, however, we spotted an iceberg of a size of a shopping mall (very impressive), saw the Bird Island and tonns of birds of various kinds, wow. Anyway, we sailed in the ocean for 2.5 hours and it was the experience of my trip. (Thank god the Titanic song was soon replaced by New Foundland music). The next day my student and I slept in, so the noon city tour busses were right on time. The bus tour was also a lot of fun, especially because a seat for me was always reserved near a Ukranian-Georgian Hotty, who, as I found out later that evening, was 24 and two years into the marriage (damn). So during the bus tour we went to the most eastern point of Canada, to the first "debarcation" point of the French explorers, some other historic sites and a BBQ. The BBQ was of a Nouffy style with a band of 8 chubby chicks playing Irish songs. A friend of mine and I spent most of the time eating and deciding which of the musicians was the least worst choice to pass an evening with. Finally, we both got invited to a party at one of their houses, and truly, they are very nice people with some VERY nice friends :P. Yet, I had to check on my student every hour or so, because I left him alone to sleep in our room in the Univetsity residence, where all the chess players were staying. Now, I'm too tired to continue typing, so the rest of the story will be up tomorrow.

 A student is provided with three 2-ohm resistors. How many different total resistances can be produced if all three of the resistors are used in a circuit?

 Well Vlad, let's have a talk. Tolkien wrote his books far before my parents were born. His books were considered as gems shortly after their publication. And on then very few people have read it. Recently the movie came out and there has been a sudden surge of popularity with his books. I read his books when I was 12. And I was flabbergasted by Tolkien's magnificent imagination. Imagine my sudden joy when i learned that a movie was coming out. Might I add as well that I felt the same joy when I learned that there was a movie for Macbeth as well. I enjoyed both books and movies with glee. However, a certain group of people have now dubbed Tolkien as 'farfelu" much like harry Potter. I have to mention the following; With gaining popularity, a sudden masterpiece decreases in value towards people of "dispopular" taste. . Now that almost every living 2 eyed human has read Tolkien, do I like his books less than I did before? No. I just have an added subject to my social conversation. Fermat's Enigma is another of my favourite books. I don't think I am allowed to let anyone say that the book will be "farfelu" as well just as soon as everyone has devoured it.

 Shameless, stupid, disgusting urlLink nonsense .

 Hey there yo. Ivan, tell us exactly what happened. Who is the chinese guy? Your boss? Besides, that's pretty cool shit you've got there on your website... But why Igor? 'cause we have one Igor here on the team, and I'm not sure if you would want him to be your imaginary friend... :) Also, those ads are pretty annoying. I know a very reliable, free, no-ads hosting. But it's in Russian. I can get you an FTP username and password if you want. (it's , user.by.ru ) Or, you might consider vladster.net/anything . As I have already told Josee, there is a surprize coming up in a few weeks (to a couple of months). More specific? No. It's going to be fun. Other than that, I can't wait to go to Ukraine! Called my grandparents yesterday. They say everything is ready, the urlLink Ural is fixed... Having loads of fun at work. For about a week now, I've been testing those fancy switch-boxes. They are all done (all 47 of them). I have isolated 6 faulty ones. Now is the time for self-education and slacking off. My boss told me to take a few boxes apart and see what I can do. Exciting! Now I've got a pile of books with schematics, an oscilloscope, one "good" device for reference, and six "bad" devices to be fixed. A word about my boss. He is a huge fan of racing cars. He buys old sports cars, refurbishes them in his garage and participates in races. He has like... 10 cars in his hangar or something. The other day, he drove a three-door 1995 LADA SAMARA to work. Not exactly a legendary racing car. He bought it for $150 for parts for another SAMARA that he got for free. The latter one is a sports car that was built by Lada-Canada and won some national championship, beating Honda and Toyota. The owner of the car rolled it a few times, thus rendering it suitable for scrap collectors. My boss got it for free and is now re-building it. Pretty cool stuff. $150 for a 1995 car in running condition.

 yo yo yo. check tis out, man. who's your daddy (e.i. c'est qui ton "paire"). It's been a while I haven't visited this place. Starting to feel like I miss it or something. Yeah so, vacation summer and all kinds of fun... Did Andrei say it's his b-day soon? Oh God. How old are you turning (16 or 17)? Now guys we are gonna have to be careful when jocking about "Newfees", somebody may get offended. Oh and what is this contamination of blogger with non-Vanier members? I think we should make those people pass a test of Vanier assimilation or something (say how much alcohol can one intake in a certain period of time)- just kidding Ivan. And one last thing. I think we shold do something crazy this summer, like swimming to Cuba for example. Anyone up for it? P.S. Andrei, you still have to tell us what you did the night before leaving to Newfoundland...

 Life has struck another fatal blow upon me... come to think of it Life always does.... so the moral of the story is that: if you can hurt yourself more than life can hurt you you have the winning hand. Ain't that right? This is what Martial training is all about. You train by continuously injuring yourself until you don't care anymore and then you can beat up anybody because they simply cannot hurt you any worse that you already have.... The question is how to apply this to life? Vlad ... play the frikin lotto ! here are some numbers... 3, 8, 17, 23, 24, 30 you choose the seventh' 30M$ Hey the chinese guy has started speaking proper English now... we understand each other but I find myslef talking like him more and more. Damn chinese assimilation !!! Peace all, Ivan { http://igor.bizhosting.com/ } Oh yeah, Yesterday I was in the hospital and this guy is waiting in the emergency... he has a problem with his rectum (from the machines he works on). Imagine a really tough looking quebecer guy... you know the one that is probably called Guy works hard all day, watches hockey and swears at Chretien once in a while. First thing the doctor asks him "Do you have any homosexual relations ?" He got soooo pissed !!! Anyways, it is not good to make fun of sick people....

 ok, the summer, i.e. vocation, is rolling at 2002rpm and it feels great! Man, it's actually the first time that I don't miss school during the summer break (I usually do have a feeling of nostalgy right after the last exam is over, but not this time!). Does it mean that I don't like my program? Who gives a fuck! Oh, yeah, tonight at a caraoke bar a guy with a name "Dildo" was singing. Pretty cool heh? Anyway, my birthday is coming up next week, however I don't know if I'll have time to make a party until June, but please, keep checking this site for further notice, if I won't be able to call all the people :) HA! P.S. I'm going to NEW FOUNDLAND this friday for 4 days! :)

 Heyya! Guess what? I won a gift certificate for $100 from an italian restaurant! We went to the Lava Lounge in Little Italy with Audrey and Jacques the other night. The night was full of weird coincidences, and in the end - the gift certificate. It was a lottery among about 200 people in the club. There were three prizes. Mine was the biggest. I swear, I should have bought a lottery ticket that night. I have never won anything (in a lottery) in my life!

 Sum Ting Wong.... Wai Yu So Tan? Hey Ivan! anyway gotta go, Wa Shing Ka!

 Fuck people!! Anyway, just sharing my emotions. I lost a chess game today and I'm pissed because I just played BAD. I mean I couldn't get it even after the game. I just played bad . Duh... I get it now but what the hell. Anyway, it's not that it's my fault completly. The guy was playing well . Jis! Argh!

 I don't know, but this might be relevant.

 What does this mean ??? ================================== THU MAY 09, 2002 08.52.31 From: jchu10 I am looking for a woman bike, best with a baby sitter.Please email victor at cjs0002@canada.com. Thanks ================================== source: InfoMcGill

 OK, That's it. I am going to sign up to become a swing dancer. Fuck engineering, school and all that. Dudes, I'll be at Shatner this friday night. There will be a swing dance party. See you there (those of you who aren't going to watch Cranberries).

 Above is today's date. Below is my name.

 I have witnessed a perfect pair of breasts. Also, I have a llama. I named him after his great grandfather , llama.

 Well, TyGoN, your argument certainly posesses a seed of reason. It is true that the presence of a competitor, an enemy, brings people together, thus making a society stronger and more patriotic (never mind less democratic for now). The effect is very apparent in the case of the United States and their war against the ghost of Communism. As long as the Soviet Union was in full health and great power, the American Homemaker had an objective put in his mind: resist and destroy anything with a smell remotely similar to the stinky proletariat propaganda. When the USSR plunged into the deep spin of economic and political self-destruction, the US lost its "rival sibling", and its ideology began to decompose. This slow rotting led to questionning and reconsideration of many of the society's values. Of course, nobody actually sat down to "reconsider" anything, but the big picture was that the US was trapped in a nonexistant race and was desperatly trying to win it. In this respect, I very much agree with ye. The mankind doesn't have a competitor (at least within the Solar system), and it's ultimate objective is merely the biological survival. Humanity lacks a strong war-time ideology. It has no reason to unite itself against an outside enemy. It is caught in a non-existant race which it tries hard to win. This problem, however, is not to be refered to as the "only child syndrome". Humankind doesn't really have the parents who keep on spoling it. We are, simply put, the victims of our own competitiveness with no one to fight against. That is only one way to look at it, of course. The other way is: "I've got beer in my fridge and five bucks in my pocket; I passed all my courses; Canadiens are winning; the thruth is out there, somewhere, for sure; Centucky Fried Chiken; Vive le Quebec libre; who cares; life is beautiful." P.S. I envy your entourage, Fais, "hingy people smoking cigars and the nose so high up, they had to bend down in order to exit the room". Looks like you'll be one of them some day. Hopefully, we all will. Don't forget to post though, ever then.

 Another dinner i had tonight, where it involved the hingy people smoking cigars and the nose so high up, they had to bend down in order to exit the room. However, I had company. Dear Mrs. Absolut. She taught me and told me a lot. While the evening was coming at its end, I gently took the remaining bottle out of the restaurant and walked down Notre Dame. And then it hit me. I just realized a portion of the truth about humanity. It is the following: Mankind is suffering from ,what psychologists refer to as, "only child syndrome". You see, the constant barriers that mankind breaks is because it is a "spoiled brat" using all the resources it has, because there is no other race to compete against. Or in other words, no sibling rivalry. I will need more elaborate help from more sober people. In the mean time, I drink to evil. Tygon jugs down what is left of his poison.

 Yo, Ivan!!! What a fuckin' surprise! You probably only know Andrei (Cash Johnny) and Eugene (Una Salsa Caliente). Ivansky is the first non-Vanier-related member. Well, lounges are for everybody. He is in Electrical Engineering at McGill, just like yours truly. By the way, I started work last monday baby. It's going pretty cool. I'm learning a whole lot about instruments. Today I was attempting to test a fancy electronic thingie that controls the individual reading lights in the passenger cabin. They use the same digital scopes as in our lab!!! Anyway, before I get carried away... yeah, cool.

 Hey wassup everybody, You may remember me from other educational outings like the chalet and circuits class...(sweet rape ... ah Vlad... i bet you weren't expecting that on the final) after one full day of wasing time... my summer is over. I am starting work tommorow. damnit. short and sweet the summer went and tommorow money must be spent for a bus pass and other shit damnit where did summer split In other news: My parents are kicking me out ... well just felt like sharing this with you people... Oh yeah... who do I know from the team ? I'm off, good luck to all who haven't finished exams yet Peace

 PEOPLE CHANGE... TO THE GOOD! Highschool : What?! What do you mean not 100??? CEGEP : Fuck! Below 90. That's a first. Horrible semester! University : Nice! I didn't fail anything! Holly shit! I might even get a B or something... Sveet! Cheers!

 No prob. rawk on.

 Hey Fais, there is no trip tp Niagara. That's for sure. The situation is as follows: If my car is a go by the next Fiday (5th), then we might join Ivansky and his friend David at their drunken karate thing outside Montreal. If my car's not ready, then I'll try to get my parents' van; and we could go OKA park to celebrate my birthday. Details later.

 dudez?

 OK wait wait wait. I just read the posts and the updates, and i am confused!!! Explain again, where is there a trip going on?

 VLAD!!!! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!! All places are not taken right????????? Je voulais aller, merde!!!! damn you!!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!

 Mathematicians apply the word "curved" to any space whose geometry is not Euclidian. It is an unfortunate custom because curvature, in the sense of bending, is a meaningless term except when the space is immersed in another space, whereas the property of being non-Euclidian is an intrinsic property which has nothing to do with immersion. However, nothing can be done but to utter a warning that what mathematicians understand by the term "curvature" is not what the word connotes in ordinary speech; what the mathematician means is simply that the relations between the mutual distances of the points are different from the relations which obtain in Euclidian geometry. Curvature (in the mathematical sense) has nothing to do with the shape of the space -- whether it is bent or not -- but is defined solely by the metric, that is to say, the way in which "distance" is defined. It is not the space that is curved, but the geometry of the space. Sir Edmund Whittaker.

 UPDATE NUMBER TWO OK, relax dudes. A no-go has been issued. The car's "too old" . Ivan, I want to go with you guys. If my car is running by then, we'll go and get drunk. It's scary, I haven't been piss-drunk for about two months now, since before the finals to be exact.

 UPDATE: ALL seats on the van have now been taken. The three remaining ones were occupied by Josee, Sarah and my brother. Sarah is not sure yet; if she doesn't go, Yania (sp?) will take her place. I will definitelly join the trip to Toronto! Latex, I mean latez dudes. Work day's over; time to go home.

 He who laughs last is S-L-O-W

 ACHTUNG There have been rumours in the corridors of alien power. This week's agenda: the road trip to Niagara Falls. Here's some detail provided by a reliable source. DATE: Friday night, July 5, 2002. Back on Sunday afternoon, July 7th. OCCASION: Fun. SECONDARY OCCASION: my b-day. TRANSPORT: Audrey's reliable and super-safe 7-seat Caravan. DRIVERS: So far, just me. Definitely need at least one more person to alternate at night. SEATING: 4 seats taken (Audrey, Andrei, Evgueni and yours truly); 3 seats free (as in not occupied). More seats will be available if Ivan, David or anyone else decides to go with their cars . COST: "GAS SECURITY MUTUAL FUND" will be set up in the beginning of the trip ($50 cash each; $350 in total). Unspent money (around $150) will be evenly redistributed after the trip. Roughly estimated cost per person will be around 30 bucks. PLACE TO SLEEP ON SATURDAY NIGHT: open for discussion. my idea is camping somewhere with our tents (I have one for 2 people - guess which two :). FOOD: at a traveler's discretion. Preferably take-from-home Interested parties please reply asap.

 The '81-'89 Buicks had the following engines: 2.8L, 3.0L, 3.3L and 3.8L, each having a turbocharger option. I have a 3.0 non-turbocharged. And, since the engine is basically redone anew, I will expect it to consume about 12-14 L per 100 km in the city, which, roughly, is what an old 2.0 eats. Man, that engine bolt is serious shit. You can actually brake the other two bearings... About the keyboard: NO, a will not be where a is. QWERTYUIOP[] = ������������

 "We have enough youth, how about a fountain of smart?"

 ooo, i c man, u must be on crak. rite?

 ayo pa! iz ok. Me wait for ze latest , I thank ye vere mech. Iz good. Iz good. Please tell mey , when ze the progrem, arrive, yes?

 hmmm... latest... I can give you the one I have. but I think that it's the one before the latest or something. However, do you want to pay for the latest version? If no, and if it's not urgent, I can ask around and probably find it in a week or two.

 Zis is a message to al ze chessmazters. Is you know where me is can get ze latest version of Fritz? I would ze like very mech ze information. Danke.

 Energizer Bunny Arrested! Charged with battery.

 ew

 I gotta get me one of urlLink these

 As for the WPCC (web page creation company) I am totally for it. But we're gonna need a good graphic designer in the team, 'cause I suck at it, and you (judging from your nav menu) is waay too cool for it :). Let's think of a name for the company...

 Ivan, tell us about your car, 'cause I bought one too!!! Not as cheap as yours though. I paid $600. I mean, I didn't pay $600. My urlLink aforementionned boss was rebuilding a 1981 Buick (150K km) for his wife. He had completely redone the engine (pistons, rings, shafts, valves, everything), changed transmission, suspension, brakes, inside carpets and what not. When he put the engine back in, his wife changed her mind. The car has been standing under cover in his garage for two years... and now it's mine. I only have to reattach the auxillary belt, oil pump and all the electricity to the engine. Mind you, it's not that easy. He lets me play around with it, get it running, and then, if I like it, pay him his $600. Moreover, he will deliver the car to us in his trailer the first weekend of July. So, I guess that's it. It's basically a new car, except for the body. It has an original paint and a little rust on the doors only. The rest is perfect. It's fully equipped: power windows, air conditionning, leather front seats and sunroof. Sorry for bragging so much, I just love that car. And that makes me think of something exciting. July 2 is my birthday. Now that we have cars (well, I will have it by then), we could go some place and have some fun, cause I don't want to have just a regular party inside. We could go to urlLink the place some of us went last year . It's a chalet on a lake. Sveet. What do you say, people?

 To be able to type in Cyrillic, I went to control panel - keyboard - language and added a new layout to the keyboard. I then prepared 33 little stickers cut from a video cassette cover, wrote letters on them and glued them onto the lower side of the corresponding keys. Works perfect. Now, when I go to Ukraine this August, I will buy a Russian-English keyboard and will be happy for the rest of my life. I don't know if Bulgarian keyboard layout is identical to Russian (to tell the truth, I used to think you people used Latin alphabet, like Polish. Ew.). If it is identical, I can grab one for you, too. There are also programs (I'll try to find) that convert "translit" to cyrillic text. "Translit" is what Russians call a text typed in Russian language using Latin characters. But those progs are usually unreliable if you care about the right spelling, because there are different ways to interpret such letters as �, �, �, etc..

 Hey does anyone have a phonetic Cyrillic typesetting program? SOmething that will let me write in Cyrillic but the a is where the a is on QWERTY keyboard and so on?

 Wow... I never though someone would read this. Especailly not the evil, Patricia stealin' Vlad. I am starting to understand now - you have a big evil online personnality that follows every new move that takes place.... So when are we opening a web page creation company and making some money you bum ? In other news, I got a car for 500$. I shall prey to all divinities that it lasts through the summer and maybe into the winter.... Parking at Mcgill though is as hard/painful as divorcing a russian woman so I don't think I will be experimenting with that. I have vowed to start eating well (as in alot) as of this week ... Does anybody want to cook for me ? I hear no takers... so why don't you suggest something good and easy to prepare. Note: This statement is not adressed to the russian population becuase all you guys eat is Pilmeny and sometimes sussige....

 Not to be mean or anything, but urlLink this is what happens when you go drinking without us, Ivan. �� ������ ���� � ������ ������. (�������� �� ��������!).

 it means, you need help my friend.

 86% nerd-pure and 29% weird...what does iz mean?

 68% nerd-pure. That's 12% nerd and 11% weird. Hm... it's weird; I'm normal.

 Well, I'm 62% ... almost failing.

 I feel that this is urlLink required I am treading the dangerous 66% line.

 Especially me. ;-}

 We love you too, urlLink shubbie :).

 ACHTUNG As of October 2002, vladster.net will cease to exist. Everyone will miss it, I know, but life goes on. The reason later. However, ne vous enquetez pas au sujet de Vanier Lounge , mes amis! It it has proven to be such a success; it will stay alive forever. What will change is its location. I will soon set up an easy-to-remember redirect address and will promptly transfer all the archives to another location, namely lounge.by.ru .

 you don't play too many multiplayer games , do you vlad? well heeha, that xp has a tendency of "erroring" a perfectly viable program!!! Oh the humanity!

 Well, I have had xp running for a few months now. I can't say it's completely bugless, but certainly very close to it. It's pretty stable and doesn't crush. The only serious trouble I've had was it "loosing" user profiles..

 iz ok?

 hey people, how are you all doing?! Sorry Andrei, I could not get to your party the other night, I got lost in the rain... As for the other bloggers, it seems Faisal has grown alot smarter, and Vlad a lot drunker, I guess his job is paying off pretty well.. One last word for Faisal, sorry for the confusion bro...I bet you know what I mean

 I don't know what to write... Tygon has outposted everybody lately... :) Next is Mr. Suit. and then I guess it's the rest of the team. Oh, yeah, Jeka asked me not to post something here, so I won't :)

 I thought that with this drink of gin, I share this with all my fellow bloggers and leave you with a word of wisdom from the great drunk, Tygon. "A critic is man who leaves no turn unstoned." Cheers mate!

 After installing XP, I realized that a bugless program is only a theoretical concept.

 freewebftp.com rocks

 I spilled spot remover on my dog and now he's gone.

 What people do on Monday nights Audrey: so what are we doing? Evgueni: well, the metro is closing in 30min. I guess we can just go have a coffee and go home after. Audrey: sure. 5 min later, walking in the gay village. Audrey: no coffee places are open, let's go to the piano bar Evgueni: yeah, we can have Amaretto Sour Audrey: nice, but you look too flashy, guys will be picking you up Evgueni: so you're gonna have to protect me, I'm gonna tell everyone you're my girlfriend Audrey: yeah right. 5 min later, fininishing the 1st glass of Amaretto Sour. Audrey: I want another one Evgueni: hm, let's have one more and go home. at 12:30 am. Evgueni: these drinks got to me a little, it's time to go home Audrey: yeah me too, do you wanna take a taxi Evgueni: sounds good. 2:30 am, having hard time to speak. Audrey: where did these shooters come from? Waiter: the guy sitting at the table on the left Evgueni: let's drink with him Audrey: o.k. and let's drink to Ukrainians. Evgueni: so you are drinking to me? Audrey: no, Ukrainians with dark hair Evgueni: well, that's a very good one, cheers. 3:30 am, in the taxi. Evgueni: well it was fun to go for coffee Audrey: I can't see anymore (falling asleep) Evgueni: I'm so writting this on blogger.

 don't you mean , 3 white vertical lines in orange background? }----"perspect...ive"[-}

 Oups, you got me there Fais. What I meant by "abstract" were the random drawings, pursuing no pattern whatsoever. How redneck of me. There are also those that do make a pattern, but that's all they do. Like that huge thing I saw at a museum in Ottawa: two vertical orange stripes on white background. The museum bought it for about $800K, if my memory serves me well. That's what I don't like. God bless Da Vinci and Monet, man. Sorry about that.

 dude, you don't think, "outcries of an artist" can be expressed, or as the matter of fact "outcries" of anyone in any other form than speech or sign? I think it is quite possible to express something or to tell something without using common forms of communication. If you truly believe that that is not so, than human civilization has never existed. Art form , in abstraction, has been quite rich for human culture. Example? Well mona Lisa is quite hideous but its meaning and the sheer genius of drawing is , well.... powerful. And David, the statue, well dude, a naked male statue has never had so much importance and "inspiration" for so many. I think what you are troubled by is contemporary art. It is quite "eccentric" and probably very "disturbing" . But I am sure, their truth or whatever it was the artist's intention will be revealed much to our awe, only quite later probably, much like the above mentioned masterpieces. I dont think Leonardo Da Vinci and Michaelangelo are laughing their asses off. are they? what do you think ? and i just named two.

 Hey Ivan, I read that stuff about two months ago. It's a urlLink very cool publication , although way too many of so-called McGill students don't get the humour in there at all. Poor monkey-lovers.

 I like abstract paintings, as long as they are what they are: random screenshots of someone's relatively sick mind not requiring much of skill or talent to produce. I don't like the fuss about them being super-duper full of "ideas", "images" etc. I bet those "artists" laugh their asses off when people "grasp" the "outcries of the artist's soul" in those, excuse me, masterpieces.. (Hi Dasha :).

 vlad dude, why don't you like abstract paintings? is it anything "abstract" that you don't like or just that form of painting?

 From a McGill Publication called Red Herring Recently, there's been a big kerfuffle about George W. Bush's "Axis of Evil" speech. Because he American President is in fact functionally illiterate, and has trouble conceptualizing shapes with more than one dimension, his advisors neglected to tell him about the other geometric shapes of evil. And it's a good thing, too, because it took them two weeks to get him to stop saying "Asses of Evil." HHHHA

 Faisal... What in the world is wrong with you?! By the way, today I went Grand Prix Canada. Man, it rocks! It's just Ferrari vs. McLauren and everything else is a hustle (yet, some exceptions may occur). First it was F1, then Pan-Am qualificaitions for those 60's and 70's racing cars, then F1600 (38 cars on the track!! They remind me of a swarm of bees), and finally it was a race among the owners of Ferraris in the world. Shit these cars look fine, as well as perform great!

 Who should one trust less than a smoked-up [super]fly abuser? The deprived soccer-watching monkey-lover with thick facial hair.

 Aha! I have expressed passive agression. Ya that's right, my freezer burned as a sanitary landfill was discovered. What? Why you looking at me like that? Yes that is coffee. No that's not facial hair, thats my blackened eyes from sleep depravation. Hey! a nickel, Am i lucky or what?

 I knew it is joules. it's just that JEWL sound so much like "jewels" (in other words "balls" , hehe) 10 to 34 testicles inputed into the universe every second. So much testosterone for us. Well, I guess those suitcases were a size of family size fridge ;)))

 Depeche Mode, Fais. "Let Yourself Go". The best sex music ever. Roma, It's JOULES. Also, I think any 3rd-grader [in Russia] knows that a suitcase nuclear bomb is physically impossible. Those smoked-up motherf*ckers should refer to the concept of the Criticall Mass for more details.

 Why do I LOVE to stand in people's way? Oh Yes, I am Mr. Pinstripe Suit (aka YOUR HOT DADDY). Spank my monkey, you monkey-lover.

 Heh, Fais, we just chatted through email.

 I need tips to counter sleep depravation. I need help to overcome sleep depravation. Fifa is good. but no sleep is bad. i have fimble finger syndrome. ya that's right. i cant quite recall what i have just typed. Except the period that I just put at the end of this sentence. Oh boy... Just read that heavy breathing and work will help to fall asleep. In other words, sex. Great. no sleep.

 Vlad - You Bastard .... She was supposed to start dancing with me ... not you !!! What is this? I protest. Didn't you parents teach you not to take another (lonely) man's blond ! PS. I will remember this.

 Do you get emails asking you to join any religion ? Somehow I recieve them _daily_ (The last one had some info on Russia I've never heard before hehe ;))) Here is some lines from the last one: "...1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (APPROXIMATLY 10 TO THE 34th POWER) JEWLS (POWER UNIT) NEEDS TO BE INPUTED INTO THE WHOLE UNVERSE EVERY SECOND TO KEEP IT FROM FALLING COMPLETELY APART." (Just wondering where the pieces are going to fall into..and what the hell is a JEWL..jewels ?...power jewels yeah right) "..AND RECENTLY 65 NUCLEAR SUITCASE BOMBS WERE STOLEN FROM A TEXAS MILITARY BASE. " (Mushroom clouds over the nearest Burger King) " ... THERE IS THREE ACTVE RUSSIAN MILITARY BASES IN CALIFORNIA ALONE. " (And I guess there are three more in Washington DC. oh those evil russians) "... RUSSIA HAS JUST FINISHED BUILDING ITS LAST MAJOR UNDERGROUND CITY, NEAR MOSCOW, IN PREPARATION TO HIDE 2/3 OF ITS POPULATION IN WHAT THEY EXPECT TO BE A VERY SOON BREAKOUT OF NUCLEAR WAR."

 Have fun Vova, don't forget to bring us some Russian bread and candy :). And by the way, why do first five pics have to be of me?? Moreover, the first one of me and Ev? Anyway, it's all good. See you all soon and Vlad on Sept 5th. Later!

 I have put audrey's and josee's kissing pic as my background. Oh baby! My head is actually covered my Audrey. It seems of the both, Audrey is more enthusiastic. She is litterally pulling audrey towards her... I better shut up before I make a mess.

 Hey Vano, about screwing with older ladies, just give me a shout - I'll give you all the truth. As per the place to make love :))), give Andrei a call. He still has the keys from our lil Verdun appartment. And no one lives there now :))). Good luck.

 summer

 Man, this is so dead, it smells.

 Happy birthday! Work hard, play hard. Die happy.

 it feels good to be 20 today. cousins taking me drinking. they wanna get me piss drunk. those sweet bastards.

 stupid boss

 It took me 17.5 minutes to explain my boss (at another job I hold on Tue and Thu) what a blind carbon copy is.

 I take 30 seconds to commemorate the end of vladster. 30.....29......(ya ok thats enough). cheers

 ok, Piano Bar is located on the south side of St-Catherine near the intersection of St-Catherine and Beaudry (aka metro Beaudry). it's next to the pizza that is on the latter intersection and has huge glass windows instead of proper walls. Other name for this bar is Club Date . See ya later!

 hm... :)

 Andrei? getting laid? is it already doomsday?

 wuzz up dudes. It's been a while, I know. Speaking of getting laid Vlad. What were you doing on Tuesday night, July 2nd (your b-day, by some weird coincidence)? Neither you, nor Audrey were posible to reach by telephone.

 Oh my, dudes, did Andrei get laid or something? Nah, I don't think so... I mean, duh? Who would sleep with ANDREI? It's Andrei, you know... All girls know that.

 Huh. So, it's like sort off... Like off, on the second. And personal advice, don't walk up Mont-Royal on a hot summer night in the woods, or something. Huh. So double instead of sigle (that's English, right?)

 hot...ugghhh....humid......must .....take.....off....... clothes............... ...AAAAAAAA!!!!!!

 It's sadly quiet down here.....hey Mosko, it's impossible to reach you these days....i guess someone is getting laid full-time

 the FEZ is back

 Yes, Jeka, I'm really sorry for not being there on the 13th :(. I'll make it up before I will leave. And Fais!! When should we expect you back to Mtl? There are a few parties (or drinking sessions) planned during the coming weeks. See ya then!!

 Hey Vovchik! Glad to know you are doing fine. I really would like to know about all the uncensored stuff. As to what's going on here... well Audrey and I wasn't really serious, if you know what I mean. So don't worry too much and keep on partying. It would be really cool if could bring some of that cheep russian vodka to Canada. Now, Andrei, yes I'm still single, but very well provided with "job security". And I still can't believe that you won't be there on my B-day, bastardo.

 finally Vladdy we hear from you!!! Glad to know it's all good. I've sent you some e-mails, but they all seem coming back to me, so I guess you don't really know all the stuff that's going on here. Well as for that 'stuff' we'll tell you on a more confidencial channel :). Anyhow, I'm leaving for France the 12th of Sept. and probably coming back some time in summer 2003. Besides that, Audrey is going out with Evguni now, thought you ought to know :) Just kidding actually, he is still singe. :P Now seriously, I want to invite everyone to a party on September the 7-th and the 8-th. It will take place in possibly Verdun, Audrey's place, or in a country house. Take care,

 Oh yes, for berry-pickig I am for!!! Hello, my ladies, how you're all doing fine! I am in my city baby. Kostanai, Kazakstan; and hell, I am having a blast watching MIB 2 in Russian! :). I have so many impressions and things to say that I will probably mix everything up. My class is doing extremely well in the city. Many moved to Russia and Germany, many have married and are having their boring family lives. Out of all my classmates, only 3 people stll don't have a higher education. I am one of them. I have classmates working in banks, police, night clubs security personel etc. I want to stay here. :( A friend of mine works as a fashion designer at a model agency. She showed me around at her work... Holly fucking godmother of Jesus Christ! Viva Charles Darwin with his natural selecton!!! Ait! Those ladies fine. And she kno she fine! Still going strong, if you know what I mean. Yesterday I got drunk with my fellas, spent a total of 8 dollars for 2 bottles of vodka and stuff to eat for three. Then we took a looong taxi drive around the city for another 2 bucks form my pocket. Today I bought genuine hand-made black leather shoes for 30 bucks. Gonna shop some more. I like it. I'm leaving back to Ukraine on monday, and to Canada on Sept 4th. See yall there dudes. That's it. The uncensored stuff later in person. So, Andrei, I guess no France for you???

 Hello all. I message you from Wisconsin. I am now in the library of University of Wisconsin in Madison. Campus here kicks some mOntreal campus ass. And this campus is one of top in my field. so i may be looking at my graduate schol here, which is good, cuz the honeys here are tight!!!!! I tell more later.

 Hey, I'm the official landlord of the Verdun love-palace. And I say that I'm thinking of subletting or renting this place for a year starting Sept. 1st. However, the exact dates will be available within next one or two weeks. I will be looking for two/three people to live ther, and I already have some candidates. So if you are interested, contact me. It's 3-bedroom, 1-livingroom, kitchen, toilet/shower, lot's of closets and 15-20 min from downtown by merto or 7-10 min by car. Price...hmm.... t.b.a. because I don't know how much do the gaz/water/electricity costs, but it should not be more than 450$/month (all included) per person.

 the beach was good. hmmm... yes. I got a sun-stroke and a sun-burn and was sick the entire monday. Oh, by the way! Who's up for berry-picking this week-end? And also the beach party on friday at the dance school?

 Well there is nothing on vladster.com but doteasy registration says it is not available yet.... I will wait some more... I guess How was the beach ? (to all those involved)

 vladster.com it is.

 Ahem indeed. I'm about to inflict suffering upon someone. Most evil fool I am. Forsaken by the Force will I be.

 I feel that an a "ahem" is required before i proceed. ahem.

 Blogger is alive anew, thanks to Andrei. I'll call you Da Frenchman from now on if that's ok. By the way, when you called, I raised my head too quickly and bumped into the power steering tube. Argh! Choose time next time :) Ah, the car. What a wonderful automotive mechanics learning experience. Actually, the mechanical part of the work is done: exhaust is connected and tightened, power steering hose replaced, engine bolts tightened, oil pump bolts replaced. Now is the electricity turn. If everything goes well, we'll drive to Toronto in the beginning of October. Got one free seat left :).

 Oh, by the way. Vlad I couldn't open the picture you e-mailed me. Eh, hehe. Athother thing. Here I have only two photos from Canada. They are both from Vlad's good-bye party. One is a group picture, and the other is of Audrey. (Audrey, I was suppose to give them back to you, but I forgot... sorry). So! I put both pictures on the wall, and I wonder, when I'll be bringing chicks to my appartment, will be they asking me if the girl on the photo is the one on whom I'm cheating with them? :) hehe. (actually, depending on the girl, I'll decide to keep the picture or to take it off) :p

 Hello my fellow Canadians!!! I'm writing to you from my exile in Paris, France :). Yes, yes, I have had some adventures falling on my head, yet, nothing too special, especially durong last two days that I spent sleeping in my appartment. By the way, my appartment... I can easily fit four people in here (maybe five if somebody sleeps in the same bed as me). So I'm expecting to see you here SOON! And the sity and the country is great!!! Jizzz! Here is a lot to see and a lot to do. And those a lot are on every freakn' coner!! ( I mean historical buildings, etc.) Anyhow, I've been to the Effel tower at night... It's amazing. I also rode my sister's bike (now it's in my possetion) around Paris. At some point I suddenly breaked with front and rear breaks at the same time, so the back of my bike lifted and hit the car parked beside. Driver's window was cracked, the mirror fell out of the mirror pocket and the pocket itself was, hmmm, sort of in the wrong place. I really didn't have time to check out anything else, as I was quickly pedaling away. But the bike was fine. Same day I biked to the "Arc de Triumph", and to get there one either needs to use the underground tunnel, or cross something like 7 or 8 lane circlar road, with no street signs what-so-ever. Guess which way I chose. :) But it was a pretty loud honking symphony. So as soon as I got to the Arch, I started to enjoy the historical heritage of France, as suddenly two cops came up to me and said that I can't be here with bike. I made the dummest face possible and said: "Huh?! English?" Luckely they didn't speak any understandable English, so I took the opportunity to make them look like serious idiots, while making a clown of myself using the funniest sign language I could think of. I worked, they left me alone for 5 mins or something like that until some fat security lady started yelling at me that I can't ride my bike on the grave of the unknown soldier (yet, I was holding the bike beside me with the holliest/touristic face, five meters away from that place). Anyhow, told her in English what I thought about her yelling at me, about tourists, and about this "public cemetery" as she called the Arc of Triumph. The security bitch clearly understood what I said so it ended in the same police guards trying to resolve the situation, and me pedaling away as fast as possible through the same creazy circular street and those idiots yelling behind me. I don't know if they where following me or not, but soon I made it to Champs Elys�es heading to the Louvre, and then to Notre Dame and to the border of the Seine. That was my fist Sunday in Paris.

 Ok. Got news from Andrei. He's doing alright or simply said he's doing...Well, running away from police in the centre of Paris. Mais j'imagine qu'il voudra raconter ses aventures lui-meme. And does anyone know where Audrey is? I've been trying to reach her for three days.

 No it fucking isn't, esti. we want war! we want war! we want war!

 is it dead, really??

 Sunday-Monday 1am that is. Just had a long conversation with my father mixed with some alcoholic substances. I realized that it's a good thing to do sometimes, you could actually learn a lot from it. Other than that well, I wish every one a great academic year and hopefully lots of new experience, especially that some of us will be living on a diferent continent. And I'm really up for going to France on vacation sometime around x-mass time, just gotta check the finances. Ok. Time to sleep now. Bye P.S. The ex PM of Israel is coming to Concordia tomorrow, they say. Have been told not to come to school due to some protesting events being prepared. Well I'll just go check it out, see if it's realle dangerous.

 vladster.com is mine! moving in october. Andrei, I was looking for you too! I had a class at 10, and then was around with Sarah untill 1-2. Then I met up with Audrey and never came back. Why didn't you call me?

 Welcome back dude~~! I've been at McGill for last hour looking for you and somehow all the people I see tell me that you are somewhere around. Anyway it's 12:48 and I'm going to work till 21:00. See you later.

As I know, our Mr. Pinstripe Suit is coming back tomorrow from his Ex-Soviet adventure. Should be an exiting story :).

 Hey guys, anyone wants to come to a Halloween party tonight. It's at Groove and I'm sellig tickets for $5. You'll also have a chance to participate in a Bachelor Auction where you'll be able to buy some bachelorettes (as well as bachelors) and have an actual date with them. So if interestd give me a call.

 In case someone would like to make some cash for school, urlLink click here . I got this, uh, where else, in the email. Hey Andrei, what the fuck was that voice message about?

 m'ouais m'ouais, c'est ca

 Hey people!! Audddrey!! Hello!! Long time no seeing! By the way, did I tell you that here is a vacation called Tussin or something like that, so I don't know when will be the next time I'll get my hands on the internet. Yay! I finally got Winamp!! Now I can actually listen to music on my computer. For everything else, well, I'm getting kicked out from the comp room so see you later!!!

 Am I dreaming or did Bibi really post something? Well, Audrey it looks quite deep. Andrei, if you have a chance to read it, it's now around 1:30 am in Montreal, so I will most likely call you tomorrow, unless I change my mind once finished posting. I was pretty busy today...

 Hm.. since you're asking. Here you go. The McGill fucking Daily . urlLink A guide to getting it up the ass. The anal sex revolution is upon us. You don?t want to miss out, do you? Being in a proximity of a big empty container and running water is advisable while reading.

 alrighty, any other straight people here?

 that was one irrelevant "comeback". can you read at all?

 You're gay (although it's a little late for a comeback)

 hey foks, i posted some pics on the mainpage. can't see much though.

 how gay

 cool blog design http://www.shanapowers.com/blog/

 man, I'm in a philo mood... And I think that I just broke up with my g-f. Have to get used to that idea. And she is sitting almost right beside me. Hmmmm... Wiered. Anyway, anybody for a political discussion? Something like official status of the navites hors Nunavut. I wonder how hard for them to get visas to other contries? Or influence of aborigens in Latin America on the political elections in Zimbabwe. For instance: from www.independnet.co.zw "SOUTH African President Thabo Mbeki changes policy on Zim SOUTH African President Thabo Mbeki is adopting a more hands-on policy on Zimbabwe, which has become an economic albatross around southern Africa's neck"

 I still see the notice that it will come back to normal on the vladster.com/lounge

 Lounge is back to normal.

 Who's for storming?

 And yeah, thanks Ivan for advice. :) but the whole point is that I have no idea what the load could be.

 i was referring to my life.

 Zolotilos' solntce na voloske tonkoi protrescheni, cherez kotoruiu sotni glaz vstrechali rassvet. It's always hard to jump out of bubble and touch the world yourself.

 Altai. In a private little city (but that's just dreams). I don't know, yet. But to spoil the wonder-like mood of last post, I just want to mention that toilets are shared in my University. Welcome to France, Andrei. And what's incredible is that all the comps here were updated from Netscape 4 to Mozilla-Netscape browzer. And today I aslo, it seems like have updated my feelings towards some people I've recently met... By the way, Vlad, who is YOUR bitch you refered to few post ago? (if it's not a secret). And Jeka, I wouldn't be needing the WARRANTY untill I come back to Canada. Nonetheless, I'm really thinking that I don't know when I will come back*. By the way ***!!!*** My parents are looking to sublet our appartment in Montreal-Nord very soon, for an undeclared period of time. ANYONE interested. It's pretty URGENT. And preferably to be someone who is trustworthy, particularly one of you guys, or one of your friends. What's funny, is that my parents might be leaving Canada next month or so, my sister with her b-f are going (or moving) to France in the summer, and I ... don't feel that there is something particularly important for ME left there except for those writing on this blogger and a small group of others. Anyway, you wanted to talk meaningfully? Screw all of ya! Guess you had a point, I'm bored.

 urlLink see? I'm all cool now. DUdes, I was thinking (!)... maybe it's enough of all that drinking and fucking stuff? How about having a meaningful conversation about things that matter? e.g. who would want to spend his/her life where. Canada? US? Europe? Zimbabwe? Arctic circle?

 It's called warranty, guys, for fuck'ssake. W-A-R-R-A-N-T-Y!!!! . Or guarantee. Hm... come down... pheewww. vLadster cool. How does one check a car battery if the only tool available is a multimeter (although a professional one)? I mean, it gives 12V, but with no load. I know, I know... I might as well have asked my great grandmother about nuclear reactors, but maybe someone here knows... Anyone?

 Andrei, I still didn't have time to look for the garanty, because as Vova said mid-terms are killing the normal people in my program too. However some of those normal people are at this moment sitting in front of a computer and reading the news about all you guys. Tomorrow I have an exam in a class that I've never opened the book for...dead I am tomorrow that is. Not that any of you care probably, though it still feels good to officially wright somewhere. According to a an obseration of statistically analytical nature, one might conclude that the mood of the blog master pieces has gone down to the depressive stage of their existance. So on that happily-depressively-positively negative note, I am ready to step into the new period of my text book filtering. Don't worry, be happy. P.S. Vova, to answer one of your interestingly comprehensive posts... S tochki zrenia banalnoi eruditsii kajdii chasnii individuum podverjen deistviu totalnogo opophioza (not sure of the spelling).

 The lounge is Netscape 6-friendly. I didn't test it on anything earlier because I couldn't find a computer that has Netscape 4 on it. In any case, what's inside the blogger (when you log in) is for sure compatible with anything remotely resembling a web browser. Andrei, try Opera. It works pretty fast even on shit-slow computers (e.g. Ivan's). Ok, "shy guy with something on his mind". From your monologue, you seem to be pretty bored (or at least it seems like it, from how I know you). Secondly, I'm not sure if your petite amie reads this, unless she uses some kind of sophisticated stealth software to completely mask her existence on the web. Montreal is alright. Last night was the first snow. Midterms are killing me and most of the normal people (about 3) in this fucked-up program. Seriously, man, it must be fun to be a teacher in ECE. Only sadists need apply. Just had my complex vars midterm. It was the first one that I actually finished. In the end I realized most of it was wrong, because I confused the cross-derivatives in Cauchy-Riemann equalities. Fun, fun, fun. Now I have a fucking fifty-hour ass't due on wed. another one due tonight. I also have a midterm coming up for a class in which I haven't showed up for at least three weeks. So, if you ask me, life is a bitch. But (according to the latest email I wrote to a dedicated fan of mine), she is MY bitch. Latezz.

 So what are the news in Mtl? Here it's fine, but sucks at the same time. :/ It rains here 5 days out of a week and the length of French people's faces is directly proportional to the amount of mm of rain/day. Tomorrow I'm going for a movie premiere, it will be my second night outing since I'm in France. My g-f got some promotion tickets. I'm also training every sunday from 11:00 to 17:00 o'clock or more, but I'm thinking to start training more. The faculty is o'k, I go there just for classes and then come home. I visited some cultural sites here, but most of the time I have spent either at some newly aquentented friends house, or walking around, or cooking, or doing something, which is really nothing, but still takes time. Everywhere, I look like a shy guy with something on his mind, who doesn't speak French (funny, heh?). I'm still looking for a job, it's not that I really did something to find one, but I think it's already too late anyway, I'm in a too deep shit hole, I have to swim to stay afloat. Yet, I'm writing some stuff. Not a lot, but some stuff. Maybe I will get a job here soon, or at least something like that. Now I have to go food shopping. Why am I telling you all this? Is this interesting to anyone? Well, if you've got till this point, I guess it is. Faisal, are you still playing chess? If so what's your raiting now? Jeka, it would be great if you've found the garanty, because l'affaire qui le tien � la main a p�tt�. Vlad, what's new in life and at school? And how's the atmosphere in general? Alright, got to go buy some food, prepare something to eat, visit two buddies, and sit in front of my slow computer and type bullshit, or read or actually do some shcool work. See you later! Peace and Love to ya all!

 Huh?! Mujik, ti sam-to ponial choie skazal? A question aside: "Will the V-lounge become Netscape friendly at any considerable future? Or should I wait for Netscape to become friendly with the lounge?" Tygon, hmmm.... C'est grave. And to answer your question. :) The French women will do ANYTHING they say "no" to, as long as you don't insist, but hint discretly. And, they just LOVE to flirt&play which usually ends up in. Anyhow, I'm going to shut up, because I my ex-neighboor and my future 'ex' might read this. Oops, did I say something? (I have a feeling that some permanent reader will shake her head while reading this :-P ) Another thing, I have the greatest image of Vova in my mind :) At some point I'll produce it on computer screen and post it here :). It's just too cute :* .

 Bon alors, je vais garder la theme des dernieres postes et ecrire en francais. Il faut que je demande au moins une fois a Andrei comment sont les femmes franciases. puis? En tout cas, moi, je traine une bequille pendant un bout de temps. J'ai pas eu la chance de faire la bete a deux dos depuis des...........(oui je sais, c'est pitoyable, alors arretez de rire, et foutez moi le camp.)

Je vous le garantis, une tres haute dose de nicotine, et l'absence de sexe, somment une combinaision fatale. Puis....et quoi encore? ...bof, j'ai plus rien a dire, donc pour finir, un mot d'avis.

Essayez plus tot quelquechose de plus seduisant, comme par exemple, "Excuse m'am , Which one of the dwarfs would you do?" Pour finir, rappelez-vous mes enfants, dites non aux drogues.

 No comments...

 Been dazed and confused for so long, it's not true... *** Not fasting anymore. Back in the groove, as some might say. Dudes, appreciate things you have. For hard they might be to regain. Amen. ***Led Zeplin rocks my world.

 Oups, forgot something. I think I still have the garanty, have to find it...

 Ok. dude... It seems that you French people have nothing to do. What the f... you have conversations with girls about titties. Why don't you go continue "conversing" instead of bragging about it on the blogger(putain mec). And even though American food is modified, we have good sizes here too, ranging form XL to XXL. So Andrei how's your ex-neighbour doing?

 Ksatati, Jeka. Do you still have the garanty for the watch?

 AAAAAAA... aaaaaaaaaa..... a-a-a-a-a...... And all together!! :) You bet I examined :) ! Was quite exciting!! :-P. And, hey Vova, don't get jealous here, we all know about your fasting period :) . By the way, are you all fasting there? Well, at least you have the computer speed. The only comps avalable are at the faculty, and it takes appox. 1-2 mins to download the blogger page, 3-5 min to post&publish. Besides, the only system used here is Lenux, which crashes every second connection. So don't complain!! To add, it's 7:00pm and the computer room is full of diff dudes, who are hucked on 'agances de rencontres' , and what's worse, that from time to time when I take a glince at their screen, they turn it away due do the adult content of the sites!!! Jis! So that's why French women are considered so horny by the rest of the world! Anyway, I really see that Vlad is the only one from the blog population really dedicated to his computer and to talking to me sometimes, so Hello Vova!! By the way, is there anybody except you and me and some horny Frenchmen reading this web inspite of the vocabulary used? ARGH!

 Is it just me, or it really smells in here? Is Andrei having his PMS again? Don't laugh though, it's a strictly proffetional observation. So, Andrei, did you get to professionally examine the effects of American food on French female population? Also, how's that summer camp business going? Any changes?

 Good news about genetically modified food. Recently I had a conversation with a few girls about titties. Don't laugh, it was strictly proffetional. Anyhow, they told be about an observation they made while visiting the U-states. ('U' doesN'T stant for urinated). So, the observation was that while living there their tits started to grow. Consequently, they started asking questions, and the answer was: the FOOD. Indeed, since in the U-states they were eating food that is genetically modified, i.e. containing hormones, 0-fats and overdosed vitamins and proteins, their tits grew. However, in my opinion, their size was fine with me! There were, of course, some side effects; but who cares when an alternative for silicon pums is already in bussiness and is incorporated in women's everyday life activities!! You GO GIRLS! :) *All rights reserved*

 Man, so did anyone finally decide to come visit me except Patricia? Oh, hold on, are you all into the mid-term exam hibernation period? Guess so. By the way, Doris, do you know a dude named Doris Day? On his behalf I got an offer for skiing at Mont-Tremblant which is 215dolls/season for full time students aged 17-25, canadian residents, if applied in groups of 4, before November 15. It's for those wusses who'd rather ski than coming to France. :) By the way, did anyone m e n t i o n anything about sitting and not being able to study in Red Path due to the migration of various interesting species from left to right of the one's vision field? I'm laughing in your face!! And Zagombies, stop fishing the little ones, it's time to move on to classic brands! And they are all here :).

 Wow... Yeah, Tai-Chi is alright



 Did any of you try Tai-Chi? Pretty cool stuff :)

 Heh, funny :)

 Ivan's future job: Laboratory Assistant Location: Downtown Dept: Dept of Medicine Wage: $10.00/Hour Fall Session: 20 hours per week Duties: 1. Handling of mice. 2. Restraining mice in the smoking machine. 3. Smoking of 24 mice (2 cigarettes/12mice), presence in the smoking room required. 4. Changing of tubing in the smoking machine twice a week. 5. Cleaning the machine and area around it. Skills: Reliable, motivated, capable of handling mice, non-allergic to smoke and mice, manually dexterous. I think they should also add "excellent mice communication skills". Imagine putting that stuff on your resume: Duties: - Successfully operated complex smoke tubing equipment - Restrained mice in the smoking machine...

 Bain, ouai. Arait ton swearing man. Guess what, I just had a chat with a guy who's going to try me out for a web developer position in the Faculty of Education. They are going to give me some occasional projects for now with a possible "permanent" position next year. Could prove to be interesting...

 Well... the "Josee's hotel" is back in business. What a night. We had a reunion of an almost forgotten company. Josee, Cleo, Eugene, Audrey and yours truly. All at Josee's place (formerly known as Josee's mum's place). Some card games. Then Peel Pub. Bad quality beer, good quality time. A 1p.m. eggs-and-bacon breakfast on Parc. Just the right time to start doing something useful. Studying awaits me. A loong weekend full of signals, systems and electronic circuits. Magnificent! Groovey. Outstanding. Anyone who wants to share my fate for this weekend (in terms of studying) is welcome to give me a call any time of the day. I won't sleep.

 Danny and I caught a fly in the Redpath library. We put it into a coffee cup and stuck it onto the glass using gum. Now everyone passing by can see it struggling to get out. The fly is pretty confused. SAVE THE FLY!!!!!

 Hi guys! Nobody missed anything. :) Don't feel left out. This blog needs more news! Andrei, how's school? What's the level of their courses (i.e. how bad they suck)? If anyone sees Igar, tell him to post something! As our advanced calculus teacher loved to say: "Come on... I need more entuziazm... Andrrrei! How many zeroz arre therre in de end of factorrial of 2002?!"

 Hello...what the fuck?

 Did I miss something?

 What? Andrei speaks English? Man, who knew...

 Heh, like you're exused! Mu, nice to hear from you. Everyone, I just had my first day of classes :)). Nothing too difficult, yet looks like I would need to work I my ass of here in order to get good grades. However, since I'm mostly interested in passing the courses, I hope the workload to greatly deminish. Oh, yes, my french is getting better and better :)) I can actually read books now :)), yet I miss all the easy english bragging about nothing. Here I need to work my mouth muscules which is quite tiring :/. To chess lovers, I'm back in the game, but blitz only (for now). And very important, I really understand why Bunin is called a classic and why he got the Nobel price. Man, every two pages I just sit up and say: "ebat' moi hiu, hmmm, blia." Then I get ashamed and add "oh, tak eto pravda." Putain, le Mec est vraiment pas mal, pas mal du tout!

 So, Andrei, you live in "Cartier Latin"? I guess you'll need your merengue :).

 like... duh?!

 Hello everyone! hey Mosko, glad, to see you can still type on a keyboard, I thought you lost your entire head when you crossed the Atlantic.... As for the rest of the Blog family, yours truly is doing fine, not wandering around parking lots as some may suggest (Pathetic LOSER!)... I am actually trying smthg new this time : It is called Studying... enjoy..

 Hell, I have just rediscovered my long-forgotten toy: urlLink click. It translates French-to-French too! Here's this blog's description: if you feel the urge to get in touch and have mind-blowing sex with any of the contributors, give us a shout Translated #1: ...si vous sentez le recommander... d'avoir le sexe hallucinant avec un quelconque de ces contribuants, donnez-nous un cri. Translated #2: ...... contribuants hallucinog�nes vous d'un quelconque de ces d'avec de silicium sentez le recommander... d'avoir le sexe, C.p. donnez-nous d'un. Translated #3: .......sentez vous le recommander... d'avoir le sexe, d'un donnez-nous de de silicium de d'avec de d'un quelconque de ces de hallucinog�nes de contribuants de C.p.. Oh yes. It is indeed Saturday night. And I'm home, amusing myself with google. I can't believe it! What the fuck is this? I guess it's one consequence of being single: no one wants to know me anymore. That is... if I don't count the bunch of porn-seeking loosers here on this website. Funny, Ivan told me the same thing the other day :). Now I can feel it. It must be contageous or something. Well, at least he gets calls from chicks who need their math assignments done :). BBHahhhahahahahaaaaaaaaa :)). No, actually I was invited to Audrey's place tonight. The salsa-man, David and Angelie are just goona drink the remaining fifteen barrels of vodka and go jump in the pool. Not my kind of fun... anymore... for now. That was me and my geeky and pathetic boredom. P.S. Roma, prover' mylo na morexyz. Srochno.

Vova is not hated. Anymore. For now. And... someone here is about to take a very sudden decision :))). Respect! Audrey will be a pilot! Oups, I better shut up now.

 Jeka's tired. He just finished writting up a case report. Hate those things. Ok, just so myself in the mirror, my hair is mess, need a haircut. Why am i saying all this? My hand is tyred of typing ...sleep, sleep, sleep. Wake up. Go home. Ok, bye...

 Vlad, can you hit everyone from me please the next time you see them (if you don't mind) :) Especially those who haven't been posting recently. Thanks :)

 Good stuff :) Life is flowing the way it should be. Man, this was the nicest resume of the news that I'm missing and I could picture every one mentioned cristal clearly :). What about me, well, life sucks because I can't get a stupid cell phone here since I don't have a certain card from the gouv. that I will get only in 25 days! And it's VERY enoying cause this card is proof of one's existence in France, and those who do not have it, are not even cosidered like people here. (damn mentality). Oh, yes, no comments on the last sentense, please. So I guess I will not be 'connected' as they call it here for the next 25 days or so, because I'm not getting a fixed phone. Hi Viv. Yeah, Pat e-mailed me recently, she is doing fine. Besides that, I still have a habbit of getting to the lounge through 'vladster.net' :)

 IT IS FUCKING HOT IN MONTREAL. I'M SERIOUS. HOT AND WET. #include (arroganceStdLib) printf(" I don't know hwhat I have done and hwhat I'm doing. Everything is good with me my friends. My life right now is as calm as the Pacific ocean. There've been changes on all fronts and in all circles of the people I know.

Sarah studies her ...hm... off. She is pretty happy about her physiology (I mean, the program she studies :); and she still has that happy and confused face. I promissed to drive her to the movies as soon as my car is done. Vivianne despises me and says hi to Andrei. Danny is a nerd now. Seriously. He wears glasses and studies every day. The coffee place still exists. A certain influx of fresh blood has taken place. Patricia is gone to Mexico without even saying bye. Like nothing ever happened between us. Ceasar salad is just as popular in the Mech. Eng. cafeteria :)). They even served it in the blues pub once. Ivan is cool and angry. He always finds a reason to be angry with me. First, I sniffed the last binaca we had at the chalet, then it was Patricia; now I have a better computer and office xp on it. Ok, enough. Gonna go to class.

 o-o... I really should not enter into this subject of converation. :) But, where the fuck are all the damn posts?? People, are you alive or dead? Hello!!!!!!!!!! Knok-knok��anybody there? And how come people are finding this site in google or yahoo by typing, for instance: "Donkey Monkey Sex", or "picknick table drawings", or "anew sex picture now", or " "lionking" cracked game", or "pics of my wife screwing lot of guys", "piano pics jpg sex", and a good one was : "vlad wanted" :) Jis, people; this looks exactly like a lounge of ex-Vanier students. :) By the way, is it snowing already in Montreal? Are you shoviling the streets yet; or is it just lots of dirty dry leaves everywhere and pooring rain and wind and cold? Well, I guess I should go tanning outside now. :) Alright, have a good "sejour" in Canada, and hope to see you all soon... heh!

 go forth my son, and wreak havoc upon the subject of your dissatisfaction. May he grasp the sorrows of his existence.

 Hey dudes, I'm back with my last ex-girl-friend (just to keep you posted). And Vlad, come on, maybe if you'll say sorry to all the people and have a heart to heart convrsation (at least from your family's side) every thing won't look so bad. Cheers!!!! By the way, what about Viv joining the blog? :)

 Yeah, i meant that sex is good at all times (i hope so), but when we are young we kind of explicitely look for it. Otherwise, i can't wait untill i'm 70. Oh, and Vova, i just realized, were you jalous a few posts ago when talking about the guy? That doesn't look like you...

 Sex is supposedly amazing when you are old according to many couples over 70 year old. The vitality is not the same as when you are young but the experience makes it all!

 The emotional aspect of the first time does not exist anymore once you acquire knowledge or experience. The only emotional aspect of the first time I can imagine coming back, is the thrill of seeing the girl naked for the first time.

 And Audrey is quite to the point here.

 .

 Well, to my opinion, Salsaman is the closest to the ultimate truth about Love. As per sex, I don't think (or at least I hope it's not true) that sex is good only when we are young. Come on guys we are but a tiny bit from figuring out what love is ultimately. I need more input. Next problem to solve: how to reach world peace.

 I guess that's Hwhy Mr. Danby-Smith teaches Ethical Choices at Vanier College and not Applied Ethics for Corporate Leaders at Cambridge University. RE: the guy I guess I'm in trouble then :))).

 Vova, I saw the guy. He looks very familiar, but he doesn't look like someone who would act like Andrei...

 Wow... I feel like istarted a hot subject here. Btw, Andrei my future is not uncertain. It is rather dificult for me to choose the path to arrive to the end result. To respond to the previous discussion, money cannot be a consequence but rather a tool to satisfy one's needs. It is earned thorugh hard and dedicated work, but Vlad if you remember Michael Danby-Smith used to say that money is not a end in itself, only a means to an end. I agree with that and money can't be " the only ultimate objective ". It has no intrinsic worth in itself and your ultimate objective is what you want to do with the money. Therefore, you're rich when you know how to use your cash. Now, Andrrei, i'm not quite sure how the sex experience relates to the geographical location, but don't tell me that you refused simply fucking when you didn't find any love from your partner. Sex is one of the phisiological, vital human needs w/o which we wouldn't be here discussing all this crap. Love, on the other hand, is a result of phisical attraction and constant interaction with your partner and sex is part of that interaction. So sex by itself is good when we are young. ciao P.S. I didn't make it to the finals last night at the competition, tough luck, wil do better next time.

 I'm refering to the emotional aspect of the first time. The knowledge, or experience may be great.

 To the female population here: how would you like a guy, for whom every time would be like the first time . I mean, sure Andrei, you've got a point there, yet, moreover quite for instance. Miss Pat Tedford would love your writing :).

 What's wrong with that? Once in high school, our teacher told us that some people stay virgins their entire lives. And not because they never made love, no. They're virigns, because every time for them is a like first time, so their souls and hearts always stay virgin. I never could get what he meat by that. I still don't quite get it now. Yet, I'm trying to change my way of seeing things. Yes, just trying, because the hard thing is to continually* stay in the right perspective, and to love in every instant of life. ... By the way, how did we get from Jeka's uncertain future to a convesation about meaning of sex and love? I don't know; nevertheless, I hope that our blabbing will help you make your* right choice, Jeka.

 Here goes Andrei with his pubescent wetness again. Well, I definitely lack the unique European doggy-style perspective , ya know. Some serious shit there, you see. Moreover. Yet. Sex without love my ass. Somebody here will die a virgin.

 Nonesense. Sex is nothing special, nither is money. Maybe if you'll live in Europe for some time, you'll also understand. Life can be different and is different for everyone (duh...) , yet happy life always brings same feeling of happiness and joy to all the people in the same way. Money is not a feeling. Besides, it's impossible to buy fee good (in definition of good) feelings. Love, for instance, is a feeling that makes one happy. Feeling of accomplishment, feeling of glory, feeling of respect, all of them make people happy. Can money evoke them? No, yet, money can evoke greed, jealousy, hatered... Moreover, sex. Sex without love. I'm sure you know what I'm talking about. It's called fucking. Tell me, what do you feel when you just fuck? Do you feel happy? Do you feel love towards your partner? Or do you just feel desire (before fucking), and feeling of domination while fucking doggy style and when the girl is sucking you on her knees. Now, if you're a girl reading this, what do you feel when you to the latter? Do you feel nasty, or do you not feel at all, because your clit distracts your thoughts due to uncontrolled body reactions to nerve impulses? Did you ever wonder why we call desire for sex the animal instinct ? Anyway, happiness is a consequence of love, and hard dedicated work that one enjoys and loves. Money and sex can also be a consequence of hard dedicated work, yet, will money and sex be a consequence of one's happiness??

 hey, I'm totally a-OK in that respect. It's just the way it works, eh? I didn't realize my post looked like I'm desperate or something.

 whoa there vladman, someone get this guy a female, or if you do have a girlfriend, vlad, then what the hell..??

 Money (as in M-O-N-E-Y) will never be a consequence of anything but hard and dedicated work. Exploring different opportunities can and will distract you from the ultimate objective, which is MONEY. Liking what you do is pretty straight forward: less work and more money. And sex. Everything in this life is sex. Money is good, protected sex. It's good for you. So, drop that pussy business of exploring opportunities and go do some math.

 Hey, dude!! I want to come watch!! :)) Fais, I don't really agree with simply starting working and due to the money flow, the happiness' flow as well. I think that people should always tend towards what they like, especially when they work, and explore different opportinities, of what they think they like, regadless of the outcome. Money will just be a consequence.

 Thanks for advice Fais. Latest updates: i am gonna perform at Club Med tomorrow (Cha Cha competition), so if anyone is interested in watching come for about 10:30pm. It had to be initially next week, but there has been last minute changes. Maybe next week, i'll be performing for the second time. So it's in front of simons on Ste-Catherine street, i think there is a $5 admission fee.

 No Andrei, I do not. Thanx for asking, I'm still wondering what exactly repulses women from me. Funny!!! About your futur salsa, good question, apprently once you start working and the cash rolls in, you apparently, and I say , apparently like it very much.

 Hello Andrei! Not that I can update you about anyone else but myself, due to the fact that since you left I talk to you more often than to the people living "few blocks away" as opposed to a few thosand miles, but if you're really anxious to know, I do use protection. I don't see why it would bother you that much, but thanks for your such caring attitude anyway. Thinking deeply, lately I have come to realize that I still don't have a clear picture of my so-called future, well...future. That's kind of scary, I found, since I am spending a lot of money on education, but really don't see myself working 9 to 5 in an office and get a 3-week paid vacation to go away just to come back to the same stupid office. On the other hand, alternatives to such life style don't appear quite clear to me, in terms of their profitability and satisfaction, even though I had people confirm to me the opposite. So does anyone else feel the same way? Any feedback at all? Anyone cares?

 hmmm... I see a lot of people are eager to respond to me...

 I have a math test in 1 hour and 10 minutes. It's my third exam today. Funny, I'm sort of beyond stress, yet, I didn't even have time to stress in the first place. Well, since everybody has finished his/her midterms, more-or-less, and can express them selves freely; I'm curious, Waj, are you still with Heather? Fais, are do you have a "petite amie"? Jeka, do you use protection? Doris, any luck? Ivan, what about you? Josee, on the other hand, never mind. Audrey+Vlad, well nothing new. Who else? Any other active members of the blog? Igar, are you still running after unexperienced young russian girls? Are you alive in the first place? Cheers!

 Wrong... Since the beginning of my French period, I've dumped twice and been dumped once. So I'm in +1 so far. It's like a game. The only rule is "you can't cheat your feelings". However, Vivienne has suggested an additional rule, which is " you can't cheat the other's feelings"; yet, it is still under consideration.

 somebody's got a pretty high dumping coefficient

 Hey-yo. It's good to see that everybody is still in action! About me, well I'm single again. And this time she dumped me. I feel that it's ironic, because I hoped that she didn't take us seriously, yet, as soon as I thought that she is also an interesting person she dumps me. Yeah; sure. Yet, MY CAT IS BACK!!!!!!! My sister sent me an e-mail that our cat that was missing since the month of April 2002 is alive and doing fine!!!!! She was adopted by a family on our street all this time (kidnapped in a way). Anyhow, my parents desided to leave the cat with the other family, since they're leaving to Russia and my sister leaves in Verdun. Besides that, hmmm.... Nothing new.... At least nothing that I could publicly announce. Vlad's car blog is an interesting idea, I'm eager to see its development. Also, Good luck to all those who're still in mid-term nirvana!

 I thought someone wasn`t gonna post for a few weeks...

 everybody dies alone http://www.donniedarko.com/

 hey Wajdi, I checked out your favorite porn site. Man, where did you find it. Some goddamn hot hardcore action.. urlLink furniture porn all the way!

 Wow, Fais, you guys are doing well. 25% in Signals is my most wild wet dream. Way to go, Waj. I say we connect a few exponential-varying current inputs into their arses, then "take enough time for the output to become stable" and then judge if the "output" is causal, memoryless or BIBO stable. As for the holidays, I would like to drive to Miami, but I am still unsure about it because of my financial situation. I predict lots of skiing this winter though. Also, ladies and gentlemen! A new era in automobile journalism is about to shed light upon our sorry existence! urlLink CarBlog has been uploaded!

 I have to say hello to all my friends. Kill me for not blogging all this time. But I was so busy and still am with some shitty classes. Fuck I got a midterm back, and the average of the class is 25. Ya thats right, you heard me. 25 Fuck man!!!! students in the class were laughing , going , hey dude i kicked your ass, but both were still failing. funny isnt it. Fuck i wanna drink like crazy, anyone have suggestions?? any partys coming up?muwahahahahah, i am so ready to drink, well i hope my liver is. ways, talk to yall later to ladies on the blog, i send you nuttin but kisses. latez

 hellooooo hellooooo helloooooooo I am the back yooooooooo........I am spending too much money and no one is stopping me, im a consumer whore, yes I am, I buy and buy and will never stop.....mouhahahahaha......im buying a gamecube tomorrow.....why??? because Metroid is damn sexy and videogames kick ass and my friend gave me his PS2....so BOOOYAKA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ok im done ranting and raving........how is everyone doing? Vlad, I say we torture the signals teachers by forcing them to watch thousand upon thousands of radio receivers smashed and turned in to talking barbie dolls....what do you think?

 What are you referring to by saying a more enjoyable outcome. I was enjoying myself all the way last year...

 Clio and I are having another New Years Eve party. Write it down, everyone is welcome. Hopefully, the outcome will be a little more enjoyable this year! ...52! 53! 54! 55!......

 Yo, who has plans for the holliday season...

 vladster@2die4.com is looong gone. the hotbox one is good. I tried to communicate with Roman at his morexyz@vladster.net address, but he didnt reply. Now that address doesnt exist.

 ok, i've got vladster@2die4.com before I used vladster@hotbox.ru Is it right? By the way, do you know Roma's e-mail?

 hm..., nobody else seems to have that problem.. you sure you've got the right address? try the one that's written on the right. anyway, I've got yer phone now. AND!!! I bought (not-so-used) skis! Nice parabolic Elans with bindings and poles for $150 at Shatner bldng. It's the McGill ski sale thing. I'm a happy camper now.

 vovka, did you get my e-mail? Some how every time I send you something, I get a response of 'failure delivery'. and my phone # here is 011 33 1 47 39 69 33

 some one is really having fun...

 urlLink I Forgot To Tell You About My Pussy Remarkably pretty. I have a very smooth, naturally lightly haired mons pubis and lightly colored, petite pussy lips. I've got a clean looking and tight asshole (haven't done much butt fucking and NONE for sale), and would consider exploring anal sex with a gentle partner I trusted. All these guys keep telling me I'd like it, so I figure what the hey. wow. just what i need to go on with my circuits.

 murder is too easy. Damn, I was about to place a bet. In the case of my loosing, I would have to kiss the first female person who would come into the lab. But my opponent, obviously, said it's too easy an escape: there will never be any females entering this forsaken place at 1:20 am. p.s. arrogance is good.

 Hmm... I thought F was the lowest for all the courses, I could never imagine that for electrical engineering it goes down to T. What actually can one do to get such a grade? Kill the prof? :) And Vlad... hm... hmm... I don't believe in sensations; and the hot&young Klemlin and White house secretaries that I fuck all the time are my fucking-reliable sources. Excuse my arrogance all of you, during my two last month of posting. Have a good day.

 Alright, time for my encounters of the day. The one BIG thing that happened today was me purchasing the HUGE BIG BIG Lord Of The Rings box with the statues. It is right now my prize possession. On top of that, I remember that I have 30 dollars off at this movie store, so I am getting Star Wars for free!!!!!!....hmmm, I guess my story wasnt that exciting eh? Well im pretty happy... Vlad, Im gonna help you take out those Signal bastards. We should go after the professors as well, make them feel the pain of bad signal teaching. Also, dont feel bad about EC 1. Just remember to always use a T network in small signal analysis, you can never go wrong with a T :) . So what is new with everyone? I can see Andrei is still keeping up his "ladies man" title. Way to go dude!!!!!!!!! Well, I gotta get back to work, I still have about an hour and a half before I can get out of here.. Until tomorrow, or later tonight, depending how late it is when I finish watching these 5 dvds :)

 Tough luck, Andrei. Heh, you really make me wanna come over to your place and have fun and shit. As for the web site, I didn't expect you to understand. It was a response to Ivan's post, thus, an inside. And even if it were meant for the general public, I don't think you would get it :). Also, a funny thing I had observed over a fairly long period of time. Almost everything that comes out of Andrei's mouth appears to be sensational. It relates to any subject, but especially to politics, and especially anything that concerns communism and former Soviet Union. Andrei always has a groundbreaking statement, like Gorbachev is actually Fidel Castro's secret lover, and (this one is my personal favorite) about Americans giving away cash at Moscow's airports to weaken the Geat Russian Economy. Is it just me or... Andrei really does have a unique perspective thanks to his reliable sources in Kremlin and White House? I think it's just me. Because Andrei doesn't exist. His existence is the star dust; it's all an illusion created by the mad Eastern European scientists to full poor French women into donating ther ovaries to the Fund of International Genetical Improvement. Dear French women, please disregard Andrei and tell your friends to do so as well. Andrei is bad for you. Okkk. The above is the consequence of sleepless procrastination before allegedly failed midterms and overly successful love life. Circuits await me in desperate horniness of biased differential pairs and active-mode current mirrors.

 Oh, dansers, wanna summer job? "Agence recherche pour Animation en bars et discoth�ques (concepts s�rieux et vari�s : gogo, salsa, hip hop, capoeira, br�silienne, orientale). Disponible en soir�e et le week end, prestation en duo ou quatuor. Tarif : 153 euros net. Vous �tes professionnelle (2 � 4 ans exp�rience), Poss�dant ses propres tenues. Esprit d'�quipe, dynamisme, sympathie, sens du contact."

 Everything sucks. I have 131euros left in my bank account , and the bursary will come (if ever it will) in the end of January/mid February. Hmmm... Get the point? Moreover, I didn't have sex for two weeks or more now and one particular girl that I'm running after appears to be a real bitch. (tough luck, heh?) Then, I still didn't find a job that can reverse the slope of my bank account money function. To add, I seem to be willing to subscribe for an extra math course (+5 more hours/week to my schedule), because I find that the course I'm doing is too boring (see the logic?) And to conclude, I'm always hungry, because I'm saving up on food in order to pay my electricity/phone/rent bills. Besides, I don't have any intention of using heating this winter, because it's damn fuckin exencive! Oh, yes, Sunday I'm going to Church. (That's the good news, I guess). Anything else? Well, except for reading the sensless note on communism in Vlad's public diary (sorry, 'sensless' is not correct here. There are simply no links between various ideas, so it looks like a mess of diff. thoughts), including, not having access to response/opinion note link directly on the main page like on vladster.net, everything is fine. Cheers! By the way, did I tell you that now I can access internet only 3 times a week (lenux only, so all win. program files have to be registered on a disket and taken to another building to the use fo for eg. World) Later.

 WOW. Waj is back!!! Well, I'll be doing EC II next semester, too. Provided some weird accidental screwup with marks will let me pass EC I. Signals are BIG. I think teaching Signals here should require a teacher's knowledge of a martial art. Because, frankly, I can't wait to bump into that Signals guy in a dark corridor holding that ten-inch pole Wajdi was talking about. I would talk to him about Parseval's relation and any other relations he might have questions about and dares not to ask them on a test. Also, I'm getting sick of living in the same place (Montreal, that is). Wanna go somewhere for the summer (like... Toronto or something). Also, my grandfather came over from Ukraine for a month. So, I now volunteer as a supermarket tour guide. Cant' wait to hear Waj's exciting story. Andrei, whatz happening in Paris bro? How's the "weather"?

 Hello Hello Hello, Well, its about time I came back, I think so eh? Today I ran in to Vlad and Audrey, and I realized how dumb I was for not posting on the blog. Well here I am. HELLO!!!!!!!!!!!!! so, how is everyone doing? mid terms treating you well? or slapping you in the face? Mid terms slapped me so hard that im doing my work term this semester, so no school for me, and well.........IM LOVING IT!!!!! Just got off a 2 hour Unreal Tournament marathon, I have never seen that much blood before....my eyes are seeing red right now....uuugh. Im trying to get in as much fun as possible right now, cause next semester im getting a 10 inch pole up where the sun dont shine with electronics 2....THE FUN STARTS THERE!!!!!!! Well, ill come back tomorrow for another exciting story from my end....l8r doods and doodettes :)

 Thanks

 Say wHat?? Ya! There are more interesting googlisms for Vlad and others then ones posted. Yet, I would never think of something like that: jeka is the average height and weight of a female wolf but rest assured that she can fight with the same strength of a male And about the money offer, I a got similar one, same amount, same country, but different story. Anyone wants to try? Oh, yes the voice message... I'm sure you got it. I just needed someone to whom I could tell about my thoughts upon some subject. Somehow you were the perfect man! Another thing, I'm into my, so called, mid-terms period. Dammit.

 just making sure it's still up. are you all ok dudes? anyone need councilling? say what??

 ah que t'es comique!

 urlLink Yo. Happy Knew Yeahr.

 Andrei, so, what you basically saying is that you will celebrate the New Year walking the streets in the rain like a fucking reject and get into fights with homeless people for bread and wine? In that case I would like to wish both of your "girlfriends" (note the quotation marks) an exceptionally enjoyable and sensual New Year's night. Of course without you, silly. :)

 Hello fellow bloggers, Merry Christmas (dec.25 & jan.7), and Happy New Year. Paris is doing fine. It's ten degrees rain and sometimes sunshine. Basically I miss winter. But it's ok. Today I accuired a new gf, then decided to be just friends with her, and later in the evening my old gf dumped me for the second time. So from being not single times 2, I'm half single, yet, I'm planning to simply single for new year. Chistmas was good, ate like a very classy pig; almost bursted from oysters, castrated chickens, cakes, salads, cheeses etc. One of my gifts was a guitar. Planning to start playing. Maybe also take some singing lessons. Shut up. Don't laugh. Anyhow, I declined a few invitations to New Year parties, and going to go to Champs Elysees. Meet the New Year in the crowd or wandering the streets. Maybe will get in a fight but hopefully just will just have fun and get some interesting thoughts passing through my head. What kind of thoughts? Don't know. Don't care. I just think that the way one meets a the new year, that same way he will live it. (not in the straight foward sense of course). My final exams are from 22 to 25 of Jan. I have 5 of them. That sucks. Here I'm not allowed to loose any virginities. Besides that...Where is everyone celebrating the 31-1? Who's going to be at Josee's? Viv, will you stat in Toronto? Mu? Fais? Roma? Oh, welcome back Roma, it's been a while. What's new?? I'm sure you've got a pack of nice stories. Fencing, girls, grades, school, interests... I'm not going to be on the net untill end of fist week of Jan, so see you all later! Have fun, and see you all next year!!!! Cheers and best wishes to all of you! Andrei

 hey bloggers, just wanted to wish you all a lovely new year even though we are not all bound to reaching it Vlad, I don't think you are the only one who lost his academic virginity in 2002..what can I say, we were all very horny and could not wait to lose it...what's this thing about Viv joining the blog, I was not consulted, I guess what this means is not only will we have to write stuff, but we will now have to think, count the number of words, check the spelling, consult the dictionary and in some instances change languages...hopefully my GPA can increase by 0.2 after this experience....Happy new Year Bloggers.

 Here I am, in the engineering library. Sitting around, surfing the net, checking the building for "unusual activities and extreme temperatures". Nothing to do, really. There is no one. I don't know why they pay me. Way to go Viv. I've never been to Toronto, but heard a lot of negative stuff about it. Sounds like my kind of city. I met a couple of old Torontonians of Russian descent at the Canadian embassy in Ukraine. They were badmouthing Montreal for its dirty streets, "excessively diverse cultural environment" (ridiculous as that) and an ardent denial of gas station attendants to speak Russian. Go figure. But when you really think of it, Montreal is very much European-wannabe. And it's much farther from being European than Toronto is from being American.

 And a stupid, snowy day it is in the American-wannabe city of Toronto...where the army is on stand-by should another 2 cm of snow fall...Just thought I'd let you all know that all is well, despite being in said pseudo-American city. Had a lovely Christmas and I hope the rest of you did too. Good to know that engineers have a such an active imagination...I'm sure it'll come in handy when you have to present budgets for your future projects (i.e. the money you want vs. the money you're never going to get... ^_-)...Have no fear, I'm quite resigned to the fact that I'm going to be a research scientist with no future...Anyway, on that happy note, take care all and I'll see you in Montreal!!!

 this is another stupid day in our reality

 On an even lighter note... One of these pictures represents what I wanted at the prom night. Guess which one. Reality sucks. Who the fuck needs reality?

 On a lighter note, I think now I can call myself a freelance writer. :)) I write business proposals and am paid money for that. Heh, if only I could see myself five years ago.

 Yes hello my dear friends. I'm afraid I have some good news for you. Vlad is no longer Vlad. Yep. Admitting failure is hard. Admitting a failure that could have been prevented is twice as hard. I feel like a retard. So much for being a not-giving-shit smart-ass. I have lost my academic virginity, emotional integrity and, most importantly, a definitive sense of direction that I thought I was born with. The latter could prove to be positive, because, as it turns out, that sense in my mind was based largely on hype, self-persuasion and arrogance. I am not an engineer. It is not because it's hard. It's not hard. Biochemistry is hard. Enginering (I can only speak for electrical) requires scrupulous and soulless screen-staring and crank-turning; and I can't afford to spend my life doing that. I am not giving up on engineering -- don't get me wrong. I will get my degree and perhaps even do some grad school. Transferring anywhere else is not only unreasonable, but also impossible. The only place that would take me considering this semester's GPA is probably the Arts department. And, although I would immensely enjoy majoring in English, it's clearly not an option. Twenty years from now, I will probably look back at this time and consider this disgrace as a blessing. It brought me down; it destoyed much of my arrogance and crippled the illusion of successful life at no intellectual expense. It also showed to me how fulfilling it is to have someone close, someone who would accept my bitter self-disappointment in a non-judging manner.

 Hey. I'm still alive, and still deciding on where am I gonna go for the New Year. Do you guys have any plans?

 The girl on the right seems to have breasts of different size...

 Hey, guys!!!!! Leaving tomorrow - still haven't finished packing or cleaning. Feel like I've been running around like a headless chicken - this is supposed to be a vacation dammit!!!!!!!!!!!! Ahhhhh...much better. Think I just needed to let that out... Anyway, I just wanted to wish you all a very Merry Chistmas and a Happy New Year. Hopefully, you won't all be too plastered on Ukranian pepper vodka to remember it all...^_- Be good and stay safe!

 hey, what about Piano Bar?? :) Someone gave an idea of making a graph of lounge's activity and amount of posts. But how about emotional changes of the post content? Also, does something look unproportional on the photo? :)) Anyhow, I'm on vacation as well for two weeks. I'm exhausted, but it's ok. I guess I'll give everyone a call soon. Later!!

 If Audrey sees that, she'll kick your skinny butt from here to next Tuesday...

 Well, don't you love hollydays sometimes... They let you play with things you like... Like Photoshop... It goes extremely well with Rossini - Figaro. Ra-La-la-la. Ew... Are those natural?

 Roma, are you there?

 Well, even though it's a little outdated, for I finished a week ago, here's my post exam outcry. Last Saturday, i.e. the last day of exams for me, the celebration has began, even though not much was to celebrate since the finals didn't go that well. We were with a friend from my program and a bunch of "Francais de France". Surprisingly, what were we doing do you think... drinking. However, the next morning I woke up in "someone's" bed wandering whatdahell I was doing there. Don't get me wrong, I remeber exactly what happened, but I had to suffer the consequences for the whole day after... stories, anyone else

 listening: Its a Wonderful World Louis Armstrong

 Yo. I need more end-of-semester outcries. Don't keep your hatred inside, people. Share your emotions. I don't want to see anyone on J.Cartier. Sure Viv, anytime. You know my number. Also, Josee, if you're reading this, sorry for not returning your call. I was in the midst of the Electromagnetic fields fury, a very fragile state of not sleeping for 56 hours, when anything could potentially knock me out of balance. I aced the test though. I have now completely recovered from school. I spend my days sleeping, reading Professional PHP Programming , and playing pool with my grandfather. I spend my nights sipping Grand Mariner and hm... bob-marlying in front of the fireplace with Audrey . Life is splendid, my friends. It's beautiful. See y'all later,

 Hi, guys!!! Ahhhhh...the post-exam crash has finally arrived...And yet, although my last exam was yesterday morning, and I don't technically have to be here, I'M BACK AT THE LIBRARY AGAIN!!!!!!!!! Why????? Why me???? Bloody lab reports - novels, more like...only three of the evil things left to write...but that's ok - no studying required, right? ^_^ Saw The Lord of the Rings last night. Sooooooooo good. As much as I loved Harry Potter, this was better. I'm sure Wajdi will agree. ^_^ Anyway, I'm leaving for TO on the 23rd, so AUDREY (and Vlad and co.^_^) WE HAVE TO GET TOGETHER, it's been waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay toooo long. Right, that's it for now - nice bird Vlad - gotta finish my Christmas shopping.

 By the way! My favorite aircraft has been restored and is flying again!!! It was in NYC this december. urlLink This bird is amazing. (The blue plane on the right is the Boeing 747 :)) Here's urlLink some specs on it.

 This semester is quasi-over. I am about to pull a stunt of the century by passing EM Fields having attended exactly 4 lectures and peering over the course outline for two nights. It was a dumb semester, if you ask me. I'm all good now, except to EC. The easiest freakin' course. I don't know how I could do bad. Let's hope I won't have to do it again. The usual next-semester-will-be-different crap follows. I can't wait to do nothing. This pace is debilitating. I want a good book. Something I like. Like PHP and MySQL stuff. I find reading software books intertaining. Plus, I might as well make some money with that over the next few months. Yey.

 [ There is smoke blurring the landscape on the far horizon. A stench of burnt metal and dessicated corpses fill up the fowl air. A war happened in this location in not a distant time. It is obvious by the absence of life and the silence of death that the outcome was anything but disastrous. Suddenly there is movement observed. Upon closer inspection, the movement is found to be only random agitations of dismembered limbs firing their last nerve signals. There are still lingering sounds of last human cries and haunting sounds of people gasping for air and choking from their own trickling blood from their perforated throats. But there is still a reigning deafening silence that governs the entire show. May these poor souls rest in peace ] Needless to say that exam i talked about in my previous blog was not good for anyone, study or not. sigh.

 yeah, that's Danny, by the way. and he was referring to my voice mail message. welcome to Danny. I don't want anyone to be shy because of the new person here. Continue to write what you want -- Danny doesn't know how to read. Danny, think of a cooler nickname, man. Fais, how d'it go? Hello?

 Ola! Hows everybody,s head is doing, mine,s buzzing a bit , well da its a f...... 6 am friday morning and im at work, like daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa '' hi , my cell phone will be off gor the next two weeks, but i will be cheking my messaged regularly, so if you have SOMETHING IMPORTANT teo tell me leave me a message,,--- reminds me of a looser :) takoi dliniiiii dlinni :) good luck bro.

 Alright my friends, I am to embark on an important mission which will test my guts and base of knowledge. Yes I will go through a test of courgage. In about 3 hours I will do the hardest exam of my biological career. It is the course of molecular biology. Mulanda you must know a little about this. The first midterm class average was 25, and the second was 50. Most likely , the average will be between the both, therefore, I will take a different course to ensure victory. I have not studied and will not . I am waiting for the clock to tick away till showdown. I am trying reverse strategy with this one. Wish me luck my friends. If ever I do not make it back in one piece, I would like to tell all of you that I love you all very much, and tell my parents I love them too. Until the next time. Most sincerely

 dudes... my friggin' head... i cant see ma hends... brign on mroe fukcing sginlas adn stysems, yuo mohtrefukcres. brign on hte siht!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1 NWO!!

 Wha! It's a celebrity blog!

 Yo, wuzz up dudes. It's been 3 days straight that i'm spending in the library, as i'm sure all of you. I actually like finals because that's when i learn the most, or simply that's when i learn. Also, appearently i was on TV, on Teleritmo- latin chanel. Cool, I didn't even know, people come up to me and say that they saw me on TV. I feel like a star...

 Wow, pretty spiffy there dude. And whaddaya do? Aside from wooing the old fat secretary, of course.

 Vlad, I work at Zero Knowledge Systems. Future Shop is just around the corner....So I get to visit them every day, and plot my devious plans to take over their lowest price guarantee. So who ever wants to use my formula of ultimate saving, give me a HELL YEAH and we will get down and dirty with the ultimate search for the lowest price. Well right now, I am bidding for a Cisco wireless card so I can hook up to Concordia's wonderful hubs and ummm use it for ummm "educational" purposes where I am not ALLOWED to use Kazaa, but at the same time...NOT restricted...so its all fun and games from there mah people... Time to get back to work, peace people!

 Waj, where do you work?

 Ok, :) Well, news... -I'm working at a hotel 2min away from my house from 20:00 to 00:00 every night, preparing conference rooms. Not too difficult, good music (midnight bluze (spelling??)) , lots of various drinks, white shirt, tie... Style. :) Paid min=7euro/hour. -School: failing everything. -Girls: no threesums (yet), one g-f who somehow always ends up fucking me (I know, it's humiliating to say for a guy, but somehow I feel that that's the way it is. Probably I'll just break up to stop it.) Also, today made a fool out of myself while being with a girl I really like in school. (Maybe it's more precise to say "a complete idiot and a vulgar pig). -Sports: nothing, but lots of will to do some. -Attitude: sloppy (probably too much fun). -Weight: lost approx. 5kg this week due to lack of food and sleep. Conclusion: fuck the conclusion (oops, do I have be aware of my vocabulary since Viv has joined the blog?) Jeka, I don't know what I have on my mind. (And why would Viv know?? Viv: shhhh!!!) Good luck to all those doing thier tests soon. (I.e. to you all, I guess). Waj, can you steal a laptop for me, plzz, from the future shop? Later!

 Hm.. I always knew it, but then another girl told me her name was spelled Vivianne. Damn, chicks are so confusing. And yeah, I just can't get enough of those sexy bus drivers. All professional and concentrated, mmm... You go girl. How're your grandkids? OK? You know, I want to have mine, too. SLOW THE FUCK DOWN when approaching the bus stop or else { I will disintegrate your disgusting old dry body and pack it into the exhaust pipe; } return: "Bitch"; switch (subject); case irrelevant: Mmm... dead kittens. I love making kittens suffocate; break; }//end of main .text # # SAVE REGISTER CONTENT ON STACK # addi $sp, $sp, -12 #Yoeah, you dream on. Assembly is exclussive for Mr. F., baby. #Hm.. Where was I..

 So.. ya...is this just me that has developed a twitch studying something annoying? My left eye doesnt quit blinking. Bus driver thought i was coming on to her.

 Hello V-I-V-I-E-N-N-E. I welcome you to this world of... and I have a question. What things does Andrei have in mind? I thought he always studies.

 Hi, guys! It appears even after three years, some people still can't spell my name...hmmmm...fabulous friends of mine, what can I say? ^_^ So, just FYI, it's V-I-V-I-E-N-N-E. Don't particularly know why I'm writing this when I should be studying...Evil exams start next week and - like the rest of u (except for Andrei, of course, who has - ahem - OTHER things on his mind...^_^) - I am royally screwed...Gotta love McGill! Anyway, it's back to the fascinating world of microbio I go...Hang in there, guys, it's almost over!

 I am THE here!!!!!!!!!! Well, since I last wrote, my latest project was scamming Future Shop. How you ask? Easy my dear friends. All you need are two things. A Future Shop card and a good solid hour searching on the internet. ahem ahem...now I will use an example: Lets say you want to buy an ATI Radeon 9700 Pro (wooooo...woooow)...and we all now its like freakin 600 bucks at fshop right? Well my dear friends, just look on the internet for legit websites and you will eventually find it being sold for 550 dollars, maybe even 530. Now I proved my theory, so this works guaranteed. Go to Futureshop and tell them to give you the lowest price guarantee, and show them the website. They will lower the price to 530 and give you a 10% discount on top of the reduction!!!!!!!!!! then put it on your Future shop card and pay it over 3 months INTEREST FREE!!!!!! Yes, this is what I have been doing with my free time other than learning Mandrake 9. Which is GREAT to start learning Unix :) So aside from the ultimate geek project, I am counting down the days before my freedom ends and I go back to the ball and chain of electronics 2 and Fourier Transforms.......Fourier is lucky he is dead, because if he werent...OOOOOOOOOOH its not funny what I would of done to that #@$%&. Im pretty sure the other engineering folks in here will agree with me. Well, time to get back to work. Remember, there is no way like the cheap way...RAPE FUTURE SHOP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! for all its worth.... ciao chicos and chiquitas

 Ladies and gentlemen.. As you know, we have something special down here this evening... The ladies' section is getting stronger. Viv is in. I trust everyone here knows Vivienne. She is our fellow Vanier grad., an aspiring Biochemist (or Molecular Biologist, whatever), brilliant writer and sexuality expert. Ok, Ok, the latter is a guess. How's that for an introduction? Wellcome, Viv.

 oh, Fais, would you. OK, guys. The finals and shit. who's up for getting wasted on Wed, Dec 17 with me? I'll buy a big bottle of polish vodka (just for the heck of it), and, if nobody's interested, I'll do it myself. completely. or with Audrey. But she works on Thusrday. too bad. good night.

 threesome andrei! wasnt it??????!!! with another blonde too??!! oh ya!

 Andrei, clarification please...

 I have a funny feeling that someone got into my hotbox.ru e-mail and changed my password. Very bad. (Yes, it was safe, yet i'm not going to make it public, since she know's this site, i'd rather send am e-mail about somewhat new, ustonishing experience; and that's not in the best way you can imagine)

 the one about school or relationships?

 vlad's last blog made me laugh hysterically. other than, wassup wich you all ?

 Hi Waj. Lon gtime no see. I say fuck school. It's not a worthy subject of conversation. I can't wait to get out. My school is where public rape is endorsed, if not enforced; where the notion of the real world is unknown, if not detested. My teachers can't hold up any non-technical conversation without comparing life to VLSI circuit design. McGill Engineering Department is a place for Princeton grads who haven't made it to Intel or IBM labs. It must be shitty to be almost good enough . At least I know I suck.

 Hello all, how is everyone doing? Everyone good? Vlad, how are you holding up with transistors and CMOS technology...is it hitting you nicely in the ass yet???? cause it left permanant marks on me..I have been branded with IC's and Fourier series...... Andrei, how you holding up in Europe? Everything good? If anyone has a worse day than me let me know, cause I went staright from 8:45 am to 11 pm, and after each hour I wish I had atleast a basic computer class or even better some kind of DRINKING class, where you just drink everything away!!!!!!!! yeahl, that sounds good... im gonna go to bed.....l8r peeps

 Whatever Vlad, I guess you just didn't have anything to say. Anyhow, just finished my final exams. About an hour or so. As usual I feel emptyed and dissapointed. I've been studing since the 5th of January and probably managed to screw up. If I won't pass, then I must be a real jack-ass. And the worst is that I can aknowledge that all my tests were doable and not too long, but I feel that I will most likely fail two of them (out of five). Ha! During my last test I left half an hour early just because I really wanted to piss. I don't care. You do. I don't. (If you don't then your not my friend.) I'm sorry, I shouldn't be telling you things. Oh, yes, I have friends visiting from Russia. Today I left for the exams when they still were sleeping. So I locked them inside my appartment, and they had to leave by the window. Two weekends ago I went to London to see a circus show. My second semester starts of monday. I might go to Bretagne or to Corse meanwhile. (If I'll get the money. So far I'm in -200 euros). Anyway, are you being alive in Canada? Who is doing what? Stories, events, everyday routines?? I decided to say in Europe untill august, so see you not soon, but you can keep me updated. Cheers.

 yo...

 Yo Andrei. Don't talk to my mom about your sex life anymore please. :)

 Yo dudes...Tomorrow there is a Talent Show at Concordia. I am gonna perform, as well as all kinds of other people, dancers singers, musical bands. It took a lot of time to organize but it's gonna be nice. An audience of about 250 people is expected. You all have to come and watch it's gonna be amazing. It costs only $10 if you buy a ticket before or $12 at the door. Call me tomorrow during the day if you want to come (514)815-1476. Or go there directly, Concordia Hall building, D.B. Clarke theatre, 1st floor. You have to be there it's gonna be awesome. Doors open at 7pm, beginning of show at 8pm. Later dudes.

 yo, Boris Akunin is actually a decent writer. read his parody on 19-century style novels sometimes...some nice reading..

 Por el amor de Dios, Audrey! Is this what happens when I'm not around to keep u in check? ^_-

 You haven't lived until you've seen Audrey with curly hair imitating "bacon on the frying pan" .

 Yo dude, i have the same printer as you...

 ha

 Yes, it is 12:20 am and I am posting at this time. I don't know if that's the case for everyone, but Jeka is going through a kind of a stressfull time. Let's see...working full time 5 days a week (thank god the pay is good), going to school two nights a week, dancing 3 to 4 times a week, doing homework-should be happening every week-end, competing - as of February almost evry Saturday, got involved with a student committee at school - events are coming up in a week or so. Is there any possibility two extend the day by a few hours, say up to 27 or 28? Anyone knows? P.S. We are holding a talent show at Concordia on the 22nd, i.e. next Wed. , I'm performing. If interested let me know, tickets are $10.

 So Starim Novim Godom!!! Hurra!

 Kinky questions, huh? Well, you can ask all you like...I just may not answer anything...^_- By the way, the elderly man who had an accident at Ste.-Anne's died on an EXPERT hill, NOT la for�t enchant�e (which is rated as a beginners hill, by the way - whoever came up with that asenine rating was definitely drunk at the time...)

 Hey people, did you hear about a guy dying on Mt.St.Anne last weekend? They said he crashed in the for�t enchant�e... , which urlLink Vivienne had strongly recommended to us. Well, thanks a lot, Viv. Too bad we didn't go there -- missed some hard-core action. Also, Viv, I will be emailing you soon with some kinky questions. Be excited.

 whaddup vladdy, my phone changed, its 421-0660, and also 848-2596 which is at the college, where you could reach me the most often. drinks ahoy tonite for me , hehe! later peeps.

 Ok. she's playing hard to get the biiicth...oops I meant the girl, sorry. And for drinking this week-end, I was thinking tonight, but obviously it's too late. May-be tomorrow, I'll give everyone a call if that's the case...later

 studying this weekend. sorry. have fun though.

 That would be nice...don't think I'll be doing much drinking though...where and when?

 Salut Vivienne! Je pense que personne y va finallement. Au moins, c'est ce que Josee m'a dit hier. Est-ce que tout le monde va bien? Pourqoi ne pas faire un mini party avec tout le monde, peux-etre ce week-end. On n'a pas pu se rencontrer tous ensemble durant les fetes et on n'aura pas le temps non plus durand la session... Alors, qui veux boire en fin de semaine? Ciao

 Alors, les amis, bon ski! I strongly reccommend La for�t enchant�e...trust me, despite the name, it's definitely NOT for kids... (you are going to Sainte-Anne's right?)

 Awwww...soooooo cute! How's the semester going, guys?

 Sweet childhood memories...

 Bibi, you're disappointing me.

 Oh I know!...Vivienne is studying biochemistry...

 Wow, Viv, you got me right there! Damn you boichemists, why are you so smart. You know we engineers had a council meeting tonight... and I'm like: "Point of information! Does anyone know why those fuckign biochemists are so smart?". Hm... One thing's for sure: if an engineer wears a bandana, he is not in biochem. Ahem. Yes. There./ P.S. Find two mistakes: Vivianne is in biochem.

 FYI:It's not Vlad in the fake breasts and hula skirt, it's Kato...although Vlad MAY, occasionally, indulge himself in this fashion...you never know with these engineers...^_-

 My idealistic concept of being satisfied with life: Manually flying in a space ship in a very tight corridor, walls made of of multi-million-degree plasma, where any minisclule deviation from the precisely assigned trajectory would mean immediate and unconditional death. Don't roll your eyes. Think about it. You life depends solely on your ability to steer. Since you're still alive, you're damn good. And death is painless. So you're not scared. And yet you continue to steer...

 Next time someone posts a picture of the Great One w/o his concern, he/she will truly discover why the Lion is the king of the jungle.

 whoa! finally a lounge!!!! very very nice. ill send you my assface picture soon vlad.

 I'm afraid it's a little too cool...

 Awww... come on Vlad, we wanna see some of that coconut bikini action! ;)

 Let me guess... it's a picture of you and the two brothers in the kitchen?

 Simba means 'lion' in Swahili - haven't you seen The Lion King??? In other words, I was referring to Mulanda...^_- And as for the missing picture, why don't you ask Kato about that...I'm sure he remembers it quite well - although, God knows, he'd like to forget it ever existed in the first place!

 Who's Simba, and which one is not on the web? You saw this one coming, eh Viv?

 Hee, hee!!!! LOVE the picture of Simba! It almost beats the one of Coco, the Hula dancer...now, why isn't that one on the web, I wonder...?

 more urlLink pics .

 I wonder who's the initiator and who's getting initiated ..

 It's the initiation didn't ya know? Why else do you think were throwing a weekend away in the woods??

 I'm definitely in for the ski trip. Josee, what's the max number of people we can bring? 'cause I can get as many as we need to lower the price. Quality guaranteed. A new LARGE set of interesting summer pictures is coming soon. I'll also have a lot of photoshop fun on a few of them... Mwahahahaha...

 who the fuck is F*** you Cesar? and who offered you to have group sex w/o inviting me?

 Vlad, the couch looks awsome bro, wohho where are the chikkas ? Good luck everyone in the next semester Poushkin

 Hey everyone! I know I've been talking about a ski trip for months but here's the deal: If you're interested, I'm planning a weekend this upcoming week end... We would probably drive up friday night to mont saint anne in two cars and stay at a chalet which I have to make reservations for.... So if you're interested, the two days ski passes and chalet would add up to approx 146$ each if we're 8. So if that seems like something some of you could afford, please make your reservations by calling the clijo motel tomorrow at 1 514 845 3305 or contact the head office at 1 514 668 1337. Thank you and the entire staff at the clijo motel wishes you a safe trip!

 A belated thanks for the welcome on my part, I've been busy sleeping...And I'm afraid I'll have to refuse the more than generous (and tempting) offer of group sex, can't we just all be friends? :p Especially if some of us think snowblading to be more pleasurable than the act itself, are you sure you've been doin' it right cash??...

 Oh, I forgot; the ones going skiing try "snowblades". That thing rules!! Ultimate fat burner and pleasure generator. Better than skiing, better than sex (personnal opinion). Yet, I can't compare it to skydining, since I still don't realize that I did it. If you'll try it, be sure to have lots of snow around, unless of course you're a pro. :))

 Hey-yo! Nice design! So I guess you're an Adobe Pro... Colonel. And that kid on the picture really looks like CaSh Johnny! Wwasted! Merry Russian Orthodox Christmas everybody!! I finally didn't go to church; rather I did some physics!! (also, someone looked pretty pissed a few posts ago... oopps) Good night.

 Oops...welcome anyway

 Ahem... Daniel is actually a guy.

 Ladies and gentlemen, due to popular demand I am glad to announce my return to the blog family for yet another season ....I would like to welcome all the new people: Vivia, Danielle & Cleopatra and wish everyone a happy and blossom new year ...If you wonder why I am so happy, well it is simple: I just realized that I did not lose my academic virginity, hi hi hi!!! Vlad, how about Lee joining the blog...

 Ladies and gents, please welcome Cliopathy, a new member of this bizare conglomeration.

 giv mi van

 Hello! ah...is this the V. Lounge? I mean...did anyone do renovations or smtg? Luks priti cul. Vova ken u chenj mai pikchur, du u hev eni ozer van ov mi or ai giv u van iv u vont.

 Sweet memories of 2001... urlLink Bye Bye VANIER COLLEGE!!! HELLO McGill University!!!!!

 Viv, sorry, had to get rid of your friends. They were in the way... Had to tailor your dress and clone some skin and hair tissue, if you don't mind. Also, urlLink THIS is how you would look if you had this disgusting blondish red hair... I know, I'm an awful hairdresser.

 Yeah it is very nice. Vlad, your picture needs some color. You look like you were brought from the dead. Put on some make-up!

 Out of pure curiousity: why on Earth is Vivienne awake at 8 AM on Sunday?

 Nice job, Vlad. I really like the layout. Andrei, screw you!

 Phew. There we go. I hope everyone recognized their respective beloved establishments. Have a fun semester people. P.S. I am anxiously awating the missing pictures. If someone is not happy with their pic, please provide me with another one (hard copy or scanned), and I will replace it. Later.

 Yeah, I basically have nothing to do. Besides, my resolution for the hollydays was to get to know photoshop. So, I have gladly fulfilled my promise to myself. Just wait and see the new version of the Lounge in a few hours. You will suddenly feel very compelled to write... :)

 Oh, Vlad, do you have lot's of free time??

 Take a picture Viv!! That's the one we need!!! :)) :P

 Face swollen to bizarre proportions�Looking more chipmunk-esque than usual�At least the evil wisdom teeth are gone! (well, two of them, at any rate) As you can imagine, I�m stuck at home staring at the ceiling. Any sudden movements and the codeine kicks in and my head starts to spin� Not entirely sure what they pumped into my veins yesterday, but I do know it definitely made me giddy�Never been drunk, but I imagine that�s how it feels! Couldn�t walk in a straight line, either�Anyway, must go take more painkillers � thought I�d write this while I�m still somewhat in my right mind. Hopefully everything will be back to normal by Monday�Vlad, I'll try and find a picture for you.

 Yo. Skating is fun, I'm so happy I chose to go skating instead of going up-north till Sunday with some concordia dudes and dudettes (that's a funny word, I like it). I am up for drinking tomorrow, unless I happen to have a date which is quite possible. And finally, Vlad don't use that gay picture of us for the new layout... later dudes and dudettes

 Hey dudes couldnt make to montreal this time, happy new year and stuff p.s. i got no current pic

 Andrei!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1 Thanks for the stats review! Also -- AND THIS CONCERNS EVERYONE -- send me your pics, dudes and dudettes! I will be redesigning this crusty page soon and I will need your faces (or any other parts of your body). So far I have pics of everyone except : FAIS MULANDA WAJ VIV (i have one, actually, but you won't like it :) ROMA and the people who are on the team, but haven't been posting forever. You know who you are.

 Yo Fais. I guess I checked the blog too late... my cell is 5704617. Call me anytime if you went anywhere I would be welcome. :) In any case. Tomorrow is Saturday, last time I checked. I've got no plans. We could make it all-men or herd some chicks for warmth -- just give me a shout and I'll call'em up!

 vlad buddy, im flip-flopping between two plans for tonite, havent heard from you yet, until 3:30 ill wait, if i dont, then sometime else we go. cool? later ladster.

 yo vlad, where you go? what time? tel tell tell ... oh and u have cell no.? so i call you and confirm

 Yes!!! I'm in internet paradise: connected for two consecutive days! Yay!! Some funny some not, yet, recent last year's seachengine queries for our blog: vanier student union cegep vladster French students EBAT Igar family "vladster.+com" proffetional gay porn andrei vanier "the v lounge" a book on how bad cigarettes arre bad for you undeclared fan pics lionking xp game dwarf jeka porn knok out mice browzer "ivan is the dog of hate" "bete a deux dos" "The V Lounge"... is getting known in the world of the surf! :) And according to "eXTReMe Tracking", I represent a proud 1.05% of the blog visitors (51 visits) placed in 5th place. Canadians are leading with big fat 50.31% (2430 visits), and 24.67% of shy unknows hold a strong second position with 1192 visits. US military, however, is sharing 21st-28th place with only 2 visits (0.04%) along with United Arab Emirates, Singapore and others. India is far behind with only 1 visit, 0.02% sharing last places with loosers like Switzerland, Nicaragua, Non-Profit Organizations, etc :). Unated States and Russia are as usual tied for some irrelevent 13th position with Brazil (5 visits, 0.10%), outstanded by our permanent readers like Network (Hello Roman), US Commercial (latest bussiness trends) , US Educational (you go amarecain kidz!!), Norway (well...), Germany (relaxation during beer hang overs), Australia (hoping to check out Danny's ass), United Kingdom (Queen's morning news), Japan (somehow makes me laugh), and Belgium... (Ahh.. les Belges ... Just like Newfoundlanders for the rest of Canada, or Quebecors...oops). Later! P.S. Viv, why do I feel the sarcasm about my nick name suiting me?

 Yet another message from me�this time in a language all of you � I hope � understand� Just got home from Toronto. Quite proud of myself as I didn�t throttle my darling little brother � although the thought did cross my mind�^_- especially when he woke me up by spraying water in my face last night�although, in all fairness, I did the same to him the day before� Well, Andrei, it appears you're having a smashing time in France - let's just hope that doesn't hold true for your skiing...^_- Oh, by the way, your new screen name suits you. ^_- As for the rest of you, (although this DEFINITELY applies to Andrei, as well) glad to hear you're all getting geared up for all the studying you're NOT going to do this semester...Right, it�s 10:30 and I�m about to keel over from exhaustion � never EVER travel with people whose concept of �travelling light� is three suitcases EACH!!!!!!!!! See u all (most of you, at any rate) next week!

 Also, guys. Should any one of you have spare computer (PC) parts that would eventually end up in the dump, I will greatly appreciate your generosity. I am particularly interested in video cards, hard drives, network cards and RAM. Just screwing around with my old workstation. Experimentation is fun. Linux rulez. I've been cheating on my super high-mantenance Windows XP lately. We might break up soon.

 Hello to you all!!! Welcome to this new 2003 year. I hope it will treat you well. My New Year's celebration was ok. I met new year on Champs Elysses. It was a huge crowd! People singing, shouting drinking, dancing, pushing, stepping on everyone's feet, etc. Basically some new interesting experience. At some point I thought that some people were stuffed in the crowd, but no, I didn't see any corpses. After that I went to a "bourgeoi" French party. On my way there I bought some boxes with cookies and put them near sleeping bums. Hope there were happy when they woke up. Then the party was fine (as any party with drinking & dansing people, hot girls, flirting, making-out and other social non-sense.) Around 4am I went with my ex-gf to her house and for the rest of the night & day we got back together. On the 1st in the evening I had a dinner with a friend and then, throughout the night, I was watching TV and packing my bag to leave to Annecy. It's east of Lyon and south of Geneva. Near Alpes. Now I'm here for 4 days and maybe I will go skiing if the temperature will drop to it's normal state of -10 degrees, from +15. Best wishes to you all again, and see you this year! Cheers.

 Yo my peeps. Fais, dirknign. Firdya nghit. Yse, On?

 Happy new Year to every body, sorry bit toooooo late , but i got my head back just this morning:)

 Saloute my friends!!!! What is up ya? Yo Efgyeni! sorry couldnt make to new year's, hope you guys had foun! i moved to the burbs. i was busy still moving so zat is vhy i couldnt make it. we having a pre-school opening drinking-o -thon? yes? no? keep me posted. andrei how u doin? and to all the ladies, nuttin but kisses.

 Wow, I never knew I could read Spanish. But I can! It's an easy language, isn't it?

 �Hola, amigos! Espero que ustedes hayan disfrutado de las vacaciones� Aunque, yo s� que no se recuerden mucho de ellas�por causa del alcohol, �por supuesto! ^_- De toda manera, si se recuerden o no, �Feliz A�o Nuevo! Espero que tengan �xito en cualquier cosa que hagan este a�o. �Buena suerte! Y Mulanda, no te preocupes por tu ortograf�a�tratar� de perdonarte�

 oops...forgot something. Nice pics Vova, but that gay picture, I think it should be removed

 Hello my dear friends. Last year (2002) was the worst year in my so long-lived life. Therefore, I made myself a very significant resolution for 2003, like anyone cares anyway. So I just want to wish you all a Happy New Year and all that you want wish yourselves. I mean it would have been possible for me to wish those things to some of you in person if Josee were kind enough to let me back in her place last night, but I guess she was quite "tired and busy". So have a very successful year everyone and keep in touch...

 Nothing is absolutely right..

 I also think that the myth of steady and prosperous future in the domain of study is the primary driving force for most "fresh" students. And for quite a few people, it always stays just a myth... Like, for instance, my studing now of energy concepts in quantum theory (for fun) and my naive idea of descovering something new, like... something worth a nobel price... awwwww...

 I think one should study what he/she likes, as well as something that keeps his/hers consciousness satisfied, i.e. leaves one on the "right" track for a steady prosperous future.

 Hi, it's me and my issues again. How do you know if you're studying the right thing? How does one find out what the best for him/her is in general?

 Nothing exemplifies the nacissistic nature of most primary intentions better than the presence of a web cam.

 hehe, er ist niht dick. Er ist faul, frauline Audrey :)

 German is nice to learn if you have people to practice with and a good teacher . Good as in "who speeks german with no accent".When I took courses, the first few days were dedicated to the familiarisation of the mechanism of the language. You look at the grammar and learn funny sentences by heart such as" du bist dick und faul...eine cola bite! " Then, when you past this stage you need to hear a lot of conversation. A lot! The structure of sentences is specific, like french, but the order is diffrent. No, I don't find it's a hard language, but I find it useless if you don't have anyone to practice with. I had 2 years of German. I can read it, but its almost impossible for me to converse. Anyways, it's a nice language.

 Vlad, what have you done...What is this russian language conspiracy...I can't even make secret posts anymore :( (I even suspect Vlad typing this up, to trick us) The booklet you posted Vlad, isn't the Papal Bull prohibiting Catholics to join secret societies, such as freemasons, or smth ? For some reason the Church always had major beef with Masons, I guess there are some serious matters involved. As for linux...err..royalty-free open source is good...some losers code for you, and then you take their work, customize to your needs and make money out of it.(For example Google uses linux on its backend servers). And those who actually coded it from ground up, get big round zero...nice. Open source and royalty free licneses is an amazing invention, I just love these enthusiastic people.Work, bitches, work! BTW, BiBi, did you study German, is it difficult to learn ?

 urlLink "subway fire kills scores" I just hope no one will have any crazy ideas over here!

 I swear to God it's not my fault. :)

 Ok! After 7 russian courses and an hour of typing on a russian keyboard, here is my first invention: a mini russian story. � ��������� � ��������, � ������ ������ ��� �� �������. � �������� ������� ��� � ���� �������� � ������. - ���? �� �������. - ���������, � ����� �����. 20 ������� ���������. - ����� �����? � ���� ���� �����? ������ ���������� ����, ���� �� � ���� �����. - �� �������! � � ����� ��? - ��, ��� ����. - ����� ����� ��� 20 �������! - 20 �������? � �� ���� ���� ��� 20 �������. � �� ���� ������ ������ ������. - �� ��� ��� �����! - ���� �����? - ��! � ��� ��� ����� �������! - � ����� �������. �� ��� ��� �����, � ������ ������ ����� � ��� ���� 20. � ����� ���� ������ �����.

 Well, that sounds like an organization Andrei would join. Me too, probably. But before I am a mason, there exists only one thing that can delay my going insane: urlLink this book .

 The second story... Well, it didn't happen to me, I was just told by a few people (again from Africa) about some rumers that ran around the places where those free-ones practiced, and that everybody in their city and neigboring villages avoided their "churches" and houses where they gathered and all the surroundings of the latter. They told me that horrible things happened there, but nobody knew what, and that nobody talked about it out loud. Well, that's all the second story, which does sound simply like superstisious rumers of the villagers. However, I can say that the person who is a free mason from Africa, whom I know, was very nice and even attractive, (eventhough didn't have big boobs). She didn't tell me anything about her practice, because she didn't practice anything along with her family. She was just a part of them and went to some parties of theirs, which were just as usual any anything. Yet, you can ask Alex the cool (if anyone still has his bussiness card) he knows her better. Cheers!

 Hmmmm... free masons... I'll tell you two stories of mine... (don't say "oh, dear" it's nothing extra ordinary. So, first one happened in Vanier. Once I asked one of my teachers (before I dropped that course) if he knew anything about free masons. He strangy looked at me, let out a small laughter and told me to follow him to the office. Once there, he told me to sat down and asked me why am I'm interested in this question. I said that for no particular reason, so he smiled (or "usmehnulsia) and laughed again. He said that normally all the rumers about the sicret government of the world (which is composed of free masons) and are not proven and probably just rumers. I smiled, nodded an "ok" and looked at him waiting for continuation. He asked me again what did I wanted exactly to know. So I said that I have a friend from South Africa, who's dad owns an airlane company and whos entire family had to join free masonery "for further bussiness relations of her dad", and that it was cool, but she didn't know much about it. So since it was "cool", I want to know more about it. My teacher gave me deep rapid look, said "uuummm", then stared at me for a moment and replyed that it's a particular organisation but he doesn't know much about it. He aslo added that it is true that people with money and power usually get involved with masonery, such as for example his brother who after becoming a considerable financial in his country of origin also joined the masons. That's pretty much all he said (or maybe more, but I don't remember, so may be something impertinent). All the conversation didn't last long at all because he didn't have much time, yet he suggested to me some books that may interest me upon the subject (that I don't remember the names). That was the only conversation we had about that. A few weeks later, when I dropped his course, he told me to never, ever even think of taking his classes, or going anywhere near them (that's because I didn't notify him about my dropping his course in advance and screw up a entire lecture, where I was suppose to give an oral for like an hour on some chapter of the text book).

 I hate to be so close-minded, but I think that Linux is an overhyped bag of Penguin shit. I don't think the future is bright for open-source geek-orgy products. I think corporate domiantion will prevail in any market that anyone at all gives a shit for.

 operational/accepted, huh? as I understoond - "operational" is one who actually was a mason, ie. guy who lays bricks, and "accepted" just some dude w/o skills of laying bricks. or you mean "real" as the dudes of 33rd rank called "navigator" or some crap? or am I completely blind? anyhow...sleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep. (yawn.)

 Holly cow. That stuff sounds very seductive. From what I read on that site (history of freemasonry), these guys are public because they are "operational" or "accepted" masons. I guess the "real" masonry is pretty tough to get into.

 Hmm...I was surprised to find out that freemasonry is actually public... http://www.grandlodge.on.ca/ what are masons for real anyhow? weren't they supposed to be some secret conspiracy?

 In my dreams, I am a corporate whore. I am a materialistic conformist. All I need from life is a house with big windows, broadband internet and urlLink this baby parked in the back. I want a lawn where I can take-off and land. I wear old pants not because I want to make a statement. I wear them because I can't afford Armani and don't want to settle for Kanuk.

 (continuation of previous post on individualism) So then i informed Carlos that it was equally very easy for me to get the same attire and look as you, and to develop the same pseudo-philosophical thinking and call myself an individual. But, would I be then an individual? Changing your look, as in dress code, or behaviour is not a sign of individualism or conformity, it is simply a passtime. What makes an individual then , i asked to Carlos. By now, he was pretty stumped, for he did not expect to lash back at him with these arguments. He expected me to laugh and tell him his right, right before i worship him. So his answer was then, " dude, the answer to what is an individual , is an individual opinion". Finally, some wise words out of his mouth. "What other key aspect makes you an individual Carlos?" I asked. He remained silent. I said, "your idealogy, your ideas. Your ideas are based upon your knowledge and your beliefs. No one can change that with ease, and it is extremely rare to find someone with the exact idealogy on everything, as you. No one can dictate you what idealogy to maintain. Furthermore, it is extremely difficult to change your ideas as whimsically as your hair or your shoes." "So, Carlos, QED?" he then asked what it meant, and i said, "drink your beer" poker was fun that night.

 urlLink Canadian to train to fly Soyuz. What? Canada has a space program? :))

 I may be visiting Mars during spring break, but that's to confirm. Also, check this out... urlLink the love of an electrical engineer .

 Alrighty Cash! I got your three messages. What the... you have nothing to do, but to call me three times in row? Alright so how did you super duper complicated valentine's day date go. Did they have a fight? Update... I think I'm actually gonna celebrate Sunday. What's everyone else doing? I'm competing the whole week-end. So far I'm second in my category, but I'll provide you with updates later. Oh and Andrei, how long are you planning to stay in Europe for? I may be visiting you, but that's to confirm.

 Mr. Dostoevsky only complicates things a lot.He, just like any other romanist doesn't analyzes them, conclusions are to be made by readers, always. And a good writer is someone who makes you think, IMHO. About wearing corporate clothes. If you get stripped of your clothes, you're all pretty much the same, despite slight variations in size. (I guess it's not the size of your pants that makes you all corporate or entirely hippie.). So, did G-D decide to give us corporate bodies? Unless absolutely random events falls under category of "GOD" too, I do not believe. People just like superstition, hopes for someone to come and save them, do everything for them, etc-etc. su-per-sti-tions. P.S. Devils is indeed correct (or conventional) translation of one of his works.

 All meanings? Well sure then! I believe in"God" too.

 I'm just curious, who here believes in God? (in all meanings of that word) I do.

 I'm with you on that one, Fais. No one is more naive than a misinformed hippie with strong beliefs. Correct me if I'm wrong, but our DNA is lees that 5% different from the rat's. So yes, I do believe DNA is more or less irrelevant when it comes to one's social persuasions. Dostoevski didn't really solve anything. He was a master of ethical conflict and suspense -- no doubt about that -- but I don't think he is a good reference in this discussion. Then again, it's my personal view.

 Individuals, individuals, individuals... We are all individuals because we are flattered to be. But remember that our DNA differs from one another less then by 1%. If one believes that DNA is irrelevant, then he/she should try believing in God, in souls, and in creation. But it's not the point. I just don't know. Maybe reading Dostoevski's works could help. He relates to all such questions all the time and analyses them quite well. Yet, I'm not sure that there any good enough translations to reveal all the subtilities. You can always try. Something like "Devels" or even the old "Crime and Punishment" may do. (I'm not sure if "Devels" is a correct translation of "BESI")

 so this is my funny little tale. I decided to regroup with some past high school friends. We were four of us around a table playing poker, and having heinekens. One of the people present was a brasilian friend of mine, Carlos. Let me give you a little physical description of him. He wears the corduroy pants with holes in the knee joints and the heel. He usually wears a shirt of Chavez or someone of the zapatistas. So he looked at me wearing dress pants and dress shoes as well as a dress shirt. And he said that I was a conformist and decadent. Now the point I raised then was how do you know I am not an individual ? He said well, you dress like corporate people and are not individul man! , so were his exact words. However, he thought he was an individual because of clothes he wore that could raise some eyebrows. So I proceeded to tell him, Carlos I have seen 20 000 other motherfuckers like you, with the same attire and not to mention the same flow of voice and speaking. How does that make you an individual? Im late for class, Ill continue later.

 btw, does anyone on this list has instant messaging client, like ICQ, MSN ? I wanna add u guys to my contact list. feel free to add mine: icq - 172148688 msn - porc_rocks@hotmail.com

 No, that's not me. Vlad Tepes is actually Dracula, you know. Someone stole my name.

 Considering that all these books are physics, and someone we know is a physics fanatic, I thought that could've been ur post. Here comes the clarification. buckle up. ��������� �� 11.02.2003 216.

There. Ok, it seems formatting of the original post is gone, hehe.

 Roman, clarify :). I'm not sure it's me. Waj, the important part in my post is that you're actually recognized by the people who know you. That proves that the first imnpression that the person gets is objective. Anyway. Yeah. Also, I don't remember who said it but here's a good point from my Einstein book: human genius is highly specialized. If someone is a great man of science, you don't necessarily have to accept his authority in international relations, religion etc...

 BOOM SHAKALAKA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! you want to see a noteworthy asshole? Spend 5 minutes, no make that 2 minutes with my lab instructor for my telecom class. That guy is THE noteworthy asshole, no questions asked. Vlad, I completely agree with you. In a way, I find it a bit wrong that we hold to our first impressions about someone. For all we know, the person we think is an arrogant asshole, was probably having a bad day or was caught on a weird day, and they really are interesting people who are nothing like we think they are. It happened to me actually. Last year, I guess I was having a bad day and I was talking to this girl, and a year later after we became better friends she told me I wasnt so nice last year and that she thought I was one of those A$$es...but she said that it was only that one time, and that I was a nice person blah blah blah. It is insane how important first impressions are.....so insane, that it is a bit wrong. Reading this over, I just realized the contradiction I made about my lab instructor. But when I come to think of it, its not really. Beacuse I knew him for a good year and all he was, was an ass. So I stand by my case and say AHEM AHEM......"BAAAAAAAAAAAAM" cheers

 postings under "Vlad Tepes" on www.lib.ru, is this your work, mister Vladster ? If so, where the fuck have you got all these books?

 Let's say you meet someone for the first time and talk to him for a few minutes. That person then expresses his opinion about you in one generic sentence -- without revealing your identity -- in the circle of people who know you. If you're instantly recognized, then, in my uderstanding, you're an individual. Notice that the above says nothing about what makes you stand out. You could be an asshole, while still being a noteworthy individual. It takes talent to be a noteworthy asshole. It take talent to be a noteworthy anything.

 I fell off the chair!!!! Absolutely fuckin hilafuckinlirious!!!!

 virtualave.com They place a huge banner but I know a way to completely get around that. Send me your new email address, I'll send you the code. Also, do you have a picture online? As for grad studies, here's what I think. At this point, you should break your head more about what exactly you'd like to do in terms of grad work, i.e. communications, guidance, robotics, software, hardware etc. And then ask around (including your profs) about what school does more of what.

 btw, anyone knows where can I get decent free hosting (preferably with cgi support) that supports transferring a domain that I just bought?

 My average is still well above average for admission into graduate studies(or so I think, is upper B+'s good enuff?) , which is quite unfortunate, since now I have to break my head over all these choice, dammnit.

 it is hellarious. :) My story was also quite funny but less believable. :)

 Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! JERRY: Tonight on the Jerry Springer show we have a particularly interesting episode! vladster is here to finally confess something to a long-time friend of his Andrei. So everyone please put your hands together for vladster! Jerry: Okay, now vladster you're here to talk about someone aren't you? Vladster: Yes. Jerry: And what is this other persons name? Vladster: Audrey. The crowd SQUEALS with delight. Jerry: Okay, okay, well Audrey, is actually here tonight - The crowd SQUEALS. Jerry: But first we have a surprise for you vladster, because as it happens there is someone else here to see YOU! So let's bring out... Fais! Vladster: What the HELL!!! Out of nowhere Vladster pulls out a knife. Fais reaches for the chair. Out of the shadows Josee appears. Josee: Wait everybody wait! Jerry: Yes, everybody let's just calm down for a moment here. First tell us why you're here Fais. Fais: Because I saw vladster and Josee making out at Piano Bar! The crowd goes absolutely INSANE. Josee: That's a lie! I was home watching "Who wants to marry a millionaire"! Jerry: (raising his hands) Hold on, hold on, I'm missing the problem here...what exactly IS the problem Fais? Fais: Because I've recently been taking part in a sexual relationship with Andrei who has recently become engaged to Josee. The crowd hollers, screams and whoops in an orchestra of orgasmic excitement. Jerry: Okay, okay. Well why don't we bring Andrei out here because vladster had something that they needed to tell them anyway about... Audrey that's right! Andrei: (enters onto stage and saunters over towards you) What's the deal? I saw you outside getting it on with Audrey! You know I'm how I feel about Audrey!. Josee: (screams) What? Why the hell did you ask me to marry you if you're in love with Audrey! Andrei: Because I knew that I could never have Audrey. But vladster promised me that they'd never hook up out of respect for my feelings! Josee: What about respect for MY feelings! Fais walks suddenly across the stage, embracing Andrei. Fais: Don't worry baby, you don't need any of them now that you have me. Again the crowd SQUEALS. Josee: Oh my God! Are you SICK! Josee runs across the room and wraps their arms around Vladster tightly. Josee: vladster take me away from all of this! Vladster: You see? That's the thing...I'm...well, I'm married... The crowd does its bit. Josee: Married? Vladster nods. Josee: Who the hell are you married to? When...when did this happen? I don't understand! Vladster: The other day. In Vegas. I'm married to Audrey. Andrei: (screaming) WHAT!!! Jerry: (grinning widely, makes an enquiry) So...did you have a nice wedding night? Audrey: (stepping back out onto center stage) Well we had sex 13 times if that's what you mean. The crowd squeals. Jerry: Okay, okay. So let me get this all straight... vladster is married to Audrey who Andrei has secretly been in love with for years and years. Now Andrei has recently become engaged to Josee who was recently spotted kissing vladster in the Piano Bar. Now on top of this Fais has just admitted to being in a sexual relationship with Andrei. Audrey: That's right Jerry. Jerry: (looking sternly into the camera) It is times like these that one has to wonder, whether or not these people are aware that they are quite clinically insane. Perhaps we should be spending more on psychiatric health funds in this country, perhaps we should just ban Vegas to cut down on impulse marriages. Perhaps I should get a new job. Thanks for watching folks it's been great but for now...it's goodnight. Queue cheesy background music and fade to black. Boys go here . Gals go here.

 sure ok, an individual on a social scale, what is the factor or the factors that makes someone an individual?

 At the rate that I was going last semester, the only institution that will consider me will be the Department of Geography at the University of New-Brunswick (sp?). This semester looks OK. We'll see how it goes. How's stuff at U of O? Fais, could you clarify the question? Do you mean the individuality in principle, i.e. on the social scale? Or is it more in the "what one's worth" domain?

 If I remember correctly some of the bloggers here once were very eager to continue their education up to masters and ph.d degrees...especially Vlad. Has anyone thought of possibilities to do masters in Europe ? Say in countries like Germany, or Sweden, where education quality is ok, but tutition is just 0$. even for foreigners. I'm still thinking about this one, and I wanna know what do you guys think. Will a degree from Europe be valuable as much as one from Canada or US ? etc-etc.

 The video is actually a short piece of the Vice-Speaker of the Parliament of the Russian Federation's addressing the Iraq problem to the President of the United States during the former's visit to Bagdad in September 2002. What he says here is the following ( literary translation): "Fucking blow-job lovers! Masturbators, faggots!" [This is to George W. along with Clinton]. I'm serious. I can show you the whole thing. My take on what makes an individual is to follow.

 I have a question to all fellow bloggers, and I would like couple of answers on it before I tell you a funny tale. The question is : " What is an individual and what makes one an individual?" oh andrei, i had no other pictures of me on the computer, and i am not in reach of a scanner right away. :)
