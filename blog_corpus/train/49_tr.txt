 "Man is born free; and everywhere he is in chains. One thinks himself the master of others, and still remains a greater slave than they." Rousseau wins the prize for kick-ass intros. Any reader is grabbed by these claw-like words and pulled into the meat of the first book of the Social Contract . This book is nearly laughably relevant to our modern times, especially considering the US's occupation-based empire abroad. I should say, it would be laughable if the consequences were not so grave. It's exactly the gravity that turns my stomach. I mentioned my early inability to get beyond Rousseau the man. I'm still having difficulties, but I'm making progress. I can't exactly squash my feelings about the writer, but anyone who supported Clinton throughout the 90s is well-versed at separating a man's genius from his fatal flaws. I find myself incorporating them into my interpretation of the text, specifically regarding Rousseau's idealized vision of human history, in which our primitive selves were perfect and good until reason came along to screw it all up. An early problem with this romanticized view is that the primitives around Rousseau were indigenous, displaced individuals, and he's pretty condescending to consider them perfect without reason. After Rousseau, and in no small part influenced by Rousseau, Charles Darwin wrote The Origin of Species , in which he posited the theory of natural selection and suggested that all species were not created as separate, unique species, but resulted from adaptations from fewer species. Our scientific cannon has since grown to examine primates as human kind's species cousins, thereby positing that all primates share a common special ancestor. I think this is why my mind looks to primate activity rather than indigenous lifestyles when I read Rousseau today, even if that's not what he intended. It's fascinating that Rousseau posited the first societies were signaled by the creation of families, as if before society was established, people (primates) lived alone. Among the four urlLink great apes --the primates humans appear genetically and socially closest to--orangutans, gorillas, bonobos, and chimpanzees, we can observe today social patterns that Rousseau presumably envisioned as our utopian past. Only orangutans live alone, the others live in cultural groupings that include several family units, but are not defined by blood lines. Considering Rousseau's own relationship weaknesses, it's likely that he so idealized a life without familial obligations that his utopia necessitated that aspect. Among the apes, chimpanzees are genetically and socially closest to humans. While all apes share at least 96% of our genetic make-up, chimps share over 98%. urlLink Jane Goodall documented through decades of study the amazing patterns of the chimp culture, and she's careful to never present this culture as utopian. Indeed, the chimps wage periodic and brutal warfare against neighboring chimp and baboon societies. But it is clear that the chimps have an advanced and organized society. Perhaps Rousseau intended some primordial existence without society, but since symbiosis, or mutually beneficial communal activities, is considered responsible for the leap from single celled organisms to multi-celled organisms a few million years ago, I'd venture to say social living at some level has always existed. Forgetting that I totally disagree with the precept upon which it's based (that family was the first wrong turn from utopia), I do champion Rousseau's attack on born inequalities. Augustine's concept of potential good seems rebirthed in Rousseau with the concept of potential freedom. Rousseau is credited with inspiring the French revolution. It's sad to consider what Rousseau wrote considering the collective people in context with history. Just 60 years later, Napoleon marched across Europe, galvanizing nationalism among his conquered and vanquished people. Nationalism is the root, of which racism forms the branches alongside the extreme possibilities of flag waving on one end, and genocide on another. Rousseau asked what defined a people as a populace, and Napoleon answered their common enemy, a lesson humanity has never forgotten. I digress. Potential freedoms. Rousseau gives everyone a political tabula raza by saying everyone is free and has a right to everything they need. Key word: need. Property is not a need. If only modern society would affirm this! Water would be considered a human right. Maslow's famous hierarchy of needs labeled food, water, safety, shelter, love, and affection as chief among the human needs. Did you know that in Colorado, it's illegal to catch rainwater from your roof? Theoretically, that water has already been claimed downstream. The law is ridiculously unenforceable, should it therefore be a precedent for not allowing gardens, too? Increasingly, water supplies are being privatized so that the state must purchase water for the citizens. Your water bill used to represent the infrastructure needed to deliver the water, but our future most likely involves actually paying for the water at whatever exorbitant prices the owners of the water charge. And what's to come of our fellow citizens if they can't afford the water? It's not exactly something we can do without, like gas or nice shoes. Yes, society would do well to ensure the basic needs are essential and inalienable human rights. These properties, and only these, comprise my own personal utopia. In fact, they're very close to the existence Thoreau found on Emerson's pond. And I do plan to spend some time next week talking about that.

 Plato held that men (I give him the benefit of the doubt by assuming, had he lived more recently, he would have included women and thus said humans) aren't adults until their forties. This week I enjoyed another birthday, and the acknowledgement of the wisdom of Plato's theory. I'm still progressing in my comprehension of the world, I understand more of it each year. I hold closer to Maslow's view of maturation, which was based on experiences under the belt rather than years. All the same, with all I see in the world now that was absent from my view previously, I find myself wishing I could get another bachelor's degree just to immerse myself in the liberal arts with my somewhat matured mind. Back in college, I hardly considered Rousseau a friend. I was a Locke and Hobbes lover, the Enlightenment enemies of Rousseau. I never got past his fatal flaw of having five illegitimate children and giving them over to the state to raise. Now, I can read about one's personal life and, with the knowledge of my own mistakes, put human failure into perspective. I imagine that the private affairs of many, if not most great thinkers were shaky. Brilliance and passion are rough bed fellows. These days, I have to consider Rousseau closer to my values and perceptions than either Locke or Hobbes. Perhaps one reason I so resisted Rousseau was natural teenage rebellion, as his philosophies were a huge influence on my mother, and therefore, my upbringing. My mom might not have claimed Rousseau at the time, but she did claim his proteges, Emerson and Thoreau. In my rural New Mexico home, Thoreau quotes adorned posters and Walden was an apt theme for our animal utopia with countless pigs, horses, sheep, cats, and dogs. Rousseau's proteges continue to influence my life as my husband was schooled early on in a Piaget program, and we've in turn chosen a Piaget-based pre-school for our children. I was surprised to find strong tones of Rousseau in the book I'm writing now, Sustainable Parenting (shameless plug for a publisher. anyone?). I expected Thoreau, and was prepared to claim him. But Rousseau? I have a friend who intends to base his entire parenting approach on Rousseau's Emile . I chastise him because Emile was not a real boy, and what of the social contract with Rousseau's real children. We'll get to parenting eventually. First, I have to wrestle with the pig: politics. If you'd like to read with me, click here for an entirely readable urlLink translation of the Social Contract .

 except, it is. But it's also an exploring expedition, an adventure. It's a small attempt to find the meaning in the odd moments of the crossroads in which the paths of the universe collide. It's a fieldjournal for my life as a cultural pioneer. The genre of blogging was a huge paradigm buster, mixing the fields of social science, journalism, and computer science with the common journal. In the resulting social order, blogging services were created to be free to all, and--more importantly--usable for all. The unit of power, instead of a dollar, became the link. A culture hungry for a voice has seized blogging as their medium. urlLink Politicians , urlLink clergy , urlLink teachers , urlLink students , urlLink comedians , urlLink teenagers urlLink professors, urlLink techies , urlLink engineers , urlLink artists , urlLink writers , urlLink work-at-home moms , urlLink stay-at-home dads , and even the urlLink not-exactly-homeless populate the burgeoning land known as the blogosphere. Together, they [we] represent the largest population of individuals not defined by a border. But where are we going with this? The time has come for the genre to meet the fate that all paradigm busters must by design meet: this too must be busted. Here's our Kant moment: are we an enlightened age, or merely living in an age of enlightenment? By naming the bubble, the paradigm is busted. Pop. Welcome to the Blogging Age. Here's my place to explore our paradigm. Is it possible that blogs are the point of the entire [western?] literary cannon? It must be so! The linear progression (at least by chronological terms) of all that's ever been thought is otherwise a meander, and we aren't so much the inheritors of the collective advances of the human race as we are bumps on a log. The Buddhist in me likes the idea of being a bump on a log, a home for a spot of moss and a nice meal for the grub. The rest of me, consumed in competition with my own potential self, keeps my eyes on the horizon. Move west, young [wo]man! I share today as my birthday with Jean-Paul Sartre, who violently tore open his paradigm by declaring that nothing means anything. We forget, though, that his discovery was a rally cry for humanity to give meaning to our own existence. And here we are back at the Buddha. I've heard you can tell if you're in a room full of Buddhist monks by the shoes perfectly lined along the wall. It's not that neatly ordered shoes have an inherently spiritual property, instead, the Buddhist monk (as well as monks of other spiritual traditions) is called to be mindful of all things. To the degree that even taking one's shoes off is thought about. Or, in Sartre's terms, given meaning. This is my life's desire: to live with meaning, on purpose, to live mindfully. With this blog, I can explore the depths of life, the meanings we are accidentally or mindfully giving to the various aspects of our existence. Even blogging can be mindful and purposeful. Sartre said so!

 Philosophers are obsessed with getting down to the natural state of man, absent of all the layers of culture. Imagine the old cartoon owl licking his way to the center of the tootsie roll pop. one. two. three. crunch. Academia invented a word to indicate these layers: construction. Thoreau also discussed the layers in Walden. "Let us settle ourselves, and work and wedge our feet downward through the mud and slush of opinion, and prejudice, and tradition, and delusion, and appearance, through New York and Boston and Concord, through church and state, through poetry and philosophy and religion, till we come to a hard bottom and rocks in place, which we can call reality, and say, This is, and no mistake." Remembering Thoreau's metaphor for all pursuit of truth, that is, life on the pond absent of society's hindrances, I can imagine him walking his little path from the cabin door to the pond, preparing for his daily religious experience that was bathing. He must have begun to step into the pond and you know how sludgy ponds are at the shore, his feet began to sink. Each day, they'd sink and maybe one day he just stood and let them sink and sink to see where they would stop. At some point they must have stopped when his feet came to a rock beneath the layers of mud and scum. Eureka! This is the true pursuit of humanity, according to Thoreau: to weather the unpleasant process of sliding beyond the constructions of society until we reach the rock, the truth that is ourselves absent the layers. Rousseau was convinced we'd been to the rock before as a species. That up until the establishment of the family unit, the first seeds of society as he saw it, natural man lived in bliss without reason or corruption, on the rock that was/is truth beyond the constructions of society. Again, I'm reminded of Jane Goodall's chimpanzee cultural groups at Gombe. It's lovely as a parent to read the accounts of parenting found among the chimpanzees. The most attentive parents inevitably raise the strongest and culturally most successful children. The attentiveness is comprised of most always being open to play with the baby, grooming the baby with physical touch, carrying the baby everywhere, providing safe social playmates (achieved by high social standing), lactating at least three years. These principles read like a Dr. Sears book. Indeed, a continuum of attachment parenting principles can be found from Gombe's chimps to Margaret Mead's observations at Somoa, from timeout to nursing on demand, from sibling-assisted child rearing to responsive conditioning. Attachment parenting seems to be the parenting method rock, devoid of society's constructions and we're just getting back to the beneficial outcomes in children these methods bring about. As far as parenting is the baseline for all of society, can we conclude progress on behalf of our culture by this evidence of return to our afore-known perfect parenting models? Because I've so idealized parenting for the sake of strong, successful children, I believe I've made the mistake Jane Goodall herself cautions against. The instinct-driven culture of the chimpanzees is far from a moral ideal. Among the chimps, the natural law that determines all social interactions is determined by which behaviors will, for the males, allow them to spread their seed to the most females, and for the females, will allow themselves to have the most babies and to ensure the survival of those babies through adolescence. The natural law is not entirely dark--love and attachment are touchingly shown as essential to survival--but it is commonly brutal. I am left to conclude that human nature is , absent of constructions, filled with much potential for love, but commonly brutal to all those we don't love. Hence, the natural human is not a very good representation of the collective ideals of the enlightened and romantic ages, with the savage fight for survival ripe with infanticide, cannibalism, and even genocide. Instead of constructions of society being the bane of all human existence, perhaps constructions are leading us out of the whims of survival that is savage animal existence. We still tend toward war and death, but the ranks of the moral few are growing, fueled by that amazing instinct primates clearly retained through human development: love.

 The irony is hardly lost on me that Henry David Thoreau was 28 when he left the academic Elision Fields of Harvard for the material-free life of Walden. This year John is 28 and I am 27 and after renting an Earthship in Taos every long weekend and vacation we can muster for a year now, we’re seriously speculating on small pieces of land upon which we can build our own little fully sustainable getaway from society. The allure of the Earthship must be identical to the renewal and peace Thoreau found in his little shed, which by the way, was built with sustainable values as he bought an immigrants old shed (cabin), tore it down, and reconstructed it on his good buddy Ralph Waldo Emerson’s land rather than felling trees afresh to construct his abode. Earthships are built from old tires with dirt pounded into them and stacked to form walls. Discarded cans and bottles fill the holes between the tires and simple adobe made from the dirt onsite covers the tires. Like a pioneer’s dugout, three sides of the home are built into a constructed or carved-out hill. The forth side is entirely comprised of windows and solar panels. Just inside this wall of windows is a long, narrow flower bed, called the jungle, which absorbs the graywater from the home’s occupiers daily dishwashing and showering. The roof is constructed so that rainwater runs off it into a giant cistern, typically an 8 ft by 8 ft circular adobe tub. With at least 7 inches a year, the home has adequate water to supply the family’s conservative use. Thus, with the solar panels and collected water, Earthships have no need for utilities. The most notable detail of living in an Earthship, aside from the tranquility of working with the Earth rather than against it, is the silence. One forgets the noise of the collective appliances, always running on some low voltage of electricity for built-in clocks or lights. Achieving this silence is dependent from an entire Earthship, as houses are built to subsist off-grid all the time, and more common, with minimal help from the electric company. This was a lesson clearly demonstrated to us a year ago when the universe introduced us to a man from Wisconsin aside the big Kiva at Chaco Canyon. Back in the seventies, the utility companies wanted him to pay for the connections to his land because he was outside their normal service area. Incensed, he began to work on developing his own energy sources for his home. By the eighties, he was making more electricity than he needed, and because the government requires electric utility companies to purchase energy from individuals if available (in an effort to depend less on foreign energy sources), the utility company he had quarreled with was forced to build lines to his land after all, but to purchase rather than sell electricity. Now, his entire living is to engineer people’s homes for renewable energy. He explained to us that the road to living off-grid begins simply with using less and less energy from the grid. Every time you have to buy or repair an appliance, purchase the smallest and most energy efficient version of that appliance you can find. In time, you may have your wattage down enough to use solar panels on your roof rather than electricity from the utility company. Just as Thoreau didn’t pay his pole taxes because they would have gone to support the invasion of Mexico by the United States, I deeply believe we (to use Thoreau’s term) awakened citizens are bound by duty to minimize our energy cost because the corruption of energy suppliers globally is the central fueling force of most the world’s wars and economic destabilization right now.

 Watched Now tonight, was very moved by all of it, but especially be the closing bit on crossing the Euphrates. I found out about this NPR story (link) from David Weinberger’s blog. This story is so good. It’s just pure good. Listen to it and pretend these women ruled the country instead of you know who. Imagine we were a culture that would tolerate a dialog that took seven years. Listening to this story renewed my hope in the world.

 Today I felt the purest joy I’ve felt in I can’t remember how long. My son went in the potty for the first time. This emotion startled me, really. I was cheering him on and happy and we were having fun, but out of nowhere joy hit me. It was like the annoying sound you didn’t realize was so loud until it stops, only it was the absence of joy we’ve become accustomed to in our post shuttle accident/war build-up reality. It felt really good, if fleeting. The experience inspired me to once again devote myself to creating a small, private world for my family that is immune to the big bad of the RW. I want to be very careful about articulating this. I’m not advocating retreating from knowledge of what our country is doing with our tax dollars, in our name. What I want is more like Dr. Weil’s news fast. I used to dislike the John Lennon song (name?) because the chorus says Nothing’s gonna change my world. I am devoted to progress, which relies on change and I thought Lennon was voicing that all too common idea that change isn’t progress. I understand now, however, that the song is talking about maintaining your inner peace, your focus despite the crap that’s falling (like bombs in Baghdad) all around you. Speaking of bombs in Baghdad, I found through blogger an amazing blog by a guy in Baghdad (link). It motivated me to look for anything being written by human shields or humanitarian workers there. Found it at http://electroniciraq.net/news/iraqdiaries.shtml

 Ari Fleischer—on behalf of Mr. Bush—defended the tax break/war budget plan with a Kennedy quote. You notice that these people now quote past presidents out of context where they used to just quote the bible out of context? Both methods serve their ends about equally well, that is to add a touch of authority to what Steven Covey would call weak leadership from trying to have power before authority.

 All those actors who voted for Michael Moore to win his Oscar are used to playing a part on a movie, then acting like a gracious, patriotic person in life. They forgot his movie was a documentary, he wasn't playing a part. They're all mad at him for showing up in character!

 It is awkward writing again. It feels clumsy, and I am aware that it reads clumsy too. I used to write extensively every day on the job, and the quality of my writing reflected it. Now I’ve only written occasionally in my RW journal for months. I guarantee this will get better. Writing is a muscle that must be exorcised. Truth be told, that is my truest inspiration for starting the blog. If I just wanted to rant, I could email and talk all I want for much less effort. I am aware of the dearth of writing’s presence in my life. The dearth’s name is children, husband, laundry, life! No, the real dearth’s name is excuses, whose time has run out!

 A few nights ago we stopped for the night at a friend’s house around Dall-ass (before anyone from Dallas gets offended, let me just say that my family loves place names we can snicker about. In fact, the best in the world is Crusted Butt, Colorado). We haven’t spoken with this particular friend for several years because of an awkwardness after a falling-out. Last week I started thinking about him, and about how bad I felt for being way too judgmental about his life choices and recommended John give him a call. I had to use all my superhuman e-searching skills to find his phone number, that’s how long it had been. When John called this friend the guy was so excited, he said he’d googled us the day before thinking the same things! I thought, damn, I’m sure sensitive to the global zeitgeist! Seeing (let’s call them names to make this easier) Lloyd and Kara ended up being easier than we’d imagined. The first hugs were tense, then easy talk commenced and didn’t let up until 2:30 am. The whole experience leaves my soul a little lighter. I don’t want to have people out there in the world with whom I’ve left things unresolved. I recommend this whole heartedly. Now that I’ve crossed “Lloyd and Kara” off my list, I only have one or two others to go after. Checking out of someone’s life (someone you know intimately, until that moment you check out) and then checking back in several years later has been more revealing about me and my life than theirs. Turns out they’re both teachers now. They bought a little house in the burbs, drive an SUV. They’re like suddenly middle class adults. More accurately, they’re suddenly their parents. I have my urban home, my fuel efficient volkswagon, my artsy friends, even my protests and rallies; in short, I’ve tried to end up far from my rural, hick-town upbringing. But am I just my parents reinvented? I like my parents, so it’s not that I would mind if I am, but I like to think of myself as more original than that.

 My blog is only a few hours old and it is already time for a political entry. Bush gave his little high noon speech tonight and I want to throw up. I know what is coming, the whole world doesâ€”and has for a while now. I have one relative who is just angry that he hasnâ€™t started the war yet. Tonight should have been so perfect for my family. A giant snow storm rages outside and the fire crackles in the corner. But our hearts are heavy with the dread of bunker-buster bombs, with the promise of mothers screaming over their dead childrenâ€™s bodies. After the national address, I found myself at the computer looking for music for comfort and I ended up at the songs from the 9/11 tribute. The night of the tribute was so cathartic, so right. The many millions of dollars donated were proof that the songs, literature, and comments were so well put together that they were the salve the countryâ€™s heart desired. This in turn made me all too aware of the aid we are not uniting as a country to give the families that will be destroyed in the coming days. Whether or not each American agrees with the motive for this military action, I feel that each of us should be resolved to meet the dollars we give through taxes that pay for the bombs that will fall with dollars of aid for the individuals affected for the sake of our national security.

 I’m embarrassed that it’s taken this long for my permanent online presence. I’ve always been so proud that I was online relatively early in the game. For my generation that’s pretty rare. We’re too young to have been part of the building of the web and too old to have grown up with it. My very first anniem was assigned to me in the fall of my freshman year back in 1994! Taos is really the best place for my e-coming out. After an extremely long six-week delay, I finally got my promised vacation to Northern New Mexico and it’s being polluted by the impending war. Nevertheless, we’re here and it’s great. The beautiful naken aspen, the crisp air, the sapphire blue skies, and the energy flowing from the mountains renew my soul. Yesterday we went to the grocery store and I found myself pretending we lived here and this was just our mundane daily ritual. The community is very progressive. KTAO is a great radio station, on par with Radio Paradise. It’s the world’s first solar powered radio station. Today we went to World Cup, a fun coffee shop by the plaza, I got a coffee mug that says Resist Mediocrity. Tomorrow we leave but this is where I grew up, and therefore where a part of me always lives. I knew if I was going to make this significant transition, it had to be here. When I was 13 I was staying at my aunt’s vacation home a few miles away in Angel Fire on New Years Eve when I started my first consistently held diary. I remember watching the torch-lit skiers glow down the slopes as I opened the book’s stiff, new pages. Now, years later, this is the continuing of that night. So while I’m sorry it’s been so long in the making, I’m very happy the blog was born here.

 What I realize is there is no congeniality prize in parenting. You do the hard work, you might still win the prize, but just being nice doesn’t get you anything. I think I felt guilty for a lot of years for making my mom the champion of my upbringing. But she was! I remember my paternal grandmother being upset at one point that my last names were in the wrong order. She thought my dad’s should be listed after my step-dad’s name. It was just a stupid petty adult comment, but as a child I internalized it. I was used to—as children of divorce are—being careful not to share information that might inflame or upset the other parent so I didn’t dare bring it up again. I should have because maybe someone would have told me not to worry about it.

 Today there was another school shooting, this time in Pennsylvania. I notice that we went a long time without incidents of this type, but since the war began there have been at least three. Coincidence? I think the government’s public willingness to kill people when it benefits them has gotten into these kids’ heads. We really want to pretend that the country’s international actions have no negative effects on our culture. Unfortunately, mounting evidence says otherwise. This is also my primary issue with the death penalty. If it’s wrong to kill, then it’s wrong to kill. State sanctioned violence is a tool, a construct of politicians. Socrates said it’s better to be the victim of violence than the perpetrator of injustice. But try telling that to the post-9/11 American public.

 I took the kids to this library presentation this morning and was pretty surprised to see some actual moms there because usually I am the only mom among all the au pers and nannies. Two of them were having a conversation about trying to buy a house in Montrose

 Today is the conception birthday for both of my children. My husband has since named this the annual no-sex holiday, just for safe keeping. Interestingly enough, my grandmother conceived both of her children around this same time, so I think I inherited my fertility from her. I wish the IRS honored conception birthdays. It hurt to enter 1 dependent a few weeks back. Pregnancy is expensive, you should credit for that, too. Instead, I’m tempted to just honor FYs their way. So my son is now FY1 and my daughter is FY0 until January 1, 2004. On political topics, Jay Garner arrived at Baghdad for his first time ever today. Don’t you think the person appointed to lead the nation should have some knowledge of it? Maybe some cultural experiences or business dealings at least? He hasn’t even bombed the place, which is the traditionally accepted means of experience in this administration. We wonder why the west has always made such a disaster out of nation building attempts! I think I’ll draw a line around the Pashtun, Afghan, Kashmir, and (what’s the I?) tribes and make a cute anagram out of it with some culturally ubiquitous suffix. Voila! A country is born.

 I am an Easter Egg rookie. Tonight I colored eggs with my 2-year-old son and I quickly realized that the first rule of Easter Egg Coloring is buy white eggs. My freerange brown eggs barely picked up the color as we dipped them in cups. Next year.

 It was pretty cool. I took the kids and they were great. I get such a charge out of busting people's perceptions of where you can go and what you can do with kids. Everyone who sat around us at the game was impressed by how well the kids were, and I kept thinking most kids _are_ good (or could be). It's just the few really bad apples that spoil the common perception of kids. Or maybe not. I think we're young parents and that helps a lot, too. 1)we have the energy to go to an event in a crowd of 54,000 with two kids, 2)we're brave enough to try it. I have to give most of the credit to attachment parenting. It makes for very flexible kids.

 Gameday! We moved over to the mansion and—no shit—we’re next door to the Real World house! The manager of the place has all sorts of stories about what jerks the people who set the house up were. He said the set lights were incredibly bright and they built a 12-foot fence upon arrival. When we got here he took one look at us and pulled out the little factoid about the Real World asap, like that’s the only way he can relate with us youngsters. I have to be honest, I was so impressed to hear it. We recognized the neighborhood from the shots yesterday and were keeping an eye out for it. They told us the house is haunted, yeah right. It doesn’t feel haunted. Will report back on that after spending the night, though. I just want to know why these supposed ghosts always haunt after dark. I have a standing agreement with ghosts that if they want to talk to me, it goes down in daylight. This way I get to be receptacle to the messages from the other side, but don’t have to lose sleep about it.

 We’re staying at the Creole Gardens’ Bordello. Our room is beautiful, even if it causes constant concerns about the fresh paint smell my kids’ dying neurons. We pacify our concerns with the constant air conditioner and open window b/c we really don’t have any other place to stay. The city is full of basketball fans, and room prices reflect it.

 Seen on a road sign outside of Orange, Texas (on the Texas/Louisiana state lign): Terrorists: Don’t Mess With Texas. Remember the Alamo. What a bunch of ignorant dicks. Texas got their ass kicked at the Alamo. I wouldn’t be so eager to bring that up.

 Years ago at a conference called UNISPACE, I presented a policy proposal that recommended creating an international conference center in orbit. The center would maximize the Overview Effect’s value. Imagine, I argued, if instead of Camp David, Clinton could have hosted the leaders of Israel and Palestine in talks from the perspective of Earth’s upper atmosphere. From there, on the edge of space, the leaders could look down together at their planet island, dwarfed by the expanse of the Solar System, at their tiny stretch of land and feel unified at least in geography. It was a beautiful idea and as far as I know was lost in obscurity. I bring it up now only to say that maybe that unattainable objectivity can in some part be achieved through VCs. Maybe here, in the electronic expanse of space, leaders can see each other without the borders and feel united. I am certain the Second Superpower will change our lives in so many ways. I’m just trying to think of some of them, but I know my imagination is limited.

 Well, the tipping point has come for the Second Superpower. Suddenly it’s the buzz of all the blogs and newsgroups. That tipping point’s final straw was certainly Google and the firestorm of words that broke out when Google changed the term’s meaning to emergent democracy (http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/people/jmoore/secondsuperpower.html). So here it is, the movement of the people—all the people of the world!—and we’ve got a front row seat! No, better yet, we are the show! I think it’s so interesting that the Family came out of the closet the same year the Second Superpower did. It’s like the tension is required between these polar expressions of power: one seeks to control information and the other requires the free flow of information to exist. I hate to be such an American, but it does present a dichotomy. So which side do you choose?

 I keep thinking about the news stories on the ways Iraqis are continuing to live out their daily lives despite the ongoing war and the looming threat of falling bombs. The restaurants in Baghdad are still doing business, and the Guardian reports (http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,2763,929142,00.html) that farmers are still working on bringing their harvest to market. I have a friend who fought in the first Gulf War as a marine. He has this can’t-kill-me mentality, like he survived war, so speeding on the freeway is no big deal. I wonder if most Iraqis also have this feeling since they too survived war. The story about the farmers brings to mind the Martin Luther quote (recently massacred by Hans Blix) where Luther is asked what he would do if he found out Jesus was coming back tomorrow (Blix said if the world was ending, which not only maligns the analogy, but infers a rather Baptist-leaning view of the event that I am positive Luther did not intend). Luther said he would plant an apple tree. When his response puzzled the questioner, he explained that planting apple trees was already on the schedule. The moral of the story is supposed to be if you live your life like Martin Luther, you’re in such a good place with God that you don’t have to go repenting and making right if you have insider knowledge as to his arrival. Perhaps the moral of the first Gulf war for the Iraqis is that there isn’t much you can do to keep from being hit by an American bomb, but if you live you’d better be ready to pick up the pieces afterward. After all, it’s not like aid was abundant after the bombs stopped falling. If the Iraqis let their economy crumble this time, the aftermath will be even worse. This is a resolve that has little to do with the propaganda from either Sadam or the US, I believe these people have had to become survivors. So many military theaters have opened on this soil in the past years, they’ve adapted. The US military’s campaign in Afghanistan is flawed for similar reasons. Here is a country that has seen three decades now of constant warring. They’ve seen allies come and go (notably, the US and USSR). Every structure that can be bombed has, so they’ve adapted to not needing structures. Each so-called ally has supported a different form of government, making the notion of governing so weak that only local warlords truly have power.

 Hurtling back through time and space toward the RW in Houston. Just as the blog is not RW, so were my two weeks away not RW either. Time did not hold to its regular boundaries, days took weeks and weeks took minutes. I cannot understand the order this past two weeks followed. Grandpa died on the 14th and we left the next morning for Tucumcari. I had not been there in years. Tucumcari is this very small town in rural New Mexico that under traditional measurements does not matter at all. However, under the new measurements of hypertext theory, Tucumcari matters a great deal because there are so very many connection—links—to the town. I never cease to find people who once lived there or had a relative that did. Everyone has been through it, most even stopped for gas. In Rainman, Tom Cruise lied and told his girlfriend that he was in Tucumcari, New Mexico when he was clearly standing at a roadside stop near Gallop on the other side of the state. Grandpa was playing golf, and had just hit a forty-foot put to close his 17th hole of the day when he collapsed on his way back to the cart. He died instantly of a heart attack at 82 years old. I delivered the eulogy at his funeral, it made everyone laugh and cry so I think it went well. I have to say it was the only personal bit of either the Rosary or the funeral Mass. Two hours of chanting, responding, kneeling, praying between the two services that could have been held for any person [sic. Catholic person] on Earth, save my little two page eulogy. We’ve gone crazy when it comes to dying in this country. The funeral ritual was intended to be a comfort to the living, it came about in a very functional way as mankind gained a sense of mortality and hence needed to ritualize the end of consciousness. How did it become an exorcize of praying one’s soul into Heaven, just in case they are stuck in pergatory?

 After Tucumcari comes El Paso, with a little stop along the way for an overnight in Cloudcroft and a hike along Rim Trail. I’ll remind you that Cloudcroft is along the way because we had to backtrack east to Lubbock, where our car was towed when it broke down in Amarillo because VW in its infinite wisdom cannot alter their policy of towing to the nearest dealer, even in the case of a death in the family. All that angst was almost worth it as we hiked near Sunspot high in the mountains and could see from White Sands to the Organs on the horizon. El Paso is evoking all kinds of kindly memories and renewing my faith in my own upbringing. I’m sure I feel these emotions each time I come back here—I lived here off and on from 17-22—it’s just that the emotions are so welcome in light of their dearth of presence in Tucumcari. There I kept wanting to feel some sentimentality, some desire to go back to old times despite my pleasure in the present. But aside from the little foray my son and I shared at Dunn Park, which in itself was rather wanting, I felt nothing for the place. Not even disgust, just nothing. This was the place I came to be me, where all those significant life experiences happened, or should have happened. At the very least I thought I would feel shame for their memories that still haunt me in moments of self-doubt and at the most I thought I would feel nostalgia and remorse for days long past. In reality, I felt the same as I feel when driving through any rural southwestern town: appreciation for the quaint life unaffected by the moving chains of progress and a vague familiarity, the feeling that I could guess within three tries at what’s really going on behind any door. Take any of these little, dusty towns and I know which exit on the interstate gets the cheapest gas and which is a trick to lure you into the paltry business district. I can close my eyes and tie my hands behind my back and still cruise the main drag because stoplights are just a suggestion that traffic could be present and stop signs are really red yields. I know to glance at the police station—or mama’s restaurant—and count for three cars so you know all the available cops are otherwise occupied. I know to look at the football stadium—where inevitably some faded sign notifying onlookers that the team once won a state championship—for the entire town’s population on any given Friday night. And afterward I know to look just outside of the city limits, all of three miles away from the stadium, for a graffitied patch of asphault where the trucks park in a circle to shine their lights on the kids’ drinking parties, but don’t look for the cops to bust it up because 1) everyone’s secretly relieved to know where the kids are, and 2) the parents like the sense of nostalgia the tradition brings about regarding themselves. And while it’s nice and pretty funny that I know all these things about any of these towns, including Tuc, Tuc itself doesn’t go any further in the memory or feeling department. Now that my grandfather is dead, I don’t have anything to ever make me stop there again, an empty tank of gas notwithstanding, but that adds me to the general ranks of random Route 66 followers. I wonder if I’ll ever take the kids there and show them where I grew up. After the experiences of this week, it seems a lot more likely that I will take them to El Paso to show them where I went to college, maybe where I really grew up. Because it’s here that I feel heart tugs when I drive down Mesa near the University and it’s here that I have memories that flood back on random street corners or at the sight of business signs. I’m certain that even if I had no familial reason to return to El Paso, I would still find an excuse to take a route through the region from time to time just to relive those fond memories. The funny thing spending more time in Tucumcari than I have since leaving it at 15 did for me, was really show me how different my life is now. It opened Houston up again in my mind, reminded me of just how lucky I am. Two days before I found myself hurtling toward Tucum-scary, we were sitting in Hermann Park, enjoying an outdoor ballet performance with a picnic of cheese and wine. The day before that we’d had a huge dinner party after the Art Car Parade that included discussions with educated, liberal people of vastly different backgrounds. None of this would ever happen in my life if I still lived in Tucumcari.

 This is just the funniest thing ever. The Democrats (well, the ones with juevos) of the Texas state senate have absconded to Oklahoma in an attempt to subvert the Tom Delay-redistricting of Texas voting districts. I am elated. It seems somewhere at some point, democrats actually found a spine! The state Republicans accused them of breaking the long record they had set for bipartisan cooperation (that did much to boost Bush’s popularity in the 2000 selection). I for one am happy to see that record broken. Let’s call a spade a spade: that so-called bipartisan cooperation was just that genteel-style niceness the south is so known for, which is the meanest, cattiest, buttery niceness that comes right before the knife in the back. In other words, it’s passive aggression and it’s a dysfunctional communication skill. I say enough with the middle (or, as long as we’re being honest, the redefined right)! Let’s define some positions and claim back that dichotomy required for an honest debate. When you stand up for your position, you’ll hear a creaking sound and feel a little pain. Don’t worry, that’s your spine straightening out and cracking from going so long without use.

 When Eleanor was born, Aidan fell in love with her right along with us. The only inkling of a problem we had was when he would try to hug her and pull a little too rough on her wobbly head. Ever since, he’s been very gentle, always loving. I am so proud of him for his transition. He had a very dramatic change from being an only child to one of two and he’s handled it with grace and ease. Everyone asks me if he was jealous of mom’s diverted attention once the new baby arrived and I generally tell them that he was relieved to have his mom back since the pregnancy affected me so strong. I was so tired especially toward the end that I just laid down and made him play by himself a lot. Since Eleanor’s birth I’ve played with him a lot more. He hears her cry and says, “it’s ok Ellie, I’m coming!” Then he sits next to her and holds her hand and says, “Look Ellie, a video!” He has always been so joyful in his approach to the world, and now he shares that joy with her.

 Happy Cinco de Mayo. Am reading Bird by Bird thanks to PBS. Love PBS, hate how corporate it’s getting. =>another stupid thing politics are doing these days. My mom spends a lot of time with dying people. She says they often look at a corner. My cousin Scott did. He died most recently of anyone in my life. He was a tragic, cut down in his prime death. Mom told him the angels must be coming from this one corner because he kept watching it as his death neared. And here’s the most interesting part for me: both of my babies when they were first born watched the same corner of my home. I think there is a connection. Babies are so newly crossed over from the spiritual dimension of life and dying people are so close again to it. There must be something spiritual about corners. Dying people also often say, “so light.” As if they are suddenly aware of the heaviness of life and as it begins to lift, they feel so much lighter, so much better. So light. There is a corner in my bedroom that I watch sometimes. I thought for a while Scott was trying to come from it to talk to me. So I made an agreement with him, in case he was listening, that he had to come talk in the daytime because I was sick of watching it in fear at night. Then, when I went on vacation in Angel Fire at Scott’s parent’s place and I felt his presence again, I renewed the pact. He’s never come in the daytime to talk, so I think it’s either a bad presence pretending to be him or it’s my imagination gone amuck. We have come so far from death in our society. Like birth, it’s become a thing that happens in a hospital room with one visitor and a nurse to tell you and your visitor how to act. Why aren’t children allowed in these rooms? Shouldn’t they see life in it’s completion? Most people are ok with letting their kids see dramatic deaths on TV, but would never submit to allowing them to view an actual death. The first time I saw death close up was early in college when I attended an autopsy for extra credit. The medical examiner explained that the man we were viewing had been mentally ill, with slight down syndrome. He died of a heart attack alone, but had not been found right away and apparently anytime a body is found (rather than someone attending a person’s death), an autopsy must take place. The examiner examined the body, the diseased hearth—weighing it carefully then placing it on a table, the inner organs. When he came to the liver he announced an interesting find: a tumor. Had the man not died of heart disease, he would have died of cancer sooner or later anyway. And I think, if not of a bus as he crossed the street, but that’s not a valid thought in health practitioner world because busses and streets don’t have morbidity and mortality stats. I stood and watched the entire autopsy, leaving the room at the examiner’s advice only for the part where he sawed open the brain to examine and weigh. I did not go far enough to escape the sound, though. It was an awful sound of drilling bone and then of not drilling bone where I was aware that the man’s brain was being extracted from the head. After the organs were examined, they were placed in a plastic sack, which was placed in the body cavity, which was then sloppily sewn closed. The man’s shirt would cover the incisions and the family viewing the funeral, even in the case of an open casket, would never know the difference. In more traditional times and even in current times at more traditional places, the women of a family prepare a body for burial. They wash and tenderly say goodbye in the process of washing. Younger girls help their mothers, aunts, and grandmothers and in the helping learn how to honor dead family members. Either the creepiness we tend to have here and now about bodies is overcome in this process, or it never sets it because a body is a familiar experience. Because these people are part of the process of seeing the end of life, then the body after life is extinguished, they must surely be more intimate with the spirituality of life. I have observed that doctors, seeped in their scientific training, are seldom very spiritual. If they tended to the bodies, gently washing and honoring after the life they cared for ended, I think this would not be the case. Maybe I’m wrong here, because then the doctors that care for the beginnings of life might also be more spiritually aware, and I do not find them to be. The beginning of life is as fascinating, but also as overlooked by our culture. This beautiful experience brings with it a contact with the spiritual that is renewing and imparts within itself the wisdom, patience, and most importantly, the unconditional love that the coming task of parenting requires. After my children were born I swam for weeks in the high of coming so close to the spiritual side. That lovely, angelic glow slowly faded from my babies’ faces as the days passed and they became more and more aware of the senses that come through the body, and as those senses drowned out the spiritual ones they became less rooted in them. I mourned this passing. By the close of the mothering moon, each baby relied on sounds and sights to communicate with me over the spiritual senses.

 So my parents are visiting and we’re all going to this super fancy wedding because my mom is officiating the ceremony. It’s at what is commonly considered the nicest hotel in Houston. My mom and I went shopping for dresses for the reception and we found the perfect one for my mom. She stood in the dressing room and we both agreed we loved it and her eye goes to the mess of shadows and panty lines and she said, “how do I make it smooth?” I got happy because I knew the answer and it became such a funny, tender thing for me to tell my mom. I’ve had two babies in three years and I say, with motherly experience, “you need a foundation garment.” I just saw the mom of Malcom in the Middle on Wayne Brady and she covered this subject with so much humor. She too just had a baby so she knows. Later, when pondering which size of foundation garments we should get ourselves, my mom asked how one puts it on—because there aren’t any zippers or buttons, just one big sleeve. The Malcom in the Middle mom said her kids, four boys, all come sit on the bed when it’s time for her to put hers on because it’s so fun to watch. Even more later, when I put my foundation garment on, I was reminded of my mother’s ever-repeated advice, “don’t wrestle with the pigs because you both get dirty and the pigs like it” and I think if anything ever looked like wrestling with pigs, this is it. There is so much shame in saying you bought—even worse, wear—a foundation garment. Hell, let’s just call a spade a spade: a girdle. Images of menopausal biddies with black hairs in their chins and overgrown dark moles come to mind. It’s the olden days equivalent of a tummy tuck though so I have to ask if this is the way we will come to think of tummy tucks?

 We drove across the Gorge, down the highway toward Tres Piedras. The Earthship community was immediately recognizable. The Hut Earthship pictured prominently on the website loomed to the side of the road and the sunâ€™s gleam off scattered solar panels indicated the existence of maybe ten or twenty other Earthships nearby. After checking in, we followed an early 70s Ford truck as it wound around tracks of land divided for present or future buildings. Before too many turns, a tan, slim arm pointed out of the driverâ€™s side window telling us to turn in here. We pulled up to what would be our Earthship with no small amount of wonder and anticipation. I really hoped it would live up to our expectations, I mostly hoped we would find a respite from the accumulated strain of our Houston life here. Our Earthship, like most others, consists of a buried wall constructed of pounded earth, cans, bottles, and old tires to the west, and a wall almost completely made of paneless glass to the east. Beautifully curved adobe walls and pinewood compile the structure inside and out. Once inside, red ceramic tile lines the floor, wide plant beds follow each roomâ€™s east edge where graywater exhausts. Skylights and windows open everywhere for breeze. All the materials you see are organic, rather than synthetic. In this way, a Japanese home is brought to mind. Handwoven rugs and a fresh earthy smell greet you at the door. The feeling of the place is comfortable and welcoming. The city begins to fall away from your skin like dead epidermis. The first thing we noticed was the quiet in the air. We hadnâ€™t realized how loud weâ€™d become in the city. Oneâ€™s voice carries so well here, I could talk to John inside while sitting on the roof without raising my voice. The sounds that come to you are like gifts of the wind: rustling bushes, animals calling, clothes whipping on a line far away. The next thing I noticed was that I felt so comfortable walking inside with my son left outside alone that I didnâ€™t realize I did it until it was done. He happily played in the dirt by himself, unattended for the first time in his two and a half year old life! I could see him well through the giant window wall and I could hear every sound he made. Now, the sun is setting. To the west a forest fire, sparked by either last nightâ€™s lightning or deer hunters, releases itself in smoke that carries quickly up above the clouds. It must already be at fifty thousand feet. But I can see it as clearly as if it were right in front of my face, he curls of the dissipating smoke. Around the horizon just a bit to the south the moon has risen, a fingernail moon pointing to the sun like a bow. The skyâ€™s few clouds are blue where the sun has already set on their smooth belly, and pink where the sun still shines. The granite mountains are the most beautiful color of slate gray and blue that I have ever seen. Spots of orange dot them from here, but earlier I saw that those spots are really blankets of vibrant yellow, orange, green, and brown that signal the fallâ€™s arrival and the coming winter. I am from New Mexico, but I have strayed far from this land of my birth. I didnâ€™t know how far until now. My soul is rejoicing at its homecoming. How am I ever going to leave! John opened a bottle of long-saved wine. It popped with the tension of waiting for us and my senses so piqued here, smelled it from far away. The wine is like a metaphor for our New Mexico. Why do we save it for special occasions? Why donâ€™t we gulp it up every second of every day? We know why, but we vow to do better now.

 My husband and I met our freshman year at college in the nineties. As we dated through college, the mixed tapes he made me remained his most romantic gesture. The music on the tapes would sometimes be recorded from the radio, sometimes from borrowed tapes of friends, and rarely, from his own collection. For our generation, mixed tapes were an art, and my husband was a master. A few years ago, as we prepared for the birth of our first child, he surprised me by burning CDs for my labor music. Even now, listening to that music he selected and compiled to accompany the biggest event of our lives is moving beyond description. Heâ€™s still the master. My husbandâ€™s degree was in engineering and my own was in Anthropology, both degrees required its students to become intimately familiar with computer applications in case students were not already proficient. One byproduct of that familiarity is the place computers hold in our lives that people just a few years older than us cannot understand. Our computer is the hub of all activity in our home. It replaced the stereo long ago, and has all but replaced the VCR. Because it holds and plays mpegs, we have no need for a DVD player. It serves as the scrap box for photos and special memories. When we travel, this computer, which is technically mine, must also come along so we can listen to music, play movies, and I can blog the trip and write. My husband brings his laptop for staying connected to work and capturing new engineering strategies the downtime often allows his mind to release. My kids bring a laptop to access sesamestreet.org or other entertaining and educational sites, to play their movies in the car, and for their gamesâ€”too big for my own computer. We are at the edge of not needing three computers when we travel anymore, but only because we know phones will replace all their capabilities within a year or two. Our lives represent the paradigm shift that cannot be diminished by legal or congressional actions. Technology is already so intimately part of our daily routines that we donâ€™t think twice about using it. Weâ€™re not teenagers ruthlessly sharing thousands of files on a whim, weâ€™re professionals with careers who are pretty proficient with technology, and weâ€™re the face of progress. File sharing represents a new level of technologyâ€™s use that, were it not for the ugly spin of the RIAA, educators and politicians would be celebrating. So much money is spent each year on encouraging girls to be more comfortable with technology because the video game culture until recently was the biggest draw into a techie career, and that resulted in a male-dominated technology market. Music and audio file acquisition is a safe gateway for girls to get hooked on technology, but since a 12-year-old girl has been named in a suit for downloading, I have no doubt that parents across the country have yet another reason to admonish their children against the evils of technology. Video games are too violent, chat rooms are too dangerous, and downloading is too illegal. From this generationâ€™s view, we grew up with VCRs, recording TV shows and movies, a job now done by TIVO. We mixed tapes from the radio, we all bought the two-head jam boxes so we could record the tapes of our friends. On a moral ground, file sharing is literally no different from any of this. Legally, I feel the precedent was set to allow such sharing as long as your not making money from it because the FBI warning Iâ€™ve fast forwarded a million times tells me thatâ€™s the standard for videos. That warning makes me ask why the movie industry didnâ€™t suffer horribly after the advent of VCRs. I know the answer, because progress prevailed, and in this country, progress is always capitalistically advantageous. In blogs and threads, we all hear the stories of how the record industry was just as bent out of shape when FM radio came about. Only the then limited power of the RIAAâ€™s lobby kept radios from becoming so standard in Americanâ€™s lives. But now, the power of this lobby isnâ€™t limited at all. Theyâ€™ve led everyone to believe file sharing is costing them so much money, when their profit slide began before Napster put file sharing on the map and furthermore, this slide is no bigger than that of the rest of the country due to the recession and the burst of the technology bubble. Iâ€™m not too worried about the government cracking down on file sharing. Recently, when the government of Iran came down hard on the countryâ€™s 10,000 plus bloggers, techies came together from around the world, connected by the internet, and are working on a peer-to-peer based network of sharing communications, effectively decentralizing the internet from servers. If the government puts just a little pressure on the right people here, the same nature of response might be mixed with our amazing access to capitol, and forever take the internet out of the public domain. Then, any regulation of the web from taxes, to porn, to sharing files will be impossible. Progress always prevails.

 Tonight's urlLink Now with Bill Moyers covers the Bush admin's faith-based programs initiative. In case you've never seen it, Now is a fantastic policy-examining show on PBS. You can tell it delves deep into current issues because most PBS stations across the country temporarily take it off air during thier pledge drives! Here in Houston, Now airs Friday nights at 8 o'clock.

 Last week's Journal Nature included a study in which capuchin monkeys were concluded to have an innate sense of fairness. This times urlLink article builds on the theme to say fairness is inherent to humanity. Someone should tell the administration. As a native New Mexican, I am ashamed that I've never heard of the Lightning Field or the Dia Foundation, but this Times urlLink article can enlighten us all . Now I just have to figure out how soon I can go! I'm afraid the lesson regarding the urlLink arrested, but not charged cleric is don't put yourself in any position to help the army by nurturing their enemy. UPDATE: This charging people who helped the Army at Guantanamo thing urlLink has gotten out of control . Now a translator has been charged with espionage. They say they are recruiting for people to come help, especially with translation, but then they arrest the people that help! I have no doubt that whatever they think this guy did wrong is no more than a cultural misunderstanding.

 OK, that was pretty bad. It's been too long since I had a need to recall my German. Anyway, urlLink this is funny about Germans and sausage that is crammed with caffeine to keep beer drinkers awake. Found it at urlLink Curt's page .

 Remember Noam Chomsky was a linguist before a public policy analyst. urlLink This Guardian article says humans were talking 2.5 million years ago. The real shocker though, is that the appearance of art in the archeological record is the indicator. According to the London Health Protection Agency, ice in more than half the urlLink pubs contained micro-organisms that could cause gastrointestinal problems. Before you go freaking out, let's just remember that if one avoids antibiotics and lives a lifestyle that promotes good bacteria to inhabit the intestines, one can consume a good deal of micro bugs without ever noticing a thing. The FDA in our own country allows a pretty high percentage of bugs in grans and flours because 1) they're impossible to keep away, and 2) they don't do any measurable harm.

 Today's Guardian has urlLink the last interview Cash ever gave, and it's a poignant one. Sylvie Simmons was asked by Cash's label to write a book to accompany the soon to be released box set of never before heard music. She was interviewing him for this project at his home, without any idea that it would be the last. I don't want to ruin it for you, but here's an exert: When we talked about his various operations and health issues two years back, Cash had laughed: "You would think death would be bored with me by now." This time, with the wound of his wife's passing still raw, he was more circumspect. "Isn't life full of passion and woe?" he said to me as we sat and looked out over the empty lake. "It always has been. It's just a different kind of pain when you get older. More physical, less spiritual, pain." His religious faith, he said, was what kept him going - literally what had kept him alive - after June had gone. That and the music, into which all the anger and passion and helplessness and sheer brute force of will was channeled. UPDATE: You can watch the video for Cash's cover of Nine Inch Nails' urlLink Hurt here!

 Am I the only one who thinks the feds in DC are a bunch of sissies for urlLink shutting down today? This is the first time the entire federal government has ever shut down for a hurricane and the storm hit far south of the city! If the storm was still a cat. 5 or even a 4 as it approached, maybe I would be more understanding of the caution. But as it is, I'm just not feeling the love. Guardan has an interesting article on their blogging experiment and on the effects of blogs on the recent WTO events. My first blogger.com friend, Brent, had this urlLink link on urlLink his site . I know goofballs always abound on both sides of a polarized issue, but right wing Christians seem to consistently take the cake in this country. Be sure to scroll down to the Mac story. The ongoing issue of the colon stuff has now come to the point where I am seeking out a virtual colonoscopy. In Houston, I have only found two places that do this: urlLink Vital Imaging and urlLink Memorial Herman Wellness Center . The costs to me are $950 and $600, respectively. urlLink This is one search tool I came across. MD Anderson's newsletter had this urlLink article on how to talk to your doctor that is specifically about colon cancer patients, but applicable to any kind of appointment. I'm glad to see doctors and hospitals encouraging patients to come in prepared with their own research, even from the internet. Not too long ago that was an annoyance.

 I'm embarrassed to say that I've fallen a little behind in my readings of some choice blogs. Today I began to catch up and was shocked to hear of urlLink what happened recently to Salam Pax . It's official, we have become the evil that we most hate. Every war (or military action) since World War II has used WWII as its justification. That's the one war we didn't run out of PR steam before the job was done, largely because of the liberation of the Jewish holocaust detainees. I bet those Jewish survivors are sick of having their experiences usurped for political wrongs. Anyway, this has gone past political wrongs to humanitarian wrongs. Maybe we've sunk to this depth before and I'm too young to remember, but I'm not now, and I refuse to be quiet. What will I tell my children when they study this in college, with the distance of history sufficient to allow historians to point out just how wrong and terrible the US was. Do I say we towed the line the government fed us? We were afraid to speak up while thousands upon thousands of innocent civilians were killed by American troops? This knowledge that history will hold us accountable for our actions was my inspiration for protesting in Houston, Austin, Santa Fe, and Washington DC last year. I wrote all my congressional representatives, the [un-]president, the [un-] vice-president, and the governor of Texas to tell them the military actions against Afghanistan and Iraq were wrong. My words were like yelling in the wind, they did nothing to stop the killing. The only thing they did was give me some small pittance of a defense when my children and grandchildren learn about these injustices.

 When I first moved to Houston in 1997, I lived in Montrose and worked at the MFA. In the time since, I've seen Montrose and the MFA alike change significantly. The inspiration for this change was undoubtedly the money that pumped into the city by the barrel, oil barrel, that is. When the oil bust hit Houston in the 80s, a cleansing must have taken place, pushing all the oil money further out to the safe retreat of the burbs and leaving the inner loop to perish. Only it didn't perish. An artistic flare, the type that is financially prohibitive, thrived in Montrose and the wards became communities of celebrated minority heritage. By the late nineties, I found a Houston in the inner-loop that seemed a different world from the Texas around it. In fact, around that time, NYT did an article about the diamond in the rough that was Houston's cultural scene in Montrose. Nuestra Palabra was birthed out of the Fifth Ward, and the Westheimer festival and Gay Pride parades celebrated what had become the single largest gay and lesbian community in the Southwest. The inner-loop was inhabited almost entirely by ethnic minorities or creative artsy types that weren't even from Texas, not at all the image of gallon hat-wearing oil tycoons the outside might hold. But when I found Houston in the late nineties, so did Enron. Chevron, Exxon, and Texaco also rediscovered themselves here and the technology industry fueled by the internet laid the final nail in the coffin of the richly diverse inner-loop. By 2001 when I left the MFA, the museum was no longer the replenishing pot for fantastically creative individuals, but rather the purely high class social club of its origins amid a $250 million Capitol Campaign drive, for which it sold its soul. Montrose is all but uninhabitable by a liberal arts major today simply because the price of a rental apartment is well over $1 a square foot, nearly $2 in some places. These people are being pushed out to the suburbs at an alarming rate. My neighborhood, the overly gentrified Sixth Ward, got its first Boycott France sticker just this summer. Bastions of the old inner-loop still exist in tiny pockets. But they're dying off fast. Barnaby's (the original, not the Shepherd and Gray locations), the Hobbit Cafe, and Niko Niko's, Corazon, and the Guild top the list of survivors. Cultural outposts in an increasingly capitalized world. This was never more true than today when the NYT Sophisticated traveler series urlLink highlighted Houston . The list of restaurants and shops was largely made up of chains. Haunts of George and Barbara Bush were mentioned along super snooty places to buy $175 handbags. Maybe in New York it is possible to spend that much on a purse and not be Republican, but not in the rest of the country. This leads me to believe the writer set out to find the conservative Houston, and if there is any word that epitomizes best the opposite of what the inner-loop used to be but no longer is, conservative would be the word. Not just conservative in the political, I voted for Bush way, but conservative in the let's follow the trends rather than set them way. Let's go to safe places that won't attract too many people different than me way. With the exception of the Orange Show mention, this article kept its seat belt on and stayed to the well-lit streets. It's too bad, too, because there really is a fun Houston still out there to be found.

 something tells me that right about now, urlLink Bono is washing his hands over and over and over...

 If I were the cool person I wish I was (am?), urlLink this would be my blog.

 I'm researching Maslow for another project I've got going. urlLink This is a fun review of his life and work I came across.

 That was the title of the email my husband sent me this morning. He got busted for riding his scooter on the sidewalk by NASA's version of mallcops. Only, the guys who pulled him over didn't know which rule they were enforcing so they made him stand there while they called into dispatch to have someone look up just exactly how what John was doing was illegal. Even though their inspiration for pulling him over was the moment he began riding on the street instead of the sidewalk because their ceased to be a sidewalk, they ended up deciding riding on the sidewalk is what was actually wrong, not according to any federal or NASA rules, but according to Texas state law. You have to know that commuting in anything other than a single-occupant car has gotten increasingly impossible at NASA since 9/11. Family members have always been able to drive onsite to drop off employees as long as the car was badged by NASA at JSC. This was never the case at many other NASA centers so this was the first to go. Perhaps this was the most understandable of the changes, but bigger and stupider changes followed. First, they stopped letting the busses drive onsite so he had to get out and walk from the front gate. Then, after several months and some complaints, United Space Alliance shuttle service was made accessible to civil servants, which transported from near the park and ride into NASA, but still not the full site drop-offs busses previously provided. The shuttle's caused a longer commute for their waiting time so John's solution was to buy an electric scooter to transport him from the park and ride to his office. This was the first week he's been doing this, and today his scooter dreams were blocked. Until... Amid a little research for his soon to be delivered angry letter regarding the stupid policy, John came across this urlLink blogger , who was apparently inspired to look up and post the Texas statutes on the issue. If you follow the link you'll see that electric scooters are allowed on streets and sidewalks. Take that clean commuter haters! For a little perspective, let's just remember that a few years back, every branch of the federal government was mandated by the executive branch to support clean commuting options for their workers.

 I know, I know. More K Street. I can't get it out of my head. If you haven't seen it yet, HBO is replaying it tomorrow night. I think I'll be re-watching myself. How cool is it that urlLink Clooney is doing the K Street filming himself? I liked that urlLink this Boston Globe article calls Mary Matalin and James Carville yin and yangsters. Slate had urlLink this article about it , the first review I've seen that made valid points against the show: "I've stated elsewhere my worry that K Street will further glamorize Washington's influence-peddling racket and that it will lend too much credence to lobbyists' self-image as wayfarers through a thicket of moral complexity. The inaugural episode did not dispel that anxiety." Salon had a urlLink review that was interesting, but it wasn't really clear if the writer liked it or not. To my knowledge, NYT hasn't reviewed K Street yet, which is a big dissappointment.

 BBC has urlLink this article that asks why Bush has escaped the same ridicule Blair faces down now in the UK re. Iraq. In related news, the UK has a higher urlLink literacy rate than the US. You wouldn't know it to watch American news, but the rest of the world is pretty interested in the recent collapsed WTO meeting. BBC summed up the situation urlLink here and discussed the historic turn this will be for trade urlLink here .

 I'm just reviewing what happened at Dean's site last night after I went to bed. urlLink This nice little story popped up from volunteering time on the campaign trail. Sure am jealous! All the hoopla regarding his K Street appearance reminds of the reaction people had to Dean's Generation Dean rally ( urlLink here's a link to somebody's homegrown reprint since NYT lets links die. be sure to read the last line!). A quick check of the weather shows that Dean isn't the only storm to go rolling through DC this fall! Hurricane Isabel is due to hit the town as a category 4! urlLink Here's a Guardian interactive on how hurricanes form.

 that was crazy. the comments came in so fast that your post was one of many if you refreshed or posted anew. i liked it! it felt like being in a big crazy crowd, a sensation i truly love. the energy and emotion is so strong. i am just truly dissappointed that some people reacted so negatively to that show. as long as we're on negativity, the reason i was able to watch K Street tonight, and not the rerun tomorrow, was because the Bears were suckin' it up on the field so hard that John couldn't stand it anymore. Poor guys. Urlacher is still my hero, homestate boy that he is. But man, he's only one man. Too bad the whole team couldn't be cloned Urlachers. Even if someone does that, it will be 20 years before the Bears have a shot! our friend urlLink Ricky is quiet since Wednesday, but he's sure to blog much hot on such a win as he had today. oh, got to go. things are heating up again at Dean's Blog for America.

 Oh, that is so, so sweet. Amazing drama, amazing documentary. I've been urlLink blogging about it on the Dean site . Here's what I wrote there: Remember when the Reagan book came out and people were so offended that the biographer inserted himself as a fictional character? This is the film version of that. I think execs everywhere watched the 2000 election and kicked themselves for not writing drama that good, then, after picking themselves off the floor from shock (as we all had to), they vowed to never be left out of this action again. That's what I think it was. It's too crazy there to stick around so I'm moving my comments here. I'll add that last night John and I watched VH1's inside shows on Real World and Survivor. This was after catching Bravo's Reality of Reality off and on all week. John said these shows must effectively pop the paradigm bubble for the reality tv era, so what's next. We both looked starry-eyed for a minute, then made funny comments about if you knew the answer to that question you would be a rich entertainment exec. Well, tonight we saw what's next. This is amazing. OK, I'm urlLink posting on the Dean blog again. People are starting to show up who didn't like it. Are they old? Are they nuts? I can't think of a scenario in which people who are the type of people who 1) support Dean and 2) blog wouldn't love K Street!

 Texans 10 to Saints 7. That just says it all. Steelers 20 to Chiefs 27. C'mon boys! How could you let KC score on you like that? Grandpa's rolling in his grave. Colts 17 to Titans 7. Did you see McNair's finger! There are only two teams I really love to see lose in the NFL: Greenbay, because 1) they're the forever enemy of the Bears and 2) cheezeheads are the most annoying fans anywhere; and the Tennessee Titans because, well, the whole Houston Oilers thing. The year we moved to Houston was the year they left and I remember seeing the bumper sticker that said "Go Oilers! Take the Astros with you!" (Because for a while the Astros got cheeky too, threatening to leave if they didn't get a new stadium) Anyway, even in light of my deeply-held disdain for the Titans, nobody but nobody's finger should bend there. I'll dedicate my third quarter beer to you, Steve. In other news, Baltimore and Miami are pounding Cleveland and the Jets, respectively. Buffalo is over Jacksonville and San Francisco is over Saint Louis.

 Here in Houston people have the opportunity to go vote on 22 amendments to the already amendment-heavy Texas state constitution. I think it should be illegal to ask people to go vote on an amendment when the ballot only says: "The constitutional amendment relating to the provision of parks and recreational facilities by certain conservation and reclamation districts." Seriously, that's all it says for one of the props. John said if the state wants Texans to be smart enough to decipher such a cryptic ballot, they better start spending some real money on education! Anyway, urlLink here's a Chronicle site that explains what each prop is about.

 Ok, so I was a little hasty in assigning blame to the president's administration alone. Turns out they had a little help from the urlLink plethora of committees and subcommittees that oversee the goings on of the EPA. Look who just happens to be on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee! George Voinovich of *gasp* Ohio! Guess where this new Homeland Security Research Center is! Cincinnati! Furthermore, the House Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment is attended by two of Mr. Voinovich's statemates, Steven LaTourette and Robert Ney. I can only wonder what these boys traded support for to get this... The EPA urlLink press release on the opening of the center says the site was chosen because of the existing EPA urlLink Office of Research and Development in Cincinnati. Am I the only one who is disgusted that the work of the EPA Office of Research and Development is being farmed out and diluted to the giant waste pool of government resources known as Homeland Security? This is called an Earmark, that is when congress includes in an agency's budget some special tasks that either pump money into a district, accomplish a congressional task not quite aligned with the agency's mission, or both. In the old days, it was called pork. Here in Houston, many were pleased and a few were displeased that the CAIB (Columbia Accident Investigation Board) urlLink named earmarks as a contributing factor among problems that contributed to the situation of NASA at T=0. urlLink NASA Watch keeps a urlLink running tally of such earmarks and said the following about this year's budget: "The Committee has recommended a total program level of $15,540,300,000 in fiscal year 2004, which is an increase of $71,000,000 from the budget request and an increase of $201,393,000 when compared to the fiscal year 2003 enacted appropriation." What are the chances that the government will learn from this and correct their destructive habits?

 I was idly watching a CBS News urlLink report on the safety of food and water supplies in the US when a little mention of the EPA's new urlLink Homeland Security Research Center caught my attention. Those sly presidential admin assholes! They don't want the backlash of reducing budgets within the EPA so instead they'll just further weaken the agency by forcing the budget priority from the environment to homeland security. This really pisses me off.

 In reading across the net today, one can see how profound this man's impact was on people from every walk of life. He must of had the most pluralistic fan base of any modern musician. I did not know until today that Cash had been elected to both the Rock and Roll and Country Halls of Fame. The NPR story is still the best I've seen, but if you feel as moved as I on this sad and somber occasion, follow these links to read as obit writers everywhere tried to step up to the plate and honor his life. Salon said this in urlLink their obit : "Low and dark, devoid of cream and especially sugar, Cash's voice was the sound of black coffee, a sound you didn't know you needed until you got that first sip. And by then you were hooked." NYT had urlLink this obit of Johnny Cash. It includes a slide show. The Guardian had urlLink this obit. The bottom of the article links to a previous Guardian article that's also good: Five Extraordinary Pieces: Five Johnny Cash Tracks You Should Own . urlLink Wired said this: Passage: Johnny Cash, 71 The original "Man in Black" used his rockabilly sound and limited, unsteady voice to become one of the towering figures in American music. Cash's most powerful songs -- Folsom Prison Blues, I Walk the Line, The Ballad of Ira Hayes -- reflected his lifelong solidarity with the downtrodden, the working man and the dispossessed. He wrote most of his own material, but was among the first to record the songs of Kris Kristofferson and Bob Dylan, who cites Cash as a major influence. He won 11 Grammys, numerous Country Music Association awards and was inducted into both the Country Music and Rock and Roll halls of fame. urlLink U2.com said this: Bono spoke today about the legendary American singer Johnny Cash, who has died aged 71. "I considered myself a friend, he considered me a fan - he indulged me. He showed me around his house, his ranch, his zoo (seriously, he had a zoo in Nashville), his faith, his musicianship - it was a lot to take in." "He was more than wise. In a garden full of weeds - the oak tree."

 Special thanks go out to urlLink Brent for hooking me up with urlLink blogback !

 In the time slot after I drop Aidan off at preschool, NPR has been playing musical appreciation bits. Since the Yo-Yo Ma piece affected me so, I’ve kept the radio there more often than not. This morning I got in the car after dropping him by and was pleased to find myself just a few minutes into a urlLink story on Johnny Cash . I really love Johnny Cash’s music, but the man himself represents a sort of an odd bridge between my mother and me. Sex ’s Big pulled Henry Mancini’s Moon River out of his box of his parents old records and Top Gun’s Maverick pulled out Otis Redding’s Sitting on the Dock of the Bay . Anyway, the record I, as a young child, pulled out of my mother’s old box was Johnny Cash’s Live at Folsom Prison . The NPR story explained that cutting that album was Johnny’s last real act of rebellion, that shortly thereafter life and God and June’s love drove Johnny to personal reformation, but he would forever carry the reputation of a bad boy due largely to the album’s popularity. My mother never called on me to play this album for her, in fact the most response I ever really got from her when I found the dusty boxed jewel was a half smiling smirk, followed by a veiled look of what anyone who didn’t know her as well as I would think was reminiscing. She has always been one to never regret and reminiscing implies missing. She must have just remembered how good the music on that record was. We didn’t play the record then, I had to wait until later to play it by myself. By the time I pulled out the dusty boxed jewel, she had moved on toward her own redemption and much preferred Terms of Endearment and Neil Diamond to play the soundtrack of her days. I didn’t hear Johnny Cash again until I was at school in Europe in 1993 and he reinvented himself for a new generation of fans. Levis played his Ring of Fire for a commercial that captured the classic western allure of America. The NPR story explained that June Carter Cash wrote that song when she fell in love with Johnny as one of his backup singers. She was a devout Christian, which made her love for him extra forbidden in light of her marital status. They played the song again and I heard tones of longing desire in it that I had until now missed. Five years after he cut that song, they were married. Five years! Five long years of unquenched (we assume) love. And now we can understand why those five years, peaking at Folsom Prison, were Johnny’s bad boy years. His heart was crying out and the hard living was the only way he could push past that pain. The next I heard of Johnny in my life was on the U2 album. I remember showing the tape to my mother who immediately copied it and still plays it while driving. Finally, Johnny’s urlLink rebirthed anthems found a media that hit her heart in a way they both could accept. His remake was so completely accepted by this newest generation of music listeners that websites dedicated to him abound. A few weeks ago, he missed his scheduled appearance at the MTV Video Music Awards due to health problems. It seemed like a temporary thing. By now you must now what at that point in the car I did not. The commentator began wrapping up the story by listing the amazing career highlights. The realization of what he was getting to was so slow that at first I thought, man, they’re talking about him like he’s already dead. What must it be like to be so old that when you remake your career, people pull from your someday obit file to tout your accomplishments? It’s been raining pretty steady all day and I got stuck in line behind a crossing guard and so there I was sitting in the rain, staring at this slow-moving freight train as Noah Adam’s words hit my heart. Johnny Cash died early this morning of complications from diabetes. I had been thinking of how great the story was and how I would go right home and blog about it. I would call the entry An Unlikely Bridge and write about how my mom and I are out of sync right now, but the music could still bridge us. But those words pierced my heart and I began to cry. Everyone knows the theme of my year has been change. It’s no paradox, I know the answer. You can’t step in the same river twice because things change and people change. It’s all very kitschy, I know I’m growing up because I can see the blanket of relativity that falls over every single relationship in my life. Chronologically speaking, the river is only what it is at that exact moment that that one molecule of water flows over your foot. And your foot will never be the same again. But man. Sometimes people don’t change. They die. I don’t know how to wrap that one up in my head. In May, June died of complications from heart surgery just as Johnny was recovering from pneumonia himself. They were married for so long, a forbidden romance and a great career of paradigm-bashing tunes. I don’t think Johnny Cash died because of diabetes at all. He died because of a broken heart.

 Last weekend I discovered a new channel on my cable. It's not new, but since I moved the TV to the front room we actually get all the channels now. Anyway, the Ovation channel is so great. I love just about every kind of music, except maybe country and that's because my hick roots already got that part out of me, but it often seems the only music represented on TV is rock, rap, and country. Don't get me wrong, MTV is also one of my favorite channels. MTV, HBO, Bravo, PBS and the networks make up just about all my viewing. But aside from a Boston Pops special on PBS, you never get a wider variety of music on TV. Ovation plays it all the time now, and often to video backgrounds. The coolest thing I've seen on Ovation is urlLink Woody Guthrie: A Man in the Sand , a documentary about the making of a new urlLink album of Woody Guthrie songs, done by a great group of artists including Billy Bragg and Natalie Merchant.

 It's almost the weekend, and the smell of pigskin is already in the air. Today's urlLink King Kaufman asks why there are so many baseball blogs, but no football blogs. He means blogs dedicated to the sport by fans. I'd kind of like to tell him because football fans have a life, but that would be flaming. But still, I love, love, love football. I have often fantasized that if I had been born a boy, I would have ended up playing pro. My grandpa was recruited from his little coal town in PA to play for UNM, and every other male in my family played football, so I come about it naturally. When Houston got a pro women's league last year, only my pregnant and bed-ridden body kept me from signing up. But you don't see me dedicating my site to football. The topic takes its place with the other cool and crappy parts of life in the posts--like kids and colons and bush bashing, right? I also don't think Kaufman took into consideration that football fans who are techies spend their online time on Madden when their baseball counterparts are blogging. I especially noted that Kaufman did not bring up players themselves who blog. Outside of urlLink Ricky Williams , I don't know of any. So I took the bold step of asking Ricky himself if he knew of some. Here's to hoping he answers. While checking Ricky's site today, I saw that he has a new radio show in Miami, so if you live there go support him!

 Here in Houston on September 14, Super Happy Fun Land will host "Remembering the Dream: Chile and the other 9/11," a concert by the Culture in Movement Quartet at 8pm.

 I've spent the morning looking into colon issues and I'd like to share some of what I've found. For starters, urlLink did you know that the common person carries between five and twenty pounds of fecal matter in the intestines? Crazy! urlLink Dr. William Sears , longtime beloved author of attachment parenting books, is a survivor of colon cancer. His web site has an urlLink entire page on the many benefits of yogurt, which also delineates which kinds of yogurt to avoid. I never knew how amazing yogurt is! My research on the topic is personally motivated. I've been dealing with ongoing colorectal health stuff for almost a year now. Yesterday at the co-op backyard social, I was just about to pay for my locally-grown, organic veggies when the volunteer taking money asked if I was interested in her homemade almond kefir. Now here's the mysterious thing. She explained that it was especially good for colon health. I know she's a reader (psychically) because I heard her making plans to fill in for another reader at an event a few months back. Did she sense my colon health? Or did she just peddle her slow-moving product? Regardless, I bought it and today looked the urlLink stuff up online. I found urlLink stories of studies in which lab animals' tumors were slowed or even lessened by kefir. I'm sure if the stuff were patentable, pharmaceutical companies would be all over it, but since it's naturally occurring and has been used for thousands of years, the stuff is relegated to the dark realm of alternative medicine. urlLink Dr. Weil recommends slippery elm for coating your intestines and protecting against the irritations many foods can cause. He also names stress as one of the leading colon irritants and recommends biofeedback for management. He admonishes colon sufferers to avoid any coffee, caffeinated or not, along with any other stimulants. As always, Dr. Weil says green tea several times a day is the best protector against cancer. So this brings us to the best of all colon advice I've found today: a beer a day keeps the gastrointerologist away! In a Japanese study, rats who were given beer developed far fewer tumors that those who abstained. urlLink This article on the study discusses the puzzled researchers who tried to reduce the effect down to simple hops with no luck. Seeing as stress is a major colon irritant, I can't believe these guys are discounting the amazing relaxing powers of getting a little buzz on!

 urlLink bmwlaguna had urlLink this on his blog.

 it should be comforting to know your day could be urlLink worse .

 Last weekend I blogged vaguely about my return to urlLink church . The sermon included a poem from this poet, urlLink Taylor Mali . I checked him out upon returning home, he's tres cool. Mr. Mali urlLink blogs and is on the verge of becoming a giant poet celeb in NYC. Since his roots are in teaching junior high, a lot of his work reflects the angst of youth, urlLink like this . I'm recommending him to the giant plethora of teachers suddenly in my life. In other links found today, the Guardian has a cool urlLink interview of Coldplay regarding Fair Trade and Oxfam. Also, Salam Pax will be available live on the Guardian Friday. Wednesday is urlLink Central City Co-op pick up day here in Houston. Today was the fall backyard bizarre and I had an especially well-timed experience. My soul was a little down today, stupid life stuff just caught up with us. Anyway, I met a woman--a new mother--named urlLink Gretchen G. Brossa . Gretchen founded urlLink An Earth for Ivy: Custom Cloth Diaper Systems . She sells custom-made cloth diapers and children's clothes all made of locally grown organic cotton. I bought the cutest little smock-dress for my Ellie, and she's going to start making Mayan baby wraps that I intend to buy for my new mother friends from now on.

 The mailman brought my new New Yorker , and I haven't finished with the last one yet! This past issue was one of the best. The Gardener article in particular rocked my world. Who knew Stanley Kunitz was so amazing? His words on transforming the events of life into legend were so profound. The article's author, Dana Goodyear, wrote up her interviews and research very well, but seemed to skirt around Kunitz's decenters. I was inspired to look up urlLink Poets House online. It's tres cool. Oh, how I wish they would branchout to other urban communities. Every now and then an article really hits me (remember the urlLink Maya Lin article ?). I also loved the letter to the editor regarding the Car of Tomorrow article. Hannah Borgeson wrote "Although the hydrogen-powered vehicle Kolbert describes may have some advantages over today's cars, it shares their biggest drawback: that of being a car."

 It's a pun, because Salam Pax's blog is named urlLink Where is Raed . Mr. Pax is getting some amazing publicity these days, including the publishing of his p-blog by the Guardian as a book called The War We Could Not Stop: the Real Story of the Battle for Iraq . Today's Guardian has an advert for the new book, masquerading as a nice, long and interesting urlLink article where Salam explains how Where is Raed came to be. Weinberger urlLink discussed it, too, in his blog a few months back when he had correspondence from a censored Iranian blogger. An estemated 12,000 Iranians blog!

 urlLink Rebecca Blood tipped me off to this great urlLink article , which reports on the latest nature/nurture research. Lise Eliot could have predicted these results several years ago! In her book, What's Going on in There: How the Brain and Mind Develop in the First Five Years of Life, she explains the nature/nurture divide by assuming the break is 50%:50%. You as a parent clearly have control over the 50% that's nurture. But you as a parent also have influence over the other half. Assume the genetic half is a ball rolling down hill. Trees or landscape along the way will determine which route the ball takes. Your input on the environment can affect the child's brain's reaction to preset genetic indicators of behavior and growth. This adjustment results in the nurture side of the equation tilting to at least 75%:25%. The big thing the research discussed in this Washington Post article does is quiet whatever arguments still were made against early childhood ed programs like urlLink Headstart . Funding for early childhood initiatives remains the easiest investment possible for the country's future. It's the one place where input dollars will affect every adult in the country within 25 years. One of the most influential indicators of every aspect of adulthood from health to criminal activity is always early childhood education.

 urlLink This is hilarious. Salon's King Kaufman reviewed the official, if not legit, opening night of NFL Countdown. I remember a professor of a Social Change urlLink class I took (can you tell I miss college today?) saying the minority party in power is usually the better organized party, ensuring the ebb and flow of our bi-partisan system. Rush Limbaugh these days is a perfect illustration of this, in that without a Democrat in the White House, this blow hard has all the air taken out of him. Nobody wants to hear a bully beat up the under dog. So, our bully has moved on to the greener pastures of beating up retired football players. Only, as Kaufman put it, "his problem is he just isn't the intellectual equal of the former players." Speaking of sports and underdogs, special congratulations are in order for the urlLink Texans . Our dear urlLink Ricky is understandably quiet today. He had a great third quarter, it was just the first, second, and forth quarters that got the best of him. Just reviewing, the Texans were down 14 on the spread, and came up strong with a final seconds play to win by 1! They are now the first ever expansion team to win their season opener their first two years. On a more somber note, our beloved Bears fell 7-49 to San Francisco.

 Amy Goodman's urlLink Democracy Now originally brought up the first 9/11 shortly after the 2001 horror, but urlLink today's Guardian also has a nice compilation of stories on the Pinochet overthrow in Chile 30 years ago. In other news, the most amazing government urlLink report I've ever seen came out last week regarding the Space Shuttle Columbia. Already, this week NASA released their public response. Let's review the most important lesson the CAIB imparted: focus on safety over schedule. Still, the plan's focus is what has already been set as a March 11 launch date. I'm not sure they've read the report. The ad team NASA brought on to redo their urlLink website last month was really fantastic. Too bad the team wasn't included in the crafting of the public response. The engineer/scientist over dependence on alliteration once again abounds with the new mantra: Smarter Stronger Safer. Gag! One more note on NASA: in the afore-blogged lost entries which discussed the NASA report at length, I said if such a report--with its absence of good/evil dichotomies and oversimplified conclusions--were conducted after 9/11, we would not be at war in Iraq right now. I want to again commend the CAIB and apologize for thinking a military-minded board would do a crappy job.

 Today was Aidan's third day of pre-school. I'm really getting into the new rhythm of this much aleved life. Speaking of rhythm, by complete coincidence I was listening to NPR this morning. I typically listen to Pacifica, but the radio was still on NPR from last night so I was caught by surprise by this well executed story on urlLink Yo-Yo Ma's new album called Obrigado Brazil . I think Yo-Yo Ma is brilliant for music in the same way Feinstein or Sagan were brilliant for science. It's one thing to be extremely knowledgable in your area, but quite another to also be fluent enough in the secular (my adaptation of the word, if you will) culture outside your art to translate your art to those who have no knowledge of it. This takes me back to college. In one of my humanities classes, we read writings and lectures from a philosopher named CP Snow, who wrote primarily on the growing chasm between the scientific and literary cultures. He was part of the linquistics define thought crowd, and expanded on the idea to say the very languages spoken by these two cultural groups have grown so seperately that hardly anyone speaks both. In another writing he furthered this idea of languages among schools of thought to the chasm between developing and developed countries, which was even more brilliant, but the first topic meets my needs today. If you follow Maslow's great developmental advice (given after he had kids), which says experience is the true source of learning rather than text contents, then it follows that what set Yo-Yo Ma, Feinstein, and Sagan apart from their fields was their expanded knowledge beyond text content through experiences. Snow would take this home to say these individuals' ability or willingness to experience fully both schools of thought inside and outside their narrow area of expertise was the key to thier bilingual coolness. I'm going to find some Yo-Yo Ma to listen to for my day of toddler-free peace!

 I feel even better about how I spent my night tonight after hearing the Dalai Lama recommended in an address today that everyone find a religion and worship. A similar sentiment sent us back to church, after a considerable hiatus. We considered over and over whether we could be part of a religion that is currently the motivating factor for much hatred, violence, and killing around the world on behalf of our country. But faith, however misused it can be, is a necessary staple for living in our world. I have wrestled with the many incarnations of Christianity, only to come up with few answers. Actually, only one answer: love. The only focus any church today should have is the very focus they seem to abdicate in the stead of judgment. What I’ve come to is the resolution that George Bush and Pat Robertson have as little to do with my religion as terrorists have to do with the Muslim religion worshiped down the street. I’ve come to the solid awareness that precisely because these usurpers of the good and pure that faith is are in power, I need to believe. I think this is what the Dalai Lama intended with his words today as well. Namaste!

 It’s noon on Sunday. What does that mean? 1) football, and 2) beer! Hooray! Welcome to what has become an annual holiday in the Feighery house: opening weekend in the NFL! This year I didn’t follow the preseason too closely, blame it on a toddler and the endless series of family vacations from hell. I’d refer you to that section of the blog, but it was erased in a freak accident involving odd Windows procedures. In retrospect, I have credited the loss of words—initially very painful—to the universe’s infinite wisdom. On one hand, the entries included a long, dramatic, and, dare I brag, well-written bit on the space program, the report, and our lives since T=0, otherwise known as February 1st. But on the other hand, it also included some of the most personal words I’ve written since I began blogging and that in turn included some very angry details about my parents and siblings. So, parents and siblings, consider yourselves off the hook. I’m over the damn vacation now and you didn’t even have to suffer the blogging consequences. The really productive thing that came out of losing the entries was my decision to move my blog to blogger. This takes us to the other big deal about this entry: welcome to blogger, faithful readers! In honor of the move, I’ve officially named my blog Nomad. Nomad was taken among blogger blogs, so the URL is PlanetNomad. I like the word planet anyway, after John told me it’s origins mean wanderer, so named because the planets are bodies that wander around the sun. And there’s the whole space focus in our family anyway. By the way, can someone please tell me how to postdate my p-blog into the blogger archive?!? But back to football, today’s opening game is a special one for several reasons. Our home town Texans are playing Miami, whose star player (besides their new sign-on, Junior) is Ricky Williams, a fantastic netizen and brilliant blogger (I’ll learn to link the stuff next week, for now, go to runrickyrun.com). Until I found Ricky’s blog last year, I never cared a bit about Miami. But cheering for Ricky is a lot like supporting the Howard Dean campaign, which I am proud to say I along with my $100 did this week in lieu of being in New Mexico to support him in person. When a person joins the on-line community, they open themselves up completely. Suddenly, it’s like your neighbor who just moved in turns out to be running for President, or starting in the big game this weekend. Does that make you an automatic supporter? Pretty much. The Texans are actually doing pretty well. They’re 14 down in the spread, so just showing up is going to be an improvement. But let’s face it, this Miami team was one game away from the Super Bowl the last time they took the field. I’d say, just from watching the first quarter, the biggest improvement in the team so far is the way they manage the playclock. Screw you, Microsoft spell check. Playclock is too a word. UPDATE: I changed the name, after seeing Nomad up in print over and over. The theme of the year has definitely been the same river twice paradox, but i was hoping to save that name for a book. so here's the deal. nobody better steal my book title or i'll beat you up.

 urlLink Microsoft fired a worker for noting a shipment he saw on the dock in his blog. This is bound to bite them in the ass. All Microsoft workers will feel betrayed by the company's proported stance on laying off bloggers. urlLink Salon reported on "hackers" (read bloggers and programmers) who have caught on to the Atkins rage. It's funny really to see the supergeeks doing something so normal as trying to lose weight. Anyway, it's a good bit of ethnography for the e-culture. Assuming you got the daypass to read the aforementioned Salon article, stick around for the urlLink King Kaufman NFL picks for the weekend's games. He dissed my boys the Bears, but he'll pay. My family is in fresh Bear gear thanks to my parents recent Willowcreek conference, that's bound to be a goodluck charm, right? He won back my love a little becuase he picked Houston, but he made the pick his What the Heck pick, which is kind of a diss to Houston. I can't blame him for not picking the Steelers, but I sure hope they pull it out. Here are two articles for my Houston readers: urlLink one on Blade's , a new restaurant opening, and the other on urlLink the Main Event , which will close Main for several blocks on Friday and Saturday nights for clubbers (a fantastic idea, I've been saying the Village should do this for a long time).

 I've had so many reasons to stop watching the View. Don't act like you don't watch daytime TV because you have a job or a life or whatever, just TiVo it. First they maligned Lisa, eventually pushing her out. Then, they seem hell bent on replacing her with someone conservative and boring enough that they won't have to malign her (they must have gotten urlLink The Memo , too). A few weeks ago they bashed breastfeeding. And now, the last straw, they're going to do a special location View in Charleston, SC, the state all the world agreed to boycott until the hateful dixie flag was removed. The Sharon Osborne Show speaks more directly to my culture anyway. She's been getting better and better, today she's dressed as Mortitia Adams and has Ozzy on with her (I happen to hold the Adams' family in high esteem because Mortitia was the first non traditional mother on TV and the couple were the first to sleep in the same bed on TV). Just now, Ozzy farted and Sharon smelled it and she asked him if he dropped one and Dennis Rodman, who was the guest hanging around for the pumpkin carver, said I wasn't going to say nothin! The entire stage was raucous laughter. It's hilarious. She is open and accepting to youth culture, all culture at that. She asks questions that are far closer to the questions I would ask if I had her guests on my couch. Sharon uses a style more like Jimmy Kimmel's where guests hang around for segments. It's a far cry from the beat the clock, Letterman-esque feeling the View uses. I've been watching during the boring View segments and commercials for a while, so now I'm formally switching over my allegiance. Here's to hoping the View gets cancelled shortly after ABC execs read this blog.

 With a heavy heart I read urlLink the parting comments of Ed Lu , the astronaut who has been urlLink recording his deepest observations and posting them online, which is exactly a blog, whether or not he's aware of the term. I can tell you as a person who supports (peaceful) space exploration with every bone of her body, it's very difficult to quantify the benefits of space in order to justify the expense to the tax payer. I find myself saying phrases like human endeavor and expanding our realm of existence directly brought about the Renaissance. Ed phrased it well here: "I often hear that our space program is all about doing science. It is about much more than that. It is about opening up a new frontier for commerce, trade, and settlement, as well as doing science. The advent of ocean-going ships in the 1400s was a huge boon to science, not because we did scientific experiments on the ships, but because the ships took us to places we had never dreamed of before, and changed peoples lives by opening up new settlements and trade routes. In the same way I think we will reap additional scientific benefits of the space station when we use it to help us learn how to send people to the far reaches of the Solar System." He had this nice comment about China is space: "And speaking of space exploration, last week we had company for one day as China launched a manned spacecraft with astronaut Yang LiWei on board. He was in space for less than one day, but it was nice to know we were sharing the sky with someone else. The more people in space, the better!"

 Tonight marks the opening of urlLink November Sweeps , and to quote urlLink E!Online , "You can title this November sweeps Milking Private Lynch." Apparently, CBS still urlLink hasn't finished cutting scenes from what has affectionately come to be called Meet the Reagans. The previews were met with urlLink advertisers threatening a boycott and urlLink abounding urlLink editorials . My favorite so far is the urlLink Salt Lake Tribune's article called, and I shit you not, Liberals and Gays have Gone 1 Too Far with Miniseries that Crucifies Reagans. Freedom of Speech my ass. Freedom has become a puppet, and the strings are perpetually pulled by corporations. Anyway, back to Sweeps, the casualties include Coupling, Boomtown, Brotherhood of Poland, NH (sorry, mom) and Lyon's Den. Big shock. As for daytime TV, I've been saying for some time that the most pleasant surprise of the season has been the Ellen Degeneres Show, so I hope it stays. And I hope the bloodbath on the soaps ends soon, I've never seen so many shows kill so many characters! For primetime, my money's on Average Joe, Trista's Wedding, Queer Eye, which will show on NBC in addition to its usual Bravo slot. I'm hopeful for Fox's new show, urlLink Arrested Development . The plot looks clever, the writing is great on the outtakes I've seen, but the cast is littered with remnants of sitcoms past, which doesn't bode well. We'll see...

 This morning I was driving my son to school, we were on the freeway, when a five or six car accident occurred right in front of me. The car in front of me was the first in the line to not hit or get hit. It was a wild experience. I called 911 and a whole host of people were already out of their cars and helping so I stayed in the car with my babies until a police officer helped me navigate my way out. Years ago, my sister was in a pile-up in Albuquerque on the Big I, pile-ups have always frightened me. Maybe because with most accidents you think your own driving skills might give you a good chance to avoid them, but pile-ups leave you completely without control. What amazed me was the clarity with which I saw and thought about everything as it occurred. The sounds of tires screeching and cars hitting each other. Debris flicked away and flew through the air and slapped the pavement. I calmly hit my breaks and watched for cars behind me to respond or not. I quickly had to decide whether to stay in the lane or pull onto the sholder. The sholder meant hitting the guard rail if anyone hit me, then being squished between the rail and the smooshing cars. But the sholder also offered a lesser chance of getting hit since everyone else was in the lane. I took the sholder. The truck behind me fishtailed a little, but regained control, changed lanes and drove away. Within a few seconds, a giant traffic jam filled the rearview mirror. My kids were quiet and listening with me, but no one was alarmed. Like I said, it was wild.

 urlLink MediaGuardian.co.uk | Broadcast | Fox News threatened to sue, claims Simpsons creator I guess the Fair and Balanced bit didn't teach them their lesson.

 You gotta love that Russian pride! Russian space command: "...and were they close to the selected landing site?" helicopter pilot on Russian Step: "yes, they were almost exactly on the predicted spot." Just in case you want in on the joke, the last crew return was delayed for a few hours while helicopters roamed the Russian Step looking for the Soyuz that had drifted off course during re-entry. All the world via CNN anxiously waited the first crew return since the Columbia tragedy and the Russian space agency lost a bit o'face. Here, in what must be a prescripted phrase, Russian Mission Control attempted to regain that face as soon as the landing site was recovered. And I can't believe I only just noticed that Russian Mission Control has small billboards along the bottom of the main screen. HP and Omega watches were among the adverts. How funny!

 This morning's Fox pregame was a touching tribute to the Steelers. It made me really sad to remember that this is the first football season since Grandpa died. Grandpa was born and raised just outside of Pittsburgh and was forever the biggest Steelers fan this side of the Yakagheny. He was recruited from high school to play for UNM almost sixty years ago. Maybe he even once dreamed of playing pro for the Steelers, but instead went into the Navy and piloted a PT boat at Normandy. Anyway, even the ornery fucker Terry Bradshaw was kind of fun to watch today as they paid tribute to all the Steelers teams of the past. His horse analogy was pretty screwy though. One too many concussions. Today the Bears attempt to send the Detroit Lions on toward the worst record ever in the NFL for road games. urlLink Houston plays Indianapolis , who are fresh off a bye and lead Houston's division. Houston's bested last year's average of showing up to play one quarter a game this year by typically showing up for two quarters. Last week the defense showed up for the second and third quarters, and the offense showed up for the third and forth. If everyone had shown up together, they might have one. The success or failure of today's game depends entirely upon timing. Did you see the Raiders/KC game last Sunday night? It was a fantastic game, I only caught the second half, but that was the one to watch. This game is definitely the most commented upon game of the week, so won't repeat what has been said too many time, but I do want to say that the commentators of that game were the worst I've ever heard. The most derisive, negative voices. I didn't catch who it was, but they sucked.

 I am really enjoying the weekend. This morning I slept in and after I woke John made the family heart-shaped waffles topped with the remaining Salmon Farm raspberries from New Mexico. Houston is experiencing the first cold front of the season, it was wild to wake up to 60 degrees! We turned our heater on for the first time (pew!) and outside you can smell some neighbors fired up their fireplaces. Just in case you are reading this from a non-tropical temperate zone, keep in mind that just three days ago it was 90 degrees, so 60 is a huge change. Yesterday we watched urlLink the Secretary and urlLink Bend it Like Beckham . It was so much fun to watch movies! Typically, we rent a movie about once a month or so, but this month we've rented movies almost every weekend. We've been in a movie lull these past few years, so maybe it's ending? The Secretary was fun, if odd. Very cult feeling like Donny Darko or the Hotel. The leading actress should win an Academy Award for her character's transformation from the movies start to end. Wardrobe was also very crafty. It was an adventure, I'm really glad we watched it alone because it would have been an awkward movie to share with another couple. Plus, you all know my stance on censorship and kids: anything I can watch, they can watch, but I felt pretty relieved my son was napping so I didn't have to worry about his perception of sexy spanking. The movie centers on a woman perhaps around 20, from a clearly dysfunctional family with all sorts of textbook issues. Fresh out of the institution, she applies for a job as the secretary for a lawyer with issues of his own, but who enjoys nurturing women, like orchids, into blossoming dominatrix. Well acted, well filmed, definitely explores the often polarized issue while avoiding polarities. Dysfunction is treated as absolute and normal for our culture, which I could argue it is, which is nice since the movie industry still likes to pretend we all sleep in twin beds and never curse. Bend it Like Beckham was so amazing. It replaces Real Women have Curves as Movie of the Year in my book. Interesting though that both movies I consider tops starred purely female protagonists ( urlLink see my typical gripe about that here ). No boys needed to come save their day, and yet they were sexual creatures that enjoyed men in their lives. Parents, take your teenagers (boys and girls alike, because even boys need to see heroic women) to see both these movies. Better yet, buy the movies for them. No, rip them, you'll be their heroes. Bend it is and English flick that brilliantly parallels the lives of two sisters in a first generation Indian family. One sister is preparing for a wedding, controversial because it is a love match rather than an arrangement. The other sister's love is football, soccer for the yanks, and even more controversial because she shows her body and throws around with boys. It was fantastic to see the plot wrestle with how deeply and differently each family member loves the others, rather than the tired American staples of dysfunction and hatred. I watched torn between my point of view, whose life I empathised the struggle with more, that flipped back and forth from the parents wanting to raise their children to the best of their abilities according to their values and experiences, or the children who wanted to define their individuality, live their lives, and honor their parents at the same time. I thought I had the plot pegged for ending with a dramatic marriage of convenience. Now, I don't want to ruin it for you if you haven't seen it (I doubt this is the case, because I feel like the last person in the world who hadn't seen it), but the writing was so fantastic because it didn't take this easy way out. To the end the plot stayed real, honoring every struggle from every point of view. The storyline and actors did great honor to the cultures featured: Indian, English, and Soccer. At the film's close, my heart felt like an itch deep down inside, that I didn't even know was itching, had been scratched. I wanted more.

 urlLink Pedro Duque is following urlLink Ed Lu's success of blogging from space. They don't know it's called blogging, but it is. Note: the urlLink Slashdot mention of Pedro's blogging goes out of its way to say the NASA ball point pen thing is a urlLink documented urban myth . Wired reported on the panel convened to decide if the urlLink Voyager's images should be considered art . I bet a DOD satellite urlLink can't do this . Maybe they can, but they wouldn't put out a press release for the results. urlLink cool research on space storms The Sci-Fi Channel urlLink plans to sue NASA, DOD, the Air Force, and the Army for documents that pertain to research or exploration of the subject of UFOs.

 urlLink The Atlantic Monthly's page offers a sidebar of stories from long ago. urlLink 30 years ago they ran this story on the increasing numbers of disinchanted youth at American colleges. This was before the great themes were turned into theme parks, right urlLink Hard Harry ?

 The staff at the Guardian Unlimited must have a list fetish. Remember the urlLink anti-femme book list ? They also did a list of top bands, and it was such a hit they decided to urlLink repeat it with American bands . Only the dumbfucks left out the two greatest bands ever, much less just right now: U2 and DMB. I would normally punish them by not talking about them at all, but after last week's mention of the Observer's book list got me the urlLink Rebecca Blood nod, I think bloggers must have list fetishes, too. While your over at G2, urlLink look at this . I don't think they're correct in saying this is the world's first radio weblog, but urlLink it might be the first radio fiction weblog .

 Yesterday urlLink NASAWatch broke a story about NASA suddenly desperate to make room on the departing Soyuz to bring down air samples, even if it meant they had to ride on Ed Lu's lap. Anytime air or water monitoring is mentioned in the news, it translates to a lot of overtime for John, and a lot of time my kids don't get to see their dad, so we all braced ourselves. Sure enough, by the afternoon NASAWatch changed its tune on the story from just monitoring a strange scenario to making this the big issue. Words like point of no return were pulled out of a urlLink Spaceref site containing minutes to meetings from the last weeks' deliberations on air and water quality. The urlLink Washington Post appears to have been the first major news agency to report the story. Here in Houston the news channels and the Chronicle smelled blood in the water at NASA this morning. By noon, the stories were dramatic and wild, questioning whether NASA should have launched a crew this week when the air and water on ISS might not be safe. But this afternoon was the opening day of testimony at urlLink the Robert Durst trial and the dogs seem to have lost the scent. A few hours ago, a quick check on Google News shows international news agencies have urlLink picked up on the drama , but national news stations almost completely ignored it. Now, urlLink CNN , Fox, urlLink MSNBC , and urlLink Discovery News are all posting headlines.

 I found the Poison Kitchen this week, and enjoyed urlLink this bit on Guantanamo Bay . The urlLink NYT article is commonplace by now, but Taylor's comments are original.

 a year ago today I woke up with the thought in fleeting dreaminess that Scott would die today. I never was able to work out the times so I will never know if my thought was a premonition of the death to come or a sensing of my loved one passing on. Months later my grandfather died and I was very troubled that I had not felt either the coming or occurring of his death as I had Scott's. The only answer I could give myself was that I was pregnant when Scott died, and the pregnancy must have heightened my senses to the spiritual world. Everyone said Scott was supposed to cure cancer, not die from it. This year, with his residency behind him along with his PhD/MD ed, his legendary career as a surgeon was to take off. But in just six and a half months, Scott--he would say call me Bill--went from an amazingly strong, athletic man who trained for marathons and telemark skied, to a man so light that when he fell into his wife's arms at death, she picked him up and set him in bed. Two weeks before he died, I visited them in Minneapolis. It was a beautiful fall there, the way the light hit the leaves at an angle, even at noon, was like a filter on a film screen, and we were all extras on a movie set. Scott, Toni, Devon, Rossanna, Bill, and Greg were the stars. They bravely played their parts without knowing their lines, did their own stunts even. I learned so much about life through Scott's death. The magic mystery I had only associated with birth until then, surrounded Scott as he neared his death. I wondered why we humans have to be facing down death in order to see so clearly life's priorities. When he talked, he was direct, there was no time or place for wandering innuendo. He wanted to be surrounded with people who loved him, he just lied there in bed loving and being loved. I wanted to crawl into bed with him and hug and cuddle, I still regret that I did not. I left without saying goodbye. I said see you later, but we both knew I wouldn't. My mom told him we're all dying, he just might be dying a little faster. But he was a physician first, and human second. He had to go from death meaning losing to death meaning resting. His funeral was two hours long. So many people told fantastic stories about the many ways he touched their lives. His parents, his wife and teenaged daughter are together today--huddled close to each other for comfort, seeking him in each other--in Albuquerque. So wherever you are, lift a glass for my cousin William Scott Hays who died tragically and romantically in his wife's arms. A year ago today.

 OK, urlLink this guy is a little rough on democrats as a group, but I try to support the Green party whenever possible (via urlLink RRiverstone ). I'm the one who says we owe Nader a huge apology because everything he warned us about back in 1999 has come to pass. Enron, Gore, Bush, etc. My plan for the 2004 election is that everyone in a urlLink red state (I mean states like Texas that really have no blue chance in hell) who don't want to vote for Bush agree to vote for the Green candidate so that people in questionable states can vote for the dem and rest in the knowledge that someday soon there will be a viable third party.

 and lately you are legion, urlLink here is a fantastic blog from a 2nd grade class (via urlLink Weinberger's JOHO ).

 urlLink Jim Moore (a Harvard prof who blogs pretty well for a Harvard prof) put the word out that Yossi Vardi will be speaking on Second Superpower-esque issues today at Harvard. The speech will be webcast urlLink here at 5pm EST. "The Berkman Center is proud to present Yossi Vardi, Founding Investor of ICQ, on October 21st, 2003. He will speak on the topic "The Edge Against the Hub: The Struggle for Dominance on the Internet," at 5:00pm in Hauser 104 on the Harvard Law Campus."

 In college, a professor once assigned a project for me in which I was to answer the question of what life will be like after humans populate Mars. I finally came down to one conclusion: that colonies on Mars are humans' only chance for peace on Earth because only then would humans have a common other by which they could define themselves and a common enemy against whom they would unite. Of course, peace on Earth would be rather hallow in light of interplanetary hostilities. Two very smart individuals, Professor Seth Shostak, a senior astronomer at the SETI institute, and Alex Barnett, chief executive office of the Chabot Space Centre, have come together to write a book called urlLink Cosmic Company , which urlLink concludes dramatically that we Earthlings should almost (statistically speaking) certainly come into contact with another planet's civilization by 2025. Peter Bishop would call this a wild card event, that is, something with a very small probability of occurring, but with amazing, off the chart consequences. It astounds the mind to just consider this happening in our lifetime. But my predictions for the way we humans would interact with Martians, even Martians of our own progeny, carries over to interactions with aliens. For the aliens' sake, I sure hope we don't find them.

 In my hicktown upbringing, this was the meanest thing you could do to someone, you'd write this and their number on the truckstop bathroom wall and they, or their parents, would get months of rude phone calls.

 Notice how in urlLink this NPR story about the first openly gay Episcopal bishop, parishoners assume gay means permiscuous. I like that Gene Robinson pointed out he's not the first gay Episcopal bishop, but rather the first to be openly gay. More people need to make this about whether American Christians really mean to be promoting don't ask don't tell. The urlLink NYT has this offering about a Catholic church in the Bronx. (use urlLink Rebecca's login: pocketpass, password: pocketpass) MSNBC, which I would normally disdain, urlLink wins the prize for finding the most unusual tilt on the issue. Sweden's Lutheran church is facing a near-schism over dual issues of ordaining women and homosexual pastors. The catch is, no one is Sweden gives a flying flip: "Most native Swedes are baptised, married and buried in the church but rarely darken its doorway in between. One percent are estimated to attend church regularly, making Sweden one of the world's most secular societies."

 urlLink This is what happened to me earlier today. To add to the joy, the potty training boy has diarreah, the baby is puking and playing in it, and my husband won't be home from work until late tonight.

 urlLink This article about "Site R" came out in 2001, but no one seemed to have noticed. Maybe people thought they had to keep the lid on for national security reasons?

 The Soyuz docked early this morning with ISS, carrying American astronaut urlLink Michael Foale , Russian cosmonaut urlLink Alexander Yurievich Kaleri , and ESA astronaut urlLink Pedro Duque of Spain. John didn't have any hardware aboard this one, so we didn't pay too much attention. But now it's exciting to see urlLink Ed Lu and urlLink Yuri Malenchenko at the successful tail end of what must have been the most challenging and nerve racking ISS stay ever. Space.com urlLink ran a story on the docking that pointed out all the firsts for the mission: Michael Foale will become the first Astronaut to stay aboard MIR and ISS, Yuri Malenchenko will be the first person ever to urlLink leave Earth single and return married . The article errantly says Soyuz is the only ship currently able to carry people to and from ISS. China's launch vehicle is based on Russian technology and includes a docking ring. Their orbital inclination last week was pretty close to the height needed to reach ISS. Pointedly, China has never expressed any interest in ISS, but rather hopes to build a station of their own as their next step toward achieving urlLink a mission to Mars . I for one am cheering them on. As Ed and Yuri prepared to leave ISS, they had urlLink a lot of unglamorous housework to do . Ed recently downlinked some photos he'd taken, which caused a brief and apparently malign stir here in Houston. He said: "You know you live on the ISS when casual snapshots you take around the house can cause 200 engineers to panic and demand a detailed photo survey of everything you own. (Upbeat uplink from Flight Control)." urlLink This is a fun new space site for my teacher friends. Now here are some farming subsidies I can support!

 urlLink Rogi Riverstone is a trash picker and blogger from Albuquerque and urlLink Saturday's Tribune headlined her blog! UPDATE (10/20): Riverstone commented me yesterday to let me know that her career titles go so much further than trash picker, but the article just focused on that. She said: "I am also a journalist, activist, artist and musician. But those aren't as "photogenic" as "trash picker" seems." My apologies for also overlooking your many talents! My own life can't be taken down to any one career, so I really understand. I am a writer, anthropologist, grassroots development consultant, and mother of two young children, not to mention aspiring graduate student (my program got killed). I never know what to say when people ask me what I do. I do it all!

 urlLink Bush's tour of Asia has met plenty of schedule delays, thanks to the urlLink legions of protesters who showed up to voice their disapproval of American policy. urlLink Bush won't be able to enjoy the traditional royal entrance when we arrives in London next month because the way will apparently be urlLink blocked by protesters! Instead, he'll be taking a helicopter from the airport to the palace.

 Today the urlLink Observer has a piece about Nudestock, which is, according to them, hippie Mecca. The event website advertises: "We are the only nudist resort to promote a retro-Nudestock that relives the music and mood of the sixties." This is exactly what troubles me so much about the generation of individuals that once had the backbone to stand up to their parents, Richard Nixon, the establishment. Shouldn't they be at a urlLink Moveon.org event instead of a nostalgia fest capitalistically designed to charge for their naked walk down memory lane? Maybe it's always been this way, urlLink the real believers maligned for the poseurs who exchanged their idealism for a Visa card. Last year I had the pleasure of attending a peace rally in DC with urlLink 80,000 of my fellow Americans who think diplomacy is more than a nice idea. That was hippie Mecca.



 My newest love in daytime TV is DHChannel's An Adoption Story. When John was home on Monday for the holiday I made him watch with me so he could understand why I all-of-a-sudden want to adopt five kids. It turned out to be a couple (Geeta and Pi) from Houston, both doctors, and their story was _so_ romantic! They met in college and remained good friends for years after. Then, after Geeta visited Pi in Saint Louis, he confessed that he wanted more than a friendship with him, he was in love. Geeta asked her mother for permission to date Pi and her mother said no. She said the two had known each other for 12 years so they already knew everything they needed to know about each other to decide whether they should get married. Geeta told Pi and Pi asked Geeta to marry her. How beautiful! My experience in the world, as an anthropologist and as a liberal white woman may very well have made me a person who viewed the marriages of the Indian culture as negative. However, in college, my roommate Priya was from India and she opened my eyes to the beauty and difference of her culture. She taught me not to judge without understanding. Priya did not date, and was happy waiting for her parents to find her husband. She trusted them, and she was quick to point out how many happy arranged marriages endured where Americans' did not. Clearly, Geeta's mother was wise in her judgment. And Geeta was wise for trusting her mother. How romantic! The careers of Geeta and Pi took them to Houston and they decided to start their family. Geeta found she had issues from endometriosis that were preventing her from conceiving. Here I really must thank my own OB in El Paso who told me at 20 to conceive soon if I wanted kids after he performed a lap to treat endometriosis. Anyway, this led to the couple adopting a beautiful baby girl from and Indian orphanage. I wish them the best!

Last year they had the Haiku contest that I would have loved to enter, but it was Brit only. The Guardian is like the most read paper in the world, one of them at least. They should own up to that identity. The only Brit Blog I know of is my friend urlLink Phil's . He does this other thing called urlLink Pepys' Diary , in which he pretends the 400 year old journal entries of this guy Samuel Pepys are actually current blog entries. As weird as this sounds to Yanks, it's urlLink pretty popular in England . It will probably win some category or another.

 Once again the American press proved Astronauts have to die or nearly die for space to break into the otherwise numb and noisy headlines. The Cubs lost last night, Bush and Cheney are urlLink pulling another page from the Vietnam playbook by accusing the press of making too much of the daily US soldier deaths, and somewhere a kid put his penis in another kids face. These headlines and more precede the news that the first new nation in forty years put a man in space. Plus, China was the first nation ever to put themselves into space without a war for motivation! Some urlLink buzz is out there about the seemingly extreme amount of debris that came off the rocket at launch. It's clearly debris, and not ice. Let's hope it's nothing important.

 urlLink Space.com also has some urlLink satellite images of the launch pad . Very good quality. urlLink NYT story on centuries-old history of Chinese in space urlLink SINA.com , a Chinese news agency. Stocks opened high this morning in Hong Kong on the news of the successful launch. urlLink Spaceflight Now had the best specs on the launch. urlLink China Daily's Jiu Quan Launch Center Page Special thanks to Ron in Japan for these links: urlLink Chinese Academy of Space Technology I quote Ron here: urlLink This is supposed to be a 3-D "download" of, according to Babelfish, the "discharge process and the operation track", though I tihnk it means the blast-off and flight path. So far, I couldn't get into the page though. Could be too much traffic. If you have a Well.com membership, it's worth a trip to the Spaceshots and Rocket Launches group to see what Bernie had to share tonight. I've asked permission to republish here, am still waiting, though.

 I put out feelers in many blogs, one in the dailykos most recent comments box. I got a reply from Ron in Japan, in which he tried to nail down the exact inclination. John found urlLink this Spaceflight Now article for me, which discusses the inclinations with more recent info than urlLink this old MSNBC one I had found. 42.4 degrees looks like the current inclination. He'll be in an eliptical orbit for the first seven hours, then shift to a circular orbit for the duration. Interesting bit going on at slashdot about this being the first person launched alone in 40 years.

 The following is a statement from NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe about China's first successful human space flight. "This launch is an important achievement in the history of human exploration. China, after Russia and the United States, is only the third nation to successfully launch humans into space. "The Chinese people have a long and distinguished history of exploration. NASA wishes China a continued safe human space flight program.

 who can tell me the orbital path of the Chinese launch vehicle if they know the time (9 a.m. gobi local) and inclination (52 degrees). Regardless of the fact that CNN is carrying this several minutes old news three stories down, this is _amazing_. I want to go outside and watch them cross overhead just as people watched Sputnik so many years ago. If only I knew when to look! We only have a few hours' window! I've called upon the bloggeratti to help, but who knows who is checking mail at this hour. damn damn damn.

 Ha! I beat Google News! A friend just got a call from Taiwan and said the Chinese launched. CNN just started covering it. If we can find an orbit path, we should be able to see them outside. John says they should be in a low orbit. Go China! Just reflecting, Sputnik launched on a night like this in October, too...

 Like dams on lakes, daylight savings time is obviously stupid, but kept around because we Americans hate change. Here is a system that was created for an agrarian economy, or at least a culture that needed sunlight to get most of its work done. This isn't the norm anymore. On the contrary, most people work under fake lights with little or no sunlight in offices or factories. What does benefit from sunlight is a little outdoor time with your kids when you get home, or maybe a healthy walk, but do we prioritise that over tradition? Not a chance. We'll give your morning commute the extra hour and kids be damned.

 I can't think of a worse way to consume urlLink 1,030 calories and 64 grams of fat . Blood drew attention this week to the, er, growing market for urlLink supersized caskets .

 The Observer claims to have found (for the British culture) urlLink the 100 best novels ever . They didn't mean only of Brit writers, but they might as well have since they didn't consider novels in translation. They also skimped on the female authors, and didn't consider at all authors of the children's books genre. Still, it's a good place to look for books to add to your list if you want to be well read.

 I don't play Fantasy, and today's a good lesson why. When I lay out my teams for the day, they're teams I'm cheering for, not teams I strategically guess will win. Ricky ran, and that's about it for my hopes for the day. I can't be too down on the Texans. They scored 17 on one of the best teams this year, only they had more than double that scored back on them, giving Steve McNair his best day ever. The Bears also came up short, but their game simulcasted the Texans so I'll have to wait for Inside the NFL to see what really happened. I'm watching the ESPN late game: San Fran v Seattle. The kicker just blew the extra point because the holder toggled and faced the laces to him. I won't pretend like I get that, but it sucks hard to be a 49er at the moment. I always feel so bad for the one guy that messes up in these situations. I think about how he'll probably lay awake all night tonight thinking of that screw up. K Street was great tonight, they're playing like Mary Madeline is the rumored leak in the Bush admin, and they're playing so well, it's hard to know what's real.

 The best urlLink promo I've ever seen. You know I'm a big fan anyway, so this advice isn't exactly urlLink Fair and Balanced ... I'm adding the book to my amazon wishlist. Salam just returned from a three week book tour in London, followed and preceded by two weeks trying to secure travel in and out of Jordan. His urlLink blog covers it all with his usual blunt eloquence.

 I can't tell you how much I'm enjoying this channel. Beck is so great, and the interview of Beck is so great. He's talking about the world into which Loser was released. He said there was this great awkward moment in the country where the marketing industry and even the entire establishment didn't get the youth culture, and Loser became the voice of that.

 Everyone in this part of the world is focused on the UT-OU game. Last I checked, OU was whooping some UT horns. I could really give a flying *aggie sign* about college football, NFL is where it's at. It's funny that I feel the exact opposite in regards to basketball. Pro is way to individual-oriented, too much offence no defense, no plays run at all, unless you count the well-paid/under grand jury investigation tall guy getting the ball and jumping from impossibly far out to dunk it a play. This last year I had the amazing experience of attending the Final Four in person. Wow. This year, the Super Bowl is in Houston. Attending it would be the perfect one-two punch for my career as an avid sports fan. Maybe followed by a writing contract with NFL.com or ESPN. I could replace Rush! I promise to yell no profanely racist comments and to actually listen and to... wait, the only women the NFL hires are weather sluts or sideline bimbos. Still, I love the game. I know I've been out of the action for two weekends due to traveling, but I'm back and Sunday is upon us. urlLink King Kaufman is definitely on his game in his column, in which he makes witty little comments about stupid kickers not avoiding Dante Hall. If you go to Salon to check him out, stay for the urlLink Anne Lemott article . I think it's hilarious that Arnold makes Anne stir inside real deep! As always, let me know if you need help cracking your way into Salon's articles. Each week I am amazed at the filming by urlLink HBO's Inside the NFL . Since the season began (this is my first season to have HBO, for those of you lucky ducks who are like, we learned this last year!), I keep thinking it can't get any better. But it does! If you don't have HBO, it's like the filming on the feature link historic game overviews you see on ESPN all the time, or on network around the Super Bowl. Only, it's not about some boring game played before I was born, it's now! They set up sideline cameras that keep up with Ricky Williams making an amazing breakaway, meanwhile playing the sound from the mic'ed up ref or linebacker. I honest to God felt I was there. I have yet to be sold on their newhires, but I'll give them a chance. The episode from two weeks ago is my favorite. This puny lawyer for urlLink Maurice Clarett got cheeky with urlLink Cris Carter , I thought he was going to lose his head! Speaking of urlLink Ricky , he's writing again and things are good in runrickyrun land. He says things don't get much better than this, presumably speaking of being the star player on a team that is Super Bowl material. I got a very nice compliment this week when a friend said if they were reincarnated any time soon they hoped to be the third Feighery child. Well, I'll pass this buck along and say I want to be Ricky Williams! Or Brian Urlacher. Ooh, too tough to call. I can't dis my New Mexico boy. Ok, enough talk. Tomorrow the Texans simply must beat the Titans. Last year was amazing with the Dallas win right off the bat, but was hampered by the absence of a Titan pounding. The year I moved to Houston, everyone had bumper stickers that read Go Oilers! Take the Astros With You! This was the year the turncoat Oilers decided to move to Tennessee and became the Titans. The Bears must also win because everyone thinks it's a fluke that they beat Oakland last week. The only time the Saints came out to play this year was against Houston, so they just can't have two out of my three teams. So in summary, go Bears, run Ricky, pound 'em, Texans, and don't kick to Dante Hall. Kickoff's at noon, see you tomorrow! Cheers!

 While out on a burbon run for my hot toddies, John also got a rose and a box of chocolate covered, liquor filled cherries. He came home and said he was sorry my anniversary sucked, that we'd make up for it in March (the next of the three dates, the big one). He wins the prize.

 It's rained steady all day, which is fitting because today sucked it up. I have a bad headcold, my baby and toddler are rapidly showing symptoms of the same. I want chicken soup, wine, and candles, but I guess I'll just go make myself a hot toddy. On the bright side, I think I might be on my way to changing only one kid's diapers! Go see the sprogblog for details on that. And just so it's clear, no, my husband didn't remember. We have three anniversaries and this is the least known, so I'm not being too hard on him.

 The NYT has urlLink a story today about the stress hormone pigs and other meaty animals produce that can ruin the meat after butchering. They (Texas A&M researchers) tried injecting antidotes to the hormone but that was tricky to get passed the FDA so they are finally, reluctantly looking at improving the conditions of living that cause the stress in the animals. Gig'em. Onto a much better topic, urlLink Real Women Online contributor Madhu recently attended blogcon and has fantastic things to say about the emerging global conversation of blogging. I quote: "But what impresses me the most is the solitary voice. The testimonial. So much talk at the conference about 'utopia' and 'revolution'. I'm not sure this new communication medium will revolutionize American or any other society. But. The process. Giving a voice to all the thoughts in your head. Testifying. To your own personal truth. And the stories. The millions and millions of stories. I know some people find this daunting, even troubling. Millions of mostly unread blogs, posts, stories. A mirror of our mortality and vulnerability in cyberspace. I don't find this troubling at all. A million whispers is a roar. A billion is a sonic boom. And I like the idea of millions and millions of people typing away in English and French and Mandarin and Farsi. Throwing bottles filled with personal scribblings and musings out onto the ocean. And. Sometimes, the ocean throws back a sign. And the sign says that, after all, we are human. We are individual. And we are just learning to speak."

 I just spent the last hour and a half watching a video called urlLink Was it a Paper Moon ? on, you guessed it, theories on the so called Moon Conspiracy. John called toward the end and, after clearly expressing his surprise that anyone would want to watch something so obviously errant, spent 20 minutes answering my questions before he told me to go to urlLink this website , which is dedicated to debunking bad astronomy. I guess I'm left with this conundrum after seeing both sides. The people who believe the moon landing was a hoax seem to be sincere. They truly, honestly feel they are doing the world a favor by exposing this government conspiracy. If the evidence to the contrary is so clear, why do they still believe? Either they're luney or devious, but they seem to be neither. I think college physics and engineering classes should use this video as the perfect opportunity to give their students hands-on experience alongside critical thinking skills. Assign them arguments to test to see if the conspiracy claims are valid. So far, one good example of such an exercise would be the claim that the video makes that the fuel burned by the lem should exhaust red smoke, but no smoke is in the pictures. John said in the absence of the atmosphere we know here on Earth, the particulates that make smoke visible would dissipate so widely and so rapidly that they would not form a visible cloud of smoke. UPDATE: While on the Bad Astronomy web site, I also came upon urlLink this clever list of scientifically sound and/or entertaining movies. urlLink Phil Plait , the site's author/manager, is not a NASA civil servant, but does work on NASA-funded projects.

 We’ve been driving all this week through New Mexico’s amazing landscape and one theme has remained constant: water, or the lack of it, is shaping the current terrain. As we entered the state, we drove from Tucumcari to Las Vegas, via Conchas Lake, which is down forty feet, and up Trujillo hill, a breathtaking pass that begins on the Llano and ends on the highland plateau that flows off the Rockies. From Las Vegas, we drove by Story Lake, which was never a big lake, but is now little more than a marsh, on through Mora, and finally into Taos Valley. The Rio Grande cuts a deep slice through the highland plateau that slopes off the base of the nearly 13,000 feet mountains that tower above Taos, creating a gorge that for all of human history until fifty years ago, separated the living cultures of eastern and western Northern New Mexico. Today, the Rio Grande Gorge Bridge spans over 600 feet above the river, and connects the town of Taos to our Earthship community, which is situated just across the Gorge on the road to Tres Piedras. The perfect flat, soft spot where the balloons launched this morning on the Santa Fe side of Albuquerque was created by the regular flooding of the Rio Grande that is now made impossible by the many dams along the river. Now, we’re driving along the Rio from Albuquerque to El Paso. As we passed Elephant Butte, a reservoir created by damming the Rio, it is clear that the water crisis did not miss the sleepy New Mexican town of Truth or Consequences. Here, too, the giant white stripe along the shoreline indicates where the water level remained for so many years that it bleached all the minerals that would otherwise color that sand and rock. The Butte’s sister lake, Caballo, lies just to the south, only now instead of a lake, there’s a wide, green field next to a pond that’s maybe a mile long and a half mile wide. Nature never intended a lake here, so it feels strangely sanguine to see the empty hole that looks perfectly fertile for chiles, or the new crops of grapes that some say will make Southern New Mexico the next Napa. It’s amazing to think that this little, winding flow of water has shaped the destinies of lives in this area for hundreds upon hundreds of years. In Hatch, it still fertilizes and quenches the chile crop. On the other side of Las Cruces, the Mesilla Valley is surrounded by pecan orchards, which irrigation lines allow the river to flood annually just as tradition intended. But just down the road, in the giant metropolis of at least 3 million people that is called El Paso in the US and Juarez in Mexico, the geographic location of a birth on one side of the river or the other determines that child’s propensity for malnutrition from poverty or obesity from affluence. One of the most populated regions of Juarez is what appears from I-10 in El Paso to be a shantytown made of cardboard and cinderblocks. From this barrio, residents can look out their doors and see a giant shopping mall to the Northeast and the University of Texas at El Paso to the Southeast. No border patrol agent or immigration policy on Earth could stop the swell of heart a parent must feel when they hope they can allow their children to access these two institutions of capitol. It’s not that they like America more than Mexico, in fact, the affluence towering over them often breeds contempt. But every year the Rio Grande or the elements along it claim the lives of hundreds and thousands who try to cross simply so the hunger pains that plague their own bodies will not be felt by their children. Last year, for the first year in recorded history, the Rio Grande did not flow into the Gulf of Mexico. It’s life-giving waters were simply tapped too many times from its source to its mouth, and the cycle that is water’s journey from mountain stream to ocean swell to cloud was not completed. Native Americans have long said the droughts we suffer now are caused in large part because the dams keep the offerings of the people from reaching the God of the ocean who replenishes water through rain. Any way one looks at the semantics, the chi or the energy of the water is halted by the efforts of man upstream. Ironically, the lakes formed by the dams are hindering even the purposes for which they were built. More water is lost through evaporation than could be saved by the constant access of a reservoir. Because the floods that used to fertilize and renew the fields along the river are halted, the silt they would scatter now clogs the bottom of the reservoirs. Along with the silt, dangerously consentrated poisons from runoff of fields treated with chemicals, highway construction materials, and airborn pollutants lie in wait for some future generation to right this wrong.

 This morning we woke up early and drove to Albuquerque—we’d lodged in Santa Fe at my bio-pop’s—making our way through breaking fog and clearing clouds as the sun rose. We wound around the Sangre de Cristo Mountains just in time to see the first balloons of the Albuquerque Balloon Fiesta lifting off. The Fiesta is the biggest ballooning event in the world and it’s a wonderful family tradition to catch it every fall we can for at least one day. Mass Ascension today involved over 700 balloons from all over the world, and the best part was that admission was free because of a rain delay. I have to say it’s never very expensive. We often remark on the comparison of any crappy event in Houston charging $15-20 per person while the Fiesta charges a mere $5 per person for arguably the best show on Earth. This year we actually knew one of the balloon teams. We felt such a sense of pride as we searched out B6 on the field, but when we finally found it, the spot was empty. Then, standing in their spot, we looked up just in time to see their balloon launch from the other end of the field! We were a little disappointed we missed them, but it’s impossible to be unhappy at this amazingly uplifting (I swear that pun was not on purpose) event. They’ll be there all week, so if you go, look for the Driftin’ Along Balloon team at B6. Their balloon is black, blue, and red horizontally, with yellow vertical slashes. The big thing people do at Balloon Fiesta is to pick a shape or color of a balloon that you particularly like, then stand around it in a giant crowd as it fills. Often, during this process members of the team hand out cards with a picture of their balloon on it and contact info, and if you’re very lucky, they’ll give out a pin. Then, when at last the balloon takes off the crowd that has waited so patiently all along cheers and claps and waves to the crew as they take off. If you’re a truly dedicated fan, you keep tabs on the balloon as it enters “the box,” a phenomenon unique to Albuquerque where balloons raise up in the air and catch a north/south airflow down the mountain, push west at the break in the terrain, then catch an south/north airflow that returns them almost exactly to the balloon field where they land. When the box is not in effect, or plans go otherwise wrong, chase teams in four-wheel-drives have a fantastic raucous time reaching and collecting the crew.

 Yesterday we met up with a friend of a friend, an architect who, along with her husband, trained in architecture at Yale and somehow ended up here in Taos, designing houses with a slightly green tilt for the wealthy minority in this beautiful little impoverished villa. The woman was very nice and I’m sure she’s a very talented architect, but I cannot understand her path in life. I honestly don’t mean to judge here, again, she was a great person in and of herself. But why go all the way to Yale for such an esteemed and expensive education to design houses for rich people in Northern New Mexico? Such an endeavor could just as easily be undertaken with a state school education. What was even more mystifying is that we met her in the pretext of attempting to combine John’s and my experience with the UN, my experience in grassroots organizing, John’s experience testing and creating safe water supplies, with her experience in sustainable living (she used to live in and help design Earthships) for the creation of a sustainable living proposal for the United Nations. However, in the face of all our ideas—and at least she had the guts and articulation to make this clear—she said her interest was really much more in how such sustainable living ideas could be marketed here in America. So I’m left with these questions. And they’re questions, not judgments, I honestly don’t know the answers. Did Yale, or the Ivy League pedagogy at large, create these very creative capitalists? Did their education make them risk adverse? How can anyone not want to save the world? Does Yale attract people who are already this way? We’re moving on. Unfazed, we see that the individuals involved in the Earthship movement have much to offer our greater desires to improve the quality of life for individuals living in developing countries. The attempt for this venture can only result in good because the worst outcome is no real product to offer the UN or NGOs or other humanitarian institutions, but a lot of time wasted enjoying Northern New Mexico along the way. At best, maybe we really have something here. Maybe…

 The clouds lifted and we were right, it did snow on the peaks! I don’t expect the small accumulation to stick on the ground for more than an hour or two, but what an honor to be here for the year’s first snow! Last night Aidan awoke crying the saddest cry in the middle of the night. It breaks my heart to hear his nightmare cries. Last night he seemed consumed with worry about fish and whales, but today he talked about his uncle Michael and Grandpa Phil. Aidan is so sensitive, I hope he’s just working through thoughts and emotions rather than sensing some danger. John and I decided we need to go talk to the Solar Survival people again today. We need to know more about the next step and about which lots are available at which prices.

 Yesterday we drank deep from the pool of inspiration, we walked around all day drunk with dreams of the possibilities. Today, we urge ourselves to question the dreams, hold them to the light and see how much we can really do. The weather is fitting for such a day, providing a rainy and gray backdrop for our examinations. The thing is, I think we’re still going to do it! The rain moved in in the middle of the night. The pattering of fat droplets on the skylights woke us up. The aroma of rain on the dry, desert sand filled the house and reminded us of what we had forgotten, that rain in New Mexico is the sweetest smell on Earth. Rain fell off and on all night, it was a comforting sound, lulling us to dreams. This morning we watched the clouds and their descending horizontal rain bands move across the giant highland that slopes down from the base of the mountains. The air that moved in with the rain is so cold, we are sure that it is snowing in the ski valley. Today we had hoped to return to the Williams Lake trail, but I think we waited one day too long. Now we’ll have to wait until spring! You would never guess is it so cold outside by sitting in here, though. The floor is comfortable without socks, and the air in the room is warmed enough by the sun that we haven’t even thought of lighting a fire. When Aidan opens the door to run outside, the air is such a shock! It must be 40 degrees out there! We drank hot chocolate and soy milk upon waking. Now, John’s putting a pot of beans on the stove and the kids are playing busily. All is right with the world on this, our last day in the Earthship.

 I can think of no better way to bring in the month of fall than our drive to the Williams Lake trail, through Arroyo Seco, though Taos Ski Valley, past the gigantic multi-million dollar ski lodges, almost all the way to Wheeler Peak itself, to the back bowl of the ski area where a little restaurant called the Bavarian awaits alongside a trailhead that goes up one side of Wheeler Peak and down the other side to Red River. Today we took the tour at the offices of Solar Survival, the company that originally bought the land that is now the Earthship community. We watched a little video and looked at many pictures. We asked all our questions about logistics and costs and availability, then drove through the homesites, dreaming of which one would be the perfect place for our very own someday Earthship. The picture of life here we have lived is a rather traditional one, which in itself is ironic considering the very modern technology we’re accessing here. We sleep in one room with Aidan on a palette on the floor next to our bed and the baby Ella co-sleeping in my arms. We find ourselves rising and setting with the sun. A pot of pasole or beans seems to be omnipresent on the stove and tortillas are always available to accompany the feast. I think today we must have felt adequately purged of modern living because my son asked if he could watch Shrek, the first mention of TV or movies in the tech fast that turned four days old today, and we acquiesced. We took out the computer and attached headphones so that the noise would not disturb the amazing peace of sound that exists here. Later though, we attached speakers to the laptop and listened to a few mixes of music, carefully chosen to be apt soundtracks for the location: U2, DMB, Leonard Cohen, and David Gray. Tonight we’re missing the new West Wing, but we know my parents will Tivo it for us. Last night a storm was brewing and I felt wary, a bit of storm PTSD left over from our Lake Powell adventure. I wished for the weather channel or weather.com to inform me, but instead slept soundly as the storm passed by. Sleep here is deep and quenches. The night is so dark that when you open your eyes they might as well be closed. I feel like my family is resting inside the palm of the Earth’s outstretched hand here. Is it that all the electrical fields of modern homes disturb rest? Or is the vibe of this place, conceived and constructed in love for the earth, so good that it gives rest like a gift to its visitors? Time seems to move here at a pace so different, we have yet to quantify it. At times, a minute lasts an hour, at others, a second. We seem to have been here a month, or a day. Memories capture a rapidly passing week, but experience lasts much longer.

 Throughout my various holiday visits with relatives, the issue of homosexual individuals in the church and in same sex marriages was very prevalent. The zeitgheist seems to have also caught up urlLink Will Safire , who I could take or leave. He voices the typical version of this dialogue that says disallowing s-s-m seems to be a breach of civil rights, while allowing it doesn't hurt anyone on either side. This link, like all NYT links, will die soon, and requires registration. Wish I could help you there, but they're on to that now. Since I've wrapped myself around this conversation so many times in the past days, expect more than a few articles to be on the topic. As a matter of disclosure, I'm totally for s-s-m, but begrudgingly because I don't think the government should have anything to do with marriage anyway. There's already common law marriages that make living together a legal marriage for tax purposes, and that should certainly include same gender couples. Let's just make marriage a religious institution alone.

 urlLink Guardian Unlimited | Arts features | The Monday interview: Marilyn Manson : "I predicted before he [Bush] was elected that this would be a much more prosperous time for art and it has been. I'm not saying that I want Bush to continue. Or not continue. I just make the best of it and get lost in something else.' "

 The first thanksgiving was in celebration of the political refugees' survival of their first year away from the motherland. Probably because so many of the group did not survive, the expats found themselves extremely grateful to the natives who fatefully made that survival possible by teaching them the ways of the land. Since, Thanksgiving has become for European and Native American cultures alike an occasion dedicated to the conquest of the Americas by Europeans. To this degree, I feel guilty gathering with my family in the name of a day centered on such a horrible tradition of removing one way of life and replacing it with another--in a word, genocide. Culturally, in my life, Thanksgiving always represented a predominantly matrilineal gathering of family, who endeavored to cook their asses off from pre-dawn hours until mid-afternoon. Currently, we take turns attending dinners at either my parents' houses or my husband's parents' house, usually my husband cooks the turkey and the various other women in our lives make the side dishes. I like to sit in the living room with their husbands and watch the football game. Therefore, in my life, Thanksgiving is mostly about food and family gathering. Last year I was too pregnant to travel to anyone's homes for the holiday, so everyone came to my house. My tiny little 900 square foot house hosted a gathering of 18 people! 19, if you count my precious Ella, still in utero. I was fascinated by the notion that I could join the long lineage of women who had hosted giant gatherings for holidays or funerals or just because in my ancient century house. The pressure of hosting my first holiday meal was enormous. I can't tell you how much I stressed over every detail, the centerpieces, the seating, the serving dishes, the order of dishes into the oven. John prepared the turkey the night before, and then woke up at four in the morning to begin cooking it! Partly because most of our guests had never eaten a free range bird, and partly because of my husband's culinary genius, it was fantastic. Everyone said everything was. We felt great pride in our accomplishment. And, with the meal's successful conclusion, I felt strangely indoctrinated into the realm of womanhood within my family somehow. And I was thankful. Thankful I'd survived it without going into labor, thankful my little house held everyone, thankful the weather had been beautiful so everyone could overspill outdoors, and thankful that everyone said it went perfectly. Every year when I was growing up, before Thanksgiving meal my mother would make everyone at the table say what they were thankful for. I hated it. I felt it was the worst tradition in the world, and when I was put on the spot as we went around the room I would have to mumble something to the effect that I was thankful for my family and home. We tended to have elderly relatives living with us, near their lives' end and turning to my family after others had turned them away. That person would inevitably start crying and then we all would as they professed their gratitude toward my parents. This too somehow always embarrassed me. Two years ago was the first time ever that my mom did not make us take turns around the table to say what we were thankful for, and I have to say I was the most thankful Iâ€™d ever felt on the occasion dedicated to gratitude. We hadn't planned on going home for the holiday, but two weeks before, I miscarried our daughter Grace, and I needed to leave Houston and my job--which I naturally, but erroneously blamed--and cry in my mom's lap. For the first time probably ever, she did not invite guests over, and we ate a small subdued meal. My husband and I had a hard time wanting to feel like a holiday was passing without our baby, and my parents accommodated our need well. I thought the omission of the thankful tradition would only be observed that one year. Unfortunately, a few months later we found out my cousin Scott had severely advanced cancer died a month before the next Thanksgiving, the one I hosted. My aunt and uncle who were his parents, along with his widowed wife and daughter were among my guests, so naturally, my mother again forwent her question. This year, we sat down to the table in Taos with my parents, and Scott's parents, and my two beautiful young children, and I felt pressure to bring up the tradition. I think I was afraid if I didn't, it would die forever. Even though I would still die of embarrassment in the spotlight, that embarrassment has become a necessary presence in my experience of the Thanksgiving holiday. I told my mom, Mom, do you know what I'm thankful for? She smiled really big and said what. I had never mentioned her omission, so I think she was surprised that I remembered. I said I'm thankful that we haven't said what we're thankful for in two years. She laughed and everyone did, then she said, So what are you really thankful for? Of course I was unprepared, I stalled and laughed nervously and made a joke, and everyone entered a common conversation about what they were thankful for, and it turned out no one was on the spot. I think maybe the tradition evolved! Finally, my uncle said we should all be thankful we were still above ground. It took me a moment to understand what he meant, but I realized that thanksgiving hasn't changed that much in all these years. It's still about being grateful to God or the Supreme Creator or the Unmoved Mover or whatever that you're still alive, and celebrating that fact with those who helped you survive.

 Since I was so dependent on other media sources, here are some links (mostly audio) of interesting things I came across this past week: urlLink KTAO and urlLink KUNM both aired a weekly show called urlLink etown , that is like Garrison Kiellor's Prairie Home Companion for the slightly groovier crowd. It was really, really good. To listen to E-Town archived shows, you have to register, and usually I think registering is evil and stupid, but in this case, it's worth it. urlLink Go listen to the November 19th Show . The Lucy Kaplansky bit is the best, her closing song on 9/11 made me cry. It perfectly voiced the virtually unspoken concern and trauma the liberals of the country felt that day. If you don't want to join etown, you can still urlLink listen live weekly here . Weekend Edition this morning ( urlLink linked here , but scroll for individual stories) had interesting stories titled Love Trap and Open Heart. I'm sure the rest of the world knows already about the El Paso customs confiscation of bologna, but they're interview with the agent was pretty funny. urlLink Yesterday's Morning Edition had interesting stories titled Little Hunter and Low Wage Workers. Catching up on a few other blogs, David Weinberger was urlLink funny re. the bible here , scroll up a day for his interesting insight on the media and urlLink Dean . Raed of urlLink Where is Raed has been very busy. He was blessed by Bush's visit, nearly crushed by an American convoy, and stopped at a checkpoint for carrying a camera.

 Welcome home everyone, hope your holiday was restful and filling. I never did find service in Taos, but I wrote a few blog entries, so I'll be p-blogging the week sometime soon. It was a funny experience, to be without a connection all week. Other issues kept me from writing much at all, and so my computer and I took a brief separation. I can't share in the usual comments on separations of this nature--you know, the cleansing feeling of disconnection from technology, or the relishing of time to my brain alone without a keyboard to interpret it--rather, I felt jumbled and not quite mentally clear until I was back to writing regularly. What a full week in the news, too! And I had to experience it all through newspapers (the paper kind), CNN, and my rather conservative relative. When I did write, I knew if I blogged it wouldn't go up live, and to be honest, that took a bit of the magic away for me. I don't exactly have a huge audience following, but I do have regulars and I worried what they would think of my long unexplained absense. Today I checked my sitemeter to find my average dropped, understandable, but my google page rank must have increased because I'm getting a lot more hits off google searches. I feel kind of bad about that because I don't think these people are finding what they seek, but maybe they'll stick around as fans.

 Finally, on the forth day here, Taos is beginning to sink in. The afternoon rains we enjoyed so much in September are afternoon snowshowers now in late November, and theyâ€™re just rolling in for the day. A cold wind rubs up against the house in stern gusts, but Iâ€™m warm and protected inside giant windows that let me view it all without braving the 20 degrees a few inches away. My issues were threefold. First, my computer was ill, and we finally remedied the poor thing last night. This computer is like an extension of my brain, and when it was muddled, I felt muddled. After clearing the free space on the hard drive from 5% to 20%, largely be deleting my unused adobe suite and two movies, and a good cleansing defrag on both fronts, we are both thinking much clearer. Second, our Earthship was in the gravel pit out at Greater World, New Mexico. While I celebrate and applaud the efforts to reclaim this scar left on the land by usurpers of this bountiful terrain, I found myself too dependent on a straight line of sight to the grand Wheeler Peak and Taos Mountain to live for long down below in the pit. Finally, it just took this long for the wearying waves of stress and pressure that was the past six weeks to wear off. So here I am, on day four, in my parents rentalâ€”a lovely adobe outside of Taosâ€”alone with John and two sleeping babes, at last opening a word doc to write. Itâ€™s good to be back. KTAO is just wrapping up todayâ€™s episode of Who Are You (you gotta sing the song when you say that: Who Who, Who-ooh are You). Itâ€™s a great show, despite the song. The show is founded on the idea that a lot of amazing creative people from wild backgrounds are here in Taos. The host lets the guest of each day chose the music and between sets they just talk. I didnâ€™t catch the guyâ€™s name who was on today, but he was really great. He said, â€œA lot of people are really offended by my lyrics, but actually my guitar playing is far more blasphemous.â€� Their conversation was so intimate, it gave me a fly on the wall, voyeur feeling I was really grooving my way into. Iâ€™m sorry it ended. Why canâ€™t KPFT be more like KTAO? KTAO is so unpretentious, where KPFT just tries too hard. I donâ€™t even think they know what theyâ€™re trying so hard to be. Iâ€™m partly forever bitter toward KPFT because I interviewed there once and they didnâ€™t hire me. But I was pregnant, and letâ€™s be honest, who wants to hire a pregnant woman. Unlike KPFT, KTAO isnâ€™t public, itâ€™s for profit. Itâ€™s the worldâ€™s first solar radio station. They arenâ€™t evil because theyâ€™re for profit either. Theyâ€™re just really ethical about their advertisers and the averts donâ€™t take over the programming. Like this program I was listening to was in a real rhythm so you could tell they put off the ad-break. On weekday mornings they have this community program where anyone can call in for anything. People call in to say theyâ€™ve lost their dog, or theyâ€™re selling a couch, or renting a house, you name it. Monday we were listening and a woman called in to say sheâ€™d lost her golden retriever. Then, toward the end of the show, a woman called in to say sheâ€™d found a golden retriever, and just like that a dog was reunited with its family. I wanted to cry, it was so beautiful. This guy Brent just sits in the studio and answers the phone rapid-fire style, â€œHi, whoâ€™s this?â€� And someone says, â€œHi Brent, this is Julia!â€� â€œOh, Hi Julia, howâ€™ve you been?â€� â€œJust fine, fine, except you know my mother isnâ€™t doing so good, well sheâ€™s moving to Espanola tomorrow to live with my sister and we donâ€™t want to take her couch, so if anyone wants to come pick it up this afternoon, itâ€™s free for the taking.â€� â€œGreat Julia, what number can they reach you at?â€� and it goes on and on like this for an hour every morning. This close community feeling is prevalent all over New Mexico, I really missed it when I was gone, and I didnâ€™t know that until I started spending more time here again. Last night my mom and I stopped in at the little liquor store after dinner and the girl behind the counter was telling us about this one label that her parents (the owners) carry just for this one guy because heâ€™s a family friend. We got a bottle and I got to thinking I liked her taste, so I asked her where her favorite restaurant was. She said she likes the Outpost in Ranchos de Taos, and the Bravo pub in town. Great advice! We wished her a good night, like we really meant it, not like the polite necessity in the city, and left for home.



 urlLink Marianne sent this , thanks honey!

 I'm laying on the couch watching Bravo's West Wing daytime re-runs (It's the Throw an Elbow episode, didn't you love that one? What a pleasure to get to watch it again). My back went out this morning as I leaned over to put the kids in their carseats. Believe it or not, this problem actually originated yesterday when I had a spike in creativity. For the past week I've been pressing myslef to complete some pieces so I can send them to my cousin who has graciously accepted the job of editor. She's an actual professional editor, but she's living in France w/o a work Visa at the moment and is a little low on work. So yesterday the muses finally hit me over the head with their magic finishing wands and I hit it hard. I wrote and wrote and wrote. The words were coming so fast that I had to improve my typing posture so that I could lift my palms from the keyboard and type faster, and that's what did it. My arms connect to my backbone in muscles that intersect and sinew their crafty selves just under my rib cage. And that's the spot that stopped working and started spasming this morning. This is especially bad because I need those muscles to carry around my baby daughter. And so I find myself laying nealry flat on the couch with my laptop on my hips, blogging along as I research remedies for back pain. So far I've found urlLink this . I don't know if it'll cure my own back pain, but maybe it can treat my husband's otherwise incurrable bad posture. Worth a try, don't you think? I'm trying to focus on loving the muscles, encouraging them to heal themselves, align or stop spasming, or whatever it is they need. But man, did they pick a bad time to freak out. One week later and I'll be coolin' it in the high desert of the most beautiful state in the nation... but no. Stupid back. No, no, I love you back, please stop hurting me...

 Metrosexuality has nothing to do with "testicular fortitude" and everything to do with dropping the tired old gender roles that delegate men to the hunting shed and women to the kitchen. This, paired along with urlLink personal experiences and Rush's kind wording urlLink this week swearing he's not been turned into a "weenie liberal" by detox (stupid me, I actually hoped the man might gain some sense of compassion), has just knocked me over the edge. With their backs against the losing wall, conservatives are just urlLink showing their asses and I'm starting to get really offended. Apparently, if US citizens urlLink aren't urlLink gun tot'en , urlLink NRA card carrying , urlLink GOP supporting , urlLink war mongering urlLink misogynists , then they just aren't urlLink patriotic .

 Christopher Allbritton's website urlLink Back in Iraq 2.0 is nominated for a the Utne Independent Press Award. He so deserves it. He's a former bigtime reporter who went independent for the war to bring in the real, un-US censored news. Now he's back in NY, but he wants to get back to the action so go donate to his cause. He wrote in urlLink his epilogue : "So what comes next? For Iraq, no one knows. President Bush says the U.S. will install democracy but that doesn't include a Shi'a-led Islamic state a wise choice, even if it does leave the United States open to hypocrisy. We'll see to what degree democracy really does come to the new Iraq. But I know this: The American people, in whose name this war was waged, need to hold this administration's feet to the fire. It's obviously too late to stop this war, but we as a democratic nation still have a responsibility to make the aftermath as beneficial to the Iraqi people as possible now that it's over. That means that corporate cronyism that seems to be the preferred method for awarding lucrative rebuilding contracts needs to be protested loudly. Any backsliding on democratic actions or a disconnect between administration actions and rhetoric have to be combatted as vigorously possible. "The anti-war crowd would be criminally irresponsible if it just washes its hands of the matter and considers the battle to halt military action in Iraq a failed cause and moves onto the next cause celebre. And if the pro-war people think they now have a right to say, "We told you this war would go well," they damn well also have a responsibility to hold the people they supported to their word. It's time for them, the "winners" in the "Should we go to war or shouldn't we?" debate, to put up or shut up."

 All her topics are good. I'd link to specifics, but she doesn't permalink. She did mention that NYT is on to her scheme that protected blog readers from having to sign on. She always provided a uniform sign on and password (pocket for both) and that doesn't work anymore. If she makes a new one, they shut it down within days. I think it's their loss. Blog readers aren't going to go get their own accounts, they'll just move on.

 thanks to urlLink rageboy , we can all go take the urlLink personality disorder test and find out!

 wow, driving around Houston this morning was a trip! Cars were scattered everywhere like carnage from left behind (who would have guessed I'd have cause to reference that tripe two days running?). They must have flooded out in the streets, then tossed around in the water. This morning, with the water receded, it all just looks surreal. The bayous are still up street to street, but at least not over the street in most places. Where they did go over the streets, mud bars now scar across the lanes. If you read my post from last night, you know how overplayed I thought the whole flood was, but the scenes today are enough to inspire me to retract. The traffic was crazy on every street this morning, and I couldn't figure out why, then I realized that I10 must still be flooded, or too littered with flooded out cars to be passable. It was an absolute river yesterday. But the important thing is how bright and clear the sky is. Yesterday, as all this rain started to move in, I remember thinking how pretty and vibrant the colors all seemed. Wet and sleek, bright against the gray of rain and clouds. Stoplights, headlights, crossing guard lights all captured my eye. And then I woke up and saw the sunlight this morning. Sun never looked so good! UPDATE: I've discovered that after a natural disaster that attacked cars in the city whose blood runs black, Houston quickly begins to look like a real city. The busses were clogged, the sidewalks were busy, the bikelanes were downright crowded! Good old Mama Nature took a popshot at Tom DeLay!

 urlLink Someone is blogging the freeways of Southern California (via urlLink blogsisters )

 My favorite part was when a News 2 reporter called into the studio and said he was at Westheimer and Shepherd and was watching a fridge float down the street. My sister-in-law and I had fun contemplating the insurance claim if you hit that. At another point, one of the stations' reporters went on this rant about the savage woman Mother Nature is, who takes out her wrath on buildings and trees and shrubbery. Oh God, not the shrubbery! I guess the flooding was moderately serious, some streets around the Katy Freeway were under 15 feet of water, but all in all things weren't as bad as the collective alliterative news stations would have us believe. After much of Houston had seen 8-10 inches of rain, they kept saying we should get 8 more. Now that's a scary prospect! Thankfully, it never came to pass.

 Sunday morning we awoke starving with absolutely no food in the house. It's not like I needed those excuses, though, so we happily loaded the family and headed to Croissant Brioche. We're in a terrible restaurant rut. We frequent about ten restaurants in the inner loop, and rarely break out for a new one. To understand what a tragedy this is, you have to know that Houston has more restaurants per capita than New York, and most of them aren't chains, they're original and individually owned, and typically have very good food. There's a reason Houston's the fattest city! But I digress... Ellie and I sat down, John and Aidan went off to order. A man sitting alone next to us smiled at Ellie and I made a casual comment about everyone loving babies. He said he had six kids! We got to talking and he said he was about to move his family to Guatemala. He is an ultralight instructor and does a lot of flight aid with Americares. He fell in love with Guatemala and he wants to go there and help people build houses, and give tourists ultralight flights to get by. I was in love with the picture he painted, and my brain really hung on what he said about building houses. I told him we have done some work with aid organizations that work to enhance technology transfer for developing countries and we're hoping to begin working with Earthships soon. He was pretty excited and said we just had to go see him in Guatemala and we would surely set up a housebuilding program there. We exchanged contact info and he went on his way. As we drove home, I was musing about the rhythm of our lives and the amazing connection we just made. It was like we were our own little hyperlink in the giant code script of life for that one moment. This happened similarly when we visited Chaco Canyon. I was sitting at the edge of the Kiva in the Big Room and the man next to me began talking to me. He was a solar engineer who lived in Wisconsin off grid, and made a living of helping others go off grid as well. This seed became our reservation to rent the Earthship in September, and the rest is history! Along the way home I noticed this pretty little shop called Tribal Hut had a going out of business sign and I asked John to stop so I could run in. As I browsed, the very friendly owner and I chatted. I asked if he was moving locations or closing forever. He said he just couldn't afford Montrose anymore and his own credit is shot from trying. He's going to take a trip for a few months and when he gets back he'll reevaluate and decide the answer to that. I think some part of me already knew the answer to the question, but I had to ask. Where are you going for your trip? Guatemala!

 urlLink Henry Panky pens many funny things, but I really love this urlLink Dubious Tidings from the Big Behind . It's a sort of satire as if someone who was "left behind" is telling about their life since the big desertion. The whole thing is amazingly clever and witty, but please allow me to quote one of my favorite passages: "Jesus, on the other hand, is taking His own sweet time. This is His big John-Travolta-Pulp-Fiction-like comeback moment, and he's not going to rush it. I'll tell you one thing though: He's tired of being Mr. Nice Guy. Ha! That didn't work! He wants some R-E-S-P-E-C-T. He's gonna open a can of whoop-ass and rule with a "rod of iron." And finally, His immaculate heart is absolutely set on ... an expensive blow-it-all-to-Kingdom-come finale. But first, the stage must be set just so: cups of doom, seals of doom, horsemen of doom, baked beans of doom (basically anything that includes doom is a go); plaguey buboes, suppurating ulcers, oceans of hemoglobin, uber-locusts, heads on sticks, tax cuts for the rich, aliens with really long fingernails, dogs and cats living together! You get the idea - utter abomination. Give the people what they want." (via urlLink RRiverstone )

 Already ready to be in New Mexico, I decided to read up on urlLink Rogi Riverstone's blog , she's an Albuquerque artist and writer who gets much material and inspiration from dumpsters. In urlLink this very funny entry , Rogi was unfortunately (for the caller) on the call list of a marketing survey about One Life to Live. She explained that she didn't like it, but she has to watch because the soap she likes is on when she's working. Her critique of OLTL was great though, I'll quote my highlight: "I like Roxy because she's the ONLY working class character left! And you mock her like she's just sleazy trailer trash! There are REASONS why low income, single mothers become chemically dependent and are obsessed with their looks." My grandparents always watched this soap. I know it's silly, but sometimes I watch just to remember what it felt like to be with them on a summer afternoon when school was out and my mom was working. Otherwise, I'm a DOOL lifer.

 urlLink Clergy Group to Counter Conservatives : "In the recent nearly 40-hour debate in the Senate over four of President Bush's judicial nominees, religious-based conservative groups offered running commentary to the news media, suggesting that the nominees were being blocked because of their religious faith. The Clergy Leadership Network, said the Rev. Brenda Bartella Peterson, the group's executive director, will seek to provide alternative opinions in such debates. "Jenny Backus, a Democratic consultant working with the new group, said: 'There's been a concerted effort by Christian conservatives to question the faith of people who disagree with their positions in the same way that they question their patriotism. The Clergy Leadership Network will now be the amen corner for people of faith who express disagreement with the administration and the Christian Right.'"

 urlLink The Observer | Review | Miranda Sawyer meets Jack Osbourne : "Their unique combination of love, swearing and rock'n'roll have made them the world's favourite TV family, after the Simpsons.... "Before The Osbournes, Jack was working as a band scout for Epic Records. He'd left British public school the day before his sixteenth birthday without any qualifications, having decided that he wanted to work his way up in the music business, like his mum (Sharon's a notoriously tough band manager). The show put paid to all that. But then, as Jack points out, it's also landed him a different job, as presenter of Union Jack, a new Channel 4 series that starts next Sunday. 'It's an off-the-wall-interview-look-at-LA type thing. Interviews, movie reviews, then I'll talk about different things in Los Angeles. Hopefully, it's going to be funny,' muses Jack. 'I've got one of the writers from Bo' Selecta! on it.' "

 I noticed a little bump in average hits. I think, hmmm, maybe google searches on abortion? Then I look into referring pages and see urlLink Gwenworld all over the place! Turns out, Gwen's been doing some clever surfing and included me in her bread crumb (or shall that be crum? silly language. private pun from her blog) trail, called linkelodian. Speaking of links, I followed the link of urlLink Twiddlybits , who gave me a shoutout in the whole urlLink redted abortion argument . Even though, or maybe especially because we were totally talked over by a couple of guys (rather poignant in light of the topic, men legislating women's bodies), I wanted to follow up on just who this courageous speaker outer was. Oh my. She has the sexiest sex blog I've ever seen. This definitely falls under the links on your blog urlLink your mom should not follow clause , and I don't feel silly saying that because even Mr. and Mrs. Bits, Twiddly and Dangly, clearly use pseudonyms. Anyway, good for you, Twiddly, taking charge of her sexuality and writing on a topic that has largely been taken out of the hands of women in the name of men who can *gasp* be tempted to abuse it. And we all stand in awe of your, er, urlLink orgasmic abilities .

 urlLink The Observer | Special reports | Cheney ignored war chaos alert : "Meyer revealed that Tony Blair had made a personal appeal to Bush in the new year to delay the war. At their Washington summit in January, Bush had made it clear that America was ready to attack the following month, well before all the diplomatic avenues had been exhausted and before Britain felt that its military capability was ready. 'Two issues had to be thrashed out,' Meyer said. 'Would the Americans support us going for a second resolution. The other was [that] we needed some delay - less to work through the diplomacy, more to get the British deployment there. "

 urlLink This NYT op-ed featured prominently on the list of most emailed articles this weekend. This guy basically calls for tough design guidelines for the World Trade Center Monument to protect NYC from looking like Houston. The detail missed is that a lot more people in NYC than in Houston care about how their city looks.

 I found urlLink this article from emedicine , which explained that before Roe v Wade, in 1965, at least 265 women died (surely more went unreported from the scandal associated with the act) that year from illegal abortions. The article also explained the nature of laws regarding the issue that have historically looped together contraceptive use and abortion. I quote: "Before the 19th century, most US states had no specific abortion laws. The provisions of British common law took precedence, and women had the right to terminate a pregnancy prior to viability. Beginning with a Connecticut statute and followed by an 1829 New York law, the next 20 years saw the enactment of a series of laws restricting abortion, punishing providers, and, in some cases, punishing the woman who was seeking the abortion. The first US federal law on the subject was the notorious Comstock Law of 1873, which permitted a special agent of the postal service to open mail dealing with abortion or contraception in order to suppress the circulation of “obscene” materials. From 1900 until the 1960s, abortions were prohibited by law. However, the Kinsey report noted that premarital pregnancies were electively aborted, and public and physician opinion began to be shaped by the alarming reports of increased numbers of unsafe illegal abortions." Also interesting, I found urlLink from the Allen Guttmacher Institute that the legality of abortion almost never plays a consequence in the rate at which women seek abortions. I quote: "Yet, while it may seem paradoxical, a country's abortion rate is not closely correlated with whether abortion is legal there. For example, abortion levels are quite high in Latin American countries, where abortion is highly restricted. (In fact, 20 million of the 46 million abortions performed annually worldwide occur in countries with highly restrictive abortion laws.) At the same time, abortion rates are quite low throughout Western Europe, where the procedure is legal and widely available. Also, Eastern and Western Europe have the world's highest and lowest abortion rates, respectively, yet abortion is generally legal throughout the Continent."

 ok, this story is very friend of a friend-ish, but identities are very sensitive regarding such topics. "A Friend" who is now into her senior years had no fewer than six miscarriages throughout the course of her marriage. The seventh time she conceived, she carried the baby the longest, I don't know how long exactly, I'm guessing by her words it was somewhere around the second or early third trimester. She began having complications with the pregnancy and was informed by her doctor that the baby could clearly no longer survive, and if she delivered, she would probably die too. With unbelievable pain, she and her husband decided to terminate the pregnancy to save her life. This woman is either a blue dog Texas Dem or a Republican, I'm not sure which, so her story utterly shocked me because she began to share it by stating her opposition to the newest legislation on late term abortions. She said, if this all occurred today, she would either urlLink be a fugitive for finding a way to end the pregnancy anyway, or dead because the procedure urlLink was made illegal this week , and no consideration for the mother's life was written into the law that bans late term abortions. urlLink Red Ted held urlLink quite an intense discussion on his website this week regarding urlLink pro-choice , urlLink anti-abortion positions. As a pro-choice woman who rarely gets to lay down my position, I was happy to comment this: I agree with Sebastian in that the pro-choice side is entirely too caught up in the gray. The bottom line is that the urlLink legal precedent cannot be set for government telling women what they can and urlLink can't do with their bodies . The sly anti-abortion argument is to take the most extreme example ( urlLink partial birth, or late term abortions ) to get the foot of precedent in the door. And yet, these abortions account for less than one tenth of one percent of all abortions in our country, and when they do happen, they are virtually always to save a woman's life. No doctor urlLink worth his spit would ever perform a late term abortion otherwise. The policy is there, and it's working. I'm going to take this discussion in an entirely different direction on my own blog, but regarding this, let me summarize that the legal status of birth control and abortion alike does not equate to a mandate for women to utilize these options, but rather leaves the decision up to the woman. urlLink If our society is going to respect women as individuals and give them the rights and freedoms they deserve, then these decisions too should be left to each woman. Whether using either is morally right or wrong is an issue a woman can take up with her mother or friend or pastor. Legislating it out of her hands (an act done almost entirely by men) is just another way to urlLink keep the woman down .

 urlLink The Observer | International | Private Jessica says President is misusing her 'heroism' You won't see this in the American sweeps frenzy. The closest I found tonight was PBS with the accounts of the many creative muzzles past administrations found for the press during war. Let's quote from urlLink the Observer : "Beneath the gloss of the US media and the machinations of an administration eager to show a 'good news' angle of the Iraq conflict against the reality of a rising body count, Lynch has become a metaphor not for the heroism of pretty young Americans captured by a devilish foreign enemy, but for the confusion that has marked Bush's Operation Iraqi Freedom from the start." You think that's good, it gets better: "Lynch now questions why her rescue was filmed: 'They used me to symbolize all this stuff. It's wrong. I don't know why they filmed it, or why they say these things.'" Any reader of my blog knows how bad urlLink I knocked the milking of Private Lynch . I must now retract absolutely everything I said. Turns out she had hero blood in her veins after all! She has the guts to stand up, in the light of media-made heroism worthy of an Oscar for screenwriting, and say that emperor is naked. On one hand, it's a win/win for Jessica because even in the light of her yelling into the wind version of the story, which is ignored by all but that urlLink crazy wacko urlLink foreign press , she gets millions in book contracts and movie rights. But on the other hand, urlLink the truth is out there , urlLink Mulder .

 in honor of urlLink lisa , and her questions about how/if I celebrate Vets, here are a few articles I had found on the big V day. urlLink In Evansville, IN, the veterans for Peace chapter held a protest .

 I really had a nice morning. We went to the Flaming Fall last night, an anual party that I thought had seen its end since Mich moved away and has always been the co-host. But she was in town visiting for the weekend, and Leeward and Marianne took the chance to have the party. We went, and I had a nice time dressing up and socializing. When we got home I fell into bed still in jewelry and make-up, exhausted, and we didn't even stay too late! This morning John let me sleep in until 10 and I awoke feeling so refreshed. I walked around all day with urlLink sex hair , and yet no sex had been had! We took a long walk, we went to the nice swing park along Buffalo Bayou. I swung with abandon! Then I raced up the grass hills with Aidan and we rolled down on our sides. Feeling so good about life, I made an important decision. I'm sick of walking around acting like second class goods. In our lives I'm always trying to make up for our age. At every parenting function we're the youngest parents by far. When my parents attended the Halloween Carnivale with us, I had fun pointing out that all the other parents were their age. The other moms always look sideways at me. I find myself filling in the gaps of their thoughts, I think they're putting me down for not exercising more family planning and waiting until an appropriate age to have kids. Similarly, at any work event for either of us, we're always the youngest. I remember back at MFAH, on the first day of my first real job ever, I was introduced in a staff meeting and this one woman said, so how old are you? I've spent the totality of my career since trying to hide that detail. Well no more. Our lives are fantastic. Epic. We're madly in love, and we were amazingly lucky to meet eachother as teenagers. We waited plenty long, probably too long, to get married. We enjoyed our marriage, and our lives, and we made a conscious, cerebral decision to enrich them with kids. Two big factors influenced that decision: 1) I knew my career would only become more involved and I wanted to have kids (a kid, at that point I only wanted one) while things weren't too intense to take the time off I needed, and 2) my OB-Gyn who performed my lap told us straight out that my fertility wouldn't last forever due to endometriosis. I guess there's also the hidden third factor, that all women in my family seem to conceive at 23. Physically or mentally, that was ingrained in me as normal. I don't regret it at all, I'm sick of pretending like I do. I don't want to get caught up in keeping up with the Jonses because really, I've already beaten them. Where were they at 26? Certainly not amid two exciting careers, living in a fun house downtown, with two gorgeous, perfect children. I'm a passionate, educated, crazy woman in my twenties. I have a sex life worthy of HBO, children worthy of ivy league, and a husband worthy of the nobel prize for engineering. Best of all, I'm nowhere near middle age. Life can only get better from here!

 urlLink Dean for America: Home : "Congressman Jesse L. Jackson, Jr. Praises Dean on Bringing Economic Agenda to the South November 1, 2003 Congressman Jesse L. Jackson, Jr., today said, 'This year we celebrated the 40th anniversary of Dr. King's famous speech in front of the Lincoln Memorial in 1963. Forty years later, Dr. Howard Dean is reminding us that the great task of uniting the northern black and white urban poor and working class, with the southern black and white rural poor and working class around common economic issues good health care, high quality schools, and affordable housing is the key to wrestling our democracy away from the race-oriented Republican right-wing. . . 'Normally, rather than directly confronting poor and working class white southerners with a strong economic agenda, Democrats have tried to imitate Republicans on many of these social issues. It is good that we have a candidate offering hope to the South with an economic agenda. It is Dr. Dean who is reminding us that the combination of poor and working class blacks and whites, north and south, united in coalition around a common economic agenda of jobs, health care, education and housing will constitute a winning strategy in 2004,' concluded Cong. Jackson." urlLink Look at the graph at the bottom of this page . 13% of Dean's donors gave gifts over $200. The numbers for Kerry, Gephardt, and Edwards are 53%, 56%, and 67% respectively. For Bush, it's 74%. Dean is definitely the working man's candidate.

 The urlLink Washington Post recently hosted an online public question/answer forum for Howard Dean. That's a little redundant, considering he hosts such forums all the time on his site and through blogging. But still, maybe this opened him up to a new audience. The questions people asked were so thorough, it gave me hope again for an educated and critical thinking electorate. We'd been wondering for a while what Dean's stance on space is. We're impressed to say the least: Dallas, Tex.: If elected President, what are your plans for NASA and the Space Program? Do you think it's time to retire the Shuttle and move on to bigger and better things, such as a human mission to Mars, or returning to the moon? Howard Dean: I am a strong supporter of NASA and every government program that furthers scientific research. I don't think we should close the shuttle program but I do believe that we should aggressively begin a program to have manned flights to Mars. This of course assumes that we can change Presidents so we can have a balanced budget again. Here were other highlights: Baltimore, Md.: You have received considerable rebukes over the past few days regarding your comments about southern voters. Putting aside your poor choice of imagery, it seems to me that you were right. I agree that the Democratic Party must make serious efforts to bring back into the fold disaffected poor, southern, white voters who have traditionally shared the economic priorities of the Democratic Party. My question is: how do you intend to do this? Howard Dean: I believe that although I should not have used the symbol of the Confederate flag, that the thrust of our strategy is the right thrust. We have to get people to focus on what we have in common in the south and elsewhere in this country. We have to stop the Republicans from dividing us on issues like race and abortion and guns and start focusing on the need for jobs, healthcare and education. That is the way to bring southern white voters back to the Democrats. _______________________ Concord, N.H.: Dr./Gov. Dean, many of your fellow candidates criticize NAFTA and the WTO for our country's loss of manufacturing jobs. What is your plan to help stop the loss of these jobs without America losing out on the long term economic benefits that come from free trade under NAFTA and the WTO? Howard Dean: Globalization is here to stay whether we like it or not, but the rules for globalization are not. Both NAFTA and the WTO help large multinational corporations but ignore the needs for the people who work for them -- not only in America but around the rest of the world. In order to make globalization work we also have to globalize worker protection, labor rights, environmental rights and human rights. Free trade won’t work under the present circumstances.

 I'm so addicted to my site meter. I watch it all the time. Did you know I show up at #9 for an MSN search on Yang LiWei but I'm nowhere near the top for Feighery or Same River Twice. The worst is that a google of annie feighery returns my blog as urlLink the tenth listing !

 I just voted for Howard Dean to opt out of federal matching funds. He put the decision out for his supporters to make. He's so cool. I voted for because I felt like the primary is where all the cookies crumble. Taking the funds caps the amount you can spend, and I feel pretty confident Dean supporters will give over and above the $14 mil he would have gotten. Plus, the more financially committed supporters he gets, the more votes he'll get in the primary. He should spend every dime he has between now and the primary. Right now his average contribution is small because his base is the common man. After he gets the nomination, he'll have the support of all those rich blue dogs who are just voting to beat W. When you urlLink go vote on whether or not he should take the funds , you're lead through a few after questions, spreadsheet style. One asks if you can urlLink commit to supporting financially between now and June. The next asks if you will urlLink pledge to vote for Dean in your primary . What a well conceived system. I was just going to vote, but then after voting I had to agree to support him at least a little bit, so I pledged. Then, I was afraid I'd forget to actually give the amount I pledged, so I went to the credit card form and gave the money. And of course I pledged to vote for him in the primary. It was like when you buy concert tickets and after you pay they send you to another operator that peddles some vacation package discount book on you. I always fall for that one.

 urlLink This NYT article is on ABC's editorial process for their special, Jesus, Mary, and da Vinci , which aired last night. My mom read the book that started all this, I should say, that brought all this to the surface of American pop-culture, The da Vinci Code . She told me the plot, and I'm getting ready to talk about it, so if you want to read the book, don't click on any links or read the rest of this blog. The plot weaves in a lot of theories about Christianity's origin, namely two, though. One that says Jesus and Mary Magdalene were lovers, got married, had a baby. Pretty standard urlLink Last Temptation stuff. The other says that the figure in the painting The Last Supper commonly thought of as an effeminate looking John is actually Mary Magdalene and, correspondingly, da Vinci and the Knights Templar held the secret that the Gospel of John's mention of the disciple Jesus loved is actually Mary. The weaving depends on the reader believing the Catholic Church purposefully and forcefully held the secret to protect the proper image of asexual religious leaders. Not a hard sell for some, especially in light of the church's recent problems. I have to say, the ideas the book puts forth would make it easier for me to believe. The church--the body of Christianity at large, Catholic and Protestant--is clearly not what Jesus meant it to be. I can believe in Jesus, but everything after gets fuzzy. A gigantic part of that stems from the books written by Paul that so malign women, and the actions churches take today that claim Paul as their justification. Last night I watched The Thornbirds and there was a line where Meggie asked the priest how God could condemn a man for loving a woman. This jives with my idea that God, who presumably created man and woman and love, would never want to set the ideal as a person that denies himself this. If Jesus and Mary were lovers, it makes sense that Mary was the first to go to him. As his spouse, it would have been her duty to prepare his body, and as the person most intimate to Jesus, he would have shown himself resurrected to her first. Most of all, I like the idea that Jesus loved . I don't mean love in the typical Greek three kinds of love way, either. I mean love , like the end of a hard day, share a look, eat, pay the bills, then find enough strength deep, deep down to still make love love . The Greek language of Jesus' day recognized friend love, passionate love, and selfless love. Spouse love is all three and then some, and if the language weren't a following of misogynist culture, there would have been a forth love word that recognized that. The bible covers all the other three, but it was written by, edited by men in an age that did not celebrate marital love. I can totally believe they left anything that could be construed as marital love out. I think all this da Vinci Code stuff is too trendy to even consider as true. I wish it were true though.

 I just watched urlLink Naked World on HBO . It was amazingly well done. I, like most everyone I presume, had a cursory awareness of Spencer Tunick's work, but now I feel pretty fluent in his work. This documentary followed the photographer as he traversed seven continents in the course of shooting his newest work, called Naked World, in which he captured so many individuals and groups from a wide array of countries including Canada, UK, Russia, France, Japan, South Africa, Antarctica, Brazil... The biggest installation was in Australia where 4,000 people came to volunteer for the shoot. The filmers interviewed one woman in France who captured my own experience of breastfeeding there perfectly. She said (I'm trying to remember exactly how she phrased it) the French are very open minded about nudity in art, but the French are very narrow minded about nudity in daily reality. It was the cake topper to a perfectly odd French day for me. If you're out of the loop, Tunick is famous for urlLink setting up photographic installations of naked people. I'm sure this will replay several times this week, I recommend catching it. It makes me sad to think that our own MFA here in Houston is doing nothing so fresh as this, would daren't do it, really. My very first job at the MFAH was in the photography department of curatorial. At the time, I felt a surge of creative edge, upcoming projects in the works then included Japanese Photography and Brassai. But this was MFAH

 Over and over again in my life, I find myself begging at the gate. I think it is my fatal flaw, my freudian conflict that my old brain recreates. I was born a veritable bastard, the child of the poor, disgraced family and the wealthy, powerful family in a town so small that those classifications mattered more than life itself. So, having never belonged to anyone's club, I've made quite an identity for myself by pretending I don't care. And yet, again and again, I apply to the impossible colleges, that have consistently either turned me down or fallen apart before I could get in. I get my toe in the door at the upper echelon workplace only to quit when I'm sickened by the possibility of really making it among such high-class thugs. This year was valuable in my journey toward self-awareness in that it more fully opened up the source of all my neuroses. I once thought it was my hoity-toity family members alone--who admonished me for opening doors for myself and not showering enough--who endeared me with this complex of illegitimacy. But this year I realized it was an endeavor equally contributed to by all the elements of my life. My family members of impoverished roots have all escaped their disgrace in that they made it out of shit town, almost all with nice degrees and well-to-do husbands. But, like Poe's heart pounding from beneath the floor, they out themselves. Their guilty conscience won't allow them to really escape their past, and they seem to despise me for not sharing that quality. Not that I've escaped my past either. But that doesn't seem to be the point anymore. And in a funny way, that's my problem now. Did you ever play that game as a child where you stand in a doorway and open your arms until your wrists hit the frame, then push up against the frame for a minute? Then, when you step out of the doorway, your hands still want to raise for a few minutes? This is my psyche. I've pushed so hard for so long against this obstacle of my past, that in its absence, I still find myself pushing. But against what? More importantly, toward what? We're in this really difficult state of flux thanks to the space program and my difficult pregnancies that combined to create for me a rather traditional role of mothering that I never desired or envisioned for myself. I don't mind it now, it's become a beautiful road in itself, but I need to know what's on the other end of this. John says that's why I've made this little career for myself in writing ethnographically about parenting and mothering, so that I can lose myself to my children without losing myself altogether. But it still seems that the end of that road, if I stay on it, is graduate school. I don't want to find myself pleading to yet another program director, like the president of a secret club I desperately want in to. I've used all my cards up for letters of recommendation. But can I really be an anthropologist without a graduate degree? When I say I'm an anthropologist now, I feel like a little girl playing dress-up. But I write! And that's what anthropologists do! I'm yelling into the wind now. The kids will be waking soon...

 in more traditional times, people lived by the cycle of harvest. Planting seasons, rain seasons, cold seasons were the milestones by which we humans navigated the passing of time. Of course, these days semesters and calendars are the primary milestones we mark. So functionally, New Years is a ritual of closure and renewal for us today. As a writer, I inevitably think of years as chapters, today I close the chapter titled 2003 and prepare to begin writing anew on the chapter titled 2004. Personally, New Year's Eve is a celebration of journaling, turned blogging!, because on New Year's Eve, 1992, my aunt Rossanna gave me a late Christmas present, a journal, when my family celebrated the holiday at her condo in Angel Fire, NM. I still remember the sense of purpose and hope with which I began writing as we all watched the torchlit skiers fly down the slopes, and the fireworks bring in 1993. I'd kept many periodic journals as a child, but that was the beginning of my adult literary life in a special way that still continues with this blog today. This morning I got out that old journal and skimmed through the pages. It primarily covers my experience through highschool, even though I filled it in 7 months. It was my sophomore year, the last year I'd spend in highschool, and a time of rapid and constant change, filled with innumerable memories of smalltown adolescence. This first volume of my journaling life is overly focused with my big romance of youth, which was at its peak the day before I began the journal as my mother narrowly managed to show up in time to prevent my first sexual experience (I'm still bitter about that!) and was cut off dramatically by elevator doors as I said goodbye to my friends and left for a year's study in Germany. Amazingly, I actually ran out of pages at that transitory moment! I remember thinking it such divine irony. The next two journals cover my time in Germany and France, my quick return home for my father's heart surgery, and finally, the crash of my great youth romance with a finely shattered heart (which, incidentally, was still sexually unrequited!). The year after that is covered in few slim pages as the excitement of college and eventually meeting John took every breath and minute. And so my life proceeds through the day I found out I was pregnant and John and I drove straight to the Bookstop (as it still was back then!) to learn everything we could as fast as we could, and I also took a few minutes to pick out two beautiful and graceful journals I felt reflected my new adventure into motherhood. The pages between here and there serve as a map crafted in retrospect to cover my journey through life. As I look at them, I'm so pleased with my life! I have to give credit to God, and the universe that God created, because my experiences are too grand, too diverse and directed for anyone to not see a guiding hand in this story. As I write that, a twinge of self consciousness pauses my fingers. I'm always embarrassed to admit my faith here. But I must. I've been so blessed and lived such a fantastic life, I cannot take the chance of being ungrateful.

 urlLink A NEW REASON FOR GRATITUDE: Essay by David Steindl-Rast : "The danger is violence regardless who commits it, terrorists or legitimate governments. No rhetoric, no posturing can any longer obscure the fact that violence breeds violence. We must break that cycle of madness. Violence has its roots in every heart. It is in my own heart that I must recognize fear, agitation, coldness, alienation, and the impulse to blind anger. Here in my heart I can turn fear into courageous trust, agitation and confusion into stillness, isolation into a sense of belonging, alienation into love, and irrational reaction into Common Sense. The creative imagination of gratefulness will suggest to each one of us how to go about this task."

 For the first year ever, I've actually taken the time to learn a little about Kwanzaa before the holiday ended (barely!). urlLink Here's a Kwanzaa information center , which explains: "KWANZAA, the African-American cultural holiday conceived and developed by Dr. Maulana Ron Karenga, was first celebrated on December 26, 1966. Kwanzaa is traditionally celebrated from December 26 through January 1, with each day focused on Nguzo Saba, or the seven principles. Derived from the Swahili phrase "matunda ya kwanza" which means "first fruits", Kwanzaa is rooted in the first harvest celebrations practiced in various cultures in Africa. Kwanzaa seeks to enforce a connectedness to African cultural identity, provide a focal point for the gathering of African peoples, and to reflect upon the Nguzo Saba, or the seven principles, that have sustained Africans. Africans and African-Americans of all religious faiths and backgrounds practice Kwanzaa. Kwanzaa was born out of the whirlwind of social and political changes of the sixties decade. The sixties represent one of many eras during which the African and African-American struggle for freedom and self-identity reached its historical peak, spawning multiple revolutionary movements. By creating Kwanzaa, African-Americans sought to rectify the cultural and economic exploitation perpetrated against us during the months of October, November, and December (the Christmas season). During this season, corporate America typically ignored the quality of life concerns of African-Americans, yet encouraged participation in the commercialism of Christmas. Additionally, African-Americans did not observe a holiday that was specific to our needs. A review of the major holidays celebrated in the United States would reveal that not one related specifically to the growth and development of African-Americans. The development of Kwanzaa assumed a reassessment, reclaiming, recommitment, remembrance, retrieval, resumption, resurrection, and rejuvenation of the "Way of Life" principles recognized by African-Americans. These principles have strengthened African-Americans during our worldwide sojourn."

 urlLink In Houston, Residents Cringe as They Ponder the Gridlock to Come : "Roadway expansion and tracks for a new light rail line have disrupted traffic for years in the city, the nation's fourth most populous and with more square miles (about 600) than Los Angeles (about 475). But two projects in particular have led residents to sue. One involves a notoriously clogged intersection of Interstate 10, the east-west highway known as the Katy Freeway that bisects Houston, and the 610 Loop that rings the city. In a federal lawsuit filed in October, residents asserted that the Federal Highway Administration and the Texas Department of Transportation had expanded the scope of its reconstruction without proper environmental review. The other involves a rebuilding of the Highway 59 spur to downtown. Shutting down all or most of that roadway — again without proper environmental review, residents claim in another lawsuit — would divert onto local streets more than 40,000 cars each way daily."

The Literary Review's Bad Sex Prize, which reaches the parts other prizes can only moan about, was won last night by the Indian author Aniruddha Bahal, for his novel Bunker 13. His publishers, Faber and Faber, flew him in from Delhi to receive his statuette. Columnist and former Today programme editor Rod Liddle was almost struck out on the grounds that his sex scenes were actually rather well done, but his novel Too Beautiful for You, ('after a modicum of congenial thrusting, she came with the exhilarating whoops and pant-hoots of a troop of Rhesus monkeys') was reinstated after he said the judges were unqualified, since nobody on the Literary Review had had sex since 1936, in Abyssinia. The prize was started 11 years ago by the late Auberon Waugh, to mock 'redundant passages of sexual description in the modern novel'. "

 I still want to rent out my house and travel trailer during the Super Bowl. I'm changing the price structure slightly after researching what everyone else is doing. Most places around us are charging by the day, so I'm following suit. To rent the house, I'll charge $500/day, and to rent the trailer, I'll charge $350/day. The two together rent for $700/day. I've had no offers or inquiries, so email and make me a deal! For a description of the house and trailer, page down to December 26. Also, I've got friends who live very close to the stadium and/or lightrail, who also want to rent their places. If my place rents, or just won't work for you, chances are I'm still a good contact for Houston Super Bowl rentals...

 urlLink Daily Kos || Political Analysis and other daily rants on the state of the nation. : "The Iowa Caucuses are a peculiar beast. People cast an initial ballot for their guy. But, if their guy doesn't break the 15 percent barrier, they can change their vote to a more viable candidate. In essence, supporters will work hard to garner the votes of the other caucus goers to get their guy as many votes as possible. In the past, each caucus was a self-contained election. There was little the candidates could do to sway the votes of their supporters. But we now have a dandy new tool called the cell phone, and the caucuses may never be the same. In short, campaign organizers can now call each individual caucus and attempt to move their supporters en masse to whatever candidate they choose. So, if early in the night, it appears that Dean is headed for a narrow victory, Kerry could move five percent of his supporters, via a few cell phone calls, onto the Gephardt column. A Gephardt win would obviously serve Kerry's interests heading into the NH primary. But Kerry has been showing a bit of strength in Iowa lately, so he may want to cling to every percentage he's got. However, Edwards may have up to 10 percent he may be able to shift around. Clark and Lieberman may collectively have another five percent (though without an Iowa ground operation, it might be tough to move those supporters). "

 urlLink Guardian Unlimited | Special reports | When God goes to war : "The scriptures all bear scars of their violent begetting, so it is easy for extremists to find texts that seem to give a seal of divine approval to hatred. War affects all aspects of human behaviour, so when conflict becomes chronic, it should be no surprise that religion is also infected. This is certainly what happened at the time of the Crusades. In a similar way, the Christian right today has absorbed the endemic violence in American society: they oppose reform of the gun laws, for example, and support the death penalty. They never quote the Sermon on the Mount but base their xenophobic and aggressive theology on Revelation. Osama bin Laden is as just as selective in his use of scripture. Most of the Muslim extremism that troubles us today is the product of societies that have suffered prolonged, hopeless conflict: the Middle East, Palestine, Chechnya, Afghanistan, Kashmir."

 The whispy thin clouds of the desert highlands have been replaced by fat ocean clouds, and the azure blue sky is now a pale hue of its former glory. Still, excepting the geography, I’m happy to be almost home. I can’t wait for my bed with my sheets and thick duvet, my kitchen with my meatless organic food, the kids’ room, completely safe and filled with toys so John and I don’t have to choreograph which one socializes and which one watches kids… Every trip is immeasurably great for the kids. Their little synapses thrive on diverse experiences. I also love traveling, I crave it, even have withdrawals from it if I don’t get to go somewhere, anywhere! every other month or so. But we’ve been gone over two weeks now, an amount of time that seems to be my personal limit. Two weeks in Europe this summer left me *gasp* missing America, and now two weeks in El Paso have left me yearning for Houston. It’s good. I needed to miss Houston. More than anticipation for home is setting in as the miles and minutes tick by. The close of 2003 seems to be already bringing hope and renewal for my psyche as well. This year was the hardest ever lived for our little family, it saw the extremes of emotion, certainly peaking with the birth of our daughter, Eleanor, and bottoming out with the tragic loss of Space Shuttle Columbia. John worked longer hours than he thought he ever would as long as our children were young, which resulted in my working longer hours parenting alone than we thought I ever would. I had to fight the resulting emotions as I pondered my definition in the world as an individual, would I become a housewife? Was I already? Where did my career go? I found myself screaming hysterically deep inside my head for weeks on end without ever making an audible sound. Eventually, appearing somewhat analogous to a wave resulting from a giant undersea earthquake, the scream emerged as a whimper, then a cry, and tears that lasted for all of a day and a night. That was in August, and by September we’d found ways to take real action as a family to improve our quality of living. While NASA would not require less of John, he found better ways to work at home or even from an Earthship in Taos, and firm boundaries for family time. We put Aidan in preschool and arranged one or two visits a week from the neighborhood goddess who shows up at the door like the Latina Mary Poppins, and lets me leave for three hours or so to return to a clean house filled with bathed and fed children who now speak Spanish. I began taking Pilates lessons. My body is really firming and shaping from the exercises, but my favorite part is laying on my back during the long stretches and staring at the blank ceiling as soothing music fills my head. Nobody needs me, nobody's touching me. An hour and a half floats by like a blink of the eye, and I emerge flexible again in body and soul. Perhaps one of the biggest changes I made was in my dealings with parents and siblings. Grandpa's death left my relationship with my bio-pop and his family entirely up to us. Instead of being negative, it's left me feeling freer to move within the boundaries of step-family dramas. I'm trying to lay groundwork for a healthy friendship that can endure my unfulfilled desire of being named in the will, or even differences of paradigm. Separately, the giant August raucous was one of the most painful experiences of my life, but it was also one of the most informative. I realized that all my life I’d blamed my bio-pop’s family for my disease of inadequacy. But in the aftermath of August, I realized that blame fell equally on all my family members! In a myriad of unique and individual ways, virtually everyone in my family has contributed—and in many cases, still actively contributes—to my every nagging feeling of not really belonging, of being the odd man out. Finally, that blame also falls on me for continuing to feel inadequate, especially around them. Realizing this helped me to let go of another nagging attribute of emotional baggage: guilty emotions stemming from never giving enough or helping enough, which in turn result in martyrdom. But who was I dying for? No one thought I was giving anything of myself, or they thought what I offered was stupid of ill-conceived. And here’s the big so what. Since no one really accepted me, and no one really appreciated anything I can offer, I could allow myself to say no to my family.

 Some of my neighbors are using services that advertise and rent their houses for them, and take a 30% cut. I'm neither organized nor desperate enough to do this, but I am putting it here on my blog. We live ten blocks from the downtown lightrail line that runs to the stadium, we're two blocks from the 50 bus line that also goes to the downtown lightrail line. Our home has two bedrooms and one bathroom, it sleeps seven inside with the blow-up mattress, otherwise five in beds. We also have my parents fifth wheel travel trailer next to the house that sleeps six and has its own bathroom and kitchen. Compared to what most people are asking around me, I'm basement level pricing, but then, I'm also incredulous that this will actually work. I'll start at asking $1500 for the house and $1000 for the trailer for the whole week, and if you want both, let's make a deal. Btw, I want security deposits for both house and trailer and no dogs inside the house. urlLink Email me here for inquiries .

 urlLink Guardian Unlimited | Special reports | The revolution should not be eulogised : "A weblog is something fundamentally new. Something no one can quite put their finger on, not yet. And those who try to define the phenomenon in terms of current institutions are completely missing the point. Consider the average weblog. Maintained by an unpaid enthusiast, this site will be updated perhaps a dozen times a day with links to interesting news stories and entries on other weblogs, accompanied by a few lines - or paragraphs - of commentary. A blogger interested in current events may include links to several accounts of one event, noting differences in tone or detail, another may post the occasional recipe or pictures from a recent trip. A blogger may have a thousand readers, but more likely a few hundred or a couple of dozen, some of whom will offer comments of their own, right on the site. The weblog is at once a scrapbook, news filter, chapbook, newsletter, and community. This is not passive news consumption. Neither is it broadcasting. The average blogger has time to surf the web, but no resources to report stories. Some bloggers will follow a news story to the end, some may lose interest after a few days. Commentary will range from the fully-formed to the random blurt and can freely mix the public and the personal. All this represents something new: participatory media. And it matters. Not because of its resemblance to familiar institutions, but because of its differences from them." I just have this to add: classic paradigm theory dictates that once the paradigm is named, you're no longer in it.

Standing alone is to face the full force of our own mortality. The crowd, on the other hand, is impersonal and immortal. The crowd is beyond the reach of death. Heidegger concludes that we hide from the unwelcome prospect of death by submerging our identity in the 'they'. The crowd anesthetises us from the thought of our own mortality. The price we pay for this evasion of the grim reaper is the loss of authentic existence. Submerging our identity in the 'they', we refuse the very knowledge that individuates us and makes existence authentically our own. Death is the one thing that another cannot do on our behalf. Death gives life its quality of mineness. It is no coincidence that Frank Sinatra's rendition of My Way continues to be one of the most popular requests at funerals.

The night before the election, a Zogby poll indicates that 42% of Americans describe themselves as "re-engaged in politics"; a full 65% say they have developed some sort of new relationship with another person as a result of the campaign." I'm struck how similar the aspects behind the spark of Dean's campaign are to the sparks behind the early Christian church. Those same sparks are being recreated by churches across the country by way of small groups movements, but I don't think it's catching on quite so strong as Dean's tactics. Individuals, meeting in private, personal locations with which they are familiar, believing in something more grand than themselves, finding their place in the big system for probably the first time... It's so exciting! We have been supporters of the Dean campaign since the earliest stages. Back in the summer of 2001 we saw Dean on a Sunday talkshow, and that week I told my parents, "you watch, this man is going to be the next president of the United States!" They, along with the rest of the country were like, Howard who? But now they've got Dean bumper stickers! A few weeks ago we saw Dean speak in Houston, we had a ball. It was a great event. I saw Clinton and Gore both speak in preparation to their candidacies, I was even at Clinton's first inauguration, and Dean left just as big an impression on me. Plus, it was my kids' first big political rally, I think it made a big impression on them, too. And yet, we have yet to attend any meet-ups. We came closest once in Taos, but never in Houston. Why? I think it's because the impression I get is that the Dean crowd is comprised mostly of Boomers post kids or yuppies pre kids and we are neither. If a meet-up was initiated that was openly play date-ish, we'd be there asap. Someone, please? They want the soccer parent vote, right?

Or it can be behind-the-scenes lobbying with the threat of a boycott in the background."

 Westwind is a curvy street that goes up and down hills. My son was enjoying watching the sun set over and over each hill. He'd say "there's the sun!" and then, "where'd the sun go?" I was trying my best to explain to my 2 3/4 year-old boy that we live on a ball called Earth (he'd say like the earthship, and get real excited) and the ball turns all the time. I'd make my hands into balls and move them around each other saying right now the ball is turning so that we can't see the sun anymore. My mind got hung up on the idea that to a 2-year-old, it makes so much more sense to think the sun is moving and the earth is steady. That's the world Copernicus encountered so many years ago when he introduced the heliocentric view. I felt such a sense of kinship with Copernicus as I pondered how people like to hold on to their view of the world, their sense of the way things are. Change hurts. Each year I seem to find a moral the universe (or God, via the universe, as I reluctantly claim my Christian heritage) brought to me. A few years ago the moral was to get over my self-centered self and put aside pride. Still working on that one. Year before last, it was LOVE, the purpose of life. This year has been change. That's how I found myself naming my blog for the parable Heraclitus told to explain the nature of change. His exact words were: Nothing endures but change. Therefore, one cannot step into the same river twice. Combining the morals of past years, I have to argue that nothing endures but love and change, but I digress. Heraclitus first found me in college. John and I had been dating for two years when we decided to take a class together. It was Ancient Philosophy taught by Professor Springer. I thought Springer was such a crock. I detested him. At the time, we were pretty devout charismatic Christians, and I was angry that, though the syllabus defined the scope of the class as entirely BC, Springer spent so much time dissing Jesus, or rather, Jesus' followers, the modern day Christians. It didn't help that taking a class together was probably the worst idea John and I ever had. We couldn't even agree on where to sit in the room (he always sat in the front, and I always sat in the back). These days, I find much more in common with Springer than not. I understand the disdain professors must have for students who come to them completely unexamined. They haven't questioned anything of their belief system, political, religious, or otherwise. These professors have to play every card in their deck to encourage self-examination. That, after all, is the point of the liberal arts education, right? Teach them critical thinking and they can do anything! But see, here is a perfect example of the river. I can hear Heraclitus' words an infinite number of times, but the ears that hear them will never be the same. The place I am in life, the mood I'm in, the day I've had, the book or website I just had, will always make the message just a little different. From all the search strings I get hits off of on the phrase, I can tell the universe sent the memo out to many others than just me. I guess the movie The Hours mentioned it, plus there is a 70s movie and book by the name. I walked into a coffee shop in Taos a few months back and saw the words painted in giant, dramatic letters above the cash register. I'm not jealous of my cosmic message, I'm glad I share circulation with so many great people. I wish everyone would tune in. So change.... I change, the kids change, George Bush and Howard Dean change. People die. Others are left to live. I found myself thinking about change last Sunday when I went to my mom's church. I thought about the famous time for everything scripture. A time for war and a time for peace. I can be ok with that, if I could just find the time for peace. Where is it? Doesn't anyone want to find it? And that's how we get back to Copernicus. No one believed in his heliocentric world view, but that didn't make it wrong. That's how it is with peace. People don't believe it's possible to live in a world where giant international problems are resolved with diplomacy, policy, and aide because it rocks their belief of how the world works. They don't want to question everything, and questioning any one thing so big just might make them. Copernicus knew just how dangerous challenging world views was, so he circulated his views anonymously. A hundred years later, Galileo came along and took the idea into the endzone, thanks to the telescope. Of course, maybe Galileo should have followed Copernicus' anonymity trend because he died excommunicated and alone. But he died for the cause of truth, the cause I know those of us who believe in peace are living and dying for today. It will take generations, but maybe we can change the way everyone else looks at things, we just can't lose faith that things will change.

 urlLink Dean for America: Common Sense "Over two hundred years ago, Thomas Paine wrote a pamphlet that would light the fire that forged our nation.

The president was too quick to declare Mission Accomplished on that aircraft carrier last spring; now he can say it's in the bag after all. But Saddam is only one of the administration's aeroplanes, and the only one so far brought back to the carrier deck. There is still an entire squadron of foreign, domestic and economic policies lost in the clouds. If they don't come home safely, the Republicans might need a bit of Saddam to divert attention during the presidential campaign next autumn. Then they can hang him. "

 urlLink The Supreme Court said Monday it will settle a fight over whether Vice President Dick Cheney must disclose details about secret contacts with energy industry officials as the Bush administration drafted its energy policy. The court agreed to hear an appeal from the administration, which is fighting a lawsuit brought by watchdog and environmental groups over the energy task force Cheney assembled. The panel met for several months in 2001 and issued a report that favored opening more public lands to oil and gas drilling and proposed a range of other steps supported by industry.High Court to Hear Cheney-Energy Dispute

 so I got flamed today, by a guy who found my website on a google search string (so I don't think he knows the code of conduct for blogs), but still, it stung. What a jerk. Mean people suck. I can tell you, as a liberal woman who lives in the south, as a person with very conservative in-laws (who still blame me for turning their boy to the dark side, I didn't, I swear!), and as a connoisseur of popular media, I'm more than used to confronting opposing opinions. Why did this guy get to me? Because I am surrounded by these types of individuals, I've increasingly quieted my distaste for their views, for the sake of preserving relationships. Not long ago I was at an age in which I thought silencing my views in front of anyone for any reason was selling out, but now I try to take time to ask questions in my head before engaging. I try to discern whether I have any chance of changing that person's mind, and whether sharing my views with that person is going to make them angry enough to firm their position against my own. More often that not, the answers to these questions lead me to keep my mouth closed and meditate on seaweed while they talk. But this guy entered my turf, and probably on the wrongest wrong day at that. I'm still amid a giant struggle with close friends who are personally offended and aghast that my husband and I continue to protest in a time of war. Add to that the holidays which bring me into close proximity with all the aforementioned relatives, and a good dose of fatigue and hormones, and presto! I can't hold in my feelings any more. Not only was the way in which this guy confronted me egregious, his position is abhorrent. What is it about conservatives that make them so sure of their position that if you don't hold it, you are morally inept? How is it that the party founded on a platform of small government wants to give the government enough power to legislate private, sexually-natured decisions, ranging from nude dancing to the morning after pill to, yes, *gasp* a woman's personal decision whether or not she can withstand a pregnancy? Why do the same people that promote decentralizing school systems and defunding social programs in the name of personal responsibility neglect to leave the most private and personal decision in womanhood up to personal responsibility? Here's the thing that gets me most. Why do people who say a pro-choice stance is killing babies and sinful support the death penalty and this country's current (and standard) foreign policy of shoot first, negotiate later. And why do these people consider themselves more patriotic or right in their position because they'd line up to be the shooter or shot when I would not. Because they are willing to thoughtlessly die at the hands of a corrupt government and I am not, these individuals consider their position more right! And they consider their position unquestionable! Earlier this evening, my husband had a conversation with his Catholic family in which they discussed the Priest's request that the congregation buy items to support some group. John said he'd have trouble with that, and all were clearly uncomfortable with the notion that John was questioning the Priest's decision to do or say something. I had a similar conversation with my own Catholic family members recently in which I respected their religion, but could not share in something that gave my kids the notion in any way that girls just aren't as special as boys. Same response. Priest's are clearly beyond questioning. In my head, this fosters the same tendency for corruption as not being able to question the government if we're at war. Our government was founded on the notion that questioning is always critical, it's like the central unit of power in a system of checks and balances. Not questioning takes out the checks, and leaves it all unbalanced. There you go. That summarizes it. These people are unbalanced. I think that's enough raging for now. I guess I'll get used to getting flamed. As my hits continue to go up, it's only more likely. Bring it on.

 urlLink NYT review of Lynch's story : "First is the low-intensity economic struggle of growing up working class in rural West Virginia. One of Bragg's sly suggestions is that Lynch's greatest fear, of ''being left behind'' -- which comes momentarily, horrifyingly true in the Iraq section, when her truck falls hours behind the main convoy -- was her life's default position. Soldiers like Lynch, he writes, were the sons and daughters of blue-collar workers who had jobs at plants ''that closed their doors before the next generation could build a life from them.'' This opportunity deficit, as the author sees it, is what put them into uniform... But Bragg, a former national correspondent for The New York Times, was composing under the fog of deadline. With an impossible two months for writing, he ended up with all of a military strategist's problems: routes get confused and abandoned, supply lines between idea and expression stretch thin, straggling images mumble up and down the column...In a book of 207 pages, Bragg includes more than 400 single-sentence paragraphs -- a well-established distress signal, recognized by book readers and term-paper graders alike. "The book's final struggle is Lynch's attempt to reclaim control of her own story, which ought to be as thrilling as the Iraqi stuff. She returned to the United States amid an avalanche of blessings that tops a Frank Capra movie: applause, civic gratitude, cascading gifts. Lynch had offers of college scholarships, Hawaiian vacations and new cars, and so much mail her town's postmaster started warehousing it in an empty jail cell. The emotional pressure -- the mixed shame and gratification -- must have been intense, yet she steadfastly corrected the record. (''The myth,'' Bragg writes, ''was made while she was sleeping.'' Upon awakening, she contradicted it.)"

 The baby fell asleep for her morning nap, so I should get very busy now. I should be packing, wrapping, finishing the laundry. But instead I'm sitting on the couch blogging and watching MTV. Can you say procrastinate? It started when I was watching the Sharon Osbourne Show while I nursed Ellie down. Jack's covering for his mum while she's in England with the injurred Ozzy. It's a brilliant idea, Jack is great. Unfortunately, instead of letting Jack really cover, interview guests, maybe even spoof mum's interview the hot guy in bed theme, they're just playing best of shots from past SOS shows. And since I'd made the official switch last month, the View just seems too yucky anymore to even watch for SOS commercials. And this is how I found myself watching Jessica Simpson on a Thursday morning! I was watching the video for her song With You, and first off, I thought it was frightfully funny that the video's producers tried to make viewers believe that Jessica's life with Nick now involves any cleaning at all because we've all seen their show, the house is always a pit and when it needs cleaning they bring someone in to do it. But still, suspending that minor disbelief, I was way distracted at the image of her rubbing her cleaning gloved hands into her hairall sexy like. We people who actually clean know the nasty places those gloves go. Just when my stomach is turned at the hair bit, she puts her hands in her mouth and bites the gloves to take them off! Ew! The next video was Kid Rock's Feel Like Makin' Love cover. I liked the intro where he has a bad dream that he's the entertainment for the 50th class reunion for the Class of 2004. He's all crickety and he kicks a chair over and yells in an old man scratchy voice, "Let's rock!" I was at my grandpa's 55th so I had a unique perspective on that one.

 I was driving down Memorial yesterday when this giant airplane flew so slow right over me, it was very frightening. To add to the sureal moment, a much smaller jet shadowed the giant plane just off the wing. Everyone pulled over to stare, I did as well. The plane circled back around and flew toward downtown, but it really didn't seem like it was flying high enough to fly over the buildings. It was pretty weird. I called John and asked if he'd seen anything on TV or online, I explained the giant plane and what looked like the astronaut training jet following it. Then, the planes flew over him way out at NASA! We couldn't believe that we'd both seen such a wild sight. John's co-op, who was with him during my frantic call, shot an email to one of his buddies on a tour working on shuttle. He was able to explain right away that they were testing a new inert fuel system. Anyway, turns out the giant plane was the space shuttle carrier plane, and they were trying to get some pretty pictures on such a nice day of the plane flying by the Houston skyline. A really nice idea, too bad it scared the bejesus out of everyone!

 The urlLink Howard Dean website urlLink makes it easy to send Al a message thanking him for urlLink today's endoresement . Here's what I wrote him: Dear Mr. Gore: My family supported you ardently throughout the 2000 election cycle. We mourned along with you the sad and wrong day that Bush was named President. That day was just two days after our first child was born, and we remain grateful that he was born under a rightfully democratic administration. Our daughter, on the other hand, was born during the Bush administration, and we're working along with the Howard Dean campaign--and thankfully, now, you--to avenge her. It may seem silly to consider the administration under which one was born, like an unlucky star in horoscopes. But we take humanity seriously in our family, we work to improve the conditions for all humans. And this man, called president but not, does his best to interfere with those efforts. We want to be sure that this election, the person elected is the person who holds the office. Thank you for supporting Howard Dean. The Feighery Family Houston, Texas

 A girl who works for the Sharon Osbourne Show, or maybe a friend of Sharon's, the connection was lost on me, started this line of Jewish-themed clothing that's so cute! I was thinking Hanuka is coming up, perfect gift ideas for Jewish friends (actually I only have one friend close enough to buy a Hanuka gift for), right? So I visited the website and not only can you not buy online, none of their retailers have websites! I know I exist primarily online, and that's not too normal yet in our country, but come on! A new store, a small start-up by a young person, and no way to buy online? So I emailed the girl to ask politely if there is anything she can do to rectify this. You should email her too. Her address is: sheinamadela@sbcglobal.net. Her stuff is great, witty, sexy. I just want to buy it! Btw, speaking of the Osbournes, have you heard about Ozzy? Poor guy. He has broken ribs, collar bone, and vertebrae. You've got to love the news, because they still say, "he's resting comfortably." I have no doubt he could think of many adjectives for his condition, all would need the famous MTV bleep, and none would be comfortable. If you ever saw the episode where Jack went to England with a friend and no parents, you know exactly what must have happened... I know I'm a horrible person for wondering this in light of their tragedy, but since Sharon flew off to London as soon as she heard, does this mean tomorrow with Moby is cancelled?



 last week I was ahead of the game, some shopping under my belt and plenty of time to finish. This week, I'm in a panic. I realized my shopping really has to be completed this week due to our travel plans, plus I have to do laundry and pack to prepare for our trips! I'm determined to do as much of my gift buying as I can from green companies, ie, companies with values like paying fair wages, and using ecologically safe production practices. Last year I did a lot of shopping through urlLink Working Assets' Shop for Change , and was very satisfied with the products. I'm starting there this year, and I've also found urlLink Co-op America's Green Pages Online . I'd love to hear from anyone else if they have other green buying ideas!

 urlLink RollingStone.com: News: Rockers Unite to Oust Bush : "Welcome to the increasingly partisan world of popular music -- where President George W. Bush is a marked man. Thirty major artists interviewed for this story cited many concerns: U.S. policy on Iraq, the Patriot Act, the Bush administration's assault on the environment, the economy and the media. But they all agreed that as the 2004 presidential election gets closer, it is time to mobilize. 'The America we believe in can't survive another four years of George Bush,' says Moby.

 Last night we arranged Yolanda to watch the kids, and went out for a few hours. We were going to try this new restaurant in the Heights, Onion something, but then we forgot we still wanted to vote (John mainly, I was in a they're both jerks so why bother mood). And so I found myself voting on my datenight. How romantic. Actually, I love our voting precinct. I've blogged that before. We still vote at the Forth Ward community center in the middle of a large, predominantly African American assisted housing complex off Allen Parkway. Without fail, each time we've ever been the people working the booths were polite and enjoyable. When I have the kids, and I always have before so they asked where my kids were this time and I had to explain we were voting on our date, someone always comes up to hold them and entertain them. When I was pregnant, they'd run for a chair so I didn't have to stand long. I always leave feeling like I've encountered the nicest people in the world. Last night when we left they all hollered after us to have a great time on our date. After we voted we ended up at Mo Mong since we were already close to Montrose. Technically, we shouldn't have gone because we're trying to break out of our 10 Restaurant Rut, and Mo Mong tops that list, but then we rationalized that one should support the staples of a rapidly changing culture like Montrose. It's great to be recognized at the door and talked to familiarly. The owner asked about our kids and why we haven't been in a while. This is a big reason we can't leave the rut, we love this part. Still, since we'd betrayed our desires to break from normal in the venue, we imposed a mandate on ourselves to order things we'd never had or even tried. It was so much fun! We had a fantastic appetizer that I can only describe as the Vietnamese answer to the frittata. It was egg whites and tofu filled with sprouts, snap peas, onions, mushrooms, and other vegetables. John ordered a Sake Martini that he's still talking about! I can't say I liked it, but it was the most aesthetically erotic and beautiful drink I've ever seen. The cucumber and ginger floated under the liquor like a submerged Georgia O'Keefe flower. I ordered a rather plain, but still delicious blue (safire) martini with a twist instead of an olive. For our meal, I had Pho Ga soup, a delicious chicken and tofu broth with sprouts, rice noodles, and jalapenos. John ordered Seafood Pad Thai with shrimp, calamari, and fish in rice noodles. We were so satisfied. Next to us a heterosexual couple argued on the cellphone with someone who wasn't coming to some mystery event they were attending after dinner, which incensed them because that person was their only way in. A homosexual couple of men sat on the other side and discussed whether one should be supporting his son in college or not. I'm such a voyeur. After dinner we still had 45 minutes of sitter scheduled so we decided to go for tea. I wanted to show John the Craftsmen Brothers Bakery I've been frequenting on my Yolanda Tuesdays, but they were closed so instead we went for bubble tea on Milam. I had a fun conversation with a couple and their 11 month old, and we hurried home since it made me miss my kids so bad. The woman in that couple said she hated being apart from her son, even when she was in bed and I told her I never wanted to sleep without my kids either so I kept them with me. She said she'd been told that was bad and would cause attachment anxiety problems and I told her that was absolutely wrong and how my son who always had slept with me before his sister sleeps perfectly on his own now. I recommended she read Elise Eliot's book which highlights the physiologic benefits of cosleeping. I hope it helped. We went home and Yolanda left and we popped in the movie I'd gotten a few days before. Keeping with my sexy energy theme of the week, I'd specifically sought out the sexiest looking foreign film I could find. I picked an Italian movie called Malena, which was summed to be a tale of an irresistibly beautiful woman who gets into trouble for her beauty in a small villa during WWII. All the men want her and all the women hate her for her beauty. The film was subtitled and the ratings warned of nudity. I was pretty disappointed regarding the sexual content in the film, nothing much more than a young boy's fantasies was ever shown and seeing a beautiful woman prance around a young kid just doesn't do it for me. But the plot was nice and the writing was witty so I'll still recommend the movie as long as your really after plot and witty writing. This morning the kids were just crazy. Still, we had a fun time going to Criossant Brioche for breakfast and spent the rest of the day watching football and hanging Christmas lights. I loved watching the New England/Miami game for no other reason than the piles and piles of snow. Snow games just attract me like even the best match-up couldn't. The fans sat amid piles of snow left by the two-foot storm and threw snowballs every big call. The whole stadium would get white all at once!

 I have this fantasy that all the evil, giant corporations share a database of customers that won’t lay down and take their shit. These customers learned by the late nineties to ask for a supervisor when customer support workers weren’t able or willing to help, and now that even supervisors are no help, these customers are getting wiser about how to capture power in a system that necessarily keeps the little man down. I like to think I’m on that list, but I don’t really know. I know my parents are on this list because over the course of the past two years they were involved in a dispute with their mortgage company over a missing payment, which they had canceled checks for. After their house was repossessed, sold at auction, they sued the mortgage company and won a settlement that included getting their house back. This was six months ago. The mortgage company has yet to enact the terms of the settlement and they’ll probably be going back to court soon because they’ve found lawsuits as their only tool in the struggle to have a working relationship with a corporation so big they could give a flying shit whether or not you’re a satisfied customer. I also know this woman, Jamie, is on my magical list. When MCI mistakenly charged her $900+ in bogus phone charges, and couldn’t resolve the matter over ten months, she involved the host of urlLink This American Life in her cause, and together they found resolution within twenty-four hours. She was even given the personal email address of the VP of MCI’s customer support division: jim.Meyers@mci.com just in case you need it. She’s my hero. Her story was on This American Life today and will be available to hear online in a day or two. The other story they covered today about the nation of Nauroo is also facinating.

 MECA Press Release: Greetings! On Friday, December 12, 2003, MECA will celebrate the Feast Day of Our Lady of Guadalupe with Fiesta Guadalupana. The Virgin de Guadalupe is fondly thought of as the Roman Catholic patroness of the Americas. The historical basis of this holiday is the belief that in 1531, on Tepeyac hill, the Virgin Mary appeared to Juan Diego, a poor Native Mexican. Her shrine in México City is the second most-visited Catholic Church in the world with approximately 10 million visitors a year. Pope John Paul II visited Our Lady of Guadalupe three times, most recently in 2002, for the canonization of Juan Diego, who convinced the bishop to build a Marian shrine on Tepeyac. MECA will celebrate this Latin American holiday with song and dance. Mariachi MECA will lead participants in a procession around the Old Sixth Ward while singing Las Mañanitas. The procession will conclude at MECA's statue of the Virgin de Guadalupe, where MECA's Ballet Folklórico students will perform a traditional Aztec dance, Sun God's Adoration. Mariachi MECA will perform liturgical music, as a student representing Juan Diego lays flowers before the statue of Our Lady. Hot chocolate, pan dulce, and other refreshments will be available for purchase.

 My experience urlLink Tuesday of having the worst day ever expanded to feeling like the worst week ever, after urlLink Wednesday Aidan had a bad accident at school , for which I kept him home on Thursday (not easy to do) and by Friday culminated with getting pulled over _again_ (who gets pulled over for expired stickers twice in three days after driving with expired stickers for a year!?!), and then the usual anger at John when he returns for a trip on Friday night. I don't know why, but this last one was especially bad. I have to go into this tough place in my head where I don't need him in order to survive his absence, and it's hard to turn that off when he walks back in the door. But also, I didn't know until I saw him how angry I was that he didn't come home Wednesday after the accident. I'm grateful he's here at all, he's supposed to be in California until next Thursday, after all. Yet another contributing factor to my bad week was the enormously bad energy the Super Bowl seems to have brought to Houston. Everyone is angry! I have a few theories: 1) this is bringing in a lot of people from the suburbs, who might not necessarily always be angry, but who are certainly fearful of the big city and therefore angry out of their defensiveness, 2) the events surrounding the Super Bowl are a little Sodom and Gomorrah (not b/c of any same sex stuff--I've never felt that was the big issue there, but rather the overindulged, self-involved, feel good right now vibe), 3) football fans just aren't as joyous, happy for a good game as the Final Four basketball crowd, which is my only other experience with giant sporting events. Maybe football fans are more blood thirsty, like the gladiator fans that just want to see blood spilled. This last reason pains me, because I love, love, love NFL football. I'm not even sure how true this could be b/c not that many people who are here are football fans. Most are just here for the prestige of attending a Super Bowl and could give a shit about the game. Regardless of the reason, this week Houston has bad JooJoo. People honk and cut your off angrily on the road, they yell and push in crowds, my dad said the airport was a mess with rude and rowdy Super Bowl visitors last night. I never thought I'd say this, but I'll be glad when Game Day has passed. At least they gave us lightrail! Anyway, just as on Tuesday, I realized urlLink Gwen's day had trumped mine in bad-ness, my bad week wasn't the worst one either. Even considering the considerable trauma our family experienced with Aidan's mouth injury, our week wasn't that bad compared to the week urlLink Gina of Mom-Blog or her father experienced . This quaint little blogging community on the internet is wonderful for putting perspective in life. Today, I'll be sure to raise a glass for the Gina B family.

 urlLink HealthWorld Online - Herbal Medicine - Herbal Therapy & the Cardiovascular System : "Herbs still maintain a central position in orthodox medicines treatment of various heart problems. Plants that contain cardiac glycosides are used throughout the world for the treatment of heart failure and some arrhythmia's. In such conditions these herbs increase the strength of heart beat, and normalize the rate of beat. Their real value lies in the increased efficiency not necessitating an increase of oxygen supply to the heart muscle. In heart problems there is often a deficiency in blood supply because of blockage in the coronary arteries. It is not just Foxglove that has such valuable actions. Lily of the Valley shares its therapeutic value but has fewer side effects and lower toxicity. However, herbal remedies nurture the heart in deeper ways as well. Consider the cordial, a warming drink and a word for heart-felt friendliness. The original cordial was a medieval drink based on Borage that warmed the heart and gave the person HEART. "

 urlLink Daily Kos :: Political Analysis and other daily rants on the state of the nation. : "But then it struck me: Sure, the core Dean supporters who opposed the war all along have long backed him, and most likely remain with him. But many of the non-core Dean supporters within the Democratic Party evolved on the Iraq issue to the point where, although they may side with Dean now, they did not start where Dean started. In fact, they probably started where Kerry and Edwards started: supporting the invasion, albeit with a sense of unease. Because their transformation more closely mirrors Kerry than Dean, voting for Kerry is more affirming. (Sample internal monologue: 'Hey, if John Kerry was fooled and feels betrayed, well, I can understand that because I feel the same way.') On the other hand, a vote for Dean is a reminder that you believed in the president and his plan all along. A lot of pundits say Dean's collapse can be attributed to buyer's remorse among Democrats who initially 'dated' Dean, but have since 'married' Kerry. Correct concept, wrong application: Dean is folding because of buyer's remorse, all right - but because he reminds Democrats of what Bush sold them a year ago, not what Dean is trying to sell them now.

 my dad's coming to save me from my sleepless self. [insert awwwe here] Good ole' Dad. Just knowing someone's coming makes me tired. I could lay down on the couch right now and fall asleep. But I can't. I have to go to the airport and pick him up.

 I came home this evening with a giant pit of doom in my stomach. I felt like I'd had the worst day ever. Most of my worst day-ness stems from not sleeping more than an hour or two last night. I'm not a person who can function without sleep. In fact, I actually need more sleep than most people. I wasn't always this way, so I blame it on four years of physically growing babies, either inside or out. Maybe after Ellie's weaned my sleep dependency will end. Anyway, the reason I didn't sleep is that my husband is in San Francisco for the stupidest training workshop ever. What kind of leadership training rips people away from their families for two weeks? Don't good leaders need solid families? Before I got married I lived alone. In fact, for one summer when I interned with DOI-Bureau of Reclamation at a University of Kansas office, I lived in a creepy little room high up in a church bell tower. One side of the room was the piping for the ancient and gigantic pipe organ, and the other was the church's stone facade with a stain glass window that looked over downtown Lawrence, Kansas. In exchange for locking up at night and shooing away lingering homeless, I received lodging in the small room. Aside from the empty church at night, the creepy part was that the hallway my stairs emptied into on the ground floor was also the politely out of sight nook to keep the caskets before funerals. And still, I slept every night. Since getting married, or maybe more accurately, since having kids (I don't know which was the bigger influencer), I don't sleep when I'm alone. Part of me is afraid of not hearing an alarming noise if I fall asleep. Part of me is just unsettled without my usual companion. John sleeps like a rock all the time, and I sleep very light so I don't think we're much less safe when he's gone. It's completely mental. So I'm a ninny and I can't sleep when I'm alone. That's not the only thing wrong, though. This afternoon I got a ticket for having expired inspection and registration. I had the new registration sticker... at home. And I didn't worry too much about the inspection because 1) I know our car is environmentally sound, and 2) when I've gotten one of the expired inspection tickets in the past remedy was as simple as presenting the new inspection and paying the court fees. Not this time. $130 flat fine for having a too long expired sticker (60+ days). Then, I got an email from a guy we bought ebay tickets from, saying our check bounced, he'll be pressing charges under the Texas Hot Check Statute, and John's never flying SWA again. This is really confusing because we had enough money in the account, in fact, before he mailed the tickets his wife called our credit union to verify that. Much later, on the phone, the guy was a pussy cat. I wish he hadn't thought he needed to be so mean and abrasive up front because he really contributed to my awful day. For several hours, I thought I had a giant credit-cleaning, NTSB rectifying debacle on my hands. To top everything off, the kids are just bears. Especially Aidan, but both of them really turn a little psycho when their dad's away. They miss him horribly. It's the price you pay for successfully attachment parenting. When I came home, I opened my website out of habit, and clicked on the link in my blogroll some beyond thought part of my brain figured to be most consoling: Gwen's Petty, Judgmental, Evil Blog. Turns out she had urlLink an even worse day than I did last Sunday, the very day that I and my family enjoyed our best day in many. Our last together before John left, and our first all healthy since this flu ravaged us, we took the lightrail to Rice, and walked through Rice to the village for breakfast at Croissant Brioche. Poor Gwen was having a rotten day all that while. I'm so sorry.

 urlLink Here's a huge NYT article on copyright . Separately, we just heard a presentation on patents last week. These are only the two most recent magma bubbles, if you will indulge my geologic metaphor, I've seen surface, threatening to expose unbelievable platonic instability regarding ownership.

 Here in Houston, I don't have a chance in hell of making an impact on the selection of the Democratic Presidential candidate with my vote. The primary here is hopelessly (purposefully?) late, the dye will be cast long beforehand. So what am I left to do? Join the disillusioned masses? Never! I blog! Since everyone is arguing about which candidate will make the best showing against Bush, I'd like to go the inverse route and say which candidates will do worst. Whatever you do, please please please don't vote for Clark. This is a man that campaigns on the promise that he'll draw former Reagan supporters to vote for him! This belies the fact that Clark should go back to the party he so recently left, the Republicans. But that's not even the worst of him. The biggest criticism I've had all along of the Bush administration is the way they stacked the deck from day one toward the military. Virtually every cabinet position was filled by a military officer, even ones that our government designed to reflect the non-military view (if diplomacy can be seen, as they've shown, as the anti-military response), such as Colin Powell's position as Secretary of State. As a result, the first week Bush was in office, he pulled the diplomatic officials out of Israel/Palestine, only later to reinsert them when tensions clearly escalated in their absence. Also consequently, when diplomacy-based solutions effectively contained Sadam Hussein, the administration didn't recognize such an irresolute solution and proceeded to drop bombs. On every Sunday morning TV show, among every pundit interview throughout all this time, sits retired military officials masquerading as experts lending their deciphering mind. But this leaves the American culture with the mistaken idea that the military option is the only option on the table. I'm not a blind fan for the Clinton years. He had his faults. But I will say that Clinton's life experience, primarily that of a Rhodes scholar, and a man who had lived abroad, among people different than him, contributed invaluably to the largely-diplomatically attained peace our country enjoyed during his two terms. Remember that our government was based on Checks and Balances. The tension between the opposing poles is designed to lend a rational response to any variety of situations. Clark is fresh out of the military, and as such, will only sustain this disastrous and reckless continuum of military campaigns.

 urlLink So How Cold Is It in New York City? Just Ask This Native Icelander : "It also helps to maintain some perspective. It may not have been so cold in Iceland, but it was 18 below zero yesterday in Deadhorse, on Alaska's northern coast, and on Saturday night it got down to 40 below. The sun rose just above the horizon around 11 a.m. Alaska time and set around noon. That kind of cold can keep people indoors and drive them into depression, said Monica Millard, who works at the reception desk at the Prudhoe Bay Hotel in Deadhorse. But Ms. Millard, reached by phone yesterday, had a few words of advice for New Yorkers, in the event that the cold snap lasted any longer. 'Don't let yourself become a recluse,' she said.

 urlLink Coming Soon to a Screen Near You: New Mexico : "The force behind New Mexico's film boom was the creation of an $85 million fund that invests directly in film projects through no-interest loans. The money comes from New Mexico's $3.5 billion Severance Tax Permanent Fund, financed by royalties from natural gas, oil, coal and timber extraction. The program, drafted by Peter J. Dekom, a prominent entertainment industry lawyer in Los Angeles, allows the state to lend as much as $7.5 million to help produce films. It also grants a 15 percent tax rebate on all local production costs, provided the film is made largely in New Mexico. 'Our main objective is to become a supportive satellite of Hollywood,' Gov. Bill Richardson said in an interview. 'We don't want to be greedy with this, but for a state with low per capita income, it's a way for us to attract a clean, environmentally friendly industry that leaves a positive impact.'" My [bio] dad actually did the survey for Val Kilmer's land not long ago. He himself actually lives nearby, as well. He didn't meet Val or anything, but I do know that it's in an absolutely--prestinely--safe area.

 I'm so excited, I can't believe everything seems to be going so well for these two rovers! Let's just hope every little instrument in Opportunity can survive those unexpected extra Gs!

 we're sitting at home watching NASA Select, hoping for a safe landing for Mars' newest visitor, the rover named Opportunity. Moments ago, the little robot separated from its mama ship, on which it had traveled from Earth to Martian orbit. After separation, the two decend together toward the surface of Mars. But because the mothership isn't protected by a heatshield, much less equipped with airbags for landing, it will soon meet a firey end while the little rover Opportunity will continue on to what we all hope is a bright future of exploration and discovery. Isn't that the perfect analogy for the very nature of parenting? This mama ship traveled a hundred million miles just to give its baby that final nudge into history. Aside from the discriptor "cruise stage," the mama ship didn't even have a name. And that's how progress works. If we do nothing else to help our spieces, we're working to help our babies help the species. God speed, Opportunity!

 I've been thinking for a while how great it would be if a cast member from either Real World or Road Rules would blog during their interment. Today, I found urlLink this blog that, while not kept by cast members, is kept by a fanatic with good loop proximity. Apparently, the next RW will be in Philadelphia! Wow, go Phili. Can you imagine if they filmed in Houston? This season, in the run up to the big San Diego premier, I watched some of the Real Worlds of the past marathon. It was so nostalgic! I was seventeen when I first became a RW fan, probably b/c that's the first year my family had satellite TV! I still remember my mom and I spent a whole weekend in our pajamas watching a San Francisco marathon. My dad must have been away working b/c that's not the kind of thing he would enjoy. We loved Puck, even before it was cool to love Puck and we were so distraught at the news of Pedro's death. Watching the evolution of the program through the years really made me feel that, while I grew up in so many ways watching each season, the show itself did not. They used to cast people with jobs and lives, they didn't hand them a cush job upon arrival, and that encouraged the casting of people who knew what consequences were. Even Puck, fucking puck, had a job that was great for his personality. Remember? He was a bicycle delivery boy who went all hardcore all over the hills of San Fran. The show could focus more on each castmember's desires for accomplishments, and therefore, on the pitfalls and triumphs they faced regarding those desires. These days, it's so sorority/fraternity house feeling. I know MTV isn't in the business of parenting teenagers, but they are a major influence on our country's youth culture. Sometimes, it seems like the producers care about that when they air programs like the special on AIDS or the Tony Blaire townhall. And then they go drop the ball with all their double d boobies, size 4 pant-wearing, giggling girls who never had a dream for accomplishment in their lives. The cast members they used to bring on were better role models by far. Oh well, at least they have the Osbournes...

 Stricken by the flu (I don't want to say that like it's a bad thing because when you're the work at home mom, a sick day is the only way to get a work at home dad!), I've gotten even more cozy with my TiVo this week. It wasn't a bad week for that, either! So far my favorite of the whole week was the series premier of urlLink Till Death Do Us Part , or Newleyweds: Dave and Carmen. I never got into urlLink Nick and Jessica , she always made me too angry with her stupid blonde girl routine and he's pretty whiney. You don't realize how whiney he is until you see the promos for next week's show in which he turns thirty. At least she can blame her bad attitude on youth. Plus, they've got the whole sloppy, lazy, messy thing going in despite the fact that they're very rich, have maids, have parents always bailing them out... just yucky. Anyway, Dave and Carmen are like the goth version, and they're pulling it off perfectly. I find myself much more sympathetic to this show, plus they're funnier. I'm much more likely to listen to Janes Addiction or Camp Freddie than anything Nick or Jessica have to sing. I know the Nick and Jessica crowd was urlLink primarily sorority girls , past and present, but here's a marriage model for the rest of our country's disaffected youth culture! The TiVo provided my own private analogy for how I felt the State of the Union address went when half way through I heard a little bing and got a message that the finale for urlLink Real World vs. Road Rules was about to start. Oh thank God! As long as I have to spend the evening watching spoiled [mostly] white kids who've never had a reflective thought in their lives, I'd much rather do it on MTV. And, speaking of the finale, am I the only one who thinks Coral somehow managed to fake anaphilactic shock? Stupid MTV, though, frustrates me so much when they cast women with unbelievably little musculature in their bodies and/or breasts so big they literally can't run, and then put them in a physical contest. It really isn't doing much to improve the image of young women. But seriously, about the SOTUA, I just have a few complaints. First, I understand that Bush is a man who made the career transition from professional sports to politics, so maybe they're linked in his head. But for the rest of us, naming performance altering drugs alongside international security and the national debt seems a little off. Second, what happened to last year's failed promises? And I don't mean just the whole WMD thing, b/c of course that's been tabled, but what of the African AIDS relief, education initiatives, or corporate reform, just to name a few? Thirdly, I noticed--and I don't think anyone else has called attention to it--the state of Bush's presidency can be monitored by the color of his tie. In his first SOTUA, his tie was a light lavender. Then, last year it was deep blue. This year, it was bright red. Danger! Danger Mr. Bush! Dems on the horizon! Notably, Dick Cheney's tie has been on high alert since the beginning, transitioning slightly from an aggie-red to this year's bright red. Naturally, the good moments included the accidental clapping during the tax bit and the two instances of boo-ing. If Howard Dean does nothing else with his political career, at least he made it popular to diss the Bush administration again. Btw, Jon Stuart had the best wrap-up of the SOTUA last night on his Daily Show. Much of it urlLink can be seen on the website here . But I don't think that includes the John McCain interview. It replays today on Comedy Central at 6 central and I really insist you watch! Just finishing up here with my TV pics of the week, Scrubs was kind of good, which is nice b/c they've sucked this season. urlLink Sharon Osbourne was hilarious today, seriously contending with urlLink Ellen (who has the better website, funnier anyway) for my morning TV routine. Why must they collide! Bravo is like your special soft blanket when you're sick, it's always there to offer something fun to wrap up in. Thank God for Queer Eye and West Wing re-runs. Last night I watched most of the Dems debate to see if Dean has anything left in him for the fight: he does. But Edwards is picking up speed. It's so obvious that Edwards is the networks' chosen one. Did you know Kerry was in Skull and Bones? He's so evil! Lastly, I watched the Widow of St. Pierre yesterday on HBO Signature. Good subtitled foreign film for daytime TV, if a little sad since it's a true story. Very powerful message re society, criminals, and rehabilitation. Left me guessing for the ending. I love Juliette Binoche. She's so beautiful!

 Looking at this long sap of a post I wrote earlier just makes me ill. Does drinking always bring about so much self doubt in me? Or is it just drinking during my kids' birthday week, which is a giant time of personal reflection? John and I had a lovely afternoon since it was a holiday weekend, and both the kids actually took long naps at the same time! We indulged in two rounds of martinis and then began talking about all sorts of deep subject like where our lives are headed and how sometimes I just want to adopt ten kids and John says as much as we hate vans, mini and otherwise, we couldn't handle it! It was a nice afternoon, I'm sad that it didn't look like that in my post. I'm really happy with the way things have gone in my life so far, I have to believe I'll be happy with the way the next bit goes too. It's just that my line of sight for the next bit isn't so clear right now and, as a result, I feel like breaking through the curve when I should be applying the gas peddle. I thought about deleting the post, and I stopped myself because blogging is live, and that means blogging is life. We all have these lows of doubt, right? I should be honest enough to present all of me on these websites if I intend to represent myslef in such an electronic way. I don't want to edit myself into some better, more presentable representation of me. This is who I am. Read me.

 If you have children, you are very aware of the ways in which they develop. Inevitably, a child's brain will go either physical or verbal development first, excel in that area, then develop the other. Girls are famously typical for going verbal first, and boys for physical, but anomalies abound. Every now and then, you'll find a child that is especially precocious in neither, and instead develops both in good time simultaneously. This track, while difficult for the parents who sit in playgroup watching their child's peers excel in one category around them, is advantageous in that, in the long run, this child will probably be a renaissance man/woman, both physically and mentally adept. My son was clearly the physical achiever. He stood before he was ten months old, and took his first steps right at ten months. He was walking well, turning, even handling a sloped surface before his first birthday. As everyone who reads this now knows, his truest accomplishment was always his climbing skills. He was never sub-par regarding verbal skills, but he didn't set the curve either. My daughter, on the other hand, must be the renaissance girl. I say this because she walked earlier than the bell curve, but not early enough to be physically advanced. And verbally she's always been amazing. Her confidence in her own communication has always been an asset, even if she wasn't exactly audible. Now, two days shy if one year old, I know what she means with many of her verbal gestures/sounds combos, but no one else does! Ironically, I've come to think we adult women have similar dichotomous developments. I, for example, have been particularly precocious in the family arena. Here I am at 26, with two perfect children, a dreamy husband who fulfills me in *every* way, and a nice little house in the middle of a giant urban city in which to care for them all. And yet, my education is pretty standard, my career is a little hanging in the balance, and professional directions are a little fuzzy. Can you tell yet that I just finished watching this week's newest Sex and the City? Carie is 38, and very much like my other friends in their late thirties, beginning to wonder whether she really does want children since she hasn't made it happen yet. Clearly, she developed professional before family. Just as my son has eventually become a master in verbal skills, I feel like my early performance in the familial realm doesn't preclude my professional development. Right? Surely I can still save the world, win the Nobel peace prize or the Nobel prize for literature, and have a few dozen grandchildren to hold in my lap as I finish the good race well? Oh God. I'm 26. This is really the last year to do something great with my career and still be precocious. MLK was 26 when he led his first protest march. Where's my calling? Earlier this week, my mother was preparing her MLK sermon and called me to ask what I thought about Jesus and MLK. I said they both died for their cause by their mid-thirties, so clearly I'm behind schedule. And of course I felt guilty for this as soon as I said it, because I was talking to my mother who has found her second career mid-life and will begin graduate school next year as she nears that 50 benchmark. Am I a fool for taking this maternal course of life? I wanted kids and biology alongside my husband's career choice left me no better option than having my kids early. And yet, that's why he went to NYC this week and I stayed home with the kiddies. I'm so happy to have my children. They're more than amazing. I know they will always be the best thing I've ever done to help this little planet survive. On certain days I think I should have 12 kids just because these two have been so fantastic. I'm only 26. There's plenty of life still out there to live. You know who's to blame for all this self-doubt? The stupid US Gov. who doesn't give women a two-year maternity leave like every other decent progressive country out there. With a two-year maternity leave, you're not a slacker for spending a year or two enjoying the wee ones after each birth, you haven't made a major deviation from your career path. On the contrary, you have a lovely little place waiting for you when you return, and your children begin public school all at about the same time that you yourself feel like getting a little distance from your progeny. Fuck doubt. I'm living as if I were in my own progressive country. I get two years after each kid to just stay home and hug them as much as possible. MLK had a wife who herself had this wonderful chance to hug and love on the kids all day.

 is that humor? patriotism? what the hell! Before the Patriots/Colts game even began, it was a wash because as Leanne Rhymes sang the national anthem in the pre-game and wailed out rockets' red glare, fake rockets launched off the field, and as she sang bombs bursting in air, fake bombs blew up on field. Everyone cheered at this drama, but how sick is that! People we share this planet with are screaming right now, not in joy of anticipating the start of a football game, but in terror, real terror for fear of real rockets and bombs exploding around them. In some cases, those bombs are eliciting the screams of American soldiers, and you'd think at least out of respect or acknowledgement of those actual screams, someone would have called this idea classless before it made it to the field. Just yesterday, such a bomb was laid in a road and claimed the lives that brought the death toll of American soldiers throughout Gulf II urlLink notably over 500 (notable, because the Iraqi urlLink civilian death toll urlLink will soon reach 10,000 ). On the news, the fallen soldiers' friends and colleagues called this act cowardly. But in far more cases, those bombs were carelessly laid and dropped by us! that's right, the Americans use cowardly war tactics, too.

 After three days, John is returning from New York tonight. I'm so happy I've made it. I'm sure I'm doing single mothers a huge injustice here, but I have to spend a few minutes complaining about how difficult it is to keep two kids all by myself. As much as John's worked throughout this past year, at least even if he got home after the kids were put to bed, he recharged me. Today I'm so grumpy! I think it's simply from not getting that recharge. That, and knowing that right now John's at the UN in New York. My UN! (read that like Joe's my Europe in Little Women) Everything is making me unduly angry. I'm ready for some sunshine. The ground is so wet that when I walk in my hard each step makes a puddle. Relief won't be here anytime soon. Severe weather is expected this afternoon, and when the ground is already so saturated, that tends to mean I10 will be under ten feet of water by sundown. I don't care what the weather brings, so long as it doesn't prevent John from landing safely tonight! If only there were football today to ease my many sorrows! Maybe I'll pop in a Japaname and drink some *special* coffee...

 Want to know who inspired the characters of A Mighty Wind? If you were as dissappointed about the show as I was, you probably don't. Believe it or not, this article's background info is more entertaining than the whole mock-umentary. Enjoy a snippet: urlLink Guardian Unlimited Film | Features | Near as folk : "In the film: The New Main Street Singers, part close-harmony group, part new-age cult. Their clean-cut appearance belies the often sketchy pasts of its members. In real life: The New Christy Minstrels, essentially the Spinal Tap of folk. Formed by songwriter Randy Sparks in 1961 in an attempt to catch the rising folk tide, the group changed its 10-strong personnel seemingly every time it played. Stupefyingly unprincipled, Sparks meticulously rifled folk's heritage, appropriating any melody which fell outside 50-year copyright, and any commercial opportunity that came his way. Whereas Joan Baez refused $50,000 to advertise Coca Cola, the NCM unveiled the Ford Mustang on national television and played at an inauguration party for Lyndon Johnson. Stranger than fiction: Previous members of the group have included the Byrds' Gene Clark, Kenny Rogers and a Japanese woman who performed in the traditional costume of her country."

Yes = hmmm.. you baathist pro saddamist bastard .. arrest him No = OK! Here we have another evidence how much the Iraqi people want us to stay I remember the days before the war when people from the national-but-corrupted-and-arrogant-government were using the same smart propaganda to justify their loyalty to saddam, “a civil war will start, no one can control this country, even if he isn’t the best person in the world at least he is keeping the situation stable” The same excuse was given today, by Iraqis demonstrating at Basra. Americans were supposed to hand over [some] authorities for Iraqis next June, and discussions were about how and where and other details, this was announced after months of playing the [try & screw-up] game. The political hand-over was supposed to happen in the middle of this year, but the thing/government was not going to be elected, it was supposed to be [s-elected], preparing for the general elections in two years.

 John's meeting with a fantastic team of professionals from around the world who are united by little else than their careers in the space industry and their desires to improve the world. They've gotten an audience with a representative from the UN and nobody has a clue where this is all going. I was supposed to be in this meeting too. I wanted to be there more than I even knew. But the universe had other plans in my cards, and I'm working hard to be ok with that. I think one of the big reasons my absence wounded me was the meeting's location: Columbia University's Earth Institute. The very institution I thought I'd be attending this year for my graduate degree(s). Am I ever going to get a doctorate!?! Maybe I should apply again to Rice. My previous application was five years ago, and to be honest, it wasn't very good. It was my first graduate application, and I've learned so much since then. I can do better. What if they deny me again? It's such a personal rejection. OK, big digression. Or regression. Anyway, my program was killed by the changing admin. at Columbia, and super ironically, the outgoing administration included the Dean of Columbia's law school, who is now going to be the next president of Rice U. Is that some sort of cosmic directions of energies I should be jumping in? Why am I so superstitious! John's freezing his ass off in NYC, which makes my not being there a little easier to handle. At least by missing the opportunity to be brilliantly saving the world, I'm safe in balmy Houston where our coming weekend cold front means temps will drop to the 50s! This meeting feels really good, I'm so glad it's finally happening. There was some last minute queasiness by some of the participants on behalf of the supercold, but everyone held fast. I think they knew, as I had felt, that any postponement would certainly be the collaboration's death at this early and fragile junction. I'm just so jealous that I'm not there. Before I sent John off on his merry way, I bought him a new outfit to present in. This was my small way to influence his message from afar. At least if I can't be there to share in the message imparting, I can still be sure he looks fantastic imparting his message.

 Both urlLink the Writers' Almanac and urlLink the Guardian recognized the passing of author James Joyce on this day in 1941. The former reminded us of the cyclic nature in which Joyce profoundly wronte Fennegan's Wake. "The first sentence of the book is the end of the unfinished last sentence. The book ends, "A way a lone a last a loved along the," and begins, "riverrun, past Eve and Adam's from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodious vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs."" The Guardian reprinted the obit they ran the next day back in 1941: urlLink Guardian Unlimited | Special reports | James Joyce : "Tuesday January 14, 1941 The Guardian With the death of James Joyce there passes the strangest and most original figure which Ireland gave to Europe in this generation. The ban imposed for years upon his 'Ulysses' gave a notoriety to his name without disclosing his true stature and strength. That he was a genuine artist, sincere, integrated, and profound is clear from the simplicity of his early short stories 'Dubliners' and from the well-defined autobiographical narrative of 'Portrait of the Artist.' In 'Ulysses' he attempted the difficult task of presenting a complete picture of the life of the individual in our time, both conscious and subconscious, the single, peccant, groping man with the hard unrelenting universe around him. In 'Finnegan's Wake' (sic) he went farther, and in a strange inventive tongue he seemed to break through the barriers of time, though so complex is the medium that without commentary few can follow the meaning. In his background were the old traditions of Dublin and of the Roman Catholic Church. He broke with them both as far as a man can ever break with so deeply grounded a past, and portrayed the chaos of a disorganised world. " A guy named Tim Szeliga urlLink runs a website devoted to James Joyce, in which you can not only read Ulysses and Fennegans Wake, but search them in online concordances. That's just why the web is so cool. postscript: If you read me often, you know this blog was named for last year's memo which came via the universe from God himself, as they do each year, to teach me about His world. This year's memo is just starting to take form, but already James Joyce plays a central role. What do I do? Rename my blog? Everyone knows of it as its old title. I think this year it should be A Commodious Vicus of Recirculation. We could call it Commodious for short. Really. What do I do?

 What a fantastic weekend for football. Three out of the four playoff games went into overtime, and that deserves two giant asterisks because 1) if Danta Hall had been just a yard or two luckier, all four would have gone into overtime, and 2) one of the games went into double overtime for just the fifth time in NFL playoff history. I love, love, love football. With a passion, I love it. And as the season nears its end I feel this ravenous appetite to savour every last drop of the waning season. So last night, rather than split my attention between my dinner party guests and the final game of the weekend (thus being both rude to my guests and not fully free to enjoy the game with gusto), I watched until they arrived--mid-way through the third quarter--then TiVoed the rest of the game. Later, as I watched the recorded game, I was in pain when I realized TiVo only captured the game to the end of regulation. No overtime! Why can't TiVo figure out the game isn't over! It was my own personal Heidi incident (no, I'm not old enough to remember that, but I've heard the story told by football fans still in pain). The worst is this, at around 7:35 I realized this might be a danger, so I turned the TV on--we were midway through the Simpsons, but the channel guide said Bernie Mac Show, so I knew the game had run late--and pressed record again then turned the TV off. If I had done this at 7:29, I would have been safe, but TiVo thought I really did want the Bernie Mac Show and only got the Simpsons which ran in its place. The second shortcoming is that I cannot record one show live, and watch another show live. Replay TV does this, but not my TiVo. This wasn't too big a problem until today when Sharon returned live to the Sharon Osbourne Show at the same time Ellen played in her new slot on local NBC. I ended up watching Sharon, and flipping over to Ellen during commercials, which used to be what I did for the View, but the View just sucks now. Ellen is so funny, really hurt your side funny, and Sharon is so genuine and Osbourne! Her show is like watching the greenroom chats behind MTV. The very fact that I have this difficult choice to make really says a lot about the continually improving quality of daytime TV. Imagine if I turned into a work-from-home mom five years ago when my only choices would have been the Price is Right or Maury Povich!

 Looking for Superbowl housing? Shall I say, a Super Bowl rental? We have a two bedroom, one bath home that sleeps five. Plus, next to our house, we have a fifth wheel travel RV that sleeps six and has its own kitchen, bathroom, and TV. Our house rents for $500/day and the trailer for $350/day. The two together come at the bargain price of $700/day. No pets, and I'll need a security deposit. We live just ten blocks from the lightrail line that runs from downtown Houston to Reliant Stadium, where the Superbowl is being played. Our house is also two blocks from the 50 bus line that goes directly to the lightrail if you don't feel like walking. I think the Super Bowl parade route will be just a few blocks from the house as well. urlLink Contact me via email if you're interested!

 I think the writers of Sex and the City must have had a crisis of sorts, and therefore decided to kill the show that represented their now-dead values. This, the wrap-up season, is full of statements on shallow women who have hit bottom in their shallow-hood and now are reclaiming themselves as people who really do believe in romance, love, life, and sincerity. The main character of the show, New York City, is preparing its swan dance in the bright autumn colors that leave us to believe the dead of winter will set on all the facades: Oscar de Lorenta, Central Park, and Carrie Bradshaw's belief that romance was a placating warm blanket people outside the city held onto when reality felt too cold. She, of course, has always known better, that is until the writers brought in a foreign lover to show her the way. Did they fall out of love with New York City? Or America? What are they telling us? What's the big moral? Underneath (or on top of?) all those expensive shoes and poofy dresses we're just tired? I don't know, maybe I'm to romantic in my thoughts on the show that I've quite literally grown up with. Maybe Sara Jessica Parker simply can't be botoxed back into her thirties any longer so they were left with the choice of making a Carrie-bot or killing the show. For me, part of the romance fell away when I bought Kim Cattrall's book Satisfaction and found that I'd actually tried all those positions before I was twenty-five. It didn't help that Cattrall was divorced to her life's love and co-author before the book hit print. To quote tonight's show, Samantha, I expected more of you. Of course another big chunk of the magic was lost when Miranda got pregnant and, instead of portraying this aspect of albeit stylized women's lives as another choice in the myriad of forks that we can stylishly enjoy, pregnancy and motherhood were clearly among the distasteful sidebars women endure along with bikini waxes and messy cunnilingus kisses. Carrie herself is seeming unbelievably shallow these past two seasons. Ironically, the character who was initially introduced to represent shallow, Big, is a giant leap of character above Carrie. Do the writers want me to feel this way about her? Is that their commentary on our culture? Are we left to admire the traditionally (in the run of the show, anyway) weak Charlotte as the archetype of femininity? After all, she held to her ideals without wavering the whole run, and she's ending with all her goals met: marriage, family, money, and the johnny-come-lately value religion... OK, I'm confused, I'm still going to stick out the rest of the season. But now I have to go because the guys from Queer Eye are on South Park. Rock.

 I can't tell you how many people greeted my pre-war protests with affirmations that the administration had a very good reason for this that they just couldn't' share. My neighbor whose husband had served in the Army, my aunt and uncle who had served in the Air Force, just to name a few, truly believed. They needed to believe. But CBS aired Rumsfeld notes to his aide from the morning of 9/11 with the phrase "sweep Iraq" showing that even then the opportunist in him knew to use this tragedy as an excuse to recreate in a sickly Freudian way his unresolved conflict. Rumsfeld and Cheney were in charge of Gulf War I, it was their failure. This was their chance to right their wrong. I think its poetic irony worthy of Shakespeare himself that getting what they wanted most of all will be their undoing.

 urlLink My So-Called Blog : "Only five years ago, mounting an online journal or its close cousin, the blog, required at least a modicum of technical know-how. But today, using sites like LiveJournal or Blogger or Xanga, users can sign up for a free account, and with little computer knowledge design a site within minutes. According to figures released last October by Perseus Development Corporation, a company that designs software for online surveys, there are expected to be 10 million blogs by the end of 2004. In the news media, the blog explosion has been portrayed as a transformation of the industry, a thousand minipundits blooming. But the vast majority of bloggers are teens and young adults. Ninety percent of those with blogs are between 13 and 29 years old; a full 51 percent are between 13 and 19, according to Perseus. Many teen blogs are short-lived experiments. But for a significant number, they become a way of life, a daily record of a community's private thoughts -- a kind of invisible high school that floats above the daily life of teenagers. Back in the 1980's, when I attended high school, reading someone's diary would have been the ultimate intrusion. But communication was rudimentary back then. There were no cellphones, or answering machines; there was no ''texting,'' no MP3's or JPEG's, no digital cameras or file-sharing software; there was no World Wide Web -- none of the private-ish, public-ish, superimmediate forums kids today take for granted. If this new technology has provided a million ways to stay in touch, it has also acted as both an amplifier and a distortion device for human intimacy. The new forms of communication are madly contradictory: anonymous, but traceable; instantaneous, then saved forever (unless deleted in a snit).

 We'd secretly coveted this when chosing our own recent TiVo, but couldn't shell out the big bucks. Boy am I glad now. urlLink Boing Boing: A Directory of Wonderful Things : "TiVo has rolled out 'TiVo to Go,' a service that allows you to move video from your TiVo to your PC's hard-drive, and then to burn the file to a DVD. Unfortunately, the system uses a proprietary DRM system that tethers the video to your machine and your home, meaning that you can't move the video to your hard-drive as an MPG file that you can edit at will, send to a friend, include in a school report, grab stills out of to make a highlight reel, etc. In other words, TiVo is lagging the functionality available for free in open source software projects like mythtv.

Lisa's poor husband is terribly sick with the flu, though, something we really sympathize with since John was sick with the stomach flu for Ella's second and third days. I still remember it, he was so disgustingly nauseous as I was trying to get out of the hospital, and as we drove up to the house my mom was trying to get John to pose for pictures of coming home and John could only throw the baby at my mom and dash inside to begin his two days o'puking! It was strange to have John sick for such an otherwise amazing time. It makes for a fun story now, but I know John would have preferred spending those days holding his newborn daughter.

 Washington Post on the Bush twins: "At the same time, those girls had gotten expert at exploiting the notoriety they had gained as the president's daughters. They popped up in Hollywood, where Jenna had an internship with an entertainment company, and danced the night away with a posse of 20. In St.-Tropez, Jenna partied with Sean "P. Diddy" Combs. In New York, the twins sent one of their Secret Service agents over to procure an introduction to rocker Chris Cornell, the frontman for the band Audioslave. The girls were not averse to showing up at places where controlled substances were enjoyed. At a Four Seasons Grill Room party for wunderkind designer Zac Posen that Barbara attended, the air smelled of pot, according to the New York Daily News. In Los Angeles, they showed up at a Nike party, where they met movie star Ashton Kutcher, who ended up taking them back to his house, he told Rolling Stone. "So we're hanging out," he said.

 Edward at urlLink RedTed Keeps a Diary urlLink posted this about my reading post below. I think the tradition of haunting the bookstores began a few semesters after I graduated with my BA. Right about the time my withdrawal symptoms really began appearing. Since then, I've tried so many times to get into a good Ph.D. program that I honestly can't ask my advisors for letters of recommendation anymore. So to fulfill myself in some small way, I continue the readings and imagine the lectures and discussions all the way. Sick and sad, I know. As undergraduates, John and I visited Stanford and Berkeley intending to apply. The Stanford admissions officer was really nice as she explained that I could apply to the anthropology program if I liked, but I didn't have much of a chance since my two internships didn't exactly count as life experience. She said to go out into the world and work a few years, find myself, then come back and apply. It was good advice, if only it had worked! After graduation, I moved here to Houston with John as he was hired fresh out by NASA (and we were married, so moving is sort of part of that package). I was hired by MFAH, where I'd interned a few years earlier, but instead of working in curatorial as I'd hoped, I worked in Development. I was happy to have a job at all because we were pretty poor, and in retrospect, learning how to support an organization financially, especially through grants and individual requests, was pretty valuable considering my life's course. But I missed being in school so bad. I wanted to cram my brain full while it was still a sponge. I wanted to surround myself with thoughts about the world. This was around the time that I first got involved with the United Nations, and that was an addictive drug in itself! I thought the best way to get back to the UN was more education. I applied to Rice and was turned down. I think that was because I refused to take the GRE, and while they didn't require it, they frowned upon the incongruity. The next year, I applied to graduate programs in Boston to match John's application to MIT. We were both turned down. This time, we were told the economic downturn resulted in 300%+ increases in applicants, and those without jobs were prioritized over those with. Whatever. Last year was the best attempt on record, I did everything right for the first time. I made the site visit in October at the BioSphere 2 Columbia campus. I hit it off so well with two professors, we really could have had a dinner party after the interviews because we enjoyed talking so much. I think it was amazing to have things go so well when I was seven months pregnant and the aesthetic opposite of the students in the classes I visited. I got all my letters of recommendation in early, I took the computer GRE, my statement of purpose focused on NGOs and public policy, perfectly aligned with the mission of the program. Just after applications for early admissions went in, however, I got a nice email saying Columbia's Earth Institute would be phasing out of the BioSphere program at the close of the year. The program to which I'd applied was killed! I was offered a spot on the waiting list for the equivalent program at the NY campus, but had to decline because John had no place in NYC, his research was so perfectly paralleled with the work done at BioSphere that he'd planned on taking a research sabbatical while I worked on my degree. Plus, the program in NY couldn't hold a candle to the one at BioSphere, and frankly wasn't worth the family sacrifices and 50K we'd planned to spend on my tuition. In retrospect, all happened as it should have. The Space Shuttle accident would have prevented John's sabbatical anyway, and I'm glad to be writing and spending lots of time with my baby and toddler. Here's the irony, though, the meetings we're holding in NY in a few weeks will be hosted at the Earth Institute. I'm certain we'll meet the very people who reviewed my application materials. I'm looking forward to that! So Rice applications are due at the end of the month and I again found myself perusing the process at the Anthropology pages. I just can't do this all again. I'm too beaten. Someday my lust for graduate degrees will probably drive me to apply again, until then, I'm on a good track to be published soon and that, along with raising my children, takes enough of my time. I did, however, convince my mom to apply!

Heading up to last week's opening, the system faced critics and SUVs running into trains.

 I'm hungering for good literature. It's nearing that time of year that I love, that time just a few weeks into the semester at colleges when I can sneak into the bookstore, pretending I'm a student, and peruse the anthropology, sociology, and literature shelves. I read the course names, look for professors whose chosen texts I know I enjoy, and buy up the books those students who just dropped the class returned. But it's not that time yet, so I'm left with this hunger! That feeling is what lead me to peruse my own bookshelves, legion though they be in my little 950 square foot house. I found a book I'd bought on just such an expedition at UHCL last fall, but had overlooked until now. It's two novellas published together: Taratuta and Still Life with Pipe , by Jose Donoso. In the intro to Taratuta, Donoso writes: "It seems to me that the novelistic in real life rarely turns out to be novelable: in order to create an aesthetic world an author usually begins with quite modest facts: the familiar trait of a known person, the half-open window of a bedroom in disarray, a word with childhood resonances, an expression that betrays the deceit of a father, a priest, a woman, and it is the artist who chooses, puts together, and takes apart in order to construct the other truth, the truth of deception."

 This week the media was all over the new survey that discovered Houston's three-year title (the unbuckled belt, if you will) for fattest city urlLink has fallen to Detroit . Woohoo! We're only second fattest! This week the lightrail also opened, which might have connected in more literate news editors' minds in some story that pens hope for fitness with cleaner transportation, but no. Largely because of the oil boom, Houston is all about the car. Back when I worked at urlLink MFAH , the world-renowned architect Rafael Moneo was brought in to create this masterpiece of a structure, and what did the magnifico choose to make the focal point of this, the largest exhibition space this side of the Mississippi? The carport. I used to say it's the most car-dependent city in the nation, but this study actually brought to my mind one city that is more about the car: Detroit. Isn't anyone making the connection? But wait, it gets worse, Houston has the nation's worst air quality. Maybe, through less dependence on oil, and more investment on cleaner transportation solutions, people can be healthier? More blasphemous words could not be uttered.

He can ride the lightrail and see how cool downtown is now, actually looks like a city and all. John could even show him NASA... maybe. Here's hoping. If you aren't Houston and you come upon this link and you would like to rent my house, click urlLink here and urlLink here for past posts on the topic.

 urlLink Guardian Unlimited | Special reports | Salam Pax: Baghdad Blogger : "In addition, everybody seems to have quickly forgotten the allegations over the way Orascom got the deal for central Iraq in the first place. Kickbacks, baksheesh and nepotism. Eh, who cares? 'Make your fingers play' is what they tell you, and for deals that big they may well have made huge trunks full of money play, not just their fingers. And in this part of the world no one was surprised when some subcontractors went to governing council members' relatives, or when ministers are too closely related to the GC member who elected them. Same-same; it is just too difficult to change social structures overnight. We have a saying: 'Me and my brother against my cousin, and me and my cousin against a stranger.' A cousin is anyone with the same family name. Who told you it was only the south of Iraq that was tribal? "

 For two years John and I have lusted after TiVo. When we'd tell friends about it we'd usually get the same response: I try not to watch too much TV. John's the epitome of peace, never gets annoyed even, but I would have to swallow my response in my throat to what was obviously a commentary on the kind of person I must be if I watch enough TV to merit a digital recording device. In time, we developed a counter argument in which we explained that TiVo actually lets you watch less crap TV because when you're in that mood to just vegetate (my mom calls it bubblegum for the mind, when you've done highly interactive brain stuff all day and just want to veg), you can rely on the vast storehouse of stuff you actually like. You aren't at the mercy of NBC's Friends re-runs or some equally smelly tripe. So far we've found our arguments validated. Plus, we've found a few new attributes to TiVo that were unexpected. They're largely due to our parenthood. For example, when the baby accidentally falls on the toddlers lego masterpiece and both are very upset, I can press pause until the crisis abates. Also, you are free to watch shows that the average parents' schedule prevents. I mean shows that come on after you accidentally passed out exhausted while tucking your son into bed. Last night I set the TiVo to catch two fantastic programs on Chinese civilization that ran around 3 a.m. when only shift workers or insomniacs would otherwise benefit from the experience. This morning as I sat on the couch unable to move because the cold-wrought Ellie just wants to nurse and nurse, I put them on and was pleased to watch a pop-entertainment special filmed in Beijing on New Year's Eve. They ended with this group song called Shaking Hands, the lyrical finale sang Shaking hands with the world/ shaking hands with peace/with spring/with future/shaking hands. It was so beautiful! And I would have missed that.

 In October I added my site meter, which tells me about the ways people get to my site. Since then, I feel pretty guilty when I see people who find my blog while searching for something else through Google. I know they must see a snippet of their subject in the google descriptor, then they click on it and find my blog's main page which is probably days or weeks past that subject's post and they have no way of knowing where it is. So I added a search box to my site that only searches my two blogs. It won't do much for all the Sharon Osbourne Nude Photos searches I get though, because I once had two posts back to back about Nudestock and Sharon Osbourne and Google's bots think it's the same post. Now that I've mentioned it again, I will probably get even more hits! Shame on you people for oogling America's mama! Serves you right to get misdirected here... I liked the way Lisa explained her search box on urlLink Cadence90 , so I kind of pilfered it. Hope that's cool... Speaking of Lisa, she has urlLink a nice entry today about the social nature of blogging, with advice for enhancing it.

 urlLink SF Gate : Religious broadcaster Pat Robertson said Friday he believes God has told him President Bush will be re-elected in a "blowout" in November. "I think George Bush is going to win in a walk," Robertson said on his "700 Club" program on the Virginia Beach-based Christian Broadcasting Network, which he founded. "I really believe I'm hearing from the Lord it's going to be like a blowout election in 2004. It's shaping up that way." Robertson told viewers he spent several days in prayer at the end of 2003. "The Lord has just blessed him," Robertson said of Bush. "I mean, he could make terrible mistakes and comes out of it. It doesn't make any difference what he does, good or bad, God picks him up because he's a man of prayer and God's blessing him." urlLink Free Speech Radio News said maybe he just heard Carl Rove and thought it was God. What can I add to that? First the Supreme Court picks presidents, and now God? I shouldn't scoff. After all, this isn't the first time God's urlLink spoken through an ass ...

 Lisa, of Cadence90, blogs her life of coding and parenting. She's about to have her second child this week so the blogging activity should understandably dip for a week or more, but the archives are pretty interesting. Like urlLink Rebecca Blood , she's a reader, but whereas Blood likes classic lit, Lisa seems to like current social and technology policy titles. I commented on her urlLink entry about Kevin Phillips' Wealth and Democracy . On her website's blogroll she links to a page titled My Late Father's Blog, I can't tell if that's the title someone else gave it or if it's her own late father, but he goes (went?) to the same church my dad and step-mom go to in Santa Fe! What a small world...

 So this was my first weekend with TiVo, very exciting! First, let me explain how TiVo has transformed my fan-dom of football. During the play-offs, or after the college season (I'm not sure which is the bigger factor), NFL games play on Saturday. This doubles my time drinking beer and laying on the couch, and consequently, typically cuts my productive weekend time down quite a bit. But this Saturday was different! This Saturday I wrote and read through the first thirty minutes of the doubleheader, then I balip-balip-balipped my way to the beginning of the game and watched football without commercials! It was perfect! Here's the amazing thing though, thirty minutes was actually not enough of a delay, I could have skipped the first 45 minutes and still watched the last half of the forth quarter live (somehow it seems wrong not to watch the end of the game live). I felt so productive! TiVo gave me minutes back in my life! As if that weren't good enough, Sunday night we had coincidentally left the TiVo on HBO while the TV was off. We played with the kids, urlLink put up Aidan's tent for the Responsibility Chart Award , put them to bed, then sat down to watch some TV before the weekend was officially over. As I turned on the TV I realized I'd missed the first half of the Sex and the City season opener! Noooo! Then a zen-like calm overtook me as I realized I could balip-balip-balip my way back to its beginning, plus save the whole episode for my sister-in-law! Of course, now we're going to have to upgrade our monthly subscription to TiVo plus (something like $10 or $15/month) so I can get season pass and then TiVo will recognize for me that I'm about to miss one of the shows I watch most often and record it in a special temp spot on its drive. This is so great. Really. It's like in the tier of great things in my life shared by Yolanda and sex and dark chocolate and good red wine. Oh wait, now it's coming to me! My ideal fantasy has suddenly become leaving the kids with Yolanda, having sex while eating dark chocolate, drinking good red wine, and watching TiVo! Yes! Yes! oh God, Yes! OK, back to reality. But that's not so bad because now reality has TiVo. Sort of. Last night as John and I cuddled for one last protected moment before we retreated to bed and the beginning of The Work Week, I begged him to invent a way to TiVo the weekend, so I could just balip my way back to Friday night and have it all to live through again...

 Special congratulations go out to my main squeeze John, or urlLink Spaceboy , as his blog ego is known, for starting his blog! It's totally devoted to space and it's fantastic so add him to your blog roll already!

 I got to thinking others might be wondering since the last post just where the Spirit pictures are. urlLink They're here .

 What a day, first Luca emails urlLink the link to his website , on which he began a blog for his Romecoming trip! Then, John tells me that the events of last night--the waiting for reliable news on the lander, and then not being able to find the pictures easily--might motivate him to finally start a space blog! He's been complaining for months how there are _no_ space blogs out there. Each time he brings it up I tell him it's the universe calling him to the task...

 David Weinberger at JOHO has a nice veggie rant urlLink here, with comments . urlLink A Vegetarian Philosophy, by Peter Singer : "This recipe is vegan, very simple, nutritious, and tasty. It's also eaten by hundreds of millions of people every day. DAL 2 tablespoons oil 1 onion, chopped 2 cloves garlic, crushed 1 cup dry red lentils 3 cups water bay leaf 1 cinnamon stick 1 teaspoon medium curry powder or to taste 1 14-ounce can of chopped tomatoes or equivalent chopped fresh tomatoes 2 ounces creamed coconut or half cup coconut milk (optional) Juice of lemon (optional) Salt to taste In a deep frying pan, heat the oil and fry the onion and garlic until translucent. Add the lentils and fry them for a minute or two, then add the water, bay leaf, cinnamon stick, and curry powder. Stir, bring to a boil, then let simmer for twenty minutes, adding a little more water from time to time if it gets dry. Add the tomatoes and simmer another ten minutes. By now the lentils should be very soft. Add the creamed coconut or coconut milk and lemon juice, if using, and salt to taste. Remove cinnamon stick and bay leaf before serving. The final product should flow freely�add more water if it is too thick. It is usually served over rice, with some lime pickle and mango chutney. Sliced banana is another good accompaniment, and so too are pappadams. "

 urlLink BBC NEWS | Middle East | 'Miracle rescue' from Iran quake : "Rescuers in Iran have pulled an elderly woman alive and unscathed from the rubble of Bam - eight days after an earthquake destroyed the city.

 Hope we join you there someday!

 you have to watch SNL to get that. Anyway, urlLink here's a great site that anyone like John will love. It's a weblog all about maps. Linked in that weblog, is a site run by a student at Rice dedicated to maps on the settlement of the Lower Rio Grande region. Actually something I would enjoy, too! I wonder if this guy knows about the whole urlLink historic Rio not flowing to the ocean thing ...

 I wish I'd known about this a few weeks back, but it's still nice. NASA wrote up this quaint little article of all the holidays past shared by astronauts far from home... urlLink HSF > Living In Space > SPACE FOOD : "Commander Frank Borman, Command Module Pilot Jim Lovell and Lunar Module Pilot William Anders became the first humans to orbit the Moon on Christmas Eve 1968. They were also the first astronauts to spend Christmas in space. To mark the occasion, they sent Christmas greetings and live images back to their home planet and read from the Book of Genesis. It is estimated that as many as one billion people watched the historic broadcast or listened on the radio."

 This morning we got up and took the kids (on foot, except Ellie, who was backpacked in) downtown to catch the newly opened lightrail. We got off at Rice and walked the Rice walk/jog trail to the Village where we ate at Croissant Brioche. The train was so much fun! The city center was as busy as a workday, but instead of the sidewalks being filled with tight suits and serious faces, they were filled with excited faces, people who were proud of their city! Everywhere we went, this great energy just radiated. Well, maybe not everywhere. The Rice trail regulars were like, what? who let all these average people into my neighborhood? The city itself feels so different, for one, it feels like a real city! But there's something else, I can't explain it. I'll have to spend the next week riding the rails and working on articulating this great new urban identity. Aidan was a champion, he walked all the way both ways, nearly completely without whining. People kept complimenting him on walking like such a big boy. You can't take strollers on the trains anyway without folding them away, just one more reasons that strollers seem very un-new urbanist. We should teach our children to love walking as soon as they are able! And, chances are, they are able much sooner than you'd think. This past summer we made Aidan walk all over Europe's cities when he was only 2 years and 4 months, and he did great. We just had to be hard asses for a little while about it. We told him strollers are for babies like his little sister, not for big boys like him. I digressed far. Now, I'm resting comfortably on the couch with a nice cold beer in our new frosty freezer beer mugs... Thanks, Jenny! Time for the playoffs!

 urlLink Jim Moore's cybernetics, politics, emergence, etc. : Home Page : "We can best connect to other social worlds through the social shortcuts of weak ties, by which we engage folks that are not necessarily that close to us initially--e.g. Uncle Albert, or an old high school friend, or someone we know at work, at the dry cleaners, or where we have our car repaired. These bridge persons may not be that emotionally close to the people we hope to reach on the other end of the connection, either--but the value of bridging is that the relationship may be just strong enough, as a social tie, to spread an idea or enable a new connection for action. Blogs have a special social relevance because they allow their bloggers to create and maintain a network of weak social ties. The network of weak ties that a blogger can sustain is open to all comers, and is potentially vast and highly diverse (as diverse as the web itself--which of couse is not diverse enough, but is more diverse than, say, academic journals). Blogs are weak tie machines! Anyone (you!) can read my blog. "

 urlLink The Religious Left : "Father Art noted in his sermon that, in a book by Jennifer Hecht entitled Doubt, the author quotes a Zen master: Little doubt, little insight. Big doubt, big insight. No doubt, no insight. Interesting. I've seen those bumper stickers that say "Feed your faith--starve your doubts." The implication there seems to be that doubt is something we need to avoid, or at least shake off quickly. I don't agree. I think we need to pay attention to all of our internal stirrings, positive and negative, and find out what they are trying to tell us. "

 urlLink very funny flash video . i like the analogy of bush as Gollam.

 urlLink Tomorrow night at 8:14 pm EST , twin rovers named Spirit and Opportunity will jettison from the spacecraft they've been traveling in. The first twin, Spirit, will hurtle toward the surface of Mars, landing at 8:35, give or take a few minutes. It should bounce around on airbags for about ten minutes, then deploy antennas and--here's the big hope--notify NASA JPL of its safe arrival just in time for the prime time news here in on Earth! Opportunity will have its own landing in a few weeks on January 24. Double the chances for good landing sites, and double the news coverage! NASA Select will begin coverage around 6:30 tomorrow evening, the channel is carried these days by Dish, but you can also urlLink watch it here . Landing on Mars has urlLink proven pretty tricky lately , so the project will still be an overwhelming success if the landers perk up at any point, much less right away. In related Mars news, NASA recently put out urlLink this neat picture taken by Mars Global Surveyor's Oribiter Camera this week.

 I'm not exactly feeling the renewal yet, but at least I survived the night of falling bullets, as New Years could be known when you live in Texas... I spent the day celebrating the lightrail kick-off downtown and getting to know my TiVo! Davis, John’s co-op from Penn State, came over for the lightrail festivities and ended up staying most of the day. He was an Ikea virgin, so he went with John to get toy bins for me, and then they went to the grocery store to buy pazole ingredients, and John made a great pot of pazole. Davis was also a Queer Eye virgin, but I took care of that! Happy birthday to my many relatives who have birthdays today: my bio pop dad, my sister-in-law Kim, my brother-in-law Teddy, and others. Every big holiday like anniversaries or New Years John and I play the where were we game. So here it goes. On New Years one year ago we were too pregnant to really celebrate the holiday. I could barely stay awake and we drank something stupidly wannabe. Two years ago, we also could barely stay awake until midnight, but it was because we'd been skiing all day in Santa Fe! Three years ago, we were again too pregnant to do any real celebrating. At midnight we walked to the footbridge over Memorial and watched the fireworks go off downtown. Four years ago, we were in Santa Fe for the big 2000. We opened a bottle of saved champagne at the building site for my bio dad's new house and told the family this was the year we'd chosen to start our family. Five years ago, we were in Fort Collins, Colorado for my cousins Bridgette and Ryan Reed's wedding (their family welcomed little Abigail Reed this past February!). John and I had just moved back to El Paso to finish our schooling after the last of the co-ops and internships, and we were newlyweds in secrecy since it was the strange months between when we eloped and our actual wedding ceremony. Six years ago we were in Ruidoso with friends John and Lisa. We rented a cabin and played in the snow! Seven years ago we were in El Paso, again with John and Lisa as well as some of Lisa's friends. I remember having a nice bottle of champagne we'd gotten in Napa a month earlier when interviewing at Stanford and Berkley, and John's tea-totaling friends were less than impressed. Eight years ago, we were again in Ruidoso with John and Lisa, as well as Ginger Hague, a friend of theirs from the dark days of high school. It was my first big outing with his friends from his old life. Nine years ago... Here's the controversy. It was our first New Years together and we can't remember how it was spent. Somebody help us please! Maybe nine was the first Ruidoso thing and it's eight we can't recall, but nonetheless, it's the first holiday ever that we've forgotten! I've created somewhat of a log here and now, so this should never happen again.

 OK, Mr. Locke, urlLink you asked for it . You won the rock the vote grant, or whatever comparable award a teacher gets for promoting politics to the disillusioned youth. Now unplug, step back. You've been living in a giant fabricated reality that wants you to think it's real. It's called the American political system, and once you get out of it, you can see clearly that these confines, these shackles, these urlLink BORDERS ! are harming us. Did you think you had the sole proprietorship of losing your heart at the '92 election? I was at the Inauguration in D.C.! Only, I wasn't cheering for our boy, Clinton. No, I fell hard for Al. And like a groupie outside Bono's door, I waited 9 long years for another shot at him! Then, in November 2000, even though I was eight months pregnant, and my apartment was mostly dismantled and moved to the house, I sat awake _all_night_long_ to watch his fall from grace. urlLink Ms. Mary Anne Glendon and her fellow progress'ophobes think the California and Massachusetts marriages are "government of four people," well, the country saw a government of five people three and a half years ago. Today I passed a car with a bumper sticker that read "Election 2004: End of an error." Like our Mr. Locke, this guy somehow escaped total disillusion. I honor that, but I don't share it. The key reason urlLink Dean never surfaced in the float test is the same reason I supported him. He was unwilling to be urlLink Terry Mcauliffe's yes-man. Aside from Kucinich and Sharpton, I don't see another Democratic candidate that deserves my vote. There are eight months left before the election, I'm open to seeing new evidence emerge, but simply not being quite as bad as Bush is just the kind of quitter talk that convinced Al to shut up and take defeat like a man back in 2000. Like the Bush administration's oversimplified duality of good and evil countries in the world, the dichotomous system of Republican and Democrat parties in America serves to perpetuate the status quo and distort reality. Look at national poles, and magically, everyone seems to perfectly fall at 50-50 percentiles. Elections are suddenly all a draw. Realistically, urlLink is there any way we all fall so neatly down two sides? It's all a big lie manufactured by six (next week it should be five) giant corporations to whom the status quo has been pretty good, and you're choosing to stay plugged into that lie. Rise above it! Ally yourself with progress first, and pick a candidate second. After learning the lesson of urlLink Nader --that as long as the dual-party system exists in the US, we'll be stuck with shades of gray--I'm left to hope multiple parties pop up over my lifetime, and support that progress where I can. But more important, I'm free to look at change as a global issue that doesn't have to depend on whichever uber-patriotic wacko gets to answer the red phone next year. As an individual, you can--and probably should--vote. But that's just one day of the year. On the other 364 days, do what you can (and I know you do, you're a teacher) to urlLink support the efforts that actually are making a difference.

 Night before last I dreamt we were in our Earthship at urlLink Greater World . That night, before I went to bed, I had sat in front of my desktop wallpaper--a panoramic picture we took last October from the porch of the Harris Earthship. The photo shows just a portion of the gorgeous view that sweeps across the highland plateau, eerily masking the Rio Grande Gorge, and is crowned by Taos Mountain in the foreground, and Wheeler Peak behind. When you look at this picture on my 17-inch iMac's screen, you can almost fool your brain into believing you're looking out a window. And so my brain returned the favor by almost fooling me into believing I was in my very own Earthship, just for a night. It was a sweet gift. Yesterday was such a hard day for us, John with work and me without it, at the day's end we sat huddled on the couch listening to the children sleep and recovering our stronghold on sanity. We both felt it, I'm so glad John said it first. He was homesick. I confessed I'd been hoping his travel wouldn't be approved and he laughed in relief. We decided to scrap Russia and spend our resources on going back home to northern New Mexico more frequently. Moscow would have been fantastic, and I love traveling abroad with the children. But there's only one place in the world that I recharge, and I'm so empty that I'm running on fumes. Just making the decision made the world feel lighter. This morning John played urlLink KTAO as we dressed the kids and he cooked. We all put on sweaters and carried thermal mugs and a bag of breakfast burritos over to Memorial so we could pretend we were watching urlLink the Balloon Fiesta instead of the Rodeo Parade. I tried to put out of my mind the smell of horse shit, the abundant Texas flags, and the obvious racial segregation (all of the 200+ African American riders were put together at the trailride's end, instead of interspersed throughout), and instead focus on believing I was watching the most beautiful spectacle eyes can view as balloons rise above the Sangre de Cristos on a crisp mountain fall morning.

 urlLink Guardian Unlimited | Guardian daily comment | We have become allergic to our western way of life : "There is accumulating evidence that the rise in allergies could be directly linked to the way in which we live and the environment which we inhabit. Sir Tom Blundell, chairman of the the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, argues that 'given our understanding of the way chemicals interact with the environment, you could say we are running a gigantic experiment with humans and all other living things as the subject'. The evidence so far appears disturbing: the thinning of seabirds' eggshells, sex changes in fish and shellfish, reduced human male fertility, and a rise in certain cancers linked to chemicals that have found their way into our environment and food chain. A study by scientists at the University of Lancaster has shown that organophosphorus pesticides that were banned some 15-20 years ago are still detectable in the blood. The fact that flame retardants, pesticides and dioxins can cross from mother to infant in breast milk is also a cause for concern. Our disregard for the delicate web that sustains our environment is leading to its degradation. There are in excess of 30,000 chemicals in products that we use and dispose of which have never been tested. The application of modern computational techniques coupled with improved environmental and health monitoring would go a long way towards rectifying this situation."

 Keisha Castle-Hughes of the Whale Rider is urlLink the latest star to choose to be delivered to the red carpet via Toyota Prius rather than the traditional stretch limo. Go Keisha. Did I need another reason to love her? When I told John, he said this is another good reason (aside from our family's needs: why urlLink can't a normal carseat fit in the back of a VW?!) for car companies to invest in hybrid-izing SUVs.

 Top picks of the week are Scrubs and Ellen DeGeneres (Tuesday). To be fair, I haven't watched West Wing off of TiVo yet. Scrubs was in top form, maybe one of the best ever, even though I did ruin the ending for my husband with my guessing. Ellen DeGeneres had Allison Janney on Tuesday, and those two had chemistry! They were so funny. I guess they must have become friends back in the day when Finding Nemo was filmed. Allison's been on Ellen's show a few times, and they've created something of a pingpong feud. Ellen won this match. And I thought Allison's overlay (Ellen called it an apron) was beautiful, I wish I had one. After a week off, it was nice to have live Daily Shows back. John Stuart had the funniest commentary on the gay marriage bit that I've yet seen. And speaking of the gay marriage bit, I almost cried the first time I saw urlLink Rosie and Kelli walk out of that court house in San Francisco. We're watching social change here folks, live. This will be on the history channel when our kids are adults. Big disappointments included MTV's overly billed episode of the Osbournes in which Ozzy had his accident. The suspense killed me (it nearly killed Ozzy), and when we got to the big moment they skipped right over it. Not even sounds with no visuals. I'm trying to be charitable here, by assuming it was too painful for the family to show. But why show anything at all if you're not going to show it all? I mean, Coral's anaphilactic shock was more exciting than this. And then there's the issue of Carmen and Dave's wedding. Either my TiVo missed it somehow, or they didn't actually show it this week after all. Somebody enlighten me. Friends has actually gotten so bad that Celebrity Survivor looks appealing. Hatch sure took his snuff-out well. I used to think he was so icky, but if he loses with as much grace as he won with, he rises on my list. I'm looking forward to Now tonight on PBS, but I don't know what I'll do Sunday without Sex.

 urlLink Guardian Unlimited | US elections 2004 | Leading evangelicals down the aisle : "The national lines are clearly drawn so that the younger, more Democratic, and less godly you are, them more you are likely to disagree with the president. There are plenty of close affiliates who are not going to like it either. The gay 'Log Cabin Republicans' are already threatening a guerrilla campaign against it.

 urlLink Guardian Unlimited Film | News | Gibson film ignores vow to remove blood libel : "...Geza Vermes, a former professor of Jewish Studies at Oxford and the author of five books on the life of Christ, writes of the film in today's Guardian: 'I have never seen anything so dreadful and I hope I never will.' The blood-spattered two-hour film about the crucifixion - in which all the dialogue is in contemporary languages with English subtitles - has provoked complaints from Britain's Jewish organisations but a broad welcome from evangelical Christians and Catholics. Prof Vermes immediately picked holes in the film, criticising its use of 'Catholic church Latin' by the Roman soldiers instead of the Greek they would have spoken, pointing out that Pilate is referred to as the 'governor' rather than the prefect of the province and spotting that the wrong Aramaic word for God is used throughout. The British Board of Deputies of British Jews said: 'It would have been better if this film had never been made. The glorification of violence and bloodshed and the reinforcement of medieval stereotyping of the Jewish people are extremely dangerous.' But Joel Edwards, general director of the Evangelical Alliance, said: '[We] believe the film will provide a good opportunity for Christians to talk to others about Jesus.' In Rome, the veteran Italian film director Franco Zeffirelli, who himself made a controversial film about the life of Christ, said Gibson was 'sinisterly attracted to the most unrestrained violence'..."

 urlLink Op-Ed Columnist: Stations of the Crass : "...Like Mr. Gibson, Mr. Bush is whipping up intolerance but calling it a sacred cause. At first, the preacher-in-chief resisted conservative calls for a constitutional ban on gay marriage. He felt, as Jesus put it in the Gibson script (otherwise known as the Gospels), "If it is possible, let this chalice pass from me." But under pressure from the Christian right, he grabbed the chalice with both hands and swigged — seeking to set a precedent in codifying discrimination in the Constitution, a document that in the past has been amended to correct discrimination by giving fuller citizenship rights to blacks, women and young people. If the president is truly concerned about preserving the sanctity of marriage, as one of my readers suggested, why not make divorce illegal and stone adulterers?..."

 urlLink Defiant Downloads Rise From Underground : "More than 300 Web sites and blogs staged a 24-hour online protest yesterday over a record company's efforts to stop them from offering downloadable copies of 'The Grey Album.' A popular underground collection of music, 'The Grey Album' mixes tracks from the Beatles' classic White Album with raps from Jay-Z's latest release, 'The Black Album.' The protesters billed the event as 'Grey Tuesday,' calling it 'a day of coordinated civil disobedience,' during which more than 150 sites offered the album for download.

 urlLink The Last Word: The Da Vinci Con : "''The Da Vinci Code'' is one long chase scene in which the main characters flee a sinister Parisian policeman and an albino monk assassin, but its rudimentary suspense alone couldn't have made it a hit. At regular intervals, the book brings its pell-mell plot to a screeching halt and emits a pellet of information concerning a centuries-old conspiracy that purports to have preserved a tremendous secret about the roots of Christianity itself. This ''nonfiction'' material gives ''The Da Vinci Code'' its frisson of authenticity, and it's lifted from ''Holy Blood, Holy Grail,'' one of the all-time great works of pop pseudohistory. But what seems increasingly clear (to cop a favorite phrase from the authors of ''Grail'') is that ''The Da Vinci Code,'' like ''Holy Blood, Holy Grail,'' is based on a notorious hoax."

 So here we are, capping off a long run of witty, pretty, tipsy ladies conversing Seinfeld-style in Manhattan about all sorts of things that either hit eerily close to home or fantastically far from it. It's hard to feel too much a sense of closure at this juncture because we might be heading for a screenplay before long. I have to assume that, like the X-Files end movie that never came to be, this is the end. At the show's beginning Carrie was near 30, the fabled age of the end of youth and the beginning of adulthood. Now nearing 40, Carrie has defied adulthood, ballyhooing ticking biological clocks, career ladders, and men who neither deserved monogamy nor entertained her social wanderlust. In essence, she defied the image of American women through their thirties. In this, the last season, the writers were obvious with their struggle to find the point to all these shoes and cosmopolitans. It seems they picked maturity to be the meaning of middle-aged urban life. So like lost orphans off of soap opera scripts, our four girls matured before the camera a little too rapidly, through these last seven episodes. Miranda matured when she realized family sacrifices trumped living in Manhattan. Charlotte matured when she was forced to refocus her vision of motherhood from a pretty pregnancy with high society baby showers and very expensive maternity clothes to the more achievable avenue of adoption. Samantha had maybe the truest moment of personal maturity this season, not when she underwent breast cancer, but rather when she found love and companionship more valuable than edgy sex, as in the episode where Smith was waiting outside the elevator door. Where's Carrie in all this maturing? I hoped experiencing other cultures would bring about her catharsis, but no, in an attempt to celebrate the same values, just a little geographically removed, she fell flat on her face. Literally. In the Paris Dior. We're left with a man A or man B plot conclusion. Last night I dreamt about it! I was deciding in my dream that surely she must choose Alexander because choosing Big would leave the hopeful movie devoid of sexual tension. Now, in my more lucid hours, I have to amend my proposal just a bit. She should choose Alexander, and it should work out miserably. Then, the movie could be filled with cute little narrations as she, in her expatriate solitude, writes a fantastic book (because we all know expatriate solitude produces fantastic books), and return to New York a triumphant success in her career, nevermind the sexual failure. Don't look for any of this to happen. Just enjoy the kinship of women across the country as we sit down together to say farewell to Sex. Lift a cosmopolitan for Carrie Bradshaw, the woman that defied her thirties. Btw, here's a nice conversation between two women smarter than I, about what should happen to Carrie: urlLink Do We Need Men to Be Happy?

 urlLink The Observer | Focus | America stirs up a sugar rebellion : "One of those who saw the intensive lobbying efforts at first hand is Dr Pekka Puska, who was head of non-communicable diseases at the WHO until he left to run Finland's leading public health institute. 'After we produced the 916 report, the lobbying was quite extraordinary, particularly when they threatened to withdraw US financial support to WHO,' recalled Puska. 'We had done everything possible to be transparent, to be fair and rigorous, and we held meetings around the world on it. Ours was a balanced road-map to help individual nations decide how they could combat this trend. Every third person in the world has cardiovascular disease - how can we stand by and not try to do something?'

Bruce Silverglade, of the US health campaign group Centre for Science in the Public Interest, said that the influence of 'Big Sugar' in the about-turn was obvious. "

 urlLink The Observer | Food monthly | The big issue : "The beginnings of America's little weight problem can be traced to the Seventies, when Richard Nixon appointed Earl Butz to be his secretary of agriculture. Butz's job, among other things, was to ensure that disgruntled farmers voted the right way. The result, to cut a long story short, was that corn production soared to an all-time high. By the early Eighties, Butz's legacy was clear: prices on most commodities were down, a state of affairs that has continued ever since. The government still underwrites the production of corn to the exclusion of just about everything else. President Bush has recently passed a bill giving farmers $800 billion over the next 10 years. Then came several crucial technological developments. In 1971, scientists in Japan found a way to produce a cheaper sweetener than sugar: high-fructose corn syrup, or HFCS. Made from corn, it was six times sweeter than sugar. However, unlike sucrose or dextrose, it takes a different route into the human metabolism and, as a result, is rather less healthy than other sugars. In the mid-Seventies, palm oil, previously tricky to process, became available as commercial fat, fit for frying French fries and for baking cookies; moreover, products made with it last. Unfortunately, it is also 45 per cent saturated fat. Palm oil and HFCS changed the nature of the foods Americans love to eat forever. Finally, there was the abandonment of portion control. It took the fast food companies a surprisingly long time to realise that people would rather buy one vast portion of fries or one giant bucket of Coke than look greedy and buy two smaller ones. But once Taco Bell and McDonald's had trialled this idea and their sales rocketed sky high, there was no going back. Bigness was here to stay; customers felt ripped off if they were offered anything less. As of 1996, 25 percent of the $97 billion spent on fast food came from items promoted on the basis of larger size or extra portions. Such changes have had a startling effect on what an American requires to make him feel satiated."

 The dream team ticket: Ralph Nader and Dennis Kucinich this is funny: urlLink Electablog* Campaign News with all the Carbs

 I'm feeling pretty good about supporting Nader these days. If Kerry gets the nod, I'm not inclined to vote for a Bush-lite candidate. Besides, I think Ralph Nader tops the list (which also includes France, Russia, Germany, and Kofi Anon) of individuals the American people at large need to issue apologies for. Everything Nader said about corporations running Washington has come to pass. And moreover, everything he said about Dems just being a shade of gray off the Republican party was proven when they backed Bush on Homeland Security, Afghanistan, and Iraq. urlLink The Seattle Times: Nation & World: Campaign Notebook: Nader candidacy expected " WASHINGTON Â Former Green Party candidate Ralph Nader is poised to declare that he will seek the presidency again this year, this time as an independent and despite a vigorous effort by the left to dissuade him, according to friends and associates. "I think there's very little doubt," said Micah Sifry, author of a book on third-party politics and a longtime Nader watcher. "I think he's going to run." Nader, blamed for tilting the 2000 election to President Bush by siphoning off votes from Al Gore, twice has delayed saying whether he would be a candidate, but insiders expect the declaration next week. Sifry is part of the campaign to stop Nader from running, including an open letter to him last month in The Nation, a liberal magazine that has been associated with Nader for 30 years. Nader contributors from 2000, such as Ben Cohen, a co-founder of Ben & Jerry's ice cream, also are organizing "No, Ralph, No" efforts. Some Nader advocates had an epiphany after the 2000 election. Bush beat Gore by 537 votes in Florida, where Nader received 97,488 votes. Nader also arguably cost Gore New Hampshire. Nader always has rejected the spoiler label. "It is not my job to elect my opponents," he has said."

 Last night Sex and the City wrapped into Iron Jawed Angels (slithy HBO!), so I ended up TiVo-ing and watching this movie accidentally. Was it accident, though, or providence? I ask because the movie was amazing. I hadn't even seen a trailer, so I didn't know a thing about it. I just started enjoying the filming, music, and then plot, and then suddenly recognized everything from old history and lit classes in college and realized I was watching a true story, of Alice Paul and the NWP's efforts over eight years to attain for women the right to vote. The movie focused heavily on the legacy of mothers and their daughters. When current events or obstacles made their sacrifices appear too deep, the characters seemed to repeatedly refocus on the beneficiaries of their work: their young girls, and women yet to live. I felt such an emotional connection with their trials, as one of the women who benefits from the progress made by the suffrage movement every day as well as the mother of a baby girl whose benefits will be even more pronounced. I think the message of the movie that also spoke to me, particularly urlLink in this time of political disillusion , was to not become mired in the dichotomy of politics in the US, as presented by Republicans and Democrats. Both are part of the same system, both resist the forces that might change them, either by introducing other parties and therefore lessening their stronghold on power, or by putting social change firmly in the hands of the people rather than the rulers, as in the internet and online commerce. I want to work for change with my life, and I truly believe for maybe the first time that the best way to do that is anyway but American politics. Standing outside of the inner circle of biparty rulership, a circle that never acknowledged my presence anyway, due to my age and gender, I feel free and empowered to really fight for progress. In Alice Paul's time, she was fighting simply for women to join the discussion, to be given a voice in the fight for progress. I can't waste her efforts. She--and the women who stood next to her--burst the paradigm that women were fit simply to mind the home, and couldn't be trusted with important political matters. At the time, such a notion was considered extreme and ridiculous, much as desegregation and civil rights seemed when people like Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King, and on other continents, Nelson Mandela and Steven Biko burst the paradigm that skin color somehow mandated a hierarchy in the human race. What paradigms seem extreme and ridiculous now? I think the notion that a border should somehow mandate whether a child starves or thrives is a good one, as well as the idea that water must be an inalienable human right. Equality not dependent on sexual orientation or religious affiliation seems a no-brainer, but we still haven't gotten it. After watching this movie and feeling so moved by its history and message, I went poking around the web for reviews. Sure enough, somebody didn't like it. The urlLink Orlando Sentinel said : "HBO's latest film strives to make viewers feel fury at the treatment of early 20th-century suffragettes. They faced the public's taunting, endured hunger strikes in prison and challenged President Woodrow Wilson's indifference. But Iron Jawed Angels might make the audience angrier at the filmmakers, who have fumbled a tremendous story through heavy-handed, unfocused storytelling. Director Katja von Garnier has a touch that could be described as throttling." I had to laugh out loud at the drastic culture shift this Hal Boedeker reviewer represented. He must be so far over the hill that he's lost his way! The "unfocused storytelling" was the creative filming that drew me to the film in the first place! The drama was punctuated by a soundtrack rich in modern femmes like Lauren Hill and Sarah McLaughlin, that I guess this guy hasn't heard of. The resulting effect was the first time I'd seen a twenties-era film that made it feel like just a few years ago, with some connection to my present culture. The music and filming were just enough to fill in the gaps I'd always felt separated that distant era from my own. Most other reviews urlLink were more flattering to the movie, but the reviewers still had a nasty tendency to caveat their praise with admonishings against such a modern twist. God forbid we make a movie about women bursting paradigms that actually speaks to women the same age as those who initially burst the paradigms!

 urlLink Southern Baptists Bring New York Their Gospel : "The campaign began with Chicago in 2000 and moved on to Phoenix, Boston, Las Vegas and Miami.

Southern Baptist missionaries began meeting with local church officials two years ago to lay the groundwork for the campaign's official kickoff this year. The denomination is sending at least several hundred volunteers and is spending several million dollars to support the effort, Dr. Reccord said. But New York may also present the ultimate test of the Southern Baptists' evangelism. To many evangelical Christians and more than a few New Yorkers themselves, the city occupies a special place as something close to an American Babylon, perhaps the least Christian and most secular metropolis in the country. 'I don't know if I thought of it as Sin City, but I knew it wasn't the closest place to God,' Mr. Rourk said, diplomatically."

 What cruel irony that on the first sunny day we've seen after a week of heavy, solid rain here in Houston, I don't even want to look at the sunlight through the window. A drink before going out, drinks at dinner, and drinks through the movie (love that at Angelika!) have me still paying the price for Valentines celebrations. We ended up seeing Lost in Translation , which was a fun, quirky trip through Tokyo, but certainly not the movie I'd recommend if you've been drinking. About half way through my buzz fell away and my eyes felt very heavy. I thought about getting a coffee or another drink, but I didn't want to miss whatever we were waiting for when it finally happened. I wish I'd known in advance this was an experience movie, not a something happens movie. It's a funny thing when your friends read your blog. We were out last night with friends Leeward and Marianne, and after dinner but before the movie, Leeward asked if our night out was proving to be sitter worthy! From my point of view, just wearing the sexy new bustier my mom and I found last week was sitter worthy. I felt very Carrie Bradshaw meets Christina Agulera--I let the dangly hose hooks fall over my black pinstripe pants. It was a purplish pink, which showed itself clearly underneath my thin cotten eyelet fitted oxford, as well as through the ample cleavage I gained by not nursing Ella very much yesterday afternoon. But yes, I think the night was sitter worthy. After finding out Marrakech and the Scott Gertner Sky Bar were booked, we decided to go low key with the restaurant and eat at the Hobbit. It was a wise choice, we didn't have to wait for a table at all, and nobody had to eat meat. The movie was good, I had total culture shock from my week in Japan. I think the Revolution will not be Televised might have been a better choice since it is probably more action-packed, while keeping with our desire for frontal lobe stimulation. Plus it's a lot shorter. I'm going to try to go see that sometime soon.

She then called her son-in-law, a lawyer, who then met the assistant, Ann Armstrong, at a restaurant. As Henry Blodget recounts in Slate, Armstrong told the son-in-law that she was in 'a bit of a quandary' about getting the message back because her message-log wasn't backed up on the server. When Armstrong got home that evening, she spoke again to Stewart, who asked her whether she had been able to put the message back in its original form. She explained that she hadn't, because she couldn't remember what the original message was. Ultimately, Armstrong testified, she discovered a copy of the original message on her computer because her computer had crashed and automatically saved everything. Windows to the rescue! If Armstrong had been using a computer which didn't crash, then the message log would never have been backed up, and Stewart would have had to live with her dodgy edit.

Two years ago, I heard Howard Dean speak for the first time. My husband and I said to any friend or family member who would listen: that's the man to beat George Bush. This year, at a Dean event here in Houston, a reporter from Florida came up to John to get his take (20-something white man holding a baby being the standard for such quotes, right?). When he asked John's employer and John answered he was a NASA engineer, I could see the reporter salivate at the paragraph that would lead. This reporter asked John why he was there supporting Dean and John answered that aside from Dean's policy plans, the main thing was that Howard Dean is the best man to beat George Bush. The man did a double take: what? He actually said, "but that's what people say is wrong with him." And John said they're wrong, then. We need a true alternative here. The man sunk. Visibly wilted. Needless to say, John's quotes never made a newspaper printing. Even then, no one really believed in Howard Dean. Maybe Americans, even liberal ones, are afraid of change, afraid of the slimmer regions of the bell curve. I think modern America wouldn't even have voted for Kennedy. The only ones who can make these decisions, like which candidate should get the Democratic party's nomination, are very comfortable in their lives with big houses, big cars, big dogs. Change would only make them feel uncomfortable. That's why we call it the powers that be , instead of the powers that could be . The idealistic youth should be called the powers that will never be . These would be the powers that believe in peaceful international solutions, believe in ending world hunger, believe in true equality regardless of age, race, religion, or sexual orientation. Would be. Blissful thought. Won't be now. The big farce is that the Bush makers have fooled everyone into thinking he's somewhere in the middle too, when he's really a pretty freakish right-wing wacko. He's enacting plenty of changes, and they're all evil bad ones. But I don't want to think about that, because I hate politics now. Politics suck. But still, considering how open and available to the public (through the internet) Dean made himself throughout his campaign, wouldn't it have been great to have had a president who was open and in touch with the country he headed? There I go again with the woulds. Wouldn't it. My efforts for the Dean campaign were wasted because, simply by taking a stand on anything, he was doomed from the start. Poor Dean, he believed most of all. Maybe it's better that the system crushed him now rather than some uncertain future where the power corrupts him instead.

 I fall victim to comfort all too often. Through the past months, I considered switching over to typepad a number of times, and in the end I always decided against it because I love my BlogThis button and because blogger is so comfy. So, when I switched over to Macintosh, I was pretty disturbed to find my blogthis button no longer linked, nor did my blogger interface! Not only did Safari and Explorer (for Macs) use a really awkward version of blogger, but gone too were the italics and bold buttons. After a few days of failed attempts to resolve this, I was left with the thought that I would have to code my own links and formats when I blogged from now on. I told John how much this troubled me, and since he's been a fantastic champion of the Mac for forever, he was determined to make my hurt better. Sure enough, John found the open source (something else he champions) browser Firefox, which treated all my blogger aps appropriately! I'm so pleased! Considering that the Mac culture made Google what it is today, and the considerable geeky fervor with which Mac fans attack inequities, I have to say I'm utterly shocked that the Google toolbar and blogger's interface were so unfriendly to the Mac software. Firefox may eventually prove itself to have shortcomings in other places, but for now, I am eternally grateful to the developers of this little browser! Now that everything is as it should be, it seems a little silly to have been so caught up in my little tool buttons. But I've grown up in this button-based Windows world, literally. My brain has grown in such a direction, that it thinks better when the buttons are there. Moreover, my computer is an extension of my creative self in the most intimate way. When things don't feel familiar, I feel creatively stymied. The flow is halted. And nothing makes me grumpier than not having a free flowing creative outlet. Fortunately, my brain is still malleable enough that I could make the switch from one computer to the other. I already think of the old Vaio, once my beloved external lobe, as the ugly stepchild on my desk. I'll be happy when we've switched all the files over (having some difficulty with the music files, everything else seems to have gone well--especially photos. I love iphotos!) and I can secure my bond with the 'tosh.

 The other day when my dad was visiting, he laughed out loud as he watched me channel hop back and forth between Ellen and Sharon while nursing Ellie.

My mother only would have had Donahue or Love Boat reruns to entertain her days. I'm so sad to hear about urlLink Sharon getting axed . She deserves better. The show was out of the box, and it was pretty obvious from day one that her producers weren't loose enough to go with it. She's MTV and they're network. It was a marriage destined for divorce. My truest hope is that MTV or some other cable channel will pick her up. There needs to be a daytime venue for seeing Marilyn Manson's paintings and hearing Carmen Electra's favorite sex position (who would have thought she'd be a missionary girl! Dave said it's because that's the way she has to do the least amount of work). I know a lot of people home in the daytime are yuppie View types, but I feel like a lot more of us are young MTV fans. The timing was bad too. Ellen came out, just as funny and anti-View at the same time. And apparently the networks are having a little bloodlust when it comes to renewals. Read this: urlLink TelevisionWeek -- Incorporating Electronic Media : "frankly I can't remember this many shows being cancelled this close to the market.'

 urlLink You Can Make It With Plato - Bush's difficult relationship with reality. By William Saletan : "...This big-picture notion of reality, existence, and the world as it is dates back 2,400 years to the Greek philosopher Plato. Plato believed that what's real isn't the things you can touch and see: your computer, your desk, those empty barrels in Iraq that Bush thought were full of chemical weapons. What's real is the general idea of these things. The idea of a computer. The idea of a desk. The idea of an Iraqi threat to the United States. Whether you actually have a computer or a desk, or whether Saddam Hussein actually had chemical weapons, is less important than the larger truth. The abstraction is the reality. Plato's successor, Aristotle, took a different view. He thought reality was measured by what you could touch and see. That's the definition of reality on which modern science was founded. It's the definition Colin Powell used when he told the world Saddam had weapons of mass destruction. It's the definition David Kay used when he set out to find the weapons. Kay and Powell are dismayed by our inability to see and touch the weapons. But Bush isn't. He isn't going to let Aristotle's reality distract him from Plato's..."

 urlLink Guardian Unlimited | The Guardian | Year of the blonde bitch : "Women, to paraphrase David Brent, the most popular philosopher of our time, are not always all that easy to get a grip on. Long ago in the winter of 2003, it looked like this year would be a jolly nice time to be a woman - or, at least, a girly girl. The discernible fashion trends from designers for summer 2004 were frothy, frilly dresses, and everything else in colours as sugar sweet as a pick 'n' mix counter, floral patterns scattered about willy-nilly. Sure, this would be tricky for the high street to copy (aside from the occasional fantastic Marc Jacobsesque jacket, mass retailers are understandably better at Girls Aloud-alike pelmet skirts than Great Gatsby-style one-off dresses), but it would be perfect, we were told, for that secret layer of femininity that allegedly lurks inside women across the land, just waiting to be unearthed from beneath all those Ugg boots and hipster jeans. Ideal, in other words, for women like me who, in the deepest part of their soul, didn't think Barbara Cartland was such a bad dresser. Simply smashing, for those of us who would still be playing with Barbie dolls and My Little Ponys if it was socially acceptable. Oh yeah, this was going to be my year. Yet something has gone wrong. Maybe it's a feminine whim, maybe it's just the weather, but somehow, things haven't quite followed the plan. The fact is, all that girly-twirliness (a style I had long championed anyway, despite urgings to the contrary from friends and colleagues) is already looking a bit irrelevant, as tired as a wilting daisy. Instead, I find myself possessed by the urge to dye my hair platinum blonde (and wasn't brunette supposed to be very in this year?), hoik myself into a micro-mini and halter top (replete with Gossard, naturally), and to punctuate snappy one-liners with clicks from my stiletto heels.

 How romantic to sit on the couch this fine Saturday and be fed slightly raw chocolate chip cookies by my husband... except that he fed me because my hands were full of a nearly asleep nursing baby! I'm not complaining though. Later, while testing out the new sound system mix on our NEW MACS!, the whole family burst into spontaneous wild dancing through the house for almost half an hour! Somewhere along the way I cought my reflection in the window and I realized true happiness is having someone in the world who loves you so very much that when they see you dancing like a mamed turkey, they just feel glad that you're having so much fun. Either we've seriously harmed our children's psyches by exposing them to such horror as their parents truly bad dancing, or we've taught them to let go and feel the music nomatter how bad they look. Only time will tell which.

 not really, I did it for me. But in so far as experiencing wild new experiences helps your brain grow new synapses, I'm sure growing a lot of new synapses right now! I still trust in the system. I believe that Apple has inherently better design, and my inability to navigate this new design reflects a weakness in me--a weakness honed by years of Windows use. And I believe that Apple's design is so intuitive that before very long at all, I'll be thanking my lucky stars for all the engineers and software developers at Apple who thought of these amazing tools that right now, in this temporary moment, are driving me just a little batty. In my brain, this feels like your first day in a foreign country when things are so different that you feel slightly annoyed that the whole world isn't American. You have to keep reminding yourself that American is simply most familiar, not best. You dig down deep to smash that paradigm, and within a day or two it works! You like--even celebrate--the differences, you appreciate the approach from a separate direction than your own, especially regarding the beer. I degress. I've been abroad enough times to know this brain buzz is only temporary, and it doesn't mean I should give up. I'm happiest that the system our children will feel most comfortable with is the Mac. They'll learn Windows soon enough in school, thanks to Bill Gates timely software donations. I do, however, really need someone to answer for me whether the messed up blogger interface with no spellcheck or html link button is a product of my Mac changeover, or Blogger's weekend difficulties.

 I don't know, but on Apples, they all go to the left instead! And that's just one of the many things I'm enjoying about my two new beautiful Macs! That's right, today I made the big switch to Macintosh after a lifetime of IBMs with not one, but two new computers! It's all Microcenter's fault for having such an amazing deal. We bought a 17 inch iMac G4 and a 12 inch ibook for just under $2K. We had planned initially to replace my two-year-old Sony Vaio with something and hand it down to to the kids. Aidan's games never could run on his four year old desktop clunker he got for his birthday last year. Between SesameStreet.com (better games than sesamestreet.org) and his movies, he always spent his computer time on my Vaio anyway. At $800, the cute little ibook offerred us the opportunity to rear them on Macs nearly from their first days, and we'll try to sell the Vaio on ebay to offset our big decision there. The new computers are impressive in form and function. I love that we've made the switch, even if it's a little intimidating. I keep forgetting to go left! And what do you do instead of right click? I feel confident that the differences are intuitive, and soon they'll be instinctive. I'm going to really enjoy taking this little ibook to Kraftsmen Bakery and writing at a table under the giant oak trees next to the library!

Does Japan, in short, want to compete with the world's great powers? The review resulted from recent failures of Japan's space program, but perhaps Japan was also reacting viscerally to actions taken by the two nations that have most shaped its history. The United States has said it will send astronauts to the Moon and to Mars, reiterating its intention of staying No. 1. And China launched a man into space three months ago, becoming only the third nation to do so, after the former Soviet Union and the United States, and announcing its resolve to become a global power. How to deal with the rise or re-emergence of China as a great power will very likely be the biggest foreign policy issue facing Japan over the next generation.

 We made it! I think all the bad love I got from the universe this last week was just one big punctuation mark on the year that ran Feb. 1, 2003-Feb 1, 2004. Now that it's past, I feel as if the last year has been one long dream, the kind where you run and run and never get there. The Space Shuttle Columbia's memorials yesterday were really touching. I cried during the one CBS ran mid-afternoon, in which they interviewed the families that came to Houston for the game (I really wished they'd tried to get at least a statement from the others). The families were invited to the Super Bowl as the personal guests of NFL Commissioner Tagliboo. Up until yesterday, I'd been a little bitter that the Super Bowl would overshadow any events here in Houston memorializing the tragedy, but yesterday I realized the Super Bowl brought the event to the attention of every Super Bowl fan in the country, where before just Houstonians would have taken notice. When Columbia launched, I was still pregnant with Eleanor. I watched tensely at home with my parents and John watched from NASA-JSC. We were all so relieved that this high profile supposed terrorist threat (due to Ilan's Israeli nationality) went off without a hitch. A few years ago, we all would have watched the launch together from JSC's Teague Auditorium. Before 9/11, families were always invited to launch events, we all celebrated together the achievement our collective hard work and sacrifices accomplished. On that terrible Saturday a year ago, I was sleeping in with my newborn daughter in my arms, and John was on the computer enjoying his morning reading. My parents had returned home, we were adjusting to our newly normal life as a family of four. Our neighbor Ron came to the door to tell John something was wrong with the space shuttle, and John ran in (the TV was in the bedroom, we were in recovery mode still) to turn on CNN. All he said was "the shuttle's off radar." I remember sitting up in bed and watching the first terrible shots of the falling debris and feeling my heart chill. My mind buzzed with the new knowledge that our lives would forever be changed by the sights I took in. I tried to imagine what the families were doing at that moment, we knew they would be immediately escorted from the bleachers to a preselected private location. Astronauts, also preselected, would be comforting them and explaining the technical scenarios underway. When I used to watch the launches in Teague, I learned quickly not to clap at liftoff. Everyone there is intimately familiar with the levels of risk at each stage of flight, and the highest risk doesn't drop until the twin boosters separate from the shuttle many seconds in. Everyone in the crowd, mindful of the one time the shuttle didn't clear that risky stage, holds their breath and wills the ship upward. Finally, a release! of boosters and breath, cheers erupt and the capcom wishes the crew a safe flight. From that moment on, I know the families weren't totally relaxed--how could they be until they embraced their loved ones again--but I think they let their guards down. What a cruel irony then, that the moments when they felt relief creeping in their hearts, waiting only for the final sonic boom to forshadow the shuttle's return, were the moments in which their loved ones died.

Yuck. As a person who grew up in a small hick town, I do understand the wild high walking in a WalMart can impart. But please, just say no. Every labor day I find friends who tell me they support labor, but it's not like we need unions as much these days, thanks to the amazing progress unions already accomplished: weekends, minimum wage, maximum work day, minimum work age, etc. I always try to tell them what a slippery slope it could be back to the horrible working conditions of pre-union America, if we only stop believing in the value of labor. WalMart's practices are illustrating my point perfectly well. As consumers, we have power over market practices only if we make principled decisions over where to spend our dollars. As a country, let's all make a conscious decision to boycott Walmart and the other WalMart-owned corp, Sams. Target and internet shopping together offer good alternatives to the former. Cosco and internet shopping offer alternatives to the latter. Let's effect change. Be disciplined next time you're tempted to buy something from either WalMart or Sams.

 urlLink Come Back, Little Deaniacs : "Unfortunately, the nearly inevitable conclusion of these first heady forays into presidential campaigning is political heartbreak. 'Don't you lose some essence of life when you really can't give your heart?' asked Kate DeBolt, an 18-year-old Floridian who says she could 'go to the ends of the earth' for Dr. Dean. Her candidate is still very much in the race, and his campaign's pioneer work with the Internet is going to transform grass-roots politics. But ever since the Iowa returns, his more innocent followers have been grappling with the shock of discovering that it is possible to be pure of heart, fired with dedication, and still lose overwhelmingly. Many of the young people who heeded Senator McCarthy's antiwar message in 1968 spiraled away from politics forever when Hubert Humphrey won the Democratic nomination. The young Deaniacs could easily add to the near majority of eligible voters in America who find politics a waste of effort. One of the most important missions of the Democratic nominee this year is to help keep young people interested when the campaign boils down to the deeply pragmatic politics of the summer and fall. "

"For example, beliefs in heaven and hell might affect those traits by creating perceived rewards and punishments that relate to `good' and `bad' lifetime behavior."

 Dear MoveOn member, The CBS networks still refuses to run our winning ad in the Bush in 30 Seconds ad contest during the Super Bowl. The MoveOn.org non-partisan campaign to get CBS to air issue ads continues, but we're not going to let CBS's censorship stop us in the mean time. That's why we're spending over $1 million to air the ad in our swing states and nation-wide on other channels -- starting with two spots on CNN that will air during the Super Bowl half time. This Sunday, during the Super Bowl half time show, join us in changing channels on CBS. At 8:10pm and 8:35pm EST, switch over to CNN to watch "Child's Pay" on a channel which doesn't censor its ads. We'd like to keep a tally of the number of people who participate -- you can sign up here: http://www.moveonvoterfund.org/boycott/?id=2293-2663618-qw3V19.IXLXF635KANqqqQ The number of groups, individuals, and newspapers that have called on CBS to run our ad is remarkable. The National Organization for Women and the American Civil Liberties Union have asked their own members to call CBS. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) gave a powerful speech about CBS on the floor of the Senate, saying, "Maybe network executives at CBS are so afraid of political pressure from the right wing and their business advertisers who are in league with the right wing politics of America that they are afraid to put anything on the air that might in fact make things uncomfortable. If that is the case, it is time for CBS to announce the name of their network is the 'Conservative Broadcasting System' and come clean with American viewers." 28 members of the House of Representatives wrote a letter to CBS which stated, "The choice not to run this paid advertisement appears to be part of a disturbing pattern on CBS's part to bow to the wishes of the Republican National Committee. We remember well CBS's remarkable decision this fall to self-censor at the direction of GOP pressure. The network shamefully cancelled a broadcast about former President Ronald Reagan which Republican partisans considered insufficiently flattering." Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) wrote a separate letter to CBS urging them to reconsider their decision. Today, the L.A. Times printed an Op-Ed piece of ours which lays out the case against CBS's censorship. That's attached below. But the editorial pages of the Boston Globe, San Francisco Chronicle, and many other papers came out in our favor as well. As the Globe wrote, "MoveOn.org's 30-second ad, which has aired on CNN, is a gentle yet powerful depiction of how hard today's children will have to work to pay off the country's mounting deficit. That's a vital message that might get lost in a year of campaign rhetoric, and it deserves a response from the White House in its own 30 seconds of imagery. America, sitting on the couch, junk food in hand, just might sit up and want to know more." Luckily, there are still some networks that do allow the free exchange of ideas. Please join the one-minute boycott: at Super Bowl halftime, switch to CNN and watch "Child's Pay," and let us know at: http://www.moveonvoterfund.org/boycott/?id=2293-2663618-qw3V19.IXLXF635KANqqqQ Thanks for all you do, --Adam, Carrie, Eli, James, Joan, Laura, Noah, Peter, Wes, and Zack The MoveOn.org Team January 30th, 2003

 urlLink The Onion A.V. Club | Feature | March 24, 2004 : "March 17, 11:26 p.m. Excellent New York City comedian Eugene Mirman is no stranger to opening for rock bands, but his current stint touring with Modest Mouse can't have prepared him for the challenge of telling jokes on stage at SXSW. It's hard enough to warm up drunken rock fans without the benefit of music; doing so when said drunken rock fans are loudly networking and catching up on old times qualifies Mirman for some sort of combat medal. Note to the guy yelling 'David Cross!' at Eugene Mirman: David Cross would hate you."

 urlLink The Onion A.V. Club | Say Something Funny | March 24, 2004 : "I am always uncomfortable when men I do not know comment on physical attributes of women both of us do not know. For example, just the other day, I was in an elevator with two strangers. One woman. One man. The woman arrived at her destination. Doors open. Doors shut, leaving me and the gentleman. He turns to me and says, 'Did you see those tits? Looks like she shoved a roll of paper towels up there.' I was tempted to play along with it and say, 'More like a yoga mat.' Or maybe add to the paper-towel reference with, 'Man I would like to dry off with her boobs. The Brawny guy wishes he had a chest like that, I bet.' And then we would both high-five until he got off the elevator and went to work at whatever mutual-fund company he worked for. I assume that a guy like that is looking for a bonding moment between two men, so maybe it will lead to us exchanging business cards. Or maybe that's the way the NRA started. I don't know. Instead, I just looked at my shoes and mumbled to myself so he could hear, 'Girls are pretty awesome.' He glanced at me. No, he just plain stared at me. Then I said, 'You should see my mother's boobs.' This confused him, and he got to his floor and exited the elevator. I thought about high-fiving myself, but instead just mumbled, 'Did you see that ass?' Then I high-fived myself."

 that was my giant conclusion in commenting on Julie Leung's blog. Why can't technology have a social value? No, I must rephrase b/c I believe technology's chief value is social. Why can't technology's social value be recognized and applauded? In my world, the highest form of praise is recognition by academia. Now that this conference at Harvard Law is wholly ignoring all things social, I'm so dissed. Worse dissed than when that K School rejected me (I know what you're thinking, maybe it's b/c I saw things like worse dissed. And it was Policy, not Law). No wonder this country can't get girls to go into technology. The general premise of the the field is so BORING, that only a mind-numbed boy could find interest in the field. OK, that was cheap and shallow. Did I mention I'm dissed? Anyway, here's what Julie said that was right on point for the social value of blogs: urlLink Seedlings & Sprouts: Saving my sanity : "I think I'd be insane without the Internet at this stage of life. Some days, especially if the children are ill, the only people I see face-to-face are other Leungs: three little ones and Ted. I don't know how I would survive without the social and emotional support I receive through my on-line community. Email has become invaluable to me. The ability to communicate with friends far away sustained me through our difficult move and transition to island life. I don't use the phone much. Real-time conversation is complicated by my three little children. But the convenience of email fits well into these busy years. My friends and I can read and write to each other at whatever hour we choose, typing in moments caught here and there, between doing dishes and burping babies. Email is easier than picking up the phone, or getting dressed and out the door. Even though many of my friends are distant, we can write and keep connected. I probably spend at least an hour a day working on email. I'm also learning to make new friends on-line. This year I've joined a few yahoo groups and I've started to get to know some other moms through these dialogues. Two local support groups for homeschoolers have been especially helpful. Blogging has introduced me to many people. I started only months ago but already I feel I have friends - even though we've never met face-to-face. It's been fun to explore new social circles. Ted and I were able to make it to one Seattle Webloggers Meetup and I am looking forward to meeting more bloggers in flesh and blood. I find that blogging provides daily support but personal email is, at this point for me, more intense and effective; perhaps explained by the length of time I've invested in my email friends as compared to blogging."

 Anna Bahney for the NYT gets two bonus points in the publishing of this article: 1) for finally recognizing what's been a crazy, fantastic urban sport for a few years now, and 2) for actually writing the word balletically . How'd her editor let that get by? Maybe he thought it was more of this hip urban stuff he doesn't get anyway. Seriously though, this makes me love youth. I hope Aidan's cool enough to do this. The other day we were walking on the UNM campus and a skate board flew by. I saw the lust in his eyes. At three, he already mastered his scooter. He'll need the board soon. The next step will be the realization that his body can go where the board can't. urlLink New Way for Teenagers to See if They Bounce : "Leaping onto the steps' metal handrails, Ben scampered upward, grasped the ledge of the walkway above him with a hop and shinnied up the wall. Parkour is a potent temptation for suburban teenagers: it's cheap and a little risky, and it requires an occasional brush with authority. Just as a passer-by stopped to ask what the boys were doing, a park ranger interrupted. 'Whatever you call it,' she said, 'you can't practice it here.' With neither retort nor apology, the clans picked up their jackets and moved on, undeterred, hurdling waist-high cement blockades on their way to the next destination."

 Today's NYT has a great article on Dr. Gerald Edelman, a neuroscientiest and Nobel Laureate. His views on the nature of science funding alone are ground breaking, but wait until you read about what he sees as the true nature of brain organization. I love it for its non-linear focus. I've often thought if most cultures of the world are not linear thinkers, surely the brain and/or body doesn't behave by the linear logic western medicine assumes. urlLink The Brain? It's a Jungle in There : "But Dr. Edelman sees the Darwinian idea and its biological working out as essential aspects of his theory and necessarily difficult. The brain will always have more going on than seems necessary, more randomness and variation than any humanly designed system. There is enormous redundancy (which Dr. Edelman refers to as "degeneracy") in the brain's functioning, giving it remarkable resilience and evolutionary possibilities. No brain event happens the same way twice. Even memory is always a variant, he says — a re-creation, never a repetition. Using such ideas, Dr. Edelman and his colleagues have been creating primitive Darwinian neural universes: robots that "learn" to avoid objects and pick up others, not because of a preset program of rules, but because of how various "neuronal groups and paths" are strengthened by experience — mirroring, perhaps, the way an infant might gradually learn to grasp objects or distinguish among them. Of course, it's a long way between this and even simple consciousness, but in Dr. Edelman's view, similar principles are at work. What, for example, does it take to recognize an object? Stimulations spurred by the color red and others by the shape sphere must be coordinated before a red ball is recognized. But such coordination doesn't require a manager. These first stimulations may trigger other stimulations that associate the earlier ones with one another; in turn, these groups of neurons become elements in ever more intricate mappings. Patterns evolve and interact in a dizzying dynamic. The brain is not a logically structured organ; these processes of connection resemble the processes of metaphor more than those of logic. Eventually, consciousness is a consequence of these neural mappings.... "These theories are part of what Dr. Edelman hopes will become "sciences of recognition," studying how biological processes recognize other biological processes. It is an enterprise, he argues, that spurs amazement, because if it succeeds, it will show that out of accident and diversity, something as miraculous as human consciousness can be born. But this vision can also spur discomfort, because it implies that there is no supervising soul or self — nobody is standing behind the curtain. This, for Dr. Edelman, is Darwin's final burden."

 urlLink Yahoo! News - Fructose Sweetener Linked to Obesity Rise : "The debate over high-fructose sweeteners centers on how the body processes sugar. Unlike glucose, a major component in table sugar, fructose doesn't trigger responses in hormones that regulate energy use and appetite. That means fructose is more likely to be converted into fat, the researchers said. The sweeteners are also cheaper to produce and use in food manufacturing than cane and beet sugars, the study noted." (this last line's misleading, it's only cheaper b/c the gov. subsidizes corn production)

 Turns out burglars weren't the only invaders our little house saw last week. The ants and spiders came, too! A few times a year in Houston, something about the weather or seasons clicks and bugs suddenly are everywhere you look inside your home. We've been through this enough times, and have discussed this with enough neighbors, to know time alone--not pesticides--will alleviate this situation. But bugs and burglars have their good sides, too. The ants encourage us all to put the dishes right into the dishwasher, or else that dish will be swarmed in an hour as the little ants signal their buddies to crawl up to the counter for the big feast. I keep the floors swept of baby crumbs so that Ellie doesn't go probing a black ball, only to have it explode in tiny ants onto her skin. Btw, we've discovered a circle of duck tape wrapped around your hand, sticky-side-out is the best way to clean a swarm. The burglars urged me into a strange variant of the spring cleaning bug. I found myself spending my forty-five minutes of Ellie's nap-time scouring the fridge yesterday. It's so beautiful! During our drive home from El Paso, I went over things I was worried were stolen. I realized I'd made a list of the objects in my home I should keep, and everything else I should get rid of. But will I? When we arrived, I was a little disappointed to see certain objects still here: the nordic track, John's scooter, my dishes. Our friend, Neal, told us about his new favorite program, which forces people to get rid of half or three quarters of the stuff cluttering their lives. I guess I'd hoped the burglary would be kind of like that for us. Since it wasn't, and since I've recognized all this, I'm on a mission to reduce crap. I want simplicity!

 Or, are some girls just catty all the time? Getting into social situations with catty girls may just be my freudian old brain issue, because it sure seems like it keeps coming up as a big conflict in my life. Then, I'm left with that everyone but me is crazy corollary: that it's not me, it's them. And it does seem that every woman (save a few priceless encounters) can't resist jockeying for position in conversation, or shooting darts veiled by wit at dinner parties. It makes me feel so tired. This is clearly the negative side to anthropologist Sarah Blaffer Hrdy's research conclusion that women's social actions are a remnant of primitive life, where a woman's social standing determined her children's survival in the group. We're all trying to hard because our primitive brain's demand it. We must get lovely quick doses of brain drugs in reward for social triumphs, just as men's brains reward them for displays of brawn. But men have progressed as a gender (for the most part) beyond walking around beating each other up. They seem to be able to exist in social environments with no clear alpha. Why can't we women put away the medula oblongata, ourselves? Maybe these men have successful taught their brains that monetary acquisition rather than physical victory determines their children's success? We don't exactly "teach" our old brain things. A newly expressed behavior (in this case, a trend toward social interaction among otherwise physically overbearing men) must make surviving so advantageous that the genes that set the conditions for that behavior are spread so much more that they infiltrate the population. On one hand, this seems unlikely because wealth is not an indicator of big families these days, rather the inverse. But on the other, I'm considering wealth on modern American terms. Wealth in global terms, over the course of the last four or so centuries certainly has a lower bar. If you can count employable in any labor field as wealth, and overbearing brawn makes one unemployable (not to mention unmarriable), I can actually see those genes losing out. So maybe men have evolved! In Hrdy's research, she points to the social structure of chimp groups, such as the one inhabited by Jane Goodall's famous "F" family. Flo was able to dominate the other women with social prowess, and achieved an amazing triumph of dynasty by cleverly positioning her daughter, Fifi, as her successor. Therefore, first Flo's children, and then Fifi's were fed most and groomed most by the other chimps, and watched after when the mom was acquiring food. Food, love, and protection here are the determiners for a baby chimp's thriving. (Two of Flo's sons also endured brief reigns as male alpha, but out of brute might. She probably also spread her genetically social-developed code here, because the extra love and care made her sons big and healthy enough to dominate--socially and sexually.) Hrdy herself observed Maquaques, and compared her research to the general primate field of knowledge to extrapolate that social ambition must be tied to nurturing instincts in females. Can I then further extrapolate that I'm sensing so very much cattiness in my life right now because I'm over sensitive to it as an uber-nurturing mama? Or even that my mostly parent-filled social group is a snakeden of positioning efforts? Now that I consider it all, even the women I have seen this in who aren't moms are in the baby-bug phase, which would be one's body building up the hormones and nurturing desires necessary for a baby's survival. They too must be biologically driven to be catty.

 here she is going off on the all too chipper discussion over at drweil.com re. menopause: urlLink Pastor Ellen's blog: Yes, I Am...A Liberal Evangelical : "...My clothes, mattress, and car upholstery are all salt-stained from the massive streams of sweat that have poured from my body since the hot flashes and night sweats kicked in.

Estrogen, no? Oh my gosh, if a man had to endure this, we'd have all the drugs the pharmaceutical industry could throw at us (albeit some really bad TV commercials to tout them)! And what about that monthly visit from my grandmother? I endured that little inconvenience for 35 years along with all the other girls, believing that the best thing about it was that it got me out of P.E. class now and again. But now that my little friend isn't visiting so often, I am curiously sad. Yes, she was a messy guest...just like my teenagers. But I missed them when they left, too! Yeah, yeah, I know Dr. W says we'll feel much better about the whole thing if we exercise, eat well, get plenty of rest, and supplement with B12 & soy....but every now and again it's good therapy to just tell it like it is!

 It occurred to me this morning--not for the first time--that Madeline Albright should be president. Now that Arnold's reopened that old citizenship box, I really think she should do it. If Kerry is looking for a good, strong VP, she's his gal, and it could position her well for a presidential bid, whether or not they win. Plus, I really want a she-dem nomination before a she-republican so if anyone can pull the mom vote for the sake of feminine unity, it's the dems. I actually heard a republican friend say he hoped Condie Rice would run at least as a VP in upcoming years, and it put the fear of God into me. Of course, none of this is the point of the testimonies. Just what is the point continues to elude me. I'm left to assume it's to create a diverse set of soundbites to chose from for the upcoming season of political ads. Dr. Rice's absense alone prohibits it from being a clear evaluation of the contributing factors for 9/11 it proclaims. Madeline speaking so close to Powell refreshed my memory on just how terrible it was when the Bush White House appointed an entire administration out of the military. Between the two testimonies, the clearest difference I could hear was the "General" dropping by Colin compared to Albright's diverse cast of supporters. I really want to read her book, btw. I've always considered her a hero of sorts since she was a woman who raised children (for at least some years as a single mom) while beginning her career, and still achieved such esteemed positions. Colin Powell distinguished himself from the rest of the Bush White House in a significant way this morning. His analogies for the clear dichotomy of white hats vs. black hats in that simplistic world order pulled from Greek mythology instead of the usual namestays from the Judeo-Christian religions. For example, where a true Bush insider would have stayed on the anti-Christian ideological talking points, Colin used the Greek god Hydra to introduce terrorism in his monologue. He always has been the shining star in that cabinet. *gag me!*

 Our first break-in occurred while we were in El Paso for Thanksgiving. The ironic thing at the time was that we hadn't even intended to leave town. But I miscarried our sweet Grace, and just wanted to be away from work and life that at about 7 p.m. on the Tuesday before T-day, 2002, I told John I wanted to go and he proceeded to load the car within an hour and we left. Today's long drive from El Paso to Houston, knowing we would be returning to a broken-into house, was reminiscent of that trip two and a half years ago. I remembered that then I threw up the whole way. I've been pregnant enough times on that drive though that all the throw-up along I-10 memories kind of congeal. The funny thing is we never felt all the feelings people say you feel about a break-in. We never felt violated. I remember a weaker moment in which I hoped the thieves tripped over a cord that everyone trips over here. But other than that, we just thought it was a crappy, but random thing. I've always wondered if we experienced it that way because we were too busy grieving Grace to think of our things, but now I know we just aren't programmed that way. This time, too, no sense of violation. I'm annoyed, because I have a feeling I know who it was--some neighbors whose house seems to have turned into a prostitution ring all of a sudden. I'm pretty worried our insurance will drop us now that we've been broken into twice. But tonight, walking into the house, it still felt like my home, just a little banged up. We felt the first break-in freed us from a dependence upon things. Already anti-materialistic in theory, we were mandated into the ideology when our most precious materials were taken. The promise ring my bio-dad gave my mom when they were sixteen, the promise ring John gave me when we were eighteen. My class ring, and the little turquoise necklace my mom gave me that she herself bought on the Santa Fe plaza as a teenager. Those will never be replaced. But aside from that, we happily replaced our stuff with the insurance money. We found out we had the right kind of home insurance just by luck. There are two kinds, replacement value and full cost replacement. You want the latter. Tonight, I put my babies to bed, and lit a sage stick and went through a purifying run of the house more elaborately than I even knew how to do. But it was just enough ceremony to give me my feeling of a safe and secure home. I asked God to clean my house. Of course, in the morning, I have to really clean my house! Those jerks stepped on my prettiest, softest white sheets with muddy shoes! I think they're ruined. At least they left the duvet, the last guys took it!

 Tonight is the last of the blissful vacation, including the end of ignorance of the condition of my broken-into home back in Houston and the end of the lovely carseat interment for my children. Tomorrow night we'll be in Houston, dealing with reality. Just as bloggers have the blogosphere and the RW, vacationers have to deal with the RW, too. My relatives always ask us why we don't just move back to New Mexico since we love it so very much. And we do love it, I think it's among the four or five amazing places in the world that truly renew one's spirit by virtue of physical beauty and unknown forces of nature--including Nepal, Cinque Terra in Italy, and the Paraquay. They always say that John could work at Los Alamos National Labs, and we say but he works for NASA! They don't get it. In New Mexico, NASA is a far away institution that may or may not matter, but still pales in comparison to living in New Mexico. They don't think of work in terms of peaceful vs. military funding, but rather as enough work to pay the bills and buy a little beer. For us, work is the biggest expression of one's ideals outside family. We tell ourselves that this state is so amazing, we would only think about being there if we lived there. We wouldn't care about saving the world anymore. I find this to be true with our most recent dealings with urlLink Greater World . It's far better for us to use New Mexico medicinally, treating our burn-out and homesickness, and continue our lives' endeavor. It's a strange brand of martyrdom, but it works for our little family.

 The organizers of BloggerCon II urlLink published the schedule for day one of the conference and then urlLink invited commentary on the blank spaces. You know about my stump, so I had to contribute to the discussion. Now that I think about it, they neglected blogging in the classroom, too. Anyway, here's my part: I've felt the parameters of this conference really neglect two critical uses of blogs: social commentary and social outlet. Together these two areas represent a general lack of attention to the social sciences that I tend to be sensitive to as an anthropologist. Perhaps a desire to make blogs matter in the RW is behind our lack of recognition as bloggers of social commentary. But what is a blog if not a mirror of the world right now alongside a little witty commentary and personal affectation? Social critique is a little highbrow for the term, but is the most apt term I've found for blogs since reading an anthropology text from the early 90s titled Ethnography as Social Critique. It discusses the value of a society mirroring itself and attempting to apply the reflective lense to enough of a degree that we might learn something about who we are and where we're heading. Maybe because the planners are lucky enough to be presented with plenty of RW social outlets every day, they don't realize the amazing lifeline blogs represent to those of us that don't get the opportunity every day to interact with others in the RW. This is personal because I'm a work-at-home mom, for others (stay-at-home moms, other work-at-homers for various causes, medical shut-ins--mental or physical) the isolation is just as painful, and blogging is just as helpful. Women represent the majority of bloggers, and mom-blogs are clearly a contributing cause. Ignoring this valuable social function of blogs is a clear disservice.

 I was so happy to be blogging about my anniversary this morning that I forgot all about the other special event of today! A year ago, right here in Taos, I started my blog! I moved over here to Blogger in September, so there's a bit of a split in time. And I swore that I would finish transfering over the archive before this day came, but time does what it will. I can't say how grateful I am for this little social development called blogging. One friend shared with me recently how blogging changed her life. She said she never would have had the courage to leave her abuser husband if it weren't for blogging and she probably would have been so desperate and alone that she would have committed suicide. I'm fortunate to not be facing such dire living conditions, but I will say that the isolation of being a modern work-at-home mom makes Feminest Mistique look like a nursery rhyme. If I watch one more soap opera or talk show to fill that desperate void, I think I'll scream! Aside from rescuing my sanity, blogging has done wonders for my writing. I think it clears the pipes. Like drano, only not all toxic. Like a coat hanger. Since beginning my blog(s), my writing in every genre has prolifferated. I feel so fluid with my thought-to-keyboard connection. I have to go before I can fully appreciate this day, but know how happy I am for today!

 Happy day, indeed. This morning the bright, fresh sunlight shed in the windows and solar panels that are the south-facing wall of our Earthship and woke the whole family up to greet the dawn. Those beautiful rays were so welcome that I wasn't even groggy from that early hour, which I haven't seen since we stayed in the Harris Earthship! John leaned over Ellie and kissed me on the cheek and said happy anniversary. What a dear. On this day, nine years ago, we had our first date. We were both Freshmen in college. Like this year, UTEP had a great basketball team and I shared my post-season tickets with him. Afterward, we went to Hudson's on Mesa in El Paso and talked for hours. I remember not being able to stop smiling as I looked across the table. So today, we begin our tenth year! I can't wait! We've had nine fantastic, adventure-filled years. These years have seen the highest joys and the lowest sorrows of my life. My two beautiful children Aidan and Ella and my sweet Grace who I miscarried come first to my mind. Day before yesterday we got a call informing us that our house had been broken into back at home. I didn't even care about the stuff, I was just upset that it was disturbing my urlLink extraordinary time here . We had someone board it up, and we're carrying on with this celebration of our years together. Last night Greg came over for dinner, what a treat! My cousin is a doctoral student in Physics at UT Austin and he's here for spring break. For just the evening, we all felt like we never left New Mexico and we were just enjoying the family and companionship that is normal life here. Today, we're off to Santa Fe to visit one of the kids' three sets of grandparents, my bio dad and step-mom. They're planning to babysit so John and I can go out tonight. I bought the sexiest shirt yesterday here in Taos, and am looking forward to wearing it! Wherever you are tonight, lift your green beer for our tenth year! Happy St. Patty's Day!

 We made it. Last night we topped the long windy highway through Embudo canyon just as the sun was singing the finale of a haleluia chorus in the sky. It was more beautiful than anything I've ever seen in my life. Snow was falling from whispy clouds that gathered around Taos Mountain, and Wheeler Peak behind it. As the sun hit the clouds, they looked on fire with little sparks falling toward the mountains. For many of the native cultures that live around this area, the Gods live on the mountain peaks, and last night as I watched the sky dance in life around me, I was certain they were right. John and I could feel a pull as we got closer. Fourteen hours never felt so long. Don't get me wrong, we LOVE driving in the car. Sometimes we joke to people who scoff at traveling with kids that we would take the carseats in the house at the end of the trips because we miss their magic. Our kids have a perfect "carseat" relationship. As long as they're out of arm's reach (for too rough play, hitting, or pulling), they share wonderfully, entertain eachother endlessly. We've also noticed that raising chidren here is so much easier. They're so content to play. And without the noises of the city to fill their ears, within an hour of our arrival, they're always so much quieter, too. We're staying in the Dobson House, a veritable Historic Landmark among the local sustainable crowd, as it was the first Earthship Mike Reynolds built in Taos. It has that peaceful serentiy that the Harris House did (the Hut down in the rock querry did not). I guess because it was so early in the designs, which have evolved since, there is no catchwater and I miss that. It made a nice safe place for the kids to play while I sat inside and wrote away on the laptop. I'm writing from inside the Toas Bagle shop, the one with the amazingly painted walls. Quotes and mythical images decorate the walls. I want to paint my living room this way. Above the counter, in huge words, hangs the center of it all: One cannot step twice into the same river. Indeed.

 urlLink Gwen always says linkelodion, and that's cool, but I don't want to steal without asking. Anyway, at long last we found lodging for Taos. So many of the people we talked to were so helpful that I wanted to do a link montage of the effort. First of all, the reason it was so hard is that our standby--the Earthship rentals owned by urlLink Solar Survival --was booked through April. If you want to stay there, talk to Rebecca for reservations and please tell her Annie Feighery recommended it so maybe we could get a discount ourselves. There are three other Earthships we came across for rent: the Harris Earthship at Greater World (505-770-7790), the Dobson House, and the Sun Catcher (505-758-8745). Having given up on finding an earthship, I delved into other options. One of the funnest I found was urlLink a luxury treehouse located on the banks of the Rio Grande, just at the bottom of the Mesa you ascend to arrive in the beautiful Taos highland valley. urlLink The Goetz family keeps up an historic (built in 1830) ranch-style home in Ranchos de Taos. They also have a small guesthouse that is fully wheelchair accessible. urlLink Juddith Pepper keeps what sounds like a charming little Adobe casita in town. It's very affordable, and Juddith promisses to get photos taken soon so people who are site-dependent like me can see it before renting. Taos artist urlLink Ann Cole rents out a beautiful house just outside of town. urlLink Spirit of the Hawk is a pretty, small A-Frame in Valdez, our favorite village in the valley. Finally, had we desired a bed and breakfast instead of a rental home, I'm sure we would have stayed here. It's a B&B dedicated to renewing writers. In fact, you can apply for a fellowship where your stay for a month is covered, and they bring a local publisher to meet with you. I'm going to try to visit the place this time so I know if I want to stay there sometime in the future. My mom has visions of us doing a mother/daughter writers' weekend or week there sometime. Our criteria for a good place to stay is dependent on kitchen, view, price, and friendliness toward children.

 Gwen invited me to her writers' group last month and I eagerly accepted. I've linked to urlLink Gwen's blog forever. Actually, it should be diary, as Gwen and I mutually decided last night that women tend to diary or journal while men need to call it something cooler. Gwen's site has been up for nine years and no one considers her one of the big 25 or whatever original bloggers. Hence, the whole entity of blogging emerged from a genre women not only invented nearly four hundred years ago (Anne Bradstreet, Mary White Rowlandson), but already had down perfectly well, and yet men felt just wasn't gruff enough so they had to call it something cool. Anyway, another member of our group has a website and her distinct style certainly fits my mood tonight. Bloggers, meet urlLink Sister Beverly ! She's an x-rated stand-up commedienne, and she's available for engagement world-wide, so call her up!

 Jeez. Does everyone but me really have a book deal?! urlLink Belle de Jour , aka, Diary of a London Callgirl: "Yes, there is a book deal. To have something worthwhile for the publisher I may write a bit less here. Not a hiatus - rather an attempt to manage writing time between the important chores of depilation and maintaining the dimensions of my bottom."

 I'm in the mood to blog sex. That's right, this is your NC-17 warning. Eat your heart out Michael Powell. What happened to urlLink Dr. Menlo ? Where are the pretty pictures when I want them! Our girl, Twiddly, is reviewing an e-novel out of the erotica-slash-history genre. Hmmm. urlLink TwiddlyBits' Sex Blog : "The book is about Therese von Falberg, Mother Superior of the Sisters of Montebello, of the Order of St. Mary Magdalene. Set 'somewhere in central Europe' in the 1940s, a crisis arises when the Imperial Army comes to the castle of Montebello and wants 'girls' for their Officers Club. Therese is given a choice - either the Army conscripts women from the village, or she & some of the other nuns can 'volunteer' to be the officers' concubines. Wow, talk about breaking some taboos, eh? I found the story to be engaging, the characters well-rounded and the dialogue to be more or less believeable. I was pleasantly surprised to find that there was honest humor in these pages as well as sex scenes that are just the right touch of spice that I enjoy. It was fascinating to view these experiences from the eyes of Therese and the other nuns. I especially enjoyed the character of Captain Prince Franz Mefist, the Adjutant of the Army brigade that occupies the castle. It is he who gives Therese the ultimatum and he who supervises the nuns' training as the officers' 'girls'. He is aristocratic with an air of privilege that brooks no compromise, yet is kind and sympathetic to their plight, even as he gives them no room to refuse. As the nuns enter their new profession, they learn several things - there are many wonderful scenes involving their 'enlightenment', but I won't spoil the fun by divulging everything here."

 urlLink The World Star Gazette is a new newspaper, that just reports news from blogs. Hmmm. Kind of like Technorati, but with columns.

 Let's start with a history lesson. On September 11, 2001 I woke up before Aidan, then an 8-month-old baby, which was rare. If I got up, I'd wake him up, so I decided to hit the remote and watch the morning show from bed for a few minutes before the day's crazy schedule began. I turned on the TV to see Matt Lauer discussing the smoke plume coming out of one of the World Trade Center building. I watched live as a plane flew into the other, and then as the two buildings crashed to the ground. I remember the phrase that kept pounding into my mind as I watched: people are dying right now. I'm watching hundreds, if not thousands of people die. Right now . Since that day, I've had the same thought going through my head non-stop. Hundreds and thousands of people are dying. Right now. Last month saw the death toll for innocent men, women, and children in Iraq pass the ten thousand mark. That doesn't include soldiers who died defending that country, it's just bystanders. Similarly, bystanders killed by the predominantly American military forces in Afghanistan are more difficult to compute because of the country's nebulous government and terrain, but the number is easily twice that. So I think it's a safe estimate to say that the innocent bystanders killed in these two military actions now number over thirty thousand people. That's a ten to one ratio for the number of people killed in America on September 11. And whether or not it's merited, most Americans believe we're in Iraq as a response to that horrific day. When will it be enough for our government's leaders? If we were practicing an eye for an eye, that standard long ago passed. If we're enforcing some measure of justice, why don't we open our judicial system or at least the World Court's to examine the process? If there is yet another measure for defeat we're working toward, an exit-strategy, if you will, in military terms, then what is it? Back in June of 2002, Howard Dean stepped forward as the first person to say I want to beat George Bush in the 2004 election, and as president, my first act will be to clean up this mess of a war with effectively the entire Middle East. Howard Dean was the first political candidate to oppose the administration's increasingly clear plan to attack Iraq. So, in short, I began supporting Howard Dean because I knew he wasn't in it to tow the line for the Bush administration agenda, an agenda I felt then, and continue to feel, indiscriminately kills people purely for financial gain. I have no interest in John Kerry because before Howard Dean made having a spine popular again in D.C., Kerry was a Bush yes man. He voted for the military actions against both Afghanistand and Iraq. One interesting little occurrence might change my position. This past weekend, New Mexico's beloved Bill Richardson emerged as a possible VP candidate for Kerry. Like Dean, Bill was never a Bush yes man. In fact, as Clinton's Secretary of Energy, Bill knows the politics of the Middle East intimately, and still found staying out of war in our national security and energy interests. Because he's a Latino, I feel secure that he's a competent, critical thinker. One doesn't often grow up a minority by never questioning the dominant paradigm. As Kerry's VP, Bill could position himself as a strong frontrunner for eventual presidency. He would be an amazing president. And so I might just find myself supporting an administration for nine long years again, for the sake of the VP. None of this, of course, motivated me to go to the polls today. I smirked this morning as I listened to the radio and realized this was even election Tuesday. The last time there was a presidential primary, I voted for a Republican! I voted for John McCain because I thought he was a better candidate for the already sinched Gore to go up against. I wonder how many voters voted this way for Kerry this time around.

 urlLink Christopher Lydon Interviews... : : "To celebrate Emerson's 200th birthday, I am gathering observations for a long public radio conversation on The American Plato and the 'God for Bloggers,' who Harold Bloom says is 'closer to us than ever.' Cornel West was high on my list, and Monday afternoon we stretched out in his office at Princeton. Emerson was the American Socrates, the American Hamlet and the American Isaiah, said West warming up. And a modern reading of Emerson keeps alive those prophetic, Shakespearean and Socratic dimensions in American life. "

 Liz of Mom & Pop Culture has a witty reaction to Martha's verdict. I have to say that I also found it a little too convenient that the one person to go down for corporate misdeeds is the world's most famous Working Woman and a notable contributor to the Democratic Party. Let's face it, for a religious-right Republican, she's pretty much the anti-christ. urlLink MOM & Pop Culture : "The verdict is in, we've all heard it. Martha is being punished for her lies. But I can't help but think that in this sexist, patriarchal society that Martha is being railroaded. Doesn't it seem like she is being punished for being a bitch, and for being an 'uppity woman'?..." "...I'd like to see Martha bounce back from all of this. Suddenly, as the underdog, I like her. I will continue buying her products in Kmart and frankly if Kmart severs their ties with Martha Stewart, I would have little use for them. Besides Martha's products, their stuff is shitty. I will not buy Martha's magazine though, because I never had much use for that."

 (a segment from urlLink my SprogBlog ) The Montrose Library program really fell apart, so now I'm in search of a new branch. Today was my first time to go to the Heights' Tuesday storytime, and I got swarmed by a few moms who seemed desperate for conversation. As one in particular talked to me, I thought to myself that this is how wide my eyes would be and how protruding my words would fall out if I didn't have blogs. Thank God for this little social outlet. I've been discussing that the organizers of BloggerCon II didn't have any place in their conference for mom-blogs. It seems that, after being removed from functioning society in the real world, moms are being removed from it in the blogging world as well. How have we as a culture come to segregate childraising from other roles in our world so completely? Even at the library, I've noticed an overwhelming majority of moms (and nannies) who are foreign. I can only guess that their cultural upbringing taught them to trust public institutional offerings, especially for rearing children, while our own has taught us that public programming is for poor people. But children were never meant to be raised in isolation, and the otherwise suburb-induced, garage-style of child raising that makes blogs so valuable for moms everywhere, must also be affecting our children.

 Back in the early days of blogging, it seemed the epicenter of the blogosphere was in the Silicon Valley. But, maybe because the dot-com'ers used the economic downturn as an excuse to go back to grad school, but probably because blogging perfectly captures the inter-disciplinary surge among the hoity-toitiest of academia, the epicenter is firmly located in Boston. And so it came to be that Harvard Law took to blogging like white on rice, white rice, that is, and urlLink hosted a conference by and for bloggers (as opposed to vendors) last October to discuss everything blog-worthy. This April, they're hosting the sequel: urlLink BloggerCon II . urlLink Lisa Williams was kind enough to mention here in my comments that she'd save me a spot in the Women's Forum, I couldn't resist immediately accepting. Up until then, I thought the event was to be an exclusive thing to just the hoities, but I guess they mean for anyone who can to attend. I already found a problem, though, with the agenda-setting process. The organizers laid out the application of blogs in our lives as the focus. So far so good. And then, they appointed the equivalent of a listing of college departments as the categories for the applications of blogs to fall into. These included technology, law, politics, and so on. I can understand a mindset so entrenched in academia that it seems the world falls into these schools, in fact, as a rejected applicant to Harvard Law's policy program myself, maybe I'm just jealous of their mindset! But what really disappointed me, is that they left out my department! Where's the social sciences? No anthropology? No sociology? Que pues, man! Blogging is nothing if not a mirror. A tool for reflecting the popular culture's musings and responses. An ever shifting opinion poll, live and interactive. The microscope into the heart of any given cultural group. Sounds like the social sciences to me. My personal application for blogging was also neglected. Blogging is also as a lifeline back to the world of the living for those who have been removed, the interacting adults that say sentences longer and more complex than my three-year-old's queries about where Mr. Wind lives. I read recently that the sling was arguably the most significant development in technology for the human race because it allowed women to tie on a baby, thus freeing their hands for food acquisition. The sling put women in the workforce! Suddenly the food supply was substantial enough to support the advancement of the race over their inter-species competitors. This, timed well with the perfection of the spear, was the missing link our species needed to get out of Africa and populate the world. Today, the computer, and especially blogging, is the sling for the modern woman. It allows me to join the workforce again, while still watching over my children. It enables me to survive the otherwise utter isolation our culture leaves women at this part of their lives by offering a little conversation here, a witty observation there. Without it, I would have long since been carried to the nut house! I still might have to be, don't get me wrong, but at least I'll take my laptop with me when I go. This is really an issue unique to women, and I think it's the biggest reason there are more women bloggers online than men, as well as the biggest reason women bloggers are so under-recognized amongst the bloggeratti (whose ranks have never been shared with a mom-blog that I know of). Considering Sarah Blaffer Hrdy's research which persuasively argues that the desire for social interaction is intricately linked to the nurturing emotional surge of motherhood since a mother's progeny's survival was dependent upon social positioning in our species' early days, as well as considering my own body and emotions, I think it's nothing short of torture to take women out of functioning society at the very time their brain's need it most. The isolation and removal from society that comprise reality for the middle-class American woman living in this first decade of the twenty-first century is finally alleviated--just a little, but enough--by blogs. Women and men alike somehow lost track of the goals of the struggle for equality. Equality doesn't necessitate homogeneity. In so far that blogs reflect the reality of our lives, a woman's blog is not going to reflect the same world as a man's. Some women have already complained that the conference has a woman's forum, saying it belittles women. I think they're afraid of looking under-recognized by needing the special attention. They want to play on the same court as the boys. But I don't think it's even the same game! Rather than struggling for the same of everything, the push for equality among the genders should focus on celebrating all things "she" every bit as much as all things "he."

 urlLink Da Vinci Code Your Life / Can the blasphemous bestseller help you see the mystical world anew, or is it just another doorstop? : "...But here's the divine gist: You don't have to stop with the book. The great thing about 'The Da Vinci Code' is that it could very well do for the mass public what no other chunk of dense scholarly research, no subversive New Age movement, no horrific blood-drenched movie depicting the gruesome and sadomasochistic bludgeoning of a popular Jewish mystic could do: that is, offer the general public wide-open access to vital, unsettling questions of faith, of power, of Mystery with a capital M. It's true. Could the wild popularity of this little book mean we're more ready to hear more potent, revealing truths, to uncover the more divine meanings behind all those seemingly commonplace things we take for granted, to question those stagnant histories and false gods that have been so viciously forced upon us? Could it maybe indicate that we really are more ready than we've ever been to go beyond the church's meager misogynistic homophobic revisionist teachings, to start seeing the deeply mystical and hilariously twisted interconnectedness of the world? You think? I, for one, didn't want to read Brown's book. I am not much of a fan of quickie best-seller page-turners with minimal character development and nonexistent literary nuance and sledgehammer plot devices. But that's just the lit snob in me. I read it anyway. And I had a blast. And I realized, there is a lesson here. And it does not have to be about massive conspiracy theory. You do not have to agree with every conclusion in the book and start running around trying to uncover links to secret societies while sinister forces move about the Louvre. You do not even need to begin with the rather insidious and soul-delimiting dangers of organized religion. You can focus this kind of perspective, this awareness, on just about anything in your life. Food. Cars. Sex. Politics. Guns. You trust your instincts and pick at a thread of curiosity and you pull, read up and educate yourself, and pretty soon you're reading 'Fast Food Nation' or 'High and Mighty' or 'Stupid White Men' and realizing not only how you've been duped but also how refreshing it is to see through the masks and the bogus marketing and the hidden histories. It does not have to be complicated. You simply begin to notice. You begin to see the signs, understand the symbols, the divine winks, realize that there are enormous hidden worlds of belief and interconnected history just under the manufactured and carefully orchestrated surface of things, mysteries that have long gone unnoticed or underappreciated or ignored but that are ready and eager for you to discover them anew..."

 urlLink Discovery Channel :: Did a Comet Trigger The Great Chicago Fire? : "Perhaps it was not Mrs. O'Leary's cow kicking over a lantern that sparked the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, which destroyed the downtown area and claimed 300 lives. New research lends credence to an alternative explanation: The fire, along with less-publicized and even more deadly blazes the same night in upstate Wisconsin and Michigan, was the result of a comet fragment crashing into Earth's atmosphere."

 For the record, this is not my official reply in the Mr. Locke debate. But it is related. With a heavy heart today I took urlLink Dean for America off my blogroll. I almost deleted the line, and then stopped just short of total disenfranchisement. If you look to the right of this entry, you'll notice that I put a urlLink Vote Nader link in instead. As I flashed over to Nader's page to double check the link, I was pleased to see the press release that announced the urlLink Associated Press poll results show Nader holding 6% ! Go Nader! My Howard Dean posters are little more than placemats on my desk now. I think I'll save them and put them up in my someday home office. I still have my "I Voted in Election 2000" button, I should have that framed and hang it next to these posters. It can be the wall of urlLink Should Have Beens . The nice thing about supporting Nader is the comforting knowledge that you're in it for the long haul. Despite the majority of his urlLink stated platform goals , his real objective is to establish a viable party alternative to democrats and republicans. For Nader, viable is defined as receiving federal election monies. Maybe in thirty or so years, he'll win his battle, or someone else will in his name. It can be the Nader Party. And it will garner at least a fifth, if not a good third of the national vote, forever killing the terrible dichotomy of two-party politics here in the US. Now that Nader's polling at 6%, 20% doesn't look so impossible.

 In my corner of the world, not many people know about blogging. I'm a poster child of sorts because I end up explaining it and showing it off everywhere I go. I'm so excited about this new movement, a new medium through which our little voices get a tiny bit bigger. So many forces make them smaller: corporations, lobby-based politics, garage lifestyles. Blogging helps that, just a little. Clearly, others agree. Blogger alone has well over a million accounts, and it's only one of hundreds of blog tools online. I've heard Iran has over ten thousand blogs, and I imagine that, since China has more people online than the US has period, there must be at least a million bloggers in China. I love to think of the personal empowerment and social change blogging is bringing about in our world. This little populist force is also serving our very personal need for community. I've heard some people compare blogging to a message in a bottle. That analogy doesn't fit for me at all. When I think of a message in a bottle, my mind brings up Castaway , which denotes desperation and hopelessness. That's not blogging. People are out there, hungry for your words. Blogging is far closer to throwing seeds in the wind. You don't know just where your words are going, but there's a good chance that they'll sprout wherever they land. And those sprouted seeds will be edifying fellowship for someone. If you're really lucky, that someone will comment you and your words will bring you edifying fellowship, as well. I'm proud to say that, through this blog and my urlLink SprogBlog , I've played a significant inspiring force toward the creation of five blogs. First, was urlLink Lisa W. , who was eager to talk about her new adventures in motherhood and share in the blogosphere's fellowship because her husband's military position keeps her far from friends and family. Next was Luca, who, despite his very technical position as an engineer in the space industry, is quite eloquent, and needed an outlet for his life experiences. Then came my wonderful husband, urlLink John , who was tired of not being able to find any blogs dedicated to space so decided to start his own. Of course, anyone who frequents John's blog by now knows how infrequently he finds time to post. It seems a career dedicated to space doesn't leave much room for anything else dedicated to space! I think I actually put more space articles up on my blog than he does on his! Two weeks ago, my good friend urlLink Neal restarted his blog, abandoned since 1995! Mr. Locke's Classroom is host to urlLink one half of a heated debate regarding urlLink politics and urlLink disillusionment , and the judges are Neal's (Mr. Locke's) high school students (who, btw, can urlLink now blog for extra credit). This brings me to number five, my proudest and most intimate bloggie. For over a year, I've encouraged this person to get off her duff and start blogging. She's a great writer, but all her creative energies go to the extemporaneous speaking she does every week for her job. She needs to write more. Finally, yesterday, she did. Bloggers, meet my mom: urlLink Pastor Ellen !

 I felt the Passion review in last week's New Yorker was about the best I've seen, and I was thrilled to see they put it online. My favorite point is that many generations and cultures have done their best to portray Jesus, via frescos, sculptures, drama, and now cinema. The portrayals end up reflecting more about the portrayers than the portrayee. Our culture chose to portray him through our chief values of violence and media. How fitting. urlLink The New Yorker: The Critics: The Current Cinema

But it was an obvious fact that the 120-foot schooner Stacia Leigh sat with its keel in the mud of a slip at Pier 22, where it has operated as a bed and breakfast since 2000"

 here's the conclusions of the day's research on thyroid: First off, urlLink hypothyroid is pretty common. It means a person’s thyroid isn’t urlLink producing enough hormone. It can be an underlying contributing cause or an outright direct cause to a large number of health problems, including confusion in thoughts or nervous thinking, heart palpitations, heavy sweating, loose stools, weight loss, and serious fatigue. The medical powers that be recommend every adult over 35 get thyroid blood work done every few years. Sometimes when the body is aware that it needs more thyroid hormones, it enlarges the thyroid to up its production. This is called goiter. Goiter results in a full looking lower neck (the area between your collar bones and adams apple). The riskiest complication aside from the general poor health that can result from low thyroid is the development of nodules, which could (very rarely) be cancerous and therefore need to be biopsies. This seems similar to the way irritable bowel syndrome can develop into polyps, which can very rarely be cancerous. The thyroid doesn’t often go berserk for genetic reasons, it’s too important to human biology for thousands of years of human evolution to let that gene slip by. Instead, it’s susceptible to environmental effects. These range from literally the environment ( urlLink as contaminants often reduce or increase endocrine production in our bodies ), or the dietary minerals absorbed through food. The thyroid depends chiefly on iodine uptake through the diet. Dietary iodine occurs predominantly via ocean vegetables, ocean fish, and foods grown in iodine-rich soil. This last one is a problem for areas that have over farmed soil, and thus depleted the dirt of its minerals, and areas where the farming soil is very old in geologic terms. That means the most recent huge geological action was hundreds and thousands of years ago, and erosion is the primary geologic force since. Jagged mountain regions--such as the Himalayas or Rockies--are the best examples because in lower areas, floods renew the earth or at least erosion from the highlands does. (This makes me wonder if man-made flood prevention already has or maybe someday will make food from American soil deplete of vitamins and minerals. Hmm.) One kind of thyroid problem called urlLink Euthyroid goiter pops up at times of the life where giant hormonal changes are running amuck (read: puberty, pregnancy, menopause). Apparently, people living in hot climates, and people whose lifestyles cause them to sweat a lot are at additional risk for low iodine. It’s a new idea, but urlLink this paper makes a powerful argument . I caught on one correlation in its readings too that makes me also connect the two. Heart palpitations can be caused by an imbalance of electrolytes, and sweat is the chief cause of electrolyte imbalance in humans. Heart palpitations are also a common effect from low thyroid. One way governments combat low thyroid among the population is by advising (as the US gov’t does) or mandating ( urlLink as the Canadian gov’t does ) salt producers to iodize salt. Currently, 50-70% of the US population consumes iodized salt. Additionally, health organizations and governments alike have launched urlLink social marketing campains to push iodized salt use. Interestingly, our family had switched to kosher and French sea salt for aesthetic reasons (it tastes so good, you don’t need as much!). A friend of mine went to the doctor for low thyroid and was advised to avoid soy products. A huge percentage of the global population has relied on soy as a dietary foundation for so many generations, that I found myself seriously doubting the validity of the advice. Sure enough, I looked it up and found huge misconceptions regarding soy and thyroid. Anyone whose been through a pregnancy recently knows how important it is to avoid foods high in calcium (chiefly dairy products) around the time of day you take your prenatal vitamin. This is because some vitamin uptake, especially iron uptake, i inhibited by calcium. Iodine uptake is similarly affected by soy products. So while urlLink some irresponsible sources say the isoflavones that make soy one of nature’s most perfect foods are “potent anti-thyroid agents,” they should more accurately say that isoflavones interfere with your colon’s absorption of iodine, which your body needs to maintain a healthy thyroid. If your diet is already rich in sources of iodine, there is no worry. However, if you have reason to be concerned about your iodine levels, try to eat a source of iodine at least once a day when you haven’t consumed a soy product for an hour or two, and don’t plan to consume it for an hour or so longer. This harks to the underlying issue of variety in dietary consumption among Americans. If we ate sufficiently varied diets regularly, there would be nothing to worry about. We have to avoid food ruts. The groundwater should also be a source of iodine, but we drink carefully filtered water in an effort to avoid the harmful urlLink environmental polutants common in urlLink metropolitan , urlLink industrial , and urlLink agricultural areas. We're probably filtering out our minerals, too. Recently we began using storebought spring water for drinking (tea, water, etc) and using the fridge filtered water for cooking. The spring water is natural groundwater from sources too deep to typically be polluted, so it should solve both problems for us.

 I'm not one of those women that takes girls' weekends, I don't like leaving my family for a few hours, much less a whole weekend. The forces of the world--our busy schedules, long work hours, etc.--keep us apart enough, when we make our way through the week and find ourselves together at the weekend, we cherish it. As close as I get to a great feminine get-away seems to be the occasional visits of my best friend who moved to Florida a year ago. Michele, affectionately called Michie, arrived Friday. Last night we went to a club, a funny experience since I've pretty much given up clubbing. I know now that was the right choice. Michie also has virtually given up clubbing, deciding she'd rather hang out in a cafe or at someone's house where she could talk to people and enjoy music--and drink without going broke, I'll add. It's hard to justify spending money on the cover at the door, on the drinks, and on the parking (although we saved that, and the need for a designated driver, by taking the bus!) for the experience of music too loud to talk w/o screaming, smoky rooms that hurt your nose and throat. It was so much fun to see the friends we hadn't gotten together in so long, but we didn't really enjoy them b/c of the difficult environment. So we all escaped at long last to my house, fortunately just a few blocks from the club. John won husband of the year for hosting six or seven people at five minutes notice at one in the morning! Yolanda, the domestic goddess who helps me with the house and kids for three hours once or so a week, certainly warmed her way even further into my heart because the house was perfectly ready for surprise guests. Cue up imusic, light candles, poor grappa and lemoncello, and bam! instant party! It didn't last long, most guests had to drive back to the burbs. Throughout the evening, I noticed my wedding ring was effectively the anti-club. Even when we clubbed while John and I were still dating, I felt pretty comfortable with the nature of the atmosphere being one of mating acquisition, but last night, that whole dance seemed odd and surreal in light of my husband and two children waiting for me at home. I was younger than everyone we met there, but I felt like a school marm chaperoning the kids. Or more appropriately, like the yuppy mom taking her pre-teen and pre-teen's friends to see Britney. I liked the band, but why do they make the music so loud it hurt my ears? I love to dance, but my groove was lacking from this discomfort. God knows I've been to plenty of the alternative lifestyle's parties: the tired wine tastings or Friday museum socials. Gag me! -to show my age and, a little more, the point. Am I so odd-man-out between dominant ideologies and consumer groups that I can't be social in public at all? I want a social occasion where my kids are welcome, where I can drink and listen to great music (without burning off the cilia in my ear canals), music that's ambient and groovie while peppered with dirty illusions and swear words. I want to be surrounded by a pluralistic community of people who aren't like me, but appreciate me as if my beliefs were their own. I used to think bloggers were this, but I know they're not. When Michele still lived here, she was always fun to go out with because even if we clubbed, we'd find a cozy couch in a corner quiet enough to talk, and cuddle ourselves back to a sane place after the week stripped all our positions of strength. But things change, right? isn't that my schtick? That river can never exist again, I can no more set my foot back down into it than I can hold its water in my hands. I'm comforted at least that my husband is everything in every way that I need in a social companion. The point that eludes me here is that I had a great time catching up with Michie and I hate her program in Florida for taking her away. And nothing ever soothes the fuzzy, next morning feeling like gunpowder green tea.

 urlLink Atlantic Unbound | Interviews | 2004.04.08 : "...I remember I called up Trippi one day. It must have been two days after the Fourth of July, right after we busted the numbers for second-quarter fund-raising. I said, 'Joe, you know what this is, don't you? This isn't Jimmy Carter or George McGovern or Jerry Brown or Ross Perot or any of the analogies people are making. You know who this is?' He said, 'Yeah, I know exactly who. It's Andrew Jackson.' And he was right. If we'd really pulled this off, you'd have the equivalent of that scene when Andrew Jackson becomes President and the people just break down the fence at the White House and say, 'This is our place.' That's what we were trying to do. I think somewhere, somehow, someway, someone may do that. I think John Kerry could be a step in that direction. If someone had said to me, You're going to raise $50 million dollars, and most of it is going to be from people giving you $200 bucks or less, I would have said, 'You're nuts. Are you kidding me?' But that's what we did. As Joe would always say, It's not about us, it's about you. We didn't do this; you did it. Howard Dean set it in motion. He had the courage to stand up for his beliefs. But then America took over. That's the saddest thing you see at the end of this. It could have been so much more..."

 urlLink Broadband Used By 68 Million Americans the Search Engine Journal : "Broadband is the online choice for over half the Internet users in the US. According to a survey of 2,200 Americans over 18, released Monday by the non-profit Pew Internet & American Life Project. About 68 million people, representing 55% of all adults who surf the Net, now have access to cable, DSL or other high-speed cyberconnections at the office or, increasingly, at home. * As of February, 48 million folks, or 39% of Net users, had adopted speedy access at home. That’s a 60% climb compared with the 30 million home users in March 2003. * Though cable modems remain the broadband vehicle of choice, a surge in DSL subscriptions is helping fuel the rise. DSL now claims a 42% share of the home broadband market, up from 28% a year ago. For one thing, the DSL camp is doing a better job of rolling out its infrastructure and filling orders, says Pew researcher John Horrigan. One enormous factor that may also account for this shift is that phone companies have been lowering prices and offering DSL in conjunction with long-distance and wireless phone plans. What does this mean for Internet marketing and search portals? Well, if 55% of Americans have access to broadband Internet, that frees up the playing field for multimedia, audio and video feed search engines like Singing Fish or AltaVista, easy and fast file swapping, and targeted video style advertising in normal ad spots, or within Instant messenger tools..."

 urlLink The Australian: HIV strips Hollywood porn scene [April 20, 2004] : "HOLLYWOOD has always believed that any publicity, however sordid, is good for business. But the HIV infection that has prompted a 60-day shutdown of California's pornographic film sector has brought unwelcome attention to a $US19 billion ($25.5 billion) industry that has always fiercely protected its privacy. The porn-makers stopped production last week as soon as veteran star Darren James was found to be HIV-positive. The star of a lucrative film franchise called Mr Beaver Checks In was discovered to have been infected while filming in Rio de Janeiro when he underwent one of the mandatory medical checks the industry demands. All 14 of James's screen partners in the period before diagnosis have been quarantined and their names published, which is how Lara Roxx, an 18-year-old Canadian who has been in the business a matter of months, discovered she, too, had contracted HIV. A second list of 35 performers who worked with those who might be infected was also published. All must be checked after the 60-day HIV incubation period has elapsed before returning to work. Until then, all filming has been halted. In an industry peopled by pseudonyms, such swift self-regulation is impressive. As Tim Connelly, publisher of trade magazine Adult Video News put it: 'You would probably be ostracised if you didn't have a test. It's a Wild West out there. That would be absolutely insane.

 urlLink Guardian Unlimited Film | Features | Forget the Alamo : "'Remember the Alamo!' is an odd phrase to connect with an event that has been as comprehensively misremembered as any in the blood-soaked history of a nation. Facts get lost in the mythomaniacal fog that surrounds the 1836 siege of the Texan fort-cum-mission by a 7,000-strong Mexican army. If you listen to the guardians of the official version, you never learn that the 200 brave souls who died at the Alamo were defending the right of white settlers to steal land that was officially Mexican sovereign territory, and resisting the Mexican government's prohibition of human slavery. Or that Jim Bowie, he of the famous knife, was a proud slaveholder, or that Davy Crockett, reputed Indian-fighter, bear-slayer, former Tennessee congressman and all-round king of the wild frontier, never wore one of those stupid raccoon hats. But in Texas, you can get in all sorts of trouble if you disrespect the myths. Look at Ozzy Osbourne: he once took a whizz on the Alamo and was lucky not to find himself strung up on the mission's bellrope. The Alamo story always seems to be disinterred whenever America lurches into one of its military adventures. John Wayne made The Alamo in 1960 at the height of the Cold War, just as Washington was gearing up for the 'noble cause' of destroying a small rice-and-fish based economy in Southeast Asia. The new version, directed by John Lee Hancock, arrives at an unpropitious moment for the American mission in Iraq. The trouble is that our age of political correctness means that the crude mythmaking of The Duke cannot be revived without massive protest, even while the Daughters of the Republic must be partially appeased. The result is a conflicted, semi-revisionist version, probably made more confusing by the constant interference of its equally besieged backers, Disney. As for 'Remember the Alamo!' - six hours after I saw it, it was vanishing from my memory..."

 Nearly every night as John and I watch the urlLink Jim Lehrer News Hour , we watch in dread as they parade in silence the faces of the most recently fallen American young men and women in Iraq. We've said, and we know, that one night soon, someone we know will show up there. urlLink The Washington Post has a new way to show the faces of the dead, the multimedia advance in bereavement, if you will. It makes my stomach upset. What are kids to do when high school ends? One of the few institutions our society offers is low-cost professional education in the form of community college or junior college, but the reason this remains possible for some is that these schools are in their hometown, where they can live with their parents and apply their day-job money that would otherwise go to housing to college instead. In the rural, small town from which I came, there was no such option. Because anyone who went to college would also have to pay full living expenses, and because the absence of a college at home necessitated leaving the family, maybe 12 of my graduating class of about 100 completed more than a year of college. Of the remainders, the women scattered to marry themselves off to men with jobs, some found wage work of their own. Some joined the majority of the men, who joined either active or reserve service in an effort to gain the honor and dignity college and a career otherwise offered. This was the class of 1995. John's was the class of 1994. Between the two of us, we're certain we know hundreds in service. We hurt for them, for their lives in danger and for their families at home worrying about their lives in danger. And we keep in mind that for every one American death we see covered in the news, tens and hundreds of Iraqis died for our version of freedom that day, as well. Their families cry tonight with salt tears, just as the American families are. For centuries of human history, if a woman needed money to survive, she could sell her body, put her life at risk and get some quick cash with little skills required. The same option has existed for men, in the form of military service. What kind of country is this that still offers no choices for young people looking for a little clout in life aside from selling themselves? A finger on a trigger, a chest in a bullet-proof jacket, or open legs on a bed: they're all sad representations of our national identity. We're killing our young men and women. And for what? They're my friends! My classmates! They shouldn't be dying.

 Perhaps the 9/11 Commission finally got to the real root cause for why the August 6 Memo went so unnoticed. They asked George Tenet this morning if he ever met with or spoke to the President in August at all, and he said no.

And finally Tenet said Bush was urlLink in Texas for August . Tenet added that he too took vacation leave in August in some attempt to take the heat off his boss, but I think the point was well understood. I just want to note how amazing it is and how grateful I am that the Pacifica Radio Network is playing the hearings. I remember being 7 years old and at home during the summer of the Ollie North hearings. I remember it because I was bored to tears as a child when all programming during the day was bumped for the hearings. As an adult, I'm glad the networks made the decision to try to keep the US public in the loop. Now, unless you have cable, the hearings are inaccessible, except for Pacifica (90.1 here in Houston and kpft.org online).

And this is a huge advance in that area. Conversely, if you're aiming for those fertile days, this would also be a big help. urlLink OvuLook Saliva Ovulation Tester

 I finally got around to correcting some stray links and adding a few new ones. This includes the first ever Sex Blog on my blogroll. I think I got too interested in winning a place in the inner circle of blogging and forgot about (to borrow a subject from my new Sex Blogger buddy) servicing my own needs. If you really care about the state of blogging, I guess you feel a responsibility to not link to the big fish that already get plenty of links, but rather to the medium-sized fish. The blogroll is supposed to represent people you interacted with, too. Well fuck that. My blogroll is for me as much as the reader, and it's going to start reflecting what I read all the time, rather than who may or may not have deigned to interact with me. Having said that, I added two bloggers that have actually interacted with me ( urlLink Twiddly Bits and urlLink Rebecca Blood ) and removed one who dissed me ( urlLink Ricky Williams , but I don't hold a grudge, he's busy with a new radio program. He must put all his blogging energies into talk radio. Plus, I think his coach busted him for blogging about a game he shouldn't have mentioned). So, to address the self named Indecent Blog , I really hope readers won't get squeamish on me. Twiddly is very creative--in bed and on the keyboard--in fact, she just accomplished a lifelong goal of double penetration. Am I living vicariously through her blog? Lackluster in bed has never been a problem for me, despite the fact that I've never done DP. I think a sex blog is no different than any other personal blog, in that it offers you a chance to broaden your experiences of people in the world. Maslow said experience is the only real educator, and I've always lived that myself and taught that to my kids. Thanks to Twiddly, my view of the world is a tiny bit wider, and hence, I am a little more educated. I bet other things in peoples' worlds are a tiny bit wider thanks to her, too, but that's another, er, entry altogether. To some small degree, I'm probably rebelling to the general prudification of the world right now. Janet seemed to be some sort of a catalyst for the religious right, and suddenly everything is a little dull from all the censorship. Btw, I link to urlLink Lizbeth of Mom and Pop Culture a lot these days in entries, but she still isn't on the blogroll. She is on the blogroll on my momblog, urlLink the SprogBlog , and I'm still trying to decide if she crosses over enough to put her here, too. urlLink Gwen is a mom who blogs, but she remains here. There's a logic to this, but it's too complicated to explain.

 Lizbeth of urlLink MOM and Pop Culture is beginning a new weekly feature. IMO, this is way better than the urlLink Friday Five . urlLink This past Friday she set off the trend with two great short film links, urlLink one funny in the make fun of sex-idols genre , and urlLink one hilarious in the political genre . The first is very twilight zone music-inspring because it covers the topic of Janet's nipple, but it was filmed years ago. Oooohhh. The second is just pee your pants funny, and it's a great way to draw attention to the urlLink Right for Women's Lives March on April 25.

Finally -- and this may be the most important aspect -- you can send complete copies to people without any restrictions, as long as you do it non-commercially. As any marketing major will tell you, nothing's better for promotion than word of mouth. 'E-books and paper books are intensely complementary.' Doctorow says. 'It's a really good way to recommend the book to friends: just send them the book.' This answers the question many people ask: 'But doesn't he lose money?' The idea is that any lost sales will be offset by the publicity and promotion.

 urlLink Will gravity theory hold up in space? | csmonitor.com : "A controversial space mission that will try to provide the most precise test yet of Einstein's ideas about gravity and space is set to launch next week. The spacecraft, the size of a delivery van, will try to take direct measurements of two predictions from Einstein's theory of general relativity. First, it will gauge how a massive object - Earth - warps space around it. Second, it will test for the first time whether Earth's rotation drags the fabric of space nearby, much like a top twirling on a small cloth drags the cloth into a pinwheel pattern."

 I forget which entertainment personality it was who said it, but I remember thinking one of the best comments during the 2000 campaign was, "I just think the president should be someone smarter than me." You could carry this on now to say it should be someone who works harder than me, too. The saddest thing is, I truly wish this type of work schedule was the standard or at least model for Americans. Instead, our culture values hard work in the office over time with the family, or restoring the body. That Bush is a lucky SOB. urlLink Guardian Unlimited | Special reports | President spends 40% of time out of the office : "President George Bush has spent more than 40% of his presidency at one of his three retreats, sparking criticism from Democrats that he is not taking his job seriously at a crucial time in US history. Mr Bush was on his 33rd visit to his ranch in Crawford, Texas, at the Easter weekend, where he has spent 233 days or almost eight months since his inauguration, according to a tally by CBS news. Add his 78 visits to Camp David and five to Kennebunkport, Maine, and he has spent all or part of 500 days out of the office while in office. Mr Bush was at his ranch on August 6 2001 as part of a month-long holiday when he received the briefing warning of Osama bin Laden's determination to attack the US, which has become a focal point of the 9/11 commission of inquiry. On Thursday the president watched his national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, give her testimony on television, then toured his ranch with the chief executive of the National Rifle Association, Wayne LaPierre, before giving an interview to Ladies Home Journal. Regardless of what is going on in the world Mr Bush is usually in bed by 10pm and wakes at 6am. As governor of Texas he would be in work by 8.30am and out by 5.30pm. In between was a 90-minute to two-hour break for exercise or a nap."

Every body, even the GC is very careful how they formulate their sentences and how they describe Sadir's Militias. They are thugs, thugs thugs. There you have it. I was listening to a representative of al-sadir on TV saying that the officers at police stations come to offer their help and swear allegiance. Habibi, if they don't they will get killed and their police station 'liberated'. Have we forgotten the threat al-Sadir issued that Iraqi security forces should not attack their revolutionary brothers, or they will have to suffer the consequences. Dear US administration, Welcome to the next level. Please don't act surprised and what sort of timing is that: planning to go on a huge attack on the west of Iraq and provoking a group you know very well (I pray to god you knew) that they are trouble makers.

 My stump here for a while has been trying to get people to understand the value of social networks, and how blogging fills that niche so well. Tonight, Gwen blogged about her life before she left her husband. She's said before that blogging saved her life, she started blogging before it was even blogging. Back in the late nineties, just sending her words out to the virtual information superhighway (remember when people called it that?) b/c otherwise she was all alone. Finally, enough distance and healing has allowed her to blog more openly about her divorce and the feelings it left in its wake. I think it illustrates the real person behind these screens, and I think it supports my need to validate blogging as a lifeline for women rendered alone by the RW. Her blog tonight is so brave and open, go read it all. Here's just the highlight: urlLink Gwen's Petty, Judgmental, Evil Thoughts : "Do y'all know what I mean? Can you imagine it? I mean, I'm not saying that we lived in a school bus and God told me to kill my babies with rocks. I'm just saying that it's hard to be alone. It can literally drive you crazy. I'm just saying that it's sad that people can be so lost/trapped alone in an overcrowded world. Nobody wants to build a village that will raise a child. I don't blame them - we're all busy. Every mother has to build her own village, I guess. Good luck, y'all."

 urlLink Essay: The Altered Human Is Already Here : "...This is a social change on the same order as the advent of computers, but one that is taking place inside the human body. Just 50 years ago, according to a report by IMS Health, a company that tracks the pharmaceutical industry, the two biggest-selling over-the-counter drugs were Bufferin and Geritol. The prescription drug business was tiny. In 1954, according to IMS, Johnson & Johnson had $204 million in revenue. Now it is about $36 billion. In 1954, Merck took in $1.5 million in drug sales; in 2002, that figure was $52 billion. To look at it in another way, Americans take so many drugs that some researchers — Dr. Christian G. Daughton of the Environmental Protection Agency's National Exposure Research Laboratory in Las Vegas, for example — are worried about the effects on the environment. What does it mean if the sewers run rich with Zoloft? Or to be more precise, what might happen to fish eggs if the rivers soak up waste water with discarded and excreted pharmaceuticals and personal care products, like shampoo? No one has the answer yet, but the idea that what runs through our collective bloodstream is a potential environmental hazard makes you look at your medicine cabinet in a different way. In short, while the Six Million Dollar Man is still a fantasy, Pharmaceutical Man is already here, and largely unnoticed. Swallowing a pill at a business lunch is likely to elicit little curiosity. A high-powered executive who did not have blood pressure or cholesterol problems might be suspect. There are concerns about the widespread use of antidepressants, but they do not seem to have affected sales..."

 I tend to have year-long term limits in my life. I throw myself into something, then, a year in, I'd better find a way to redefine my interest in that thing or it falls away. And so it comes as little surprise to me that I'm getting a little bored with blogging. I think one of the key precipitating events was the BloggerCon build-up. I don't know how, but I'd fooled myself into thinking these people would respect and recognize me as a blogger. Instead, I'm pretty ignored. I'm a female in my mid-twenties, so I'm pretty used to being ignored. Everyone from politicians to advertisers disses me. Why would an uppity academic Boston crowd be any different? Because bloggers are different. We're people who value the human voice, right? I guess you can take the blogger out of the RW but you can't take the RW out of the blogger. Ignoring me is so ingrained in their psyches, they just can't help themselves. I have to trust in the longstanding strength of the young: use the lack of attention to my advantage, fly under the radar.

 welcome to the urlLink Blazing Star RV park in San Antonio, if you can call this sprawling burb San Antonio. I have to say that, seeing as San Antonio is actually one of my least favorite places in the whole world to visit (this is saying a lot, since traveling is my favorite hobby), this place isn't that bad. It's made habitable by the wi-fi network broadcasted over the hundreds of pull-through slips. When I was growing up and my parents hauled me all over the country from RV park to RV park, I would have killed for something like this. Instead, I was that precocious young girl who sat in the hot tub with the old fogies and talked about travels. Most people know about my family and basketball. This is our fifth Final Four (I've personally only been to one, but we all make the pilgrimage if anyone draws tickets from the lottery. Today we're in mourning because my mom's a Duke alum, which makes the family default Duke fans, and Duke lost last night. To be honest, I was a little glad. Nobody likes a dynasty, and this will make it easier to root for them next year. My brother was rooting for OK State, along with just about every tourist here. And they lost, too! Scalpers are very disappointed because with these two big fan teams' losses, everyone's going back home and ticket prices for the final on Monday are plummeting. John's in Munich, having a great time. He makes me so proud when he travels. He always works hard to speak enough of the language to get around, and he always gets around, appreciating the local culture, food, architecture. He has meetings Monday and Tuesday with ESA. I wish I was with him so bad! We tried, but talk about your pilgrimages! Easter draws crowds to Rome so thick that every European city within decent train distance was booked and upcharged weeks in advance. In the end, it just wasn't worth the price for all of us to go, we'll try an overseas trip later this year. I'm still hankering for Guatemala...

 Dear urlLink D-Nasty , I, too, am obsessed with what sort of person I shall be/become. I think we're the same age about, maybe its indicative of our age. My husband--that's one thing I got figured out, but then, you're paid so that trumps me--also had crappy job puns when a few years back he was designing the node 3 bathroom aboard the International Space Station, starring the innovative combustible toilet. The moral is, crappy jobs abound from elephants to space. If you cover your skin in green tea before and after sunbathing, you're likely to escape cancer, as green tea eats up those feisty little carcinogens formed from UV rays. If you just say the body politic, you don't have to worry about whether politics is a singular or plural noun. Medicine is a far more corrupt field than politics or law, maybe that's the turn-on for you? I'm a big fan of wives, want one of my own. Damn polygamy laws keep me from getting one, though. Forget the pet. My cat is making me sell my house. Want to buy a house? Downtown Houston? Bible-belt frontage? The universe is playing with us. My emotions are like play-doh in some gods' playdate. Love life, lost in life, love life, find pests taking over your house.

 While living in the same neighborhood as the apparent two-time house thieves can be withstood, finding first a roach, and now fleas in my house has me wanting to sell. At least the thieves are healthier thanks to our stuff, seeing as they've traded our three bikes for other unrecognizable bikes, presumably via some fence, they bike everywhere now! All day long, I used to see them walking around the neighborhood, but now they zoom by. I hear the whizz of a ten-speed and look up just in time to see another would-be house thief fly by the window. One other time in the four years we've lived here I found a roach. It sparked a terrible cleaning spree that lasted days. This time, I tried to calm down and focus on the general trend toward simplicity that can only help the cleanliness of the house. Now, I realize giving my cat the de-flea meds when we went out of town (so as to avoid any meds coming into contact with my kids) must have resulted in a flea migration from cat to couch. Shit! How long before they spread to the bedrooms? Are flea bites dangerous? Before we had kids, we had a flea outbreak with our dog, Argos. We used diatomaceous earth then, but that's not exactly good for kids who might inhale the particulates accidentally. The chemical alternatives look even worse. I've never even used bug repellent on the kids, I'm not about to bug bomb my house. I read years ago that bug bombs are associated with elevated rates of brain cancer in children. I found some candle in water remedy that I'm willing to try, but what if that doesn't work? Like any good Ikea hunk, this couch is slip covered and I'll be washing that post haste, but if that doesn't do it, I think we have to move. Does anyone want to buy a red Ikea hide-away couch?

She has requested that I close down the blog site as of tonight. I'm sorry for the short notice, and I hope it was worth something while it lasted. " Kids, let me just say that your Mr. Locke did something big when he encouraged you to start blogs. Don't let that die here.

This angle is the same as that of the sun's rising, so that as the sun climbs into the sky it follows the edge of the stone for about 40 minutes.

Gombe Stream Research Center headman Mzee Hilali Matama reports that the baby is a female. He has suggested the name “Familia,” which means “family” in Swahili. “Fanni is attentive to the new little girl,” writes Gombe videographer Bill Wallauer, “but her youngest son Fundi was trailing along behind Fanni, whimpering as she traveled up the steep slopes of Linda Valley. He is accustomed to getting all the attention and will have to adjust to life with a new baby in the family. Luckily, he has a wonderful friend in his older brother Fudge, and yesterday I sat and watched as Fudge and Fundi had a long play session near Jane's Peak.” The newborn descends from the “F” family line that Jane has written of extensively. Flo was a popular female and Gombe’s most successful mother at the time, and became well-known to those interested in the goings-on at Gombe. She was even given an obituary in the Sunday Times of London when she died. Her daughter Fifi (Fanni’s mother) had her ninth offspring last year."

 I spent the day recuperating from a cold, and hence, catching up on my TiVo memory. Random and fortuitous, I picked two non-fictions documentaries to watch: last week's urlLink Frontline, the Jesus Factor and HBO's Monica in Black and White . What resulted was a calculated comparison of two president's weaknesses. George W. Bush clearly traded his addiction to alcohol for religious fervor that many mistake for faith. Bill Clinton's weakness was--famously--women, or, perhaps more accurately, infidelity. The two programs together formed a more powerful message than either could be apart. I find myself wanting to bundle them on videos and share this experience with friends. Oh! What I wouldn't give to be listening to pundits pander about Mon's thong right now rather than Abu Graib. We were such an innocent country then. We tarried over the big sentence the President said in angst and supposed ernst: I did not have sexual relations with that woman. Now, we focus on the tedium of the urlLink words in Bush's State of the Union speech in 03, as well as the tedium of the definition of torture and whether the US urlLink is bound to the Geneva Convention . In my fantasies now, in the one debate we're likely to see between Kerry and Bush, Bush tries to blame all his mistakes on the Clinton administration and Kerry answers that if Republicans didn't have the FBI so tied up in intimidating Monica Lewinsky and investigating Clinton for six years, they might have had more time to gather intelligence.

Read his speach here: urlLink Wired News Blog He rambles his way to the point (like I'm not going to do anymore), but once he's rolling, it's pretty funny. I studied Rand back in urlLink the Futures dept. so that part was probably the funniest for me. Well, that part and the one about the firewall kegs. At the end he asks for the solution to his party, which will inevitably get bigger and attract the cops again next year. I read the story and said, the solution's simple: get to know your neighbors better, and invite them, too! Or at least warn them in person that this party is coming up and please call on the cell if you have a problem rather than involving the cops. In broad geo-political terms, I think I'm advocating Canada. John read the story and said the hip, new urban design of open-floorplan houses caused people to be bunched up and they needed a quiet, zen-like room to cycle into to calm down. I said it would turn into the extacy room. In broad geopolitical terms, I guess John's saying the nature of corporate-controlled politics is buck-centered rather than peace and happiness-centered, and were we to employ some zen philosophers before rushing to the tanks next time, we might save some lives and money in the long run.

The scientists have been using pig whipworms to treat Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, by having patients ingest 2,500 microscopic parasitic worm eggs in a glass of Gatorade. Said one enthusiastic participant about ingesting the cocktail, 'What you don't see can't hurt you.' About 40 percent of the parasite-infested ulcerative colitis patients showed improvement, and 91 percent of the worm-egg-guzzling Crohn's disease patients went into remission after six months. The scientists believe the worms may provide chemicals that suppress undesirable immune-system responses and keep the digestive track healthy. "

Of course, one other aspect of Gmail has received a great deal of attention: The service automatically searches members' e-mails for keywords and then adds targeted advertisements to accompany the messages. Many privacy activists have raised questions about such a program. Michaels pooh-poohs such worries. 'I think the privacy concerns are overblown, really, and I think most people agree,' he said. 'As commercial e-mail services go, Gmail's extremely benign, and unless you're scared about evil e-mail-scanning robots, there's not much to worry about.' In any case, the offers keep flooding in.

 urlLink Michael Moore's Candid Camera : "...Last weekend The Los Angeles Times reported that for the first time three Army divisions, more than a third of its combat troops, are so depleted of equipment and skills that they are classified "unfit to fight." In contrast to Washington's neglect, much of "Fahrenheit 9/11" turns out to be a patriotic celebration of the heroic American troops who have been fighting and dying under these and other deplorable conditions since President Bush's declaration of war. In particular, the movie's second hour is carried by the wrenching story of Lila Lipscomb, a flag-waving, self-described "conservative Democrat" from Mr. Moore's hometown of Flint, Mich., whose son, Sgt. Michael Pedersen, was killed in Iraq. We watch Mrs. Lipscomb, who by her own account "always hated" antiwar protesters, come undone with grief and rage. As her extended family gathers around her in the living room, she clutches her son's last letter home and reads it aloud, her shaking voice and hand contrasting with his precise handwriting on lined notebook paper. A good son, Sergeant Pedersen thanks his mother for sending "the bible and books and candy," but not before writing of the president: "He got us out here for nothing whatsoever. I am so furious right now, Mama." By this point, Mr. Moore's jokes, some of them sub-par retreads of Jon Stewart's riffs about the coalition of the willing, have vanished from "Fahrenheit 9/11." So, pretty much, has Michael Moore himself. He told me that Harvey Weinstein of Miramax had wanted him to insert more of himself into the film — "you're the star they're coming to see" — but for once he exercised self-control, getting out of the way of a story that is bigger than he is. "It doesn't need me running around with my exclamation points," he said. He can't resist underlining one moral at the end, but by then the audience, crushed by the needlessness of Mrs. Lipscomb's loss, is ready to listen. Speaking of America's volunteer army, Mr. Moore concludes: "They serve so that we don't have to. They offer to give up their lives so that we can be free. It is, remarkably, their gift to us. And all they ask for in return is that we never send them into harm's way unless it is absolutely necessary. Will they ever trust us again?"..."

While academic labors might in some instances play a role in real-world politics — if, say, the Supreme Court cites your book on the way to a decision — it should not be the design or aim of academics to play that role."

 this is the most erotic and lovely poem I've ever come across on the topic of fleas. It was written in the seventeenth century, and reads like latenight Showtime.

The Flea. : "THE FLEA. by John Donne MARK but this flea, and mark in this, How little that which thou deniest me is ; It suck'd me first, and now sucks thee, And in this flea our two bloods mingled be. Thou know'st that this cannot be said A sin, nor shame, nor loss of maidenhead ; Yet this enjoys before it woo, And pamper'd swells with one blood made of two ; And this, alas ! is more than we would do. O stay, three lives in one flea spare, Where we almost, yea, more than married are. This flea is you and I, and this Our marriage bed, and marriage temple is. Though parents grudge, and you, we're met, And cloister'd in these living walls of jet. Though use make you apt to kill me, Let not to that self-murder added be, And sacrilege, three sins in killing three. Cruel and sudden, hast thou since Purpled thy nail in blood of innocence? Wherein could this flea guilty be, Except in that drop which it suck'd from thee? Yet thou triumph'st, and say'st that thou Find'st not thyself nor me the weaker now. 'Tis true ; then learn how false fears be ; Just so much honour, when thou yield'st to me, Will waste, as this flea's death took life from thee."

 Last night I had a long, twisting dream in which I wandered through my writing, editing and reading. Everything I read was littered with sticky words from pop-culture. In other words, everything I read--serious articles, fiction, non-fiction--looked just like my blog. The message I gleamed from the dream was that the lazy patterns I allowed to populate my blogs were infecting my other writing. It was a nightmare! I've always thought the language police style of reading and writing was so rigid, so stick-up-your-ass. Writing reflects the person behind the keyboard, and one way to reflect moods and personality is by bending the writing rules. Rules aren't really learned until one knows enough to bend them, right? Blogging has always been my medium for lazy writing. Elsewhere, I strive to write in a respectable voice, but the blogs are the bubblegum for my fingers: not nutritious, just fun. Sometimes I say they clean the pipes so the good stuff can flow in my "real" writing. Largely because my blogs are, for me, a huge social outlet, they reflect the way I talk. I guess that means I have a lazy way of talking. I know some part of my brain likes it that way, since my vocabulary is one of the only expressions of my youth. When I was always in offices, I liked the dissonance of being great at a formal adult job (which always required very stuffy, professional writing), dressing professional, and yet littering my phrases with colloquialisms of youth. These days no one sees the person behind the writing, be it blogging or submissions. I often find myself wearing a t-shirt and comfies through a morning of writing and child minding, then dressing quickly for a playdate at the park in clothes that might trick the thirty- and forty-something parents into thinking I'm one of them (so they'll talk to me), but I still get tripped up when I open my mouth. The lingo gives me away. Maybe I should switch it all up. Speak well, work well, but look crazy. I like that idea. I've been thinking of washing some indigo into my hair, I could re-pierce my belly button, and I think face piercings are way sexy. Oops! I mean, facial piercings exude sexual appeal. This is going to take some adjustment.

 this new interface may be nicer from a technical point of view, but it's really killing my blogging buzz. Somebody help! I just want the wide open interface back. I know, I know, you can't stepinto the same river twice. Nothing endures but change. So change it to something else already!

 I was saddened to hear this week that UHCL closed the Futures Studies Dept. Few opportunities exist, especially in this region, for a systems-based education. The Futures MS was original in its interdisciplinary and web approach to educating. The program's director, Peter Bishop, influenced the International Space University immeasurably (along with ISU's ragtag little sister, the Youth Advisory Committee that formed at UniSpace in Vienna), as well as the numerous employees of the space program and Houston industries who partook in a class or two, if not the degree while in Clearlake. Peter will land on his feet, but UHCL and its surrounding Clearlake community are most damaged by the loss. urlLink Overmorgen: 2004-04-03: University of Houston closes its future studies course : "I'm guessing that the future must have seemed a more viable prospect in the past.

I spent over a year completing the course over the turn of the century, and I was upset when I heard of its closure. Not that the news was wholly unexpected; the course managed to enroll 30-40 students but this wasn't enough to prevent it feeling small, with classes ranging from five to around 15 students. Not enough for the administration to keep it on the books when they could be concentrating on more populous courses, many of which, for some reason, attract large numbers of lucrative students from all over Asia. So now Peter Bishop, the remaining stalwart professor in the programme, is presumably looking for new prospects."

 urlLink The New York Times > Opinion > Killing Off Housing for the Poor : "Bush administration's tax cuts for the well-to-do have taken a heavy toll on the nation's most important social programs for the poor and working class. Prominent casualties include child care assistance for working mothers and federal aid for needy college students. The latest victim appears to be Section 8, the government's main housing program for the poor. The program provides rent subsidies for two million of the country's most vulnerable families and encourages private developers to build affordable housing. Section 8 subsidies go primarily to families that live at or below the poverty level, in households that include children, disabled people or the elderly. These families pay 30 percent of their incomes toward rent and the Section 8 vouchers pay the rest. Some cities give priority to battered women, many of them with children, who have to find a new place to live to escape danger. The need is so great that families often wait years for vouchers, which become available when voucher holders die or become ineligible after getting better jobs. Congress rejected an administration proposal that would have placed a financing cap on the program and turned the money over to the states. But the administration's assault continues, through the appropriations process in the House and through administrative rulings at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which has been trying to put the brakes on the voucher program. Last month, the department issued new guidelines to the country's 2,500 public housing agencies declaring that it would no longer pay the full cost of the vouchers but would cap the federal contribution at the level of August 2003, adding an adjustment for inflation."

The first, El Patio, was packed with white kids in backward baseball caps; the second, this biker joint, was almost all Latino.

 About once every month or two, I'm plagued with a wave of guilt that I'm not raising the children with a church family. We used to have a very dedicated place in church. For years in college I worked as a youthgroup leader. Even after college we found a church in a Houston suburb that we loved... right up until we got pregnant with our first kid. Then we found ourselves questioning the freakier of the church's values (values that are pretty ubiquitous here in Houston) such as the frequent statements against the National Endowment of the Arts, planned parenthood, strong women, and democrats. Primarily, we couldn't see raising our children in a church that kept women from equal participation, because we could never actively or passively teach our children that girls are somehow not as special and wonderful as boys. Additional problems, although not deal breakers, include that churches tend to have complicated bureaucratic organizational structures such as elders, laypeople, and committees. They vote on issues as if they were a democracy. Attending a new church usually involves standing up for some greeting time, which humiliates the hell out of me. Since we had kids, there's the added problem of churches that "strongly recommend" the kids leave for kid church during the message, and I'm not about to send my kids into a nursery on a visit, when I don't know the policy of hiring or acquiring volunteer workers. Plus, I prefer to nurse my Ellie through a service anyway since she's still sketchy about strangers. John's always looking for good music, and I'm always looking for a critical approach to scripture, but we've even dropped our standards regarding this. Finally, we don't want to drive to the burbs for services, since one of our new urban-esque family values is to find community close to home. And who wants to spend nearly an hour each way on the road during the precious weekend? Sometimes I wonder, if the Catholic Church gave up its position on women being priests, if we would go to Catholic church (as anti-membership as we are, I hesitate to say join). John and I were both raised with Catholic families, but chose protestant for ourselves. When we attend with family now, there's a lot I still like about it. The ritual, the tradition, the family focus... I doubt we'll take a huge roll in a church now, even if we find one to frequent. We're avid travelers, on the road about half of the weekends of the year. I'm probably recreating my formative normal here, since my family attended church once or twice a month when I was young. After all this, my guilt still takes me over. Even if I don't think a spiritual life is necessarily dependent on having a church, the church is a good focal point for spirituality. In its absence, we tend to lose our discipline and focus. Where should we go? What should I do?

This is the first place I've seen it said out that Splenda is actually more dangerous for diabetics than sugar. urlLink Idaho Observer: Splenda is not Splendid : "The manufacturer claims that the chlorine added to sucralose is similar to the chlorine atom in the salt (NaCl) molecule. This is not the case. Sucralose may be more like ingesting tiny amounts of chlorinated pesticides, but we will never know without long-term, independent human research. According to Consumers Research Magazine “Some concern was raised about sucralose being a chlorinated molecule. Some chlorinated molecules serve as the basis for pesticides such as D.D.T., and accumulate in body fat. However, Johnson & Johnson emphasized that sucralose passes through the body unabsorbed.” ...The FDA acknowledges that sucralose “is produced at an approximate purity of 98%.” While that may sound pretty pure, just what is in that other 2%? It turns out that the final sucralose product contains small amounts of potentially dangerous substances such as: * Heavy Metals (e.g., Lead) * Arsenic * Triphenilphosphine Oxide * Methanol * Chlorinated Disaccharides * Chlorinated Monosaccharide ...Few human studies of safety have been published on sucralose. One small study of diabetic patients using the sweetener showed a statistically significant increase in glycosylated hemoglobin (Hba1C), which is a marker of long-term blood glucose levels and is used to assess glycemic control in diabetic patients. According to the FDA, “increases in glycosolation in hemoglobin imply lessening of control of diabetes.” Research in animals has shown that sucralose can cause many problems in rats, mice, and rabbits, such as: * Shrunken thymus glands (up to 40% shrinkage) * Enlarged liver and kidneys. * Atrophy of lymph follicles in the spleen and thymus * Reduced growth rate * Decreased red blood cell count * Hyperplasia of the pelvis * Extension of the pregnancy period * Aborted pregnancy * Decreased fetal body weights and placental weights * Diarrhea"

If the Nader-Kerry total is a majority in any state, the victorious electors would be free to vote for Mr. Kerry. This plan is consistent with the original understanding of the founders. When they created the Electoral College, they did not anticipate the rise of the party system; they expected voters to select community leaders who would make their own judgments when casting their ballots for the presidency. In designating Kerry electors rather than insisting on his own slate, Mr. Nader would be giving new meaning to this tradition that refused to view electors as simply vehicles of a candidate's will. In effect, he would be enabling his supporters to rank their choices: Mr. Nader first, Mr. Kerry second. Over the centuries, the electors have become creatures of their parties, though they sometimes cast independent votes. Yet the Supreme Court has made only limited concessions to this reality. It has allowed political parties to protect the integrity of their mission by giving electors a place on their party's ticket only if they promise to vote for the candidates nominated at their national conventions."

Wall Street - with its beady eye on the forthcoming IPO - wants to know what Google does (and more importantly, what it plans to do next). Computer scientists, in contrast, want to know how Google does it. The two questions are different but increasingly, it seems, interlinked. At any rate, the technical community has begun to realise that presentations by Google techies have been run through some kind of corporate filter before they make it into Powerpoint. The operation of the filter is erratic (it's difficult for PR flacks effectively to censor geeks at the best of times), but it seems that the overall aim is to understate every aspect of Google's technology and technical performance by several orders of magnitude."

 I'm always reading six different books or more. Actually, I'm seriously going through front to back about three, and I find I've got another set that make up a sort of research fad, as I thumb through them several times a day as I write or whatever. In fact, I've opened up a whole bookshelf for the temperary rotation slot in an effort to rid my house of my many stacks of book fads. Maybe because I'm always reading multiple texts, and maybe b/c I, like Phil, don't have Google squatting behind my eyes, I've turned into a person who makes a lot of reading notes. I've got pages of word docs in disorganized spots on my hard drive from times that I actually make notes as I go through these books. Lately, I've been thinking of making a seperate blog--I wanted to call it booknotes or the margin or some such similarly quippy name--just to organize and share these notes. And damn it if Phil didn't beat me to it! urlLink Phil Gyford: Writing: External scaffolding : "I’m a forgetful man. I could tell you the names of most people in my classes at school or college, but when it comes to the contents of books or plots of films I’m usually stumped. I’ve often wondered whether it’s worth plodding through several hundred pages of a non-fiction book when a couple of weeks later I might only remember a couple of ideas. I deeply, deeply envy people who can rattle off quotes and references as if Google is squatting behind their eyes. So, in an effort to make something, anything, stick, I’ve started taking notes when I read non-fiction books. A few post-it notes nestled inside the cover are a convenient place to scribble thoughts and summaries. Later I type these up so I can still read them in the future, so I can search them, so I can back them up, and in the hope that the repetition will hammer a few more facts into place. Given I have the notes in digital form I thought I might as well put them online; a couple of hours work in setting the weblog up means I can access my notes from anywhere and search them easily, making them a much more accessible form of external scaffolding (a term I picked up from Small Pieces Loosely Joined). There’s always a chance someone else will find them useful too. Having only done three books so far it’s hard to tell how things will settle down (assuming I keep this going), but I expect the notes will be a mixture of the points I found most interesting and attempts at a complete summary. We’ll see how it goes."

 My friend--who has now outed herself as Marianne--was pretty urlLink insistent in comments that soy was definitely contributing to her feeling bad. I don't know what, if any, meds she's on, but I did find urlLink this Dr. Weil article that says people taking Synthroid experience a heightened sensitivity to soy disrupting their thyroid. It also says the same effect could theoretically happen with a few other raw vegetables, but soy seems to be the main culprit. I was inspired to delve deeper into soy after reading my urlLink most recent issue of Mothering , which had a damning article on all foods soy. urlLink Dr. Weil says this in response to the recent wave of anti-soy articles: "All told, I find the epidemiological data on soy foods very reassuring. I still recommend one serving a day of whole soy foods such as one cup of soy milk or one half cup of tofu, soy protein (tempeh), or crispy soy nuts. At those amounts (about 40 milligrams of isoflavones) you'll get the benefits of soy without the theoretical risks of taking in excess isoflavones. I do not recommend soy supplements because of their high isoflavone content and the lack of epidemiological evidence for their long-term safety, especially if taken on top of soy foods and isoflavone -spiked nutraceuticals." The funniest irony was noted first by my husband, who questioned the editorial wisdom of following the anti-soy article with an article titled, "Medical Marijuana: A Surprising Solution to Severe Morning Sickness." Clearly the health benefits of each could stand some critical thinking on behalf of the American family, but each article says, in absence of the right research, one is dangerous and the other is safe. The moral of the story is that stakeholders abound, and editorial boards are not sources of absolute rights and wrongs, but rather media for the transfer of information. I'd like to say the same about my blogs. Information can never hurt, only the misuse and misunderstanding of information can. I feel more wise for having heard both sides of this story, but as of yet, I'm not exactly throwing soy out of our family diet. urlLink Textured soy protein maybe, but not soy.

 urlLink cadence90 : "I also realized that having a second baby basically meant that I had strapped a few sticks of TNT to my old career and pushed the plunger. By the time Joe will be ready for preschool, I'll have been out of the job market for five years. Basically, I'll have to start all over again. My mother always says, 'Even a broken clock tells the right time twice a day.' The nice thing, as I see it, about this situation is this: I get a do-over. I have a nice pat story about my 'career,' but like a lot of people, what I really had is a series of jobs that I wheedled my way into, many of which did not lead logically to one another (unless the logic is to secure a paycheck in order to continue to pay rent). I did very well at many of my jobs, because I worked very hard... I have a unique opportunity, now, to actually think about what I want to do and plan for it. What I'd like to do during this time (in my copious spare time!) is to start a few projects. Maybe some of them will grow into something really good; there's no way to know except to try them. Some of them I've already begun. Some I haven't even thought of yet. Some are on the drawing board. I can't really imagine going back to what I used to do; or at least how I used to do it. Like Halley, I don't want to go back to the old way. It's not just dislike, either: many times I thought how I worked was going to end up killing me. Although it was strange, and hard, to stay home at first, and not be in the adrenaline-and-caffeine fuelled thick of things anymore, I feel like for every year I stay home I'm adding two years onto my life. It might not work out, but I've got my lottery ticket. If I win I get to do something I like in a way that won't kill me."

 Spent the weekend with the heater on. I think that's a first for May first here in our little house. Friday, when John got home from work, we hit the streets for a full evening of urban adventuring. Somehow, Ellie's gotten easier to carry in the sling (she straddles her legs and holds herself to me more naturally now, John says she even matches our walking rhythm) so I packed her on, and the four of us took off. As we walked down the street to the lightrail, it occurred to me that living this close to the heart of the city was a fair trade for our trials with burglary. Not that the two should be linked, statistically speaking, we live in the lowest crime district in the whole city. Just not our block. We met the nicest couple in a park along Fannin between Herman and Rice. Gretchen Sweene and her husband with some un-rememberable last name, visiting from Dallas with their 18-month-old daughter. Then, we walked over to Miller Outdoor Theater where it was Caribbean Night. I feel bad for the students from Lamar High, whose teacher somehow thought their annual musical--which was some sick melding of Oh! Pioneers and Cool Running --was appropriate in this venue. Other than these well-meaning kids, the whole thing rocked. We met another father who brought his two sons, a soccer ball, and a bike on training wheels. I--with Ellie still slinged--engaged happily in a game of soccer with Aidan and the younger son, and the dad's older son took to rocketing down the giant hill behind the grass area at Miller on his bike, training wheels whizzing so loud I was sure the whole thing would burst. It was a good lesson in parenting for me, b/c I thought it was unbelievable dangerous, faster and wilder than any ride I would myself risk, much less allow a four-year-old to try. But the kid loved it, and he stayed on almost every time, and the one time he fell (a bad looking fall, plunging over the handle bars into the grass), he got up without so much as a yelp. As we wandered our way through the city homeward, we commented on the pregnant air and heavy ocean clouds, sure it would rain. And it did, at least 8 inches or so! We were lucky to enjoy a bit of outdoors when we did, b/c all of Saturday we were locked indoors. Poor John tried to get out at one point to take the kids to the concrete canoe on the Bayou thing, only to run all the way home, with the whole lot drenched. Finally this front moved in and pushed out the ocean rain, and left us with 50 degree overnight lows! So May's off to a great start, with New Mexico wind jet streaming over us! Happy May, all.

 was happy to see another perspective of a theme I often consider. time is short enough, why should the workplace get it all? On the other hand, I piss away so much time between watching the kids and watching daytime TV, and when I do get some scheduled time for me (read: John or Yolanda come so I can go write), my mind is so numbed from pissing away all that time that I'm hardly struck by the muse. Back in the office days, I liked pissing away time best of all. I'd finish a project super quick so I could go gossip over someone's celeb 'zine. Now that I'm doing this work-at-home mom thing, I'm sick of pissing away time. I need to use my time much more wisely. That's my May Day resolution.

This is in fact the American Way, as far as I can tell: jobs just keep expanding and expanding until now, a lot of people don't find a 60-hour workweek to be that shocking, although they should, and there's this pressure to use time, to be doing something with it -- I mean, think of women's magazines, and all the stuff they're always encouraging us to do in those fifteen minutes of unscheduled time.

 When I was growing up, I always felt like the 22nd of June was the saddest day of the year. My birthday had passed, and more importantly, the anticipation leading up to my birthday had passed. Never in the whole year would I be further from my birthday than on the day after it. I have memories of counting down the minutes with friends as we neared the end of my wonderful day. As I've gotten older, the anticipation leading up to my birthday has lessened a little, but not altogether. I still love the solstice, and the peaceful feeling of the world on the longest day of the year. This year was a little bit of a downer because the family was so shell-shocked from Aidan's sick week, and hunkering in the bunker still in preparation for Ellie's go with it. It was hard to enjoy staying home with the knowledge that we were almost experiencing the solstice at Chaco Canyon, with the carefully architectured light rays shining through the dwelling as they do only on the summer and winter solstices. The benefit of less anticipation seems to be less letdown when the excitement passes, because I didn't wake up today with a feeling of dread when I realized it was the day after my birthday. I can't say I feel older, either. Mostly I'm just ready to be in New Mexico!

 I give myself the gift of blog! It's not exactly a blog, except it is. urlLink Go see for yourself .

 A houseguest/fellow blogger mentioned recently in passing the way my blog will fall silent for a few days, and then burst with a flurry of articles or posts within an hour. Here's why: I blog while momming. When I can dedicate myself to writing, I hardly want to spend it blogging pop culture and journal entries. Sorry, I love you guys, but I'm a writer first and a blogger second. When I can't dedicate myself to writing, it's invariably because I'm busy taking care of the children. At these times I often multitask reading online newspapers and other blogs while playing cooking or building blocks. When I come across something particularly interesting, I set that browser window aside and move on. Then, if I get a minute long enough to blog (often these come only once every few days), I go back over the set aside articles and blogs and, typically with the blog this button on the google toolbar, put them on the blog. Hence, the blogging flurries. Since John began urlLink the spaceboy back in January, it's been notoriously neglected. Not by any means has John quit reading all his space- and planetary-oriented articles, and I usually find them burried in browser windows when I sit down to read my stuff. I've taken to occasionally posting them to the spaceboy before killing the window. Hence, the spaceboy's getting article posts again. You can tell if I've posted or if John has (as if he would!) by the ID at the bottom of the post. Finally, this blog has obviously been suffering from a lack of attention. I can tell by my page hits, which have plummeted, and the comments, which are few and far between. I have only myself to blame as I've been spending much more attention on urlLink the SprogBlog lately than the Same River Twice. What can I say? Life has been very kid-centered lately. The SprogBlog rewards me with hits and comments, and I don't feel like I'm competing in a pool of the blogosphere already saturated with pop culture musings. There are very few young moms blogging. Consequently, this blog has seen a lot of article postings, but little commentary and the SprogBlog gets plenty of both. I'm not abandoning this blog, but if you want more personal info, visit the SprogBlog.

 urlLink Score One for the Little Guys - Mar. 12, 2004 : "These little underdogs will hardly make the SUV obsolete. Yet from cramped cities to congested suburbs, models like BMW's Mini Cooper make a point that many Americans still won't concede: Small cars make a lot of sense. They save money and fuel, pollute less and typically offer more smiles per mile than their bulky brethren. 'We've gotten so locked into power and size, but people are rediscovering that light and small can be more fun,' says Honda spokesman Andy Boyd. Emboldened in part by the Mini's big success -- Americans bought more than 36,000 last year, far above BMW's rosiest forecasts -- Honda is considering offering its Honda Fit here. The subcompact hatchback, Japan's best-selling car in 2002, delivers 40 miles per gallon and could sell for around $10,000."

 CS Monitor picked ten commencement speeches to highlight. I was thrilled to see Jon Stuart's since I'd intended to google it all week! urlLink 'Roll up your sleeves. Let the work begin.' | csmonitor.com : "Jon Stewart Host of 'The Daily Show' on Comedy Central The College of William & Mary, Williamsburg, Va. (Class of 1983) When I left William and Mary, I was shell-shocked. Because when you're in college, it's very clear what you have to do to succeed. You knew what you had to do to get to this college and to graduate from it. But the unfortunate, yet truly exciting thing about your life is that there is no core curriculum. The entire place is an elective. The paths are infinite and the results uncertain. And it can be maddening to those that go here, because your strength has always been achievement. So if there's any real advice I can give you, it's this. College is something you complete. Life is something you experience. So don't worry about your grade or the results or success. Success is defined in myriad ways, and you will find it, and people will no longer be grading you, but it will come from your own internal sense of decency which I imagine, after going through the program here, is quite strong. Although I'm sure downloading illegal files ... but, nah, that's a different story. Love what you do. Get good at it. Competence is a rare commodity in this day and age.

 urlLink The New York Times > Magazine > The Virtue in $6 Heirloom Tomatoes : "To customers familiar with the company, which is poised to become one of the 500 largest businesses in America (it is currently 508 on Fortune's list) and which recently began a conspicuous invasion of New York with a spectacular store at Columbus Circle and soon-to-come emporiums in Union Square and Park Slope, Whole Foods still carries a patchouli whiff, a lingering reputation for being crunchy and countercultural and somewhat earnest. Mackey says he thinks this is amusing as well as mistaken. His customers are not alt-lifestyle types, Mackey says; nor does ethnicity or geography define them. The company is growing at a steady clip in the South and Midwest; it has increasingly wide appeal in Asian, Hispanic and African-American communities, and it will open a store next year in center-city Oakland. Mackey's market research suggests that Whole Foods doesn't appeal to any unique demographic these days other than highly educated people who are willing to spend more on what they eat. The prices have lent the chain its unflattering nickname: Whole Paycheck. Yet just as it is inexact to dismiss Whole Foods as hippie artifact, it is simplistic to ascribe its growth to the country's swelling class of luxury-seeking elites."

 Last week urlLink Bill Cosby gave a speech that was incensing to say the least upon accepting an NAACP award in Washington, D.C. I thought about this speech quite a bit, but was too removed from my computer to blog it. With apologies, I'm p-blogging it now, and as always, I invite commentary. Call it white guilt if you must, but when I was driving to Galveston last Tuesday morning and heard for the first time excerpts from Mr. Cosby's speech, my first reaction was one of horror. His words sounded jaded and hurtful. On an occasion dedicated to honoring the accomplishments of African Americans as exhibited through his own life, Bill Cosby tore down his fellow race. What's more, he attacked the aspects of the black culture that are most unique to black culture. It felt like cheap shots pulled in an intimate fight with a loved one. Similarly, many voices in the black community were unable to accept the message on the grounds that it felt urlLink like airing dirty laundry . Perhaps most hurtful was the way the urlLink conservative right voice , primarily through radio programs, caught onto and championed Bill Cosby's words. In some of his speech, Cosby attacked attributes of poverty that simply aren't the causative factors he assumes them to be. For example, he said poor parents shouldn't be buying their children fancy sneakers. This is a famous misconception. According to the Consumer Expenditure Survey, as charted in urlLink The Two Income Trap , discretionary income for the average family income is actually lower (at $17,045/year) than it was in the early 1970s (then $17,834), even after inflation was adjusted. The authors explain that instead of causing budget problems, discretionary spending (for example, eating out and buying nice shoes) is for many the primary windfall in tough financial times, because it's an easy budget line to squeeze. Instead of the sneakers, modern budget problems can be blamed on skyrocketing mortgage costs, the second family car, childcare, and healthcare. The remainder of the speech focuses on black dialect. As an anthropologist, and as a parent in a city with a culturally silenced African American majority, I don't want every one to melt into one dialect or one acceptable appearance. I celebrate pluralism to the degree that I actively chose a blended neighborhood in which I raise my children. I think hip-hop is currently the most creative music genre. I listen to the Gray Album with my children alongside U2 and Mozart. And yet, I am certain I would not allow my children to speak in a dialect of slang were I black because as a white parent, I actively avoid slang, I teach my children not to use it. I don't let them say um-huh or uh-uh , and because they mimic me, I try not to say how come or y'all . I want to foster an attitude within my children of respect and appreciation toward education, even at the level of communication. I want their words to be edifying and purposeful. I want their vocabularies to be rich and diverse. This isn't an easy parenting task in a culture that views an educated presidential candidate as dull compared to the bumbly, slang-speaking candidate. Similarly, I'm sure parenting black children to speak with plain, clear words isn't easy when all the black cultural heroes of our time are celebrating their diversity primarily through these linguistic affectations Bill Cosby says will prevent black children from becoming doctors or lawyers. In the rearview mirror of history, angry speeches don't seem to hold the cultural attention span for long. We don't remember, though there were many, the angry speeches of Dr. Martin Luther King. With the possible exception of the fiery sermons of Cotton Mather, as a culture we cleave to the positive, uplifting, and soothing speeches--the Gettysburg Address, the Kennedy call to serve our country. For this reason, if no other, I feel Bill Cosby took the wrong approach in his attempt to guide the course of his race. This reflects a desire I have for my own cultural elders: gentle, open arms to catch salty tears of younger ones. Life is hard enough, especially for the families struggling to break the class barriers Cosby mentioned. I don't need another angry, older, crotchety voice telling me what I'm doing wrong, and that is basically what Bill Cosby did at the NAACP.

 urlLink The New York Times > Movies > Hijacking Harry Potter, Quidditch Broom and All : "Friday night 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' sold out theaters all over the globe. But in a makeshift screening room in a Brooklyn warehouse, more than 75 filmgoers paid $7 each to watch the first film in the series, 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.' Sort of. On the screen 'The Sorcerer's Stone' played as it was released by Warner Brothers. But the original soundtrack, dialogue and all, was turned down and replaced by an alternate version created by a 27-year-old comic book artist from Austin, Tex., named Brad Neely. He calls his soundtrack 'Wizard People, Dear Reader,' and it is one more breach of the media industry's control of its products."

 Last month Teacher Appreciation Week came and left before I could blog my intended commentary on the occasion. Since teachers are too important to let slip by, even in my elapsing world, I'm p-blogging this post. Just pretend it's still early May (I wish!). I imagine the poor pay, cheeky attitudes, and hapless parents teachers wade through all year long are to some degree mitigated by the hope that their words will somehow stick with even one of their students. And in my life so many teachers' words still guide me.When I look back at individuals who were most influential, who played a key role in the path I took, teachers comprise the overwhelming majority. I'm amazed to think of how many special people I found in my small town, Tucumcari, NM, and later in college at UT El Paso. In a small attempt to say thank you, here's my teachers' hall of fame: Mrs. Hall , 6th grade homeroom: Mrs. Hall helped to undo the damage by a particularly bad 5th grade teacher, Mrs. Flynn. Mrs. Hall gave me her home phone number for summer, because she knew my parents were going through some hard times. She introduced me to funky science fiction and Rudyard Kipling through a special, by invitation only lunchtime reading group. She sneakily called my parents and told them not to pick me up after school when I fell behind in my homework. Shug Johnston , 7th grade English: I still remember the day class schedules for junior high were handed out and my friends sympathetically moaned at the sight of Mrs. Johnston on my paper. She was famous for being a real hardass. As it turned out, she was strict, but fun. I got the highest grade I think I got in all of junior high in her class, and I know I later clepped out of Freshman English in college entirely on the grammatical stronghold I gained from Mrs. Johnston. She taught me the joy that is diagramming sentences. Later, as I got my first job as a technical writer for the MFA,H, I still called upon the comical way she explained when to use its, its', and it's. Larry Chavez , junior high and high school track coach: Mr. Chavez always surprised me by tricking me into running farther than I thought I could have run. I remember the first time I ran to Tucumcari mountain and back to the high school, and how great it felt to accomplish the feat. I remember when I felt like I had to stop and walk, Chavo would put his hand on the small of my back, not really pushing, but just supporting. We came to call it the Chavo push, and it inevitably got us over the hump of fatigue. I didn't appreciate the joy and value running added to my life until after high school, when I had to run on my own volition rather than a coach's. To this day when I go for a run, I think of those long journeys with Mr. Chavez. Dave Bergren , 9th grade Political Science: Mr. Bergren was the first to call me a screaming liberal. And he was the first to make me love the term. He organized the annual Close-Up trip to Washington, D.C. and I was lucky enough to attend as Freshman because we were able to see Bill Clinton's first inauguration. Needless to say, the event galvanized my interest in politics and public policy. Mr. Bergren did a great job of explaining the political processes of our crazy country, including one of my favorite lessons: why people run for president even if they don't have a shot (to shape the election policies discussed in debates and media events and, hence, influence the agenda of the candidate that does win). Mr. Bergren helped inoculate me from the series of disastrous history classes my high school offered via the football and wrestling coaches, during which watching movies and playing games substituted for actual tutelage. Lana Enox , 9th and 10th grade English: Ms. Enox introduced me to my favorite and most influential book, Cry, the Beloved Country . Her carefully chosen texts and the gentle way in which she introduced them encouraged me to minor in literature later in college. I should also acknowledge the high school teachers at the school my boyfriend attended! His name was Bryan Conkling, and he went to a progressive private school in Santa Fe, and, over the course of about a year and a half, would read me his texts late at night over the telephone. As he read the Little Prince or Machiavelli, I discovered my deep love for philosophy and the classics. My parents got a bargain in paying high phone bills rather than his tuition! I know I wouldn't be the person I am today without that early educational influence. Quality college professors were naturally more abundant. They included my advisor and friend, Dr. David Carmichael; my sociology professor, Dr. Cheryl Howard; the creators of UTEP's humanities series, Drs. Wren and Johnson; the director of the biology lab I worked in (I forgot his name!); and the director of the UTEP Honors Program, Dr. Lillian Mayberry. Dr. Craig White (minority literature) and Dr. Peter Bishop (Social Change Theory) were also great professors I was fortunate to encounter at UHCL.

 urlLink Guardian Unlimited | World dispatch | Autopian dream : "'Where are all the people?' my three-year-old son asks as we drive around Los Angeles (and often just a quarter of a mile to the local grocery store). After three months here, he has learnt the two answers: 'They're in their buildings', and 'they're in their cars'. Los Angeles can be an eerie, solitary place for somewhere so crowded. There is something almost unnatural about living in an urban environment with so many human artefacts but so few signs of actual people. But that's the way the city has been designed, ever since the car proclaimed itself ruler of the place. In 1928, LA averaged one car for every 2.9 people - the ratio is probably the reverse today - and city planning was dictated by the need to accommodate commuters and shoppers driving in from the suburbs. By the 1940s the first LA freeways were upon us, and by 1971 Reyner Banham was using the phrase 'autopia' in his wonderful study Los Angeles: The Architecture of Four Ecologies. As he noted, 'The private car and the public freeway together provide an ideal - not to say idealised - version of democratic urban transportation: door-to-door movement on demand at high average speeds over a very large area.'"

For Indians wanting to witness the event, the moon will rise slightly after 1800 IST and set at around 0400 IST, M P Birla Planetarium Scientific Director Debiprosad Duari said. Since there are roughly 29.5 days between full moons, it is unusual for two full moons to 'fit' into a 30 or 31 day month, Duari explained. The last such occurrence happened in November 2001. In 1999, there were two blue moon occurrences on January 1 and 31 and March 2 and 31. The next blue moon will appear in June 2007."

 I'm so glad to hear this, as I've been addicted to tanners and bronzers for years. I even used them sometimes, and with a good deal of guilt b/c I hadn't heard anything like this, while pregnant. Some people say they know it's going to rain if they wash their car. Up until last week, I've never had a car nice enough to keep clean. Instead, I know it's going to rain if I put on a tanner. Dr. Weil distinguishes between tanners and bronzers, but in truth, most products are both. And if you, say, run after a bus in the rain after applying one, you look like, as my friend Serena told me yesterday, a leper. urlLink DrWeil.com Question: Are Self-Tanners Dangerous? : "Self-tanners the lotions, sprays and gels that you apply for a sunless tan aren't dangerous.

The effect lasts for only a few days because the skin naturally sheds the dead cells that have been colored. Except for rare cases of irritation and allergic reaction, the products are safe."

 If only, like, _the entire_ supreme court wasn't about to up and die or selectively retire, I'd agree whole hog that the next four years are bound to be so rotten (with the only military options as a draft or a tail between the legs retreat from Iraq, the economic realities of globalism coming home to roost, and the end of oil as we know it) it's best not to have the Democratic name on them.

Watching last night, I half expected part of his face to melt away and reveal a cyborg controlled by Joe Trippy in the wings. Of course he's got a campaign blog and last night's open thread on the speech required two separate entries to accommodate the comments, 324 and 417 respectively.

 As Howard Dean delivered what must have been outtakes from his expected acceptance of the nomination speech, but in support of a Kerry vote rather than the Dean vote, I was struck by a man stripped down to himself. There was no Joe Trippy, no James Carville, just Dr. Howard Dean, cheered on by, as he called them, the Democratic wing of the Democratic Party. Stripped down to himself, Howard Dean revealed Joe Trippy as the unnamed, unknown soldier behind the reignition of the liberal party. After all, it was Trippy who conceived of the $100 solution. And it was Trippy who supported blogging. Did he waste these ideas on Dean? I know I won't ever be so quick to donate $25 to a political campaign. In fact, I'd like to have a few of those hits at the bat back now that Howard gave up so easily. Still, it was comforting and nostalgic to see Howard Dean at the mic tonight. I only wish he'd been accepting the nomination instead of stumping for Kerry.

 Last weekend, urlLink one time blogger and fellow 1977 birth baby Ricky Williams urlLink announced a very unexpected retirement from his career in the NFL. Reactions urlLink have been varied to say urlLink the least . Because of his tireless power on the line and because of his urlLink sure position as a starter/big income earner, the retirement is especially inigmatic to the sports world. Among bloggers, the jacks of all trade, all too often uncomfortable with the idea of mastering any field, Ricky's par for the course. Ricky's blog remains silent, so we're left with the explanation of his mother: urlLink AP Wire | 07/26/2004 | Mother of Ricky Williams discusses son's sudden retirement : "'I don't even think Ricky knows what he wants to do right now.

 The conventions are stupid and I've given up on politics anyway. That said, why can't we re-elect Jimmy Carter? The Democratic Party has been running from Carter since he lost his bid for re-election. In fact, this is the first time he's spoken at a Democratic Convention since his nomination. But tonight they came home. Tonight Carter stuck on the Kerry/Edwards ticket like PB on J. He grasped the Navy connection and played it for all it was worth, and it ended up being worth about three Bush service jokes. Jimmy Carter looks like a man humbled in the sight of his Maker, like he still has blisters on his hands from the day's efforts to house the poor. He stands in awe of all he cannot accomplish and hunches over under the weight of his failures. In my truest moments, I've understood a small part of what he feels. In our age of all-too-public religious experienced politicians, Carter's conviction is rare. And in this light of religious conviction, I found myself wondering if Carter was stumping or praying as he said, "The biggest reason to make John Kerry president is even more important. It is to safeguard the security of our nation. Today our dominant international challenge is to restore the greatness of America, based on telling the truth, a commitment to peace and respect for civil liberties at home, and basic human rights ." Once shunned as too far from the center, Carter was now called upon to give the thesis statement of the Kerry/Edwards campaign. Carter continued: "Truth is a foundation of our global leadership but our credibility has been shattered. And we are left increasingly isolated and vulnerable in a hostile world. Without truth, without trust, America cannot flourish. Trust is at the very heart of our Democracy--a scared covenant between a president and a people. When that trust is violated, the bonds that hold our Republic together begin to weaken." These words were delivered and after one more sentence regarding 9/11, the stadium erupted in cheers. Was it a cue? Do the people in that stadium really care about the liberal foundations of policy before violence? Are they merely cheering on the cue cards? Since the party has turned its back first on Ralph Nader and then on Howard Dean, I find myself doubting all. But Jimmy Carter is the missing link that I could believe in. He's the road from Clinton/Gore back to Kerry/Edwards. We have yet to see if Carter is merely a sidelined bit player. In my fantasies, Carter is the Kerry/Edwards' Secretary of State, and they announce this in their campaign in their efforts to prove themselves dependent on the power of the word over the power of the bullet. I hesitate to say this, but such a move could actually pull my Nader vote back to the Democratic ticket. We'll see. I bet they don't have the guts.

 urlLink From Tall in the Saddle to Fatter Than Cattle : "...the shocking truth is that U.S. life expectancy is a distant 28th in the world, according to University of Munich researchers John Komlos, PhD, and Marieluise Baur. Their report appears in the March issue of Economics and Human Biology. 'The hypothesis is worth considering that this adverse development is related to the greater social inequality, and inferior health care system, and fewer social safety nets in the United States than in Western and Northern Europe, in spite of higher per capita income,' Komlos and Baur write. The researchers suggest that the welfare states of Western and Northern Europe -- much maligned in the U.S. -- may actually be providing a healthier standard of living than the U.S. system. Komlos and Baur admit that Americans have a higher per capita income. But Europeans, they note, are guaranteed a subsistence income as well as cradle-to-grave health care. At least those of us who can afford it get better health care, right? Not necessarily. The researchers note that even fully insured Americans are more dissatisfied with their health care than Europeans. 'The richest are by no means the tallest or the healthiest, or live longest,' Komlos and Baur conclude. 'They do appear, however, to be among the most overweight.'"

In a flash, Mr. Rubin decided to buy the building, gut it and make a new museum in Manhattan, a glittering showcase for a reclusive spiritual art from the other end of the earth. The Rubin Museum of Art opens on Oct. 2 with kite flying on the West Side piers, a Himalayan dog parade and some 100 fluttering prayer flags by contemporary artists.

 John's conference ended yesterday, so today we drove south to spend the rest of our weekend in beautiful Taos. We always seem to bring the rain here, and today is no exception. The temperature is in the 50s and big rain clouds keep rolling in off Taos Mountain. It's really beautiful, but I had wished to squeeze in an afternoon hike for the family. Aidan awoke from his nap just as we drove into the valley and upon seeing Taos Mountain, he recognized it from his urlLink big Williams Lake adventure and began begging to go again. Not this time, but I'm psyched at his attitude toward hiking. We arrived at Taos about an hour ago and I had John drop me off at Wired Cafe, which has free wi-fi, assuming you at least buy a cup of tea or coffee. I eagerly checked my mail and found a positive response to a publication query that had been on the fence for a few weeks. I'm so excited! It's with urlLink Mothering Magazine , and I've offered to meet with them in person regarding the article so we may end up staying in Santa Fe.

 Here in Colorado everyone is unduly worried about West Nile. Just in case this fear is going further than CO, I want to help get the word out on 1) West Nile is not very dangerous at all, in fact it acts like the flu, as it's really dangerous only to the immuno-compromised, and 2) the sprays for West Nile are actually worse for the population on the whole than the virus. urlLink Blowing the Whistle on West Nile 8/31/02 : "DEET, Anvil, and other toxic pesticides are aggressively promoted to protect the public from a mosquito bite that appears to be, statistically, less dangerous than a dog bite or bee sting. And the CDC seems to agree. On its website it says, 'Human illness from West Nile virus is rare, even in areas where the virus has been reported. The chance that any one person is going to become ill from a mosquito bite is low.' Since 1999 only a handful of deaths per year have been associated with West Nile, even though the virus has been found in 33 states. The fact that this 'health crisis' has been exaggerated, and that chemical spraying is usually the least effective yet most toxic way to control mosquitoes, has deterred some state officials, but not others. The New York State Health Department backed away from recommending wholesale spraying after finding that more people got sick from the pesticides than from the virus."

 Staying with my relatives has left me in a pensive mood for the week. I can in no small part thank my Tucumcari aunt for influencing the course of parenting John and I took. She was the first and only woman I saw breastfeeding as I grew up. I still remember her shooting milk across the room to get a rise out of me. When I was pregnant she sent me Penelope Leech and La Leche League books. It was she who influenced my bio-pop and step mom to homeschool, as she did and continues today. My aunt and uncle in Fort Collins have themselves become grandparents three times over in the last three years. Accordingly, I find them and their home greatly changed. Their home was designed with a stately style, with wood floors and huge floor rugs, thoughtfully upholstered furniture intermingles with dark woods and antiques. A parlor room houses the piano and the ticks of a grandfather clock echo through the downstairs. Only now, fine knickknacks are almost entirely elevated out of children’s reach and the wood floors’ decorations include bright plastic toys. As a child we visited these relatives often. Together with my aunt and uncle’s three daughters, I must have grandly descended the stairs a thousand times in pretense as either a groom or a bride. But I’m sure that then my aunt had the same theories regarding decor that my mother did, that children had to learn to keep their hands off furniture and fine pieces, rather than removing them for the duration of their childhood. And so I find myself in farcical dissonance with my memory of deep respect for the sacred order of the house (and fear of disrupting it) alongside my relief that somewhere along their life journeys, my relatives learned to be wonderful grandparents. It’s a difficult observation because my own parents are here, and I’m forced to double the reflection to them. I suppose they too deserve this honor, but I’m reluctant to give it to them. Why? I always want more from them than what they give. I want them to more thoroughly dedicate their time and resources to their grandchildren. I want them to wallow on the floor in wild games of child-led fantasy. I want them to abolish their child-unfriendly decor and fence their pool in, or better yet, fill it in with dirt.

 I’m so rotten at being away from John. Yesterday I left him at his conference in Colorado Springs, spent an hour or so hiking Garden of the Gods, and then headed north to Fort Collins, Colorado where my aunt and uncle Shelley live and where my parents were planning a rendezvous with the kids and me. Politically, Colorado is a bit like Texas, only with mountains. Even the mountains are encroached upon with development to a tearful degree because the conservative atmosphere values private over public property. It’s enough to make me glad for once that Texas has virtually no mountains and few truly beautiful natural areas, because this similar political atmosphere would have met tragic ends under compassionate conservatism. Culturally, Colorado seems a little lost between the blue collar working man, and the white collar business class that passes policies like 3/2 beer in an effort to protect the working man from himself. 3/2 beer has become a bit of an analogy in itself here. Why! American beer is watery enough, without further de-intensifying it. I’m sure Colorado is far more lovely than I impart here. I’m just grumpy without John. It’s a pretty big problem. Why can’t I be happy and relaxed without him? The kids and I are just off our game. We miss our dado.

 The most direct route from Houston to Colorado Springs cuts north across the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles, but anyone who knows us knows any trip within a few hundred miles of New Mexico is a perfect excuse to spend some time in New Mexico. We stayed last night in Tucumcari, where I was born and grew up, with my uncle and his family--my last familial connections to the town that was once my whole universe. We’d planned on camping at Conchas Lake, but a huge storm rolled in with hail and high winds, so we happily accepted the offer to stay with relatives. This morning, still avoiding the northern turn, we drove west to Santa Rosa in search of breakfast at the delectable Comet Drive Inn, but the Comet eluded us, closed until 11, after mass. South of Santa Rosa by ten miles is a small town that was once the area’s county seat, named Puerto de Luna. Aside from being widely known as Billy the Kid’s favorite hangout, and as one of the oldest settlements in the area (just over 450 years old), Puerto de Luna, and the greater Luna Valley, provide the backdrop for Bless Me, Ultima. The village is beautiful, the valley’s landscape dramatically reveals it as the road winds alongside the Pecos River. The tall, silver bell tower of Our Lady of Refuge is the first sign of civilization in the rugged, rocky mesas. The mesas play as big a character as anyone in Bless Me, Ultima. I realize when I see them again after too long away that they played a huge roll in my own childhood as well, the llano.

 Here's how crazy we are. I was thinking we should buy a new car and I mentioned it to John. He said, we should do it before we go to Colorado next week. So we did. Here's our new car: urlLink The All New Volvo S40 Btw, the VW's off the table now. Traded it in. I realized some time ago that we will never be people without a car payment. It's a fixed expense for us. Every two or three years we get a different car, thereby staying under warranty and accomodating my changing taste and needs. If you want a used Volvo, check in here in about two to three years. As with most things, this puts us perfectly between my parents and John's. John's parents believe in always paying cash for a car, and just last week bought their first new car in the history of the family. My parents, on the other hand, get a new car nearly every year for one or the other of them. I'm excited for our purchase, mostly for the higher safety standard. We spend so much time on the road, I wanted to be sure the kiddos were very safe. Everyone says it. A Volvo is a tank. Cheers to tanks!

 My parents just ended a huge driving vacation through Canada, and are accordingly huge fans of all things Canadian right now.

 Michele, affectionately known as Michie, is my best friend, and the kids' godmother. Over a year ago she moved to Florida and I've missed her horribly since.

I met Michie years ago when she and John co-op'd together at NASA-JSC. I still remember our first big deep conversation on the roof of the Natural Science Museum on July 4th as we awaited the first downloads from Mars Pathfinder and watched the fireworks in Herman Park. She moved to Florida amid a giant career change from space engineering to medical and is now more than half way through her physician's assistant program.

 Everyone I know is at capacity. Some of them say it, others just look it, but we're all spent. We seem to make our lives so hard on ourselves in our collective efforts to live [more? better?]. I've learned to find sources of nourishment for my soul that help, chiefly there are two: New Mexico and John. And I've added one more unexpectedly: feminine companionship. Surprisingly, I find myself with good girlfriends that make me laugh and remind me to not be so hard on myself. Fresh with the memory of my stay in Taos, at the end of a hard week, but one full of get-togethers with the girls, and amid a lovely reconnecting time with my family, I'm happy to say that for this one moment, I'm not spent. In fact, I'm overflowing. My heart feels like it could burst with love when I look at the kids or John. They appear to have their own light source in them, they shine at me and I soak it up like sunlight after rain. I want to bottle this feeling so I can take it slowly when I need it. Because I know I will need it. The muddy slope, devoid of footholds, will certainly return as will the gray skies and pressure so heavy I'll walk bent over. I'll have dreams of being stuck underwater, and I'll awake feeling more tired than I was before falling asleep. But the feeling of right now cannot be bottled, so I'm just trying to soak up right now as long as right now lasts. God, I hope it lasts.

If you are working in a word processing document, it provides the same service. It also searches blogs. This function has just been added because Malik suggested it would be a good thing to do. 'I didn't appreciate the significance until he wrote the article and then I thought, 'Right, I get it',' she said disarmingly. Blinkx can also search digital TV on the internet, which, in practice, means video output from the BBC. Why? 'Because the BBC posts its digital TV free on the internet.'

As Houston's economy has diversified over the last 20 years, its ethnic makeup also evolved, with the number of whites dropping 6 percent in the 1990's as the number of Latinos grew 74 percent and the Asian population increased 76 percent. That growth has positioned Houston to compete internationally across a variety of industries, even if the energy business remains at the pinnacle of the economy, transformed into a 'knowledge industry' without the blue-collar jobs it was associated with in the past, said Stephen Klineberg, professor of sociology at Rice University."

 urlLink The New York Times > Health > Mental Health & Behavior > With Toughness and Caring, a Novel Therapy Helps Tortured Souls : "Dr. Linehan first developed the therapy as a way to help people with borderline personality disorder, an enigmatic and notoriously difficult condition to treat. Borderline patients are often severely self-destructive, cutting or burning themselves and attempting suicide. In therapy, they are often manipulative, mercurial, at times chillingly mute. They wear out therapists and try the patience of friends and family members. (The needy, compulsive, violent character played by Glenn Close in the 1987 movie 'Fatal Attraction,' who seduces a married man and then stalks him when he rejects her, exhibits borderline behavior, some say.) Some researchers believe that the disorder develops as a result of uncertain attachments to parents early in life. Others are searching for biological roots. One study, for example, found that borderline patients exhibited hyperactivity in the amygdala, a part of the brain involved in emotion regulation. Some patients, experts say, are helped by mood-stabilizing drugs. Yet dialectical therapy neither involves drugs nor concerns itself much with biology. It begins with an idea called radical acceptance, the insistence that people in therapy accept who they are and that they are not who they want to be. They cannot go back and repair their childhood, as awful as it might have been. They have blown precious relationships for good. Most of all, they experience waves of rage, emptiness and despair far more intensely than other people do."

The new movie, though, often seems to oppose Asimov's view. Spooner hates robots, and he may have good reason. So Asimov's old battles are being engaged yet again and may be worth thinking about because they touch on so much more than android design. Asimov's robots can certainly seem born of a more innocent, less knowing world: one loves hearing children's stories, another malfunctions by drunkenly going around in circles, a third may or may not be masquerading as a well-meaning human politician. Surely this gently imagined future is hopelessly eclipsed now that we have seen the killer android of 'Terminator 2' morph into any human shape out of blobs of mercury, or watched the machines of the 'Matrix' trilogy rule the post-apocalyptic earth, plugging humans into energy pods with elaborate software. The movie, as if troubled by its innocent origins, even tries to leave the book behind.

The boom in enrollment also meant a boom in construction jobs, and new educational facilities created other jobs -- from teachers to janitors, administrators to cafeteria workers. The college and university experience was dramatically democratized, broadened, and deepened as students from working-class and farm backgrounds were afforded the chance to go in large numbers to what had been havens for the elite."

Among its findings are that fewer than half of Americans over 18 now read novels, short stories, plays or poetry; that the consumer pool for books of all kinds has diminished; and that the pace at which the nation is losing readers, especially young readers, is quickening. In addition it finds that the downward trend holds in virtually all demographic areas."

 statistics review for everyone! urlLink The Sin of Wages - The real reason to oppose the minimum wage. By Steven E. Landsburg : "...Now that we've re-evaluated the evidence with all this in mind, here's what most labor economists believe: The minimum wage kills very few jobs, and the jobs it kills were lousy jobs anyway. It is almost impossible to maintain the old argument that minimum wages are bad for minimum-wage workers. In fact, the minimum wage is very good for unskilled workers. It transfers income to them. And therein lies the right argument against the minimum wage. Ordinarily, when we decide to transfer income to some group or another—whether it be the working poor, the unemployed, the victims of a flood, or the stockholders of American Airlines—we pay for the transfer out of general tax revenue. That has two advantages: It spreads the burden across all taxpayers, and it makes politicians accountable for their actions. It's easy to look up exactly how much the government gave American, and it's easy to look up exactly which senators voted for it. By contrast, the minimum wage places the entire burden on one small group: the employers of low-wage workers and, to some extent, their customers. Suppose you're a small entrepreneur with, say, 10 full-time minimum-wage workers. Then a 50 cent increase in the minimum wage is going to cost you about $10,000 a year. That's no different from a $10,000 tax increase. But the politicians who imposed the burden get to claim they never raised anybody's taxes. If you want to transfer income to the working poor, there are fairer and more honest ways to do it. The Earned Icome Tax Credit, for example, accomplishes pretty much the same goals as the minimum wage but without concentrating the burden on a tiny minority. For that matter, the EITC also does a better job of helping the people you'd really want to help, as opposed to, say, middle-class teenagers working summer jobs. It's pretty hard to argue that a minimum-wage increase beats an EITC increase by any criterion."

Firefox development and testing are mostly done by about a dozen Mozilla employees, plus a few dozen others at companies like IBM, Sun, and Red Hat.

 urlLink CNN.com - Bush declines NAACP invitation - Jul 8, 2004 : "NAACP spokesman John White said Wednesday that Bush has declined invitations in each year of his presidency -- becoming the first president since Herbert Hoover not to attend an NAACP convention.

 In the days after Bill Cosby's infamous speech, I urlLink posted my response on both blogs. Since then, I've looked into the matter a little further, and I feel the topic deserves a follow-up. First of all, Tavis Smiley, always a fantastic and professional interviewer, had Bill Cosby on his show the week after the Washington Post turned the speech into a media foray. Smiley's interview can be urlLink heard here (the audio's in two parts, be sure to listen to both) or urlLink read here , and it's well worth hearing in its entirety. In the interview, the most striking interchange is when Tavis Smiley asked Bill Cosby about the negative reactions to his speech. Bill Cosby had previously mentioned that the high school drop-out rate for African American students is at 50%, and in response to this question he said, "...somebody took issue and tried to say that I was excusing white people from what is supposed to be happening with fairness. I'm not. I'm saying, OK, Bill Cosby never said this. He never said a thing, OK? 2 years from now, wanna make a bet on 60%? Wanna make a bet on more deaths in the neighborhood than the police are doing?" When Smiley had Cornel West on his radio show--and I respect Cornel West as one of the most brilliant minds of our time--Cornel West said of Bill Cosby that he believed Cosby's words came from a good place in his heart. I only understood this comment after hearing the above-quoted words. When I lived in Germany, so many older Germans brought up to me WWII, even though I had no accusatory feelings toward them. They would bring forth apologetic-sounding stories that explained why they felt too afraid of Hitler's government to take a stand against it. A very old man in Aachen, heard Americans were visiting his neighbors and he came over to ask if he could take Mandy (another American exchangee) and me to the American military cemetery there. He wanted to show us how Aachen had given the highest, most beautiful land (in a region under the sea level, the highest land is a really big deal) dedicated to the servicepeople who helped defeat the Nazis. It was as if the guilt of not taking a stand, even in light of the assured death of any who did, against the Nazis back then was somehow atoned by better honoring the dead of those who did take the stand. Years later, this experience still haunts and inspires my actions. It is the primary reason why I tried so hard to prevent the military action again Afghanistan and the war against Iraq. Even then, especially then, I was certain history will shine light on the US government's false motives and misguided murders in the name of the state. How could I look my grandchildren in the eye as they studied our time without doing everything in my power to stop it? I protested in Houston, Austin, Santa Fe, Taos, and Washington D.C. alongside hundreds of thousands of likeminded men and women. I wrote letters to all my political representatives, including Cheney and Bush. In the end, I can't feel like my actions did anything to stop the war machine. To the contrary, every dyer prediction written on every protest poster has come to pass. No weapons of mass destruction, no reduction in global terrorism, countless casualties... In some sort of resigned grief, John and I could only give money to Doctors without Borders, UMCOR, and others who mitigate the consequences. My only solace is that at least I was not silent. This is the tie that binds Bill Cosby's speech to myself. One has to remember that Bill Cosby's son urlLink Ennis was killed in a violent, random assault in 1997. I'm sure that this, in no small way, pressures him to speak rather than remain silent. In urlLink Culture of Fear , Barry Glassner reported that African Americans are far more likely to be the victims of violent crime than the perpetrators. As the dropout rates prove, this is only one of many ways African Americans are falling like flies from the ranks of the manifest destiny America promises. I continue to believe Cosby failed to recognize the true causative factors regarding the status of African-Americans who drop out or even commit crimes. This is a point better stated and researched in an editorial in today's New York Times by Barbara Ehrenreich called urlLink Today's Cosby Kids . In the end, I don't agree with much of what he said, or even the venue in which he chose to share it. But I do understand why he felt he had to say it.

 I can only express gratitude in response to the obvious signs that the universe seems to be smiling on me this week. It's been building up for a while, but this week is amazing. I just walk around with a smile on my face, that's how reinforcing such a cycle can be! There are many ways in which things are going well, but the most bloggable is regarding my page ranks. Several weeks ago, my Google page ranks mysteriously increased, resulting in a funny and seemingly random series of search engine-generated site hits. I've always gotten a lot of hits for " urlLink Iron Jawed Angels Soundtrack " and " urlLink Sharon Osbourne adoption ," but now a google search on " urlLink bill cosby speech naacp " returns the SrogBlog as the 19th result, and a search for "bill cosby speech" returns it as the 34th result. That might not seem like such a big deal to you, but this will. A search on " urlLink jon stuart " yields The Same River Twice as the fifth resulting page hit. If only there's a way to turn this into something? If only I could put out Jon Stuart praises and in return he would help me find a book publisher or get me some network exec's ear! But no. In the new economy, links are the central unit of power. But this currency isn't accepted by the entertainment industry. Anyway, regarding Jon Stuart, congrats on the new baby. Ralph sort of let the cat out of your bag last night, but why keep such an amazing thing under wraps? Jon, if you read this (b/c we all google ourselves, right?), go to the SprogBlog for parenting advice, and keep watching for my ebook release of Sustainable Parenting (b/c I can't get a real publisher yet). Speaking of Mr. Stuart and his great wit, perfect timing, and wonderful writing staff on urlLink Comedy Central's the Daily Show , last night Stephen Colbert covered for the newly babied Jon Stuart. He was really, really funny. It was strange to see him manning the show, but he filled the chair well. I especially enjoyed his interview of urlLink Ralph Nader , considering Colbert is a little more out of the liberal closet than Jon. In the interest of equal time, their jokes regarding the Kerry/Edwards ticket were outstanding. Butt to Butt! Ha!Go watch it if you missed it, their web site is featuring it right now.

 urlLink New 'Stepford Wives' Fuels Old Anti-Career Views : "Most striking about the re-make of 'The Stepford Wives' movie--other than the irony that women now willingly dress much like the original Stepford wives--is the difference in the central character Joanna. The movie has changed from thriller to farce, making for plenty of audience laughs but also sacrificing the heart of the original movie and book. 'Rosemary's Baby' author Ira Levin wrote the book as a thriller. The appeal of a good thriller, of course, is that the protagonist is an everyday person, such as Jimmy Stewart in 'Rear Window' or Cary Grant in 'North by Northwest.' As in a good Hitchcock movie, Joanna is our everywoman in a small, safe town. We sympathize with her because it could happen to us. In the 1975 movie, Katharine Ross' Joanna was a very likable everywoman who wanted to resume her career in photography now that her children have started school. Seeing none of the other women in town shares her desire to pursue interests outside the home, Joanna thinks she's going crazy and eventually fears for her life..."

These sporadic adherers were also 42% more likely to die from all types of cancer than those following most of the guidelines. The nine guidelines to better ensure a cancer-free life are: Not smoking Avoiding excess weight and limiting adult weight gain to no more than 11 pounds from age 18 (they recommend having a maximum BMI (a measure of body fat) of less than 25) Getting daily moderate exercise and a vigorous workout at least once a week Eating at least five servings of vegetables and fruits each day Eating at least 14 ounces -- about seven portions -- of whole grains, cereals, and other complex carbohydrates each day, while limiting processed foods and refined sugar Limiting alcohol to one drink a day (for women) Limiting red meat to no more than 3 ounces daily Limiting intake of fatty food, particularly those of animal origin, to no more than 30% of total calories Limiting intake of salted foods and use of salt in cooking to less than 2,400 milligrams of sodium daily 'Furthermore, we estimate that if all the women in the study group had never smoked and followed a majority of the guidelines, approximately 30% of new cancers and cancer deaths could have been prevented or delayed,' explains Cerhan."

 urlLink Gwen introduced me to this conjugator, which is so-so. I think I'll continue to use the urlLink Yahoo english/spanish dictionary b/c it meets more of my needs.

This is why libraries matter in a way that, say, a Barnes & Noble cannot..."

 Happy 4th, everyone! A nice part of celebrating this holiday here is that the emphasis on crazed patriotism is a little minimized in light of tired working people happy to have a free day on which they can drink some extra beer and laugh a little harder. Traditionally, the US government prohibited large social gatherings on reservations unless it was a US national holiday, so US holidays like Thanksgiving and July 4 have become appropriated among Native Amerians as huge gatherings and holidays. Accordingly, today Nambe Pueblo and Taos Pueblo are both holding Pow Wows. We’d planned to attend the Pow Wow at Nambe all week, but this morning we awoke to a hazy sky that would have been quite normal in Houston, but here was an unusual opportunity for extra hiking in otherwise inpenetrable sunshine and heat. We loaded the kids and the small pack and headed for Two Rivers, a recreational area outside of Questa where the Rio Grande and the Red River converge deep in the giant Rio Grande Gorge. The area offers all levels of trails down the cliffs, varrying from .3 miles to 2.2 miles each way and from 300 feet elevation change to 1000 feet. Just before the Questa turn-off, however, both children unexpectedly fell asleep in their carseats. John and I agreed that we could force sleepy kids down the canyon, thereby butting our heads against the proverbial parenting wall for a few hours, or we could just ride the wave. We drove right on by the turn-off and continued to drive through Red River (just missing the huge Texan-attended parade by minutes) and Angel Fire, to Mora via the back road and back to Taos on the old Toas high road from Penasco. By then, both kids were awake and we stopped for a huge lunch at Orlandos. After Orlando’s we again headed toward Questa and would you believe both children again fell asleep? They did. This time we sat at the viewing point at the edge of the gorge and took turns walking over to the scenic overlooks. Before long the kids awoke and we hit the trail. We picked one marked moderate on the continuum from easy to difficult. It was the Big Arsenic Spring trail, .8 miles each way with about 600 feet elevation drop down. Returning upward wasn’t too difficult, Aidan was again the hiking champ of all toddler and boyhoods. I expect to be more sore from the decent than the assent tomorrow.

 Yesterday was an amazing adventure! We took Aidan on his longest hike to date, as we all hiked up to Williams Lake, a trail en route to Wheeler Peak, the highest peak in New Mexico. Our round trip was about 5.4 miles and it was over a considerable elevation gain. The trailhead is at the back bowl of the Taos Valley Ski Area, and right there is also a huge Bavarian lodge. Upon our completion of the trail we treated ourselves to giant German beers and big plates of schnitzel and brats. Have you ever noticed how food tastes better after a huge athletic exertion? The food there tasted amazing, like the best ever eaten and the 18 oz. beers sailed down our throats. Unfortunately, the kids both fell asleep en route back to the tent and as a result, both had very short naps. After the big hike and after their virtually absent naps, we were a very grumpy family as we moved into the Suncatcher Earthship yesterday afternoon. I hated how short tempered I felt, and how annoyingly the children seemed to seek out trouble. We were at the whims of our emotions. After a good night’s sleep for all and a great breakfast this morning (John’s juevos rancheros), we were back to our happy Earthship selves. We drank tea and stared at the mountains, John and I took turns reading to each other as the children played in the rocks at our feet. And now it’s nap time again, a nice quiet time to listen to the wind blow through the trees and grass, catch up on some reading and writing.

 The differences between life and vacation: when I barely get in a shower every few days here, it’s not because everyone needs so much of me that I can’t budget the time for a simple shower, but because we’re too busy rushing off most mornings to get hikes in before the hot sun gets too high in the sky or because I lingered too long watching the sun set on the beautiful mountains, and have to rush in to get babies to bed and dishes washed. When the dishes pile up high on the counter tops, it’s not because we barely had enough energy to throw ourselves in bed after making dinner the night before, but rather because we were lucky enough to entertain someone with our inspired cooking dishes and we all lingered and laughed around the table until our guest could barely drive home awake and we could barely stumble off to bed ourselves. When I’m bone tired at the day’s end, it’s not because I’ve spent my biological resources in the three people of wife, mother, and professional, but rather because I’ve spent myself on a fulfilling hike and filled my belly afterward with satisfying, replenishing food. When I drink deep of a glass of wine or a bottle of beer, it’s not because I’m self-medicating with the best depressant I can get without a perscription, but rather to quench the thirst from the hot sun, or to compliment a perfect meal or moment.

 Mountain rain moves in fast! Into the tent the Mac, the second cup of tea, and I have absconded. Quietly, kids still sleeping. In the time it took to set up in here, the rain’s moved on. I’m too used to the Houston rain that drones on for hours. The birds are celebrating the much-needed precipitation with their melodies. The lingering clouds let out an occasional bout of thunder, the crashing sounds like rumbling rocks as it ricochets through the canyons. And always the rushing water provides the background to all our sounds and songs.

 The ninos are asleep in the tent, nap time is lasting luxuriously long today. I’ve already enjoyed an hour’s nap myself and now John is making us cups of tea with the remainder of our quiet time. He’ll take any excuse to play with our new campstove! This is flexible expectations in action. Our two backpacks are still packed with all our gear for our planned three day, two night backpack, only we access what we need from them by opening the car trunk! Since John and I got so sick this past weekend, we were forced to adjust our plans to car camping. That’s what you call camping when you pull up to your tent site in the car. We found a cute spot against the Rio Hondo in the Hondo Valley near Taos Ski Valley. From here, we can drive to a number of fun trails or even into town as we did this morning for breakfast at Michael’s Kitchen. I’m very sad that our giant introduction into backpacking with children will be delayed until our next trip, maybe late July?, but I’m pleased we’ve recovered this much considering how very sick we were. I wish the whole world could see what my eyes see. The mountain light dances on the tree leaves in the softest way, like light only looks in the fall most places, as if photosynthesis works best when it’s pretty. The moonstone-blue sky is so intense that even the afternoon mountain showers can’t really conceal it. Life abounds everywhere, and each flora and fauna exhibit a rhythm in their existence. All the rhythms dance together symbiotically, and our little family tries to gently insert ourselves into this existence, hopefully not impacting it at all but instead appreciating great impacts on ourselves.

 Even when I was urlLink overflowing , I knew the empty days would come, and they did. I'm back on the upswing now, but for a few days there, I was low. For a few days I couldn't bring myself to write anything except wry emails poking fun at women who have lows to women who I know had lows. But here I am, writing in the blog. See, it didn't last long. I hate low! I always suffer from that mom syndrome, the 4-6 p.m. madness, the witching hour, so to speak. But this one started one afternoon about 4 p.m. and just didn't quit. I do see the usefulness of it all. Without the lows, there would be no highs. I can use these times to calibrate my joy. I think they're useful for calibrating other things, as well. Like friendship, as one friend stayed up late talking on the phone to me for two hours, one emailed her therapist's name and number, and another piled on judgment and negativity. I've learned to protect myself from all that is bad and sad in such times. Like politics, global news, and house guests. I'm even learning to protect myself from a strange breed of person that smells the lows on you and goes for the throat. Instead, I wrap myself up in all that is lovely. I buy fresh flowers, cook (or eat, as John usually cooks) fresh picked vegetables, I laugh too loud and too long at silly shows on TV. I burn essential oils, dried sage, and incense through the house. I play music that takes me back to happier times. Together, these experiences protect me like a shield from the cold, bitter world. Isn't that funny? Even in August, the world seems cold and bitter. The heat index is supposed to be 110 degrees today, and I'm still using a blanket analogy. Maybe I'm missing the onset of fall, absent here in the southern backwaters. My little Freudian slip might just be revealing a seasonal affective disorder! Ha! Well, regardless of the seasons, I also helped myself back on the road to recovery a bit by eating a huge buffalo burger. I think our virtually-vegetarian lifestyles leave me a little anemic and when I underwent this kind of low last year it was just after going off iron, which itself was irritating my colon and preventing uptake of other essential nutrients. I've always had crazy iron issues. Whether through time or diet or a good friend, I'm happy to say I'm feeling better. All I need now is a good sunburn and I'll be cured. I'd better get it before hurricane Bonnie and her friend Charlie come to shore!

 urlLink The Morality of Intervention (News) Ian Williams : "A civil war between government troops and ethnic minority rebels rages in Darfur, Sudan, that has claimed 50,000 lives already and put millions of others at risk as they get caught in the cross-fire. But much-needed military and humanitarian intervention is unlikely to come anytime soon from the United States. Thanks to the debacle of Iraq, the distrust of the United States that the invasion has created, and the American people's increasing frustration and alienation from Bush's wartime policies, any action taken to prevent genocide would be a political foible of the worst kind. It seems the well of US compassion, if one could ever have called a mixture of paranoia, cowboy machismo, and tepid concern just that, has run dry. And with it any potential for intervention in the Sudanese crisis. How can two very different crises come to look the same? Iraq was a moral crusade pitched in a combined rhetoric of humanitarian intervention and self defense. The line between the two became blurred, became headed under the broad category of 'Do the right thing.' But now, what was never a simplistic question of 'doing the right thing' to begin with, shows itself in all its complexity and the Bush White House cannot afford to take anymore leaps in the name of ethics. And the world is not prepared to take leaps for Bush. Deteriorating relations between the United States and many countries complicates the question of intervention and 'just war.' While Britain and Australia have both expressed readiness to commit troops to Sudan, it is almost impossible for Muslim nations in the Security Council such as Algeria and Pakistan to agree to U.S.-led action against an Arab League member like Sudan. The Arab world's tolerance for the atrocities committed by their rulers is indeed a cause for despair. But the occupation of Iraq, including the treatment of prisoners in Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo, the U.S.'s total support for Ariel Sharon, and the xenophobic anti-Muslim and anti-Arab outbursts in the United States, make that stone harder to cast. And even if they were to accept the need for intervention of some kind in Sudan, why would they entrust George Bush with such a task?"

The hunt has become so intense that rival regions sometimes compete for clouds sailing across the sky.

But there are no returns too small among the swing states in this tight election.

 urlLink Flicker: The Hollywood Production Code : "I am fascinated with Pre-Code Hollywood films. The term “pre-code” generally designates films made between the advent of talk pictures—circa 1929-1930—and the strict enforcement of the censorious Hollywood Production Code in 1934. I am planning a series of entries discussing pre-code films, but for now I want to take a look at the actual “code”. The film industry has long been under scrutiny of cultural conservatives, fearful that movie content may lead the public’s morals astray. In the 1920s, the most popular stories of the day depicted Jazz Age excess—wild youth, adulterous spouses, sophisticated seducers, and such. To fend off increasingly combative civic and religious groups and possible government regulation, the studios hired Will Hays—a former postmaster general under President Warren G. Harding—to clean up the industry. In 1930, under Hays’ direction, Father Daniel Lord (a Jesuit priest) and Martin Quigley (a prominent Roman Catholic layman) wrote the Hollywood Production Code. The overriding theme of the document is stated as such: “No picture should lower the moral standards of those who see it.” The multi-page code and its addenda spell out everything, from a film’s “moral obligation” to how to depict certain plots such as crime and love, to certain strictures on costumes and dancing and definitions of what is obscene and vulgar. I have tried to find the entire Hollywood Production Code text on the internet to no avail, but a tiny sampling of some of its content is as follows: Not plot theme should definitely side with evil against good. The courts of the land should not be presented as unjust. “Pure Love”—the love of a man for a woman permitted by the law of God and man—is a rightful subject for plots. Miscegenation (sex relationship between white and black races) is forbidden. Ministers of religion…should not be used in comedy, as villains, or as unpleasant persons. Bedrooms: in themselves are perfectly innocent…However, under certain conditions they are bad dramatic locations [when they suggest sex laxity and obscenity]. "

 urlLink Apple - Pro/Words - Daniel J. Hale & Matthew LaBrot : "What young person doesn’t love a mystery story? Especially when the heroes are smart kids who manage to solve crimes before any of the adults around them have even a fraction of a clue. One such sleuth is Zeke Armstrong, the cowlicked and sports-loving protagonist of Daniel J. Hale and Matthew LaBrot’s “Zeke Armstrong Mystery Series.” In May, 2003, the first Zeke Armstrong book, “Red Card,” won a prestigious Agatha Award for Best Children’s/Young Adult Mystery, an honor named for famed mystery writer Agatha Christie. LaBrot, who was 15 at the time, is the youngest writer ever to win the award. This month, “Green Streak,” the pair’s second book, will hit bookstores. And a third, “White Out,” is in the works — with many more to come. Hale, 44, and LaBrot, 16, are an uncle-and-nephew writing team who live about 100 miles from each other in the Dallas area. The two decided to write a book after playfully exchanging emails on a day LaBrot was feeling particularly dejected. “I was playing soccer in Dallas, and was kind of having a tough season,” says LaBrot. “One day, my uncle was trying to make me feel not so down, so he started joking around, typing things on the computer, joking about some of the people on the team, and stuff.” Hale and LaBrot then took turns, writing down a sentence at a time — and laughing a lot. “I told him to delete it, but he said ‘No, this could be good.’ The next day, we decided to start writing a book.”"

 urlLink Apple - Pro/Video - Jonathan Meyer Robinson : "“The cruelest prison of all,” says barrio poet Piri Thomas, “is the prison of the mind.” He knows first-hand what it’s like being locked up behind real bars, as well as the jails of poverty, violence and addiction. “God, I wanna get out of this hole,” Thomas writes. “I promise if You help me climb out, I ain’t gonna push the cover back on that cesspool…I’ll push my arm back down there and help the others climb out.” Now 76, the Afro-Cuban-Puerto Rican writer, educator and activist has spent 45 years doing just that. Thomas’ struggle spoke to filmmaker Jonathan Meyer Robinson when he first read the poet’s influential 1967 autobiography, “Down These Mean Streets.” Eventually, the book and its author inspired Robinson to embark on what would become a 10-year journey to bring his documentary, “Every Child Is Born a Poet: The Life and Work of Piri Thomas,” to the screen."

 Perhaps the real benefit of the Howard Dean campaign was the general realization among the American public that small donations can affect real change. Howard Dean asked his political supporters to contribute their widow's mite. Any size donation, be it $10 or $1000 was equally valued. In fact, regular contributions of $10 or $25 together broke the record for most and earliest Democratic contributions ever. The collective urlLink widows' mites together made a mountain. Howard Dean has come and gone, but the power of the small contribution can be the legacy that lives on. Our world today is experiencing a urlLink ethnocide in Sudan with potential to rate on the humanitarian scale of Rwanda and the Holocaust. Over two million people have already been killed. Today, as I watched the horrors unfold on the href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/extra/teachers/lessonplans/world/sudan_genocide.html">Jim Lehrer News Hour , I saw tents in the background stamped with either urlLink OxFam or urlLink UNHCR . That tells me at least these two organizations are on the scene, treating the walking wounded while the various nation states that comprise the United Nations argue about appropriate political responses. Children and their parents, mostly mothers since fathers are the first targets of genocide, anyone strong enough to survive the ravages of warfare and exodus, now gather in refugee camps quickly put together by a handful of aid organizations. They need food and medicine. They need your widow's mite. No matter what hardships you think you have in life, if you're reading this blog right now, you have more than these souls. Our Judeo/Christian culture holds to the commandment: From those to whom much is given, much is expected. Give now. Give anything. I know at least two organizations are onsite, urlLink OxFam and urlLink UNHCR , and I'm guessing urlLink Doctors Without Borders is there too. urlLink Give $10, or even $25 . I bet you can give $50 if you scrape your budget. I promise, your donation will matter.

 the implications could include abolishment of the death penalty and national support of mental illness, _if_ it's possible for the US to believe rather than judge urlLink Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General - Chapter 2 : "Recovery is variously called a process, an outlook, a vision, a guiding principle. There is neither a single agreed-upon definition of recovery nor a single way to measure it. But the overarching message is that hope and restoration of a meaningful life are possible, despite serious mental illness (Deegan, 1988; Anthony, 1993; Stocks, 1995; Spaniol et al., 1997). Instead of focusing primarily on symptom relief, as the medical model dictates, recovery casts a much wider spotlight on restoration of self-esteem and identity and on attaining meaningful roles in society."

 Just heard Blind Melon's Glitch on urlLink Radio Paradise . I haven't paid them much attention since college, but this is great. http://www.blogger.com/img/gl.link.gif

 Today is a big holiday for our neighborhood. Everyone gets together in the park with covered dishes and grills. The idea is you get to know who your neighbors are so you know who doesn't belong in the neighborhood when you see them. In reality, this idea lands strikingly close to getting together with the pretty neighbors and giving the bad ones who are watching you from their homes the evil eye. Several years ago when the neighborhood organization I worked for tried to use the event as an opportunity to drum up support for the building campaign by circling a petition, the neighborhood folks got real angry and said we were usurping their time with the police chief. Our neighborhood could be the posterchild for gentrification. It was once a groovy ethnically diverse, slightly run down neighborhood. Then for a while it was a groovy ethnically and sexually diverse up-and-coming nitche in the city. And now Dubya stickers are beginning to outnumber the peace signs. Who really loses out there? The ethnically diverse. And it's these individuals who won't be encouraged to attend this "public" picnic. Needless to say, I'm not going. Even though I can see people setting up tables from this window in front of me as I type. I hope they see me in here and wonder why I'm not coming over. I really hope they see the pile of dead tree in front of my sideyard and wonder why in the world urlLink someone cut down a healthy, beautifully aged tree .

 urlLink BarlowFriendz: Postponing Democracy : "I heard over the radio that, according to Newsweek magazine, the Department of Homeland Security asked the Justice Department last week to review what legal steps would be needed to delay the vote if an attack occurred on the day before or on election day. Come again? Even during the Civil War and both World Wars, presidential elections were held on schedule. I can imagine no terrorist attack that would justify postponing them now, unless, of course, the administration were seeking a reason to do it anyway. Even if Al-Qaeda were to pop off a tactical nuke on Wall Street November 1, reducing me and lower Manhattan to our elemental constituents, I would want the election to proceed on schedule. I vote absentee anyway."

 Although bloggerottesse Rebecca Blood was not among urlLink the few bloggers given press credentials for the DNC, urlLink she attended as a civilian and ended up serving as an anthropologist. What results is an uber-blogging, an observation from the corner of the room of those sent to observe from the corner of the room. Her views of the convention are great, but her views of the bloggers at the convention are stellar. She's begun posting her afterthoughts of the convention and the bloggers here: urlLink remembering rebecca :: notes on the 2004 democratic national convention : "Bill Clinton of course, simply basked in the crowd's applause when he walked on stage. It's not just that he could read a phone book and make it inspirational--he could--but I had a strong sense that the people in the room were remembering the best times they had ever had, remembering the 90's when their man was popular and in office, and the country was prosperous and at peace. I imagine it's much the same response Ronald Reagan would have received in 2000 from a sports arena full of Republicans, had he been able to speak to them..." "I must admit, I was shocked by the blogger accommodations. For some reason, I thought they would be placed with the press, but instead they were given two rows of tables and a row of chairs, which, because they were centrally located, they had to fight the public for. Next door, the platforms on which various television cameras were placed were designated off-limits by the very low-tech method of stringing yellow police tape to block entry. The bloggers didn't even get that. Perhaps there were enough chairs (had they been available) for 35 bloggers, but there certainly wasn't enough table space."

 urlLink Guardian Unlimited | Arts news | Artists' squat to become cultural venue : "For first time in its five-year history, the purple, pink and orange doorway to the squat in a former office block at the heart of the French capital's expensive 1st arrondissement, was locked yesterday, after city authorities ruled that the building was no longer safe to receive the thousands of people who visit annually. The 30 artists who work at 59 rue de Rivoli have been given rent-free studios and living space elsewhere, while the Paris authorities begin an emergency renovation programme on the premises. If the works go smoothly, the squat will reopen, newly legalised, in early 2007."

 Because he knew we'd all google it anyway after hearing the news, because I'm so very grateful for Apple computers, and because cancer sucks, this blogger's heart is with you, Steve-o. urlLink Guardian Unlimited | Online | Steve Jobs optimistic after cancer operation : "Steve Jobs, chief executive of Apple Computer, was yesterday recovering from weekend surgery to remove a cancerous tumour from his pancreas. Mr Jobs, 49, broke the news of his surgery in an email to staff late on Sunday. He said he would take August off to recuperate but expects to make a full recovery. He hopes to be back at his desk in September. He identified the cancer as an islet cell neuroendocrine tumour, a rare form that can be cured by surgical removal if caught early, as Mr Jobs said his had been. He said he would not undergo chemotherapy or radiation treatment. He added that the far more deadly and common form of pancreatic cancer was adenocarcinoma. 'I mention this because when one hears pancreatic cancer (or Googles it) one immediately encounters this far more common and deadly form, which, thank God, is not what I had.'"

 urlLink MediaGuardian.co.uk | Media | Who needs enemas? : "But puns are so last century. In the age of darker than dark, bitter without the sweet comedy, the sort of comedy in which I so often work, puns are simply not done. They're considered cheap, cheesy and a bit juvenile.

But trust me, I write from experience."

 I hate feeling angry, it takes me over and burns my insides with rage. I don't think anger achieves any purpose, and I know the universe doesn't need me to add bad energy. I always hear Christians say even Jesus got angry, they point to the story of Jesus on the steps of the temple when he turned the money changers' tables over. I answer, even Jesus was human, and thus made mistakes, experienced failure. I bet, sitting in Heaven, he still cringes when he remembers that day, because everyone uses it as their excuse to go off in righteous anger. In my years so far on this planet, I've at least learned that I'm typically never so wrong as when I claim my rectitude in righteous anger. I respect people that can see horror and wrongs against humanity and respond in wisdom and hurt rather than anger. I am jealous of people that can bare witness to gross abuses of strongly held ideals, and respond in calm, cool proaction. And so I respect John for responding to Stupid Fucking Bastard Who Kills Trees (I'm working on it, ok?) by saying to me as I tried to will him home over the cellphone so he could stand up to SFBWKT for me, "honey we'll have a funeral tonight for the tree, we'll honor its life. That's the best we can do." And I really respect John for negotiating a compromise with SFBWKT. Upon John's arrival at home, the tree was already seriously wounded. SFBWKT was pulling with all of his 180 pounds on a rope tied to the upper tree, and the two certainly knowledgeable homeless people he had hired by the hour to help him sawed at lower tree parts. As if 180 pounds pulling away from my house could at all affect the 400 pound tree parts from swinging into the roof! SFBWKT clearly never took physics. Neither did I, but I get this. John negotiated a solution whereby the trunk itself and the one branch that points directly up would be saved, because clearly without the *dangerous* limbs, this trunk is going nowhere. SFBWKT somehow agreed. So we've saved the tree's life. For now. But our lovely sideyard is a wreck. It looks ugly and bare devoid of the organic green canopy it had up until a few hours ago. I hate it. In an effort to cleanse us all of the hating anger, John and I agreed the family should take a long walk. We aimed toward the city, brushed the edge of the skyscrapers' territory, and headed south. We walked by the Fonde Rec Center, which was packed with cars, at least a few of which were Marcedes and Hummers. Every now and then, NBA stars come back to this homecourt of sorts, just for scrimmages or practice and the local African American community hails their homecoming with huge attendance. I'm happy to see the color barrier among the fans faltering, as the other night some *gasp* Republican neighbors invited me to walk over to a game with them. We didn't stop to watch a game tonight, instead we pressed on toward the big park by the Bayou. In the sky, a fascinating span of moonstone blue and bright pink clouds overlapped each other as if only some clouds got the memo that the sunset had arrived. In reality, some clouds were thousands of feet above the others, but it looked like they were all together, just differently splashed with colored light. In the park, I think it's called the Eleanor Tinsley Park, we pushed the kids on swings, I swang myself with abandon, appreciating all the trees that have somehow survived the axes and saws of humans. Aidan began to chatter away to a kid who came to swing next to us. Three-year-olds can really take off at the mouth. "Hi, my name's Aidan, and I'm three years old because I'm three and a half. No I'm four because I can ride a bike by myself and tomorrow we're going to the far away park and I'm going bike riding with Austin and his mom and I can ride all by myself because I'm three and a half. What's your name?" The kid said he was Louis and it quickly came out that Louis and his family were visiting Houston on vacation from Mexico. We found out they live very near a town we're going to visit next year. Louis and his sisters were great, and soon we met his dad, too, who arrived on a mountain bike, drinking deep from his CamelBac. Everyone had a love of soccer in common and we mentioned that we like to play at Herman Park when the kids tire of the opera, ballet, or Shakespeare, and we all made plans to see each other soon at Herman Park. We're bringing the soccer ball. We headed back toward home, passing an amazing number of walkers, joggers, and bicycles. Everyone wanted out today. We barely beat the rain. The evil scar of the tortured tree remains, but the Earth is soothing its wounds with sweet raindrops. In years, long after we've left here, assuming some developer doesn't finish SFBWKT's job, the tree might even be stronger for its experience.

 My neighbor, the man from whom we bought our house, has been complaining about a certain tree for some time. It's a gorgeous tree, it shades our sideyard perfectly, even though it's actually rooted on the neighbor's land. We only have a sideyard, so we use it like a backyard. I just bought pretty twinkly lights to hang from said tree so we could entertain guests at our newly acquired picnic table in the sideyard. In Houston, vines like to live on trees and this tree was no exception. I like the vines hanging down from it, and climbing its trunk. They add to the wooded feeling of the corner of our property. But neighborboy killed them. He said they made the tree dangerously weighted toward our house. In a way, I was relieved he killed the vines because I mistakenly thought it would make him stop eyeing the tree with his saw-happy eyes. A little background: our home is on a corner, and he owns both empty lots that surround our property. He's no normal neighbor, he doesn't work 9-5, then come home and occasionally mow the lawn. He bought up all sorts of property in this neighborhood during the 80s bust and now he just makes his living selling a piece off now and then. Which leaves him with idle time on his hands during the days, time he fills micromanaging empty pieces of land. Neighborboy says he can tell the tree is dangerous because he banged on it and it sounded hollow. Bullshit. Let's get Dr. Randall of Urban Harvest over here to look at it. This tree is healthy, it has beautiful green leaves. Neighborboy says its a wonder it hasn't fallen already and if we get a good storm, it'll fall on our home. Bullshit. John says neighborboy is afraid we'll sue him if it ever falls. And that's a likely explanation since we all see ourselves in the world and neighborboy likes any excuse to bring legal action upon someone. I know my views about trees are a little unusual here. I'm from Santa Fe, where you need a permit from the city and the county to cut down _any_ tree, of _any_ size and condition. People have been fined and sued for cutting trees there. Santa Fe is a place where people value a tree for its life, and for its life-giving contribution to the Earth. A tree is not something a mere human, who came around long after the tree grew there, and will be gone long before the tree dies, can kill. But neighborboy is killing the trees on his lot, just cutting them down because they bother his view or he's afraid they'll be more expensive to remove after they fall. Oh, the humanity.

 A friend sent me this essay, and it is eloquent, if a little technophobe. I don't like the imagery of books pitted against technology. Rather than the death nell of all that is good and pure, technology--like books--presents more choices for people, more depth in humanity's range from bad and empty to good and pure. Time was, the novel would be the end of books. But time changed, and so should we. Likewise, books are the only refuge from real time only for people who live unaware of the bounty around us. A child's smile, a touching sunset, a man's last breath are all beyond real time. I like to remember that part of the most recent Star Trek movie (Yvonne, which one is it?), where Jean Luke stopped time out of his love for a woman. The moment I exchanged my wedding vows with John felt like that. As did the first weeks I held each of my children. As did the days surrounding the death of our unborn daughter, Grace. Like even the sand in the hourglass had stopped falling. Moments like these become selective if we stop seeking them out. I hope I never do, but it does get hard to remember. I should make a pop-up reminder in my calendar to keep thinking of them. That would be the perfect marriage of real time and selective time! urlLink Planes, Trains, Elevators, and Waiting Rooms : "Reading may be the last secretive behavior that is neither pathological nor prosecutable. It is certainly the last refuge from the real-time epidemic. For the stream of a narrative overflows the banks of the real. Story strips its reader, holding her in a place time can%92t reach. A book%92s power lies in its ability to erase us, to expand or contract without limit, to circle inside itself without beginning or end, to defy our imaginary timetables and lay us bare to a more basic ticking."

 Since urlLink switching over to Macs months ago, I've loved all things Mac. Almost. I love the rarer-than-a-blue-moon crashes, the creative interfaces, the over-engineering, especially love the way iTunes' visualizations put Ellie to sleep. But I've never warmed to AppleWorks. It's so illegible, even in the same fonts compared to word. Its spellcheck is thorough, but clumsy. Worst of all, when text is copied and pasted into an HTML doc like blogger or even HTML Master formatting, apostrophes come out as crazy weird symbols. This week we're working very hard to get at least a beta version of my e-book website up, so we hit the wall, broke down, and bought Office for Macs. Oh mana from heaven, I've missed it.

 urlLink News : "A small cruise ship catering to eco-tourists was seriously damaged after running aground in the Aleutian Islands.

Coast Guard Chief Warrant Officer Roddy Corr said about 5,000 gallons of diesel fuel spilled from the ruptured tank, as was some waste water. He said swift currents dispersed the spilled fluid before it could be cleaned up."

The intriguing glimpse of the former dictator's daily routine as he awaits trial on charges of war crimes and genocide was given to the Guardian yesterday by Iraq's human rights minister, Bakhtiar Amin, who visited Saddam in detention on Saturday. Mr Amin, a longtime Iraqi human rights campaigner who had family members killed by the former regime, said he could not bring himself to speak to Saddam but observed that he was 'in good health and being kept in good conditions'.

 urlLink The Skinny on Nudism in the U.S. : "'Nudity is a taboo in America because we primarily equate nudity or nakedness with sexuality and we have taboos about sexuality,' said Matthew Westra, a psychology professor at Longview Community College in Missouri, in the National Geographic Channel documentary Taboo: Extreme Living. 'A lot of it has to do, I think, with the Puritan and Victorian heritage that we have, which says that any kind of temptation will lead you into hell.' Modern strip clubs and pornography also strengthen the association between nudity and sex, a link that naturism activists are constantly trying to break. 'At nude beaches, we swim, we play volleyball, we lay in the sun. We do the same things everyone else does at the beach—we just prefer to do it without clothing,' Hoffman said. The rules: no touching, no gawking, no inappropriate behavior. 'It's a very family-friendly environment.'"

 At the time I was just jealous because we could only urlLink afford to send John to the urlLink Columbia meetings and not both of us. In retrospect, he was the right one to send. I just now found this great article on his presentation. I'm so proud! urlLink The Earth Institute at Columbia University : "While a dramatic night view of Earth flickered on the wall, NASA engineer John Feighery told a group of sustainable development experts from the Earth Institute, Columbia University, and the United Nations Development Programme that astronaunts are privy to a unique view of the disparities between the rich and poor. From space, the prosperous areas of the world glow at night with electric lights, while the poorest areas — most notably the countries of Africa — remain in darknesss. So began Feighery's presentation on sustaining human life in space, part of a one-day workshop exploring the common research areas both NASA and Earth Institute scientists share, especially in areas of water and sanitation. As presented at the workshop, NASA's technologies, such as strict systems of water purification, system testing, and waste disposal used to sustain human life during long space missions, could prove life-saving to populations living in areas with no access to potable water, proper drainage or sewage systems..."

 I hope this means the separation thing was a temporary blip. I've always counted myself very lucky to have skipped a separation anxiety phase with Aidan, I want to keep it that way. I honestly think he thought getting wimpery might make me stay at school with him. Yesterday when I picked him up I sat down next to him and talked about how I wanted him to be happy at school, we role played a little for what the routine would be, how he should run in and hug his teacher and put his lunch box in the cubby and play with the kids. His teacher got on board and said how sad she gets when Aidan is sad. He went along with it all, even sounded pretty excited to come back. Then, this morning, he didn't want to get dressed and didn't want to go to school. I put him in his bed and said if he didn't go to school then he needed to stay in bed. I went on with getting Ella changed and dressed and ignored him. A few minutes later he said he was ready to go to school. He remained happy about it all until it was time to get out of the car, and he buried his face again. I told him he didn't want to stay in bed, it's much more fun to play with kids and he got out of the car willingly. One more balk at the door to the classroom, though. This is where, for the past two mornings, things really deteriorated. Today I tried to assure him that I would come back to get him after he ate and napped. He looked up at me with his big brown eyes and said, mommy, will you come with me? and he held his hand out to me. I said for one minute and took his hand, at which point he rushed into his room and put his lunch box up and ran to his teacher. He was already interested in what the other kids were doing. I interrupted a little--you're never supposed to sneak out--and said, ok Aidan, I'm leaving now. Bye Bye! Aidan asked again if I would stay and I answered no, but I'll be back to pick you up in a little bit. He was a little eased and this was a huge improvement over the clingy cry that he had yesterday so I turned and walked out. No crying haunted me as I walked down the hallway, I didn't have to hide in the foyer and send in someone to see if he's ok now. It felt great! If only Ellie felt great, too. She seems to be under the weather, is pretty unhappy, spits up big amounts of her food at once right after eating. She hasn't gotten rid of her runny nose from last week yet either. I need to eat some good garlic and green chile to up her immune system. It tears me up when she's sick, that sad little sneeze and runny face!

 If you've seen the news at all today, I'm sure you heard about this breastmilk study. A hazardous anti-flammable chemical was found in the breastmilk of many Texas women. Newscasts on every channel are advertising for their upcoming news hour in the middle of shows with lines like, Breastmilk might not be the safest thing for your baby! and Thought breast was best? Maybe not for some Texas women... I pulled the story off the AP to see just what they were talking about. Indoor air exposure to this chemical can come from anything from your TV to furniture to copy machines. Only Maine and California have taken steps to address its use (big shock that Texas, the pollutant-friendly state, has not joined that battle) Buried in the bottom of it is the information from the study's press release that I'm sure no one caught. It says the chemical has not been linked to any developmental problems and whatever health effects it may cause probably already take effect in the womb. It goes on to say women should not stop breastfeeding. Every TV station here in Houston and the Chronicle carried this. What a sad, horrible thing they've done by contributing to the bad reputation breastfeeding carries for so many in this country. Dr. Sears addresses the issue of pollutants in breastmilk in many of his books over and over. He says with very few exceptions (like Three Mile Island) the developmental benefit of breastmilk is still greater than whatever exposure risk it may also contain. John made the good point that this contaminant or worse contaminants are almost assuredly present in the water one would use to mix formula here in Texas or the un-organic babyfood most people use.

 Today when I dropped Aidan off he cried again. Again I was matter of fact, kissed him goodbye and told him to kiss his sister. He did, and I left. Again, I hid around the corner while he cried in his teacher's arms. Again after less than a minute he was fine and eating his snack. I don't want this to become chronic, and I need to find out fast if there is a deeper reason for it other than the huge amount of attention it got him last Friday. I entered separation anxiety easing toddler into the google search string and came up quickly with a urlLink mom to mom sharing site that had some pretty good advice. I think I'll try putting a picture of Aidan and me together on his sippy, and I'll start talking to him a lot more about the routine. Maybe I'll pop in early a few days this week, too. I hate this, it's just so un-Aidan!

 This past week, Ella perfected her ability to clap and today she began to sing! Well, it's more like her usual stream of babbles became melodic instead of their previous monotone. We're very proud. If she follows in the developmental footsteps of her brother Aidan and cousin Sean, banging her head against walls is next! Don't worry, it's a normal response to suddenly realizing one has rhythm. It tells of our family's long musical tradition.

 Friday I woke up to find John not at all getting ready for work, but rather still in his boxers getting Aidan breakfast. I was thrilled, until I realized that he was having to take a sick day because his flu was overtaking him. Aidan was coughing a little himself but (I know, I'm a bad person) I was still going to send him to school because 1) whatever he has probably originated at school so it's not a huge exposure risk, and 2) I was looking forward to a little extra time with my, albeit sick, husband. Looking back, I think the whole thing started when I was putting Aidan's shoes on--the last step before walking out the door. He noticed his dad feeding Ella, a pretty fun and funny ordeal since the girl has to be absolutely coaxed into eating anything other than nunies or bagels, dad was still in boxers, socks, and yesterday's t-shirt, clearly not going anywhere. And to Aidan's credit, it was a cozy scene I wouldn't want to leave either. Anyway, Aidan got to the door and declared he didn't want to go to school. Lunch is probably the thing he seems most excited about at school so far. He carries his lunch box like such a big boy and with so much responsibility! So I tried to use lunch with the whole go get your lunch box so we can go to school, Aidan! Then, when that failed, don't you want snacks at school? And burritos, you have burritos in your lunch box for school! This was a lucky coincidence because usually he has a pb&j in there, which is all fine, but burritos are his favorite food. When this didn't work I picked him up and carried him to the car against his wishes, with the idea that seeing his school from the car window would light him up like it did any normal day. Only it didn't. Still trying to salvage the day with my husband and without a toddler, I told him I would go to school with him for a while. His teacher was pretty understanding of the whole thing and tried her best to bribe him away from my lap with his snack and toys. At one point she urged me to just leave so I kissed him and left, but only to hide in the hallway. He was frantic with panic. The teachers were amazed because usually Aidan is the social butterfly. This fact began hitting me pretty hard. Ella might panic at my absence, but never Aidan. I waited 10 minutes, then I came back in and hugged him and told him I'd go out to the playground with him, since playing outside would surely coax him out of his shell. When this too failed, I told his teacher I was just going to take him home. They were pretty shocked and warned me that he might start doing this all the time if he sees it works now. I explained that if he does start doing it all the time, we'll try a different approach but for now he must not feel well to be acting like this and I don't want to force a situation in which he does cry at the thought of school every day because he has such a traumatic experience today. In my head was thinking back on values, we don't cry our kids to sleep, so we shouldn't cry him to school either. Back at home Aidan must have really been sick because I told him since he didn't feel well enough for school, he'd have to stay in bed for the morning and he actually did. I brought him books and after that a few games, but for the most part he was very calm, very unlike Aidan. All weekend long John and I never mentioned school and then Sunday night he, on his own, said he was ready to go to school in the morning. This morning came and he eagerly got dressed and ready for school, but when we arrived he asked if I was going to stay with him. I said no. At the door to his classroom he got wimpery and clingy and I hurried him through to his cubby where his lunch goes. He really started falling apart then and his teacher looked at me to see which tactic I wanted to take. I squatted down and kissed him and said it's time for mom to go. Bye bye! And I walked out. His teacher held him and he cried and I hid in the hallway. A few minutes went by and he seemed quiet. I solicited the help of another parent walking by. She peeked in for me and said he was busy playing. It worked! I left feeling like the champion mama. I had successfully determined when my son needed me to stay and when he needed me to go. If you're asking now if my moral here is leave and the kid will eventually quiet down and enjoy himself or stay so the kid doesn't feel abandoned, you missed the point. The moral is to try to get to know your kids well enough to know what the right solution is in each situation. Turns out, urlLink the same river twice principle applies to parenting, too!

 What better for a rainy weekend and house full of sickies than videos! So I went to Blockbuster for the first time in probably over a year (because I got cable this year!). My son was pretty excited at all the choices, so I just had to pick fast and go. I picked Veggietales' Jonah and Spirited Away. So here's the reviews: I haven't bought any Veggietales since the original few two years ago because they come across as pretty misogynist. All the main characters are males and when an occasional storyline involves a female, as in Esther, the girl needs a man to come bale her out of the every little problem she has from the little life lessons to the climax of the plot. I'm not saying our beloved of all films, Shrek, is any better at this, but at least Shrek has good music and jokes entertaining for adults, too. Jonah certainly fails on both these counts. And then there's the whole religious thing. We're barely tiptoeing back into the waters of organized Christianity, still pretty wary of passing on to our children a bureaucracy-laden, self serving myth progenitor of a faith and this movie has Jonah prophesying to the Israelites in a song, "don't do drugs, stay in school" right along with actual biblical holy advice like be clean and treat others well. Here's one little gem in the whole movie, though: good or bad, and you know where I stand here, you're basically looking at the religion of George W. and the gang. Literal scriptural interpretation, Israel's God's chosen people, etc. It's good to see, in this context, God telling Jonah to give the Ninevites a second chance in spite of the way they have treated the Israelites in the past. Sounds like sound Clinton-era diplomacy to me! Now, Spirited Away was utterly unexpected and breathtaking. Remember that I don't believe in censoring my children's entertainment, and know that it was difficult for me to watch him tense up in the scary beginning. At one point I rubbed his back to divert his intense attention and reminded him it was only a movie. Similarly, when John was worrying about Aidan at a different point, he asked if Aidan would like to go sit with him on the chase. Aidan said his cute little sure! like nothing at all was up and got up. But he chose to sit in his dad's lap rather than just beside him. I don't want to ruin the plot for you, but I will tell you a little about the film's background. I rented the film knowing only that it won an Oscar last year for best foreign film. Aidan loves foreign films, animated or not, he sat through all of Amelie for example. Spirited Away is Japanese, it's animated in japanimae style. I didn't know anything about the plot and it was exciting to see it unfold without knowing anything, so I'm not going to tell you anything either! The main characters are depicted as American, which provides an interesting bit of cultural critique from a foreign eye. This too was part of the fun. The only female protagonists I've been able to find in animation have been in Japanimae. I first discovered this when complaining about the absense of girls in kids shows that don't need a boy to come save their day and my sister suggested Power Puff Girls. Shortly after that, my sister-in-law, Amanda filled my order for an Aidan gift of a Power Puff Girls video. It's a screwey plot that I still don't have nailed down, but I do appreciate the girls who save the day on their own. Shakiro, who is the protagonist in Spirted Away, does have a lot of help from the boy Hacu, but he's more of a sidekick and she saves him at least as often as he saves her. Plus, ultimately, her own actions save herself. That's a message I greatly prefer delivering to my son in his delicate formative years over the religious patriarchy of Veggietales. Aidan sat through all of Spirited Away, and only most of Jonah so I think that alone tells which movie I would go so far as to get, maybe even buy. It's intense, the plot kept us all on our seats, but that sure beats yawning your way through stupid one-dimensional kiddie humor. Let me know if you've seen these movies and what you thought!

 We tried to duck it, but in the end we couldn't possibly miss Aidan's best friend's birthday party two years in a row. Plus, he attended Avery's birthday party this summer, so missing Elizabeth's would be such a slight! And so I found myself on a rainy Saturday afternoon, walking awkwardly while pushing a stroller, holding an umbrella, and toting a toddler around the block for an event I could only hope included alcohol. If you caught urlLink Sex's season finale , you know why the parents were unwise to tell us on the invite that urlLink Rowdy the clown would be entertaining. I walked in the door, my son ran into the living room where Rowdy was working her magic, I was directed to the bowl of margarita punch, and then onto the dining room where adults were talking . I have to say, if there is such a thing as a recipe for a successful 3-year-old's birthday party, this is it. I met my new neighbors, yes it was the boycott France bumper sticker couple, but they actually removed it last week! Maybe they read my blog. I'm a little sad that I didn't have the guts to sneak in the night to put a Peace is Patriotic sticker over it, but I'm relieved they've turned away from the evil ways. Anyway, they're expecting, in fact, she's due Tuesday. You know how I love to give advice to parents to be, so imagine how happy I was when they said, after I said I bet you guys have had all the advice you can handle by now, that they don't have any friends with kids so they actually haven't gotten much advice they could use! Clowns are creepy to those of us that read or watched It, but apparently my son didn't get that memo. It helped that this clown was a skinny woman, pretty non-threatening. And she didn't give off the all too often clown feeling that this person isn't really a nice person in their normal life. She blew up balloons and painted faces, keeping a crowd of at least 10 toddlers and kids entertained while their parents knocked back the booze and enjoyed some adult interaction. I stand corrected for my stance on birthday parties.

 Leave it to urlLink the British to knight a person for researching fertility.

 My new research project is focused on the rituals surrounding food consumption. Ideally, the project will result in an extensive ethnography--dare I hope, a book?--regarding the place food maintains in lives and cultures around the world, and what Americans can learn from those instances. As part of my research, I am requesting members of various online communities, especially those with an international focus, or a cultural focus other than American, to share their stories and experiences. If you would like to contribute, you can either do so in the comment chain after this blog entry, or you can email me here. Thank you in advance for your help! So far, here's the abstract: For humans, food in not simply sustenance, but rather a sensually stimulating representation of comfort, happiness, bonding, even wellness. Foods and the ceremonies that surround the consumption of those foods delineate one cultural group from another, and stages of life within those cultural groups. In his book Eating Well for Optimum Health, Dr. Andrew Weil discussed the many parts of our lives in which food is represented. He explained that eating patterns set in one's formative years become the eating patterns one returns to later in life almost without exception. And so it is that parents in our country often overlook their role regarding their children's diets in two critical ways: 1) the cultural significance foods maintain throughout life, and 2) the dietary patterns set within those all-important first years of life. This project aims to explore the rich traditions regarding children's consumption in diverse cultural settings, as well as the ways in which applying the tenants of culinary traditions to American children could potentially improve those children's health for their entire lives.

 urlLink Midwives for Midwives gets my money this month. The program was mentioned in the September/October urlLink Mothering Magazine. The Guardian has two good parenting oracles today. The urlLink first is on a new study that correlates a diet heavy in fish with reduced teenage violence. In the article, one psychologist said, 'The take-home point is that the seeds of crime are sown early in life.' The urlLink other article is the perfect example of a woman's tale of victimizing by the medical establishment. Pregnant women have to be informed about the medical system and the differences in the many medical care options available to them just in case something terrible like this happens. Or hire a doula who can keep informed for you. Last year the NYT had an article by a woman who had a c-section very premature that affected my thought during my pregnancy with Eleanor. I looked for the article to link to for comparison, but couldn't find it. What makes this Guardian story so amazing is the fact that this woman's partner was a doctor himself.

 The NYT has a good urlLink article on today's election. You have to register, but it's free.

 Blissful, blissful Friday. Aidan was moved up a class today at school. I'm so relieved. His school squeezed us into the Sept. start date by putting him in with kids that were 18 months to 2 years. He was unbelievably older developmentally. His teacher said she' d miss having a student that could actually talk to her. I bet! He'll talk your ear off. His new class is all 2 and barely-turned 3 year olds. He was even sent home today with homework! A cute little worksheet with body parts in Spanish. They explained that the worksheets were meant to introduce in an early and no-stress way the idea of homework. If he funnels into their formal pre-school program which is really a Vanguard prep program (Vanguard is Houston's college track, pretty tricky stuff but urlLink here's an article that explains it well), this little activity will be helpful. The point of learning at this age is not curriculum, but rather teaching them to love learning.

 This is week 2 of life with Aidan in pre-school. This is not his first ever care apart from home experience. When I worked for MECA, he first had formal day care, then later I shared a nanny with a friend. Since I resigned, however, after becoming pregnant with Ellie last year, Aidan has stayed with me full time. Until last week. Cue choir of angelic singers toning *aaah*. It's been blissful, to say the least. He really needed the social interaction and extra brain stimulation and I really needed the break from the toddler. All that was foreseeable. I was unprepared, however, for Ellie's reaction. She has flourished in his absence! I think this marks the beginning of a new stage for her. Until now, she's adored Aidan so much. She emulated him nonstop. She still adores him, but she seems to be craving her own space as well. For some time, everyone who knew Aidan would be starting school soon admonished me about the morning chaos of getting out the door. I have to say Aidan is pretty good about this. We already had a pretty simple morning routine of wake up, eat, watch TV. It's not like I shower him in the mornings--or ever. just kidding, sort of--and he's a boy so his hair isn't hard. I just brush his teeth and dress him. I have to dress Ellie too because even though she's only in the school as my hip accessory as long as it takes me to walk him in and leave, I feel all sorts of pressure for her to be beautiful for that brief appearance. But still, I have my own morning horror story for parent parties now. Yesterday morning, as I prepared to get the kids out the door, I ran out to the car with the lunch bag, the nap blanket, and my cup of tea. I thought I was making things easier on myself by not having to juggle quite as much on the next trip. If I'd only known. When I got back to the door, Aidan had locked the chain lock on the inside. I tried so hard to get that little boy to unlock the door. I tried to talk him through the motions, but my instructions were lost in his little 2-year-old brain. Fortunately, I had left Ellie in her crib and the TV was on in the living room. Aidan was more interested in watching Caillou than helping and after a while that was just as well because I needed him away from the door. I used the lawn clippers to dry to wedge the lock off the wall. Then I used them to try to clip the chain. I had my cell on me, so I called John for advice. He said to just kick door where the chain was and rip it from the wall. We went over whether damaging the door was more or less expensive than the window and whether there were any other options. We came up with nothing. It turns out that those little chains on doors are pretty strong. I never knew what a good theft protection device they could be. I thought of my dad's advice he gave me in the fifth grade when I thought I might get into a fight on the playground with a bullying girl. He told me to imagine her a few feet behind where she was so that my punch would not come up short. Even then I was such an ardent pacifist that I ended up walking away from a punch in the back rather than fighting, so it was nice that dad's advice got used eventually. I kicked the door pretty hard, but the damn chain held! The door hinges, however, did not. On the first kick the bottom one gave, a few kicks later the top gave, too. All this time, Ellie played in her crib and Aidan sat watching TV. I don't know what went through their minds and when I finally got inside I was a little afraid of how I would react to Aidan so I just took him quickly to school. Right before I left the house I was pulling the door back into its frame and some neighbors walked by. They asked if I got locked out (because I'd been standing like that on the porch when they came by the first time. I said yeah and they asked if I got in yet. I pushed the door a little and it fell out of the frame, holding on only by where I had the door nob. Now you can see how the neighborhood is going downhill because the old neighbors would have found that moment hilarious. They would have returned with alcohol and tools and by the time the door was fixed up again, the event would have been transformed into legend. But those neighbors are increasingly dispersing to the outer and cheaper areas of Houston and these guys just looked a little frightened and quickened their steps as they walked on.
