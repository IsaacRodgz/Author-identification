 No not boobies - these are urlLink lollies . Which are models. It's a Japanese site so seeing what looked like a urlLink bukkake lolly wasn't too surprising.

 This animation put me in mind of urlLink Bungers' 7334 9fx 5k1||z - exactly the same style as his famed &quot;Israelis bulldozing Palestinian villages&quot; masterpiece. In fact if I was Bungers, I'd sue. Safish for work - features occasional badly drawn genitals.

 As Bungers said it's Friday so here's a urlLink mad game . This one has 4 mini games - the twist being you start playing one then you are playing two and so on until you are playing 4 games simultaneously - juggling for video gamers!

 I had 2 of urlLink these sent to me yesterday - and my antivirus didn't know what they were. So I was left with the decision - do I run the attached document.txt.scr? hahahaha! Although I don't know why I'm laughing - there are obviously millions of idiots who do open the attachments which can be seen by how rapidly these buggers spread. Anyway after my antivirus software updated this morning it identified them as mimail.s - apparently it pops up a dialog box and prompts for credit card details. Ooh had a lucky escape there - I of course would have entered my credit card details into any old random box that popped up.

 Excellent vid - urlLink someone with a webcam seems to think she is on Pop Idol. Unfortunately (for her) she is an an open plan office.

 And how could I forget! Reason to be Cheerful &trade; #3 I'm just ordering some lovely coffees from our excellent local Deli, and it reminded me of this story... Scientists are now so clever they're inserting urlLink TEA STRAINERS in people's necks to stop them from having strokes. Excuse me while I go hurl.... (via urlLink New Scientist.com )

 Or.... Reasons to be worried ...! A urlLink new hole has been discovered in IE. This time it seems the extensions of files you are downloading can be spoofed e.g. The browser tells you that you are downloading a pdf when in fact it is an exe. It seems MS are doing their best to break our interweb - urlLink you can't click on links (In fact have you seen their urlLink latest advisory on this? Type in URLs instead of clicking. WTF?) and now you can't download files. Next it'll be pictures of Anne Widdecombe returned when you look for boobies.

 Or... Reasons to be Cheerful ...! Number one : urlLink Two heads are not always better than one. Number two : At least you don't look as rough as urlLink >James Brown And it Friday for fusk's sake!! w00+!!!

 Joi Ito has posted a video of an urlLink Apache shooting up Iraqis . There's also a link to urlLink snopes which has a bit more background and links to other sites that have the clip.

 urlLink New link for the clips I urlLink linked to yesterday - grab them while you can as 1st site got a visit from the ninja lawyers.

 System Of A Down lyrics with urlLink translation .

 getHTMLForIcon("boobies"); --> Not a collection of ocular marbles (boo hiss!) but urlLink a gallery of beautiful women (and Geri Halliwell). Front page SFW (except for a single teeny thumbnail with boobies) - after that you're on your own.

 urlLink It was a typo. :) Of course if you didn't change your name every time you changed your gender I'd be able to keep up. Sorry Ms Bungers Gifton.

 If you're gonna mock me then at least refer to me with my correct secret interweb alias... it's Bung ers ... and has been for sometime!

 We should set urlLink this up for Bung then we can all laugh at his Westlife habit.

 YA another bookmarklet thing &quot; urlLink I like! &quot; is actually quite useful. You maintain a list of your favourite links (simple one click thing like posting to blogspot) but the neat thing is it will give you lists of sites that other people have recommended by examining other lists that have similar entries to yours.

 getHTMLForIcon("football"); --> Nobby is urlLink off for a pittance to Villa although the story does mention a third club involved so we may be able to screw a few more pennies for him. However much we finally get for him it won't be enough. We urlLink play Villa away on 17 th April . Fiver on Nobby for first goal? EDIT: No third club mentioned - either text of story has changed or I read it wrong :)

 Oops forgot. Over to the right is a new linkage section - lots of good linkage sites for you to plunder fresh linkage and post here :)

 That was a urlLink good list dogs but I'll stick with my original ten I think - otherwise I'll be fiddling with it for years. ooer.

 3D graphics...?? it'll never work... Dunno if you remember ACE, but like I was telling Chronic the other day I was reading a '91 issue on the Thomas H. Crapper the other day, and it had an advert for a 486DX 33Mhz PC for £3500!!

 Whalers. Of course some stoner at the calendar company may have realised the significance of the date and put an appropriate entry. And you don't get much more appropriate than the spliffmeister himself.

 Interesting urlLink Top 50 games but Bungers got me thinking I should include Revs+ C64 in my top 10 - and then this top 50 reminded me that I also played the Sentinel on C64 for months on end.

 Follow up from the reclassification stuff... urlLink Bob Marley died in 1981. It says so on our office calender for today. The fact that he actually died on Monday 11th May doesn't seem to bother the makers of said calendar. A stern letter is going to the manufacturers - Randon Non Date Related Facts Calendars Inc. Q. How does BobMarley like his doughnuts...? A. Wit' Jammin.

 It's the urlLink ABC song with some new lyrics . NSFW.

 After that urlLink shock I needed to urlLink ask Dr Judith for counselling.

 Here's your bl00dy prize then!!! Find out what happened to urlLink tigger .....!

 urlLink You may have added 2 but you didn't drop 2 so your top 10 is in fact now a top 12. Yay for imperial lists, boo for metric lists! :) As to the Revs character name - haven't a clue! And you urlLink never stump up the prizes anyway :)

 Awesome video of a urlLink car being taken out by mini gun - unfortunately has inane WWF style commentary. The site also has lots of weird pics and videos - some NSFW!

 My first post of the day is going to be strangely related to both of your postings.... If you haven't heard the album urlLink Speakerboxx / The Love Below you must rush out and buy it! (If you are a hifi buff it'll really test your system's timing, but I digress... these albums rock!) Second thing was, I need to revise my list of top ten games... urlLink 1080&deg; Snowboarding urlLink FFVII Dunno how I forgot Final Fantasy, and 1080&deg; is just the finest game... Still can't justify putting Revs in there, but it wins the award for Funniest Game Character Name Ever &trade; Prize for the first New Linker who can guess who I'm thinking of!!

 And YA urlLink take on Hey Ya - this one is even better then the Charlie Brown one!

 With time being such a precious commodity these days it seems silly to take a couple of hours to go see a film. Now you can &quot;see&quot; them in less than a urlLink minute . Of course if you are from sundlind it will still take you several hours so you may as well go and see the film. What's that? You don't have a cinema? Snigger.

 These urlLink out take clips from Canadian news show CityTV show something very distasteful - the fact that ITV can show a programme like &quot;TV's Naughtiest Blunders&quot; and not have clips anywhere near as good as these probably means there are much better clips to be had. We demand to see Richard call Judy a &quot;fscking bint&quot;.

 getHTMLForIcon("boobies"); --> A collection of urlLink Tijuana Bibles . And in anticipation of the next question, an excerpt from the FAQ. What is a Tijuana Bible? Tijuana Bibles (AKA eight-pagers, bluesies) are small (~2x5") illustrated pornographic tracts printed primarily before 1960. The skimpy stories usually framed contemporary movie, sports, political, or cartoon/comic book stars in absurdly hyperbolic sexual situations. Most bibles consisted of 8 stapled pages. Sometimes you'd get a bonus frame from another title on the back cover, probably a printing mistake. Some were printed in a larger format with 16 pages. Page counts vary, but most stick with the tried and true 8-pager format. I've never seen a "color" bible. Inside pages are black and white (or shades of such), with an occasional splash of red outlining on the cover. The "artistic" quality is usually poor-- most feature atrocious grammar with illustrations just good enough to tweak a sexual response. (There are notable exceptions, of course!)

 getHTMLForIcon("weed"); --> Quite amusing article on where you can urlLink light up in London - the chats with the police are particularly good.

 urlLink The Online Guide to Whistling Records is just what it says on the tin.

Obviously a lightweight!

 That's urlLink chess done with Flash rather than a very impressive version of chess (remember urlLink BattleChess ? Best. Chess. Ever. Except of course the infamous networked chess Dogs and I wrote about a squillion years ago. The handover mechanism consisted of us waving at each other at opposite ends of the room to tell each other we had moved.). Don't worry - it's not as hard as urlLink these - I played it in Shallow mode and beat it in 11 moves (including it's own).

 Yes,i do agree this is rather silly. You're The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe ! by C.S. Lewis You were just looking for some decent clothes when everything changed quite dramatically. For the better or for the worse, it is still hard to tell. Now it seems like winter will never end and you feel cursed. Soon there will be an epic struggle between two forces in your life and you are very concerned about a betrayal that could turn the balance. If this makes it sound like you're re-enacting Christian theological events, that may or may not be coincidence. When in doubt, put your trust in zoo animals.

 You're Love in the Time of Cholera ! by Gabriel Garcia Marquez Like Odysseus in a work of Homer, you demonstrate undying loyalty by sleeping with as many people as you possibly can. But in your heart you never give consent! This creates a strange quandary of what love really means to you. On the one hand, you've loved the same person your whole life, but on the other, your actions barely speak to this fact. Whatever you do, stick to bottled water. The other stuff could get you killed. Take the urlLink Book Quiz at the urlLink Blue Pyramid .

 Apparently I'm a Jurassic Park sort of guy. Bloomin' load of crap that is. You're Jurassic Park ! by Michael Crichton You combine all the elements of a mad scientist, a brash philosopher, a humble researcher, and a money-hungry attracter of tourists. With all these features, you could build something monumental or get chased around by your own demons. Probably both, in fact. A movie based on your life would make millions, and spawn at least two sequels thatwouldn't be very good. Be very careful around islands. Take the urlLink Book Quiz at the urlLink Blue Pyramid .

 getHTMLForIcon("mad"); --> Then you too can have a urlLink hole in the head . Here's a quote: &quot;The recent resurgence of interest in trepanation, largely due to websites on the internet&quot; Now is it just me or does any else think that sentence just proves the interweb is full of nutters?

 I'm Ulysses apparently. My results: You're Ulysses ! by James Joyce Most people are convinced that you don't make any sense, but compared to what else you could say, what you're saying now makes tons of sense. What people do understand about you is your vulgarity, which has convinced people that you are at once brilliant and repugnant. Meanwhile you are content to wander around aimlessly, taking in the sights and sounds of the city. What you see is vast, almost limitless, and brings you additional fame. When no one is looking, you dream of being a Greek folk hero. Take the urlLink Book Quiz at the urlLink Blue Pyramid .

Or have you been giving pearl necklaces to young boys again?

 You young whippersnapper! urlLink Michael Parrish's indeed! A real old timer would recall it as JT Parrish. I bought my 1st (and 2nd) 48K ZX Spectrum there.

 getHTMLForIcon("monkey"); --> getHTMLForIcon("gay"); --> getHTMLForIcon("jeebus"); --> Da Prez Bush would probably be a bit narked with semicolons at the moment if he knew what they were. It seems that an urlLink erroneous semicolon has thwarted attempts by conservative groups to stop San Francisco's gay wedding fest. Why would this bother Bush? Because he's a crackpot, crusading, christian fundamentalist who amongst other things is trying to ensure a urlLink gay couple can never get married presumably in order to prevent a Sodom and Gomorrah type disaster happening in the USA.

 This urlLink game is not the Railroad Tycoon sim but is in fact a version of Pipemania with trains. Actually I vaguely remember a game like this on the C64 or Spectrum. Anyone remember the name of it? I think it may have been on one of the &pound;1.99 labels like Firebird, Mastertronic or Codemasters if that helps.

 getHTMLForIcon("boobies"); --> urlLink Kylie p.s. If you want a definition of bungers I would just look for the synonym of urlLink facetious ! I'm also there under "good-looking" and "The Legendary Swordsman of Byker". ;)

 getHTMLForIcon("lego"); --> That's no moon - it's a urlLink Lego Death Star . Incredibly detailed model including the urlLink trash compactor .

 getHTMLForIcon("shit"); --> Sincere apologies in advance for anyone likely to be upset (I was) by this urlLink rather offensive site. You have been warned. NSFW edit: But for what it's worth urlLink this was my favourite.

 Hooray!! Fussy defined at urlLink UrbanDictionary . And hopefully by tomorrow morning you should be able to look up urlLink Bungers too. I sense a defintion for dogscogs appearing soon and it won't be too complimentary.

 All you nancy boys obviously struggled with grammar taught under conventional methods. Here are a urlLink few lessons more in line with your orientation. NSFW

 I somehow doubt our little group will ever have need for this but should we one day be required to write some urlLink postmodernism bullshit then this page will do it. The text you see has been randomly generated - there's a link at the bottom of the page to generate some more. Anyone fancy submitting one of these articles to Living Marxism?

 getHTMLForIcon("ninja"); --> If you don't know your differential equations from your elbow watch out - urlLink YI is about. And if the site looks familiar it's because the design is based on the urlLink Ultimate Power ninja site.

 urlLink The urlLink BBC is reporting an email scam aimed at MBNA customers. I received one yesterday but it got diverted into my spam bucket so I didn't see it until just now. It's very crude technically. It embeds a gif file (click thumbnail to the left for full size) which looks like a normal marketing HTMLised email (even down to the bad grammar!) which looks like it has a valid link in the standard blue, underlined text. The whole gif is in fact a clickthrough to the spoofed login site. What concerns me most about this is how exactly have the phishers got the email addresses of MBNA customers? I smell a breach of the Data Protection Act. I'll give them a ring tomorrow and see what they say.

 Bung Bungers BkingKat Grasshopper Unit Grammar Kid obviously just loves winding people up to attack him - he wants an urlLink iPod . I'd read about this happening in America but just like every other fad it's come here too.

 getHTMLForIcon("jeebus"); --> We need a web enabled version of urlLink Threat Alert Jesus to see if it's worth visiting New Links today or whether it will be mostly bickering about grammar.

 Sister site to urlLink Movie-A-Minute , urlLink Book-A-Minute allows you to pretend you are way more widely read than you actually are.

 I don't know. I go to the dentist and come back, dribbling mouth all agog, anticipating dead bodies and everything. And I find you've all turned into peace loving hippies, practicing free love. pah. Your pints are all puffs. Anyway the urlLink Sine link ILuvNufc posted earlier has a picture of urlLink wor hoose . That's ILuvNufc's and mine. We moved from that one about 20 years ago. I'll quickly point out that we aren't shirt lifting &quot;life partners&quot; but siblings. If you follow that row to the left for about 12 houses you'll find urlLink Chez Tweedy . Also on the same estate lived urlLink Jackie Lye of Brush Strokes fame. And Ant &amp; Dec lived in our lockup with Jimmy Nail. probably.

 Apologies to urlLink Grammar Kid and ILuvNufc . Anyway &ltlight blue touch paper&gt that mmChronic has been setting us up against each other from the start&lt/stand well back&gt

 getHTMLForIcon("rockstar"); --> Sorry urlLink dogs , I'll make sure I pay more attention in the future!!

 getHTMLForIcon("handbag"); --> ILuvNufc wins by a urlLink technical knockout Bloomin' eck!! Grammar Kid totally bottled it AND he credits mmChronic for all my efforts to get a scrap started!!!! It was me man. Dogs for fscks sake. I'll tek yes aal on with one hand tied behind me back and blindfolded.

 I've already got urlLink this so if it came down to a photoshop contest, I'd win anyway, by default! ;)

 getHTMLForIcon("not shit"); --> ILuvNUFC was so polite.... I just had to oblige! There's no room for flame wars here! tsk tsk mmChronic for encouraging things.... ;)

 Not soft just taking time to consider my options and to see if my demands are met.See you's tomorrow for my revenge if the offending article is not removed.

 getHTMLForIcon("handbag"); --> Whilst I'm on my Superhero theme.... I can't believe how soft ILuvNufc has been in responding to the defilement of his image. I was hoping for a monumental battle a bit like urlLink Batman vs Spiderman . But take a close look at the grammatical style and punctuation of this article....Could it possibly be...?????

 Which reminds me of the urlLink Fantastic Four and the urlLink Silver Surfer

 Good day to you all.I am representing the internet police dept. on behalf of ILuvNufc and i demand the removal of THAT picture posted by Grammar Kid.It is considered to be in poor taste and unless my demands are met this site will be charged with "displaying obscene images" I hope never to have to deal with this offence again and trust that you will move it or the balanced shall be re-dressed.

 Sorry this is extremely late,like he usually is. He wanted a bit on Inter-Web fame.Oops,nearly forgot my full stop.I live in fear of being corrected.

 getHTMLForIcon("handbag"); --> I'm stunned - so much that I can't even be arsed to rise to urlLink yet another punctuation debate with mmChronic - tasty as it may seem. I'm far more interested in this urlLink can of worms

 getHTMLForIcon("handbag"); --> Just as there is urlLink no excuse for incorrect spacing after a comma there is also no excuse for urlLink not ending a question with a question mark or a urlLink sentence urlLink with urlLink a urlLink full urlLink stop . Glass houses etc. snigger.

 Seeing as you were so polite!

 I can't believe mmChronic has invited the whole of the local population to our night oot. The clever thing would have been to say that nobody is invited. Not that it would make any difference to the number who turn up but at least we'd feel less rejected. By the way, if anyone is reading this, mmChronic will be the one sitting next to the three good looking blokes. Wassup with Halo? As Halo is down I'll just post my comments here... Had a thought...we won't be alone on Friday night. There will be Mossad agents, suicide bombers, RIAA lawyers, FBI...

 getHTMLForIcon('boobies'); --> It seems Bungers has posted the hottest story to date. The urlLink Ustka Mermaid is generating loads of hits from searches. Unfortunately they all seem to be looking for pictures. Did anyone find an actual picture on that site? I just saw a crappy logo thing with it on. This could be a job for ILuvNufc - he is used to delving around Polish sites looking for potato vodka recipes or something.

 I have found a urlLink link to the greatest download ever made available on the interweb. Honest. Edit: Bleedin Halo lost again. I can't wait to read comment 73.

 getHTMLForIcon('punk'); --> The music has been class all morning (and all yesterday) but one of my favourite songs atm just came on - Alakaline Trio's We've Had Enough. Ironic really considering it's about turning the radio off and listening to proper music instead. As DG of the BBC I reckon Bungers should buy urlLink Redder2k Radio for the nation.

 getHTMLForIcon('pirate'); --> Morning me hearties! Feast yer land lubbing swabbies on urlLink this story that says "We find that file sharing has no statistically significant effect on purchases of the average album in our sample. Based on our results, we do not believe file sharing will have a significant effect on the supply of recorded music". Yaaaaaar!! In other news, we were second last in the pub quiz last night. We had a strong starting round (2nd place out of about 12-14 teams), but we then went "all crap". What riled me even more than usual was the fact that there were some filthy students who commited the following nefarious deeds: Bought one drink each and sat with same drink all night Started out with four members in their team. Their ranks slowly swelled to eight by the time the quiz started. The "file size limit" on each team was imposed at six members at the start of the quiz. Used mobile phones to ring up their filthy "mates" for the answers (not even sneaking off to the toilets or anything) Won the jackpot question with a lucky guess and walked off home with more money than they all came in with put together. And one of them didn't have the decency to even smoke her tabs properly. Fuskers.

 According to this urlLink post at Ben Brown his ex-company sold it's hardware when it went bust to Blogger. He made sure he wiped his nads over the hardware - and some of those servers are now running BlogSpot. ewww. Of course it doesn't beat Gazza's famous genital wiping incident. Apparently just before the France World Cup, Gazza and several other England players were apparently left alone with the Jules Rimet cup. Gazza is alleged to have wiped his bellend all over the globe bit at the top of the cup. So of course when you see the clips of people like Le Bouef, Viera et al kissing the cup they are in fact kissing a fine layer of Geordie smeg. Post a link to the story please - although of course it may well be an urban legend but that won't stop me repeating it as fact.

 getHTMLForIcon('monkey'); --> According to Snopes, an email is doing the rounds accusing John Kerry's wife of urlLink owning companies with sites in foreign countries - Heinz to be exact. Big deal - but it's not even true! I don't know why they are bothering with the dirty tricks as they'll just rig the result in their favour again anyway. The Democrats need to release an email about Chimpmeister Bush's wife's penchant for fscking chimpanzees. That's how AIDS started. Probably.

 The Xbox has been dropped to $149.99 in the States. What has that got to do with Bungers? If the price drop makes it to the UK he might be able to get one. Oh and the urlLink press release features Paris Hilton. via urlLink engadget .

 This page has some blurb about urlLink Sony's PSP presentation with a camcorder recording of the first PSP game, &quot;Death, jr&quot;. I don't know what it looks like yet as I'm still downloading it but the article has claims of it being better than a PS2. In your hand. /drools...

Ooh a console in each hand. link (indirectly) via urlLink 0xDECAFBAD .

 getHTMLForIcon('lightside'); --> getHTMLForIcon('catweazle'); --> It seems that the reason we're not getting any 's is because there is a urlLink shortage of hard drives . Read the story though, and you'll learn that "the hard drive that powers the device"... what..?? so the boffins at Apple have discovered a way to turn the momentum from the spinning hard drive into elastictrickery..?? Or have they wired the hard disk to a dynamo, so it can generate it's own source of perpetual power..?? That'll solve those pesky battery life woes! Grrr... Reporters! I'll run 'em all up the yard arm! Yaaaaar!

 This is a Newlinks appeal! Off out for a pint tonight, and tonight we're up for some Pub Quiz action. Now, we normally frequent The Chilly Arms, or urlLink the New Bridge .

Does anyone know of any more quality Quiz action for a Tuesday...? And please don't say there's one in "The Raby"... I've been barred from there for fighting. Yaaaaar! Pub reviews courtesy of urlLink www.theburglarsdog.co.uk . All it needs is a Pub Quiz Review&trade; section and we'd be laughing!

 getHTMLForIcon('football'); getHTMLForIcon('webcam'); --> I'm surprised this one hasn't been mentioned yet. There was a lengthy report on the local news last night about our (NUFC) being the setting for the first part of the &quot;Goal!&quot; trilogy. It was confirmed quite a while go that we were in it but yesterday was when the publicity machine started going into overdrive. BBC Tyne has a story about it urlLink here . nicked from urlLink nufc.com .

 getHTMLForIcon('boobies'); --> Then I give you urlLink FreeBooble . Yet another pr0n seeking parody of the major search engines. The crucial difference between this and urlLink Booble &amp; urlLink YasexHOO is that there are no ads whatsoever. This pr0n search engine stuff is obviously very popular - I'm off to write Altered Clitsa. Did I mention this is most definitely NSFW?

 Apparently Microsoft have announced a urlLink joint PC and XBox development platform . Hoorah. I think????

 getHTMLForIcon('boobies'); --> Seems everyone's at it these days - Councilors in Ustka, Poland think their urlLink Mermaid needs bigger breasts. She is also "a bit fat". Shizzle! I was supposed to be going for more mature, well written posts this morning to bump up the score on the old "Grammer-o-meter". Oh well, more t1tt1e5 and b33r stories anyone...?

 getHTMLForIcon('punk'); --> Wahey - we lifted a link from urlLink Look at This ! ILuvNufc has a Punk Pop link in his sidebar that goes to urlLink Redder2k Radio and very enjoyable it is too. There have been no DJ's spouting twazzle so far - just streaming punk goodness. dogs need not apply - it's not 'proper' punk.

 getHTMLForIcon('mad'); --> urlLink Ron the Nut is a collection of writings about L Ron Hubbard the Scientology founder. There's some really insane stuff - apparently he believed urlLink smoking prevented lung cancer . Yay! urlLink Dublin can start smoking again ! I'm not going to take the piss too much in case a hit squad of Tom Cruise, John Travolta and various other celebrity Scientologists arrive outside my door.

 Google have launched a urlLink Personalized Search on their urlLink labs website . You click on a few interests which are stored &amp; then when you do a search the results are restricted to your search terms and interests. Unfortunately for dogs there is no shirtlifting category for him to select.

 getHTMLForIcon('football'); --> Loads of classic Football clips are urlLink here. Including Gascoigne's goal against Scotland.Still brilliant

 According to urlLink Readability.info New Links is a bit thick! We have a Lix score of &quot; urlLink 28.6 = below school year 5 &quot;. Must do better! There are a plethora of other statistical benchmarks on the site but unfortunately without any comprehension of the systems used the results are meaningless to me. But that should raise our score a bit. pinched from urlLink Presurfer .

In other news this morning : Gamestation are selling urlLink PN:03 for £18.99!

Please leave mini reviews and suggestions in the comments field. Ta!

 getHTMLForIcon('guybrush'); --> Are those urlLink point'n'click adventures just a little too new fangled for you? Then you'll probably be right at home with some classic urlLink text adventures . The site has 6 playable online so far. The first one is Adventure (or Colossal Cave). The very first time I played with a computer it was to play this at a very poorly attended computer exhibition thing in St Theresa's school when I was about 11/12. I say poorly attended - there was a bearded bloke who was running it, 3 computers (Apples I believe but I'm not going to swear to it) and me who only wandered in on the way home from Heaton Park. I spent ages playing this adventure and was hooked on computers from that point onwards. The others on the site are Atari Adventure, Rogue, Zork I, II &amp; III.

 getHTMLForIcon('shocker'); --> urlLink Nasa jet smashes speed record . It's only 12ft long you know... but it did 5000mph. Mini-me signs up for pilot training course.

 It seems the 10 Speccy games I urlLink posted yesterday run too fast. So to make up for it here is the homepage of an emulator called urlLink Hob that has 19 games playable on the site with a fair degree of overlap with my list yesterday. But what if you wanted to play one of the games that was on the list yesterday but not on Hob's? Well then you go to the site of urlLink JX Speccy which has 5,500 (count 'em) games online. They even have urlLink Moon Cresta for ILuvNufc. I think that should make up for it. Sorry!

 getHTMLForIcon('monkey'); --> How will the Chimpmeister get re-elected? By engineering some event or other to raise his popularity like the Thatchbitch did with the Falklands. Unknown News are giving you the chance to predict which urlLink 'surprise' event is going to happen . The winner (or winners) who predict the event and date that raises George Bush's popularity gets a wallet sized Bill of Rights. Shame that it's useless to us and increasingly more useless for the Americans.

 getHTMLForIcon('wacko'); --> urlLink CourtTV have quite a bit of coverage of Michael Jackson's trial but best of all they have a gallery of urlLink images from a collection of Wacko memorabilia . The bloke is a loon!

 In a shameless bid to wrest the multipost title back I'm going to be inspired by urlLink the friday five which lists 5 questions on a Friday which you are supposed to answer and list on your blog. All well and good but I believe Friday should be used more productively so here is New Links Friday 10 - 10 Spectrum (or Timex if you're American) games for you to play in your browser. Yay. urlLink Ant Attack urlLink Batty urlLink Chaos urlLink Chuckie Egg urlLink Elite (that's the last we'll see of Bungers) urlLink Manic Miner urlLink Jet Set Willy urlLink Lords of Midnight urlLink Scuba Dive urlLink Zynaps There are other Spectrum games to play at the homesite of urlLink Jasper , a Speccy emulator. For all the Spectrum stuff you could wobble a urlLink memory expansion pack at check out urlLink World Of Spectrum which has emulators, more games (but none by urlLink Ultimate !), urlLink programming documentation, urlLink manuals and lots of other stuff. urlLink Planet Sinclair has a lot of information on Sinclair products and is a good read. You may also want to read reviews of the games (or just relive your youth!) in urlLink Crash or urlLink Your Sinclair . All hail the mighty urlLink Clive . Ooh look - 10 links to games, 10 various other bits of linkage + the main link to the Friday 5 site makes erm... 21. Result.

See we've been getting a lot of traffic from urlLink Google lately, and a lot of it's been from the good ol' US of A. See I love lots of american things... after all, they gave us the urlLink Hollywood and urlLink Carmen Electra . They also invented the urlLink SawFish , which is the worlds first underwater chainsaw wielding robot. It cuts down trees that have been submerged under lakes behind urlLink dams . Speaking of chainsaw wielders, anyone who's seen the front cover of urlLink Edge this month will see they got some coverage of urlLink Resident Evil 4 (or urlLink Biohazard 4 as it's called in Japan). urlLink Capcom established the "survival horror" genre with the release of the urlLink first Resi game in 1996. Hand's up if you remember urlLink Alone in the Dark - the game that kicked it all off in 1992. And that should put me in the urlLink Guinness urlLink Book of Records . ;)

 getHTMLForIcon('pirate'); --> urlLink Banned Music has been started to aid in the distribution of music that the record companies don't want you to hear. If an artist gets legal threats this site will set up a BitTorrent stream for their music and distribute it for them. Unsurprisingly the urlLink Metallica / Jay Z mash up referred to on Tuesday has been banned already - and yes Banned Music has a stream for it. Will we see one of Bungers' works on here one day?

 getHTMLForIcon('death'); --> There have been rumours that urlLink Kurt Cobain , the urlLink Nirvana frontman, was murdered knocking about since his death. urlLink CobainWasKilled.com seems to think so. They say they will be revealing the truth between March 16 th and April 3 rd . They are doing this via a series of questions. Amongst their clues are the fact there was a similar episode of urlLink Law and Order (script written by urlLink this ?), a urlLink Siskel &amp; Ebert (WTF!?) review of the case apparently came up with a 3 thumbs down for murder and urlLink Courtney Love 's latest album not selling because Nirvana fans aren't buying it. The last clue is of course ignoring totally the fact that the stuff she does is crap! That and the urlLink increasingly urlLink erratic urlLink behaviour means no one is interested in Courtney Love anymore which is presumably the reason her behaviour is getting ever more bizarre urlLink even going so far as to accuse rocker urlLink Ted Nugent of paedophilia. Of course she may be telling the truth about this but the strange way she revealed it included 'phoning the urlLink Howard Stern show, then going in and spilling the beans. For more on Cobain's death check out urlLink JusticeForkurt.com which has a lot more background info. /regains New Links multipost record with ease - 14 links :)

 As mentioned in the comments on this urlLink post I promised an exploding whale and that's just what you've got. QT movie in 2 sizes - urlLink 3Mb &amp urlLink 11Mb . Synopsis: a whale is found dead on beach &amp; local town too cheap to get rid of it properly so they stick half a ton of dynamite inside it instead. What they weren't expecting was the deluge of huge chunks of whale blubber (leave sound on - you have to hear the sound of falling whale lumps at least once in your life) - big enough to destroy cars they landed on. I love the smell of exploded whale in the morning.

 Morning all! Nothing on the TV last night, so I had a chance to do some preparation for today's award-winning post for the award-winning NewLinks . I thought I'd bring you a round up of this week's science news, and a selection of interesting stuff from elsewhere around the ol' interweb. The science news is all skanked from the excellent urlLink New Scientist website. After all, they do say that it's where the real news exists these days. We'll have none of your vacuous weekly celebrity worshipping, or political tittle-tattle round here. Anyway, on with the linkage... getHTMLForIcon('jeebus'); --> Let's kick off with this story about an urlLink expedition that will set off to Turkey in the summer with the aim of finding Noah's Ark. Fair enough, you might think, but they're going to investigate "what they believe to be a mammoth structure some 45 feet high, 75 feet wide and up to 450 feet long that was exposed in part by last summer's heat wave in Europe". Chuck in the obligatory conspiracy theory, in 1957 Turkish air force pilots spotted a boat-shaped formation in the Agri province. The government did not pursue the sighting, as the entire area, including Mount Ararat, was off limits to foreigners because of Soviet complaints that explorers were U.S. spies - and you've got the makings of the next Indiana Jones film. Mr. Spielberg, you know where to find me. And if running around on a mountain is not quite your bag, why not try running around chasing after UFOs in Iran. It seems flying saucer fever has gripped Iran after dozens of sightings in the last few days. Read more about it urlLink here . getHTMLForIcon('mars'); --> getHTMLForIcon('robot'); --> We also haven't had much news from mars lately, so here's a quick check on the progress of the rovers. urlLink Spirit sets a personal best and Opportunity nears next target . Staying on Mars for a moment, the funniest page title of the day must go to urlLink this one which tells you all about NASA's plans for the next mars expedition. getHTMLForIcon('wotw'); --> Movie News : This looks like it will either be really good, or really, really weak. It's urlLink 'The Day After Tomorrow' , and it's got Jake Gyllenhall in it. He's the kid in Donny Darko. Any way, the movie's about what would happen if there was some kind of mega storm that obliterates the world and sends us all back into the Ice age. Kind of like what would happen if there was a nuclear winter I suppose. And that's exactly what you might get when you discover that we (Europe) could be in urlLink nuclear disarray as our borders push east and we have the inclusion of the ten new countries that are joining us tomorrow. I, for one, welcome our new Lithuanian overlords. getHTMLForIcon('robot'); --> Anyway, I digress. If the Lithuanian strippers don't get us all (fingers crossed), maybe the urlLink robot traffic cones will. That's right, herds of robotic traffic cones could soon be swarming onto the A1, closing down lanes and slowing the traffic. Check this out though - each fleet of robots is made up of a lead robot or "shepherd", which is equipped with a GPS satellite receiver, plus a number of less expensive "dumb" units. The shepherd takes up its position, and tells the other road cones where to go. I, for one, welcome our new conical overlords. getHTMLForIcon('robot'); --> Robot news story number #3 features a robot, who this time, is armed with a urlLink superglue gun . But instead of fixing things around the house this one "could finger bomb suspects". Not what you want first thing in the morning. It seems that when a bomb disposal robot destroys a suspicious package, crucial evidence that could trap the would-be bombers can be lost forever. Again, more interesting stuff from the ol' urlLink New Scientist . And if super glue won't fix it, how about a nice bit of soldering action? That's right kids; scientists have added the trusty urlLink soldering iron to their nano-toolkits. They've created an atomic-scale conveyor belt that may also be the smallest soldering iron ever created. The new device, which ferries molten metal, is made from carbon nanotubes just 20 millionths of a millimetre in diameter. I think that's even smaller than a grain of sand! Woo-yay! That is small! That should keep y'all going for the next five minutes...

Well it is tomorrow actually but the celebrations take place on the night before - like Christmas Eve for pagans &amp; wiccans. Probably. Religious question of the day - how do pagans know how to do their ceremonies? They seem to be all based on these ancient holiday dates which are all pre Roman. If this is the case there are no written records from that time so the pagans must either be guessing what went on or they must be in possession of the oldest British documents. Ever. You decide. I'm off to dance around a fire, making up a quasi religion as I go.

 ...or maybe it was the fact that it's long awaited urlLink stock market flotation has been announced. The IPO is expected to reach $2.7bn when the first batch shares of shares is sold by online auction which means that Google is worth about $20bn.

 Tired of VPL or the now unfashionable look of thong-sticking-out-of-top-of-trousers? Then you might want to try urlLink Anti Panti - removes the need for underwear altogether. Yay. I'm all for anything to do with the removal of ladies underwear. Seriously though - this has to be one of the silliest ideas ever.

 EDIT: Before you visit this site read urlLink this page first. You know it makes sense. We haven't had any games for a while so here is a link to ensure we don't need to post any for the next decade or so. urlLink 10000Games.com has erm... 10,000 flash games online. lifted from urlLink linkfilter .

We ain't got no fool "DIANA CRASH PICTURES" or "DIANA CRASH PHOTOS" here! Mr T! We don't have a Mr. T icon! Inconceivable! I will remedy this situation ASAP!

 getHTMLForIcon('boobies'); --> Too much foosball and socio/political comment on here for my liking these last two days, so here's another picture of a hot urlLink chick who you can pay a dollar, and she'll let you take her picture! (SFW - it's a Yahoo news thingy)

 Want to try it out? urlLink Blogger is offering we active bloggers the chance to try it out. It says it is only being offered for a limited time so if you want a go, go now.

 No doubt everyone will comment on urlLink this story today. So here's my two penneth... He was a f*****g c**p football commentator. Good riddance.

 London Calling has been the subject of a mass mashup. The result, urlLink London, Booted is available here and in all good record shops. Not.

 getHTMLForIcon('ninja'); --> According to urlLink ThumbBandits Ninja Gaiden is to be censored for the European market. The decapitations are to disappear. What's the point of playing a ninja if you can't cut someone's head off with single stroke? Bloody censors. Why couldn't they have just given it an 18 rating? I saw something a while back saying most Xbox owners are above 18 anyway.

 getHTMLForIcon('mad'); --> Prison signs urlLink with this generator .

 Take urlLink the test to see if you can tell the difference. I got 6 out of 10 which means... It was 50-50, and that's how well you've done.

I've just signed up to urlLink BraveNet as they do polls with added image goodness. With any luck you should see the results in the sidebar. I was going to put the poll directly in the post but Blogger doesn't seem to allow Javascript in main posts anymore. Shizzle.

 Here's a flash anim of the Beatle's &quot; urlLink Come Together &quot;. You can even put it on karaoke mode by clicking on it. It's fittingly quite surreal with lots of morphing objects, flashing backgrounds and other graphical effects. It's almost like a demo. Maybe that's because it is by urlLink Melon Dezign . If you didn't own an Amiga you may not have heard of this crew but they did some lovely little intros. It seems they even do web design now and their urlLink design site has some more nice flash anims including a very good version of &quot; urlLink I Feel Fine &quot; via urlLink linkfilter

 The new comment count code has been rewritten once again. urlLink I said I'd fixed it for Mozilla and I had. Sort of. I've been using Firefox more and more and noticed that when there had been a lot of comments to read ones I'd already read would appear unread after I read few more. It turns out this is due to a limit to the number cookies you can dump on a machine from 1 address. IE suffered the same thing but it seemed to have a much higher number of cookies allowed so it took longer to see the effect of it. I thought this might have been a problem when I urlLink first wrote the new comment code so I had a half idea how I was going to do it anyway. So I've dumped urlLink Bill Dortch's cookie library and got hold of Stephen Chapman's cookie library from urlLink Felgall . This one has built in array handling so I'm storing all the comment counts in one array which gets stored in 1 cookie. I also now set the cookie when you enter the page the comments are on. Previously it was in the 'onclick' property of the link to the page. This meant it was only set when you clicked the link from the main or archive pages. If you came in through the 'Previous Posts' link or from a search then the cookie wasn't being set. That's sorted now so new comment counts should reflect whatever you have read regardless of how you got there. The next problem I can see is when the cookie gets too large and you can't write any more info to it. I think it has a 4Kb limit. That's plenty of comment counts though so we shouldn't hit that too fast. I know how I am going to do it but I'll worry about that if/when we hit the limit. Right I know most of you fell asleep 3 paragraphs ago but this bit is important. If the new comment count isn't working delete your cookies for this site - you may have reached your limit and the new fangled one can't be created. It may also be that you are caching an old version of the page without the new code (this happened quite a bit during debugging) so you may want to try the New Links patented urlLink Anti Green Screen Key&trade;

 We have been getting loads of hits for urlLink this page through people searching Google for the aforementioned 10000 games. After I'd posted this link urlLink ILuvNufc pointed out it was a massively expensive paysite where they wanted you dialup a UK premium phone number at a cost of &pound;1.50 per minute. Ignoring the fact that most of us here aren't using modems and a lot of our visitors are from overseas anyway, it's a bit on the expensive side when there are so many free flash games to be found on the net. Where? Here are a few free game sites we've featured: urlLink LucasFan Games (not Flash but still free) urlLink The Flash Games.com urlLink Nothing To Do? urlLink 2 Flash Games (they've got more than 2!) urlLink Dizzy: The Collection We've featured many more than this - have a look through the archives listed in the right panel. And to finish off with one last blast at 10000Games. I've just been for a look at their site to ensure I got the pricing right ( urlLink sorry if that's being anal dogs !) and the latest game added at the time of writing was one called Skater Boy. I happened to notice the character in the thumbnail looked like one of the characters in Ed, Edd and Eddie which is a cartoon my daughter watches on urlLink Cartoon Network . So I went to their site and funnily enough they have a skateboard game called &quot;To the Ed-streme&quot; featuring the same graphics. So we have a choice of Cartoon Network have licenced their game for use to 10000Games knowing it is an incredibly expensive service which is probably out of the financial reach of Cartoon Network's target demographic. Not only that they have even allowed them to change the name of the game. 10000Games have ripped off Cartoon Network. You decide. In case you need any help with the decision the two pictures are partial screenshots of the websites - click on them for bigger shots. urlLink Cartoon Network's version urlLink 10000Games' version

 Although the location of Springfield is still a mystery, an accurate map of the town itself exists. The urlLink Guide to Springfield USA has a very detailed map of all the locations you could think of. They've done this by mapping the relative locations of buildings etc as seen during episodes of The Simpsons and have ended up with a map in 9 large sections. I'm still trying to find the Simpsons' house.

 ...or &quot;Saturdays are shite with no football #1&quot; This site is a bit like the urlLink October Surprise site we featured a while back. The premise of that one is that Bush will pull some surprise move in October which will jack up his popularity allowing himself to swindle the election for a second time. The reader is invited to predict what the event will be. The urlLink Osama Bin Lotto site has decided the event is the capture of Bin Laden. The unknown factor which the reader has to decide on is when will the capture be announced. Note that is the date of the announcement and not the capture itself. via urlLink Hal's Stoopid Links

 We've had international swearing before featuring a urlLink Welsh swear page and a truly urlLink global swearpage . We've even had the urlLink mother-of-all swearword collections . But we haven't had a guide to urlLink international obscene hand gestures . That's that sorted then. The page features the English V sign including a lovely picture of the urlLink Thatchbitch telling her adoring masses to piss off. It's a bit fuzzy on the history of the sign though. I always thought it was first used after the battle of urlLink Agincourt . This was supposedly due to the practice of the French cutting off the draw fingers of any urlLink English longbowmen they captured which then made it a little urlLink difficult to use a longbow . The English archers &quot;gave the Vs&quot; en-masse to the advancing French just to let them know they were ready for action. Remember kids - swearing is big and it is clever. It's part of your history. Yay! via urlLink The Flophouse

 Here's a toon fan site - urlLink Serwis Newcastle United from Poland. It's full of transfer gossip like this interesting(?) snippet: ?rodkowy obro?ca Bordeaux Marco Caneira znalaz? si? w orbicie zainteresowa? dzia?aczy Newcastle. Woo? Yay? Probably? New Links will of course provide translation on request via the multilingual ILuvNufc who has picked up a smattering of Polish during his exhaustive trawls of Eastern European sites whilst looking for Blink 182 bootlegs. Of more interest to the non Polish speakers here may be the urlLink goal videos and urlLink image gallery. Minor quibble here. They also have a urlLink Legends page, or Legendy as we cosmopolitan European Unionists might say, which has some real toon legends. And Barry Venison. Now don't get me wrong I liked Bad Back Bazzer a lot but he's not really a legend is he? Or did I miss something? He's just not in the same League as God, Wor Jackie, KK, Pedro, Shack, Wyn the Leap, Gazza, Sausage Packer and quite a few more. Maybe he got extra points for his lovely hair and waistcoats? ;)

 urlLink Denounce Newswire are reporting that Mikey is going to ensure his latest film, urlLink Fahrenheit 911 , gets to the widest possible audience by releasing it via the BitTorrent network. &quot;This film deserves the widest possible distribution,&quot; said Moore, whose film won the Palme D'Or award at the Cannes Film Festival this past weekend. &quot;I had hoped I could achieve that with Miramax and Disney, but such was not to be the case. I'm thrilled to announce that I have an even better solution. BitTorrent!&quot; Except he didn't. The actual urlLink piece referenced is a spoof, as is every article they post as they are a satire site, but so many people have been linking and reporting it as real they have had to put a big, red disclaimer at the top of this one.

 ...or even sewper-dewper-compewters if you are from sundlind. Because urlLink Alan Turing published 'On Computational Numbers' on this urlLink day in 1936 . This paper described, amongst other things, the urlLink Turing Machine which is a way of defining an algorithm or procedure and this is still widely used in computing.

 urlLink Kuro5hin.org is a geek site with plenty of waffle - just like dear old NewLinks.

 And apparently the Californian Senate (is that Arnie?) is about to limit its powers. urlLink This is why .

 Interesting article on urlLink Pixar and how they have managed to out-Disney Disney. Along the way they've produced 5 excellent films, won 17 Oscars and have 42 patents including one for Z Buffering which I didn't know they had invented. Pixar has come a long way from those urlLink Luxo anims I watched on the Amiga all those years ago. link via Merg (emailed)

 Anyone see the Metro paper yesterday? If not, then you missed a great 5318008 opportunity to check out urlLink Katherine Jenkins who is, apparantly, an opera singer (bit of a crap picture on the link, but you'll get the idea)! Don't know anything about that but she's got a nice set of lungs on her, and she looks a bit like Carmen Electra! Bloody h3ll! ;) I'm off to practice "La Triviata" or something..

 is "probably the single most popular and widely read book on the Arabs in the US military". This urlLink article thinks "It's best use is as a doorstop". This book is full of sweeping generalisations and so, to use one myself, I think it explains a lot about the behaviour of US soldiers.

 We'll have none of your low brow, multiple choice, Excel based quizzes here. Solve the quizzes linked to on this site and you could urlLink be rich , unravel the urlLink secrets of ancient civilisations or even urlLink catch a serial killer .

 Or at least that's the claim of the urlLink automatic ironing robot . No singes or shiny patches apparently.

 What I want to know is how this urlLink self proclaimed holy man can live in this country for years whilst unashamedly preaching western hatred but British "intelligence" have failed to bring charges against him. And then the yanks suddenly extradite him on 11 terrorism charges. Apparently the new US-UK extradition treaty removes safeguards whereby the US had to provide evidence against suspects. Hmmm...not sure I'm happy with that.

 What's with all the Google searches for " urlLink Men with Breasts "??? You freakin' weirdos! mmC and I have been laughing all week at the skillz of the guy in Iran who came to our site looking for " urlLink i need 3d anim girlfriend sex ", but as Commercial Manager of the site I am duty bound to give the filthy mob what they want, so thanks to urlLink PopBitch this week, I bring you : urlLink men with tits DISCLAIMER : I'm not going to click on it, I'm not even gonna test it works, but I would probably suggest that the link shown above is NSFW, Not safe for Life, and even Not Safe for Dogs. Which is saying something. I don't suggest any of our regular readers click on it, lest they feel the need to pluck out their own eyes!

So far only 9 people have signed up, but this is because you can't sign people up when they're under any sort of influence. It's a bit late, but it's relevent to that other thread. ;) And they've got some jive on there now about the hideous urlLink face transplant stuff. Eurgh!

Well now YOU can act out your fantasy by having your VERY OWN gypsy wagon made for you!

 Apparently urlLink not putting sunblock on a 12 year old boy is child abuse and may lead to an 18 month jail sentence for his dad. So presumably people who are urlLink allowing this should receive the life sentences for being an accessory to murder.

 A Hamburg-based opinion poll suggests that urlLink If Your Husband LifePartner Has a Porsche, Follow Him ! Porsche drivers were the least faithful, with 49 percent admitting infidelity, followed by BMW drivers at 46 percent. So if I was on a date with a BMW driver then I'd be inclined to watch them. Ah... but they also get the most sex. If anyone wants me, I'll be the one looking good in the 3-series... I thought I'd "gay it all up a bit" with that LifePartner stuff... seeing as we've gone a bit gay in here today! ;)

 The urlLink Axis of Eve has been set up to expose and depose the lying chimpmeister. Basically it's a coalition of laydees who have designed some anti-Bush underwear and are flogging it. Oh and a gallery of people who've bought them and urlLink submitted pictures of themselves erm... 'protesting'. Bungers will be taking names for an Axis of Eve themed protest march through Newcastle like this one in urlLink Washington DC .

 Iraq is old news. Everyone is far more concerned about their bariatric tendencies. After all our kids can't go to war if they are all too fat or dead and therefore our MPs are urlLink demanding annual fat tests for our kids . Why a test? Are the parents so oblivious that they can't actually see that their kids are fat? Test result: Your kid is fat. Parent: Oh!!! That explains why the crisps keep disappearing. Here's an urlLink article which explains how the urlLink Kellogg's Winders advertising campaign was aimed at children and was up for an "effectiveness award" at the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising for its ability to fool parents. At the same time it was also the winner of the 2002 Tooth Rot awards.

 urlLink Knacker Factor is a viral marketing site for ProPlus. So why would we be interested? Because it has a sleep quality quiz and when you fill it in you get a graph telling you how tired you are through the day. Which is probably way more scientific than my method of counting how many times I fall asleep in any given hour!

 This is an old one but I looked at it for the first time last night. urlLink BlogShares - Fantasy Blog Share Market is like urlLink CelebDaq except you trade on Blogs rather than celebrities. There is loads more information available than there is/was with CelebDaq. In fact it's like the Championship Manager of share dealing games as it has everything you could possibly want to know about your share deals etc. You get B$500 to start off with and, if you claim your urlLink blog , you get 1000 of the 5000 shares in that. Each link in/out of a blog has a value with links to/from popular sites worth more than those from sites with 1 reader. I piled my virtual cash into the urlLink Bellavista Juventud site we featured yesterday. At the time I invested it only showed our link to it and I knew the link from urlLink SpaceHardware would show up soon plus any others that had been made thus increasing it's value. I hope that doesn't count as insider trading! I should probably read the rules... one day. Oh well if I get caught I can always pull a urlLink Saunders .

 Whilst reading urlLink Stephen Newton's blog , which we've urlLink mentioned here before, I saw a link to a new project of his - The urlLink Museum of Spam . It's a neat idea. Using the urlLink email to Blogger feature Stephen is publishing all the spam he receives at the address for that blog. This is then published in all it's nasty HTML glory. All e-mails to stephennewton.mofs@blogger.com are posted here uncensored. Anyone is free to pass judgement on them... or whatever. Repeating the email address here can only help boost the crap he gets. One thought does spring to mind. It could be easily hijacked by unscrupulous bloggers trying to boost their linkbacks. All they'd have to do is email stuff containing their URL, this would then be indexed as a linkback by urlLink Technorati , urlLink Blogpulse , urlLink BlogDex , urlLink Google etc etc. I'm off to run a mass mailer.

 New icons for usage. That's 3 (Dibnah, Mr T &amp; Science) from Bungers and 1 (toon) from Merg. Have I missed any? I've also changed the search box to use Feedster.

Our posts seem get into the Feedster search database quicker than they did with Google.

This time it's not in urlLink Burundi but in Peru &amp; Newcastle. urlLink Bellavista Juventud was set up in Iquitos and is run by a pit yakker priest called Father Joe Plumb. Finances are tight so the Bellavista Social Club has been set up to help provide funds for strips &amp; equipment. This club is based in Newcastle and can count the best Peruvian footballer (evar) amongst it's members.

I don't know numbers off the top of my head (so I could be talking complete rubbish here) but I remember reading that many more men die of testicular cancer than women die of breast cancer yet breast cancer treatment funding is significantly higher than that of testicular cancer.

 Actually, you may be in for a solution. New Scientist reports that it's risky and some say it shouldn't be done, but that isn't stopping a team of US surgeons preparing to carry out the world's first face transplant. More news as and when I can find it. Insert gag about face being rejected, because you're so ugly. I think this one has the legs to run and run... just remember, you heard about it first at New Links! Note to mmC : I think we need the science icon promoted to the sidebar... I'm gonna run out of bandwidth soon!

 Here's a nice story from our buddies in Amsterdam. A thief broke into the offices of a charity without realising it. So he wrote an apologetic urlLink letter saying he was really sorry. Oh, that site is in Dutch, so for all of our less Dutch speaking readers, here's the same story in more detail (and in English) over at urlLink Yahoo! News - 'Good Thief' Leaves Apology for Burgled Charity .

 Check it out fatties bariatrics! All you need is a DDR machine! urlLink Video Game Fans Dance Off Extra Pounds Edit : I've decided to combine the fruit icon with the science icon for all the urlLink bariatric stories on New Links. That's because fruit is good for you. You should be eating five portions of fruit and vegetables every day to stay healthy. If you're fat urlLink bariatric you're probably not eating enough fruit, and you're deffo not doing enough exercise. See...? Isn't the tinternet useful? You want proof? urlLink Carmen Electra eats lots of fruit. urlLink Fatty here doesn't. Actually, I just found this, and it reflects a serious point that I could be trying to get across. We live in a society where we can do this to our kids? Cue rant about parenting... urlLink Very Fat Kid .

 A truly urlLink international team has remade Maniac Mansion &amp; Zak McKracken in 256 colour PC goodness. Say goodbye to that pixelly VGA cack and revisit these classic games. What next?

 mmChronic and I saw a mystery object floating up the Tyne the other day. And no, it wasn't a brown shark, as it flowed against the tide. We figure it was a sea monster. Anyways, the Sea Monster was floating past a place where there used to be an island called urlLink Kings Meadows . The Island existed until the 1860's, until it was dredged to allow shipping upriver, and bigger ships to be launched from the yards on the Newcastle side of the Tyne. What price progress, eh? We would've had another pub to go to at lunchtime if it wasn't for those pesky industrialists! "this area was a rural riverscape, the main feature being the King's Meadows a 30 acre island. Complete with a Pub, the Countess of Coventry, the island was a popular festival venue for horse racing and regattas and the landlady kept cows to supply the village of Elswick with milk." It's where they used to have the Blaydon Races you know? Fascinating facts... ;)

 This is an urlLink abandoned town in Japan called Gunkanjima . in 1810 this town was created on a reef due to the discovery of coal. As the waste from the mines came out the reefs got bigger. Eventually the town was abandoned in 1974 due to the mines being exhausted. Next New Links trip? If we win the lottery maybe. After our fondness for urban, industrial archaeology demonstrated by our trip to the Byker Cully ( urlLink here - maybe we should have done the pictures in B&amp;W for that arty vibe!) and Victoria Tunnel (still lost in Bungers' mind) this one is a natural. via urlLink Boing Boing .

 This site is dedicated to covering internet stories and determining if they are hoaxes. Stories linked to on the main page include urlLink Wedding Dress Guy , urlLink Mini Cooper Autonomous Robot (so good we've had it twice!), urlLink childless German couple and the urlLink Chernobyl bike ride . Fact or fiction? As well as covering internet hoaxes they have a history of hoaxing in the real world and various gullibility tests.

 Again! Is he like the Queen where he gets 2? Well if the Queen is worth 2 then Mr. T must be worth at least 4. According to urlLink Wikipedia urlLink today (21 st ) is his birthday as was urlLink May 6th . Which reminds me - we need to do a new icon roundup.

 Because he enjoyed the urlLink Da Vinci code so much he might be interested in the urlLink news of a talk that Dan Brown gave . The sequel is about Free Masons and is set in Washington. I wonder if it'll explain the urlLink masonic symbols on the US Dollar . The article doesn't say when it'd due but apparently there is a clue on the cover of the urlLink Da Vinci code which gives some information about the new book. He also said he left out what he felt would be the most controversial plot device - not for fear of it's controversy but because he felt it was &quot;flimsy&quot;. So what was so controversial? He was going to have Jesus surviving the crucifuxion. Which reminds me of something I've been trying to find out for ages. I remember reading a sci-fi book as a fairly young child (9-10) where a Jewish scientist goes back in time, discovers Jesus is a retard and takes his place. He then goes through lots of the things mentioned in the Bible and ultimately gets crucified. Does anyone know what this book is and who wrote it? via urlLink boingboing

 urlLink New Feature ? But it's an old picture from our urlLink Byker Cully report . It's the 1st picture that came to hand when testing our New Feature&trade;. Blogger have introduced photoblogging now. So what does photoblogging mean to we New Linkers? Well I could pretend it's all about riding the cutting edge of blogging and that we are hip, trendy urlLink Generation Xers . But that would be silly. The reason it is going to get used here is of paramount importance to the net's premier cheapskates - it means FREE hi-res image storage! YAY! A urlLink full tutorial is available at Blogger. But the basic premise is download and install a chat gizmo called urlLink Hello , choose send picture, then choose BloggerBot as the recipient. You will then get an option screen for resizing,captioning etc. Once you have done that, choose publish to blog and off it goes. The picture is published as a thumbnail which is a link through to the full size picture. When resizing images for the thumbnail choose one of the two smaller sizes for publishing as the largest size will probably screw the layout of the page. As for the size of the stored hi-res image choose the largest. After all we aren't paying for the hosting! ;) CAVEAT: I haven't looked at privacy implications yet re spyware etc as I had to have a fiddle with it straight away. I'll be going back to the Hello page to have a read soon. ps. Bungers was going to have a look at this and write something but there are several reasons I've done it instead. I couldn't wait to have a play We would be waiting for months for him to do it ;) Most importantly of all he is doing the Victoria Tunnel Report tonight. Parp!

 This site has a form to fill in which generates a link, which you send to someone runing AIM and when they click on it their away urlLink message can be set to what you like . It's a shame that this only works in AIM as I don't know any AOLers.

 Gather round kids, and I'll tell you all a story... Back in the dark days before iPod, there was this computator called the urlLink Mac SE . It used to look like urlLink this . Now you can experience computing as it once was! urlLink Wired reports on the impressive efforts of two German gentlemen that have used Java and other "modern" tools to create a website that emulates a MacSE. Appropriately named urlLink WebSE , this site "...allows anyone, on any platform, to run a facsimile of Macintosh System 7, the Mac operating system circa 1990 You can pretend to be Mr. Scott! Did I mention that you can play Space Invaders on it? Who said there was never any good games on the mac?!! Link shamelessly plundered from urlLink insanely-great . Ta!

Seems like it's "back to the old drawing board", as some might say... &lt;/genius&gt;

 Remember urlLink Ship Of Fools who we featured regarding their urlLink 11th Commandment compo ? Well they launched an urlLink online virtual church last week. How did we miss that one? Unfortunately it has already been swamped with people logging in as Satan and swearing their heads off! The church is partly intended for people on the edges (and beyond them) of faith, so please be aware that the language and behaviour in church is often colourful and occasionally offensive. Please bear with us ? this is an experiment and we're working on creative solutions to the problem of mischievous visitors. Church of Fools is currently not suitable for children. Apparently moderators have been equipped with a 'smite' button! This urlLink article at CNN has more on the disruption. I thought CNN was supposed to be a serious news source? If so how can they say that someone who logs in with a legitimate username &amp; password is a 'hacker'? I've just logged into Blogger so I'm presumably a hacker now. I'm off to get a job as a security expert.

 Hands up everyone who immediately mentally pictured a scene involving North Shields Fish Quay and horny handed sailors? You can relax because it's nothing like that.

 I've just been on the urlLink bStats site which is Blogger's stats stuff for BlogSpot Plus users. Except it isn't. The page says that it is only for the premium service users yet I've just logged in, got my blog list and added the code to the New Links template. It works. Yay! We are currently using urlLink StatCounter which is a really good free stats service with data drill downs by country, referrer etc. The only problem with it is that the free service only keeps the details for the last 100 hits. The bStats service looks like it keeps everything as there are pages to see most popular page of the day, week, month and year. There isn't as much info available in the stats but the fact it keeps the info for longer means it may ultimately end up the better stats to use for New Links. The bStats front page has this bit on it: NOTE: bSTATS is currently free for Blog*Spot Plus users (hey, by the way, upgrade!) and not available for anyone else. If everything goes well, it will be available for others in the near future. So are they preparing to roll it out for free to Blogger users now or have they simply left the back door open? I don't know so I've left the StatCounter code in place for now just in case the 'free' bStats gets pulled for whatever reason. EDIT: I forgot to mention I found the bStats site via a post about bStats' temporary unavailability on the urlLink Blogger Service Status page.

 That's a bit of a coincidence! ;) No sooner do I write the urlLink how-to for On This Day then Blogger publish an urlLink article talking about user hacks and requesting submissions . Synchronicity or what? Anyway I've submitted our hack.

 Here's one to keep you all busy while you wait for the Victoria Tunnel Report&trade;. It's a webring devoted to urlLink all sorts of underground shizzle .

 We are going to have to fly to Ohio for the first international New Links Tunnel trip. The urlLink Cincinnati Subway System was never completed due to financial problems. Before the money ran out they did manage to build 7 miles of tunnel. This dwarfs our previous tunnel trips to the urlLink Byker Cully (approx 2/3 of a mile) and the Victoria tunnel which had less than a mile of the tunnel you could explore. In lieu of a link to the long awaited (delayed due to technical reasons - again!) Victoria tunnel report you will have to make do with the background info urlLink here . via urlLink boingboing

 All the new features added by Blogger in their redesign have improved the design of the blogs no end with urlLink lots of benefits for those who have switched over. We implemented all the things mentioned in that article within hours of the redesign being launched and have been adding further hacks since. I've been meaning to write how-to posts for quite a while now and have finally got around to doing one. What with this and the long fabled Victoria Tunnel report allegedly coming on the same day you must be looking out of the window for the flying pigs now. The first hack to be written up is the On This Day hack. That's because it is the simplest one to do, and by extension, the easiest for me to write up. So what does this hack do? Can you see the date at the top of the page? You'll notice it's a clickable link. The interesting bit is what it links to - the On This Day page at urlLink Wikipedia which has famous events, births, deaths and observed holidays from around the world all of which are linked to good articles on the subject. So for the effort of inserting a little bit of code in your template you automatically get a link of the day style thing for every day you publish a post. Note that you don't need to be using the new designs to use this hack - it works equally well on the old templates too. Onto the hack itself. The first stage is to ensure your dates are in the correct format. To do this go to the urlLink dashboard and then go to Settings / Formatting as shown here. Set the date this format: Set the date language to English. Mine is English UK but any of the English options should work. Save your changes. Now we are going to edit the template to put the JavaScript code in to do the date linking. Before you start you should back up your current template just in case there are any problems when you are implementing it. Done that? OK. Copy the following code and paste it just before the &lt;/HEAD&gt; tag in your template. &lt;script type="text/javascript" language="javascript"&gt; function WikiOnThisDay(dateToMangle) { var dateChunk_array1=dateToMangle.split(", "); var dateChunk_array2=dateChunk_array1[1].split(" "); if(dateChunk_array2[1].charAt(0)=="0") dateChunk_array2[1]=dateChunk_array2[1].charAt(1); return "&lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/" + dateChunk_array2[0] + "_" + dateChunk_array2[1] + "\"&gt;" + dateToMangle + " &lt;small&gt;[Click it!]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/a&gt;"; } &lt;/script&gt; Now find this bit of code in your template... &lt;BlogDateHeader&gt; &lt;h2 class="date-header"&gt;&lt;$BlogDateHeaderDate$&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;/BlogDateHeader&gt; ...and replace it with this code. &lt;BlogDateHeader&gt; &lt;h2 class="date-header"&gt; &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt; document.write(WikiOnThisDay("&lt;$BlogDateHeaderDate$&gt;")); &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;/BlogDateHeader&gt; Save your changes. You can now either republish the blog to apply the changes to the whole blog or just wait until you post next to apply the changes to any new pages created. Feel free to use this code on your blog. If you do use it, it would be nice to get a mention and a linkback to urlLink this particular post would be even better so that other readers can see how to do it.

With all due respect to the deceased I have to say that it's completely ridiculous to even contemplate holding a "ceremony" at the beginning of an international football match simply because somebody who enjoyed football was murdered whilst on a football holiday. At least UEFA have shown some sanity but no doubt they will be criticised for it. And the England team will all wear black armbands tonight. Like they're in mourning. Yeah right.

Only drawback is they can only be delivered to a US address but as Dogs urlLink pointed out before that could be argued to be 'the world'. If they don't go for that I'm sure Merg will arrange for deliveries etc and bring us a big bag o' laxatives back from Amerkia. via urlLink Sciatica

 I knew he was fit but I didn't know he was a urlLink tri-athlete . Of course we all know that twoccing and running from the law are part and parcel of a scouse upbringing so it's no surprise he's doing this too.

 One for urlLink bhell13 . You think that the Roo stuff is funny..? Check out the urlLink Joey Deacon Grand Prix .

 This one is urlLink bhell13 's blog and it's urlLink his description not mine! It's covers the same sort of stuff we do ie gaming, films etc. As he says in one of his posts urlLink leave comments, get linked . Simple really!

 To tie in with the new icon the script from the urlLink Ministry of Silly Walks is here.But best of all there is also a series of animated GIF's of the walk that change when you move you're mouse over them.Cool.

 Bloggerheads is closing down and the last post is titled &quot; urlLink The Parting Shot (for Bush the fascist and Blair the appeaser) &quot;. It's a little 1.3Mb flash animation. Has sound (Eve of Destruction as backing track) but can be watched without. Well worth a watch if only to remind us of what a fscked up world we live in. via urlLink Space Hardware but I've just seen it again on urlLink Flophouse this morning which reminded me about it so they can both have a link!

 He might be able to play football and speak scouse but can he spell? urlLink SpellaRoo should be able to ensure he does. Unfortunately spellings are in amerkinese so the first question I saw was along the lines of: Which of the underlined words is spelt incorrectly? Summar is my favorite season. ermm... both of them?

 urlLink Here is a handful of sleb blogs including Melanie Griffith and Gillian Anderson and the already featured here on NewLinks Fred Durst.

 In preparation for lots of Scouse interviews here's some urlLink handy translation tips . Ey soft lad, givvez an icon will yer?

 Today urlLink The Sun reports (is that an oxymoron?) that Wayne is the new Pele. In their "exclusive" interview Pele states "Roo is the new me". I have a few problems with this... First of all it just bugs me that Pele, as a world recognised ambassador for football, is succumbing to 30 years of everyone telling him how great he is. Any modesty he had is gone in favour of attending a never ending stream of parties under the nomenclature of "the greatest footballer ever" and it seems his analysis of football skills is strictly limited to comparing footballers to his own greatness. Secondly, Rooney is not as good as Pele and anyone who says otherwise, including Pele, is talking tosh. But urlLink Freddie Adu might be the real thing. Doh! If I can't resist the Pele comparison then what chance does Pele have?

 With the meaning of the word 'roasting' being redefined over the last year or so this bit on the urlLink BBC front page made me laugh. Unfortunately the urlLink linked article doesn't carry the same title so I had to screen grab this instead. It goes a long way towards explaining why Abi 'I love threesomes' Titmus ( urlLink Further roasting here ) was in the Hell's Kitchen thing that has thankfully just finished.

 Before the launch of the next generation 60Gb iPod with bluetooth, colour screen, and crack flossing facility urlLink Apple Unveils Adapter to Link iPod to Some BMWs . The iPod will be powered by the car, not the iPod's battery, and you plug the iPod into a cable in the car's glove compartment and then can control the iPod using the standard buttons on the steering wheel. Also works in the Mini Cooper. Sooper Dooper! As you might say if you were from somewhere filthy, not a million miles from here...

 Today is a very special day and not because it's Zinedine ' urlLink hoy hoy ' Zidane's birthday. It's the anniversary of the day urlLink Lorena Bobbitt set her husband off on the path to becoming a pr0n star. She then drove off into the darkness with the family 'member' and a gameboy for company.

 Still no word from Bungers about where he actually was apart from the fact that he was in an urlLink airport . So I did a little digging in his stats and I reckon it was urlLink Paris .

 We have posted links to Yahoo pictures a few times on here. The most recent one was urlLink Rasputin's tool in a jar . With quality pictures like that it is worth keeping an eye on the Yahoo site. Now there is an even easier way to do that with the urlLink Yahoo popular picture tracker . This site tracks the urlLink popularity chart and plots the data on a graph with thumbnails of the pics so you can see at a glance the most popular pictures of the last few days.

 All the talk of Glastonbury over at urlLink Space Hardware reminded me about this neat "gadget" I saw at the weekend. It's a text message enabled tent, so if you can't find your way home, text the number, and your little home sweet home lights up like a beacon to guide you back. How sweet! urlLink Ch-check it out! Have fun, and watch out for all the hippies... ;)

 A friend has just come back from a weekend camping near Bamburgh and he reckoned a team of archaeologists was setting up at the camp site just before he left. urlLink Bamburgh Castle of course was one of the Anglo-Saxon capitals of Northumbria. Apparently this team has been excavating the area around Bamburgh Castle for the last few years looking for medieval and Anglo-Saxon archaeology. Here's what I think is probably their urlLink website .

 We're going to need some fairly hefty weaponry to make sure that the Kingdom of bungers Northumbria stays peaceful, and we can quell any bariatric revolts. I've ordered a load of these urlLink Hamilton Antipersonnel death rays as it's the "lightest of the rapid fire pulse cannons" and can turn you from a "tank commander into an actual tank". Order more stuff from the urlLink main page .

 The urlLink Eunicycle is a self balancing unicycle built by the same bloke who did the urlLink home built Segway . It costs 1100 dollars to make which is approximately 600 quid. Unless his name is Steve Jobs which means it would cost approximately £874.30 instead.

 All this talk of adverts and millionaire's means we are going to need lots of visitors if we are to be to be Tinter-web millionaire's.How about urlLink this?

 It may have been around for a while but now urlLink Google AdSense is free to anyone and now you get a slice of the revenue generated by ad clicks from your site. Yay! We're all going to be millionaire's!!!!!

 I am unable to check out urlLink this link as I have no idea if it's SFW or not. Assuming it is what I think it is, that age old British sporting tradition of tying two people together and letting them kick seven shades out of each other's shins - but in the nuddie, then I think it would be a great way to solve the Group B qualification problem where England draw 0-0 with Croatia tonight and the Swiss beat France 4-0. Forget play-offs/penalty shoot outs/away goals/goals against etc and just tie Wayne Rooney to Thierry Henry and let them kick sh!t out of each other. My money's on Wayne. Edit: Link fixed and SFW

 Dammit! No paper in the office today, and I need to poop! If I had wiFi in the Thomas H. Crapper, I could read the urlLink PoopReport !

 Mini update on Space Ship One, as it might be today that they go for the x-prize. Expect Vulcans landing on earth later today, possibly. urlLink Private space craft set for historic manned flight

 Apparently Nike have just ordered a load of urlLink Harris Tweed for a new sports footwear line. So does that mean that current Tweed wearers (not wishing to stereotype too much but I imagine it is very popular in Scottish retirement homes) will suddenly seem rather chavaesque?

 I haven't actually been able to check out urlLink this link as it's currently suffering too many hits. So, until it works, we can ponder over the rumour that Bruce has turned down the urlLink 2.75 million bid in favour of staying with Birmingham. Whilst we're on about fitba can someone explain how England are automatically through to the next stage providing we draw against Croatia tonight? What if France lose to Switzerland? Wouldn't that leave us with three teams on four points? Assuming that scenario is resolved by counting goals scored then how can we be certain that we will have scored more goals than France or Switzerland?

 I've now had a go of urlLink GTray and it works wonderfully. It's only drawback is that it opens IE to view your mail rather than the specified default browser. Many people have requested he makes it work in Firefox. I don't know whether he is going to or not - I hope so.

 Instead of a scooter you should have got him a urlLink remote controlled car . via urlLink linkfilter

 urlLink Skype has just gone 1.0 For all those not in the know, its a killer app. that allows you to talk just like on the phone [broadband, mic and headphones/speakers required] to your mates or family who also have d/l'd the app. Like a vocal messenger program if you will. If you have lots of online buddies and wanna chat with them instead of typing, urlLink check it out. FYI l33t speak and smilies can still be sent via a little built in text messenger. w00t! :)
