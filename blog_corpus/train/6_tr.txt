 You probably don't know this but I am working on a web site! Here are the contents:Lain- ep guide, series review,art. Akira-review. PRincess mononoke and spirited away reviews. And of course love hina:ep guide (tv,then movies then love hina again. Before that manga 12-14 manga guide as well. art. Reviews of lh stuff: specials, series overall, manga series overall. Of course the site will not be completed till 2004 in terms of lh stuff. Other anime will likely be added. Art by me send yours though. Links:ar.net,ann,anipike,animehit,animenation,animecastle,advfilms,bandai,love hina sites galore! Thats it! Look for it someday! (very early now)

 Hey see that banner above? Well they have anime dvd for cheap! Like all 25 eps of love hina for 40$ hears the catch though I know nothing about them. And am guessing this is fan stuff, import or something you know bootleg. I wish I had the cash and guts to try and order it (plus the flicks spring and xmas only like 12$ a piece) any way just a warning.

 Okay remember I told you that an employee of the spja was up to know good. Against the fans. WEll apparently he was an ex so it may have not been true but I still don't trust them!

 About time to go to bed got my fan fic for techtv done! Try to get it here if I don't win. Also look me up on animefu.com I am lovehinaotaku

 Reason I mentioned animenation urlLink is this they had john (of the ask john column) go on the pop japan otaku trip tons of photos and stuff to see! HE also has a column q on ronins (not just love hina!)

 HEy I noticed something animecastle is cheaper than animenation! I can get (you as well) sakura diaries box set for 35$ at ac vs 40 $ at an. Love hina dvds are about 3$ less a piece at ac as well. I am so bumed # 10 of love hina is out and I am only ready to read 6 ! BY late june I should have read 7-9 and watched sakura diaries (whole)

 Want animewallpaper? Go to animewallpapers.com!

 Have you ever seen or heard of Burn up excess (and its jiggle meter) well I just finished the series (4 vol. dvd) Verdict: Rental. As for love hina manga 4 & 5 awesome of course! Looking forward to: getting six (very soon) seven through nine by june 1 also am looking into sakura diaries. Now to work on my fan fic! Oh see projectnoir.com its been updated.

 Hey check out the new anipike! It is redesigned has reviews and a column by John mays of ann. Also it seems cn (cartoon network) is not showing new eps (episodes) of kenshin for awhile. Oldies (1-30) for now! Send them hate mail! Also I got my love hina manga (4 & 5) let you know what I think.

 Yeah I am getting ranma 1/2 manga 1! Will let you know if I like it. Also so far I have enjoyed the love hina manga (way more than the dvd series) and am getting #4.

 Hey new blog all otaku! All the time so lets get started with this anime thing! An otaku is a fan of something (anime in particular) anime is a very artisic creative orignial (or not) form of animation done in japanese style, Check out these fave sites of mine! Animeinfo.org (ranma rules) animehit.com (good source) and also see animenewsnetwork.com for news and reviews! see my old blog for a bit more! thedeepthinker.blogspot.com My fave anime include: noir, ranma, and many films! My absolute fave is love hina! See hinalove or love hina google search. Also manga are black and white comics (pretty thick) with the distinctive style read backwords. Also see animecastle.com to do some shopping look for the following in the future: snack review, debates etc. more links

 Ha! I told you saiyuki was only a rental! Animenewsnetwork.com agrees. Also I recently checked out landlock, excellent film definetly worthy a rental (or watch at sputnik7.com) great film! I also took the time to watch sword for truth, cool and action packed short though and could have done fine without the sex scenes it contained. Note: You will need a fast connection and media player, for animatrix:quicktime 6, for the films at sputnik7.com you need windows media player or real player. Also don't forget armitage 3 tonight on techtv!

 Knowledge is more powerful than any force. THe mind is the ultimate weapon. (zen)

 Hey finally watched saiyuki, heres the verdict: good animation some good action and design. A bit much language and it seems aimed a little towards females. Also ever want free streamable anime? Sure. Well see sputnik7.com they have orgus 02 vol.1 & 2 & 3 also landlock vol.1&2 and more.

 Please teacher! Is also known as onegai teacher onegai means please in japanese. There are twelve episodes.(hmm, 3or 4 volumes?)

 Blog like mad! I am. Anyway new series out called please teacher, looks worthy a test. See pleaseteacher.net for info on plot,characters, and a trailer. Out some places, Others next week, thats when I get it.

 Finally done working! Sorry review and all of saiyuki tomorrow. Hey want the anime network in your town (i do) see theanimenetwork.com or advfilms.com and fill out the form!

 I do not think I will buy from discountanimedvd.com (bootlegs). Be warned (you have). Also as promised saiyuki later and also note armitage polymatrix is on techtv this friday! Also see ar.net its visible and updated! (will soon be further updated via my ep guide info!) new reviews from the guys already up.

 Hey! Well I am looking into getting my bro the entire trigun series from discountanimedvd.com (only 40$$$) but is it english dubbed? IF you know anything (including about this co. let me know) I know they advertise on my site! But hell. Also watched dual! last night, not bad worth watching. Not buying though! Saiyuki later..

 Ever play sonic? sega g, dc, nintendo gc, gba? Well I played and beat them on genesis and dc now they have sonic for the new tungsten pdas (20$) and lots of games coming! I still havent played since 2 on dc!

 Also I still have gotten no mail saying hey heres some money just hate mail etc. well sorry! But you can still donate, its for a good cause! Speaking of love hina tokyomint statues (3 more this summer but you knew that) well now a mitsune is to be release in october! I like mitsune (not as much as naru). WHich reminds me all the good stuff (except for mitsune who is great) is always gone that sucks! Also on the sam note two more statues will be released after mitsune. Hmm. Keitaro and mutsumi? WHat about a combo of say seta and sarah though? Won't get any anyway :(

 NExt on my taste list (along with more of the usaul) is grean tea pocky! Also coming tomorrow sayuiki dvd review.

 Milk pocky? Yep. Hey you know that stuff I like sapporo ichiban noodles? Or todays pocky? Well you can get the noodles and the pocky (in a bundle pack) for cheap at us.yesasia.com great site for j-pop and anime as well kind of a asian amazon.com

 Update: Rurouni Kenshin is to be realeased by viz (ranma, utena). WHo says they have it licensed but are not sure what will happen: could be in shonen jump,could be released as graphic novel manga or both! (animenewsnetwork.com and viz.com) Also ever have pocky? Alll otaku's should at least have it once! I just tried it for first time (choc, strawberry) excellent!. And affordable. (see anywhere that sells anime pretty much) Note:see thedeepthinker.blogspot.com

 Man I would love to own any of three naru statues but they are 129$$$ if you would like to give me yours or donate $$$ let me know! Also rurouni Kenshin the manga is to appear in shonen jump usa! (gonna have to check that out.)

 Hey fellow otaku's! New anime on tv! Dual! Parallel debuts on techtv tomorrow. I wonder if it is good? Cause so far the only anime I like on ttv is lain. I'll let you know. Also,man love hina is popular! The collectibles are sold out all over only certain stuff remains! Plenty manga and dvds though! Also looking for some photos of ladies on the streets of japan etc see japanesestreets.com oh and think you would miss nothing of the states in Japan? Well what about peanut butter,root beer and beloved cereals. Hardly found in Japan and disliked.

 Yay the magic users club was released on dvd! Just kidding actually this show is as bad as they get not even on the rental shelf (i say this rarely).animecastle.com has it, but don't get it!

 Red faction 2 is very cool. Gaming is cool. Looking for hard to find games or imports? Anime etc. check out videogamedepot.com and for stuff (particularly comics game based-funny!) see pennyarcade.com

 HEy not just anime and all games to latest: red faction 2 (xbox) great fps! Look into it. See redfaction2.com for more

 ar.net has everything up and running and will soon have the email newsletter up. THe quiz/column section will be up monday. Also check out the sfgate.com (sfchronicle site) and look for the editorial on american imagination and spirited away. Most everything in there is true. Imagination is dying creativity is dying and will eventually die away completely I mean look at disney, and all this other shit we call american pop culture, I am ashamed! Oh few comments though:on the whole artsy front I am not fond of this whole label's thing artsy? OR goth, how about pervert!? No. Anime is for all. For all who enjoy a good piece of art (and it is art) and story creativity etc. (note:not all anime is good.) Also big note: Rurouni Kenshin will return in June on the 9th to be exact. Peace :)

 Man I have got to get the japanese import of soul calibur 2 for gc! But it is 60$ plus I need some 30$ software so it will work on my gc! 90$! Guess I will have to wait. :( Also megatokyo has a funny new e3 comic on the site:megatokyo.com

 I am also available at the anihina forum. As animaniac. Also lain is back on techtv. Have a nice weekend! :)

 As you have noticed I have banner ads for bootleg anime. WEll I am actually going to try it out and pic up afew and let you know about service and quality of discountanimedvd.com I will be ordering lain the boxset for only 25$ thats 1/4 the regular price! And two dvd films only the price of one! IF I decide I like them more orders and awareness could take place :) Also Rahxephon, was ok. Didn't watch past first ep though.

 I now have 8 love hina manga 3 chobits manga, 3 dvds, 2 posters and playing cards anime related collection! By the end of the year: 14 love hina & iro hina, 8 chobits, what other manga? And Grave of fireflies, wrath of the ninja, and if possible at least the last two love hina series dvds and both films (all series would be cool) Also important note: vandread sucks!

 I am a new member to the ar.net and ann forums I am animaniac at both. Also no please teacher in my area! But hey I rented Rahxephon and vandread so look forward to that. And also got 3 mor love hina manga. Gotta go!

 A man who seeks revenge should start by digging to graves. (todays zen)

 I may be getting please teacher so look for my comments! Also indeed ar.net has the stuff on the newsletter up!

 Anime-reviews.net has updated adding some reviews and lots of episode guides (from me :) ) so look into it. Also they are starting a weekly column and a news letter, more to come.

 Remember I told you about the love hina eps at finalanime-x.com? Well I've watched 11 and hey okay! The guy who runs the site said it should all be done by the end of this week or something! Also ever wonder whats hot in japan? Well if so see tvtokyo.co.jp or search for it. Right now yugi-oh & pokemon are still big. But naruto is another. Naruto is an manga (gn and shonen jump, manga avialable in u.s shonen jump) is also an anime on tv tokyo and is avialable on dvd at yesasia.com and a game is also out for gc availbale at videogamedepot.com have yet to enjoy any of this though.

 Remember to see my other blog at thedeepthinker.blogspot.com and hey send me mail at: joshdollins@cableone.net

 Hey ever wonder what girl you should go with, in the anime world? Well I say go to otaku.com I took the quiz and was told my girl would be belldandy! I also took a quiz on anime stereotype or something. I am the strong quite fantasy male! That is good looking and fangirls will write about! But apparently I am gay or at least bisexual?! Check it out. Also ever want to see the love hina japanese import episodes? Well get them at finalanime-x.com (sadly in poor quality).

 I blog alot huh? Anyway get this recently heard some army dudes got their a$$'s kicked by a geek group at e3 playing america's army pc game! Also I have found the kenshin movie (not x) available bootleg import at discountanimedvd.com for 12$ hmm.. My next anime purchase will be the animatrix and 2 manga a mag (newtype) as well as a test taste of the Japanese soda ramune! (all at animecastle.com!) Sorry for the lame info and ads! :)

 Hey heres my so so lain fan fic that was rejected by ttv. I am not very good at fan fic and I admit that the winners are superior to mine. Lain vs Lafiel:The Ultimate Battle via the wired! It was late, around 2 am as usaul lain was in front of her navi on the wired.Lain had heard on the wired that a space craft and its crew was to come in.She had also heard that it was lafiel, who lain despised due to the fact that lafiel had the space ship and all it made lain jealous.And so lain decided to take out the one she wished she was, thus getting the guy (lafiels boyfriend on the ship) crew, and ship. But how? After a session of thoughtlain settled on hacking the ships system which was connected to the wired! Around 5 am lain was in the ships system via the wired. She decided to cause the controls that lafiel was using to fry her to death! And so she did, lafiel was dead! Lain could now possibly take command once the ship landed. However the ship did not land. It exploded when it landed killing everyone on board including the man and power she longed for.

 Yeah I got two new manga and spirited away, I bougth them! Also rented noir vol. 2 which is great I enjoy this series, I just hope it gets better it has potential.

 Okay get this as i told you long ago there was a lain quiz part three its on the web now at techtv.com as is a character guide,five winning fanfics (not including mine) and the show ends soon by the way. Also a show I am looking into is Silent mobius on ttv see site for details its in the afternoon. And uh.. thats all!

 Yeah I got payed! and yeay the last volume of samuria x is out. I will rent it and let you know overall what I think of the series. Also I think I will buy spirited away finally and 2 new manga. So look forward to that coverage next week and me being a happy little guy! :) Also I recently discovered xm radio has a jpop channel (i want it for summer!). Okay today is the end of e3 so keep up at the sites! And later.

Ninja Gaiden and DoA are lookin good. And I am really psyched about mgs3 and onimusha 3 I am still not sure on. See game sits like:gamers.com and gamespot.com

 Yay! I found somewhere to get my anime for rent! Its way better than netflix (.com) its greencine (.com) they have tons of anime! Now if I could actually sign up (parents ) I want to rent:Excel Saga 1-6, Love hina 5 &6 plus movies and berserk 1-6! That will take,about a mont or two and I have summer coming up!

 Okay e3 has officially started! And will end on the 16th. So far all I have heard is this price drops on ps2 and xboxes of 20$ I recommend checking in on gamespot or gamers for more. Also I am still playing snk vs cap 2 eo my fave characters are:terry,kyosuke,sakura,hibiki. What are yours? joshdollins@cableone.net

 Oh and yes I have a new sponsor imaginationunlimited.net check em out!

 Hey get this a recent poll of sorts shows studio ghibli as one of the five most trusted co. in japan the poll was taken in Japan. Note: see animenewsnetwork for more.

 Man so many words but which is most important or how many exist you ask? Well the answer is simple, one: honesty

 Hey I am here yet again! Anyway I am currently looking into the matrix game thats out so look for that. And I may be seeing a movie so that to (not xmen!) and uhm also check out pennyarcade.com's comic today on the matrix and powerade!

 Also animesuki (and the software it supports) has Gundam seed as well as DNAngel. So look into that. Oh and my current fave game:capcom vs snk2 anime:love hina and wolfs rain. Noir (only seen vol 1) manga:lh and chobits later

 Yeay I will soon be able thanks to finalanime-x.com watch/ finish love hina (he is putting them in bigger sizes to! Also I just tried out wolf's rain you gotta check it out! There are alread 14 eps and way more coming see:animesuki.com and my fave fansub group:live-evil.org

 Okay time for things I dislike about anime/industry:newtypes coverage of cartoons, tokyopop's misspellings and they tend to do to much westernizing oh and there lizzie maguire cinemanga, what the hell! Also not fond of anime dvd price 24-30 bucks that sucks! Ok also I have watched munto the oav from kyotoanimation it is there first work and is not half bad see munto.com I give it 3 of 5. Note: i have not had game in awhile gonna go insane!

 Will soon have some reviews for you of fansubs! Also there are some non japanese games I am interested in:call of cthulhu looks very cool look for a author and his books called H.P. Lovecraft and the film Dagon! Also see the games site:callofcthulhu.co.uk :) also of course is halo 2. IT just seems all the other games like moh are big on the past and lack new/creativity and of course shooting people. :( but some are good.

 anime-reviews.net just added new ep guides by yours truly for astroboy and beyblade. :) as well as other stuff.

 A rather good comic for lain is up. :) at techtv.com

 Dbzb2? Yep. God no more! Please its torture!

 Bored? I am. What to do? waste time! See newgrounds.com this place is huge even on fox news and ttv sometimes but be warned some stuff is bad:hentai links,humor, and there tshirts to (although some are funny!) I recommend checking out xiao xiao games, fun! Also they have a ranma date sim sounds cool. Later.

 I am/will finish wolf' rain, such a good series go chek it out! And I may or may not another called kiddy grade which is ok. Both are at animsuki.com just download the client and you will need divx. Broadband is recomended slow. For wolf's rain get live-evil's sub and also I am looking into a film not yet here called munto I will let you know if it is worthy the dl. :) oh and remember only download stuff not yet released/licensed in the U.S! :) Peace

 Another stupid splinter cell game? yea. I mean I don't dislike us games but I just don't care for them much. IN sc's case i would rather play mgs and am more excited about new mgs games. Also whats with these lame U.S games painkiller and full spectrum or whatever? Don't care. Heres some noteworthy stuff:new xplay covering nintendo at e3, pennyarcade update, and oh yes a note divx is spyware ridden!

 Why do cosplayers have to be so ugly and look so stupid? I mean just look around the net or in the may issue of newtype. The dvd was fine now they have me wanting to finish boogiepop phantom! Its creepy and reminds me of lain. Anyway I also found out that my statements of the voice actor for haku in spirited away being a non anime fan were true! And now I need to watch lupin.

 I just checked out my first newtype mag (see newtype-usa.com or advfilms.com) I will say adv publishes it and in this issue (may) had lots of there commercials and coverage of there new and suky show saiyuki, but overall they are not very biased and I liked it. Inside the issue is stuff on the new animatrix and also a little something on chocolate by one of clamps members. I also found there info on tv anime nice sinc I am checking out fansubs. I will let you know what I think of the dvd included soon. Also coming a look at a show called munto (see munto.com) and a series called scrapped princess. :):):):):):):)

 Hey I may soon be a ttv anime network member! When I am you will see there graphic (maybe) on the site. ALso lupin the 3 is back on cn's adult swim new episodes to!

 Okay pennyarcade has some nice new e3 coverage so see it! Also the n-gage does look lame nintendo will continue to rule the market. I doubt a new neo geo (that would be sweet!) could dethrown nintendo's gba! Don't forget to watch xplay cover e3 on ttv. Out.

 Hmm.. e3 celebrities who cares! Games, are what its about! Although I won't argue on the whole boothbabes thing found more pics at xbox.com :)

 Also e3 I learned that a new game based on the Berserk anime is coming (no date set) to the ps2. THere is one already for dreamcast. OH and chek out the gamecubes answer to gunvalkryie its PNO3 from capcom.

 Kiddy grade has been licensed by funimation, so don't download anymore! Also there is another animaxis site in Japan that airs the new show ghost in the shell tv series, glad that was pointed out to me. And uh oh in addition to manga's ninja scroll tv series there is indeed ghost in the shell and shadow skill. You can find all but ghost in the shell for download let you know what I think of them soon.

 Check it out, kenshin manga coming to shonen jump in november! Also ann is back online thank god. :) And uhh oh yes check out animaxis.com they have action figures cells and best of all manga I found love hina in Japanese only 4$! Peace.

 Alright. Time to complain comic based films why so popular? Cause there american, shallow and easy to enjoy,star prett people and nice cars. Will I go see one? Hell no. WHy did keanu reeves have to be nude? Didn't. WHy did xmen have to be so big on pretty boy and the car? Didn't oh and another comment, what kinda story is that.Hulk? Ah jesus forget it. Alright why do people dislike anime but like this crap? Cause there shallow as deep as a puddle. Animation is so much more creative and mor can be done with it, and in anime (Unlike cartoons and u.s comics) you often get some good story and stuff. Matrix is by far the best of the comic crap bunch. OH and animatrix is out!

 Techtv announced in a newsletter available at techtv.com/animeunleashed that they will be showing soul taker at the end of June and Gate Keepers 21 in July. Boogiepop phantom which is alot like lain in ways gonna be great!

 Ok there is a new tokyomint love hina statue:mutsumi! Personally don't care I want naru. Oh and where is Motoko and keitaro? I want those two! Also miyazaki-san and studio ghibli have done a set of 4 commercials for japanese food co. see ann for details on this news! Oh and ar.net has improved its forums check it out. :)

 HEy I finally got my hands on the love hina spring movie Spring movie,love hina review: Video-was of great quality no complaints here :) audio:dolby is supported and the tunes are awesome! :) english dub voices I am not fond of :( story:ok. But not as complete as the manga which is the real story see #8 in particular. extras:are great you get the music videos from tv and the movie and japanese option. Notes:The film is 50 min and is directed by Yoshiayaki so an so (sorry) for more info see:lovehina.bandai-ent.com Also note Akamatsu san (original story writer and manga creator) makes an animated appearance and lends his voice to his animated self :) Overall:Not a bad film at least worth a rental if die hard like myself buy. I was not very pleased with the English voice actors at all that was the biggest let down.Story could have been better. Music nice and it was definetly funny and well animated. And little things like the menu and box were really well done. :)

 Okay gamespot's e3 awards are up! And also here are mine:multi:soul calibur 2 ps2:mgs3 gc:f zero runnerup:mario kart dd xbox:halo 2 runnerup:doom 3 Also xplay will have coverage soon on ttv. And also see oxm's new or upcoming issue with a focus on halo 2 I have yet to pick it up. :( Hope your weekend is going well! :)

 Wow tokyo has been japan's capital for 400 yrs as of now! And also check this place out yesanime.com and also in Japan they actually list those who paid most taxes:Hikaru utada and Rumiko Takahashi are among top. I like utada's tunes and RUmiko's ranma is great! Well thats it.

 Thanks somewhat to me the au boards at ttv.com are even better have alook.

 Hey again. Shadow skill the series is not as good as oavs the tv series is a sequel which so far I give 3 of 5 pts. Also darhorse announced they will publish new manga:trigun,hellsing and a novel based on the film Ringu. Strange no word of berserk well maybe later. Or perhaps viz will pick it up?

 Hey sup. Let me just say 50 cent sucks. You want music? Yoko Kano,bob marley,311 and linkin park are good for summer among others. Also animatrix is out tommorow in fact you can even rent it off of ppv on digi cable. Oh and yes blue gender will soon be on cn as well as new kenshin and possibly new pilot canidate. Summer has begun!

 Yeah! I saw the new halo2 demo vid you can get it at ign for stream I recomend that saves hard drive space. Also look into gamers.com and gamespot.com to download. I believe a site linked at bungie.net supports bittorrent as well. :0 I Got to get the second halo book rent mc2 and preorder halo2. Yeah! later.

 Hmm.. am I still gonna or still am gaming? Well recently played the matrix game and gonna tell you its not worth buying. :( also looking into midnight club 2 on xbox man so many great things about it:4 player support,8 player online support,dolby digital,and around 30 cars. Plus no tracks completely open! Let you know how I like it. :) oh and of course the game based on the italian job.You know theres an old movie of italian job and a psone game? THere is.

 Hey hows it going. Just checked out urda, its a 3dcg anime having to do with time warps,ww2,nazis etc. I liked it (its plot was good and cool) there are five eps which = 30 mins. or so. download=100 mbs or so. see animesuki for all you need. ITs by a russian film group named romanov and was subbed by hqa (high quality anime) also risky safety (from an entertainmen,eventually 3 volumes,first volume in JUly.) has its first episode for free on net see animenation. This is another series I hope to see! :) later

 Rose of versaille I believe is a better choice for female viewers (that and its to long for me ) so there. Also I have watched the first episode of fmp (full metal panic) adv's new release which i will say is an excellent anime that is certainly worth watching! I will let you know about urda later.. :)

 Well I am currently enjoying kenshin on tv! And kikaider info is on adultswim.com its a 30's style anime with crisp clean appearance, I don't like it though. :( Also I have watched a film called black lion:from adv 45minutes in length I give it a worthy rental award! Also I am looking into and old manga/anime/opera called rose of versaille (french) let you know what I think,currently 7 eps are available from live evil of 40 in total. Also found a mini-series called urda that looks cool. Stay tuned!

 Hey! Kenshin is back on cn! ANd with what appears to be less edits! Oh and a new show I will discuss called kikaider is on adultswim tonight! Umm oh and wanna hang? go to the au boards at auniverse.net later

 Hey fellow otaku! Sorry been awhile if your looking for a good film I indeed support checking out animatrix:most of the episodes are availble for free but you also get a great documentary to watch. Make sure you have the uneducated watch by the way! Also current fave music:boA all the way new cd out called atlantis princess. See jpopnation for some mp3's later

 Hey things are going well and back up over at auniverse.net and also see animecritics.com its a cool site and uh out!

 ann is back up. Kyoto's will be down till otherwise noted k? Anyways funimation has a site (kinda) for a series they recently licensed which I enjoy (kiddy grade) it is kiddygrade.tv k? Good. Anyways other than that I don't know what else I am to say except man there are few anime shops to choose from. I think I will stick with animecastle and hastings. Also capcom and rockstar will be releasing gta 3 in Japan! OH joy! WHo cares? Well some do.

 Well sadly animenewsnetwork.com is down and kyoto's place is down! This sucks! (auniverse.net is kyoto's place). :) Full metal panic is a great series by the way I recommed checking it out!

 I forgot to say live-evil (.org) a fan sub group fave of mine has celebrated its 1 yr anniversary as of june 24th, I say congrats fellas! Note:there first series was condor hero which has seen some recent movement in there part they also released today wolf's rain 21. Anyway also check out this site:popmatters.com its cool and the column: from here to shinjuku is a must read for we otaku. :) Anyway other than that I will also say animesuki does seem to be done so try animex.com or a.scarywater.net for sub dls. :)

 Hey gueess what blogger has a new version! Its nice i like it. ANyway i have found a searchengine for blogs which I have submitted this site to just so you know oh and the site is urlLink also if you are looking for anime, I highly recommend boys be a very funny series for teen guys like myself its fun. 13 eps and there all out, I woll say the guys who subbed it could have got rid of the logo in the corner and made fewer spelling errors though.Just in case the searchengine for blogs is blogsearchengine.com

 Charlies angels animated series anime? NO. SO there anyway if interested the series (all six eps) are at animatedangels.com but be warned everything about it sucks. Anyway also for some reason reuters (news service) is calling stripperila with pamela anderson an adult animated program to air on tnn are calling it an anime, it is not. Not everything that is animated is anime. So there. Oh and the show I spoke of last is cyborg 009 and it is still on next monday on cn. :) later.

 kenshin is still going on cn at least till episode 48. Also the new bebop movie is out (and cheap at least for anime) tommorow. A new show is coming to cn called android 009 hmm.. its next monday. And uh.. yeah unless you wanna here me talk about random things and potter, goodbye!

 Hope you had a good fourth! I did. ANyway animexpo is almost over so licenses will mostly cease, I wanna see who one the awards and the freaky cosplayers! :) Oh and more conan is out up to ep 9. Have a good weekend!

 Well official bandai has licensed wolf's rain as well as stratos 4 (which was just underway in being fansubbed, wolf's rain was nearly done being subbed!) bandai also licensed Ghost in shell tv series stand alone complex as well. Adv announced they will do mangas including:najica (they are releasing the anime soon) along with demon city shinjuku and darkside blues. Adv is also going to release toys and such in the future. Whoo all cause the urlLink animexpo if you don't believe me, you will. OH and future boy conan is way worth getting subbed!

 Hey! Good news urlLink animesuki is pretty much back online and will be totaly soon! Also urlLink wolf's rain has been licensed so it will be hard to find to download and I encourage you not to even if you find it, remember the code!

 Well woopity-doo! urlLink Sinbad is made with urlLink linux ! Well although thats cool everyone who says its the first animated film to be done with linux is wrong many anime have been done using linux somewhat or entirely, this is nothing new really! So there.

 Hey urlLink animsuki is still down but till then see urlLink animex for your anime! Also urlLink animenewsnetwork has a new column on manga "tokubon tower " is the title I believe I nice column for us readers! :) Anyway remember to visit urlLink anime-reviews.net for my ep guides and some great reviews, stop by the forum for sure as well!

 As expected cyborg 009 or android 009 on cn is much like kikaider and like kikaider I am not fond of it. Also note urlLink animesuki is down. And brute force for xbox is sadly as expected nothing new, its in every way unoriginal. Still somewhat good though I say 3 outta 5.

 I was just over at urlLink animenewsnetwork where I found an article calling for pioneer and trying to gain awareness for a title known as boys be it is a romantic anime that is very realistic even more so than love hina which I have previously given the title (yikes ) anyway till its released (and lets try) get it off urlLink animesuki and elsewhere I am sure. IT is pretty great. Note:released by pioneer in 2000 is 13 episodes long more info at animenewsnetwork. :)

 Wow been along time! Anyway kenshin is still on cartoon network just moved to around 10:30 at least my time check urlLink cn's site schedule to see your local time. Also I have learned my man Ken Akamatsu's latest manga is coming stateside in february 04 thanks to urlLink tokyopop he is creator of love hina. Also tokyopop announced a boxset for chobits will include:a box original with #8 the last manga of the series and an action figure the box will be big enough to fit all the manga. Oh and I recently took tao feng for a spin on urlLink xbox see the site for details I feel it was an okay game not very original but fun and mostly well done other than the fact you would soon get bored with it and it loads to much and to long. Three outta five. Rent.

 yo anime baby! urlLink Tokyopop and urlLink suncoast are doing a deal where at any suncoast store (not online) you can get 3 manga for price of one! Also katsuhiro Otomo's nex film steamboy due out in 2004 in theaters and later here in the usa has a website urlLink steamboy.net mostly japanese but oh well it works for now. Note: katsuhiro has worked on works such as; akira and metropolis. Also the hit critically aclaimed movie junkers come here is out on the 19th of this month so preorder and look forward to! Also boogiepop phantom is now on urlLink ttv although past ep 4 now.

 well I am now a bit interested in this urlLink phantom thing I like the idea of a machine I can play pc games on more comfortable and such plus the try before buy (demos, video etc) service infiniumlabs sounds cool oh and rentals to all via the net (if only my parents liked the idea they paronoid) still don't know what games will be on it or what it looks like. :( excited though cause we shall know august 17 and the system should be out by xmas! gonna be under 400$ also so thats good and it should i hear play dvds,cds and stuff to. Lookin for somethin to play though? Try crimsonland by urlLink reflexive the demo is nice but after about 1 hr you gotta buy for 20$ I recommend buying. :) ann has a list now so check out my "my anime" I am animaniac!

 Heh been awhile agian anyway urlLink animenewsnetwork is celebrating its 5th anniversary congrats guys! Anyway stop by everyone and help with the redesign you might win something and list the anime you have seen/own with the new forum feature I am animaniac look me up! I aint finished though. :) later!

And stop by urlLink suprnova.org and use the program to download the trailers for the third and final lotr movie! yay! December! Also as for the fansub download scene:avoide divergence eve not good show the animation is nice (all though characters breasts are to big :( to big! its bad otherwise to only good animation really. Not much on the sub scene ragnarok is ok.

 Also if you are looking for the fooly cooly soundtracks go urlLink here they got em for 12$ although they are not official imports but eh. Also for those of you looking for more otaku blogs here is one although we dont always agree on animes (see the overated anime feature) we do mostly on politics :) urlLink kiyone.blogspot.com

 sorry bout the urlLink blackout nyers. :( good luck though. :) anyway rumors are floting about that Blood:the last vampire will be adapted to live action by the director of freddy vs Jason oh joy! *sarcasm* all this anime to live action stuff I dislike really the only one I am interested in is lupin.

 hmm.. games bad kids cant play unless educational blah blah blah! okay check out urlLink penny arcade's latest post/comic and you get it. i mean what they say is true. And games are good also see egm's lates issue for comparison.

 Soul calibur will soon arrive on august 26 on all consoles ! The english version has three exclusive character including one named berserker. And then theres spawn for xbx, link for gc and heihachi for ps2. Also check out this site:geocities.com/krapdivad/quiz.htm I am mitsurugi!

 urlLink Enter the N-Gage: Demystifying Nokia's Portable Game System - GameSpot yes gamespot has great coverage on the urlLink nokia ngage has me somewhat interested it looks kinda cool and radio/cell phone use is cool along with games. Why am I not going to buy or recommend then? Cause the games are all 3 outta five available elsewhere games the only ones I give a damn about so far are sega's (super monkeyball,sonic N) and as gamespot shows its hard to even switch/start playing a game. Not to mention the thing is 300$$ I can get a gba (better games) and a decent cell phone for 2/3 the price and less hastle. Plus I hate nokia. Now a samsung maybe. Get more games and lower price on the console (and accessories) and we'll talk nokia.

 Hey fzero fans first of all remember the new game fzero gx hits the gamecube on the 26th of this month! Also I (and some other sources) have learned of an anime series to begin appearing on urlLink tv tokyo on october 7th in additon a manga will see release it is currently under production. The anime is being produced by Ashi productions and dentsu inc. Ashi productions has worked on such things as vampire hunter D and blue seed among many tv shows also.Dentsu has had its hands in gundam wing and spirited away along with recent items such as:geneshaft, ghost in shell stand alone complex and astroboy (2003). Oh and urlLink megatokyo is taking a break as well as doing some cons see the site for more. :)

 Speaking of Evangelion if you want you can play a decent date sim game on evangelion at urlLink newgrounds Also akira was up for an award for great sound on a dvd (the dts version by pioneer) sadly it lost to minority report. It was only anime involved in the awards and it lost :( really in this category it should have won.

 Bandai has announced a development crew will be developing evangelion the game 2 for the playstation 2. The first game is available japan only for sega saturn and psone. Evangelion 2 is around half way done and is due out in november in japan. Alfa development has also done games for gunparade march anime series and the popular castle of shikigami which saw its latest release about awhile back on xbx. see urlLink gamespot for more and official info

 urlLink Ninja Scroll 1: Series - (Sub) - DVD apparently ninja scroll the series will see a special addition dvd release at bestbuy cool if you are interested. Personally if you are guy its ok but I give movie and tv series (i saw fansubs) both 3 outta five nothing special. urlLink Animenewsnetwork is giving a way 10 copies send in you fanart to win.

 urlLink Why Japan Sucks.... this is pretty good blog its true japan has curupt police and many issues it is also true what he says about the war hell things are messed up but i still love my anime and japanese food and i still think the women are pretty hot. Improvements hell yes! America better yeah. Still not a horrible country and I say we put it all behind us, get along and improve!

 Hey heard of urlLink najica blitz tactics have you?well the site is up click on the title a ways back. Yes it is similar to urlLink noir except it involves perfume and lots of fanservice (pantie shots!) urlLink ar.net has a review up likely a bit generous but eh. Indeed the ultimate edition with dvd and box also comes with a pair of panties, JOY! :) Btw yes it is the work of the man behind project ako which if you have yet to see you must its hilarious! I will let my opinions be known on najica blitz as soon as I can see it (my area is shit for anime) also spirited away is to show up soon in mexico city mexico in spanish will likely see national release around september.

 urlLink TechTV | Is BitTorrent the Future of Downloading? Yes the linux guru and tss are finally showing support for bittorrent a great downloading program! You get anything you want (some stuff you shouldn't) for nothing its free,open source,spyware/virus free, its great! get it! Also check this site out its btt and this is where i download anime (japanese) urlLink animesuki.com Also for those of you looking for anime music vids (amvs) you can get some of my faves here: urlLink delusionalproductions and urlLink rudeboyproductions enjoy!

 urlLink Panderers in Japan This site is hilarious check out arnold schwarzeneger's beer commercials or zztops honda z (car) commercial lots of em her all pretty good.

 urlLink Anime News Network - My Anime - animaniac

 Hey! Noir's final volume #7 is due out on october 28th i had heard this but wanted it confirmed it now has been by my favorite urlLink anime news source also urlLink ar.net has ended its tshirt design contest and will announce a winner this week.

 HEy I cover more than anime! Today I comment on spike tv, it sucks. Simple eh? Well striperilla is an absolute pile if you want animated adult show (of that kind) go for something hentai (perverts!) and as for gary the rat, lame. ALright moving on to the new man show on comedy central (minus adam and jimmy kimmel (other shows to busy) I am going to try and get the dvd of the old cause it was (whether ppl like it or not) great! Juggies, girls on trampolines, wheee! However I dislike the new hosts and fear that they will take things to far. SO if you want adult entertainment I recommend adult swim.

 urlLink ICv2 News - Manga, Anime Retailer Exclusives thats right to get the chobits boxset with #8 an action figure and box to keep the whole series in you gotta pay 30$ at waldenbooks or borders. for akamatsu fans a reminder although love hina ends like now his other anime mao chan involving first graders fighting cute aliens (fun rental) is possibly coming starting in october courtousey of pioneer. And his other manga ai. love is coming from tokyopop in february. Yeay. tokyopop has a page for ailove and there is akamatsu's official site:ailove.net search it cause i not sure. :)

 urlLink Anime News Network - Job opportunities in the anime industry cool jobs in anime industry check em out. I would prefer ghibli or xebec myself.

 yeah! urlLink megatokyo has been moved to urlLink darhorse comics i feel this is better than Ic entertainment darkhorse does the best american comics along side my fave Bongo who does futurama and simpsons. Darkhorse also has done mangas:astro boy, and ah! my goddess. Darkhorse will release the second volume of megatokyo in January and will be reprinting the first. :) My favorite manga distributor? urlLink Tokyopop Darkhorse needs to lower prices and release more quickly and have manga specific site etc. tokyopop needs to lesson the westernization of mangas and should after volume one of each series drop the stupid instructions. Ic? ugh. well there you go see ya!All lotr2 dvd is gold btw! Now to get my games and some manga/anime. Also gundam zz (1-5) and season 2 of full metal panic are now fansubbed on urlLink animesuki

 flcl is to reair again on urlLink adult swim starting october 20th i was hoping they would :) The lotr 2 dvd is great preview of new movie and all gotta watch sam wiars movie and the music video tell yeah what i think later.

 Hehe soul calibur 2 is out now I gotta try and get a copy urlLink gamespot has reviews up I gonna go with cube maybe try to get xbx later i likely will agree fully with the reviews on the whole original better this one still good thing. Hopefully the urlLink official site will see huge update or something and many updates to come fzero is out also and reviewed gotta get that as well. need money :( also if you looking for way to translate pages babelfish is really slow and bad at translating but the other 3 or 4 i have tried are just as horrible with varying success on speed etc. And yes I got the lotr 2 dvd and it rocks let you know what I thought was best till then urlLink buy it!

 well I was the first or one of few to report the story on daft punk's film being in japanese theatres indeed urlLink animenewsnetwork has posted it! :) here's the official french site pretty good: urlLink interstella5555

 heh submitted the below story to urlLink animenewsnetwork hope they post it and its better than just mine i told them to look into it. Also urlLink ar.net has announced the winner congrats man! (wish I had one) see the site for details. Also more future boy conan is now available on urlLink animesuki yay!

 urlLink Welcome to The Japan Times according to these listings urlLink daft punk's upcoming dvd complete with music vids for all there songs of discovery there latest cd to be released this winter is airing in theatres. cool.

 urlLink The Japan Times Online course they won't they make money and dont wanna piss of n. korea thats fine except bad things are being brought in something needs to be done about that and really they should have the guts to at least tell those who financially support the n.korean government to buzz off.

 Also you can get me through a "public" rss feed at urlLink weblogs.com or urlLink blogrolling.com so when I update (and many other blogs it all appears on/in your rss reader (i recommend feedreader although its in beta) also i am looking into setting up an individual one as well. Note also that urlLink haibane renmei's first dvd is out tomorrow as well this is a new anime series from the creator of lain (yoshitoshi Abe) hope I can get it soon. Well later.

 urlLink Soul calibur is out this week (tomorrow) it is 50$ us dollars. On all current platforms. There was a launch event in ny and some good reviews in the current issue of egm as well as at urlLink gamers fzero is out this week also hope I can at least play them. :( Also lotr 2 is out gotta buy that.

I am looking into the service I like the setup its like regular videostore none of that monthly fee stuff 4$ per film! Cool. And well yeah sounds good try it and let me know if its good might take me awhile.

 urlLink Aiming at Pornography to Hit Music Piracy its true but hopefully parents pay attention to what they download its likely they dont. Both porn and music downloading is wrong stop and I dont care that they mention this to stop what they are trying to its good for parents to know one reason I got rid of and hate kazza so much porn pop ups spam and all that kinda crap search for something normal get something sick.

 urlLink Anime News Network - Miyazaki Best Animation Director yes and he certainly deserves that. :)

 urlLink ???????????2 evangelion 2 the game has its official site up now note its in japanese so if you dont read all you can get is screenshots or get a translation program of some sort. :)

 urlLink Xbox.com :: Xbox.com Home yes xbox.com has been redesigned! I like less green hmm.. also new xblive stuff on the site like xsn sports and friends list. I believe version 2.0 of xbxlive will inlcude all these pc goodies ( not sure if 1.0 does guess so) and 2.0 will also include a chat system not in game for up to 16 people thats great a email type system is still needed so when people are offline though! I think I will try and get this 2.0 this xmas but I still gotta get sc2 and fzero and some rentals man, expensive lifestyle.

 urlLink Action - Title yep for vampire anime/movie fans the show (box set and dvds availble and soon manga) is to air on action channel.

 urlLink Anime News Network - Encyclopedia - Releases yeah kenshin box sets to save some money and keep dvds in cool box! 27 episodes gonna have a few box sets yikes still kinda sucks but definetly better.

 urlLink PCWorld.com - Will CDs and DVDs Disappear? not likely many still prefer their discs including me. And many prefer not to steal (although some use paying alternatives) I much prefer a dvd over the current crap movies from urlLink movielink and urlLink cinemanow also It will take a few yrs at least to get discs unpopular and downloads popular. Although I welcome this I still want discs as an option and think they will be around for quite some time.

 Join me in tears for I almost got sc2 yesterday but was not able to afford it when ready to pay :( just thought I would share that. Also millenium actress can be previewed at urlLink anifactor looks good. Oh and I should have said this yesterday but didnt get to so urlLink ann beat me to it but a free (except for shipping) millenium actress poster is now available at urlLink animecastle

 urlLink Anime News Network - Shelf Life - The Spirit of Hunger great column guy is always right on. Spirit of wonder has my interest. I disagree on king of bandit jing rental at best at best! Ninja scroll I would say a rental if you liked the movie i despise both. Love hina is great I am one of those fans who will gobble up and pant for more!

 HEy i have setup rss for jdtheotaku (my other blog) on urlLink myrss and will try to for this blog. IT supports version 0.91 and 1.0 of rss and many feedreaders.

 urlLink AnimeNation News definetly a great movie one i still need to buy :( fantastic movie! sad touching a masterpiece all though of course i have some issues on politics and all that but eh.

 urlLink Blue Seed DVD Beyond yes this is a oav for the series. Not bad but not worth buying and watch the series first and buy it instead.

 well its 9/11 again and to be honest i dont know what to say see my other blog I have some things posted urlLink thedeeperthinker also I recently recieved an email in which a fan of amv's asked about doujinshi which are popular as amv's are here. They are fan made comics like urlLink megatokyo for instance except often based on anime like love hina. You can buy them all over japan and they are a bit hard to find here in the usa but try urlLink mandarake they have cool normal doujin as well as imported manga and cels great shop but they also have lots of hentai and yaoi junk to so you been warned (unless you into all that)

 urlLink New Wave Gaming: Video Game Reviews and News cool sucks it took so long to come stateside, oh and it still isnt actually here! Somewhat understandable it takes awhile to try in japan see if successful then decide to bring here but a real bummer at least its coming though!

 urlLink AnimeNation News i dont watch much tv but in case of say teen titans its cause a lot of kids and teens watch anime so they went with anime styling to get viewers could be viewed the way they did it etc as disrespectful i am 50/50 on that. Samurai jack I feel was admiration partly. And hell the japanese "stole" things from us like games which we started with atari and stuff just a taste of medicine perhaps? well stuff to think about. ANd something to read.

 urlLink Gamers.com : Article heh send em in i did.

The sound is great the music is good and dolby digital 5.1 is supported in game. Multiplayer is fun to so far among 2 people i am defeated only once! Great game xbxlive support (full blown) would have been cool. And i still gotta get the gc edition for link. Also rumble is supported which is cool and by the way I am a joystick fan not d pad. :) overall score:5 outta five not as great as the first but a great game and worthy sequel!

 "The premiere was attended by Cindy and Donald Hewitt, the english language adapators for Porco Rosso as well as Spirited Away. They talked about the process that they go through in translation and how they only had like a week and a half to translate Porco. But you all want to hear about whats next right? Well work is currently proceeding with Nausicaa, with actors currently recording. Those include Patrick Stewart, Uma Thurman, and Natalie Portman. The translation for Whisper of the Heart is done but there is some sort of problem with the song.(They didn't go into it.) So most likely the next movie out after Nausicaa will probably be Pom Poko. Oh, and the DVD for Porco should be out sometime in April. Last, to break all your hearts they said that this will most likely be the only theatrical showing of Porco.

This time around you get major multiplayer possibilities with co-op and multiplayer in addition to multi-player lan which supports 8. The visuals are great 8 outta ten and your sound is fine at a 8 outta ten you have like most "surround sound" gamecube games prologic 2 support which is nice. And gameplay is a blast though if you have no one to play with its not much fun. Not many levels though coulda been more of those and of course could always have hoped for online play.

 Some commentary! First off this show with Paris Hilton now famous all the more for a new "reality" show on fox, I hate these kind of shows especially those that are offensive or distasteful fox does this alot with their shows and is at it again with Paris, I am appalled. :( About the 350 lb man beaten to death I have to say anytime I hear of such a thing I'm not sure what to think he was resisting so it was defense but the tape is horrible and the man died, some punishment is due and an apology I say. :( sad news lately he did have illegal drugs in his system also. And about this college girl Dru I hope she is found alive and my prayers and condolences to the family.

 Akemashite Omedetou! Translation: Happy New year

 urlLink FINAL FANTASY VII ADVENT CHILDREN the final fantasy advent children official site is in Japanese and is graphics intense and takes awhile to load. It includes info, wallpapers, and best of all a trailer. Again happy new years :)

 a quickie, anyway happy new years eve! ITs almost here. Anyway tokyopop contacted me with this info: they have a new survey online for you to let them know what to license next. They've finalized saiyuki so look for the manga! And the third rising stars of manga competition rages on till March 15th :) Gamespot has reviews of Bionicle for pc and crouching tiger hidden dragon for xbox so check those out and if you buy prince of persia no matter what console you get splinter cell for free! :) Happy new year indeed!

 Anime Awards! well I have to say future boy conan was great nice ending also. You really should watch it and or finish it. The author of the fansubs available at urlLink animesuki is going to be selling his dvd official japanese boxset which is worth 200$ it includes english subtitles and all the episodes look for it in coming weeks. Also he and I both would like any fansubbers to try their hand at the brilliant anime cities of Gold a great show much like FBC And now for some anime end of year awards! Best digisub: oh there were plenty for sure wolf's rain and gilgamesh stand out. Out of those wolf's rain is the winner but certainly future boy conan is worthy even if it is decades old. Just the best subs (in my opinion) out of tons out this year :) best movie: spirited away best cd/music: wolf's rain best manga: love hina best new manga: chobits best series usa: noir best series Japan: wolf's rain My favorites anyway :) see you after new years! :)

 No new releases in games for awhile it seems but hey that's ok we'll all be busy. Gamespot is taking a rest also as you have noticed and I'm just layin back. I have a new lupin DVD to comment on and watch, I have the last 4 future boy conan eps to watch and speak of, oh and I saw return of the king today I was skeptical to begin with visually and sound wise the movie was amazing but story and such just kinda was so-so it was ok but well not good enough to end the series I like the first two better and must say the first is the best. The movie seemed to go on and on also way to long... 3 outta five. Guess I can be pretty picky it was worth the watch though.

 Howls moving castle delayed and new TV shows to watch! witch hunter robin will air on February 16th at 12:00/3:00 lupin the 3rd starts at its end January 5th at 1:30/4:30 it begins on the last eps but on the 11th the show will start over at the beginning same time it runs Sunday to Thursday. Howls moving castle, Miyazaki-san's next anime based on a European children's book has been delayed from its original time of July until November :(

 urlLink GameSpotting: Final Fight I did this with gamecube and thankfully no problems but I here lots of bad things about ps2 and xbox being bought early hardware and price were the issues. I rreally don't do this much though just with cube xbox I bought 6 months later, gba sp about a year later (just got one) and well I took a few years (3-4) to even buy a psone and still haven't and may not purchase a ps2. So I guess I don't adopt early or really adopt at all?

 urlLink Steelblood yes the comic/manga is still running and strong! Currently up to chapter 3 of seven is finished so read and sign up to be mailed of new chapters. Also since its original release some fan art and a quiz along with wallpapers have been added so check it out! :)

 New anime in Japan this month new shows include: monkey turn, yumeria and maria you can get previews off of animesuki.com which is currently down so try some of the mirrors. I've seen the previews which were all decent really you just have to watch a few eps so we shall see. :)

 urlLink Anime News Network - Press Release

 rumors galore! Grand theft auto 4 was originally said to be in Vegas by gamespot and others which seems most likely but rumors abound a few of which say Tokyo perhaps. Also it is said perfect dark 2 will be an xbox 2 launch title. They better have it on PC cause as of now I don't really wanna buy another xbox. Also rumors about the new Nintendo system things like the title "n5" are floating about and that the console will play older games. It may also come out as soon as this march. March is to soon how about 2005 march? Or this coming xmas? Even then I'm not sure I'll get one the rumors make it sound thus far like a redux console that plays mostly oldies

 Update: well I recently finished Chobits the manga and must say though the ending was short (all the volumes were fairly short but this was like a 30 min read) it ended pretty well if you like your ecchi manga and a good romance story pick up chobits. Also lupin the third: voyage to danger was a decent film worth a rental and or a viewing it wasn't good or excellent but worthy a watch and a three out of five score. Next I will be getting lupin dragon of doom. Don't forget the original series is on urlLink adult swim starting tonight.

However, some stores report that other similar titles such as La Blue Girl and Blade of the Immortal have remained on store shelves. Suncoast officials were unavailable to comment on the removal. I heard about this at the mall. Didn't look into it sorry. All I have to say is they should remove all such material dammit and really shouldn't they allow such films to exist in their stores but not anime? DO it all or not. I'd prefer they just not sell to the young and maybe have the section its in clearly labeled this is just dumb meh

Not bad, not as good as boys be but I'm still watching it:3 outta five. Lost in translation Dvd : Well the movie itself is great and widescreen is like in theatres you also get good sound and video options otherwise like subtitles and stuff. The extras are great this is one hell of a dvd: 4 outta 5

 urlLink Anime News Network - Japanese Box Office

 R:racing revolution Review platform:xbox Published:namco developed:namco multi? yes for up to 2 players Extras:challenges,hdtv,dolby Graphics: Were good sure but things were missing it seems I don't know all they included was 480p hdtv I would have liked at least 780p to have also been supported and maybe more detail. 8 Sound: The music sucked just your typical instrumental stuff nothing special and no custom soundtrack support. Vehicles sounded ok. 7 Gameplay: Well sure it was fine arcade mode is a nice way to jump in and learn then go to the main mode which is story not that it has a great story mind you just a girl who drives an ambulance real well getting a chance to become a race car driver through some group wippee! Controls were ok and customizable but I was annoyed the vehicles could have controlled better they seemed out of allignment for christ sakes! For those who suck at braking and such there is a brake assister thats nice. multi could have been better to via better music and the availability for maybe better everything like more players able to play. Replay: Theres lots here I guess but I doubt you'll ever replay the story mode as the story's not that great and it takes a bit of time to finish (not long maybe a full day I beat in a rental) and then you can re race in arcade and time attack which are just meh. As for the challenges those might keep you for a bit longer. multi is a joke with only two players and a bit boring not likely to keep you busy. Overall: 7 its not a bad game nor a good one.Rent.

 urlLink New Releases on GameSpot as I've said for a long while I'm way behind and have lots of games to play anyway so this weeks list of crap games is no big deal.. for me and even then I still would have liked some good ones. I here worms is ok for party's but not a worthy purchase really. That firefighter game just doesn't look like you'd want to own it when such games are super cheap on pc and or way more fun in an arcade.

 urlLink Anime News Network - Anime on Starz half this stuff I've seen on this vary channel

 urlLink Anime News Network - Anime News : "Viz's copyright page includes mentions of a few titles that Viz has not yet announced as licensed. These include Here is Greenwood, Yami no Matsuei,W-Juliet, Kare First Love and Kanata Kara. "

 Animenewsnetwork just broke this and it was earlier reported by trsi. Yay! If I can rent them I will even though I've seen them. I really want the new episodes that are expected most of all.

 urlLink Rumor Control: The Nintendo Nitro and Son of N-Gage - Xbox News at GameSpot the nintendo thing bogus but hey cool rumor name anyway. The M$ story hell this has been around before live came out modders were worried. All you need though is a switch to shot off your chip and likely your safe. I guess they'll kick you off live. Fuckers.

 Random Updatestrong> The recent gaming conference uncovered some news involving m$ trying to dominate the gaming market and btw its now in San Francisco starting next year. Techtv has been bought out by comcast as a result some new faces will show up and old will leave. What does this mean for anime unleashed? Not sure but maybe things will improve? ON anime I'm not sure. Now in the gaming area this could mean xplay will see some sort of added material and improvement alla urlLink g4tv. Also tripping the rift the new show on Sci fi channel is well as expected somewhat funny and perhaps worth your time its a cg comedy check it out and see if you like it. I myself have seen the first four eps and think I'll be dropping it. so-so not sure how long it lasts or will and its a mature audience show for sure. Yugo a new political anime about a negotiator based on the manga of the last ten years of the same name is now airing in japan and available subbed online its pretty dang good so give it a try! Good. Lasts 13 eps rated pg13 I'd say. Now back to UT2004 :)

 urlLink New Releases on GameSpot some good pc games this week. Everything else is rental or not even that. In fact nothing on this list has my interest except far cry. Just picked up a copy of unreal 2004 off to play! :)

 urlLink Happy birthday for GBA SP - News at GameSpot very cool. I wonder when if and what the next gb will be like? I do think I will try and get a psp when they come out maybe ps3 since I skipped ps2. Still need wario ware dammit! Think I'll pick it up next time I'm out.

 Tokyopop announced at Wizard World this weekend that they have acquired the rights to the second Boys Be manga series, Boys Be... 2nd: A Guys Guide to Girls. The original Boys Be manga remains unlicensed... for now at least. Tokyopop's Jake Forbes explains that they chose to license the second series because its subject matter is more contemporary, mature, and compelling. they also announced they would be doing an original star trek manga the latter I could careless. But boys be manga series one was pretty good and I loved the anime I'd like to see the anime released by viz and tokyopop should go ahead and release the first manga as well!

 I can't seem to get the link but look up this company: NEO FUKUOKA they make a working akira motor bike, the one kaneda drove in the film :)

 urlLink Portland man in 27-hour Asteroids marathon - Arcade Games News at GameSpot holy sh*t! WOW. Best I've done in an arcade was well I dunno I've played maybe up to three hours of games like capcom vs snk and street fighter/soul calibur. Geez. Otherwise old school games I'm best at dig dug which I maxed out at about 5 hours before I lost and its the best score at least at the arcade I used I should go back and do some gamin.

 urlLink New Sega-Sammy publishing deal - News at GameSpot

 urlLink Anime News Network - Press Release yes well that is alot of manga. None of which I care for.

 News! Xbox is now officially going to experience a 30$ price cut. All I know is right now the damn thing is worthless till I get halo 2 and doom 3 on it. Nintendo is going to be releasing another special edition gba sp soon. urlLink Gamespot has two great features up:game music, and snk. Speaking of snk they are indeed back I'm looking forward to buying the metal slug titles they release. I once owned a neo geo pocket. I would have bought a neo geo pocket color but they sold out at the one place I could have and I don't want one enough to pay $$$ now.

 Yes well tenchi is pretty popular right now because of urlLink Tenchi Muyo GXP in fact the international chanell has started showing tenchi stuff on their channel unedited! They also showed AH! MY goddess movie unedited as well. Yay! Speaking of Ah! My goddess rumors are about that more anime is to come :) Even ANN has been giving it some coverage. Don't know much about it though. Rising Stars of manga volume 1 review: Finally picked this up (you really should use your library!) and hey it was pretty good. I liked this urlLink guy's best. The first one which won the grand prize was also indeed good. All of them were decent and worth the time. I just found out the love hina best selection cd is out this month so I'll be picking that up and volume 2 of ai love you maybe some initial d. I got money and a little time not much though. So look for more reviews. Another quick bit of news anime-reviews.net has its gundam info site up and gundam has sold 1 million dvds in Japan whoa!

 It looks like Nokia isn't going to give up that easily. Today, they've announced the N-Gage QD, which is mostly just a redesign of the original N-Gage. It'll include an external slot to insert games, rather than the awkward internal one the first N-Gage had. Nokia will also create the N-Gage Arena, where gamers can play each other online with their N-Gages. The N-Gage QD will be released sometime in June and will retail for $199, or $99, depending on your phone service contract. Well thats better but uh I still don't plan on buying one or recomend one.

 Saikano is soon to be release by viz. IN fact viz released a preview disc I recieved as did urlLink anime-reviews.net and urlLink animenewsnetwork both have reviews available. I agree with their reviews. I saw half the show subbed and hope they get it all released in quality but also quickly! Now someone needs to pick up boys be! ALso recently watched sakura diaries which is a cheap buy! And a damn good show. 3.5 of 5 worth your time and the small fee of admission. Tokyo Godfathers is now in stores looks great I should be getting it soon check it out. Looks like a good family film also. Game wise not much going on in the world if you ask me I'm just chillin playin a little ut 2004 still.

 urlLink Animefringe: April 2004 - Specials - Life on the Fringe

 urlLink cheapassgamer.com is a pretty sweet site for freebies and cheap deals check it out. I enter give aways all the time, get free magazines all the time ( I have a free urlLink gamepro subscription going this year) and I am a regular for bargain bin, used games and trades at stores and pawnshops. Trust me a great site to check regularly. Speaking of buying I need some memory for my damn pc and some new games perhaps as well. Tokyo Godfathers was a great film the dvd is worth your time if you enjoy kon's work or a good film I'd even say this is a family film (ten on up) just be warned it lacks a dub (bad move!) and extras as well. 4 outta five just the same.

 Howl's moving castle video clip released Source: urlLink nausicaa.net The guys just posted about it though the clip was released back in January, but hey its ok I to missed it. Unless this is old which it may be and I just forgot but the post on nausicaa was dated April and I can't remember seeing this clip. It can be downloaded off nausicaa.net in wmp8 format and mpeg you may need software to unzip the files also. Book Recomendation: William Gibson's Idoru I finally picked it up and highly recomend it now that I am finished :) Also got some new games to speak of coming soon.

 Wow its been a bit. Been gaming as usaul but nothing new just unreal and some old stuff. E3 is coming up so you will see alot of stuff about that on this site and others. And of course the Nba playoffs are now in session! Not that you anime types or gamers care but I do so maybe some of you do, basketball is my sport. :) Anime wise I've started getting some new subs lately: gantz the new 11 ep show by Gonzo digimation is looking pretty good so far, and I am still watching the political show yugo which is alright I started and now I need to finish! And of course I am looking into rumours that a few years back a second future boy conan was made ? I found a similar ghibli title entitled 3000 leagues in search of mother though its 52 eps and even from just reading about it I doubt I will like as much as FBC. Some new Miyazaki films are on the way both of which I will/would like to see though neither sounds particularly great. Big miyazaki films for me to still see include: his new film howl's castle, and yes I have still not seen porco rosso or my neighbor totoro. Wolf's rain a show I absolutely loved watching on sub awhile back is coming to the USA on dvd at the end of June and is already on Adult swim. All they edited of the first ep was the entire opening song and most of the ending sure thats not to bad but I'm still pretty pissed. I may buy some of the series on dvd to get the new eps and I wouldn't mind some collectibles and such. Definetly watch this one. The dub was fine but nothing special.

 Azumanga Daioh anime dvd review: I've heard you will either love or hate this show. I myself came out loving this show! ITs funny not horribly so but funny, the animation is good and its definetly pretty cute. The music is well nothing special but I recomend giving this show a rental and see if you like it I myself will be finishing it, the manga is also available. A 4 of 5 rating seems good. Free! Get tribes 2 pc game for free in honor of the coming tribes vengeance game stop by gamespy to pick it up I think I will. Found another free online game some may enjoy its like urlLink nationstates but with and mostly dealing with war, pretty fun and free for now sign up and enjoy. I am the nation Rakuen. Speaking of nationstates I've managed to nearly abolish income tax I'm down to 12% and happen to be doing a good job in the freedoms area wheeee Finally bought mario sunshine a year or two late but I though hey its 30$ brand new and its the perfect time of year (spring/summer= sunshine) to play it. So now I have it to enjoy and beat. I recomend it highly by the way. Later. Damn its been awhile

 Still yet more on E3 and gaming! Not only is urlLink EB offering pre orders of nintendo's new portable the DS for about 200$ but they now are offering a new limited edition of Halo 2 that includes commentary and a making of feature along with art galeries and it comes in a tin box. This is a good one for all the die hard halo fans who have tshirts action figures and so on :) Sega is of course also working on and showing off the astroboy games for ps2 and gba, but rumor has it a huge announcement is to come! A new home console I doubt sighting sega's cut back in size and finances but a portable is possible, yes another portable! We shall see! Also it turns out they are working on the matrix online as well along with a pretty neat game for the eyetoy on ps2.

 More E3 YEs well a gundam seed game was shown (see gamespot among others) for gba and ps2 its gundam assualt so you remember the first assualt games on psone right? Fun little fighter for gundam fans. Did I mention tecmo had a sweet booth? they did. And there upcoming collectors/online edition of their popular series of DOA is gonna be sweet it includes the old game and number 3 I believe complete with online play and a collectible pack of cards it should hit this summer. Also for fighting fans SNK is showing off king of fighters game on ps2 and such, they are alive and well! Sega had a number of games including otogi 2 for the xbox there first big hit of its kind after some similar titles failing on the gamecube and xbox as well as ps2. They also showed off a sonic game for Nintendo's DS :) TV games: Yeah actually alot of em. Stargate Sg-1 is getting one on pc, as is ER and another law and order game. Er and Stargate might be fun stargate likely the best. Again I'd have to say Gamespot has the best coverage and so do the individual companies themselves, and of course me so keep up with all this coverage somehow at least.

 urlLink Dog's Life E3 2004 Hands-On - Dog's Life Previews for PlayStation 2 at GameSpot Strange and as far as I know a first.

 urlLink Donkey Kong - Game & Watch Emulator hmm.. interesting! :)

 E3 coverage begins ! First up yes the site is seeing some changes :) ANd now for my E3 coverage a good site for coverage: urlLink gamespot thanks to them I almost feel like I was really there, a big thanks. So xbox first then:well the big games being fps games like doom 3, halo 2, unreal championship 2, and of course the star wars republic sequel. I'm really excited about doom 3 on xbox and its exclusive co-op mode. Unreal championship 2 is going to be much better than the last and for the first time ever will actually include a real one player story mode which I am psyched about. Halo 2 of course is the biggie! At e3 they demoed a level titled "zanzibar" (sp?) and showed off the new features like dual weapons, new vehicle designs/destruction, and so on. NOt to mention its coming soon they say and multi is gonna be sweet!!!!!! Nintendo had some damn fine stuff. Mostly with the DS portable I am now officially stoked about! The thing looks a bit large I guess but so cool looking. The innovations with touchscreen/dual screen,wireless tech is pretty neat and the games look sweet, imagine playing n64 visual games with up to four friends wirelessly and all this and more on the go! The console is already being pre ordered out by a number of stores for about 200$ I hope its that or less I want one! Nintendo says they don't plan on killing the gba sp which seems true with all the games they still have lined up for gba, the DS is not supposed to do any connections to the GC. Sony's psp is looking sweet. The console has a beautiful design, some good games of course and I believe is also priced around 200$ for the first time in a long time I am really psyched about portable gaming and I'd love to own both of these fine consoles. Ngage is just looking well still poorly. They showed off some games most of which were blah. They should have done the new design and all these games at launch, and now with psp and Ds at e3 they're overshadowed there and forever more. :P Besides portables and FPs games I found myself interested in a few others like nintendos release to come of donkey kong bongo musical game I wasn't expecting to hit the USA along with a mario pinball. Halo 2 seems to be the big winner of E3 especially for M$, nintendo is getting attention for its DS console mostly with attnetion to its games of course as well and I have to say I am most pleased with nintendo who also has some good stuff for zelda fans to. One more quick thing a patch is now available for Unreal tournament 2004 which I am still enjoying very much so. I still need some more memory to more full enjoy, and I recently joined a clan I need to get active with. More sooon!

 urlLink Custom Robo Review for GameCube at GameSpot looking into picking this one up as a rental soon if I can I'll let ya know what I think. NOte: originally released in japan on nintendo's n64dd an n64 add on

 E3 final wrap up: The phantom it seems there is one new homeconsole coming, its the long waited,rumored,rumors galore mongering phantom. At e3 the console was demoed, it plays pc games among others (no games announced yet) it looks pretty cool and has some nice powerful specs (I'd rather play on it than my pc) also its going to be out by xmas around november 18th and get this will cost 200$ to buy or is free with a 2 year service contract, the service is 30$ a month. Now if I can play pc games on this, on my tv and the hardware is impressive and I can get other games to (rentals!Trials! etc.) I may actually pick this thing up but its the 30$ a month fee along side paying for the games that bugs me it sounds a bit expensive I'd like severe cuts and some good games before I commit. $$$$

 Bill turns parents into prosecuters against comics,dealers etc. http://www.cbldf.org/pr/archives/000181.shtml Read the above link. Not good I mean at least they capped it and they aren't really banning the stuff but still I'd prefer this not pass.

 All anime movie theatre now open!Only one of its kind in the world and first of its kind, now open in japan! http://orient-com.jp/

 Manga reviews SGT Frog- A fun little manga coming in at 8 volumes written and created by Mine Yoshiaki its a fun read for all ages, cute to. Its not horribly fantastic at least not the first two volumes and I noticed as always tokyopop had some stupid errors but hey. 3 of 5 points consider it at least read it. Negima- this is the new one, the latest of akamatsu-san's work though he is already working on another in japan. Its about a ten year old prodigy/magician its pretty damn funny and I think many if not most fans of love hina will enjoy it give it a shot. 4 of 5 points. This one is published by del rey it includes a Japanese preview of the next volume (number 2) and of course was in my opinion well done and includes translations notes. Del rey has done a good job I feel with what I've seen so far but I'm a bit upset they are releasing so few titles (4 as of now) and taking so long to release new volumes also they cost a bit more than tokyopop mangas but meh perhaps as time passes the price will decrease a dollar or so and they will kick up production? lets hope so.

 I was hanging out at the local hastings for the release of Lord of the rings 3 on dvd around 50 people showed up it was great started a little before midnight and lasted till 1 am or nearly two I believe. The dvd is great btw. Anyway urlLink tokyopop has an official store open now where they sell there stuff check it out. Also I picked up some new manga: Negima by ken akamatsu new from urlLink Del rey manga I'll let ya know what I think of their work and the manga itself. I also picked up Sgt frog from tokyopop which looks pretty good I'll be back soon! :)

 Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban review The movie was great it had some fantastic special effects and followed the book well. Emma Thompson's character professor treelawney was pretty bizzare but not in a bad way and the new Albus Dumbledore went with her well but I prefer the original actor I have to say. Overall it was a good film worth seeing as always the books are better but the movies including this one are great. :) 4 out of 5 stars

 Rave on tv tonight The anime based off the manga also being released by urlLink tokyopop its on cartoon network tonight at 8:30 So check it out and look for edits or edit lists online and stuff I myself am not interested in this one.

 AH well yes harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban hits theatres tomorrow its gonna be huge and of course I'm looking into seeing it, possibly tomorrow! Also beware a virus is spreading I hear that claims to be a harry potter game so be on the look out! Also the harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban game is now available on all the current consoles I haven't tried it but I'm sure its as good as the last which means many will enjoy it (I myself don't like them) and if your into quidditch the game is selling for a bargain 20$ on all consoles. Linkin park released their new video this one is for "breaking the habit" its animated by production team ig who recently worked on kill bill. Stream it urlLink here or find it for download.Its pretty sweet stuff. Update - Gonzo digimation also played a part in it. Microsoft announced that true fantasy live online is now cancelled the us branch says its due to the complexity and cost and yadda yadda while Japan says its due to not being able to offer quality in the title. Who cares play PSO (phantasy star online) instead! later.

 urlLink Family Guy Volume 1 sweet I'll buy these (hope they come out regularly and not every two or three months heck its along time till they start to come) and whoo! New episodes in 2005

 urlLink Fortune Small Business - Small Business - Small & Global: License for Adventure 80-90% of my manga is from Tp and I also happen to read alot of imports to online of course. God I love manga I read at least some every week now a days practically. :)



 Ten year anniversary! Not a good one though really. Today is the day laws and such were passed to regulate video games and give out ratings like movies get. ITs not working to well and its just causing harm to the industry and if I'm not mistaken wasting time of government and government resources etc. Yes thank you joe lieberman! :( bastard! A recent study released says games aren't being rated well enough that many T rated games should be M and few games have been rated AO though some should have been. Fine and I would agree and could list some titles to. But the point is none of this is even needed and all its doing is hurting the industry and thus gamers and its uneeded! Dammit! Speaking of gaming I haven't done shit in the way of gaming for awhile now which.. doesn't bug me much actually I now play less than an hour a week for the last few weeks now and for the last few months its been like a few hours a week, thats healthy but whoa! hehe

 Hey! I'm back its been awhile eh? Had a birthday celebration for my younger brother I got him the trigun mangas which it turns out Darkhorse comics will be releasing a new animanga (like tokyopop's cinemangas) in the future. We had a blast with a really tasty lotr cake and of course a week before his birthday we saw the new harry potter film which we both loved as did those who also attended. Also in other news anime expo is coming up and summer is in swing to we anime types are having a blast with no school and plenty of time! I just started watching a new show since Gantz was liscensed the new show is samurai 7 based of akira kurosawa's seven samurai its one of the first or few high def tv shows which cost about twice that of a regular anime to make, its a sweet show so far and I've seen a few eps. Also just picked up volume 2 of azumanga daioh the anime which like the first is well worth your time! And manga wise I've been reading ai love you which I just finished the latest third volume which hey was pretty good! Looking forward to more manga as soon as I can afford it but right now thats not the case. Maybe some more anime rentals soon would be good to dunno look for more soon now I'll stop rambling about various things :)

 "First" christian game developer http://www.gamespot.com/news/2004/06/25/news_6101443.html The report is wrong I've played several christian games by for instance urlLink N-lightening software However these guys will be the biggest and the first one to succeed. YOu know whats sad? I played all the games listed (oregon trail,carmen and such) and I used to listen to odysey on radio.

 Rumors and comments on them and more! Just adding some patches to UT2004 I missed both of the patches and new game material to its been a month or more since I last played! But I'm back on! Still need some new games, perhaps for my birthday coming up this summer :) Rumors have been around alot lately. Here they are. bungie is developing a halo for gameboy or a portable console, like say ngage, gameboy, psp or others. This rumor is false though it could have been neat. How is it false? Bungie said so on urlLink their site and so did urlLink gamespot ! Nintendo DS games will cost 50$ a piece! Well nintendo has not confirmed it but urlLink Eb has them listed at that price and they have psp games listed their as well! Kinda sucks :( but they will be more expensive to develop and of a higher quality than previous games I'm sure I mean they look like playstation/n64/gamecube quality in visuals. Of the two consoles I have to say game wise I like the DS best but am leaning in favor of the psp well we shall have to wait and see which is the best choice :) And here is something funny! gay marriage is indeed to be included in fable soon to hit the xbox someday haha! :) Controversy!

 Princess Ai http://www2.fanscape.com/tokyopop/player.asp Looks like it could be the hit of the year in terms of manga, its a new series from urlLink tokyopop with Courtney love and Dj milky behind it, its an original american manga coming out July 6th I will have a review up soon on this site once I get it and of course check the above link out for more!

 Love Love From what I've seen of this short series (8 episodes) based on a dating sim game I believe, I am not impressed and will not be backing this one up. Don't waste your time. Its animation is nothing new that isn't a bad thing but its getting old the lack of creativity and innovation in visuals this shows. Also its not all that funny the jokes are old and get old after awhile and the fanservice is a bit over the top really its just a lame show that I can't give more than a 2 out of 5 rating. Skip it. Oh story you say I said nothing of characters and story? ITs about a guy wanting to be an actor who gets stuck making a documentary about girls making a cosplay movie. Bleh.

 urlLink Tokyopop Has a new store of course and its full of goodies! But also they just opened a street team called manga force or something like that I just joined and they also launched a new flash player to enjoy as well! Also a new survey up about buying manga let them know and you could win something. I actually won once awhile back. I buy most of mine at hastings entertainment superstores but some at barnes and noble. I have yet to order online at all any manga. I've picked up a few titles through my library which is nice. :)

 Wario ware inc is indeed the best game of the last year man. I've been playing the hell out of it since I bought it for summer which means I'm a bit behind but hey! Its great to just pick up and play real quick but is also addicting. And definetly strange, but this is a good thing. A must own and must play, great for travelling of course. 5 out of 5 points awarded. That fun little political online game urlLink nationstates has been redesigned (the sites look) and should speed up and such to they say and so on yay! I still have and use most of all my first nation which is Josh Dollins named after myself its now the size of china hehe.

 Animated Shorts! I love em no joke. ANd now some commentary on the subject. Computer animation is likely my fave for shorts dunno why but with flash in second and its close. Most probably prefer flash most people I know do. Anyway stop by urlLink atomfilms and check out Ego and Grey 50% they were great. Also see urlLink animusic.com thats a great cg show you can watch some of it online at atomfilms and elsewhere or buy the great dvd.Another great musical cg animation is drum machine. I can't find it but The clayman you know he worked on the recent Xiagra had a great HP lovecraft short out I wish I could find. Best flash: Ninjai the littlest ninja, could hit big screen or dvd someday and could eventually be finished to! heh And uh now for the crap: Avoid born sinners not just because I am a christian it got me to chuckle a bit but its just not that good. Same goes for Arj and poopie and Doodieman thats some lame shit (pun intended) Alright I need to quit watching this shit and go to bed but first up I should have some new anime reviews soon including my thoughts on the first eps of samurai 7 and a new romance/comedy based off a dating sim called "love love" so wait up! Other than that I have a trip to head off to so later peace out

 Japan a radio, Happy birthday! Today urlLink Japan a radio celebrates its third birthday! :)

 Princess Ai is out on shelves now pick up a copy if you can, I'll review it once I get one whenever that may be. Check it out as I said its in stores!!!

 Randomosity?! Well I just bought myself a used copy of lost in translation, its a great film well worth watching over and over again and owning much like last samurai which I bought awhile back. I almost bought the 40$ wolf's rain vol. 1 boxset but didn't, maybe later. Also picked up 20$ Soul calibur 2 for gc yay! And halo for pc so I got some gaming to do this summer still. Reading 1984 by george orwell its a classic and so far a pretty good one. Other than that some news is floating about that nintendo's DS will come in the second week of november for 180$ and games at some 30+ dollars as much as 40$ possibly! I don't even buy that many at the current price so heh. Ok later

 Random News &nbsp; urlLink Boxtorrents.com just got busted and severely damaged by the bust for distributing licensed anime, ADV busted them. Heh. &nbsp; Bandai has been cracking down on bootleggers who produce bootleg dvds of their works at conventions like the recently passed anime expo. &nbsp; Gantz season 2 will be starting at the end of august. I wish I could have finished the first one before it was licensed! &nbsp; Game wise I dunno and haven't played much either. I'm thinking of getting halo pc for my birthday with some of my gift money. &nbsp; &nbsp;

 My birthday is coming up in oh about 5 days :) can't wait I have some travelling and of course new goodies to. Love your library and use it, I just picked up the new lupin secret of mamo dvd ( I recommend it to lupin fans of course) Rating it a 3.5 or so out of 5 I enjoyed it. Also lots of manga at your library. Well other than that I just won an award giving me free goodies for reading to :) Well later :)

 My birthday has come and gone. It was great. I recieved a copy of players choice edition of soul calibur 2 but now need a new controller to play multi as my old one has been broken. I recieved money fortunately so I can afford this. And maybe I've been thinking of trying out battlefield vietnam though I have my reservations or issues with it. We'll see. I also finally got halo for pc which is great and btw a new trailer is out give it a watch man I can't wait for halo 2 I just hope I can finally get xbox live to play it with. Other than that Not much in the area of anime been thinking about watching kino's journey a new series out on dvd and learned of to my brothers pleasure a new blue gender series.

 Book Review: Wow George Orwell's 1984 book was great! Very good! I just picked up the film which from the first half I'd say is pretty good and would say watch it when you finish the book. Also just read a great christian/teen ww2 novel by Dean Hughes called Soldier boys , I thought it was pretty good. I should get around to reading xxxholic here soon and comments will follow when I do. Also soon will review the lupin mangas. Also next anime to begin along side azumanga is kino's journey. Azumanga Daioh manga The azumanga daioh manga was good but I'd say its really really close to the anime I noticed very few differences between the first manga and the first few anime episodes but maybe the manga lasts longer than the 26 ep anime or something but right now I'd say both are equally good and very very similar. Good rating not excellent but good just like the anime, 4 out of 5 rating.

 PC game reviews! Ice Breaker by urlLink Reflexive Is out now it seems a bit like ice climbers by nintendo reminds me of that game anyway. This is a puzzle title, it has a story mode but heh lame simple as that. And a prize mode where you gain items. The game is fine and some may like it but as for me I didn't much care for it. Timing seemed off to I would have released this in winter not late summer. SO-SO rating not bad but not good or excellent. 2 out of 4 score. Don't buy this one try it at most. Magic Ball also by urlLink Reflexive This one doesn't have great visuals I like them and then I don't it sort of has a blurry retro look to it which works but heh. The mouse setup was a bit to fast but that can be adjusted and the game was fun to play if you like the richochet extreme titles though I prefer them this one adds some cool 3d effects and design to it. Good but not excellent which By the way I'd say the ricochet extreme games are excellent. So consider buying this one if you like the ricochet games, its at least worth playing but not necessarily buying.

 Irony The nightmare before christmas game will be released after christmas! haha now thats ironic

 Out from under: To resist is to piss in the wind. Anyone who does will end up smelling. Knowing this why do I defy? Cause my inner voice is yelling. There is a fist pressing against anyone who thinks something compelling. Our intuit were taught to deny, and our soul were told is for selling. Get out from under them resist and multiply!Get out from precipice and see the sky! Get out from under them Resist, unlearn,defy! Get out from under precipice and see the sky! Not long in words but longer in tune. Under my umbrella: WHen I close my eyes ... I can see for miles. Theres comfort in my darkseat... and chaos in the aisles. These eyes are not your eyes and these eyes are not the color that your arrid eyes might be. No, I was not around when those eyes of yours decided so I refuse to kneel before the sights you choose to see. When I close my eyes... I remember how to smile. Under my umbrella... I'm an accomplished exile. THese eyes are not your eyes and these eyes are not the color that your arrid eyes might be. No, I was not around when those eyes of yours decided so I refuse to kneel before the sights you choose to see! If this is right, I'd rather be wrong. If this is sight, I'd rather be blind.

The question has been raised to do to kevin mitnik (legend hacker,writer of art of deception) who has a defense co of his own he argues that a hacker would be beneficial to defense (this is true,who better to stop a hacker than a hacker?) oh and a reformed hacker. anyway i say you'll never know till you hire and he may actually be worth it!?

 Knowledge is the most powerful force. The mind is the ultimate weapon.

 Okay this is funny but a little rude, well just not neccesary. I have made my mind up I will buy neither ben & jerry's nor star spangleds ice cream! Star spangled ice cream is in the following flavors:iraqi road, i hate the french vanilla,and nutty environmentalist. See starspangledicecream.com for info and orders. Don't order and stop eating ben an jerry's.

 An angry man defeats himself. (zen) yet another saying for you today.

 More songs and there lyrics from my band Incubus! Nice to know you : Better than watching beller bending silver spoons. Better than witnessing new born nebulaes in bloom. She who sees from 'up-high' smiles and surely sings perspective pries your once weighty eyes and it gives you wings. I haven't felt the way I feel today in so long its hard for me to specify I'm begining to notice how much this feels like a waking limb.. pins and needles, nice to know you, goodbye! Deeper than the deepest cousteau would ever go and higher than the heights of what we often think we know. Blessed she who clearly sees the wood for the trees To obtain a birds eye is to turn a blizzard to a breeze. I haven't felt the way I feel today in so long its hard for me to specify I'm begining to notice how much this feels like a waking limb..pins and needles, nice to know you... goodbye! So could it be that it has been there all along?

 A man who seeks revenge should start by digging to graves. (todays zen)

 A day without work is a day without food. (zen) Have a good day everyone!

 Want a good movie to watch? See the Emperor's club great movie!

 HMm. tax cuts good. President landing on navy ship fine. And 70% of people not able to name one democrat running for office shows:Democrats many are insane most people are imbeciles and could give a damn and yea. I personally go along with reps on most things but heres what I am pondering how could you not name any canindates? HEre are the ones that jump to my mind right away:Al Sharpton,KErry,Bob Graham,and lieberman. See easy course there is five more...

 Anyone see the new $20 bill design due out later this yr.? I have and I gotta tell ya looks ok see news sites if you haven't.

 Okay I was thinking S.A.R.S. well along with what it really means it could also be:stupid american reaction syndrome. Now please don't jump me! I don't think americans (I'm one) are stupid! I just think that is another way it could be done. And I do think precautions have and should be taken. urlLink

 man so many words! bUt how many? Well the answer is one:honesty

 Note: sorry if some of you do not get my email when you click on contact. And sorry for some of you having issues with my archives.

 Okay time to open my pie hole on well stuff! First Bill Bennet and gambling:Hey so hes a hypocrite is this new to the type that do his job? No. IS gambling wrong? No, in excess yes, so in his case yes. He should not have gambled or at least not to the degree that he did. He has apologized and said that as long as he is doing the job he does he will not gamble. Alright now for time magazine and sars:why did they put a caucasions on there instead of asians, sars is an asian illness! I gurantee you that asians would (most ) not be offended and this is just to much political correctness.And also I give my prayers to those who lost loved ones or possesions in the recent tornado disasters. Note: send emails to joshdollins@cableone.net

 Happy mothers day! (see google!?) Note: You better have gotten your mom something! Flowers,bbq and cake for my mom. AHH....

 Hey looking for a good and yet weird movie? I recomend adaptation but watch being john malkovich first. 4 outa 5. :)

 I seem to be the only one who noticed hidden goodies like religious stuff in the matrix but this guy has to:matrixessays.blogspot.com urlLink

 Follow the white rabbit... which pill? How the hell does the matrix have anything to do with some maniacs with guns going on a rampage? IT doesn't and according to polls most agree. Also I was finally forced to watch the matrix and I think it was ok I say 4 outa five. Gonna go see #2 next week!

 Something I recomend gardening and olden tyme toons:creedence clearwater revival is awesome oh and hendrix to maybe some joplin, just me though. Also I learned a local fair (idaho) will have George Thorogood who is now 52 but still sounds good to me. I have been to a ccr concert at the fair and would like to go to this one. :) Note: Yes I like gardening, remember the whole zen thing? :)

 A rather good lain comic is up at ttv.com

 First off Golf sucks, in my opinion. Just a bunch of bored rude rich guys who think they are great, oh and they dress.. ugh! Anyway why wouldn't you want some women out there with you? Its like wrestling, wrather wrestle a girl then a guy. :) I think these guys just can't stand that they got beat! So why don't they not get beat. Its there prob.

 Fuse tv looks to me like it sucks and is anti a lot of stuff! :( but at least they are taking on mtv and all I guess thats cool. Till a good station shows up though I just won't watch. :(

 I would like to say I am sad to say goobye to General Tommy Franks and Ari Fleicher I thank them for there work and wish them luck also. :) Hmmm mtv+microsoft=monopoly but there are and have been alternatives to microsoft and now there is to mtv look for fuse tv! Sounds interesting... :)

 THanks for email! Still no archives although some stuff I wish to and might. Oh and may I say support miguel Estrada? THe guy did nothing wrong. Certain people don't want him in cause he has morals and all, its lame. note:i got a nice reply from my local senator. And also recently heard something about game restrictions of you know ages. WHich I belive is good. Although I will say I am still going to play games with those ratings that I can. :)

 Yes this is a new look. And if you wish to email me click on JD next to time of post. I do not have archives yet but when and if available just click on time of post. :)

 The matrix made 93 million dollars! WHat! Lame! The animatrix is better! Can not wait to buy that also the game may be cool. 93 million!

 Hmm.. execution by firing squad? NO. By lethal injection yes. Well there. Sadly in this case I am a minority. :( Also I love music which is why I decided to let you know what I plan on listening to for now:white stripes,311,and linkin park. In fact I recently saw something about linkin park saying why are they so popular even though they don't hang with popular crowd etc. oh and the genre they are in is "dead" well cause they made fans when it was still popular and they rock. And some of us still enjoy the music and popularity especially in music is just lame.

 Time to shoot off my mouth!Why can't the girl sing here "religious song" at school? Cause schools are biased. What should be done is this: freedom for all students to believe and say what they wish. She can be "religious" and the others not, have both perspectives. No they want only one or none many cases none. To bad. Think I heard she can anyway, and I hope she does. Bias is evil it is an evil word there should be no bias.Oh and how about all the brilliant pop stars saying come to canada. WEll I am not. And I wouldn't trust them and don't you either. This is one screwed up situation. Also note:I am a vegetarian, and you should be to (mad cow if not that you are!).

 google (.com) has a store! See site or try the actual site googlestore.com

 Google is having some sort of puzzle challenge check it out! :)

 Hate acne? Duh. Well check out candelalaser.com and or techtv.com sounds good and will get better! A cure!

 sorry about not posting yesterday. Hope you had a great memorial day. :) And I would like to thank all those on duty serving the U.S.A. And for those who have. I certainly thanks those who lost their lives doing so and pray for their families.

 Wanna talk about your fears of sars? Go to meetup.com and look for the sars section. If you were afraid of sars though why would you want to be around people? Oh and yippee! Hilary clinton's books out I really care. Other than that nothing later..

 Looking for a good film? Check out about schmidt. Oh and like the matrix and interested in anime check out the animatrix.

 WHy all this about wmd? WHy can people not think going in to improve peoples lives/save their lives good enough? No it had to threaten us. Lame. And so what if intellegince mad a mistake? Happens. Or hey what about this maybe the weapons have been smuggled into another country. Oh and n.korea for a price? Forget you! You are all like a bunch of children! I say don't give em a damn thing! Same as iraq by force if needed, no price.

 Bob marley rules you want good tunes for summer check it out. Also if you havent tried mt dew's new orange flavor you should its great. Available all summer, thats how often I will drink. :) Now I just have to try the new sprite and those disposable digi cams. :) Summer has begun!

 Ok time to sound off: A movie about or with hilary clinton? I think it will be on abc or something, oh joy! Also on tv you gotta watch monster house on discovery! Cool! Oh and the upcoming "walking with caveman" may be cool and interesting but it is not right. Impeach bush? WHy? Thats lame no way! (that segway incident in which he fell off was funny!)

 Hans blix is an imbecile, I mean why would you say what you felt that way? Well I might so fine. Anyway he is wrong though,he is not a world leader or a very good inspector. THe U.N. is a joke every day we are given proof that it doesn't and won't work. If anything it will be the end of us all.Oh and whats wrong with having the 10 commandments in the classroom? Nothing, but some think so. They are from any standpoint a good thing to follow, if it must be done why not take out the religous part and make it a moral part instead? Well we shall see....

 Hey been awhile hasn't it? So the french open was today, those people or at least those at the french open suck! THey were so screwed they made serena cry! She shouldn't have cried and she should have beat them good! But thats ok. Man those people are rude, not so sure they are "friends" I mean I wouldn't consider them that. Like a bad friend I say loose em, I've had enough! Currently listening to:boA (korean) new cd atlantis princess. Later see:jpopnation.com for a taste.

 Got the new potter book! Man it was insane at the place I got it last night face painting,card playing,cosplaying maniacs! To much for me. Book is good I am about 1/8 through it, :) Anyway if you can get one! let you know how I like it when I am actually finished.

 Okay Gray Davis is getting "recalled" this is a good thing, he is alot like a defective toy after all. :) 40 billion dollars (or more I believe) in debt he has put california, lame. Also I will comment on the music download thing, thats so messed up! I mean for the most part its just radio stuff. The music industry needs more pay alternatives and some lower prices on cd's and singles! Although I don't think its all that right and don't/won't do it the Gov. shouldn't "blow up" our pcs. Also I would like to say I give my condolences to the family of the boy who was drowned by an alligator in Florida. :( Later.

 Hey news time! Music:air guitar nationals in L.A.! WTF!? How do you decide who wins? Most passionate? Oh and btw linkin parks lead singer Chester is fine but needs 2 or so weeks rest,good news. Linkin park rulz! Ok and why do "schools" hate home school so much? Cause they don't get the money they want, they wouldn't need as much if it wasn't being wasted. Home school is not that bad a thing. Hmm and this Government vs the people thing on food? It isn't going to stop people they will still do it, maybe less. And so what if the government is trying to help out, its not a bad thing. Oh and the bbc and eu (euro union) can kiss my A$$! Thee bbc is biased and full of hate! And the Eu is evil and will be part of the end of us all! Oh and next we need to deal with iran. Screw those lazy slobs. (not all are just the majority.) And I guess thats all, now I feel better. :)

 Hmm just read some local news about a man I admire:Larry craig a senator here in Idaho. They say hes wrong cause he wants those 4 crafts he requested and was promised etc, well I will side with him. Also read a local article on young people not going to church cause "its boring" and "I don't need to" well I agree, I can do all I would at church at home so there. Except socialize. You can pray and worship anywhere! Church isn't a bad thing though, not at all. They just need some more modern music and live bands etc. More activities and my big issue is I have yet to find a church I can completely agree with or at least close untill then I will not attend. Oh and also in local news a game development group according to this source:idahostatesman.com has or is making a game called on the road to heaven or something. YOu go through levels to get to heaven, Ok I see something wrong with that. I even saw a pic of stairs hmm.....

 Hey happy fathers day if you are one (a father)! Blogger has a gear store like google now, and google(.com) has another theme thing up. urlLink

 Yay I finished harry potter #5 very good! I say much like the last (#4) a 5 outa 5. 1 &2 btw are 4 outta 5 and three I didn't like much a 3 outta 5 for it. Read! Oh and if ever in Idaho give mCcall a try, syringa (state flower) is beautiful and usaul activities can be enjoyed on lakes and such. :) Good day! Or night.

 Hey I am now on blogsearchengine.com! Also check this out, I took a test at pcworld.com on internet security and got an 82% and could win 500$ Just thought I'd rub it in, and encourage you to be safer. Anyway also hate telemarketers? Course you do. Well head over to donotcall.gov and sign up for 5 yrs of improvement this is indeed by the government and is free. If you register it is to go into affect on october 1 the site allows for complaint filings as well as registration and is available in espanol. :) Oh and I know ppl read quite a bit so do I, but we all could read a bit more!

 Ok want a good film to watch? Definetly check out punch drunk love, great film. ANyway just thought I would recommend it. Also is the nation reading more? Or gonna start to read more? Seems that way what with:oprahs book club back for the women (ick) and hilarys book for politcal types and harry for kids (and some adults to) now lets just hope there are more books coming cause I doubt ppl will go after old stuff. I for one plan on trying to read a bit more, I used to read tons during summer so maybe I will start again. You to! :)

 Guess what! Blogger has a new improved version! I like very much so, but still can not link properly. :( Anyway check out this blog kstepanian.com I like. Oh and want a search engine for blogs? Well try blogsearchengine.com I am on there I believe. :) Anyway later!

 Just saw something so cool I had to share while checking news of japan. Kirin brewing co. (japanese beer co.) has released a pretty well done and successful self cooling beer keg (can) now for soda! very cool.

 Wann read another blog? A political one? Sure. Check this out:gwbush2004.blogspot.com not bad at all. Check it out. better than mine sadly but hey, :) Other than that not much. Peace.

 mexican food yummy! But afterward you suffer dearly! Anyway why is it ok for "white ppl" to be discrimanated against? ITs not. SO why did the michigan thing happen? Cause the world is full of sh*t! Oh and adam sandler is married, in the words of adam himself "woopity doo!" later.

 News seems little, weather,sports and potter which is fine. Anyway remember the segway? They are still around just being banned all over the place. Recently in my town they decided to ban them from parks but not the streets I applaud this decision but still wonder why other cities have banned it completely? Anyway this is interesting also mcdonalds now uses tofu in there burgers! No not here in the states but in Japan and also the most popular/best way to meet a girl/boy friend? According to Japanese poll:internet. Thats it.

 I am saddened to hear of the death and injury of our soldiers recently and for all those killed or injured in moscow. :( On a lighter note hope you had a good fourth otherwise! And I have been thinking and have made of a list of men I admire etc and don't. Do :George Washington, Ben Franklin, Former President Reagan, and current president George W. Bush. Don't : Thomas Jefferson, sure he did great things but the whole slave thing and the fact he was an atheist bugs me. Bill Clinton he messed things up and dishonored us all in the oval office. Hilary Clinton another dishonest messed up politician. Lesbian at that! Oh and lee greenwood is a good man to: God bless America!

 Hey happy 227th 4th of July! Notes: Apparently George Washington sold and made whiskey, so? Also that Japanese guy one the hot dog contest, oh and why is the hot dog such a big deal? I would rather have some pizza or a grilled burger, a nice stir fy maybe, but oh well. Oh and its not to american Japanese like hot dogs and baseball! Anyway have a good one, oh and if you like urlLink fireworks and also visit urlLink anncoulter.org for her weekly columns a must!

 Ok its about the fourth so have a good one and be safe and alert! Also note: treason by ann coulter is a great book I give it the go ahead get it at urlLink barnes & Noble

 Guns for teachers? They shouldn't need them, how about another way? Geez. School is screwed up bad man, bad. Then there seems to be lots of old legends dying of one whom I will miss greatly is herbie mann great musician. Also all this mars talk, I remember something in the bible about man trying to nest in the stars and being cast out, maybe we should consider that? We won't, is it just me or is nasa a bunch of really smart ppl that are dumb? Aren't we all? (them in particular though.)

 Hmm.. mcgriddles are yummy! Anyway schools want teachers to be able to discipline kids, this isn't a bad thing just no physical leave that to the parents. Schools also want to get rid of snack and soda vendors in halls this I support but keep them in the teachers lounges for adults and responsible ppl. Also I will have a review of Ann Coulter's book treason up soon its currently selling like crazy so not easy to get. :(

 Okay I wanna rant more. I hate home depot and forever will but I commend them for putting electric/pc express lanes for those who wanna check themselves out in a hurry and pay in any way its nice, now if grocery stores would do that! Oh and all this talk about Kennedy and his marital issues I don't care I think thats rude and will not read the book! And one more thing I am angry with this tax thing there are potholes all over the streets in my town, wheres the money go? Hmm.. Oh well night.

 Mike savage journalist/entertainer (the entertainer is my opinion) whom has wrote a book ( I have yet to read) and has a radio show which was airing on urlLink msnbc he was recently fired over being impolite to a caller on air. Well msnbc should have known not to hire him he was and is like that on his show and in his book. Personally I don't like him much and I do think he is rude and all so there. Am i glad he was fired? Well I really just don't care, so there. The book I believe is savage nation and I am pretty sure his show is on the same radio station as urlLink hannity and urlLink bill oreilly

 Hmm.. treason by urlLink ann coulter is still selling very well. Very good book give it a read. Recently I heard of bush and blair being nominated for nobel piece prizes, why is this a bad thing? Its not but some think so. I think one of them deserves it particularly bush. For some reason great men who deserve this award never get it like Reagan he was a great man he didn't get one. Yet cracpot jimmi carter recently got that and before him Koffi Annan leader of the worthless U.N. I doubt Bush or Blair will win but they should one of them or both. Then there is all this talk of the recent shooting which is disturbing, like all shootings it could have been stopped had the father done a better job although you gotta cut him slack his wifes dead and he is single. The ring leader of the group had to deal without a mom and being picked on he still should not have done this and should face punishment, punishment of an adult he also needs counseling. As for the two helpers they should not be tried as adults and should recieve counseling. You think people could learn to get along and be kind but no even when it means possible death.

 hmm.. music? Well I have been listening to urlLink coldplay's latest cd and the sdtk to an anime (japanese animated series) called wolf's rain. The wolf's rain sdtk may be hard to find and could be expensive but it is really awesome! Metalica's st.anger cd is pretty good actually, talk about anger! I like just fine. Anyway as for all this africa stuff I feel we should go help. Save lives and free a people just like in Iraq we can't say to the africans well sorry we only help like Iraq. However I have an issue actually a few. The reason there is aids is there fault there have been attempts to slow/improve the aids situation and I pray it get better. Anyway I have an issue with the U.N. they admit there are human rights violations and such but yet they still aren't there helping! Koffi Annan the president of the U.N. is African himself, the U.N. is worthless. see urlLink foxnews for info/details.

 Ok I heard this question recently: "Does or why does the united states have to or tries to etc play peace keeper/ruler etc of the world? Well if we didn't help many countrys (africa,korea, and down in south america and such) would not have health care and food. They do cause we share our wealth. The reason nations like Japan prosper is because of our friendship and businness. We can all get along, but think if the u.s.a was gone everyone would be fighting to be leader of the world except whoever if anyone won would abuse it. History repeats itself. IT is all human nature, it is our nature, it is we whom will bring and are bringing about the end even the USA.

 Happy Birthday (57) Bush! Note:today is the day a group of hackers were to mess with thousands hundreds of thousands of sites, there was a site for this event which was to take place for around 6 hrs. The government has been warning for a few days now and recently shut down the hacker (s) site. Stay safe. And have a good one!

 hey just heard that senator larry craig (of My state Idaho) invited Blair after his speach in which he mentioned Idaho just wanted to say I extend the invitation and encourage him to visit, hope when he does I can meet him or something. Also as for the recent elderly crash incident I am saddened and send my condolences. :( it is my opinion no one over 70 should drive unless they take the same test other ppl take no exceptions. I prefer anyone over 70 find another way to get around, they truly are a danger. And as for this Kobe stuff I don't wanna believe he did it I think it was conesentual and all but am not sure so.. there.

 Recently there has been much talk in my current home about a festival which took place in june that lost around 160,000 $$$ the question is why? ANd how it can be fixed. IT should take place next yr and many more it has taken place for many years already. The reason they lost money is it sucked they didn't have enough new stuff and they didn't appeal to the young ppl (20s etc) who buy drinks etc at concession stands where the fest makes money. They had the young dubliners again sorta this yr that was good and blues traveler last yr. My point: bring in more young ppl friendly entertainment and make sales you do that and it can take place and families can still enjoy also.

 Hey been awhile anyway just wanna say you gotta check out urlLink blur's new cd its awesome and yes the lead singer is 2-d from the urlLink gorillaz you can listen to blurs cd for free at real.com you need real player and its in the listening cd lounge. Oh and urlLink 311 has a new cd out the 22nd three days after my bday, its called evolver you gotta pick it up! Later.

 queer eyes for the straight guy? ITs a new nbc show what it is with those guys and homosexuality I don't know. Anyway my hometown network didn't air it everywhere else did and many loved it. Good for them but most ppl here where I live don't and it was the local networks decision so to bad. Polls show most of us here in idaho think it should have been shown I don't care fine show it if you like but I suggest a later time slot last thing you need is your youngest son getting confused and asking questions. And guys can dress nice and all that and not be gay and they also don't have to hang with gay ppl I wouldn't but I aint mean either the show can be shown and maybe my local network will and I will be fine with it just after 9 pm.

 I am saddened to hear of more deaths of soldiers and also of 2 firemen in my local area please join me in prayer for familys etc. I am no longer skeptical or anything of uday and qusays deaths they are dead! As for all this they shoulda been brought in alive we tried they wouldn't so we killed em woulda been nice to though. And as for more recent talks of international troops to revive and help our troops sounds great but the greedy weasels known as french aren't invited!

 I am truly glad jessica lynch is home and wish here much luck and I do feel she deserves and congratulate here on her purple heart she has been awarded. :) Also I found out a republican religious conservative has said the bible (conveniently) told him to raise taxes (or God) the funny thing is about the story is democrats normally can't stand religion but when it benefits government it can be overlooked. ugh.

 Well according to centcom and the news uday and qusay hussein saddam's sons have been killed in a gunfight. I and many (iraqis mostly) want proof if so this is a great thing a step forward! We still gotta get osama and saddam but hey this is good. Centcom says proof will come tommorrow it sounds they are very sure. Another good thing is now it is less likely or possible for the hussein regime to return. :) good stuff! Have a nice day.

 Hmm libs who hate what urlLink ann coulter has to say? Yes, urlLink this blog is dedicated to hating ann and her recent book, thats messed up. the book is great and she is mostly right go read!!!! Oh and Avoid mike savage, tom brokaw, and our friend (hahahahaha) Mike moore the stupid white man. Oh and yea my bday was awesome thanks!

 Hey sup! Anyway I was thinking about the recent cuban imigrants issue and fond Jeb Bush was against it! Ha someone else! I feel those poor ppl should have been helped to our shores and given a chance sending them back is not a good idea. As for bad cuban ppl that needs to be dealt with somehow. Also tech just heard a great story of a 15 yr old who got photos of a man and his car who tried to kidnap the boy man that is cool! Major props to the guy with the phone most ppl wouldn't think he did nice! Also 100,000 troops will be able to vote for president this coming election via internet thats cool but lets hope we dont have any issues. Oh and check this out I gotta play this game so do you: urlLink quest for saddam its 15 $ and is a fps style game looks great!

 I got some issues it has been 50 yrs since a treaty of sorts or an armistice was signed to "end" the korean war which my grandfather served in, this is how I feel about it. I feel well towards s. korea even though there is business competition and strife between us and I will and hope all will join in defending them against n.korea once again except this time n.korea be defeated I would like n.korea to be what south is a great country I have friends from there who go back every summer it sounds and looks wonderful and the ppl have done nothing to north korea. Truman firing MacArthur and not finishing the job was stupid and cowardly macArthur was correct although what need be done was and is horrible it need be done and will likely work really were just screwed in this situation and it is only a matter of time which is not on our side nothing really is. As for the prime minister of japan being hated by his own ppl for his decision to aid us in iraq (the first time japan has since 45) and this includes not just small missions but real action. I defend him and he too gets my respect much like Blair these are the great men of our current time.

 Mel Gibson's "The passion" sounds great and although googlenews and a # of newspapers thing otherwise good for them. The reason gibson wont let non conservatives etc. in is he knows they will be rude etc. and critize no matter how good it is. And what do they care? They hate jews at least real jews and would let israel be destroyed. This is so messed up. And I tell you what even if I have to watch the film in aramiac I shall.

 hey head on over to urlLink the weekly standard and scroll to the bottom and check out "ann coulter's living" its a great parody all in Good fun I love the women although I disagree on things funny isnt? ANyway as for this Arnold for california business I was sure this would happen to be honest I am glad he is likely to win and is the best california can do cause I doubt ppl will vote for Issa (i would likely)

 Well I shoulda said recent something else that powell was quiting cause he isnt. i gotta say though just the same i dont like him alot hes ok glad he aint leaven I was ready to be totally pissed off and all. Anyway as for students being able to say the f word in school I dont see the huge deal with these 'swear words" but they are deemed inappropriate in places such as work and school and can hinder success so I would recommend they not be said toward teachers. but should it be ok to? Well yes its an expression teachers feed all this so why not? I think so. We are no different than that of an adult and should have the same rights also. I would likely not say such a word (s) in school but I rarely express feelings at school I just work and keep to myself rarely have I had such issues but if so punishment seems ridiculous. Anything else you ask? yea the recent episcopal church decision on homosexuals I have to disagree this is a church of god right? The bible is against this this is wrong. I do not hate gays nor this man but just the same bishop he should not be.

 Hmm.. still havent got that quest for saddam game help me someone send money or somethin! :( anyway as for all this recent announcement that Colin Powell will be leaving hey its a bummer the guy is smart and nice he has done a good job (I have a few issues) anyway will miss him much like fleisher bugs me so many seem to be towards bush I would glady serve sec state for bushs second term not sure why powell dont want to, messed up that is. ANyway here is an interesting blog I very much disagree with: urlLink freedomofspeach

 ALright get this apparently a documentary (endorsed by ann herself see her site!) is being made so visit the site and give them any tapes of her you have! BE a good watch this one.And I was only playing I know Dean didnt do it! But I still fear it was terrorism or a failure of our government just the same. Just playin!

 It wasnt the blaster worm virus that caused electricity to go out in the east that thing is weak in the code, come on! HEres a theory it was urlLink Dean and the canadians. urlLink Dean for america indeed dean for the destruction of america is more like it! :) hahahahahahahahah

 Geez through the urlLink blackout at least the internet worked like I mentioned the other day urlLink techweb has the story. Also found 2 blogs for which happened to cover the event a lib and a conservative: urlLink bilmon is the lib and urlLink marduk is the rep. Good blogs my fave is marduk.

 alright what does the school system etc. (teachers union) have against virtual schools? here locally in Boise a school urlLink has been screwed big time just because there agendas they would force a child some of whom are troubled and this is the best solution into going to the school they want them to. The result well kids that do go to this school (1300 locally in my area) get half as those who go to regular school ok makes sense! They need to get over it give these kids the rest of the money they arent recieving and quit being A$$ holes!see urlLink Idahostatesman for the story.

 urlLink Feedreader | new.media.tool looking to get into this rss feed stuff? Try feedreader as linked above. ITs great free open source and has a list of feeds on news topics like:iraq,computers,net,entertainment tons more! This is only one I could find for free and it works fine in fact when it gets new headline (s) it will pop up and let you know. However it wont completely uninstall itself and I cant access urlLink newsisfree! unless I do manually. So I hope to get a new version with those issues addressed. urlLink Lockergnome supports rss and so does urlLink rollingstone If you want news quick,constantly and without searching all over the web for it try rss!

 urlLink ICON ENTERTAINMENT INTERNATIONAL this is the official "the passion" site icon entertainment is the releaser the film is possibly do in easter of 04. urlLink Moviebox has the trailer. can't wait!

 Yes sobig (the virus) is the biggest one spread by email ever or at least the fastest. Googlenews has the story. Remember only open attachments if warned and have your email scanned for viruses and stay updated!

 Ok so been wondering whats better winzip or winrar have you? Well to be honest winrar its quick affordable (try for free) and with bittorrent you can find it for free although thats illegal! Also its not that hard to use and compresses better than winzip so the answer is:winrar. Also looking for a good film? Check out dreams by akira kurosawa its great on dvd now!

 urlLink TechTV | Is BitTorrent the Future of Downloading? looking for a open source,free,no spyware/virus ridden program for downloading? Well i have used bittorent for awhile and highly recommend it as does the linux guru urlLink Chris Dibona and the screen savers! Great, get it!

 urlLink Hillary - MiniClip.com

 urlLink Google also has btw a new toolbar and its great to! I click on the blogger button and it links in this post to the page I am on (google) it also has form filler (nice) pop up blocker and of course google search without being on googles page, only works with ie makes it alot better at that, get it today!

 urlLink google has a great new feature! ITs a calculator just enter a math problem like 23+3 and google search and you get your answer. Also found saddam that I did or at least his blog (hahaha) here it is urlLink Saddam's blog

 A purpose Each life has a purpose, Each purpose a plan; Great minds find a reason to do what they can.... a hope for tomorrow, a task for today, through trouble or sorrow, Each trial on lifes way.... a purpose for living, a test you must meet, accepting each challenge, the bitter, the sweet... Cast aside every problem, rise above endless fears, keep the dream you are dreaming, wipe away hurtful tears... understanding-forgiveness, a soul that knows peace, the joy of believing as heartaches then cease.... the courage that's needed to travel each mile, a purpose unequaled- a life thats worthwhile. Garnett Ann Schultz. I just thought I would share that with everyone. :)

 yet another reason not to vote for urlLink Howard Dean is well he spams! Yes according to urlLink slashdot like many geeks spamming me will certainly not help you! Another reason to dislike and not vote for the man. As for Gary Coleman for governor of California dont vote for him! Hes so braindead he didnt even know Cheney is vice president!

 Oh joy urlLink Dr. Laura a women who makes a living off harrassing ppl and telling them how to live (dr phil is another of this type) who has been for five yrs practicing judaism recently stopped and no longer will, well whoppidy dooo! Like she ever was practicing it or properly shes a lousy lib shes a liberal jew, one I cant stand. Just some breaking news.

 Just hear that fox turned down mel gibson's film "the passion" a real shame cause well they are such good friends and all i think and wish they would have and it would have been well done. However i hear there are many others interested so thats good. :( :)

 urlLink FOXNews.com Good stuff. Toatally agree needs to be dealt with and perhaps indeed the war was good move towards dealing with this.funny to this article but what do you expect its dennis miller course its funny! :)

 want a good browser besides say ie? Well try urlLink avant i havent but i hear it has tabbed browsing a popup blocker flash blocker and google search all included i hear its fast also. I will try it eventually. Also mozilla 1.4 is out but i heard some ppl say its not that great i may still give it a try. 1.5 is now in beta. I am still working on this rss thing looking to support rss 0.91(most stable etc), 1.0(most difficult) 2.0 (second best overall good one). And found another feeder to try for linux folks called snownews i believe give it try i hear good things. And I am looking into adding comments option also. :)

 urlLink Chris Pirillo ~ Getting Screwed While Everybody Else is Getting Laid this is funny its the most popular blog on the web hes jew and used to be on ttv does good work. The latest entry is funny. :) coffee!

 urlLink Johnny Cash News Yes as reported he is ill hopefully he will get better soon. And hey he won one award as you can see although he should have and I wish he had one more. He was the crowd fave after all.

 urlLink Headline news from Sky News - Witness the event bummer remember protect yourself i was just at a business who got it. Kid deserves it his protest was done the wrong way and likely still wont change anything.

 urlLink RollingStone.com: News: Hospitalized Cash to Miss VMAs heres the article a tad different and all.

 urlLink FOXNews.com Well I hope johhny cash gets well and gets the album started and done! Also hope he wins gotta go watch now he and trent reznor did great job on that song. Good luck. As for the 9/11 transcripts i read them they werent that bad sucks that it happened and again i extend my condolences to the families.

 urlLink FOXNews.com my fave news story of day! Thats great poor kid though thats along name. :) Also arnold scwarzenegger isn't that bad a guy he had an interview with urlLink Sean Hannity go to fox and make sure for coverage if you wanna here the interview at foxnews website need to be member.

I feel bad I am one of the latest registered users so I am partly to blame. :( sorry if I can i will pay. I wanna upgrade blogger to though and... well anyway ppl stop! And jason: sorry. :( luck man.

 urlLink FOXNews.com highly recomend reading the coverage and downloading the pdf's I am saddened this happended and again give my condolenses. And I demand as many others do nasa from this incident make many improvements it is obvious especially through this report that things need be done. Also is it nasa's fault sure to an extent maybe not entirely really who cares we all feel horrible about this and now improvements need be made! I say onward! Again on the 27th you will be able to around 5:52 am see if you miss it you cant see it again (mars) until august 28, 2287! Again i say no "nesting there

 urlLink The Idaho Statesman - Always Idaho its nice he came sure. ANd I am sure the liberals here including the statesman just loved it, i could care less. And he was speaking to about 10% of the pop. cause thats all thats democrat mostly in Boise. Only 200 ppl showed up for his talk. He wont get many votes or anything he wont win over idaho. Also in local news ashcroft was here trying to convince everyone was ok everyone here hates the patriot act (around 70% of ppl do) why? I dont know as long as I dont know someones close by watching what do I care unless I am doing something wrong and even if they werent watching someone still is (God) as for it being communism oh really move somewhere else then! Hell imagine china a real communist country or japan not communist but still citizens of tokyo are watched by cameras. Get over it. And dean, you suck and you wont win my state!

 urlLink Wired News: Sites Reconsider X-Rated Domain yes this should be for all or most porn sites! .xxx great use it make it a must! Oh and verification of age and payment etc. and no kid porn so screwed up this world is. And paypal should stop supporting porn or have good system to keep kids from accessing (do they?)

 urlLink Wired News: Senator Seeks .Sex good man I actually agree its good idea as well as I said to keep only adults to access that way even kids who wanna can't.

 urlLink The Japan Times Online well of course they dont want to its beneficial they make money and dont get nuked. Although bad sides to:supporting creeps screwed up country and allowing bad stuff into Japan. Need to do better job the japanese government does. :( Fine the ships come but within law and not supportive of government of n. korea.

 urlLink FOXNews.com I like this guy hes a good guy and I see nothing wrong with the ten commandments either nor do alot of ppl at least keep the commandments secularized i mean thou shalt kill is pretty good idea. Plus our nation was founded on the bible so i see no reason to change really. Glad ppl are protesting there i mean you go to the courthouse they have a greek goddess up on the wall but no cant have the ten commanments up come on be fair you want ten commanments down? Take it all down anything religious and even then secularism is a religion itself religion can not be escaped therefore decisions must be made they have and will be.

 I found you can find links and get my rss feed through urlLink weblogs.com have a nice day be here alot. :)

 urlLink Our Daily Bread: A Daily Devotional nice little read and all i have books of this they come out once every 3 months a number of churches hold them (methodist i think) nice.

 urlLink CNN.com - Our best look at Mars, ever - Aug. 24, 2003 very cool gotta try and see we all do. Do i think all this nasa stuff is good? yeah to an extent but I feel we need not get carried away. In the bible you can read that man will try and nest in the stars and will be cast out, ponder that.

 urlLink New York Post Online Edition: entertainment okay officially going to bed and no more coffee (okay more tomorrow) but i like this story and may watch. I like this guy and his last song dealing with the end times check it out! Hope he wins!And gets to be there. :) finally I say night yall :)

 urlLink The Miami Herald | 08/17/2003 | Teach your children good, er, well hilarious column. :)

 urlLink okay he charges? Weird. He is liberal? God isnt liberal and there is only one god and thats the god in the bible and he is far from liberal. Oh and he's episcopalian that explains alot oh and as for his book christianity will need to change or die has he not read revelations? Geez check him out but do not be decieved.

 urlLink Welcome to anncoulter.com!

 urlLink FOXNews.com - Foxlife - Timothy Bottoms Plays it Straight in Sept. 11 Film I have a feeling as to the actors politics but who cares the movie looks good and I hope it does get some things out there. :) tommorrow.

 urlLink FOXNews.com - Top Stories - Afghan Troops Kill 84 Taliban, Capture Leader

 Just a reminder bush will address the nation tommorrow (he did as you see below today) on iraq. Also dc:9/11 is on sunday also on urlLink showtime

 urlLink FOXNews.com - Politics - Transcript: President's Weekly Radio Address all good things although a test does not always work a kid can freeze up thus scoring poorly when he could have done well. Or could simply bomb a test and still be a brain school vouchers for private school also needed!And yes reform is good and good spending control more money is good but spend wisely schools.

 urlLink FOXNews.com - Politics - Vouchers for D.C. Could Spur Wider Trend well I hope it happens and spreads.

 urlLink Good News | The most important event in history

 Gas prices to expensive for you? want them lower? Sure, we all do. And guess what it can be done and its the governments responsibility (last time i checked) to keep it under control.

 urlLink ABCNEWS.com : Spears Says Mom Approved of Madonna Kiss its all hype and disgusting. Madonna is nasty and now britney is. Apparently her parents are bad ones and she is kinda tryin to fix things up a bit to bad.

 urlLink FOXNews.com - Foxlife - Depp: 'Dumb Puppy' Quote Twisted My Words I still dont like him and he is likely back tracking. Thats a nice thing about america its nice and new. Europe is fine (minus most the people) but america is better.

 urlLink SHO.com - Movies - DC 9/11: Time Of Crisis - Main Page the movie i speak of get a reminder if you need it! I got something special coming soon also likely on nine eleven.

 urlLink FOXNews.com - Business - Universal Slashes All CD Prices in Attempt to Lure Music Buyers thats good all cd co's should follow I want cds to be 7.99-12.99 sounds good and tech needs to be engaged cause people like to stream and download!

 urlLink Yahoo! LAUNCH - News: Britney Spears Explains Kissing Madonna yes well i doubt her. Maybe she has before? Maybe and likely she will again. And madonna? grosse. Also on politics she likely doesnt like bush much or the war. :(

 urlLink Heaven & Hell for PC at GameSpot hmm.. getting a little carried away with this simulator thing arent we? yes. So messed up.

 I really dont care what any Democrat has to say. I personally am behind Bush 100%. I think that most Americans understand that the economy was on a downward spiral before Bush came into office. I appreciate what he has been trying to do. I think he has really risen to the occasion. I plan to do what I can to ensure he is reelected. Bart (Hendersonville, NC) Gotta go with this guy on what he wants to ask the dems at the black caucus tuesday I vote bush also likely. However I still wanna know and them answer with explanations as to why these things:abortion, health care, environment,economy and the war on terorism how will they deal with these thing and how do they feel. etc.

 sorry the show with the candidates is on september 9th tuesday at 8pm eastern. Got mixed up with something else. Remember to watch also sunday a documentary film about bush on 9/11 is showing on showtime.

 urlLink Internet for Christians fun for kids and okay for them. Not a fan myself. As for entertainment I am awaiting the joshua movie and some novels. Remember debate on fox!

 urlLink TechTV | 'The Screen Savers' Favorites also cool but I prefer adaware over spybot and yes winrar is great. Dont forget foxnews is hosting a debate today! for audio I like real player winamp is cool to.

 urlLink TechTV | PDF Usability Crimes good stuff fox and nasa recently did this for the columbia report I didn't want to read it like that online and it did take to long so I printed it and sat in a different room in my fave chair and read it much better. how about choices try some of these sites and companys need to do!

 urlLink FOXNews.com - Politics - Estrada Drops Out of Judicial Race this sucks but is understandable he needs to move on, thats cool. I wish him luck. (signed petition and everything in support I did. Did you?)

 urlLink FOXNews.com thats treason really to talk poorly of your country most countries would hurt you or something! Also its lame I am made fun of for god sakes look at this moron. And if the french are so brilliant why do they have some 10,000 people dead? Because they go with socialism thats why. He can have france, he can have his french fries and I'll have my freedom fries!

 urlLink FOXNews.com

 urlLink FOXNews.com well some good things and certainly some bad things even if you dislike someone throwing eggs at someone is rude and childish. :( come on people. I would like someone more conservative honestly but he will do if he wins that is I think he will though. Also I think he should have been at the debate but oh well he better get with it though. And also thank god I dont live there i would like to really but so many bad things i would rather not. Ok rambling on now. Sorry later.

 sites a bit messed up right now I have moved some stuff (email link and blogroll link) and added a urlLink biblegateway search engine at the bottom maybe google or something next?

 urlLink Statement from Dr. Kennedy on Federal order to remove Ten Commandments monument in Alabama - ChristianAnswers.Net great article with links to other great articles give it a read. And do some thinking. :)

 urlLink Barnes&Noble.com - Is Our Children Learning?: The Case Against George W. Bush oh yes great book lovely title to. Please do buy so you can enjoy a laught, at dems and this author. :) hahaha bush is no fool he is no different really then most of us americans dems pride themselves on intellegence and practically think their God then why are they such failures in all they do? Why are they the ones who are screwed up in so many ways morally and otherwise? Notice all the media that covered it are a bunch of lame ass morons that few if any ppl watch or like? All the kid needs to do is learn maybe have some help yes but if anything democrats are responisble and bad teachers/parents and the kids themselves.

 urlLink FOXNews.com yes parents fill that way mine and most. Some seem to like it (moms mostly stay at home) I agree it is a bit much. Particularly public schools large ones. Changes would indeed be nice of course. Another part of our culture this soccer mom stuff.

 urlLink FOXNews.com sorry man but you wont be rewarded and you may want to ask forgiveness for your sin. YOu still commited murder which is wrong. YOu and that man are both wrong and in the end God will deal with you likely neither of you without repentance will be rewarded likely punished instead.

 Silent Night (september 11th edition) You say you will never forget where you were when you heard the news on September 11, 2001. Neither will I. I was on the 110th floor in a smoke filled room with a man who called his wife to say, "Good-bye." I held his fingers steady as he dialed I gave him the peace to say, "Honey, I am not going to make it, but it is OK...I am ready to go." I was with his wife when he called as she fed breakfast to their children. I held her up as she tried to understand his words and as she realized he wasn't coming home that night. I was in the stairwell of the 23rd floor when a woman cried out for Me for help. "I have been knocking on the door of your heart for 50 years!" I said, "Of course I will show you the way home - only believe in Me now." I was at the base of the building with the Priest ministering to the injured and devastated souls. He heard my voice and answered. I was on four of those planes, in every seat, with every prayer. I was with the crew as they were overtaken. I was in the very hearts of the believers there, comforting and assuring them that their faith has saved them. I was in Texas, Kansas, London. I was standing next to you when you heard the terrible news. Did you sense Me? I want you to know that I saw every face. I knew every name - though not all know Me. Some met me for the first time on the 86th floor. Some sought Me with their last breath. Some couldn't hear Me calling to them through the smoke and flames; "Come to Me...this way...take My hand." Some chose, for the final time, to ignore Me. But, I was there. I did not place you in the tower that day. You may not know why, but I do. However, if you were there in that explosive moment in time, would you have reached for Me? September 11, 2001 was not the end of the journey for you. But someday your journey will end. And I will be there for you as well. Seek Me now while I may be found. Then, at any moment, you know you are "ready to go." I will be in the stairwell of your final moments. Remember...I love you.

 urlLink FOXNews.com - Top Stories - Bush Marks 'Sad' Anniversary With Low-Key Remembrance

 urlLink FOXNews.com - Top Stories - World Joins U.S. in Marking Sept. 11 Anniversary

 Finished watching the movie urlLink joshua based on a novel last night. Wonderful film the whole family can enjoy together. Very well done in all ways. 4 outta five.

 urlLink Johnny Cash News good news and I await the new album!

 well I went ahead and watched the debate again (video) and decided to comment some more from this debate I got the feeling as I think many did these guys dont relate nor care to/about the american people thats one thing I got. I also payed attention to the individual candidates and found this; lieberman was actually doing well with say his attack on Dean's anti-israel remark and however later drug himself down. Dean gave off the impression he was well a jerk a bit intimadating (did you see kerry what a wimp) and also with his words (on michigan university etc) aimed directly at blacks which is ok i guess. Not to mention he came off a bit arrogant throughout the debate. The only guy who to me seemed straight forward and answered questions was Dennis Kasinich (sp? Sorry) and he is a nut bag a Carter of sorts. everyone else dodged around a bit. Great show.

 urlLink FOXNews.com - Top Stories - Public Schools Fail to Teach History, Study Charges largely because they often are anti america. And yes history sucks one reason I hate public school every private school i have been to has a great history course versus public school.

 Just watched the debate on foxnews the first the black caucus has ever held. I think it was pretty much a waste the strongest of the debaters were in my opinion AL Sharpton and Lieberman. They were pretty funny the comedy was thanks to some rude audience members who yelled and screamed there opinions. Oh and are these guys nuts talking about the patriot act? Unless you are threatening to hurt someone or the USA you should have no problem unless you are looking at porn or how to build weapons on your pc you are fine I see nothing wrong with the patriot act (although many fellow Idahoans do) and as for complaints this is a vietnam how? And all this talk about universal blah blah health care sounds like socialism or something europeans do and have a look at the model of that system:France, they just lost 10,000 elderly people because of their system and wonderful CHirac! Ok well I guess I am done ranting now later. :)

 urlLink What does your phone number spell? fun site.

 urlLink Free Adrian Lamo

 urlLink Wired News: Bush Push for Stiffer Hack Fines this is fine but those who only help companies and are not spies! And also why not hire these hackers for your company to help you? This is reasonable here but for instance lamo should get some but not severe punishment and perhaps he will get a job at a company in it or something. Fine with everything at the bottome of page one but dont tax hds (i need new one soon!)

 later tonight I will or tommorrow will cover the debate on urlLink foxnews as for the post I just made about the bible code I am not sure I beleive but certainly many of the things (sept 11) have happened and this i mentioned peace soon could so keep an eye out as I will. I may read the book also. ITs the bible code by Michael Drosnin. Also just finished reading great comic series (2) called maus its rather old but if you havent read yet do! Anyway time to comment on some news first this hacker the urlLink NYtimes is pissed at really thats fine he is wrong he should ask for companies permission first befor hacking them and finding flaws his punishment should be small he should apologize and then ask permission from here on! And as for the boston tea party remake in seatle over a ten cent tax on coffee there its ridiculous! They are nuts its only ten cents! Drink less if you must and for god sakes it goes to children funds I am willing to pay 10 cents extra these people are nuts.

 urlLink Headline news from Sky News - Witness the event yeah just keep on killin! I tell you this those who explode to kill are not commiting suicide no a far worse crime homicide perhaps most accurately both! They sure as hell arent going to any heaven, just hell. Condolenses to loved ones and I pray for peace as I hope you do. Be warned we could see peace this month or next and then we have 7 yrs and then the end. Check out the bible code books in the torah a prediction can be found that the world will end in fall 2010 that means the next few months a peace agreement must be met. HMm..

 urlLink FOXNews.com - Politics - Raw Data: Text of Address here is the full text already commented on the speech. So the democrats are critisizing huh? what did you expect? Also they will be on television to debate on foxnews tomorrow evening hours. :)

 Just finished watching Bush's speech awhile ago, I feel it was well written sure it was short and general but he put alot of stuff in there in short time and thats all that was needed. We will learn details on things like the spending in the future so dont worry. Yes he stumbled in his speech but hey it happens he is human and just one of those people as am I. And now onward! I think going in with the U.N is fine but only if we still have most or pretty much all control. Also ponder this do the french like jews? Do the germans like jews? Do the iraqis etc. no they would all get along it bugs me and this should be pondered for that will be the final conflicts its all just now coming to surface.

 People whine we need international involvement but I see 30 or so countries are involved, I would like them to be more involved and I would like the U.N and france,germany involved (not cause I like them thats for sure) but we should still have the most control this they do not like, to bad then forget them, until they agree. As for N.Korea for know keep them under control I say and slow or stop them even if just temporarily until we finish with Iraq then we (with many others hopefully) go in and deal with them. These things will take time. As for Bush's speech tonight I will have coverage of but many democrats are saying he is doing the speech because polls currently are not in his favor, true and thats a good reason for him to. It does not show weakness he was likely planning a speech anyway either this is coincedence or a bonus and even if not who cares its politics and him fighting back is something he must do. Hopefully things will improve after this speech. See you later. :)

 urlLink FOXNews.com - Politics - Ashcroft Fires Back at Patriot Act Critics if true which I am not of course a hundred percent sure, thats great.

OR a sign for my business or that i cant build on my house without going by rules and paying $$$ they still do those things wouldnt you wrather they quit that?

Anyway bush will work with well that makes sense and all I can understand the backing off a bit by bush. mclintock is the true repbublican in this and arnold will win. Really some of the sexual things arnold did are no biggie but some are so attacking if you will is not bad cause well its wrong and bush backing up because of that is fine as well. polls close soon.

 urlLink BillOReilly.com: Articles - Don't Mess With the Folks about this movie I think it is indeed sad and distasteful this movie especially with him in his current state most people do. many and mostly conservatives demanded the movie be takin off air and that has happened but it wasn't entirely because of them it was a financial issue they weren't censored just greedy and cowardly. I am glad the movie will not be on cbs and hope it does poorly I admit and I will not be watching. As for this elizabeth smart stuff it saddens me these parents they could have went on cbs or abc or nbc and told the story no need for a film or book, its all $$$$! shame on them, I urge you not to watch the film or read the book I will not be doing so.

 I would like to thank our president, Mr Bush for signing the bill he did to day. For protecting children, for saving human lives and avoiding possible trauma to families and the women themselves. Thank you president bush. sadly many are already challenging the bill :( to them I say stop the murder!

 The reagan movie was cancelled on cbs and moved to showtime I am somewhat happy with the decision because well it seems this is what the ppl wanted somewhat really they didn't want it on tv at all but then I am saddened this is political correctness and all I am against I say show they wouldn't though they are cowards and greedy. note: not fan of or supporter of film but may have watched and may still. Also yes this was largely a conservative movement dispite what ppl say. another note: Reagan was and is a great man. :)

 local elections just ended try my local news sites if interested:idahostatesman.com and ktvb.com I recomend. Sadly the canidates I was hoping for lost Dave Bieter won with over 50% :( Now to see what he does and some analysis.

 ok well its local election day for many including me! I can't vote :( but I know who I want to win and would vote for. My lame parents won't go vote. I voting(wish) for republicans Chuck winder for mayor and urlLink dwight johnson among others for city council. hope they win without me. Also major props to p Diddy for that run the other day! :)

 All this talk about the Reagan show that is to air on cbs, why? Its not even out you havent seen so why comment or boycott, stop overreacting give it a chance. I am very skeptical of the actors performances and looks and if the film is done poorly and such I will then inforce and support boycotting cbs. Reagan was certainly a great man in my opinion the best president we've had. Bush (current) gets second. :)

 technical support I haven't used it much just some with dell and I gotta say I hate their support! Times will very I have advanced support so sometime less than 10 min. I cool with that but man it can be narly on the wait times :( then there's the accents of the employees (located in India often) it can be a pain. Other than that great they have always solved the problem and been polite and handled it quickly although a few times they were to call me back after 30 minutes or so, never called that's happen 3 outta 4 times :( and then hardware support is well the same the nice thing here is when things go wrong they get it fixed like when I needed a new hd it was here for free in 2 days although for such support beyond say a year you must pay. Overall dell support is better than most but I'd say there is room for improvement at least some.

 Gay marriage Is getting bigger, closer to a national reality. Now being supported in Massachusetts. I have heard conservatives say its a good thing cause they will do all the things a married couple has to (taxes and the like) sure but why not do that minus the marriage? Its blasphemy! God is against homosexuality, its viewed by many as immoral and marriage is a or supposed to be a religious thing, a bit of a slap in the face. As some have said of homosexuals who as I've said I know and feel they should be treated as all others and have rights just not marriage "we're here, we're queer, we're in your face" well said.
