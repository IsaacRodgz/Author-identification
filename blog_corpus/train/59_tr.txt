 lol...The Little (Spanish) Pimps. Nice. Anyways...Marten, you're not the only one stressed. I think we all are...and everyone in the play is totally needing to be avoided. So, I understand. lol, I know my personal reason for being so moody...but ya'll prolly don't care nor want to know. Yep. I hope you get un-stressed soon...I miss the old Marten who didn't yell at me for painting the wrong way in stage tech. :-( SQ(u)EE!

 O yeah, I knew that. I saw that he died on the news. hehe. didn't make name connection, never watched price is right. Erin is the lead in the play. yay erin! I am sad, i think. maybe im just tired. I need to do speech. the play is affecting me more than I thought it would. indirectly, of course. stress pipes. yarg, you interpret. thinky sleep good, burritos. Sophia: "its not you, its me" I appologize for moodiness. I stressy. need a punching bag and a very long nap. stuff is leaky.

 Erin is a senior who is friend of Comstocks, Marten, and Thomas. By the way Nathan, I posted a blank message accidently while trying to edit a former post, so I had to find some way to use it. I wasn't trying to be nasty or anything. Death to Mr. Hall! SQEE!

 Who's Erin? haha. Ln has one Native American. haha. I find that funny for some reason. I want to apologize, Marten, for acting like such a...umm...butt-munch? today. I don't know what's going on...just some odd hormonal imbalance or something. Oh well. Enough about my body's chemistry. Who's Erin? SQEE!

 Found a useful website today. Comparative information on public schools of Indianapolis can be found urlLink here . All the vital stats, as they say. I find it really funny that LN has exactly one Native American student. I think I know her. You know what annoys me? Ugly people who like to shout across the computer lab about their social lives to equally ugly people. Hicks is a good, stereotypical word for them, or maybe white trash. They like to verbally abuse each other. Marten: Bob Barker? The "Price is Right" guy? You are so out of it. Thomas: Point taken. SQEE!

 Who's Robert? I hope that text thingy works. I hope I remember to do it. I also hope I remember to do my original oratory manuscript. Thomas wrote his in one night. I laugh. Laugh with me its funny. So was BOO!, a bunch of "scary" shorts that LC players perform. anywhy, I could've sworn either Nathan or Jonah said something about Lara. Maybe it was just Thomas. Michael said her posts weren't funny. We must all obey the Great Michael!. Sophia: there wasn't a real poll. um. don't hit me. or anything. Jonah: I want a spork of doom. Thomas: I can't go another day without central heating. Nathan: I hope that works. Lara wont make a very good minion. Lara: You can still post, can't you? I knew I forgot something! Erin: HEY! ERIN! um... YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO TIME TO POST RIGHT NOW(oops), SO I'M NOT GONNA BOTHER TELLING YOU TO DO SO!(ewok, be happy) You know, I could take Lara off just cuz this is a lot of people to have on a blog. The spell check on this prgram didn't know the words ewok, Jonah, or Erin. I thought everyone knew those.

 See below to see what it would like if I posted as much as you all. SQEE!

 SQEE!

 The results are in for state. I have the scores but not allowed to post 'em. Sorry Jonah. LC got fourth, which is disappointing compared to last year's second place, but I am still happy with a great performance. We got 6th in music and that is what dragged us down. We got 3rd in visual, and 3rd in general effect. Indy regionals and Grand Nationals will be very exciting. Nathan: I shared your soul with Jonah and it gave me a soar throat :( Jonah: PiE! Huzzah for marching band despite the Protests of Marten and Soph Sophia: When are we gonna get a duo?! By the way, I do not post often because my posts would be pointless if I did. I only post when I have something to say. SQEE!

 Rest in Peace, Robert Barker. If all dogs go to heaven, you're gonna have a hard time when they found out who told their owners to spay and nueter them. Just kidding. You were a good man, and we hate to lose you. The price was wrong. I know I've had a lot of Oklahoma titles recently, but it's what I know really well. Marten, go to View, Text size, Medium. That should solve your problem. It was a genetics project. Soph, I likle that name better than Mindless robots and some of the others. Lara, I'll support you, but only if you agree to be my minion. Thomas, post more often. Jonah, you're allergic to souls, remember? SQEE!

 Marten, was this one of those "Hey, Thomas do you think?" polls? 'Cause Nate and I don't remember being polled either. As long as I'm posting, it's time for the State report-LN version. We recieved 6th place, a seemingly bad spot. In fact, though, we were 2nd place in marching to Avon by 3/4 of a point and third in music. We were only 6th because we were eighth in general effect, and that could be attributed to our band being very small compared to the others. This made us too quiet for the dome and ruined the pianissimos at the beginning and end of the show, which contributed to the low effect score. So really, the score isn't so bad considering what we had against us. We still should have beat Carmel. But we were winners anyway, because we drink milk. In other news I'm wearing a birthday hat. Yay! And Now, Mtto5: Marten: Nope, didn't get smaller for me. Also, don't tell Lara but I'm with you. Thomas: Now you write the LC version! Larry: Nice Poem. Also, don't tell Marten, but I'm with you. Also also, your new title scheme is Famous Chiropractors. Have Fun. Sophia: I like your poems, too. I like the second one better. The first one has a few lines that don't sound poetic enough. Nathan: I will eat your soul with my spork of doom. SQEE!

 Haha...I think this is possibly the stupidest band name I've thought of for this thing. It's quite possible. lol. Anyways...I don't remember the poll either. And I've gotten over my problem with not being the only girl on here...so I think she should stay! lol Larry's funny. Anyways. Life is pretty boring. Everyone's sick. It's dreadful. I hate being sick.SQEE!

 What polls? I never saw any polls?! I should be allowed to vote too! If I really have been voted off then why is this post showing up? hmm?!?! I help out here! You're nothing but a BIG MEANIE MEANIE MEANIE!!! phoo...I hate you...I LOATHE you! lol LARRY LIVES!!! SQEE!

 Did the print suddenly shrink for anyone else? its giving me a headache. Lara, I apologize, but the polls are in and you've been voted off of the blog. Obviously, you'll still be able to read it and if you have anything good to post you can post it through my name. 68 on what? SQ(u)EE!

 Ok, I've calmed down. I get fits of rage sometimes; I'm better now. Plus it was pointed out to me that it's a 68 out of 80, which is actually closer to an 83%. I'd just seen the 68 and assumed it was a percentage. I know that's not the actual name of the song, but it makes more sense and I'm lazy. SQUEE!

 Lisa, since I know you read this, my e-mail has been down since the move (a little over a month). I can finally recieve messages now, but I can't send them. Secondly, well, I'll get to that when I can reply to you. I didn't want you to think I was being petty. Sorry, everyone else. It's always a little stressful to get a months worth of E-mails all at once, and Lisa's were only slightly less annoying than Amazon.com's: Problem with your billing information. Your order will be canceled in... 10...9...8...7...6. Lucky I got to it now. It still delays my order by 6 frickin' days. Other general complaints: My title scheme is to frickin' hard, Levi hogs the computer too much, and the flickering light above my head is really starting to get annoying. Oh, and Ms. Knapp can take her 68% and stuff it. (I don't know what she can stuff, it just seemed like the right thing to say.) Errrr..... SQUEE!

 I was at my friend's house and she has this book from the library called the Encyclopedia of Serial Killers. It had all these serial killers and what they did listed and all sorts of creepy sadistic things. Its also had some "symptoms" for phsycopathic/serial killery...ness. There was bedwetting until adolesence as one and animal torture and obsession with fire too.. I like fire (-^^-) lol Eeww, Marten, that game is gross. Even if it isn't really that graphic its just... =p. And its 6:15 when you come in! 6:15! Sophia: thnx =D and you're welcome I can't think of a title scheme so just give me one and I'll stick to it. SQUEE!

 Havent seen him since Bang Bang, still havent got the tape, have you? Sorry i couldn't help much poeticly. 6:30 Marten turns the light on so I barely make it to the bus A freind of mine sent me a link to this weird game. Its called city jumper or sumthin, the object being to jump over sky scrapers, lest ye end up as a pool of blood. Kind of fun in a wierd time wasting way. http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/flash/cityjumper.php SQEE!

 lol...get it? Rachael Aull?! hahaha, man I'm so funny. Anyways...she's doing speech this year? SO EXCITING!!! Thanks you guys for helping me with my poems...lol for those of you who actually commented (cough Lara cough), your comments were really fantastic. Thanks so much! And your poem...(trying to think of perfect word here)...wow. That's all I can think of to say right now. You know? Anyways...I don't actually know if it's based purely on the writing or on performance...I'd guess that it's based on the writing since there are other performing categories...but I really don't know! Gracias, señors/señorita!! SQEE!

 I'm not much for free verse poetry. I think it's more of an expression for yourself than for others. For me it is anyway, its how I vent. Not surprisingly, the only real poems I've written in the last two years or so, class assignments excluded, have been about Laura. There's one in my other blog. My problem is, whenever I write a poem I actually like, it's to personal for me to share with anyone. I find I can't write poetry about something unless I really, deeply, care about it, in which case I can't share it. Getting back to the point, I really can't judge because I just can't get into that form of poetry. I don't know enough about what makes it 'good' -- seems pretty arbitrary to me. My question is, do you perform it, or are you being judged purely on the writing? Lara - don't you think Tiny Explosions fits Sophia's title scheme better? Marten - It's Larry. Rachael's doing speech, and he's offered to help out like our dad is. Secret soul, by the way, is a super cool duet from "Jane Eyre the Musical" SQUEE!

 Alrighty then. My title scheme is just things that have absolutly nothing to do with my post unless of course you dissect it and it might have something to do with it. About poetry, you have come to the right person. Marten, poetry doesn't have to rhyme, but its still fun to find words that do. Your poems are great already. Believe me I've been published. I personally think that the first draft is usually the best. It shows what your thinking at the exact moment of writing and that is usually the deepest point of that partiular emotion. Here's one of mine that I just wrote Thursday. I was listening to SOAD and I was so tired I didn't even want to get up and turn off my cd player or my the light. I barely reached for my notebook to write it down: "Waking Up Is Hard To Do" 5:00 Radio turns on automatically I pound my fingers on the large button on top It stops 5:05 Radio turns on automatically I pound my fingers on the button Radio still plays I pound harder Radio still plays I retreat back under my comforter Radio talks about Sex Gays Enhancements Trends Money, money, money Sell, sell, sell Buy, buy, buy I shrink further beneath the comforter I hide I fear to face the cold angry winds outside my bedroom The radio is just a taste of what hides outside my safe haven My heaven My lounge My healing 5:20 I mash the button again Radio stops I roll over to doze in my newfound silence Silence.. When all are at peace 5:25 Radio plays automatically I try to shut it out Try to think I try to be at peace No success I wish to die I reconsider my wish I give into the Radio Set me free SQEE!

 Um, I dont know much about poetry. About all I can say is that its kind of intersting, but it doesnt rhyme. I wonder if i could ever get excited for anything like that. Maybe opening night of a show I'm involved in somehow is the equivelent. your father? That would be interesting. Unless of course im wrong, then it might be more interesting. SQEE!

 Hey guys, my diary won't let me post...so you'll get to give me feedback instead! lol I wrote two poems (so far) for Project XL and I'd like to know what you think. I don't think they're the best I've written ever...so...please...be nice. "Change Over Time" My 7th Grade Teacher's Favorite phrase used to seem Absurd, abstract. But now I see, That behind the times, there really has been Change Over Time. Once the world was dead, dark, desolate, but by dawn there came lights. Light from the sun, Light from man's brilliance. But these lights Couldn't be relied upon. So we're ever-searching, ever-wondering: What prompted this Change Over Time? ~*~ (Insert Title Here…possibly “A Moment”) The sun rises over a dying cornfield. Crows take flight awakened by the sudden, blinding light. Their world has changed in an instant. One moment forever altering their future. So, as I said, not the best I’ve ever written. I think my time when poetry was easy for me is over. Now I have to work for it. So this is just the first draft. Yep. So please tell me! SQEE!

 I'm really excited about State tomorrow. The odd thing about that is, I'm not in marching band. I'm excited like a normal person would be about the World Series or the Super Bowl, or like I would be about the season Premier of Stargate. I want to see how it turns out. Anything can happen. I've been forced into doing USX at Connersville. That gives me about a week to learn how to Extemp. and put together a file with absolutely know help. To make matters worse, no one knows where last years is (not that it would do us all that much good anyway). Amar(at least two of you knows him, so I figure he's ok) has quite unexpectedly offered to give me a hand, and I'm grateful, if a bit confused. His sister donated a bunch of stuff too, but shes actually nice sometimes so it was less surprising. I still don't have enough. Marten, guess who's gonna be judging and helping us out at speech meets? Hint: it's an LN parent you know very well..... SQEE!

 The procrastinator is from thief of time. It may be paraphrased though, I haven't read it in a while. Sorry about disappearing regularly at Thomas'. I was just a bit restless and bored. Had to move around. Lara: Your title scheme cannot be invisible. If it was invisible, we would not be able to see your titles. I will kick you if you do not lower stealth fields. And technicly, the only way someone passes any class like its nothing is by getting a D. That proves that it's nothing (important) and its passing. You get no points.

 You know Alex?! OMG he is soo hott! He was in Jazz Band, Honors Chamber, and regular concert orchestra last year at FCV, so everyone knows who he is. Thats why making Jazz Band was so important to me, it makes me feel like I'm really, really good but now I feel like everyone is watching me to see if I'm as good as he is. Now I guess since I'm first chair now, with no practice, I might skip over to the eighth grade orch. if I DO practice...hmm...Or else I'll just be really, really, really good...Or maybe its because the other three are really, really bad... Marten and Sofa: You know what'll be really funny?! When I have Mr. Hall and I pass his class like its nothing. lol but the way you guys are talking I probably wont...poopoo.. SQuEE!

 For those of you who don't know, I'm a section editor for the North Star, our newspaper. I'm currently overbooked, working on two stories and a page. Story 1: The Skinny on Wrestling. Sarah, editor of our quarterly magazine MEOW, had the brilliant idea of taking the two least athletic people on staff, and making them participate in various sports for the magazine. This eventually led to The Skinny. In it's final incarnation, Colin Dugdale and I (the aforementioned least athletic people) attend a wrestling (this issue, anyway) practice and observe. Afterward, we get together with the few of the guys, don the uniforms, and wrestle each other. Pictures are taken and everyone laughs at us. (Fun gig, eh?) We've watched the practice, we have to do the stuff and write the story Monday. Story 2: Regime makes (wins, loses, etc.) State. The other girl in both North Star and Marching Band and I are splitting this story because we're the only two people on staff willing to attend the competition. Because of the nature of it, we can't even do interviews until the end of Saturday, and we'll write the story on Monday. Page: I'm always responsible for designing the feature page, usually at least a two day proccess. Because all the reporters with stories on the page got extensions, I haven't been able to start it. Due: Monday. So that's my Monday. My Journalism class will be spent writing the Regime Story, SRT wrestling with Colin, and I'll stay after to design the page. Or else I'll make the assistant features editor design the page by herself. I hate having to give up the fun one, though. The moral of this post: Don't volunteer to do two stories in one weekend if you also have a page to design and the paper gets sent to press Tuesday! And Now Mtto4 Nathan: AD&D? All over again? Why not? Marten: Where does the procrastinator quote come from? Lara: Actually, we have an electric bass in our marching band this year. Alex Shumard - he's in the pit. Sophia: So there is no Matthew Broderick-Nathan Lane version?

 Mr. Hall is an idiot...for those of you who don't know, he's our speech teacher, and he's the devil incarnate. I hate him soooooooo (times infinity and one) much. GRRR!! My oratory isn't due until the last day, though...but I still need to work on it. so ha. Anyways...my friend (the one who burned me the CD and told me to rent the video) told me this morning that the Producers we rented last night was the only one. I'm super sorry guys...I was looking for the songs. SORRY! lol and sorry for yelling so much...ya'll just wouldn't stop talking! GOSH! Anyways...working on burning the CD for you Thomas and Comstock. lol I don't remember which one of you asked me for the CD...was it Nathan? I think it was...I can't remember! AGHSH!!! lol SQEE!

 Hmm.... I guess it could be fun, and if its the simple version, I guess. (ARG BLOODY ORATORY) Hey Lara, (AGH! SPEECH) large mound of insignifigance is (BLAME!) funny, but (DEATH TO MR. HALL!) you really need a real title scheme. (AAAAAAAAAGH!) I really need to go work on something(IMPORTANT!) important now. I'll be awhile. SQ(u)EE!

 I am so bored I'm posting for the third time today. ( -.- ')I have nothing to do. The lock in at church started 45 minutes ago so they're all having good times without me. Broomball... Corn Maze... Cosmic bowling... All the pizza and soda you could ever want... Its not really much of a lock in but I went last year and it was awesome. The Dungeons and Dragons thing sounds pretty cool even though I have no idea how to play, but oh well, I'll learn. Since I'm so bored here's some li'l pictures: =^.^= maow! -^.^-)> (>-^.^- t(-^.^-t) finger givin' kirby man!!

 So, I was unpacking the other day, and I came across an old dusty box that I'd mindlessly packed into another box. I opened it up and found a wealth of stuff from when Levi, Jonah, and I used to play Dungeons and Dragons together -- character sheets, maps, dice, and the old second addition books. I realized that I really want to get back into it again -- and I'd like to invite you all to join me, Lara included. I'm telling Tyler Rudd, Paul Simmons, and a few others you don't know about it, and I'm hoping to get together a diverse adventure group of 5 or 6 people. I volunteer to be dungeon master, but if someone else wants the job, I'm open to different arrangements. It's a lot of work though. Don't say no till you've thought about it. Old fashioned pen and paper RPGs, with the right group of people, can be really fun, and we're going to use 'simplified' rules, so learning the basics should take maybe an hour, hour and a half tops. It's just an idea right now, but if enough people are interested, it'll end up actually happening. WIGII!

 MSN sucks. I've been rp chatting with an email address that said I was 13 since I was 10 and now that I'm actually 13 irl it says that i have to be 18 or older to chat. ''>. SQUEE!

 Mmmm Bacon... Umm I can't join marching band because...I can't. I'm not in band, I'm first chair bassist! Before you ask, there are four others I have to compete with. whoohoo go me... Maybe next week I'll just bring an air freshener for everyone. Marten, don't hit Pixy with your stick. He's cool. He might be a bit of an anarchy freak but he's still nice. Maybe I should just tell you that I go out with someone I hate so you'l beat them up for me...hmmm SQuEE!

 Lol, Marten might need to get his stick out of his closet. Nathan : Alright, I apologize, I'm sorry. I was kinda being mean calling you a donkey and stuff (cuz that was the ass I was referring to). Jonah : Of course there are other guys! lol, you didn't seriously think ya'll were the only guys I flirted with! I can at least think of four others off the top of my head. And about Claire...I am sorry, but I still think high school relationships are pretty stupid, so I knew ya'll were gonna break up. It's just a fact of life right now. But I'm very proud of you for breaking up amicably. That's always wonderful. So...support! Larry : Haha, my nickname's Sofa, so it's all good. And, yes, it's only the FCV band room that smells like that. I actually noticed that while I was there, too! LC's band room isn't bad at all...you just have to ignore how many sweaty marching band members have practiced in there and it smells perfectly normal! lol. BTW: You aren't considering joining marching band...are you????? Marten : You turd muffin! You didn't say anything about my wonderful couch!!! lol just kidding...but you still didn't say anything to me. :-(. hehe So...that's it. See ya'll tonight!!!!! SO EXCITED!!! SQUEE!

 Nate: Sorry about the cursing, but the first attack was baseless and the second attack was below the belt. Like my least favorite post of yours, Maria, If you didnt spend so much time on the people, and just got to the point, I wouldn't be complaining. Especially if you didn't even know the people, u didnt have to list them. You could just get to your point of the post. Jonah: Well, I didn't know whether or not I should be sorry, you said you broke up on good terms. Sorry about ignoring your problems. Lara: um, wait for the band folks. I like your bass, don't trade it. And while I could just kick people off left and right, I wouldn't be left with anyone to blog with. I don't want to do this alone, it would turn into a diary kind of thing with a whole lot of rambling about stuff no one cares about, and i can do that in my head. Maybe gossip was a bad word. Rambling about people and events to which we can't relate would be better. Like when Lara apologized about rambling about some guy who wants to be her boyfreind. Of course, I should like to know more, in case I have to get my stick out of my closet...

 Above quote is from an interview with the author of I am the Cheese and its a great book and i just think that sounded cool and I want to read all of this other books. Tell me if they're good if you've read any. Sorry for all of the 'and's and stuff I'm kinda tired. I havent posted in a while because Marten ish always on so this might be a little long and boring. Alrighty then, the whole Larry thing started because Thomas didn't want to be called Tommy and he said that if i called him Tommy then he would call me Larry just to bug me but it doesn't bug me too much so I'm trying to get my other friends to call me Larry as well but they either forget or they just don't want to for some reason. =p So far only Pixy calls me that but i think its because he wants to be my boyfriend. wohoo im rambling!! Is it just FCV or do all band rooms smell like socks and old Saltine crackers? I seem to be the only person who gets a little screwed up in the head after jazz band but its probably because everyone else is used to it. I now regret not trading my bass guitar in for the mushroom shaped one. It was really pretty and i could've traded my Westone for it but I didn't so now I want it but I have to wait until next year to trade. BTW whats wrong with gossip?!?! Some gosip can be good gossip! Most everything I say is gossip anyways... (sry for all the 'I's I didn't capitalize in the haste of writing this post) SQuEE! what are we revolting against my brother for? he could take us all off the member list and we wouldnt be able to post anymore...

 Fighting makes me sad. I wish my friends would be nice to each other. It's also kinda sad that in all this turmoil my actual problems are being ignored. But, then again, this is a blog not an AA meeting, and I get the feeling nobody liked Claire anyway. I don't know what else to say. It hurts to come looking for support and instead find your friends cursing at each other about stupid stuff. And Now, Mtto4* Marten: sorry about Claire I think ? btw, I don't appreciate cursing at all. I respect your right to use it when you deem it necessary, but keep in mind that I'm opposed to it. Sophia: There are other guys!?!? Thomas: LC's always been nice to us, in a we're very proud of you but you won't beat us sort of way, so you can see why beating you would be nice. Nathan: Maybe you were being a jerk, but I enjoyed the biting sarcastic way you went about it *Mtto# only includes people who have posted since my last post.

 I still this you're being asses as much as I am. But I don't want this to be what this blog thing is about, so I'm going to try and comply with what you're saying. With the party tomorrow and everything, I don't want us to be on bad terms. That doesn't mean I'm agreeing with you. It just means I'll try and keep the 'gossip' as you call it down, and we'll end this whole argument. Cause if this isn't fun, theres no point. A few other notes: The spell bowl people: I didn't know any of them either. All I know about them is that they had their names on the list but didn't sign up. I was complaining about lack of commitment in general. I didn't post the dream here because it was all about people you guys don't know. I'm serious there, I didn't think it would interest you. Believe it or not, most of what I've said is stuff I've thought would interest you, I mean, if you told me about similar problems I would genuinely be interested, whether I knew the people or not. That's why it made me so mad. Anyway, it's over now. Back to our regularly scheduled sillyness. SQEE!

 Nathan, you really were being an ass there. That was uncalled for. And really stupid. You know what Marten and I meant...and I thought your story about your loveseat was quite entertaining. lol just kidding...but it reminds me of a little couch I had when I was younger...it was blue and you could pull off the seat and it was a toy box!!! it was the coolest thing ever!!! I loved it! My dad bought it for me...but the fact that my butt got too big for it, plus the fact that I didn't play with toys anymore caused me to sell it. Memories. Anyways, back to whatever. I just want to read interesting stuff...not stuff about these girls you like who I don't even know. You know? I mean...I could write about all the guys I flirt with in a day...and you wouldn't know half of them. So would you really want to read that? I didn't think so. So...there. lol see you tomorrow! SQUEE!

 ::Come to think of it, Marten, so is the History you're so fond of.:: Ok Nate, what the Fuck? Thats right, youve been enough of an ass to get me to curse on a fucking blog. What the hell are you talking about, this history im so fond of? Thomas is the history buff, Im just a hereditary reinactor! I never thought id get this bull shit from you of all people. ::Also, this all comes back to what I said at the Socrates Cafe about how individuals are defined by society and to deny that society is to deny a part of yourself. Therefore, "gossip" as you call it is actually and important form of self-examination, studying onesself by ones relationships with others. Viewed in this light, it's an incredibly high brow form of communication, moreso than you're piddly rants.:: Gossip isnt a form of self examination, its a form of examining others. Besides, Im really only complaining about solve..problem..maria, And sound of music(a bloody list) the stuff in all that jazz would be funny in moderation, I thought the rating with decimals and everything was funny. your making this a bigger deal than it is. SQEE!

 :: prompting Dad (I mention him despite that he's another person, please don't interpret this as 'gossip'):: Nate : Your making an ass of yourself. We all know your dad. but in your post, how do you solve a problem like maria, You just went on about things that had no relevance to anything. we dont know amanda, drew, jane, katherine, and some other people we dont know. Well, we might know katherine, but thats beside the point! I don't mind you talking about speech meets, or spell bowl, or whatever, but when the whole thing is described in great detail, It gets rather boring, especially when you talk and complain about people who, to the perception of the majority of the blog, don't exist! Why don't you post your dream here? If it was interesting.... Thomas: Its not censorship. Its editing. No seriously though, I'm not deleting anything he writes, I'm just complaining about the boring stuff he writes about people unknown. There is a difference. Some on, read some of those old posts, do you want more like that? The time one, that was interesting. Sophia: thanks for the support Jonah: sorry about claire, I think. A response to the second attack right now would make the post too long

 Sophia supporting Censorship... Didn't see that one coming. Anywho, Jonah ideally we have a one two finish, but we shall see how this shapes up. I hope we beat LN, because I hope that we will beat every band. To Jonah: Glad Claire coming won't be too awkward for you. You know what would be fun? One day where the United States was just a massive anarchy. Would be interesting to see how things would play out. I shall see you all thursday at six. SQEE!

 Can't we all just get along? Well, I broke up with Claire today. The break-up doesn't bother me too much; I saw it coming a long time ago, and I did, after all, break it off. What gets me is her reaction. I was putting it off because of my fear that she'd be angry or sad, but what she did was much worse. She smiled, said ok, and was completely unbothered by it. In fact she almost seemed relieved. It doesn't do much for my ego, and it confirms my belief that the whole relationship was meaningless. What a waste of a chunk of my life. Well, at least people like Kiel can't say I've never had a girlfriend (or for that matter never been to State). I hope we beat LC just so I can rub it in his face. That would be rich. No time for Mtto5 today, too close to last time. Consider the first line of my post my message to everyone. To Thomas's I add: I was kinda kidding, but whatever. Btw, this doesn't mean Claire won't be there on Thursday. We "broke up amicably."

 Just to keep this from degrading into a warzone, I'm going to agree not to mention any other people in my blog whatsoever. Unfortunately, this limits my choice of topic somewhat. I think I'll talk about one of my favorite inanimate objects: My useless couch. (Technically, it's actually a 'loveseat', but I hesitate to say that, lest my mention of love be interpreted as a complaint that I don't have a girlfriend and hence be percieved of as 'gossip') It's made of leather and it has a massive gash in it. I ripped it myself, several years ago, prompting Dad (I mention him despite that he's another person, please don't interpret this as 'gossip') to want to throw it away, but I convinced him to let me put it in my room. I have since not sat on it once. This pointless, boring story is exactly what it sounds like, and is typical of how interesting something can be when it contains no people. But, I wouldn't want you to think of it as 'gossip'. I'd be interested to see your choice of literature. Pretty much every book I've read and every movie I've seen has contained people you don't know, so I think you'd consider it pretty boring. Shakespeare? Terry Pratchett? Star Wars? Bunch of 'gossip'. Come to think of it, Marten, so is the History you're so fond of. I don't know anyone who lived back then, do you? By your definition, wouldn't that make it 'gossip'? By the way, I'm gonna need you're guy's help with an Etymology project over fall break, anyone who can come. We're going to film a scene from Beowulf (an old English bit of 'gossip' about a guy you don't know) and dub it over in old English. I might decide to use a scene from an old movie though. I'll keep you posted. There are other interesting projects going on, many of which I think you'd want to hear about, but since they involve people you don't know, you'd just call them 'gossip'. SQEE!

 Yeah, well this is what I think of you. ::points to butt:: so hmph. I think society is crap and the same goes for your view. Just kidding. But at least gossip about people we know. Otherwise it truly is pointless. Cuz you're just talking to yourself. SQEE!

 Marten started the Blog, but only officially. It was my idea, and was actually started while I was over at his house. I'm as much responsible for having started it as he is. Also, this all comes back to what I said at the Socrates Cafe about how individuals are defined by society and to deny that society is to deny a part of yourself. Therefore, "gossip" as you call it is actually and important form of self-examination, studying onesself by ones relationships with others. Viewed in this light, it's an incredibly high brow form of communication, moreso than you're piddly rants. And don't go saying it's "more of a musical scene", and yes, there most likely will be a second attack at some point. SQEE!

 lol...kinda like the Shirelles *since that's how you SPELL it and everything* but also having a Marten-esque touch. I like it. In reference to the revolt against Marten -I'm with Marten on this one. He's the one who invited us onto this blog, so it's still officially his. He made it, so if he doesn't like what you're posting then you need to make another blog for those posts. Talk about interesting stuff. Like how hot I am. :-) Anyways, I got all my money stolen today. I think it happened before 3rd block. I'm so sad, that was all the money I'd saved up...$49. lol, that's not even two allowances...so I just need to wait 2 weeks and I'll have more money than that, but, you know, it's the idea. Someone stole from me. That's so sad. Sorry...I'm traumatized. Anyways (again) Pre-show is fun. Marten, when is the fall play? lol...isn't it November 6, 7, and 8? Cuz I want to invite people to see my StArRiNg RoLe...lol...not...but I don't know when to tell them to come! Anyways (I need to stop saying that) SO EXCITED ABOUT THURSDAY!!!! SQUEE!

 Superb idea Jonah with the name scheme. Fight the POWER!! Yay state is this weekend. I am very excited. Should be a very interesting finish. Yay Moby Dick/Producers extrangvaganza Thursday. I am very excited. It should be an interesting finish. SQEE!

 You'll notice a change from the regular scheme today- my title, while still following the scheme- has nothing to do with the content. This is because what little content there is doesn't start with D. Oddly enough Nathan DOES sound like a prep. By contrast, you'll notice I haven't mentioned my girlfriend once on this blog. Actually that's kinda worrysome. If she's uninvolved enough with my life that I can neglect to mention her for 3 entries, including the one with the first letter of her name as the main letter, I probably don't spend enough time with her. I've been thinking about that a lot. I realize that I don't really love her, so I should probably break up with her. Then when I try to, I realize I really don't want to lose her, and I figure I must love her or atleast like her a lot. Kind of a vicious cycle, but I'm gonna have to figure it out one way or another. Anyway, we took the PSATs (pronounced: pissats) today. How boring. I had a scary Jolly Rancher experience and ate some cookies, and that's about it. Oh yeah, and I'm writing about the Regime at State for North Star, and I also designed a killer feature page on Halloween. I'm becoming quite the trendy designer, if I do say so myself. And Now, MTTO5 Thomas: Maybe you're name scheme could be that all your entries are called Welcome to Fred. It'd be funny. Nathan: Way to stand up for yourself! You can post whatever the shrell you want. Marten: Sorry I just used your word. Sophia: You know I'd be swooning if I didn't have a girlfriend. Lara: Welcome to the blog. i33nbS

 I had a really crazy dream last night. So I've recorded it in my urlLink dream log . I suggest you read it though, it's very odd. Marten, I'm sorry you don't like my topics, but this is my blog as much as anyone else's. I don't always like your topics either. Deal with it. (And I mean that in the nicest way.) On the plus side, according to my established behavioral patterns, I should be out of the swooning "I need a girlfriend" phase in a week or so, when I will brief enter into the "women are evil" phase and be back at good, old, apathetic me by mid-November. SQUEE!

 Censoring is bad! don't censor writing. SQEE!

 nate, your beginning to sound like a prep, only ur on spell bowl. Im serious though, the pointless gossip must stop. I mean, Its bad enough sophia talking about how hot she is and how good she smells, but atleast thats random and kinda funny. SQ(u)EE!

 Actually, there is no problem named Maria. The problems are Amanda, Anna, Zach, and Chris, the people who DIDN'T SHOW UP for spell bowl, causing us to have to FORFIET THREE WHOLE ROUNDS! Err.......... The worst part is, when ar last person finished in Round 7, we were in the lead! If we'd continued at our average score, we would've come in second. As it is, we came in Ninth, out of twelve, which isn't bad for a group that forfeited a third of the competition. It's just a little irksome. Seriously, if other people are depending on you, the least you can do is tell someone you can't be there in time to find a replacement. It's sickening. I'm never talking to Amanda again. This, combined with Romeo and Juliet, is just too much. Ok, what else. We got room assignments today for Branson. Kevin Wack, David Meyer, and Drew Klages. At the least, none of them have any serious hygiene problem. They're not bad people either. It'll be fun. Now, to swooning. Both Jane and Katherine have sisters a year apart from us who are both more attractive and more interesting then them. So why am I stuck in class with the bad ones? Oh well. At least I've got both Webbs. SQEE!

 You wanna know what I decided? I love deoderant. Lol, even though I don't think I spelled it right...I love smelling good. and not like B.O. lol. sorry...kinda random...but we switched seats in Law and the guy next to me doesn't wear any...so he's kinda smelly. Other than that he might have been kinda cute. Anyways. Enough about that. PRODUCERS THURSDAY!!!!! SQUEE!

 Ya i forgot my to actually put the title in my first post. See above title for it... Scheme is name of books. SQEE!

 Welcome to Fred This doesn't look like Fred, but oh well. Oh this is that blog thing that everyone has been harrassing me about. Anywho, my title scheme is book titles. Haha I have more options than you guys. Is squee that thing from the comic that Dylan likes? Sophia called me gay earlier. I resent that. Jonah down with Carmel! Nathan can write about what he wants! Marten we need to get a class together second semester or their shall be doom. Very boring lyceum. By the way Sophia, I will never stop swooning. SQEE!

 By the way Sophia, I will never stop swooning. SQEE!

Marten we need to get a class together second semester or their shall be doom. Very boring lyceum. SQEE!

 Marten-Awww, well, it's nice to know that at least SOMEONE is swooning over me. YOUR HAIR IS GONE?! YOU ACTUALLY CUT IT?!!!! EEEEEK!!!!!! Nathan-I totally recognized Timon's voice on the CD...I just didn't know that Nathan Lane was him!!! I thought it was Billy Crystal...doesn't he sound like that?! But, yeah, I recognized his voice and also Matthew Broderick's voice from when I saw The Music Man. That's a good musical, as well. Jonah-Congrats on State! And even though Marching Band IS a death cult, I'm still proud of you guys' beating Carmel. That's quite a feat! YAY! Nathan (again)- Sqee or whatever is a comic-thing...I've seen it once, so you're not that far behind. And I have to agree with Lara, it's spelled with a "u". SQUEE!

 Wow. Lots to say. First off, Sophia: you're safe. On the off chance any of us try to swoon over Lara, I think Marten would get mad. It's unlikely anyway. At any rate, I'm going to do all my swooning at my other blog, since thats what its for. Second, I've thought of two more broadway songs about time, so we can continue that discussion whenever you want to. Third, Sophia -- did you know that two voice actors on The Lion King have been in The Producers? Nathan Lane, who did the voice of Timon, played in the Movie, and Mathew Broderick, who played the adult Simba is in the revival. Just thought I'd throw that out there. On that note, did you know Zazu the annoying bird was played by Rowan Atkinson? Mr. Bean? I had no idea, myself. Fourth, Why are my posts always so much longer than everyone elses? You guys need to write more. Fifth, It's Walky is an incredibly well, written, well drawn web-comic, and I highly recommend it to anyone. It's nice to finally learn about Jasons past, and this plotline seems sure to provide action, romance, and maybe a little background info on the cheese. Plus Joe and Dina's Battleship is gonna be really cool. I hope they don't just forget about it. It's also nice to see a webcomic deal seriously with the issue of religion. Sixth, You're adding webcomics to my list of taboo topics now, aren't you? Seventh, Dune! The Musical! is coming right along, and I will show those of you who haven't already seen them the two sample songs at the party. Eighth, what the frell does SQEE mean? Is it some in joke I'm not in on? Wish me luck at Spell Bowl tomorrow! Bye, ya'll! SQEE!

 Sophia, we are swooning.(or at leats I am) We're just very good at not letting that sort of thing interfere with other stuff. As for Lara, your too young for socrates cafe, and Sophia will once again be the only girl on here if you don't explain your title. They have to have some kind of scheme. Don't forget to capitalize the first letters of your sentences, thats important to. About the only grammar related thing we really pay attention to here. I'd congradulate Jonah on state if I didn't despise the utter control of marching band, though at this point, drama is nearly as controlling. My hair is gone. Woe is me. SQ(u)EE!

 Marten, that is SO not cool! You let your sister on here?! lol not that I don't like you, Lar, it's just...I liked being the only girl on here!!! lol because then I could feel like all these guys are swooning over me...even if they are a bunch of geeks. lol, but, you know, nice, funny, good friend geeks. I should probably stop talking now. But, yeah!!! Let's rent The Producers!!! That's such a smart idea! I'm so glad I thought of it!!! lol...where's that from? The Lion King, maybe? Timon and Pumba? Something? lol I don't know...anyways. SQEE!

 can we all stop and talk about how pretty i am? lol, seriously, you guys are so weird for those who dont know me i am martens hot ^.~. 13 yr old sister, Lara, but you guys can call me Larry (ask Thomas to explain) (>-^.^- .....dude you guys spelled squee wrong -.-''...unless im wrong...of course SQEE!

 So much to talk about. First of all, I just realized that I am really, really sexy. Like, I-wanna-rip-his-clothes-off-right-this-instant sexy. I am too sexy for my shirt, and for that matter my shoes, socks and pants. I'm so hot, I could melt number 7 plastic. Actually not really, I just wanted to give Sophia an idea of what her comments would seem like to other people. Anyway, Socrates cafe is awesome, and Ms. Guthrie is so cool! If she weren't ten years older and already married, I would be in love with her. I I thrive off discussion, and coffee makes me hyper and the combination made it so I couldn't get to sleep until 1:30 (and I tried to wrestle Thomas's dog, Taz, who is on a permanent coffee high). Of course, it didn't help that Levi's friends were over watching Leeches! (the new worst movie ever) untill 1:00. We threw him a surprise party; it was lots of fun. Why not rent the Producers at the Moby Dick party? (Just thought I'd throw that out) In other news... WE"RE GOIN" TO STATE!!! WOOO!! WE BEAT CARMEL!!! YEAH!! It was really crazy after we found out, and everyone was hugging everyone else. This girl comes up and hugs me, then she's like "Hi, I'm Ashley." We'd never even met before! It was very funny. And now, messages to the other four. Thomas: Join the Blog! Nathan: Interesting fact about Christen Neary: Her older brother, Stephen Neary aka Parrot Boy, also drew the giant sandwhich which until recently adorned Levi's wall. Sophia: As far as the hair thing goes, you're so hot I never noticed your hair. Or your face. Or lower body. (j/k) Marten: Shrell is not my word, dram is. Shrell is all yours. SQEE!

 OMG...it's so freaky that you want to see The Producers. I totally just got that CD from my friend...he burned it for me and told me it was REALLY good. lol and it is...it's superb. It's hilarious!!! SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER!!! omg, you soooo need to see it. Anyway...Alice Laramore LOVES Pippin...so that's obviously a pretty good one. Anyway anyway, you thought I was hotter with long hair? Really? You're not the first guy to say that, actually...I just don't see it. I thought I was kinda too normal-looking back then. Sorry...we can stop talking about me and my hotness. I just realized a few hours ago that I was simply irrisistable (lol just kidding) and wanted to share it with the world!!! SQEE!

 Ha! Nate on spell bow. ::remembers the many games of ghost that went wrong::l SQEE!

 What happened to the interesting time topic? Not that i mind thinking of how hot Sophia is. Although, I wanna-screw-her hot is somewhat relative, depending on the guy. But, yes, Sophia, you are so hot it literally burns. Good thing i have quite a bit of self control. Ha! I knew nate only went to socrates cafe for the girls! but once again, i must complain about your topic. who cares what musicals you want to see? I mean, if you chose one, and talked about it, sure. But you just have a bloody list! What the shrell? I dont care if thats jonah's word SQEE!

 There are so many musicals I want to see. I've been browsing for information on "The Pajama Game" and I've come across a whole bunch of shows I'd never heard of that looked really good. I'm gonna start getting them out of the library, though. As soon as I have time. The list so far: Rent (just missed it -- Ergh!) The Last Five Years (Just ordered the soundtrack from Amazon) How to Succeed in Business without Really Trying Jeckyll and Hyde Blood Brothers The Civil War A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum The Producers Miss Saigon Little Shop of Horrors (Heard the Soundtrack -- Loved it) Pippin There are more, I just don't have time to list them right now Sophia: You're very unobservant. I personally thought you were hotter back when you had long hair (I know you hated yourself then, but that doesn't change it). I think something in between would be best for you though. About like mine (Styled differently, of course). But you're still really hot. You know who else is really hot? Christen Neary. Not gonna elaborate anymore on that here, though. One more thing: I'm now on the spell bowl team. We're doomed. SQEE!

 Lol, just wanted to let ya'll know...I'm really, really hot. Like...I-wanna-screw-her hot. But ya'll probably already knew that...I just am really excited because I hadn't really, honestly noticed it before. YAY! SQEE!

 That is kind of important. I've thought of time a lot. Not entirely like that, but it makes sense. But any one can percieve time like that. how would it affect how they interacted with people who percieved time linearly? I thought of time being percieved as longer or shorter in diferent circumstances. Like in a car. If you spend more than four hours in a moving vehicle, whenever you were got into the vehicle in the first place feels like yesterday. And what about days that feel like other days? like when thursday feels like monday, and sunday feels like wednesday.and you know how time flies when your having fun? It doesnt always do that, but it almost always slows down when your bored. SQEE!

 Oh my goodness...I have no idea what you just said Nathan. uhhhhh...SQEE!

 Since you say my comments are inane, I've decided to address an issue of the utmost importance. Something that's really been bothering me lately. Linear time makes no sense. Most of you have probably grown up with linear time, and don't know it any other way, so you'd probably be opposed to changing it. And I'm not suggesting everyone be aware of all points in time simultaneously. That would be mass chaos. What I'm suggesting is that it makes more sense for people to control their own personal time. Whether we want it to or not, the next thing to happen will happen next. Friday will come after Thursday. Two o'clock will come after one o'clock. Causes will have immediate effects. What if you had control over this. Imagine if you could decide that you'd be in SRT than in biology class. SRT would still come after biology, but you would perceive it as coming before. If you put something in your pocket in Biology class, it would still be there in SRT. It's just your perception of events that would change. You may complain this would cause paradoxes. Well, it would. But only if used irresponsibly. If overused it would get quite confusing. The other danger would be the thrill seeker who lived every fun moment immediately and then had only sorrow for the rest of his life. But, if used correctly, this ability would completely eliminate stress. Do you get any of this, or am I just rambling? If you do, that's great. If not, it just goes to prove that everything I think about that's not inane is insanely complicated. Bad puns excluded, of course.

 I hope our country falls really soon. I want to see Bush dead. I heart you guys, though. Ya'll are coming to Socrates' Cafe tomorrow, no? SQEE!

 But hey, atleast theres a second renaissance to look forward to! All characters portrayed in this blog are fictional. Any resemblance to a real person, living or dead is one hell of a coincidence.

 Yes jonah, I will add your link when im not lazy. haha ur in marching band. You are quitting next year, are you not? I tried to convince Kiel, but now hes gonna try out for section leader, or cult leader. poor soul. Your next point is a valid one. I made it on the post that never was, because my comp screwed up and deleted it. Hey, readers that I didnt send a link to, find someway to tell us ur reading it! Kinda locks, most blogs have a little spot for comments or notes. i think we should start an online socratic cafe even if no ones reading it. It will be fun. Hurray philosophy. nate, Ur topics are all gossipy, or about people. Other than the fact that we dont know these people, It is kind of the lowest form of conversational intelligence we love you too, Sophia. See? evil people can change over time. Don't diss ur own species so much. though thats a bit of an exageration, u werent evil, we were just ahead of our time. While I do approve of what our country is supposed to stand for, I can agree that weve become decadent and desesitized as a society, and the fact that we blame the media doesn't help. It only keeps us from doing anything about the real cause of the proble, and that is that kids are raising themselves. but i skipped a bunch in that, and it prolly doesnt make too much sense. I agree with schuck kinda, Were gonna fall like Rome soon. Prolly by the end of this century, if not quicker All characters portrayed in this blog are fictional. Any resemblence to a real person, living or dead is one hell of a coincidence.

 Well, that was Thursday. Oddly enough, it felt like a Friday. That happens sometimes, but I must be careful not to think tomorrow a Saturday, lest I miss school. Or, in this case, show up at 5:00. Yes, I'll be at my school at 5:00 on Saturday because the esteemed Low Brass captians have decided that just because we need to be at school at 7:00, it's no reason not to come two hopurs early for a Low Brass Breakfast. But it's oK, I can sleep on the bus. Speaking of marching band, today was the last rehearsal before regionals, and I think we're gonna make state. Unless somebody screws up. Which brings me to my next point. Or rather, doesn't bring me to my next point because it has nothing to do with marching band. And the point is: For whom are we writing this anyway? For each other, for ourselves, or for a theoretical audience? I need to know how much background to provide in an entry. Also, I think I'm going to shamelessly advertise my other blog, urlLink Tales from the Other Side of the Corndog. It's not a blog like this one, I have Compendium and urlLink What Kind of Day Has it Been? for that. Tales is a story blog, in which I'm writing an amusing story about toasters at the moment. However, other stories will follow. And now, messages to the other four. Thomas: JOIN THE BLOG! Nathan: I thought you weren't supposed to use this blog for ranting about your love life. Sophia: I never thought of you as any of those things, but then again I didn't really notice that you didn't want to be associated with us, so I was probably just naive and/or in denial. Marten: If you can't remember it it can't have been too important. Also, if you could add TftosotC (what an abbreviation!) to the links in the blog, that'd be cool. All characters portrayed in this blog are fictional. Any resemblence to a real person, living or dead is one hell of a coincidence. I'll say.

 Whoah. I'm exhausted. Choir concert today. I'm hesitant to say anything about it for fear of that sounding like the most important. We did well. I, on the other hand, made a complete ass of myself onstage. But apparently Mrs. Dingman is the only one who noticed. I don't know. One good thing about being in the prestigious top three choirs is you get to watch the Hip Street girls change clothes. Of course, their overall hotness level went down a notch when Danielle left, but it's still at, like, 9.6 out of 10. Which means Laura must be, like, a 22, as I realized I'd actually rather look at her fully clothed then watch them in their underwear. Kudos to Millenium, they improved dramatically since Thursday. They've still got a long way to go, though. But so do we all. Shiny red doesn't become me. Just had to say that, cause it's so true. I have a whole new respect for Lexi; she got my hair to stay back and up. The combination of that and the suit, of course, made me look like a colombian drug lord, but that's life. Lexi is also I have to say the most attractive African American girl I've ever met. Not to say black girls aren't attractive, just that it's better than saying "Fourth hottest girl". (By the way, number 3 is actually Mexican, so don't tell me I'm being racist). She's a senior, though, so just about as off-limits as Tiffany. Oh well. Thank you for your comments Soph, they made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside, but not fuzzy like when you eat mold. In the words of Pete Abrahms, "And that's it. I'm going back to bed."

 Lol...funny stuff. I love this name. HAHAHA!! Cuz it's like, Moby Dick...but they're "punk" so they wear Dickies. HAHAHA!!! FUNNY!!! Okay, maybe not. Oh well. Anyways...MOBY DICK PARTY!!! Rent isn't on video...so we're gonna watch Moby Dick! I'm so excited. Yayness. Anyways...hmmm...Marten and I had fun cleaning out paint buckets in stage tech, didn't we? Do you want to know what I think is highly ironic? The fact that when I knew you guys before...I thought you were so stupid. I thought you were incredibly dorky and I didn't want to be associated with you because that was how I was in 4th and 5th grade...but now, here I am, truly happy and having the best time with three of the coolest guys that I've known for the longest and never imagined being friends with. That was quite a long sentence. But anyway...I realize now that you guys were the awesome ones and I was the stupid, idiotic, moronic, immature (shall I continue?), butt-headed, (okay, blanking on more mean words I can use to describe my 4th/5th grade self) one. So I just wanted to say...I think...that you guys are the awesome-est and I'm just so happy that I finally got to know you and realized how incredible you are. So, I'm done with my testimony. Au revoir! All characters portrayed in this blog are fictional. Any resemblence to a real person, living or dead is one hell of a coincidence.

 I can dance! It takes me forever to learn, but I am now without a doubt not the worst dancer in the choir. I practiced with various combinations of Laura, Chad, Amy, and Megan today for a total of about two hours, and as a whole, we no longer look like crap. Millenium is a different story. If they don't improve by next year, I'm going to shoot myself or join band. Freshman aren't supposed to be perfect, but these guys are absurd. There is on e guy with any facial expression whatsoever. Problem is, he's the worst dancer of the lot. And that's saying a lot. Most of them are two or three beats behind, and their movements are either lazy and half-hearted or jerky and disconnected. Or both. Oh, and they're not singing either. Basically, if this is the future of the Lawrence North choir program, we're screwed. Oh, and by the way, I'm not putting the name of the show in the title anymore. It's too cluttered. I'll add it to the end of the post. If anyone wants to know, this one's from Songs for a New World. And I deleted the stupid signature line. It's tacky and blatantly untrue.

 BLAST IT! I just posted a really long and interesting post about stuff that i cant remember because i didnt expect to need to! All characters portrayed in this blog are fictional. Any resemblence to a real person, living or dead is one hell of a coincidence.

 Oh Marten, how we've missed you! lol...blog has been quite boring without you. Yet you disappoint us with a short post? Dear me, what on earth is wrong with you, boy? Sheesh! And I didn't even know you were leaving or anything? Goodness gracious. Anyways...great band name, eh? Thought of it last night while I was half-asleep. I thought it was quite an inspiration. lol cuz the initials would be DBW and you could say it like "Debuwah". lol Like a retarded Deborah. That's my mom's name! Isn't that the uber-peachiest? Okay...so maybe not. Anyway, I went to the JV football game today and we won, 42-0. lol go LC JV!! yay. All characters portrayed in this blog are fictional. Any resemblence to a real person, living or dead is one hell of a coincidence.

 Huzzah for jonah! Oy, Ive been out for a while. At mississinewa, if thats how you spell it. bloody reinactment, didnt get home till 11, took 4 hours to tear down. bloody, um, think of a word for people that go into a store after its officially closed. I dont have one. All characters portrayed in this blog are fictional. Any resemblence to a real person, living or dead is one hell of a coincidence.

 So I'm joining another blog. Don't expect to hear much from me. First order of business: My title names will start with the next letter of the alphabet each post, just for fun. Second: The "Is Sophia my girlfriend" report: No, but we are having a not-so-secret secret affair. Third: My romantic history: None of your dram business. By the way, I'm Jonah. All characters portrayed in this blog are fictional. Any resemblence to a real person, living or dead is one hell of a coincidence.

 Actually, Soph, I agree with you. That's why I move my page long romantic history urlLink here . Feel free to read it though. Laura, if by some bizarre chance you end up reading this, don't click that link, even if you already know everything that's in it. I refrained from reading your online diary when I found it. And Soph? At least you've "dated" someone. All characters portrayed in this blog are fictional. Any resemblence to a real person, living or dead is one hell of a coincidence.

 Sooo...lol I won't put my romantic history in here, it'd take too long and it'd be sooo stupid. I'm not really proud of all the guys I've "dated", although at the time I was quite proud. But now, it's just like...What was I thinking?? So anyway. Enough about that. I don't really know why I'm writing in here; there isn't really that much to write about. Cept I've got a little crush on a friend and I can't like him because I don't want to screw up our friendship. How much does that suck? lol cuz I think it sucks mucho. Anyways...au revoir! All characters portrayed in this blog are fictional. Any resemblence to a real person, living or dead is one hell of a coincidence.

 Well, My E-mail's finally up, so I can do this blog thing for real now. First off, Muppet Movies now count as musicals. So do Disney Movies. Because I said so. Second off, Sophia is not my girlfriend either, and while I was thinking about remedying that about a week ago, I decided against it. As my friend Glennie said, when you can't drive and you go to different schools, 20 minutes is a long distance relationship. She is really hot though. I don't have a girlfriend. Never have. Don't particularly want one either. More on that in a later post. My next post is gonna give you a little backgound on my romantic history. It'll help you understand my attitude towards girls in general, and Laura in particular, as I suspect she'll come up again. Plus it's a great read. I'll probably post it on Wednsday. Well, that's all for now. Word to all my homies! Peace! All characters portrayed in this blog are fictional. Any resemblence to a real person, living or dead is one hell of a coincidence.

 So. Thursday. Ha, and, no, I'm not Marten's girlfriend. Poor Marten. He wishes. Ha. Just kidding...Marten's super cool. If any other super-cool, majorly hot girls read this ((Thomas, you listening?!))...Marten's definitely worth crushing over!! Anyway, I went to a concert last night!! And moshing has developed some muscles in my legs that I didn't know existed! It's painful, yet exciting, because I just thought my legs were devoid of muscle. Haha. Anyway...great day today, and this band name's so super great! All characters portrayed in this blog are fictional. Any resemblence to a real person, living or dead is one hell of a coincidence.

 Huzzah! another thursday has gone by, and the Earth hasnt been blown up by aliens to build a bypass! and neither has my house. 42! it was a half day too, went unnaturally fast. i keep hearing about the apocalypse from Dillan, but it continuously fails to occur. i must be doing something right All characters portrayed in this blog are fictional. Any resemblence to a real person, living or dead is one hell of a coincidence.

 Yeah. Super hot way cool girl thats a friend. Never my super hot girlfriend. Poor marten, the only girls that really like him are lesbians from out of state. yeah, long story. Hey, isnt your sisters name nicole? wait, no, its ann. Wierd. My sisters friends name is erin, and when she calls its sounds like the says its ann, and her sisters name is nicole. to quote mrs. guthrie, "you make wierd connections, boy" All characters portrayed in this blog are fictional. Any resemblence to a real person, living or dead is one hell of a coincidence.

 Hey. I'm Sophia. Of course...my name-thing says my name's Nicole. That's a safety thing. Plus it's a "Don't-Even-Think-About-Spamming-Me" thing. You get the drift. Anyway, my titles are going to be totally rad band names...if they existed. Haha. Anyways, I'm Marten and Nathan's friend...their super-hot, way-cool friend who just happens to be a girl. Ha. I win. You lose. Go home and send Marten peanuts. All characters portrayed in this blog are fictional. Any resemblence to a real person, living or dead is one hell of a coincidence.

 ah, jeez, now even my dad yells at the tv when the footblah team is doing badly. I just dont see the point of some spectator sports. Especially racing. see the cars. see the cars go around in circles. second to that is baseball. some times there are cool catches, slides, but reall, its just a guy hitting a ball and running a square. excuse me, diamond. the weird thing is, my little sister enjoys watching me play video games. I dont mind either, if the player is good, and the game a cool design and graphics, like Zone of the Enders. this could be why one of my more favorible sports to eatch is tennis, for its similarity to pong. That could be a new revenue, competitive professional video gaming. I hope so, because its a definate net if none of my other career possibilities fall through.

 Air of mystery? more like air of flatulence. I mean, N! you sound like a James Bond fanatic. I mean, I liked Q, but its the wrong way to go for an air of mystery. You should've used some greek pseudonym like Demosthenes or something. Ok, enough posting things like a conversation, this is going to get boring, and I don't want to spend the night in a battle of wits, not online anywhy. How about a round or two of goldeneye on my old '64? ToLd you I i cold TYPE All characters portrayed in this blog are fictional. Any resemblence to a real person, living or dead is one hell of a coincidence.

 Thanks a lot. Now you've ruined my whole air of mystery. You know chicks dig an air of mystery. Now I need a new schtick (it's yiddish, and not at all what it sounds like). Oh well, I'll think of something. Oh my gosh I just thought of something. What if some weird creep finds this and steals my identity? All kinds of people are on the internet. Anyway, if that happens, I'm taking yours. Your identity, I mean. It's only fair, since you caused me to lose mine. I'll be Marten Dollinger, and you can be some weird internet creep. That'll teach you to reveal my secrets online. All characters portrayed in this blog are fictional. Any resemblence to a real person, living or dead is one hell of a coincidence.

 his names nathan comstock. And i can type, Im just lazy. besides, u know what i mean. All characters portrayed in this blog are fictional. Any resemblence to a real person, living or dead is one hell of a coincidence.

 I'm actually not Marten. I'm the other guy who write's for this blog, but my e-mail's down so I'm using his name for a while. You'll know it's me because I name my posts after songs from musicals (with the musical in parenthesis). Oh, and also, unlike him, I can type. You will know me simply as N. That's the actual first letter of my actual name, and I'm not telling you any more of it. Be happy you got that. More on Wednsday hopefully. With much tolerance, N All characters portrayed in this blog are fictional. Any resemblence to a real person, living or dead is one hell of a coincidence.

 Hey, um, I had to write something right now so I could set up this blog. I wasn't ready for this part yet, as evinced by the peanuts. Im serious about that ya know. Ive had a weird craving for peanuts. I think i might be pegnant. That would suck. I mean, did u ever see that episode of enterprise when tucker got pregnant cuz he touched that wierd blue stuff? and I dont even have a girls freind. watch out for typos by the way. Im offering a small bounty for them. All characters portrayed in this blog are fictional. Any resemblence to a real person, living or dead is one hell of a coincidence.

 Nurr, Michael. I can say "lol" as much as I'd like. You want me to prove it? Because I will! I bought a new CD! It's VEGGIETALES! Silly Songs With Larry! OMG, I love it so much! And there's a remix...that's absolutely FANTASTIC. It's so great. Sorry, I'm just so excited about my new children's CD. It's okay! I had Subway!

 I know that I post too much, but I still had stuff to say and didn't want to add to my previous post that was almost Tolstoy-Length. 1.) I italicize Claire because I happen to think that Claire is a hussy who isn't good enough for Jonah. I have no problem with Ashley though. She seems nice. Unlike Claire . 2.) I hate it when people say LOL. It just really annoys me. I think Sophia has said it in the past, and I'm not trying to tell her how to post but I think it is one of those phrases that can only be said by girls or gay men. Not that there's anything wrong with that... However this poses a quandary, cause Sophia's a girl Not that there's anything wrong with that... 3.) I think that Sufferage killed Chivalry. I also think that if you have the right to vote, serve in the army, and have equal rights, you can open your own damn door. Unless the guy arrives at the door first. If the girl arrives first it's not my problem. 4.) I have created forums. At this point, we really don't need them since no-one but us reads the blog. But I believe that discussion is good and that forums are better. So tell everyone you know. Tell your friends. Tell everyone who has an IQ over room temperature. And Send them to our site. Write it down for them. It doesn't matter, just get them here. And then get them urlLink here Have problems? Objections? Rude remarks? See your friendly comments page for details on getting those to me.

 Let's start off with this. Shut up Nathan. Caffeine's the only way to fly. It's my anti-real drug. And Tommy Schlamme was executive producer of The West Wing and Sports Night. And that is officially calling anyone named Thomas who I think I could beat up. A Thomas larger than me will remain Thomas. I have to admit that the mini JournalCon thing was fun. Jonah "Fun Stuff" Comstock and Marten "Grizzly Bear" Dollenger came over. I was constantly distracted by Marten's disturbing mustache and medium long hair. I think I may either be the first to rise up and say it or absolutely wrong, but Marten really looks bad with long hair. Or maybe he just looks bad all the time. In my opinion, if you're going to look bad, then you might as well look bad with a low maintenance haircut. He asked on one occasion sometime between the time where Marten attacked me and the time(s) Jonah was being vaguely gay "Why am I so Goddamn Poor?" My response? "Too much money on haircare products." I often had an urge to beat him over the head with a frozen butter braid and drag his limp unconcious body to Great Clips. If you are opposed to this, don't make post about it. Just use the comment buttons that I created. For the Glark to Marten's Sars. Another allusion you don't understand, courtesy of Michael Christie. Right now I'm listening to the credits music from Pirates of the Caribbean, the best [live action] movie of the summer. Disney actually threw in the live action comment in its DVD commercials. To distinguish it from their other best movie of the summer (and the most popular DVD of all time) Finding Nemo. Both of the movies were movies that the more I think about them, the more I like them. Erin - You watch Joan of Arcadia? That's so cool! I love that show! Were you here when I used "Anticlimatic means you're against the weather" in a convorsation. And speaking of which I have another one coming soon. I bandied around the idea of making Erin my mindless love-bot, but realized she would blow an artery if I actually did. Hopefully she will just find this hilarious and not hunt me down and kill me dead. As actors are wont to do. By the way, I have made up my mind that my improv skills will vastly improve if I add various phrases to my preparation. To date I have added the following "They got eaten by monkeys" and "Get Out. Now." That's all for now. If you had half as much fun reading this post than I had writing it, well I've had twice as much fun writing it than you have reading it. I'm Casey McCall, and you're watching Sports Night

 The Star Trek date went amazingly well. I got both Nana Visitor and Jason Carter - who I had no idea was going to be there- to sing to us. I also got an autograph and a death threat from Jason (Luckily for me, he didn't have a Minbari fighting pike with him at the time). I did not buy her a tribble, although she did buy a tribble for her mom. Ashley told me she likes me better than her birds, then Richard Biggs (B5's Dr. Franklin) asked me if she was my Lady. Anyway, with all that, we're together now. You can meet her at the speech meet on the tenth, or I might bring her to youth group sometime. Micheal: That only makes it funny when you're on Caffiene, which most of us aren't at the moment. Also, what the heck does Schlammes mean? Jonah: I have a statue of Emperor Palpatine. Would you like to borrow it? Oh, and cornblog is a stupid idea. Lara: Where can I get a copy of your book? And will you sign it?

 lol, ehh...it's 1:15 right now...so I don't think I'm gonna come. I might plan on coming to the JournalCon, though. That does sound a bit interesting. hehe. anyways...I'm going to go get beautified cuz my mom's paying. lol, I sound like such a barfy girl. Okay, I'm just going to stop. Have a good day, everyone! I don't like it. I don't like it at all.

 That, I have just discovered, is the tagline of Joan of Arcadia. In speaking of which, Michael, did you see the previews for next week's episode at the end last night? My commentary was... But she's OLD! ("She" being Mary Steenburgen.) I'm glad there are no sweeps in real life. I wouldn't be able to stand November, February, and May. Jonah: Tear down a statue of Emperor Palpatine. That will always work. I don't like it. I don't like it at all.

 Sofa - If with only one hour to go you can provide snacks and figure out where I live, than yes you can come. I really didn't anticipate this turning into a JournalCon though, people Jonah - Tommy! S c hlamme's! Mommy! is brilliant. As is Ma Hornsbeck. The first is funny 'cause of internal rhyme the latter because I was on massive amounts of caffeine when I wrote it I don't like it. I don't like it at all. Me Either. This Signatures Sucks!

 The title refers to the Blitzblog, and the confusion it surely raises among readers. It's also a fun bit of alliteration. So, first thing - the beginning of the conversation involved Michael commenting that I smelled weird, which is what 'point taken' was in reply to, as well as all of the shower stuff. Second, all formatting was lost in the posting, but when Michael says 'with Claire?' (7:40:49) it should read 'with Claire? ' folowing the unwritten rule that Michael cannot mention Claire's name without italics. Third- The correct terms for referring to people's mothers: Mine and Nathan's- Carol, Jonah's Mommy, or Ms. Hornbeck (Not Ma Comstock or any variant) Thomas's- Mrs. Fowler, Momas, or Mhomas (Not Tommy! Shlamme's! Mommy!) Michael's- Mrs. Christie, possibly Bonnie Fourth- There is no fourth item. Anyway, news from the other side of the corndog. I know how to use the template well enough to not only add links, but add a totally seperate item to the sidebar - Stories. This will be lots of fun when there's actually more than one. But Marten- this is proof that you should give me mod power so I can make cool, trendy stuff for our sidebar, or just add my blog to the links. Also, Who thinks I should change the name to 'Tales from the other side of the cornblog?' And Now, a long awaited Mtto8: Nathan: *snicker* Michael: Loved the West Wing comparisons. Btw, did you notice how I've been spelling your name correctly? Erin: Yay! The war is over. I feel like we should be tearing down a statue of someone. Lara: Welcome back, how's the book selling? Thomas: Actually, Spinachs do have livers. Atleast, they cloned one that does in a secret lab in Montana. Sophia: Michael's already mad enough at me for inviting two additional people, so it's his call. I don't like it. I don't like it at all. Well maybe a little. But it smells wierd.

 I wanna come! What are you guys doing? And am I invited? Ya'll are pretty humorous. lol, and if you're wondering...I'm listening to "Annie Get Your Gun" right now...that's what the band is from. Woo hoo, Annie and Frank! YEAH, BABY! I don't like it. I don't like it at all.

 For all who were not there, that was the beginning of our blitz blog. That is a subsection of this blog that we have in aim chat room. We will have one every so often. -You're living in a doom house.

 Ah, Lara's back. I liked the book tour thing. If you post again it has to have little static sound effects in it. that can be your compensation for not having a title scheme. Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog. Woof!

 Erin - I insist on getting you a gift certificate, at least. I have Christmas/JournalCon gifts for everybody in mind already and will work on getting them purchased. Lara - I'm sorry, I have to ask. What time is it in Johannesburg? 'Cause you must not know that Erin and I have buried the metaphorical hatchet. Jonah - I'm Casey McCall and this is Dan Rydell and you're watching Sports Night on CSC so stick around. Nathan - Aww... Nerds in love. Maybe you could propose to her. You would give her 'the one ring' as your wedding ring, then you would buy a spaceship and adopt blobby aliens of some kind and then get some pet tribbles.* Marten - Sorry your thanksgiving sucked. Mine didn't. Read about it here at What Kind of Day Has It Been. Or not. Depending on whether I'm sitting in the office updating or watching a rerun of the pilot of Joan of Arcadia. Probably the latter. Thomas - I think he died. Just my opinion. I heard his name at LC mentioned. They wanted him to come down to the dean's office for messages. Maybe his mom picked him up and they moved to Sri Lanka. Sophia - Refrigerator Box? Cool. Also regarding the webcomic comparison. I really don't know what you're talking about, so I'll put it in terms that I understand Marten's omnipotence and wisdom qualify him as Jed Bartlet. Erin is the tall attractive press secretary CJ Cregg. I am the lovable, but still annoying Deputy chief of staff Josh Lyman. Jonah is Sam Seaborn, Deputy Communications Director, whereas Nathan is Toby Ziegler, Communications Director. Oh and Sophia is Donna, who is Josh's assistant. Lara is Mandy, who was a major player in the beginning but was never heard from again. Thomas is the aging chief of staff Leo McGarry. Cut me out of the loop, will ya... *This was meant to be something said to provoke laughter, otherwise known as a joke. Just don't want Erin to think I be dissin' Nathan.* *This was also a joke, where I made a blatant attempt to state the obvious. Please don't hurt me.

 Sorry I haven't posted in so long you guys, but you know how it is with an older brother hogging the computer day in and day out...maybe you don't then. Welcome to the blog Michael and Erin! Stop fighting its buggering me. I don't know why but I don't feel too talkative right about now. What did I write anyways? Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog. Woof!

 I just asked Ashley to a Star Trek convention. I don't really know why, it just seemed like a good idea at the time. I saw the article in the paper, realized it was the same time as we were going to lunch and then.. it just sort of fell into place. In retrospect, it seems really crazy. I mean, she watches Star Trek, but she's not as big a fan as me. Still, she said yes. I hope it works out; there's no going back now. And that's it. I'm going back to bed.

 Thanks, Michael, but an end to hostilities is more than enough for me. I'm sorry for being so... well, bitchy. Okay, everybody, it's officially over. You can all come out of the bomb shelters now. (Group hug.) Marten: How can I stay mad at you for more than ten seconds? As Magrat Garlick herself would say: "Um." I hope everybody had a great Thanksgiving! I know I did. Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog. Woof!

 Erin, I sincerely apologize. I realized that on this day of thanksgiving that my remarks and behavior was inappropriate. I would like to bridge the gap between us by purchasing you two tickets to "One Man Star Wars" in Chicago. I can't provide lodging or transportion, but Expedia frequently has good deals. The show is playing at The Noble Fool theatre and is playing January 1st and 3rd. It is probably playing more in the future beyond that but Ticketmaster has no information. Provide dates, and if tickets are available they're yours.

 Of course, Nate's usual luck with girls would qualify him as Sam, so I guess Jonah is Torg. Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog. Woof!

 Nate, I think you would be the nerd who gets caught up in everything Sophia would be the insane beauty, Erin, would be, um, Queen Magrat. I know thats irrelevent. Erin: um, sorry, I figured once you had told him it would be alright, I thought it might help the situation in general if he knew exactly what the problem was. Woohoo! Nates got a date! I claim it as a personal victory that had nothing to do with me. See above exclamation! Jonah has updated the toaster story! Another personal victory. All points revert to me. I dont think Lara counts as a character in this little webcomic, as she no longer exists other than an odd gag about a book tour in a random location. Its thanksgiving, and I am in the last place I want to be, but its good anyway cuz Matt's good at painting models. He's working on Tau right now, only nathan or jonah will know what I mean, but who cares? Hey Thomas! Find something interesting and post about it! I want to see that catchy little title scheme again. Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog. Woof!

 Michael and Erin--I really hope you guys are finished because this fighting is getting very tiresome. So anyways, HAPPY THANKSGIVING everyone! OOOH!! AND GUESS WHAT!!! I have a refrigerator box in my bedroom now! I'm so excited!!! :D! Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog. Woof!

 One last thing to Michael: For one thing, you kept nagging about subject lines and the way people did their convorsations. As far as "widespread" goes, at the time Marten notified you of my "angry letter," Marten, Thomas, Sophia, and I think Nathan (I'm not sure about the others) were all getting fed up with it as well. They didn't put it in any form of print; the communication was strictly vocal. I'm tired now and I'm going to bed. Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog. Woof!

 JOSH: [comes out of his office] Victory is mine! Victory is mine! Great day in the morning people. Victory is mine! DONNA: Good morning, Josh. JOSH: I drink from the keg of glory, Donna. Bring me the finest muffins and bagels in all the land. DONNA: It’s gonna be an unbearable day. -The West Wing "Post Hoc, Propter Ergo Hoc." Heh Heh Heh...forgot about the "Quivering mass of indecision". Erin, Also just want to ask, where exactly did I tell you how to post on the blog. Just show me. And believe me, if I never exchange posts with you again, it won't be soon enough. And I'm "widespread desire for you to moderate your habits"? Erin, what are you talking about. Marten has no problem. Nor do Jonah, Nathan, Thomas (I don't think...), Sophia or Lara. So unless you have split personality I don't really see the "widespread desire". Done People. The Erin Problem is solved. Unless this post gives her (and then Marten) an anyerism I'll see y'all next week.

 By the way, everybody have a happy Thanksgiving! I'm going as far as McCordsville before the arduous journey to my grandmother's house, which is around the corner from mine. Also, Camelot at Footlite rocked. --- "Morgan le Fay! Can you hear me? Am I near your invisible castle?" Nathan: Yay for you! It seems you are certainly a lucky fellow. Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog. Woof!

 Ahem. Yes, Michael, I did read the whole thing. After being awed by your brilliant mockery of my typos (I don't know-- Are we in sixth grade?) and amazed by how full of yourself you really are, I have only a few things to say. I don't care what you say in your convorsations. I don't care what you want to make up about Rob Lowe and shoes. But it is neither your place nor your right to call me a "quivering mass of indecision" or to instruct me or anyone else as to correct posting on the blog. You don't seem to have taken to that treatment yourself. And I'm interested that you had to go to an outside source to find sufficient means of mocking me. While we're on that subject, Marten, I'm curious to know exactly why you chose to share a private email with someone else without my permission-- with, in fact, my having asked you not to. I'm sorry if it's getting mean, but you're the one who told me to start it. On a closing note, I apologize for the inconvenience to fellow bloggers. But I have no intention of moving this elsewhere, as I have no intention of being involved in it nearly so long as such a commitment would imply. I, for one, have better things to do with my time than trade insults on a website set aside for that purpose. I have no problem with both of us remaining on the blog so long as you know of the widespread desire for you to moderate your habits. If we are agreed in that regard, then let's all just move on. That's about all I have to say about that. Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog. Woof!

 Well, Marten, a pair of girls succeded where you failed: they have successfully gotten me over Laura. Heather was, of course, in on it. Plus, then I found the perfect actually attainable girl and asked her out. We have absolutely everything in common. She's even a Babylon 5 fan! What more could I want? It actually makes the break seem like a bad thing, just cause it's a time during which we wont see each other when we normally would. Her friends are always trying to get her a boyfriend, and now that she's found a guy who likes her without their help they won't leave us alone, so we're keeping it a secret at LN, just to spite them. There's my love life update, hope it doesn't bore you to much. Michael: Why were you calling Erin non-jewish? It seems like sort of a bizarre insult. Jonah: If this is a web-comic, I know Erin's the insane beauty(Oasis, Margaret, sort of Gwynn, Sal), Lara's the wishy-washy younger sister who only shows up occasionally (Min, Lilly, I know there are more), and Marten's the brilliant, but mysterious blonde (Riff, Fooker, Roger). So who's the hapless Nerd who gets caught up in everything? And that's it. I'm going back to bed.

 I really do not mean to post often, In fact "Enemies" has been my first post over one word in five days. I also move to take the Blog War into a seperate website. I've got an extra one, me and Erin will battle it out there and the winner shall return to Compendium victorious. And as anyone who has seen "Posse Comitatus" knows, Victorious in war shall be made Glorious in peace. Jonah - I really wish you would post more frequently as you would know that Marten and I have resolved the posting issue, in a calm and resolved manner. Yes, I know. You're all shocked. Michael used diplomatic resources to resove an issue rather than just slitting the offending persons throat. Erin - I wait for your reply. I hope you consider yourself a worthy opponant. I also hope you had the stomach to finish my post and did not just e-mail Marten in a "hissy-fit" of epic proportions. I also have to say, that quite frankly I don't give a damn if you are a senior. Just means you'll probably be gone next year anyway. Gratias Tibi Ago Domine will be up Friday Until next time, I'm Michael Christie, and your ring "The Enemy Within" on CoS. Stay tuned for comedy in the form of "Smack the Pony".

 Bug's have ears? Begun this Blog War has. Insert Fanfare. Is there anything else? If there is, It should be entertaining instead of just mean. Jonah's right about the whole webcomic thing. Michael's our own Bun-Bun, only no switch blade. Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog. Woof!

 You're both right. Michael, yes, you've singled out arrogance and meanness (but in a good natured way) as your niche on the blog. And, as every good webcomic teaches us, every group of good guys needs an ambiguously evil character. So, we put up with you and don't take offense. In fact we enjoy your presence. HOWEVER, the mean guy is not the main character, and many feel you are taking over the blog by posting too much. And you didn't preface this niche, so Erin, who doesn't know you, obviously thought you were just an asshole (pardon my crude slang). So, Micheal be your own person, but less often, and Erin, don't ake anything he says seriously. If he says something that really offends you, don't tell Marten, tell him. He'll probably apologize. Otherwise I'll beat him up. I've probably oversimplified, but that's my two cents. To everyone else who has dissappeared in the midst of all this, come back and do like always. If you don't want to become involved in a conflict, just ignore it and post normal stuff. The world needn't stop for Erin and Michael. Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog. Woof!

 Erin, My response is in two parts, you paranoid shiksta feminista. First the part where I mock you mercilessly, then the other part. Keep reading. If you can’t scroll down any farther, then close your eyes and think of England, sweetie. It gets better. Yeah, it's been a week or so and Michael Christie is still getting on my nerves. [A week? Honey, that’s like seconds in Michael Time! I’ve been getting on people’s nerves for years! It’s part of my incendiary charm. –Michael] I don't want to be negative, [Little Late for that, don’t you think? –Michael] but I hope you realize he is taking over your blog and I would like to know just who the hell he thinks he is. [Sultan of Neptune! –Michael] Well, I'm not sure if I was the only one who actually wrote angry letters or not. [Yeah, You really were –Michael] I don't think you would rat me out, [Rat me out? Are we in Sixth Grade? –Michael] but if you want to, let me do it. Let me turn myself in. [Guilty concience, huh? –Michael] In a public exhibition [I believe you mean ‘forum’, the phrase is ‘in a public forum’ –Michael] where I can at least tell him where he is welcome to go. [Chicago? The Ivory Coast?–Michael] He might enjoy his arrogance [Yeah…I really do –Michael], but others don't. [Actually, they kind of do too…Once again part of my incendiary charm. --Michael] Maybe it would help if I knew him in person, but I don't and he doesn't know me. [See below… -Michael] No matter how much he thinks he does and assumes he is welcome to be an ass to me. [I’m an ass to everybody. –Michael] I've had about enough of that for today. [Aww…Sad… --Michael] And he knows it was me anyhow. I know he knows. [Yep, absolutely correct –Michael] Perhaps it was the Huttese that gave me away. [Nope you were the only one who doesn’t know me and it’s common knowledge that to know me is to love me. Just ask Sophia. –Michael] It might as well be out in the open if he's going to ask you to reveal that information—not something a nice person would ask you to do, if you ask me— and if he's going to stay and wants to be hostile to somebody. [ Erin if you were truly offended by my conversations, then well, I think you are as dumb as most of the kids in my Biology class. Convorsations are meant to be taken lightly, and are not a real indication of a persons true being. My convorsations implied that you were bitchy and had a secret thing for Rob Lowe. I don’t actually think that you are bitchy or have a thing for Rob Lowe. I did not mean to offend you. I never knew that you were offended until I got Marten’s message. I pretty much knew it was you, because everyone else knows me, and knows that I’m obnoxious and sort of an ass sometimes, but other times I’m as cute as a little bug’s ear. You just need to realize that I have the maturity of a first grader, and that being sarcastic and mean to you, It just means I like you.

 lol, Go Erin!!! Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog. Woof!

 Michael: As I have been given the go-ahead, I'll save you the trouble of pulling this out of Marten. Yes, as you probably suspected, it was I who wrote the angry letters, though I was not the only one who was angry. Nonetheless, I will answer your particular challenge. And since I have bridged this gap, I may as well provide a translation to my earlier Huttese comment. It means, "The last fool who called me that got his antennae stuffed down his throat. Do you feel lucky, punk?" To that I will add: Kee baatu-baatu. (You bother me.) Kava doompa D'emperiolo stoopa. (You are a low-down Imperial fool.) What? You think it's easy being the Queen? Now, I don't know you, Michael, and you don't know me. But nobody around here appreciates your arrogance but you, and the minute Marten gently tried to inform you of this, you threw a little hissy fit. To put it briefly, I don't like the way you treat Marten, and I don't like the way you refer to others. You are free to "mock me mercilessly," as you put it, but know that I am willing to match you blow for blow, and that I frankly don't care much about what you have to say and thus have little concern for your lack of mercy. I hesitate to pull rank, but... Coughsophomorecough. In conclusion, I cite a quote referring, in case it is unclear, to a certain place over Slice way in Lancre, conveniently located between a Rock and a Hard Place: "Stuck it up your jumper, sir. Stick it, in fact, up your jumper. Named after Colonel Henri Jumper, I believe. A useful woolen garment akin to a light-weight sweater, sir, which, if I recall correctly, was named after Regimental Sergeant Major Sweat. That, sir, is where you may stick it." -Lieutenant Blouse, Monstrous Regiment by Terry Pratchett Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog. Woof!

 hmm...I like this signature. It's tonsatonsa better than that stupid superball one. I'm sad Michael left. Really. His overexcessive posting made it less obvious that I wasn't posting much. It was nice. kinda. lol. So I'm feeling kinda random. Bummer...I was gonna try my luck with a new conversation, but since Michael's gone...DANGIT!!! grrness. stupid men and their stupid inferiority complexes. Stupid, stupid, stupid! Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog. Woof!

 I have a new worst day ever story. My Day with Day. Most of you know Daniel, or at least have seen him. I'm gonna give you the short version I gave Sasha when she asked how the movie went.(slightly extended) We went the wrong way, we got back on track,we arrived half an hour late, we walked around trying to think of something to do, I let a hot girl tell me what to do so we nearly got killed by three thug-looking guys at The House,we decided to go home, the car broke down, the car started again, we got terribly lost (again) and ended up 28 miles out side the city, then we (finally) went home. And that's it. I'm going back to bed.

 Ok fine. I was wrong about the thomas thing. But still, your compendium to WKoDhiB post ratio was a bit unbalanced. And thats no reason to kick me off! youre over-reacting. And you were taking over the blog. Well, this kinda sucks. Im back to not having any contact whatsoever with Michael, and he hates me for it. I hope he doesn't turn me into another Chris Linday, or I wont even be able to read What Kind of Day has it Been. Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog. Woof!

 Read urlLink This . Unless the wording of that two word sentence is too arrogant or frequent for some of you. Just don't want anyone to send angry e-mails to anyone. Heavens Forfend... Also Marten, You are wrong. [ Thu Nov 13, 05:53:59 PM | Thomas Fowler ] Grand Nationals tomorrow and Saturday! Hurray! Welcome to the blog Michael i like your posts -You're living in a DOOM HOUSE!!!

 wow, I think that was my longest post ever. Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog. Woof!

 Well, My titles always have a tiny connection. You get to feel smart if you find it. I was cleaning my room yesterday, and it was practically an archaeological expedition, only without nazis and hot British women. There were a few bits of alien technology; I put them up for sale on Ebay. Anywho, among the artifacts, I found an old health assignment. It was letter I was supposed to deliver to someone who made a difference in our lives, and mine was full of synicism and young martenesque wit that brought a tear to my eye and laughter to my heart. Dear Andrew, In health we have to write to someone who had a big impact on our life, and i chose you. We're writing these things for recognition. You know, why they matter in our lives. We figure if more people knew that they were important, we would have less people committing suicide, or something. The main reason i chose you is because you are a loyal friend. No matter what I did, you would always try to help, or give me encouragement. Nothing I did would matter, you would always be my friend. I hope it can stay that way. I also chose you because when I get mad I can punch you in the stomach without hurting you... Kidding! Because of all of the above, I present you with this cheap blue ribbon. Remember, it's the thought that counts. I want you to give the other ribbon to someone who made a difference to you, then explain what the ribbon is for. If you don't, I'll have no choice but to not know about it. But please, don't make me resort to stupidity. Your friend, Marten Dollinger, your future lord and master, as soon as the world acknowleges his global control ha, good times. That was in seventh grade. Boy have I changed. mmmyep.... anywho, Michael: I have been getting angry letters about you. It seems like your taking over the blog. You need to calm down a bit, I've noticed that you don't post on WKoDhiB as often as you used to, and here I see atleast 2 of your posts between everyone elses. I think maybe you've already scared Thomas away, he hasn't posted since October. Maybe you can lower the post rate and arrogance level just a bit? Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog. Woof!

 Michael's titles always fit the title scheme, but generally have nothing to do with the post. That's why he never has trouble with his title scheme. Since he's so experienced at all this, I've decided to follow his lead. I'll still try to think up sensical titles when I can, but otherwise, total randomness! It's better than no title at all. Erin: Either one, since I know parodies are what you're best at. I started a "Look Down" parody about Marvin, but it just wasn't working at all, so I've moved on. Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog. Woof!

 I did too go to Romeo and Juliet. I heart iambic pentameter! Michael: Da beesga coo palyeeya pityee bo tenya go kaka juju hoopa. Dopa mee gusha, peedunkel? Nate: Song parodies or original songs? Which reminds me, I really need to finish my clonetrooper song. It's to the tune of "Lovely Ladies." They dance. :) "A clone army waiting for a fight/ Waiting with the helmets on that minimize our sight..." Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog. Woof!

 Well, I figured it out. Dune is still on the back burner, but first sci-fi musical can actually be something much easier. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: The Musical! A wild musical comedy where Zaphod Beeblebrox sings duets with himself. And I want all of you to help me write the hit songs! My own submission, The Paranoid Android Blues, will be up in a little while. This isn't a contest, just something I thought some of you would enjoy. Have some fun with it. And feel free to include creative reprises. Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog. Woof!

 I DO want to be Queen of the Penguins! And now, "The Lady of Shalott" by Alfred, Lord Tennyson. As a limerick. There once was a girl from Shalott Who fell in love with Lancelot At the end of the day In a barge down she lay And floated out to Camelot Yay! I am glad last week is over. Fanfiction recommendation of the week ("You might not care, but I do."): "A Moment in Time" a Star Wars fic on fanfiction.net by Kazzy. It's only 11 chapters long. It's about a not-dead Padme and her twins hiding from the Empire. Very moving and true to the characters, even when they don't do what you want them to. And to boot, it has the Naberries in it! They yell and give hugs! And make food, of course. You know what happened to the only person who ever left that house hungry... Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog. Woof!

 Sorry, guys. I've been meaning to update this, but i haven't had time online since my pseudoconvorsation. Randomness doesn't always just come to me when called. It hits me in the head knocks me silly. Really Silly. Sit Ubu, Sit. Good Dog. Woof!

 Ya'lls are frighteningly...frightening. And if I misspelled that...get over it. Mleh. Do I have to come up with a real conversation? CAn I forfeit? PPPLEEASE?! SPEECH MEET TOMORROW!!!!!!!! KIPPYYYY!!!!! If you didn't notice, I'm having trouble with typing. mleh. Yar! This Be a Superball! ~.... what's that guy's name, anyway?

 Micheal: Ahh! My name is misspelled in that speaker credit. Erni: No, that happened to everybody's. Now I'm a muppet. Joanh: Or the cab driver from "It's a Wonderful Life!" Micheal: I think you just did this to cover up for misspelling my name. Joanh: So what? I can do what I want. Micheal: And why is that Comstock boy? Joanh: Because I have powerful friends. Laurenec Fishburen: Hey my name looks cooler this way. Samule .L Jakcson: Mine is awful. But we're the powerful friends, anyway. Sopiha: Joanh, how do you know so many powerful Hollywood black men? Joanh: Well, interesting story... Martne: If you have time to tell this story, you have time to update the toaster story. Joanh: And I'll do that as soon as I... Hey, look over there! (Runs off) Htomas: Now that he's gone, can our names be normal. Ernei (the muppet): Yeah, I want my name back. Erni: Well, we don't seem to be able to fix this. Ernei: Well, I atleast want my rubber ducky back. Nathna: You've got to put down the ducky if you want to play the saxaphone. Htomas: Can't... take... ran..dom..ness. (faints) Betr: Hey Ernei, I can't find your-- Hey what's with our names? Samule: I don't know Bert, this place is weird. Let's go play some Badminton. Betr: Ok. Sopiha: I've got winner. Meanwhile, somewhere in the Congo. Lara: What a book tour this has been. The best thing I can say for it is that I snagged the short guy's rubber ducky. Hey look, a superball. Yar! This Be a Superball! ~.... what's that guy's name, anyway?

 Nathan: This is going to be the best convorsation ever! It's so random I gave it a totally random title! Hitler: La La la la la la la *frolick* Nathan: Quiet, you! Jonah: Machiavellian Macaroni and Cheese! Nathan: Huh? Marten: He's always saying random stuff like that, but it's not nearly as random as my signature lines. Laurence Fishburne: I beg to differ! Marten: Quiet, you! Michael: I'm more random. I quote "The West Wing" for no apparent reason. Thomas: Thomas is random. Nathan: Thomas, talking in the third person just isn't hip anymore Micheal: Like you are, ghetto boy! And why is my name spelled like that. Erin: Because it's his conversation and he can spell it however he wants, Mykelll. Oooh, Penguins! Miecell: That doesn't mean you can! And penguins aren't random anymore! Sophia: Actually, there are real penguins here. Penguins: Sophia, you're so sexy. Come be our queen. Erin: No fair! I wanna be penguin queen! Lara: Just popping in for my token appearance. Hitler: Dance with me! Lara: No! Sophia: I am the penguin queen. Fear Me. Nathan (ala Sam Eagle of the Muppets): YOU ARE ALL.... WEIRDOS! Michelle: Shut up, Comstock boy! Yeah, I edited that post like 6 times. You gotta problem with that?

 Little problem with that conversation, Micheal. It should read: Thomas: We need less girls Nathan: FEWER! We need FEWER girls! Girls are not a quantity! (attacks Thomas with Shovel) Yar! This Be a Superball! ~.... what's that guy's name, anyway?

 ((lol, Mexicans having conversations...this is the genius of my band. yes!)) Sophia: I'm so sexy. Bow to my sexiness. Nathan: ::bowing:: My Master, how may I be of service? Let me kiss those beautifully sculpted feet of yours. Marten: Oh come on, her feet aren't that sexy. Michael: I hate drama. Erin: Shut up, Michael, drama is the best of all. Oooh...penguins! Michael: What kind of penguins?! Where?! Lara: I've disappeared from the face of the earth. buzz crackle crackle. Mr. Hall: You can't say it's this big, you have to say it's THIS BIG! Sophia: ::attacking him with Larry's shovel:: DIE!!!!! Thomas: I'm still missing my leg, Mr. Hall!!! there I go. ha.

 Marten: Well, I guess I otta do one of those convorsation thingies Michael: Of all the dumb ways to start a conversation! Get out. Now. Erin:Shut up Michael. Its better than something about Rob Lowe, or shoe shopping. I hate shoes. There coarse and irritating Jonah: Its they're, not there. Your saying They Are. Mrs. Guthrie: Shush grammar boy, thats my job. And you did the same thing with Your. Its You're. You are a loser! nyeh! Sophia: Hi Mrs. Guthrie! I wish we could have you again instead of Mr. Hall. I hate him. He's a megasuperdooper poop head. mleh. Thomas:Death to Mr. Hall. He bit off my leg. Mr. Hall(in creepy stargate alien voice): SCHNARL! I am SATAN INCARNATE! Jump through my flaming hoops of HELL If you wish to stay in Lyceum! HAHAHA! Lara: Ha. Flaming Prince. Im going to ace is class. blah blah blah he comes to my locker sometimes blah blah jon blah blah isnt he cute? Im going to marry him blah. Jonah: you ran out of room! how could you do this before my part in your stupid convorsation? 3 people we dont know is too much. Orson Scott Card: I am the third. Ha! read my books. Yar! This Be a Superball! ~.... what's that guy's name, anyway?

 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHH HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!! You know that CD I've been complaining about. The one I ordered from Amazon three times, that I first ordered at the beginning of September? Well, guess what they just sent me? The vocal libretto book. Apparently I accidently ordered that instead last time I reordered the CD. ERRRRRRRRRR! God's Bread it makes me mad! My fingers itch! Yar! This Be a Superball! ~.... what's that guy's name, anyway?

 Math sucks. I've just figured out that if it weren't for math, my GPa would be a 3.6 something. I'm getting a D in Allgebra II now. I've never gotten a D on a report card and all be damned if I'm gonna start now. Well, the play is over. Sasha and I broke up, and I don't really care. It's hard to say which one of us ended it. I don't know what Randall's problem is. He was cast as Lord Montague and Lord Capulets understudy, but Capulet quit. We worked with him on his diction, but when he got out there it all disappeared. Jazz show Friday. Come see it. I have a duet with Heather Haywood. It will be fun. Hip street's performing too, and so is the Jazz band. Oh, and there's swing dancing. And jazz. Lot's of Jazz. Have I mentioned Jazz? Unfortunately, I already used All That Jazz. One of my IYC/Speech friends(Amanda, Soph, if you want to know) saw Levi's duo and asked me about the "cute guy with the goatee". That cracks me up. That last post had a title. I don't know what happened to it. Plus my title scheme is way harder than any of yours, so cut me some slack. Michael, as much as I enjoy your posts, you're making way too many. Try not to post three in a row. Marten, even if we'd had a tech crew, we wouldn't have had backdrops. Mrs. Means thinks they're tacky. Jonah, I think more profession's should do that. I'm going to make a movie about Janitors who fight evil blobs of Dirt. Yar! This Be a Superball! ~.... what's that guy's name, anyway? No it's not. it's Larry.

 What on earth are you talking about Jonah!?!!! About your last message?! And I think that you should make one of your movies be "Indiana Jonah and the Raiders of Nathan's Ark" so you can include your brother. hahahahahaa. We need more archeologists...let them think that all of them are incredibly hot and that the work is interesting...we might learn something! And I never said I wrote the Mr. T comparison!!! I agreed with Marten! Hmmm. Not sure yet about the JournalCon yet. Ya'll are still pretty strange. Do I have to do a conversation? Cuz it's gonna be super dooper pooper scooper random if I do. So mleh. Yar! This Be a Superball! ~.... what's that guy's name, anyway?

 Creepy. I could hear Mrs. Horrigan's voice in that convorsation. Jomah, I did do the Mr. T comparison. Those points belong to me. You have no settings tab because you lack administrative power. You need to level up before you can purchase that skill. Why do you need it, anyway? Michael's only got it because its complicated to teach me how to make links over aim. I'm making one of my next two posts my unofficial tenth post. The other one will have my convorsation. Yar! This Be a Superball! ~.... what's that guy's name, anyway?

 Micheal, what did Laurence say about textual montages? Anyway, these convorsations intrigue me. Are they a Michael thing, or are we allowed to try our hand? Cause it could be fun... Anyway, I've decided to make a series of movies: Indiana Jonah and the Raiders of Noah's Ark Indiana Jonah and the Temple of DOOMHOUSE and Indiana Jonah and the Second-to-Last Crusade We should do one for XL. Speaking of which, the media has desensitized the public to the boringness of archeology. Tomb Raider teaches us that it's a feild full of incredibly sexy women and fighting bad guys. Indiana Jones teaches us that it's exciting and dangerous. Stargate teaches us that every artifact you find is a piece of still working alien technology. This is what young people entering the field expect to find. What do they do when they find it's mostly just digging up odd-shaped rocks and guessing what they used to be? I think someone needs to make a film and/or video game about real archeology. As far as my title today goes, it's a line from Moby Dick the musical, unless the line is actually "My men may call it madness." Either way, this one works for me. And Now MttO6 Michael: Either date works for me, I think. Also, it's Sluggy Freelance Marten: I have no settings tab. Find out why. Thomas: Congrats on GrandNats. Nate: Good work on the play. Erin: Ooh, it is a penguin Soph: You still haven't answer my last message! Also, the Mr. T comparison was very funny. You get points. Yar! This Be a Superball! \/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\;O ~.... what's that guy's name, anyway?--> O+ It's Bob

 Hey guys! Fixed my name so ya'll could figure it out. lol. Okay, I feel kinda bad about saying this, but, ROMEO AND JULIET WAS THE FUNNIEST PLAY I'VE SEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!!! Watching Daniel Day as Mercutio...oh my goodness, I had no idea that he was supposed to be so flamboyantly gay! I'm glad Daniel brought it to my attention. Nathan, you were really funny as the old man! Never really figured out who you were supposed to be...but you cracked me up nonetheless! And as Friar Lawrence, you were great. I'm really proud that you could memorize those lines...lol I have enough trouble memorizing NORMAL English, let alone OLDE ENGLISH! Haha, Lord Capulet was the funniest. Whenever he'd talk...I'd lean over to Kelly and be like..."Did you understand anything he just said?" And she'd be like, "I have no idea." lol cuz it sounded like all he was saying ::add lots of dramatic inflections, yet still sounding like a drill sargeant:: "blebleblehblehblehblehbleh." I really thought he should be a drill sargeant...he'd be good at that. Shoot, is it spelled sergeant? I'm confused. And completely exhausted. OOOOOOOO GUESS WHO PLACED IN BOTH HER SPEECH ROUNDS TODAY!!!! I bet you'll NEVER EVER IN A MILLION YEARS GUESS!!!!!!! Well, actually, Nathan will...cuz he was there...yay speech! So I'll just tell you. ME!!! I PLACED 10TH IN PROSE AND 4TH IN OI!!! WOOOOOOOOOOOO!!! Okay, that's enough excitement for this issue of Sofa's insane slap-happy hour, please stay tuned for the next episode!

 A...buh? I'm confused. Oh, well. Ooh... penguin! Yar! This Be a Superball! ~.... what's that guy's name, anyway?

 I would rather like to know what happened to the titles there. Technical difficulty? Its just those two. Michael, you would have enjoyed Romeo and Julliett one way or another. Daniel Day was incredible as Mercutio. Everything else was fun to make fun of. No offense to nate, mostly it was the tech that made me laugh, and lord capulet's porky-like speech. And at one point he reminded me of Mr. T. i pitty the foo who dont marry paris on thursday As for JournalCon, either date is fine for me, unless one of them is the Chicago trip with Thomas. I dont like lemon poppyseed. I demand blueberry. I think we should watch old batman movies with Adam West. It makes me laugh. Erin: Nicole is an alias. That's Sophia. Yar! This Be a Superball! ~.... what's that guy's name, anyway?

 Does Michael not know she's in the blog? Is she not in it anymore? Am I in a parallel realitly where she no longer exists? (Come to think of it, I didn't see her after the play with the rest of the Dollingers.) If the latter is the case, and you all say "Lara Who!?!" then the answer is "Never mind, she doesn't exist here." Anyway, We made Grand Nats Semis. Unfortunately, we have the first draw and must be at school at 5:00, so I think I'm going to bed. A few select messages tonight, with no bolding. Soph: Michael's already the funniest, so soon after the extravaganza!?! Jeez! Michael: Thomas has the best title scheme ever. Don't be dissin it. Thomas: When you're living in a DOOM HOUSE at the end of the millenium, You're what you own. Discuss. Yar! This Be a Superball!... Or Be it!?!? ~.... what's that guy's name, anyway?... Or Is It? Dum dum dum

 That quote from Wyrd Sisters in honor of Romeo and Juliet, which I am going to see tonight. Break a leg. Nate, I look forward to seeing you in tights. (I think it's possible that I have seen too many of my male friends in tights, what with Marten in the talent show last year and Levi's Cpt. Character.) But geez-- you were home at 8:47? That's not a proper Hell Week! I want to borrow My Ishmael when you're done if I may. Nicole- yes, I will never forget me dancing in my slip and make-up to Chicago in the dressing room, either. :) That was probably one of my favorite parts of the whole play because, well, how often do we get to do that in real life? hehe... Next week I'm going to figure out the deal with my title scheme. Be patient with me till then. In other news, I got a college application turned in this week! Go me! Yar! This Be a Superball! ~.... what's that guy's name, anyway?

 It's true, Nathan. The grass is always greener on the other side ::insert witty quip here::. I'm too lazy to think of a worthy witty quip, so you get to do it yourselves. Yay. If I misspell stuff, it's because I can't see because I'm not wearing my glasses, so you are forewarned. Or maybe I'm just too lazy to press backspace. Anyways...don'e really know what I was going to say now that I've gotten this far. Michael, you are the funniest person on this blog. I really enjoy your posts. Haha! ::insert witty signature here::

 Great example of the grass being greener on the other side: When I couldn't get a girlfriend, it was like my one goal in life. Now that I have one, I really want to not have one. Or have one who I actually see on a regular basis. Unfortunately, I can't bare to have her mad at me during the show, so I have to wait on that. Michael, at least you do improv. Mrs. Britton hates it. She won't do any, at all. And choosing your own monologue isn't all it's cracked up to be, especially since the character has to be close to our own age and the same sex. I'm doing Peter Wiggin from Ender's Game, btw. I like being sadistic and manipulative. Yar! This Be a Superball! ~.... what's that guy's name, anyway?

 Grand Nationals tomorrow and Saturday! Hurray! Welcome to the blog Michael i like your posts -You're living in a DOOM HOUSE!!!

 Well, it's the aptly named Hell week. Having a girlfriend their made it a little better, but she's gotten kind of weird lately and she flirts with Daniel too much. My time on stage is too scattered. I don't have long blocks of time offstage. The good thing is I only have to wear tights for two scenes. They're not comfy. On a totally different note, I highly encourage you to read Ishmael by Daniel Quinn. I cannot stress enough how important I think it is that everyone read this book. I'm working on the sequel (parallel novel) and it's not bad, but the first is just overwhelming, and totally defies description. Read it, then you'll know why. That'll also explain what the title of this post means. Yar! This Be a Superball! ~.... what's that guy's name, anyway?

 Michael! You could've just told me it was Morpheus! That IS Morpheus...right? I think? lol shoot...now I'm not sure. dangit! Yar! This Be a Superball! ~.... what's that guy's name, anyway?

 I don't really forget; wouldn't YOU all want to listen to a band with this title?! I know I sure would! Michael -Oh my goodness, boy, you are really funny. I just thought you were a weirdo before...now I realize that you're a FUNNY weirdo! WELCOME TO THE CLUB!!! (the funny weirdo club and the blog club) ooh, do you wanna know what would be so cool?! If we started a club at school for all the people in this blog (cept the Comstocks, of course, unless they want to get bussed over from LN during random SRTs). I don't know what we'd do exactly...but it'd still be fun! Erin -lol I will never forget you dancing in your slip and make-up in the dresing room to that exact song (Chicago-title-entry). And I super-hate days where I would be perfectly content dropping dead. Marten -You're worried about me "going out" with Larry? Lol, the "quotes" are because I still think the phrase "going out" belongs back in 6th grade...but whatever. lol, well, who's to say I didn't start coming to the scene shop to chill with you and Katy and Lauren and such? It might not have been because I'm "dating" Larry. (lol, trying to find a word that works for us) Unfortunately, that is part of the reason why I did end up hanging out there...but I really like it! You guys are pretty cool! And what the heck is with this pessimistic foreshadowing? lol...well...maybe not foreshadowing...but you get my idea. Nathan -Don't worry about the eating contest...I'm in a beauty pageant in my diary on TOD. lol, so you're definitely not the most far gone of us all. :D hmmm...trying to think of a good signature. Not working!

 Hello, Michael. You know, in real life I'm not as "bitchy" as you seem to think May is... Welcome aboard. Yar! This Be a Superball! ~.... what's that guy's name, anyway?

 Blast you Erin! 1 minute and 9 seconds. That was all it took for you to get between my posts! I thought i'd have 2 in a row Yar! This Be a Superball! ~.... what's that guy's name, anyway?

 ladida. I felt like posting today. Not sure what about, but o well. Im administrator, I will do as I please. What exactly is butterfinger? I mean, I know its a candy bar, but from what does it derive its name? It doesnt taste like butter, or peanut butter. o well. I might use this title again when this post is archived but other wise forgotten. No one will ever know. Yar! This Be a Superball! ~.... what's that guy's name, anyway?

 Yay! Chicago quote! Well, I'm in a much better mood today, folks. Yesterday even Ewoks didn't make me happy. I'm trying to get my friend Marggy to stop hating Anakin Skywalker, so I'm chronicling the transition from Jake Lloyd to James Earl Jones, as it were. It's interesting. And now, a new feature: Erin's fanfiction recommendation of the week. You may never read it or even care, but I do. I recommend "The Winds of Change," a Star Wars fanfic by geo3 on fanfiction.net. It's 38 chapters long now, and very, very good. Yar! This Be a Superball! ~.... what's that guy's name, anyway?

 But woulnd it be funny if you did? I saw you rapping in my head. You had a gold watch and everything. Bling, whatever. Which reminds me, Michael has just recently been made aware of my use of british slang, and has coined the term Blang. I found this hilarious. Michael is funny. shout out to Michael. Jonah should spell his name right. Jonah, with your jubilation and your Konversions, one would think you'd have updated your toaster stories. Am I going to have to finish that for you? Your gonna lose readers. So Sophia is with Larry now? That would explain you showing up in the scene shop. I thought it was random coincidence. How come you didn't tell me? I didn't find out till you were talking to Katie in Physiology, Oh well. Still happy. Still worried about it. I feel like a content Arthur Dent, or Rincewind. SOmething is bound to go horribly wrong. Yar, This Be a Super Ball! ~.... what's that guy's name, anyway?

 Ever find yourself doing something you find really deplorable in other people? Yep, I was in an eating contest. At three and a half plates, I was tied for the second to lowest place, but it was still exciting. Golden Corral's the best place for it too. After that we went to Liz's and played Malarky, which I did slightly better at. I've graduated from Leprachaun to Ewok. Come on Friday, you'll see what I mean. (Especially if you saw Wizard of Oz). Oh, and new stuff at my other blog, if you want to know. SQ(u)EE!

 I would never rap. I don't care if you think I should get my own title scheme. My life sucks. Sorry for the negativity. It won't always be like this. SQ(u)EE!

 lol...try saying that 20 billion times fast!!!! HAHAHAHAHAHA! SOFA WINS!!!! Who the heck is Laurence Fishburn ANYWAY?! SQ(u)EE!

 Knote: Bekause of the alphabetikal kontinuity of this entry, kreative spellings are konstantly kalled upon Wow. I expected more komplaints. Thomas, Soph, and Marten liked it, Lara didn't komplain, and I don't even know if Erin read it. I'm still the center of attention, so I'm happy. However, just for fun, a list of komplaints I half expected to recieve. I reached ten posts a long time ago and I didn't get a Jubilee! Jubilee is a 25th anniversary anyway. Those are elephants!?! (Okay so I did get that) I never said/sung/rapped that! I would never rap, period. I got shafted because my speech was 90% static! When did Lara write a book? Like you know Laurence Fishburne. Ha! Diddo for J-Lo. and, last but not least, Laurence didn't say "Sip Responsibly" once! Luckily you didn't komplain so I don't have to answer those. Anyway, great fun all around and now back to regularly scheduled entries. And Now Mfto7 (Yep, it says 7) Marten: I assume the "most" in "most of that is pretty klose to what would happen if Laurence Fishburne interviewed us" refers to the rap. Soph: I think you write your poetry better than I do. Nathan: It's more a live elephant koncept. Thomas: It wasn't really that random. You knew it was koming. Lara: You have to make the celebration yourself, y'know. It ain't easy. And the doomspork is used to eat souls. Erin: Welcome to the blog. Good job on the play. I don't think you should share title schemes, get your own ASAP:) Laurence: Thanks for hosting the show buddy, I owe you one. SKWEE!

 Sigh. I am depressed because the play is over and I miss May and everybody. (Yeah, they're not real. So bite me.) And there has been a ridiculous stress explosion in my life. Ewok, ewok, ewok... SQ(u)EE!

 If you get a tenth post celebration then I want an 11th post celebration. or maybe a first post from school party or something. Bell ringing. Bye! SQ(u)EE!

 wow. It's funny because most of that is pretty close to what would happen if Laurence Fishburne interviewed us for Jonah's post. SQ(u)EE!

 There's not much else to say. You're really weird. Are those supposed to be elephants? I could make a better text elephant with my eyes closed. _ ___ _ ( ( * *) ) \_\ /_/ !=! !_! To be fair, my eyes were opened, but still, you could have put a little more thought into it. SQ(u)EE! Never mind. Stupid Blogger. WHy can't you let me keep my spaces?

 Wow. Jonah...that was...wow. Erin's rap was the best, I must say. lol my poem was pretty cool, too. Yeah baby. lol...happy J post! SQ(u)EE!

 Wow Jonah just wow... That surpasses Thomas random by a long shot. Got 3rd at Indy Regional beating Avon Huzzah! Life is hard on the homework front, so not much posting for Thomas. Yay halfday tuesday=Chinese food. DOOM HOUSE! SQ(u)EE!

 Celebrating 10 posts of Jonah! (Hosted by Laurence Fishburne!) AD= AD= AD= AD= ADs AD= AD= AD= AD= AD= AD= AD= ADs AD= AD= AD= AD= ^A line of live elephants, because any good celebration has live elephants. Laurence Fishburne: Hi, I'm Laurence Fishburne, and welcome to Jonah's Jovial, Jocular J-post Jubilee. I've been reading Jonah's posts since he began them a little less then a month ago, and they have had a profound influence on me. I spend so much time reading that blog, that I only did one take of each of the scenes in Matrix Revolutions. That's why it was so bad. Keanu Reeves: Also, I can't act! Laurence Fishburne: Anyway, that's why I decided to host this special. And Now, a montage of the best moments of Jonah's fabulous posts. So I'm joining another blog. Don't expect to hear much from me./For whom are we writing this anyway? For each other, for ourselves, or for a theoretical audience?/ I just realized that I am really, really sexy. Like, I-wanna-rip-his-clothes-off-right-this-instant sexy. I am too sexy for my shirt, and for that matter my shoes, socks and pants. I'm so hot, I could melt number 7 plastic./Thomas: Maybe you're name scheme could be that all your entries are called Welcome to Fred. It'd be funny./I was kinda kidding, but whatever./Fighting makes me sad/The moral of this post: Don't volunteer to do two stories in one weekend if you also have a page to design and the paper gets sent to press Tuesday!/But we were winners anyway, because we drink milk. In other news I'm wearing a birthday hat. Yay!/Huzzah! Doom Sporks for everyone! Laurence Fishburne: I guess Montages work better with something other than text! Next, Blog founder Marten Dollinger will say a few words. Marten: Nice work and stuff, I guess. Laurence Fishburne: And now, a musical presentation by fellow blogger Thomas, and his band The Fanny Pack Five. Thomas: (to the tune of a certian Weezer song.) His name is Jonah, he writes really good posts! He's not from Barcelona, but he makes a mean slice of toast! Come sit next to him, Pour yourself some Slim- Fast, like Granma made when you were on a diet Things were better then, you couldn't eat chicken, You gave up that trend when you didn't lose weight. This song is not going as planned, The lyrics suck and should be banned, The rhyming is bad when it exists at all, The resemblence to the original is small, The audience is standing up and leaving, The audience is standing up and leaving, The audience is standing up and gone, Yeah they're gone! (Really cool guitar riffs.) Laurence Fishburne: Well, now that the audience is gone, it's time for Jonah's brother Nathan to say a few words. (That didn't come out right.) Nathan: Jonah's posts have been a true inspiration to me. A few weeks ago, I was planning to develop an addiction to cough syrup or toad licking, because I couldn't take this cruel world anymore. Then, I got on the blog and read those beautiful words, "Interesting fact about Christen Neary: Her older brother, Stephen Neary aka Parrot Boy, also drew the giant sandwhich which until recently adorned Levi's wall." Suddenly, it made sense how wonderful this world is. I've been a staunch supporter ever since! Laurence Fishburne: Thanks Nate! Now a poem from blogger Sophia. Sophia Thanks Laurence. This is a poem I wrote for Jonah. It's called Ode to Jonah. Jonah is cool, Jonah is neat. If he were a food group, he would be meat. Jonah is sexy, Jonah is cute. He melts number 7 plastic fruit. Jonah writes losts of nifty posts, and according to Thomas makes good toast. Life without Jonah would be sad indeed, Like a yard all full of weeds. Laurence Fishburne: (crying) That was beautiful. Now a word from Jennifer Lopez. J-Lo: I don't know this Jonah guy, but I want to talk about what the letter J means to me. Without J, my name would be Ennifer Lopez. The shortening would be E-Lo, or possibly just Lo. Either way, I'm glad Jonah's decided to celebrate this letter. Laurence Fishburne: Now blog writer Erin will perform a freesyle rap. This doesn't sound good. Erin (dressed in baggy clothes and a backwards cap): Jonah is neat, he's a pretty swell guy, He's had 10 posts, that's more than nine. He knows Laurence Fishburne, and that's pretty rad, He draws people in like newspaper ad. This rap's pretty lousy, I won't say it's not, But hey, I made it up on the spot. So way to go Jonah, for 6 posts plus 4, Here's to the rest, to 16 more! Word. Laurence Fishburne: Now, a word from Micheal Christie, who introduced Jonah to blogging. Micheal Christie: Jonah's posts are awful. Originally, he wrote decent posts but now they're all fluff, randomness and meaningless titles. Although, it's nothing compared to the new Matrix. Laurence Fishburne was especially... Laurence Fishburne: That's enough of that. Our final writer, Lara, is in Seattle on a book tour, but she's with us via satellite. Lara, on staticy screen: Jonah bzzt crckle doom spork bzzz fizzle elephants zzt bzzizle 700 fizzz brzzle pop bzzz much. So, bzzz crckle fzzble a really good pie. Thanks Laurence. Laurence Fishburne: Well there you have it, bzzz crckle a really good pie. How better to describe Jonah then that. Until next time, I'm Laurence Fishburne, signing out.

 lol...there goes my Spanglesh again! HI ERIN! WELCOME TO THE BLOG! Just wanted to say that. Oh, and, also, today's show was hilarious...bunch of missed cues and other flubs. So fun. lol even though I wasn't watching, I just got to hear about it backstage. Fun. anyways...thanks again guys for coming...and, Erin, you kick monkeys! SQ(u)EE!

 Well, well. It finally has worked! Erin here, I finally got in this thing, so... here I am. Thanks to those who came to see the play-- it did have some great lines, the definitive one probably being "WHAT??" That's a cast joke... Marten is letting me share his topic of subject lines-- quotes from movies and books. That one is from Monstrous Regiment, the newest Terry Pratchett. And now I have to go, for the stage calls me home in about 45 minutes. SQ(u)EE!

 Hurray for show. Go to Michael's urlLink blog for a review. Lara, everyone knows kroger is on stirke. We read and or watch the news, or atleast channel one. and joe rants.

 First off, congratulations to Marten and Soph, the show was excellent. Now none of us will be able to stop quoting from it. He He ........ 2000 aeroplanes........he he. Overall, I've had a really amazing day, basically the polar opposite of Jonah's. First period a project I wasn't looking forward to presenting got postponed. Then in choir, I got a solo from an audition I thought I'd bombed(Laura and Heather got the others, by the way). In Theatre Arts we broke into work groups of four, except mine only contains two, and the other one is a really hot girl who I don't really know. In Allgebra II, I actually finished the midterm. I have absolutely no idea how I did on it, but finishing is a one up from the last test I took in that class. Zach Dzuba played Mandolin for us today. It was very amusing. He was borrowing it, but he's saving up to buy his own. Lara. Get. Title. Scheme. NOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SQ(u)EE!

 lol...huzzah for fanny packs!!! Anyways...GEEZ LARA...YOU'VE GOT ONE SERIOUS BOYFRIEND!!! OW OW!! haha. Anyways...SOPHIA IS IN THE PLAY, TOO!!! lol duh. You guys saw me with my super-hot lipstick. yayness. anyways...sorry for such a stupid post, just needed to comment on the play and Lara's boyfriend. haha. middle school love. so fun. SQ(u)EE!

 Its true, they are. I was at my friend's house and her parents were talking about it. Hurray!! I get a doomspork!....what does it do? One of my friends actually had a relationship for shorter than that.. It was only for 30 seconds but it was forced so it might not really count to you people. Her parents don't want her to date until after high school either. Which brings me to the fact that I have a boyfriend! No Marten you cannot hit him with your stick. He comes to my locker every morning and he walks me to my bus after school and thats almost the only time I get to see him, but oh well. SQ(u)EE!

 How many day hath past since my last post? Verily, I say it has been many, for mine post hast passed into the archives like flowers into winter's first snow. Alas, alas for me, for what shall I say now that I at last post? What news to report? Random bad things keep happening to me. Yesterday a saxophone mouthpiece hit me in the head, and I've still got a scab. Today I threw up for no apparent reason. I also had a random headache and tripped over a microphone cord somewhere in there. However, I'm still in surprisingly good spirits, possibly because there is no band practice today. Also, I'm going to see la obra de teatre de Erin y Marten. (I apologize for the language switch. When I can't think of an English word I use a spanish one.) I was thinking about asking a girl to go with me, like on a date, but I probably won't. And now an announcement. My next post will be my 10th post, and will have a J title. Since 10 is a milestone and J is the best letter in all the alphabet, it shall have to be an excellent extravaganza of a post. urlLink An amusing comic.(The beginning may not make much sense, but it's the last panel that's funny.) Instead of my normal ending section, I'll conclude with this. Huzzah! Doom Sporks for everyone!

 that venting is fine. It was detailed information of a love life i could write plays about, not needless gossip. clap for nate! mourn for nate! find nate a date! SQ(u)EE!

 Well, in the time since my last post I've had my first girlfriend, my first break-up, and the worlds shortest relationship in general. I was Sasha's first boyfriend too and apparently, her parents don't want her to date until she's out of high school. Stupid overprotective asian parents. So my first relationship lasts a day and odd hours. Wonderful. And I left the stupid Etymology project at school somewher and I have no idea where. I know you don't want to hear about my love life, but I need to vent to someone. I hope you don't mind to much. SQ(u)EE!

 (I can still post!!) =^.^= Should I look in the phone book for chiropracters or just have Famous Chiropracters as my title all the time? Marten: You forget a lot don't you..and why wouldn't I make a good minion?! I am very..umm.. miniony..? Minionish...?...I bet you just dont't want me telling mom about what you talk about to your friends. Whoever said all my posts were supposed to be funny...I'll cry if I get kicked off... Jonah: I want a spork of doom too. Sophia: Kubble Bubbles is a funny kitty! I wuvvles him so much! SQ(u)EE!

 Erin does so look like renee zelwegger! After all the people Ive pointed this out to, you're the first to disagree. 7 to 1. no points for nate. Just look at the squinty eyes, the slightly flatness of chest, and the wave in the hair! SQ(u)EE!

 OOOH! I remember that now. okay. lol. I'm listening to Ben Folds...omg, he is sooo the best singer ever. I love him so much. Just thought you all needed to know. If you care, his song, "The Luckiest" is the most romantic song I've ever heard in my life. woooooooooo. SQ(u)EE!

 Romeo and Juliet is officially screwed. I called for line eight times in the last scene today, six of them on the same monologue. I'm sure you guys are having hell of it to though. ABout eight of us are coming out to see you. I have mixed feelings about the crazy hot girl whose been all over me lately. On the one hand, she's hot and she's all over me. On the other hand, this is such a sudden change I fear she may be using me for something. Oh well. I'm still enjoying the hell out of it. I can't wait to see Camp! Ok, umm, Erin looks nothing like Renee Zwelleger, but it's really funny to imagine her doing those songs. Deanna was apparently mistaken when she told me Bob Barker was dead; in fact the man who had previously hosted The Price is Right before him passed away. Soph, it was right before you left, and you gave me a weird look and said, "okay...." SQ(u)EE!

 lol, Marten, your cat sounds so funny. ((I almost said "yummy" there...yikes!)) Anyways...Nathan...lol I didn't even know you tried to kiss me. I was totally not paying attention. Not sure if that's a good thing or bad thing...but whatever. GOOD LUCK WITH HELL WEEK, MARTEN! I hope everything goes well and you don't bite my head off in Stage Tech anymore. SQ(u)EE!

 Whims...yes, whims you get... Ubernifty speechifier... is that a william elhardt term? sorry will, i never spell your last name right. Hey, I can write my speech now! I know what I'm doing! Yippeee! I saw Chicago finally, repeat said exclamation. Does Erin Chandler not have a striking resemblance to Renee Zelwegger? Seriously, dye her hair blonde and make her less timid, and she looks just like her. dumb cat...chasing his tail again.... SQ(u)EE!

 Why weren't any of you at speech? It was really fun, even if I did only get 4 1/2 hours of sleep. I chickened out of talking to Christen and only exchanged a few pleasantries with her brother. Technically, we were competing in different catagories but I think we got the same number of sweeps points, since LN is really slipping and LC is on the rise. Oh, plus I got my bronze seal, which signifies my status as ubernifty speechifier. On the halloween party: I'm really tired. It was great to see Hannah again, though. Sorry I tried to kiss you, Soph, it's one of those sudden whims I get. Who was that Andrew guy? Does he go to LN or LC? I've never seen him before in my life. I ate too much. I'm going back to bed. SQ(u)EE!

 Were you gone because you fell down the chimney and landed on a flaming goose? And you lack the welcome to fred title I fell down the chimney onto a flaming goose!

 Merry Christmas to all! And all a good night! My triumphant return has happened. I have returned. I am no longer absent. I am here now. Now is the time to enstate the contest. Who can guess why i was absent for so long? There is really a good reason. Whoever guesses the closest to my reason at the designated time, will receive an all-expenses-paid brand new cookie! Have fun everybody! I fell down the chimney onto a flaming goose!

 Alternate ending to a Christmas Carol: Scrooge: You there! Boy! What day is it? Boy: Why, Its December 24th! Scrooge:... then there's still time to change!...Eh, Maybe tomorrow Scrooge:You there! Boy! What day is it? boy:Its the 26th of december! Scrooge: Oh shit... overslept... damn ghosts.. Scrooge:Oy what a night.. Boy! Now what day is it? different boy: Who, me? Scrooge: Yes! what day is it? boy: why, it would be the day after yesterday of course! Scrooge: And that is? boy: Yesterday? It was a Tuesday I think. Scrooge: Making today?... boy: Well, wednesday, sir! Scrooge: No, I mean, the date! boy: date? thats a small fruit that's grown in sub-tropical climates, but what does that have to do with anything? Scrooge: Bah! Humbug! you idiots aren't worth a lifestyle change! END! I fell down the chimney onto a flaming goose!

 Now it's my turn to say Merry Christmas, Life Day, Hogswatch, or whatever you celebrate. My dad's family is over at my house right now. That's eleven cousins, ladies and gentlemen, plus aunts and uncles. Fun! I almost got to see LOTR yesterday, but at the last minute, I didn't. So I'm probably seeing it next week. Marten-- other things that smell bad, if you're still thinking of doing that parody: we had wookiees and Governor Tarkin, but there's also A Tauntaun and The Inside of a Tauntaun. Enjoy yourself, everybody! That's about all I have to say. I fell down the chimney onto a flaming goose!

 Nurr. Sorry about the stupid title. Too lazy to think of a good one. Merry Christmas Eve everyone...hopefully you will have a completely uneventful Christmas. :D I guess I don't have as much to say as I thought. Oh well. Oh, and, Marten, I already do see a psychologist...actually, he's a psychiatrist, so I get meds, too! Yay! lol, Nathan, your little silly-thing at the end was the super-greatest. I love it. Yay! Yay!

 Merry Christmas or secular holiday of your choice, everyone! Sorry I haven't posted lately, but you wouldn't believe how busy I've been. Actually you probably would, but I don't feel like telling you all of it. Last night we watched The Pajama Game . Ugh... I'm not sure I even want to try out now. And, just like in Oklahoma! , the two best songs were left out of the movie, while plenty of awful and/or pointless ones were left in. Why can't our school do a good musical for once? It doesn't feel like Christmas eve, namely because I've been to busy with totally non-Christmas-related things to be anticipating it all that much. I haven't finished you guys's Christmas presents yet, either, so don't expect to get them any time near Christmas. Sorry. In other news, Return of The King ruled! Can't wait for the four and a half hour extended edition. Or five. I hope it's five. In other, other news, Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol rules! Like a bad lobster! Well, rotate my vertices and call me a trapezoid!

 Ha! A christmas title with only Ws! I've still got it! (X is Next, I may have to cheat) Anyways, Merry Christmas Eve and happy Winter Holiday to you non Christians. (If we have any; I don't think we do) I had a very weird dream last night. I became a techie for a scuba-cheerleading squad who traveled around the country in a van. They ended up switching to regular cheerleading and then acting because times evidentally got tough. Then, we were stopped in my hometown and I was taking a walk when I saw my dad at a magazine stand that said Comstock & Comstock & Comstock: Booksellers, Arcade Games, & Fun. I was all like "You started a business without me?" and we was like "Well, you had to run off and join the cheerleading squad." So I said, "Well, why Comstock & Comstock & Comstock instead of Comstock & Sons?" and he replied, "Well, If you'd been here you might have had a say in the naming process. That's about all I remember. Lord of the Rings was awesome. Particularly the Oliphants. Btw, Trebuchets are in this season, so buy one for your loved ones today. What better way to say I love you than a giant slingshot that shoots fire? Oh, also I have a girlfriend now, which marks the first time Nathan and I have both had girlfriends simultaneously. I don't think any of you know her, because she's a Craig person. For my new section, I have self referencing paper of the day, which is urlLink "This Is the Title of This Story, Which Is Also Found Several Times in the Story Itself" also, I encourage you to read "Self Reference, which is linked to at the bottom of "This is the Title" I fell down the chimney onto a flaming goose!

 Read the Review/Update. And the continuing convorsation.

 Sophia, I think you have a problem with the fact that nobody would mind. I think you should see a psychologist. You're too sexy for your mental health MICHAEL! STOP DOUBLE POSTING! I fell down the chimney onto a flaming goose!

 She's Back. Read the daily updates Wacky is filling your car's gas tank with 3-octane gasoline. Absurd is filling your car's tank with a ferret. Angelica: I'm playing the most dangerois game of all. Chuckie: Musical Chairs? -Rugrats

 Mleh to you, Michael. I'll say what I say and do what I do. Word. lol just kidding. Sorry, just posted a ghetto Christmas poem on my diary and the ghetto-ness is contageous. Just wanted to wish everyone happy (insert holiday here)! I hope everyone has a good holiday and a good break. You guys' phobias are silly. I'm slightly arachnaphobic and claustrophobic...but not to the point of whatever. I suppose I am a little afraid of going into the guys' bathroom, but I think that's just funny cuz it's not like they'd mind if there was a girl in their bathroom, right? Oh, and, Marten, I hate that feeling...that your fly is unzipped...I always triple check before leaving the bathroom, just to make sure that I'm not showing everyone my pink polka-dotted underwear. Not that they'd mind. Again. oh well. bye. Wacky is filling your car's gas tank with 3-octane gasoline. Absurd is filling your car's tank with a ferret.

 I have the same fears about bathrooms, only after I've used it, I have the horrible feeling that I forgot to zip my fly. On the matter of phones, I'm mostly scared to use them at all. Wacky is filling your car's gas tank with 3-octane gasoline. Absurd is filling your car's tank with a ferret.

 None of my phobias have names. When you see the giant list of Phobias, it's hard to imagine they left any out , but mine are very obscure. The first one is the irrational fear that I've just walked into the wrong bathroom, characterized by repeatedly poking my head out the door to check the sign and occasionally leaving the stall door slightly open so I can see urinals. (I realize some of you may not have wanted to know that, but when I'm ranting it's hard to stop) My second and much worse fear is talking to answering machines. They're horribly misnamed, because they don't answer. They talk, beep, and then just listen silently. The worst part is, unlike people, they remember everything they hear perfectly. Once you've said it, there's no taking it back. So, normally, if I call someone and the answering machine picks up, I hang up immediately in fear. Sometimes, though, you just have to reach someone. In these cases I'll leave a message. I'll start talking, but the silence on the other end makes me uncomfortable, and I start rambling to fill the silence, until I've forgotten what I was gonna say, at which point I start mumbling and hang up. After I've hung up, I realize how awful it sounds and call back in order to apologize for the first message and say what I need to say, but this doesn't always work as planned either. So, anyone I call and leave a message for thinks I'm a gibbering idiot, and it's all the fault of those dram answering machines. Anyway, if any of you know or would like to make up names for those, please let me know. In other news, Tales is updated. Reply to Michael's e-mail already. I want to change my links to urlLink 5-minute Voyager and urlLink Triangle and Robert (I'd forgotten how raunchy PWOT was). And please, please help me think of a new title scheme. Time is running out! Wacky is filling your car's gas tank with 3-octane gasoline. Absurd is filling your car's tank with a ferret. (This is from T&R btw)

 i was thinking about people of different religions, and people of no religion, and how that relates to me. I have quite a few friends of different religions, and i thought about free will. We obviously have the right not to believe in God, or Jesus. Otherwise we wouldn't have free will. Also, how could people of different religions believe so adamantly in there own as I do in mine if there weren't some truth in it? In general moral belief, all religions are pretty much the same. I mean, generally one doesn't hear of actual satan worshiping religions, becasue they'd be out killing everyone including themselves. Of course, if you worshipped satan, you proobably would belive in God and Jesus, you'd just be on the opposite side. What we do hear about are Extreme Puritans, or terrorists. They aren't always Muslims, they just are currently. I'm not quite sure where i was going with all this, but its a random thought that hit me. Discuss.

 Shoutout to Jonah for being the only one to listen to obvious and simple instructions. And Shoutout to Herman Miller for the new Aeron Chair. Y'all are cool people. Apparently all of you have fallen and hit your head on something hard. If you check Compendium today GET! ME! AN! EMAIL! JournalCon shuts down in less than 8 hours. So if I get nothing in my inbox, your done. It's all over but the bleeding, people Also (Especially Erin and Sophia) need to read the Daily Updates at What Kind of Day Has It Been. This is my last chance to pimp out my site before departure tomorrow so I'm taking it. GO urlLink HERE NOW! And also add "prolly" , "nurr", "Cya" and "WoRdS wItH rAnDoM CaPiTaLiZaTiOn" to the Echelon list of words that annoy Michael. Although my pointing that out will probably just make you say them more. And Marten, the word "subjugate" will forever be dirty in my mind. And Thomas, Sorry if I appeared dodgy, I thought you wanted one of my Twizzlers. And You would have had to have pried them out of my cold dead hands! And Sophia, I believe the quote is a misinterpretation of one of Maya Angelou's poem. The one where she's got oil wells digging in her back yard. Yeah, that one. (if you were in my 9H English class during the interpretive reading of that poem you saw Taylor Sheridan groping himself. Yeah, I wish I had missed it too.) Does my sexiness offend you?

 You guys! I just got accepted to Hanover College, my number one choice for the college I want to go to!! :) And today in AP Lit Mrs. Grabill read us The Polar Express, one of my favorite story of all time! And it's Break! And Christmas is soon! Yay!! Does my sexiness offend you?

 I don't want to start a flame war, but Sophia, you're kind of off your game. Take a little break, plan things out, stop using obvious spanish term bands as your title scheme. Take a break over the Christmas holiday. Just the opinion of one man. Does my sexiness offend you?

 I suck at improv. I guarantee the easiest way to get an A in Drama is to be my partner. Because while you may not get an A you will sure do a heck of a lot better than I did. Bye Lara. Even Nepotism must come to an end. READ! THE DAILY! UPDATES! If you aren't interested in JournalCon, the least you could do is E-mail me and tell me that. As of now, Jonah is coming. Just Jonah. I'm tired, I'm cranky, and my wife's in Argentina, let's get this over with.

 lol man, my band names are really sucking. The past three have been "The Men" "The Women" and this one is "My Brothers". lol all in Spanish, of course. They're latino bands. nurr. anyways, this should probably have a point, huh? OH! BYE LARA!!!!! Now...what else...today was my first day in stage tech since last monday! Yay! not really...but I took the test anyway and I'm positive I passed. Prolly got an A, knowing me. I'm such a nerd. :D lalalalalalalalalalala. Oh! I started making my ChRiStMaS presents today! YAY! I really need to stop writing this post, it's irritatingly random and pointless. So...bye all! Does my sexiness offend you?

 Chris Linday's reading my website again. Waaa! I have changed the address to this. Here is the urlLink link Read the Updates! Tomorrow: "Timing and Space"

 I post to say goodbye to all you weird bloggy people. *hugs all* I love you! I will ne'er see you again! *weeping sounds* Oh, well now thats over *wipes nose* I might still read the blog but I wont post much anymore!! Bye!!Toodloo!! Does my sexiness offend you?

 I think that's the right adjective...oh well. Dude, where is that quote from? The siggy? BECAUSE I HAVE HEARD IT BEFORE!!! omg. this is going to drive me bonkers. Anyways, I'm coming to school tomorrow. I promise. You'll just have to listen to me cough all day. lol I guess the only person I'm really talking to right now is Marten since he's the only one who I see regularly throughout the day. I suppose I do see Erin in the mornings, though, and Thomas sometimes, too. So I am talking to them as well. Okay, sorry, I'm gonna go sleep...cya. Does my sexiness offend you?

 Nathan's under stress and is cranky. That's the connection. 1 RSVPs to JournalCon. Sorry that no-one else cares. DAILY! UPDATES! AT! WHAT KIND OF DAY HAS IT BEEN! READ urlLink HERE!

 HAH! This means crab cakes taste good! So, I want to girate Sophia's sexy, lascivious toes. I also have giraffes in my car. (What is a giraffe's latin dance?) If you give Thomas corn fritters, he'll bomb Ohio. Don't. Universal translators pickle cheesecake. Smile properly. If you ever smile improperly, Lord Ted von Ob will be grumpy. Erin subjugated Wisconsin last Christmas. Santa Clause was hungry, so Canada provided Lara. Someone put Laurenec Fishburen's mushroom into someone else's navel. My Sharona has a naval rank of admiral. The farmer Michael plays in the dell computers. THE (AARDVARKS REAR) END. Does my sexiness offend you?

 Shoutout to Jonah for being the only person who actually listens to really really simple instructions. Another Shoutout to Jonah, who is (as if we didn't already know) a really good feature writer. urlLink These people said so. It's the 13th of December! Which means that I will begin daily updates of What Kind of Day Has It Been. Yay! Updates. I probably won't post much at Compendium. Actually it's all touch and go because the laptop, which incidentially is older than I am, may not be able to connect to the internet, thus making it worthless to drag out to California as my Carry On Luggage! He'll try to tuck and roll, but it won't work because he has square pants.

 Pidgey, 1999-2003. May you fly forever through the friendly skies of heaven. He'll try to tuck and roll, but it won't work because he has square pants

 Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha...I write this from a seat of power, for I have admin access and you have none. Ha Ha Ha Marten: Not For Long, Michael Michael: Ha! You cannot defeat me! I defeat you! urlLink You're Fired ! Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha! Marten: I have been vanquished! No!!! But seriously people, I want you to look at the Changes at Compendium Each Blogger Gets Two Personal Links. I have mine down. I guessed on a couple of yours, but e-mail me if you have none or want some or think that I suck. Comments are fixed so now Ryan can say that I suck. I guess he saw me do my monologue. I am officially Glark to Marten's Sars. Click on my link to figure that out. Or E-mail me urlLink here.

 end line thingy suggested by michael. Good Lord, there's a modem in my shoe!

 Shout-out to the nice lunch lady at LN. The one in the Taco line, with the accent. She always brightens my day. Debate! It's a wonderful thing. We had one today first period and I crushed the opposition (namely Nathan). I'm curious, Marten. Who else reads the blog but doesn't write? (besides Ryan). In terms of the Thomas situation, anytime you see that he's online, IM him with Post on the Blog! every five seconds. If we all do this, he'll have no choice but to comply. Do not, however, use the same strategy with me and Corndog. In other news, I'm ditching MMtto??? as a section, and I'm going to add something new. Right now I'm going with random capitalized comment of the entry. This one is: ARGLE BLARGLE IS NOT MY CHICKEN'S NAME, SO STOP PUTTING WORDS IN MY SPLEEN! With any luck, they'll get progressively more random. Michael, explain this shoutout to me please. Sophia, good luck with that I guess, and I hope you feel better, too. Marten, nice endy thingy Finally, Why in the Hellenistic era doesn't the blog link to Tales , yet!?!? Good Lord, there's a modem in my shoe!

 That's kind of what JournalCon is. You celebrate survival and give me tips on how to deal with the heathen monkey. And no, you can't blame everything on Mr. Hall. That's what Mrs. Mohr is for. Ok, What's next. Tommy needs to post. Seriously. SERIOUSLY. Note to everyone. I don't know, I forgot. I probably won't post for a while out of respect for the others in this blog. I'm on hiatus. The lid is on, have a great holiday. Read my daily updates at What Kind of Day Has It Been. What's Next?

 I blame Mr. Hall for everything. He made me lose debate. We should have a party at the end of the six weeks when we no longer have to deal with him. I'm a Thespian! Thomas is playing games. and hes lazy. and his life is boring. Post something! Whats the point of calling it a laptop if your not supposed to use it on your lap?

 Eww! No one wants to here about your menstration! And Aw. Also I think the word is Ya'll Also, I hate the Librarian at LC. The one with glasses that's perpetually dressed in barf-green. She's a bitch on wheels. You can read more about her Memorial Day, 2006 in "Graduation Day, Part Two" coming to Michael's blog soon. Or more specifically less than three years. PS - I am shutting down What Kind of Day Has It Been...Wait for it...Wait for it...Wait for it...25 August 2006. It's a high school blog, and I have signed a three year, $400,000 per entry contract with Blogspot and Blogger. Don't fret, I am allowed unlimited posts at Compendium, until Marten gets bored, and the Comstocks have to start their college applications (and with all their extra-curriculars, to be considered for the 2006-2007 year, they're going to have to start...right now) Also does anyone wonder why Thomas is perpetually online, yet never posts? I seem him all the time on my buddy list.

 Marten: Maybe I have been different. I can't tell anymore. I think that the fact that I'm super pmsing *I know ya'll didn't want to know that, but figured it might explain something*, and suspect that I have the flu might just have put enough stress on me to act like a major bitch. I don't know. I'm sorry for doing whatever I did and for having a hard time. Please forgive me. Michael: Thanks for standing up for me...I think...lol I didn't really understand what you were doing with that post, but I recognized that you were telling Marten off just as much as you were telling me off. So thank you. Nathan: yeah, as you can tell, girls are weird. We're all weird. It's just part of our physiology...I'm surprised there isn't a specific gene that makes a specific protein (Woo hoo Mr. Lamishaw's class!) that makes us stranger than you. Who knows. But, yeah, it's the whole "I want what I can't have" mindset that's making these chicks *did I just say chicks?!* swoon over you. and I'm happy that you're happy with Ashley! :D

 Shoutout to JJ Abrams who just gave one of our own bloggers a magnificant shout-out last night on Alias. Congratulations on being the new Will, Jonah. 11 days until cut off people. I may check my e-mail on the twentieth but I may not so get JournalCon RSVPs IN MY MAILBOX by December 19th. E-mail is here. E-mail me even if you aren't coming so I'll know that you aren't coming, rather than just thinking that you are ignoring me, which I'm pretty sure most of you are. TWoP Quote "Oh, ABC! You and your viewer-discretion advisory. Trying so hard to be all rough and tumble. It's cute. Anyway. We open on a very rainy day, and two FBI agents chasing some other dude through an alley. It's very blue in Richmond, apparently. I'll add that to the list of things cinematography has taught me about geography: thanks to Line Of Fire, I know that Richmond is blue. Thanks to Traffic, I know that Mexico is yellow." Jessica on Line of Fire

 Michael: This is not just a personal vendetta against one action by Sophia, this is a late reaction to a month of on and off bitchy behavior Sophia: I'm sorry if I've offended you, but you really have been different, and I'm not the only person around you that's noticed, but whether this is just a stupid Marten Paranoia thing or not, I'd like to keep it offline. I'd also appreciate it if you didn't blatantly insult my friends online. Nate: um... yeah.... girls are weird. Whats the point of calling it a laptop if your not supposed to use it on your lap?

 I've figured out how my luck with girls works! It's not that they don't pay any attention to me at all. It's just that they do it in clumps! Whenever I commit myself to a relationship, it seems 2 or 3 incredibly attractive girls who never payed me any attention before start hanging all over me and pouring out there hearts to me, because now I have to tell them to stop. There was Sarah and Sasha, and now that I'm so happy with Ashley, of course a really hot girl starts talking to me about how lonely she is and how I'm the only nice person there. Mind you, given an actual choice between those two, I would have chosen Ashley anyway, but I still wish that sort of thing would happen to me when I'm single. Sorry if I bore you, that's my life. And that's it. I'm going back to bed.

 I am an instigator. I am a scrappy terrier that will chew your leg off if you look at me funny. That's why what I'm going to say is going to be more shocking than the last five minutes of a majorly-hyped Law and Order episode. Sophia and Marten are being childish and need to bury the metaphorical hatchet. You know Marten, you're the administrator of this blog and I respect that. However I think your indignation towards Sophia is covered in crap. Petualantly hiding away and editing posts isn't going to make this go away. Okay, Sophia may have offended a loyal reader. Big Deal. That's not nearly as bad as the time when I told Erin that my post may be so asinine she should "close [her] eyes and think of England, sweetie. It gets better" If you would have let this g, talked to her face to face, and I'm not just talking about the Ryan Hagan post, but rather the calling here bitchy, than this would have been a non story. But instead you openly attack her on the blog, which automatically put her on the defensive. Now Sophia's mad and you're mad and the rest of us are caught in the crossfire. But if you insist on starting things, than you better finish them completely, because if you just hide away than I will wait in the tall grass for you, Marten, because you are killing the blog. I'm not saying that Marten was the only one wrong in this argument. I have once (spectacularly) gone off on someone and made mountains out of molehills. But Blatantly attacking a read with no reason given to this sudden outburst is just confusing and apparently unacceptable. If you are going to hate something you need to give a reason, because otherwise you look petty and small. And Believe me, I know petty and small. But you have to remember that I openly apologized and extended an olive branch once I realized that I was wrong and that my comments were offensive and petty. So If you don't stop being "bitchy" and apologize to both Ryan and Marten, than you are just as wrong as Marten is, and someday we may look back and realize that Compendium, what was a Utopian Shangri-La for hilarous intellectuals, failed because petty squabbling between the writers. I may be hypocritical for saying this. I might me monumentally out of line. I am pretty sure I looked back five minutes ago and saw that line that you don't cross with an administrator fading away in the rear-view mirror. Marten, If you don't want to apologize, If you believe that you are absolutely right, than I accept that. But if you believe that you were wrong and are just afraid to swallow your pride and apologize, then God, Marten. I don't even want to know you

 Shoutouts to Rachel Griffiths (who had a baby), Tom Cruise (who got a haircut), The cast of The OC (who are #1 on the TV list of breakout stars of 2003) and Keira Knightsley (who is number one in movies) C.J.: Good morning, Mrs. Landingham. Where are we in the saga of Toby and the President? MRS. LANDINGHAM: They seem to be having a disagreement. C.J.: A disagreement or a fight? MRS. LANDINGHAM: Well, it certainly has the potential... BARTLET [OS] [shouts]: Oh, for God’s sakes Toby! MRS. LANDINGHAM: There we go. Oooh, Chickfight on the blog. Ten bucks on Sophia. Any takers? The Following is the expressed opinion of Michael Christie, and does not reflect the views of Marten Dollenger or the Staff of Compendium of Stupidity I think that it would make sense if Sophia gave a reason why she hated Ryan Hagan. That would explain why. Also I find it somewhat shocking that Marten actually edited a post. I'd also just like to congratulate Compendium of Stupidity on three months online. Also I'll be posting a piece on weddings, currently titled "Untitled Michael Christie Blog Post". It's so delightfully meta, don't you think? The Obligatory Television Without Pity quote. These will appear until y'all visit. Pamie: That damn SuChin is finishing up. Stee: Now, SuChin...she won a contest, right? She's not actually a VJ. Please tell me that. Pamie: She does that thing to me that happens to Kramer when he hears Mary Hart's voice. Stee: I'm gonna interview you in the style of the MTV Video Music Awards opening. Pamie: Okay. And I'll do it like a guy who's there. Stee: "Okay, okay! So Pam! I mean, I mean...! Hey, there's...! I'm standing...! Hey! I...there's....! Thanks, Kurt! I'm standing here on the red carpet with...Pam--" Pamie: "Right, right, true, true!" Stee: "So, Pam! This is absolutely amazing here tonight, isn't it?" Pamie: "Oh, you know, it's like I'm saying, I've been, I mean, you know. I'm just here. I'm just sayin'. You know, everything's been a really good year and we're all just really happy about everything--" Stee: "--Is--?" Pamie: "--and how everything has worked out." Stee: "Now, isn't our red carpet really red?" Pamie: "Oh, you know, it's like I'm saying, it's like, yeah, I mean, it's like, crazy, man, it's like, amazing." Stee: "Now, I understand that you, uh, don't like Kurt Loder. Is that true?" Pamie: "Oh, you know, it's like I'm saying. Everybody has like, things going on and stuff and it's like, you kinda, you know, you work through it. You know, and everything. But my new album, CHICKEN AND RED MEAT, drops October7th, and that is what it's all about. CHICKEN! CHICKEN! OCTOBER SEVENTH!" Stee: "All right..." Pamie: "WOOOOOO!" Stee: "How many, how many hours a day do you watch MTV?" Pamie: "What? I'm sorry, I was talkin' to my boy! That's my boy right there! T-Bok! And T-Bok, come over here, T-Bok! Woooo!" Stee: "I forget..." Pamie: "WOOOOO!" Stee: "I forget who I'm...who you're talking to." Pamie: "Oh, you know, it's like I'm saying." Stee: "Hey, fat guy! Uh...Sway! Umm...." Pamie: "Wooo! October 7th!" Stee: "SuChin! Someone help me!" Pamie: "October 7th! October 7th!" Stee: Man. Pamie: And now...the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards! In the hizzy! -Pamie and Stee on The MTV Video Music Awards. The Hilarious Title of the Recap is "Yo Yo! Our Recap Drops On September 8th! Hollah!" Seriously there is something for all of y'all. Children of Dune recaps for the Comstocks. Regina's Alias Recaps for Marten. I don't know what Thomas, Sophia, Erin or Lara watch, so I guess there are only things for the Comstocks and Marten. Never mind.

 Marten-Why don't you just kick me off? And it's not that I'm any different from before, it's just you're noticing that I'm quite the b i tch. I decided to "edit" that one myself so you didn't have to take the time out of your schedule to do it for me. You're welcome. Michael-That quote was pretty funny. Nathan-That looked pretty interesting to me...lol, the title of your musical cracks me up. :D

 This is a parody I just finished from our hypothetical musical A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Ithaca . To the tune of the Stones' "Wild Horses". Enjoy! Gods in heaven, it’s easy to do The things you wanted, we sacrificed them to you Immortal Lady, you know who I am, You know you can’t let me lose to Priam All our forces, couldn’t get into Troy All our forces, couldn’t get into Troy You’ve watched us suffer, fighting in vain, Helen is still there, inside their domain No sweeping exits from enemy lines Could make us feel bitter and leave her behind Men and horses, could get lost in the fray All our forces, still would not go away I know I’ve dreamed of getting inside And Meneleaus, would get back his bride Walls would be broken, Tears would be cried All of the Trojans, soon will have died Large, Wheeled horses could get us into Troy Large, Wheeled horses could get us into Troy Large, Wheeled horse, could get us into Troy Trojan forces, we soon would destroy To be perfectly honest, Jonah came up with the idea and part of one of the verses. It's still sort of a work in progress, so any suggestions would be appreciated. And that's it. I'm going back to bed.

 Marten - No Hipster Flare sounds like a pair of pants. Also the socratic thing got blown to hell once you hired me. Because while it maybe interesting. It just ain't funny. Nathan - I'm now the president of yo' mama! Bow before me, The President of the Kingdom of Ma Hornbeck! Erin - Queen of the Trees? Do tell. Also did you see your love thread on the forums. There's a link somewhere around here. Also everyone loves Ewan McGregor!...That sounded straighter in my head. I'm sorta having a gay day today. Sophia - As Do I. Though It would be sad if he saw this and slit our throats while we were sleeping. But not together. Although I wouldn't mind sleeping together. Because I'm straight. I was at Bethlehem Village tonight and wasn't able to mod the thing. It's okay, y'all didn't seem interested anyway. I'm [illegally] downloading the second season premiere of The West Wing, In The Shadow of Two Gunmen, Parts One and Two. They won the Emmy for best writing in an episode. They also reveal "Who's been hit! Who's been hit!" (I sincerely hope it's not CJ. Allison Janney rocks. And According to EW Allison Janney was the best thing to happen in that stupid Mandy Moore movie "How To Deal".) I don't know what else to say, so I'm just going to quoteTelevision Without Pity You don't care, but I do [tm Erin] "Paris and Nicole are giving interviews on a red carpet for the premiere of their show. The interviewer asks if they are ready for this. I think a better question is, "Are we, the viewers, and in fact all of America, ready for this?" And the answer is, "It's December and sweeps are over, so why the hell not?"" -Kim on The Simple Life

 I hate Ryan Hagan. [Sophia, this is hardly the place. What's with you this past month? I don't generally edit like this, but this is utterly inappropriate. You really need to calm down.------Marten PS Ryan does read this regularly] what's the point of calling it a laptop if your not supposed to use it on your lap?

 I kinda meant for this blog to be somewhat socratic, but it never happened. Started to with the Time thread, but it died. Jonahs new title scheme should be things that sound like attacks from animes! You know, in those action sequence thingies when They say the name of the attack?Like Hipster Flare. (Its a kind of pants that lara has and I thought it sounded like sumthin from digimon) Whats the point of calling it a laptop if your not supposed to use it on your lap?

 In case some people haven't heard me say this yet, go see Love Actually! Great movie. Not just one happy ending-- but lots! This weekend I am finishing college and Prelude applications, studying for precal test, working on research paper, memorizing my lines as queen of the trees, and making elf hats. Hopefully somewhere in there I will fall unconscious and not wake up until December 20. I am six lines away from being finished with my latest parody, "At the End of the Day- Naboo Style!" I have a horrible suspicion that, were there to be an online Socrates Cafe, I wouldn't have enough time to attend. Jonah's blank entry leads me to suspect that he may be the Phantom Menace. I have a bad feeling about this... Segue to Erin's Fanfiction Recommendation of the Week ("You might not care, but I do."): The Shifty Troublemaker, a TPM parody on fanfiction.net. This piece is very clever: frequent references are made to George's quest for more money through spectacular marketing and his love affair with impressive CGI creations such as Jar Jar and the Wizard Eopies, not to mention the Lego (tm) Podracers. Anakin has tourette's. Coruscant is one giant disco bash. Qui-Gon loves his drugs and perhaps a certain young Scot. This fanfic is the origin of the infamous penguin line. Need I say more? Whats the point of calling it a laptop if your not supposed to use it on your lap?

 I love drama! More on that later. I would be scared if Michael were president of anything. More on that would be superfluous. I think an online socrates cafe would not work at all. everyone would be talking at once and so the discussion would be somewhat stunted. That happens on all chat rooms and I doubt this one would be any different. So for now I'm gonna say no. Even if Christen's there, seeing as I have a girlfriendwith whom I'm quite happy. Ok, Drama. Today in our scene groups we all got the same scene, but we had to figure out what the somewhat cryptic dialogue was about, and make up motions to go along with it. It was really fun. I have four essays to write. That makes me sad ): But Drama, Ashley and the fact that it smells like Christmas make me happy (: Jonah: How about AB, then AC, then AD, etc. either in the first word or the first and second?

 I hate Drama. More on that later. I want to Run for School President. More on that later. I would be glad to moderate an online "Socrates Cafe: Now with 75% less Guthrie!" Just grab a frappuchino and IM me at SBristowSD6 so I can let you in. I probably won't talk much, cause I'd be doing other stuff, but I can create private chat room (I don't know if all of you with AIM can do that. If you can then someone else will do it.)

 The end is near! Z is fast approaching, and the end of my title scheme with it. My options are: Switch to numbers (Very Difficult) Use double letters (Difficult unless I'm posting about different sizes of batteries or BB guns) Start over at A (Boring) Make up a totally new scheme (Conceptually painful- I stand to lose my alphabetical identity) So, as you can see, they all have disadvantages, so your suggestions would be appreciated. Second, the blank page. When I saw it, I thought it was either the stupidest or most brilliant thing I'd ever seen. But I didn't want to dis it without trying it, so I made a blank post. And it was refreshing. If nothing else, it stimulated conversation. Sophia - That sounds like a great idea, but for me a big part of Socrates Cafe was being on a coffee high, so I don't know how much I'd enjoy the discussion without it. Out of curiosity, how is Guthrie limiting the numbers? Fourth order of business, my life is crazy. Just for fun, I'm going to list all of the things that contribute to that. Band Things Marching band Fiesta Bowl Prep Pep Band rehearsals and games ISSMA Solo and Ensemble contest Concert band concert in a week Church Things Choir cantata and rehearsals Pagaent and rehearsal(s) Youth Group (Tiny Tim) Brass Quintet Brass duet with Thomas School Things Book Report/ Reading of book for World History Debate in Lyceum Next issue of North Star Regular Homework Other Things Speech Supporting the craziness of others (attending choir, orchestra concerts) Eating Sleeping Trying to have a social life Wow, 18. That's more than I would have thought. Anyway, that's pretty crazy, so if I don't post again before January, that's why. What's the point of calling it a laptop if your not supposed to use it on your lap?

 lol, I thought Jonah's intentionally-left-blank post was quite refreshing. :D Now, I was struck with a brilliant idea and was wondering if you all would be interested in joining/helping me. Since Guthrie started limiting the number of people allowed to attend Socrates' Cafe, not everyone can go. Which super-sucks. So I was thinking that maybe if we started an INTERNET Socrates' Cafe, more people could join and we could have a more interesting, philosophical time on the internet! So I propose a Socrates' Cafe CHATROOM! Who's with me?! Oh, and, Michael, that date is my mommy's birthday! Just fyi! Whats the point of calling it a laptop if your not supposed to use it on your lap?

 Yeah, Jonah that was stupid. If you want to see blank pages just...open up blank word documents like normal people. PS: Join the Forums! They're cool and hip and happening! Also If no-one joins, then it disappears the 29th of December.

 Jonah, that was stupid. It had no point! Why bring blank pages back to the internet? It can't be relaxing, as starring at a computer screen, blank or not, is bad for your eyes. Good Lord, there's a modem in my shoe!

 This entry intentionally left blank. (Find out the point of that urlLink here )

 lol, great day, today. Yeah. I was really super-dooper hyper. :D Marten knows. Anyways, Michael, your day sounds pretty awesome cept for the whole impaling thing! I wish I had talked about Napoleon's penis in Japanese! That'd been so super fun! hahahhhahaha. I'm done. bye. Whats the point of calling it a laptop if you ' r e not supposed to use it on your lap?

 Guess what? You want to hear about my day? I actually stayed awake in Algebra. I made spaghetti in Nutrition and Wellness. We talked about Russia and Napoleon's Penis in Japanese, and I impaled myself on my monologue in Drama. See, this is why I don't try new things, It turns out they're either boring or I'm really bad at them. Carmela! Get me a Vodka Tonic and some lighter fluid. Daddy wants to fly! Yes I'm talking to you, you wayward Cabana Girl. Now Go! Also I just found out that unemployed sitcom writers wear tweed. Who knew?

 Shoutout to Tim Dinger, who I think is a butthead, but he'll never find out because he's anti-blog. I have great Tim Dinger stories. Not to mention a really really funny one about Daniel Day. Remind me to tell you that one soon. Now Nathan, I'm sure that Ioians and Ganymedians are also ungrateful and mean. Astronomy humor. Doesn't go over well with people. The Europeans have always been mean. I've known that from the beginning of sixth-grade social studies. Europe has frequently been the enemy, just look at almost everyone of our wars has had a European enemy or been instigated by Europeans. Look at the Revolutionary War. Look at World War One. Look at Nazi Germany. Look at Russian History. (By the way, Nathan, I would highly recommend majoring in Russian History. Fascinating stuff. Even as late as 1917, Russian history has been turbulent and nebulous) Vietnam was started, indirectly by the French, British and Americans snubbing Ho Chi Minh at one of the summits after World War II. The British used Opium to get the Chinese high and take advantage of them. The Dutch did the same thing to Indians in order to acquire Manhattan Island in New York. Of course the Europeans are mean nasty and horrible. Even now most of them still are. While I have mixed views on the war in Iraq, I think that after saving French Ass in World War I and getting Germany back on it's feet after the calamitous forty-year period of War and death had to count for something. The British backing us proves that they are truely the best ally we have at this point. I wonder how long a tangent I can go on before you all stop reading. I think the Spanish Conquistador's behavior speaks for itself. They wiped out two advanced civilizations for gold. I think that was just greed for the point of greed. And look at Columbus. And I don't even want to bring up the fact that we gave them all Syphillis. The Swiss are probably the nicest people in the world at this point. Except for Heidi. She's a bitch. That's my entire view of imperialization. And Nathan (last line "Especially Islam. If I were them, I'd be mad too.") I think you meant to say the Arabs who have gotten screwed over a great many times by the west. Although we had no business arming them in Afghanistan back in the eighties, then running away with our tail between our legs after Yeltsen took office. We should have worked with the Afghans, set up a government and then backed away. That (indirectly) led to Terrorist Attacks over the last ten years, including the Apartment Buildings in Riyadah, The American Embassies in Nairobi and Dar Es Salaam and the one that hit closest to home, the terrorist attacks on September 11th. Offtopic (even more than I am right now), JONAH: Cornblog is a very stupid idea. Try something like "The Blogs of War". That will make sense after you read Julius Caesar. SOPHIA: Queen Mary? Cool. ERIN: I think I saw you this morning, but I may not have. How do you know in a school of 1,700? THOMAS: How's Columbo? LARA:ummm...Bye! I think this is it for me for a while. I'm tired and have quite a bit of work to do. I'll just leave you with this thought: "Fish Are Friends, Not Food."

 Ok, here we go. From Jonah's list, a question about an interesting topic. Why is history so Eurocentric? I'm really enjoying world history, despite Mrs. Layman and Spodek. You know why? Because, while I'm not getting a balanced perspective, I'm finally getting enough of one to see Europians for what they really are: fakes, thiefs, rip-offs. Ungrateful, and often down right mean. I had no idea how much revisionist history I'd been absorbing. Europeans have only been the big players for maybe six hundred years. The Chinese empire lasted like four times that long. Dar Al Islam lasted almost twice that long. But what do we learn about as kids? The last 200 years. The ones that involve America. Maybe a little about Europe. I've been thinking a lot about my career plans, and I think I want to major in Medievil history and minor in theatre. I'll probably still end up a teacher, but if I must teach, I'd rather teach history, and try and help kids get a somewhat better rounded view of the world. Especially Islam. If I were them, I'd be mad to.

 There was a mass suicide and I wasn't invited? Gasp! Anyway, I'm in Journalism SRT, and I'm supposed to be silent reading. Anyway, I think people aren't posting because they don't know what to say. So, I'm taking it upon myself to reaffirm what the blog is for. -- Posting interesting developements in your life that are not gossipy or girl/boy crazy. -- Posting Philosophical quandaries about random or interesting topics, like time or love. -- Relating interesting facts about stuff like cod or England -- Posting amusing anecdotes (funny is good) -- Convorsations!!! -- Suggestions for improving the blog, or for other bloggers, like this one. You all have atleast one of these in your head now, so post. Or face the consequences. It's okay! I had Subway!

 lol, since that made no sense what-so-ever...anyways, I KNOW WHO I'M GOING TO BE FOR MEETING OF MINDS!! :D I'm gonna be "Bloody" Mary I of England...daughter of Henry VIII!!! How exciting is that?! I just wanted to share that with you all. And, yes, Michael, there's a very large protest against something really stupid...that's why no one else has posted. It's just you and me. lol :D It's okay! I had Subway!

 I'd just like to point out that with the exception of, well me, that no one has posted in 48 hours. Is there a strike or a walkout or mass suicide I should know about?

 Live From Indianapolis, It's Friday Night! I just want to say a few things. The first of which I'd like to say this. I'd certainly enjoy reading The Complete Works of Erin Chandler . And that Ewok didn't look bad either. On this being an "LC Blog":Suck it up and deal, Nathan. You spent a good part of the car ride to Taj of India discussing people at LN I've never met. You want an LN Blog? Create your own. You can do that. You can create a blog just to discuss things at LN, but I will rise up an army and I will beat you. (I was paraphrasing Leo's speech on why A Proportional Response makes more sense than the disproportional response Bartlet suggested. Yes I'm just rambling here. Also I just realized that we have like eight of us here already (but only six who regularly post) But seriously that's a lot of bloggers, yo. I'm just making my point, and also using the phrase "Suck it" which I've always wanted to do. Also Nay on Flame War! Also Jonah is totally hot! Also speaking as a Republican, we really really need Dean or Sharpton in the White House. Not for their policies, but rather for the entertainment value. Also there needs to be a more charasmatic Republican candidate in 2008. I mean I'm talking Bartlet here. Alright, Nay on syndication! Also I'm introducing what, until I get bored of it, will be my new feature GOOGLING MEMBERS OF THE BLOG! I searched "Jonah Comstock" and there were four hits: The newspaper thing, the Indianapolis Children's Choir (Nathan was also there), Some random old thing and Corndog. Now apparently from the Nathan hits, Our Nathan is the first "Nathan Comstock" to be born in...about one-hundred years. Seriously people. The Nathan Comstock Timeline 1725: Nathan Comstock Born 1735: Nathan Comstock Born 1746: Nathan Comstock Born 1760: Nathan Comstock's daughter was born. 1776: Nathan Comstock Born 1786: Nathan Comstock Born 1802: Nathan Comstock Born 1806: Nathan Comstock Born 1809: Nathan Comstock was a Commissioner of the Poor in Palmyra, New York. 1816: Nathan Comstock built a cabin in Rockport, New York 1827: Nathan Comstock signed a petition having something to do with a highway in Michigan. 1862: Nathan Comstock Born Nathan Comstock is: a Freshman Senator at Emory University, a High School Tennis Captain in Georgia, and a marathon runner in Michigan. Thank you and Good Night! 2 links of 252 actually were Nathan Comstock. Funny, Huh?

 Actually its evening, but oh well. I still have a bunch of random stuff to say. You know what's creepy? Hearing your friends argue about whether or not your brother is hot. Especially when one is a guy. That's just my major weird experience of the day. If the constitutional amendment banning gay marraiges manages to pass, I'm going to stage a coup and overthrow the government. We need more LN people on this blog. I move to invite Tyler Rudd or Paul Simmons. Somehow this has turned into an LC blog with a couple of LN guys and that's not what it was supposed to be at all. It makes me feel left out sometimes. I also think you guys are being a little hypocritical in discussing LC teachers who Jonah and I have never met. No on Syndication. One: why do we want readers? Two: Who would want to read any of this? I think syndication is vain and pointless. I'm really sick of my title scheme, so as soon as I think of a good one I'm going to change it. Just a bit of warning. Ok, none of that had anything to do with the rest of it, but thats ok. Please don't get offended and try to start a flame war. Stop Kemps, We're Playing Euchre!

 I hate Mr. Phillipy I hope both he and Mr. Hall get married to eachother and die on their honemoon. Or it would have to be a civil union thanks to stupid President over there in Washington...I don't even know if THOSE are legal here. Stupid conservatives. Anyways. Mr. Phillipys such an asshole. I agree with everything you said about him because that's EXACTLY what I was thinking...he thinks he can read Cyrano's part when there are so many people in our class who could do SO MUCH BETTER! He's an awful speaker and he's so random. I hate him, I hate him, I HATE HIM! I've just had awful luck this year with gay English teachers, have I not? I CAN'T BELIEVE HE MADE FUN OF ME FOR SAYING "OUR" FUNNY!!! He can't even TALK about accents, stupid Pe-ru man. Grrrrrrr. And the whole "Bless you" thing? Grrrrrrrrrr. You enjoyed my pissed off acting? I would've thought it was quite funny as well if it hadn't been me he was making fun of. Asshole. Nobody makes fun of me and is still my friend. Unless if they're joking...I'm good with jokes. But he's not joking. He's dead serious about making fun of the way I say "our". Eat me, Mr. Phillipy. (Now I understand why it definitely isn't a good idea to syndicate this...sorry about the profanity guys...and about the awful comments...just sorry for making you read all of that!) Stop Kemps, We're Playing Euchre!

 Ha! Sophia, you made my day. Phillipe isn't much better, is he? What a yutz. The guy is a horrible speaker. We're reading Cyrano, and our teacher thinks he can read the lead. The guy has no prose skillz. can't act. Plus, or minus, as the case may be, hes a bloody hypocrite, he's rude, and has to have the stage constantly. He'll cut people off on questions and go on scripted tangents. I think he decides exactly what he's going to say before hand and if you don't follow his script hes just going to block you out. Stop Kemps, We're Playing Euchre!

 Do you all know how much I love snowblowers. Seriously, It took me fifteen minutes to clear off the driveway. Which is awesome. And I did it while listening to a .wav I ripped from the urlLink cheerleading episode of Joan of Arcadia. Also Yay for Snow Days! Also we can syndicate our blog. I know how to do it. It would expand our audience, which would be a good thing. Then again with some of the things said about a certain speech teacher, it may not. I'm syndicating What Kind of Day Has It Been. Just so you know. Syndication: Yay or Nay?

 This is the last post to utilize the stupid and tedious alphabetical title scheme. My next post wil began a totally new scheme. But I've finally figured out what my regular section will be: Match up of the week. This week: Who would win in a jousting match between Helen Keller and Larry the Cucumber if Larry was riding a giant corn chip with legs and Hellen Keller was riding a potato chip of equal size with wheels? (They are both using chocolate lances, but Helen Keller's is dark chocolate and Larry's is milk chocolate) Most of the matches will pretty much be like that. Also, "of the week" does not mean there will be one each week. There will still be one per entry, regardless of how they spread across weeks. Erin, please read the comments on the posts for information about your books. Do you think I could borrow Monstrous Regiment if I promise to read it quickly? (Easy enough. TH White is good, but his books take signifigantly longer to read than Terry Pratchett, whose books I have more than once read in a single night) Also, I am surprised that Celebration is coming here again. Pleasantly surprised though. And this time, we'll get organized enough to enter the costume contest for real. I'd like to conclude with the word Eggplant. But I won't, because this sentence is here. Stop Kemps, We're Playing Euchre!

 There's more to that quote, but it sounds funny right there as it is. Everyone should read Jonah's story if they havent been reading it already, it's awsome. Erin, I'm surprised. I was expecting, now that I am queen I want title scheme of my own, or something closer to that quote. precious is too predictable for the times. I'm betting Nate's the feminist and Heather's the communist. Oh, and Nate's hairstyle is now officially known as a lutefisk. It's a Norwegian dish of cod soaked in lye. Stop Kemps, We're Playing Euchre!

 Erin, Word on the Golden Globes. Apparently we'll get to also see Jack "Sunglasses at Night" Nicholson knock the microphone stand back and forth. My parents asked me what the difference between the Golden Globes and the Oscars were, the main differences being these: The Golden Globes are held in a Hotel Ballroom, usually the Beverly Hilton and the Oscars are held in a theatre, usuallyThe Shrine Auditorium near USC, The Kodak Theatre in Hollywood, or the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion at the Los Angeles Music Center, Downtown (I suppose the new Gehry designed Walt Disney Music Hall is a possibility, unless the Philharmonic Orchestra are performing) This tangent has been brought to you by NBC, the only place to see the 2004 hooker-infested Olympic Games in Athens and Drunken Celebrities at the Golden Globes. Also the fact that the nominees and attendees sit at tables, rather than in a big theatre. Also they drink heavily. There was really no point in me writing this entry except to say that I know a lot about the Golden Globes and Los Angeles, and you don't. Also Erin, Nathan told me he lost your book. Oy, With the Fishcakes Already! (The template thing should be italicized, as not to drag attention away from the entry)

 all night, but oh well.) In other words, show choir hell has officially started with 21 hours of Choreography in three days. On the plus side, this show rules! It is very awesome and I urge you to come see it. Especially if you want to see me being ghetto, and all of our girls doing Kung Fu. (Actually it's more like kick boxing, but some of these girls trying to pull off 'tough' are downright hilarious. Especially Amy and Laura.) So yeah, if you think you've had an exhausting week, I advise you to think again. Equally frustrating is that there is absolutely nothing cool for small, lightweight guys to do in a show choir show, and they won't let the girls lift me. In other news, Heather Haywood and I are writing a scene together in Theatre arts about a feminist, an environmentalist, and a communist. I think you can guess who I'm playing. Stop Kemps, We're Playing Euchre!

 Sooo.... Thanks for the title scheme, Marten. It's all mine now, my own... my preciouss. The Golden Globes are on tonight, which means we get the chance to watch drunken celebrities receive awards. I had something relevant to say, but I forget what it was. Oh, yes, give me my books back. And Celebration III is coming to Indy in '05, baby! Woohoo! Stop Kemps, We're Playing Euchre!

 Yeah, Mrr Hrr is the noise I make when I'm making fun of you...if you ever wondered. Anyway, I'm not dead, as I've been recently walking around school as is often the case on weekdays. I've just been rather busy and/or rather lazy. Your choice. I'm really tired right now, cuz I just got home from a party (lots of drugs and sex, guys, I had a great time. :D) and I only got 2 hours of sleep between the speech meet from hell and the party. Btw, I got 8th for Humorous Interpretation (yay) and 2nd to last in all of my OI rounds. Hmm. So I'm actually alive and well. Thanks. Stop Kemps, We're Playing Euchre!

 I am giving Erin full rights to my title scheme and taking a new one: Quotes from webcomics and other blogs. Obviously not this blog, that would be cheesy. Stop Kemps, We're Playing Euchre!

 I Know I just had to turn the page, but it looked better backwords. Note the clever spelling pun. It's from Reaper Man, which of just finished. It is very confusing. I noticed interesting metaphors for other stories, but it was still very odd. I liked it anyway. Work sessions make me tired. Of course, Im one of 2 or 3 that actually works the entire time, so hey, what did I expect? I HATE MY ART PROJECT! GROUP PROJECTS+ART=DOOM HOUSE! Stop Kemps, We're Playing Euchre!

 I'd just like to say this about Sophia, who apparently died, a month ago, that she was what she has always been. A great big fish. The Enemy Walks In will be up tomorrow, because I'm tired.

 My new semester schedule contains one highly awesome element: As many lunches as I want! Ok, well technically just whichever lunch I want but I can get away with more than one easily. It just so happens that my North Star period (which is during a beginning journalism class, so I'm the only one in it) is during a lunch period. Since I'm one person and the administration won't notice, Hayes said I can go to any lunch I want. First day I went to two and he didn't notice. If he asks, I was doing interviews. But other than that, the new schedule kinda sucks. Two new teachers, one boring but nice and one who I thought was mean but she's just old. I guess overall it's a wash. In other news, The Pajama Game is a sexist musical. It has three or four girls chorus songs, no guys songs and only about three that guys even sing on. Being male chorus is quite pointless, particularly knowing I will be cut from all the dance numbers. I'd better get lines, or else this musical will be a huge waste of my time. There is one post left before the alphabet fails me, so please tell me what to do. Marten, you should bold the end thingy in the template so it doesn't blend with everything else. Stop Kemps, We're Playing Euchre!

 Well, It lasted a day. And I'm back to deleting Marten's nonsensical blog templates from the bottom of my posts. I started Daily (not that any of you care) Updates at What Kind of Day Has It Been. Also I can't find the cool IKEA wardrobe I saw in Costa Mesa. Which doesn't put me an any better of a mood about dealing with the suckfest that will be tomorrow. I have to go post "The Box, Part Two" Oy with the fishcakes already!

 Wow, what a weekend. I planned a lot of stuff. A lot of stuff happened. I didn't plan all the stuff that happened. It was fun anyway. Hurray for Yo Yo Ma! Incase we have any uncultured whelps reading this blog, he plays the cello. He plays it well. Hurray for Momas who got tickets to see Yo Yo Ma! If there's anyone here who doesnt know who Momas is, she is the mother of Thomas. Mom + Thomas = Momas. Then I came home. Then I went away again. Off to Christin Neary's birthday party. Good food. Lots of people. and notice the sentence fragmens? Good device. Will be used more later. Anywhy, parts of it were fun, other bits tasted good. However, there was quite a bit of negative-marten energy there, so I was, for the most part, canceled out. Sounds silly, but what can I do? After that, Big Fish. It was fun. See What Kind of day has it been. michael what did I say about using the word props? This blog depicted here shall possess unseen marks, signs that she will be the one to bring forth my works. Bind them with fury, a burning anger unless prevented at vulgar cost, this blog will render the greatest power unto utter desolation.

 Props to Marten for using a writer selected signature-thingy. All of our writing is now Copyrighted! Yay! Also I've added another link to one of my sites. Because it's all about me and don't you forget it. This blog depicted here shall possess unseen marks, signs that she will be the one to bring forth my works. Bind them with fury, a burning anger unless prevented at vulgar cost, this blog will render the greatest power unto utter desolation.

 And so were the recaps. Seriously people, if you aren't watching Joan of Arcadia , you should be. Here's an excerpt from the fabulous Deborah's recap to entice you to watch... I'M QUOTING! BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT CONSIDERATE PEOPLE DO! DON'T HURT ME! "Kevin wheels into the kitchen, where the rest of the family is getting breakfast, reading the newspaper on his lap aloud to all: "'Chief Girardi's courage in confronting the corruption that has plagued Arcadia for years cannot be underestimated. He should be treated as a hero, not a pariah.'" Joan finds this odd and asks, "One of those flesh-eating Amazonian death fish?" Luke: "That's 'piranha.' A 'pariah' is an outcast, one of the unclean."" -Deborah on Joan of Arcadia 1.12, "Jump" Click this urlLink link . Fufill your true nature. Joan of Arcadia airs Friday at 8 on CBS. Nathan: Go urlLink here. Dork out.

 Okay, so it's not an actual quote, but I succesfully combined Lord of the Rings with Once in a Life Time. I get props. who coined that? Props to so and so. its actually kind of stupid and I never wat to hear it said again. Unless the speaker is refering to actual props for a play or something. Ok, Michael, Im going to read the Alias recaps for the episodes I mised on TWoP. Also, I'm going to ignore the squabble because I wasn't here. Also because I have divine right as administrator. And because I think squabble is a dumb word. reminds me of bad seafood. and notice the sentence fragments? good device. will be used more later I know from sparrows to starlings. After that, everything's a duck, as far as I'm concerned.

 I'm in the Newspaper! Page N-1, Star North section, "Students are all talk at contest". Just wanted to point that out. I'm under serious finals/beginning of show choir season/end of speech season strees right now. In a week like this, anything can make my day. Micheal- TwoP is really good. I wish they reviewed SG-1, though.

 Joan Girardi has one. Rory Gilmore has one. Sydney Bristow has one. keckler has one. John Carter has one. Seth Cohen has one. Laynie Hart has one. Now Michael Christie has one too. I have an iPod! I finally fixed the port and I have music on there. Right now I'm listening to music from Finding Nemo. There are about 11 intended links supposed to be up there. If you don't know who any of these people are, you don't watch enough TV. However, I'm nice enough to give you an idea: Joan of Arcadia, Gilmore Girls, Alias, Enterprise (recapper), ER, The OC and Everwood. Just go to your friendly search engine and type in "Television Without Pity" I promise I'll read a webcomic if you do this.

 I, too, am ignoring that squabble because it's over and moving on to say: That was definitely the best Joan of Arcadia ever! Hooray for Joan... or Jane, if you so prefer... and Adam! Good ripples all around. And definitely no weird scary koala bears in hats. Also, everyone, go see Big Fish. It is officially out now, and I saw a preview of it and it is such an awesome movie. It made me cry and laugh and everything. It's a brilliant film. Jonah, I want The Once and Future King back. Also The Da Vinci Code from Levi. You guys have had those for like six months. I've decided that I'm fixing the fanfiction recommendation of the week on Saturday, so here it is. You might not care, but I do. Another Lifetime by Kazzy, again for SW, again on fanfiction.net. I do read other fandoms and other sites, but these have just updated more. It's an AU where Padme doesn't die and is raising the twins, hopping from one planet to another and staying one step ahead of the Empire. Some very cute stories. I shall now push "post and publish." I know from sparrows to starlings. After that, everything's a duck, as far as I'm concerned.

 Dell's phrase is supposed to be a pun-thing..."Easy as Dell" instead of "Easy as Hell." Savvy? (haha, so much fun to say that. And I'm ignoring the squabble because it's over) I know from sparrows to starlings. After that, everything's a duck, as far as I'm concerned.

 Nathan, I'm sorry. I was wrong. I completely and totally over-reacted. And the rest of you thought this post would be all hostile. Best Joan of Arcadia Ever! Yay! If you aren't watching now, you should be! Here's the part of the post that was nice... 2.18 - 17 People The episode that set up sweeps week, as well as the future of the show. Bartlet's MS is revealed to Toby, who freaks out and tears both Leo and Bartlet new cornchutes. (I actually would have enjoyed a scene where he goes off on the first lady and she slaps him. But this is a serious episode...) Meanwhile Sam and Josh try to write jokes for a speech for the Correspondent's Dinner. Sam invites Ainsley up to write jokes and the end up debating the Equal Rights Amendment. Powerful episode, masterfully captured by Alex Graves, who is probably the most talented director on the show since Schlamme left. Great acting from Marten Sheen, Bradley Whitford, Janel Moloney and Rob Lowe. However Richard Schiff turns in a powerhouse performance and steals the show and runs. Also I don't understand dell. What is a dell exactly? And what does Dell Computers's catch phrase "Easy as Dell" mean. Cause it's stupid and I don't get it!

 I didn't read that post after the first sentence. Nor will I. I'm not going to retaliate. I'm letting this go. And even though you'll no doubt consider this a bunch of self riteous bs, I forgive you for that first comment. It's not the kind of language I would use lightly.

 Micheal, I typed a rather long rant in reply to you, but then I deleted it. I'm mad rght now. I was already mad when I read you're post. I snapped on five people today including both of my choir teachers. So I figured it would only start a flame war. So now I'm going to apologize for not explaining myself on the D&D topic, concede that I should have, and agree not to discuss it here. I will not make the same concession for webcomics unless you do for TwoP, The West Wing, and basically every T.V. show you talk about that I don't watch. You are holding a ridiculous double standard. Now I'm going to go take out my random, inexplicable anger on virtual characters in Super Smash Brothers.

 Hurray! Jonah wins! Jonah gets a brand new, all expenses paid cookie! hurray for Jonah. Nathan, i told you at youth group that I am in. -I know from sparrows to starlings. After that, everything's a duck, as far as I'm concerned.

 I don't know what the hell you are talking about. Quite frankly it's pissing me off more than a little bit. I loathe being outside of the loop. I also hate the fact that you cannot schedule an event without it being moved due to some previous obligation. On this note JournalCon is at 11:00 on the 31st of January. Come or don't, don't call before, just show up. I'm probably expecting to much of you to even read this post. The webcomics are calling. Okay...I've taken a few minutes, gotten a drink of water, had a shot of bourbon and now I'm back. I propose a moratorium on Webcomics discussion, as well as whatever the hell DM is. Lord of the Rings dorkiness as well as things of actual substance are not banned by this bill, H.Con-175. Vote in Comments (use Yay or Nay) Also, Yond Nathan has a lean and hungry look; He thinks too much, such men are dangerous.

 DMing is awesome! But Marten, I've decided I can't do this with just two people. I'm keeping the pirate theme, and I've expanded on it quite a bit. I need a couple more weeks to get everything in order. Meanwhile I've invited Paul and Tyler, and the invitation is still open to anyone else. Especially Thomas. Thomas, you in? Oh, By the way Thomas, you haven't posted because because time is an illusion, lunchtime doubly so, and time has been moving very quickly for you, so what seemed like days to us was only about half an hour to you, which you spent eating lunch. That's my guess, anyway. As for the Web comic talk, get in the game! I have 11 that I check regularly. I know from sparrows to starlings. After that, everything's a duck, as far as I'm concerned.

 hmm...whatever that means. I think you (Thomas) were out getting pregnant...that's why you weren't here. You should've used protection. Anyways, I'm happy with the websites I do go to and that's why I shan't be reading your other blogs or whatever it is ya'll are asking me to read. So yeah. Au Revoir. I know from sparrows to starlings. After that, everything's a duck, as far as I'm concerned.

 Sorry to post excessively, but I (being the Glark to Marten's Sars) have to inform readers and bloggers of the new features. Comments. Point, type, shoot. Simple enough, eh. I have one other request that I'd like to express. Can we lower the amount of webcomics talk, please? I always feel left out. Of course, I could rip out The West Wing episode reviews. I'm not kidding either. Seriously. ALSO OUT OF SHEER NECESSITY, I HAVE TO ASK AGAIN FOR REPLIES TO MY GENEROUS JOURNALCON INVITATION. SINCE NONE OF THE RESIDENT FEMALES HAVE RESPONDED AT ALL, THIS IS NOW A SLEEPOVER EVENT! urlLink RESPOND , DAMMIT! I ALSO NEED LINK SUGGESTIONS FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS THEM!

 Thomas, I am really inclined to do that having been reminded of your prize winning convorsation. Oh wait you didn't win a prize. You didn't even enter? Ohhh Yeah...I'm really inclined to give you a reason. I have one guess however because you're always online. You are playing games on the internet and never care enough to post on a collaborative blog. Yeah I'm saber-rattling. I'm extraordinarily jet-lagged and am not in the mood to be screwed with. Marten: IKEA - A Store that sells Cheap European goods (furniture, kitchenware etc.)

 ...I'm really tired. I forgot what I was going to post about. I'l probably ramble until it's more ridiculous than a Triangle and Robert Strip. Speaking of the comic, I say all you non-readers read a bit so we can play the Triangle and Robert Improvisational Puppet show! (or TRIPS) It's like a role playing game, but made to be silly, instead of silliness being made a mere possibility. Michael, what is IKEA? Erin, from now on, always press the Post & Publish button. It's got connected computers on it. I know from sparrows to starlings. After that, everything's a duck, as far as I'm concerned.

 Ok we have entries from Marten, Jonah, and Erin so far. Michael you will take this contest seriously ::waves hand in a Jedi like fashion:: Nathan and Sophia please enter asap. I know from sparrows to starlings. After that, everything's a duck, as far as I'm concerned.

 Jonah, the bands at the Rose Parade had to do the same thing, but for five and a half miles. And one of the bands played Barry Manilow. Ew. Read "Happy New Year" at my site! Coming today "20 Hours in America, Part One"

 Imagine holding five pounds of dead weight at level with your head, expending your air blowing into it while at the same time having to move forward, perfectly in step with those around you on uneven ground in unbearable heat. You are allowed to lower it from head to chest level for about four beats every three minutes. Imagine this lasts three agonizing miles, while the people you walk by are sitting, laughing, and eating food. Keep that in mind the next time you watch a parade. It's like gladiators - deriving pleasure from the pain of others. Other than that, Arizona was great. 2nd place by a tenth of a point in the field show, 3rd in that cursed parade. Saw the grand canyon, met some cowboys. Met three to six wonderful girls from Maine and got e-mail addresses and even a phone number. Marten suggested I refer to them as Xenophiles in my title because the were strangers who like me. Xylophones is because we have them in our pit. I must say, the grand canyon is absolutely amazing. If you've never been there I highly recommend it. Webcomic recommendation of the whenever is my official new section. I'm going to kick it off with the ever popular Sluggy Freelance. It's got Vampires, Aliens, Ferrets, and the like, but what makes it is the characterization and the quirky humor. The page is www.sluggy.com. The only drawback is the 7 years of archives, but if you find yourself with the internet and lots of free time, that is how I suggest spending it. Thomas- I think you were eaten by a carnivorous moose from another planet. You would be dead, except that just as you were being swallowed a space-time vortex opened and you fell into another dimension, specifically one populated by super intelligent tuataras, who made you their slave. You were rescued by MacGuyver, who was thrown in by a similar vortex, and he created a dimensional flux agitator out of a pair of dirty socks, a toothpick, and some frozen orange juice. However, the agitator wasn't perfect, so you ended up in the right dimension but the wrong planet. MacGuyver made a spaceship out of some rocks, the agitator parts, and a captured turkey-like creature, but there was only room for one, so he left you behind promising to send help. You waited for ten years and then gave up on that, deciding to find your own way home. However, at the discovery of a mostly buried statue of liberty you realized that you were on earth, just in the future. So you spent the next fifty years looking through the ruins of earth technology for a time machine. The best you could find was a youth machine, which is why you still look 16. You didn't find the time machine, but MacGuyver found you. He had realized his mistake almost instantly, but because of relativity it took 60 years of your time for him to come back. He was able to build a time machine with all the ruins you found, so you got back, only you were in New York. Because you had no money you had to work as a taxi driver to raise the money, but while you were driving the taxi you got pulled into a web of mystery and intrigue revolving around a series of murders and a woman named Moreen LaRue. Eventually you solved the mystery and got the girl, but she was run over by a speeding bus, so you returned here because you wanted to forget that other life and it's woes. (I think I deserve a cookie for that.) I know from sparrows to starlings. After that, everything's a duck, as far as I'm concerned.

 Yeah, Eoywn rocks. Oh, hello. I didn't know anyone was here. Before you all start, the laptop died a horrible death on the fourth day of the trip, thus making me unable to update daily. I have some of my pieces in a notebook (sitting in my new Dead Tubey messenger bag) however the rest are on the laptop (probably in a warehouse somewhere) Thomas, let me start out by saying welcome back. Also that people don't respond well to contests. Believe me. I know. I'll be updating in a completely random order until I'm done, dammit. Jonah: I tried desperately in vain to find the Fiesta Bowl parade, but I was in Pasadena at the time, and thats kind of like asking for Pepsi in Atlanta. Nathan: Crazy Idea! Don't try out for the play. You'll thank me on many a spring Saturday morning. Marten: IKEA! Erin: IKEA! Thomas: IKEA! Sophia: IKEA! (That rhymed. Hee.) And...I'm spent.

 Marten says he couldn't see my last entry, so I'm posting it again. Marten, I see you have started Monstrous Regiment. Isn't it special? It has some sort of dark parts later on, but I liked it. Return of the King was so awesome! I finally saw it yesterday. Eowyn kicked the Witch King's ass! Ha ha! I especially enjoyed the adaptation for film of the above line. I forget exactly how it went, but I remembered that part from the book, so while I was watching, I was like, "Say it... say it..." And Frodo and Sam had some very nice love scenes. And there were oliphaunts! Thomas, were you gone because you had to return a Ring, or possibly because you joined the army, or possibly because you fell into a parallel dimension? I know from sparrows to starlings. After that, everything's a duck, as far as I'm concerned.

 Laugh at Soph, for she is out of a loop. Few people at LC know, though. I mean, conversations lead to it sometimes, but it seems weird to say to some people, hey, I have a girlfriend now! Odd conversation starter, ya know? Props to Erin for an extremely long, extremely funny post. It was so Random and out there, that I thought michael was writing it until i saw your name at the end. Everybody check out the lobby! Its on the links, its my new journal site. Hey, I have a girlfriend now!

 Erin, thanks for showing Soph what a decent-lengthed, interesting post looks like. I think you get extra lint for that. Thomas, you recieve the shame hat tonight. Rules of the shame hat: It is worn until you post a post with atleast a hundred DIFFERENT words. It would have just been until you post, but Nate and Sophia made me add the qualifiers. There are instances wherein you can not wear the hat, such as the shower or while eating or praying or while the National Anthem is being played. But generally, wear the hat. If Marten reports to me that you are not wearing the hat we will devise stronger punishments. Now, match-up time! Results of the last match: It was cancelled on account of rain and will be rescheduled to late 2005. New match: A super-intelligent toothpick vs Alex Trebeck's hair in a competition to see who can take over the world first. The only rules are no Microsoft and no Easy Cheese. Now, onto business: I have nothing to say. Thank you

 Yesterday was the most amazing day in the history of life in my house. I should have my own journal just so that I could write about it, but instead I'll write about it here. It all began on Friday. Actually it began a few weeks ago when my grandmother brought over several pairs of underwear that were to big for her and thought that my mom might want them. She didn't. Fast-forward to Friday. Not having learned a single blessed thing and greatly overestimating my ass, Grandma brought over a pair of her underwear that were too small, thinking that I might want them. I don't. But my brother saw them and started teasing me about possibly keeping them. So, while he was in the shower, my mom prompted me to put them in his bed. I did so. The next day at lunch, I asked if he had found them. Mom said yes, and he had put them on her head. He said that he'd found them at the foot of his bed. Mom told him that during the night they had been in his bed. "You slept with Grandma's underwear," she said. He immediately began to plot revenge. That night, my mom discovered that all of her underpants were gone. Really gone. And in their place was an opera-ghost-like note declaring that there was no point in asking where they had gone, for revenge had begun so beware, etc. Conveniently, my brother was in the shower again. He wouldn't say where the underwear had gone. While I combed the house, my mom turned on hot water in all the faucets hoping to give him a very cold shower. When she realized this would take too long, she filled a cup with ice cold water and poured it into the shower and onto the little miscreant's head. Still, he would not speak. So mom took all the towels out of the bathroom. A moment later she realized that his pajamas were still in there, but by then he had locked the door. At first she tried to pick the lock with a bobby pin, but then we broke out the heavy machinery and removed the doorknob. For some reason this didn't work, and by now the boy was out of the shower. Still no sign of the underwear. That was when he informed me that I hadn't even found out what revenge he had wreaked on me yet. I went into my room to discover what he had done. The worst thing possible was that he had messed with my notebooks or folders or papers that are scattered about my room. He didn't do that. But he did do the second worst thing. He took my teddy bear. If you've ever been in my room, which none of you have, you'll know that I have several stuffed animals. But there is only one that matters. He is the definitive childhood teddy bear. And he was gone. I looked through the house again, but he was nowhere to be found. About fifteen minutes passed. My mom couldn't get the knob back on the door until my brother unlocked it. He couldn't unlock it until the doorknob was back on. So, finally, he held his side of the knob in place while mom replaced her end and he unlocked the door. Then he went to hide behind the shower curtain because he was still naked. Bad move. And he still wouldn't reveal the location of the stolen things. Worse move. We took his pajamas. Altogether, I would say that my brother was in the bathroom for about two hours last night. After his pajamas were gone, he refused to come out. We said we would give his pajamas back when he told us where our stuff was. He said he would tell us where our stuff was when he had his pajamas back. It was a standoff. For me, it had stopped being so much fun when Teddy went missing. I suspect that my brother wouldn't hesitate to destroy the bear if he was upset enough. My mother gave up and we into her room to watch TV, waiting for him to streak across the hall. I sat in the hall and watched the door menacingly, preparing to shoot him when he emerged like I was Natalie Portman and he was a Yankee soldier threatening the safety of the World's Largest Baby. After awhile I realized this was impossible because I had no rifle, so I went into his room again to search. This time I was successful. He had put my poor bear into his bass drum. He had played his damn drum set while poor Teddy was inside! I dismantled the front of the drum and rescued my teddy bear. Mom's underwear was still missing. Mom told me to leave the front of the drum dismantled. After a few more minutes, Mom gave my brother his pajamas and told him to give her her underwear and he was grounded. When he realized she was serious, he did has he was told. It had been locked in a trunk in his closet. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the most exciting thing that has happened in my house since I have lived there. (Wow. Just like Sassy.) Everybody, the Oscars are tonight, and if Renee Zellweger doesn't win, I want notes of consolation from all of you. Tammy's testicle ad may compromise our ability to win this task.

 WHOA! YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND?! Tammy's testicle ad may compromise our ability to win this task.

 I had the weirdest day at the gun show. A random redhead started talking to me, and I ended up with her address. House address. She's an hour away, so calling would be expensive, and she doesn't have a computer. So summing up. Random cute redhead gives marten, who has a girlfriend now for those who don't know, her address. I have to write letters now. I mean, what can I do? She's going to find me at the next event anyway, so I cant ignore her. Besides, she seemed cool, I don't want to be mean. But Kaylee will definately be a subject of my first letter, so she doesn't get any ideas. Tammy's testicle ad may compromise our ability to win this task.

 Apologies to Nathan, I was urlLink misinformed . I just learned some very interesting information. Needless to say that Jonah and I will be having an abrupt conversation sometime very soon. Also Happy Birthday urlLink Deborah ! Also, JournalCon 2: Electric Boogaloo falls close enough to my birthday to warrant a party. Bring Presents. I will place a blessing upon the offspring of whoever can bring me urlLink this . Or a reciept saying that it is shipping June 1st. Shut up, Carrie. You don't want a baby. You want shoes.

 lol running out of stupid band names. Nurr. Anyways, when do auditions start for the musical and what do you need to audition? And, yes, I do think that these short posts get me off the hook. Ha. You lose. Shut up, Carrie. You don't want a baby. You want shoes.

 The LC Musical for 2004 is Sugar. Which LC did already in 1981. It's based on Some Like It Hot. It's a good choice because nothing says 'high school musical' like guys in drag. Shut up, Carrie. You don't want a baby. You want shoes.

 Nathan, so the answer is pretty much never? That's all I needed to know! Shut up, Carrie. You don't want a baby. You want shoes.

 The LN blog will go online (and have a name) when I feel like it, If it happens at all. That is all I actually have to say. But since Jonah wants a long post, I will just type it again and again.

 Props to Alex Richmond. I did win a cough drop! It was wonderful. It tasted good and healed my raw and achy throat. It was like that thing that Galadriel gave Frodo in the Fellowship of the rings. The Title refers to the unveiling of the new template, seen below. Isn't it hilarious! Shut up, Carrie. You don't want a baby. You want shoes.

 Or rather, of Marten, who won the quarter. Michael got the cough drop and Erin, the next time I see her, will be awarded the lint. Sophia and Nathan get imaginary cookies. Thomas, however, has not posted and will recieve the hat of shame. This is a paper hat that says SHAME on it in big black letters. Now, Match up time. I put a lot of thought into the last match-up and decided that Stephen Sondheim, as a composer, might get distracted by the pitch and rythm of the little "bloop" noises and lose. The pitbull, however, as a pitbull, has no opposable thumbs and isn't tall enough to reach the controls, so old Steve only has to hit the ball once. Winner: Stephen Sondheim. Next: Claire Danes VS Natalie Portman in a waffle-eating contest. Only the catch is that they are also riding on unicycles, and to win, one must eat the most waffles and survive the obstacle course without falling off of the unicycle. Claire Danes is equipped with an industrial strength vacuum cleaner, and Natalie Portman has a huge autographed picture of the pope. So, now, to business. Michael - I am intrigued. What does this bandwagon jumping entail? Just that comic, or perhaps others? Nate and Soph - Do you think those little short posts get you off the hook? I want real posts or you'll all be wearing SHAME accessories. (Personal Note: Must find a way to keep SHAME gear from becoming fashionable.) Marten- Today is the day I abuse an admin power. But you also find yourself saying 'Natalie, if you screw that up again I'll set you on fire.'

 Darn you, Nathan and your inability to read prior posts! (Although I did notice you posted at 6 AM...) I have to ask all my questions again! Okay...Here Goes... When is the blog going online? What is the name of the blog? Is it going to be like Alias, where we refer to it as 'the LN Blog' until Nathan decides to title? Who is Joining the LN Blog? Is Nathan going to be administrator? Are the Comstocks leaving Compendium? Is Marten Joining? If Marten is joining can I join? Answers would be appreciated! But you also find yourself saying 'Natalie, if you screw that up again I'll set you on fire.'

 Number one reason I haven't been posting lately: Eighteen hour show choir competition. It was really fun, though. There was breakdancing and everything. But I have had no sleep. I require sleep to post. Or at least I thought I did. But apparently not. Anyway, since then I can't stop dancing. Whenever I hear a song I choreograph it in my head. I think I may be turning into Micheal Humphrey. Marten, does Kaylee read this blog? It's just something I'd like to know. But you also find yourself saying 'Natalie, if you screw that up again I'll set you on fire.'

 When Omar G., the Smallville recapper, writes webcomics, that will be the day that I jump on the bandwagon. Day Michael Jumped on the Bandwagon - urlLink Today Incidentially this is the only quote from "The West Wing" that contains the word 'monkey'. Just FYI. Erin - One 'G' in 'Zellweger'. Also there is a link to Corndog on the homepage. Go urlLink there . Or skip the middleman and go urlLink here . But you also find yourself saying 'Natalie, if you screw that up again I'll set you on fire.'

 Yo. Word. Fo' Shizzle. lol okay, sorry. I'm okay. I'm posting...yay! I'm alive! I've been reading...just too lazy to actually WRITE. You know how it is, I'm sure. So there you are! But you also find yourself saying 'Natalie, if you screw that up again I'll set you on fire.'

 Um... not much is going on in my life. But I'm posting, for it has been commanded. I saw Cold Mountain. Renee Zellwegger kicked ass and earned all the awards she has won and/or will win on Sunday, Nicole Kidman was pretty and sad, Jude Law was sad and died, and Natalie Portman made a stirring appearance as the widowed and lonely mother of the world's largest baby. (It looked about half the size she is, probably partly 'cause she's so small.) She cried and then was almost raped and then shot a guy. Hooray. Jude Law is cute but not so much so with a beard. That's about all I have to say about that. LC Players sucks. More on this later. If I'm going to read The Other Side of the Corndog, or whatever it's called, somebody has to tell me exactly what it is. Either no one's ever said or I've missed it somewhere. But you also find yourself saying 'Natalie, if you screw that up again I'll set you on fire.'

 Props to Jonah for urlLink jumping up and down on my already weak argument against euchre until it folded like a cheap card table Yes the title is kind of a blatant attempt to urlLink pimp urlLink out urlLink my urlLink site . But it's also a query for information regarding the LN blog. I've got a bit of curiosity about this and a few concerns. What is the name of the blog? Is it going to be like Alias, where we refer to it as 'the LN Blog' until Nathan decides to title? Who is Joining the LN Blog? Is Nathan going to be admin? Are the Comstocks leaving Compendium? Is Marten Joining? If Marten is joining can I join? When you get around to it, information about this would be greatly appreciated But you also find yourself saying 'Natalie, if you screw that up again I'll set you on fire.'

 I'm betting on Steve, as rabid pittbulls suck at pong. It might win at a game of snood, however. Michael, you are disqualified from the jonah's pocket sweepstakes because you had been posting. That means I get all the lint, the loot, and everything else at youth group. I must appologize for the cuelty of my parents. If it makes you feel better, I'm at my computer unable to work on my report because of my dad's horrible guitar playing. You try and think with this racket. Jonah, I don't understand the new scheme. Everyone else, post, for the Admin. commands it. So the rest of you are also Admin.s, but I am the origional. It's like vampires. I'm the Admin. King. But thats about it. I have nothing else to say. Except that I took Kaylee out to see Tech's Faculty musical! Well, technically my dad took us, as well as my sisters, but we had fun anyway. More on this later, probably in the lobby(check the new links) There are times for breaking down, and then there are times to get Funky. This is one ofthose Funky times

 Jonah, you owe me the current contents of your pocket. I've seen all the movies nominated for best picture at the Acadamy Awards this year! Ranked in Order from best to worst: Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King Mystic River Lost in Translation Seabiscuit Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World I really don't have much to say, except I have to go see Miracle because Jonah has a work ethic and Marten's parents are unsympathetic to my plight of having to go see a cheesy inspirational sports movie. I'm done. Check out the new links! -> But you also find yourself saying 'Natalie, if you screw that up again I'll set you on fire.'

 It's 10:06 and I have to be at school at 6:30 tomorrow morning, but for the love of the blog, I'm posting anyway! Let this be an example to you all. Anyway... Match up time. The monkey was eliminated after it starved to death out of fear of eating the wrong bananas. Patrick Moore tried to use his Xylophone skills to make the dancing Martians attack, but they were to caught up watching Lardman dance. Meanwhile, the snake bit Patrick, the badgers out-danced Lardman and shamed him out of the cage, and the mushrooms ate the aliens. This seemed like a shoe-in for the badger-mushroom-snake team, but the wrong bananas themselves came out of nowhere and defeated them, which goes to show you that you can't underestimate a banana (a recurring theme in my work, as Corndog readers can testify to. Next match-up: A single game of the original Pong between Steven Sondheim and a rabid pittbull. So, in other news, I finally saw Camp! . If you haven't seen it yet you don't know what you're missing. Sexual confusion, musical numbers, and big-hair are just a few reasons. Also the randomly appearing main title which is sometimes backwards. I'm going to a speech meet tomorrow to compete in Poetry. I swore I would never do that again, because the only poems I do are humorous, whereas the only poems that place are written by 7-year-olds with cancer about life in Auschwitz. And if you've got a poem like that (and 90% of them do, 70% probably have the same cancer-holocaust poem) who needs talent? Meanwhile, the three of us out to prove that it doesn't have to be depressing to be poetry get consistently creamed. Ah well. Btw, I'd encourage you all to head down to Michael's new site and post more comments that disagree with him about Euchre, but first - POST HERE!!! As in incentive, the next person to post will get a quarter or a cough drop or a piece of lint or something the next time I see them. For FREE. It's the smell of freedom... and the chemicals with which they treat your dashboard. P.S. Isn't it weird that the Blogger spell check doesn't know the word Blog?

 Tomorrow is the sixth month anniversary of the first entry at Tales from the Other Side of the Corndog. I just felt that should be pointed out. Let me be the first to extend Jonah congratulations on six months of hilarity, Norwegians and cod analogies. May there be many, many more. Jonah also has been busy elsewhere as he has taken over my old site, which has moved to a new address urlLink here I wish he would have come up with something less obvious than changing one word in the title, but hey, what can you do... Incidentially, because I know that this is going to come up, I am posting at the same rate that I normally do. You are all just posting dramatically less. Just wanted to point that out so that we don't have another "You're taking over the blog!" controversy. Just for the record: Marten last posted 11 February, Erin last posted 15 February, Sophia last posted 15 February, Nathan last posted 16 February, and Jonah last posted 10 February. Basically I'm saying post more! I'm bored and lonely here! It's the smell of freedom... and the chemicals they treat your dashboard with.

 Yay! It's my "States I've Visted" map! urlLink create your own visited states map or urlLink write about it on the open travel guide It's the smell of freedom... and the chemicals they treat your dashboard with.

 I have big news. I'm moving What Kind of Day Has it Been to a new host. I'm going to keep the archives up here at blogspot, but I'm moving the Journal part of the site to SquareSpace, where you will get to access a special section of the website. Cool, huh? But the journal is prettier and I like it a whole lot better. I'm just going to blog right here from Compendium for daily crap. I'd like to remind you of this. My site is very nice, and you might enjoy it, But you could be having sex with Yoko Ono right now! ETA: Journal is urlLink here

 I'm happy again! I'm happy again! I got the Angels in America soundtrack and a new game for PS2 so I am happy! And I'm also evil too! So I'm taking large amounts of Schadenfreude in Nathan's unfortunate haircut. And now I'm going to go sit in the basement, play video games and wait to be hit with the massive amount of inevitable Karmic backlash coming my way. ETA: Erin read urlLink this It's the recap of the episode of ER where Romano's arm got chopped off. And it's HILARIOUS! But you could be having sex with Yoko Ono right now!

 My haircut sucks. The woman cut off way to much and now I have androgynous 80's hair. I'm not in the best mood ever. Also, I'm going back to my old title scheme with slight modification. Songs from musicals, names of musicals, and quotes from musicals. It will not change again. And the good news. This is the last braces wire I'll ever wear! April 7th they come off for good! JournalCon was fun, but you could be having sex with Yoko Ono right now! And compared to that.... I still prefer JournalCon. Definately.

 Today blew. First of all it was laundry day. Secondly just as we were planning what to do today, Tim came up and started horking all over everything. So now Tim has the flu, I'm bored the hell out of my mind and I just realized I missed The Simpsons. ETA: Then I watched Alias and was happy again. Then I was sad and depressed afterwards. Now I'm kind of happy because I had pancakes for breakfast! "Guess what Flappy! I'm not going to kill you yet!" And Tim isn't sick anymore! So we're going downtown ! Erin - The whole Chicago, Chicago, Toronto thing isn't bothersome online. It's when Marten proceeds to...cackle it continuously that it grates on my nerves. Marten - Please remove your crap from my house. But you could be having sex with Yoko Ono right now!

 lol woo hoo! I'm going to be 16 in less than...uhhh...5 hours! Yayness! Happy birthday to MEEEE. Sorry guys. And i'm really sorry about JournalCon...it sounded like a lot of fun. :(. I went out to dinner with my dad for my birthday. It was nice. But you guys are nice, too. :( :( :D lol, I'm confused about my smileys. :D But you could be having sex with Yoko Ono right now!

 I only pressed post, not post and publish with that last entry, and I want to make sure it gets up, so I'm posting it again. Sorry for the inconvenience. JournalCon was fun. Even though I only sat through two episodes of Sports Night. And wasn't really paying attention to them, but rather to the journal of Anakin Skywalker, which was, well... wizard. And let me be the first person to annoy Michael and say... "Chicago Chicago Chicago Chicago Chicago TORONTO!" But you could be having sex with Yoko Ono right now!

 JournalCon was fun. Next time it'll be a day thing as sleep didn't work out well. However massive props to all of you for sitting through Season One of Sports Night. LOST & FOUND: Marten, you forgot your games and your memory card. Did anyone forget a stick of deodorant? That was fun. We really need to do it again sometime. Season Two is waiting... But you could be having sex with Yoko Ono right now!

 Alternate Title: Today's the Day! The Sun is shining, the tank is clean and we are getting--the tank is clean! THE TANK IS CLEAN! Sophia can't come. Sad. However she did get to wear a hilarious wig on LC Current so all is good. I really don't know what I'm doing here except to trumpet "JOURNALCON!" Edited to add: I remember what I wanted to say. I may be downstairs in the basement when y'all arrive. If I don't respond to the doorbell walk around back down the sidewalk, down the steps and into the back yard. I'll be there, and the door will be unlocked Hopefully, Y'all check before you come!

 I've gotten confirmation from Thomas and almost confirmation from Erin. However Thomas does not lend his name to a semi-hilarious Sports Night reference, Ergo "Erin's Coming, Hide Your Heart Girl. JournalCon. Tomorrow at Six. Michael's House. E-mail me urlLink here for additional information and stuff. PS I have Chicago . And by the way movies and stuff need to be italicized 'cause I thought Marten wanted to go to Chicago for a JournalCon, which would be...easy, now that I know the secret entrance (Stony Island Avenue!) but expensive to say the least. However it would be cool... History is about to crack wide open. Millennium Approaches.

 Huzzah! New schemes, and journalcon is finally happening. Chicago is a must at some point. For some reason I still don't own it. I also must show those of you who are familiar with Triangle and Robert, namely Nathan and Jonah, my new parody. I got bored in math and started drawing polygons, and it turned into an alternate T&R universe. Enter: Thomas and Rhombus. Its not just a crappy hack of the origional, Ive got interesting ideas, it works. just read it. Its wacky and absurd in a whole new sense of the word(s). I don't like Phillipy. I do like showing him up with well done assignments. The battle continues. History is a giant crack. Sorry, I couldn't help myself

 At the suggestion of Michael, my new title scheme is animal group names. When I run out, 'll make them up. The winner of the last match-up is Mary Poppins, which is surprising insofaras she wasn't a competitor. See, Larry ate his mount and his lance, and Helen Keller headed off in the wrong direction. Neither of them really won, so Mary Poppins was declared the winner by default, as was laid out in the original plan. The New match-up: Who would win in a steel cage death match between Patrick Moore (with Xylophone), a badger (with mushroom and optional snake), a monkey (with the wrong bananas), and Lardman (whose life is an exciting adventure). Feel free to post comments on how the match might play out or comments to the effect of "You are a silly English Kee-Niggit!" For Research: urlLink www.weebls-stuff.com and urlLink Rather Good Journalcon will be Bizzawesome I am sure, and I will be there with or without bells on, probably without. Those of you who are not reading urlLink Tales from the Other Side of the Corndog are doing yourselves a disservice. Or atleast doing me a disservice. Anyway, Erin atleast understands the importance of feedback for good writing, so read and post please. History is about to crack wide open. Hold on to something.

 Okay. Here's the plan for JournalCon. Everyone arrive at 6:00. We'll eat pizza (by the way my parents won't be home for some of the time, that does not mean that drinking or other badnesses are allowed) I'm hoping to finish season one of Sports Night. That is my goal, however if you are all bored, we can do other stuff. People need to bring snacks. Erin (if she comes) and Sophia will leave by 11:00 (at my parents behest) and we'll...do stuff. The Comstocks are coming around 9:00 so we'll watch Joan of Arcadia then. Now I know that Erin, Thomas, Sophia and Nathan are unfamiliar with Sports Night so I have compiled a quickie "previously on" segment Previously on Sports Night: Casey and Dan were Anchors, Dana was Producer, Natalie was Executive Producer, Issac was managing editor, Jeremy was...something else, Sally was the skanky ho who ran the 2:00 update. Here's where it gets complicated...Casey loves Dana, who is in love with Gordon. Natalie is hellbent on getting Dana and Casey together, however Dana is uninterested because she doesn't think that Casey is really interested in her. Natalie liked Jeremy and they were really cute together. Natalie got sexually assualted by a football player and the crew worried about the fallout, which never came. Now I also know that Jonah, Nathan, Sophia, and Thomas are unfamiliar with Joan of Arcadia so I have compiled another "previously on" segment here Previously on Joan of Arcadia: The Girardi family picked up and moved to the titular town of Arcadia, Maryland. Joan talked to God, who appeared to Joan in different (and frequently hilarious) forms, befriended Adam, an artist, and Grace, the militant...I don't know how else to describe her. The dad, Will, was a police chief, the mom, Helen, was a secretary at the school. The older brother, Kevin, was a baseball player who was injured in a car accident resulting in his being in a wheelchair. The Youngest child, Luke is a geeky kid who really reminds me of the Comstocks. Adam's Mom had died. God told Joan to do random stuff, which would benefit somebody in someway (a friend, a child, a teacher etc...) One of these things was to keep one of Adam's (the Artist's) sculptures out of the school art fair, she had a 'failure of imaginiation' and ended up smashing the sculpture with a chair. This worked out badly, as Adam came in just as she did this. So Adam and Joan had a falling out. Eventually Joan and Adam made up after Helen befriended Adam and Grace Helen and Joan intervened and helped Adam read his mom's suicide note, which was pleasant and left good ripples. So Adam and Joan kissed and the world went 'SQUEE!'. Also Grace and Luke kissed at a dance then worked together on the science fair, leading to a really cool Goldbergian sequence of events that lead to the previously mentioned kissing. So they're kind of together. Kevin got a job at a newspaper which lead to him making out with his boss, Rebecca (who is Sydney Poitier's daughter). Will discovered massive corruption at the city level and squealed to the FBI which lead to the dissolution (I think that's a word) of the Police Department. So now he's a Detective and the man who provided the information is the new police chief. Whew! Come at Six, Girls leave at Eleven, Guys leave whenever the next day. History is about to crack wide open. Millennium Approaches.

 Okay, I'm starting to think that we need to get Sophia a massive Thorazine drip. I'm sorry I missed the thespian play, I was in Chicago and I got brochures out the wazoo. However, I would enjoy watching it on video. Ha! Bwah Ha Ha Ha! Even I didn't believe that! I really don't have anything to say except that I'm blogging from the school library where there has been no appearance of the Killjoy. Thankfully. Hey! Look! It's an actual class coming in to do actual research in the actual library. You know we have about ten computer labs why don't teachers take advantage of those? By the way, links probably won't be up for a while, because I don't care that much. History is about to crack wide open. Millennium Approaches.

 Hmm...wonder why I hadn't thought of that before. Oh well. Anyways, I'm SUPER hyper, as I'm sure Nathan could ((uhhh...shoot...what's the word...)) tell. Um, yeah. So I'm alive, too, and just thought you might care to know that. Oh, and the play last night wasn't THAT bad. It was kinda funny. On the scary side of funny. haha. ::shriek:: That kind of funny. :D AAAAAGGGGGGGHHHHH!!!! IIIIITTTTTCCCCCHHHHHH!!!! History is about to crack wide open. Millennium Approaches.

 It's all Sturm's fault! He said Macbeth first! History is about to crack wide open. Millennium Approaches.

 Thats it. everyone has admin powers. Abuse them and the blog falls. The vegetable must be destroyed!

 Repairs are underway here at Compendium! I've disabled links and comments to make the page less bulky and easier to load. They will be back up after I get back from Chicago.

 Not going to be announced yet. Just popping in to say I am alive and I want to keep you in suspense a little longer. BWA-HA-HA-HA!!!! The vegetable must NOT be destroyed!

 Great Job, Nathan. You might as well have just said MacBeth! Also LNTV? Is that like announcements? Because that would just be mean. Also because it bears repeating, Start Your Own Blog. In unrelated news, Break A Leg, Erin! And Massive Props to Marten! In a completely unsurprising twist the italicization of the blog can be attributed to one Marten "Glutenous Polypeptide" Dollenger. See my post "I am on my way. When I am manifest, our work begins..." wasn't italicized when I posted it. But it was after Marten posted his silly post. So it's all Marten's fault. Also Comments are down until I get back from Chicago. Sorry!

 The new title scheme is in, it is science fiction quotes. Which means mostly Star Wars, Trek, Gate and really good Babylon 5 or Farscape or some even more obscure show. Musical songs was getting tedious. I want admin powers. If you give me admin powers, I will give you chocolate. if you don't, I will kill this innocent little llama. The choice is yours. There is now one major male part in the musical left to assign, and three guys left without parts. The other two are both dancers who can't act (or, in Micheal's[not you!] case, sing). Which means, most likely, Chad will get two parts. Barring that, I probably have it, but I really wish she'd announce it soon. I have decided not to do choir next year. I'm probably going to take LNTV instead. Good luck tonight to Marten and Erin. Nothing else to say. The vegetable must be destroyed! Cast it into the garden in which it was grown!

 I unitalicized the thing. Even with Marten gone it's just nice having somebody else with admin access. And by the way Thomas, Sophia and Erin do too. Absolute Power Absolutely Corrupts. The vegetable must be destroyed!

 I couldn't help meself, It really was Michael. I don't know how he did it. I wont have many updates, because of said play. That is all. Now back to you're regularly scheduled blogging. The vegetable must be destroyed!

 I don't anticipate many updates this week, so I'm just going to have to be clever and write posts so the awful italics (all M ichael 's fault, despite what he says. All his fault, people) will go away. I am totally in love with Tony Kushner's "Angels in America". It's a play about people, all of them flawed, living in America and either dealing with AIDS and Homosexuality on a first hand level. But despite some...bizarre content (angel sex. which is a lot creepier than it may sound. Even if the angel does look like Emma Thompson) the writing is beautiful and the play is sweeping and epic. And the angel is really cool. I'm seeing Designing Murder* on Thursday. Is it anything like Designing Women? Is it about several white southern women who have hilarious misadventures in a large house in Atlanta? Cause that would be cool. *Yes I know, It's "Design For Murder", but for the sake of the joke...

 Wow. urlLink This has to be embarrassing (The link is PG-13, yo. Don't be looking at school.)

 Erin I'd like to start out by saying 'Bitch, that giftcard's mine!' But seriously people, I am coming to see the play. Friday and Saturday, I will be at the Chicago Inter-Continental Hotel for the Chicago Auto Show. Which totally ROCKS! So anyway Jonah, Charissa and I will be there Thursday Night. Also Bingbing Chu? Really? And Erin I'm sorry for the first line, I said it in jest, please don't hurt me. The vegetable must be destroyed!

 Okay, that last post was short just so that I'd win in the contest I had going with Marten over who could post that tickets were on sale first. As far as further information goes, they are 6 and 8 dollars at the LC box office. If you buy them on Tuesday you get entered in a raffle to win a hundred dollar Simon Mall gift certificate. Design for Murder kicks ass. It has murder and intrigue and peope oozing sex and me in a wig. It's really a good play, which is why we blew everyone else out of the water at regionals yesterday. I don't want to comment on the other plays there. That would make me sad. Except to say that the straight version of the Scarlet Pimpernel was the worst one, and one of the people in the cast wore tennis shoes. In Cheaper By the Dozen almost everyone wore no shoes. And the name of one of the chorus girls in Little Shop was Bingbing Chu. I am not making this up. Stop Kemps, We're Playing Euchre!

 Tickets for the Thespian play are now on sale! Stop Kemps, We're Playing Euchre!

 Got back from Thespian regional conference last night. To sum it up, everybody sucked but us, with the exception of Why Do We Laugh, and the dentist's pants in Little shop of Horrors. I'll leave the rest of the actual plays to Erin. I signed up for an Improv workshop, which would be more fun if almost everyone didn't suck at it. Questions only was fun, though, I wiped the floor with those would-be Inquisitors. Michael -When did you see the books? Did you see my The Almost Complete Works of ? Nate -We don't constantly talk of lc teachers. I just described him, anyway, rather than just throwing him i a post expecting you to know about him. And I'm with Michael on the matter of recruitment, we have plenty of bloggers. Maybe you should start a mostly LN blog. Only you, Jonah and I even know Tyler and Paul, so you could be admin to a sort of sister blog to Compendium. An affiliate, if you will. Everyone -Buy tickets for Design for murder! Its good! details from erin, cuz she already posted it! The vegetable must be destroyed!

 I actually don't care one way or another. It just seems kinda pointless. I don't know if she'd even want to be on. It came with a matching tie, using a liberal definition of the term "matching" They're both made of fabric? Pretty much.

 Today is Ewan McGregor's birthday! Yay! Irrelevant spoiler of the day: Palpatine is the Phantom Menace! I know, you never saw it coming. But, you see, all of the dark side stuff and the crumbling of the Republic-- he engineered all of that. It was all part of his plan! He is Darth Sidious! And since he is menacing the Republic and no one knows it's him... that makes him... the Phantom Menace! Sio Bibble was a pretty good red herring, though. Next time: Anakin is WHO? It came with a matching tie, using a liberal definition of the term "matching" They're both made of fabric? Pretty much.

 Wow, in all the excitement of my last post it seems that I forgot completely about the irrelevant spoiler of the day! Let me amend that now. Who is the father of Padme's twins? Well, Threepio and Artoo were eliminated for technical reasons, although they couldn't quite understand why. To Padme's dismayed surprise, Master Yoda bowed out citing that he was a different species, although he would not disclose any further specifics. Then, after Padme had spent some time counting backwards on her fingers, Mace and the coffee guy were also eliminated. The coffee guy ran from the room in tears. Count Dooku left quietly because, let's face it, he's about eighty and he didn't want to face this kind of embarrassment. Palpatine soon followed suit. This left Anakin, Obi-Wan, Captain Typho, and George Lucas. Captain Typho was eliminated when the handmaiden Dorme jealously stepped forward and spat, "He was with ME that night." Obi-Wan and Anakin then engaged one another in a duel, while George looked on and laughed maniacally. Just when it seemed that this might go on forever, the paternity test results came back. They revealed that the father was, indeed, Anakin Skywalker. He enthusiastically embraced his wife, while over his shoulder, she and George exchanged a wink. Everything was going as planned... Next time: So, just who IS the Phantom Menace? It came with a matching tie, using a liberal definition of the term "matching" They're both made of fabric? Pretty much.

 Friday Five (Couldn't get on to do it yesterday.) 1. What was the last TV show you watched? Thomas-- Sadly enough, Everybody Loves Raymond.' Michael -- Wonderfalls, happily enough. Erin-- The last entire TV show I watched was Will and Grace on Thursday night, although I've channel surfed since then. Marten:Alias. don't watch much else, sunday is about the only time i have for tv Jonah: The People's Court (I'd never watched it before, but we didn't have cable in Florida) Nathan: Judging Amy. First episode I've ever seen part of. Had Armin Shimmerman in it. Sophia: I honestly don't remember, Friends, probably. 2. What was the last thing you complained about? Thomas-- How much of a jackass John Trippi is Michael -- How Tim wouldn't let me play Grand Theft Auto longer Erin-- My brother's drums. I'm going to set them on fire. Marten: I was hungry Jonah: The internet being down when we got back. Nathan: Jonah being on the gamecube Sophia: sunburn 3. Who was the last person you complimented and what did you say? Thomas-- My mom. "This is really good Filet Mignon." Michael -- My mom. "You're so good at puzzles." Erin-- Michael. "That is funny," or something about his LOTR comedy. Marten: "Erin, you're awsome" Jonah: One of my family members on a good pun. It was a groan, but a complimentary kind of groan. Nathan: Jonah, for a well written Mad-lib. Sophia: My friend Stevo..."You're a really cool guy..." 4. What was the last thing you threw away? Thomas-- A kleenex Michael -- The shredded remains of a twistie-tie Erin-- a post-it Marten: Paper towels from cleaning my paintball gun. Jonah: Pistachio nut shells Nathan: Guinea pig bedding Sophia: Wow, Jonah, me too!! Creepy! 5. What was the last website (besides this one) that you visited? Thomas-- www.nationstates.net Michael -- www.televisionwithoutpity.com Erin-- fanfiction.net Marten: similarminds.com Jonah: Tales from the Other Side of the Corndog (I came here before the webcomics!) Nathan: Wigu (www.wigu.com) Sophia: yahoo.com It came with a matching tie, using a liberal definition of the term "matching" They're both made of fabric? Pretty much.

 Except that it is. Happy Spring Break everybody! Woohoo! I will see many of you at JournalCon 1.5: Hobbits Gone Wild. I can name it that if I want. I got Wyrd Sisters back from Mrs. Grabill today after a long four or five-month absense! (The DaVinci Code is still out however... ) Also, Michael is reading The Light Fantastic! All in all, this is a big Discworld day for me. I'm so excited about this spring break. Aside from doing nothing, I plan to do lots of things. But don't worry, they're things that basically amount to nothing. Like working on my senior year scrapbook and my Star Wars album (I hope to bring that on Tuesday to show off, 'cause it's pretty) and I plan to attmept my very first post on fanfiction.net. I'm going to fix up Dex's Diner and stick it up to test format. Plus I'm almost done with my Velma Kelly story. And I need to finish my Ani/Padme essay. And make some headway in "Surrender." But it's all okay, because I feel like I've got a good burst of creative energy going. So everybody wish me luck! Yay! It came with a matching tie, using a liberal definition of the term "matching" They're both made of fabric? Pretty much.

 Condi Rice is urlLink pissed . And when Condi Rice gets pissed, you better run for cover 'cause she's gonna blow some mo-fo's ass up, on the G! Look out, Iran... It came with a matching tie, using a liberal definition of the term "matching" They're both made of fabric? Pretty much.

 Woohoo, I'm Delivery Man! I must only use my power for good. This is going to be awsome, and I pity you losers who can't go. So what is new for me? I switched from chemistry to latin for next year. Apparently I can't take chem unless I take algebra 2 at the same time. I'm worried about latin, though. It sounds like work, and I've already got a lot of that for AP. I might still switch to etymology, but I don't know. Latin seems interesting. It came with a matching tie, using a liberal definition of the term "matching" They're both made of fabric? Pretty much.

 As the title suggests, I'm pretty damned tired right now. I'm also posting here to announce details of JournalCon 1.5! Where: My House. I'm not putting my address here. You've been there before, you know where it is. When: 12:00 on Tuesday March 30th, 2004 Why: To Snark and write a fan-fic send-up of Lord of the Rings Who: Any Blogger in Indianapolis and not Florida or the Caribbean. Food Details: Either we can do pizza, or we can all give Marten $10 bucks and he can pick us up Panda Express. If anyone else likes that idea, IM me with your order. I recommend the Orange-Flavored Chicken. Drinks and snacks will be provided. Also: JournalCon 2: Electric Boogaloo is coming... The following is a preview of Sports Night: Season Two. Dana: Stand there. I'm gonna sack you. Jeremy: Okay, I need just another moment of your time, then you can go back to being crazy. Dana: My brother can beat up your brother. Natalie: My brother's a grad student in comparative literature. My mother could beat up my brother. Dan: Honesty for Pixley! Sam: Dana, I have been through alcohol, marriage and network television. If you want to kill me, you're gonna need some kryptonite. Casey: I didn't do the bread. Dan: What'd you do? Casey: I did what I do, Dan, I did what I do. Dan: You screwed up your romantic life in front of fifth graders? Casey: I could be like a blind detective, have my own TV show. Dana: You DO have your own TV show. Isaac: Does the porn star know you're this much of a dork? Isaac: The kid can't even walk yet. Why are we locking the medicine cabinet? Dana: Does he crawl? Isaac: Not up walls, no. Natalie: "Jeremy, one day you'll see that my love for you isn't the product of liquor-induced mood swings and that I'm yours for the taking at your command and that the day I broke up with you is the most regrettable day of my life. " Jeremy: "Okay, but I broke up with you." Natalie: "I find you loathesome, and my hatred of you knows no bounds." Dana: "That's right. My show is on. My show is on! My show is on! My show is ON!" Casey: "...with revenge on their minds they welcome the Tigers to the house that Ruth built this evening." Dan: "Excuse me, Casey, but Ruth didn't build the house this evening, did he?" Casey: "No, Dan, and thank you very much for correcting my every mistake no matter how small, oh these many years." Dan: "What are friends for?" Casey: "To annoy the hell out of you?" Dan: "Exactly." Also, just a thing. Please restrict templates to one or two lines, otherwise it ends up awkward.

 Branson, MO, is without a doubt the cheesiest city in the united states, possibly the world. This makes it absolutely perfect for a National show choir competition. I've come to the conclusion that when a person does show choir long enough, that huge cheesy smile becomes a permanent facial feature, and they can't turn it off. And having 16 choirs worth of show choir people in one place for 4 days only compounds the problem. In all seriousness, though, it was really fun in a cheesy sort of way. You know what else is true about show choirs? They tend to attract their share of, shall we say, loose women. I talked to a girl for maybe twenty minutes on Saturday before she tried to kiss me. When I told her I had a girlfriend, she immediately moved over to Cristian, stealing him from one of her friends. Yeah. Truth be told, the nicest girl I met was a lesbian. Despite all this, or maybe in part because of it, hanging out with the Chesterton girls was really fun. I also saw some amazing show choirs. I won't bore you with details, except to say that the 2nd place group did all music by Journey and it rocked. Also Kevin and Donald from Moby Dick were in the fourth place choir, and Kevin tried to show up the Ben Davis flip guy, but fell short. Literally. We ended up getting 9th out of 16, which is really not bad for us. Hip Street got 6th and won best tech crew, and Ben Davis got 2nd. Ming Chan suprised everyone by getting best female performer, despite not having any solos or being featured in any way. More later when I have time. It's good to be back. By the way, if you want to see our shows, we're doing them for the last time ever on Wednesday at 7:00. Price is $2.00.

 Haha, John Dimmick! I know him! I drove to choir with him in...8th grade? I think? So about this board, I get to be an administrator! Yay! I have no idea what to do or what kind of stuff I'd be expected to do, but I can assure you that I will do this to the best of my ability. :D And I ALSO get to be a girl. Wow. I'm so honored. And now I think I'll go shower...although you probably don't care. Oh well. Au Revoir, amigos... The sky is pink and it's raining turkeys; what more do you need?!

 Props to John Dimmick for a really really good idea that I totally just stole. I'd like to start off by saying that this post is a completely new post on a completely different day and with Marten, Thomas and Nathan out of town, it may seem like I'm posting a lot and if you're offended by this...well...bite me. The juniors (in Inter-disc) at LN have created a board to discuss...stuff. School, Current Events, Homework and other things. It's a really good idea, and now, for the first time ever, I present to you urlLink THE LC INTER-DISC/AP BOARD ! Or LCIDAPB! No actually that's a really sucky acronym. But I really, really need your help. Tell everyone who's going to be in either Inter-Disc English/US History or AP English/US History to come here and debate and chat and stuff. By the way, Marten and Thomas are my official mods. Sophia, by virtue of being a girl gets to be a girl. No wait, Sophia gets to be the other admin. The Great Work Begins... The sky is pink and it's raining turkeys; what more do you need?! (<- Someone needs to change that...)

 I love Orange-Flavored Chicken. I am officially going to marry Panda Express. Or at least buy stock in them. I saw Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, which was weird for the sake of being weird. But good. It was nice. That was a joke you would find funnier if you saw the movie. Only one Caveat emptor: the movie, despite the presence of Jim Carrey isn't terribly funny. It's funny at times. Just don't go in expecting massive hilarity, because there's not much there. However do go in with the idea that somewhere around the 1:30 mark, you're going to see Kirsten Dunst in her panties. So it's still totally worth nine bucks. Also I added a Site Meter. How many times can six people visit the same site? ' I'm gonna find out if it kills me, dammit! The sky is pink and it's raining turkeys; what more do you need?!

 Damned hypothetical questions! I've got nothing at this point. If you... 1. ...owned a restaurant, what kind of food would you serve? Sophia: probably something super-random...like tacos and ice cream! [Actually, there's a place that sells tacos and ice cream at 86th & the Monon Trail in Nora. True Story --Michael] Michael: It'd be Mediterranian cusine -- Tapas, Hummus, Pizza, Gyros and...whatever they eat in Croatia Jonah: Bagel sandwiches. It'd be like Subway meets Einstien Bros. Marten: I'd open a bar. Maybe a cafe. Nathan: Fondu! 2. ...owned a small store, what kind of merchandise would you sell? Sophia: Books. My personal favorites. :D Michael: Records, like in High Fidelity. Jonah: Stuff like they sell at Spencer Gifts, only slightly more clean. Marten:Odd but useful inventions, like toilet seat warmers and icecream scoop heaters. Nathan: I'd specialize in out of print or discontinued merchandise, for a horribly inflated price. 3. ...wrote a book, what genre would it be? Sophia: Probably a criminal psychology book...about the reason people kill or something. Michael: Sex Education...for virginal adults! Jonah: Whatever the toaster story is or else speculative fiction. Marten: Satire and odd fantasy Nathan: Sci-Fi, disguised as reference 4. ...ran a school, what would you teach? Sophia: Psychology. Michael: Martial Arts and Bagpipe Lessons Jonah: Free thinking - Kinda like Dead Poet Society Marten: I'd help Jonah Nathan: World Domination. Then when one of my pupils succeeded I'd be in his favor. Or he'd kill me so I could teach no one else. It's all good. 5. ...recorded an album, what kind of music would be on it? Sophia: Yeah, like I know that. Probably some stuff from musicals or something. Michael: Really Bad Music. Jonah: Some musical stuff, some classic rock, some Christian Rock, some instrumental jazz and a few original compositions. Marten: Jonah, you keep stealing mine! I'll add video game music to that list Nathan: Something totally new. Something that cannot be defined by an existing style, but would start a movement and revolutionize music. The sky is pink and it's raining turkeys; what more do you need?!

 Yeah, from what I hear we're definitely not doing a musical. I'm sad about that, but what can ya do? At least Haley Jensen won't be getting the lead in it. Irrelevent spoiler of the day: Not only is Padme pregnant, she's pregnant with TWINS! Next time: Who's the father? Is it Obi-Wan? Anakin? Bail Organa? Captain Typho? Mace Windu? Yoda? C-3PO? The coffee guy? George Lucas? The sky is pink and it's raining turkeys; what more do you need?!

 Jonah: You are a nice person! In any event you got your ass kicked by Marten shortly afterwards. Also the whole Claire (who I actually liked) vs. Jonah thing was kind of my idea. So some if not most of the blame lies with me. Also, I heard that we might do a musical revue instead. Which sounds bad, but then again so did the musical in drag. Also you (and Nathan) will be greatly missed at LotRJournalCon. The sky is pink and it's raining turkeys; what more do you need?!

 I am a horrible person. Those of you who were at my party may recall an incident between my friend Claire and I that ended with a slight injury to her shoulder. Well, today she's in a sling. I have no idea how it happened, I didn't push her that hard, but anyway, now I feel awful. To make matters worse, John Murray came up to me yesterday at the Jazz Band concert and said, "So, I hear you beat up Claire. Good Job." So now everyone at school thinks I just beat up girls or something. Of course, I haven't actually seen Claire, so this could be an elaborate scheme to get back at me by making me feel bad. I'll know in about 40 minutes. (I'm in Journalism now, I'll see her at lunch) Either way, I'm going full Pacifist. No more fighting for Jonah. EDIT: Yep, she's in a sling. Also, it's her birthday today. Can you believe that? Ugh. On the plus side, she's not actually mad at me. In other news, the Jazz Band concert was awesome. I wasn't planning to go, but Swathi and I decided just to stay after musical practice, go out to eat, and then go to the concert - which turned out to have not only jazz, but also dancing and food. Of course, I couldn't get Swathi to dance until the last song, but it was fun still. I also had another interesting conversation with a Ms. Oed whom some of you know. I met her at a party awhile back, but I thought she was one of those nice people I'd never see again. Given our mutual involvement in Band an Drama and our tendency to attend the performances of each other's schools, I think I'll see her again. She also shared an interesting tidbit with me: The rumor is LC will not have a musical this year. Can you guys confirm or deny? Match ups. I have to say the deaf. Sight is simply more important to basketball than sound. Even if the blind can yell their plays to each other, it's still the blind leading the blind. Next match-up: A watermelon versus a slightly larger watermelon, in a pole-vaulting competition. Marten - Kaylee wants someone's dad's shoes back and soon! It's raining turkeys; what more do you need?!?

 I'm stealing half of Marten's title scheme. Blog Quotes are now mine. It's raining turkeys; what more do you need?!

 Im so in! unless, of course, my dad steals me and puts me in a tent. I'm hoping not, since I want to get my drivers license, too. Today was great and horrible at the same time and I'll tell you why at the lobby. It's raining turkeys; what more do you need?!

 It all began with a game. The best game ever. The "Oh, Snap!" Game. This game is simple and can be played by anyone. You do a movie line, then insert the phrase. Here's an example. ANAKIN: You are in my very soul, tormenting me. PADME: Oh, snap. That wasn't the best example, but it was the first one that came to mind. So, anyway, Michael and I were just playing that game with LOTR. Then we started randomly parodying it, which turned out to be something that sounded a lot like urlLink The Shifty Troublemaker , i.e. hilarious. (You all would know that if you'd READ IT, but I digress.) So, what we want to do is a compendium LOTR MST-ish spoof. The plan is for everybody who'll be in Indy on March 30 to go to Michael's house and watch Fellowship and provide commentary. Those who won't be there will catch up later. If you're unsure about this, well... Frodo: I cannot do this alone. Sam'd go (Dance Move) I'd go (Dance Move) We'd go (Dance move). But I simply cannot do it A-LONE! [That was totally my quote. --Michael] Galadriel: You are a Ring-bearer, Frodo. To bear a Ring of Power is to be alone. I have to go, I'm being yelled at. Pointless EP III spoiler of the day: Padme's pregnant! Betcha didn't see that coming! It's raining turkeys; what more do you need?!

 I just read a year and a half of Triangle and Robert comics. Because of this, I am going to kill Marten next time I see him. Let this serve as a warning to those who try to get me to do new things. (Those who aren't reading webcomics, sometimes they're funny, but a lot of the time they aren't. Just a warning.) My teeth still hurt and nobody has posted in three days. I'm just sayin'... It's raining turkeys; what more do you need?!

 Props to Thomas for the idea for my new Template rule. The following is all caps. Please be prepared... JONAH: NO ITALICIZING THE TEMPLATE, IT COULD MALFUNCTION AND ITALICIZE EVERY SINGLE POST ON THE BLOG, DUE TO AN ERROR IN HTML CODE. NO ITALICIZATION UNLESS IT'S ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. We now return you to your regular case broadcasting. Jonah: Also, I didn't get an e-mail. Don't you like me? Also Also*, James Band? Also the Statute of Limitations** starts today, the new template (courtesy of Thomas) can be entered 21 March 2004. Also new additional good sense Template Rule: The person who entered the template identifies themselves in a post, so that no one can hog the template for two weeks in a row. Thomas has it this week, we'll randomly choose next week. * Yes I meant to double the Alsos. ** Sports Night Reference! It's raining turkeys; what more do you need?!

 It's raining turkeys; what more do you need?!

 I'm never planning a big party again. This is going to be a disaster and it'll be all my fault. Why did the two most disorganized people on the planet have to try to do this? If you don't know what I'm talking about check your e-mail for your last minute invitation. Anyway the match-up today, meaning no disrespect to either of the organizations, is a Basketball game between the Indiana School for the Deaf and the Indiana School for the Blind teams. Results of last match up: James band cleverly used the hat to convince the toothpick that he was a time traveller on his way to erase the toothpick from history. The toothpick, racing to stop him, tried to slingshot around the sun and got pulled in and incinerated. Meanwhile the hair, seeing the vest, gave up on life entirely and exploded. Bond thus saved the world once again. I went on the Monon trail today with Marten and Michael (and Sam, who deserves massive props for putting up with us). It was fun, but now I have to write the story. Ugh. BTW Marten, I still say we put the tagline in italics. This car belongs to the evil Dr. Stegman, who parks in spots that don't belong to him and finds Andrew McCarthy to be petulant and oddly short.

 It's raining turkeys; what more do you need?!

 Okay, I'm going to suggest official rules to template changes, and other things. Anyone can change the following things: Template(little thing at the bottom of each post), Description, and the Copyright thing on the side. It doesn't have to stay a copyright Details: Any of the above things may only be changed if the current setting has been there for a week(seven [7] days or more) or after fifteen (15) or more posts, no more than three per person. Exceptions made for blog member birthdays and other special occasions. sound good? oh, and maybe another unofficial rule, could we keep the templates to 1 or 2 lines in length? they get annoying to read when they're too long. This car belongs to the evil Dr. Stegman, who parks in spots that don't belong to him and finds Andrew McCarthy to be petulant and oddly short.

 Here's the quote that should be in Jonah's Monon Trail article but isn't: "The Monon Trail is for health nuts and people who like boring things." Youth Group was like I predicted, like having hot pokers shoved down my throat. Hot pokers of fun! It was actually fun, because of the pizza and the Comstockery and the fact that everyone there pretty much has ADD and Patty reminds me of every Elementary school teacher I've ever had, trying desperately (and failing to keep me on task.) Also the "Meryl Streep is the Meryl Streep of Acting!" article came from urlLink here . There's Chicago stuff for Erin there as well, which brings me to my second point. I am spoiler free for Episode Three, which is to say that I really don't give a crap one way or another, but I am a "Spoiler-Whore for Episode IV!" (It's funny because it already happened.) Thomas: Come to the Scene Shop! And Do the Friday Five! This car belongs to the evil Dr. Stegman, who parks in spots that don't belong to him and finds Andrew McCarthy to be petulant and oddly short.

 It just occurred to me that at this point I probably ought to say that you "Spoiler-Free Till Episode III" people are big losers, and I am going to torture you to your breaking point. The second web documentary is up and I have the entire plot outline. One year and two months to go. Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha. This car belongs to the evil Dr. Stegman, who parks in spots that don't belong to him and finds Andrew McCarthy to be petulant and oddly short.

 Well, I'm back from Hanover. I left for their sholarship competition stuff on Friday at about 12:30 and got home at about 4:30 yesterday. Then I went to church until 6:30 and my cousin's birthday party until 10:00. But now I'm home. I missed home. Overall, the competition went pretty well, although I'm not expecting to get more scholarship money out of it. But I stayed in a dorm with some really nice girls and, overall, it was a good experience. I hope I never have to do it again. I'll go and answer the Friday Five now, even though it's Sunday. This car belongs to the evil Dr. Stegman, who parks in spots that don't belong to him and finds Andrew McCarthy to be petulant and oddly short.

 That's a response. You still lose for not switching to LC when you had the chance. I can swing dance! I don't suck at it, either. really. I went swing dancing with Kaylee last night, it was fun. more on this at the lobby, probably not till tuesday though. Am I sexy yet?

 On the contrary, my silence is simply because I don't consider you're inane comments worth the time it would take me to write a response. Anyway, he seems like he'd be the guy who scores drugs for everyone, except there are never any drugs in musicals. He says he can get a "samurai sword" and some "grass skirts." Huh? What the hell are people into on this island?

Michael: Angel by Massive Attack Nathan: The Grand Illusion by Styx Jonah: Crucifixus by Lotti, performed by the St. Olaf Choir Marten:Confrontation from Jekyl and Hyde Erin: The Cellblock Tango from Chicago Thomas: The World Was Dancing from Songs From a New World Sophia: I Got Lost in his Arms from Annie Get Your Gun 2.

Um...Part of Sister Act II, and I have no idea. Whoops. 3. What were the last three things you purchased? Michael: A Print Cartridge, and some other stuff I can't remember. Nathan: A Used copy of Pokemon Gold, Pizza, A Cherry coke Jonah: A pack of fruit snacks, another pack of fruit snacks and a pack of cookies.

Thomas: A movie ticket and Dinner at the hockey game for Blues Band Sophia: A ticket to Mr. LC, two skirts 4. What four things do you need to do this weekend?

Marten: Work on my comic story board, go to the monon with jonah and co., Youth group, and remember what Im forgetting to do, then do it Erin: (pretending like it's Friday) Merit Scholarship interview, Merit Scholarship essay, theatre scholarship audition, psych project, psych notes Thomas: Went to Starsky and Hutch, played at an Indianapolis Ice Game (Blues Band), played at Central Sound Classic (Backup Band), and went to Youth Group.

Sophia: Mom, Anne, Kiel, David, Kent Anyway, he seems like he'd be the guy who scores drugs for everyone, except there are never any drugs in musicals. He says he can get a "samurai sword" and some "grass skirts." Huh? What the hell are people into on this island?

 I really dont like the phrase "How are you?" All the possible answers are boring and grammatically incorrect. How am I what? It's just a stupid question. Speaking of how I am, or rather waht i did, I spent my half day at the mall with Kaylee. more on this at the lobby. Props to Michael for burning the soundtrack to Lost in Translation for me. Awsome set of tunes. ( Sophia: Thanks, I owe it all to chlorine and spin-drying my hair. Michael: you're right. It would be odd. To begin with, anyway. I'm trying to imagine you in the same room with Patty and Jen Nate: I consider your silence a personal victory. Huh? What the hell are people into on this island?

 I'm having troubles with my church. Yes I know, but it's really starting to bug me. I used to help out with two/three year olds on Wednesday Nights while their parents were at Bible Study. This worked out since my parents came to help with my brothers youth group and I had tried my youth group and found it to be...well bad. It was bad. It was really really bad. It was just...bad. So I helped out and for about a year, I did that and I had fun doing it. I got to play with babies for an hour and a half, sometimes we'd go to the big playground, othertimes not. Then last November, the lady who ran the problem told me that the new senior minister (who I pretty much instantly disliked) had decided that 8:00 was too late for two/three years old, and promptly shut down the program, leaving me with two options: Bible Study (which would be awkward) or Youth Group (which would be like having hot pokers shoved down my throat). I've been going to the Bible Study for the last few weeks (which was good because unlike another program, they provide snacks and drinks, which is a good way to win my heart. And it worked. The only problem is that it's boring. It's crashingly boring. It's Sinclair-on-an-educational-tangent boring. And youth group is...loud. It's very loud. I worked in the library (that's where we started two years ago) and could feel the vibrations of loud Christian Rock music through the floor. And I am not a Christian Rock person by any stretch of the imagination. So I'm staying home tonight, and I'm trying to get out of going next week, because it's really awkward and boring, so my parents have come up with a solution (which I think is a really, really bad idea) Go to the Comstock's youth group. I'm not kidding. That is their solution. It's not that I have a problem with the Comstocks or Marten or their church, It would be awkward for me, awkward for the Comstocks and Awkward for pretty much everyone involved, Not to mention the fact that I'm not a youth group person. I'm a leave-me-alone-and-I-promise-to-tithe-for-as-long-as-I-Live person. I don't want fellowship! I want people to leave me alone! I want to go to church on Sunday Morning, sit through service, get up go home (in a perfect world, we'd stop for Panda Express on the way home. It's finger Ling-Ling Good!) I don't want to have to constantly go to church after the new minster just ripped the rug right out from under me. And then had the gall to say that in order to work child care on Sundays you have to stay for two services, one to help and one to be "Spiritually Fed". So I'm mad at stuff, and planning on ranting at my parents in Latin if I have to go next week. Anyway, he seems like he'd be the guy who scores drugs for everyone, except there are never any drugs in musicals. He says he can get a "samurai sword" and some "grass skirts." Huh? What the hell are people into on this island?

 Goodness. I think I might have died. Either that or my computer did; it's been superbly slow lately and I've just taken to ignoring the fact that I hadn't read nearly anything on here in several weeks. I'm going to try very hard to make this entry long enough to satisfy all of you critics and also to avoid the phrase "lol" to get on the good side of Michael. Happiness. Anyways, I finally put my answers for the 5 question-thing. Probably not the best, but whatever. Guess what I'm listening to! Phantom of the Opera . Yay! I really really really love opera and musicals and all that jazz. Woo, I love that movie, too. Chicago , I mean. That's a great movie and has a fantastic soundtrack. I just wish I could sing like that. And, Erin, your underwear-thing-story was fantastic. I super-loved it because it sounds like so much fun. I wish my family were like that. Haha, grandma underwear. Goodness gracious, how am I supposed to have anything worthwhile to say? I really...uh...don't like Mr. Phillipy? How's that? And, Marten, your hair looked pretty today. Hehe, nice and wavy. Anyway, he seems like he'd be the guy who scores drugs for everyone, except there are never any drugs in musicals. He says he can get a "samurai sword" and some "grass skirts." Huh? What the hell are people into on this island? (There are drugs in musicals, though. The musical, Hair, has a lot of marijuana in it, if I remember correctly.)

 I added a new template. It's a little bit long but kind of works in an odd way. It's from Wendola's South Pacific (TV Movie) recap. Sorry for excessive posting, I just discovered this now and not at 6:54:26 PM when "You know something there, General Cho? If you had a story, you'd write it. If you don't have one, shut up." went up. Anyway, he seems like he'd be the guy who scores drugs for everyone, except there are never any drugs in musicals. He says he can get a "samurai sword" and some "grass skirts." Huh? What the hell are people into on this island?

 Props to Marten for administering a well-written and well-acted smackdown. I updated What Kind of Day Has It Been. Read "Process Stories" there. I just saw a very good epsiode of Scrubs. Michael J. Fox guest starred as a doctor with obssessive compulsive disorder, who was unable to use any toilet but the one in his own house, however he conquered this fear and used the roof toilet. The message: We all need to poop on the roof. That was completely random and probably won't make sense unless you either watched the show, or saw this particular episode. I added this so Nothing ruins an evening at the movies like being struck down by the wrath of God.

 Nate, you have no right to complain about LN's Drama program, no matter how much it sucks. You had the opportunity to switch to LC. "You make every show by virtue of being male" I recall that thats why you stayed with it, simply because you can get a part sans actual acting ability. No insult to yours, but you really don't improve it by such low standards, so shut your trap about how your program sucks. Ooh, looks like you just got served. Nothing ruins an evening at the movies like being struck down by the wrath of God.

 Huh. Fitting Title, eh, Jonah ? I am really tired right now. However I am happy that everyone (except Marten, who (just did) is busy and Sophia, who apparently died ) participated in the inaugural Friday Five. This bodes well for the future. Also Erin, It's taken you this long to see Finding Nemo? Wow...that's sad. By the way I have JournalCon news. It is tentatively set for the 30th of April (provided the Comstocks don't bail) and will double as Michael's birthday, so bring presents ( urlLink HINT urlLink HINT ) Wow, there is quite a bit of html in that sentence! Woo!The plan for this JournalCon are to push through the last season of Sports Night AKA Dan Rydell's (nonsensical and badly plotted) spiral into MADNESS! But then we're going to do MovieJournalCon! Everyone Bring Two Favorite Movies, which will lend themselves well to commentary, of which we will watch some if not all! Please nothing R or starring Pauly Shore. Also Yayness on my second new reader! Someone from the University of Maryland accessed my site! YAY! Nothing ruins an evening at the movies like being struck down by the wrath of God.

 Um, yeah, sorry about the "ass comment." It means that you pulled it out of thin air or off the top of your head. Still, bad wording on my part. A mystery has been solved. If any of you ever watched Renee Zelwegger receive an award and thought, "Who the hell is John Carabino?" the answer is, he's her manager. Not her personal self-esteem booster as I had previously conjectured. I've seen Finding Nemo now. It rocks. Also, I have convinced my dad to watch Chicago. He hasn't yet, but he will. Nothing ruins an evening at the movies like being struck down by the wrath of God.

 Props to Ryan in Chicago, the first person outside the state of Indiana to visit my site. I liked the show. I'm not going to jump up and down on it like I did with "Once in a Lifetime", I just have a few comments. The Comstocks officially rocked the party. I have to talk about the singing (Remember I showed up at 7:00 so I missed "Agony") The entire youth group came out, half of them looked disinterested, the other half was shuffling around so much, and it made me wonder if this group had ever sang in front of people before. The Twilight Zone/Outer Limits sketch was funny. It pretty much wiped away the...wait, we're being nice...ummm...It was good! The Circle of Life was Fishcakes to the nth degree. I couldn't tell if the girl was even singing. What Line is it Anyhow was...It was bad. I'm sorry, but I was at the Comstock Birthday Party, and I know that Marten, Thomas, Nathan and Jonah are much much better than what the did here. Thomas managed to liven up his role, but Nathan's Jekyll/Hyde Newscaster was just...not very good, Jonah did okay with his role, which was a huge shoutout to Sports Night's Casey McCall. It was bad, but better than a Horatio Sanz skit on SNL. Which is indeed, a good thing. Levi and Colin were great doing "Masterpiece Theatre", my only comment is that there was a passing reference to the "New York City Capitol Building", which would be...wrong. Unless it was intended, in which case, Bully For You! The Piano playing of How Beautiful was extemely good. Massive Props to Jennifer! Which brings me to the finalé, Stomp. I am not a fan of Stomp, it's fun when it begins but after five minutes the gimmick wears off, and you're sitting in a theatre listening to forty grown men drum on trashcans for two hours. The gimmick did wear off soon after the beginning, however it was masterfully done, with no visible mistakes. I was really surprised since I thought this would immediately crash and burn, but it didn't, which is also a good thing. It was a good show, I had the same problem with it as I do with SNL, which is too many musical numbers and not enough skits. But still very, very good. Please don't hurt me. Also I accidentially took my brothers medication, which is disconcerting me. I now realize why he is so screwed up! It's the pills! I pulled a muscle in my back today. I'm tired now and need to go to bed. Goodnight and have a pleasant tomorrow! That's Adorable! Justice makes it giggle!

 Oh, come on, Erin! At least you have a group like that. We have one year of Theatre overcrowded with people who don't want to be there, but need a fine arts credit to graduate, a program with no funding and a teacher who's opposed to backdrops and sets because they "distract from the actors". You make every show by virtue of being male, and we still have to have one guy play Mercutio and Escalus. And we can't even afford to give him two different costumes! We're a joke. Seriously, you have no right to complain about your drama program. The talent show went better than expected. Which isn't all that good considering I expected it to crash and burn. But it didn't. Which is good. Show choir has me in a permanently comatose state. I still refuse to yield to the coffee. Love the vest. That's Adorable! Justice makes it giggle!

 Just got done with the CPC talent show. It went well for a show that had never actually been run prior to performance. Thomas, you may remove the hat of shame and replace it with your trendy new hat, but keep it handy in case it ever becomes needed again. The hat shall become the voice of justice for the chaotic crime-ridden blog! Or something. On to match-ups. Last we had a super intelligent toothpick vs Alex Trebeck's hair in a world domination competition. We never could have imagined they'd join forces to create the ultimate evil. So the next match will be James bond, equipped only with Thomas's new hat and my new vest, vs the Axis of Evil (the toothpick and the hair) Should be interesting. And about this vest. I just purchased it at Goodwill and it is, in Layman's terms, cultural syncretism. (Just my little LN joke) Seriously in layman's terms, it is simply hideous. Orange, green, and red plaid with cylindrical wooden buttons. It will go perfectly with my purple shirt. BTW, Erin: Thank you for reading my story. As a fellow writer of fiction, your opinion means much to me, the whole ass thing aside. That's Adorable! Justice makes it giggle!

 And if you're angry at me, well, you've got a lot of company. I'm going to explain all this. There's a website called "Friday Five" where they pose interesting and somewhat personal questions, and it would serve as a good way for all of you to know me better. Also feel free to edit your answers into the post. Or don't. I really don't care that much. But without further ado, The Inaugural Friday Five. What was... 1. ...your first grade teacher's name? Michael: Mrs. Vittori. She liked bunnies. Jonah: I can't remember her name, but I can see her face. She taught at Hancock Elementary in Minnesota. The school's idea of an accelerated program was to pull Caitlin Ngam and I out of class every other hour so we wouldn't be learning stuff we already knew. Nathan: Mrs. Fox. Thinking back, I don't think she enjoyed having me in her class all that much. I was too smart for her. Thomas: Ms. King. Great teacher, taught me how to handle me math. Erin: Mrs. Bainter, my second grade teacher. She maintained that I was the best writer she'd ever taught. Marten:Mrs. Haase. She loved me, and probably contributed to my giant ego Sophia: I have no idea...can't remember that far ago! I remember it was my last year at Crooked Creek Elementary School, though. 2. ...your favorite Saturday morning cartoon? Michael: Pokémon, when I was in 5th grade, but now I enjoy sleep. Oh! Sonic the Hedgehog! That's it! Jonah: I don't watch them so much, but I have to say Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Nathan: Captain Planet, all the way! Thomas: Batman!!!!! That was my first word. Teenage Mustant Ninja turtles gets and extremely close second. Erin: Alvin and the Chipmunks! The hyped-up '80's version. I liked the episodes with the girls in them. Brittany the Chipette was my idol. Marten: I miss anamaniacs and freakazoid Sophia: I was a super-fan of Recess. 3. ...the name of your very first best friend? Michael: Eric Oxyang in Yorba Linda. Jonah: Nathan. 'Nough said. Nathan: Jonah. Ditto. Thomas Fowler: Andrew Clarke (From my old-school Chicago days) Erin: Probably Jessica Diefenbach, because our parents were friends, but I don't remember much of that. Marten: Louis. introduced me to randomness at age six Sophia: Kelly Roeder...best friend since 2nd grade. Yay. 4. ...your favorite breakfast cereal? Michael: Lucky Charms. Marshmallows all the way! Jonah: I love Quaker Oat Squares. Also Waffle Crisp. Nathan: Raisin Bran is a classic Thomas: Cinnamon Toast Crunch is the best cereal ever. Erin: Honey Nut Cheerios. With strawberries in. Marten: Reeses! Sophia: mmm...frosted mini wheats with strawberries. Yummy. 5. ...your favorite thing to do after school? Michael: Putter around the internet. Or occiasionally play PS2 and watch The Ellen DeGeneres Show. Jonah: Eat, check webcomics, update blogs. Nathan: By the time I get home, sleep. Thomas: Watch tv, and game like the shrubnip I am. Erin: Either get online or watch snippets of my DVDs. I can only do these things if my brother's not home, though, because he gets online before me and makes fun of my DVDs. Marten:videogames or sleep Sophia: SLEEP! That's Adorable! Justice makes it giggle!

 Yay, Thomas posted! I'm so proud! Well, I am all caught up reading a little piece of narrative genius entitled "The New Toaster" and have duly commented. Everyone cheer, do the hokey pokey, and turn yourselves around. I have been asked to actually follow up on my earlier comment, "LC Players sucks." This is why it sucks. We have no money and we get no time to do anything. Horrigan never gives us enough time to rehearse stuff. We have a performance on Tuesday, and what did we spend last Monday doing? Playing random waste-of-time improv games! And then she has the nerve to criticize how I blocked the play after having me block about half of it in one class period. Grrr. But it's all cool, because I got to be in the senior Lyceum picture! :) Important news! The fanfiction.net search is working again, so everybody go there and type in The Shifty Troublemaker. Remember, that SW humor parody script with drug-induced penguins I keep talking about? If you haven't read it yet, read it. If you have, then review it so that it may get updated and finished! It's funny, I promise! That's Adorable! Justice makes it giggle!

 Had the Ball State choir competition today. Ben McGill and I are in backup for Sweet Sensation, the LC women's show choir. The choir unexpectedly got second placed, beating out LN's Hip Street, which usuallly dominates. We also unexpectedly got best back up band, along with Central Sound's band getting best backup band. This means an LC backup band sweep. Huzzah!! Nathan's Concert Choir was screwed out of victory. How did the judges not choose a choir that sings a part in French? On to my rockin' new hat. It is a nifty hat that is used for the German reenacting unit that Marten and I do. It is blue and yellow and looks like those hats that people used to wear with pajamas.

 look whos overposting! Look who's a Jackass! --Michael That's Adorable! Justice makes it giggle!

 I've been thinking about DVDs. This summer, Six Feet Under: Season Two, Angels in America, and The West Wing: Season Two all come out. Alias: Season Three comes out next September. They haven't even finished the season, and we already have a release date! I'm really excited. I really don't have anything to say, besides that I really want DVDs, and I want them now. Is it May yet?

 Okay, I am sorry I brought it up and I'm sorry I ran the whole 'Marten has hairy legs' thing into the ground. Let us all agree to agree, that Marten indeed has hairy legs and nobody ever should ever talk about Marten's hairy legs again. Or anybody's legs. In fact, let's keep discussion of body parts and/or hair to a minimum, Okay?

 I'm tired. Everyone, please fix the blog before general doom befalls you. Process Stories will be up tomorrow. I really don't have anything to say. I'm sleepy, cause of Algebra, and I'm almost out of lunch money. Also, the entry was totally about puberty. It arrests this war, his disonore of the main extremities of the title!

 Lost in Translation rules! So does admin power! It arrests this war, his disonore of the main extremities of the title!

 urlLink Inside of the can Jonah and Nathan and they are are 16 here. Very very fortunate person of the anniversary, this. First off, No one cares about your birthday, Nathan. It's all about Jonah. Like on ER how it's all about Abby, or how The West Wing is all about Josh and Toby this year. Of course, I am being sarcastic... Also Jonah, It was very very funny. I laughed like this, "HA HA HA HA HA Change it back.". (Retribution for Monday is below) Read Marten's disturbing leg hair/puberty entry of at The Taj Malobby! And Process Stories should be up by Friday! leg hiar was a meanwhile with nothing to do with the entry whatsoever! Its not a pubert entry! Stop this war! Shame on you, Hobbits!

 It's my birthday, too. I was at school for 14 hours, though, and my only gifts were a Kiwi, a hat, and a tire gauge. Ashley gave me a birthday Kiwi. We also invented competitive tutoring. More on that when I'm not tired. Stop this war! Shame on you, Hobbits!

 Oscar Follow-up. Lord of the Rings won and won and won. Marcia Gay Harden and Liv Tyler had really bad hair. The camera stayed on Jamie Lee Curtis's chest. Read the Teevee.org blog urlLink here . They don't coin the term "Combover of Shame" to describe Liv Tyler's hair (That was Marten) but they were pretty damn funny. Stop this war! Shame on you, Hobbits!

 That's not an animal group! you may say. To which I reply, It's my birthday, I can do whatever I want! Up to and including renaming the blog! And posting with no actual content! And excessive use of exclamation points!!! All these things are perfectly permissible because, as I have stated IT"S MY BIRTHDAY!!!! WOOO!!! Stop this war! Shame on you, Hobbits!

 Tyler Rudd, Yay or Nay? (Let's putting all this crap in one post so that we can delete it without much fuss if he joins. Just edit it in, like with the Friday Five.) Erin: Yeah, sure, why not. Jonah: Fear the Orange, Mortals. And fear the orange mortals. [After many intense hours translating this with those people who translate at the United Nations, we are ready to declare this a yea. --Michael] Marten: Yay! Michael: Yay. I'm for the bringing of Tyler if for no other reason than the fact that it will make Nathan shut the hell up about hiring people. Although the blog has been more frequently updated with Paul and Rachel and the new (and Frequent!) postings of Thomas. Nathan: Yay. Paul: Rachel: Sophia: Yeah! Another person who will cover up the fact that I'm too lazy to post! Thomas: This is the way we wash our pants! Laurence Fishburne: Yay. Mr. T: I pity the foo who won't let Tyler join. Donald Trump: He's Fired. The Friday Five will be up again, they just haven't updated for a while on the homepage. Oh my God, you're putting my mother's cats on the Supreme Court.

 Erin, what I meant was I thought it would be weird for you. I have no problem with it. But I've found that for the most part my friends who have graduated don't want to hang out with sophomores and juniors as much. Sorry if I offended you. I know you said no more people, but I'd really like to invite Tyler to join. He's going to being going to Indiana Academy next year and we won't see much of him. Plus Pyler is incomplete without Taul. He probably wouldn't post much anyway. Just to consider. Oh my God, you're putting my mother's cats on the Supreme Court.

 Or "Things I'm Irrationally Pissed At, Part Two" The return of the Killjoy : She's taking a late lunch break today, so right now she's standing behind the desk chatting with the other librarian, the one who denied me urlLink the SRT pass . There are actually a few people sitting in the back, despite the fact that a class is coming in here soon. Mr. Hall : What can you say about Hall. He's annoying, loud, gay, has the most annoying accent of all time, narrowly beating out Melissa George's OmniAccent on Alias. The only non-assy thing he's done all year is not shoot down my Persuasive Speech Proposal. I'll be posting that as a separate piece (heh.) on What Kind of Day Has It Been, after I give it May 18th. I don't want Hall to google it and think that I stole it. Career Day : It sucked. Sophia, Rachel, Thomas, Marten and I stand together in solidarity on this one. Ya-Ya! Thomas, who by far had the worst experience will write about his thing once he gets back from Chicago and he'll cover Government and Social Services in that post, (we had the same pick!) though I will say that it was much more urlLink Third Watch than urlLink The West Wing . Now I will talk about my second session, which was Engineering, proctored by Richard "Math Teacher With A Big Old Stick Up His Butt" Britton. The engineer was boring, and cussed a lot for a career day presentation (Hell twice, Dumbass once), and pissed the Architect off more than a little when he name dropped that the Architect worked on John Mellencamp's house. Mellencamp? Woo-fucking-Hoo. The Architect was more boring than...Something really boring. He had a picture of what quite possibly could have been the ugliest building ever designed and showed us a design for the house of arich realtor who could not be named (There was a monogrammed TC or possibly CT on there, if you actually care to find out.) That's what prompted the dumbass crack. Okay I'm going to go now. JournalCon is set for 5:30 PM, May 7th, which is my birthday so any presents that you would bring could very well buy my eternal love and a spot in the Penthouse Suite of my Heart (Right off the Left Ventricle!). Oh my God, you're putting my mother's cats on the Supreme Court.

 Erin, no one's trying to replace you. Nate was just curious, though a bit stupid. How exactly would that be weird? Meanwhile, I've been considering tossing my current schedule out the window and graduating early. Even though I wouldn't, because I couldn't survive and still be Marten. I'd probably come out as, I dunno, martin or something. Paul: somewhere around here are rules about title schemes, which you have suddenly followed by accident after stopping the book one, (Which is Erin's) and you have to keep the template in your post. After the current one has been in use for a week, you can change it. look in the archives for rules I'm forgetting. Meanwhile, the post ratio has gone a bit off for our most elusive members. Thomas has posted twice within a week, but where's Sophia? Oh my God, you're putting my mother's cats on the Supreme Court.

 Am now reading Bridget Jones's Diary and am having trouble reinserting pronouns, etc. into vocabulary. Welcome to Paul! Well, it seems since one was last online and not too busy to blog, great irrelevent things have happend, much political murmuring has taken place, a new blogger has unknowingly tried to steal one's title scheme without any rebuke, and it has been suggested that after graduation one ought to just go away and not speak to any of you ever again. One feels miffed. I think that all of you should know that Frieje is just doing the hall sweep thing because when Dr. Hodgin was visiting he saw four fights in the hall, which is just sad. And Frieje is not any kind of asshole, just rather misguided. He is far superior to Hanna because he at least knows and cares about what's going on. I won't argue that the hall sweeps are dumb, but they probably wont last. And even if they do, well-- I won't be there. Aha! Ahahahahahaha! Michael didn't know about my Arthurian obsession and came under the impression that I have a girl crush on Keira Knightley. Oh, dear. Really, I was just looking at the costume and metalwork; I'd have been staring at Clive Owen or anyone else just as hard. I have decided that the new King Arthur movie should really be called, "Bend It Like Boudicca." And this, in fact, is how into the dark ages Britain/ Arthurian thing I am. Boudicca was a real, historical Celtic warrior queen. When the Romans invaded, I think about 400 years or so before Arthur time, Boudicca's daughters (and maybe her, I forget) were raped by Roman soldiers and she vowed revenge. She actually mounted an offensive that came the closest of any British attempt at driving the Romans out of Britain-- she was certainly the only one who gave them a real run for their money-- and she actually fought with the soldiers and everything. If I remember correctly, she drove them all the way down to the southern portion of the island... But that's just digression. What I'm wondering now is things like, will they use some copy of the Sutton Hoo helmet somewhere, as it's so popular with dark ages things; what does the guy who plays Lancelot look like, his name is very Welsh-- Gruffydd, or something; is the Merlin they're using old Merlin or young Mary Stewart-type Merlin; are they putting in any of the other cool female figures, e.g. Morgan and Nimue. I'll stop now. They have not taken away Senior Skip-a-Final, you uninformed ninnies! Irrelevant spoiler of the day: Correct me if I'm wrong, I don't think I posted a teaser last time. So today's spoiler is-- In Ep. III, Obi-Wan wields... a lightsaber. It is the traditional weapon of the Jedi Knight-- not as clumsy or random as a blaster, an elegant weapon. It's a sword made of light, a laser sword! (hehe, "laser sword") Must do homework now. Oh my God, you're putting my mother's cats on the Supreme Court.

 Hall sweeps are a new policy at LC. Upon the ringing of the bell, the teacher's will close and lock their doors, and those people who are not in class, will be metaphorically swept into the Auditorium, where they will be yelled and bitched at about the importance of being punctual. JournalCon is in one week, at my house. Erin, Rachel and Sophia are invited, but due to prudish parents, cannot participate in the sleepover. Food will be provided, however any donations would be appreciated. Also, Paul: Respect the template. Keep it in your posts. Oh my God, you're putting my mother's cats on the Supreme Court.

 The World History AP test is really scaring me. The test is on Wednesday, we still have 85 years of history and two world wars to cover, not to mention all the stuff we skipped along the way, yet Leonhart thought it a good idea to spend the period watching a video on and having a discussion of African colonialism. In short, he's doing nothing to advance the curriculum for those of us taking the test. Part of the problem, of course, is that the test comes way to early in the year, but still, we need to be cramming, not just continueing as if we had all year. Can someone explain to me exactly what these "Hall Sweeps" are? I've heard nothing about them at LN. Yesterday in class Leonhart was talking about African colonialism, and he compared the French colonial government to the SAC, saying that there was a ruling council of Africans, but they had no power. It's worth noting, though, that Ms. Lupold consulted them on the changes they were planning to the Skip-a-final policy. I don't know if she'll take any of the advice she gave, but still, they were consulted on something important. Is Erin gonna keep blogging here from Hanover? I'm just curios, it seems like it would be kind of strange. Vote on the Democrats, or you will have elected either Daniel or Duck man by default. Oh my God, you're putting my mother's cats on the Supreme Court.

 I used Ms. Means in this one because she said it. She was talking about the musical and how if we didn't do such-and-such everyone would leave. Anyway, I just want to say that I am oblivious to Hall Sweeps because I have a press pass! I am awesome! I do like the protest idea, but I think instead of doing it I'll put on my press pass and interview people about it. Protestors always like to be in the paper. Anyway, I need to go to bed so I will make a real update later. Oh my God, you're putting my mother's cats on the Supreme Court.

 I have several not very important things to adress. First, I am changing my title scheme to the flavor text from my magic cards. Second, I feel for Michael and the other LC people and would be willing to coordinate an LN "sit down" protest at the exact same time. And thirdly, for those of you who don't know Tyler Rudd, we have reconfigured ourselves into Pyler and Taul. That is all.

 I now hate Frieji. From now on I am intentionally misspelling his name. I am now making a list of things he obviously doesn't know: 1. We're a highschool, not a middleschool, jail, concentration camp, or the like. 2. Students will often be late for valid reasons and proper passes, while distributed, haven't done much. 3. The Principal isn't supposed to do anything! Hasn't he heard of Mrs. Hannah? I think the man's definately over-compensating 4. Getting swept is just going to make the student later. It's not going to speed anything up 5. It leads to stupid people doing stupid things in protest, when they're the ones who actually deserve it and aren't going to help any with their lame attempts at "fighting the power." Okay, redundant rant complete, on to business. Thomas, that conversation is reminiscent of the monkey story. How come I'm never around for those? I smell chicken! c'mon, some one keep going... darn it. nothing ever happens around here Oh my God, you're putting my mother's cats on the Supreme Court.

 All you Fall Creekrians weren't at Belzer for the time of the hallsweeps. They were just damn irritating and didn't actually improve anything. For me, the hallsweeps not only seem to be wreaking of the Gestapo, but also seem like we are reverting back to middle school tactics. I am in full support of Michael's proposed "sit down" protest. In the meantime, don't get swept. -Oh my God, you're putting my mother's cats on the Supreme Court.

 I don't know, as much as I am hating Freije, the hall sweeps reek of Burden and Brouwer. And maybe the Dean who's name eludes me right now. And I think I've seen the signs, like Tuck the Feachers and Hallsweeps Promote Drugs, which is built on extremely shaky logic. Oh my God, you're putting my mother's cats on the Supreme Court.

 Michael I totally agree with you about our newly turned communist school. It's lunatic! Some of my friends have put up signs, but I think the administrations has been tearing them down before anyone is even able to see them...gah! I thought Mr. Freiji was supposed to be cool!!!!!!!! Oh my God, you're putting my mother's cats on the Supreme Court.

 Or "Things I'm Irrationally Pissed At, Part One: School" SAC Elections : What is the point of SAC elections? They drag me from SRT, put me in the auditorium and have me vote. The voting however is moot, because in every category (except Student Body President) there is only one person running. It was Pre-War Iraq! One person (I won't mention names) I didn't vote for (even though he was the only person running) because he looked like he was hit in the face with the concave side of a shovel. I voted for one person because her name was funny (and because her opponent who promised candy, didn't deliver) and I voted for Spud, because he's cool. And this in reality is not an election, it's a popularity contest. Any given Sophmore's interest in the electoral process is minimal, if present at all. And it's not like the SAC does anything terribly difficult. They don't have to decide to bomb North Central in a pre-emptive strike, they help with charity, sell pizza and plan dances. I care about one of those three things. ONE. I'm not likely to care who student body vice-treasurer is. Hall Sweeps : Hall Sweeps are evil and Frejie is a tiny impotent Nazi with a bug up his butt the size of an emu. And the multiple SRT bells are mondo annoying if you're trying to nap during SRT. I think someone should organize a school sit-down where every person leaves their class, and five minutes into the passing period, sits down wherever in the school they happen to be. What are they going to do, write everyone up? This leads into my next topic... Idiotic Bitchy Administrators : It's amazing how they can't put two and two together and figure out that by eliminating perks (McTravel, Senior Skip-A-Final) school spirit goes down. Huh, it's amazing how that works, eh? and regarding CD Players: I want to listen to my iPod during frigging SRT! I'm at the point where I'm ready to hand out bribes to the staff, just so I can hear some Massive Attack during passing periods! I'm irrationally pissed as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore! Oh my God, you're putting my mother's cats on the Supreme Court.

The Squid3188: that's why he bit off your toe Tofig36: he doesn't deserve mambo in his name The Squid3188: It's a family name Tofig36: I refuse to include it Tofig36: its also a name in my family Tofig36: we should shut Reuben up for good if you ask me The Squid3188: His mother was eggplant mambo woman the third, her mother was eggplant mambo woman the second, and her mother was eggplant mambo woman The Squid3188: it wasn't his fault he was born male The Squid3188: Reuben is still useful to us The Squid3188: he can take the heat when we unveil the machine Tofig36: drammit Tofig36: that bloody machine has just been one big thorn in our side The Squid3188: but I think we can get your toe back Tofig36: and then that bastard Reuben Tofig36: how?

The Squid3188: which can under the right circumstances grow toes onto people Tofig36: But isn't that designed to detect frogs? The Squid3188: well yes, but that's why they discontinued it The Squid3188: if you hook it up to a toaster and shoot it full of gamma rays it does the darndest things Tofig36: interesting, I never would have guessed Tofig36: How did Shibs get his grubby hands on one? The Squid3188: how do you think? Tofig36: Oh... it's like that then. The Squid3188: yep The Squid3188: fish sticks and everything The Squid3188: right in the middle of Wal-mart Tofig36: That poor guard and with all those fishsticks The Squid3188: indeed The Squid3188: but the point is he has one, and he owes me a favor Tofig36: excellent! Tofig36: when shall we do it then? The Squid3188: next Thursday? Tofig36: sure Tofig36: ok back to the machine schematics The Squid3188: well, I was working on assembling the aft frizzulator The Squid3188: and I noticed that we're using polyfumerate for the cogs The Squid3188: wouldn't poly carbonate fumates be more wind resistant> The Squid3188: ? Tofig36: true, but the polyfumerate will make the deflemulagtor nearly indestructable The Squid3188: isn't that a good thing? Tofig36: yes so that is why we are using polyfumerates of polycarbonates The Squid3188: oh, right The Squid3188: suppose reinforced the polyfumerates with ubnium, just in case Tofig36: Excellent idea! The Squid3188: ok Tofig36: we could also use the excess ubnium to reinforce the Loanamatron The Squid3188: well, I'll go finish that up The Squid3188: no, it'll make it weigh too much Tofig36: good point The Squid3188: if the Loanamatron is over 12 kilos the whole thing we'll explode when we turn it on The Squid3188: eill explode The Squid3188: *will The Squid3188: we won't explode Tofig36: All that work would be gone... The Squid3188: yeah Tofig36: alright you best get working The Squid3188: indeed -Oh my God, you're putting my mother's cats on the Supreme Court.

 I have decided on a title scheme, quotes from whatever book I am reading. which is right now The Jungle, by Upton Sinclaire. Oh and I am not a little mofo cough*Michael*cough, I'm quite a big mofo.

 Oh my God, you're putting my mother's cats on the Supreme Court.

 Paul is in the house! That's really awesome, we're really happy, get ye a title scheme. Actually after telling people that you actually made it onto the blog, I was responded with two 'awesome's and one 'what the hell is that little mofo doing here.' I won't *cough* Erin *cough* mention any names, but it's too bad that there's still such evil in this world. I don't remember what else I was going to- THOMAS! I HAVE TO GO! Oh my God, you're putting my mother's cats on the Supreme Court.

 At last, after significant delays which I will mention later, I am in the blog. You may refer to me as the all knowing and all powerful walnut, speaking through my mind slave Paul. Paul would like to note that his computer was most likely designed to to torment his imortal soul. He relishes the idea of climbing on his roof and throwing his computer in the air and shooting it with a shotgun or other projectile weapon. But, if he did that he would have no computer, plus climbing on top of his house with a computer over his back is too strenuous for Paul. Anyway, I am glad to be in the blog to rant about my plans for world domination and Paul's titanic struggle with his neighbor's cat.

 Hurray for Patrick Shaughnessy! Okay, explaination of random post. I was really bored, past the point of Prozac the Bear crazy. Everything after the greenday song are excerpts from song lyrics I wrote for "Searching for Sammy" which may or may not end up an actual band. nifty is it not? I sleep now. Toasters don't play tunes, they cook bread

 Okay, I've got stuff to tell you! The Sky is Blue! Playgrounds are Fun! Grandpa is Old! Seriously, Nathan is more like his urlLink brother than he'd like to think. See "Yaargh!" Nathan: I'll put you down for St. John's (Newfoundland?), but I've got to say A.) You are more in need of a night in Atlantic City than any man I've met and B.) You missed perfect opportunity to use "Dark was the Night, Cold was the Ground" as a title. Marten: The random post was strange, but by "FIN!" you had me. Nothing gets me more than mock-art-film endings. Erin: I'm putting you down for a seat in Taxxgrrl's car to the Lafayette TWoPCON. Jonah: Your new title scheme is good, but you're going to run out of people and I'm going to laugh. Oh my God, you're putting my mother's cats on the Supreme Court.

 What a rotten day! I feel like screaming and strangling myself. I got one of my worst report cards ever, then mamaged to lose $600 worth of orthodontic equipment. I seriously feel like hitting my self repeatedly with a large rock and screaming at the top of my lungs. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The Betty-one looks drowsy!

 WAWEWOWUWIWY!!!! GAGAGA! YAR! I be bored. this is my nonsense bored entry. I get to make one once a..a.... something. new feature for everyone. WEEGOOWEEGOOOFISH Death to Moby Dick, I'm Thomas! DECK THE HARRS WIT BERRS OFF HORRY FARARARARARARARA! What, you think you some sort of jedi, with your jedi clothes, and your jedi weapon?THIS IS OUR ONCE A YEAR DAY! her is. I've got two turn tables and a microphone. What goes around comes back! This is a public service anouncement, this is only a test! Emergency Evacuation Protest! Don't Get me wrong, its nice to be needed once in awhile! The greatest Reward in the world is to see you beautiful smile! I was Wandring around, I was searching the town I was looking for someone but they wouldn't be found. FIN! The Betty-one looks drowsy!

 I haven't done much over at What Kind of Day Has It Been. I've got some prewritten entries that I don't want to type because I'm lazy. However I am doing Celebrated Weekend articles for a few weeks. What is Celebrated Weekend? I'm glad you asked: American Airlines' inflight magazine runs a regular feature where a celebrity will talk about their favorite city and what they like to do there, where they like to eat and stay. For example, "Martin Sheen's Las Vegas" or "Kiefer Sutherland's Toronto" I thought, "Why don't I do something like that." So I'm doing them about the Compendium gang! So far I have "Thomas Fowler's Chicago", "Sophia Jacobs' Ireland", "Michael Christie's Los Angeles", "Marten Dollenger's Kalamazoo" and "Erin Chandler's Orlando". [You can add Nathan Comstock's St. John's] I'll do these again around this time next year. Hopefully we all can go to many great places between now and then! The Betty-one looks drowsy!

 For Easter I got the Pirates of the Caribbean DVD. Keira Knightley cracks me up. She does commentary the way I do commentary. Randomly. In the past few days I have learned a great deal from visiting the Royal Handmaiden Society website. I'm sure I've shared many of them with you. Like that Ani can't count, and Yané is silly, and Hayden tripped over a nightgown and Artoo fell over a lot. They also have a music video which is really pretty and is scored with an instrumental song, but if you play it while listening to "Into the West," it fits with that amazingly well. I'm in a good mood because of Keira and because Dex's Diner just got reviewed by Kazzy, a fanfic author I greatly admire and whom I review all the time. She must've been like, "Who the hell IS this?" and read my profile and checked out Dex. And the review was favorable, and the gods have smiled upon me. Yay! I vote for the Duck Man! He's a very intelligent guy, really. He would be great at the job. "Mr. President, what are you going to do about the war?" "What war?" "The taxes?" "What taxes?" Actually, he probably would realize and acknowledge the existence of those things. And give money to beggars, help with unemployment, etc. But imagine the press conferences. "Mr. President, about this duck on your head..." "What duck?" "Can we quote you on that?" If the term "secretary" is outdated, why isn't Colin Powell referred to as Administrative Professional of State? Irrelevant Spoiler of the Day: Wait, I have to look up what I said it was going to be... blah blah blah... oh, yes. Do any Jedi survive the dreaded "Jedi Purge," or, as Thomas would have it, Jedi Porridge? Yes. Obi-Wan survives; I'll give you three guesses as to where he ends up. Hint: It's hot and sandy and IN EVERY FORCEDAMN MOVIE. Master Yoda also survives and gets as far away from aforementioned planet and the spawn of Anakin as possible. A wise one, that Yoda. The Betty-one looks drowsy!

 Three seperate posts in the course of ten minutes! What are the chances?

 If you couldn't understand the last one take heart, for I have a new title scheme: Prospective autobiography titles! I'm thinking mostly for me, but some might be for you guys or other people entirely! Anyway, the Pajama Game is now over. Thanks to all of you who came, came to half of it, would have come if you'd known the right time and hadn't had choir, or were out of town but expressed a desire to come. I appreciate it. So, I've decided to do Marching band. Or not. I'm still not sure. The marching band people make these great, logical arguments when I'm with them, and then the non-marchers make sense when I'm with them. So anyone who cares if I'm in Marching Band or not (Marten, Thomas) send me an e-mail outlining the pros and/or cons. That might help. If I am doing and want to be captian I have to write an essay by the end of the week. I am really not keeping up on these match-ups! But today I'm setting up a big match involving a walrus, a walleye, a wallet, a walnut, a wall, Walt Disney, and Wally from DIlbert. The will battle it out at Wal-Mart. They may only use weapons purchased at Wal-Mart and have ten dollars to spend. I'm giving all inatimate object telekinesis with a three foot range that can't be used on people directly. MArten - most of us respond to stuff in our own posts, rather than sticking things in each other's. In the words of some girl on the interdisc boards, "i feel violated... like raped or something not nice" Here's some context: mrs.harrypotter: I dont believe i need an introduction... im well fairly famous [medit] Actually, this is Kelly Marchant. Just letting you guys know. [/medit] hey now how did you guys do that i feel violated... like raped or something not nice Something to think about. The Betty-one looks drowsy!

 Ha, kinda like the store, only not. Sorry. Umm...so, thanks for the happiness, all. It's appreciated, surely, and...that's about it! Oh! Yeah! MY vote! Daniel Day all the way! MAKE WAY FOR DAY! :D Daniel will kick all of their butts to China-town because he could argue all day about the meaning of life in Greek (or maybe it's Arabic now?), French, and probably his made-up language. He'd confuse Al Sharpton so much he'd end up being condemned to hell, but that's a-okay, because Day does't believe in all that! At least I don't think he does...oh well. He's a nice guy, anyway, and the only one of the four I've ever met. Plus, Kelly's dating him, so that means a lot. :D :D :D The Betty-one looks drowsy!

 I'm happy for both of you. Really. Just try and keep the affectionate name calling and banter down on the blog. And Thomas, I want you to tell me about any PDA's so I can make fun of them. But no detail, please. Also, I have a CD I need a copy made of. I'll get it to you ASAP. The Republican candidate was decided in a game of Soul Caliber because we couldn't find Mortal Combal and it's better anyway. Of course, the Skeleton and Palpatine each tried to mind control each other until they were both trying to let the other one win, making it a competition to see who could lose best, with the loser winning. The Skeleton was losing (winning) when he suddenly said "I sleep now" restoring Palpatine's control of his own mind for long enough to beat the crap out of the skeleton's character. So Palpatine wins. Opposing him for the Democrats will be: The Duck man (from Discworld) Daniel Day (the one who used to go to middle school with most of us, not to be confused with Daniel Day Lewis, the actor) Lawrence Fishburne The Reverand Al Sharpton Make your vote count! The Betty-one looks drowsy!

 I've heard this conversation many, many times, several in a classroom and most of them in front of a teacher. Story Courtesy of Jonah. [Why didn't Jonah post it?-Marten] The Squid3188: I'm going to copy and paste a story I just told Marten cause it's funny The Squid3188: I heard these two black guys talking in the bathroom today The Squid3188: and the first one was taking allergy pills The Squid3188: the second was said"man, whatcha takin' those for?" The Squid3188: and he was like, "Allergies, man" The Squid3188: "Well, what you allergic too?" The Squid3188: "Grass and Weeds" The Squid3188: "Man, how you gonna be allergic to weed?" The Squid3188: "Not marijuana, man. Dandelions and shit" The Squid3188: "Oh. I feel you, man. I feel you" Okay, even though this thought completely warrants a new post, I'm going to splice it in here. I saw something that almost sent me in a seizure right in the middle of the commons. Something so terrifying and evil that I almost screamed when I saw it. Mrs. Howard was at LC. I don't know why. [incoming freshmen-Marten] I don't know how. [she can drive-Marten] All I know is that she was there, and she scared the hell out of me. The Betty-one looks drowsy!

 If you are not already watching Alias and/or 24, you totally need to start. They have both after mediocre seasons, risen up and come back, with great directing (Ken Olin should totally win an Emmy for "Hourglass". Of course, it'll go to Christopher Misiano, but still. He should win it.) to great acting (Victor Garber who has come a long way from Godspell and Ron Rifkin, who may have sown up his own supporting actor in a drama nomination. I know I'm just pimping my shows here, but seriously? They're awesome. Alias: Sundays @ 9 on ABC; 24: Tuesdays @ 9 on FOX. Also, Thomas thinks you should watch Scrubs. In fact you will watch Scrubs! Because who's the boss of you? Thomas is the boss of you. Scrubs is Thursday @ 9:30 on NBC. The Betty-one looks drowsy!

 Okay, if anyone doesn't remember Sophia's first post, It said something along the lines of being my super hot, way-cool friend who just happens to be a girl. Then I complained, and stuff was said about lesbians in Arkansas, but thats not the point. The point is that now she is my super hot way-cool girlfriend, unless the fact that everyone and there mother knows creeps her out so much that she'll not dump me, but viciously throw me down like an annoying chipmunk sitting on her shoulder and biting her ear. I really, really hope she doesn't do that. I may be kinda weird, but after a while it makes perfect sense, to me atleast. I've been dealing with some akwardness too, but you know, you're worth a bit of confusion. The Betty-one looks drowsy!

 Sophia, you do not get the hat of shame. The hat of shame is for people who screw up. Thomas is wearing the Hat of Shame until his grade in math is better. You are sentenced to wear the (brand new!) Hat of Ill-Repute, forever and ever until the end of your days. JournalCon date is (until someone tells me otherwise) May 7th-8th. We're doing Season Two of Sports Night in all it's horrible Dating Plan glory. I'm working on a review of The Pajama Game, It'll be at What Kind of Day Has It Been tomorrow, unless I get lazy and maybe it won't ever get anywhere. All I have to say is, Sophia, you missed a hell of a show. The Betty-one looks drowsy!

 Omg. I thought the Pajama game tonight was at 7 as well...FART KNOCKERS! I am SOOO sorry I missed it!!! Dag gonnit...poop on a stick...GRRRRRRR!!!! I AM SO FRUSTRATED WITH MYSELF RIGHT NOW!!! P.S. Nathan, are you going to the dress rehearsal tomorrow night? If you are, I can pay you back for my ticket...how much was the ticket? The Betty-one looks drowsy!

 This is just a short entry to say that the Pajama Game last night was awesome! Everything we were promised and more. Tiffany Webb is amazing, Jonah made for an excellent disgruntled employee and Nathan an excellent chorus member, and the orchestra too was pretty darn good. So hooray! Everybody get hyped! Michael: Tact 101-- Tact does not mean lying, it means telling the truth gently. And, all jokes about you being dead inside aside, you're going to have to learn to use it because people tend not to like having their feelings hurt, and if you hurt their feelings you will sooner or later find yourself very much without friends. The Betty-one looks drowsy!

 Disclaimer: Erin does not condone any women ever being struck like gongs. Welcome to the blog, Rachel! What I Did On My Field Trip I went to see a play called Private Lives it was funny. It had lots of witty banter that was very well done, it made me laugh. We went to the mall. We ate at the mall I also bought some books. They were The Truth and Night Watch, now there are only five Discworld books I dont own not counting the young adult ones and Last Hero. We got back at 2:30 and sat in the commons until the bell rang. This was a happy day. The End. I am coming to Pajama Game tonight because tomorrow I am booked to go see Ella Enchanted with my aunt and my cousin and Toni. I can buy my own tickets, it's ok. Dr. Disco was... bizarre. [Girl, you stole my adjective! --Michael] Somehow I think we pulled it off, but only just barely. If I ever hear Horrigan say "Oh my gosh" again I'm going to slap her. Amendment to the disclaimer: She is the only woman who should be struck regularly like a gong. [Word. --Michael] Oh! Palpatine! I vote Palpatine! Why? Because Palpy as president will bring corruption back to the Republic! He will put an end to democracy! The Trade Federation will free its influence over the bureaucrats and our people will be lost! He's the Phantom Menace! What could possibly be better than that? As Jonah pointed out, he would eventually just be destroyed by the Rebellion. In the meantime, we can call him "Palpy." Who needs Jedi, anyway? Irrelevent spoiler of the day: Where have all the Jedi gone, long time passing? Where have all the Jedi gone long time ago? Where have all the Jedi gone? Gone to graveyards, every one. When will they ever learn? When will the ever learn? That's right, it's horrible, but in beginning around Episode three there is what we call a "Jedi Purge." Palpatine (he's the Phantom Menace, remember?) decides that he doesn't like the Jedi and hires people to kill them all. I weep. Next time: Do any Jedi survive this "Purge?" Fanfiction Rec of the Week ("You might not care, but I do"): Wizzardly Accusations, a Discworld fic on ff.net in which Rincewind is accused of attempting to murder the Patrician and runs away a lot. He even throws a scent bomb at poor Angua! It's tough to be a werewolf. The Betty-one looks drowsy!

 Rachel's in Iowa. Thomas is at Ben's house. Jonah and Nathan are doing something involving Pajamas. Marten is doing something, but not something that I can put my finger on, or see or smell or touch. Erin's doing that bizarre disco play. I don't know where Sophia is. I'm so very lonely... Jonah: Bring my pants (and all of the change in my pockets) in a big bag to The Pajama Game. Otherwise they'll be lost in Jonah's room, among college brochures and clothes forever. And I liked those pants too! Why shake hands when we can touch...other things? Like Lips...

 one gets my scheme anyway it doesn't really matter. We can buy you the tickets for Sunday on Saturday, but have the money with you and pay us back after the show if at all possible. There is Youth Group, so I guess that's a plan. Marten and Michael, please get your pants out of my house at your earliest convenience. And check out Other SIde of the Corndog even if you just did, because there is a special bonus update. Why shake hands when we can touch...other things? Like Lips...
