 The history of seitans origin and different ways to prepare the seitan. Seitan (say-TAHN) is made from gluten. Gluten is the name of the insoluble protein in wheat, probably most familiar as the stuff that makes bread dough elastic. Known as Seitan in Japan, as kofu in China, and as "wheat meat" and "gluten" here in the U.S., seitan is a low fat, high protein, firm-textured meat substitute. It has been eaten in China, Japan, Korea, Russia and the Middle East for thousands of years. Gluten is often referred to in Chinese restaurants as "Buddha food", because of the claim that it was developed by pacifist, vegetarian Buddhist monks as a meat substitute. It is a food rich in tradition as well as nutrition. As a protein source, seitan contains about 31 grams of protein per 4 ounce serving (which means it has more plant protein per serving than tofu), provides a modest amount of B vitamins and iron and contains no saturated fat or cholesterol. A 3 1/2 ounce (100 gram) serving contains 118 calories, 18% protein and less than 1% unsaturated fat. The same amount of beef has 207 calories and 32.2% protein and is high in saturated fats. As recent studies have shown, our need for protein is much lower than previously believed and any opportunity to remove saturated fats from our diet would be an excellent improvement. Another dietary benefit of seitan is its low sodium content, although cooking often adds considerably to this. Most of the commercially prepared seitan contains a considerable amount of sodium (up to 100 mg. per ounce). If you choose to deep-fry the gluten, the fat content will jump from virtually zero to the number of grams in whatever oil is absorbed (at 4.5 grams per teaspoon). Moreover, like grain foods in general, this protein is incomplete and needs to be complemented with other protein sources such as dairy or legumes. Many vegetarians' first experience with eating gluten is at Chinese or Vietnamese restaurants, where it's called "mock duck", "mock chicken", etc. When it's sold in little tubs at the natural/health food store, it's called Seitan again, probably because marketing studies showed that the word "gluten" lacks consumer appeal. It stands in for meat in many recipes and works so well that some vegetarians prefer to avoid it because the texture is too "meaty." However, for many vegetarians and others who are trying to make the transition to a meatless lifestyle, Wheat Meat" is growing in popularity. Seitan usually starts out as whole grain wheat or high gluten flour mixed with water to obtain a bread dough consistency. The dough is kneaded vigorously for about 10 minutes, and then is left to rest so the gluten can develop. Next, it is rinsed many times under running water, which removes most of the starch and much of the bran. What is left is a firm, stringy mass of high protein gluten that is then cooked in soy sauce and water with other spices added for flavoring, often including the sea vegetable kombu. When raw gluten (wheat dough with the starch washed away) has been cooked in a broth of shoyu, ginger, and kombu, it's called "seitan". It is now ready to be used in casseroles, stir-fry, sandwiches, and enchiladas or just about anywhere that you might previously have used meat. It can be oven-braised, baked, cooked in a pressure cooker, or deep-fried. Each version yields a different texture. Oven braising produces a texture similar to the chewy texture derived from simmering. Baking produces a light texture that works well when grinding or grating seitan. Pressure-cooking will produce a softer texture. Fried gluten turns soft and slippery when cooked with a sauce and absorbs flavor well. - Written by Alyx Sandborg, Copyright 2002 by PageWise, Inc

 Westwood has lost weight by eating high protein meat substitutes and has enjoyed such a lift from his better diet and fitness that he is being sponsored by a well-known meat substitute company ( urlLink Quorn ) for two years. After ending three years in the wilderness since his heady 2000 with two wins last year, Westwood, lying 64th in Europe and with only moderate performances on the U.S. Tour, is aiming to prove he really is back. 'I saw the benefits Darren was getting and I've felt like I needed to do something for a long time,' said Clarke's management stablemate. 'The great thing is, I've lost all this weight and on the (Reuters) statistics I'm (driving) 10-15 yards longer.'

It's been a while since our last get-together. For those who are new, this is a monthly (usually) hour devoted to meat-free cooking, eating and shopping, held on the last Thursday on the month. Since we last discussed, I came across a fun piece on Yahoo! about a new term coined for people who consider themselves part-time vegetarians: "flexatarian." I think that would aptly describe my eating habits. Interesting piece because it brings to light that more and more people are eating less and less meat and choosing diversity among their food sources rather than the same ole same ole. So, tell what's happening in your worlds...by the way, my upcoming video series will feature some veggie items -- will keep you posted. Onward... _______________________ I'm a goin veggie huntin....: Kim!; Two questions: First, are you going to do another farmers market tour anytime soon? Second, what great things should I look for at the farmers market this saturday morning? Kim O'Donnel: The nice people at Arlington Courthouse have been very patient with me as I've not gotten my act together on setting a date. It'll be sometime in May or June, probably June. Funny you ask about what's at market: my bit on WTOP this morning was all about my finds last weekend. Think green, kids. It's all about the greens -- green garlic, garlic chives, cilantro, parsley, chervil, asparagus, lamb's quarters (tastes like spinach, super easy to cook), baby kale, frisee, baby lettuce...such beauty and so tasty! _______________________ Frederick, Md.: I'm a strict vegetarian and have always loved the creative aspects of cooking. However, my diet restrictions have prevented me from pursuing any formal culinary training. Can you recommend any culinary programs that are vegetarian-friendly? (My goal is not necessarily to become a full-time chef, but a vegetarian food writer/cookbook author.) Kim O'Donnel: There is a vegetarian cooking school in New York City that has a good reputation. Name escapes me at the moment; it might be Natural Cookery something something...there are also shorter-term culinary vacations that are veg-friendly. Check out shawguides.com _______________________ St. Paul, Minn.: My two-year-old is allergic to milk but can eat yogurt; he also drinks a little soy milk. I don't think he gets enough calcium. Any suggestions? And can you tell me how to make a smoothie? After I make one, how long can I leave it in the refrigerator? Kim O'Donnel: Lentils are loaded with calcium. Spinach and broccoli also good sources...there's soy yogurt out there...don't know if allergy extends to goat's milk, but lots of new brands offering goat's milk yogurt...smoothies: I prefer with yogurt, and to it, I add 1 banana, plus any other fruits on hand, including a kiwi, a handful of berries, some pineapple, a half mango...blend. I don't add ice or juice because I like mine thicker, but you certainly can adjust to your tastes. Doesn't last long at all in fridge; best to drink within one hour. _______________________ Arlington, Va.: Hi Kim. Just got back from New Orleans and while I made an exception to my vegetarian leanings to try a bite of jambalaya, I'd love to make my own. Any suggestions? I'm thinking smoked tofu, maybe? Kim O'Donnel: I think smoked tofu is an interesting idea, and you've got meatless sausage links as well as the Gimme Lean brand of tube-like sausage that fries up well...hope you're adding okra! _______________________ Prince Frederick, Md.: Can anyone recommend a good vegetarian cookbook that doesn't look like it was put together by a bunch of Sherpas in Tibet. Most of what I've seen were printed on course-textured paper, brown ink, rather depressing to say the least. I want to know which grains and beans and dairy can be combined to make favorful, healthy meals without a lot of fat. I still use dairy and eggs -- you don't need to kill a cow or chicken for those things. I can go for weeks without eating meat; it's not a major portion of my diet. But what really turned me off about meat was reading "Fast Food Nation." It revealed how filthy and dangerous our meat packing plants are, what evils lurk in your meat which can make you very sick, and what underhanded management of the food industry is doing to us. I recommend everyone read it, as well as "The Jungle" by Upton Sinclair. Kim O'Donnel: Prince, Vegetarian cookbooks have come a LONG way from the days of co-ops and communes...There are so many titles out there you may have trouble deciding. Immediately what comes to mind are titles by Deborah Madison, Jeanne Lemlin and then there's Crescent Dragonwagon's "Passionate Vegetarian", loads of titles by Robin Robertson...and all of them are very contemporary. _______________________ Washington, D.C.: Hi Kim, My husband is trying to find out how to make this pasta sauce that is green and creamy, with gorgonzola and walnuts. Any ideas as to what it is? Thanks a bunch! Kim O'Donnel: The green is probably coming from either arugula or spinach. This is a fun one to make, pretty easy, too. You can mix some gorgonzola with a touch of cream, stir over heat, gently tho...you could puree the greens, drain out water, REALLY well...mix in with the cheese, add nuts, chopped, and then mix into your pasta... _______________________ Virginia: Does you have any suggestions for good-quality fake chicken or beef? I am looking for big pieces, not something that is "ground." I have tried a couple of things without much luck. Thanks! Kim O'Donnel: Many looking for similar products like the taste of Quorn, which is made from a mycoprotein (fungus similar to mushrooms)...they've got Quorn roasts, and patties and nuggets and all kinds of things...anyone else with fake meat ideas? _______________________ Anonymous: I have known people who can't drink cow's milk but are just fine with goat milk. They sell it at Whole Foods. Kim O'Donnel: Thanks for chiming in...that's what I was thinking... _______________________ Silver Spring, Md.: For meatless jambalaya, I'd use tempeh, I like it better than tofu in a tomatoey dish. Some seitan might be good for texture also. Kim O'Donnel: Ah, bueno. Thanks, Silver! _______________________ Reston, Va.: I'm sure you have answered this a billion times, but I hope you will humor me anyway... are there any year-round farmer's markets in the area (pref. northern va)? Kim O'Donnel: Yes, yes, yes! Arlington Courthouse, on Saturday mornings. Dupont Circle and Takoma Park, Sunday mornings. _______________________ Veggie burger: I've been trolling through the archives, but can't find it. Can somebody offer up a good home-made veggie burger recipe? Not lentils, please (ewww...) Kim O'Donnel: A few months back, there was a slew of ideas over a two-week period. Since then, I made chickpea patties, tinkered with some recipes and came up with my own variation. I did chickpeas and mashed potatoes, with herbs, garlic, onion...but I gotta get you the details. I don't have them here at my desk, but am happy to provide after I look through my papers at home... _______________________ Arlington, Va.: We like to eat Morning Star Farms "Chik Nuggets" - they also come in patties. My son particularly likes to have this when friends who "hate" veggies are over, 'cause they usually love them and can't believe they ate something NOT chicken. Kim O'Donnel: Thanks for weighing in on this 'meaty' matter, Arlington. _______________________ East Falls Church, Va.: Hi, Kim! You mentioned last chat (Tues) that you mash ginger in morter and pestle. I presume you peel it first, but I, too, hate grating ginger and would like to try this option. (for example, do you have to mash more than needed to get enough?). Thanks! Kim O'Donnel: Hey EFC, Yeah, I cut off what I need, then peel it with a teaspoon, cut into a few smaller pieces and then pound with the m&p. Works really well, and no, you do get what you need. _______________________ Dupont Circle, Washington, D.C.: For your reader who inquired about the vegetarian cooking school . . . yes, it's called the Natural Gourmet Cookery School (www.naturalgourmetschool.com) in New York City. They also do dinners open to the public on most Friday evenings. Sounds like a great opportunity to sample great food from the students. Kim O'Donnel: Hey, thanks for following up! _______________________ New York, N.Y.: Kim, I need fruit help. I feel stuck between seasons--apples and pears on the way out, citrus is blah, but it's too early for summer fruits, right? What should I look for that's going to be tasty, that is, in season or almost in season? I'm 8 months pregnant and trying very hard to be good, when I all really want is to stop at Kripsy Kreme!; Thanks!; Kim O'Donnel: It IS a tough time for fruit. I was just thinking the same thing while in the supermarket this week. Soon come: local strawberries, plus figs. Mangoes are coming in from various parts of the world where they are in season, fyi... _______________________ Re: Low Fat Veggie Cookbook: Moosewood has a low-fat vegetarian cookbook, and it includes MANY more things than what sherpas would eat. It has its fair share of twigs and berries, but also a lot of grains, beans, tofu, pasta, and cheese variations. Kim O'Donnel: Thanks for reminding me...my Moosewood, with the international focus, is very dog-eared from years of use. _______________________ For Reston looking for farmers market in NoVa:: The Falls Church farmers mkt at city hall starts this week, on saturday mornings Kim O'Donnel: Great news, and thanks for helping out a fellow reader. _______________________ Alexandria, Va.: Hi Kim! When you mention farmers' markets, you often neglect to mention the Alexandria Farmers' Market, which goes year-round, and is the oldest in the area. It's open from 5:30am (ugh!)to 10:30am every Saturday. Kim O'Donnel: Very glad that you've reminded me, Alexandria. _______________________ Virginia: I am so excited, I just have to share. For years, I have been trying to make mango lassis like the ones in Indian restaurants, but the ones I made were never as good. I finally found the secret: rosewater. You only need a couple of drops, but it makes all the difference. Also, the frozen mango chunks from Trader Joe's make lassi-making very easy, and I find the quality to be very good. I have been drinking them every day this week! Kim O'Donnel: Funny you mention that - was just talking with the woman who's been consulting me on some Indian recipes for video series, and she was saying that very thing...but if you add too much, your lassi can taste like lipstick...thanks for sharing. _______________________ Silver Spring, Md.: Hi Kim - I have been eating a wonderful whole grain mixture for breakfast - oat groats, millet, brown rice, seeds, etc... I've been mixing with apple and it's very yummy. I'm thinking it would also make a great salad, with jicama, zucchini, red peppers and more but don't know how to dress it. Do you have any ideas? Love your chats - you rock! Kim O'Donnel: Squeeze of lemon or orange or grapefruit and some olive oil, Silver. Some fresh chopped parsley or cilantro, salt, pepper, garlic, scallions. Sounds nice. _______________________ Arlington, Va.: Hi Kim, I want to make a tofu and veggie curry...does tofu go with curry seasonings? Also, i'm not great with really spicy stuff, so can you give me a good mild (yet flavorful!) curry recipe to use with this? Would I cook the tofu at all before adding it in? I'm not sure where to start... Thanks!! Kim O'Donnel: Do you want to do coconut milk curry? Talk to me. _______________________ Arlington, Va.: Hi Kim, White bean bruschetta - I tried to make it last night but forgot the ingredients - & I bought the wrong kind of beans. Here's what I came up with so far - what am I missing (or how can I vary it)? tomatoes, onions, lime juice, fresh basil Kim O'Donnel: The beauty of bruschetta is that you can mess up and no one will ever know...in Italy, bruschetta are among the many "salatini" that are put out on bar counters as snacks,and often they consist of ingredients in the kitchen at that moment. You can vary this any way you want...one fun thing is to toast bread slices and then rub a whole clove of garlic on each slice...don't forget salt. Lemon zest is great. Rosemary is beautiful with white beans...one thing that helps is to keep you mixture fairly dry... _______________________ Fairfax, Va: Kim, My wonderful, beautiful, patient wife is a vegetarian, and I'm a happy meat eater. I'd like to make her a special dinner some night, but I'd like to do it on the grill. What can I cook for her that will be flavorful and unique? (And how do I do it)? Thanks!; Kim O'Donnel: You can make her skewers of pineapple, red onion (or pearl onions), bell peppers and squares of tofu. Brush the whole thing with soy sauce, sesame oil, a little honey and sprinkle some cayenne. Serve over rice. You, sir, can have that, after you grilled for your lovely wife, a steak or some fish kebabs... _______________________ Washington, D.C.: Hi Kim, Speaking of farmer's markets, do you know what is going on with the one that started last year, on Thursdays in Penn Quarter (I think it was on 7th and E maybe?) Is it coming back? Do you know when? It was so nice to be able to do some quick shopping on my way home from the office since the area is bereft of any real supermarkets... Thanks! Kim O'Donnel: Yes, it is. Starting next Thursday, May 6, from 3 to 7. _______________________ Bethesda, Md.: Hello- Do you know where one could go to pick strawberries and the like around here? Preferably in MD. THanks Kim O'Donnel: Weekend section usually does an annual list which I'm betting will come out next month. Anyone with tried and true strawberry picking spots? _______________________ Rockville, Md.: My favorite Italian restaurant serves veggie ravioli with a killer pistachio cream sauce. In making this at home would you recommend the "plain old salted" bagged variety or using plain nuts instead... Kim O'Donnel: Plain, unsalted. You got it... _______________________ Vegetarian Pigs in a Blanket: Does anyone have any ideas for how to make vegetarian pigs in a blanket? I am open to both synthetic meat and more natural options. Thanks!; Kim O'Donnel: I'm throwing this out to you guys for thoughts, etc... _______________________ Washington, D.C.: Hey Kim, A quick question for you- whare are some good (tasty and healthy) snack foods you could reccomend? I'm trying to cut back on sugar, so I'd rather have some sort of veggie and dip as a snack after work instead of a cookie. Thanks Kim O'Donnel: Making your own hummus or white bean spread is very easy, takes about 15 minutes. Can be used for dipping or as a sandwich filler...high protein, no sugar, good fats from olive oil... _______________________ soy bechamel?: Any reason not to use soy milk in a bechamel sauce? There's a recipe for a killer mushroom lasanga made with a bechamel sauce in the March Cooking Light that I'd like to modify. Thanks Kim O'Donnel: Chemical composition of soy milk is different, but doesn't mean it can't work. I don't know for sure. My copy of "Dairy-Free Cooking" offers some "cream sauce" ideas...so why not?? _______________________ Vege in Fairfax, Va.: To the question about Paneer from the What's cooking chat. One can drain it in Cheese cloth and tea sieve to hold the contents in. Keep in a cold place overnite. Remember to close the top of the sieve so that other odors from other products dont mix in. Actually Mango lassi is not very common in India. Lassi is usually salty. I just buy low fat butter milk and make a spice mixture of roasted cumin, curry leaves, rock salt and white pepper(all ground together) and beat the lassi until frothy. Yummy Try cardamon in your Mango lassi for the extra zing! Kim O'Donnel: Thanks, Fairfax...great tidbits...I'm only just learning about buttermilk for lassis... _______________________ St. Louis, Mo.: Another cookbook suggestion: I started out veggie with the "Horn of the Moon" cookbook by Ginny Callan. Many yummy recipes, all vegetarian. A follow-up book, "Beyond the Moon," includes more recipes with an international/fusion twist (Carribean variations, tempeh burritos, etc.) Worth a look. Kim O'Donnel: Not familiar with this one, St. Lou. Thanks for the tidbit... _______________________ Suitland, Md.: Does anyone know of a good Soy Cheese brand? Something that actually tastes like cheese? I am looking for a block that I can grate. Thanks!! Kim O'Donnel: Who knows of soy cheese that can be grated??? _______________________ Washington, D.C.: Hi Kim!; I have some fresh green beans and want to do something spicy with them, but without a trip to the store. I have oil, soy sauce, dried red crushed pepper, and fresh garlic. I was thinking of stirring them up in a pan, but would it be better to blanch them first? Thanks!; Kim O'Donnel: Blanching them does help bring them along, Washington, even if you only do it for a minute or so...not a bad idea.... _______________________ Bethesda, Md.: Hello Kim- I have an eggplant question for you. I generally hate eggplant (hate the texture) but there is one way that I really, really love it. I know it is simple but can't figure it out. I usually have it as antipasto in Italian restaurants or when I was in Italy. It is basically sliced eggplant and balsamic vinigar. I don't know if it is cooked and then cooled to room temp or simply marinated. Can you help me? Thanks Kim O'Donnel: Eggplant is one of those things that needs to be cooked, Bethesda. Was it in cubes, slices, all mushed up? Do tell... _______________________ Boston, Mass.: Hi Kim, What can I do with Broccoli besides steam it? Thanks! Kim O'Donnel: I like roasting it, at 500 degrees. But first, roll florets in a mix of chopped ginger, olvie oil, garlic, paprika, salt, black pepper, stuff like that. It's a great treat! _______________________ Indian Head, Md.: Hi Kim! My new favorite meal: vegetarian tacos made with tempeh and browned onions. I am using a boxed mix, but would like suggestions on making the taco seasoning from scratch. They are delicious with veggie cheese, tomatoes and julienned spinach on top! J Kim O'Donnel: Let's see...I'd do cayenne, black pepper, oregano, cumin, garlic powder, cloves (a dash only!), maybe even some coriander... _______________________ Washington, D.C.: My special someone has a birthday coming up and I wanted to cook something specatular and vegetarian for them. Do you have any cookbooks or sources or recipes in mind that I could try and use? Kim O'Donnel: Spectacular and vegetarian...I'm thinking of a curry. I've got an interesting idea for a Thai-style tofu curry with pineapples and potatoes, but I think cauliflower, green beans would also go beatifully...let me know if this is of interest... _______________________ Oxford, Miss: I'm a vegetarian and one of my favorite meals is rice and beans, but I'm getting bored with my recipe. Do you have any suggestions for how to liven up this old classic? Kim O'Donnel: Do you make a sofrito for your r& b? You know, a mixture of chopped onions, green peppers, garlic and some herbs...like a little thyme or oregano...I'd also add a chopped fresh chile... _______________________ Reston, Va.: Good morning Kim. Still struggling with the white sweet potatos. Any ideas? Thanks! Kim O'Donnel: Not very often that we see white sweet potatoes...I'd roast them, mix with lime, cilantro and sesame oil after cooking...or do some garlic and chiles, plus a little oil...fresh parsley is also nice, a little lemon zest... _______________________ Herndon, Va.: Oh joy - grilling time is upon us... but my marinate recall has lapsed please advise with some great basics for marinating - I'm specifically thinking of the little mushrooms and zucchini I bought yesterday for BBQ skewers, but a good marinate could work on most foods... also, any hints on grilling veg on skewers? thanks in advance Kim O'Donnel: Salt really well. Use a brush. Olive oil, although simple, is a good standby...fresh sprigs of herbs are great too...indirect heat...pieces should all be the same size... _______________________ Reston, VA: Hooray for the mention of the Alexandria farmers' market. My great-grandfather sold there every Saturday morning and my great-aunt and my dad tell fabulous stories about getting up -really- early to go to market. There are also lots of stories about my dad stealing strawberries out of the baskets that were packed on Friday... Kim O'Donnel: Nice story, Reston. Thanks for the memories... _______________________ Re: strawberry picking: Butler's Orchard, in Germantown (MD). You can call their phone line to find out what's available when. Kim O'Donnel: Excellent! _______________________ Laurel, MD: Chiming in: Rice and beans: I've been planning a reverse black beans and white rice using white beans and some of the black rice, seasoned with a South-east Asian theme. Kim O'Donnel: Ooh...I like that... _______________________ Dallas, Texas - Arugala: Hi Kim. Wanted to share a great sauce recipe. I sauteed fresh asparagus spears in some water (could use wine) and lemon juice, with salt and pepper. Then added a can of crushed tomatoes, and a little bit of sugar, garlic, and onions. Let it all cook together till the sauce thickens. I served it with brown rice, but it could be easily served with pasta. At the end, add fresh arugala - it adds incredible zip to the recipe. Very healthy and delicious. And with all the flavors, you won't miss the meat. ~Chef in training Kim O'Donnel: Very nice indeed, Dallas. Keep sending reports of your experiments! _______________________ Washington, DC: This may sound a little strange, but what exactly are white beans? I.E. does the can say "White Beans" are is it like white fish and any number of varities could apply? Thanks for the insight. Kim O'Donnel: White beans actually refer to only a few kinds: cannellini (which are really white kidney beans) and Great Northern beans. They are interchangeable. _______________________ Adams Morgan: How does one make a white bean spread? Kim O'Donnel: A can of drained white beans. Whiz in a food processor. Olive oil, garlic, chopped fresh rosemary, cayenne, salt. Taste. Lemon zest is nice, too. Taste. Add more seasoning if needed. Taste for smoothness, too. You're good to go. _______________________ Arlington, VA: Hi, I hope you can help me. I have a 7 year old who used to eat all kinds of vegitables. Ever since she started school, she stopped eating vegitables. The only vegitable she'll eat are corn on the cob or if I grind up veggies inside dumplings. I tried serving veggies with gravy/salt/cheese and she acts like she's in Fear Factor eating worms. I think it's a texture thing. Do you have any suggestions? Kim O'Donnel: Take her to the farm market this weekend. Introduce her to a farmer. Let her pick out something that the two of you can make together. Obviously she likes veggies if she was eating them before; making the preparation fun could open her eyes. Let me know how it goes... _______________________ Kim O'Donnel: Out of time, folks. Thanks for all the good stuff. Take good care, eat well, and get out there to your neighborhood farm market! The air is now fresh, the new crops are for the taking! Promise to be back for end of May, and in meatime, join me for the regular Tuesday free for all..Best to you. _______________________ © 2004 Washingtonpost.Newsweek Interactive

 By JESSICA RAE PATTON, May 7 2004 I recently spent the weekend in Chicago, the city of encased meat. Just about any poor critter that can be ground and stuffed in a swag of intestine, then boiled or grilled and served in a bun, can be bought for a couple bucks every few blocks at one of the ubiquitous hot dog stands there. At Hot Doug's, for example, aside from the traditional pork and beef wieners there were chicken, pheasant, wild boar and lamb tube steaks. But there were also rumors of a veggie dog, which is how my animal-munching friend Emily lured me to this popular bratwurst bistro. Because the fact is, although I'm a vegan, I'm a fool for fake meat. Or anything, really, that can serve as a vehicle for condiments and be eaten alongside French fries, the more lowbrow the atmosphere the better--diners, burger shacks, carnival snack stands. These food venues usually fall short in the fried-faux-meat category, as you might imagine. But I guess because Chicago's a city teeming with working-class hipsters--two-fisted liberals, as Studs Terkel refers to them--folks whose proletariat taste buds sometimes clash with their compassionate eating ethics, the local sausage slingers make concessions with their concessions. I, for one, thank Doug and his colleagues for this. That was one damn good dog. Char-grilled, with onions, a pickle spear, some neon relish, tomato slices and yellow mustard, all overflowing a squishy roll. I returned home with an unabatable hankering for a faux dog with all the fixings, donned the first shorts of the season and set out with the crazy notion that I might be able to score a veggie dog at one of our local hot dog haunts. I dragged my boyfriend, Art, along to taste-test the real ones. I f you want a guaranteed hostile reaction, head for the greasiest of greasy spoons and suggest they add a veggie dog to the menu. At the original Swanky Frank's, a worn-down wiener shack overlooking a scenic I-95 on-ramp, the owner, Bob, snorted, "That would be sacrilegious." "But I was in Chicago, and--" "This isn't Chicago, is it?" He said and walked away. Was he really pissed off, or just a grouchy guy in general? Maybe I was naïve to the subversive nature of soy protein. And here I just wanted one more place to spend my money on some good, cheap grub. I sat on a rickety stool and ordered French fries and blathered on about writing a food review. The fry cook, who looked like Billy Bob Thornton playing a surly fry cook, shook his head in disgust and muttered something about how you can't write a food review if all you eat is French fries. These guys were in their 30s, early 40s tops, but they had the grumpy old geezer thing down. Their disdain was as thick as the mystery oil they were deep-frying--yup, deep-frying--the dogs in. In all fairness, our server at the swankier of the Swankies, in Westport, was super-friendly. (Let's consider the first location Skanky Frank's, as to not confuse the two.) She smiled and everything. The place also looked like it had been intimate with both a paintbrush and a sponge in recent memory. Art highly approved of the deep-fried technique. "It makes the texture crackly, not snappy." "Snappy?" "Yeah, some hot dogs are snappy. The skin won't give right away when you bite it, then it snaps." He also liked that the raw onions were self-serve. For the sake of quality assurance he ordered the same dog toppings at every stop: bacon, ketchup, onions. "The bacon's under the dog, where it should be," he noted. The French fries were great: thin-cut, some skin left on for that dirty taste, super-crisp but not crisped through. We liked that our order was wrapped up in an old-timey cardboard box. Dog: $2.90, Fries: $2.25 • • • Rawley's Drive-In 1886 Post Rd., Fairfield, 259-9023 Rawleys' décor makes Skanky Frank's look positively posh. The wood paneling interior has decades of initials, names and declarations of love scratched into its surface, like a summer camp cabin. Two high-school-age boys flew around the kitchen putting orders together. "So. Would you ever consider carrying a veggie dog, you think?" "NO WAY!" The one working the grill yelled. "People freak out if we change anything here. We had to repair those walls," he gestured to two white walls behind him, "to meet health codes, and people flipped out. A veggie dog? They'd KILL us!" They got every single thing about our order wrong--handed us someone else's food, gave Art the wrong drink, rang the order up incorrectly, made it "for here" instead of "to go." The more flustered they got, the more they messed up. I didn't mind a bit. It somehow went with the summer camp vibe, and I thought it was probably a fluke. They were extremely apologetic. "It was SO busy a minute ago, we were SLAMMED," the one at the cash register explained. The word "Poop" was engraved in huge letters right below the counter. The cook pulled Art's dog from the fry basket, split it and threw it on the grill. "It's deep-fried and grilled?" I asked, because I couldn't believe it. It was like a heart attack on a bun. After a couple investigative bites, Art reported that he actually preferred Swanky Frank's single dose of grease, though the Rawley's dog also passed the crackly texture test, the bun was fresh and well-toasted and there was a generous amount of bacon draped over the dog. I was still trying to interpret "snappy." "Is it that feeling of breaking the seal with your teeth?" I asked. "Exactly," he said. "I like that," I said. "That's the thing. It's so hard to judge hot dogs, because they're such a historical food in a person's life." He gestured philosophically with his dog. "People are fanatical about these. This is the perfect hot dog if it's what you grew up with." No one could get nostalgic about the fries, however, which were of the frozen, crinkle-cut variety, mealy and barely browned. Dog: $2.40, Fries: $1.90 • • • Super Duper Weenie 306 Black Rock Turnpike,Fairfield, 334-DOGS I admit I was biased in favor of Super Duper Weenie to begin with for its name. And if I had to eat off any of the linoleum-checked floors, this would be the one. By now I was resigned that there were no take-out veggie dogs in my near future... when I spotted its cousin on the menu. "How long have you carried veggie burgers for?" I asked the cashier, who turned out to be one of the owners, Lorin. "Since we opened," he said. "But you don't have a veggie dog?" "Veggie dog? I can't say we've ever considered it." He appeared to actually be contemplating the concept. "Would you consider it?" "I don't think they'd sell." "Do the veggie burgers sell?" "Yeah." "So why wouldn't a veggie dog?" "We're a greasy hot dog place." "You could just try it out." "We have tuna..." "Please?" "I'll think about it. We've honestly never thought of it before." Art surveyed his super duper dog. Plentiful onions, two fat strips of bacon. But I could tell his assessment by the face he made when biting down. Snappy. He liked the flavor of the meat, if not the texture, but Swanky Frank's was his personal overall favorite dog of the day, no question. We agreed the fries were stellar--the best of the bunch by far. Lots of skin, whittled-thin shapes, perfectly crisp with downy insides. Lorin gave the batch a generous shake of pepper as well as salt. Pepper on French fries! Kind of nouveau cuisine for a former hot dog truck, don't you think? I just know an animal-free frank is next... Dog: $2.70 Fries: $2.25 Copyright © 2004, Fairfield County Weekly

 Here is a little introduction to a few of them Soya : Soya is a good source of protein and low fat. Can be used to produce milk, dairy replacements products, as well as to replace the texture and bulk of meat, usually in the form of textured vegetable protein. Is usually the basis for many meat substitutes. Tofu : Manufactured by a process similar to cheese making, but from soya milk. Very good source of protein, calcium and low fat. Able to take on flavours well — great for marinating. Can be used for stir–fries, kebabs, salads and just about anything savoury. Tofu also is available in a silken form which is used for desserts, sauces or flans. Quorn : Not made from soya but is a mycoprotein. Made from the fermentation of a fungus, mixed with egg white. Usually found as chunks, mince, fillets, burgers or sausages.

 Outside North Ridge Hospital, the one that I know all the shortcuts to, I sit waiting for Triple A after hand holding in room 426 this time. My grandmother is in again for rehydration. This time it's been 8 days. Today was by far the hardest. I decided to reach across and hold her hand bruised, swollen, arthritis with gout, not really a hand anymore. Years of sewing trusses, hunched over, and for low pay. I suspect she won't be around much longer. I think she has decided to let go. After all, there is nothing left here for her but more pain and the missing husband of 53 years, now dead 13 months. The past 6 have been reasonable considering her coherence is so limited but today she was there. I saw in her eyes the same Grandmother who played games with me all summer long, put on plays, treated me like sugar on top of strawberries and now, me, child of 30 at her bedside; shriveled old woman the years were not kind to, wanting death knowing too full well now in my reaching out was saying to her from all of us for the first time the last time, you are forgiven.

 Carnival Oh, but to feel this good, this flushed face, your voice, breathe, breathe. I am hyperventalating. I am electrified; blowing up like a balloon and rising to the top of the tent past tight-rope walkers. I rise up and through, The canvas melts away to let me pass, and it's all stars and sliver moon, up, up, up.

 Accidental Rhyme It comes out like this, running water against porcelain, into a glass, or bottle, captured for espresso, mixed into soup, taken with vitamins, or with a $20 placebo when I am lucky. It quenches my thirst or leaves me bloated. When I jump up and down, I can hear it always inside me sloshing around.

 Six Before Breakfast Memories of wanting more and I left you the gift of my sigh to ponder, getting the last word in before my power cut off, denying all but me the right to caffeine. Eight hours later, the work day spent, my smile shows no sign of setting into the horizon. I wonder will I wake to your words in the morning.

 5:30 Wake Up Call The dream ended abruptly, your voice on the line and I couldn't roll over and turn it off, knowing time is too short to make decisions. You tell me what love is; unbroken speech, poetry before sun up and you tell me what love is; again. I listen, but there is more in my silence. I listen, my inner abacus clicking and clacking against and over the crackling static that does not come from a clear connection; and you tell me what I am afraid of; again. I have no time for these parlor games; cheap satoris leaving others open mouthed and astonished, but not me. I dealt those same cards eight and half years ago, my ego fed by those same eyes, that same hunger for confirmation seldom remembered the next day, and so the repetition continues. You tell me what I want because you are afraid to hear the words from my lips and in an instant crack your mirror or reflect something you will not remember tomorrow.

 Kundalini Rizing I am cross legged, spine growing, root to the ground; pushing it all towards the center and breathing deep light from below, from above, meets in the heart chakra up to the blue light shining, lotus flower opening, growing, tickles like static electricity like the salt pepper atomic tv glow, chanelled, funneled up like a tube, suction, highcracking of stretching, straight then swaying here, now.

 Hello Wanting to call you is pushing a hole right through, band-aid ripped from skin leaving a ring around the wound; and the dancing visions, and the considerations, weighing, measuring, and the wondering of how you would answer and would I get to read you this.

 Margaret's Memorial 330 miles for the privilege of holding my Grandmother's hand in the backseat as we drove to the memorial service for her last living friend.

 RE: Alan 2:30 in the morning and my eyes aren't even heavy yet; your voice echoes in this room and from the cell phone; poems read, traded; words swapped, meaning shared; and I could be anyone. Daniel says, "It sounds like you want to run off and join the circus." I say I am already there.

 Stolen Playgrounds Tiger Woods' homeland stretches out across my field of vision. I tell the woman to my right that 33% of all the water in Jacksonville must go to feed these lawns; a number pulled out of my ass, but possibly true. Golfers spot the landscape like cat shit in litter. I am thinking of the house off Stockton where I spent yesterday, crackheads bumming my clove cigarettes. I am thinking of the neighborhood I wasn't supposed to walk in after dark and the kids I never saw playing outside. The wind is blowing and inside the meeting space, people vend their wares to investment bankers and 5th hole wives. I stub out my smoke and steal a pack of matches from the shiny, clean ashtray.

 Out of Town Suit Waiting for the others to join me at the meeting, I look over my shoulder, suspicious as I type poetry, in my corporate suit and coffee at hand. Later, the attendees arrive; two sets of eyes looking for leadership and direction, and all I want to do is get this down on paper, barely able to contain my need to explain. There are handouts and brochures scattered about, and nobody knows what's going on at this account. I am watching them both for inspiration, the way he draws a wobbly arrow in his daytimer, or the laugh-hairflip combo from the woman across my way, beautiful and lost at 23. I am taking control, and setting expectations. I am the senior member at the table with no time for distractions. Moments later, cell phones ring and the meeting is adjourned. I open back up my laptop and type this.

 Reverie I'm not remembering my dreams just yet. images of me at the shore taking off my necklace and holding it in the water The morning wake up call and workout you see, it's all just so hectic. My favorite thought at the beginning, "I'm walking amongst them," turns, and even I sour. Still, I'm not quite dreaming, not even for three sustained days. Sometimes I don't mind the drive.

 Sunday I let Sunday slide down the back of my neck, without, a peep ing Tom at you. I let Sunday scatter me like marbles, fill my glass with ice, and teach me how to edit.

 Today's Content There are enough words in what we(I) didn't say today, to fill up the page and get a car wash for free. I absorbed you like a sponge, a bystander, the auctioneer, going, going... but what could I offer you in return, my body of work a messy string of cables and wires connecting everybody but me; my body of work, a folder of pictures, from when I still dreamed of silver towers, the turbo elevator, and eating at the company cafeteria like it was some kind of privlege. You have to believe in something. I was traded like a basketball star. I was sold to the highest bidder. I was pimped out to hunchbacks lapping the keys and told to repeat myself again and again. I have told nobody the entire story and only you would understand when I say that at least alcohol was more honest.

 Skort When I was younger, it was my "whore heels," as Daniel was fond of saying. Tight and black with thick wooden heels, the shoes and me, were captured on film, only 22 years young. Older now, I rise in my skort, small and beige, $5.00 off the sale rack at Macy's, and I am as strong as I was the lost night in Weston, singing along with the radio on my way to get smokes.

 Sol Named for the sun, his son, with curly blonde smile, brings you another book to read. It may have been past his bedtime but who could put out that light. Your voice changes it's pitch and you begin. I watch you out of the corner of my eye, vaguely listening to the directions away from here.

 Return to Jacksonville One month past and I am back in my room, 30 days different, and even the faces swapped. I am learning my place in this vast ness; one trip at a time, financed by the will to please. If you need specifics, get your own coloring book.

 Driver, Not Passenger Overcome while driving, I call myself to leave a poem on my voice mail. Calling in later to listen and take dictation, I realize I can't hear a damn thing but the open window, now just a memory alongside road side stands, boiled peanuts, and a sign for the state prison, saying to myself for the first time that forever is just a word.

 Aria What could I show you to prove nothing to myself. I don't even have the right to stand and speak. I haven't even earned my discontent. I don't even know my own name. I curl in comfort, held in the crook of an arm, while I throw my words off the balcony; not even catching a glimpse.

 The Romance of Words If only our ownly responsibility was to just be real; cream color petals, pink at the edge; the stars in a ripple of water; grass underfoot, soft, and warm ground underneath; an owl on the telephone pole; the ladies that nod and smile on the morning walk; coffee at ten o'clock pm; and a phone call with an old friend.

 Florida Summer Down Pour Caught out in the rain on our walk to the Banyan tree, we ran back to the house, laughing too hard, to stop.

 Polished Rock Still, the copper reflects serene, and imperturbable. There is a certainty, or hope, some call it faith; dependence.

 Corporate Poet No inc.ling of a chance.

 In Due Time Fantasies of writing again push me to discuss the option. My life coach tells me this is valueless, who benefits from a poet anyway, a few friends and maybe family who reads it and says, "Oh, this is good" or "Interesting, hmm" or maybe says nothing at all. You can't make money he reminds, and so then there is a lot of suffering. his monthly check suffering too And so I ask is a poet that self-indulgent and are they as bad as Matt Groening says in Life in Hell? Almost mime status? Fuck it. I have something to say. I'm not writing for you anyway. It comes because it comes and if I don't let it out, I have no way of remembering who I am; and if I don't let it out, I grow ever inward, silent, shamed. Far better to committ to three pages a day, and learn about myself by reading. In due time, more will come.

 Personal Ad A stab at normalacy, I wandered to the Personals web site for just a look; decided to post. Two days later, tripping on in, came my first response, and I am reminded that I am not alone.

 In Control When I get there, will I have to climb over your expectations to get in? You, always on the look out for true love or the next best thing. Maybe I'm the latter, or ladder, whose rungs you have yet to climb. Maybe I'm the light you left on by mistake. It's enough for me now to be humble. It keeps me in control.

 Nicotine is a Bitch Goddess Half-crazed I plunder my home in search of a lighter; settle on the stove. I am smoking inside again. It's all those damn hotel stays, smoking room, king sized bed, and me alone, wretched, pathetic, covers pulled awry and feet hanging out, thinking about bed fires. Nicotine is a bitch goddess. Ok, so it's true. I did start smoking to look cool; 15 and insecure, knowing I was different; wanting it to show more. I laid down at her alter and bought my first pack of Dorals. 16 years later, I singe eyelashes over Basic menthol lights. What is it about menthols anyway? Nobody ever wants to bum. I would have been cooler getting Marlboro reds and packing them down; tap, tap, tap.

 Half-Assed Artist When I hand over the drawing or poem, it's the same look; betrayal, expectation of genius and I give them only this.

 My Real Job It is frustrating, this waiting, this wondering about what exactly it is that I am supposed to be doing here on this earth, in this house, with this life. Sometimes, I cramp with shoulds; the inside voices, huddled together, scheming over plans written in the past. Sometimes, I burn with maybes; lofty ideas about what a better person I might become. I am seldom content with the moment , unless in silence, in meditation, in contemplation and recognition that it is all I have.

 When the Moment Strikes Suddenly you are lifted from the fog, and all around and inside is now. Almost without warning, the picture sharpens; and even name badges carry hidden meaning. The words that come out are flushed with heart beat; some truth to utter, practicing for the real job that has yet to come; but sits so close now on the edge of the river, dangling its toes in the water.

 Every Poem Has Two Halves Every poem has two halves. The first half is pulled. The second is pushed. It is giving and taking, needing and having. Letters form in head, letters form on page. In the in between, there is typing.

 Powered Off After the meeting we were allowed to return to our cells to prepare for the group dinner. The nylon shackles cut for only an instant, then it's back to the lock up.

 Correcting Each Other On the second call it seemed clear enough, that a presence hung over us; heavy memory and we began to correct each other. You spoke of stacks of poetry, 40,000 pages strong. a nd I know just how strong "Prolific," I said. "Committed," you countered. Understood, my friend. Later on, you were recalling one incident or another. You called me "forgiving." "Accepting, I reminded. Understood again, my friend. It took the charts to bring out the rest.

 Some Goddess You said that, "I inspire you." And I gushed, girly, giggly, as expected by law; a law that states a woman could hope for nothing better but to be muse for some man. Listen, hon. Epiphanies are not for barter. I offer you nothing in trade. You chose your muse long ago (and it comes in a can.) Don't misunderstand me. I judge no one. You chose your muse before I was even born; and perhaps a lesson for me is to get off my ass and choose my own; having learned in the end that love and working for the man ain't gonna cut it. I have nothing to say, pissed again that the last milepost was just another damn cliche.

 Asking For Stories Words pool along the base and cling to the wick for a moment before letting go. I watch them slide. My thoughts are no longer my own. I am reaching for a pen. I am looking for some paper. I am trying to catch the drips that have eluded me for six years; the background conversations, the inner dialogue that kept me company on the turnpike but would not stain the page. I am staring into the flame now, noticing the colors and shadows on the wall, finger families looking up with wide eyes and asking for stories again.

 In the Moments of Rediscovery In the moments of rediscovery, there is a hesitation; sweeter than chocolate; richer, deeper, brown; where possibilities hold themselves in shimmering waves of infinite choice. You tell me, "I inspire you." The seas part.

 Dopey, Sleepy, Bashful, Happy, Sneezy, Grumpy, and Doc Which one of the seven did she miss the most, carry with her to the other side, or leave behind completely. After all, you never hear about what happened after she married the prince; the struggle to produce a male heir; the day when her cheeks became a little less rosy; or when the bluebird finally died. Who would have told her to leave the laying of golden eggs to the goose? roasted and splayed on the table, stuffing dribbling out of body cavities when the eggs stopped coming What magic mirror had the ovaries to tell her that everything she knew was a fairy tale? And that that the rescue part happily ever after was something she could have done herself in the end?

 Survival Instinct Mirrors crack, smashed to pieces, shards falling easily, reflecting a face still used to control, eyes snapping up love like a paper fan. Someone is sad. Someone is unsure. The fit is just not there yet. There are many layers to digest and unfold into words. There are worlds waiting exploration, colors and lights and music, gumball bliss, graffiti sunsets, and the answer we've all been waiting for, waving from the next balcony over.

 Who Art In Heaven Hungry to believe that I was the one that asked the moon for forgiveness, the story is repeated, perhaps for the third time. I can't be sure, could be more. And this I say to tell you a reason for this touch deprived angst. Exuses and reminders, a no win situation or escape. Let the dead bury their dead. Release the burdens of your soul. They do not belong to you. They do not control you Answer it truthfully, here and now. There is no heavenly father and the one that shows up is years too late, having forgotten the purpose of his labors, and no rest on the seventh day.

 Lessons The unknown is never known; just remembered.

 Thunder And so it goes on for those blessed enough with a healthy past no clean break, clean continuation Squeeky morality. Cheeky morality for popes in hats and nuns in wigs, The scent riding in on the air is warm, real, arms so big they could fold up the sun; clouds, even airplanes held for a moment in the seconds passing by too fast on a rainy afternoon surprise.

 Fort Lauderdale Not ready to go back just yet; the stillness, outside cool air; a smoke on the patio; the cats asleep peaceful vibe. Dreaming of my Virgo man, who has not yet shown himself to me. Maybe he is waiting inside a coffeehouse books on table, notepad caputuring the spill; or traveling the world, taking notes. The breeze through the window, South Florida autumn, brings the first clear air of seasons through my screen. Soft cloth to the outside glass, let the sun shine warm this room. Curtains back, parrots in the sky, another cafe con leche, por favor.

 The One That Stayed Soft, her face against my face, cheeks touching, smile, in her sounds, she is stretched, never changed, given without condition, curling her body against my own as we drift to sleep.

 Precipice At the edge on the lion's back, a glass of water shattered against the tile floor, clouds open up, reveal the sun, a paper envelope, greased with tin, the rust stain, hair collecting in the corners, and you are still gone.

 An Amazing Ten Minutes heavy hung every second longer than day wider than sleep waiting unfold inside out caught spun into gold spun into God meaning the cosmos this universe This Week's Homework: "To be without attachment and without avoidance."

 Maestro Stronger, your words as though in a flash; all that you have been, suddenly brilliant, focused, honest, hiding nothing. Each word, heart beating, pulsing at the lines, spilling, eyes closed, tingling inner, breathing slower, harder, with each line stanza grouped together; each more powerful than my last, combining in elements, lining up for the last word; shot into nothingness, never waiting to stop spinning.

 Fortissimo Sleep beckons, but your words read to me, for me, peal like bells in memory and I wonder, prone to the condition, curious, demanding, what will this do to your style; already changed forever like me. I do not think or suppose, I am beyond that now, knowing there is no always but now. Merge and create. The colors begin to blur, oils mixed in thick haste to cover the pale absence with light. Chords are stuck, the first time harmony, not even trying, aspiring, and your opus unfolding as I bloom.

 FLASH OF REASSURANCE In an instant, sparklers, the sizzling popping tips, smoking into the July moon. Fairy tales and unknown possibilities, the penny in the fountain, the divine reaches into nothingness, and a moment's peace.

 DETACHMENT My mother was right. The bone isn't stronger at the place of the break. I remember this as I listen for the sound of your car turning back. I have been listening for for 13 years and you never come. This time is no different. Your goodbye leaves me scattered pieces this heart I mended, I tended so carefully these past four months with papers signed. And tears come like air and sobs are hard like the sprinter's gasp and I find no peace, no deep waters under this shaken surface. So alone, and you refuse my love again and again. I know you don't love me. I felt it for six years, the unsurmountable task of communication. We could find no network that could bring us together, no cables long enough or strong enough to channel the feelings. And again and again I wait to hear what you can not say. Maybe you think in your silence you do not hurt my feelings as much as if I were to hear the truth. Why is it like this between us? You are the only man whose love I have ever wanted to have. Time means nothing if it can still hurt just as much now.

 THE FIRST COME IS FIRST SERVED Why argue when you can persuade, I asked you last night. The word sashayed along my tongue, and I am a snake of influence, slither and glide, convince and encourage. Harmless to most, I carry no poison. I delight in commiseration. My condolences are no sin. Even scandal can light the way at times when dark is bright.

 NO SMOKING SIGNS Five days nicotine free and this hypnosis cure is crueler than patches. The fire still burns in me, endorphins knowing no rush, and every cell and pore rages at Otis Redding, singing loud and expressive into this waning Wednesday's self-induced insomnia. The voice repeats in my head and on the audio tape I listen to at night, "Is it good for me?" "Is it worth the price?" Breathe deep, count down from 11 to 7. "I am relaxed." "I am calm." "I am in control." If I was going to reprogam my mind, for the moment that cravings come, I should have asked for orgasm or side splitting laughter instead. Note to myself: Think bigger next time.

 THE SEEKER She begins from the top of the skyscraper, a pageless freedom knowing only the path down. Delicious, fingers type, controlling the speed of descent, a rapture, while God is sought in guarded temples with the Guru, among bacon eating Buddhists saying Om, with the Universalists teaching of prey and predator, and Christians lighting candles to remember. She is still searching; books at her side are titled "Awareness" or "Transformation" and she scolds herself for not remembering her breath. She has centered herself between the extremes for now and January is cold. A waning gibbous moon streaks the green outside like frost and meditation is found in the details.

 THE LAST WORD Even as I reach my door, the drama of you continues; train whistle blow outside my window; and I cried out as we raced to catch the 5:40. "Why does this have to be so dramatic?" and he said, "Heather, you wouldn't have it any other way." Train whistle blows a last time, your meaning as you said goodbye, and I choosing myself at last over you. What healing forms to take the place? What warm bath of peace, a little gentle place to put the grief. Back in my box, the hum of the computer, planes overhead dancing, low light, flannel against skin, breathing again. I will not be latched in any man's cage. There is no combination to my love or lock to cut off. I guard and protect my palace with curiosity, having learned the art of questioning the witness, vicarious observation, eating the emotions, dipping my bread and licking my fingers clean. There is such a thing as too close and easy to spot amindst the blackness of eyelid curtains drawn. Ignite into flame, sparks of wheels braking and every inside awakening. This is the one I write for you inside my shallow cave of doubt and webs extending time across my space and death at every doorframe. Damn you, the water that drowns itself, the air that suffocates, the fire leaving ash. This earth can not bear these burdens nor count the weight of boxes shackled to ankles because you were afraid. Step up and demand your rightful place. Empty the barrels of regret and shame. Throw the has been into the wind. You have never been who you are right now. And if I stamp my feet, and if I scream, then maybe you will leave me alone, where I want to be, stepping aside. And you will leave me Sorry China and all your prophesies fulfilled at last. And I will tell my story into nothingness and remember nothing. I will gesso over the canvas, press the delete button, and move on, because that is what I do well. And if I think it hurts for just a moment, I will blame the moon. And if you think truth is known when it is named, you are missing the picture. There is no truth, just images from electrons that flash and burn oblivion soup.

 THE REVIEW(S) IS/ARE IN The words are out in print for comment or not, and the judgement is not guilty for now. Decision hangs steady for three days running with little deviation in the story line. Simple fool to be nothing better than or just something overlooked again. The wonder of it all and the knowing is like a path. I stopped on the walk, dropped to my knees and counted, curled like a fist, waiting for the moment past passed.

 DISILLUSION MEANT The moon plays tricks on my peace of mind and I am happily surprised by Pisces Balsamic curl of light. Surprise is always happy. Intentional change may present a few road blocks. Tested and teased, I left my worries on the Bahamas breeze, the sidewalk balcony outside my room with the mini golf view, and the buffet extravaganza. The time to leave signals, a flash of lightening and the thunder is a smile. Nine years passed without the pantyhose battle once brought into the open. I wore flats and rose colored glasses in defiance of no one but myself in the end. My reasons have changed but my soul has remained strong. I have finally found the path I have been walking on all along.

 WHEN YOU LEARNED OF MY NAME 10 years ago was me to this place and nothing mattered much but that I could drink and the liquor store so close to my house and Food Lion for beer. Still I wrote with feriocious intensity; love lost and forlorn of fantasies never formed. And memories too; the drunken pounding of fingers to the keyboard on my new color screen computer. I can remember sending you the poems though I can't remember which ones they were or what you might have known when you learned of my name. I was anybody else at the time and you didn't know about all of the wine or how I came to men or who was why I am. And I didn't know you were someone real housed in a castle of empties casting your net onto the page from the Dead Man's chair. Conversations ensued we can not even remember, memory not being too important as the holy now and even now that is so. There is no time and yet enough time, all of the world's time and no roles or expectations to grow one's hair long or shave off a beard. Who we are now and what has been heard when nothing was said, but still I wonder does he know and I hear him in my mind saying yes a thousand times I am saying nothing so loud, and even covering my smile poker faced as the dream is coming forward and the painting of the moon is mine and that school and that park and that is exactly yes and all the ashes in my car or the bowl of vomit left two days now at the foot of the table is nothing compared to nothing compared to nothing compared to.

 CONFIDENCE I am water. I am earth. My parents were fire and air. I was pulled from the womb unwilling to face the birth canal when another option was possible. It is always possible. I come to you now on the verge of discovery. My sails are flowing and I am confident of this wind and this salt air, the canvas blowing filling with colors. This confidence is like a gift and I appreciate and I endure; weaving the strands into patterns into make believe and real and something warm to wear. Life came to me in summer and footy pajamas. The fourth generation, baby Polish princess at the top of the aluminum siding castle. There was a picnic table in the back yard. And my mother was air could she make them like her more by liking me enough. And my father was fire over books and bad kitchen lighting to hook a career out of this place where he too was born. We fled to the desert when I was three leaving snows behind and the oven my grandmother used to burn her children's hands with when they were bad. A new set of grandparents welcomed me like a second birth and there was a kitten for a friend, soon a pool, and a million books of witches and goblins and girls who knew magic. My mother stayed inside with romance novels and melon ballers and sometimes gin and vermouth but always perfect; coming outside with cut up vegetables and hours working to please the palette of my Dad. She knew her role. She was air. She passed through. And when I was good I was very very good and when I was bad I was horid. Sweat pulled off in the dry heat like mirage as I waited for my father to get home to punish me for something done again to my mother. He was fire. She was air and I was earth and water. The tension and terror of the beating and having to do whatever she said or else. This much I remember and nothing more will come to this page today. I am lifted from the story in a giant helium balloon and carried up up up to the stars and evening night as the sunset hits camelback mountain and saguaros turn purple with goodnight.

 GLASS Light filtered through stained glass cave dwellings, cool earth floor, among the red rocks and chips of light break through like points on a map when everything is warm and kind. The rock is smooth in my hand, now edges jagged are merged with palm, tendered with lotion and love from all around, and above, beyond, below, beneath, besides, concerning, down, during, except, for, from. The prepostion parade with clown horns and Shriners whizzing down the streets and squares of Savannah during the St. Patrick's Parade; and your apartment window two floors above the porta potty while people pissed green; your stryrofoam head doll painted magical Mona and no idea of direction. There was only the wind and the dandylions catching, scattering, dispersing, dancing. Did we dance last night outside Nicotine, didgeridoo pulsing notes and I interrupted you to trace the painted footsteps, fucked up the numbers and turned towards you watching me learning. But the clouds pass casting shadows layered like stacks of napkins spread in a fan at the bar; swizzle sticks, a rotating fan. The film is rolling and nothing but everything I ever wanted stands in the way of here and now. Already the vine is curling tender shoots reaching up like pipe cleaners to twist and play with suck on like ponytail braids and twirl around in the dress like every damsel in distress. Good god. May there be light, may there be inner peace and spritual growth for every one of these fuckers like me and you and everybody playing it cool or emptying giblets from paper packages to put in soup to flavor the broth. I am down with mines and shoulds and sighs. I have enough belief in myself to let it ride 'cause if the worst is down, that is what I am good at. Spring is here. Step outside.

 DISJOINTED Who am I to tell you to stay and master the infinite complexities of unknown now when power struggles weigh heavy on the scales shucked off with a borrowed knife and shining in the early light like rainbow fingernails the missing piece is always missing or it would not be a piece there are no stand alones or one offs or this or that creation to believe in something better different new dreams are analyzed and shown on television for the masses wanting reality when truth does not connect them soft edges the day at home incapable of being the listener to act alone what purpose vision or adjustment or rain from these clouds heavy and boxes stacked like waiting for something grander or a kick in the ass never coming from one's own foot

 DAYLIGHT SAVINGS Fire does not sit well with me alone in this room still and sweat is hanging like a heavy too big to hold child in this room humid airless and I could go open the windows and I could turn on the air but no and not and suffer this martyr I am not satisfied with all of my choice with all of my everything told I can do whatever I want as wanting makes as desire fufills as comfort shields my eyes I see nothing but blind as routine paves my sidewalk I feel nothing under foot as more advice to stay to not risk to not dare or dream or trust or live all of the voices stop I have heard all the words from inside before and this is just another hole and it's for me to decide something new and not worry about right

 404 In an instant this one was gone in a blank nothing of return key silence having filled the virtual page with words so cleansing and even on this one the ending was fabulous but something happened page cannot be displayed this blog sever down despair my words were not retained

 EXPLAINING THE SILENCE Three months passed with nothing much to say being on a power high and all or at least thinking I was but the pixie dust washed off in the turpentine bath and all that was left was dirty feet The answer was not found in that question. I must have been asking the wrong but how could I know and what made me think and maybe if and what about that and should I shouldn't I would I could I trust myself to even trust the universe as though stars represent some kind of why enough to make us feel small and I say no again not this time running jump and slide your whole life is this dive down down deep

 APPEARANCE PMS makes more sense than another 10 years of this goddamn job everyone says is so great because it pays the bills so it goes as he'd say as for me I have had enough as for me my last never is worked I'd have to be out of my mind to stay another minute I'd have to be drugged and sacked in burlap Even that sounds like more fun than another drive on the turnpike back and forth endlessly making someone look good

 IT ALWAYS COMES TO THIS the moment of flight people parachutes a lead weight a helium balloon whispers from an alley a stern glance of disapproval acceptance the unknown trust shame the ego's despair clutching grappling and dusting off the cape

 I CRADLE IF I cradle If and dress her up like dolls for girls to play with I hold her hand at the end of the street and look both ways before crossing Late at night I tuck her in with When and How beside her If I were If I'd never know fuck is this cadence or what is this shit that's happening

 CROSSROADS Pounding breath is shallow body thick and hard with tense hammering desire to quit to flee to love to be to stop copying and start creating to move on and find the path is still there winding to another crossroads somewhere further on

 RSVP Busting out a tickle pins and needles inside below the rib cage the urge is so strong to live to create to be become feel free liberated at last something unknown magnetic tractor beam pulling me towards the next step life mapped out and the bread crumbs eaten by forest animals body draped on the massage table while my neck is pulled and pushed left center right scolded for wearing my shoulders around my neck and the woman's pecs forgotten hunching over from too much keyboard caressing my fingers begin to curl until at last reminded death does not have to come by invitation

 DIALOGUE WITH YOURSELF Did you expect to find me here in this location starting out at you and we I mean you and I being you you feel who you are talking to who is talking to you from behind these fingertips ever pressing and there is nothing but the abyss of bytes spewing data like stars the universe expanding exploding consciousness in batches recorded here for all to see like blindness like turning away and what is visual is what is coming to screen and I am alive here and with you as much as you will let me be there is brightness illumination signalling and like a race to the finish you are with me now and who am I but you

 ALCOHOLIC Weak, you drink your strength and become fermented and sour like substance, forever kicking yourself and those you love sober when you are a gentle man; hard to remember when words are thick as phlegm, subtle as lead pipes against the head; dissapointing like a lesson unasked for, unlearned, and all that you were slips through fingers like the water from a poem somebody else wrote who thought he was you.

 BETRAYED 2:19 am birthed the Aries moon while sleeping in my bed. The morning broke through and I wake to moving sidewalks, the others passing by and standing, and staring, until workday is done. I leave the crowd behind to shuffle off this day's remorse, unmet, unmatched. Daylight is sucked in by the mouth of night, inhaled, one gulp, embers, coals; and it begins, the nightly ritual, a different sidewalk. In the moment, you are all light and anything can happen; does. You break the spell. You cast a shadow. You are bitter and darker, fire and ice side by side; driving me to write. You are a comfort to none but the man at the gas station who sold you the cans and I am the fool again, manipulated, talked about, lied about, tossed around like worth as you piss all over your fan club.

 FINISHED That's it. I have had enough of trying to relate, to change the world, to change myself, to make a difference, to make a dent. BOOM Let hope explode. BOOM Fireworks of faith. BOOM There's nothing left. I have wasted my life living someone else's dream, someone else's expectations. BOOM I should be burned at the stake for treason. BOOM I should be nailed to the cross for my thoughts, kept inside again, repressed inside again, silent, useless, lonely, ugly, nothing golden bright to offer the universe. BOOM Time is running through my fingers and I don't have the answers, these dubloons are melted chocolate stale Easter leftovers, and I am going to hell anyway for tempting married men when I had none of my own, for speaking out too seldom, for dragging my kindness through the coals like it's nothing, like I am nothing to offer but down while the wheels spin and the roar of the plane, and the polite way the passengers ignore eachother even when someone is screaming. (written 4/27)

 STAND BY Disillusioned I soar, a bird who has clipped her own wings, finding at last that I have no fire to offer the universe; it was yours all along. Alone now I hide, with my gifts unwrapped, bowless, as if the universe cared for another utopian dream, a direction of love pointed to with an open heart by a mute. And if my tears could turn this dry earth to mud, and if my soil could change the world, then throw me to the flame and let my ashes proof the clay between your hands. I am nothing. I am no one, at last the liquid poured into sieve of self and gone. What good is the desire to serve when desire only cuts and divides both halves. There are pieces of me I will leave behind here, leaving my dreams unfulfilled, my faith in myself crushed by a fist, rumpled into a ball and tossed with so much other rubbish. So this I will tell you when your voice is back, that I have failed, that I have faltered, that I have gazed into the mirror and reflected none of what you have seen, vision pissed into balloons and cast into the sea. I am a whimper. I am a moth not a dragon, weak, withdrawn, to retreat to the cage of my fingers, to lock the door without a key. And in the end, if one will come, I will remember nights without sleep, the weight of my passion, the pounding belief at my door that knocked and knocked and knew no peace. My back was strong and inside much light, but thought orbits like stars, like earth around sun, the moon which never came, and no certainty as I watched my picture fade. I knew at any time even now, I could stand, make a decision, and be strong again, bone and blood, but feelings like magnets hold me to this chair, and it is more true not to move now. Like faucets, like data through cables and I divert my eyes from danger like God's house or salvation, rather inside believing failure when uncertain success may come. I resign my position of mood director. I relinquish my smile at strangers, my mind the master, brandishing the whip at every indescretion or indecisive move. It hangs in my solar plexus like indigestion. I have squandered my power. I have trusted that I could be you and made promises I can not keep. I have buried myself with a toy shovel and lost my place and lost my way. I spin and spin to gather speed, bursts of dull light, explosions of average, my ego kicks and screams echoing down the well. I will forgive no one, not myself, nor you, nor all of those gardners planting hope and despair. Not even weeds could sprout through baked desert cracks in my soul. Even the cactus gave up on rain and shriveled to a stick, thorns still sharp. Nothing to guess at now, reality unveiled, my pathetic escape plans scrawled over This is my weakness. Look at the man behind the curtain now, gaze upon her face. I will ask none of you for help or hinderance, you have suckled me on lies foolish needy trusing lips to nipple, and the dead weight of my aspirations, and the bullshit faith in my abilities, and the tears that well up now, unable to keep it together even for the hour and a half plane ride home. (written 4/27)

 OFF THE HOOK It's not even nine when there is an attempt to cop-opt my crisis; my story at last told, and everything hangs in air like dreams are not even possible. The day passes in sleep and the strain of listening to numbers talk, screaming down columns in an Excel spreadsheet 5 cups of coffee can not even animate. Freedom charges another debit against my account and the messenger hits the floor before the bullets fly. (written 5/21)

 BEFORE AND AFTER The rain taps its fingers on the tin roof above my patio, keeping me from a drive North to Melbourne to check in, luggage in hand, another night out before a morning meeting, and a few words, and a few notes, and a drive West to Tampa to check in, luggage in hand, and another night out.

 FOR PHIL You took a photo of me in stars, black back, and rain dripping down the screened porch. You gave me comfort but I could not receive. There were too many thoughts of goodbyes from others ringing in my ears for me to hear what you were saying. I am surrounded by the aged and forget my youth from time to time.

 IN VAIN There is nothing I have to say that hasn't been felt by someone else and this is my good fortune. All of the angst and doubt and questions are not in vain if written down and someone should pick up the pieces to rest her head a while. Some nights it is not so easy to sleep without a pillow.

 WILLING And out of nowhere and everywhere, all is right with the universe and you are back. I am green haired, laughing, young, hanging on the swimming pool ladder, catching my breath as yours whispers through the line. Every moment, back and new in the complexity of an almost no. I understand without. You remind me so much with every word how yes there is a now, there is a connection we all experience down, and because such love is required, such tenderness that I know from you for everyone in your gentle stories. The magic you convey is possible in the moment, every moment. I am singing in these words. I am dancing the steps painted on the sidewalk. Take my arm in yours. I am willing.

 CLOSE CORRESPONDENCE Silence starting and already I imagine trips to the mailbox, but what the fuck, and why am I missing something here that has kept my mouth shut tight like duct tape over lips against a terrorist threat. Light another. Smoke another. Get this out of my head and down where I can understand nothing better than big talk from someone else, while I sit and observe, while I sit and perceive. I am whipped into submission by my reflection. My tawdry alter ego, the no show, readied for my finale as a failure and no head for numbers, so what will become of me... I have three days left before I can be myself again and nobody will be there on the other side to hear it. What have I done and why should I care if I don't don't care when I'm my own nurse writing prescriptions, before the Third Bardo. For all the promises made to send to me, now will the letters come? What do you care and why should you care when I am just another stranger or reminder that you have heard everything before and probably said much better. Is that jealousy? I have nothing to offer but breath and that which comes natural to dissipate every energy landing here. Doubt, fear, shame. This is nothing to contribute and I can't get by on my tits, my looks faded at 5 years old and I'm lucky to hear cute anymore. Responsible, dependable me. Why can't I just be alone where no shadows play across the walls I don't cast myself. Why can't I just be alone and not hear your voice or wonder and wait by the mailbox for something not coming out here now to tell me the truth. 4:05 AM Friday, June 27, 2003

 HOW DARK This dramatic ending was courtesy of T-Mobile. Sixty seconds on Bradley's phone explained nothing. I am a greyhound let loose after the rabbit, carting your newest disciple behind me. Thoughts of this and who I am spark, and you don't know how dark my cloud is. Back at home, wondering who this father he thinks you are is, and you don't know how dark my cloud is. Pieces fly and the jig saw changes the shape on the way down. I am powerless watching this story play out in not the way I feel. And I question every question I questioned and the answers that sound different the second time rewound, and you don't know how dark my cloud is. The line to you is cut and words can only get me into trouble later or sooner if I send them. This is not my half. This is not my whole. This is not my job, my problem, my passion, my possession. I am lightning. Look at the path. I am the moon reflected in a pail. Look up. All my words and all my sorrows have already been taken, and you don't know how dark my cloud is. Go ahead and choose another title for this meaning less. It will take longer to explain the sound of my own voice this time. 2:55 AM Friday, June 27, 2003

 HEATHEN These are not the keys I wanted to press 65 days in. This is not the Sunday afterwards I wanted to spend with you. I am a balloon that's been deflating for years. Nobody said anything. Isn't now too late to raise my hand for air? This is not the song I expected to be playing for you this month. This is not the book I wanted to read when I finally let go. What makes you think you are so special? What gives you the right to judge and complain? I am a television series all to myself. I want to tell my friends to stop right where they are and let me get this down on paper or where is that camera, tape recorder, something. This is what I am supposed to remember. Interesting is even better than saved.

 BETWEEN THE NOTES I remember talking with you at the table, you in your assigned place, and me in mine, even though the parents were gone. You told me I was too young to think about things like the meaning of life, or what my purpose here would be. You are supposed to be out having fun, you told me, and I would ask you what if thinking about these things was my idea of fun. I could barely convince myself and you never hid your pity for my petty struggle to find and an answer. between the notes in our conversation.

 EQUINOX Tommorrow is off, put on hold; faith, hope, and love are shelved cans of film, and the jar of ideas is filled with brine awaiting a different freedom. This summer equinox knocks to find me barely awake at its passing and cursing the light that won't heal another's suffering. It has rained all day and you tell me 600 persons were evacuated in the flooding when we talk. There are no fire flies this far into the city anyway and even if the grasses were dry the crickets would not grind any softer. I have been promised that the meaning of life is time by an uncle I got drunk a dozen Christmasses ago. I immerse myself in it like a bath of gravy and barely float. I shovel the walk of it every morning when I wake and notice its passing when the last quarter moon rises behind the clouds. Decades too young to retire from life, I give up anyway. I stand accused of dreaming of a world too good to be real. Evidence is presented without a spell check in great abundance for the good of the masses. They tell me their fears and wish me well enough alone, trapped in prisons of their own regret. I stand inside my cell tonight because I know my way around here even in the dark.

 WRITING Always arriving like an itch nothing can scratch; not mind, nor hopes, nor mindless cleaning, straightening for the the creation that comes from fingertips, The night is longer still ahead of me, like wine, like water from glasses played for an audience; different levels of liquid to appoximate the voice or a guitar left playing by itself, fingers strumming with nobody to hold the instrument.

 VIGIL There are moments when joy doesn't come and all of the talk of God and peace does not fit the hole. Even faith in the internet shatters under search terms not found. The emptiness is vast without content. The void is highlighted in gold and over and over again outside it sounds like thunder or the sound of trash cans rolled out for the night, planning for the morning when time stands on end, static electricity in hair, the gong sounds. Time's up.

 PRINCESS Sometimes she can sweep the pages into nothingness; into an eight ball corner pocket, stuffed with her short attention span for present details. The past ruffles its feathers against the girl with a lifetime (still short) of boxes filled with collections of what can not be bought. Dreams may come, and she may call names out into the darkness like memory cares enough to answer her at all. She asks if true love is as real as stars or bright planetary nebulae, a fuel that burns to tell us something about our own origins. All remembered at once, it is sudden as dissapoint ment and the gravity of a single misplaced thought, found still searching for the pea under her matress.

 WORKAHOLIC Another sun sets as you stab at your keyboard, fingers drumming replies to the boomerang burst of emails you must answer. In only a few moments, the time for dinner will have passed, all movies will have already begun, and all of your friends will be in the thick of their plans for the night. You may believe in the urgency of the greater cause the company has instilled in you, and the idea of your place in this world from which there is no clocking out. So wake at dawn to work but know in the end it is nothing. The time will come where death will rock your boat, the loss of a loved one leaving an anchor deep under your waves, and you will wonder where all those sunsets went and why you were not there to hold her hand at starlight. You will find that all those trips for work meant nothing, are not even remembered, and even the money left behind is too weak to keep you floating. Begin to tread now, and gather your strength. Pick up your sail and work with the wind this time, for love is more than greed will ever buy. You will never be important enough or have enough proof of your worth through any job or any title. It is quicksand to your self and no matter how much it eats of your soul it will never be full. Forgive yourself the times you made others do your work so you could ride the corporate coaster. Forgive yourself the times you couldn't be there because you thought you were too important. Forgive yourself now for truth does not come easy and without a lesson. There are many oceans ahead of you to call your home now that you know.

 AFTER A DAY AT HOSPICE How slowly these stages pass, how gradual a slope, and we too are learning while the summer passes by without our concern. The days lengthen and stretch beyond us while we too are blanketed by the nurses in kindness and patience. With Grandma there are moments where she lets me know with the grip of her hand, she is still here. Sometimes there is a smile, beautiful beyond skies. There have been days too where she has comforted me when weak, my tears falling unashamed by my love for this woman who has given me so much acceptance and concern, a gentle respect for simple truths. I remember weeks ago, hot from the walk to the Hospice house, I came to her and took her hands in mine. With silence she drew them to her lips to blow them cool. This is love. It is here I have learned tenderness. It is here I have learned care. These are my thoughts riding my bike home, thanking my legs, my heart, my health. Home, I hesitate doing what would make me feel good because even the tension in my shoulders, neck, face, reminds me that you are still here. There is so little time now for other souvenirs; memories made, forgiveness granted, and night passes on to another day of lessons and farewells.

 ONLY IN DREAMS Why must love be for another when it can not be against? Last week I was your lover, wife, favorite friend, and child's mother. You came to my door with words I long to hear, having scripted them so meticulously, missing nothing. We spoke from the heart and dreamed in color, filling the skies, traveling through deserts and on high mountain roads. I gave you the resume of my heart, objective clear, and you responded in delight. Pity you were not there to experience any of it. Why must love be for another when it can not be against?

 BEFORE THE CREDITS Maybe the answer is to belong nowhere; let time ride over your back like rain falling through a patch of sun, sing your song into the night to harmonize with locusts, breathe, embrace moments even spent in woods, and if a tree falls then who cares. There have been crueler summers, the time to let my heart out to play, learning there is beauty too in suffering. I am more than less I was as dogs bark and the room is still save the ceiling fan having it's own gentle caress on my shoulders. I bleed willingly, joyfully, believing in magic over cold logic and thoughts dancing, meaning nothing. Real is as real does. The movie playing in my mind is a double feature. I order vegetable foo young and select this seat.

 THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE For seven years I have lived next door to a mermaid. At night, she hangs her tails from the line stretched across her car port. I know her name and she knows mine. The rest of my neighbors are strangers, stranger still these days filling spaces with SUVs and children taken in hand. I have outgrown this home and am outclassed, and am outmortgaged, and am outside taking the recycling out for Friday wondering how it all got so different from me.

 CUT THE STRING I imagine I will always have this feeling of vague dissastisfaction. One minute there is endless opportunity, the goal is in sight, then the finish line, then nothing left to cross. I remind myself. Another ending is near, and in the end it doesn't ever matter how good it all sounded then. I have people to face and balls of yarn to unravel, trim, and snip off. Perfection isn't possible and what are dreams for if not to wake from. I seek a new path to absorb myself into. I will avoid those who suffer from self-importance this time. I have paid for my admittance to this show in more ways than one. July is change and letting go and the universe seems a lot more trustworthy to me than people if I am any example. The balloon rises into the sky and is caught by the wind up, up, up.

 CLOSER Holding in feelings, drawn and quartered by possible fantasies and improbable futures, I am in wonder and awe. She gave me a sample bottle of perfume called Miracle to use for such adventures but so far no water has turned to wine. I am beside myself, inside myself, rehearsing and rehashing, afraid to pick up the phone to call you in the event it may ring. You are living in a different time I know too well to pretend now my minutes pass the same as yours, measured for mixing in metric increments. The window of opportunity this time is known and days pass towards your arrival as though leaning forward. I am unsure about all but my feelings and what I am willing to sacrifice in their name. Such statements come easy but I am all about the imagined. It is what I know, eyes full of stars, and an inner knowing of just how the moon will look tonight rising above water.

 GO ON For five days, I have been without my mirror. I guess if this shirt looks right with this skirt with this look, sideways glancing, is this really me? It is spring at the piata party. My amnesia has lifted from the time I was hit by the bat. I am looking around at all the kids. Tonight even the poet asks where the moon is and in Gemini, even I look rational. Thoughts stretch out in the sun and flip. Everyone else has found the answers but me. I have spent my life interviewing the wrong person.

 STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS If I could quiet my thoughts, wrap the bundle in soft and warm, to crib for naps or watching stars, would the unknown make itself a little less obvious? All day I have been beyond behind wonder and not knowing, pretending bliss, the gift of lack of commitment. I am too far removed and too soon confused. I am missing out on missing out. Could there be a balance in geography, a new spot to look on the map, easier on the neck? Snap around and fall in line? I am breaking the rules still but still not enough. And in a round, my generation sings. We apologize to all of those who have sacrificed their lives in the hope we would be more than what we have become. You should have asked us first what we were capable of.

 GROWING WINGS Like an outpouring from the void, not even knowing what will be said next, it all comes together in a chorus of what to dos. The eternal question of being strong enough for someone else too, you ask without a question mark. There is always fear of never being enough for these mistakes offered up like proof. I have not turned the air conditioner on since I have been home, a someplace I have been before, which surrounds me like a fog that does not come up through the trees at seven o'clock in the morning.

 CLUES AND ILLUSIONS At this point it doesn't really matter what I say to sound coming off like a nothing, something, maybe more or less, not. These images flash, and I am unsure again of who I was when I was what I was, to be found this close to home without a conscience carved in honest mistakes. Best wait for something resembling silence to take the place of feeling out of place, pointed at. No competition is worth having. We were meaning something even I can't understand; like a song going through your head that won't quit and singing it to someone else only makes it worse. A spotlight on the stage or behind walls is more or less the same. Burn out the light by leaving it on too long or shadow this crevasse into camouflage. It makes no difference. Words must come out somewhere after all and targets are slow to come by. To know oneself as a monster and angel containing equal parts is a poorly bargained balance. Deny nothing. Keep to yourself. Keep your hands in the car at all times. Rhetoric and righteousness from too shaky a foundation, is roughness and sand castles. What could you have been if you had just been you, if you'd only known that then? Who else do you expect to forgive and forget the truth of too much from too much? It all comes out in the wash said someone helping even now, in ways I can not see, in ways I can not see.

 ONLY STARTS In the in between, between fear and flight, choices breeze through chance, opportunities tease, and voices never echo the same through the open door, closed by passers by. Single light switch, socket, the pulsating electric puzzle, writhing like tommorow; procrastination finely tuned for the recital; Mars coming closer to earth than what could mean something wrong. The planets rarely align for despair or disasters yet to come. More is wished into the energy vacuum than all the worlds pennies buying nothing these days. Paint over the mess you thought you made with your life. Pull off that protective vinyl cover. The suits were made for flight and in the end, it's only starts.

 STILL NOT COMING BACK I could probably stay awake for the rest of my life in frenzied marathon poetry writing. It started as a tickle, or a gash, I felt after purging my home of your wood. Big trash day is coming to take away the rest of you and I returned all of your memories before asking you to please go; you will never do, you will never do. And as I boast of my pain, I can only imagine what fears take hold of you as you drive away again always never turning back to take me into you arms. You apologized to me when we parted from our embrace this afternoon. "I am sorry I am not what you need," you assured me as you let me go. You never knew that all I asked of you was to keep holding me just a little longer, but knowing that was not worth the asking. written 8/4/03 4:25am

 AND THEY ARE OFF I write without stopping like someone has shot a gun and the race is on. To be fair, I allow for breaks this time. To be proper, I forgive those critics whose jobs were to set me straight on a number of important details such as; creativity is all well and good but keep within the established rules, and love is a blessing even when you don't exactly have it in the way that you thought about it, and hey what about a little fucking humor from time to time to break through. Because I have gone back now in time and read your words, and they were not meant even for me here feet on table, legs slagging over the edge, cigarette smoked, and getting smaller again, as I am want to do once I get too full of myself. I am wiser now by far then the girl I was. Nothing is quite so dark and grim and I never talk about hell anymore so it must be resolved. I mortared many bricks to build this fine home using tools I was well taught duty loyalty obligation sacrifice They paid the bills and brought me hunks of marked acrylic with my name in the center. Let someone else get the applause. It wasn't all that and in the end less mattered than I might have thought once I awakened to the reality of who I was sleeping inside those realtor looking jackets and sweating leather flats I kept in abundance in the trunk of my car in case I were to forget to wear shoes to work again. written 8/4/03 4:12 am

 GUSTS Another wind blows me into the tunnel; the concrete pipe kids crawl in and out of, but I stayed. I claimed the walls as my own still refusing birth. Inside, I asked the others to tell me the truth and they did. They were too slow to come up with any questions for me and nobody could match my hours of practice asking questions into the void, the abyss that fed me mother's milk while I scrawled marks on the walls to measure time. It's all here, all of my secrets revealed again, and if I forget another time then yes, again, I will seal the capsule with packing tape one more time and cast my bottle into the sea. written 8/4/03 3:53 am

 LOOP Expression of which is covered over begs for approval removal. All your life you have known who you really are. Sometimes it bubbles to the surface like translucence rainbowing in the sun. Sometimes it pricks like a pebble in an ice skate laced up tight, buried layers deep down in the sock. You never really cared to own your own laughter or delight shared with others still fearing their own shadows, but La Ventana is open wide, proof enough that water can wear down the earth. Wind too, can wash away the strongest stone. Emanate and luminate past the stairs of wonder. Even the way down is up from here. You are here on temporary assignment on a fixed track, in the last car, approaching the final climb. Throw your arms wide into the sky and squeal your way to the end. You have an all day pass from here on out.

 CLOSER UP To whom may you sacrifice your needs to prove? For whom do you toil and ponder nights spent awake, easing the way for dawn? Letting go these images, the after burn of dreams, edges petal crisp, pixilated closer up, eat dot made from another pattern. Whose timeline serves you best? Have you chosen your master well? Do you seek another's hands on your will? The time will not come for you to ask these questions again, in this way, or with this urgency of command. Relinquish the lust for results, acknowledging the answers given you didn't ask for. Nothing can slip through fingers, even held tight, like impatience when a tunnel is bored into the earth or the flesh for a break through centuries overdrawn.

 ON PURPOSE In times of fear, we all fall back on what we think we know to be our strengths when our weakness makes us more human. In a robot vision of life, in step with the crowd or with those breaking free, all of the indecisions are abandoned for better distractions. In the microwaveable vision of life, time is saved by not wondering purpose or planning for trips not yet taken; and everyone has answers they are willing to share. The meaning of life is waiting for you at the convenience store up the street, from the man you see everyday who may not even know your name or the brand you buy; and everyone has answers they refuse to speak of. They have a lot to do with that (w)hole you are trying so hard to fill. So... Dance to another man's beat. Sing the lyrics you didn't write. Stare into the photo you didn't take. Creativity is for what practical purpose anyway or should that question anchor elsewhere. Creativity is for what conversation going on under the surface, projecting as anger or disagreement, or a million things not talked about because there is one thing still undiscussed. What if you were the answer? What if you were the center? Commitment is even harder to make to ones self than to another when stubbornly, the dream refuses to let go when the alarm clock goes off, and still nothing to do on purpose.

 WAVE PARTICLES Tired of sustaining the illusion, she cracks another whip and the music resumes, Lonlied by me, my and mine, she parts the waves to bring the boats to shore a prettier face could have launched into battle. The night slides into tomorrow, skids past midnight, then thud. A few pieces are still missing from next week. Destiny calls and a few are left on hold for way too long. Apologies inner tube down the river in tank tops and flip flops. The window of opportunity was dangled before the point of no return and all of the crickets left for better acoustics someplace else. So what to stay and retrieve... the soul. So what to stay and believe... the soul. Nothing matters more than (fill in the blank) filtered through sand.

 THE MOON WAS STILL UP Anger and pain I can not understand because they are so far underneath your skin even poetry does not release from you their rewards. You compete against the music played to drown you out on purpose as though guitar light could flood the landscape yesterday bright or for pieces of the puzzle glued on cardboard to signify an end. Struggle is synthesized into the equalizing waves of water washing over a brand new day and you are the lighthouse again against rocky shores. Memory unlatches the paper petroglyphs at exactly the right time even though the words are too faint to hear over the lyrics of Van Morrison or the possibility of being completely wrong about all of it.

 DISSEMINATING ARIES Even though the night fades, I hold the connection like sunrise sings the moon to sleep and drives truth into hiding for memories of future hopes of meaning. Nothing has come true yet but it doesn't matter. As long as there is breath to explain the similarities of shadows passed in misdemeanors of youth's lost excuses for being someone. Regulating behavior is completely within the rights of the individual or so the law states. Guidelines are drawn out poster big and glossy or matte depending on the given day or what can be given. The stand still between answers to questions posed or swords drawn for a fight to the death of the ego. Not everyone was famous in their past lives and some of us even are supposed to be who we are exactly as we are right now regardless of who likes it, and those that do. Those who will be with us always are no less worthy of lifting up into truths known by all to be remembered by some. The burden of keeping silent is celebrated only at the first sign of sound. And though there may be more than nothing to it, I am found here in your loss more than you were known to be like me, straightening my spine as rainbows climb my back.

 BACK AND FORTH There have been truths told and promises broken over and over again like time passes through street corners summer has neglected and passed her judgment on before songs stop the conversations going nowhere. The middle path is a reminder and echoes fly like hawks high above La Ventana calling me home as time is marked in different countries. Over everything and nothing, no blame comes; the farewells are predicted in tea leaves, the strained voice of someone knowing there is nothing so something as the peach tree orchard of lost virginities and misled suitors looking for magic, rabbits dead in the hat. The next song starts on speaker phone and she is beyond understanding his control or the drummer boy playing in the background without frankincense or louder still to drown out fingers stretching across time. He asks her if she has found enlightenment yet or if she knows what love is. In this state or that. with control, or without control, or with the knowing glances, the smiles at men with chests pressed out. The owl that came to her on the patio looked in her eyes for truth before the matter was examined, and we heard the same music for the first time pretending it was not the second time this has not happened before or it was not the first time this has happened again before air on the neck, the ceiling fan, the fan on the floor, the wind that calls from canyons in Farmington, secrets of not giving yourself completely enough over until the end.

 MILAREPA'S DANCE Maybe dreams are just the overreaching of money's excuse for not being real enough or owning pain rented out. My grandmother was dying as the paid nurse held her hand and I asked my Mother if this is what money buys. In silent shame I knew the truth no books are bold enough to hold the words for. I am born of this wound made in the earth by accident. I look to the sky for answers in the clouds free to all. I look to the sky for the moon rising, reliable as egg letting go of womb. She is the woman he is looking for and he doesn't believe she exists. Even still her hands stretch out, thumb and forefinger holding the fragile peace. Even still her breathing lights up the room darker than he knows reaching out in ways he can not see, can only feel and she understands.

 I COME TO THE DESERT I come to the desert to find my past, reconnect with roots buried in hard soil played on in childhood, Creosote smells foretelling distant rain the heat evaporates before landing. I come to the desert to find my past, branches of my heart dried like cactus bones, asking acceptance from this earth or these Indian eyes, or these Mexican smiles, who glance over me like forgiveness is all I can earn here under this white skin. White like klan robes, white like eyes opened wide, white like lies told for victories never won in justice. I come to the desert to find my past at the National Atomic Museum, and learn about Nobel scientists, skin mushroom cloud white like mine, and I am demanding to know the half-life of truth. I come to the desert to find my past at the Pueblo museum in plaques defining 19 tribes, each with a paragraph describing their survival among the greed of conquerors using God as a weapon with skin white like mine. I come to the desert to find my people at the museum of Hate and Intolerance, but the gates are closed, guarded by silent kachinas skin bright and bold, not white like mine. I come to the desert to find my purpose at a poetry reading, revealing injustices and lost identities boiled down in this melting pot and listen as though in the truth of another, some answer may be found, but in an instant am shattered when a note scrawled on napkin is passed to me, "This is not Starbuck's," a message for skin white like mine. I come to the desert to find my homeland for I am removed three generations from my name. Perhaps it would be better to find my past in the Polish family who came to this United States to escape their torturers and build generations who could speak the language, who would not have to break backs and cramp fingers in the tobacco fields, picking and sweating and laying leaves across wood to dry. I am told these were my people, strangers to me, I was carried away to the desert when I was three. I was not told their stories until the summer Stasia took me to Chu Chu's to hear her memories of being in the Catholic concentration camp with her son Billy. It was seven years before they escaped, after the war was over, but before liberation came. I come to the desert because these stories do not truly belong to me, and I cannot find comfort in Chu Chu's words at the end of her tale, "the Jews deserved it," her ancient face revealing eyes still unforgiving, betraying her frailty. She was dead four years before I was told. So I come to the desert, seeking community and culture only tasted at restaurants, licking my lips, the color on my body and deny my race, for I am not white, I am beige, beige like these desert sands, beige like these hard rock mountains. I am beige in the sun. I darken my skin in the shadows. I stand alone, the last of my family line, the family who worked to give me the freedom to buy a new history for myself among the madness of conquerors enslavers liars murderers skin white like the blisters on my beige heels, as I walk the desert to find the sacred space to heal my common humanity.

 SOMEPLACE NEW AGAIN I have had it with trolling for visions. The fish never bite and I feel kind of funny pulling them up from the depths, considering the bends and all. Though flashy colors and neon have always caught my fancy, I realize there is more to pretty than that which remains when eyes are closed. Life is everywhere and I am. Life is a kaleidoscope and I am up late feeling the magic of dreams cast by my neighbors, and happiness is found in simply being happy. After all, freedom isn't about freeing everyone else. Let everyone find his own cloud monsters and try to break them up with the power of his will alone. Let everybody find her own set of flannel sheets to sleep comfortably at night. We ride our bikes on parallel paths and I am no more than just a few inches from you. We climb our mountains with the same weight of gravity tugging at our boots and I have no idea if this rope will hold. The end result is never really an ending, but begin here just in case you think you have arrived someplace new again.

 FROM FLAMES If there were an answer, then the questions would stop, and with nothing left to ask, only silence could recognize you. I have reached to the stars, I have followed shamans to their sleeping shadows, passed the sighs of discontent, crept down stairs of sameness, felt the pains of misunderstood strangers wanting to be loved for that spark of light the others ignored in them. I dusted them off and shined them up, as though God cared for something cleaner than strength while night folded in on itself, while time marked herself with one leg raised and love rested unrequited for a while. What's not to be afraid of for those who wait for even the first step to emerge from the abyss or their leg to twitch towards liberation. I followed that map to oblivion time and time again until I realized it was only a representation. I gagged and bound my ego in retribution and drove past the dream of being more than myself by being the Self, the ultimate trip up down the path of illusory greatness. Still the songs played on like trickling fingertips on skin, light and playful and wanting. Still the lyrics illuminated the more than enoughness of love regardless of regard. And night folded in on herself, marking time with man made clocks towards our own (un)timely demise or time to arise from these flames like the Phoenix with brightly colored wings who flies because she can. Flap, flap, flap.

 A STEP CLOSER TO STEPPING OFF Voices raised like hands above heads, like waves of fingers piano playing the air, accidental harmonies wanting an end or just wanting more. The world spins out of synch, faster and hotter, like water spills like steam rises, like warm mud or the soft underbellies of earth worms, making their way home while everybody goes about his business. Drums beat to mark the passage; the young girls dance while the boys look on, ying and yang pushed to a crescendo, cutting through the cage, as if victory is nothing more than a barrier breached again and again. For whose benefit are these metaphors and significances and coincidences? For whose reward are these smiles and knowing winks and a nudge and a nudge and a nudge? Wrong, wrong, wrong but will we know right when we see it? Bad, bad, bad but will we know good when we see it? The opposites define themselves into each other, merging and melting into the mud, and the earthworms go about their business, while everybody makes her way home. The shouting turns to singing, turns to whispers, turns to laughter, turns to silence and then a rest between notes.

 GERMINATION The flowers you gave me are beginning to open on my window sill; red rose taking on a new shape as the day progresses, overpowering the black-eyed susans. As a gift to Spot, I bring the vase out to the patio where he sprawls in catlike bliss on the current dining room table. Stretching out, he purrs, rubbing his face into the leaves, losing his balance in wonder over the smells, and the leaves, and the tiny yellow petals reaching out from their branches until a lizard catches his eye and it's just me here, remembering the bouquet held in your hands the night before last.

 RIGHT NOW letting it all come and go and flow without regard to time or spaces between us and even words and even dreams and even and even gentle strength learning not to direct the waves but to sink soar rise the crest and soft back into petals those times when you are not and those times when you are the right balance towards upwards the middle path and back down casting no rings on the water

 emergence and separation In no time at all and all time, the words from fingertips are creeping to the surface. Cross the bridge, open the gate; and it's all countless tribes of butterflies and the passing from moon, to sun, to moon, to sun, only clouds can deny the eye.

 TOO LATE Not writing has become a metaphor for my life; instead of finished work behind me, ahead lies scraps of started interrupted thoughts, leading to what is unknown at present; and I am behind myself, watching like talons underfoot tickle gashes, moving still under currents, thoughtless, running from something, giving up the dream again all too soon, again all too late to never finish the painting or poem. What half am I trying so hard to whole with; complete my self, male, female, animal; and planets spin and align, and astrologers interpret for the apathetic masses. I shined too bright to be believable and when daybreak crashed against the bedroom wall, I was too hungry for the comfort and warmth of eyes and arms and legs to wrap around to tell the truth to even myself; finding out too late, just as good as never finding out at all.

 UNWRAPPED Yesterday afternoon, we weeded our first garden and tilled the soil. Now each breath we take is a greater symbol than jumping from a plane. Your fingers touch mine and the perfect fit of the palms together are more than two breaths finding rhythm. Each day more is unwrapped and contents spill from morning, to afternoon, to evening. I am below and above and beside it all, looking forward as if it's the first time that direction ever existed for me at all.

 Cloud Space During the time when you have not yet been to life or death; everything everyone told you was important; still is. Dreams are something to interpret to find your inner questions. All purposes must have a goal at the end to cross and the sooner, the better. You have not yet seen the bricks. Cloud space on blue sky that should be white. What is clear but the absence of something blocking. Less to edit endlessly in the head and the players still seeming to act from a different script. Before the veil is lifted, before it is too indescribably beautiful to believe, innocent as the smooth skin on the side of a blade of grass, and you might even forget sometimes to look at the sunset or to remember when the moon will next be full. Easier to love in another while simply passing through the absence of clouds.

 reflecting the sun In what ways does life change; thoughts going through and out alongside 64 violins the night the spiritual leader of Palestine was assassinated, just holding your hand; to go forward with a dream lived now, in even the journey north together; just to see your face in the morning, again and again; and warm skin touching somewhere before sleeping positions are established. So many stories still untold and a language left to learn and experiences to share; while the Aries moon scatters her seeds into the earth; rises, wispy outline but still there reflecting the sun.

 BACK FROM NOWHERE For weeks the wind has been howling backwards, blowing not a leaf but the sound and the rumble inside is like a passing train. The whistle never blows here in this town too far from major arteries; still there are tracks to cross back and forth and harder on a bike. And this is home now. I keep reminding myself how happy I am to have so much shade again. I keep reminding myself how lucky I am to have found someone who will live with me and my faults, little lines that open up the earth with a crack to fill with water. And I keep reminding myself that it's okay to live without forever, it was only a word anyway. Nights like these, the distant traffic sounds from Waldo Road are as comforting as any waves reaching the shore but I still strain to hear a few planes or the helicopter landing on Broward General or searching for crime. It's small town life and my space is smaller too. I'm still learning to share. It's so much easier for me to give. You are asleep now, resting for work and dreams I do not understand. Sometimes I wonder if we weren't closer apart.

 TWITCH Blepharospasm is another way of saying an eye twitch; different than a blink or a wink; unexpected now and utterly unwanted. They say it's stress related but I don't want to look inside anymore for answers. Haven't I opened that door, let in wind through that window, and buried myself whole in a hole where the rain came... but it didn't even work last time anyway and how am I supposed to get health insurance with a record like this playing on...skip...skip.

 record scratches on the harmonica solo Grieving myself into I box, I saw the sun through narrow slits, and clouds forming and the voices of all the arms around me drawing near, too near. Each is in her own stage of dying down the mattered ways of age and giving up something for lent. A thousand opportunities to grow and close and dance alone as one, the dust rising from the road below his feet, as thunder invites the rain forward in time. Beasts and burdens, the bud opening again and again rather than giving up the flower pot. A daisy in your hair or a paper airplane and still these questions slam dunk, rock the surface of the walls until the paint peels off like wallpaper and someone is still not here. No fortune left to chance as the craving of the ring moves like shadows on the movie theater wall, tickles the projectionist for a moment, then moves on. And we are not the wind. And we are not the sail. And we are not the ship, the bow, the galley. And we are not the passing hour, the memory of yesterday's tomorrow. muddled through, hands still clenching like a baby's fist. Knowing who you are is all the more reason to fight the form, only half of what could be if letting go were that easy. Merge me into your flesh and give me a reason to stay in the now longer than a blink. Welcome me home, distracting the ending one more time.

 wonka's soliloquy on the wonkatania there's no earthly way of knowing which direction we are going there's no knowing where we're rowing or which way the river's flowing is it raining is it snowing is a hurricane a-blowing bleh! not a speck of light is showing so the danger must be growing are the fires of hell a glowing? is the grisly reaper mowing? yes! the danger must be growing for the rowers keep on rowing and they're certainly not showing any signs that they are slowing! we're there

Give everyone the benefit of the doubt, and use the intensity of this lunation to focus on productive matters pertaining to your sign. The Full Moon period signifies the peak of the waxing Moon energy... a great time to focus on spiritual, magical energies in order to direct them through meditation or personal ritual. Many also focus once again on the goals that were set at the previous New Moon, and utilize the intensity of the Full Moon to release their intentions to the Universe with gratitude and respect.

 Current Phase: Balsamic in Taurus After the winnings are gathered up and the points are on the board, another game still goes on. Despite all accomplishments, larger questions always loom. After the second breaking point between Antithetical and Primary, we find those people who always take a deeper look. Sometimes they are driven to extremes by what they see. Sometimes they become the moral proprietors of their societies. In the end, it is only the freedom of the mind to understand. The fourth quarter pushes beyond where social traditions (Instinct), gut feelings (Emotion) and mental brilliance (Intellect) can go. This is the place where all that experience is weighed in the balance of the big picture. Balsamic phase is the best time for destroying weeds, pruning trees, and all preparation for the next cycle.

 Current Phase: Last Quarter Moon in Gemini The Last Quarter Moon brings a period of reflection and reevaluation. Internally, you are reorienting your priorities away from what has already transpired toward something new. Your focus now is on achieving the realization of a deeper meaning in your life. You may find yourself questioning your beliefs and values and discarding what no longer fits in order to make room for what you are discovering about yourself. Ultimately, this can bring about a complete turning away from something that was once important to you. You have the potential now to break through old limitations and release what no longer works for you. While you may not yet have a clear vision of where you're heading next, know that in tearing down old structures you're opening the door for new, exciting dreams to take root.

 Current Phase: Last Quarter Moon in Leo Monday 9:27 PM PST Sun 5 Leo The Leo Moon nurtures our very life force, helps us grow and see our beauty, our strengths and our talents. A Leo Moon nourishes and protects our ability to hold onto the child inside and to take risks to experience the truth of love and enjoyment. Expect dramatic and energized emotions. Many of the natural characteristics of the Moon are absorbed and nullified when she is in Leo, the natural domicile of the Sun. Key word is Pride. The Moon in Leo also strengthens the influence of the Sun, and right now, the sun sits in Scorpio. The last quarter phase lets you know it's time to adjust your attitude and follow new inspirations. Leo Traits: Enthusiasm for self and others expressed in an authoritative and proud manner.

 Current Phase: Gibbous in Pisces Wednesday 9:17 PM PDT Neptune 8 Pisces Until Monday 12:21 AM PDT when we switch to Mars 27 Aries Fourth Phase (Gibbous): This phase looks like the Full Moon, but is not. This is a growth and overcoming phase. This can also be a time of tension. A time when there is a crescendo of all the projects begun in the First Phase. During this phase, you're getting ready and finishing things up. The Gibbous Moon is a time to analyze, evaluate, and prepare magick. The Fourth Phase is a good time to do magick for artistic endeavors, beauty, patience, health, fitness, change, and decisions. Night and Star Goddesses correspond with the Gibbous Moon. Pisces Traits: Pisces is the twelfth sign of the zodiac.

 Current Phase: First Quarter in Capricorn The Moon is the First Quarter Moon when it separates from the Sun (after a New Moon) at an angle of 90 degrees (square). This square (which looks like a half moon in the sky) asks us to take care of the small things that grow into big uncomfortable things. If tensions come up, it's because you need to look at some part of a relationship or emotional structure in your daily life that just isn't working right and may need more thought. The First Quarter Moon is the first aspect since the New Moon that asks us to look at our newly devised plans from a distance that gives us a first glimpse of objectivity. This can create a sensitive issue or it can give you the resolve necessary to make improvements and keep going. Capricorn Traits: Capricornians are ambitious, resolute, cold minded, melancholic. Fatigue never makes them afraid, they work hard and are ready to sacrifice themselves, if necessary. They plan patiently and carefully all their objectives and the way to reach them. To achieve their results they are ready to do anything, without asking any help. They are reserved and introverted, but sometimes they live sudden moments of impulsiveness. Their main characteristics are shyness and insecurity which disappear when they realize of being loved and appreciated. Sources: urlLink ArtCharts urlLink RealMagick

 Current Phase: Gibbous in Aries Begins Friday 2:38 PM PST / Ends: Tuesday 5:34 PM PST The key of this phase seems to be about focusing on oneself, and not turning too much of an intense eye towards others' imperfections. This is the last phase of the first half of the cycle, so it is meant to be very much self-oriented. The Gibbous Moon is best spent with deep awareness of oneself, in preparation for the Full Moon or relationships. The symbolic new moon seed now buds. About Aries (Ruler Mars): The first sign of the zodiac has an aggressive self-assertive quality. Planets in Aries take on an initiating, fiery, and highly active disposition. When positively aspected Aries can be accomplishing, highly self-confident, and apt to draw a following due to the pronounced leadership abilities. When negatively aspected, planets here take on a selfish energy, one which acts too quickly and leaps into situations head-first without proper preparation. Aries is the first to get things started and can be combative when blocked or denied. Sources: urlLink Astrology for the Soul urlLink Zodiac House

 Current Phase: Full Moon in Gemini Begins Thursday 2:11 PM EST / Ends: Monday 7:19 AM EST The Full Moon is the time when the Moon reflects the greatest amount of the Sun's light. The Earth is astronomically poised between the Sun and the Moon, enabling us to see two different sides of ourselves clearly, something the Gemini energy is adept at spotting. The opposing but equally-pulling gravitational pull of the Sun and the Moon also reveals a tension within ourselves. The polarity of Gemini is Sagittarius.The polarity of a sign, is the sign that is opposite it in the zodiac. Since we are in the Sagittarius lunar cycle, that tension may be more pronounced. By providing enough distance and light to give us an objective view of ourselves and how we relate to others, the Full Moon works to integrate and harmonize the contradictions in ourselves and others. This opening of increased awareness traditionally makes the Full Moon a beneficial time for meditation on personal and worldwide issues. There's literally an electrical energy build-up before a Full Moon and a release just after the peak. At the Full Moon, the seeds sown at the last New Moon are ready to be harvested and used ~~ we reap what we've sown. Working out the energy through the physical body can be grounding and centering. About Gemini (Ruler Mercury): The Astrological Symbol of Gemini is the Twins. Like their sign, the twins, they often have a dual nature and are skilled at seeing both sides of a problem, but they may also be fickle and restless. Within the Zodiac, Gemini is opposite Sagittarius, the sign of philosophy. While Sagittarius tends to have one major interest that is studied deeply, Gemini people tend to have many different interests they study in less detail. The element of Gemini is air. Air is vital to human survival. Without air, we would perish. Air is the power of movement; of freshening and of intellignce. Its the invisible and yet quite real mixture of gases that we breathe in every day. The three air signs are Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius. In astrology, air stands for intellect, reason and communication. The quality of Gemini is mutable. The four mutable signs Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, and Pisces. In astrology, the mutable quality signifies versatility, adaptability, openness to change, and flexibility. Gemini - Full Moon Meditation from urlLink The Labours of Hercules I recognize my other self and while this fades I grow and glow. (May 21 - June 20) This full moon meditation series is based on an astrological interpretation of the twelve labors of Hercules from the Greek myth. The twelve tasks of Hercules are symbolic lessons for every human from the way of selfishness back to the Heart of God. As mortals we do not exactly know the way to the higher worlds but the path itself knows and leads us through sometimes dramatic experiences to our goal. So we travel "on the path until we become that path", from Aries to Taurus and Gemini - and further through all the astrological signs to Pisces. In Gemini active work sets the standard tone. First comes the premonition, later the certain knowledge; eventually we recognize through daily work - after mental control in Aries and overcome desire in Taurus - the light of God everywhere. In the third sign of the astrological year, Gemini, the Twins, Hercules is called again from his own inner light to go further and accept the next task: Go out to search the sacred tree and gather the golden apples of the Hesperides. Unfold the power to search without discouragement, deception or too great speed. Perseverance holds the key. The task appears to be easy and Hercules hurries into it. But the garden of the Hesperides is protected by a hundred-headed dragon and three virgins. Throughout the land Hercules passes, seeking the sacred tree, but without success. He is deaf to the inner voice and blind for all signs along the way. From North he turns to South and wrestles with Antaeus, the serpent in the place of darkness. Antaeus overcomes him at every point until Hercules is able to lift the serpent, with both arms, high in the air, off from the ground. To the West Hercules now turns with new courage. He meets Busiris, the great deceiver, son of the waters, who pretends to know the truth alone. Hercules loves and adores Busiris, follows him and becomes bound by him for a whole year. Finally Hercules turns inwards and realises that "Truth lies within yourself". So he breaks the bonds and continues with the search wiser than before. A pain-filled screem intrudes the ear of Hercules, the one of Prometheus, chained upon a rock, his liver being hacked by vultures, thus slowly killing him. Hercules breaks the binding chain, frees Prometheus und looks after him until he recovers from his wounds. With much loss of time Hercules turns to the high mountains of the East, meeting Atlas on his way carrying the load of worlds upon his back. Hercules watches and gauges the measure of the load and pain. He forgets about his search and decides to aid the giant without delay. So he shoulders the burden of his brother unto his own back. But lo! the load rolls off and he stands free and likewise Atlas. From the loving hands of Atlas he gets the long awaited golden apples. Three sisters - Aegle, Erythea and Hesperis - await him with more apples declaring "The Way to us is always marked by service. Deed of love are signposts on the Way". The story ends with Hercules returning the apples to the three sisters "for those who follow". The sign of Gemini consists of two pillars connected with a half-moon shaped arch: One pillar is open at the bottom, the other at the top. They symbolise the lower nature (body, feeling, mind) and the higher Self (atma-buddhi-manas). The pairs of opposites reveal themselves especially forceful in this sign - the higher Self striving upwards, the form aspect drawing downwards. Five tests Hercules has to pass before the fruits of Wisdom become his own: Sincerity, Alertness, Persistence, the Unfolding of Power for the search, and - finally - the selfless loving Service for others. In Gemini, we learn to recognize the presence of the Higher Self. In the beginning one is aware of voice but does not hear, one sees or has a premonition of some danger but is blind until all assumptions and beliefs are transformed into knowledge and experience. Prometheus stands for the escape from the bondage of the mind, Atlas symbolizes the freedom and readiness to carry "the Weight of the World". Both, Prometheus and Atlas are witnesses on the way to our awareness of the higher Self. Loving compassion born of right thinking will lead us towards the goal. The keynote signifies that the lower nature (body, feelings and mind) - symbolized in the lower pillar of the sign - has to fade and become submerged to the higher Self which will then grow and glow.

 Current Phase: Full Moon in Leo Sunday 3:52pm PST until Wednesday 11:26 PM PST when it moves into Libra Leo has a real sense of specialness and perceives all it creates as gifts bestowed upon the rest of us in the name of love and life. Anything can happen under the influence of this most romantic of Moons. Leo loves to be the center of attention, so get out there and shine! For those of you who made commitments to life changes on the New Moon in Aquarius, this is the time to put those plans into action. You get to begin your new life with the self-confidence of a Leo Full Moon opposing Uranus in Aquarius, which represents the radical energy to throw out the old and bring in the new. The Venus and Chiron conjunction in Capricorn will give you added strength to achieve your goals; no matter how hard and long it takes. Remember that on a Full Moon, it helps to release your old behavior through ritual. This is a Full Moon of great inspiration and should not be wasted. If you have been suffering with creative blocks, the Leo Full Moon bestows the energy to break free of inertia and get into action. If it doesn't, you might reconsider your project or direction. Maybe it's just not the right one This year the Leo Full Moon will be directly opposite Uranus in Aquarius. Some think that Aquarius and Leo are diametrically opposed to one another. But I find their synergistic and interdependent relationship unique among the signs. Aquarius demands radical change, which cannot be accomplished without Leo's talents: unwavering self-belief in one's personal vision and true leadership. Leo demands creativity and caring, which requires the Aquarian rejection of personal glorification in favor of global identification. When balanced, the Leo/Aquarius polarity works hand in hand to further the evolution of human civilization. Corruption, greed and suffering only exist when these energies lack equilibrium. The Leo Full Moon assures us all that we have great personal power and we must learn to use it judiciously. This is the Full Moon to try on the role of leader. If you have wanted to come out front with your great ideas, this is the time to try. The connection with ego identity is strong on this Full Moon. Leo understands how much power it can wield, and will never shy away from using this knowledge to accomplish even the most outrageous goals. Forget the stereotypical Leo: a partygoer dancing with a lampshade on their head. Instead, think of showing up with a serious commitment to who you are and not backing down for anything. Leo is total self-belief and it uses total commitment to gain success and glory. Think of Madonna (Sun in Leo); she is a powerful presence who insists upon owning her vision and maintaining total control of the product. As we say in Silicon Valley, "it's all about believing your own marketing." Yes, of course there is a dark side to power and glory. We all know that an inflated ego creates the right conditions for abuses of power. But power used wisely can be of great benefit to all. The beauty of Leo is how much it truly cares about others, and since this is a Full Moon, let's get into a celebratory space and bask in the light of Leo's positive qualities. This is the most dramatic, elegant and fun Full Moon of the year. So get out and enjoy the fireworks! Source: urlLink Astrowisdom

 urlLink April 2003 Outlook from Moonsurfing.com Dear Moonsurfers, The Moon is New in Aries on Tuesday April 1st at 11:19 AM PST. Happy Lunar New Year! Boy, oh boy, oh boy. Mars is closer to earth than it's been in 79,000 years! The pressure to handle this planet's energy was never stronger. The high road for this energy is that of the sacred warrior while the low road reminds us that when colored with fear, assertion can become aggression. This New Moon in Aries brings you golden opportunities to redefine and redirect the way you use this personally assertive energy. Here's the cosmic context. The Sun, Moon, and Mercury are partying in Aries, so blunt speech, as in speaking without thinking could make you the April Fool. Use the quick-paced mental skills of Mercury's presence in Aries to think before you speak and come up with positive loving scenarios and brilliant win-win solutions. Channel your energy into positive avenues that support your self-confidence. Get ready for a shot of growth and optimism as Jupiter turns direct on April 3rd after a retrograde period that started on Dec. 4th. This gave you an opportunity to look at the things in your life that you don't want expanding. Eliminate these with the help of Spirit as Jupiter movesforward and the spark you ignite with your intentions can grow quickly. Mars, the ruling planet of this Aries New Moon, currently travels through Capricorn and unites exactly with Chiron while squaring the Moon, Sun, Capricorn. What this means is that action will be taken and there will be some changes made. Use your energy efficiently and, when old wounds come up, remain open to alternative ways of dealing and healing. This New Moon is a gift of enormous personal creative energy from the universe to use as you wish, so step forward boldly and courageously hand in hand and heart to heart with Spirit. Claim the adventure that is your life and make of it what you desire. Remember that old Chinese proverb that says, "The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step." Wishing you a Gloriously Creative New Moon, Claudia

Joseph Addison The Taurus New Moon on May Day kicks off a powerful planetary boogie that lasts all month long! This holiday celebrates Maia, the mother goddess, and coincides with the New Moon in the first earth sign of the zodiac, Taurus. Deepen your connection with the material world through your senses, your body, your possessions, and Mother Nature herself. This is the first of two New Moons in May and the magic of new beginnings, along with the pressure to take out the garbage, is seriously amplified by the addition of two eclipses at the time of the Full Moon and the 2nd New Moon. Be sure to sign up for the upcoming Telephone Seminar during the Full Moon Phase on May 18th. You'll learn how to harness all of these dynamic life-changing energies and have an opportunity to ask me your questions. As you take stock of resources and define security, and abundance for yourself, you're building a base for your life to come. Earthly practicalities must be tended to and here are the cosmic currents urging you on. A grand fixed cross squarely provides the kick-off and guarantees a change in the physical status quo. The first leg is occupied by the Sun (Spirit shining through the material world of resources), the Moon (emotional need for material grounding and security), Mercury retrograde (encouraging slow, patient, penetrating review of your consciousness regarding personal and planetary resources), and Ceres (Goddess of the Earth encouraging you to nurture yourself by communing and creating with nature) all in Taurus. The next leg is occupied by Jupiter in Leo on one side (inviting an enlightened basis for security and wealth), Neptune in Aquarius on the other (targeting areas of collective confusion and deception and shifting perceptions concerning our humanitarian dreams), and the last leg held up by Juno in Scorpio (bringing opportunities to break through to new levels of abundance through equitable sharing of power and resources). This cosmic standoff can be used for great creativity and progress or to produce deception and gluttony. Chiron, retrograde at 18 degrees Capricorn, demands we know when less can be more, for the long-term good of our personal and planetary health. The challenge and gift of a Taurus Moon is unconditional self-love and acceptance. Never underestimate the value of your greatest resource, yourself in co-creatorship with Spirit. Getting clear about what and how much you really need to thrive can help you eliminate excess stuff. This helps you reclaim precious energy you'll need so you're able to take advantage of the dynamic life-changing energies in store for you this month. Things don't happen easily or quickly now. Plant an intention to strengthen your patience and maintain a positive focus. Claudia

 CANCER LUNAR CYCLE June 29 - July 27 from urlLink http://www.moonsurfing.com/ The Cancer lunar cycle marks our entry into the 2nd quarter of the lunar year. Tune into feelings and take decisive action to further your creative goals as the light and waxing energy increases. Ideas and resources focused on in the first quarter of this lunar year will provide nourishment for the creative birthing that is to come. This lunar energy engenders highly intuitive emotionally sensitive energy. Take advantage of opportunities to target and heal emotional stumbling blocks so you can manifest the reality you truly want. Emotional and spiritual nourishment are emphasized. It's important that you manage this energy by taking care of your needs so they're not projected onto your relationships and the world at large. Spend time at home to make it more comfortable and inviting for you and your family. Enjoy music, good food, relish your emotional connections, and soothe your soul with creative pursuits. This lunar month ruled by the Moon reminds you that you can't draw from an empty well. Revisit and reclaim that which nurtures and nourishes you on the deepest levels.

This is the climax to a very cosmically complex month. Remember the importance of breathing fully and deeply. May 30th, or 31st depending n your time zone, is the 2nd brand new beginning gifted to us by the month of May and the accompanying solar eclipse provides us with the opportunity to move forward in new directions, provided we've allowed ourselves to process the feelings stirred up by the Full Moon lunar eclipse. Imagination and magic are heightened at the time of this New Moon ( the 2nd New Moon in one month is called a Black Moon in the Wiccan tradition and denotes a time when magic/alchemy is extremely powerful.) A sextile to this New Moon from Jupiter in Leo (expansion and broader horizons) and Neptune in Aquarius (our field of dreams) sends a message telling us that we can create what we can imagine. Don't put too much on your plate or you'll lose your focus and sacrifice much-needed clarity. This eclipse may well pop information concerning the shady dealings of Congress and the FCC concerning private and corporate media interests in radio and television broadcasting. Freedom of speech and communication is a basic tenet upon which this country was built, so stay aware of what's happening and make those calls and write those letters. The shift from Taurus (ruler of the throat) to Gemini within the month of May reminds you to let your voice be heard. On June 3rd, Saturn vacates Gemini after a 3-year stay and begins a journey through Cancer that will last until July 16, 2005. Woman's issues will be more prominent and the political, economic, and personal lessons of the last 30 years come up for a reality check. (The first woman's bank, the first woman to climb Mt. Everest, the first woman priests ordained in the Anglican and Episcopalian churches, as well as Watergate, worldwide inflation and the oil embargo/energy crisis marked the last transit of Saturn through Cancer.) Venus (ruler of Taurus, love, beauty and the way we attract what we need on the material plane) and Mercury (the way we think and assimilate information) are united in Taurus reminding us to connect heart and mind to find win-win solutions. Stay positive, keep an open mind, cultivate a willingness to listen, and tune into the adventurous excitement of the new world that's opening up. Remember that your consciousness creates, so reflect and get ready to co-create a new direction by committing your thoughts, feelings, words, and actions to the universal mind of which we're all a part.

 VIRGO LUNAR CYCLE Aug 27 - Sep 24, 2003 The New Moon in Virgo on August 27 begins a 29.6-day cycle about developing analytical skills , a sense of discrimination and the ability to recognize patterns . This preparatory stage in the process of our development gives us time to improve our situation by attending to details. The simple rituals of daily life will provide the grounding necessary for balance. This is an especially good period to work on the mind-body connection. Analyze and adjust daily routines to support physical and mental well being. Good health, altruistic service and productive employment support success; practicality and prudence guarantee it. Use this cycle to refine and revise the spark of intention you ignited last spring. It's time to redesign the form the future will take. Mercury is Retrograde from (Aug 28-Sept 20). Retrograde means redo, rethink, rewrite, revaluate, revisit, and reanalyze. Over the next three weeks we will have the opportunity to see what needs changing in work, health, finances, and life. Mercury loves to play hide-and-go-seek with every area of communication including, travel, cars, (traffic jams), computers, break downs, and lost items. This creates an environment of whacky, crazy-making events and mishaps. Timing is everything! If you can wait, do not sign anything until after September 20th, your patience will pay off. Mercury is the Messenger to the gods (archetypes). He travels freely between worlds your conscious mind (the part of you reading this right now), and the subconscious (that which is just below the threshold of your awareness) i.e., dreams, true desires, wishes. And, the unconscious mind, the unknown part of Self made conscious through others, by mirroring back to us what is deeply hidden both light, and dark. All of life is energy. I am energy. You are energy. The personal and planetary astrology represents the energy patterns in motion we are currently utilizing (working with) consciously or unconsciously. We live cycles within cycles. With the Moon in Virgo and Jupiter the planet of wealth, blessings, gifts from the gods, and expansion, moving into Virgo also, where Jupiter will stay for the next year, we are invited to heal our health and advance our careers. Watch for making mountains(Jupiter) out of molehills (Virgo). We are building towards the fullmoon. Plant your seeds (New Moon) and prepare for the harvest (Full Moon). In this cycle of Virgo perfection, why not practice being "unconditionally constructive" that is no self-criticism or criticism of others, continuously focus on the positive, if we send out positive energy we will get back positive results, this is the Law of Attraction. What is working in your life? Instead of getting caught up in the negatives and fueling frustration, why not express gratitude for your blessings and practice the Law of Allowing. Explore this Virgo cycle deeply and the secrets of financial/personal success. Money is not the root of all-evil. It is what we do with it! We must evolve beyond the fear of money, sense of limitation, and struggle. The power (global) elite are crumbling! We the people are winning. As bad as things may seem, events are minuscule compared to what was seen (prophesized). We are moving into the light (energy) of the fifth dimension, a vibration of love, compassion and abundance. Monthly Affirmation: I serve the highest good through Love. I filter information without judgment. I find perfection in the moment. Interpretation by urlLink Zodiac Arts and urlLink Kelley Rosano

 LEO LUNAR CYCLE July 28 - August 26 Interpretation by Maya del Mar from urlLink http://www.daykeeperjournal.com Leo is about expressing our selfhood, our personal centers, the heart of ourselves, that natural order within us which comes from spirit, and the expression of which gives our lives joy and drama and meaning. Leo is about integrity, nobility, honor, generosity, being true to the unfolding of ourselves and sharing that unfolding freely. In Cancer we created our personal, safe spot, our home port, our power place. Now in Leo we can grow in the garden which weve created, and blossom there for all the world to see. Leo is associated with flower gardens, which capture the sun not for utility but for beautys sake, simply to show off the splendors of life. On joyous and ceremonial occasions we give flowers, a symbol of sharing the divine love which we feel in our hearts. Leo is a time when we have the power to bring new life energy from our deepest humanitarian resources into expression in our character and daily activities. Think of the Sun, endlessly radiating heat and light to the solar system. Now we can incorporate that great energy into our own centers. Leo leads to growth in our creative talents by strengthening both mind and will. Abstract thought is stimulated, as is power, confidence, and enthusiasm. Our receptivity to subtle forces and the powers of the imagination are also increased. Self-mastery can take a giant leap during Leo time, leading to a new appreciation of our capabilities and an enhanced feeling of identity. Leo is also inspirational. Vacationing, traveling, enjoying and celebrating the beauties of creation are Leonian. The greatest expression of Leo is lovethe divine force which nurtures that which it has created. So now, during Leo time, let the love flowlove of nature, love of ourselves, love of our fellow humans, and love of the omnipresent divine spark. Bill Clinton is a very Leo type. Notice his lions mane, his commanding presence, and the magnetic radiance which beams from him. He has created his own life and forged his own destiny with a strong sense of purpose, and in the process has inspired people around him, all Leo qualities. Carl Jung, with sun in Leo, broke from Freud and viewed the psyche as an evolving, growing center from which, like a mandala, life patterns radiatean expression of the sun within ourselves. Rosalynn Carter and Jacqueline Onassis are examples of Leo First Ladies. They both illustrate the natural dignity of Leo. Pride and arrogance can be Leo pitfalls."

 urlLink SCORPIO LUNAR CYCLE by Crystal Pomeroy Oct. 25 - Nov. 22 This Scorpio New Moon begins the lunar cycle marked by Samhain, Halloween (originally, Hallows Mass), El Da de los Muertos, and All Souls' Daythe classic Scorpio festivities around the world. Prayerful reflection sets this lunation and the intense energies it entails off to a high-vibration start. It also gives us a chance to move into the years end from a most constructive mental and spiritual position, especially with the very strong Saturn influences. According to ancient pagan and neo-pagan tradition, the days preceding and marking mid-autumn are the high point of the year, a time at which many of lifes most powerful aspects were traditionally celebrated. The current lunar cycle is most apt for resurrecting their energies, in a post-pagan world which tends to deny and repress the vital themes associated with the end of harvest, such as: change, death, Earth as our mother, the love that we feel towards her and towards those who have departed from the physical plane, and our individual power to tap into transpersonal forces . According to the ancient custom, the harvest-end festivities serve to thank the earth for her bounties, to thank Spirit, and to share both thanks and fruits with all loved ones, including those who have moved on from the material plane, honoring them personally in the realm of invisible life they now inhabit. From these days forth, no fruit could be harvested until the following year, to give the earth a rest. On special, colorful altars or tables, places were set and food prepared and served for departed loved ones (and to this day, still are by Wikkans and Central Americans of native descent). At its heyday, this multi-dimensional, highly emotive holiday was a collective expression which underscored and fortified divine human nature, that higher potential whose scope is larger than mere consumption, physical survival and material appearances, capable of honoring and venerating all beings, including those (Mother Earth, disincarnate souls and other subtle entities) whose messages are audible to the spiritual (vs. merely physical) ear. The race memory of this tradition, as well as the energies of the sky and earth themselves at this time, make of the Samhain New Moon a truly miraculous portal which anyone can access to multiply blessings in all areas of personal and global existence , with prayers like the following, which can be included in a Samhain gathering or done privately, and which are adapted to current cultural terms and understanding: strengthening tolerance at its deepest level, sending light to our departed loved ones, and invoking the amazing power of endings so available at this time, to annul whatever circumstances seem to have delayed successful consolidation of the passing years goals . Stay tuned to our meditation for the Full Moon within this same cycle, designed to fill out our autumnal acts of inner power with visualizations which activate our mystical, feminine (in both men and women) power of attraction to magnetize whatever we need to finish our years work, as we will also share a magical Full Moon offering to heal Mother Earth. Before the actual altar and prayer suggestions, lets reflect on what this particular Samhain New Moon has to do with tolerance. In the first place, Wikkans especially focus on that virtue at this time, as they pay homage their predecessors who were burned at the stake by European churches. Furthermore, the intense Saturn stationary-retrograde which takes place right with this New Moon gives us a chance to effectively remake how we exercise our moral, and, as it is in Cancer, emotional, judgment nature. Metaphysically speaking, we have a chance to soften the punishing patriarch within, informing our judgment nature with love , staying the mental hand that would condemn without previous, compassionate reflection. Tolerance is a personal and global necessity. As remotely savage as the witch-burnings may seem, the danger of such extreme, thoughtless outbursts will lurk ever beneath the surface of our daily normalcy until we include careful, open-minded consideration, both compassionate and rational, in our a way of thought and life. Politically, such an approach can protect us from mass manipulation into rash, fundamentalist support of scapegoating, such as evidenced in Nazi Germany, the McCarthy witch-hunts, modern day treatment of Muslims, and the recent special elections in California. The following principle is inscribed on the emerald tablet, "As above, so below." If you are still reading this by now, chances are youre among those who consider ourselves relatively tolerant. In such cases, prayer is a strong ally to pass from philosophic lenience to the ability to release emotional condemnation of those whose value systems diverge, even widely, from our own. Moral tolerance does not necessarily imply putting up with unacceptable conditions, but rather staying free from the judgment trap , of sentencing those that differ from our most cherished tenets. Prayer for this intent can release us to the Power of Higher Love, which in turn will touch our personal realms, eventually influencing the larger communities of city, state, country and globe, lifting all levels up into a magical sphere of protection for the planet, for Spirit, for ourselves and for every visible and invisible being. This dimension of inner abundance will survive even when our outer forms, like the harvests last fruits, are released unto Mother Earth. Call on the Power of Endings to usher in a happy close to your passing year! 1) Make a list of those goals for work and other applied efforts you can remember having at the beginning of 2003. 2) On another page, briefly describe those activities, situations, behaviors, beliefs or attachments which you feel have kept you from consolidating those goals. 3) Call on the Angel of Endings, and ask her to assist you in accepting the demise of whatever situations would delay the consolidation of your divine plan for 2003. Then declare aloud, 13 times, as you visualize their meaning: I CALL ON THE POWER OF ENDINGS WHICH IS NOW RENEWING THE EARTH, TO ELIMINATE ALL THAT WOULD DELAY THE CONSOLIDATION OF MY HIGHEST WORK. JUST AS LEAVES NOW FALL AWAY AND ARE DISSOLVED INTO THE EARTH, THOSE SITUATONS, ACTIVITIES, BELIEFS AND BEHAVIORS THAT NEED TO, NOW DROP FROM THE PANORAMA OF MY LIFE SO THAT MY HIGHEST ENDEAVORS MAY CONSOLIDATE AND PROSPER, QUICKLY AND IN PEACE.

 urlLink LIBRA LUNAR CYCLE Sept. 25 - Oct. 24, 2003 Fall is officially here and the waning half of the yearly lunar cycle begins! After perfecting and organizing the resources you developed over the last six months, you're ready to share your creative and emotional harvest with others. This cycle emphasizes balance in all areas of your life. Adapt your health regimen to the seasonal change and be sure to include relaxation and meditation while allocating time for inward and outward activities. Existing relationships, social interactions and new partnerships come to center stage. First strengthen your relationship with yourself by asking Spirit to help you in releasing old hurts and resentments so your personal wholeness is supported. Collaboration and compromise provide win-win solutions to challenges confronting you, as long as you maintain your individual sense of balance. View yourself and the world with a loving heart, an open mind, and remember the underlying divine spark in others. Libra's ruler, Venus, emphasizes balance, beauty, grace, harmony, peace and love. These qualities are available right now and they begin within you . Interpretation by urlLink Moonsurfing.com

 urlLink SAGITTARIUS LUNAR CYCLE by Claudia @ www.moonsurfing.com Nov. 23 - Dec. 22 It's time to lighten up, laugh and celebrate life. Emotional stumbling blocks, outworn beliefs and areas calling for forgiveness are touched by powers of transformation as a total solar eclipse kicks off this lunar cycle. Winter officially begins as the solstice occurs on Dec. 21st underscoring the shift towards the light. Following the deep emotional elimination process kicked off by the Harmonic Concordance eclipse set-up, ask yourself what's true for you . Expand your viewpoint, cultivate a generous spirit and remember that your truth may not be everyone's truth. This cycle brings new opportunities and you're more aware of your place in the wider world now. Allow your life to tell a new story of possibilities, growth and fulfillment. Sagittarius is the sign of risk-taking and expanding horizons. Perhaps the relinquishment of the outworn yet dearly held beliefs that form the very foundations of our lives is the biggest risk of all. Whatever you experienced on or around November 22, 1984 as well as May 21,1993 and May 25, 1994 provide clues as to what's being re-energized by this eclipse. Along with the broader awareness being popped by this eclipse, you can come into a greater love of self by letting go of intolerance with yourself and your process. We're flexing brand new muscles of perception. There's much wisdom to be gained as we open to new ideas and possibilities that are shifting and connecting us at the deepest levels of our souls. Remember that old old phrase. "As you believe, so it is done unto you." It's time to reclaim your true power by reaffirming the truth of who you really are. Utilize the powerfully expansive energies of this Jupiter-ruled cycle and the ignition sparks provided by the New Moon Solar Eclipse set up to complete the surrender into your true identity as higher greater Self. Then walk that truth as you move toward your highest goals. All things are possible, if you believe.

 urlLink CAPRICORN LUNAR CYCLE by Claudia @ www.moonsurfing.com Dec. 23 - Jan 20 The Capricorn lunar cycle reminds you that discipline is liberation. As the light returns, prepare to enter a year of love, relationship, responsibility, and healing under the vibration of the number "6". Heed the call to consolidate your resources, set new limits and goals, and be more self-reliant. Mercury continues to move in retrograde motion till January 6th. Reflect on the lessons you've learned and get clear about where you need to set new limits and boundaries so you can accomplish your goals. Think out of the box for alternative solutions to areas calling for healing. As the month progresses, strike a balance between your desires for status and achievement in the outer world with time spent attending to family, feelings, and rest and renewal of body and soul. Utilize challenging situations to decide what needs to change. Then make a comprehensive plan and remember that patience, persistence and preparation are valuable resources. Last month's lunar energy encouraged you to set off with providential trust, hope, and a belief in good fortune. This month's energy requires that you align with your highest intentions and diligently prepare for your journey leaving nothing to chance .

 urlLink AQUARIUS LUNAR CYCLE by Kelley Rosano Jan 20 - Feb 19 The Sun Soars into Aquarius on January 20, 2004 and we have both the Sun and the New Moon in Aquarius the next day on January 21st. Now is the time to plant the seeds of what you desire to harvest in your life, work, and relationships. If we have been too serious and focused on work, perhaps we need to invite play back into our lives. Aquarian energy fires lightning truth, unexpected events, and upsets into the status quo to keep life from getting too rigid, constricting, or comfortable. Shaking and waking us up to experience new ways of living, being and loving. Aquarius invites us into fresh starts, new roads, boldness, genius, and group membership. Wild man Uranus is the ruling planet of Aquarius, he is outrageous, shocking, and erratic. Uranus loves to create chaos, and upset for that which is out dated, out grown or boorishly stuck. We will continue to experience a breakdown in paradigms, institutions, and organizations that are in truth obsolete. The light is oncoming and the Age of Aquarius is dawning. Uranus is in the spiritual sign Pisces for the next eight years, erasing boundaries between the spiritual and physical worlds, technology will boom with space age inventions. Your intuitve and psychic abilities will continue to grow. Pay attention to your dreams they are filled with life directing knowledge. Where do you need more freedom? On a planetary level, we are closing out the Piscean Age, and ending a 26,000-year cycle. We are now entering the Age of Aquarius and starting a new 26,000 year cycle. In truth, we live cycles within cycles, Pisces (last two thousand years) into Aquarius (next two thousand years.) The Age of Aquarius is the promised coming revolution in higher consciousness, an age of peace, truth, beauty, freedom, and love. Where competition is replaced with cooperation. Today is the time to prepare for higher consciousness by practicing Self-love and acceptance. The paramount mission, individually, may be for the development of a healthy foundation with Self and Spirit. 'Self' is the inner essence, soul identity and authenticity of each individual. When we are in alignment with Self, we base our choices upon one's true values and personal integrity, and enjoy a certain level of completion, joy, flow, and wholeness. As individuals come into a greater sense of Self and Spirit, they assist in raising the consciousness of the planet, as well as themselves. When our cup is full, we are available to assist others. This lifetime offers a grand opportunity to live in a new level of awareness, authenticity and happiness. We are the seedlings of the Aquarian Age, the forerunners plowing the way for greater souls of light to embody with us and take us to Greatest Party we have experienced in thousands of years, the Golden Age of Aquarius.

 urlLink Pisces Lunar Cycle by Ronni Lynn Feb 20 - March 20 This month the New Moon will be in the sign of Pisces. Pisces is a most mystical sign because it deals with the unconscious side of life and ourselves. Pisces' influence dissolves boundaries- those barriers that separate people and even nations from understanding each other. When boundaries are lifted we experience compassion, true understanding and a gentleness toward ourselves and each other. In order to accomplish this we must first deal with dissolving those boundaries within ourselves. By this I mean the differences between our external selves (how we act, dress, what we say we believe, etc) with our internal selves- who we truly are. When we are free to reflect to the outside who we really are then we will experience increased authenticity. With this authenticity we will begin to experience true connections with others. After all, if we are being a true reflection of ourselves, it will be our truth that others will be responding to. What a wonderful foundation for any relationship! When people who are being true to themselves interact, when their internal, and/or subconscious self is reflected outwardly, barriers between them will melt because they will have an understanding of each other. We all have much more in common than we realise or would like to admit. With this in mind, this is a good time to forgive others who have wronged us, ask forgiveness, or to forgive ourselves for past failures. A good way to find your inner truth is to quiet your mind, to meditate and just observe what comes up. Sometimes defense mechanisms that may have served us at the time of a traumatic experience persist and only serve to block our true energies from arising. You can sometimes tell that this is happening when you no longer allow yourself to feel vulnerable emotionally with others. This is a time when as we relax our minds and bodies we learn to release those tensions that block our emotional response with others. Pisces rules higher ideals, dreams and inspirations. Let your imagination and creativity expand during this time. We can wish to increase our spiritual awareness, our surrender to and faith in a higher power, or to find the correct spiritual path or teacher. At this time perhaps we can come to a realization that everything has a purpose, we are all connected, and that there is a perfect order to the universe. We are all part of the unfolding of that universe. This is a good month to wish for a decrease in feeling like a victim, or in feeling helpless or out of control. These are Pisces qualities that can go overboard. We need to curb a tendency for complete escapism , such as overuse of alcohal or drug abuse. While fantasy and inspiration can work to help us develop into more evolved beings, to expand our possibilities, we can also learn to distinguish fantasy from reality, truth from fiction . We must avoid the tendency to deceive ourselves and others with escapism. Pisces energy helps us dream, and offers us the opportunity to use that dream to make the world a better place for everyone. Neptune's energy can be harnessed to increase our creativity and creative expression in art, writing, dance, drama, or music. Dreams and inspiration are the first steps before action. The next sign, Aries will take the actions that follow the dreams that Pisces created. Pisces is the last sign of the Zodiac and with the dreams of Pisces feeding unconsciously into the energies of the first sign of the Zodiac, Aries, the cycle is again complete. The next new moon will be in Aries on March 20, 2004 at 5:42 PM. E.S.T. Come visit me then or a few days before for more New Moon reflections. With Blessings- Ronni

 urlLink ARIES LUNAR CYCLE by Claudia @ www.moonsurfing.com March 20 - April 18 In true Aries style, this is a highly active lunar month of bold energy wherein we move forward on our personal ideas and desires. The equinox occurs just hours before the New Moon. This emphasizes the cycle's underlying theme of balance and brings us into the First Quarter of the lunar year... a major turning point. Daylight savings time occurs on April 4th further underscoring the shift towards more and more light . Last month you grounded yourself by strengthening your spiritual connection, getting in touch with your dreams and reaching for a higher love. Remember to utilize the warrior energy of Aries in a most sacred way as you take action to manifest those qualities and dreams . A 3-week Mercury Retrograde period begins on April 6th bringing you an opportunity to take care of unfinished business as you prepare to move full tilt boogie in new directions. The combination of planetary energies reminds you to temper your ideas with patience, persistence and prudence as you pursue lasting goals and values. Don't energize negativity, but hone your intent and harness your will in the most positive ways as you blast off into the fresh start of a most promising spring.

 urlLink TAURUS LUNAR CYCLE by Dana Gerhardt @ urlLink http://www.mooncircles.com April 19 - May 20 This New Moon brings a partial Solar Eclipse. Eclipses bring a dramatic acceleration or sudden turn of events. What has recently changed for you? Eclipses force much needed changes to the surface. Their shakedown makes it easier to release worn-out behaviors, attitudes and relationships. Their turbulence impels us to grow . This New Moon is particularly potent. It is the second New Moon in Aries this year. Wasat the Aries New Moon last monthyour inner heroic nature roused to action? You may have found that what was stagnant in your life was becoming unbearable. Spring is about initiating action. Leaves suddenly fill out bare branches. Hyacinth and tulip bulbs shoot up from the ground. Where have you been springing forth? This is the second cycle of Artemisgoddess of the Moon and goddess of the hunt. She is summoned in each of us this season, expressed in our joyous independence, in our nurturing and courageous action. Perhaps the most important resolve you might make this New Moon is to shift your focus from what you dont wanton to what you do. Your future will be created by what you place your mind on now. If youre focused on irritations or lack, you will get more of the same. If you fill your heart with winning feelings, if you fill your mind with images of success , the momentum towards a brighter future will build. Negative energy only brings more negativity. The tulip bulb shooting up from the earth doesnt think "I dont want more winter." It is thinking "I want to be a luscious bloom." When you do likewise this cycle, a resplendent future will be speeding your way.

 urlLink GEMINI LUNAR CYCLE : By Rev. Pauline Southard This month's lunar cycle has an overall scattered feeling especially after May 21, 2004 when the Sun leaves Taurus for light and mutable Gemini. We feel we are jumping from one thing to another. Taking even just a few minutes to regroup will truly help this month. The New Moon of May 19, 2004 arrives at 12:51 AM EDT. This is the last gasp of the very fixed Taurus energy we experienced during the last lunar cycle. This New Moon lies at the very bottom of the chart, beckoning us to plant our spring gardens and attend to matters around the house. We could really use a little time out from work. A household crisis requires that we scramble to manipulate our schedules. Our committed love relationships are smooth sailing now. Sexual intimacy provides us with a wonderful nurturing connection that lasts long after the physical act is completed. Truly a meeting of souls. This part of the lunar cycle provides us with great potential to plan our summer vacations and those of the children we are responsible for. A sibling conveys some good advice concerning matters of the heart and/or financial affairs. The First Quarter Moon of May 27, 2004 at 3:56 AM EDT starts its work while we are still dreaming. The Sun has now entered Gemini. Gemini energy in its pure form is all about communication, inquisitiveness and love of socializing. At its best, its clever wit can cause us to look at matters from a different perspective while laughing. When this energy is used negatively, it can denote lack of focus, the facile & easy answer over the deeper and more thoughtful approach and a disregard for others feelings. Expect some unexpected expenses that may impede our goals in the short term. However, towards the end of the First Quarter Moon, we find that our partners are particularly helpful in very practical and substantial ways. The Full Moon of June 3, 2004 at 12:19 AM EDT makes everything appear larger than life as the Sun and Moon depart from a square to Jupiter. Relax! Although we feel that we must do it all perfectly, perhaps an adequate job will suffice without totally stressing us out. Any recent tensions in our relationships ease now. It could be fun to see a play or an unusual foreign movie now. The Third Quarter Moon of June 9, 2004 at 4:02 PM EDT heightens our emotional sensitivity. We are particularly adept at tuning into our lovers and childrens feelings. A great time to go to the beach and paint! Or we could single mindedly pursue projects that have seemed to have had a missing element until now and complete them. It is a great week for a trip with a lover- either an inner or literal journey would be wonderful now.

 Lunar Energy: Full Moon Rituals The moon has always played an important part in ancient spiritual practices. Since the beginning of time, people have recognized lunar power, which is where the term, "lunacy" comes from. Even today there is much speculation as to the affects of the moon's phases, particularly the full moon, on our moods and behavior. The belief behind full moon rituals is to harness lunar power to the benefit of oneself and others. Ceremonies performed at this phase of the moon are meant for empowerment, as well to manifest positive changes. The full moon appears once every 29.53 days, therefore rituals can be performed almost every month, sometimes even twice a month. And, you need not be outside or even see the full moon to reap its powerful benefits. There are many full moon rituals, some more complex than others, involving magical tools and enhancements. Yet, many are quite simple, including a moon bask which is just that, basking in the full moonlight and meditating. You can do the ritual standing, sitting, or laying on the ground, or even indoors if it's more practical. Just stand by a large window, open if possible, and meditate on that which would enhance your life. One well-known ceremony is "Drawing Down the Moon," to connect with the power and wisdom of the full moon. In Wicca traditions, a priestess performs the ceremony in order for her to become the living embodiment of the mood goddess. There are also rituals where all participants "draw down the moon" to evoke the deity of the moon within themselves. For a healing ritual, Selena Fox, of the Circle Craft tradition, offers this Moon Mirror Healing. Place a silvered mirror face up on an altar or sacred place so that the light of the full moon shines upon it. Place a symbol to represent the one seeking healing in the center of the mirror. The symbol may be a photo, piece of jewelry, lock of hair, or simply a name on a card. Use the symbol on the mirror in the moonlight as a focal point as you imagine that the one needing healing is becoming well and then healthy. After the ritual, deliver the symbol to the subject of the healing rite as an additional way of transmitting healing. Cleanse the mirror you used by washing it with a mugwort solution or passing it through the smoke from mugwort or another incense. In this way, the mirror will be ready for use for another healing. Whether you perform simple or elaborate full moon rituals, or just enjoy the beauty of the full moon, you're participating in a long tradition of showing appreciation for a powerful source of illumination.

 From: KnowledgeNews info@knowledgenews.net > Prepare to be mooned--blue mooned. This Saturday, July 31, a "blue moon" rises. Of course, you probably won't see even a hint of blue color, just your average full moon. So what gives? What's so blue about a moon that isn't? Heck, astronomers even say that blue moons aren't rare. And folklorists say they're not what everyone thinks they are. As any budding astronomer can tell you, a "blue moon" is the second full moon in a calendar month. It isn't really blue. It's just a name. But why, of all things, do we call a white moon "blue" Actually, there are truly blue moons. In 1883, an Indonesian volcano erupted with the force of a 100-megaton nuclear bomb. With a roar heard nearly 400 miles (over 600 kilometers) away, Mount Krakatoa belched a column of volcanic gas and ash into the atmosphere. That night, the moon rose blue over Indonesia. Particles from Krakatoa's ash, not more than a micron wide, made it happen. These micron-wide particles were exactly the right size to scatter red light, while allowing other colors, such as blue, to pass. The result: a blue sphere hanging in the sky. Different sized particles filtered other colors and caused different effects. In fact, for several years after the eruption, there were reports fro mall over the globe of red moons, green moons, and, yes, even more blue moons.. What's more, some of the sunsets following the eruption were such a blazing red that people actually called on firemen to drown the optical illusion.. The eruptions of Mount St. Helens and Mount Pinatubo produced the same anomaly.&nbsp; So have forest fires.&nbsp;Still, none of this explains why we call the second full moon in a month a blue moon. The phrase is old, even if the modern meaning is not. Before Shakespeare penned a word of Hamlet, the English knew little couplets like: If they say the moon is blewe, we must believe that it is true.

 urlLink CANCER LUNAR CYCLE by Maya del Mar&nbsp; July 17 -&nbsp;August 16 During the passage of the sun through Cancer we are extraordinarily open to our inner selves , to our own depths, to our own connections with the universe. The vulnerability of this state increases our need for security, and we find ourselves attending to those aspects of our lives which center in our own hearthour inner child, our family, our domestic lives, our homes, our businessesthose things which relate to creating a stable base, those situations in which we find safety and comfort . The Sun enters the sign of Cancer at Summer Solstice. This is the longest day of the year in the northern hemisphere. At that moment the days begin to shorten, the night force takes over, and we begin our six-month journey of gradually embracing the darkness, which climaxes at winter solstice on December 21. Like the night to which she introduces us, the forces of Cancer are mysterious . They are ruled by the Moon, the Goddess of the Night, who brings her waxing and waning lanterns to guide us through the dark, through the murky unconscious, through the watery depths of feeling. In Gemini we made connections with every passing event, as we restlessly kept ourselves in motion, learning about the world, exploring. Now in Cancer it is time to center ourselves, to turn within and learn who we are and what we need, to nurture our inner child and create a safe home for it. The darkness of the subconscious is our real staging ground for life, and we must develop lines of support to anchor ourselves to its vastness, while at the same time maintaining fluid passageways for growth, for change, and for movement to new levels. In Aries, we brought the seed of spirit to earth, in Taurus we multiplied the seeds, in Gemini the air swept them up to disperse them, and now in Cancer each seed will find its proper spot in which to put down strong roots . It is most appropriate that we plant our gardens by the moon, which rules Cancer. The moon fluctuates within its monthly cycle, and also is connected with the daily fluctuations of tidal waters throughout the world. Underlying this fluctuation, which may seem capricious if we dont pay attention to lifes rhythms, there are regular cycles and predictability. The energy of Cancer, similarly, is a fluctuating movementgoing within to deep sources and then moving out to express those depths in the world, ever shifting as do the ocean currents. But like the moon Cancer has its inner predictability, and is accountable to its own rhythms. Cancer rules containers of all kinds, including the womb, where young life is nourished, and the home, where families are nourished. It rules gestation, that vulnerable time when an embryo is being formed deep within layers of protection. Cancer is associated with bodies of fluid, such as lakes and amniotic sacs. It knows. It knows that water, which symbolizes emotions in astrology, is the essential matrix of life, and that feelings are tender and vulnerable and must be protected, just as the growing fetus must be protected. It knows intimately about growth, because it carries the growth process within itself. And growth, too, must be protected and attended to so that the fledgling is strong and healthy. &nbsp; The Sabian Symbol for 26 Cancer is: "GUESTS ARE READING IN THE LIBRARY OF A LUXURIOUS HOME. The transference of social privilege to the level of intellectual enjoyment. We see the concretization of cultural excellence and wealth at the level at which individuals can exercise their developmental capacities in comfort. The process is individualized because the library belongs to a private residence, the luxury of which implies an individuals concentration upon the acquisition of wealth. Maintaining CLASS STANDARDS OF INFORMATION. What is at stake here is the need to conform to the requirements of ones social status." &nbsp; &nbsp;

 The Dining Room Dining tables should not be placed in front of the main door. A dining table that faces the toilet receives too much Yin and can negatively affect health. A dining table should not be used as partition between two rooms. If a dining table faces the kitchen or is in the kitchen area, it receives too much Yang and the diners might develop a bad temperament. Air conditioning, central heating and fans are best kept on the left side of the dining room.

 "Bathrooms, hallway corners, laundry rooms, even open closets work well.

One important piece of advice: Once you've decided on a spot, don't change it unless you are confident that boxes in other locations are already begin used frequently. Finally, keep track of which box is most popular -- you might be better off offering two in that spot, and foregoing the basement box that is visited only rarely."

 Do not use a beater bar vac by all means. Even if the bristles are soft, it only takes one paperclip to get caught up in it to really mess up your floors. As far as wheels go, best not to do that either. No, I don't expect the appliance to float above the floor mysteriously, but a damaged plastic or a metal wheel can cause considerable damage in a short amount of time. Expect higher maintainence on wood floors than carpet and expect to clean it more often. Carpet acts as a filter and absorbs dust and dirt. Wood can't. I have dark stained red oak (finish is tung oil) wood flooring thru out my home and have always used my dust mop (sometimes lightly mist dust mop with water) with my dustpan, then mop with warm water which mop is wrung out till almost dry/damp and then mop my floor. My mother lives in her old family home which was built in the 1870s and she always used a dust mop and never used a vacuum and her floors are beautiful! Another good workable and cheap solution.... a small shop vac. I bought the 2Gal/2.0 HP sized one at Lowes for $29 and it sucks up everything (including the drapes). Also, for quick cleanups of pet hair balls and the like, I use the dry swifter mop.

 urlLink Whirlpool Resource Saver Washer The innovative Whirlpool Resource Saver® Washer saves up to 47% of the water needed to clean clothes, while using only 56% of the energy*. This could save you up to $100 per year. urlLink Senseon Dryer The Senseon™ Drying System uses a thermistor and moisture-sensing strips, coupled with computer controls, to continually measure temperature and moisture to determine the load type and rate of drying. When clothes reach "damp dry", the dryer already "knows" how long it will take them to be completely dry because it knows the types of clothes being dried (whether they're heavy or light) and how long it took them to reach the damp dry point. This accuracy helps prevent overdrying and shortens cycle times by up to 20 minutes.

 urlLink By Brian Ogan, Designer : Accentuate tall, open spaces. Don't clutter walls with small pieces of art. A favorite tactic is to fill a large pot with river rocks and arrange tall bamboo stems that fan out and reach to the ceiling. An interesting sculpture also works well. Warm up a wall. Paint a single wall in a soft sage or a warm wine. This adds a welcome touch of color and warmth. Get smart about storage. Carefully plan every piece of furniture to control clutter. Open shelving is also a good option, because it keeps the wall exposed and maintains the open feeling of the room. Use lighting as art. Simple, modern wall sconces are attractive and provide soft illumination without using up valuable surface space. Use area rugs as anchors. Area rugs help break down a loft space into separate living areas, without sacrificing overall openness. They also warm up bare floors and help reduce echoes. Maintain open space. Arrange furniture so it does not block views to windows and doors. Modern benches, stools, and ottomans are great because their simple, clean lines don't obstruct views and minimize the feel of a small room. Coffee tables and lamp tables with clear glass will give you extra surface space but won't make a room look cluttered. Avoid overstuffed sofas and chairs.

 urlLink Storage Ideas : A large garbage can may be covered with a round plywood top, draped with a round skirt and pronto -- storage for a variety of household items. Ladders or step stools topped with shelves or a flush door table top provide storage space, display area, desk or work surface. Adding legs and cushions to a door or other flat board makes a bench, bed or sofa. Casters may also be used in place of legs. Without the cushions, you have a movable plant stand to display collections, books or records. Bricks (stone, concrete or glass) and boards can be used for bookshelves, shoe shelves, end tables, coffee tables and plant stands. Use five-sided cubes for a number of things. A basic 15-inch cube made of plywood can be a coffee table, an end table, a storage unit, a cushioned seat or almost anything you like, and in any color because it is easy to paint or enamel. Brightly painted cubes lined up along the floor of a child's room will hold books and toys. Stack them up in your family room to hold books, small TV, stereo equipment, and decorative objects. Stacked units can be used for a two-faced room divider with open sides facing either way. Storage containers can be made from boxes, tin cans, baskets or other recycled containers. These can be painted, covered with self-adhesive paper, wallpaper, fabric. Sturdy old tables, chests or storage units can look attractive through refinishing, painting, application of self-adhesive paper or upholstering with easily-cared-for fabric. New or used filing cabinets may be used in a variety of ways to provide an abundance of storage. Cover them with fabric, wallpaper or a coat of paint to make them more attractive.

 urlLink Energy Efficiency

 urlLink Energy Efficiency & Environmental News: Lighting : There are many cost effective strategies and technologies available for slashing lighting energy use. As Barney Capehart says; 'If everyone went to the store today and bought high efficiency products or devices for their homes, offices, and factories, Florida could cut its energy use in half.' Daylighting through skylights and windows can be economical. Only indirect light generates less heat than electric lamps. Skylights can be modified with white paint, lenses, or reflective film to reduce solar heat gain. Incandescent lamps are the most widely used, and the least efficient. Low pressure sodium vapor lamps, one of the most efficient light sources, uses 9 times less electricity for the same brightness, produce less heat, and lasts 18 times as long as incandescent lamps. Sodium lamp light, however, does not render color naturally.

 urlLink Clothes Dryers : The most efficient method of drying clothes is to employ the solar powered clothes dryer; that is, a line strung up between two posts or trees. When dried in the sun, clothes smell fresher and look cleaner. If a mechanical clothes dryer is selected, pay attention to the yellow efficiency labels. &nbsp; In general, appliances using heat such as water heaters, space heaters, clothes dryers and cooking appliances are more efficient if they use natural gas rather than electricity or liquid petroleum gas. Natural gas normally provides: a wider variety of temperature settings, instantaneous on/off heat, is more environmentally benign, and is more economical - the energy cost is usually half the cost of electricity.

 urlLink Washing Machines : Washing machines should have at least three water level selections - high, medium and low; and provide for washing in cold, warm and hot water and rinsing in cold water. Other features should be selected on the type of washing that is expected. Some of these include delicate and permanent press cycles. In general, washing in warm water is the most energy efficient method; cold water washing usually requires a longer cycle or more detergent to wash the clothes to the same degree of cleanliness. Using the proper water level to fit the load is probably the most important energy saving consideration when operating a washing machine."

 urlLink EU, NATO Throw New Lifeline to Macedonia Talks Macedonian President Boris Trajkovski said talks between leaders of mainstream Macedonian and ethnic Albanian political parties, mediated by special EU and U.S. peace envoys, would resume in Tetovo. But he gave no exact timeframe for resuming dialogue in the city, where fierce three-day battles this week between the NLA and government troops ruined a 15-day truce. One civilian was shot dead there on Thursday, local police said, but no details were immediately available. ``Tetovo is a kind of melting pot for Macedonia. We are going to Tetovo to defend all those achievements,'' Trajkovski said in a reference to the previous round of talks, which had made some progress but stalled over whether Albanian should become an official language in some parts of Macedonia. The West has taken a lead role in trying to prevent a five-month-old ethnic Albanian rebellion in Macedonia from becoming another Balkan war.

 urlLink September 11, 2001 September 11 2001, the tone of America changed. The news was relentless and none of it was good. Words conveyed the events but words failed to tell the emotional tale. As NPR covered the events, it was music that gave listeners time to reflect, to digest the images and the impact. So many letters came to NPR telling us how comforted they were by the music. In the wake of all that happened I was surprised anyone would take the time to mention the music; it seemed so trivial compared to the weeks' events. I was reminded again why composers score and why players perform. Together they create a magnificence that goes beyond the spoken word, both touching the ear and reaching the soul. I've put together some of that music here, in part to answer some of those letters wondering what we played (precise record keeping was impossible), and also to create an aural snapshot that in some small way tries to capture the tone of a nation shaken and changed. I hope you find comfort in this edition of All Songs Considered. Bob Boilen Director All Things Considered

 urlLink Researchers have begun to explain how emotional reactions and logical thinking interact in moral decision-making Princeton University researchers reported in the Sept. 14 issue of Science that they used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to analyze brain activity in people who were asked to ponder a range of moral dilemmas. The results suggest that, while people regularly reach the same conclusions when faced with uncomfortable moral choices, their answers often do not grow out of the reasoned application of general moral principles. Instead, they draw on emotional reactions, particularly for certain kinds of moral dilemmas. The results also show how tools of neuroscience are beginning to reveal the biological underpinnings of the subtlest elements of human behavior, said Joshua Greene, a graduate student in philosophy who conducted the study in collaboration with scientists in the psychology department and the Center for the Study of Brain, Mind and Behavior. "We think of moral judgments as so ethereal," said Greene. "Now we're in a position to start looking at brain anatomy and understanding how neural mechanisms produce patterns in our behavior." The study focused on a classic set of problems that have fascinated moral philosophers for years because of the difficulty in identifying moral principles that agree with the way people react. One dilemma, known as the trolley problem, involves a runaway train t

We must use such punishment to keep your evil away from Muslims, Muslim children and women. American history does not distinguish between civilians and military, and not even women and children.

 urlLink World Reacts with Revulsion to U.S. Attacks LONDON (Reuters) - World leaders reacted with revulsion on Tuesday to what President George Bush called an ``apparent terrorist attack'' by aircraft that crashed into the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon (news - web sites) in Washington. But amid the global horror, Palestinian gunmen at refugee camps in Lebanon fired into the air on Tuesday to celebrate the news of the attacks. ``America and Israel are one. This is the result of American policy,'' one Palestinian gunman said. No one had yet claimed responsibility. Lebanese, Palestinian and Israeli leaders joined Europe, Mexico and other countries in condemning the devastating attacks that caused as yet unknown casualties. Western European leaders broke off their normal business to return to their capitals for crisis meetings and expressed solidarity with the United States. From every corner of Europe, leaders condemned attacks they branded horrendous, abominable, disgusting, monstrous and abhorrent. The European Union (news - web sites) said it was the worst attack on America since Pearl Harbor 60 years ago and was ``one of those few days in life that one can actually say will change everything.'' ``This is an act of war by madmen,'' EU External Relations Commissioner Chris Patten told Reuters.

 INTERNET ACCESS THROUGH POWER LINES? THEY'RE WORKING ON IT Might you one day connect to the Internet via the nearest wall socket? It's possible -- technically, anyway. The mission of the newly minted joint-venture company Linecom Inc. will be to develop and deploy "power line communication" systems in Japan, which would push Internet access onto existing power lines. Formed among Kansai Electric Power Co. and Matsushita Electric Works Ltd. in Japan and Israel's Itran Communications, the new company will capitalize on Kansai Electric's knowledge of power-distribution systems, Itran's power line communication (PLC) technology and Matsushita's expertise in system integration and product design to develop a complete, start-to-finish solution, from modems to power-line networking equipment. Itran has developed a special modem that links to the Internet via household electrical outlets. Power company Kansai Electric intends to launch the service once the the Japanese government deregulates the use of high-frequency bands for PLC, which is expected to happen early next year.

 urlLink Coincidences: Remarkable or Random? (Skeptical Inquirer) "You don't believe in telepathy?" My friend, a sober professional, looked askance. "Do you?" I replied. "Of course. So many times I've been out for the evening and suddenly became worried about the kids. Upon calling home, I've learned one is sick, hurt himself, or having nightmares. How else can you explain it?" Such episodes have happened to us all and it's common to hear the words, "It couldn't be just coincidence." Today the explanation many people reach for involves mental telepathy or psychic stirrings. But should we leap so readily into the arms of a mystic realm? Could such events result from coincidence after all? There are two features of coincidences not well known among the public. First, we tend to overlook the powerful reinforcement of coincidences, both waking and in dreams, in our memories. Non-coincidental events do not register in our memories with nearly the same intensity. Second, we fail to realize the extent to which highly improbable events occur daily to everyone. It is not possible to estimate all the probabilities of many paired events that occur in our daily lives. We often tend to assign coincidences a lesser probability than they deserve. However, it is possible to calculate the probabilities of some seemingly improbable events with precision. These examples provide clues as to how our expectations fail to agree with reality.

 urlLink The journalism and films of John Pilger On 2 August 1990 the Iraqi army invaded its southern neighbour, Kuwait. Four days later the United Nations responded by imposing a complete trade embargo on Iraq. In the ten years since Iraq has continued to be the subject of sanctions that affect almost every aspect of life for the average woman, man and child. With imports of food and medicine severely restricted, malnutrition and disease is now endemic in what was once one of the healthiest countries in the world. A 1999 Unicef report calculated that more than half a million children had died as a direct result of sanctions. On average 200 hundred Iraqi children are dying every day. In September 1998, Denis Halliday head of the UN humanitarian programme in Iraq resigned claiming he could no longer administer 'an immoral and illegal' policy. His successor, Hans von Sponeck also later resigned, along with the head of the World Food Programme. Meanwhile US and UK politicians insist that the sanctions regime is necessary to contain the threat of Saddam Hussein. When asked on US television whether the death of 500,000 Iraqi children as a result of sanctions was justified Madelaine Albright replied 'I think this is a very hard choice, but the price - we think the price is worth it.'

 Bees invade the internet By BBC News Online internet reporter Mark Ward Soon software that acts like bees or ants could be running the internet. Researchers at the University of California are claiming that we need radically new ways to run the net as more and more people and devices go online. Michael Wang and Tatsuya Suda say that existing methods of keeping the net going will not be able to cope when billions of people, mobile phones, hand-held computers and household appliances are routinely using it to communicate. What is needed, claim the pair, are self-organising systems inspired by biology. The researchers are experimenting with discrete programs called agents that have been modelled on bees and ants. Individually these insects are very stupid but put enough of them together and they do a very efficient job of running and maintaining huge structures like nests and hives without any central control. By contrast, current internet management systems tend to be very centralised and directed by people. Mr Wang says that this set-up will be unable to cope when everything from our PCs to refrigerators is online. No-one will have the time or inclination to ensure that all the devices are doing what they should, he says. "The devices should just self-manage or self-organise and just do the right things," says Mr Wang. Many popular web events already struggle to serve all the people that want to see them. When Sir Paul McCartney did a webcast of a performance at the Cavern in Liverpool, servers were overwhelmed by the numbers wanting to watch the show. Under the scheme proposed by the US researchers, as a website increases in popularity the content on it, be it a video or audio stream, will be copied and ferried to websites closer to the people trying to see or hear it. Mr Wang says that the user requests are like food and the small software programs that ferry the content across are like bees blazing a trail to the source. The bees "die" when users stop requesting clips. Belgian scientist Marco Dorigo is looking at using small, stupid, ant-like programs to improve the running of the internet. But he is proposing to let the ants run the infrastructure of the net rather than just serve up video clips to people. The bee-like software entities are programmed with a few simple rules that define what they do. This rule-based approach is also being used to recreate huge battle scenes for the Lord of the Rings movie currently being filmed in New Zealand. The troops in the battle scenes are computer-generated orcs, elves, humans and dwarves that have been programmed with a few rules that define their fighting style, who their enemies are and what to do when a foe has been killed. Battle commences when the troops are unleashed on each other and computer cameras record the flow of action.

 Iceland launches energy revolution By environment correspondent Tim Hirsch In 1874 the science fiction writer Jules Verne envisaged a world in which water would replace coal as the fuel of the future.

Iceland has already gone further than any other country in exploiting its abundant sources of renewable energy. Virtually all of its electricity and heating comes from hydroelectric power and the geo-thermal water reserves tapped from the hot rock layers lying just beneath the surface of this extraordinary island.

 urlLink Are We Not Geeks? Tolkien and his keen readers are often criticised for being stuck in eternal adolescence, and labelled as geeks. I'd like to take a closer look at these labels. Consider how many useful and pragmatic people read therapy and self-help books because they're want to fulfil their potential as balanced, self-aware individuals. Many of these books talk about the notion of nurturing one's 'inner child.' The inner child is that part of us that feels enthusiasm and joy most strongly, and which responds most truthfully to the world. Well and good; evidently the "inner child" is regarded as good and precious. But what can we say about the inner adolescent? Why aren't we nurturing the inner adolescent? I think you can hardly say the phrase 'teenager' these days without immediately thinking of somebody rebellious and confused, or remembering one's own years of irritable awkwardness. We haven't got a lot good to say about teenagers, and yet we should. The author Philip Pullman wrote something very interesting in response to a question about why he preferred to write for and about teenagers. At that age, he said, children are becoming aware of the world in a new way, and they have time to ask the big questions: What is the meaning of life, why are we here, what is our purpose? Later on we get busy, we get cynical, and we are in danger of forgetting we ever cared. I'd agree with that. I'd go further and say that for many teenagers, those years are a time of great stress partly because it is an age of idealism and yet they are just beginning to learn about the world's tired habits - its petty hypocrisies, callous persecutions, deadly evasions of responsibility, casual negligence towards justice, and the ignoble worms of greed that gnaw away at the heart of every great enterprise... Teenagers rage against the wrongness of the world because they see it more freshly and it wounds them more keenly. As one becomes older, wiser, and tireder, it seems less hassle to take the easy course, to act circumspectly, to be politic more often than honest. I think teenagers rage against growing into that state, and the best of them still believe that they will change the world by virtue of naming and confronting its evils. I'd like to throw in one of the ultimate Romantic poems I've ever come across. It's by an Argentinean poet, and to me it sums up that idealism of adolescence which rejects the deceitful world with one grand gesture: For Afterwards I would like to die when the day is ending on the open sea and looking at the sky; where the agony of death may seem but sleep and the soul may seem a bird which mounts in flight. And in the final instants I would hear, already with the sky and sea alone, no other sobbing prayers or sobbing voices than those of waves in their majestic fall. To die when life is sadly hauling back its golden nets from out the tide's deep green and be like yonder sun that dies down slowly: some very shining thing that's lost from sight. To die, and young, before unfaithful time destroys the delicate and gentle crown; whilst life still tells us: I am yours although we know so well it will betray us. Manuel Gutierrez (1859 - 1895) (Translation: Gordon Challis) Yes, a modern person might find this sentimental and grandiose. It is utterly fantastical in its all-or-nothing approach to life. It offers no gritty pragmatic solutions to the problem of living in a less-than-perfect world. It may be adolescent in its grand gesture of utterly rejecting the world in all its complex awfulness. But would the world be a richer place if everything as great, beautiful and futile as this poem, were banished from our consciousness? I could not bear the loss. For this is the inner teenager that Tolkien and many other fantasy books appeal to. They are books that are about honour and justice and the recognition of absolute good and evil; they are books about daring and courage and ultimate sacrifices and grand gestures against hopeless odds. Nobody has lost that inner teenager who has flung aside their life and decided to change a political system or overturn a scientific belief; or who has shrugged off convention in order to embark on a great love affair across continents and oceans. Sadly, it is the inner teenager we appeal to when we send young men off to die in wars; but it is my belief that all those who have risked their lives to stand up against oppression and injustice called on their inner teenager too. Because when teenagers look at the status quo they see wrongs, and they name them truthfully, whether society wants to hear or not. The whole question of geekdom has interested me for a while too. Other people are involved in writing more about this, but I'll take the liberty of pre-empting their more extensive study with a few thoughts. Firstly, what is a geek? Articles like Julian Dibbell's 'Lord of the Geeks' article on Village Voice seem to deride geeks as a minority of outsiders while simultaneously fearing that they're some vast inchoate conspiracy which controls the technology underpinning our modern world. They're losers, he thinks, but by some unfair twist of fate and genetics, they get to spend their lives doing cool things with art, science, technology, popular culture and the media. (And I might add that some of them get shockingly rich doing it too, and have to travel round the world for their pains.) My own definition of geeks is this: A geek cares about a subject or system so much that they're willing to learn how to master it, whether anyone else cares about it or not. The link between geeks and teenagers exists because before that age, if a child is fascinated by something, we just think they're absorbed in play. It's only when they hit their teen years that we notice geeks because there's some expectation that they should be out partying and socialising. Instead they sometimes - or often - put aside their interest in other people because they'd rather be problemsolving on their computer, or memorising the entire history of the Plantagenets, or thinking up stories about an imaginary world, or practicing scales for three hours on the violin. Sometimes they're fixed on a goal known only to themselves, sometimes they've found a close-knit gang with similar interests, but in any case they'll follow their own instincts or interests, no matter what anybody else thinks. The larger group of non-geeks is always going to be nervous of somebody who resists the easiest form of social control, which is shame. In their eyes, you should be able to laugh at somebody and tease them for being different, and that should be sufficient to make them toe the line and make a bit more of an effort to appear similar to everyone else. Geeks resist that because, well, it'd mean giving up the things that matter more than conformity. There's always been geeks. Mozart? What a nerd! He had to be a geek. Who illuminated medieval manuscripts? Who preserved literacy during the difficult, violent centuries of the Dark Ages? Geek monks who remembered what civilisation was! Who were Pythagoras and Socrates and Archimedes? Total geeks every one of them, with their heads in the clouds. And so I ask, if anything worth doing is to be done: Are we not geeks? written by tehanu@theonering.net

 Japan Scientists Grow Artificial Eyeball -Kyodo TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese scientists have succeeded in growing artificial eyeballs for the first time in the world, Kyodo news agency said Saturday. A group of researchers led by Makoto Asashima, biology professor at Tokyo University, succeeded in growing eyeballs in tadpoles using cells taken from frog embryos, Kyodo said. ``Since the basics of body-making is common to that of human beings, I think this might help enable people to regain vision in the future,'' Asashima was quoted as saying. The group, after soaking undifferentiated cells from the embryo of a Platanna frog in a special medium, transplanted the eyeball into a tadpole whose left eye had been removed before it was hatched, Kyodo said. A week after the transplant, Asashima's group confirmed the tadpole's eyeball was connected to the optic nerves and there were no rejection symptoms, it said. http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20020105/sc/japan_eyeball_dc_1.html

Instead of then attacking the defenceless calf, the lioness adopted the baby, protecting it from other predators, including a leopard. Extraordinarily, the lioness still allowed the mother oryx occasionally to come and feed her calf before chasing her away

 urlLink Turkish women get equal rights The new year sees the start of a quiet revolution in Turkish society, when centuries of legally enshrined inequality between the sexes are brought to an end. From 1 January, Turkish men are no longer regarded by law as the head of the family. These latest measures included in sweeping reforms to the country's civil code are described by Turkey's Justice Minister, Hikmet Sami Turk, as the result of no less than 50 years' hard work. Women are now legally allowed to take a job without first seeking their spouse's permission, and their husbands no longer have the right to decide unilaterally where a couple will live. But by far the most significant element of the new legislation is the provision that married women are entitled to an equal share of joint assets in the event of divorce.

 urlLink ENFP under stress ENFP ENFPs have a tendency to overextend themselves in both their physical and emotional commitments. Their proclivity to procrastinate and to overlook details complicates their circumstances. ENFPs often move on to new ventures without completing those they have already started. Their charming personalities can show signs of irritability and over-sensitivity when their desires to please different people come into conflict. During times of stress, ENFPs feel alienated. They then engage in deceptions that serve to obscure what is occurring within themselves. The ENFP finds symbolic meanings behind the immediate circumstances. These meanings are construed as foreboding problems when ENFPs are under stress. Having a pervasive feeling of losing control over their own independent identities, ENFPs will feel virtually split apart by intruding circumstances. They will be "besides themselves" and "just not all there" as if something, or someone, has taken away the essence of who they are. Not feeling like themselves, the ENFP will become subject to their own feelings of shame for being a phony, a fake or an impostor. If stress continues to grow, they may attribute malevolent schemes to others in order to explain away their fears.

 urlLink Conflicting relations These are relations of constantly developing conflict. Conflicting relations have the worst compatibility between partners among all other relations. However, it does not seem to be so obvious, especially in the earlier stages of development. Conflicting partners appear rather attractive, interesting and with impressive abilities. Both partners are usually convinced that they can coexist and collaborate quite peacefully, but soon it becomes apparent that something is always going wrong, making their relationship problematic. Both partners may mistakenly think that the cause of these problems is minor and easily fixed and that all they need to do is to show a little bit more effort in understanding their partner. Unfortunately, these attempts to continue pushing their relationship any further will soon provoke an open conflict between the partners. When conflict starts, partners hit each other with arguments exactly in the direction where they can cause maximum pain. In return, the other partner may counterattack even more aggressively. With every conflict these relations become worse and worse. Although Conflicting partners show confidence where their partner is unconfident, they are unable to protect and take care of each other's weak points. This regularly brings disagreement and disappointment into these relations. When after several fruitless attempts to establish a stable relationship the partners give up and break the relationship, they feel saved and released. ISTj - ENFp

 urlLink Abercrombie & Fitch Asian caricatures T-shirts cause outrage (04-18) 09:42 PDT SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A new line of T-shirts depicting stereotypes of Asians has triggered an e-mail and phone campaign to boycott clothier Abercrombie & Fitch, which caters to the young, active set. One of the Ohio-based company's t-shirts reads "Wong Brothers Laundry Service -- Two Wongs Can Make It White" and shows two smiling men with slanted eyes wearing conical hats. Abercrombie said the shirts were supposed to be funny and cater to Asian customers. "We personally thought Asians would love this T-shirt," said Hampton Carney, a spokesman for the company. The T-shirts prompted a late-night meeting of Stanford University students Wednesday. The Asian American Students' Association encouraged calls to the company, and said Abercrombie & Fitch should apologize. "It's really misleading as to what Asian people are," said Michael Chang, vice chairman of the student organization. "The stereotypes they depict are more than a century old. You're seeing laundry service. You're seeing basically an entire religion and philosophy being trivialized." One shirt features a smiling Buddha figure with the slogan "Abercrombie and Fitch Buddha Bash -- Get Your Buddha on the Floor". Another shirt reads "Wok-N-Bowl -- Let the Good Times Roll -- Chinese Food & Bowling." Abercrombie apologised for the offense caused after the first protest broke out.

 urlLink SELF-HELP: Divorce DIVORCE: A Crisis, Any Way You Look At It If you are currently facing the realities of a divorce--either as a partner in a failing marriage, or as a child of parents whose marriage is ending--you are not alone. More than two and one-half million adults divorce every year; and more than a million children become children of divorced parents. Divorce is a CRISIS of major proportions, second only to death of a spouse or parent in terms of the emotional trauma, stress, and upheaval it causes. According to the dictionary, a "crisis" is a situation whose outcome decides whether possible bad consequences will occur. That is, a crisis is not automatically a disaster; it is only potentially so. In fact, the Chinese word for crisis is composed of symbols meaning DANGER and OPPORTUNITY. The process of coming to terms with a divorce (or any other crisis/loss, for that matter) necessarily involves consideration of both its dangers and opportunities. The dangers associated with divorce can be summed up in one word--LOSS. Whether you are a partner willingly seeking divorce or a partner who is resisting the action or a child who has no choice in the matter, you will incur serious losses as a result of divorce. Recognizing the extent of the losses--economic losses, loss of your home, loss of previous social life, loss of daily contact with children, loss of household help (i.e., your partner) , loss of in-laws, loss of routine, to name a few--is the first step toward identifying, understanding, and resolving the wide range of intense feelings that accompany such losses. It is important to realize that the above losses result in emotional trauma. Reactions in the early stages of loss/trauma can include numbness, shock, and denial as well as helplessness, despair, and terror. In these early stages, it is helpful to acknowledge the losses and the tremendous pain associated with them; to remind yourself that you will survive; to recognize the universality of loss reactions and that you are not alone; to remind yourself that it is normal and healthy to experience pain with loss and encourage yourself to sit with the pain; to take care of yourself by getting rest, allowing friends to give you support, building in structure to counter the sense of being out of control, giving yourself room for mistakes, seeking out the comfort of others who have experienced similar losses; and seeking help and guidance immediately, if you think you need it. A later stage in the loss process involves aspects of mourning. Feelings most often associated with this stage are anger and depression. Again, it is important to understand and accept these feelings as legitimate. It is also important to give yourself time to experience and work through these feelings, rather than allowing yourself to run away through compulsive activities, new relationships, or acting out the feelings through self-defeating behaviors or activities. The dangers of divorce for children are similar to those listed above but more intense. For children, a divorce means the loss of their family as they have known it. This loss most often stimulates overwhelming fears of abandonment, threat, and disaster. Furthermore, most children lack the emotional equipment to deal constructively with these intense feelings. Thus, they often engage in acting-out behaviors which can bring on more trauma and loss. To help them cope with the dangers of divorce, children need direct, non-blaming and honest information about what is happening and what they can expect. They need reassurance that their parents are not divorcing them, and that the parent-child relationships will be preserved and protected at all costs. They need to be protected from the negative or bitter feelings in the marriage. They need structure and routine and consistency. Finally, they need help in identifying and legitimizing the many intense and scary emotions they are feeling. And they need to be given alternatives for expressing and coping with these feelings. As stated earlier, the crisis of divorce involves not only danger but also opportunity. Once the traumatic feelings of pain and loss are being managed and the survival stage worked through, one can approach the healing and growing stages of loss/divorce. The crisis of divorce necessarily presents new beginnings. it offers the opportunity for self-examination and self-renewal, which, in turn, bring growth and fulfillment. At this point, it is possible to view a divorce, not as a failure, but as a learning experience. Through such processes as forgiving (self and others) , focusing on the gain that comes from pain, taking constructive action, discovering new relationships and new interests, and rediscovering yourself, one is able to build joy, excitement, creativity, and peace back into your life. For many, they end up with a better life and self than they started with before the crisis. For most of us, the challenge of coping with both the dangers and opportunities of divorce are enormous. There are many books available to assist you in these challenges. Two useful ones are Divorcing by Kranzler and Belli (detailing the emotional and legal/logistical aspects of divorce) and How to Survive the Loss of a Love by Colgrove, Bloomfiled and McWilliams (dealing with emotional survival, healing, and growing from loss in general). Also be reminded that there are professionals on campus who understand the painful realities of divorce and who can help you survive and eventually thrive following divorce. Consult with the Counseling Center in Shoemaker Hall (314-7651) or the Mental Health Clinic in the Health Center (314-8106). They offer support and help.

 urlLink THE FOUR EMOTIONAL STAGES OF DIVORCE WORK by Phil Rich, Ed.D., MSW. The End of Marriage The hallmark of the marriage is the expectation that this is to be a permanent relationship, in which both partners commit their lives to one another, joining their individual lives together in mutual co-existence. Accordingly, the breakup of a marriage can be devastating and life disrupting. Divorce may be the sensible route to go for any number of reasons, but nevertheless unless completely amicable and acceptable to both parties, divorce represents the ending of a romance and the failure of a partnership in marriage, and is bound to have an emotional impact on one or both partners. Regardless of the circumstances of a divorce or the conditions that led up to it, the clear basis for any divorce work is the idea that the break up of a marriage is a loss. Divorce is composed of both "technical" and "emotional" aspects. The technical aspects will be taken care of, one way or another by the legal process. But the "other" side of the process deals with the emotional aftermath. This is "divorce work" -- the process of dealing with and working through the sense of loss, emotions, and situations caused by the divorce. The Emotional Stages of Divorce Although every divorce is highly personal and unique, it can help divorcees to know that they're not alone in their confusion and despair, and that things improve over time. At this difficult time, it can help to understand what's typical in the divorce process, what to expect from their emotions and their life as their divorce progresses through the final decree and beyond, and the sort of emotional and practical issues that they're likely to experience, and in what order. These are the "emotional" stages of divorce -- the sequence of feelings and issues that divorcees typically go through. The necessary emotional aspects of divorce work, include: facing the reality of the divorce working through painful feelings experiencing the full range of emotions associated with the breakdown of a marriage coping with the situational and lifestyle changes resulting from loss adapting to the change, and reconfiguring life Stage 1: "Shock and Disbelief" begins as soon as the idea of a separation and divorce is introduced and sinks in. It involves four major tasks and issues to be worked through. Facing reality Self esteem and inadequacy Telling the world Support and help Stage 2: "Initial Adjustment" involves the ability of people to actively adapt to this new phase of their lives. The primary goal of this stage is adaptation and mustering the personal resources needed to manage the many emotional and practical changes faced by people during this phase of their divorce work, and tasks include: Functioning and responsibility Practical reality Legal Matters Managing emotions Stage 3: "Active Re-organization" centers around how people live their lives and cope with the tasks of being suddenly single. Major tasks to be dealt with and worked through include: Managing life style and practical affairs Re-defining relationships Reconstructing personal values and beliefs Concluding legal procedures Stage 4: "Life Re-formation" represents the final steps as readers pass through to the "other" side of their divorce. During this stage people deal with the emotional issues and life choices involved as they move on with their lives. Constructing relationships New interests Personal responsibility Accepting your new life Summary and Conclusion The first stage of the divorce typically passes the most quickly. It's the quick hit, and sometimes numbing shock wave, as people realize their marriage is over. The second and third stages are the most active and represent the bulk of active divorce work, covering the most active legal, practical, and emotional changes in life after divorce. The final stage represents that time in life during which divorcees are moving far away from their divorce, and into their new life. This stage really has no formal "end," and is marked by the full acceptance of the divorce and a resolution of most of the practical issues and many of the emotional. Of course, the reality is that many of the various tasks of each stage overlap. And things aren't as clean and neat as checking off one task and then moving on to the next. But helping divorcees recognize these stages and tasks can be an enormously useful way to help them see and understand the path that lies ahead for them. References: Burns B., & Whiteman, T. (1992.)

Dr. Dobson Responds: Men and women differ in countless ways, many of which they aren't even conscious of. Here are just a few of those differences: 1. A woman has greater constitutional vitality, perhaps because of her unique chromosomal pattern. Normally, she outlives a man by three or four years in the U.S. Females simply have a stronger hold on life than males, even in the uterus. More than 140 male babies are conceived for every 100 females; by the time birth occurs, the ratio is 105 to 100, with the rest of the males dying in spontaneous abortions.159 2. Men have a higher incidence of death from almost every disease except three: benign tumors, disorders related to female reproduction, and breast cancer.160 3. Men have a higher rate of basal metabolism than women.161 4. The sexes differ in skeletal structure, women having a shorter head, broader face, less protruding chin, shorter legs, and longer trunk. The first finger of a woman's hand is usually longer than the third; with men the reverse is true. Boys' teeth last longer than do those of girls.162 5. Women have a larger stomach, kidneys, liver, and appendix, and smaller lungs than men.163 6. Women have three very important physiological functions totally absent in men--menstruation, pregnancy, and lactation. Each of these mechanisms influences behavior and feelings significantly. Female hormonal patterns are more complex and varied. The glands work differently in the two sexes. For example, a woman's thyroid is larger and more active; it enlarges during menstruation and pregnancy, which makes her more prone to goiter, provides resistance to cold, and is associated with the smooth skin, relatively hairless body, and the thin layer of subcutaneous fat that are important elements in the concept of personal beauty. Women are also more responsive emotionally, laughing and crying more readily.164 7. Women's blood contains more water (20 percent fewer red cells). Since red cells supply oxygen to the body, she tires more easily and is more prone to faint. Her constitutional viability is therefore strictly a long-range matter. When the working day in British factories, under wartime conditions, was increased from ten to twelve hours, accidents among women increased 150 percent; the rate of accidents among men did not increase significantly.165 8. Men are 50 percent stronger than women in brute strength.166 9. Women's hearts beat more rapidly than those of men (80 versus 72 beats per minute). Their blood pressure (ten points lower than men) varies more from minute to minute, but they have much less tendency to high blood pressure--at least until after menopause.167 10. Female lung capacity is about 30 percent less than in males.168 11. Women can withstand high temperatures better than men because their metabolism slows down less.169 12. Men and women differ in every cell of their bodies because they carry a differing chromosomal pattern. The implications of those genetic components range from obvious to extremely subtle. For example, when researchers visited high school and college campuses to study behavior of the sexes, they observed that males and females even transported their books in different ways. The young men tended to carry them at their sides with their arms looped over the top. Women and girls, by contrast, usually cradled their books at their breasts, in much the same way they would a baby.170 Who can estimate how many other sex-related influences lie below the level of consciousness?

 Subject: Story for you.... Date: Mon, 9 Sep 2002 19:27:36 -0600 From: Jafree To: Heather Uniqueness Beyond superiority and inferiority Every human being is unique. There is no question of anybody superior or anybody inferior. Yes, people are different. Let me remind you of one thing; otherwise you will misunderstand me. I am not saying that everybody is equal. Nobody is superior, nobody is inferior, but nobody is equal either. People are simply unique, incomparable. You are you, I am I. I have to contribute my potential to life, you have to contribute your potential to life. I have to discover my own being, you have to discover your own being. When inferiority disappears, all feeling of superiority also disappears. They live together, they cannot be separated. The man who feels superior is still feeling inferior somewhere. The man who feels inferior wants to feel superior somewhere. They come in a pair; they are always there together; they cannot be separated. It happened... A very proud man, a warrior, a samurai, came to see a Zen master. The samurai was very famous, well known all over the country, But looking at the master, looking at the beauty of the master and the grace of the moment, he suddenly felt inferior. Maybe he had come with an unconscious desire to prove his superiority. He said to the master "Why am I feeling inferior? Just a moment ago, everything was okay. As I entered into your court suddenly I felt inferior. I have never felt like that. My hands are shaking. I am a warrior, I have faced death many times, and I have never felt any fear--why am I feeling frightened?" The master said, "You wait. When everybody has gone, I will answer." People continued coming to visit the master, and the man was getting tired, more and more tired. By the evening the room was empty, there was nobody, and the samurai said, "Now, can you answer it?" And the master said, "Now, come outside." A full moon night--the moon was just rising on the horizon... And he said, "Look at these trees, this tree high in the sky and this small tree. They both have existed by the side of my window for years, and there has never been any problem. The smaller tree has never said, 'Why do I feel inferior before you?' to the big tree. How is it possible? This tree is small, and that tree is big, and I have never heard any whisper." The samurai said, "Because they can't compare." The master said, "Then you need not ask me; you know the answer." Comparison brings inferiority, superiority. When you don't compare, all inferiority, all superiority, disappear. Then you are, you are simply there. A small bush or a big high tree--it doesn't matter; you are yourself. You are needed. A grass leaf is needed as much as the biggest star. Without the grass leaf God will be less than he is. The sound of the cuckoo is needed as much as any Buddha; the world will be less, will be less rich if the cuckoo disappears. Just look around. All is needed, and everything fits together. It is an organic unity: nobody is higher and nobody is lower, nobody superior, nobody inferior. Everybody is incomparably unique.

 urlLink Haiku For Beginners I guess the first thing you noticed is that they're short - two or three lines only. There are not many words in those lines either. And you didn't hear rhymes, did you? Beyond their physical form, these poems obviously have something else in common. It is something to do with the subject matter and the direct method of presentation. If we had time to discuss it we could refine that thought until we had something like this. The poems speak - about experience from the senses - directly and with intensity - about observation of nature They seek to construct a clear and significant image in our minds or perhaps to juxtapose or contrast two such images. Usually it is an image from nature or from daily life. Perhaps though, to say that the poem 'constructs' the image in our mind is a bad way of saying it. Really the poem is reminding us of something we've already seen, heard or felt. That's how they manage to conjure up so complex an image with so few words. One possibility is to go with what you know now. Let me first remind you of the rules I've already given you. The poem should be start with an image or a pair if them. It should be direct from sense experience, without metaphor, simile or rhyme. Haiku is of course a traditional Japanese form with further strict rules of construction. Not all are honoured outside Japan and even there some are defiantly broken. To what I've already stated let me add three more stipulations. three lines with 5 syllables, 7 syllables, then 5 one kigo or season word one kireji or cutting word The first rule is the most well known and it is the one most mentioned by writers on the subject of haiku. The idea is simple. Write a line of five syllables, follow it with a seven-syllable line and then use five syllables to make the final line. This gives you two short lines divided by a longer one. It goes a long way to guiding the method of expression in the poem. There is a good deal of controversy about this rule; but let's skip that for the moment and talk about the third. The kireji or cutting word is used to divide the haiku into two parts. Obviously this should be used to enhance the juxtaposition of images we discussed earlier. In English the tendency is to use punctuation, such as "-" or ":" to perform this function. The second rule that requires the use of a kigo or season word helps establish the season or time of year that the poem describes. For English-language haiku this rule is taken to remind the writer that the poem should be grounded in nature. But most important is that the form isn't the goal here. It's to write a good poem. So the exercise of writing haiku oneself is very important. Occasional reading and discussion on the form, tradition and history of haiku and reading others' haiku all help to feed the writing with new ideas and approaches.

 urlLink A Summary of the Twelve Houses The Twelve houses of the horoscope define twelve areas of our life. The beginning of each of the houses is called the cusp. Each house has what is called a natural sign and natural ruling planets. This is the sign and planet which are associated with that house in the natural chart beginning with Aries and ending with Pisces. The Astrodienst charts show another division of the houses. This division places the houses in groups that are on the angles, the angular (ang); houses that follow immediately behind each angular house, the succedent (suc) houses, and the third in line, the cadent (cad) houses. There are four each, angular, succedent, and cadent houses. Older books taught that planets in the angular houses were somewhat stronger and planets in the cadent houses were weaker in influence. Now little attention is paid to this idea.

 Osho Zen Tarot Patience We have forgotten how to wait; it is almost an abandoned space. And it is our greatest treasure to be able to wait for the right moment. The whole existence waits for the right moment. Even trees know it--when it is time to bring the flowers and when it is time to let go of all the leaves and stand naked against the sky. They are still beautiful in that nakedness, waiting for the new foliage with a great trust that the old has gone, and the new will soon be coming, and the new leaves will start growing. We have forgotten to wait, we want everything in a hurry. It is a great loss to humanity.... In silence and waiting something inside you goes on growing--your authentic being. And one day it jumps and becomes a flame, and your whole personality is shattered; you are a new man. And this new man knows what ceremony is, this new man knows life's eternal juices. There are times when the only thing to do is to wait. The seed has been planted, the child is growing in the womb, the oyster is coating the grain of sand and making it into a pearl. This card reminds us that now is a time when all that is required is to be simply alert, patient, waiting. The woman pictured here is in just such an attitude. Contented, with no trace of anxiety, she is simply waiting. Through all the phases of the moon passing overhead she remains patient, so in tune with the rhythms of the moon that she has almost become one with it. She knows it is a time to be passive, letting nature take its course. But she is neither sleepy nor indifferent; she knows it is time to be ready for something momentous. It is a time full of mystery, like the hours just before the dawn. It is a time when the only thing to do is to wait.

 urlLink Robert E. Wilkinson 's The Quantum Brahman In their search to explain the mechanics of creation, the world's leading theoretical physicists have determined that there are four fields of force in the universe. Scientists have been able to reduce and classify these fields in categories according to the strength of the force that they carry, and the particles with which they interact. The first of these categories is the Gravitational Force. It is the weakest of the four forces and has two special properties; it is able to act over large distances and is always an attractive force. The gravitational force is present in large bodies such as the Sun, Moon and Planets. The second category is the Electromagnetic Force which operates over short distances and interacts with electrically charged particles. While it is much stronger than the gravitational force, this force operates on the very small scale of atoms and molecules which possess two kinds of electrical charges, positive and negative, that tend to attract or repel one another. The third category called the Weak Nuclear Force, is responsible for radioactivity and is found in many nuclear decay processes that involve neutrinos. In 1979, scientists were able to develop a theory which successfully unified the weak nuclear force with the electromagnetic force as they had earlier been able to unify the forces of electricity and magnetism. It is now called the Electro-weak force. The fourth category, called the Strong Nuclear Force, binds particles together into combinations. Matter is mostly made up of protons and neutrons which in turn are made up of quarks. The strong nuclear force holds the quarks together in the proton and neutron and hold protons and neutrons together in the nucleus of an atom. While these four forces account for the theoretical dynamics of matter they do not appear to interact with each other in a manner sufficient to suggest a single unified field theory which could explain the natural ordering of the universe. This problem has forced scientists to continue their search for an as yet unidentified 5th field in nature which they hope will provide the basis for this long sought unification. Their search for this mysterious 5th field has led them to speculate about a sub-quantum reality described by the ancient sages as the Luminiferous Ether. It was believed to be an invisible medium that would fill all space and convey extremely subtle effects over large distances. To the world of science, this metaphysical possibility was not considered viable because physicists were not convinced that etheric forces played any significant role in physical interactions. But, upon closer investigation, they have come to believe that the Etheric may hold the key to the elusive 5th field. Leading theoreticians now conclude that this invisible sub-quantum field, capable of being the ground state of the universe, would be free of matter as well as the effects of gravitation. Since it resembles empty space, they appropriately named it the Quantum Vacuum. However, following more recent discoveries, they were forced to revise their notion of an etheric void in favor of new theories which suggest that the Quantum Vacuum is a highly charged cosmic medium; an energy-filled plenum whose subtle order measurably influences the space-time motion of the material universe. Scientists now agree that it was the Quantum Vacuum which gave birth to the observable universe. And they also believe that the 5th field which they are seeking is the interactive face of that plenum. A number of physicists now suspect that the dynamics of that interactive face hold the key to joining the fields of gravitation, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak nuclear forces in a Grand Unified Field Formula. The discovery of the Quantum Vacuum appears to represent a major paradigm shift for modern science but, at this point in time, very little is actually known about this puzzling phenomenon. Physicists cautiously agree that the Quantum Vacuum gave birth to the observable universe; that it is the source and sink of all matter and, that it may prove to influence the space-time motion of matter. There is even a growing consensus among scientists that Vacuum Physics lie at the core of everything. But, in spite of all these advances, they are still faced with a monumental problem; the discovery of the Quantum Vacuum has not really solved anything, it merely postulated a zero point beyond which empirical science cannot go. They have finally arrived at the womb of creation, but it is exactly as the ancient sages always said, unmeasurable. The laws of physics break down at this resonant threshold because they are unable to measure its infinite density. In order for science to arrive at a new system of knowledge which can unveil the interactive face of the Quantum Vacuum and measure the density of the Transcendent, it must first be willing to entertain a new understanding of Time. For Time is the key which unlocks the secrets of matter. For centuries physicists have been laboring under the illusion that Time was a derivative of Space even to the point of calling it 'Space-time' but, according to the sages, it is quite the opposite; Time is what gives birth to Space. In his commentaries on the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, one of India's oldest and most profound metaphysical texts, the philosopher-sage, Sri Aurobindo discusses the occult imagery associated with this fundamental principle: " ... The [image of the] horse is a physical figure representing like an algebraical symbol, an unknown quantity of force and speed. (Time is its breath, the year is its body, the seasons its limbs, the months and the fortnights its joints, the days and nights its feet.) From the imagery it is evident that this force, this speed, is something universal. Time in its period is the Self of the Horse Sacrificial, so not Matter but Time, is the body of this force of the material universe... Space then, is the flesh constituting materially this body of Time which the sage attributes to his Horse of the worlds, by movement in Space its periods are shaped and determined. Hence the real power, the fundamental greatness of the Horse is not the material world, not the magnitudes of Space, but the magnitudes of Time... for Time is that mysterious condition of universal mind which alone makes the ordering of the universe in Space possible." Sri Aurobindo, The Upanishads; 'The Great Aranyaka', Sri Aurobindo Ashram Press, 1971 In the higher ranges of consciousness, which the sages identify as the realm of pattern, all things exist in potentia, they are not here manifest. They may exist in Being but not in Time. They are precipitated into physical reality by the contracting power of Time. For it is Saturn/Chronos which differentiates the infinite energy-consciousness of the Supreme Godhead into material form. In its native state, the Absolute is unbound, undifferentiated and eternal; One without a second. In order for the Incomprehensible to become intelligible to itself, it becomes dense, first becoming audible and then visible. It does this through a process of contraction which slows down the vibrations of the infinite consciousness, gradually congealing it into a spatial field containing material forms. It manifests first as Cosmic and Planetary harmonies before reaching a highly specific individuation in the human domain. Through this alchemical process, the Absolute is reduced from its original state of undifferentiated Unity into Form and Multiplicity. This act of contraction, is the basis upon which the Greek myths portray Saturn/Chronos as having dismembered his father. In order to break the code of the Transcendent dimension, science must reverse this process of divine alchemy. It must abandon its philosophy of continued dismemberment or scientific reductionism in favor of a cosmological, or whole systems approach. Scientists must learn to embrace the view that material reality is not a collection of separate objects as it appears, but an undivided whole in which all parts merge and unite in one totality. Fortunately there are some theorists who recognize this possibility and are beginning to agree that the next great paradigm shift in science will be a cosmological revolution, because Cosmology, once the mother of all science, embraces the whole of reality and describes its order. One of the most impressive theories emerging out of scientific cosmology respecting these ancient truths was set forth by the late physicist, David Bohm in his book, Wholeness and the Implicate Order. Using the language of mathematics, Bohm set out to describe the transcendent reality and its graded energetic hierarchy in four basic states or orders of energy beginning with the physical world, which he called the Explicate Order. "The Explicate Order, weakest of all energy systems, resonates out of and is an expression of an infinitely more powerful order of energy called the Implicate order. It is the precursor of the Explicate, the dreamlike vision or the ideal presentation of that which is to become manifest as a physical object. The Implicate order implies within it all physical universes. However, it resonates from an energy field which is yet greater, the realm of pure potential. It is pure potential because nothing is implied within it; implications form in the implicate order and then express themselves in the explicate order. Bohm goes on to postulate a final state of infinite [zero point] energy which he calls the realm of insight intelligence. The creative process springs from this realm. Energy is generated there, gathers its pure potential, and implies within its eventual expression as the explicate order." Will Keepin, David Bohm, Noetic Science Journal When Bohm's resonant fields are arranged in a vibrational hierarchy they represent energy in successive states of manifestation from infinitely subtle to the gross physical reality. The Zero Point Order which Bohm identified as the realm of insight-intelligence bears an unmistakable resemblance to the supreme spiritual realization of Indian metaphysics known as the Brahman, a perfectly inactive, pure noetic plenum realized as Absolute Being. Realization of the Brahman is characterized by a complete fusion of Time and Consciousness which we experience as Timelessness, or undifferentiated Time. In this state Time-energy vibrates at such an intense rate that is appears static and thereby lacking any element of periodicity or denseness. Hence it cannot produce any form or any division of Consciousness-substance into distinct crystallised objects in Space. In the language of physics the Brahman would be infinite creativity in a resting or seemingly non-vibratory state, realized as Emptiness or a Void. It appears this way because, as energy moves toward an infinite state, its wave frequency increases. The amplitude or vertical distance between wave crests becomes smaller and smaller until the points of rest overlap, turning the oscillating wave into a straight line. In this manner, infinite energy may be realized as utter stillness or a zero point, precisely as the sages have said. Bohm obtained laboratory evidence of this phenomenon by proving the existence of wave lengths as small as 10 to the minus 34th power. His calculations indicate that one cubic centimeter of this Zero Point energy contains more power than all of the matter in the known universe. Bohm's work with Zero Point energy is extremely helpful in understanding the metaphysical nature of the universe, especially the process by which the Absolute or Brahman becomes manifest in Time and Space. And while he was never able to define the details of that process, his groundbreaking theories represent a major paradigm shift, not only for the world of science but for spirituality as well, because, like Sri Aurobindo, Bohm's discoveries contradict the perennial philosophy which posits Emptiness or a Void as the highest spiritual realization. "Nothing can arise from Nothing. Asat, nothingness, is a creation of our mind; where it cannot see or conceive, where its object is something beyond its grasp, too much beyond to give even the sense of a vague intangibility, then it cries out, "Here there is nothing." Out of its own incapacity it has created the conception of a zero. But what in truth is this zero? It is an incalculable Infinite... Our sense by its incapacity has invented darkness. In truth there is nothing but Light, only it is a power of light either above or below our poor human vision's limited range." Sri Aurobindo, The Web of Yoga, Centenary Edition, Vol. 17, p. 48 Bohm's breakthroughs in quantum physics have opened the way for a new and productive relationship between ancient wisdom and modern science because, for the first time, they establish Fullness rather than a Void as the ground state of the universe. The implications of this discovery are immense, not only because it offers science a new conceptual paradigm which may hold the key to grand unification but it lays the foundation for a new cosmology in which the polarities of Spirit and Matter may finally be joined in an integral synthesis harmonizing the various expressions of mind, life and matter. While these new theories hold exciting possibilities for science, they have been known and understood for millennia by the philosopher-sages of Vedic India. Long ago the Rishis postulated the existence of 5 fields with the 5th being the Etheric Plenum, or Fullness from which all things emerge. According to them, our material universe arose from a point or seed which lies at the resonant threshold of that Etheric Plenum. The Atharva Veda describes that point or seed as an 'Embryo [Hiranyagarbha] which, in the beginning, poured forth upon the universe a stream of gold.' This embryo or seed lies at the intersection of Time and Space, Spirit and Matter, where involutionary forms move across the event horizon and begin their linear evolution. In the language of scientific cosmology, this point or Seed is the singularity from which the universe exploded into being. In metaphysical terms it is the Luminiferous Ether, the OM or primordial vibration out of which the universe emerges and has its origin. All material creation issues from this original involved point or seed as involutionary forms move across the spatial threshold and begin to evolve linearly in accordance with the laws of causation and the principles of time. Once it crosses that resonant threshold the material universe is obliged to unfold in a manner that allows the Seer to follow the evolving in our Time measure of what was involved in that seed by compression or contraction. Knowledge of this involutionary process was the most coveted secret of the Vedic Rishis because It allowed them to follow the unfolding of that Seed and 'See' with an understanding which could be infinitely extended to all orders of reality. They were able to observe this occult process by using a unique system of cosmological knowledge which could measure from the Transcendent reality to its physical manifestation in an unbroken line. This knowledge was hidden in the symbol language of the Rig Veda but over the millennia its meaning became clouded over. The Seer became displaced by the Nirvani as emphasis shifted from Gnosis to a philosophy of Illusionism which denied the material world in favor of the attainment of a Transcendent consciousness. As a result of this development, the bridge between the Transcendent and the Physical became lost and was soon considered irrelevant. It was understood that the Brahman permeated everything, but how it had become the All was once again a great mystery. "When the realiser could no longer use the cosmos to express his spiritual experience, he introduced the cleavage...between form and essence. More importantly, that essence itself became deformed. The experience conveyed an unfocused vision of what is and immediately nothingness and voids became the way to describe that higher truth. This was a logical development in a world in which the cosmos lost its sense, its purpose and its relation of oneness to the human being and evolution of consciousness on Earth. Above all, creation became divested of true sacredness." Patrizia Norelli-Bachelet, The Vishaal Newsletter, October, 1988 Today, some two thousand years later, Science and Spirituality must face the consequences of these philosophies of illusionism which taught that Truth or Salvation, if it is to be attained at all, may only be realized in an afterdeath heaven or Nirvanic void - anywhere except the physical world we inhabit. The influence of these nihilistic philosophies has driven Science and Spirituality to the threshold of a major crisis in which both must discover a new and integrative paradigm in order to experience a meaningful continuity of existence. The key to that paradigm is a new understanding of Time and its primary role bridging the Transcendent and the Physical world. "It cannot be denied that Time is a major feature of our material universe. In consequence, it stands to reason that when spirituality decides that the universal manifestation is unreal and illusory, Time is immediately shunned and the seeker is required to go 'beyond time', i.e., to the experience that appears to obliterate Time. Conversely, if we are engaged in a path that seeks a transformation of matter and an experience of the highest planes of reality in this material creation we are obliged to accept the instrumentation of Time. Furthermore, we must seek a means or a key by which Time itself becomes the element utilized in the gestation of a new and superior consciousness-form in the material creation." Patrizia Norelli-Bachelet, The New Way, Vol. 3, 1983 In the early 1970's Patrizia Norelli-Bachelet, the world's leading authority on Vedic Cosmology, began to publish her ground breaking discoveries. She had recognized in the scriptures and mythologies of ancient India evidence of a highly enlightened cosmological culture. The Rishis, had developed precise formulas describing the dynamics of the involutionary process, and had woven these celestial equations into the structure of their myths and legends. Their knowledge of Time and the cosmic mysteries formed the basis of an ancient Yoga, the practice of which led to a supremely enlightened state known as Truth-Consciousness or Swar of the Veda. The Rishis understood that the Cosmos was a whole organism, multidimensional and sacred in its structure and form. They also knew that the difference between man/woman and the Cosmos was a matter of degree, rather than essence; that the Macrocosm and Microcosm had a correspondent equivalence. Through the repetition of certain rites, the sages believed that man could recover an awareness of his intrinsic identity with the Cosmos and thus perceive the hidden order of the world. Since this order was embedded in the structure and periodic movement of the Macrocosm, it was understood that a corresponding order could be discovered by the individual in the cycles and events of his own life. If man could learn to align himself with the harmonies of Cosmic Time, he would gradually become imprinted with their rhythms and realize within himself an immutable center or axis, from which he could acquire an entirely new orientation to his lived experience. Since the same Zero Womb, which gave birth to the universe is also the core of the human being, the unveiling of this Soul/center/axis in the individual led to a simultaneous realization of Truth-Consciousness or Gnosis. This was the essence of the Rig Vedic Yoga, lost for millennia until it was unveiled in the 1970's by Patrizia Norelli-Bachelet. From the principles of these ancient teachings, Ms. Norelli-Bachelet developed and articulated a new applied cosmology which she demonstrates in her book, The Gnostic Circle, a synthesis in the harmonies of the cosmos. "The Gnostic Circle is merely the combination of the zodiac the occult circle which contains the knowledge of the evolution and the structural pattern of the solar system. The Circle of 12 is the zodiac, and the Circle of 9 is our actual solar system, each orbit representing one year of Earth life. The joint harmony of these two, superimposed or synthesized in one circle, is what constitutes our key to the evolution and flowering of the seed of the Spirit. In fact we can say that the Gnostic Circle is mainly for this purpose: it shows mankind the ultimate and ideal perfection that can be attained during this particular phase of the evolution, during this great transition point from animal-mental to the more divine mankind." Patrizia Norelli-Bachelet ,The Gnostic Circle, p. 159, 1975 Ms. Norelli-Bachelet deals with what, for centuries, has been divorced from traditional spirituality, the question of Time and Measure. Her cosmology reverses the long-standing perception of Time as the destroyer and presents mankind with an entirely new awareness of Time as the integrative mechanism by which a Divine purpose is expressed in the world. Her seminal work discloses the deepest truths of material Reality which include the Being as well as the dynamics of the Becoming of that same Being. "Time", says Norelli-Bachelet, "is the vehicle, the medium for the Absolute or Supreme Consciousness to be and to become and it is knowledge of this principle which integrates the Spiritual and Physical dimensions and grants the individual a direct experience of the Supreme within the physical manifestation ." In Ms. Norelli-Bachelet's Cosmology, the Zero Womb or what science is now calling the Quantum Vacuum, has a symbolic correspondence to the Sun or primary Axis of our own Universe. The nine planets which orbit about the Sun represent the octaves or archetypes of form which have issued from that Zero/Womb/Axis. The planets also represent the number powers from 1 to 9 which form the mathematical basis of an ancient system of number harmonies called Cabalistic Reduction. Since every higher number is reducible to a simple number from 1 to 9, it is by means of number power that one is able to integrate the planetary harmonies with the harmonics of Number and relate the movement of the spheres to the Calendar which measures time periods on earth. Through this system of cosmic harmonies, the Gnostic Circle unveils the dynamic correspondences between Time and Space and describes the occult process by which energy-consciousness becomes crystallized into material forms. By unveiling the Quantum Brahman or body of the Absolute, Ms. Norelli-Bachelet reveals for the first time the complete details of the involutionary process which occurs in the Zero Womb, and the reversal, or emergence from its interactive face of solidified energy or material form. She has rebuilt the bridge between Spirit and Matter in a seamless continuum, using the harmonics of our very own cosmos to describe its order. Through the use of her Gnostic Circle we now have the means to measure the dynamics of that Implicate reality and follow its manifestation in time as the Explicate universe. Ms. Norelli-Bachelet's work represents a quantum leap in cosmological knowledge and contains the seeds of a unique synthesis which promises to open the way for new and revolutionary advances in both science and spirituality. 2/12/96 Robert E.

 urlLink No-Shame, No-Blame Creation Story by Clare Puskarczyk In the beginning... there was an entity of light within a lovely garden which was also made of light. A single being, with many aspects living in peace and harmony. When a serpent, who knew well of matter said, "Birth, Death, Rebirth." The quality of the light being that would become known as the feminine said, "Why Not? Exploration, process." The masculine energy said, "Structure, power." And the serpent said, Be aware, you may forget who and what you really are." She said, "We'll remember." And she said to the masculine energy, "I'll remind you of our light." And he agreed, and so they split in two, into two separate beings, and the Universe around them became a duality, And they forgot. And everything became heavy and matter now mattered most of all. Gravity became grave in its seriousness and grave as in death, and they suffered, and became ill, and felt lost and sometimes, they almost remembered... something. and there were times... when there was joy and light but always a longing to get back out of matter. back to where? And so they began to learn how to use matter and they thought they were powerful and so a great battle began. Everyone wanted to have power power over matter power over each other power over thoughts and feelings power over structures especially the masculine beings because their focus was structure. And they took things apart and made more...things. And often...there was fear, fear of each other, fear of thoughts & feelings, fear of the loss of structure. Structures became institutions But the feminine beings were not preoccupied with the institutions. Instead they were occupied with life, with nature, with babies and a different order of things. Sometimes... she would remind him of something, but he thought he would lose his power if he remembered and so he remained...forgetful. And for this... he held power over her, power over nature, power over his own natural self, as in control, repression, structure. Fear kept these beings time-bound and distanced them from their light inside, and their light remained interior while they took everything apart. Discovery pulled them forward until almost everything large and small was in pieces. what they didn't know was that the external world was becoming a reflection of themselves, fragmented selves with fragmented thoughts, conflicts unresolved, split inside. And the external world reflected opposites everywhere as in: Good people don't kill, but... we must have war & weapons to keep our power. Good people don't lie, but... we must deny and deceive to keep our power. Good people don't harm, but... we must argue and abuse to keep our power. Yet behind all of this there was still light, and there were those who would remember something and living differently some of them stood out as heroes...strangely enough. Finally... after many thousands of years, when the world was full of war and weapons, denial and deception and abuse of every kind, and matter had contracted as far as it could go, little sparks of light began to flash more & more often and remembering began to manifest as: concern for the environment, conflict resolution, love for one another with integration and wholeness bringing the fragments back together. Now... individuals were creating community, scientists discovering quantum leaps, spiritual psychology learning and teaching empowerment, and the lights became brighter still. Soon there were those who remembered very well that power was indeed interior, that everything was made of light, that evil meant to live backwards in fear, and that trust had the vibrational quality to bring light forward. And that everyone together had been Making it all up! Even still... people seemed to take sides. And in the end, those full of light looked at those full of fear and saw their light hidden inside and loved them. And those full of fear looked at those full of love and saw their light and remembered their own, and they all remembered together and began to lighten up. And soon they found themselves at home again... Back in the garden.

Please follow the copyright link for additional copyright information. Or go to one of the following links for final version copies or Reality Creator Books & Supplies. http://www.wisdomsdoor.com / http://www.realitycreatorbooks.com Note: This chapter is an exact copy of the printed book version! I think - therefore I am You create your world! No other concept possesses the power that this idea does. Think about it? The power to change your world rests within yourself within your mind! Thought-creation is a fact of reality, all realities. This physical reality however, would often have you believe otherwise. When you believe that your fate is in the hands of people and things that are beyond your control, you lose that fundamental power given to you: the power to create. You make it that much easier for others to manipulate and change your world into what they want, instead of changing your world into what you want. Remember! You have a right to create your own world. That right to create your own world was a gift to you from divine powers divine powers, we might add who cherish that right themselves. They would not think of relinquishing their power of self-creation and neither should you. Except, every time you feel that a particular situation is out of your hands, then that is what you are doing: relinquishing your power of creation and your ability to change the situation. To reclaim back your creative power involves taking two steps, changing your belief, and learning how to control the consciousness you possess. Doing both will take time. However, the sooner you begin, the sooner you will reap the benefits of deliberate reality-creation. To begin, you must shift from the belief that you live in a world you cant control, to a belief that you live in a world you can control. Along with this new belief, you must come to understand that the high-tech reality controlling device that you seek is your own consciousness. Your consciousness is the tool given to you by the divine that will enable you to change and shape your reality. Learning how to control that consciousness is the next step in the process. Good reality-control comes from within, not without. An uncontrolled consciousness can be like a wild, untamed animal. This untamed animal gets driven by many sources to do the things it does, like emotions, needs, and desires. All these factors play a part in controlling and directing your consciousness toward deliberate reality creation. Except, in an uncontrolled state, your consciousness roams freely, like a wild beast. When a particular factor overwhelms the beast, that factor becomes the new director of the beasts world. This haphazard direction of consciousness is what you want to avoid. Your consciousnesss driving forces must all be tamed and shown how they can work together to obtain what each needs and wants. Now, to help make our point, lets take a few moments and show you a few common patterns that indicate a wild and untamed consciousness. Does you mind wander regularly jumping from topic to topic? In other words, if you counted the amount of things your mind dwelled on, during a given hour, would the number be above five items? Anything above five items, in a one hour period, points to mind-wandering. Mind wandering is one of the more subtle ways you undermine your reality control and a sure sign you have the makings of an untamed beast. Do you continually look on the negative side of things? A negative outlook on your life is a sign that your emotions are controlling your consciousness not you! Emotions, when used properly, can be a good motivator of reality creating. However, when you allow your emotions free reign, the beastly side of them takes over. Emotional runaway is the most destructive form of reality control and another strong indicator of a wild beast within. Do you often feel mentally drained? Continual mental fatigue is an indication of poor inner-power regulation. With inadequate inner-power and poor inner-power control you can expect anything and everything to control your life. If you lack the inner-power and strength necessary to make the needed changes in your world, all the mental control in the world is not going to help you. Poor inner-power management is another way of self-defeating reality control and yet another example of something savage going on within you. Do you consciously understand the mechanics behind thought-creation? Not knowing how a device operates especially an inner device can greatly hinder your ability to use it. A computer is no good if you havent a clue how to operate it! Thought-creation is the same. Your consciousness needs to understand how to operate the inner and outer devices that enable you to control your world. Otherwise, youll be like a wild animal searching for food, operating on instinct alone. While the animal may eat, it may not eat well or at all on some days. So, if you dont understand these inner and outer creation devices, your consciousness is operating on instinct alone and is operating on a very primitive level. Im sure many of you answered yes to some of these questions. Answering yes does not make you a misfit; it just makes you unlearned. Being unlearned in the way consciousness does its job is inefficient and a waste of your personal resources. Because you live in a fast-changing world, deliberate reality control becomes a necessity. You must learn how to tame that beast, so that you can make your world the best it can be, for yourself and for others. With a controlled and tamed consciousness you can expect some changes in the way things happen in your life. For one thing, nothing unpleasant will surprise you. You will create the world you want and need. There will be no lurking ugliness that will spring up at the last minute. If you do get ugliness, you will be aware of it well in advance because you will be aware of yourself creating it. Your mind will no longer be an unchartered territory. You will be fully aware of the contents of your mind at any given time. Plus, you will understand why you react in certain ways and in certain situations. When an awkward, unwanted, or an unusual situation arises, you will have the power to act and the power to move that situation in a direction that is desirable to you. You will be the master of your fate and the helmsman of your destiny. You create your world! No other statement is more true. Now it is your job to learn how. Take the first step toward controlling your reality, and we can help you with the second. Recognize, at least a little, that you can and do have the power to create your world. Youve been doing it for years, since you were born and before. Then, lets take that second step together and learn how to properly use those inner tools inner tools that will enable you to control the greatest gift in your possession, your own consciousness. Worksheet Notes: On the next page is your first worksheet. It is a questionnaire designed to show you your present level of reality creating ability. Please take the time to fill in the questionnaire because the real power in this questionnaire will reveal itself when you come back to it, after youve finished the Hermes Reality Creator I course and retake the test. Your new score will show you how much you have progressed and how much farther you need to work the Reality Creating Game. Each question is designed to alert you to a different area of reality creating skill. Question one shows you how positively you think about your reality. Question two shows you how well you can control your lower self, your more base instincts, the animal part of you, if you will. Question three shows you how well you can keep your mind focused in the present moment. Question four shows you how well you can regulate your inner power (energy). Question five shows you how easily you can be coerced by others. After you take the test, then move on to the next chapter, but keep in mind the areas that you need to work on. As we get to that part of the book, you may want to pay extra attention to that section.

 urlLink Health threat from computer use Long haul air travel is not the only activity to pose a risk of developing potentially deadly blood clots - sitting at your computer for too long may also put you at risk. The European Respiratory Journal reports the case of a young man from New Zealand who nearly died after developing deep vein thrombosis following long periods of physical inactivity in front of his computer. It may be similar to the situation with the risk of blood clots with long distance air travel. The man, the first recorded victim of a condition which has been dubbed e-thrombosis, spent up to 18 hours a day using his computer. He developed a massive blood clot that formed in his leg veins, broke off and travelled to his lungs. Although the controversy about long-haul air travel has recently put DVT in the headlines, the condition was first described in people sitting on deckchairs in air raid shelters during the Blitz in London.

 urlLink QuitNet QuitGuide Physical Addiction Within just 7-10 seconds of inhaling cigarette smoke, nicotine begins affecting your brain. Nicotine acts on cells in the reward center of the brain. This results in feelings of pleasure and alertness- the "hit" that your body comes to expect. When bloodstream nicotine levels are at their peak, the brain is highly stimulated. However, within just 30 minutes, your body has cleaned out most of the nicotine. You then feel tired, jittery, depressed, or fatigued. You begin to crave another cigarette, and the cycle continues. This cycle, which increases in intensity and frequency over time, is part of what makes cigarettes so addictive. Essentially, smoking becomes a never-ending battle of trying to stay within the comfort zone.

 urlLink Help for Cravings and Tough Situations What to Do Right Now and to Create a Smoke-free Future For the first few days after you quit, spend as much free time as possible in places where smoking is prohibited - libraries, museums, theaters, churches. Drink a lot of water and fruit juice. Don't drink alcohol, coffee, and other beverages that you associate with smoking. Strike up a conversation instead of a match for a cigarette. If you miss the feeling of having a cigarette in your hand, play with something else - a pencil, a paperclip, a marble. If you miss the feeling of having something in your mouth, try toothpicks, cinnamon sticks or celery. AVOID TEMPTATION by staying away from situations you associate with pleasurable smoking. FIND NEW HABITS and create a non-smoking environment around you. Keep from picking up the habit again by anticipating future situations/crises that might make you want to smoke again, and remind yourself of your reasons to not give in. Take deep rhythmic breaths similar to smoking to relax. Remember your goal and the fact that the urge will eventually pass. Think positive thoughts and avoid negative ones. Brush your teeth. Do brief bursts of exercise (isometrics, pushups, deep knee bends, walk up a flight of stairs, or touch your toes). Call a supportive friend.

 urlLink People with Moon In Virgo Does this sound like me? Moon in Virgo Earth Sign Emotionally spontaneous is not a phrase to describe a Virgoan Moon personality. Like their companion in the Earth signs, Taurus, there isnt the headlong rushing into commitments, either. Virgoan Moons dont overanalyze the relationship as much as they look at the value the relationship may have for themselves. They may hesitate to move at all unless they feel they are on solid ground, or there is some personal advantage to be gained by their emotional involvement. As lunar Earth sign personalities, those with Moon in Virgo are guarded about their feelings. Virgoan Moons dont much care for discussing openly their emotions as if reporting their portfolio. This is not an ego issue like their neighbor, Leo, as much as it is a ploy to intrigue others to get to know them more intimately. It isnt easy loving a person with a Virgo Moon because they are over-critical in emotional expressions. Believe it or not, this Moon sign may actually be unrealistic at times about their own emotions. Their passion can sometimes be confused with compassion. An over-critical or too analytical approach to emotional situations makes it difficult for them (as well as the others involved) to freely or spontaneously express feelings. Serious-minded, with common sense about most things, they can be surprisingly unrealistic. As a result, they tend to gravitate to situations they know eel rather than explore and be adventuresome with their emotions. This leads Virgoan Moons too often repeating the same thing over and over again, expecting a different result each time and not getting it. Virgo Moon personalities are emotionally adaptable. They instinctively seem to know what it takes to make others feel better. They make many friends because of their sympathetic nature, but it also means they are vulnerable to being exploited. Though they are not all scholars, they are likely to be fond of books and writing. Intellectual curiosity gives them a penchant for gathering information that can develop into serious research endeavors, or turn out to be just a fondness for gossip. At times they can be overly fastidious, usually with regard to eating habits. Concern with health makes many of them outstanding health care professionals. Their own preoccupation with health can become exaggerated to the point of hypochondria, or they can be guilty of using maladies to attract sympathy. They are mentally and emotionally stimulated by travel, communication, and information.

 Subject: Remembering Martin Luther King, Jr. Date: Fri, 17 Jan 2003 13:58:56 -0800 From: "FAIR" To: "FAIR-L" FAIR-L Fairness & Accuracy In Reporting Media analysis, critiques and activism Remembering Martin Luther King, Jr. This year, Martin Luther King Jr. Day comes as the U.S. is moving toward war in Iraq. As media prepare to air retrospectives on King, we thought it would be a good time to circulate this 1995 column by FAIR founder Jeff Cohen and FAIR associate Norman Solomon. ------------------ Media Beat, January 4, 1995 The Martin Luther King You Don't See on TV By Jeff Cohen and Norman Solomon It's become a TV ritual: Every year in mid-January, around the time of Martin Luther King's birthday, we get perfunctory network news reports about "the slain civil rights leader." The remarkable thing about this annual review of King's life is that several years-- his last years-- are totally missing, as if flushed down a memory hole. What TV viewers see is a closed loop of familiar file footage: King battling desegregation in Birmingham (1963); reciting his dream of racial harmony at the rally in Washington (1963); marching for voting rights in Selma, Alabama (1965); and finally, lying dead on the motel balcony in Memphis (1968). An alert viewer might notice that the chronology jumps from 1965 to 1968. Yet King didn't take a sabbatical near the end of his life. In fact, he was speaking and organizing as diligently as ever. Almost all of those speeches were filmed or taped. But they're not shown today on TV. Why? It's because national news media have never come to terms with what Martin Luther King Jr. stood for during his final years. In the early 1960s, when King focused his challenge on legalized racial discrimination in the South, most major media were his allies. Network TV and national publications graphically showed the police dogs and bullwhips and cattle prods used against Southern blacks who sought the right to vote or to eat at a public lunch counter. But after passage of civil rights acts in 1964 and 1965, King began challenging the nation's fundamental priorities. He maintained that civil rights laws were empty without "human rights"-- including economic rights. For people too poor to eat at a restaurant or afford a decent home, King said, anti-discrimination laws were hollow. Noting that a majority of Americans below the poverty line were white, King developed a class perspective. He decried the huge income gaps between rich and poor, and called for "radical changes in the structure of our society" to redistribute wealth and power. "True compassion," King declared, "is more than flinging a coin to a beggar; it comes to see that an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring." By 1967, King had also become the country's most prominent opponent of the Vietnam War, and a staunch critic of overall U.S. foreign policy, which he deemed militaristic. In his "Beyond Vietnam" speech delivered at New York's Riverside Church on April 4, 1967-- a year to the day before he was murdered-- King called the United States "the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today." >From Vietnam to South Africa to Latin America, King said, the U.S. was "on the wrong side of a world revolution." King questioned "our alliance with the landed gentry of Latin America," and asked why the U.S. was suppressing revolutions "of the shirtless and barefoot people" in the Third World, instead of supporting them. In foreign policy, King also offered an economic critique, complaining about "capitalists of the West investing huge sums of money in Asia, Africa and South America, only to take the profits out with no concern for the social betterment of the countries." You haven't heard the "Beyond Vietnam" speech on network news retrospectives, but national media heard it loud and clear back in 1967-- and loudly denounced it. Time magazine called it "demagogic slander that sounded like a script for Radio Hanoi." The Washington Post patronized that "King has diminished his usefulness to his cause, his country, his people." In his last months, King was organizing the most militant project of his life: the Poor People's Campaign. He crisscrossed the country to assemble "a multiracial army of the poor" that would descend on Washington-- engaging in nonviolent civil disobedience at the Capitol, if need be-- until Congress enacted a poor people's bill of rights. Reader's Digest warned of an "insurrection." King's economic bill of rights called for massive government jobs programs to rebuild America's cities. He saw a crying need to confront a Congress that had demonstrated its "hostility to the poor"-- appropriating "military funds with alacrity and generosity," but providing "poverty funds with miserliness." How familiar that sounds today, more than a quarter-century after King's efforts on behalf of the poor people's mobilization were cut short by an assassin's bullet. As 1995 gets underway, in this nation of immense wealth, the White House and Congress continue to accept the perpetuation of poverty. And so do most mass media. Perhaps it's no surprise that they tell us little about the last years of Martin Luther King's life. ------------------ Media Beat is Norman Solomon's weekly syndicated column on media and politics.

 urlLink Gather the Women Beginning the week of March 3-8, 2003, linked globally by our interactive website, we are inviting women to demonstrate their courage to risk leaving old conformities by joining with millions of others throughout the world in thousands of unique events celebrating woman's true worth, expressing shared concern for our human family, and creating and supporting actions that will enable humanity to live together in a world based on life-affirming values. Gather the Women is evoking at a profound level an experience of our own woman's worth to the world. As women we bring life forward. We are in touch with the cycles of life and we function in a context that is deeply relational. This realization is allowing women to risk leaving the safety of our comfortable conformities. We have the capacity to generate creative solutions that benefit all life on the planet. Gather the Women is creating a rich exchange of cultural values to dissolve the ties that bind us to the illusion that one segment of our human family can win while another loses. Together we women are contributing to a new collective wisdom and we are lending our strength to that which we wish to embrace. From this emerging balance is being born a new dimension of our humanity.

 Nicotine is the addicting chemical in all forms of tobacco. It is a very powerful and dangerous drug - a small child can die from eating just two cigarettes. Nicotine causes the release of brain chemicals, which can give a "high" similar to other addicting drugs. It may be as addicting as heroin. The body goes through a physical "withdrawal" when the nicotine level drops - causing the "nicotine fit." Nicotine withdrawal can be very unpleasant - many smokers find it difficult to quit due to nicotine addiction. Withdrawal symptoms can include anxiety, irritability, poor concentration, restlessness, craving nicotine, stomach problems, headaches and drowsiness. These symptoms must be addressed for most smokers to successfully become non-smokers.

 urlLink TNT - The Power Within You From Raphaela on 2/7/2003 11:41:34 AM Stop bemoaning your fate and get wise to yourself. You have only two choices. You can either go higher or lower. You may take to drink or help yourself to a first-class nervous breakdown or wander around through the rest of your life, moaning about "what might have been" if you had only lived your life differently - but telling yourself "it's too late now". But if you belong to that smaller percentage of men and women who have "gotten wise to themselves", you discover that it is never too late to get on the right track. You discover that you have been passing up the most wonderful force in your life, the creative power within, which has been ready and willing, at all times, to serve you. A deep feeling of humility steals over you, and you lose your falsely assumed attitudes of egoism and self-importance forever. Once you are down to bedrock, you find that you have a foundation on which to build, that you can pick up your life again and make something of it, something finer than ever before, perhaps not so flashy or so gaudy, but so much more worthwhile, satisfying, healthful and enjoyable. Now, at last, you can decide what is best for you, without worrying about what the other fellow is going to do to you unless, perhaps, you do it to him first. There has come to you the inner assurance that whatever you need can and will be supplied to you by your creative power, if you keep in attunement with it, and direct it by right mental picturing. Not only this but you realize that you have been missing out on many things in life of far greater value than many of the things you thought you had to have a short time ago.....There is no way out, there is no way back, there is no other way but through.......Claude M.

 urlLink Halliburton subsidiary wins Iraqi oil firefighting contract WASHINGTON (AFP) - The US army said it gave the main Iraqi oilwell firefighting contract to a unit of Halliburton Co., a firm once run by Vice President Dick Cheney without any bidding. Kellogg, Brown and Root, a unit of Houston, Texas-based Halliburton, was handed the contract by the Army Corps of Engineers, which has been placed in charge of fighting the blazes. The contract had not been put out to tender, said the Corps spokesman, Lieutenant Colonel Gene Pawlik. Kellogg, Brown and Root (KBR) had already been asked by the Pentagon (news - web sites) to draw up plans for extinguishing oil well fires in Iraq (news - web sites), Pawlik noted. "It made the most sense to engage them in the near term as the company to get the mission done because they were familiar with the details of the fires themselves and what would be needed," he said. The value of the contract would depend on the scale of the work. The chief of Britain's armed forces, Admiral Sir Michael Boyce, said Friday that Iraqi forces had set fire to seven oil wells in the south of the country. KBR would claim the cost of its services plus two to five percent depending on how it executed the job, Pawlik said. "KBR was selected for this award based on the fact that KBR is the only contractor that could commence implementing the complex contingency plan on extremely short notice," the company said in a statement. KBR said it had teams of well control and engineering contractors preparing the initial phase. The company was given a free hand to choose subcontractors for the work, the Corps spokesman said. KBR chose Houston-based Boots and Coots International, with which it has a services and equipment partnership, and Wild Well Control Inc. as firefighting subcontractors. President George W. Bush (news - web sites)'s spokesman, Ari Fleischer (news - web sites), said he did not have the details. Asked about the contracting process, Fleischer told a news conference: "The question that people want to be answered is we have a plan in place to put out the oil fires. Refer your question to the agencies involved. I am not familiar with the details of this contract." In a statement late Monday, the Defense Department said the Army Corps of Engineers would rely largely on contractors to extinguish the oil well fires and assess the damage to facilities. Kellogg, Brown and Root was the prime contractor for the initial phase, Pentagon said. The contract would be in force for an interim period, until additional contracts were procured, it said. "We have surveyed these wells and are preparing to mobilize the equipment," Boots and Coots president Brian Krause said in a statement. "We will begin stabilization of the wells once the location around the wells is secure," he said. Boots and Coots was brought into Kuwait in 1991 to control about 240 of more than 700 burning wells following the Gulf War (news - web sites), it said. Cheney was chief executive of the KBR parent company Halliburton, a major oil services company, for five years until 2000.

 urlLink PERSONAL MINISTRY: Advancing God's Kingdom TOOLS OF THE TRADE Message # 4: (Selected Scriptures) Taught by Dr. Larry Osborne North Coast Church January 30 & 31, 1999 As in all families, joining God's family brings with it certain responsibilities. And one of our most important responsibilities is to help advance God's Kingdom. But how can we determine the specific assignment and role God has for us? That's what we'll discover today as we explore the importance of a personal ministry and the special tools called spiritual gifts that make it possible to carry out that ministry. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- FAMILY CHORES We all have a unique set of God given gifts, skills and resources. I Corinthians 12:1 & 7/ I Corinthians 4:7/ James 1:17 We are responsible to use them to advance God's Kingdom. I Peter 4:10-12/ Matthew 25:14-30 & Luke 19:11-27 If we don't use them, we lose them. Advancing God's Kingdom is NOT optional. The goal is to match what we do best with where we're needed most. WHAT DO I DO BEST? Discovering Our Spiritual Gift Mix 1) Our spiritual gifts may or may not match our passions and desires. Exodus 3:1-4:18/ I Chronicles 26:16-20 You can miss out on what God has for you by pursuing your desires. 2) Giftedness is based upon God's sovereignty not our spirituality. Romans 12:6 & I Corinthians 12:4-6/ I Timothy 1:12-16 3) The greater the glory, the less important the gift. I Corinthians 12:21-26 4) The best way to discover our spiritual gifts is to do something and then check the result. Matthew 25:14-30, Luke 19:11-27 WHERE AM I NEEDED MOST? Discovering Our God Given Assignment THREE TOUGH QUESTIONS: 1) Do I have the right paradigm? (viewpoint) Am I looking at this properly? Am I out to win the war or am I being self-indulgent? 2) Do I have the right goal? Is my goal to serve the Lord or is it self fulfillment? Was your service hard or did it just make you feel good? 3) Am I making a real impact? Matthew 26:36-45 When? Where? How?

 Voyeurism urlLink War in the digital age: Did you see that? by Francis Till Digital technology is bringing the war to the world in new, sometimes astonishingly immediate ways -- and the development is not always welcome. Anyone caught without a television, for example, can watch a free, live webcast of downtown Bagdhad on a computer screen, 24/7, courtesy BBC News. That link works on internet-capable PDAs, by the way, which can hook up to wireless nets and provide broadband streams to anyone in an 802.11x cloud, even over coffee in a Starbucks anywhere. Very early monday morning, that camera was trained on a bank of the Tigris river as Iraqi soldiers and police combed the reeds on the shore in search of what was later reported to be two downed American pilots. The soldiers fired their automatic weapons into the river, violating whatever passes these days for the rules of handling capture, small boats flitted about in the water, angry crowds gathered on the bridge and along the river road. The audio feed from the camera, which is adequate for loud sounds like traffic and bombs, caught the excited voices of the crowd and even some of the gunfire. Al Jazeera cameramen were with the soldiers and moments after the webstream fed the images into computers all over the world, very similar pictures began to bloom on television as the Qatar-based station put its images up to satellites. On BBC webstream 4, the talking heads in the newsroom were taking in the story and beginning to put it out to their global audience. BBC's webstream 4 is a duplicate feed of the news channel's broadcast, with slight variations: at times, it shows presenters during broadcast breaks, for example. According to the presenters, RAF sources said they could account for all their flights and none were missing. Within 10 minutes, they had quotes from senior officials at the Pentagon making similar statements about American aircraft. Yet, clearly, something was taking place on the banks of the Tigris, where some of the gathered crowd had begun tossing torches into the reeds, hoping to burn the hiding airmen out. Al Jazeera reported on television at that point that one American pilot had been captured and the crowd was searching for a second airman. According to Al Jazeera, both airmen had been seen parachuting into the river after their airplane had been shot down. Al Jazeera did not use modifiers. Sky news, at that point, began inserting tag frames onto a picture of the search that quoted US Central Command saying that no coalition planes had been shot down. On the webstream feed, the sky over Bagdhad began to show as a kind of eerie charcoal grey due to the plumes from burning oil pits, lit earlier in the day in a futile attempt to mask targets from the war planes and missiles. Meanwhile, the webcam broadcast the sounds of an incoming air attack. Hours before, webcams and television cameras had streamed out images of long range bombers leaving remote bases. Now, they were quite possibly arriving over their target. A target full of civilians, exposed and too far away from shelters to reach what passes for safety in Bagdhad today. As the crowd began to break up, heading for cover, word came over Sky News from American Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld that, indeed, a UK warplane, with two pilots, was missing. Not the Tornado shot down earlier by an American Patriot missile, but another. But then, it was revealed, he was speaking in only general terms, without specific knowlege. And finally, an astute BBC reporter pointed out that many things -- bombs, equipment -- came down from airplanes in parachutes. Which might explain the conspicuous absence of a crashed airplane. BBC World News, unfortunately anchored at that mid-afternoon (London time) hour by an earnest second-stringer, reported it by saying that Rumsfeld had said American soldiers were missing and that an "allied aircraft" was missing. BBC's on-the-scene reporter had a firmer grasp of events, reminding the somewhat febrile broadcaster of what had been said in Washington only moments before. To no avail -- because no matter how good the technology becomes, users will absorb only what they are willing to take in. In America, England, Australia -- the countries flying planes into danger -- families would have been watching the screens of televisions and computers with dread. They were taking everything in, according to the raw testimony of Nancy Chamberlin, the wife of a fallen Marine, who had told NBC anchor Tom Browkaw a day before that she deeply admired what "all of the new technology is doing today to bring it (the war) into our homes. But for the mothers and the wives who are out there watching it is murder. It's heartbreak. We can't leave the television. Every tank, every helicopter. Is that my son?" After she hung up the phone, Brokaw broke up on the air. "War is not about technology," he said. "Behind everyone one of those computer graphics, there is a life at risk," LostRemote reported. And, indeed, as the bombers drew closer to Bagdhad, authorities there admitted there were no captured pilots. And, perhaps, no plane shot down at all. It's difficult to lie when the cameras are on. And the cameras are always on, these days. Even at 50 miles-per-hour. Spectacular footage from NBC reporter David Bloom, that has become a staple of the audience devoting its share to that network, is being made possible by a truck-sized transmision platform that keeps honed in on satellites even while rampaging across difficult terrain. The equipment is from Maritime Telecommunications Network (MTN), of Miramar, Florida, and the broadcasts must be seen to be believed. But even though it is ALL digital, it's not all cameras. The websites of Iraqi national television, the state news agency and the government were all still online Friday, although working poorly under what internet analysts said are huge surges in traffic. The websites appear to have been abandoned, for the most part, however, with out of date information and broken links to live feeds. By Sunday night, it was almost impossible to reach any of the Uruklink sites, and while the Iraq television spash page was easily accessible, its link to "live coverage" was broken. The Iraqi News Agency site, part of the Uruklink system, has been in trouble for some time, if links are to be believed. It contains an outdated link to the former website of the Iraq Satellite Channel (www.iraqtv.ws) which has since been taken over by what appears to be a Christian expatriate group dedicated to the overthrow of the regime. According to Brian McWilliams of pc-radio.com, "Web surfers have encountered intermittent problems reaching Uruklink.net, the Iraq government's main website, after the US launched its initial attack Wednesday night. But those access difficulties were apparently due to a surge of Internet visitors rather than to damage from the bombing. "In fact, traffic to Uruklink.net is hitting record levels, according to counters at the site. The homepage of Uruklink.net had over 10,000 visits yesterday, and is on pace to hit 14,000 today. That would represent the busiest day at the site since the counter was installed in December. The previous traffic record occurred on Feb. 9, when the site's address was published in the Drudge Report." McWilliams told Politech, a web-based newsgroup run by journalist Declan McCullagh, that the main Iraqi internet sites may only be visible to visitors from outside the country, but that the country's two mail servers were still operational and responding to ping inquiries.

 Osho Zen Tarot Trust Don't waste your life for that which is going to be taken away. Trust life. If you trust, only then can you drop your knowledge, only then can you put your mind aside. And with trust, something immense opens up. Then this life is no longer ordinary life, it becomes full of God, overflowing. When the heart is innocent and the walls have disappeared, you are bridged with infinity. And you are not deceived; there is nothing that can be taken away from you. That which can be taken away from you is not worth keeping, and that which cannot be taken away from you... why should one be afraid of its being taken away? It cannot be taken away, there is no possibility. You cannot lose your real treasure. Osho The Sun Rises in the Evening Chapter 9 Commentary: Now is the moment to be a bungee jumper without the cord! And it is this quality of absolute trust, with no reservations or secret safety nets, that the Knight of Water demands from us. There is a tremendous sense of exhilaration if we can take the jump and move into the unknown, even if the idea scares us to death. And when we take trust to the level of the quantum leap, we don't make any elaborate plans or preparations. We don't say, "Okay, I trust that I know what to do now, and I'll settle my things and pack my suitcase and take it with me." No, we just jump, with hardly a thought for what happens next. The leap is the thing, and the thrill of it as we free-fall through the empty sky. The card gives a hint here, though, about what waits for us at the other end - a soft, welcoming, yummy pink, rose petals, juicy...c'mon!

 Ripeness Only if your meditation has brought you a light that shines in every night will even death not be a death to you but a door to the divine. With the light in your heart, death itself is transformed into a door, and you enter into the universal spirit; you become one with the ocean. And unless you know the oceanic experience, you have lived in vain. Now is always the time, and the fruit is always ripe. You just need to gather courage to enter into your inner forest. The fruit is always ripe and the time is always the right time. There is no such thing as wrong time. Osho A Sudden Clash of Thunder Chapter 6 Commentary: When the fruit is ripe, it drops from the tree by itself. One moment it hangs by a thread from the branches of the tree, bursting with juice. The next moment it falls--not because it has been forced to fall, or has made the effort to jump, but because the tree has recognized its ripeness and simply let it go. When this card appears in a reading it indicates that you are ready to share your inner riches, your 'juice'. All you need to do is relax right where you are, and be willing for it to happen. This sharing of yourself, this expression of your creativity, can come in many ways--in your work, your relationships, your everyday life experiences. No special preparation or effort on your part is required. It is simply the right time.

A main opposition Kurdish group claimed that Saddam was hiding in Tikrit. _ The war is "one of the most extraordinary military campaigns" ever conducted, and the advance of U.S. troops into Baghdad proves early criticism of the war's plans was misguided, Vice President Dick Cheney said. _ The foreign ministers of Britain and France, downplaying differences that preceded war in Iraq, said the United Nations must have a role in the country's reconstruction but gave no indication that they agree on details. _ The United Nations says $720 million in aid is now bound for Iraq but sees a need for $2.2 billion more in emergency funds. _ U.S.-led forces pounded Saddam Hussein's desert hometown Tikrit, where desperate loyalists were making a last stand as resistance in Baghdad crumbled. _ U.S. special operations troops and Kurdish fighters eliminated a crucial air defense installation near the government-held city of Mosul. _ An International Red Cross employee and two members of the Doctors Without Borders relief group have vanished in Baghdad, the organizations said.

 urlLink Courage The seed cannot know what is going to happen, the seed has never known the flower. And the seed cannot even believe that he has the potentiality to become a beautiful flower. Long is the journey, and it is always safer not to go on that journey because unknown is the path, nothing is guaranteed. Nothing can be guaranteed. Thousand and one are the hazards of the journey, many are the pitfalls - and the seed is secure, hidden inside a hard core. But the seed tries, it makes an effort; it drops the hard shell which is its security, it starts moving. Immediately the fight starts: the struggle with the soil, with the stones, with the rocks. And the seed was very hard and the sprout will be very, very soft and dangers will be many. There was no danger for the seed, the seed could have survived for millennia, but for the sprout many are the dangers. But the sprout starts towards the unknown, towards the sun, towards the source of light, not knowing where, not knowing why. Great is the cross to be carried, but a dream possesses the seed and the seed moves. The same is the path for man. It is arduous. Much courage will be needed. Osho Dang Dang Doko Dang Chapter 4 Commentary: This card shows a small wildflower that has met the challenge of the rocks and stones in its path to emerge into the light of day. Surrounded by an aura of bright golden light, it exposes the majesty of its tiny self. Unashamed, it is equal to the brightest sun. When we are faced with a very difficult situation we have a choice: we can either be resentful, and try to find somebody or something to blame for the hardships, or we can face the challenge and grow. The flower shows us the way, as its passion for life leads it out of the darkness and into the light. There is no point fighting against the challenges of life, or trying to avoid or deny them. They are there, and if the seed is to become the flower we must go through them. Be courageous enough to grow into the flower you are meant to be.

 urlLink Osho Zen Tarot 28. Receptivity Receptivity Listening is one of the basic secrets of entering into the temple of God. Listening means passivity. Listening means forgetting yourself completely - only then can you listen. When you listen attentively to somebody, you forget yourself. If you cannot forget yourself, you never listen. If you are too self-conscious about yourself, you simply pretend that you are listening - you don't listen. You may nod your head; you may sometimes say yes and no, but you are not listening. When you listen, you become just a passage, a passivity, a receptivity, a womb: you become feminine. And to arrive one has to become feminine. You cannot reach God as aggressive invaders, conquerors. You can reach God only...or it will be better to say God can reach you only when you are receptive, a feminine receptivity. When you become yin, a receptivity, the door is open - and you wait. Listening is the art for becoming passive. Osho A Sudden Clash of Thunder Chapter 5 Commentary: Receptivity represents the feminine, receptive quality of water and of the emotions. Her arms are extended upwards to receive, and she is completely immersed in the water. She has no head, no busy and aggressive mind to hinder her pure receptivity. And as she is filled she is continuously emptying herself, overflowing, and receiving more. The lotus pattern or matrix that emerges from her represents the perfect harmony of the universe that becomes apparent when we are in tune with it. The Queen of Water brings a time of unboundedness and gratitude for whatever life brings, without any expectations or demands. Neither duty or thought of merit or reward are important. Sensitivity, intuition and compassion are the qualities that shine forth now, dissolving all the obstacles that keep us separate from each other and from the whole.

There is nothing that points to evolution proceeding. On the contrary when we compare humanity with a man we quite clearly see a growth of personality at the cost of essence, that is, a growth of the artificial, the unreal, and what is foreign, at the cost of the natural, the real, and what is one's own.... Contemporary culture requires automatons. And people are undoubtedly losing their acquired habits of independence and turning into automatons, into parts of machines....

 urlLink Weekly Review - May 27, 2003: Harper's Magazine The United States and several other countries banned Canadian beef after a mad cow was discovered in Alberta. Officials were quick to point out that there was no evidence that beef from the cow, which was slaughtered in January, had entered the food chain, although they admitted that the carcass had been sent to a rendering plant and that the protein produced by the plant is sometimes used in pet food. "I want to stress from the beginning this is one cow," said the minister of agriculture. "Don't try to leave the impression that this animal went into the feed chain." Last year more than 500,000 head of cattle were exported from Alberta to the United States. Prime Minister Jean Chretien made a public show of eating a steak. SARS continued to spread in Toronto, and Britain's foreign office told travelers to avoid Taiwan because of the continuing outbreak there. The SARS virus was found in six masked palm civit cats and in a raccoon dog; SARS antibodies were also found in a Chinese ferret badger. Investigators said it was probable that the virus had jumped from one of the Chinese delicacies to humans. A new television channel devoted exclusively to SARS opened in Singapore. A British man who walked alone to the North Pole was sitting there waiting for somebody to come give him a ride home, and a 70-year-old Japanese man climbed Mount Everest. A wild turkey was found perched on a 28th-floor balcony in Manhattan. American intelligence officials decided that two trailers found in Iraq were used to manufacture bioweapons even though they had found no evidence that the trailers were used for that purpose. Bush Administration officials claimed to have "rock-hard intelligence" that an Al Qaeda cell operating in Iran had directed the recent bombings in Saudi Arabia. Donald Rumsfeld, the secretary of defense, was asked to describe the role played by the Iranian cell; he said he knew but wasn't "going to get into it. That's for others to do." State Department officials revealed that the administration was planning to destabilize the Iranian government; others were more worried about the Al Qaeda cells in Saudi Arabia said to be plotting new attacks. American interrogators were forcing Iraqi prisoners to listen to songs by the rock band Metallica as well as the "Sesame Street" theme song and the "I Love You" song by Barney the purple dinosaur in order to make them talk. "These people haven't heard heavy metal. They can't take it," said one Psy Ops officer. "If you play it for 24 hours, your brain and body functions start to slide, your train of thought slows down and your will is broken. That's when we come in and talk to them." The Pentagon announced that it was changing the name of the Total Information Awareness project to "Terrorist Information Awareness." The program will search for data patterns that suggest terrorist activity; the project is also funding research into "human kinematics" and "gait recognition," apparently so that terrorists can be identified by their "walking style." It occurred to several prominent Democratic senators that the president might have deliberately exaggerated the threat posed by Iraq in order to scare people into supporting an invasion. Senator Pat Roberts, a Republican from Kansas, said he believed that weapons of mass destruction would be found, but added that "basically, you have a real credibility problem" if they are not. Former Iraqi soldiers were beginning to get restless; about 50 demonstrated in Basra and demanded that their salaries be paid by the occupiers: "If they don't pay us, we'll start problems," said one. "We have guns at home. If they don't pay us, if they make our children suffer, they'll hear from us." Members of the Arab Saraefien tribe near the Iranian border were also threatening to take up arms. "The Americans promised us food and medicine and freedom. But we have lost our homes, our land, our crops. Now we live in prison with nothing, and they ignore us," said Hadeb Hamed Hamed, the tribe's sheikh. "If we don't have a solution, we will fight the Americans even if they kill us. It is better than sitting here with nothing and just dying." In Morocco, a satirist was sentenced to four years in prison for "insulting the king" and "undermining the monarchy." The Dixie Chicks were booed at the Academy of Country Music Awards. Christine Todd Whitman resigned as head of the Environmental Protection Agency and said that President Bush had been "hurt" by his inability to explain his environmental policies. The House of Representatives voted to exempt the Pentagon from environmental laws that protect animals such as the tidewater goby fish, the Arroyo toad, the San Diego fairy shrimp, and the coastal California gnatcatcher. Governor Jeb Bush of Florida signed a bill that could delay the restoration of the Everglades for ten years. The town of Sublimity, Oregon, was trying to sell its old unwanted water tower on Ebay. The Republican Party was selling lunch with Karl Rove, the president's political adviser, to anyone who can raise $50,000, and the Center for Public Integrity reported that Federal Communications Commission officials have taken more than two thousand trips to tourist destinations such as Las Vegas and New Orleans that were paid for by media and telecommunications companies. It was reported that Republican fund-raisers who bring in at least $200,000 for the 2004 campaign will be called "Rangers"; those who bring in $100,000 get to be called "Pioneers." The number of Christians who tithe was down 62 percent compared with last year. Israel formally accepted the "road map" to peace, and Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said that "the moment has arrived to divide this tract of land between us and the Palestinians."

 urlLink Yahoo! News - Iraqis Test Newfound Press Freedoms Mon May 19, 9:37 AM ET Add World - AP to My Yahoo! By BASSEM MROUE, Associated Press Writer BAGHDAD, Iraq - On one street in the capital, a vendor shouts out news he would have been arrested for trumpeting just weeks ago: "Read all about Saddam's double!" A woman skids her car to a stop and asks for a copy of Assaah, a newspaper published in Iraq without government supervision. Iraqis are now enjoying media freedoms unheard of in the eight decades since the nation was established by British colonialists. During the last part of Saddam Hussein (news - web sites)'s 23-year presidency, no foreign newspapers were allowed into Iraq. Satellite dishes were banned, and cable television was prohibitively expensive. The sole windows to the outside world were radio stations like the BBC, Paris-based Radio Monte Carlo, and the U.S. government's SAWA Radio. Since the regime was overthrown in early April, a throng of freewheeling newspapers, radio and television stations have sprung up to replace the turgid, sycophantic media under Saddam. In the days immediately following the dictatorship's collapse, the country was left without any newspapers. State-run television and radio stations went off the air. The vacuum was quickly filled by papers published by anti-Saddam groups in northern Iraq's Kurdish areas, such as al-Itihad ("Union") and Nidaa al-Mustaqbal ("Call of the Future"), which made their way to Baghdad. The London-based Arabic-language newspaper al-Hayat became the first foreign daily to be sold in the country on April 17. Within days, new newspapers began appearing on the streets. Three independent radio stations and several local television stations went on the air. "It is still too early to speak about the freedom of the press," said Ali Abdel-Amir, senior editor of Nidaa al-Mustaqbal, a newspaper of the Iraqi National Accord, a longtime umbrella organization for Iraqi opposition groups. "There is anarchy now," Abdel-Amir said. "Many of these people working in the press are not professional or objective." The U.S.-led military coalition that occupied the country has two radio networks of its own, one run by former employees of station previously owned by Saddam's elder son, Odai. Information Radio features news announcements, Arabic music and even Western music like the occasional rendition of "The Power of Love" by Huey Lewis and the News. Another station, Radio of the Iraqi Republic, run by former Information Ministry officials, urges listeners to forget the past and work together for a better future. In Baghdad, viewers can tune into the coalition information channel or watch channels from neighboring Iran, primarily the Arabic-language Al-Aalam. Ali al-Fatlawi, a reporter who worked previously for government newspapers, says working for Assaah is much better. "There is more freedom and more openness," he said. "The red lines have been lifted, and we can express ourselves freely and without threats."

 urlLink News - US post-war effort seen as on the brink of "fiasco" "It's close to a fiasco," said Loren Thompson, an analyst with the Lexington Institute, a Washington research organization. "The contrasts between the efforts to rebuild Iraq and the stunning military victory could hardly be more pronounced." Rejecting criticism that the United States failed to prepare for the post-war occupation, US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld has suggested that no plan could have anticipated the conditions confronting US forces. "You couldn't know how it would end," Rumsfeld said in an interview with The New York Times published Sunday.

Ahmed Chalabi, head of the Iraqi National Congress and a great favorite of the Pentagon, warned his detractors that he had acquired about 60 tons of documents from the files of the Iraqi secret police and the Baath Party, and that the documents detailed Saddam Hussein's relations with other Arab leaders. He also threatened to shut down Al Jazeera and accused the television station's journalists of having been informants for the Iraqi government. "We will not allow this channel to continue its destructive work, which might lead to civil war in Iraq through their lies and the spreading of rumors, because rumors," Chalabi said, "are worse than killing." President Bush continued to maintain that "Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction" even as high-ranking administration officials said that they would be "amazed" if such weapons were found. Other officials suggested that actual illegal weapons might not be found and said that they were more concerned with proving that there had been a "capability" to produce them. Weapons experts working in Iraq claimed that they had found a mobile bioweapons laboratory; other military officials in Iraq were skeptical of the claim, saying the evidence was inconclusive and that no trace of such weapons had been found. "We came to bear country and we came loaded for bear," said one Defense Intelligence Agency official, "and we found that the bear was not there." Iraqi nuclear scientists warned that partially enriched uranium from the Al Tuwaitha Nuclear Research Center had been taken by looters. "I saw empty uranium-oxide barrels lying around," one scientist said. "We saw people using them for milking cows and carrying drinking water." People living near giant hog factories in the United States were complaining of neurological damage from hydrogen sulfide gas and other dangerous pollutants produced by vast manure cesspools. The Environmental Protection Agency was planning to give large industrial livestock farms amnesty for violations of the Clean Air Act and other environmental laws. Donald Rumsfeld, the secretary of defense, nominated an oilman from New Mexico to be secretary of the Navy. Two American soldiers were shot dead in Iraq, and people there continued to complain about the ongoing chaos and violence of the occupation. Doctors at Baghdad's Al Rashad state mental hospital said that American soldiers had knocked down their walls with tanks and then did nothing as the hospital was looted. The sole remaining patient, an insane killer named Ali Sabah, explained that he had stayed because "I hate the world and the world hates me. I don't want the monkey to see me and I don't want to see the monkey." Senator Orrin Hatch, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, dropped his attempt to make permanent the broad surveillance powers granted the federal government by the Patriot Act, which are set to expire in 2005, and the Senate voted to expand the power of the government to spy on suspects who are not known to be associated with terrorist organizations. A German diplomat charged that the United States is turning into a police state. The National Archives announced that it was giving up its attempt to recover the famous 18-and-a-half-minute gap in President Richard Nixon's White House tapes. Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy testified at his own bribery trial; he complained in an interview that he hadn't been to his house in Bermuda in three years, and said that he was the only man who could save Italy from Communism. "How much longer," he asked, "do I have to keep living this life of sacrifices?" A one-year-old boy was shot dead by Israeli soldiers as he played outside his home in the Gaza Strip. Israel was cracking down on human-rights activists, and it began to require all foreigners entering the Gaza Strip, including United Nations relief workers, to sign a waiver stating that they will not hold the Israeli army responsible if it injures or kills them. Prime Minister Ariel Sharon dismissed the American peace "roadmap" as "useless formulations that are not connected with reality." A truck bomb killed at least 29 people at a government compound in Chechnya. A new study found that violent song lyrics produce violent thoughts and emotions in listeners. King Mohammed of Morocco released 9,459 prisoners from jail to celebrate the birth of his son, Hassan, and reduced the sentences of 38,529 others. William J. Bennett gave up gambling; Mario Cuomo, the former New York governor, said he didn't see what Bennett had done wrong and pointed out that gambling is "not among the seven great sins or even among the 70 small ones." The crew of the cargo ship Pesca Well was under investigation in Panama for possibly throwing five Dominican stowaways overboard. "This case should be a lesson for all seafaring men," said a magistrate. "Throwing people overboard is no way to solve a problem." One hundred twenty-nine passengers were sucked out of a Congolese cargo plane when its rear door opened at 33,000 feet. President Bush appeared to be irritated at criticisms of his recent Top Gun moment: "Listen," he said, "it was an honor for me to go on the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln. I appreciate the chance to thank our troops. It was an unbelievably positive experience." British scientists put six Sulawesi crested macaques in a room with a computer for a month and found that the monkeys, despite their affection for the letter S, failed to produce a single word but displayed a particular interest in defecating and urinating on the keyboard. It was reported that Microsoft is developing a portable toilet equipped with Internet access. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals announced a "partial moratorium" on its boycott of Kentucky Fried Chicken, a division of Yum Brands, after the company agreed to several demands, such as putting cameras in slaughterhouses to make sure the chickens are butchered as humanely as possible. A special federal and state task force was offering grief therapy to farmers in California whose chickens and other fowl were killed to stop the spread of Exotic Newcastle Disease. Federal authorities said that they will permit passengers to take cats, dogs, and other animals, including monkeys, on airplanes for emotional support but not snakes, rodents, or spiders. Swedish authorities refused to permit a couple to name their baby "Staalman," which is Swedish for "Superman." The dollar was down against the euro.

 Why are Women Leaving Corporate America and Where are They Going? by Denise Grer urlLink http://www.cobolreport.com/columnists/denise/07292002.asp In todays fast paced world, people are expected to change jobs many times and even change careers several times in their lifetime. Even so, women are leaving corporate America at twice the rate of men. Why are they leaving and where are they going? Many are leaving because they are fed up with the obstacles thrown in their path solely due to their gender. Many have seen their careers make slower progress than their male colleagues, not due to their competence but due to what has been coined as the glass ceiling. Many need and want more autonomy and flexibility that corporate America is not willing to give. Many simply want to be their own boss and do for themselves what they have been doing for their employers. For all these reasons and more, large numbers of women are leaving high paying and challenging jobs to start their own businesses. A majority of these organizations are wildly successful. Women-owned businesses are growing more rapidly than the overall economy and becoming major contributors to the U.S. overall economic health and competitiveness. Why Are Women Leaving? Even though women are making inroads into the executive suites of corporations, they are moving at a snails pace. The glass ceiling is still firmly in existence and holding many women back. Thus, the first logical hypothesis would be that women are leaving to start their own companies because they have run into too many roadblocks at their current institutions. In fact, the glass ceiling was the highest ranked reason given by a survey of women entrepreneurs (23% of respondents) (Moore and Buttner 1997). In addition, an almost equal number of women (21%) stated that creating a work environment more consistent with their values was the main reason they started their own company. In a different study by Catalyst, the highest ranked reasons women gave for leaving a company were lack of flexibility (51%), the glass ceiling (29%), unhappiness with the work environment (28%), and feeling unchallenged in their job (22%) (Catalyst 1998). This suggests that women are being driven from traditional corporations due to blockades to career advancement and poor work environments. This further suggests that these entrepreneurs are not only driven by a desire to create a viable business but to be able to make a difference in their companys direction and to integrate their work into their lifestyle, in other words, job autonomy, freedom, and flexibility. In many cases, women feel they need meaningful work in order to have a fulfilling and meaningful life. This cannot be accomplished if they are expected to fit into a niche and morph themselves into a corporate identity. Another factor is many women feel they are undervalued. In fact, pay equity is still a problem. In the year 2000, women made 87 cents to every dollar a man made (Chao 2001). More specifically, in the year 2000 women technicians earn 81.2%, computer programmers 89.6%, engineers 84.3%, mathematical and computer scientists 85.4%, and natural scientists 72.1% of what their male counterparts earn (USDoL 2001). Another interesting statistic is married women with children (less than 18 years old) make 96.2% of their female counterparts who do not have children. However there is virtually no difference in pay (99.3%) between married men with children and married men with no children. This discrepancy could be attributed to the fact that mothers still take on a larger burden of care for their children than the fathers and this affects their careers. To counteract this problem, women need support and flexibility for balancing work and family so they can be 100% productive in both. Many view this support as something the company should provide. When the company does not come through, women perceive this as a key contributor to a poor working environment and opt to start their own business where they have more control over such factors. How Can Corporations Reverse This Trend? In todays knowledge based economy the loss of high-level women in corporations is a loss in intellectual capital, knowledge, and connections. The loss of good people also precipitates low morale and uncertainty among the staff and incurs the cost of recruiting, hiring, and training replacements. All of this can be avoided in many cases through low cost and innovative programs and changes to the work culture and environment (Donahue 1998). A corporations first step is to determine why women are leaving their company in particular. This could involve obtaining feedback from the employees through interviews or surveys (with a guarantee of confidentiality) and directed questions in exit interviews. Statistics must be gathered to understand the extent of the problem. These could include the numbers of women and men entering and leaving the company at different levels, the promotion rate for women and men, the percentage of women in higher management position and where those positions are located (e.g., engineering vs. human resources), and relative salaries grouped by experience, reviews, responsibilities, and other criteria. Gender inequity issues should be openly discussed without fear of repercussion. In particular, discussions could center around whether the performance standards are objective and appropriate, whether women are visible enough (or at all) in highly respected positions, the identification of male only traditions, and how mentoring is and should be conducted within the company. It is only when the key problem areas are identified that initial steps can be taken to correct them. Based on this research, goals and solutions to these problems must be formulated and mapped out and then finally implemented. It is crucial that the company, all the way up to the executive office, is fully supportive of this effort. Managers must be held responsible for implementing the procedures and meeting the defined goals for gender equity. Some example activities are: being proactive in identifying high potential women and providing mentoring and support for their upward career movement; making the higher ranking women more visible to the rest of the company; ensuring job searches include qualified women candidates; and providing flexibility in the workplace through flextime, onsite or supported childcare, and telecommuting. Women tend to learn more from other people in the company than their male counterparts (Van Velsor and Hughes 1990). Thus, mentoring and executive development are crucial for the upward movement and retention of women in the organization. Another key factor that professional women state over and over again for leaving a company is they felt underutilized and undervalued. This is in large part due to the necessity of constantly proving their competence because they are different from the one good model (i.e., male). Other models that fit women management styles should be accepted and encouraged throughout the corporation. Essentially the bottom line is: why should women devote all their efforts to fit into an unfriendly culture when they can leave and start their own business? If business organizations are genuinely concerned about this loss of talent, they must immediately start making changes to their culture and be proactive about the recruitment and retention of women. Given the move towards a global economy and need for more diversity, corporations cannot afford to ignore the large pool of talented professional women. Characteristics and Culture of Women Owned Businesses Starting a company is a difficult road, fraught with hurdles, setbacks, and barriers. However, the professional women who are starting their own businesses are finding that they enjoy the empowerment, excitement, and flexibility. They are doing things their way, implementing their ideas and management styles. For high tech businesses, the majority of women-owned firms are in the biotechnology industry (46%) with 29% in information technology. Just the opposite is true for men with 47% in information technology and 33% in biotechnology (NFWBO 2001b). This follows current trends in bachelor degree awards in the U.S. The most recent statistics from the Department of Education show women graduates at 58.3% of B.S. graduates in biological and life sciences and only 28.1% in computer and information science (NCES 2001). No matter what the business area is, women bring a different management style and culture to the table. NFWBO found that 53% of women business owners emphasize right-brain thinking (creativity and values-based decision making), while the majority of male business owners (71%) stress left-brain thinking such as methodological and procedural analysis (NFWBO 1994). The same study found that two-thirds of women business owners tended to weigh options and reflect internally before decision making more so than their male counterparts (66% vs. 56%), who tended to emphasize action and give more attention to external events. The attributes of a companys leadership have a strong effect on the culture of the workplace. Women entrepreneurs are more likely to describe their workplace in family terms and work within a network of business relationships. Men entrepreneurs, on the other hand, tend to think more in hierarchical terms and focus on establishing clear rules and procedures (NFWBO 1994; Grer 2001). The NFWBO study also found that in addition to monetary gain, women tend to derive success from building relationships with customers and employees and having control over their own destiny. Men on the other hand, derive success from the satisfaction of a job well done and achieving desired goals. Thus, womens leadership approaches are more likely to bring about an environment that is a web of inclusion (see Grer 2001; Helgesen 1995), while mens leadership is more likely to encourage hierarchical organizations with a top down approach. Another characteristic of women owned businesses is that they are more likely to offer environments that help provide balance in their employees lives through programs such as flextime, tuition reimbursement, and job sharing. Only 30% of small businesses (less than 25 employees) offer flextime, while 40% of women owned small businesses do. For large businesses (greater than 25 employees), 40% of women-owned firms provide flextime as compared to only 19% of all large firms (NFWBO 1994). In addition, 21% of women-owned small businesses offer tuition reimbursement programs, as compared to only 8% of all small businesses. Diversity is another factor that can be affected by company leadership. Not surprisingly, women-owned firms tend to employ a more gender-balanced workforce. Women-owned businesses employ half women and half men (52% women and 48% men). Men-owned firms, on the other hand, employ only 38% women and 62% men (NFWBO 2000a). The Success of Women-Owned Businesses From an economic viewpoint, women owned businesses are quite successful. In 1999, women-owned businesses numbered at 9.1 million, employed over 27.5 million people, and generated over $3.6 trillion in sales (NFWBO 1999). Of these businesses established in the last decade, the average earns $500,000 or more in revenue. These businesses are also financially stable. Women owned firms are as likely to pay bills on time and are as financially sound as all U.S. firms (CWBR 1995). Businesses owned by women are the most rapidly expanding sector of the economy. The growth in the number of women-owned firms, employment, and revenue exceeded the rate of growth of all businesses in 1997 (USCB 1997). From 1987 to 1999, the number of women-owned firms increased by 103%, employment grew by 320%, and sales shot up by 436%. With respect to high tech firms, a higher percentage of women-owned high tech firms are fast growing than men-owned firms, 48% vs. 28% (NFWBO 2001a), although women-owned firms are in the minority in the high tech sector. Still Some Difficulties Even though women-owned firms on average are very successful, there are still obstacles faced due to gender. One key difficulty is most women owners of fast-growth firms are less likely to have entrepreneurial mentors or role models, past experience in owning a business, or an executive professional background. These are all crucial in assisting the entrepreneur along the path of success. Women entrepreneurs of fast growth firms have to depend more on personal debt and business earnings for financing than their male colleagues. Only 39% of women-owned firms have a commercial bank loan vs. 52% of men-owned firms. In addition, equity capital for women-owned businesses typically comes from informal investors such as family members and individual angel investors (73%) with only 15% from venture capital firms (NFWBO 2000b). Women owners of fast-growth firms are also less likely to share ownership of their firms with outside investors (28% for women vs. 49% for men) (NFWBO 2001b). This reliance on personal and informal debt is holding women-owned firms back since high growth depends in large part to being able to leverage debt and equity. Given these factors, it is crucial that women are given access to entrepreneurship information and mentoring in order to succeed. There are currently programs that strive towards these goals many of which can be linked to via the Center for Women's Business Researchs website at http://www.nfwbo.org Catalyst for Change? The management style, work culture, and employee benefits offered by women-owned companies not only provide for powerful economic forces, but are influential social forces as well. Interestingly, the concerns of women in the workplace are also starting to apply to men as well. A recent survey of technology professionals by Webgrrls, in western New York, found that both men and women were experiencing an imbalance between their work and home life (38% of respondents) (Drury 2001). Men are now beginning to demand more of a balance between their personal and work life. In addition, men are taking more of a role in raising their children and other nontraditional male at-home responsibilities. It is now possible to find stay-at-home dads where the mom is the sole source of income for the family. However, it is still the majority of women who are concerned with work/life balance and quality of work environments. The Webgrrls survey found 76% of women feel their work environment is very important versus 51% of men. Even so, there is a substantial number of men who are starting to realize they want to spend more time outside of work and that a pleasant productive work environment is important. As the workforce and business leadership become more diverse and markets become more global, the workplace culture is slowly evolving. The tides of change are coming for more flexible and family or people-friendly workplaces. Regardless of the effect on workplace environments, it is clear that more and more businesses are being created and run by women. These businesses are largely successful and it is not too wild of a speculation to state that the women-owned businesses of today will become the Fortune 500 companies of the future.

 Alert: Total Lunar Eclipse Set Thursday AP to My Yahoo! LOS ANGELES - If the weather cooperates, a total lunar eclipse will be seen across North America late Thursday the first visible in the United States in three years and just before dawn Friday in western Europe and western and southern Africa. A lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth casts its shadow on the full moon, blocking the sunlight that otherwise reflects off the moon's surface. Unlike solar eclipses, lunar eclipses are safe to view with the naked eye. In North America, the moon will remain totally eclipsed for 53 minutes, and should turn substantially darker and reddish in color. The total eclipse will start at 8:13 PDT in Los Angeles, 11:13 p.m. EDT in New York. A second lunar eclipse, on Nov. 8, will be visible from North and South America. Eclipses once helped prove the Earth is round, because its shadow on the moon is curved.

 Shining true being: Meditation for the Dying Imagine that your body no longer has the strength, the energy, to maintain its connection with the life-force, with the body of awareness within. And imagine now that you are beginning to experience the process of dissolving out of that body. Sensations from the body no longer so distinct, melting away, leaving just a spaciousness. Dissolving out of the body. Leaving that heavier form behind. Dissolving into consciousness itself. My friend, listen now, for that which is called death has arrived. So let go gently, gently, of all that holds you back. Of all that pulls you away from this most precious moment. Know that now you have arrived at the transition called death. Open to it. Let go into it. Recognise the changing experience of the mind as it separates from the body, dissolving. Dissolving now into the realms of pure light. Your true nature shining everywhere before you. My friend, maintain an open-heartedness, a spaciousness of being that does not grasp. Let things be as they are without the least attempt to interfere. Grasping at nothing. Enter the essential nature of your own being shining there before you, a great luminosity. Rest in being. Knowing it for what it is. This light shining, luminous. Your true self. Let go, gently, gently, without the least force. Before you shines your true being. It is without birth, without death. Let go of all which distracts or confuses the mind, all that created density in life. Go gently into it. Do not be frightened or bewildered. Do not pull back in fear from the immensity of your true being. Now is a moment for liberation. Know that you are well guided by your compassion and love. You are the essence of all things. You are the light. From 'Who Dies?' by Stephen Levine.

 For Each of You Be who you are and will be learn to cherish that boistrous Black Angel that drives you up one day and down another protecting the place where your power rises running like hot blood from the same source as your pain. When you are hungry learn to eat whatever sustains you until morning but do not be misled by details simply because you live them. Do not let your head deny your hands any memory of what passes through them nor your eyes nor your heart everything can be useful except what is wasteful (you will need to remember this when you are accused of destruction.) Even when they are dangerous examine the heart of those machines you hate before you discard them and never mourn the lack of their power lest you be condemned to relive them. If you do not learn to hate you will never be lonely enough to love easily nor will you always be brave although it does not grow any easier Do not pretend to convenient beliefs even when they are righteous you will never be able to defend your city while shouting. Remember our sun is not the most noteworthy star only the nearest. Respect whatever pain you bring back from your dreaming but do not look for new gods in the sea nor in any part of a rainbow Each time you love love as deeply as if it were forever only nothing is eternal. Speak proudly to your children where ever you may find them tell them you are the offspring of slaves and your mother was a princess in darkness. - Audre Lorde in From a Land Where Other People Live

 urlLink Researchers create flexible, paper-thin electronic screen Associated Press In a step toward electronic newspapers and wearable computer screens, scientists have created an ultra-thin screen that can be bent, twisted and even rolled up and still display crisp text. The material, only as thick as three human hairs, displays black text on a whitish-gray background with a resolution similar to that of a typical laptop computer screen. The screen is so flexible it can be rolled into a cylinder about a half-inch wide without losing its image quality. Although it's not quite the dream of single-sheet, electronic newspapers or books that can display hundreds of pages of text, its creators said it's the first flexible computer screen of its kind. ``I think it's a major step forward. We have cleared a big obstacle in electronic paper development,'' said Yu Chen, a research scientist with E Ink Corp. of Cambridge, Mass. E Ink is one of several companies working to develop electronic ``paper'' for e-newspapers and e-books, and other possible applications -- even clothing with computer screens sewn into it. The new screen is described in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature. Aris Silzars, the past president of the San Jose, Calif.-based Society for Information Display, said one of the technology's first applications could be something like an electronic tablet lawyers could use in place of bulky laptops. But Silzars said the best uses of the new screen, which E Ink is still developing, may not be evident. ``It's very hard to predict where this thing may go,'' he said. Chen and his co-workers made the 3-inch wide display screen flexible by developing a stainless steel foil topped with a thin layer of circuits that control an overlying film of electronic ink. That ``ink,'' developed in 1997 by a Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientist, contains tiny capsules with black and white particles with opposing electrical charges floating in a clear fluid. When a negative voltage is run through circuits behind these capsules, the positive white particles move to the capsule's top. A positive current does the same to the negative black particles. The human eye blends these resulting patterns of black- or white-topped capsules into text displayed in a traditional column. Currently, information and power is fed to the screen through a wired hookup. But Chen's team is working on a self-contained system that could receive data through a wireless connection. They also hope to boost the speed at which the screen switches to a new ``page'' of text, from the current quarter of a second to at least 10 times as fast, so it can display video. Another goal is making the screen display a full range of colors. Robert Wisnieff, senior manager of IBM Corp.'s Advanced Display Technology Laboratory in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., said E Ink's flexible screen is something many futurists believe is crucial to making electronic screens part of every day life. He envisions such lightweight, thin screens being used for a credit card that could display the available balance or recent purchases. Another possible use is a jacket with a screen sewn into its sleeve to allow its wearer to read e-mail while on the run, check stock prices or access maps in an unfamiliar city. ``This is a peek at the future,'' Wisnieff said.

 urlLink Inner Voice If you have found your truth within yourself there is nothing more in this whole existence to find. Truth is functioning through you. When you open your eyes, it is truth opening his eyes. When you close your eyes, it is truth who is closing its eyes. This is a tremendous meditation. If you can simply understand the device, you don't have to do anything; whatever you are doing is being done by truth. You are walking, it is truth; you are sleeping, it is truth resting; you are speaking, it is truth speaking; you are silent, it is truth that is silent. This is one of the most simple meditation techniques. Slowly, slowly everything settles by this simple formula, and then there is no need for the technique. When you are cured, you throw away the meditation, you throw away the medicine. Then you live as truth - alive, radiant, contented, blissful, a song unto yourself. Your whole life becomes a prayer without any words, or better to say a prayerfulness, a grace, a beauty which does not belong to our mundane world, a ray of light coming from the beyond into the darkness of our world. Osho The Great Zen Master Ta Hui Chapter 23 Commentary: The Inner Voice speaks not in words but in the wordless language of the heart. It is like an oracle who only speaks the truth. If it had a face, it would be like the face at the center of this card - alert, watchful, and able to accept both the dark and the light, symbolized by the two hands holding the crystal. The crystal itself represents the clarity that comes from transcending all dualities. The Inner Voice can also be playful, as it dives deep into the emotions and emerges again to soar towards the sky, like two dolphins dancing in the waters of life. It is connected with the cosmos, through the crescent-moon crown, and the earth, as represented by the green leaves on the figure's kimono. There are times in our lives when too many voices seem to be pulling us this way and that. Our very confusion in such situations is a reminder to seek silence and centering within. Only then are we able to hear our truth.

A suicide bomber, who turned out to be a British citizen, responded to the confirmation of Mahmoud Abbas as prime minister by blowing up a nightclub in Tel Aviv, leaving body parts scattered along the shore. A day later Israeli tanks invaded a crowded neighborhood in Gaza and killed 12 Palestinians, mostly civilians, including two-year-old boy, in a hunt for a Hamas weapons smuggler. UNICEF reported that since the beginning of the second Palestinian intifada 92 Israeli and 436 Palestinian children have been killed. American soldiers shot and killed 15 Iraqi civilians who were demonstrating against the occupation on Saddam Hussein's birthday; a few days later another demonstration was held to protest the killings, and soldiers shot a few more. Anonymous Bush Administration officials were beginning to speak more candidly about the presidents rationale for invading Iraq, saying that Iraq's potential as a military threat was less important than its strategic location and the president's desire to make a "global showoff American power and democracy." Officials continued to play down the possibility that any significant weapons of mass destruction would be found in Iraq; one senior Whitehouse source speculated that what might turn up were some precursors," and said that Saddam Hussein "couldn't put them together as long as the inspections were going on. President Bush landed on an aircraft carrier in an S-3BViking airplane and, clad in a military jumpsuit with the words "Commander in Chief" printed on the back, he informed the assembled sailors, whom he said were "the best of our country," that the war on Iraq had been won. The commander in chief, who served as a pilot in the Texas National Guard during the Vietnam War, told reporters that he had briefly flown the airplane. "I miss flying," he said. Few publications mentioned the president's long unexplained failure to report for duty during that period, and his daring arrival was widely hailed as a "Top Gun moment." NBCofficials confirmed that Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman will both appear on a future episode of "Friends." William J. Bennett, the author of "The Book of Virtues," "The Death of Outrage," and "The Moral Compass," among other books, was revealed to be a high-stakes gambler who has blown up to$8 million over the last decade playing high-limit slot machines and video poker. Bennett acknowledged that he has never condemned the vice of gambling. Somebody tried to shoot Hugo Chavez, the president of Venezuela. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld declared that "major combat" was over in Afghanistan; Rumsfeld also made a victory tour of Iraq and was photographed autographing a Baghdad street sign that some soldiers had apparently taken as a souvenir.

Consultants concluded that the Davis-Bessenuclear reactor in Ohio, which was shut down more than a year ago after it was discovered that acid had nearly eaten through its reactor vessel, still has problems with its safety culture." Salomon Smith Barney, Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse First Boston, and several other firms agreed to a $1.4 billion settlement for fraudulently enticing millions of investors to buy billions of dollars' worth of stock they knew to be essentially worthless. Enron, MCI, and other companies that overstated their earnings in order to inflate the value of their stock were in the process of filing for hundreds of millions of dollars in tax refunds from the government on the profits they fraudulently claimed. Tom Ridge, the secretary of homeland security, acknowledged that a number of his former aides are now actively lobbying him but denied that he would be swayed by personal connections. A few days later Ridge's department announced that it was establishing ethics rules. German archaeologists working in Iraq announced that they might have found the tomb of Gilgamesh. The Bush Administration proposed giving the Central Intelligence Agency and the Pentagon the power to issue administrative subpoenas" for personal and financial information on American citizens without court approval. Attorney General John Ashcroft revealed that the Justice Department used secret warrants 1,228 times last year. The U.S. State Department complained in a report that Canadas contribution to the war on terrorism was being hampered by its obsession with civil liberties and personal privacy: Canadian laws and regulations intended to protect Canadian citizens and landed immigrants from government intrusion sometimes limit the depth of investigations." The United States Commission on Civil Rights was ordered to pay an Hispanic employee $165,000 in damages for discriminating against her. President Bush issued a proclamation declaring May 1 "Loyalty Day," and Prime Minister John Howard of Australia was rewarded for his country's service in the invasion of Iraq with a sleepover down at the Presidential Ranch in Crawford, Texas, where he was served green-chili cheese grits for supper. United Nations employees looted restaurants at the organization's headquarters in New York after food-service workers staged a wild-cat strike.

 urlLink Desiderata Go placidly amid the noise and haste And remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible without surrender, Be on good terms with all persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly and listen to others, Even the dull and ignorant; they too have their story. Avoid loud and aggressive persons; They are vexatious to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others you may become vain or bitter, For always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself. Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your career, however humble; It is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time. Exercise caution in your business affairs, For the world is full of trickery But let this not blind you to what virtue there is. Many persons strive for high ideals And everywhere life is full of heroism. Be yourself. Especially do not feign affection, Neither be cynical about love, For in the face of all aridity and disappointment It is as perennial as the grass. Take kindly the counsel of the years, Gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars. You have a right to be here. And whether it is clear to you or not, No doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. Therefore be at peace with God, Whatever you conceive him to be, And whatever your labours and aspirations in the noisy confusion of life, Keep peace with your soul. With all its sham and drudgery and broken dreams It is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful. Strive to be happy. Max Ehrman, 1927 Found in Old Saint Paul's Church, Baltimore, U.S.A. Dated 1692

 Harmony by Osho Listen to your heart, move according to your heart, whatsoever the stake: A condition of complete simplicity costing not less than everything.... To be simple is arduous, because to be simple costs everything that you have. You have to lose all to be simple.That's why people have chosen to be complex and they have forgotten how to be simple. But only a simple heart throbs with God, hand in hand. Only a simple heart sings with God in deep harmony. To reach to that point you will have to find your heart, your own throb, your own beat. Osho Dang Dang Doko Dang Chapter 3 Commentary: The experience of resting in the heart in meditation is not something that can be grasped or forced. It comes naturally, as we grow more and more in tune with the rhythms of our own inner silences. The figure on this card reflects the sweetness and delicacy of this experience. The dolphins that emerge from the heart and make an arc towards the third eye reflect the playfulness and intelligence that comes when we are able to connect with the heart and move into the world from there. Let yourself be softer and more receptive now, because an inexpressible joy is waiting for you just around the corner. Nobody else can point it out to you, and when you find it you won't be able to find the words to express it to others. But it's there, deep within your heart, ripe and ready to be discovered.

 urlLink http://www.enneagramcentral.com/ Style Four : Fours are about authenticity. Fours have a deep and wide range of emotions and trust their subjective experience to make their life-decisions. They are frequently highly esthetic (not in talent, necessarily, but in concern), because they have a highly developed ability to think symbolically. This coupled with their emotional richness cries out for artistic expression. Fours make a personal statement in many things they do, from the way they dress to their choice of Impressionist paintings. They rather enjoy not being part of the crowd and have a natural sense of aristocracy. Taste, they maintain, is not determined by votes. When they are less healthy, their speech becomes lamentation as they claim their uniqueness because of their suffering. They often develop a spirit of entitlement to compensate for a feeling that somehow they are defective. This defect, paradoxically, is the basis for their claim that they deserve love.

 urlLink Who Am I? - (Nan Yar?) As all living beings desire to be happy always, without misery, as in the case of everyone there is observed supreme love for one's self, and as happiness alone is the cause for love, in order to gain that happiness which is one's nature and which is experienced in the state of deep sleep where there is no mind, one should know one's self. For that, the path of knowledge, the inquiry of the form "Who am I?", is the principal means. 1 . Who am I ? The gross body which is composed of the seven humours (dhatus), I am not; the five cognitive sense organs, viz. the senses of hearing, touch, sight, taste, and smell, which apprehend their respective objects, viz. sound, touch, colour, taste, and odour, I am not; the five cognitive sense-organs, viz. the organs of speech, locomotion, grasping, excretion, and procreation, which have as their respective functions speaking, moving, grasping, excreting, and enjoying, I am not; the five vital airs, prana, etc., which perform respectively the five functions of in-breathing, etc., I am not; even the mind which thinks, I am not; the nescience too, which is endowed only with the residual impressions of objects, and in which there are no objects and no functioning's, I am not. 2. If I am none of these, then who am I? After negating all of the above-mentioned as 'not this', 'not this', that Awareness which alone remains - that I am. 3. What is the nature of Awareness? The nature of Awareness is existence-consciousness-bliss 4. When will the realization of the Self be gained? When the world which is what-is-seen has been removed, there will be realization of the Self which is the seer. 5. Will there not be realization of the Self even while the world is there (taken as real)? There will not be. 6. Why? The seer and the object seen are like the rope and the snake. Just as the knowledge of the rope which is the substrate will not arise unless the false knowledge of the illusory serpent goes, so the realization of the Self which is the substrate will not be gained unless the belief that the world is real is removed. 7. When will the world which is the object seen be removed? When the mind, which is the cause of all cognition's and of all actions, becomes quiescent, the world will disappear. 8. What is the nature of the mind? What is called 'mind' is a wondrous power residing in the Self. It causes all thoughts to arise. Apart from thoughts, there is no such thing as mind. Therefore, thought is the nature of mind. Apart from thoughts, there is no independent entity called the world. In deep sleep there are no thoughts, and there is no world. In the states of waking and dream, there are thoughts, and there is a world also. Just as the spider emits the thread (of the web) out of itself and again withdraws it into itself, likewise the mind projects the world out of itself and again resolves it into itself. When the mind comes out of the Self, the world appears. Therefore, when the world appears (to be real), the Self does not appear; and when the Self appears (shines) the world does not appear. When one persistently inquires into the nature of the mind, the mind will end leaving the Self (as the residue). What is referred to as the Self is the Atman. The mind always exists only in dependence on something gross; it cannot stay alone. It is the mind that is called the subtle body or the soul (jiva). 9. What is the path of inquiry for understanding the nature of the mind? That which rises as 'I' in this body is the mind. If one inquires as to where in the body the thought 'I' rises first, one would discover that it rises in the heart. That is the place of the mind's origin. Even if one thinks constantly 'I' 'I', one will be led to that place. Of all the thoughts that arise in the mind, the 'I' thought is the first. It is only after the rise of this that the other thoughts arise. It is after the appearance of the first personal pronoun that the second and third personal pronouns appear; without the first personal pronoun there will not be the second and third. 10. How will the mind become quiescent? By the inquiry 'Who am I?'. The thought 'who am I?' will destroy all other thoughts, and like the stick used for stirring the burning pyre, it will itself in the end get destroyed. Then, there will arise Self-realization. 11. What is the means for constantly holding on to the thought 'Who am I?' When other thoughts arise, one should not pursue them, but should inquire: 'To whom do they arise?' It does not matter how many thoughts arise. As each thought arises, one should inquire with diligence, "To whom has this thought arisen?". The answer that would emerge would be "To me". Thereupon if one inquires "Who am I?", the mind will go back to its source; and the thought that arose will become quiescent. With repeated practice in this manner, the mind will develop the skill to stay in its source. When the mind that is subtle goes out through the brain and the sense-organs, the gross names and forms appear; when it stays in the heart, the names and forms disappear. Not letting the mind go out, but retaining it in the Heart is what is called "inwardness" (antar-mukha). Letting the mind go out of the Heart is known as "externalisation" (bahir-mukha). Thus, when the mind stays in the Heart, the 'I' which is the source of all thoughts will go, and the Self which ever exists will shine. Whatever one does, one should do without the egoity "I". If one acts in that way, all will appear as of the nature of Siva (God). 12. Are there no other means for making the mind quiescent? Other than inquiry, there are no adequate means. If through other means it is sought to control the mind, the mind will appear to be controlled, but will again go forth. Through the control of breath also, the mind will become quiescent; but it will be quiescent only so long as the breath remains controlled, and when the breath resumes the mind also will again start moving and will wander as impelled by residual impressions. The source is the same for both mind and breath. Thought, indeed, is the nature of the mind. The thought "I" is the first thought of the mind; and that is egoity. It is from that whence egoity originates that breath also originates. Therefore, when the mind becomes quiescent, the breath is controlled, and when the breath is controlled the mind becomes quiescent. But in deep sleep, although the mind becomes quiescent, the breath does not stop. This is because of the will of God, so that the body may be preserved and other people may not be under the impression that it is dead. In the state of waking and in samadhi, when the mind becomes quiescent the breath is controlled. Breath is the gross form of mind. Till the time of death, the mind keeps breath in the body; and when the body dies the mind takes the breath along with it. Therefore, the exercise of breath-control is only an aid for rendering the mind quiescent (manonigraha); it will not destroy the mind (manonasa). Like the practice of breath-control. meditation on the forms of God, repetition of mantras, restriction on food, etc., are but aids for rendering the mind quiescent. Through meditation on the forms of God and through repetition of mantras, the mind becomes one-pointed. The mind will always be wandering. Just as when a chain is given to an elephant to hold in its trunk it will go along grasping the chain and nothing else, so also when the mind is occupied with a name or form it will grasp that alone. When the mind expands in the form of countless thoughts, each thought becomes weak; but as thoughts get resolved the mind becomes one-pointed and strong; for such a mind Self-inquiry will become easy. Of all the restrictive rules, that relating to the taking of sattvic food in moderate quantities is the best; by observing this rule, the sattvic quality of mind will increase, and that will be helpful to Self-inquiry. 13. The residual impressions (thoughts) of objects appear wending like the waves of an ocean. When will all of them get destroyed? As the meditation on the Self rises higher and higher, the thoughts will get destroyed. 14. Is it possible for the residual impressions of objects that come from beginningless time, as it were, to be resolved, and for one to remain as the pure Self? Without yielding to the doubt "Is it possible, or not?", one should persistently hold on to the meditation on the Self. Even if one be a great sinner, one should not worry and weep "O! I am a sinner, how can I be saved?"; one should completely renounce the thought "I am a sinner"; and concentrate keenly on meditation on the Self; then, one would surely succeed. There are not two minds - one good and the other evil; the mind is only one. It is the residual impressions that are of two kinds - auspicious and inauspicious. When the mind is under the influence of auspicious impressions it is called good; and when it is under the influence of inauspicious impressions it is regarded as evil. The mind should not be allowed to wander towards worldly objects and what concerns other people. However bad other people may be, one should bear no hatred for them. Both desire and hatred should be eschewed. All that one gives to others one gives to one's self. If this truth is understood who will not give to others? When one's self arises all arises; when one's self becomes quiescent all becomes quiescent. To the extent we behave with humility, to that extent there will result good. If the mind is rendered quiescent, one may live anywhere. 15. How long should inquiry be practised? As long as there are impressions of objects in the mind, so long the inquiry "Who am I?" is required. As thoughts arise they should be destroyed then and there in the very place of their origin, through inquiry. If one resorts to contemplation of the Self unintermittently, until the Self is gained, that alone would do. As long as there are enemies within the fortress, they will continue to sally forth; if they are destroyed as they emerge, the fortress will fall into our hands. 16. What is the nature of the Self? What exists in truth is the Self alone. The world, the individual soul, and God are appearances in it. like silver in mother-of-pearl, these three appear at the same time, and disappear at the same time. The Self is that where there is absolutely no "I" thought. That is called "Silence". The Self itself is the world; the Self itself is "I"; the Self itself is God; all is Siva, the Self. 17. Is not everything the work of God? Without desire, resolve, or effort, the sun rises; and in its mere presence, the sun-stone emits fire, the lotus blooms, water evaporates; people perform their various functions and then rest. Just as in the presence of the magnet the needle moves, it is by virtue of the mere presence of God that the souls governed by the three (cosmic) functions or the fivefold divine activity perform their actions and then rest, in accordance with their respective karmas. God has no resolve; no karma attaches itself to Him. That is like worldly actions not affecting the sun, or like the merits and demerits of the other four elements not affecting all pervading space. 18. Of the devotees, who is the greatest? He who gives himself up to the Self that is God is the most excellent devotee. Giving one's self up to God means remaining constantly in the Self without giving room for the rise of any thoughts other than that of the Self. Whatever burdens are thrown on God, He bears them. Since the supreme power of God makes all things move, why should we, without submitting ourselves to it, constantly worry ourselves with thoughts as to what should be done and how, and what should not be done and how not? We know that the train carries all loads, so after getting on it why should we carry our small luggage on our head to our discomfort, instead of putting it down in the train and feeling at ease? 19. What is non-attachment? As thoughts arise, destroying them utterly without any residue in the very place of their origin is non-attachment. Just as the pearl-diver ties a stone to his waist, sinks to the bottom of the sea and there takes the pearls, so each one of us should be endowed with non-attachment, dive within oneself and obtain the Self-Pearl. 20. Is it not possible for God and the Guru to effect the release of a soul? God and the Guru will only show the way to release; they will not by themselves take the soul to the state of release. In truth, God and the Guru are not different. Just as the prey which has fallen into the jaws of a tiger has no escape, so those who have come within the ambit of the Guru's gracious look will be saved by the Guru and will not get lost; yet, each one should by his own effort pursue the path shown by God or Guru and gain release. One can know oneself only with one's own eye of knowledge, and not with somebody else's. Does he who is Rama require the help of a mirror to know that he is Rama? 21. Is it necessary for one who longs for release to inquire into the nature of categories (tattvas)? Just as one who wants to throw away garbage has no need to analyse it and see what it is, so one who wants to know the Self has no need to count the number of categories or inquire into their characteristics; what he has to do is to reject altogether the categories that hide the Self. The world should be considered like a dream. 22. Is there no difference between waking and dream? Waking is long and a dream short; other than this there is no difference. Just as waking happenings seem real while awake. so do those in a dream while dreaming. In dream the mind takes on another body. In both waking and dream states thoughts. names and forms occur simultaneously. 23. Is it any use reading books for those who long for release? All the texts say that in order to gain release one should render the mind quiescent; therefore their conclusive teaching is that the mind should be rendered quiescent; once this has been understood there is no need for endless reading. In order to quieten the mind one has only to inquire within oneself what one's Self is; how could this search be done in books? One should know one's Self with one's own eye of wisdom. The Self is within the five sheaths; but books are outside them. Since the Self has to be inquired into by discarding the five sheaths, it is futile to search for it in books. There will come a time when one will have to forget all that one has learned. 24. What is happiness? Happiness is the very nature of the Self; happiness and the Self are not different. There is no happiness in any object of the world. We imagine through our ignorance that we derive happiness from objects. When the mind goes out, it experiences misery. In truth, when its desires are fulfilled, it returns to its own place and enjoys the happiness that is the Self. Similarly, in the states of sleep, samadhi and fainting, and when the object desired is obtained or the object disliked is removed, the mind becomes inward-turned, and enjoys pure Self-Happiness. Thus the mind moves without rest alternately going out of the Self and returning to it. Under the tree the shade is pleasant; out in the open the heat is scorching. A person who has been going about in the sun feels cool when he reaches the shade. Someone who keeps on going from the shade into the sun and then back into the shade is a fool. A wise man stays permanently in the shade. Similarly, the mind of the one who knows the truth does not leave Brahman. The mind of the ignorant, on the contrary, revolves in the world, feeling miserable, and for a little time returns to Brahman to experience happiness. In fact, what is called the world is only thought. When the world disappears, i.e. when there is no thought, the mind experiences happiness; and when the world appears, it goes through misery. 25. What is wisdom-insight (jnana-drsti)? Remaining quiet is what is called wisdom-insight. To remain quiet is to resolve the mind in the Self. Telepathy, knowing past, present and future happenings and clairvoyance do not constitute wisdom-insight. 26. What is the relation between desirelessness and wisdom? Desirelessness is wisdom. The two are not different; they are the same. Desirelessness is refraining from turning the mind towards any object. Wisdom means the appearance of no object. In other words, not seeking what is other than the Self is detachment or desirelessness; not leaving the Self is wisdom. 27. What is the difference between inquiry and meditation? Inquiry consists in retaining the mind in the Self. Meditation consists in thinking that one's self is Brahman, existence-consciousness-bliss. 28. What is release? Inquiring into the nature of one's self that is in bondage, and realising one's true nature is release. SRI RAMANARPANAM ASTU

 urlLink BBC NEWS | South Asia | Sanskrit struggles to survive Monday, 5 August, 2002, 12:51 GMT 13:51 UK Students say Sanskrit offers no job prospects By Sanjeev Srivastava BBC correspondent in Bombay One of the oldest languages in the world, Sanskrit, is in danger of becoming extinct in India, the country of its origin. Although most Indian languages still use the basic grammar of Sanskrit, no more than a few thousand people in a country of more than one billion can claim to read, write and speak it fluently. What was once the language of the elite in ancient India, Sanskrit no longer enjoys the exalted status it once had. Poor job prospects In Bombay's Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, one of the city's oldest and biggest education institutions. students recite Sanskrit shlokas. We, at our own level, want to be refined, to be cultured, to be a better person and this is here, we need Sanskrit Sanskrit scholar Girish Jani Only 150 students come here to learn this ancient language - a very small number if you compare it with the tens of thousands of students who go out every day to the city's schools and colleges. So why are so few students coming to learn Sanskrit? The school's principal, Narendra Kumar Singh says there are very few jobs for anyone studying Sanskrit. Some get jobs as priests "At most, they can become a teacher in Sanskrit schools, Sanskrit colleges so their salaries are also very meagre." "The other opportunity for them is to perform [religious] rituals for some rich people," he added. Lacking relevance? The other reason why Sanskrit is losing out is because it was never really the language of the masses. It was the language of the elite used for correspondence amongst royalty and for composing classic prose and poetry. There are some who opt for Sanskrit because it is regarded as a subject in which one can get high grades and can help improve one's overall grades. But most students learn the language to know about the past. Some study Sanskrit to improve their grades. There is a school of thought which believes that teaching and learning Sanskrit is a complete waste of time and resources, especially as most Sanskrit colleges are publicly funded. Critics of Sanskrit say government-funded colleges should be preparing students for the real world and offer only vocational and employment-oriented courses. However, Sanskrit scholars like Girish Jani rubbish this approach. "Why should we read Shakespeare? Why should we read Sartre? Are they connected really with the life in the first attempt? No. "We, at our own level, want to be refined, to be cultured, to be a better person and this is here, we need Sanskrit." Scholars like Mr Jani do have a point and there is logic in their argument about Sanskrit being a language of cultural refinement, But the sad reality is that Sanskrit is fighting a losing battle in the country of its origin.

 urlLink NASA researcher, Rick Briggs has written: "In ancient India the intention to discover truth was so consuming, that in the process, they discovered perhaps the most perfect tool for fulfilling such a search that the world has ever known -- the Sanskrit language. There is at least one language, Sanskrit, which for the duration of almost 1000 years was a living spoken language with a considerable literature of its own. Besides works of literary value, there was a long philosophical and grammatical tradition that has continued to exist with undiminished vigor until the present century. Among the accomplishments of the grammarians can be reckoned a method for paraphrasing Sanskrit in a manner that is identical not only in essence but in form with current work in Artificial Intelligence. This article demonstrates that a natural language can serve as an artificial language also, and that much work in AI has been reinventing a wheel millennia old. The discovery is of monumental significance. It is mind-boggling to consider that we have available to us a language which has been spoken for 4-7000 years that appears to be in every respect a perfect language designed for enlightened communication. But the most stunning aspect of the discovery is this: NASA the most advanced research center in the world for cutting edge technology has discovered that Sanskrit, the world's oldest spiritual language is the only unambiguous spoken language on the planet. Considering Sanskrit's status as a spiritual language, a further implication of this discovery is that the age old dichotomy between religion and science is an entirely unjustified one. It is also relevant to note that in the last decade physicists have begun to comment on the striking similarities between their own discoveries and the discoveries made thousands of years ago in India which went on to form the basis of most Eastern religions. Why has Sanskrit endured? Fundamentally it generates clarity and inspiration. And that clarity and inspiration is directly responsible for a brilliance of creative expression such as the world has rarely seen. Another hope for the return of Sanskrit lies in computers. Sanskrit and computers are a perfect fit. The precision play of Sanskrit with computer tools will awaken the capacity in human beings to utilize their innate higher mental faculty with a momentum that would inevitably transform the world. In fact the mere learning of Sanskrit by large numbers of people in itself represents a quantum leap in consciousness, not to mention the rich endowment it will provide in the arena of future communication." (source: Knowledge Representation in Sanskrit and Artificial Intelligence - By Rick Briggs Artificial Intelligence Magazine 6(1) 32-39 1985).

 urlLink Osho Zen Tarot -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sharing As you move above to the fourth center - that is the heart - your whole life becomes a sharing of love. The third center has created the abundance of love. By reaching to the third center in meditation, you have become so overflowing with love, with compassion, and you want to share. It happens at the fourth center, the heart. That's why even in the ordinary world people think love comes out of the heart. For them it is just hearsay, they have heard it; they don't know it because they have never reached to their heart. But the meditator finally reaches to the heart. As he has reached to the center of his being - the third center - suddenly an explosion of love and compassion and joy and blissfulness and benediction has arisen in him with such a force that it hits his heart and opens the heart. The heart is just in the middle of all your seven centers - three centers below, three centers above. You have come exactly to the middle. Commentary: The Queen of Fire is so rich, so much a queen, that she can afford to give. It doesn't even occur to her to take inventories or to put something aside for later. She dispenses her treasures without limits, welcoming all and sundry to partake of the abundance, fertility and light that surrounds her. When you draw this card, it suggests that you too are in a situation where you have an opportunity to share your love, your joy and your laughter. And in sharing, you find that you feel even more full. There is no need to go anywhere or to make any special effort. You find that you can enjoy sensuality without possessiveness or attachment, can give birth to a child or to a new project with an equal sense of creativity fulfilled. Everything around you seems to be "coming together" now. Enjoy it, ground yourself in it, and let the abundance in you and around you overflow.

 urlLink Osho Zen Tarot - Courage The seed cannot know what is going to happen, the seed has never known the flower. And the seed cannot even believe that he has the potentiality to become a beautiful flower. Long is the journey, and it is always safer not to go on that journey because unknown is the path, nothing is guaranteed. Nothing can be guaranteed. Thousand and one are the hazards of the journey, many are the pitfalls - and the seed is secure, hidden inside a hard core. But the seed tries, it makes an effort; it drops the hard shell which is its security, it starts moving. Immediately the fight starts: the struggle with the soil, with the stones, with the rocks. And the seed was very hard and the sprout will be very, very soft and dangers will be many. There was no danger for the seed, the seed could have survived for millennia, but for the sprout many are the dangers. But the sprout starts towards the unknown, towards the sun, towards the source of light, not knowing where, not knowing why. Great is the cross to be carried, but a dream possesses the seed and the seed moves. The same is the path for man. It is arduous. Much courage will be needed. Commentary: This card shows a small wildflower that has met the challenge of the rocks and stones in its path to emerge into the light of day. Surrounded by an aura of bright golden light, it exposes the majesty of its tiny self. Unashamed, it is equal to the brightest sun. When we are faced with a very difficult situation we have a choice: we can either be resentful, and try to find somebody or something to blame for the hardships, or we can face the challenge and grow. The flower shows us the way, as its passion for life leads it out of the darkness and into the light. There is no point fighting against the challenges of life, or trying to avoid or deny them. They are there, and if the seed is to become the flower we must go through them. Be courageous enough to grow into the flower you are meant to be.

 urlLink A glimpse into the heart of a dying star - Behind the scenes at a stellar chemical factory : An image taken with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope shows one of the most unusually long planetary nebulae found so far. Scientists think planetary nebulae hold the key to understanding how the Universe became enriched with heavier elements so they study them intensively. It is not well-understood how a perfectly round star can turn into such an unusual-looking nebula. {Apply this concept to people.} Planetary nebulae occur in a huge variety of shapes and sizes. They are the final stage of a star's life before it ends its days as a burnt-out white dwarf. When it dies, a star rapidly sheds the outer parts of its atmosphere, creating a planetary nebula that exists only as long as the star has fuel to burn. {Apply this concept to people.} Stars are large recycling factories. Over their lifetimes of millions of years they process huge amounts of the lighter elements (mostly hydrogen and helium) {apply this concept to people} into heavier ones (such as carbon, nitrogen and oxygen) {apply this concept to people} . These heavier elements are then dispersed into the surrounding space when the stars peel off their atmospheres to form planetary nebulae. In turn, the heavier elements may become part of other stars or end up in planetary systems like our own Solar System. This dispersion process is therefore one of the most important in the Universe and can tell us something about our own origins. {Apply this concept to people.}

On a recent sunny afternoon, the van held a load of llama manure bound for the vegetable beds at his Beacon Hill home, and a slant-6 engine Jacobs will install in another of his vehicles, a '63 Dart. And there was a Toyota engine in there, too. (Jacobs is partial to old Dodges and Toyotas. He also owns a banged-up Toyota pickup he bought for 50 bucks. He replaced the timing chain and has since driven the truck clear across the country.) The van is unusual in that it has double doors on both sides, which makes loading and unloading stuff like llama manure and slant-6 engines a heck of a lot easier. And then there are the unusual duties it has served in its 33 years. One previous owner made modifications to accommodate a wheelchair-using family member. And back when the van was new it was an animal control truck. "I don't think they called it that back then," Jacobs said. "I think they called it the dog-catcher van. It was up in the San Juan Islands; I think that's why it has the rust." In the three or four years he has owned it, Jacobs, an auto mechanic by training, has rebuilt the engine and the transmission. "It was so much work getting it out, I figured I would do it all," he said. "I'm not going to tell you how much money I've put into it," he said, but he did allow that sending the radiator out to be re-cored set him back nearly as much as he paid for the van. "I found the van on the Internet," Jacobs said. "This guy wanted $400 for it. The picture looked so good, but when I got there it looked like (bleep!)." So Jacobs bargained the price down. "I paid $300 for the van and $250 to have the radiator rebuilt," he said. "They don't sell these anymore, so I had to have it rebuilt." Jacobs, who will turn 34 this year, is thinking of getting out of the wrench-turning trade ("I don't know if I'll keep doing this kind of work," he said), but his skills make feasible owning and operating vehicles as old or older than he is. And while he acknowledges that the van isn't in great shape, he has no interest in parting with it. "There's no way I could ever sell it and get back what I've put into it," he said. That rebuilt engine certainly sounds healthy, but Jacobs admits the van doesn't run as well as it could. "It would be nice to say that," he said. "It doesn't run perfect, but it gets the job done."

 urlLink Impossible Dream : To dream the impossible dream To fight the unbeatable foe To bear with unbearable sorrow And to run where the brave dare not go To right the unrightable wrong And to love pure and chaste from afar To try when your arms are too weary To reach the unreachable star This is my quest To follow that star No matter how hopeless No matter how far To fight for the right Without question or pause To be willing to march, march into hell For that heavenly cause And I know If I'll only be true To this glorious quest That my heart Will lie peaceful and calm When I'm laid to my rest And the world will be better for this That one man, scorned and covered with scars, Still strove with his last ounce of courage To reach the unreachable, the unreachable, The unreachable star And I'll always dream The impossible dream Yes, and I'll reach The unreachable star.

 This is a review written by Daniel. CD Hotlist is a great source for music reviews. urlLink CD HOTLIST: NEW RELEASES FOR LIBRARIES Artist: Annie Lennox Title: BARE Label: J Records Cat. #: 8287652072-2 Genre: Pop/Rock Release type: New List price: $18.98 Comments: It has been 11 years since Annie Lennox's first solo album and four years since the short-lived Eurythmics reunion. She has returned with a set of self-penned songs that incisively explore the heartbreak and hope of love and relationships. Her voice sounds just as formidable as ever and is really something to behold on this disc. She provides all of the vocals, and hearing Annie Lennox back up Annie Lennox can be breathtaking. Framing the vocals are pop hooks, electric guitar, soul (of the Motown variety) and electronic soundscapes. This is an incredibly moving disc, best appreciated straight through, as the songs join to carry the listener on quite an emotional journey. (DB)

 The application of synchronicity is based on the strategy that looking for the meaning in coincidental events is more pragmatic than striving to predict things according to notions of causality, surmised from statistical records. Einstein once said that "time is what a clock measures." urlLink A question for the layman: Recently, astronomers have found that, not only is the universe expanding (But wait! There is no "outside" of the universe!), the rate of expansion is accelerating. Now, if we choose two distant galaxies as our reference length, then not only is matter shrinking with respect to this reference, its rate of shrinkage should be accelerating. Whenever an object accelerates there is an associated force.... Can we detect the expanding universe locally? Have you ever seen an apple fall to the earth?

 urlLink I-Ching.com :: Oracle of Changes : "Limits are necessary to give purpose and direction to life. Swimming in a sea of boundless opportunity would soon lead to exhaustion. Winging it alone in a sky of boundless opportunity would lead to being lost. In human affairs, the making of choices, and alliances, implies limitation, for in choosing one path another must be abandoned. One key to a successful life is to select your limits consciously and carefully - to be discriminating in the setting of personal boundaries and knowing when to join in formation. Thrift, for example, often precedes prosperity; just as the letting go of selfish interests often leads to greater personal reward. Only by consciously accepting useful limits can one's energy be channeled to good purpose, and lead to lasting accomplishment. Point yourself toward a middle way, the mean between discipline and freedom of spirit. Limits will come of their own accord; but to be able to consciously select your own affiliations in life - that's knowing how to fly! At the same time, do not go overboard on discipline. Even limitation must be limited, so that in attempting to bring order and direction into your life you do not choke off vital sources of enthusiasm and spontaneity. Similarly, in groups and organizations, the rules and regulations should strike a balance between being too strict and too soft. If too strict, they build frustration among people, and ultimately become destructive. If too lenient, sloppiness becomes acceptable, and energy is soon dissipated. The best path is one which allows for the fulfillment of individual potential, while encouraging self-discipline and focus."

 urlLink Be My Tongue : "Cymothoa exigua, a crustacean, makes its home inside the mouth of a fish. It makes itself so much at home, in fact, that it actually removes, than takes over the duties of, its host's tongue. The parasite does not actually bite off the host's existing tongue. It does, however, suck enough blood from it that the organ shrivels-up and atrophies. The parasite then employs hooks on its underside to attach itself to the remaining stub. Consequently, the host is able to use it as a replacement tongue for food manipulation, allowing the host to eat as usual. C. exiqua grabs a meal from the particles that float free as the fish eats." urlLink Somebody wrote a play based on this concept. There are so many interesting things in life.

 Here's what the doctor says I have - ACUTE BRONCHITIS Bronchitis is an inflammation of the bronchial tubes, or bronchi (the air passages that extend from the windpipe into the lungs). The inflammation may be caused by a virus, bacteria, smoking or the inhalation of chemical pollutants or dust. When the cells of the bronchial-lining tissue are irritated beyond a certain point, the tiny hairs (cilia) within them, which normally trap and eliminate pollutants, stop functioning. Consequently, the air passages become clogged by debris and irritation increases. In response, a heavy secretion of mucus develops, which causes the characteristic cough of bronchitis. Acute bronchitis usually lasts about 10 days. Severe cases may also cause general malaise and chest pain.

 I'm getting ready to quit smoking. I woke up at 5 am with tremendous pain in my lungs. I think this cold I have is intensified by 18 years of sucking tar and chemicals into my body.

 urlLink Alexandria, Egypt The second largest city and the main port of Egypt , Alexandria was built by the Greek architect Dinocrates (332-331 BC) on the site of an old village, Rhakotis, at the orders of Alexander the Great . The city, immortalizing Alexander's name, quickly flourished into a prominent cutural, intellectual , political, and economic metropolis, the remains of which are still evident to this day. It was the renowned capital of the Ptolemies , with numerous monuments. It was the site of the Lighthouse , one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World , as well as the Great Library . It was along these shores that history took a tragic turn at the time of Cleopatra , Julius Caesar , Mark Antony , and Octavian. Alexandria lies north-west of the Nile delta and stretches along a narrow land strip between the Mediterranean Sea and Lake Mariut (Mareotis). It is linked to Cairo by two major highways and a railroad line. It is one of the most notable summer resorts in the Middle East , for, in addition to its temperate winters, its beaches, with white sands and magnificent scenery, stretch for 140 km along the Mediterranean Sea , from Abu Qir , in the east to Al-Alamein and Sidi Abdul Rahman, in the west.

 The contemplation for this week is: "An artist uses color to paint different forms on canvas: cows and tigers, rivers and mountains, houses and trees.

Everything that exists is for giving satisfaction to the inner Self." -- Swami Muktananda

 urlLink Guru's Gallery : "Once we know the particular shop from which we can purchase all our requirements, why should we wander among all the shops in the market? It is a waste of time and is of no use. In the same way, if we have found a Guru, we should stop wandering and do sadhana, striving to reach the goal. The Guru himself will come to the seeker. There is no need to wander in search of him, but the seeker should have intense dispassion towards the world. A Guru is indespensible for a sadhak (aspirant). If a child goes near the edge of a pond, the mother points out the danger and leads the child away. In like manner, the Guru gives appropriate instructions when necessary. His attention is always on the disciple. Even though God is all-pervading, a Guru's presence is unique. Even though the wind blows everywhere, we enjoy coolness only under the shade of a tree. Doesn't the breeze that blows through the leaves of a tree have a soothing effect on those who travel in the hot sun? Similarly, a Guru is necessary for us who live in the scorching heat of worldly existence. The Guru's presence will give us peace and tranquillity. A real Guru desires only the spiritual growth of the disciple. Tests and trials are given for the disciple's improvement and to remove his weaknesses. A Guru may even blame a disciple for errors he has not committed. Only those who steadily withstand such trials can grow. Even though one may come in contact with a Guru, he will be accepted as a disciple only if he is fit. Without Guru's grace, one cannot know the Guru. One who is really in search of the Truth will have humility and simplicity. The Guru's grace will be showered only on such a person. A person full of ego cannot have access to the Guru." -- Mata Amritanandamayi, For My Children, San Ramon, CA: Mata Amritanandamayi Center, 1994

 urlLink Osho Zen Tarot : 23. The Creator There are two types of creators in the world. One type of creator works with objects - a poet, a painter, they work with objects, they create things. The other type of creator, the mystic, creates himself. He doesn't work with objects, he works with the subject; he works on himself, his own being. And he is the real creator, the real poet, because he makes himself into a masterpiece. You are carrying a masterpiece hidden within you, but you are standing in the way. Just move aside, then the masterpiece will be revealed. Everyone is a masterpiece, because God never gives birth to anything less than that. Everyone carries that masterpiece hidden for many lives, no knowing who they are and just trying on the surface to become someone. Drop the idea of becoming someone, because you are already a masterpiece. You cannot be improved. You have only to come to it, to know it, to realize it. God himself has created you; you cannot be improved. Osho Ah, This! Chapter 1

 urlLink Free I-Ching Reading : "Increase and decrease are part of the natural cycle of life. As another good book puts it, 'To every thing there is a season, and a time for every purpose under heaven.' Like a reservoir that is being used to irrigate the fields, learning to accept a decrease in position or material possessions is part of preparing for increase in the future. We may live in materialistic times, but there is no disgrace in material decrease, particularly if it represents an investment in future gain - even if that gain be in the form of learning or the development of personal character. Likewise, the inner strength that comes from bearing loss can be balanced by a corresponding increase in inner strength and insight. When letting go of material desires leads to a greater simplicity in daily life, good fortune often comes calling. In nature, the lake evaporates to form the clouds that drop the rain which nurtures the surrounding forest. As the forest grows thick, more rain is captured for the lake. Similarly, an 'evaporation' or decrease in one area of your life, may give rise to an eventual increase. A loss of responsibility at work can mean more free time; more free time may generate more career options. A decrease in material possessions can free the spirit and fill the soul. Be mindful of the lesson of young lovers: even with a minimum of possessions, feelings of the heart can bring an unsurpassed richness to life. The smallest of actions, if sincere, have value. So remain confident, for a time of decrease may actually bode good fortune. Especially if you remain open to that possibility. Let go of frustration, resistance and regret over whatever may be decreasing at this time. Accept the cycle."

 Realization: The Poori Effect: How We Sometimes Fool Ourselves Just seated in an Indian vegetarian buffet restaurant with a friend, a beaming waitress comes along, "Poori or nan (traditional flour-based foods)?" I replied "Two nans please." She remarked enthusiastically, "Oh, would you like to try the poori?" "No." She smiled on, "They are very nice. Have you tried them before? You should try!" I smiled weakly, "Okay one poori and one nan." I tried poori before, but prefer nan. But she was so unknowingly pushy that I patronised her. She walked by later, saw the empty plate, and asked, once again, beaming happily, "Was the poori nice?" My friend smiled sheepishly and gave a weak nod. She too prefers nan. The waitress smiles back, moving off to serve another "happy" customer. I call this "The Poori Effect." It is the unmindful shaping of the world according to one's perceptions. The waitress already made up her mind as to what we should try before asking- her favourite. Due to the way she carried herself, we "naturally obliged". We were later "obliged" to give her a positive response- out of "courtesy". The result was a totally deluded idea of our opinion of poori. We might have made her day in the worldly sense, but at the expense of reinforcing her delusion. We sometimes "unwittingly" mirror the world - the world smiles and we smile back. But is your smile true? On the other hand, is your smiling "forcing" the world to smile back reluctantly or genuinely? We see what we want to see. I know friends who seemingly get along well with others, who ironically talk behind their backs. The Poori Effect is a case of two-way hypocrisy- bad faith. We are at times not mindfully sincere enough to discover how the world truly feels about us and present ourselves in a way that will not receive negative feedback. This is hypocrisy to oneself and others, even though there might be some genuine goodwill within. When we patronise in return, giving positive feedback which is ungenuine, it is hypocrisy too. Either way, anyone being hypocritical is being untrue. Can we learn to speak true and wise words, about what we feel, in a kind way? Even if the truth bites a little, does it matter? Since it is "sugar-coated" with kindness, the truth should be more digestible, right? Asking is hypocritical, to oneself and others, if you do so with an answer in mind. Some even cling on to the answer in their mind when they receive an answer they do not like. "No no, what does he know? Pooris are the best!" Do you stop to reflect that the world does not have the same perception as you? But what is the truth about preferences and opinions? Preferences are about personal likes and dislikes (feelings that arise from attachment and aversion) that arise with our clouded perception- and the Buddha says that feelings and perceptions are illusory. Because we do not see things as they truly are (have wrong perception), we develop feelings of wanting to hold or reject. Everything changes fleetingly in the moment, some noticeable, some less. Pooris might taste much better if I let go of my aversion? Nans might be just as good to the waitress if she lets go of hers? Let us cultivate a mind with greater equanamity - a calm and balanced mental state uncluttered by likes and dislikes. The more equanimous the mind is, the more sincere one is to oneself and others. When we ask a question for opinion with an equanimous state of mind, we are able to more accurately receive and analyse the answers others give objectively. This is crucial to both worldly and spiritual discernment. Only so can we realise the truth in its entire spectrum, from pooris to nans, to understanding ourselves and the world at large - leading to Enlightenment! - urlLink shian@TheDailyEnlightenment.com

 urlLink Rakhi Day Meaning from the India Heritage Research Foundation "The holiday of Rakhsha Bandhan, or Rakhi, is a celebration of the bond of love and the bond of family. On this day, sisters tie sacred threads around their brothers' wrists, symbolizing their love and affection. In return, the brother promises to protect his sister and to always be there for her. Rakhsha means protection or security and bandhan means a bond or relation. Thus, Rakhsha Bandhan symbolizes the bond of security and protection between brothers and sisters. However, on Rakhi, the brothers and sisters do not have to be blood relatives. That is the beauty of Indian culture. Our tradition tells us that the world is our brother and sister. As the dawn breaks on the new millennium, we must realize that the only way the world will survive is united as one family. Thus, now, we must also take the deeper, underlying meaning of Rakhi. We must vow to make the world our brothers and sisters not only in theory, but also in practice. Let us use rakhi as a symbol of our universal brotherhood. May our girls and women lead the way toward this universal family as they tie rakhi bracelets on the wrists of not only their closest male friends, but also on the wrists of enemies. Let us use this holiday to reach out to those around us, embracing them as brother and sister."

 urlLink Osho Zen Tarot Card: Laziness "When you are lazy, it is a negative taste: you simply feel that you have no energy, you simply feel dull; you simply feel sleepy, you simply feel dead.

You are radiant, bubbling, vibrating, You are not sleepy, you are perfectly aware. You are not dead--you are tremendously alive....There is a possibility the mind can deceive you: it can rationalize laziness as non-doing. It can say, 'I have become a Zen master,' or, 'I believe in Tao'--but you are not deceiving anybody else. You will be deceiving only yourself. So be alert.

He hasn't yet turned to see the mirror cracking around him on his right, a sure sign that the place he thinks he's finally arrived at is about to shatter and dissolve before his very eyes. The message this card brings is that this poolside resort is not your final destination. The journey isn't over yet, as that white bird flying into the vastness of the sky is trying to show.

 urlLink Grof Transpersonal Training - What is holotropic breathwork? : "Holotropic Breathwork is a powerful approach to self-exploration and healing that integrates insights from modern consciousness research, anthropology, various depth psychologies, transpersonal psychology, Eastern spiritual practices, and mystical traditions of the world. The name Holotropic means literally 'moving toward wholeness' (from the Greek 'holos'=whole and 'trepein'=moving in the direction of something). The process itself uses very simple means: it combines accelerated breathing with evocative music in a special set and setting. With the eyes closed and lying on a mat, each person uses their own breath and the music in the room to enter a non-ordinary state of consciousness. This state activates the natural inner healing process of the individual's psyche, bringing him or her a particular set of internal experiences. With the inner healing intelligence guiding the process, the quality and content brought forth is unique to each person and for that particular time and place. While recurring themes are common, no two sessions are ever alike. Additional elements of the process include focused energy release work and mandala drawing. Holotropic Breathwork is usually done in groups, although individual sessions are also possible. Within the groups, people work in pairs and alternate in the roles of experiencer and 'sitter'. The sitter's role is simply to be available to assist the breather, not to interfere or interrupt the process. The same is true for trained facilitators, who are available as helpers if necessary."

 Today's Cancer Horoscope by Astrocenter.com : Today, dear Cancer, is a day to separate the wheat from the chaff. Or, in other words, to take a good long look at your relationships and decide who is a true friend and who is not. You are very loyal, which is certainly to your credit. But what is the point of being loyal to people who do not return the courtesy? You have given your so-called friends more than enough opportunities to demonstrate their affection. As difficult as it may be for you, it is time to let these relationships fall by the wayside. Look at it this way: this will free you up to spend more time with your true friends. by Tarot.com : The primary issue in your life comes back to a recurring theme. What do you feel in your gut? And how does this differ from what you need to do in order to maintain your own stability? Its a variation on the head versus heart stuff. The feelings are clearly telling you one thing, but logic pushes you in a slightly different direction.

 urlLink The Transformation Tarot : "A king went into his garden and found wilted and dying trees, shrubs and flowers. The oak said it was dying because it could not be tall like the pine. Turning to the pine, he found it drooping because it was unable to bear grapes like the vine. And the vine was dying because it could not blossom like the rose. He found Heart's-ease blooming and as fresh as ever. Upon inquiry, he received this reply: 'I took it for granted that when you planted me you wanted Heart's-ease. If you had desired an oak, a vine or a rose, you would have planted them. So I thought that since you put me here, I should do the best I can to be what you want. I can be nothing but what I am, and I am trying to be that to the best of my ability.' You are here because this existence needs you as you are. Otherwise somebody else would have been here!--existence would not have helped you to be here, would not have created you. You are fulfilling something very essential, something very fundamental, as you are. If God wanted a Buddha he could have produced as many Buddhas as he wanted. He produced only one Buddha--that was enough, and he was satisfied to his heart's desire, utterly satisfied. Since then he has not produced another Buddha or another Christ. He has created you instead. Just think of the respect that the universe has given to you! You have been chosen, not Buddha, not Christ, not Krishna. You will be needed more, that's why. You fit more now. Their work is done, they contributed their fragrance to existence. Now you have to contribute your fragrance. But the moralists, the puritans, the priests, they go on teaching you, they go on driving you crazy. They say to the rose, 'Become a lotus.' And they say to the lotus, 'What are you doing here? You have to become something else." They drive the whole garden crazy, everything starts dying--because nobody can be anybody else, that is not possible. That's what has happened to humanity. Everybody is pretending. Authenticity is lost, truth is lost, everybody is trying to show that he is somebody else. Just look at yourself: you are pretending to be somebody else. And you can be only yourself--there is no other way, there has never been, there is no possibility that you can be anybody else. You will remain yourself. You can enjoy it and bloom, or you can wither away if you condemn it."

 urlLink Weekly Review - Sep 9, 2003: Harper's Magazine President George W. Bush made a televised address to the nation and declared that Iraq was now the "central front" in the war on terrorism. He called for national resolve and national sacrifice and said that he will ask Congress for $87 billion in emergency funds for the occupation. It was noted that this new request, which comes on top of $79 billion already approved, will probably push the current budget deficit up to $600 billion. Howard Dean said the speech, which made no mention of Osama bin Laden, was "outrageous" and said it reminded him of Lyndon Johnson and the Vietnam War. Senator Bob Graham observed that Bush now wants to spend more on Iraq this year than the federal government will spend on education. Gunmen fired on a Sunni mosque in Baghdad just after morning prayers and injured three people, a car bomb exploded near the headquarters of the Baghdad police department, a British bomb squad expert was killed, an American Humvee was blown up, and Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez said that attacks on American forces were down to about 14 or 15 a day. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who was touring Iraq and Afghanistan, complained that the news media was ignoring "the story of success and accomplishment" in Iraq. Rumsfeld acknowledged that he still doesn't know who is carrying out the guerrilla attacks but said that the intelligence community is working on it. "They're not comfortable at the moment with what we don't know." A man died and several others were injured while riding Disneyland's Big Thunder Mountain Railroad. The World Council of Churches denounced the invasion of Iraq as "immoral" and "ill advised" and called for the withdrawal of American forces. A congressional study found that the occupation of Iraq is unsustainable given the current size of the U.S. military, and the United States released a draft resolution calling on the United Nations to create a multinational peacekeeping force for Iraq that would remain under American military and political control. Heavy fighting continued in Afghanistan, and surface-to-air missiles were fired at a transport plane in Baghdad. Donald Rumsfeld, who was nearby, said that such attacks are just a cost of doing business. Rumsfeld claimed that there has been "breathtaking" progress in Afghanistan since the war ended. "I'm not being Pollyannaish," he said. "I'm telling the truth." President Bush, apparently worried about the fact that the American economy has lost almost 3 million jobs since he took office, promised to appoint a "manufacturing czar" who will watch out for blue-collar jobs. The Labor Department announced that 93,000 jobs were lost in August, and a new study found that the federal workforce is at its highest level (12.1 million) since the Cold War. The Census Department reported that the number of poor people increased last year by 1.3 million. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission announced a settlement with energy companies that benefited from market manipulation in the California energy crisis two years ago. The companies agreed to pay about $1 million in fines, or about 3 cents for every Californian, though the energy scam cost the state $8.9 billion, or $250 per citizen. The Environmental Protection Agency relaxed restrictions on selling land contaminated with PCBs, and an astronomer argued that Venus once had a climate similar to Earth's, prior to its transformation by the greenhouse effect. A federal appeals court blocked the FCC's new rules expanding the freedom of media monopolies, and Jessica Lynch, the former Army private who was captured by Iraqis and became the subject of an elaborate heroic fiction, signed a book deal and reportedly received a $1 million advance. Lynch will share the advance with her co-author Rick Bragg, a former New York Times reporter. Seattle was considering a tax on espresso. North Koreans danced in the streets holding bunches of flowers to celebrate the reelection of Kim Jong Il as chairman of the National Defense Commission, his primary office; Kim Il Sung, who has been dead for almost ten years, is still officially the head of state. The Bush Administration retreated from its position that North Korea must simply submit to American demands; one State Department source said that the policy shift was accomplished while many of the Pentagon officials who have driven the administration's hard-line stance were on vacation. There were rumors of a coup plot in the Philippines. The Coptic Orthodox Church of Egypt condemned gay marriage. An Israeli commission of inquiry concluded that police used excessive force in putting down a riot by Israeli Arabs three years ago in which 13 people were killed. The commission suggested that the police stop using snipers armed with rubber-coated steel bullets to disperse Arab crowds. Three Israeli F-15 fighter jets piloted by the descendants of Holocaust survivors flew over the Auschwitz death camp in Poland during a memorial service. The Auschwitz Museum had opposed the flyover, saying that a military display was inappropriate on such an occasion. Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian prime minister, resigned, and Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the spiritual leader of Hamas, was injured in an Israeli airstrike.

Interrogators at Camp Delta, the American penal colony in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, were said to be using Twinkies and McDonald's Happy Meals to make the prisoners talk.

 The contemplation for this week is: What is the key to self-trust? Self-acknowledgement, self-acknowledgment, self-acknowledgment. How would it affect your state if, each time you came through on a promise or duty or performed some beneficial action, you took the time to acknowledge yourself? What if you take a moment and thank yourself? Become sensitive to the good things that you do, especially something out of the blue. Make it a constant practice to acknowledge yourself every time you come through. -- Gurumayi Chidvilasananda

 urlLink Tarot.com :: : "An uncommon individual has exceptional knowledge and deep understanding of your relationship with your possible love interest. The card in the Love & Me position touches on an aspect of how you perceive yourself with regard to possible intimacy in your life. The Hierophant is someone who knows him or herself to be exceptional. Every circle includes the few who know and understand and the many who aspire to do so. This card acknowledges you as a person with inner knowledge above and beyond theory and scholarship, who is able to contact the spirit world on behalf of humanity. In ancient times shamans were the healers, astrologers and early fabricators of metals and medicines for tribal societies. Nowadays the Hierophant represents those who have special knowledge in their field. She or he speaks wisely from true and direct experience, and serves in a leadership role in your potential relationship. Use this knowledge wisely on behalf of yourself and your possible love interest. It may very likely serve your long-term goals. "

 urlLink Tarot Reading : "The situation is unpredictable. Empty the vessel, releasing any preconceived agenda. Allow yourself and your potential love interest to be guided from a still, calm place within. The card that lands in the Situation position refers to social or circumstantial factors which could be affecting your life at this time. When the Fool is in this position, your upcoming romantic situation may be undefined and open-ended. You do not know, nor can you even begin to guess, what is happening in another person's head. This can create either a feeling of panic or relief. On the other hand, having no blueprint frees you up from the pressure of expectations. You are also free to do something really foolish because there are no rules set out for you! This is a test of your own internal guidance system. Can you refrain from getting desperate about your potential relationship in the absence of structure?"

 urlLink I-Ching Reading : "Personal resolution points to a breakthrough, but decisive action is necessary. As long as you diligently hold your ground and ward off negative tendencies or evil influences, the good will prevail. The persistence of evil is a constant in human affairs; just when it is thought to have been eradicated, up it will pop again, sprouting through some crack in the pavement of decent society. Evil need not take extravagant, forms, such as those exhibited in Nazi Germany. Garden-variety lies and deceit are much more common and persistent, but should be rooted out just as diligently. One must be resolved against negativity - whether in one's social or professional life, or in one's own soul. In either case, definite rules must be followed for the struggle to succeed. The first rule: do not compromise with evil. Negative actions must be identified openly for what they are, and discredited. The second: one cannot resist negativity on its own terms. New, positive alternatives which lead away from the source of the problem are generally more successful, and appropriate, than to counter negativity with raw power. The third rule: the means used to counter negativity must be consistent with the end to be achieved. One cannot stop the spreading of lies by spreading more of them. Spring is approaching. Good times ahead seems inevitable; there is vitality in the air. This is a most auspicious time. Like a snake emerging from hibernation, negative forces are only just beginning to stir, and can be effectively controlled. This is a time of hopeful progress, and must be used to best advantage. When approaching good fortune, conscientious work pays great dividends. A clear road lies ahead. Act now, for at some point this ripe opportunity for advancement will be reversed. No spring lasts forever. It's always wise to stay alert and note the changing signs of the times. Spring is always the season of new relationships. In the bounty of good times, new bonds are formed effortlessly. Relationships born in spring can serve well to warm the following autumn and winter."

Groups ---------------------~--> Bodhi Mail - http://groups.yahoo.com/group/bodhimail ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Message: 1 Date: Tue, 07 Oct 2003 14:48:42 -0500 From: "SD" Subject: we donot pray to Buddha to save us Develop wisdom to overcome Avijjaa By P. S. Mahawatte Almost all religions in the world except Buddhism have as their foundation a creator God and an immortal soul. Let us briefly examine the core beliefs of a few of these religions. The core belief in Hinduism is, after death one joins Paramathma. They are required to have utmost Faith in the Trio- Brahma - (Creator); Vishnu - (Ruler) and Shiva- (Destroyer) of the Universe. To them, Moksya could be achieved only after death. There are other gods such as Ganapathy and Skanda and by having faith in them, they can pray to enable them to find security and lead prosperous lives. Buddhists, too, visit these Kovils and pray to these Gods seeking mundane help to overcome their various day to day problems. But unlike Hindus, the Buddhists perform meritorious acts and transfer the merit thus acquired, to Gods and seek their help. According to Buddhism Gods are unable to commit meritorious acts by themselves. The Buddha said that people pray out of fear and that fear is due to inability to understand things as they really are. This is due to Avijja - nescience or ignorance and the Buddha has taught his disciples how to develop the Wisdom needed to bring to an end this Avijja. Almighty God Christianity which came to be long after Hinduism also believes in an Almighty God as the creator of the universe. They are expected to have complete faith in the Trinity - Father, Son and the Holy Ghost. This appears to have some similarity to the Hindu trio Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. Their Mokshya which they believe as joining their soul with the Creator, can be achieved only after death and that too, only with Gods love and repenting for their sins and prayer. They cannot achieve Mokshya by their own efforts. Islam also requires absolute faith in Almighty Allah and is also based on Atma - Soul and to have utmost faith in the Creator God and to pray daily, so that after death they join their Creator - Mokshya. The followers of the above religions hold fast to the belief that there is an immortal soul somewhere within them, which they want to continue to exist forever, by joining with their Creator. Let us now listen to what the Buddha had to say on this subject. A Bhikku once asked the Buddha Ven. Sir, is there a case where one is tormented when something permanent within oneself is not found. The Buddha said Yes, Bhikku there is. A man has the following view. The Universe is that Atman, I shall be that after death, permanent, abiding, everlasting, unchanging and I shall exist as such for eternity. He hears the Thathagatha or a disciple of his, preaching the doctrine aiming at the complete destruction of all speculative views ... aiming at the extinction of Thirst Thanha, aiming at detachment, cessation Nirvana. Then that man thinks I will be annihilated, I will be destroyed, I will be no more. So he mourns, worries himself, laments, weeps, beating his breasts and become bewildered. Thus O Bhikku, there is a case where one is tormented when something permanent within oneself is not found (from What the Buddha taught by late Dr. Walpola Rahula thera).

 urlLink Metagifted Education Resource Organization: Introduction to Indigo Children : What's an Indigo Child? by Wendy H. Chapman Indigo Children are the current generation being born today and most of those who are 8 years old or younger. They are different. They have very unique characteristics that set them apart from previous generations of children. The name itself indicates the Life Color they carry in their auras and is indicative of the Third Eye Chakra, which represents intuition and psychic ability. These are the children who are often rebellious to authority, nonconformist, extremely emotionally and sometimes physically sensitive or fragile, highly talented or academically gifted and often metaphysically gifted as well, usually intuitive, very often labeled ADD, either very empathic and compassionate OR very cold and callous, and are wise beyond their years. Does this sound like yourself or your child? Indigos have come into this world with difficult challenges to overcome. Their extreme levels of sensitivity are hard to understand and appreciate by parents who don't share this trait. Their giftedness is unusual in such high numbers. Their nonconformity to systems and to discipline will make it difficult to get through their childhood years and perhaps even their adult years. It is also what will help them accomplish big goals such as changing the educational system, for instance. Being an Indigo won't be easy for any of them, but it foretells a mission. The Indigo Children are the ones who have come to raise the vibration of our planet! These are the primary ones who will bring us the enlightenment to ascend. There's a very good chance your child is an Indigo if he/she was born after 1992. About 85% or higher of children born in '92 or later, 90% born in '94 or after and 95% or more born now (some even say 99%) are Indigo Children! Does this mean you aren't one if you were born prior to 1992? No! I've heard reports that they started coming in the 80s, but that means coming in larger numbers. I believe there have been Indigos born in every year, but perhaps not in high enough percentages to notice their presence and see what makes them so unique. So can you be a 24 yr old Indigo or a 50 year old one? Yes! urlLink NEXT - Is Your Child an Indigo?

I often tell practitioners that they should adopt the following principle: regarding one's own personal needs, there should be as little involvement or obligation as possible, but regarding service to others, there should be as many possible involvements and obligations as possible. This should be the ideal of a spiritual person." - His Holiness the Dalai Lama

 "If we are in an environment for a long time, we will naturally adapt to the environment. If we would like to cultivate spiritually and be a bodhisattva, we must be able to withstand constant refinement of our temperament." - Venerable Master Cheng Yen

 urlLink Osho Zen Tarot : "The image of integration is the unio mystica, the fusion of opposites. This is a time of communication between the previously experienced dualities of life. Rather than night opposing day, dark suppressing light, they work together to create a unified whole, turning endlessly one into the other, each containing in its deepest core the seed of the opposite. The eagle and the swan are both beings of flight and majesty. The eagle is the embodiment of power and aloneness. The swan is the embodiment of space and purity, gently floating and diving, upon and within the element of the emotions, entirely content and complete within her perfection and beauty. We are the union of eagle and swan: male and female, fire and water, life and death. The card of integration is the symbol of self-creation, new life, and mystical union; otherwise known as alchemy."

 urlLink Maya del Mar's Free Daily Success Guide Astrological Forecast : "SUNDAY NOVEMBER 23. The New Moon Solar Eclipse at 2 Sagittarius occurs at 4:02 p.m. The Sagittarius moon cycle is about moving into the world, spreading the word, letting the world know the truth of the matter and what we are about. In Scorpio we went through the dark tunnel of initiation. Now in Sagittarius we emerge into the bright sunlight, spread our wings, and fly. We feel reborn, and the world is our oyster. We want to announce it to one and all. Sun and Moon's last contacts were their squares with Uranus, and they come into this fresh world with a great deal of independence. This eclipse will renew our autonomy, both personally and in the world. Uranus can also indicate surprises, and in Washington DC it is exactly overhead. Mars is still jazzed up from its opposition to adventurous Jupiter, and it's now building up to a very assertive square with Pluto on Wednesday. At the same time, during the 48 hours from last night through tomorrow night, both Mercury and Moon square Mars and conjoin Pluto to fill our hearts and minds with aggressive vibes. This is a dangerous time. A solar eclipse hides consciousness and allows the unconscious to rule. Sagittarius is the sign of the gambler. And aggressive Mars/Pluto impulses are raining into our head and heart, represented by Mercury and Moon. Moon not only transits over Mercury tomorrow night; but it also eclipses Mercury, thus blotting out logic, and giving Mercury extra significance. Mercury adds to the already-strong movement and travel urges of this time. Sagittarius is expansive. It is a no-holds-barred sign, always ready to go. It is very helpful now to have a plan of action, as a channel for the energy which is being released.

 urlLink Osho Zen Tarot : "Life is rarely as serious as we believe it to be, and when we recognize this fact, it responds by giving us more and more opportunities to play. " "The indecisive and dualistic aspect of the mind asks should I let my arms go and fall head-first, or let my legs go and fall feet-first? Should I go here or there? Should I say yes or no? And whatever decision we make, we will always wonder if we should have decided the other way. The only way out of this dilemma is, unfortunately, to let go of both at once. You can't work your way out of this one by solving it, making lists of pros and cons, or in any way working it out with your mind. Better to follow your heart, if you can find it. If you can't find it, just jump--your heart will start beating so fast there will be no mistake about where it is!" "Drop your opinionated mind and move inside. There, you can relax into your own deepest truth, where the difference between dreams and reality is already known."

 urlLink FTAA lite seen as deal-breaker By STEVEN CHASE Miami Canada and other countries warned yesterday that a bid by the United States and Brazil to significantly narrow the scope of a proposed free-trade area of the Americas agreement could derail the talks under way in Miami. A group opposed to the barebones deal including Canada, Chile, and Mexico says the 'FTAA lite' salvage proposal Washington and Brasilia have cobbled together to salvage talks is insufficient to keep negotiations moving forward. 'This is simply a papering over of differences and is not enough to establish a basis for continuing [talks],' a source close to FTAA negotiations in Miami said yesterday. The move by Washington and Brasilia to a lowest-common-denominator FTAA deal, ridiculed as 'FTAA lite', reflects gaping disagreements between the two economic titans of the Western Hemisphere over how far negotiations should go in dismantling trade barriers. It would fall grievously short of the sweeping and comprehensive 'NAFTA on steroids' goal envisaged in 1994, when preparatory FTAA negotiations first began among all countries in the Western Hemisphere except Cuba. Trade watchers are increasingly suspicious that the United States' only aim in Miami is to keep talks alive until the meeting ends Nov. 21.

 The Wisdom & Compassion of a Bodhisattva Moonpointer Newsletter #1 Realisation: Looking for the Moon "Told her to look at the moon last night... and she almost missed the big low rising yellow crescent moon, as she was looking for a small high hanging white full moon. What is the moon like really? Neither of the above - not always full or not - it is constant change itself - waxing or waning all the time- Anicca! The universal truth of impermanence. When we look for specific things in life, we might miss the real thing, or even better things. What other things in life do we look for in a specific form? When nothing stays the same... Let us open our hearts and minds, and be one with change, both physical and mental, both within and without us, both in dealing with things, matters and people. We can't help it that we ourselves change too. But we can help ourselves if we are mindful about our changes, and change only for the better."

 urlLink PRESS RELEASE ( PR Web) Millions Celebrate Most Spectacular Planetary Alignment in 6,000 Years - November 8/9, 2003 "The Harmonic Concordance" : "The total lunar eclipse is part of what is known in astrology as a Grand Sextile pattern a wonderful, harmonious flow of energy between six planets in our solar system. Within this pattern is yet another powerful pattern known as The Star of David, an important mystic symbol. This is the most significant alignment in the 6,000 year span between 3,000 BC and 3,000 CE. This is one powerful moment in time -- but its effects can last for centuries to come. The general consensus is that (at the very least) this moment is likely to bestow grace and blessings upon those who spend this time and use the high energies it produces with their hearts and minds focused spiritually. There have been numerous speculations about what might happen during this time. Some are rather extreme, to say the least. Some expect to see the first wave of Ascension take place. Others are waiting for spaceships to take us away. Still others wonder if the astrological chart is foretelling a type of universal rapture. Blaze believes it is not so much about the outward events, but an opportunity for to make this time as spiritually powerful as possible. In other words, be spiritually proactive; dont wait for things to happen. Powerful planetary events can and often do coincide with events in the world around us, and these can indeed be regarded as signposts from the Cosmos. Astrology is a language of the Divine, and It uses such events to talk to us. However, first we have to raise our vibrations through spiritual work and meditation, in order to attune ourselves to what is being said. Once we learn to do this, then indeed we can expect sublime events,"

 urlLink Llewellyn Journal - The Harmonic Concordance, a Time of Enlightenment and Letting Go : "Right now the world stands ready to receive a great spiritual gift from the universe. After the conflict and trouble of the last several years, staring with the Grand Cross in August 1999 and continuing with the Saturn/Pluto opposition of 2001, we are now being given a great reward. The November 8, 2003 Lunar Eclipse at 16 degrees of Taurus brings with it several positive, once in a lifetime aspects, brimming over with positive energy. First, the eclipse itself is one of the best of the Saros series of eclipses. An eclipse series has a history behind it, bringing forth either positive or negative energy. This one is positive. All the best of Taurus energy is flowing in and around this eclipse. Taurus is ruled by Venus, the planet of love and harmony. Taurus is concerned with the issues of relationships, money, real estate, beauty and the greenery of the earth. Taurus is the gardener of the zodiac, the one who plants her garden and then waits and watches it grow. Now is a great time to plant some seeds and wait for them to shoot up."

 urlLink The Harmonic Concordance: The Chart Heard 'round the World "The total lunar eclipse of November 8, 2003 reveals a moment in time potentially more potent than the "cosmic stampede" in Taurus in May of 2000 or of any of a host of other "important" dates projected for 2003. The planetary energies present are very appropriate to a moment that would carry the astrological signature of the Ascension. Consider the qualities of the planets as they are represented through the metaphors of astrology: The Sun - the primal energy; the cause for being; masculine in nature; the basic will and vitality that inspires life; our creativity and conscious aim;that which expresses the best of who we are, The Moon - the archetypical feminine; the mother; the personal subconscious mind, memory and imagination the; tidal ebb and flow of emotion; the avenues of habit and instinct; the shelter of home, Jupiter - the king of the gods; beneficence, good fortune and expansion; the publication of ideals; the higher mind, wisdom and enthusiasm; generosity, optimism and increase on all levels, Mars - the courage, desire, energy and willingness to act; the stimulation of passion; the ability to be the spiritual warrior, Saturn - the physical bones of the Earth and our bodies; the disciplinarian and 'tester' of our metal; the limitations of the physical; endurance, perseverance, and stability, and finally, Chiron - the crystal rainbow bridge between physicality and spirit, the inner and outer planets; the wounded healer; Christ consciousness; initiation; the interface between God and Godling."
