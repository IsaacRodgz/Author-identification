 So creative: urlLink The Amazing Holiday Zine of Keri Smith

 As seen at urlLink Martinis, Persistence, and a Smile , I had my urlLink palm read : You are intelligent and practical, very likely to have a good memory and the ability to make and follow plans. Leadership skills are among your useful traits. Just be careful not to go to extremes and become a dictator. You may have trouble concentrating or focusing your attention, especially under stress. There is a tremendous amount of intensity in your mental processes. You have so many interests that you may have trouble deciding which ones to pursue. This can make you seem very contradictory, since you are so passionate and sincere about each new idea you embrace. There may be times in your life when you give in to feelings of sadness or depression. You are naturally charming and inclined to be flirtatious. Your high energy level draws people to you. You have a basically strong constitution, and should enjoy good health most of the time. A major illness or setback is predicted near mid-life. However, you can expect a speedy recovery. No matter what other factors influence your personality, there is an under lying sense of practicality that you can draw on if you wish. Um, yes. Although sometimes my flirting has gone unnoticed. And I wonder what they mean by mid-life.

 I'm finished wrapping, I'm finished wrapping ....

 Mom was just here to pick-up some Christmas socks for a contest at work tomorrow. I showed her over the weekend that Cory seems to be shedding some egg-like things. Today she chastises me for letting her get up on the dining room table when I am having company over for Christmas dinner. I think to myself, Um, she's a cat. You try and keep her off. Then she says something along the effect of, "You better hope those are not worm eggs because by now you have eaten some and then you'll have to get treated for worms." Um, thanks mom. What was I just saying about getting sick?

 First all the sick shelter kids coughed on me. Now my Godson has bronchitis. If I don't get sick this week, I'm not getting sick this winter.

 I am so craving hummus. Weird, I know. The problem is I like the hummus from one store, but the pita chips from another. *sigh* I am too working!

 urlLink usatoday has given their take on the urlLink best and worst of TV in 2003. The only one that matters to me is #5 on the best list: Alias (ABC). What a rush. urlLink Alias offers as entertaining an hour as you'll find on TV, but its real gift is its ability to mine reality out of absurdity. No show has more ridiculous plot complications, from the heroine with amnesia to the doppelganger who refuses to die. But through clever writing and fine acting, Alias keeps us invested in its characters, and that's enough to keep us following the often incomprehensible plots. This flat-out fun show has surprising emotional depth and a star in Jennifer Garner, who is an unfaltering delight.

 Over the weekend I told mom that I bought our two assistants the new urlLink South Beach Good Fats/Good Carbs Counter paperback. She told me that she'd just read an article about the worst holiday gift ideas and diet books were #1. I found the article and she was right. However my favorite was #8: urlLink The joke's on you ~ Before you spend $20 on whoopee cushion or another joke item, think about flushing that $20 down the toilet. Is that funny? We didn't think so. Amen! I hate white elephant gifts!

 This morning on the way to work I listened to the all-Christmas music station with my window rolled down because it was warm. That's just wrong.

 I am definitely certain it's Monday now. I got in the car this morning and realized I put my lunch bag in the trash and brought the trash bag with me to the car.

 For some reason I woke up at 7 a.m. when my alarm went off. That never happens on a weekday (I live for the snooze button). I was even out of bed when my back-up alarm went off. I've been playing online for almost 30 minutes now. Just wasting time before I head to work. Are you sure it's Monday?

 Guess what I am doing right now? Besides this, I mean. My very first load of laundry in my new washer!! Whew. It's been a busy one. I need to go back to work to rest from my weekend!

 My cat is acting psycho today. And she's been unusually mean the last few days. I wonder what's up.

 Every single child at the shelter was sick today. And every single child I held coughed in my face. At least once. When I started going to the shelter my shift was to be 9-12. I had a terrible time getting up with enough time to be there at 9. So if it was after 9, I just wouldn't go. I talked with my therapist about it and she helped me see that it would be ok if I went at 9:30 instead. That I would be more apt to go and I would be a happier volunteer for the kids. She was right. So most Sundays I work 9:30-11:30. Once the kids go down for their nap (about 11:15), there's no need for me to hang around. I'm thankful for that epiphany because I get so much joy from being around those kids. Except for the coughing part.

 Yesterday I felt like Wonder Woman for manhandling the washer and dryer by myself. Today? Not so much.

 I have had a great day. One of those that starts off good and just gets better. Got up early to hit the mall with mom. We were looking for her final gifts to purchase. Something for my Godmother and something for me. We started at Sears because they had a good ad, plus 10% off before 10 a.m. We looked at TV's (for my bedroom) and washer/dryers (for which she would make a contribution). We found a nice TV, but I told her I wanted to keep looking. While getting some breakfast, I called Linda to see if she'd like me to pick up some of her favorite coffee beans. As I told her what we were doing she said, "Would you like my TV?" Don't I have great friends?! Actually, she's looking to purchase a larger one and would gift me her 19". Good for me, back to square one for mom. At some point, my friend Sandy called to see if I'd like to hang out with my Godson during the afternoon. Our first solo outing! Next we found the perfect robe for my Godmother, who is quite petite. She's probably under 5' now (you know how they shink). Plus mom got an Olive Garden gift card for her neighbor. We went to Home Depot because I had a gift card for there. I found a dented washing machine for &#36;75 off. Minus my gift card, I got a Maytag washer/dryer for &#36;450 (and zero apr for a year!). So, I rented a U-Haul truck from Home Depot. They loaded up the w/d and I drove it home. Got out the dolly and gently let each one down a very steep ramp before wheeling them into the garage! Go me! We took the truck back, had lunch, picked up my Godson ... who asked about my mother, "She's not coming with us, is she?" We dropped off mom and stopped by my house so he could see Cory. Then we went to play putt-putt. I haven't played putt-putt in years. I had a great time and he was so funny. He promised early on to "take it easy" on me because "you're my Godmother." At one point I mentioned that we'd be pretty close in score. Thinking that I had lots of points and was no where near him in score, he gently explained to me, "Now, you do realize that you have to have less points, not the most to win?" I just let out a huge belly laugh (and then he was a little surprised to see he'd only won by one). We played 36 holes and then he shot some hoops (he's really very good). Afterwards he wanted to drive-thru McDonald's and go to his grandmothers. See, his mom had surgery this week. I think it's been stressful on him. I think he was really to go make sure his mom was still ok. Still, it was a great treat for me to get solo time and have him be talkative. I had a great time! Yep, me and the 8-year-olds or the 80-year-olds, but no men in between!

 I received a lot of compliments on my hair today, but mostly about my eyes. How the darker color makes them really "pop" off my face (well, not literally ~ you know what I mean). I also got a compairson to urlLink Lisa Loeb when I put my glasses on in the afternoon. Or maybe I only hear what I want to.

 Saw this in Newsweek and thought it was worth sharing as we begin thinking about New Year's Resolutions: urlLink Holiday: Seven Things to Do Dec. 22 issue - Forget swearing to run a marathon or lose 20 pounds. TIP SHEET suggests New Year's resolutions you can actually keep: Register to vote : Primaries are around the corner; sign up at www.fec.gov. Check your credit rating : For less than $40, get a combined credit rating and score from all three bureaus--Equifax (equifax.com), TransUnion (tuc.com) and Experian (experian.com). Get (or renew) your passport : Find out what you need for a new one (two photos with a light background) at travel.state.gov. You can usually renew online. Read a really good book : For suggestions, check ala.org/recommended reading. Buy a scale and tape measure : A key to keeping off those pounds is a weekly weigh-in. Also, measure your waist. A circumference of more than 35 inches for women and 40 inches for men places you at high risk for diabetes and heart disease. Check out lifespan.org. Plant a tree : For help choosing the variety for your climate, go to americanforests.org. It'll even plant one for you. Write your will : Make sure your financial assets are handled the way you want them to be. For information, visit abanet.org and www.actec.org. Personally I need to do the will thing.

 The thing that's deceiving about the pictures below is that this color is dark. The kind of dark that jolted me awake when I looked in the mirror this morning. It's darker than my natural color and has tinges of red to go with the other highlights. I remain very undecided about the look.

 New color:

 This evening a friend sent me an article, "Thought you might find this interesting. I know I did." urlLink Forget 'Friends': The couple makes a comeback . I think you get the obvious gist of the story just from the headline, but a couple of paragraphs in particular stood out to me: Despite rising numbers of singles, Ms. DePaulo says her studies underscore the stigma long associated with singledom. Single people are seen as sadder, lonelier, and less mature than their coupled counterparts. And as sad, lonely, and immature as young singles may seem, she says, the 40-year-old single appears even more pitiful. "I think it's fine to be single until you're 35, but then you're supposed to be coupled," says Kay Trimberger, a professor of women's and gender studies at Sonoma State University in Rohnert Park, Calif., who studies the lives of single women. "For anybody over 35, the message is still pretty heavy that there's something wrong with you." Now, the young lady who sent me the e-mail is 30. I am 38. I don't think it's an intentional jab at me, I just happen to be single too. I do know that she really, really wants to be married and have a family. So I can see why she related to this . . . "...disagrees with the idea that America is becoming a society that accepts singles. She senses a return to matrimony - "big marriage, big wedding, the big gown, and the diamond ring." "There are more single people than ever before, but culturally those people are not happy," she says. "The idea that it's a great way to live is not what I see being true." That's bullshit. And shame on the four female professors quoted for perpetuating the myth that a woman cannot live a fulfilled life without a man. Sheesh.

 Don't forget, I'm publishing over at urlLink Diet Blog too. Though you can only tell which are mine by checking out the comments section (leave some while you're there!).

 Do you ever have something you don't like to talk about because sure as you do you'll jinx it? Like you mention a boy for the first time to a friend and then you never see him again. Or you brag about not ever getting a ticket and then get one the next day. That's what's going on here. That's why I'm not blogging much. I'm sort of keeping a secret. Not a boy or a speeding ticket, but something I really don't want to jinx. I hope to let you in on it soon.

 You know how you overdramatize something in your mind to the point of lightheadedness? I just did that. A few weeks ago I took a shower with one of those sugar scrubs. Since then my belly button ring has hurt like it hasn't before. I finally decided maybe I got a granule of sugar stuck in the hole. For the first time since the piercing, I took my barbell out tonight. I'd heard so many horror stories about it hurting like hell to be taken out that I worked myself up a little too much for it. In the end, it came out easily, cleaned easily and went back in easily. All that for nothing. Except maybe a piercing that doesn't hurt any more.

 Things were quiet at the shelter this morning, so I skipped out early to watch more of today's events. Then I hit the stores. I am officially finished with my holiday shopping now, with the exception of one gift. I want to get something for my neighbors. They have been so good to me this year and I'd like to thank them for it. I really don't know much about them (likes, dislikes, etc...). They are male "friends" who are "roommates." I thought about a gift card to eat somewhere (PF Chang's) or maybe Home Depot/Lowe's, but then I worry about anything with a dollar amount on it that they might feel they need to reciprocate to. I tried to do something for them during this summer when they started mowing my yard, but they did something back for me. I just want to be able to say "thank you" without expecting something in return! I thought maybe a nice food basket or baking them a pie, but what if they are on special diets?? Any suggestions?

 I am so excited!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I found my digital camera. I was kid-entertaining (babysitting seems inappropriate after a certain age) and pulled the cushion off one of my chairs and there it was!!

 I saw this originally on urlLink glimpseofagrrl , but did a search for the entire list. Here are my favorites. What I've Learned I've learned that regardless of my relationship with my parents, I'll miss them when they're gone from my life. I've learned that making a "living" is not the same thing as making a "life." I've learned that life sometimes gives you a second chance. I've learned that even when I have pains, I don't have to be one. I've learned that you can tell a lot about a person by the way he/she handles these three things: a rainy day, lost luggage, and tangled Christmas tree lights. I've learned that I still have a lot to learn. I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. I've learned that when you're in love, it shows. I've learned that being kind is more important than being right. I've learned that I can always pray for someone when I don't have the strength to help him in some other way. I've learned that we should be glad God doesn't give us everything we ask for. I've learned that it's those small daily happenings that make life so spectacular. I've learned that to ignore the facts does not change the facts. I've learned that life is tough, but I'm tougher. I've learned that I can't choose how I feel, but I can choose what I do about it. I've learned that no matter what happens, or how bad it seems today, life does go on, and it will be better tomorrow.

 I passed a sign on my drive home tonight that said it was 80&deg;. It's December 8. That's just wrong.

 I went to the shelter today for what seemed like the first time in forever. It was great seeing the kids and I had a blast . . . until the siblings came. The shelter I volunteer at holds kids till they turn two. Then they move to the children's shelter till they are 12. Today, we had about 12 siblings visit four or five of the toddlers and infants. I was awed to watch the older kids come into the building. They were lined up and told to stop and wait until their adult supervisor caught up. Some started calling out to their sisters from the line. You could hear the excitement in their voices. The joy at seeing their sister. In one group there was three brothers and one sister to see their two younger sisters. When told it was ok, they literally ran to their sisters. The two oldest boys immediately picking them up, hugging and kissing them. Even though I held a boy in my arms, we mostly sat and watched the older children playing with and loving on their sibling. We were both pretty overwhelmed by it. Another boy was trying to get his sister to play with him, but she just cried. She wouldn't go to him. It broke my heart to watch as he started to cry, feeling rejected by his own blood. Again. I pointed it out to one of the better caregivers and she went to him. Talked to him and then took the two to another part of the building so they could be alone together. When they came back, all was well and she played with him happily. I watched one boy hold his infant brother . . . who wasn't even a month old yet. He just stared down at the baby with love and pride. Some of the other kids would call out to me, "Miss, Miss" and show me how they could juggle or do a silly trick to make their brother or sister laugh. Many just sat and read books or played with a toy with their sibling. Some never let them go. It was amazing to see how strong the relationships were. How bonded they were. Even with their lives in utter turmoil. And it was, as they left, as I expected. Braveness at first. Hugs. Kisses. Hugs. And then tears. Sobbing. Some wailing as they reached the door. Not from the toddlers. From the older brothers and sisters. It must be hard to be away from "their" babies. And then to see them and have to leave again. They must wonder, "Will this be the last time?" Yes, it hurt my heart.

 urlLink This is for Francie . Awesome!

 Just home from the party. It was actually pretty fun. Good food. Couple glasses of wine and a bottle of Jack Daniels from the Chinese gift exchange. Egg nog anyone?

 Tonight is the department holiday party. It will be the first time I've attended since I've been on meds for depression. I'm not dreading it as much as I normally do. We were quizzing each other earlier in the week about what we were bringing for the gift exchange. Apparently someone last year bought a rice krispie maker. I totally could not remember that. Finally I asked, Did I go to the party last year? Ashley said, "No, you were in London." Oh. Yeah. *sigh*

 There's no urlLink Friday Five today, so I'm doing last week's! 1. Do you like to shop? Why or why not? I like shopping for others more than for myself. 2. What was the last thing you purchased? A Revlon Paraffin Spa for the Chinese gift exchange at our department holiday party tomorrow. 3. Do you prefer shopping online or at an actual store? Why? For everything but clothes, I'd love to shop online ~ but only if the shipping is free! 4. Did you get an allowance as a child? No. 5. What was the last thing you regret purchasing? My digital camera. Especially since someone stole it.

 Continuing the urlLink onfocus PSA in case you haven't seen it (it's very important with Christmas coming, you know!): Public Service Announcement: If you link to your Amazon Wish List on your site, you may need to change that link. I've noticed that standard Wish List links are not working latelybut you won't know whether or not it's working if you have the Amazon cookie. For example, when I click on this link in my browser on my computer: urlLink http://amazon.com/o/wishlist/3FOF79BIVB2XX I see my Wish List. But if I click on that link in another browser (with no Amazon cookie, or a different cookie), I see a generic Wish List page. And more importantly, so will anyone else clicking the link. To link directly to your Wish List so others can see it, change wishlist in the URL to registry , like so: urlLink http://amazon.com/o/registry/3FOF79BIVB2XX Yeah, I know that's Paul Bausch's wish list and not mine, but since he figured it out he should get the rewards. But do tell ~ does my urlLink wishlist link take you to mine?

 When I read that urlLink Gwyneth is expecting a baby I thought, Good for her . And then I thought, What was that about? It's not like I know her or even like her . Weird.

 Last night I watched urlLink AIDS: A Pop Culture History on urlLink VH1 . It was excellent. I really don't remember much about AIDS until urlLink Rock Hudson died. The statistics on the number of infected victims who died in the early years was absolutely stunning to me. Each year, more than half of the newly diagnosed died. For years and years. Until urlLink Ryan White . And urlLink Magic Johnson . Really, it was awesome and very moving. If you get a chance to catch it, do.

 Oh, how I have missed my favorite blogs. It's so great to catch up with everyone!

Komen Breast Cancer Foundation to raise funds through the sale of their new "pink & white " M&M candies. For each 8-ounce bag of the special candies sold, the makers of M&M will donate 50 cents to the foundation. The next time you want a treat, please pick up a bag (now sold in stores nationwide). You will be donating to a great cause and satisfying your sweet tooth!

 A lady goes to the Post Office to buy some stamps for her Christmas cards. She says to the clerk, "May I have 50 Christmas stamps?" The postal clerk says, "What denomination?" The lady says, "God help us! Has it come to this? Give me 6 Catholic, 12 Presbyterian, 10 Lutheran, and 22 Baptist."

 We made it home ok. We had 31 minutes to make it through the Detroit airport and it took like 10 to get off the place. There were points when I was literally running pushing mom's wheelchair. As we got close to the gate, we could hear them paging us ~ yep, last ones on the plane. The weather has been so nice this weekend and it's nice to see some sun! It was great to be back in my own bed and I was so happy to see Cory (and she me for a change!). The two Alias episodes were awesome. Last night's especially. My mouse is still on the outs. I hope to have the Nerdz back soon so I can be online again. I miss it!

 I think this is an interesting post from urlLink Caryn : . . .the people I know deal with dating in either of two ways: Some go on a lot of dates, trying really hard to meet the person of their dreams, and some have gotten tired of that and are doing whatever makes them happy without worrying about it -- and this latter group might even go an entire year without a date. And you know what? Often, the results end up the same. My first thought was, Yeah, but the former probably get to have more sex. Yeah, I'm a latter.

 And the urlLink Friday Five (since it's Friday!): You have just won one million dollars: 1. Who do you call first? My mom. 2. What is the first thing you buy for yourself? First I will pay-off all my debt. Then I will probably buy a new car. 3. What is the first thing you buy for someone else? I would do for my mom what I would do for myself. 4. Do you give any away? If yes, to whom? Yes, I would tithe 10&#37; to the church I grew up in and charities I believe in. 5. Do you invest any? If so, how? Yes. That's what financial advisors are for.

 Whoo-boy. Blog controversy at it's best. Emmie wrote a post about being a urlLink sizest . She writes, "I have preconceived incorrect notions about what being fat means." I read it the entire post and thought, Huh and moved on. Since then about 100 folks have shared their thoughts. Some of it got ugly. Some of it got even uglier. Personally, I like what urlLink Sarah said, "So Em says she's a bit of a sizeist and that she's working on it. Fucking rad. Ovaries, right there, boy. Ovaries of steel. And I say more power to her. Maybe if we were all as honest, we could let go of our own issues, or ask for help when we need it."

 urlLink Next Episode : Sunday, February 15 "After Six" - The episode preview is not yet available. Geez. That's three more weeks!!

 I've been having pretty yucky stuff going on at work. To the point where it's making me feel sick to be there. Yesterday I kept thinking, I feel like throwing up . I got the other option instead. Yep. It may truly be time for a new job. Something really hard to think about after 11.7 years. I haven't been talking about it here because, God forbid someone from work finally find this place. We've all heard the I-got-fired-because-of-my-blog-story. It's what's been kicking my depression in the ass. I hate the thought of leaving. I have good, solid work relationships throughout the company. I've made genuine friendships. And when I'm on . . . I'm really, really good at what I do. And then I think, Yeah, but what if it made you feel better to leave here? What if this job is what's making you depressed? The thought of starting somewhere new excites and terrifies me. I took a class last week on updating your resume. Tomorrow night the topic is cover letters. I've been out of the game for so long, I had to recreate my resume from scratch. Trying to define what I've done the last 11+ years has been hard. And the thought of an interview? Yeesh. There was a job I really wanted in December, but I was too late in applying to even make the first round of interviews. It really would have been perfect for me. It was the secret I didn't want to talk about. I am flustered and frustrated and struggling. Is it Saturday yet??

 Hang on to any of the new State of Texas quarters. If you have them, they may be worth much more than 25 cents. The US Treasury announced today that it is recalling all of the Texas quarters that are part of its program featuring quarters from each state. "We are recalling all the new Texas quarters that were recently issues," Treasury Undersecretary Jack Shackleford said Monday. "This action is being taken after numerous reports that the new quarters will not work in parking meters, toll booths, vending machines, pay phones, or other coin-operated devices." The quarters were issued in the order in which the various state joined the US and have been a tremendous success among coin collectors worldwide. "The problem lies in the unique design of the Texas quarter, which was created by a Texas A&M graduate," Shackleford said. "Apparently, the duct tape holding the two dimes and the nickel together keeps jamming the coin-operated devices."

 urlLink Will Miranda change her baby's name to "Brady Brady"? Oh, yeah. I hadn't thought about that.

 It's funny, this library thing. I walk in there. Ask for books. And they give them to me. For free. I almost feel like I am getting away with something devious when I walk out of the building! Today I picked up: urlLink Burning The Map , urlLink Dog Handling , urlLink Ralph's Party and urlLink American Pie .

 I've had a productive day. I worked hard at the shelter this morning. They are short-handed, but every bed is filled. We had two sets of twins today. And lots of babies. My house is relatively clean. The dishes are washed. The laundry is done. I have clean sheets and a clean body. And I didn't nap. It was a good day.

 I'm gonna miss urlLink those girls . When it's all said and done, who do you think urlLink Carrie will end up with ?

 Isn't it ironic? urlLink Lottery winner dies in accident hours after show. Don't you think?

 How cool. The urlLink Annual Blogger Boobie Thon that raised funds for urlLink Susan G. Komen Foundation is featured in the February issue of urlLink Self magazine. Congratulations to urlLink Robyn and the women (and men) who won the urlLink Body Confidence Award !

 Hmmm. ok. Now I need to find an excuse to take a long drive. My Godson is not feeling well enough to play in his basketball game today. That's usually a 20 minute drive each way and I was planning those dance moves. Hmmm. Just where do I need to go today?

 Loved urlLink this one over at urlLink Da Goddess .

 My urlLink Bad Girl Calendar weekend page says to do a little road dancing today and tomorrow. The fine art of car dancing is lost on most men. Start with a little shoulder shimmy and a head bob, then add a steady beat on the steering wheel or dashboard. When you've got your groove, throw in a few flashier moves like "The Turn Signal" (reach your left arm out and flash your fingers to the rhythm, then reach your right hand out and do the same, the alternate arms) or "The Floor It" (throw your head and shoulders back to the beat). Luckily, I have a urlLink new CD to try those moves out!

 Found at urlLink Lisa's : Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington West Virginia Wisconsin Wyoming Washington, D.C. Bold = Visited Italics = Lived The state I most want to add to my list? Oregon.

 Bought a new CD tonight. urlLink

 Tonight mom and I went to dinner. Mind you, I've been eating pretty much the urlLink South Beach way since October. She still asks what I can eat as if we'll never find anything. Tonight however, she asked, "What can you eat on that urlLink South Park diet?"

 Pretty! Now, if only I had a Valentine . . .

 urlLink Captain Kangaroo . RIP.

 From the urlLink Friday Five . At this moment, what is your favorite... 1. ...song? It's My Life, urlLink No Doubt . I love their cover of the urlLink Talk Talk song. 2. ...food? Hummus 3. ...tv show? urlLink Alias 4. ...scent? Rain 5. ...quote? " urlLink I want that bitch dead. " or " urlLink I feel you need to know that your good friend Miranda Hobbes, has just taken a piece of cake out of the garbage and eaten it. You'll probably need this information when you check me into the Betty Crocker Clinic. "

 I received this e-mail from a co-worker: Ladies, Just to inform you on the new laws taking effect this comming February 2004, you will no longer be able to use a cell phone while driving unless you have a "hands free" adapter. I went to Circuit City and they wanted $50 for a headset with a boom microphone for my cell phone. I have come up with an alternative. These kits are compatible with any mobile phone and one size fits all. I paid $0.08 each because I bought in quantity. I'm selling them for $0.08. I tried them out on Erickson, Motorola, & Nokia Sprint PCS phones and they worked perfectly. A photo is attached. Take a look and let me know if you want one. Also, please forward this to anyone you know who may want to buy one! If you don't have your money I will accept a post dated check. I am always concerned with your safety. Because I CARE. Love always, Rita The attached photo: And then she brought us all rubber bands for free!!

 I saw my therapist yesterday. We talked about my meads. The weight gain. The issues I continue to have at work. I asked about going off of the Lexapro to see if I might regain some of that old "sharpness." She said no. She referred me to a psychiatrist who works at the University of Texas Health Science Center specializing in the study of antidepressants. We hope that she can make a recommendation for something that can help me iron out these kinks. Or, she might just say Lexapro is as good as its gonna get for me.

 Have you read urlLink A Travel Guide to Heaven ? Tell me what you thought of it.

 Cory got put into time out tonight. She has been aggressively playing attack cat the last few days. I have PMS. Enough said. After about the third attack tonight, I swooped her up and placed her inside her carrier. We had a little discussion about using the time to think about her behavior. I let her out after 30 minutes. She's been an angel ever since.

 I wonder if the contestants who audition for urlLink American Idol change their minds about their horrible performances once they actually see themselves on TV.

 Speaking of funny t.v., don't forget to watch urlLink Airline tonight on A&#38;E.

 I saw urlLink American Idol for the first time tonight. They are still in the try-out phase. Absolutely-freakin-hysterical.

 One of the benefits of getting from the library is that it doesn't matter how fast I read them anymore. They're free .

 Oy. A very cute little Girl Scout just came to my door selling cookies. I just couldn't say no. I bought two boxes of thin mints. So much for that diet.

 It's time for the urlLink Bloggies . I thought about not voting this year after all the controversy last year, but then I figured, "What the hell?" I don't vote in the categories I'm not familiar with and it's nice to see a few familiar sites (even a couple I Blogroll).

 OK, back to urlLink Alias . There he was, all confessional ... all kissy-kissy with Syd ... and yet he almost ran back to his wife with that *look* on his face. Yeah, I know, that's what he's supposed to do, but it was all about the look . I loved it when she told Vaughn that she slept with Will. I loved that he was upset, but really, not like he can say much, huh? And Dad and Katya. Hmmm. I thought Isabella looked ... puffy. It was interesting to see what she did to Jack. And Sloane.

 I finished urlLink Neurotica on Saturday night. I didn't like it as much as her other books. I started urlLink A Travel Guide to Heaven last night. It's very interesting. It's making me think a lot about how I imagine heaven. So far, his version is nothing like mine. Did you know that the earth is going to be heaven? That we cannot fully enjoy heaven until the apocalypse? It's making me want to get one of those written-in-English bibles to read Revelations.

 I hate it when there's no preview at the end of my urlLink favorite show (which totally rocked tonight, by the way). It means no new episode next week.

 "The 2003 Year-End Zeitgeist offers a unique perspective on the year's major events and hottest trends based on more than 55 billion searches conducted over the past year by Google users from around the world. Whether you are tracking the global progression of the latest news or learning about healthy searches in Japan, the urlLink 2003 Year-End Zeitgeist enables you to look at the past year through the collective eyes of the world on the Internet."

 I watched urlLink When Harry Met Sally... this afternoon. It reminds me a lot of me and my old friend Ray. Well, except for the having sex and getting married part.

 Um, yeah. I was going to tell you how I really am feeling better today. I went to the library to pick-up my books ( urlLink A Travel Guide to Heaven , urlLink Neurotica and urlLink Sushi for Beginners ) and to my Godson's basketball game (he made three baskets!). It's a gorgeous day. Sunny in the 70s. Come home to find I left my back door open. Sure the screen is latched, but really....

 I am very excited that we have a urlLink new radio station in town.

 urlLink Zap2it.com - "Kill Bill" co-star Vivian Fox and her fast-talking director Quentin Tarantino will guest star on ABC's "Alias," two of a slew of high profile cameos on ABC shows planned for the next two sweeps periods. Isn't that urlLink Vivica Fox ?

 urlLink Sarah Jessica Parker won't rule out "Sex" reunion -- or a film "We're not going to go the 'Lord of the Rings' route," she says. "But I've learned never to say never."

 The meds must be kicking in. Yesterday was a really crappy day and I'm feeling pretty la-de-dah about it. Well, that's not totally true. Maybe just la-de.

 Well, today sucked. Um, yeah. Let's just leave it at that and start again tomorrow.

 For the first time ever I placed books on hold at the library via the web. I must concede, it's pretty exciting to see the words "Ready for pickup" next to my name!

 So, what happened at urlLink Curves you ask (since the urlLink Gold's guy never called)? Since Robin was in town, I went during lunch on Monday. The joining fee is &#36;49, the monthly fee is &#36;29 if you have it auto-deducted from your account for one year. Or &#36;39 if you want to go month-to-month (but the price may increase). It's a nice little facility tucked away in a strip center. I spoke with the owner/manager who claimed she weighed over 200 lbs. a year ago. She lost it all working out for 30 minutes three times a week and following the Curves diet. Anyhoo. I got in the car. Sniff-Sniff. Got to work, Do I smell? Yes. Called the owner, Do you share a ventilation system with the bar next door? She explained that the smoke seeps through the adjoining wall. They are working with the strip center owners to see if they can seal the wall in some way to fix the problem. Hmmm. 30 minutes of working out while breathing in smoky air. Just my luck. I figure I'll try back in a month or so.

 urlLink msnbc fashion : Now you too can be a Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte, Miranda. "Priorities" is making little tank tops that have your particular "Sex and the City" character affiliation on them. They say "Im a ... Carrie," "...Samantha," "...Miranda," "...Charlotte." From urlLink Shop Intuition : I want a Miranda!!

 A CD I might just have to get. urlLink The Queer Eye for the Straight Guy soundtrack : "All Things (Just Keep Getting Better)," Widelife with Simone Denny "Good Luck," Basement Jaxx featuring Lisa Kekaula "Slow," Kylie Minogue "Move Your Feet," Junior Senior "You Promised Me (Tu Es Foutu)," In Grid "Superstar," Jamelia "Everybody Wants You To Emerge," Fischerspooner vs. Billy Squier "Sunrise," Duran Duran "Never Coming Home (remix)," Sting "An Area Big Enough To Do It In," Prophet Omega "You're So Damn Hot," OK Go "Extraordinary," Liz Phair "Are You Ready for Love (remix)," Elton John Whoot! Billy Squier ??

 urlLink TV Gal : "I know many of you think I can never say a negative word about "Alias" (Sunday, ABC, 9 p.m.), but I was less than shocked by the revelation that Lauren is evil and in cahoots with Sark. Hello. Have we ever for one second thought Lauren was on our side? They never did enough to convince us that she was good and she did always have a very suspect accent. My theory: she and Mr. Sark are siblings. Many of you think she may have brainwashed Vaughn because we all agree that nine months just isn't enough grieving time. This week, Isabella Rossellini guest stars."

 urlLink "Average Joe: Adam Returns"

 Still my favorite urlLink Miranda quote: I know you're probably busy having mind-blowing sex, but I feel you need to know that your good friend, Miranda Hobbs, has just taken a piece of cake out of the garbage and eaten it. You'll probably need this information when you check me into the "Betty Crocker Clinic."

 I saw urlLink Sex and the City tonight. I love that urlLink Miranda is married. In an unrelated way, she uttered the best line of the show, " You are my people." I so get that.

 So what I have is called urlLink Dysthymia . By definition, dysthymia is a chronic form of depression that lasts many years. Frankly, I think I've had it most of my life. According to the definition, some people completely recover, others continue to have some symptoms despite treatment. "Maintenance medication and therapy may be required." Yeah, that would be me. When I was talking about the weight gain with a friend, she suggested I just go off the meds. I told her that I can't. That my depression isn't something that will go away on its own. That it's a chemical imbalance in the brain. Another friend had the immediate reaction of, "Well that sucks. But you can't go off the meds." I guess I'm glad some people see a difference. I've been struggling again for a while now. Today I just had to come home from work. I don't know if it's just because I'm adjusting to increased meds or if it's urlLink SAD or what. I dunno what I am trying to say here. I know I have plateaued before. I know I made it out of that. I only hope it happens again soon.

 A fellow San Antonian: urlLink Beyond Azure , who "skinned" urlLink Kate !

 I'm alive. I promise. My cousin Robin has been here since Sunday. Life will return to urlLink normal again soon.

 According to my urlLink Bad Girl's calendar, we have an official Bad Girl's holiday this week: Man Watchers' Week! January 12-1 is Official Man Watchers' Week! Get the girls together and take to the streets in force. Look men up and down, ogle their body parts, whistle, giggle, guffaw, hiss and make them feel like slabs of meat. If you like to watch, this is your week to celebrate!

 That episode of urlLink Alias was fantastic. Talk about payoff for last season's finale. Yay! Lauren's a bad guy!!

 Whoot. A urlLink Curves has opened 1.5 miles from my house! I go to their site regularly to see if one has and today I hit the jackpot! I will definitely stop by on Monday to find out what their hours and rates are. urlLink Curves in Time Magazine . Today I also spoke with the manager of a urlLink Gold's Gym . Their corporate rate is &#36;99 down and &#36;19.99 a month, with no contract. He's going to call me on Monday so we can get that set-up for my company. I could tell he thought he hit the jackpot when I told him what I do. I am going to follow-up with him too, just because of the variety in classes (yoga!).

 It's interesting to me the number of people who do web searches for Susan. Just Susan . Crazy. Imagine how many Susan's there must be out there!

 Very interesting: urlLink Donate Your Old Furs to Wildlife How do the furs help wildlife? The furs are cut into an appropriate size for the animal, whether it be a chipmunk, raccoon, squirrel, or opossum, and placed inside the animal's enclosure. The furry blanket becomes a surrogate mother to orphaned animals, reducing stress and giving comfort. One rehabilitator related a story about a restless orphaned river otter who chirped constantly. Once she was given a fur blanket, she settled right down. Turning the sleeve of a fur coat inside out, a rehabilitator can also create a warm nest for a burrowing animal such as an opossum. Some animals adopt a piece of fur as a playmate, jumping on it and wrestling with it. Cool. Makes me wish I had a fur to donate.

 o.k., I've started the 2004 booklist. Last night I read urlLink The Day the World Came to Town: 9/11 in Gander, Newfoundland . It was a fast read and really touching how the people of Gander just took in these thousands of people and made them feel at home. I've also finished urlLink The Idiot Girls' Action-Adventure Club . It was o.k. Yes, just just o.k. It's mostly a compilation of urlLink Laurie Notaro's columns. Sure, they seemed to be date order, but they don't really feel like they have any rhyme or reason to them. Although, I really loved "This is a Public Service Announcement." It's about women and restrooms. Hysterical and true! Tonight I will most likely start her other book urlLink Autobiography of a Fat Bride : True Tales of a Pretend Adulthood .

 Today I learned that my body fat percentage and BMI are two totally different things. Whew. Because if my body fat number was my BMI, I should be dead. We went to the Discover store with a few thousand other people in line. They had enough packets for 100 people. We left. We went to the Walk San Antonio forum and got signed up. That's where I learned my true BMI reading. They gave us a chart to complete and we're to get measured again the third Thursday in February. Here goes nothing . . .

 I have given up ever pinging again. I have clicked the appropriate box in my Blogger template, but alas, nothing. Any suggestions?

 Gosh. It is infinitely easier to get up on Saturday mornings. I am up to meet a friend at 9:15 a.m. We're going to walk the mall and then visit the Discover store to sign up for their urlLink National Body Challenge . Truth is I really want to see if the "FREE three-month guest membership to Bally Total Fitness" is really free. Then we are going to a local high school to check out urlLink Walk San Antonio by the Bexar County Community Health Collaborative. They are having a forum where we can learn how we can participate in the Fit City program. Then I am going to try to hit my Godson's basketball game at 1 p.m. Then I really need to come home and clean. No, really. I mean it this time. Company's coming on Monday!

 This is going to sound ugly. But sometimes I feel like my mom competes with me. It's as if she needs to prove to herself that she's as good as me. As smart as me. It's hard to explain. I can't even begin to count the number of times I'll be doing something and she'll take it out of my hands, "Here, let me do that" because I'm not doing it the "right" way. Mind you, I'm not doing it wrong, I'm just not doing it the way she would. Everyone loves my mom. I've often wondered if it's just me or if anyone else ever sees it. Till one day at a large group function. Things weren't turning out perfectly and I heard about it. It's never in a loud ugly way. But it's there. Luckily she was there to "fix" things. One of my friends pulled me aside and said, "Can you do anything right?" I'm pretty sure I hugged her. Not only for noticing, but for saying something to me about it. It wasn't just my imagination after all. Last night I told her about my visit to the doctor. My frustration. This morning she called to tell me that she'd just been to the doctor. That she's lost six pounds. "Without even trying." I know she's just excited. And it is a good thing. But it just felt like one more neener-neener my direction.

 I just keep thinking about my appointment this morning. I feel like I am fighting an uphill battle right now. That I haven't been able to stabilize my weight on the Lexapro ... let alone lose some. And for me, going off the med is not an option. It's just changed my life so much.

 Because he asked if I'd help spread the word and it really is a nice/polite e-mail: Hello, how are you? My name is David and I am a university student from Melbourne, Australia. I came across your site because of your May Day project submission. After browsing through your site, I wondered whether you would like to participate in my personal, non-commercial project called urlLink 'A Picture's Worth' . 'A Picture's Worth' invites visitors to share their story behind a special photograph in 300+ words. Basically, it is a 'show and tell' site that shows a new submission everyday. Things have been going well since it's beginning in August last year but I constantly struggle to gather enough visitors and submissions whilst I strive to allow the site to grow. Hence, I was wondering whether there is a photograph amongst your collection that you might be inspired to write about in 300+ words. There's also no limit on the number of submissions. I understand that it might be a hectic time of year so I'm not real rush and feel free to take your time. It certainly is important to me that you enjoy the experience if you're interested in participating. I'd encourage you to have a look at the site as well just to see whether it interests you. It would also be fantastic if you could spread the word to anyone you know who might be interested in reading or making submissions. Basically, most of the contributors so far have come to the site through word of mouth as the site is still very small. So go check it out!

 I went to the doctor today to talk about the urlLink Lexapro . We also reviewed my weight. In the 20 months I have been on an antidepressant, I have gained 23 pounds . Count 'em people, 23 pounds . Mind you, I was not a skinny minnie in the first place. Yes, I'd heard the rumors that antidepressants caused weight gain. But I was so happy on urlLink Celexa , I obviously didn't care. Now, being not so happy on Lexapro, I care. Lexapro is an SSRI, which is different from other anti-depressants. urlLink Wellbutrin is an anti-depressant that supposedly causes weight loss, but it's too different from what I take/need now. What's a girl to do? Apparently get off her ass and exercise. Crap. She concurred that urlLink South Beach is a great way to lose weight. A good way of eating. So that's good. Damn the exercise.

 urlLink TV Gal Lets Others Speak for Her "There are two things you need to know. First: I was so in love with you it nearly killed me. Second: I don't regret moving on with my life," Vaughn to Sydney on "Alias." "Michael Vaughn is just a boy who was never good enough for you." Jack to Sydney on "Alias." "I want that bitch dead." Dixon to Sydney about Evil Francie on "Alias." "If we end up sharing a cell in federal prison, I'm not giving you a drawer." Weiss to Vaughn on "Alias." "You do have an oven, you know.

 I've been very excited by the prospect of my urlLink favorite author being in the urlLink draft stages of her third novel. And now, more news on the movie of urlLink Good in Bed .

 urlLink Scott Stapp is a stoopid poker player.

 I had a really good session with my therapist today. We talked a lot about the foster situation. Don't count me out on that one yet. I found some whole wheat bagels tonight. I had one as a snack as I made chili ( urlLink it's cold! ). It tasted orgasmically good. The books I ordered a week ago came in ( urlLink The Idiot Girls' Action-Adventure Club , urlLink Autobiography of a Fat Bride and urlLink The Good Carb Cookbook ). Yay! Something to read tonight! Plus, I took back a calendar someone at work gave me and got a &#36;15 B&N store credit. More free books towards my urlLink New Year's Resolution ! Right now? I'm going to post on the urlLink South Beach forum , then curl up with some chili and watch the final elimination round of the urlLink Celebrity Poker Showdown . Too bad the urlLink Fab Five is a rerun ( love it : Cheers, queers!)

 Run, right now and tune your TV to urlLink A&E for urlLink Airline . This show is hysterical and heartbreaking at the same time. There is another episode on at 9:30 p.m.

 I don't know whether to laugh or to cry. My urlLink Tanita BF679 Duo Scale Plus Body Fat Monitor came in today. I got it set up and the first readings done. Yeah. I think crying is in order.

 Note to self: Just because you have a moratorium on buying books doesn't mean you can buy magazines to fill the void.

 I've spent a lot of time thinking about it and decided to not attend the January classes to become a foster parent. You know, there's a reason I'm not married and have kids now. O.k., maybe they are two separate issues. When I was younger I didn't want kids. I still don't want kids. I never had the ticking clock or the buzzing alarm with an inherent maternal desire to have a baby. Never. I've had my thoughts of Oh, how sweet. I want one of those . But those moments are long forgotten before I finish my meal or get in the car. I'm selfish. I love my alone time. Maybe a little too much. I can't imagine integrating a kid into my life. I can barely get myself to work (let alone on time) in the morning. Get a baby or toddler up and to day-care too? I know what it takes. I've done it already. Ten years ago I lived with two boys. Both under five. Sometimes I was the only caretaker around. I got them up, dressed, to school. Picked them up in the afternoon, played, did dinner, baths and bedtime. It was hard. And rewarding. I imagine my life as it is now and wonder how I would do it. Take on the responsibility. Meals, baths, crying at night. When would I blog? Read? What if I wanted to go somewhere at 9 p.m.? How would I travel anymore? I want to sleep late and go to Starbucks by myself. And my depression. It's not been behaving lately (I made an appointment with my doctor for Thursday). And then I think, How selfish. You have so much to offer a child with nothing. You'd make a good foster parent. You'd step up to the plate and do what needed to be done. Even if you lost a little of yourself in the process. And I would get so much in return. Wet kisses. Eyes of adoration. Laughing hugs. Love. But could my heart withstand the trauma of losing another child? Having to leave the boys 'bout near killed me and took many, many years to get over. Can I do that again? Would it be different? Could I separate the caregiver me from the loving me? Would my heart survive? Yes, I know it would. It's basically the selfish me that keeps me from proceeding. The one not yet ready to give up her "freedom." Sad. But true.

 Boy, you can find hearts just about everywhere. Even on Mars.

 Remember what I said a few weeks ago about my legs? Well, I haven't done anything on that front yet. And today I wore shorts all day long. Even to the store. Perhaps I should file this under Why I'm So Single .

 In less than an hour, the first of the last eight episodes of urlLink Sex in the City debuts. ::sniffle:: I'm gonna miss those girls.

 I've been doing a lot of posting this morning over at urlLink Diet Blog . Go check it out.

 The urlLink Friday Five on Sunday: What one thing are you most looking forward to . . . 1. ...today? A cleaner house. Hitting the grocery store for some good food [read: healthy]. 2. ...over the next week? My friends coming back to work after the holidays. 3. ...this year? My mom's 80th birthday! 4. ...over the next five years? Turning 40 and growing more into who I am. 5. ...for the rest of your life? Hmm. My Godson graduating from high school came first, then my friend Sandy becoming a grandma came second.

 I think Cory has a spirit friend. On a couple of occasions, I've heard her "talking" away. When I look for her, I find her talking to nothing. The wall. Up towards the ceiling. But her tone is so clear. It's like no way she ever talks to me. It comes more from her throat. It's not purring, it's not meowing. It's something different. She is the best gift I received in 2003. She brings me laughter and joy everyday. I love to hear her purr. I love to feel the reverberations of her purrs when she lays on the bed. She is like no other cat I've ever had. She reminds me of a dog in the way she follows me around. It doesn't matter if she is dead asleep, if I'm getting a drink of water in the kitchen when I turn around she is there. It's very sweet. Except for when she plays attack cat and I want to throttle her. But other than that, I love her very much.

 It's Saturday, January 3 and I am wearing capri pants and sandals. Who says we don't need to worry about global warming??

 Wow. That's weird. That January 2004 over there in the archives.

 I'm guessing it's bad to use wine to take my allergy medicine, huh? I'm really struggling with my urlLink mayfly project . Even though 2002 was a huge struggle, it ended hopefully. With 2003 being full of potential. And it started out that way. Many months of hopefulness that seem to have gotten lost along the way. Things feel unfulfilled. Disjointed. I had meaningful moments, good travels, many books and Cory. But I feel doubt. Disappointment. [later] I'd be remiss to not mention the piercing / tattoo somehow too.

 Happy urlLink Leap Year Day!

 I've been thinking for a while now about painting my bedroom brown. I think I saw a really cool room on Trading Spaces once and it just stuck with me. Last night at Lowe's I picked up all the shades of brown they had. I took them into my room and held them up against the wall. I dunno, brown is brown is brown, right? Then I had a brilliant idea. I put my chips back in my bag to take with me to see this guy ... That's right folks, that's urlLink Vern Yip of urlLink Trading Spaces . He spoke at a Home & Garden Show today. Let me tell you. He is as cute in person as he is on TV. He is funny, charming, gracious and down-to-earth. Sad news though, this is his last season on Trading Spaces and he has only taped four shows! Two of which have aired already and the other two will run closer to the end of the season. The great news ... Vern is getting his own show on NBC!! urlLink Design Intervention is looking for families who bought a home that needed a little renovation, but has turned into a nightmare (financially, time wise, etc...). And yes, they are accepting applications now! He spoke about 30 minutes and then sat down for autographs and "other questions." So, I got in line. With my brown paint chips. Oh.Yes.I.Did. He did an autograph for mom first and then I laid my samples out on his table. Vern, I would like to paint my bedroom brown. I have hardwood floors and five windows. White ceiling and white trim. He ixnayed some for having too much red. Another few for too much yellow ("yellow in the bedroom makes it hard to sleep," he said). He chose three browns for me: That's right folks, Vern Yip picked the color I am going to paint my bedroom. Vern Yip!!! Oh, and I had him autograph the back of the choices for me! Being the girl that I am, I gushed, You're a doll! He looked at me for a few moments with a "She looks relatively harmless" kind of face and then he laughed, "Thanks!" While we were furniture shopping later, I was still gushing over Vern. Finally mom said, "Well, I think he's gay." Well, I don't. But it did plant a seed. When I got home I did an "Is Vern Yip gay?" search. I found sites and articles affirming both. I think I am going to go with an article in the urlLink Honolulu Star-Bulletin : Q: Single? A: I'm not married, let's put it that way. I hope to be at some point , just right now things are so crazy, it's a lot of time on the road. I love design, but the one thing I feel passionate about more so than design is having a family someday . It's just finding the time to do it. Yeah, I know that could still go either way. And it's not like we'd ever hook up. I just like living in the land of denial!

 I am so a urlLink quirkyalone .

 Cory Oy. My baby isn't such a baby any more!

 I'm really pissed off. I'm a smart person. I don't understand why I can't get this to work!!!!!! I am trying to update my Nikon firmware because the battery indicator shows that my battery is almost empty even though I just recharged it. There's an update available. These are the steps: Download and expand the firmware files Format an approved CF card in the camera Connect Camera to computer (in MSC USB mode) or use a CF Card Reader Copy to the top level of the card the downloaded "firmware" folder (which contains the "firmware.bin" file) Disconnect camera from computer Start camera in "Setup" Mode with the "Delete" button pressed Follow the camera's on-screen menus At completion of upgrade restart camera (in Shooting mode) Re-format Card I've followed the steps exactly like a dozen times and it's not working. DAMMIT! I am very frustrated.

 I thought this was a nice quote from the February urlLink Sark eLetter: Don't ask yourself what the world needs. Ask yourself what makes you come alive, and then go and do that. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive. ~ Harold Whitman

 I love the Weekend Project in my urlLink Bad Girl calendar: Getting the Cute Guy I want to meet big, strong guys who know how to cook Set off fire alarms and wait around for the firemen to arrive

 I've really been trying to give urlLink ER the benefit of the doubt this year. But when I saw the commercial of the tank heading for the hospital I decided, No more .

 I visit the urlLink Prevention SBD Forum every day. Regardless if I am eating SBD-friendly or not (I am now). A group of us that started on the same day have named ourselves and we "talk" to each other every day. I probably know more about what's going on in the lives of our group than with some of my friends. We know each other's children's names. We remember when someone had a special occasion or a doctor appointment. We want to hear the good (and some times awful) news. They We are the epitome of what a support group should be. We encourage, play "cheerleader" and applaud each other. But, we also tell it like it is and most of us don't mince words (we do know who we can push and who we need to be gentle with). I think I've been talking more there lately because someone talks back to me ( usually in a good way). I've talked about my struggles at work and with the depression. About a meeting that turned ugly and med issues. They've listened to me whine and have given me nothing but encouragement and support. They were kind to me long after I would've started skipping my posts. And now, they've noticed that I've started feeling better -- I think because I've getting sassy again. And I'm glad for that. To see some progress. It's my turn to play "cheerleader" again.

 urlLink Prince is going urlLink on tour . *sigh* I sure wish he was coming to my town!

 Whew. Cory was more like her old self this morning. Not quite 100%, but she's getting there. Thank goodness. I was really worried last night. I even looked up the closest 24-hour vet just in case.

 I'm worried about Cory. She acted really lethargic this morning and is still somewhat the same tonight. Usually she runs around like a crazy woman when I get home. It looks like she hasn't eaten all day. Can't tell with the water bowl. I put out her favorite snacks and even some watered down milk, but she turned up her nose. Her litter box looks normal. Her nose doesn't feel warm. She purred when I pet her, but just doesn't seem like her usual cranky self. Is this worth a visit to the vet today or do I wait? (Added later: The vet's office was closed. If she's still this way in the morning I will call when I get up.)

 Amazing. Stunning. Breathtaking. Torturous. Powerful. urlLink The Passion of the Christ moved me to my very soul last night. It was everything I expected and wanted it to be. As we sat in the theater as credits rolled I thought, This is the best movie I have ever seen . I don't know if that holds true today, but I would see it again. I grew up in a Lutheran church and attended kindergarten through sixth grade in the church school. The movie strictly followed the gospels I was raised on. I haven't attended church in many years, but I knew what the next scene was going to be. I knew what the words should be before they said them. I cried. A lot. I started crying after Peter denied Jesus the third time and cried pretty much through the rest of the movie. I cried because I believe Jesus is my Savior. I believe he died on the cross for my salvation. I just didn't know what that really meant until last night. The torture/beating scenes were horrific and painful to watch. I assure you I averted my eyes more than once. It is graphic. Shocking. It will take your breath away. But even though it lasted about 45 minutes, it wasn't more than I could handle. The theater was eerily quiet. At times you could've heard a pin drop. At others there were collective gasps of disbelief and horror. And crying. Lots of crying. I believe this is a significant movie for the Christian population. Do I think you should see it? If you are a Christian and understand the Gospels (there's not much background to the story and it starts in the Garden of Gethsemane) I think you should. I think you should see it with someone you love. I think you should be prepared to be totally wiped out afterwards. Emotionally and physically (my jaw hurt from clenching my teeth). I'm telling you this is a hard movie to watch. But so worth it. We know the story. We know how it ends. Jesus rises on the third day and ascends into heaven. For me, I believe there is a happy ending.

 Tonight I am going to see urlLink The Passion of the Christ . I may feel up to a review afterwards and I may not.

 That was the best episode of urlLink Sex And The City ever . It really was the perfect ending. Perfect.

 Can you say holy crap: urlLink Schwarzenegger, a native of Austria, said in a television interview he would support rescinding the constitutional rule that only U.S. citizens born in the United States can become president. Um, yeah, consider that to be my first political statement on this blog.

 So, have many of you gotten this e-mail this week? Today is International Very Good Looking Smart People Day, so please send this message to someone you think fits this description. Please do not send it back to me as I have already received it over fifty thousand times and my inbox is jammed full! I haven't gotten it 50,000 times, but I have gotten it three times. That's good, right?

 Mkay. So I rolled out of bed about 15 minutes ago. It really is the muscle relaxant. I've not been taking them during the day, just at night. Yesterday's sleep issue was having taken one at 3:30 a.m. or so. I have another Cory story for the guy who asked about peeing standing up. Cory also gets boogers. And since I figure a cat can't pick her own nose, I do it for her. I figure she'll be able to breath better once it's gone, right? So I pick her up and we struggle. Of course, I always win, but sometimes she puts up a good fight. Her boogers are black. Big, black boogers. Sometimes it shocks me how much I pull out. I wonder how she could breath at all. Maybe one day I'll take a picture and post it here. Then I drop her to the floor and she attacks my foot to let me know how mad she is. P.S. I checked with the Vet, there's nothing wrong with black boogers.

 I can't believe I'm tired. I slept till 9:30 a.m., napped from 12-1:45 p.m. and again from 4:30-5:30 p.m. This evening mom and I went to the urlLink San Antonio Stock Show and Rodeo to see urlLink Willie Nelson . The old guy sounded pretty good. And now I'm off to bed!

 Any urlLink Monk fans? I'm a latecomer to the series, but just love it. Tony Shalhoub is perfect as the obsessive-compulsive urlLink Adrian Monk . He just makes me laugh with that quirky manner. And I just adore Bitty Schram as urlLink Sharona Fleming . She's the perfect straight [wo]man to Monk. Plus, everytime they say her name I think, urlLink Ma Ma Ma My Sharona ! Really, if you're home on a Friday night [like me], you should watch it! Speaking of which ... it's almost time!

 I've been reading the books of urlLink Michael Lee West . Right now I'm in the last third of urlLink Consuming Passions, A Food-Obsessed Life . It is chock full of southern-style recipes that make my mouth water. Really, it's so bad that last night I had to get out of bed to find a snack!

Coke what is your favorite sport to watch on tv? The fourth quarter of a Spurs/Lakers game.

 The minute my pee hits the toilet water I hear her coming. Ga-lump, ga-lump, ga-lump. Then there's a huge leap with a crash landing on my lap. Petting is immediately required. It's our routine. In the morning. When I come home at night. Yeah, and just basically anytime I go to the bathroom. Mom was over not too long ago. I asked if Cory was in the bathroom with her. She said, "Yes, but she keep trying to jump up." Well, let her , I said. It's even worse when I pull the milk carton out of the fridge. It doesn't matter where she is in the house. The minute she hears me pull off the lid I can hear her claws scraping on the floor. She runs so fast she has to throw out the brakes to turn corners. One flying leap onto the counter and then the battle continues. Occasionally I slip her a sip, but mostly she tries to knock me down so she can have the entire glass for herself. Forget sitting down on the couch or taking a glass with me to bed. Yep, now I drink my milk standing up. Thank God she doesn't have her front claws or she's climb me like Elsie the Cow.

 The urlLink Friday Five . On an actual Friday and everything. When was the last time you... 1. ...went to the doctor? Heh. Which doctor? I saw my primary care doctor on Saturday. My psychologist on Tuesday and my newly acquired psychiatrist on Wednesday. 2. ...went to the dentist? November or December of last year. 3. ...filled your gas tank? Tuesday. I paid $1.48/gallon. When I drove by on Wednesday it was $1.55/gallon. 4. ...got enough sleep? Last weekend. 5. ...backed up your computer? We're supposed to do that??

 I've been surprised by the number of hits I've received from people asking, "What does dooced mean?"

 I've been meaning to discuss my urlLink Bad Girl crush on urlLink Dave Navarro , but after urlLink his colonic enema last night I'm not so sure ...

 That massage really did wonders. I am pretty much walking back at my old speed, so of course I walked too much at lunch time and am now looking forward to an evening on the couch. I went today without the Skelaxin and Celebrex, although I may take both later tonight. It was funny yesterday when my mom came by post massage and muscle relaxant and mid-nap. We'd agreed to go out for dinner. She watched me stumble around changing clothes and then said, "I'll drive." It made me laugh.

 I left work early today and got a massage. I feel loads better. I think I've gotten to the point where I need to stop the Skelaxin/Celebrex because it makes me wanna nap. Which really isn't a good thing to do at work. I did take the Skelaxin when I got home to see if it would help with the massage. Laid down with an ice pack and passed out. You know it hurts when you can't even feel the ice pack.

 Today I went to a psychiatric hospital. Where the crazy people are. Under lock and key and camera. It hit me hard in a, Why the hell am I here? kind of way. The psychiatrist talked with me for about 45 minutes before suggesting we add Wellbutrin XL (150 mg) to my regular Lexapro (20 mg). It's really hard to accept being on two meds. She believes the Wellbutrin will help with mental clarity. However I am back in a place where I hate having to be on meds. Or maybe this is the first time I've felt this way. And maybe that will go away once things start clicking again. I sure hope so.

 I'm tired.

 If you have HBO and especially if you are a woman, you must watch urlLink Iron Jawed Angel . urlLink Alice Paul is my new hero.

 When I visit my favorite blogs, I like to choose a link or two from their blogroll to read something new. This morning I found urlLink one that read : MissJenJen has been Dooced. This site is OFFLINE. And I thought, Bummer, she got fired . Only in blogworld can urlLink Dooced mean getting fired for your blog.

 Julian Sark. I like it. I also like the man in front of the man. Sloane as Syd's father? Not a huge surprise. Three weeks until the next episode? Disappointing.

 As we left my favorite Indian restaurant, I said aloud, I am so relieved I can walk today . Mom concurred. I think we were both separately pretty worried after how I looked and felt yesterday. Then we hit Target. Yes, I know shopping was not on the doctor's list of "things to do" but I collect hearts and the day after Valentine's Day is my special shopping day. In the end, I didn't find much and was pretty tired by the time we left. I just got up from a nap. Oh, and with all of the my-back-hurts hullabaloo, I forgot to mention we had snow in San Antonio yesterday. Sure it was only .8 of an inch and it didn't stick, but that counts as snow San Antonio style!

 Oh Thank God. I can walk upright today. Truly I was worried when the doctor told me it would be worse today. Yes, my wrists hurt from attempting to stop the fall, and I am still walking like a person whose back hurts ... but I am so glad to have made the progress overnight that I did. Really, I slept dressed ~ just in case I couldn't get up this morning and had to have help getting out of bed (yes, it was that bad!).

 I fell out of bed this morning. I wish I had some exotic or hilarious story to tell, but I don't. It does involve a lamp, a cat and one not-so-awake me. I landed on my keester and ended up at the doctor's office several hours later (thank heavens for Saturday hours). She gave me Celebrex and Skelaxin. It hurts like hell and I'm walking like an old, old lady. Like 90. I'm not to drive or leave the house. I can't pick anything up. Wouldn't you know it's a gorgeous holiday weekend too?? And, lucky me , she says it will be worse tomorrow.

 Cool! One my favorites, urlLink Put Down the Donut is mentioned in the March issue of urlLink Lifetime magazine. Two women's quest to shed some major pounds and keep their sanity. The daily post are hilarious, and be sure to check out the yummy recipes. Congratulations Joelle and Kathy!

 So, here's one thing I need to change. I go forever without buying any music and then buy three in one spree. Now, which do I listen to first, the longest, etc... urlLink I bought urlLink Jason Mraz for urlLink You and I Both . urlLink I bought urlLink Evanescence because I recently heard and loved, My Immortal. I can tell by my quick sampling of the CD, that it's not my usual fare, but I really like the song. urlLink And, I bought the soundtrack for urlLink Queer Eye for the Straight Guy because I love the show. It makes me wanna go to the best gay club in town and dance my ass off. [later] urlLink Carson chats about the "Queer" soundtrack

 Another "How inner city is it?" post. The grocery store nearest my house has porty-potties outside the two main entrances. Tonight I actually saw a man pull up and go inside one.

 I have mentioned here that I live in the inner city. This is one of those "How inner city is it?" posts. We have a rooster. I say we because when it crows, we all know it. Yesterday it started about 5:30 a.m. Today it was 4:10 a.m. After a few crows, I thought I heard another rooster answering in the distance. I'm pretty sure he was calling back, "Shut the hell up can't you see it's still dark??" Because our rooster stopped and started back up about 6 a.m.

 You absolutely must read this by Dooce: urlLink A Heartbreaking Work of Super Pooping Genius And on a totally different note, urlLink Friends vs. Aquaintances by Emmie.

 After watching her on Larry King Live tonight, I'd say Anna Nicole is much-o slimmer, but she's still a ding-dong.

 My third cousin Sanoe in the snow. Yeah, her mom Autumn sent me this one because she knew how jealous seeing the snow would make me!

 My Godson Antonio This is a smile that just lights my heart with love. He just looks so proud of losing that front tooth!

 Where I am is where Cory wants to be. On the toilet? She's on my lap. On the couch? She's lying next to me or on me or touching me in some way. It took a lot of work for her to understand laying on my keyboard while I'm typing is unacceptable. So she sleeps as close as she can. Between the monitor and the printer. Yeah, poor thing. She is so sleep deprived.

 I am hooked on this urlLink Scrabble game . Tonight I scored 381 and had only five tiles left: e, e, e, q and z. [later] Another game. Score: 416. Tiles: g, w, t, and t.

 The urlLink Friday Five : 1. What's the most daring thing you've ever done? When I was in college I was pretty daring, but I'm going to go with the current decade. I would have to say going to London with someone I'd urlLink met once . 2. What one thing would you like to try that your mother/friend/significant other would never approve of? I can't think of one single thing I'd like to do that my family and friends wouldn't support me on. 3. On a scale of 1-10, what's your risk factor? (1=never take risks, 10=it's a lifestyle) These days I'd say I'm a 5. 4. What's the best thing that's ever happened to you as a result of being bold/risky? I had a great time in London. 5. ... and what's the worst? A small-ish broken heart.

 I am going to walk in the Race for the Cure on March 27. I have participated some how every year (minus one) since the walk started in San Antonio. I am a firm believer in the Susan G. Komen foundation and also volunteer for their education committee. Geez, this is starting to sound like a pitch! Truth is, I am just so excited about how they mainstreamed their walker registration this year. Everything is online. They've also made it super easy to develop a "sponsor me" page for each walker to solicit donations. I've made mine and set a goal of the minimum donation request of &#36;125. I just set it up Friday afternoon and I have already surpass my goal! I know really great people!

 I haven't been keeping up with my book list this week. I have finished urlLink Dog Handling and urlLink Ralph's Party . I liked Dog Handling quite a bit. I wouldn't want to be invited to Ralph's Party. I also blew through urlLink Knight At Dawn and urlLink Dinosaurs Before Dark to keep a promise to my friend Michele. She wants help writing a series for children similar to this one. I'm not sure her vision is unique enough to warrant it. Right now I am working on urlLink Joy School . I really like urlLink Elizabeth Berg .

 I just couldn't resist taking this last night once I saw Cory sitting so close to the supposed spray that will keep cats off of furniture and other surfaces. Ha. I was feeling a little guilty this morning after remembering that Marley's owner not only make sure she has fresh food and water (I do that), but also make sure her urlLink favorite toys are available for play. So I pulled out the chair that most toys seem to hide under (unintentional? I'm not so sure) and found nine, yes, nine toys. I took more than half and hid them in a safe spot so I can dole them out as necessary.

 I'm posting this morning because I didn't wake up in time to go to the shelter. I kept hitting the snooze button. Maybe I was children-ed out from a volunteer thing yesterday. I worked from 1-4 p.m. at the urlLink Hallmark Kaleidoscope . And when I say worked, I mean worked . Even post shower I still have an eau du crayon about me. I do feel like I am missing out on something the weekends I don't make it to the shelter. Those kids are so sweet. So full of life and joy. So trusting. I just can't imagine what happened in their short lives to have them placed in a shelter. The caregivers are so good about getting the children to lay down without being rocked. Many of them you just place them in their criband they go right to sleep. I know it's a good thing for when they are placed in foster care. But last week one boy kept crying so I pulled him back out of his crib and rocked him about a minute before he passed out. Feeling the weight of his body on mine. Feeling his complete trust in me. It's just amazing.

 We can only hope . . . urlLink Carson Daly: Breast might be "straw that broke the camel's back"

 I just read an article in the New York Times about the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court's 4-to-3 decision establishing gay marriage. I have a pretty good vocabulary, but I had to get out the dictionary twice for the same article!

 I went to a funeral Monday. The organist/choir director from the church I grew up in. Someone I'd known 33 years. She wasn't someone I was close to. It was one of those funerals you attend out of respect. For the person. Her contributions. Her family. Her friends. The people of my mother's generation are dying. I saw an old friend there. He had very little to say. The last time I saw him, urlLink he looked away . I thought in the car on the way back to work about how his attitude hurt my feelings. We were friends once. And then I heard a song on the radio and the words jumped out at me. I just figured out urlLink today who it's by: YOU & I BOTH words & music by urlLink jason mraz Was it you who spoke the words that things would happen but not to me Oh things are gonna happen naturally And taking your advice I'm looking on the bright side And balancing the whole thing But often times those words get tangled up in lines And the bright lights turn to night Until the dawn it brings A little bird who'll sing about the magic that was you and me Cause you and I both loved What you and I spoke of What you and I spoke of Others only dream of the love that I love See I'm all about them words Over numbers, unencumbered numbered words Hundreds of pages, pages, pages forwards More words then I had ever heard and I feel so alive Now you and I, you and I Not so little you and I anymore And with this silence brings a moral story more importantly evolving is the glory of a boy you and I both loved what you and I spoke of and others just read of and if you could see now well I'm already finally out of and it's okay if you have go away just remember the telephone works both ways and if I never ever hear it ring if nothing else I'll think the bells inside have finally found you someone else and that's okay cause I'll remember everything you sang you and I both loved what you and I spoke of and others just read of and if you could see now well I'm already finally out of words. I guess that's us. Finally out of words.

 My initial response to the Janet Jackson unveiling during the Super Bowl was What the hell? But here's a real what the hell!! : urlLink After Flash of Flesh, CBS Again Is in Denial (New York Times, free registration required) "Wardrobe malfunction" was the term Justin Timberlake used to explain why he bared Janet Jackson's breast at the end of their Super Bowl duet. Like "erectile dysfunction," a term used in halftime advertisements for Cialis, it was a somewhat startling euphemism. But down in the article, I found this distressing: Her sudden flare of pre-Grammy attention and publicity came at a slight cost. Perhaps the one moment of honesty in that coldly choreographed tableau was when the cup came off and out tumbled what looked like a normal middle-aged woman's breast instead of an idealized Playboy bunny implant. A normal middle-aged woman's breast???? Good Lord, the woman is 37-years-old!!! That's a year younger than me! Middle-aged?? What the hell??

 urlLink Janet Jackson apologizes, takes blame for breast stunt "The decision to have a costume reveal at the end of my halftime show performance was made after final rehearsals," Jackson said Monday in a statement. "MTV was completely unaware of it. It was not my intention that it go as far as it did. I apologize to anyone offended -- including the audience, MTV, CBS and the NFL."

 I was just talking with my friend Michele and she asked, "So, did you watch the boob tube last night?"

 Well, I went back and answered all of the e-mail except for two. So if you didn't get an e-mail from me tonight you know you're one of the two.

 I find I am reading at a much faster rate now that the books are free than when I paid for them. Yep. That was eight books in January.

 I have gotten really bad with my correspondence. I owe people e-mails from December. I'm not really sure what it is. Usually I write back "too fast" and now I can't eke out a meager reply. My cousin sends me pictures of her beautiful baby and I can't take a moment to tell her how gorgeous she is. On Friday I finally mailed a thank you note to an old neighbor who hand stitched a huge quilt for me (it was a Christmas gift). Really, I should be embarrassed. It is stunningly beautiful and took hours upon hours to complete. Something that will become a family keepsake. *sigh* I continue to be flummoxed by this depression. It's weird what it picks to debilitate for me. I am feeling better, but not happier. Dr. Logan and I use numbers to gauge how I'm doing because "fine" can cover a multitude of sins. I'm about a 6 out of 10. Flat. But better than the 4 I felt earlier in the month. I have an appointment with the psychiatrist to talk meds on Feb. 18. I have a letter from my primary doctor recommending my insurance allow me to return to Celexa (which they don't cover any more). I am up to 20 mgs of Lexapro now. It's nice to finally see some options, but it's just not moving fast enough for my taste. Oh, and there were no good ads in the classifieds today. Erm. Yeah. I forget what all this has to do with correspondence, but I know it's connected.

 I just couldn't resist . . . urlLink TV Gal : "This year's Golden Globes gave me a lot to think about. Like did Brittany Murphy and Ashton Kutcher exchange pleasantries back stage? And how could Brittany be in love with Ashton last January and engaged to someone else this January? That's love Michael Vaughn style." That's love Michael Vaughn style. Bwahahaha! That's a good one!

 How'd Beyonace do with the National anthem? I was intently watching the poker tournament on NBC when I switched over to bowl coverage at 5 p.m. I just woke up five minutes ago. I am too interested in the Super Bowl. ;-)

 Yes, I'm still up. Can you believe it? Too much Scrabble. I'm off to bed so I can get up for the shelter in the morning.

 Man, I don't remember the last time I played urlLink Scrabble .

 Tonight was knitting night. I am no longer the worst knitter in the class. I am now second worst! : )

 I received this from a Komen friend today and thought I would share: Philippians 4:13 I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me. The road to success is not straight. There is a curve called Failure, a loop called Confusion, speed bumps called Friends, red lights called Enemies, caution lights called Family. You will have flats called Jobs. But, if you have a spare called Determination, an engine called Perseverance, insurance called Faith, a driver called Jesus, you will make it to a place called Success.

 So, any guesses as to the exact moment my mouth fell open during urlLink Alias on Sunday?

 Yesterday was a Monday all day long. I was exhausted when I got home, so I planted myself on the couch and watched about three hours of urlLink The Real World/Road Rules Challenge: The Inferno . Man, why is Coral such a bitch?

 Last night I bought urlLink Stitch 'N Bitch: The Knitter's Handbook by urlLink Debbie Stoller of urlLink Bust fame. I learned that if my cast on is too tight to use two needles to cast on. Then you slide out the second needle and voila ~ your row is just right for knitting! With the help of the clear illustrations, I was able to "get" the knit and finish a few rows before napping. I've been meaning to comment about how much I am loving urlLink Under the Duvet: Shoes, Reviews, Having the Blues, Builders, Babies, Families and Other Calamities . If you enjoy urlLink Marian Keyes , this autobiographical compilation of her writing is a must read.

 My little princess is still at the shelter. She is just the sweetest thing. Course, me showering her with kisses probably doesn't hurt either. I joked with them all today that if I had a big enough bag I would smuggle her out of there and did they think anyone would notice. They just laughed. One of the volunteers from last week came back. And apparently she had been there during the week too. Really, I don't like the competition. I sat down on the floor to play a while. Then she sat a few feet away and started singing some song (she used to work in a day care ~ she looks about 24-26 range) and all the kids gravitated to her. I noticed one fellow away from the group crying, so I went off to hold him. I told mom I see myself as the nurturer. That I can sit and hold an upset kid for as long as they need (hence the scabies kid). So after that I held Nemo (obviously not his real name, but that's what we call him) for a while. And another guy who was upset that he got banged around by another kid. Each week I help get the toddlers in the high chairs for lunch and then I go tidy up the playroom. Some days it seems like they pull out every single toy, ball and book. Today was one of those days. Post lunch, I held the new girl. Poor thing. This is the hardest time I've seen a child have coming in. She is still so scared. Most seem to take no time at all to settle down. I held her for a long time, so my little one was sound asleep as I prepared to leave. I walked over and gave her a kiss anyway. Cause next week she might not be there.

 The block meeting was so much fun. I got everything out of it I hoped for. I met the catty-corner girl (Thelma) and the woman who I got into a urlLink biding war with over another house (Jennifer). It was so nice to meet people like me who love this neighborhood and want to see it grow and flourish. There were about 20 in attendance. A poor turnout I think, but the safety officer said it was a good one. He gave us very good information about things the police department can do for us for free. I also signed up for urlLink Cellular on Patrol training. I was surprised to learn that an area three streets over is working to become a historic district. That could be good and bad news for us. Technically we could be considered historical too, but then any renovations you make to your home have to be approved, etc... The girls and I had lots of fun chatting and DuWayne (yes, I've been misspelling his name all this time) joined in. We were the younger, single group of the crowd. I thanked our two sponsors profusely. We all agreed to do something on urlLink National Night Out . In the meantime, one of our hosts is going to get the information for us to be urlLink COP s.

 Well crap. Apparently one of the kids I rocked to sleep has urlLink scabies . Um, hello? I know she was new and needed to be acclimated, but why wasn't she quarantined?? The microscopic mite that causes scabies can barely be seen by the human eye. A tiny, eight-legged creature with a round body, the mite burrows within the skin. Within several weeks the patient develops an allergic reaction. This results in severe itching, often intense enough to keep sufferers awake all night. Human scabies is almost always caught from another person by close contact. Attracted to warmth and odor, the female mite burrows into the skin, lays eggs, and produces secretions that cause allergic reactions. Larvae, or newly hatched mites, travel to the skin surface, lying in shallow pockets where they will develop into adult mites. If the mite is scratched off the skin, it can live in bedding up to 24 hours. It may be up to a month before a newly infested person will notice the itching, especially in people with good hygiene and who bathe regularly. Crap. Crap. Crap. I am itching already!! I know, I know. The Shelter would never put the kids in a position to catch it, but still. *scratch*scratch*

 I am not a college b-ball fan by any means, but even I was shocked that urlLink St. Joe's ain't coming to town next weekend.

 I've wanted to be involved in my neighborhood since I moved here. I just couldn't figure out how. Yes, the City could tell me I had a association, but no, they didn't have any contact info. Finally I received a notice of an association meeting earlier in the month, so I've hit two meetings since then! I really want to be involved. This is an older neighborhood and I want to do my part to see that there is revitalization. Then, two weeks ago I received an invitation to a block party meeting (Dayne and Dwayne were teasing me about showing up with a keg of beer ~ it's a meeting , they said). I am probably too excited. I am looking forward to meeting my neighbors. They are going to have a police officer there to talk about a Neighborhood Cellular Patrol we could implement. They are also setting up safety home inspections that could lead to a 10% discount on my homeowners insurance. I really do want to meet the other two single women who live nearby. I know, I could've walked over and introduced myself ... Anyway, I hope a lot of people come. We are having hot dogs & hamburgers and pot luck. I'm taking chocolate cupcakes with cream cheese icing.

 Me, Linda, Kelly and Kristy Sisters Mom, Aunt Patsy and Uncle Fagan This morning was Race for the Cure. Then we had breakfast with my family. I'm off to shower, nap and make cupcakes for tonight's block meeting.

 Let's see ... I left the house this morning talking to Karla on my cell. We talked all the way to work, so I thought I would finish the conversation in the car while I put on some lipstick. Um, yeah. Left my purse at home. Called my mom to get my Aunt's cell number again so I can call her later (the scrap of paper with the number is in my purse). Mom says she'll bring my purse to me. Until she can't find this second purse she carries around with her (don't ask), which has my house keys in it and her spare key to leave for my Aunt and Uncle. I asked Gloria if she had any Avon lipstick samples (I knew she would), so at least I had bright lips. Then I borrowed lunch money from Rita. The Aunt and Uncle call and profess they are far away still and I shouldn't leave early on account of them. However, mom has an appointment with her oncologist and we don't know how long that will take. So I drive to mom's house and leave my key to her house under a plant. Then I drive to my house to get my purse. I arrive at the CTRC right on time for her 3:15 p.m. appointment. I took my knitting to practice and pass time. Good thing considering we saw the Dr. Kalter at 5:45 p.m. Thankfully his was good news. She doesn't have to go back for six months. If she passes then, she won't have to return for a year! We go to mom's house, grab the relatives and go to my house. I change and close the shades so folks can't see in when it gets dark. Then we meet my Godparents for Mexican food. South Beach? Huh? What? Not tonight. Beef fajitas with fabulous handmade tortillas, guacamole, beans. Yum, Yum. Yum. Plus I shared two Tecates with my Godmother. Eventually she told me she was drunk and shouldn't have any more. But I think she had a good time. Went back to mom's (They are not staying with me after all. Oh well, at least the house looks good.). Watched the Spurs and some team from Michigan play for a while and now I'm home and getting ready for bed. And how was your day?

 Lordy. Tonight on the way to my first knitting class, mom called to say my Aunt and Uncle from Michigan are coming for a visit ~ tomorrow . They were in Kansas visiting their grand-daughter and great grand-daughter and figured since they were "in the neighborhood" they'd stop by. Which means they are staying at my house. So I've been running around like a mad woman for just over an hour tidying, doing laundry so they'll have clean sheets, dusting, scrubbing the toilet ~ you know, the general things you do when company comes. I suck at knitting so far. Truly, I was the worst in our class of seven. I really struggled to get it. Maybe I lack hand-eye coordination or something. The girl next to me was second worst, so when class was over I whispered to her, I'll come back next week if you will . She laughed and agreed that she would. So, with that, I am off to practice my knitting before I pass out.

 Mmm. Someone found my site tonight searching by my full name. Scary.

 So guess who else is going to be in Las Vegas on urlLink May 29 ? I know a lot of people don't like her, but when I was in college, urlLink she and urlLink Prince were *it* . And now they're both in Las Vegas the same night. *sigh*

 I'm still at home this morning ~ having a tree cut down. This morning I heard him working across the street and walked over to see how much he might charge me. &#36;185. A steal compared to the &#36;300 and &#36;500 I was quoted! He's almost done ~ I had no idea it would take several hours. I was just going to pay him and go to work when my mom said, "You cannot give a total stranger &#36;185 and walk away." Well, yeah. That makes sense.

 Tonight I have been to: ...the library ( urlLink The Stranger Beside Me , urlLink Under the Duvet : Shoes, Reviews, Having the Blues, Builders, Babies, Families and Other Calamities , urlLink Name & Address Withheld , urlLink Middlesex , urlLink Atonement and urlLink Bookends ). ...my neighborhood association monthly meeting. There I signed a petition for urlLink Becky Whetstone . I probably won't vote for her, but everyone has the right to urlLink run for office if they so choose. ...and to urlLink Wal-Mart to pick up the supplies for my knitting class on Wednesday. And now, it's time for the urlLink Sopranos !

 Man, I would really hate it if this is true: "At the time of his death, [Robert] Pastorelli was reportedly being investigated by the FBI for the death of his girlfriend, which took place in the same home almost five years ago to the day. TV Guide reporter Mary Murphy, who is investigating Pastorelli's death, says, 'He had not been called yet for the interviews but he was definitely, according to authorities, the prime suspect in the investigation.' " urlLink The full story . Terrible. I loved Eldin.

 I'm so excited for my friend Jeff. He was hired as a P.A. for urlLink Drop Dead Sexy . He's even going to have his name in the credits! Wheee! urlLink Austin chosen for new film . And yes, he says urlLink Crispin is as quirky in person as he is on screen.

 Great. urlLink FDA issues suicide caution for antidepressants . "The drugs of concern are all newer-generation antidepressants: Prozac, Paxil, Zoloft, Effexor, Celexa, Remeron, Lexapro , Luvox, Serzone and Wellbutrin . Most are known to affect the brain chemical serotonin." Gee, and I take two of them!

 I'm going to start a urlLink knitting class this week. I've tried signing up for either knitting or crocheting through a local school district's continuing ed classes for what seems like forever. They always fill up almost immediately. From what I've read, I need to get the urlLink Stitch 'n Bitch: the Knitter's Handbook and find a local Stitch 'n Bitch group to join, which I did via Yahoo. I missed the last meeting, but hopefully I'll have learned enough to catch the next one and not look like a total fool ...

 Today at the shelter I fed a little boy who hasn't learned to use his tongue properly yet. He's eight months old, yet every time you give him a spoonful of food he pushes 90% of it back out with his tongue. It was a slow process. I felt bad for him, cause he was hungry . Then he drank about half his bottle before getting cranky. For whatever reason, I put him up on my shoulder and he konked right out. My sweet girl was there today. I could tell right away that she didn't feel good. Seems they're all having some breathing issue. It seems that way every time I go. Sick kids everywhere. I have to admit it. I hate it when other volunteers show up. It's not that there aren't enough babies and toddlers for everyone. It just feels like they are infringing on my time. A first timer came while I was feeding Mr. J. As she signed in, Miss D toddled over to her. The volunteer looked at me, not knowing what to do. I called out that she could pick her up and she never put her back down. Walked her to lunch. Walked her back from lunch. Walked her straight to her crib. I was folding laundry at the time, so I went into dorm B to see if I could help. Usually the kids lay right down and fall asleep, but I really think for the most part they weren't feeling very good. But today the room was full of crying kids. Including Miss D in her crib. I marched right over and pulled her out. She laid her head on my shoulder and fell right to sleep. I stayed holding her longer than I needed, just so I could feel her in my arms.

 When I was growing up, there was an elderly gentleman who would walk the neighborhood with his lawn mower. We used to call him the "Kentucky Fried Chicken guy" because he looked just like urlLink The Colonel . Only shorter and more hunched over. He would wear all white, the trademark red tie and beard. You knew when he was coming by the whistle. He'd always wave. He seemed to be a happy guy. He was just a fixture in the neighborhood. I hadn't seen him in years. Quite frankly, I'd forgotten about him. I'd certainly thought he had died by now. Until about a month ago. I saw him. Just walking down the street. I couldn't believe my eyes. I called my mom right away, You're never going to believe who I just saw -- the Kentucky Fried Chicken guy! (I don't know why we just didn't call him The Colonel, but anyway). She couldn't believe it either. I saw him again this morning. Pushing a grocery cart. I heard him whistling when I drove by. Now, if I'd only had my camera . . .

 Whew. Whatta day! We (Linda, mom and I) started out with a hearty breakfast from urlLink IHOP . Then drove to Austin (about an hour ~ I talked to Kristy long distance the entire way) to visit the urlLink Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center for their urlLink Wildflower Days 2004 . It's a lovely center. I recommend it if you're in the neighborhood. Mom Then we drove into downtown Austin and had lunch at urlLink Iron Works Barbecue . Yum. We drove around town and were amazed at the number of people walking the streets. Both spring breakers and urlLink SXSW attendees. The city was hoppin'. Next we stopped at the original urlLink Amy's Ice Cream . I had chocolate orange crunch. We decided to stop on our way home at the urlLink outlet malls in San Marcos. We hit a few stores (it was crowded too) and I came home with some urlLink Stila products. Our last stop was urlLink Rolling Oaks Mall to pick up Kristy's t-shirt and walking number for the urlLink Race for the Cure . Then mom and I came home and spent about an hour talking with Dayne and Dwayne. I started to write this and realized I stunk, so I took a shower and here I am!

 urlLink This is where I am going tomorrow. I'm hoping for inspiration for my yard. I have finished with my pots, now I need to do something with the sidewalk beds.

 Looking for something to read? Here's the American Booksellers Association urlLink 2004 - 2005 Reading Group Suggestions . I'm going to bookmark it for ideas.

 The urlLink Friday Five on an actual Friday! If you... 1. ...owned a restaurant, what kind of food would you serve? I think I'll hang my star on the latest craze and make it a Good Carb restaurant (not low-carb ala Atkins). 2. ...owned a small store, what kind of merchandise would you sell? Books. 3. ...wrote a book, what genre would it be? ChickLit 4. ...ran a school, what would you teach? If I ran a school, I'd like something urlLink Montessori style. If I was a teacher, I'd teach reading and writing. 5. ...recorded an album, what kind of music would be on it? Mmm, that's a hard one. I'll have to think on it.

 The urlLink Bloggie winners are up!

 Sad. One of the orginal MTV VJs, urlLink JJ Jackson , died of an apparent heart attack.

 urlLink Jennifer Garner single again . What? But that Vaughn Michael guy is so cute! But then again, so was first hubby urlLink Scott Foley .

 Came home tonight and finished up my potting. It's nice to have some bright colors on my porch. Kind of brightens the day! Since then I've been doing some cooking ~ trying to come up with something different for lunch. I made some urlLink Taboule , to have with some hummus and whole wheat pita bread. This "good carb" way of eating can be a hassle! Oh, and a Happy St. Patrick's Day to ya! May the road rise to meet you, May the wind be always at your back, May the sun shine warm upon your face, The rains fall soft upon your fields Until we meet again An Irish Blessing I'm off to play a little urlLink WEBoggle , shower, read and sleep!

 I spent the first few house of the evening potting new plants. My porch looks like spring has arrived. I'll have to take pictures in the daylight. Now I'm hot and sticky and ready for a shower! Yeesh! My nails!

 I cannot believe urlLink Adriana ratted out on her best friend/maid of honor like that!

 Seems all the cool kids are urlLink playing it .

 Random: I must've sat on the floor too much at the shelter today. My tailbone hurts . I loved urlLink Michael Vaughn in the black turtleneck and spiky hair. urlLink Prince is on an urlLink Ellen rerun right now.

 I've been thinking about this situation with the high school guy all day. It really troubles me. I've been praying that he just won't come back. But, I'm guessing he will. This morning it made me really mad. Talk about disrespect. Not only to his wife, but to me . He must not think much of my moral character to think being kissed by a married man is on my list of things to do. God, men are stupid. And people wonder why I'm single. Cause this is the kind of guy I attract!

 Visiting the shelter each Sunday morning is something that gives me such a sense of peace ~ like nothing else in my life does right now. There was a really small crew of walkers today. Only five were big enough to eat in the high chairs. Even though some of them were crabby today, they are still so sweet and just in need of some extra attention. Sometimes a little lap time is all it takes. G was crying for no reason, so I picked her up and carried her around for a while. After she quieted down, I asked her are you alright now? And she shook her head no. So I held her for as long as she needed and eventually she left me to go play. A lap is never an empty one for very long. Someone is always clambering up for a hug or a kiss. For a quiet moment. And there always seems to be a line. Sometimes patient. Sometimes urgent. Sometimes you have to put down the child you adore and pick up one who needs you. Tiny Miss D was there today. They held her up to an eight month old and they were the same size. She's just so small and delicate. I can toss her up in the air and catch her. She loves it. Giggles with joy. She wanted me to rock her to sleep, so I did. Stroking her head with my hand. She was asleep in about a minute. These are the days I wish I were certified, cause I'd bring her home with me in a heartbeat.

 I was going to add a star rating to the books I've read in a hover format so folks can tell whether or not I've liked a book. But I don't know the html for a star. I tried &hearts; but they came out looking like &#124;&#124;&#124;&#124; instead of &hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;. I am using this format: title="* * * *" Any suggestions?

 I was having some issues with the birthday pictures, so I took off all but the most important one! I am not a true photographer at heart. I say this because I never remember to carry my camera around with me. I meant to take it today to the birthday party, but alas no.

 Holy crap. I have a problem. Last night about 9:10 p.m. there was a knock on my door. It was a police officer I went to high school with. He'd tracked me down to give me a picture of us from our reunion last summer. He came in and we chatted about 15 minutes before he had to go back to work. As he left, I told him to stop by anytime he was in the neighborhood (I am not in his patrol area). Well, guess who stopped by tonight? My first thought is, Oh shit. What's he doing here again? He comes in, chats for a while and readies to leave. As he does, he says "I've always wanted to do this," take my face in his hands and kisses me on the lips. Oh crap. Mind you, he is married. *sigh* I adored this guy in high school. Back then he was the ultimate "bad guy" and I was the ultimate "straight-laced" girl. But we were great friends. Sandy commented to me after the reunion that he'd been awfully friendly, but we'd always been that way so I never thought much of it. Oy. Now my house smells of his cologne.

 I came home early today, took some Tylenol Sinus and passed out on the couch. It's been a long time since I've had spring allergies. I usually only suffer from Thanksgiving to mid-January with the Cedar / Juniper. If yesterday and today are any indication, things are not looking so good for me. Haaaa-Cho!

 Yeee.... urlLink Prince giving CDs away to concert goers

 Wow. urlLink The Mighty Jimbo is in San Antonio. Right now. Gotta minute? Go give urlLink Kate a hug and some kind words. She could use it about now ...

 One of these bright, sunny, warm days I need to get out with my camera and take pictures of my mountain laurel. Yesterday when I came home from lunch, I got a whiff of those yummy smelling flowers and was just shocked when I looked at my little tree. I am so excited it's blooming this year. Last year I think I got maybe a handful of buds. Today it is just loaded with blooms. I'm off soon for Chinese birthday dinner with my Godson. This is my first "family dinner" on the actual birthday. Usually I just do the birthday party. I was pretty excited when my presence was requested by the little guy (there aren't too many more years can I get away with that one!). I'm charging my batteries, so hopefully I'll remember to take some pictures!

 Got this in an e-mail today: AMERICA TODAY "Joe Smith" started the day early having set his alarm clock (MADE IN JAPAN) for 6 a.m. While his coffeepot (MADE IN CHINA) was perking, he shaved with his electric razor (MADE IN HONG KONG). He put on a dress shirt (MADE IN SRI LANKA), designer jeans (MADE IN SINGAPORE) and tennis shoes (MADE IN KOREA). After cooking his breakfast in his new electric skillet (MADE IN INDIA) he sat down with his calculator (MADE IN MEXICO) to see how much he could spend today. After setting his watch (MADE IN TAIWAN) to the radio (MADE IN INDIA) he got in his car (MADE IN GERMANY) and continued his search for a good paying AMERICAN JOB. At the end of yet another discouraging and fruitless day, Joe decided to relax for a while. He put on his sandals (MADE IN BRAZIL) poured himself a glass of wine (MADE IN FRANCE) and turned on his TV ! (MADE IN INDONESIA), and then wondered why he can't find a good paying job in.....AMERICA.....

 Happy 9th Birthday Antonio!

 I watched urlLink Days of our Lives from age 12 till about, I dunno ... sometime in my late 20s maybe? I usually read the weekly recap in the Saturday paper so I generally know what's going on. I know urlLink Marlena is the serial killer. Today I just happened to come home for lunch (which I never do) and I got to see Marlena confess to urlLink John that she is the serial killer. And then I watched her stab him to death. I just may have to start watching (taping) again! [oh, I just read a urlLink recap of today . I left before the end of the show. She didn't really kill him. It was just a dream. Dammit. I mean, not that I want her to kill John. It was pretty cool though.]

 I need to figure out a way to rate the books I read. Just because it's over there as something I read doesn't mean I liked it. One I've really enjoyed this week is urlLink Watermelon Days and Firefly Nights . It's just a sweet compilation of feel good stories from a fictional small Texas town. I thoroughly enjoyed it.

 So I learned tonight that I am screwed if urlLink Blogrolling ever dies and takes my blogroll with it. It was off for a while tonight and I could only think fo the urls for two of my favorites. Scary. And it's interesting to see what people google to get here. Today there was a search for mycosis fungoides. And I thought What they hell? When the hell did I ever talk about mycosis fungoides on here? So I followed through. Oh, yeah. Mom's cancer.

 A group of us went to Dine for the Cure ~ a fundraiser for the local affiliate of the urlLink Susan G. Komen Foundation . A core group of us have participated every year since the race started in San Antonio ( What? Go somewhere and eat for a good cause? OK ). urlLink EZ's donates 10% of the evenings receipts to Komen. Now, I'm off to watch urlLink The Sopranos . And then to bed. I'm pooped.

 urlLink Lisa's friend is working on her psych dissertation and needs some folks to take a survey. I thought, hey, pysch stuff, that's me! and went to take urlLink Personal Projects . But, it "requires that you are in a dating, marital, or committed relationship." Um, yeah. So not me. So, why don't YOU be a sport and urlLink help her out ...

 I am in an interesting position at work. My boss doesn't like me. And I mean obviously so. Even in front of other people. I have never been in this position before and I really hate it. I try so hard not to get defensive when she talks to me or about a project I am working on. This morning during staff meeting, she mentioned two of my projects, not in a "they suck" kind of way, but in a "how can we help her make it better (cause she can't do it herself)" kind of way. Afterwards, I mentioned my being overly sensitive when it comes to the boss to a co-worker, but she said, "Oh, I understand what you mean. There was definitely tone." It felt like she was scolding me in front of everyone, instead of genuinely trying to get folks to filter down information to help me do my job better. I keep thinking that I really need to leave here because of it. Even if I don't want to.

 urlLink Alias is on tonight at 8 p.m. So are the urlLink Sopranos . Hate that. I'll be watching Alias tonight and catch up with the Sopranos tomorrow. Which means I can't go visit urlLink Kate until late tomorrow cause she might have spoilers!

 I went to the shelter today ~ first time since I fell. I decided my back was up to it, even if my bruised behind wasn't. There were no toddlers today. Every child was under a year old. The youngest was born Feb. 16. There was the cutest little girl. I'd have brought her home with me in an instant. She was just learning to walk. She was so tiny. Delicate. Really sweet and full of laughter. I fed another baby who shook. Drug baby? "We think so."

 Today I learned something new about myself. I learned that I should not be left alone to paint. I learned I should definitely not be the trim girl. Wide, open spaces with the roller brush, I'm ok. I painted my hallway. Same color as my living room. It makes a dramatic difference to me. It also makes the trim look not-so-white. I must admit I found cleaning the roller brushes a little erotic. Yep. It's official. I've been without for too long now.

 What defines racism? I stopped at the store on the way home from the Children's Shelter to do the week's shopping. There was a guy in the frozen foods who seemed to be attempting to get my attention. He was about my age ~ I know this because he was singing the words to a urlLink song only someone my age would know. He was handsome and hunky in his shorts. But I just smiled politely and kept going. Then he came up behind me at the register. I didn't look at him, but watched the items he unloaded from his cart. The only odd items were four Catholic Saints candle. I did watch where he parked and drove past as I left the parking lot. He stopped his unloading and fully watched me go by. I smiled. The point of my story? He was black. And that's the reason I didn't flirt back. White guy? Sure. Hispanic? Absolutely. Black, no. So again, I was thinking in the car about what defines a racist. Sure, the guys with the burning crosses and white hooded outfits are easy to pick out. But what about someone like me? I've had black friends that I adored. Even had a big time crush on one. The little girl I wanted to foster was black. What, I'll raise one but not date one? I just think it's interesting. It says something about me. Not necessarily something bad, but it is telling.

 Hi SUSAN, The ticket(s) you ordered on March 03, 2004 for PRINCE, have been printed! They will be shipped to you shortly via US Mail. Love, Ticketmaster

 They had the cutest black lab puppy up for auction tonight. He had the best temperament and just as sweet as could be. He came with all his shots for a year, crate, bed, toys, Eukanuba for a year and is already potty trained! Oh, I wanted him so bad. His name was even Corey! But he went for &#36;2,000. *sigh* In all, the live auction took in just over &#36;40,000. Once they add in the silent auction (over 500 items), it should come to a nice total to buy more things for the school. I bid on and won a basket of baby Johnson & Johnson goodies. Ya-Ya Stephanie is expecting a boy, so I wanted to get it for her. I was outbid on everything else. To rich for my blood.

 Earlier today, while running some errands with mom, I saw a bike at a yard sale. We stopped. I hopped on and went for a quick spin. Immediately I remembered that my tailbone still hurts, even if the rest of my back is doing much better. Then I found the bike to be too tall for me. I tried to stop by putting my feet on the ground, didn't reach, lost control and crashed. I jumped up really fast in one of those imalright moments. Right now I'm getting ready for a dinner/fundraiser for my old elementary school. It should be fun because the theme is "support your favorite sports team." Yes, my Spurs t-shirt, jeans and sneakers are gonna feel great tonight. There'll be Mexican food, a silent and live auction. It's usually pretty entertaining. Even if I don't win anything I bid on.

 urlLink fragments : a writing meme * wanted to open the * why should i give * he did that without ~ &hearts; ~ &hearts; ~ I have always wanted to open the perfect book store. I can see it clearly in my mind. The store would specialize in something. Only travel books. Or only the top 100 paperback books of the moment. It would be dark and comfortable. With cushy brown leather chairs. Reading lamps. Large area rugs. A coffee shop off to the side. With cookies and cakes. People would come to find just the right book to give as a gift. Or one that can't be found anywhere else. It would be in a neighborhood, folded in next to the specialty cheese store and the handmade jewelry store. There would be organized book groups, open mic nights and famous authors coming to read their works and answer questions. It would be a destination. ~ &hearts; ~ &hearts; ~ Peer pressure is a funny thing. Even at 38 I work to conform to the "norm." Whatever the hell that means. I'd rather be quirky and eclectic in my look, but I buy my suits and high heeled shoes to look like everyone else. I mean, really, why should I give a rats ass what anyone thinks of me? But it matters. ~ &hearts; ~ &hearts; ~ They talk about how the father impacts his daughter all of her life. A father can make a daughter feel loved and cherished. He can empower her to believe she can do anything. He can set the example of right and wrong. She can watch how he treats her mother. With respect and love? Or yelling and hitting? Or is there painful infidelity? He will teach her how she deserves to be treated in life. He will set the model of what she looks for in a man. She will look for him in every man she meets. When my father left, he did that without a moments thought of what that would do to me. Of the example he would set for me. In that he taught me to be fearful of men, wary to trust ... and giving someone my heart? Ha. So I look for him in every man I meet. Is he distant? Emotionally unavailable? Might he leave in a moments notice? Then he must be the man for me. ~ &hearts; ~ &hearts; ~ fragments is designed to be bit of fiction/stream of consciousness/what-have-you style of writing. I haven't written like that in forever. It's surprising what comes when you don't really think about it.

 Bad Girl Party Pointer Pack a Bad Girl's Party First Aid Kit in your purse before you go out tonight * 2 tins of breath mints (use as mini-maracas in a pinch) * pantyliners * travel toothbrush with paste pre-applied (luck is when preparation meets opportunity) * condom (if you pack it, he will come) * CDs with a great Girl Power mix * ibuprofen and/or Alka Seltzer * mini-Bible to carry on Sunday morning strut-of-pride So now I know what I am doing wrong! Note to self : buy condoms, carry with you everywhere.

 Happy 25th Birthday Kristy! You old goat! Sorry, but that's a private joke. Even if I explained it, it would mean nothing to you.

 The urlLink Friday Five : What was... 1. ...your first grade teacher's name? Mrs. Bierbaum (sp?). Wouldn't it be weird if from the hundred who participate someone else had her too? 2. ...your favorite Saturday morning cartoon? Mmmm. Not one single one comes to mind. I do remember loving urlLink Schoolhouse Rock . . . Conjunction Junction, what's your function? Hooking up words and phrases and clauses. Figure eight as double four, Figure four as half of eight. If you skate, you would be great If you could make a figure eight. That's a circle that turns 'round upon itself. I'm just a bill. Yes, I'm only a bill. And I'm sitting here on Capitol Hill. Well, it's a long, long journey To the capital city. 3. ...the name of your very first best friend? Irene 4. ...your favorite breakfast cereal? I always had urlLink Instant Breakfast in the car on the way to school. Even then I would eke out every last minute of sleep I could. 5. ...your favorite thing to do after school? In elementary I would say run and yell like a banshee, but as I got older it became watching television.

 I love this: urlLink I am more than what I choose to show you. I am more than your interpretations and judgments. For this site is only a piece of me. It sounds obvious, I know. But sometimes I don't think it is.

 I watched urlLink I Am Sam tonight. It made me bawl big time. Something about dads and daughters always does it to me.

 Went to the urlLink Spurs game tonight. We won, but it was a sloppy game. It made me think we won't be in the finals this year (and you know how I am about my Spurs!). I chose this game from the work tickets because I wanted to see urlLink Antonio Daniels , a former Spur but he was on the injured list (as was urlLink Tim Duncan ). urlLink Priest Holmes and a whole posse of good looking men sat three rows from us. Let me tell you, after seeing those bodies in person, I can see why the chicks throw themselves at professional athletes. Yum

 I mentioned earlier that urlLink Prince is going urlLink on tour . I have since learned that he's going to be in Las Vegas on May 29 for Tiger Jam. Guess what? I already planned a trip to Vegas for May 25-29. I pondered changing my return flight to May 30 for about a minute before snatching up a Prince ticket and rebooking!! Whee! I'm going to see Prince!!!!!!

 I stopped on my way home tonight to buy Quicken. I really need to get my budget under control, so I've spent the evening downloading all my accounts. *sigh*

 I went to the library tonight and came home with too many books. Oh, that's not true. You can never have too many books. Anyhoo. I checked out: urlLink Daisy's Back in Town , urlLink Watermelon Days and Firefly Nights , urlLink A Promising Man , urlLink Bel Canto , urlLink The Kalahari Typing School for Men , urlLink Lucky Stars and urlLink Eat, Drink, and Be Healthy . As I was checking out the librarian told me that she liked my taste in books. She recommended I try urlLink The Beekeeper's Apprentice by Laurie R. King, so I've added it to my reminder list.

 Shit. Shit. Shit. I just spilled a whole box of Near East Couscous on my drainboard and floor. Do you know how small couscouse are? And how many are in a box? Sheesh. I was distracted because I got my escrow today which went up loads. If I don't pay it, my mortgage payment will go up &#36;125 a month. Sheesh.

 This morning my Ya-Ya Jill and I were talking about my Vern adventure. I told her the story and she oh'd, ah'd and squealed in the right places. We talked about how thin he was and tall he wasnt. How sweet he seemed. Whether or not he is gay. And did I really call him "a doll"? Then I ask about a conference she attended in San Diego last week. "Oh, guess who I met," she asked. Who? "Tiger Woods." Shut up! She told me about their encounter on a golf course pathway. Well, you totally beat my Vern story. "Yeah, but you got Vern's autograph and I didn't get squat." Whatever. You met Tiger Woods !

 This is an interesting article on blogging: urlLink Blogging still infrequent, study finds "The impression out there is that a lot of the blog activity is very feverish," said Lee Rainie, the Pew project's director. "That's not the case. For most bloggers, it's not an all-consuming, all-the-time kind of experience." That survey found only 2 percent of users keeping blogs, although a preliminary analysis of follow-up surveys from early 2004 showed the figure increasing to about 7 percent. About 11 percent of Internet users report visiting blogs written by others. Most often, they were for blogs written by friends. But blog readers are more likely to go to journals kept by strangers rather than by family members. That's me. A blog reader. I visit strangers all the time. That's part of the fun of blogging. You visit a site you know and click on a site you haven't visited before and go from there!

 Subject: Hellmann's Mayonnaise For those who think they know everything Most people don't know that back in 1912, Hellmann's mayonnaise was manufactured in England. In fact, the Titanic was carrying 12,000 jars of the condiment scheduled for delivery in Vera Cruz, Mexico, which was to be the next port of call for the great ship after its stop in New York. This would have been the largest single shipment of mayonnaise ever delivered to Mexico.... But as we know....the great ship did not make it to New York....The ship hit an iceberg and sank....and the cargo was forever lost.... The people of Mexico, who were crazy about mayonnaise, and were eagerly awaiting its delivery....were disconsolate at the loss.... Their anguish was so great, that they declared a National Day of Mourning, which they still observe to this day.... The National Day of Mourning occurs each year on May 5th....and is known....of course....as Sinko de Mayo....

 The Sports Center: urlLink Los Angeles Lakers vs. San Antonio Predicition: Spurs in Seven

 Did anyone see urlLink this bit on urlLink 60 Minutes II last night? They had pictures of American soldiers that were shocking and appalling. I could not believe my eyes. "It was American soldiers serving as military police at Abu Ghraib who took these pictures. The investigation started when one soldier got them from a friend, and gave them to his commanders. 60 Minutes II has a dozen of these pictures, and there are many more pictures that show Americans, men and women in military uniforms, posing with naked Iraqi prisoners. There are shots of the prisoners stacked in a pyramid, one with a slur written on his skin in English. In some, the male prisoners are positioned to simulate sex with each other. And in most of the pictures, the Americans are laughing, posing, pointing, or giving the camera a thumbs-up. 60 Minutes II was only able to contact one of the soldiers facing charges. But the Army says they are all in Iraq, awaiting court martial." What the hell were those soldiers thinking?

 Am I the only person tired of the Friends hoopla? Ya. Go already.

 Happy Birthday Lee.

 Everyone at work was very complimentary about my hair. I just kept saying, Yes. I like the cut. They'd just laugh and reassure me that it looks really good.

 I fought the Red but the Red won! Yes, I have short strawberry blonde-ish short hair. Treatment after treatment and the red would just not go away. It faded, but it's still Red . She started a fourth attempt when I told her to stop. I don't hate this color and can live with it for a while. I figured my hair was about to start falling out. I could feel how coarse my hair felt, so I told her to do whatever she wanted with it. Oh well, it'll grow back. Lesson learned. Again.

 My mom sent me this e-mail to prove she was right during a recent "conversation". I've bolded the line in question. You know when you're from San Antonio if.......

 I really do think urlLink Alias is one of the top shows on television right now. I'm just mesmerized by it. I used to encourage everyone I know to watch it, but now I tell people not to bother cause they'd never figure it out. Although, tonight I was a tad bit disappointed in the initial Vaughn/Lauren reunion. I hope there's a good showdown between the two of them before the end of the season ( May 23 ). He deserves to let her have it. Here's an interesting Alias site: urlLink Two Evil Monks . Check out the "unanswered questions" section. Later : [Link has spoilers, so don't click if you don't want to know.] " urlLink TV Gal reader Kate was one of several "Alias" fans to tell me that Sydney's half-sister's name is Nadia Santos. Nadia is Aidan spelled backwards and Santos is, of course, Saint. And we all remember that Sydney dreamed about St. Aidan early this season."

 from my front porch

 The kids at the shelter were so cranky today. Every last one of them (ok, there were only 6-8 toddlers) was crying and whiney and tired. Seems they've been jacking around with their schedule (again!) this week so the kids' clocks are all messed up. Nemo (again, not his real name) was out on another house visit today. He's been at the shelter five months. Almost as long as me! He wasn't even crawling the first time we met. He's grown and relaxed so much. He's turning into such a happy kid, I sure hope someone takes him home soon.

 I know I'm behind on the trend, but I finally broke down and bought myself some flipflops today. Since they're on sale at Target for &#36;2.50, I figured I could afford to find out what all the hullabaloo is about!

 I have added some commentary on the books I've read this year. If you hover over the title, a pop-up box will appear.

 I have been feeling puny all day. While at the store I broke into a bottle of Gatorade and drank the whole thing (yes I paid for it on my way out). I feel loads better. Guess I needed some electrolytes or something.

 I went to the mall a while ago to exchange a urlLink James Avery ring I bought yesterday with a gift certificate. It was a half-size too large. I collect hearts. I also own the urlLink Tiny Hearts Band and urlLink Mother's Love (although I didn't know that was the name of it when I bought it). I love urlLink James Avery jewelry. While I was at the mall I looked in every mirror trying to determine if the hair is too terrible to wear to work on Monday and Tuesday (pulled back in a ponytail). I think it will be ok. Although, people will definitely notice (I felt like everyone was staring at me at the mall ~ even though they weren't).

 This morning we went to the urlLink King William Fair in time for the annual parade. It kind of sucked being there with all that great food and not being able to eat any (just the smell of it made me nauseous). So I came home and had some crackers and peanut butter. Whoo-hoo. Mom and I were trying to figure out what this is that I have (since Tuesday). It dawned on me that the kids at the shelter were having a problem with this same issue last week. Or maybe not. I'll ask when I go tomorrow.

 MmmmYeah. I have definitely lost my sense of humor over this today. I have an appointment with a colorist (rather than doing it myself) on Tuesday. That means I have to go to work two days with hair this color. *sigh* Even in a ponytail is still looks . . . well, not good.

 Now I remember why I haven't home colored in eight years . . . I don't think this picture truly reflects how orange the former blonde streaks are. Luckily (?) it's one of those that washes out in 28 washes. Two washes down, 26 to go before Monday . . . My roots are terribly long and my stylist is on maternity leave. I thought I would use some "auburn" to perk things up until she comes back. Good thing I have a good sense of humor.

 urlLink Sweet . I always love reading wedding blogs. Especially when the plans are true to who the couple is and not so traditional.

 Today is a holiday of sorts for us. Everything downtown pretty much shutters up about 11 a.m. for the urlLink Battle of Flowers Parade . Now, if only I felt better.

 Have you every tried urlLink Start Sampling ? I've received some good things (note: they are sample size). If for no other reason, I enjoy getting stuff in the mail.

 I've been watching urlLink 100 Greatest Stand-Ups of All Time on Comedy Central this week. I pretty much agree, except for maybe on Woody Allen.

 urlLink Bravo is letting us vote on urlLink The 100 Greatest TV Characters of All Time ! And yes, I'll bet you can guess who "My favorite character in a currently running show" is. But hurry, voting closes tomorrow!

 Yea!! It's the urlLink season finale schedule!

 Here's an example of why I shouldn't be left at home with long periods of time with nothing to do. A little while ago a white car pulled up in front of my house. Of course I notice it, it's in front of my house. I watch as the driver flicks his cigarette ashes out the passenger window. Mmmm. This strikes me as odd. He pulls away. I hear the squeaky brakes stop not far away so I get up to look. Sure enough he's moved two houses down. Which again, strikes me as odd. I watch as he gets out and walks back to my neighbor's house. Which he could have parked in front of because there's no one else parked there. I go find my binoculars. Write down the make, model and license plate number. So if he harms my neighbor I can give that to the police. Yep. I think it's time to go back to work.

 I was just checking my stats and I got a hit from freepronsexpics (spelled incorrectly on purpose). Scary.

 I'm home again today. It feels like it could go either way. I could truly be fine or not. About 45 minutes ago I thought about getting dressed and going into work. But once I was up and moving around my stomach started gurgling, so I decided to stay put.

 I still have a crabby stomach. I came home early again and basically tried to lay still all afternoon. You know it's bad when you go to the store to buy soup and the pictures on the label make you feel like upchucking.

 Today is my Godmother's 75th birthday. We went to Joe's Crabshack for dinner. It was a lovely evening. So much so that near the end I almost started crying. Her brain was "on" tonight. She spoke almost complete sentences ~ enough so that I could figure out what she was trying to say and we had what could almost pass as real conversations. I heard her call my mother by name. They had a menu with pictures, so she could pick out what she really wanted. She was in a giddy, joyous mood. I am so grateful for this night.

 I finished urlLink The Secret Life of Bees several nights ago. I really enjoyed it. I'd say it ranks among my top five for the year.

 As for yesterday . . . let's just say I had some gastrointestinal distress that required I leave work early and spend the evening laying very still on my couch and leave it at that. An update on my friend's daughter (they may read funny because I cut-n-paste it from an update e-mail I've been sending): her daughter is at home she has no memory of the incident she is very solemn and sad wishes she could go back in time and not do it she is off all meds they tube aspirated the thing in her abdomen it was all liquid there were no immediate reasons for the spot/whatever it is there were no visible bad "organisms" in the liquid results will be available in two weeks she has an appointment with her primary care and oncologist then the oncologist can also help with the hepatitis she called the the psychiatric hospital yesterday she enrolled herself in a six-week outpatient program orientation is today

 Mom is on a roll today: A young brunette goes into the doctor's office and says that her body hurts wherever she touches it. "Impossible," says the doctor. "Show me." She takes her finger and pushes her elbow and screams in agony. She pushes her knee and screams, pushes her ankle and screams. Everywhere she touches makes her scream. The doctor says, "You're not really a brunette, are you?" She says, "No, I'm really a blonde." I thought so," he says. "You have a broken finger." Alice was to bake a cake for the church ladies' group bake sale, but, she forgot to do it until the last minute. She baked an angel food cake, and when she took it out of the oven, the center had dropped flat. She said, "Oh dear, there is no time to bake another cake." So, she looked around the house for something to build up the center of the cake. Alice found it in the bathroom, a roll of toilet paper. She plunked it in and covered it with icing. The finished product looked beautiful, so she rushed it to the church. Alice then gave her daughter some money and instructions to be at the sale the minute it opened and to buy that cake and bring it home. When the daughter arrived at the sale, the attractive cake had already been sold. Alice was beside herself. A couple of days later Alice was invited to a friend's home were two tables of bridge were to be played that afternoon. After the game a fancy lunch was served, and to top it off, the cake in question was presented for dessert. When Alice saw the cake, she started to get up to rush into the kitchen to tell her hostess all about it, but before she could get to her feet, one of the other ladies said, "What a beautiful cake!" Alice sat back in her chair when she heard the hostess say, "Thank you, I baked it myself."

 These episodes of urlLink Alias just get better and better. This week kept me guessing and screeching and oohing and aahing and clapping and gasping. urlLink JJ Abrams is my hero. The Package Yep. They could be sisters. And only three episodes left?? Waahhh!

 Here's what I did today: before . . . Linda preparing to finish the hallway trim and after . . . my [Vern Yip] brown bedroom! don't know if you can tell by the pictures ... but it looks fabulous! And I did it all by myself. Sure, it took all day ~ minus breaks for lunch, dessert and to wash the cat ~ but I did it all by myself and I am very pleased with how it turned out. Now to figure out the finishing touches ... curtains, new bedspread, lamp covers, etc...

 Last night was the second time ever that Cory has not been thrown out of my room. I was surprised when I woke up this morning and the door was still open. Either I'm just sleeping through her playing or she's figured out she can leave the room and play without waking me. Although I do remember her lunging and biting my boob, and me shoving her off the bed.

 So today ... I almost came home with a greyhound from the Humane Society dealie this morning. Well, not literally because she still needs to be spayed. She's a black and white "ticked" beauty: But I need to do a little more research first on greyhounds. We did a couple of Fiesta events today and had a grand time. One of the homes on tour is owned by someone we used to work with. Small world! This evening I watched the Spurs and did prep work in my room to paint tomorrow. We saw some lovely brown rooms on the tour day, so I'm excited. I spoke with my friend this morning. Her daughter has really perked up and was able to move from ICU to a private room. She is eating, talking, showering by herself, etc... Generally where they expected her to be two days ago. However. She still has her mystery fever. We were talking on mobile phones and part of the conversation went like: "something, something, oncologist, something, something." Oncologist, what?? Yes, now on top of everything else, the gastrointerologist found a mass on her abdomen that requires an oncologist. She had cancer as a child, so no telling what this is. Oy. An oncologist. And an exchange with my mother as we ate Whataburger: Mom: "I wish Whataburger would warm their buns like WhopperBurger does." Me: You mean Burger King. Mom: "No. WhopperBurger." Me: Burger King. Mom (with great disgust): "There is a Whataburger and there is a WhopperBurger." Me: Then I would like you to show me a WhopperBurger. Mom: (thinking) Me: Burger King makes the Whopper Burger. Mom: "Oh. Maybe it was somewhere else." Gotta love her.

 It's an interesting thing reading about urlLink how much the presidential candidates are spending on advertising . When was the last time I saw a presidential ad on TV? I think it was four years ago while on vacation on California. No, really. I guess the democrats figure it's not worth spending the money in Texas, so the republicans don't bother either.

 urlLink The first three words are the adjectives they chose for themselves, the last three are the ones I have chosen for them. I think this is an interesting exercise by urlLink Em .

 So, someone asked for the male version of the Permission game. Here goes: Question for Women: True or False In order to ejaculate the penis has to be hard and erect. Answer: False The penis can ejaculate without being hard or erect. 4-play: Fondle your own genitals through your clothing. Permission for His Eyes Only: The 3-Eyed Turtle Right before you're about to make love, instead of manual stimulation for foreplay, use the head of your penis and rub it gently against her clitoris, first up and down, then side to side, then in little circles, make sure to use plenty of lubricant and hold back a bit (even if she begs), do not enter her until you can't take it anymore and she desires you bad!! Oh, I almost forgot, don't take your eyes off her. This exercise is call the 3-eyed turtle because all three of your eyes are on her. Get it? Yeah, I got it. Maybe I should give this game to someone I know who is actually having sex instead of torturing myself.

 ABC had previously scheduled "Alias'" third season finale for May 16 at 8 p.m. It's not clear if it will air at 9:00 p.m. that night, be bumped to May 23 or moved up to make a two-hour finale on May 2. (The network premiere of "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" will fill ABC's entire Sunday schedule on May 9). What?

 An update on my friend's daughter: My friend spent last night at hospital. Her daughter woke up and ate about 4 bites of oatmeal at 4 a.m. She's not been awake since (as of when we talked around noon). She can get up and go to the bathroom. Even in her sleep. She still has fever and elevated white cell count. The doctors cannot find source of her fever. She is in a lot of pain as the drugs begin to leave her body. They called in a gastro-doc to see what's going on with her belly. Her heart is much better. It is now responsive to her movements. This is her third day in intensive care. This time in ICU is considered not a normal reaction to an OD. She is now past the 48 hour period and is considered to be getting better. Lordy, I hope so.

 ok, so here's the truth. I am in a mood. I don't know if I'd call it a bad mood. And here's why (but don't tell anyone). I ran out of Lexapro. Yeah, I know. It's on order. I really thought it would be here by now. I started rationing the meds when I saw I'd failed to mail in the new prescription, thinking it would tide me over. Eventually I plain ran out. I haven't had any this week. Bad Susan.

 Apparently I am not in a very good mood today. It's been brought to my attention on several occassions. So I am having a rum & diet coke. Oh, and I lost my keys at work today. Don't ask.

 From my Ya-Ya Sister Ileana: 1. If you love something, set it free. If it comes back, it will always be yours. If it doesn't come back, it was never yours to begin with. But, if it just sits in your living room, messes up your stuff, eats your food, uses your telephone, takes your money, and doesn't appear to realize that you had set it free....... You either married it or gave birth to it. 2. Reason to smile: Every 7 minutes of every day, someone in an aerobics class pulls a hamstring. 3. They keep telling us to get in touch with our bodies.

 It's that time of the year. urlLink NBA Playoffs 2004 . And my urlLink Spurs are playing in round one against the Grizzlies. You'll notice I've set-up the schedule over there on the right. And this is the first of what I anticipate will be many more articles on urlLink my team as the playoffs continue until June. urlLink Defending champs flying under the radar It's very easy, indeed, to overlook the Spurs. But that would be a mistake. They're the defending champs, and -- get out your radar -- the prediction here is that when June comes, they'll be champs again.

 Joy! Joy! Great news! Karla did not have a hysterectomy after all. They were able to remove the grapefruit size fibroid, plus two others without having to take the uterus! On the other hand, I spoke with my friend about an hour ago and the first thing they told her this morning was that her daughter is not doing well. She's had an inexplicable fever for 24 hours now, so they are trying to figure out what's going on. Plus there are still problems with her heart. Oh, and did I mention she already has hepatitis C? She is not coherent. She's told her mom that she loves her and that she's sorry, but not much else. Mostly she's out of it. They told my friend that this is not a normal reaction to an overdose. The emergency room folks expected her to be "fine" by now, but she is in ICU. One of the fever possibilities is pneumonia, which would be really serious in this situation with the condition her heart is in. Did I mention that she's 18?

 I had a friend call last night to tell me her daughter attempted suicide on Tuesday. On top of everything else, the daughter had developed an eating disorder, so at 80 pounds she swallowed more than 130 anti-depressants. She's occasionally conscious, but not really coherent. Oh, and the overdose has caused problems with her heart. My other friend is having her surgery (possible hysterectomy) today. And how's your day going? I'm exhausted already.

 I receive a weekly newsletter from urlLink Cheryl Richardson . Recently, a topic focused on urlLink Cleaning Closets: The hidden meaning of old clothes . I let it sit with me a while and yesterday I did it. Everything that is too small, too old and simply past it's prime is gone. I think I cleared out half of my wardrobe. It included my college graduation dress (16 years ago), a few size 10s (? long ago), clothes from old boyfriends, shoes worn to the sole. I confess I kept a half dozen items I'm just not ready to part with. Two party dresses I've worn once and would love to wear again. A suit that might fit again someday (just one!). I also found an "adult" game I've never been able to play. The Permission Game . There are questions for men and women, 4-play cards and the ultimate "Permission" card. I just drew these three cards as things I would do if my guy and I were playing: Question for men: True or False There is a tribe in Africa where the women remove their front teeth so they can perform fellatio better. Answer: True Most men prefer fellatio without the teeth being involved. 4-Play : Kiss the back of you partner's neck. Permission for Her Eyes Only: Lusty Language Talking dirty to your partner can be huge turn on for him, so that's what you're going to do. Jump into bed and start making whoopee. Say stuff like: harder or faster, oh you feel so good, oh you feel so hard, I feel you so deep inside me, etc ... If you have your own material, by all means now is the time to use it. Beef it up baby! Now I just need a guy . . .

 Jimbo: urlLink I'm not going bald. Just getting more head. Gotta appreciate a guy with a sense of humor.

 Can someone explain this to me? urlLink William Hung set to crack Billboard's Top 30 . Shouldn't his 15 minutes be up by now?

 I finished urlLink The Five People You Meet in Heaven a few nights ago. It was OK. Last night I started urlLink The Secret Life of Bees and I finally had to force myself to stop reading at midnight ~ waayyy past my bedtime.

 Knit, purl, knit, purl (yes, that's how you can tell it's Wednesday). I've just finished washing the dishes in preparation for Elizabeth to visit this weekend ~ just in time for our annual city-wide party, urlLink Fiesta . She's coming in on Friday and we start that afternoon with our first event, urlLink Fiestas Fantasas , for lunch. She's talking about hitting urlLink Oyster Bake , but I'm going to pass on that one. On Saturday we are doing the urlLink Monticello Park Historic District Tour Of Homes and urlLink Fiesta Arts Fair at the urlLink Southwest School of Art and Craft . For Sunday I've encouraged her to get together with other friends she should see while she's here and I think I'm going to paint (since it's looking rain-less for a while).

 Wanna know one of the many things I hate about PMS? The weepies. You know, when something that would never bother you on an ordinary day can bring stoopid tears to your eyes? And you hate it because it happens and that makes them spill over your lashes and down your cheeks ~ yet there is nothing you can do to stop them? Maybe I should just go to bed and start again tomorrow.

 You know, I was sitting at work this afternoon being driven completely nuts by my supervisor. NUTS! We sit back to back in open cubicles and some days the talking out loud is incessant. Like today. How do I print this .pdf? I can't find the printer icon. How will it know I only want to print this page? It's not printing. No the other print option is grayed out. Oh, the printer icon is grayed out too. How do I save this picture (a jpeg opened into IE)? No, it won't let me save it here. Why do I have to go back to mail? But when I clicked open that's what it did. What "save" button? Oh. I go bang my head against Ericka's desk (who, luckily, gets to overhear all these exchanges because my supervisor talks loud) before coming back to my area and reading urlLink Family of slain soldier pleads for sisters : With three daughters serving in Iraq, John and Lori Witmer had a family Web site with photos from Baghdad, notes to home and messages of encouragement. "Keep praying! They're almost home!" a recent entry says. But the top notice, dated Sunday, carried grim news: "We regret to inform you that Michelle Witmer was killed in action April 9th. ..." Then I remember my life is not so bad. Actually, it's a pretty damn good one.

 Finally. urlLink He knows. Excellent episode!

 For Easter lunch I fixed crab cakes, scallops wrapped in bacon, asparagus and salad. For dessert it was banana pudding. With extra banana and 'nilla wafers. There was a lull in the rain post-lunch, so we drove to Devine to plant an Easter Lily at Phyllis' grave. She has a beautiful headstone now. As we left she said, "I sure miss her." Me too.

 I took Easter cookies to the care givers at the shelter this morning. My little Diamond was gone. I'm glad for her. Really I am. I know someone is going to fall madly, deeply in love with her. She deserves it. They all do.

 Earlier in the year I bought a card organizer from Hallmark so I could, you know, get organized. So guess where my Easter cards are. Yep. In the organizer!

 The Carpenter's Cloth Then Simon Peter, who was behind him, arrived and went into the tomb. He saw the strips of linen lying there, as well as the burial cloth that had been around Jesus' head. The cloth was folded up by itself, separate from the linen. John 20:6-7 During Jesus' time there was one way a carpenter let the contractor know a job was finished. A signature, so to speak. Imagine a hot afternoon in Galilee. Jesus has completed the final pieces of a job he has worked on for several days. The hair of his strong forearms is matted with sawdust and sweat. His face is shiny with heat. He takes a final and welcome drink of cool water from a leather bag. Then standing to the side of his work, he pours water over his face and chest, splashing it over his arms to clean himself before his journey home. With a nearby towel, he pats his face and arms dry. Finally, Jesus folds the towel neatly in half, and then folds it in half again. He sets it on the finished work and walks away. Later, whoever arrives to inspect the work will see the towel and understand its simple message. The work is finished. Christ's disciples, of course, knew this carpenter's tradition. On a Sunday of sorrow, three years after Jesus had set aside his carpenter tools, Peter will crouch to look into an empty tomb and see only the linens that the risen Lord has left behind. A smile will cross Peter's face as his sorrow is replaced by hope, for he will see the wrap that had covered Jesus' face. It has been folded in half, then folded in half again and left neatly on the floor of the tomb. Peter understands. The carpenter has left behind a simple message. It is finished.

 I've had another successful day today. Did some early morning shopping at Penney's. I am not short or average when it comes to slacks. Short is too short and average is too long (and forget tall!). I took some lower heeled shoes with me and found three pairs of pants that fit perfectly. That oughta round out my work attire for the rest of the year! Then we had lunch with the Godparents. Lemme tell you, it's a lot of work. Between trying to figure out what she's saying and listening to him talk ~ it's exhausting! We were on our way home when I said, Look, there's Darth Vader . The Jill I mentioned in the 23 questions the other day drives a black Lincoln Navigator that I nicknamed Darth Vader. Then as she passed I said, Wait! That really is Darth Vader . I did a quick u-turn as Mom asked, "Are you sure?" So I called her, Is that you? "At mom's house?" No, right in front of me on Loma Linda. She looked in her review mirror and waved. I went and watched her eat some Mexican food (a must when former San Antonians come to town) and caught up on life. And now she's headed back to Houston and it's cold here. We saw a 30&deg; drop today. It's in the 50s now. That's BRR for San Antonio in April!

 My friend Karla is having surgery on the 15th that may lead to a partial hysterectomy (they leave the ovaries). I feel for her. It's one thing to take some time in your life to decide if and when you want children. It's something totally different to have that decision taken away from you.

 I thought I would feel like I'd been beat up with a shovel this morning, but surprisingly I don't. My shoulders hurt some and the arches of my feet. I figure the sunburn that remains will be faded enough or will be easy enough to cover for work. Whew.

 Check out urlLink Q&A: the photographic interview . I think I may play.

 Did you know June 9 is urlLink International Webloggers' Day ? Yeah, me neither.

 I am someone I do not know. Gardening and being excited over the spring issue of urlLink knitty . In the same day.

 I have obviously been hitting the crack pipe again because I went to the Humane Society again. There was no one there that called to my heart. Although there was one really cute dachshund . . .

 I took a mental health day today. When I called this morning all bright and chipper, I told Maria that it was my official sick day call . "Oh, you don't feel good?" Laughter . "Well, I hope you feel better soon." Have a nice Easter. "You too." Then I called mom and we went to Lowe's. I finally bought the brown paint Vern picked for me. I'd hoped to paint this weekend, but we're expecting rain. Again. Every weekend it seems. Oh, and a cold front. Monday morning is supposed to be 38&deg;. While at Lowe's I also bought annuals. We came home and I started digging. And digging. I pulled up the cement trimmers around the flower beds (one on each side of side walk ~ about six feet long and now 18 inches wide). I turned over dirt. I picked out roots and pecans and rocks. I reset the cement trimmers (don't know what else to call them). I know it's 18 inches from inside the trim to the sidewalk because mom used a measuring tape. No, really. We planted impatients, marigolds, snapdragons, something else I don't remember the name of and verbena (closer to the house). It took almost four hours (hey, this is new stuff for me), including a lunch break and time spent talking to various neighbors. I also have my first manual labor blister. It's about the size of a nickel in the palm of my hand. I didn't notice it forming until it popped. Can you say Ouch ? Yeesh, I was so muddy . . . with a open wound and no band*aids. I finally rigged up some cotton with Neosporin and tape it all up ~ inside of a glove ~ so that I could finish. Mom keeps telling me how much better it looks and I keep saying you think so? She promises in a few weeks I will love it. Right now I'm trying to figure out how to explain my newfound tan since I'm sick and it's going to rain all weekend.

 It's another knitting night. Hopefully I will learn how to purl. I'll still be a class behind most others, but oh well. Then a quickie trip to the grocery store for cat food and other items to help me finish out the week. Cory's starting to get pissed. This is two nights in a row that I haven't been home. I can tell she misses the attention.

 Pick me! Pick me!! urlLink Queer Eye for the Straight Girl !

 Tonight I am going to see urlLink Nunsense with my friend Michele. She has season tickets for the Broadway Series that comes to town and I am lucky enough to receive an invitation to go with her one a season.

 I quit reading urlLink Name & Address Withheld last night. I'm tired of stories that focus on characters who believe affairs are ok because it's a love-less marriage. Bullshit. Don't be sleeping with someone who doesn't know you're married and then crawl home and into bed with your wife. But alas, I read the last page and of course the scoundrel and the "other woman" end up living happily ever after. Hmfph. Frankly, I think I have hit a reading wall. I couldn't finish this one and now the other two ( urlLink Middlesex and urlLink Atonement ) are not interesting me at all. For those of you who are keeping track of my "buy no books" New Year's resolution . . . In case you were wondering if I bought urlLink Stitch 'N Bitch: The Knitter's Handbook ~ I paid for it with a gift card. It was only the second time I'd been in a bookstore this year. Lemme tell you, I have to walk through really, really fast. I feel like if I pause and look over the "New" section I'd be a goner. So far this year, I have bought a two urlLink Flat Stanley books for my Godson's birthday. Everything else I've read has been from the library. Go me!

 Bah. I am so bad at math that even Quicken can kick my ass. I've spent hours working on setting up a 2004 account. Hours .

 What's up with Coral and Julie? Anyone?

 When I woke up this morning my first thought was, I hope I'm in a better mood today . I was in a really frustrated mood yesterday. When I went to the shelter I scanned the room and didn't see [oops ~ almost wrote her name here] my little princess. I bolstered myself with You knew this was coming and looked for someone else to play with. As I walked past the infant room I saw her. And she saw me. And she came straight to me with a huge grin. I am tearing up as I write this. That little girl has stolen my heart. She's not the first. Maybe the third child I have fallen in love with in the last year. And I suspect there are more in my future. But yesterday I was really beating myself up about the foster thing. I wish I could call and ask for speed fostering classes so I can bring her home now. Earlier in the year when I decided not to take the fostering class, it was because of the depression. Because I felt like I couldn't handle it (meals, baths, travel, etc). But now I know that's not true. I know she would become my life and everything would be ok. I am so confused.

 I got lower level! I got lower level! *doing my happy dance* Two concerts a mere 10 days apart!

 We've had quite a bit of rain the last few days. Just in time for all the Final Four visitors. It is clear right now and I hope it stays that way (more rain has been predicted) so that all these folks can get out and spend their money in our fine city. With all the rain my yard is starting to look a little overgrown. I'd really , really hoped that Dayne would continue mowing my yard this year, but I think he felt guilty about taking the money from my yard man ~ who can use it ~ but last year he saved me hundreds of dollars. Anyway, he mowed their yard earlier in the week and not mine. *sigh*

 I saw my psychiatrist (not to be confused with my psychologist) this week. I told her I'd like to be back at an 8 (10 being the best) and that right now I'm a 6. We agreed to stay the course for six more weeks to let give the combination more time. We talked exactly 15 minutes for &#36;110. Man, I am in the wrong business. (And yes, that amount includes my insurance coverage).

 I'm trying to make up for the quiet week. Can you tell?

 I read yesterday (boy, I sure like to start everything with I, huh?) on urlLink MSNBC how research shows that "the hormonal changes that occur when humans and dogs interact could help people cope with depression and certain stress-related disorders. Preliminary results from a study show that a few minutes of stroking our pet dog prompts a release of a number of "feel good" hormones in humans, including serotonin, prolactin and oxytocin." Shoot. I wish I hadn't had such a bad experience with George (remind me to post pictures of the remaining damage in my bathroom some time). Maybe I need a smaller dog. Any suggestions for a low-maintenance dog?

 I think another quiet issue is I've been knitting when I would normally be sitting in front of the computer. Don't worry, I'm still in the "new toy" phase and we know that will taper off.

 I know I've been quietly lately. I've decided I can't think and blog at the same time. On Tuesday I called for the foster parent class information. And I've been sick to my stomach ever since. I've found that if something is really bothering it makes my stomach crabby. Usually it's something I'm trying to ignore. It was only last night that I made the correlation between my stomach issues and when they started and why that might be. Last night I decided it means I am still not ready to contemplate being a foster. That no matter how much I love those kids on Sunday, I am not ready to bring one into my home. And that hurts my heart. I've decided that I need to find other ways to be involved. So I am going to nominate myself for the Shelters Volunteer Council.

 I'm waiting impatiently for 10 a.m. That's when I can buy more urlLink Prince tickets!! He'll be in San Antonio on June 9 and this time, I have someone to go with -- Kristy's old boss Gloria (yes! Gloria).

 Someone asked what happened to my police officer friend. He hasn't been back. I'm guessing he remembers my personality well enough to know that what he did was out of bounds and that I would call him on it. And what man wants to face the wrath of me?

 I has an interesting hit this morning from a search for "knitting serotonin." I thought it was an interesting combination, so I decided to see what they found. Apparently, it's been proven that knitting can help release serotonins that fight depression. Good to know.

 Even though she would never admit it, I think Cory missed me. I say this because she is laying on one of my arms, so I am typing with one hand only. Yeah, I missed her too (and that's why I am letting her lay on me/keyboard).

 Oh, and if I get a new job and make more money, I'm definitely getting DSL or something to make this puppy work faster.

 You know what? I'm not really happy to be home. It means I have to go to work tomorrow. And you know what? I don't wanna. I think if nothing else, this trip reiterated to me that I need to get the hell out of dodge. And soon.

 Can you believe I stayed away from a computer for nearly five full days? Me either. Vegas was grand. I really had a great time and it was so good to get away from the drudgery of my life. Red Rock was awesome. I think I may have found something I really enjoy doing -- hiking. Yes, me! The trail we took was a simple one, but I really enjoyed being in the great outdoors, seeing the world up close. Prince was . . . well . . . in a word . . . awesome . The concert wasn't really what I was expecting, but I so enjoyed seeing him and can hardly wait until next week. I found the tempo to be mellower than I expected. More jazzy. But, he was Prince. And he is such the showman. And musician. And comedian. He did a set sitting down with an acoustic guitar. The version he did of Little Red Corvette just blew me away. Really, it bought the guy next to me to tears. It was awesome.

 I'm off to Las Vegas in just a little while. I'll try to check in during the week.

 Oh, people. That couldn't have gone better if I'd scripted the interview myself. I know I will at least have a second interview. If not an offer.

 I was going to post about nerves and my stomach this morning. Then I opened an e-mail from my brother. Ugh. Talk about a change in my thought process. Caroline (his granddaughter) was in the hospital from last Thursday (20 May) till Sunday with what was diagnosed as "reflex." They appear to have her medication worked out now and she's doing much better. It was a bad time for Emily and Sean - it's tough having your infant in the hospital. I need to let you know that last week Ernie (our brother) was diagnosed with urlLink Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). He was admitted to Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas Friday (21 May) and will be there about 1 month. Although AML is a very aggressive form of leukemia, Ernie is in excellent condition, he was diagnosed very early, and had not developed any of the side effects most patients have developed before it is diagnosed. When I visited him Sunday his spirits were high and he was feeling good. We were shocked when told he will be in the hospital a month. But we found out that because AML is so aggressive, the chemo treatment to fight it is equally aggressive. Although right now hes feeling well and would like visitors or phone calls, he will become weak as the chemo builds in his body and his immune system will become non-existent. At that point, which is probably 2 weeks off, he may not be allowed visitors. His room phone has a data port - he will be hooking his laptop to it and checking his e-mail from there. Today, 25 May, is his birthday. Interesting timing, no?

 Wolf wants to know urlLink why others blog . If you blog, why don't you go tell him?

 That's the guy Adriana. My uncle Tony. The guy I'm going to hell for. - urlLink Christopher Moltisanti Oh Christopher, how could you? Even though I knew urlLink what was going to happen , it was still hard to watch.

 It's been nearly 12 years since my last interview. To say I am a little nervous is quite the understatement. But, I'm also excited about the prospect of an interview. It will give me a chance to practice my spiel. My suit is pressed and ready to go, along with the business casual clothes I will change into after. Trust me, it would look very weird if I showed up at the office in a suit. I am doing laundry, tidying up some and need to wash the dishes and pack (plus watch The Soprano's episode I missed last night, even though a web headline today totally blew it for me). Anyone have a sure fire question I should ask in the interview?

 urlLink That was a What the hell? cliffhanger. Oh, sure, last year they had a What the hell cliffhanger, but it was exciting and intriguing -- wondering how they could ever explain that storyline. Tonight was a plain old head-scratching What the hell??

 I spent part of my afternoon sweating it out in the yard. Mom brought me some more plants for the flower beds, so I was digging holes, etc... She brought some dirt for me to use, so I was scooping it in around the new plants. After the third or fourth handful, I got a big whiff of, well, shit. Is this what I think I smell? "Well, it does have horse manure in it." Ewwww, I'm using my hands! Yes, I did think it was just special planting dirt. I'm off to an urlLink Alias season finale party.

 One thing that really struck me yesterday was how scaly my Godmother's skin was. Her whole body was. She was peeling like she'd been sunburned and the dead skin was finally coming off. I could've pulled large sheets of skin from her. Even the inside of her ears were peeling. She doesn't know how to do the things she used to. Like using lotion. I was surprised at how quickly she stripped down to her skivvys to let me do her hair. Her bra was on backwards. We drove her by Grace Place, a local adult day care for Alzheimer's patients. I was disappointed that they were closed (even though their hours said they should have been open). I think she would've walked through it with mom and I. More readily so than with her husband. I looked it up online last night. It is &#36;35 a full day and &#36;24 a half day. I wonder if Medicaid helps with that. Yesterday she told me, "There's your mom Cassie." Cassie is her deceased sister. At least she knew the person to be my mom. As we drove through a parking lot, she pointed out a woman walking on the side walk, "Look at how fat she is." And she was. 300 lbs maybe. Then she said, "Oh, I shouldn't have said that." I told her, Just as long as you don't say it too her . "Oh, ok."

 When I grow up I want to file, all day... I wanna claw my way up to middle management... be replaced on a whim... I wanna have a brown nose... I wanna be a yes-man... Yes-woman... Yes sir, coming sir.... Anything for a raise sir... When I grow up... I wanna be under-appreciated ... be paid less for doing the same job... I wanna be forced into early retirement. I loved that urlLink Monster commercial. I've been thinking about it a lot since I decided to start looking for a new job. Yeah, I know that I've talked about it before, but things are irrevocably broken between my boss and I. It's time for me to go. Go where is the question. I sent out some resumes May 14 and I have an interview on Tuesday. It is with an internationally known organization in the medical field. It is a director position for a lot more money than I am making. Thing is, I can't just accept because of the money. I need to make sure this position will be a good fit for me. And frankly, I'm not sure I want to be a "suit" any more. One of the more difficult things I've done this week was ask the president of my company if he would be a reference for me. I was pretty sure he would say yes. We get along really well and I know my work for him has always been superlative. I had an appointment with him for next Tuesday at 2 p.m. My interview is at 9:30 a.m. His schedule between that moment and Monday p.m. were so packed his assistant asked if I could just e-mail it to him. Um, no... She called back nearly two hours later to tell me he could see me now. As I walked into his office he got off the phone and came to sit next to me. "OK, what's going on? I didn't think anything of it when you made an appointment to see me, but when it needed to be sooner I knew something was up." God love him. So I went into my spiel about after 12 years needing to find new challenges and it was time to look elsewhere. That this wasn't a rush judgment on my part. That I have an interview scheduled before we were supposed to meet. And would he be a reference for me. "I would be honored." He told me he knew the exact moment I started thinking about it. That he was grateful that I took the year to let things settle. He asked me where the interview was and told me he's on the Board of the organization. Whoo-hoo me!! Then he went on to talk about the woman I would be interviewing with. Someone he's known since childhood. He grew up with her children. I could almost hear the job offer in my head. Then he told me that he could see where, "if she was in a bad mood, she might take it out on other people." Mmmm. Great. And yes, I trust his opinion. "I totally understand where you are coming from. This will be an awful loss for the company, but I will personally miss you." And then he hugged me. I tried not to cry as I walked to the elevator.

 I've just been a good deeds kind of girl today. Mom needed help with taking her recycling in. So we loaded up her car and my car with smashed cans. Took them to the recycle place. Turns out she had collected 116 lbs of cans for just over &#36;50. She then donates that money to a missionary league. Lots of people help by saving their cans for her. A bar even saves the pull tabs (45 lbs was just pull tabs). My Godparents where having a garage sale and we stopped by to see if we could pick up some lunch. They'd already eaten by the time we got there, so we decided we were just going to go our own way. My Godmother specifically asked to go with us. So we sent her in to change. My Godfather said he feels like she's failed more in the last two weeks than all of last year. He told us that he'd been trying to get to let him color her hair, but she wouldn't let him. When she came back in I asked her about it and she agreed to let me do it for her later. So we went to eat (and she ate again). Then went to a flower show. Then to the mall. Then to her house, where I colored her hair. It was kind of nerve-wracking, what with my red history. But it turned out a really nice medium brown. Maybe a shade too dark for her, but it looked so much better. Then I took the scissors to her and trimmed her hair. I don't know that I did a fab job. I need to take her to get a real cut. Then mom and I helped pack away the garage sale stuff. I came home, took a shower and watched urlLink Deliver us from Eva . Oh, and yesterday on my way back from the doctor (Did I ever mention that I had a parasite and a week of antibiotics finally appeased my gastrointestinal situation? My Dr. said it probably came from fruit or veggies that weren't washed well), I stopped at McD's to pick up some hot fudge sundaes and apples pies for my co-workers. On the way from my parking lot, a street person stopped me and asked if she could have one. I hesitated just one second before giving her mine. "Thank you so much," she called after me.

 Just a post to test my ping.

 I really liked the season finale of urlLink Joan of Arcadia tonight. I think it's going to be very interesting to watch her wrestle with this new doubt. Course, I also loved the last episode of urlLink The Soprano's while many others really, really disliked it. I loved the peak into Tony's psyche. I thought it was interesting, his reaction to all the dead people in his life. Sure it was a tad long, but I liked waiting to see who would pop-up next. I liked seeing Tony struggle with the "need" to kill his cousin, when he obviously doesn't want to. I loved when he called Carmela to cancel the fishing trip but ended up talking to her about the dream. And how she knew exactly what to say and which questions to ask. I thought it was a rare glance at true intimacy in Tony and Carmela's relationship.

 urlLink ::Beginnings, Middles and Ends:: Onesome-Beginnings: Are there any television shows out there that you've watched regularly from the very beginning? Or for those of you not into TV, any book authors that you've read from the very beginning? Yes, I've watched urlLink Alias from the very first episode. As a reader, I fell for urlLink Jennifer Weiner right away. Twosome-Middles: What about shows that you came into in the middle of the season but immediately grabbed your attention and turned you into a die-hard fan? Again, for non-TV fans, have you ever begun reading a series of books in the middle and then just had to read everything else in the series? I didn't start at the beginning (cause I thought the subject was a little weird), so I have to say urlLink Six Feet Under . As a reader, I have become a urlLink Marian Keyes fan and have read all of her books (except for urlLink The Other Side of the Story ). Threesome-And Ends: Recently, a number of big name shows have ended, Friends, Fraiser, The Drew Carey Show, and the cult hit, Angel. Did you watch any of the big finales? Have you ever been really sad to see a show go? Ok, readers, here's one for you. Have you ever read the end of a book first? Why? ;) I was disappointed in the Friends finale, but loved the end of Fraiser. There have been many shows I've been sad to see go: urlLink Once and Again , urlLink Homefront , urlLink Sports Night , urlLink Get Real , urlLink The Pretender , urlLink Quantum Leap and I'm sure many more.

 As you know, I've been trying forever how to do the update I need for my Nikon. I've been able to download, but not upload the fix to my camera. Earlier this week I finally broke down and called the "official" local Nikon repair place to see what it would cost to have them do it. Yeah, they fessed up that they'd never worked on a CoolPix. Tonight I called the tech support, they walked me through in nothing flat and the fix is in. That's what I get for not calling sooner.

 A woman suspects her husband is cheating on her. One day she calls home and a strange woman answers. Wife: Who is this? Maid: This is the maid. Wife: We don't have a maid. Maid: I was hired this morning by the man of the house. Wife: Well, this is his wife. Is he there? Maid: He's upstairs in the bedroom with someone whom I assumed was his wife. The wife is livid, gasping for air. She says to the maid... "Listen, would you like to make $50,000?" Maid: What will I have to do? Wife: I want you to take my gun from the top desk drawer and shoot him and the woman he's with. The maid puts the phone down. The wife hears footsteps and the gunshots, then more footsteps. Maid: What do I do with the bodies? Wife: Just drag them out and throw them in the swimming pool. Maid: But there's no pool here. (A long pause) Wife: Oh crap!... Is this 832-4821?

Real women: buy boxed mashed potato mix and you don't have to worry about the potatoes growing arms or legs. *** Ladies: If you accidentally over salt a dish while its still cooking, drop in a peeled potato and it will absorb the excess salt for an instant fix-me up.

 I hit a quicky baby shower on my way home from work and decided to stop in for a trim. It's only been three weeks and my hair was too long already! I made it home mid-way into urlLink Gilmore Girls . I was in heaven when urlLink Luke told urlLink Lorelai to "stand still." And then when she told him to stand still. Be still my fluttering heart. I mean, really. Who wouldn't stand still for this guy?? I was sad for urlLink Rory though.

 A new urlLink meme about TV! How perfect for me!! 1. What is your favorite TV theme song? urlLink The Soprano's . You woke up this morning. Got yourself a gun. Mama always said you'd be the Chosen One. 2. Which song drives you crazy enough to hit mute on the remote? Ugh. urlLink Fiesta Texas has this ongoing series of commercials and the music just drives me nuts. I muted it just yesterday. No TV show theme music comes to mind. 3. Which song are your proud to say you remember (most of) the lyrics to??? Here's the story of a lovely lady Who was bringing up three very lovely girls. All of them had hair of gold, like their mother, The youngest one in curls. Here's the store, of a man named Brady, Who was busy with three boys of his own, They were four men, living all together, Yet they were all alone. Till the one day when the lady met this fellow And they knew it was much more than a hunch, That this group would somehow form a family. That's the way we all became the Brady Bunch. The Brady Bunch, That's the way we all became the Brady Bunch. The Brady Bunch.

 urlLink Lee is on the other side of the world and found this urlLink Alias scoop before me?? NO urlLink Alias until urlLink 2005 ???

 As you might well imagine, a deafening silence fell across our city last Thursday. And it squashed us with a big thud early Saturday morning. You can see it in our faces. As if the loss was personally ours. I truly didn't think we could win this series until game one. And then game two made me think of the unimaginable. We all watched with baited breath. And then during game three, our thoughts became a reality. I saw urlLink Timmy on the news tonight as he called out from his pick-up, "Have a nice summer." Only if you practice your freethrows. Happy 22nd Birthday urlLink Tony .

 I had to take a break and watch urlLink RW/RR: The Inferno . I hope urlLink Katie kicks some RR's ass.

 "There's no 'I' in 'TEAM.' There is an 'M' and an 'E,' though." -- urlLink Carson , to straight guy/gym teacher Mark

 Whoo-hoo! I've got my blog back! Oh, I have missed you so! Thanks to those who e-mailed to make sure I was alright. And for the comments I was just able to read tonight. When I changed templates, I received an error message that wouldn't allow me to post anything. Thankfully, the guys at Blogger were finally able to fix it for me. Everyday I have thought of something to write about. And everyday I couldn't, I spent less and less time at my computer. Which was good in a way, but something was definitely missing from my life. I quickly decided I didn't like the Blogger comments, so I've put back the YACCS comments. Forget anonymous! I want to know who has what to say!!

 I'd been thinking about coming up with a new look for the site. Seems every year or so I need a change. And then, presto! Blogger adds enhancements and voila ~ new templates. I'm still trying to figure out the new template to add back my usual listings. Hopefully it won't take me too long.

 Since the Friday Five is kaput again, here's the the urlLink Tart Five I found via urlLink Zuly : 1. Whats the hardest lesson you ever learned? That just because you love someone doesn't mean they're the right person for you. 2. Describe your style. I don't think I really have a style. I wish I did have something more defined. I'm kind of a mish-mash ~ in all aspects of my life. 3. What is comfort to you? Time spent with family and friends. Hearing Cory start to purr when she sees me coming. A good book. 4. If you could give advice to someone that just graduated from high school...what 3 pieces of advice would you give? Major in what you want to study, not what your parents think you ought to do so you can have a job for the rest of your life. Do not apply for any credit cards in college. Try new things ... people, clothes, music, hair ... now's the time to figure out who you are. 5. What kind of activities keep you busy in the summer? I'm not an outdoorsy kind of gal, so I do pretty much the same activities year round ~ nothing special in the summer.

 urlLink Thursday Threesome Onesome: Something old - Do you have anything that you've owned simply forever? A cherished childhood toy, an antique handed down through the family... I keep a blanket my Godmother croqueted many, many years ago for me on my bed all the time. Even in summer. Twosome: Something new - Buy anything new lately? Flip-flops? Threesome: Something borrowed - Ever borrowed anything and never returned it? Not that I can think of. Guilty conscience, I guess. Bonus: Something blue - See anything blue from where you are? What is it? The map for my Quarters of 50 States collection.

 Oh, and I'd have been really pissed if I set my VCR to record from 8-9 p.m., when urlLink the show really ran to 9:04 p.m.

 Really, I had no idea urlLink she was going to get off that plane. Shocking. I think the perfect ending would have been only one baby for urlLink Monica and urlLink Chandler (who brings home two preemie babies two hours after birth?), and then having Monica find out she was pregnant.

 Good Lord. I know urlLink my team isn't trying to give me a heart attack, but really . . .

 Now that I am -0.8 lbs from being -10 lbs, I did what any sensible dieter does for dinner. A urlLink Chris Madrid's Cheeseburger, fries and a Miller Lite. Damn. I was hoping they'd have a picture of the burger online so you could see what a great burger it is.

 The neighbor's fence as seen from my porch

 "Man, there is no controversy here at all. We have not even had a skirmish in practice -- no pushing, no nothing -- and that is the first time I have ever been on an NBA team where that has not happened. It is just a great atmosphere. Guys are cool, laid-back. There are no flashy guys on our team." -- urlLink Robert Horry . " . . . first time I have ever been on an NBA team where that has not happened . . ." Sad, no?

 Wow! My urlLink Google toolbar just blocked my 1,000th pop-up ad. urlLink Go Google !!

 There was an ugly accident at our intersection tonight. One car was hit so hard it swung around up into the corner yard and through an almost brand new privacy fence. Amazingly no one was hurt. I just heard this huge crash, grabbed my phone and ran outside. The woman in the car (in the yard) had to climb out the window. It took forever for the police to show up to file the report ~ the drivers just let minutes ago ~ about 90 minutes post-crash. I'd have taken photos, but it seemed a little paparazzi-ish. It was during urlLink Gilmore Girls , so I almost missed urlLink Luke figuring out (finally) that urlLink Lorelai is his soulmate.

 I think I sit in front of the boob tube on Monday night more than any other time. Guess I just need to veg out from work. That and urlLink The Soprano's are on.

 I got a hit today for "Lakers" + "crying" ~ tee hee hee!

 I can't believe the third season of urlLink Alias is almost over. Just the season finale remains. And it's only an hour. Oh, well. There's no way they can top what happened urlLink last year . I just love urlLink Marshall . He is so cleverly written. "Besides, I like working for the good guys." I think urlLink Vivica Fox would make an excellent addition to the show. As a good guy gal, of course. urlLink Jack and Katya? Ewww. It's nice to see urlLink Isabella Rossellini , but she's no urlLink Lena Olin / urlLink Irina Derevko . Frankly, I was not blown away by the "I love Sydney" revelation in the preview. And, "I hate you!" just doesn't adequately communicate what we've all been feeling. "I'm going to kill you bitch! " "Die bitch Die!" "Rot in hell bitch! " ~ something along that line. Um, no I don't have strong feelings about urlLink Lauren .

 I am so a flip-flop convert.

 The irony of today is that it was the best weekend day we've had in forever (sunny and 76&deg;). And 90% of San Antonio spent it inside watching TV.

 NBA TV analyst, and former Lakers legend, Gail Goodrich predicts: "Ultimately, while my heart is in Los Angeles, I think San Antonio right now has a better basketball team. I have to pick urlLink San Antonio ."

 Whoot! urlLink There it is!

 For some reason the kids at the shelter were very annoying to me today. I finally picked up a restless little one from his bouncer and sat in a rocker with him. For over an hour we just sat there. Both of us calmer, away from the madhouse. He drifted off to sleep but I woke him for a bottle. He sucked down all six ounces, burped and fell asleep again.

 I was up late last night IMing with some folks. Cory was so funny. She's used to us going to bed at certain time. Every once in a while she'd just up on my lap like, "Mooooom, it's time for bed." Finally she curled up in a ball behind me. She sure stretched out on the warm electric blanket though.

 What's your urlLink Pantone Birthday Color ? For my birth month, I'm Marigold. And for my birth day I am Sun Orange. I am so Sun Orange (hence the orange office).

 I am really so tired of my gatrointestinal distress. If you're keeping track, yes, Tuesday will be a full two weeks. I'd be ok if I was losing weight, but alas no. I know I should go to the doctor and usually I'm pretty good about it when I don't feel good. But there's just something about having to turn in the requested "sample." Ewww.... TMI?

 USAToday prediction for the Spurs / Lakers series: urlLink Spurs in six .

 I wonder why I can ping on one blog but not another?

 Here I am at home alone on a Saturday night. I know for a lot of singles this would be the worst thing ever. But I'm used to it. Not that I wouldn't mind meeting someone. When I first started blogging, I used to get hit on by a lot of gay men. Needless to say, when I wrote back as me, I never heard from them again. Someone once told me that it's because I never blog about men or relationships. And, yeah. I don't. I suppose if there was one around it would come up. But there's not. Sometimes I think I will never get married. Sometimes I think someone special might come along. Although, I'm not quite sure how he'll find me on my couch. 99% of the time I don't even think about dating or having a guy in my life (except when I need some manual labor). But there are moments. Twinges. When I wish that there was someone there with their arm around me. Or holding my hand. Or laying next to me in bed. I stay single because it's what I know. I grew up without a dad and just mom around, so that's what I know. A woman making her own way in the world. Pretty much the same way she grew up. I'd like to think I could break the cycle. My brother did in a way. Married 29 years with two kids. But, he's a man, so it's different. The men that have been in my life have been men who leave. Just like my dad. I don't know how we do it, picking a man just like dad, but we do. So I stay single. It doesn't define who I am. Although, I sure would like to have sex on a more frequent basis.

 I watched urlLink The Matrix Reloaded tonight. I was totally blown away by urlLink The Matrix . This one was as intriguing, except for the fight scenes. I hate it when they use wires and cg to "wow" us.

 I spent some time last night re-reading sections of my blog looking for something in particular. It's funny how reading can take you back to that exact moment. Conjure up the same emotion. What I found most interesting is that I'm funny. Silly of me to say, no? Or conceited. But sometimes I laughed out loud at my own words. But in looking back I couldn't remember if I meant to be funny (sometimes I do try) or if it just came out that way.

 Stepping outside, I would never believe it is May 1. It is 57&deg; outside.

 Kristy - why are you at work? (I don't have your work e-mail at home)

 July 1 means there is new list for the urlLink 26 Things scavenger hunt. The sun came out today. It hurt my eyes. A new site to visit: urlLink Natalieville . urlLink More on Layne : "Point being, for whatever reason, people want Layne and Aconit and Kaycee and Howard Dean to be real." Howard Dean. Tee-hee-hee. Helpful advice from urlLink ehow on an amazing number of topics. Like: urlLink How to bath a cat . Something I will never do, since I value my life. "Gently hold on to the back of her neck if she tries to escape." Ha. They haven't met Cory. Oh, and I moved into my house two years ago yesterday.

 I had a panic attack today. I haven't had one in over two years. I did a breathing exercise and worked through it pretty quickly. Thankfully no one saw. I just worked myself into a tizzy about too much debt and paying bills on a lower salary (should I get the school district job). Or worse, what if I'm just fired? I'm better now, but it shocked me at the time. I never thought I would have another one ever again. We tweaked my meds one week ago. I have ringing in my ears now, aka urlLink tinnitus . You know when you leave a concert and you get that little buzzing noise in your ears? That's what it sounds like in my head right now. I talked with the psychiatrist today and she asked me to tough it out a few more weeks. Weeks? Luckily it isn't too bothersome and I have been able to fall asleep to one of those motivational affirmation tapes, so maybe something good will plant itself in my psyche.

 One of the girls in my office is at that age where all of her friends are getting married. You know that age. Everyone asks you to be in their wedding, so there are dresses and gifts and showers and bachlorette parties. It goes on and on. I told her that it's just a phase and it will pass. Until the babies start coming. Then there are gifts and showers and diapers. And then there's the divorce and re-marriage phase. I remember that age well. I'm at the age now where my mom's peers are dying. We went to the funeral of her best friend's husband today. His son-in-law gave a truthful eulogy. He didn't try to brush over the intricacies of a man he's known for 48 years. Yeah, Bick was a crotchety old guy. But he was Phyllis' husband, so we went. Phyllis has been gone two years how. Hard to believe. Ken talked about the two of them over the years. There was laughter and tears and showers (yes, it's still raining).

 I watched urlLink Everyday People on HBO tonight. Although I have to admit when it ended I said, Whaaa? It's not often that they can get a surprise ending past me! I've really liked many of the films they've done themselves ( urlLink Something the Lord Made , urlLink Iron Jawed Angels , urlLink Real Women Have Curves , urlLink My House in Umbria and urlLink Normal ).

 With all the sadness and trauma going on in the world at the moment, it is worth reflecting on the death of a very important person which almost went unnoticed last week. Larry La Prise, the man who wrote "The Hokey Pokey," died peacefully at age 93. The most traumatic part for his family was getting him into the coffin. They put his left leg in; and then the trouble started......

 According to my urlLink Bad Girl calendar , today is National Bra Burning Day. "Whether your bra is suddenly too small and too tight or chronically half-empty, today is your day to celebrate. Ask your guests to wear their most uncomfortable, ill-fitting brassieres. When the time is right, bras are torn off and tossed into a non-flammable container, doused with gasoline and torched! A ceremonial chant as you dance around the burning pyre (bouncing au natural) always heightens the thrill." Mmmm. Wonder what the chant should be?

 I've learned something new about myself. Since being able to get drunk in the smell of books at the library, I've discovered there are some books I really don't like. Shocking revelation, I know, but before when I bought books I was going to finish them by damn because I paid for them. Not so anymore. I've found my pattern of what I do when I don't want to continue reading a book. I read the ending. Just the last few pages. And then I pick up the next book. That happened this week with urlLink Say When by Elizabeth Berg. I normally love her books, but only got a few chapters in when I decided to read the ending. That's when I realized what I was doing. I now knew what happened and I didn't care enough to find out why or how, so I put the book in my return pile. Then I picked up urlLink The Best Awful by Carrie Fisher. Now there was a novel I could sink my teeth in. Sure it's a wild story of being bi-polar, but I found it to be courageous and full of black humor. My kind of read. So from now on, I am just going to put a strike through the books I don't finish. Before I was just not putting them on the list. Oh, have you tried urlLink A9 ?

 I like to check out my referrals each day to see how and why people come here. I've noticed a sharp increase in search engine hits since the Blogger dashboard was implemented. Some of them make me wonder, some of them make me laugh. For a while I kept getting hits for "calculator" + "Susan." I finally did the search myself to see what it was ... it was a hit for Britney Spears' Boobie Size Calculator. I notice there are quite a few people with a foot fetish. I get a lot of hits for "pretty toes." Which stems back to the recent pedicure. The issue there is my "pretty toes" is followed by Not! I got a great one this morning. Let me just extend my sympathies for the person searching for "my cat is psycho."

 Spent some time together today working on our relationship. First I sat down for the last 20 minutes or so of urlLink Undercover Brother . Which, I admit with some embarrassment, made me laugh my ass off. Now I definitely want to see the whole thing. Then I got sucked into an HBO documentary, urlLink My Flesh and Blood . It's about a family with 11 adopted siblings with special needs. I spent a lot of the 90 minutes with my hands over my mouth in, well, horror. I could not believe what the one young man was living with. He had a disease that kept his skin from sticking to his body . I need to do a search later to see if there's an update anywhere. And then, I watched urlLink Maid in Manhattan . It was cute. Now I am waiting for mom to come over so I can do her hair. Then we are off to a 25th anniversary dinner / dance. But I told mom I have to be home by 9:30p to see the episode of urlLink Six Feet Under that I missed on Father's Day. Priorities, you know.

 Just this week, urlLink Emily posed another of her urlLink controversial questions about overweight bloggers. I agree that a lot of us are overweight (myself included). Do I think it because of blogging that I am overweight? Hold on, let me stop hysterically laughing. Of course not. But a lot of folks to talk about their weight a lot. I know I do on occasion, and did a lot when I bought a bathing suit last year. OK, so that was a long introduction to What Should I Do About My Diet? For the past year+, I have been using urlLink Calorie King to track my food intake, weight etc... I am still in the same weight span I was when I started. (i.e.: up a few pounds, down a few pounds and back.) Ditto urlLink South Beach . Although I have really learned a lot of foods via the beach. I thought I was pretty knowledgeable about stuff, but now I am really conscious about checking sugars when I buy stuff, etc.. I did urlLink Weight Watchers online in 2001. I lost 19 pounds. Of course I have gained that back plus extra. Calorie King is $19.95 a month. Weight Watchers is $44.90 for the first month and $14.95 each additional month. My Calorie King account is getting ready to expire. Do I renew and just, well, try harder? Do I go back to counting points . . . which I really don't want to do the rest of my life.

 I bought an ankle bracelet today. It has red, clear and blue beads ~ just in time for the Fourth of July. I know the others looked at me and thought, "Ankle bracelet?" But I like ankle bracelets. Not the hooker kind, the fun kind. It makes me feel like I am expressing my true self. The pierced nose, funky clothes wearing me. I always wanted to be the artist. Someone who was not mainstream. The eccentric down the road. Instead I am a corporate nobody. I blend. I never wanted to be a blender. I wanted to be different. To stand out. To be me. Sometimes I feel like I am living a black and white version of my technicolor life.

 So it seems our lesbian Layne is someone trying to be "the best daddy and husband I can be." Yep. urlLink A guy. No wonder there was so much woman-on-woman sex. Here's the urlLink detective who tracked her him down.

 I saw the storm coming, again. I left earlier today. Made the mad dash, again. I lost, again.

 I've come home for lunch two days in a row now. It is nice to get away from everyone and everything for a change. And you know, a peanut butter sandwich tastes mighty good on occasion! But today I just keep thinking, Do I have to go back?? It looks like another hard rain coming, maybe I'll get "stuck" at home.

 You know, if I hadn't been reading urlLink Yvonne for a while now, I'd certainly think she was making urlLink this urlLink shit up!

 It's raining like one.

 I swear I didn't nap this evening (I was online chatting with some folks for nearly 5 hours ~ a record for me!). I thought I was tired about 10:15 p.m. and got ready for bed. But alas, no. Here I am wide awake. *sigh*

 Damn the person who didn't patent Celexa correctly. We are tweaking my meds again and I'm in a medicated haze. I fell asleep at my desk this afternoon. Luckily the supervisor wasn't in, so I made a makeshift sweaterpillow. I'm guessing I had my head down a whole hour. I know I didn't sleep the entire time because the office was loud with those people who were working . Truly, right now I could lay down and pass out. But I need not to, you know?

 I've been thinking about the column I was asked to write about being a white girl in a predominately Hispanic city for a new Spanish language weekly. Here's my start: I am a guera. A gringa. A cracker. I drink Big Red with my Mexican food. I can recite the Hail Mary from memory. And I'm not Catholic. I wish I could roll my Rs. I want Mariachi's to play at my wedding. I am a native San Antonian. Guera/gringa = white chick. Ditto cracker. I have 200+ words written, but I'm just not sure it is what I want it to be.

 My favorite guilty pleasure is back: urlLink Who Wants to Marry My Dad? And dad's a hottie!

 urlLink Sydney's personal life the focus next season . Holycrapfuck. They are never going to tie up these freakin' loose ends!

 I just saw the Lenny Kravitz / Target commercial. What'a sellout. But I don't think that about Isaac Mizrahi. Still. I don't like it. Funny that Isaac, Mossimo, Rachel Ashwell and Cynthia Rowley co-branding with Target doesn't bother me a bit, but on Lenny it feels like a sellout.

 Oh, how I want this job. But, what is it with people interviewing months before they need to hire someone??? They said I would not hear from them again until August!! But, I really want this job. It would be perfect for me. Man, I hope I conveyed that. I would coordinate 150 adult continuing education fee-based classes three times a year. The 220 work day year includes all student holidays (minus summer vacation), plus some breaks in between (normally three weeks). I am going to write a superduper follow-up letter and include some of the class manuals I've put together, in addition to some other writing samples. August!! Aaccckkkk!!!

 "Sooz, I really like your hair." If she's told me that once, she's told me 50 times in the short period of time I have been a redhead. The difference today was that she said my nickname. For the first time in years . She said my name. Even though today was a celebration of my Godfather's birthday and Father's Day, my day turned out to be all about her. She said my name.

 She'd spent most of the afternoon incoherent. Sometimes I want to mouth behind her Alzheimer's when she speaks to a stranger, but I don't. I just smiling that knowing smile and try to throw a wink in. But in the car, long after she told me she did not want a haircut, she told me, "I need something to do." She looks so small to me in the passenger seat. Almost wringing her hands, trying to convey something to me. She tells me that she really wants to paint again. But when she tries tp paint, she can't. Well, maybe you can try a different way of paint, not just pictures from photographs. "Yeah." But I could tell she didn't know what I meant, You know, like Picasso, but keep the ear. She laughed, "Um, no." She told me that she gets bored doing nothing all day. What if we could find an arts and crafts place for you to go by yourself. Would you go? At first she shook her head no, but then said, "Well maybe." It could be a place where you sing songs and have new people to talk to and maybe get to paint. "Yeah." Would you go by yourself? "Maybe." What about at the church? Don't they have things there during the week? "Yeah, but he never wants to go" (which is not what we hear). "I need something to do." It must be very frustrating. "Yes!" Mom has been very adamant that she thinks Gina will not go to an adult day care (it's called Grace Place and specializes in patients with Alzheimer's). I think she's wrong. I think if we (mom and I) showed it to her, she would have a different reaction than my Godfather taking her. I think she would think that he was trying to get rid of her, while we would make the place ok. She finally agreed after we took Gina home. I don't think anyone ever talks with her about what's going on and how she feels about it . "I think you're right."

 I've done this before, but saw it over at urlLink DTC and wanted to do it again. 1. Grab the nearest book. 2. Open the book to page 23. 3. Find the fifth sentence. 4. Post the text of the sentence on your blog along with these instructions. "And where'd the goddamned pig go?!" urlLink A Girl Named Zippy

 Screw Layne, this hurts: From shadowsever: Any chance we'll see Lena on Alias? None. She's done, done, done. I'd tell you more, but it makes me cry. From 3littlechicks: So, cry...We'll cry with you, but please spill what you know about Lena and Alias! The producers keep trying, but I've heard she said she's never coming back. Waaahhh...Somebody pass me a hankie. from urlLink Watch with Kristin

 This morning I learned one of the blogs on my blogroll was a hoax. I've been reading Playne Layne for a while. The news made me very cranky. See, I enjoyed my visits to Layne's world. I really did think she was some mixed up kid in her 20s who would eventually figure out her life. I've commented on occasion, but mostly I lurked and watched those who seem so invested in her. Apparently, it's been quite the talk of webworld. I've found site after site challenging if she was real or not. Questioning her similarities to another blogger. People are really riled up about this. Even comparing it to the Kaycee Nicole hoax (which is a little over the top if you ask me). And now that I've read how wrapped up people are in this terrible, terrible thing she's done to us (hey, she never asked for money or claimed to be dying), I feel less disillusioned. Whoever Layne was . . . she was a fabulous writer. Even if it was fiction. Her stories were compelling and I'll miss them.

 I just got home from a free 1.5 hour massage. Ah . . . Because they are students, you can't even tip. It was lovely. I almost feel a little drunk. It was nice to have the hands of a young man in his 20s on my body again. ;-)

 Sometimes my brain writes a whole post but as soon as I sit down at the computer I lose my desire to write. I was thinking about how tired I am today. About how much an interview takes out of you. That you have all that adrenalin pumping to be perky and peppy and "on" during an interview. That's hard enough in itself. But my interview was at 8:30 a.m. and I can tell you that on an average day I am not perky and peppy at 8:30 a.m. That said, the interview went well. She told me that I will be asked for a second interview. She has a few more to interview, then she goes out of town and won't be back to interview until the week of July 5. Yeah, moving at the speed of a snail. I'm not completely sold that this is the right job for me. I'll need to ask a lot more questions next time. I think it's the fundraising part I dislike. I can do it if I need to, I just don't know if I want to do it for a living. Special Events I can coordinate. Ask and ask and ask for cash is something else. I am looking forward to the interview on Monday. I'm really curious to learn more. However the interview is only for 30 minutes. I guess that's long enough to get a good feel for someone and then invite them back.

 When I turn around in my chair at work, this is what I see: That's my immediate supervisor. Yes, we sit back to back. When she turns around she can see what's on my computer and vice versa. We hear each other's phone calls (and I hate it when she comments on mine). We have zero privacy. I bring this up because I have another interview on Monday with a local school district. I have given my mobile number out for return calls and now it's rung twice this week, and my phone never rings. I think she might be on to me. Since tomorrow's interview is at 8:30 a.m., I am going to be "running late." I always hate flat out lying because I figure I'll jinx myself some how (like if I say I have car trouble, I will). What should I say for Monday? It's at 3 p.m. and I'll need to leave about 30-45 minutes before then. Tuesday I have two legitimate doctor appointments. Ideas?

 Another from Dondi . . . On a Sears hairdryer -- Do not use while sleeping. (Damn, and that's the only time I have to work on my hair) On a bag of Fritos -- You could be a winner! No purchase necessary. Details inside. (the shoplifter special?) On a bar of Dial soap -- "Directions: Use like regular soap." (and that would be how???....) On some Swanson frozen dinners -- "Serving suggestion: Defrost." (but, it's "just" a suggestion) On Tesco's Tiramisu dessert (printed on bottom) -- "Do not turn upside down." (well...duh, a bit late, huh!) On Marks & Spencer Bread Pudding -- "Product will be hot after heating." (...and you thought????...) On packaging for a Rowenta iron -- "Do not iron clothes on body." (but wouldn't this save me more time?) On Boot's Children Cough Medicine -- "Do not drive a car or operate machinery after taking this medication." (We could reduce the rate of construction accidents if we could just get those 5-year-olds with head-colds off those forklifts) On Nytol Sleep Aid -- "Warning: May cause drowsiness." (and..I'm taking this because???....) On most brands of Christmas lights -- "For indoor or outdoor use only." (as opposed to...what?) On a Japanese food processor -- "Not to be used for the other use." (now, somebody out there, help me on this. I'm a bit curious.) On Sainsbury's peanuts -- "Warning: contains nuts." (talk about a news flash) On an American Airlines packet of nuts -- "Instructions: Open packet, eat nuts." (Step 3: maybe, uh...fly Delta?) On a child's Superman costume -- "Wearing of this garment does not enable you to fly." (I don't blame the company. I blame the parents for this one.) On a Swedish chainsaw -- "Do not attempt to stop chain with your hands or genitals." (Oh my God...was there a lot of this happening somewhere?)

 A woman calls her boss one morning and tells her that she is staying home because she is not feeling well. "What's the matter?" her boss asks. "I have a case of anal glaucoma," she says in a weak voice. "What the hell is anal glaucoma?" demands her boss. "I just can't see my ass coming into work today."

 Not feeling very chatty these days. Not sure why. Nothing major going on. I'm sure it's just a phase that will pass. Probably sooner rather than later.

 I have an interview on Friday with a non-profit. It's the same one I tried for in the Fall, but got involved too late into the interview process. It's a special events coordinator position. Fingers crossed people! (And prayers if you are so inclined!)

 One saggy boob said to the other saggy boob: "If we don't get some support soon, people will think we're nuts."

 Cary Clack: Last, best hope of us Laker haters rests with the Motor City , San Antonio Express-News [excerpted] Like most native Detroiters, I am rooting passionately for my team, the Detroit Pistons, to beat the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA Finals. It's irrelevant that I wasn't born in Detroit or that I've never actually set foot in Detroit and that my heart bleeds silver and black every 0.4 seconds for the San Antonio Spurs. I'm not alone. We are now the United States of Detroit, minus California. A nation of longtime fans whose allegiance to the Pistons goes all the way back to, well, June 1, when the Pistons emerged from the Eastern Conference Finals as the last barrier between us and the darkness enveloping the globe that would be the Lakers winning another championship. Not since the advent of cars and Motown Records has the city of Detroit been as important for the nation as it is now. This is a classic example of the enemy of my enemy being my friend. It's the philosophy of if you can't beat them, root for someone who can. So Laker fans, please understand that we're cheering against your boys out of tremendous respect true, there's also some hatred, vengeance, disgust, repugnance and horror but respect, nonetheless. Should Pistons coach Larry Brown win his first NBA title and deny Phil Jackson his 10th, it's easy to see a grateful nation carrying him on its shoulders into the White House in November. Never, in my two weeks of being a Pistons fan, have I felt so proud to be a Detroiter.

 Go Pistons!!

 Excellent review of The Soprano's season five: As Chase and company methodically separated Tony from everyone he cares about this season, urlLink they also tried to sever his ties to the audience . Gone were any suggestions of a cuddly mob boss; here was a slovenly, selfish, juvenile clod whose only joy came in making others suffer.

 You know I love it when my neighbors mow my lawn. However, I hate it when they do it when I'm at home. I feel guilty and stupid standing there watching. Or worse yet, being inside my house while they are out in the heat working. I offered to mow last week and was waved off. Today I again got out there and picked up sticks (and a HUGE wad of dog doo), and basically watched. I told D that I hated just watching, but he reassured me that he loved doing yard work and that my yard is actually easier to mow than theirs (less obstacles). I hope one of these days soon I can get on their calendar and take them to dinner someplace nice.

 I really dig the remake of the Go-Go's "Our Lips Are Sealed" by Hilary and Haylie Duff. I listen to the Radio Disney just so I can hear it. Yeah, I am so 12.

 My mom volunteered to take 48 cupcakes in on Monday for Vacation Bible School. Yeah, guess who's making these "Kooky cupcakes"? They are actually cupcakes baked in a sugar cone: Directions Spoon 2-3 tablespoons batter into each KEEBLER Ice Cream Cup. Set upright in ungreased muffin-pan cups. Bake at 350F for about 20 minutes or until wooden pick inserted near center comes out clean. Remove from muffin-pan cups and cool completely on wire racks. Yeah, keeping them balanced and upright is about as easy as you would anticipate. I've only lost one to the floor. So far.

 urlLink Daytime Talk TV 1. Do you watch daytime talk TV? If so, which shows do you watch? Do you prefer the calm shows like Oprah or the wilder side like Jerry Springer? Since I work, I don't have an opportunity to watch them, but when I'm home I try to catch Oprah. Oh, and I like Ellen too. 2. Which daytime talk TV show would you like to be on? What would the topic be? Oprah. Depression. I think it'd be good for other "normal" folks to see that someone just like them can be affected by depression and that it's ok to ask for help. 3. Is there a daytime talk TV show you miss that's no longer on the air? Is there someone you'd like to see get a daytime talk TV show? No. And no. ~Bonus~ Before talk TV took over, game shows ruled the airways during the day, which do you prefer? Or are you a soap opera fan? I was a soap opera fan. I started walking Days of our Lives when I was 12. But, when I was younger we had Gilligan's Island, The Brady Bunch, etc... to fill our afternoons. Way better than Jerry Springer.

 Cory: June 12, 2003 Cory: June 12, 2004 Yes, she looks at me like that all the time. A favorite place to watch the world pass by. A sweet little kitten came into my life one year ago today. Since then she's given me scratched feet, many tripped up walks, escape attempts, gift roaches, black boogers, orange hair every where, games of hide and seek (sometimes I know we are playing, sometimes it's a surprise), warm snuggles at night, giggles at chased tails (again today!) and lots of love. Mom has the prettiest little male Siamese hanging out at her house. He's a real lover and she's been trying to talk me into bringing him home. I think it would be nice for two reasons: 1. A companion for Cory to play with 2. At least one of my cats would be sweet and loving Frankly, I'm afraid Cory would turn him into a terror like her. I mean, I know she loves me. If I'm home, she's within a four feet vicinity of me. I get up and move, she moves. Even if it's the middle of the night and I am just going to the bathroom. She can be very loving, when she wants to. She can also be mean. Which is most of the time. It would be nice to have a cat who likes to cuddle (and for a stray that Siamese likes to cuddle), but ... I think Cory would be so mad at me that she'd beat the crap out of another cat and then that cat would turn ugly for self-defense. I guess if nothing else she'll keep me from becoming one of those crazy old single ladies with 50+ cats running free in a house with no litter box. But really, I love her muchly and my life would not be the same without her.

 Last night was another outstanding Prince concert. Today I have a raging case of PMS, so I figure I shouldn't be posting today and subjecting you with the wrath of a PMSing, chocolate-less woman. Trust me, it's better this way.

 I hadn't heard from her in a while. Now I know why . . .

 Merilu: Have you been having hot flashes? Me: HUH? Merilu: Because you are warm, then cool, then warm and now you are cool again. Me: Um, no? Merilu: Because you never know. My mom was only 38 when hers started. But you're too young. Me: But, I'm 38. Merilu: Oh, I thought you were 35. I'm sure it's nothing. But you know what? I was hot. I thought it was the room temperature. Afterwards we had dinner and I sweated then. Again, I thought it was the room temperature. Gack! Hot flashes?? I'm too young!!

 I had a massage this afternoon. I try to go monthly just to work the kinks out and because I can't afford to go more regularly. Merilu mentioned my lovely bruises (plural I noticed) and focused out some of the muscles tensed from Saturday's flailing around. Speaking of which, the funniest comment of the day came from my friend Sandy: Sandy(bewildered)-"Oh my god, she fell again." Tony(half listening)-"Who, Susan? Is she okay..(as he reads over my shoulder)" Yeah, what does it tell you about the frequency of my tumbles that he knew automatically that the "she" was me? Back to the massage. As I was dressing, I saw one of those head scratcher things that looks like a spider. I tried it out. I almost had a headgasm. You know, like an urlLink eargasm .

 What do you think of this template? Is it hard to read? Feedback, please.

 A new puppy for my Godson & his family: What a cutie!!

 This morning as I walked from the car to my building, I saw a flash of something before my eyes and felt wetness. I looked down, knowing immediately what had happened. I saw nothing on my clothes, but as I took my next step, there it was. Bird poop on my foot. Not my shoe, just my foot. You know it's a Monday when . . .

 Early on I thought I was going to be disappointed in urlLink The Soprano's season finale. Alas, I was not. I thought it was very brave of urlLink Silvio to talk with urlLink Tony the way that he did. I was shocked to see Tony himself kill urlLink TonyB , but I guess that was the best way to handle it. I hope urlLink Christopher will raise in stature now. Although I hated how they talked about urlLink Adrianna . And I thought it was ironic that urlLink Johnny got "sacked" just a few hours/days after he killed his cousin. I'm curious to see how the end the series next year. Who will live? Go to jail? Move on? Die? Frankly, I think Tony Soprano should die. I think that should be the very last thing that happens before the credits roll. Tony being gunned down.

 I was just reading urlLink TVTattle to catch up on the latest TV news. Don't ask me why, but I followed the link to urlLink Nicole Richie flashes her tits . Then I saw a picture of Paris Hilton getting out of a car, and I thought Surely, that's not what I think it is . Unfortunately, I can tell you ~ without a doubt ~ that Paris is not a natural blonde. Shocking, I know. Then (I don't remember how I found this one), I found urlLink Britney Spears' Boobie Size Calculator . Which shows her going up, down, up, up, down, up, up and away!

 Six to eight weeks ago, the former owners of my house brought their daughter over to see if I would mind her doing some filming in the front yard for a class project. Naturally I didn't mind at all, so they stopped back by today for additional footage. I would've loved to have seen her parents faces when they drove up to find the neighbor they hated mowing my front yard.

 Some great stuff from urlLink The Leaky Cauldron : urlLink J.K.Rowling.com has been intricately redesigned. It is now a design of a cluttered desk strewn with gum wrappers, an empty teacup (points to the one who can divine the dregs), newspapers and of course a notebook - and the thing that's of real interest to fans: all of the text is written by J.K. Rowling herself, and contains clues and tidbits about the books. The site reveals that: Ginny's real name is Ginevra. Fred and George were born on April Fool's Day. Sirius' eyes are grey. The lost Weasley cousin's name is Mafalda, and is an unpleasant Slytherin child who is a match for Hermione's talents. The opening chapter of Book Six is a chapter she's been mulling for 13 years. Molly's maiden name is Prewett - she has family members who were killed by Death Eaters. Gilderoy Lockhart really is based on a real person.

 I've seen this one all over the place (most recently at urlLink Meegan's ). Copy/paste and answer the following questions in the comment box (please): 1. Who are you? 2. Have we ever met? 3. Give me a nickname and explain why you picked it. 4. Describe me in one word. 5. What reminds you of me? 6. If you could give me anything, what would it be? 7. Ever wanted to tell me something but didnt? 8. What do you love like a fat kid loves cake? 9. What makes you come back here? I've not posted it here because I didn't think anyone would answer.

 1. Do you try to look hot when you go to the grocery store just in case someone recognizes you from your blog? No. No one will ever recognize me from my blog. You'd think I'd try to look hot to pick up guys, but no on that one too. 2. Are the photos you post Photoshopped or otherwise altered? No. Good idea though. 3. Do you like it when creeps or dorks email you? No. I find most people who take the time to e-mail me are pretty cool people. 4. Do you lie in your blog? No. Not that I can remember anyway. 5. Are you passive-aggressive in your blog? Oh, no. I mean, well, I certainly try not to be, but on occasion people make me really mad and then I have to kick some ass. 6. Do you ever threaten to quit writing so people will tell you not to stop? No. But I've seen it happen on other blogs. 7. Are you in therapy? If not, should you be? If so, is it helping? Yes and yes. 8. Do you delete mean comments? Do you fake nice ones? No, I can't remember getting a mean comment. I have deleted duplicate comments from the same person. Hmmm. Fake nice ones. There's an idea. 9. Have you ever rubbed one out while reading a blog? How about after? No. 10. If your readers knew you in person, would they like you more or like you less? The one reader I've met in person told me I was exactly the same in person and I was online. So I guess if they like me here, they'd like me the same in person. 11. Do you have a job? Yes. And I am looking too. 12. If someone offered you a decent salary to blog full-time without restrictions, would you do it? In a heartbeat. 13. Which blogger do you want to meet in real life? urlLink Kate . urlLink Joanie . urlLink Lisa . urlLink Zuly . urlLink Jimbo . urlLink Yvonne . Plus some of the girls from the urlLink Tiara urlLink Happy urlLink Hour . There are also a couple of commenters/non-bloggers I'd like to meet: Kat, Dondi, Sher, Rebecca, Laura, Kevin and a couple others. 14. Which bloggers have you made out with? Only one. Oh, you mean which one? I never kiss and tell. 15. Do you usually act like you have more money or less money than you really have? Probably more. 16. Does your family read your blog? No. 17. How old is your blog? Three years in August. 18. Do you get more than 1000 page views per day? Do you care? Ha! I've never even seen a 100 page views. Sometimes I think it would be cool to have a larger reader base. But then I've read comments left on other blogs that are so presumptuous and demanding towards those bloggers. I wouldn't like that. 19. Do you have another secret blog in which you write about being depressed, slutty, or a liar? No. What you see here is what you get. 20. Have you ever given another blogger money for his/her writing? No, but I have for blog tools like urlLink Blogrolling . 21. Do you report the money you earn from your blog on your taxes? You can earn money from a blog?? 22. Is blogging narcissistic? Absolutely. 23. Do you feel guilty when you don't post for a long time? Totally. 24. Do you like John Mayer? A hottie! 25. Do you have enemies? I do believe my boss is out to get me, yes. Otherwise I don't think so. 26. Are you lonely? Sometimes. 27. Why bother? Why not? ~ urlLink QuickyChick

 Last night I did something I've never done before. I sat down and read a 337 page hardback from cover-to-cover without stopping. urlLink Bet Me by urlLink Jennifer Crusie sucked me in and I just could not put it down. There's just something about chubby girls in their 30's who find true love that speaks to me (hmmm, wonder why?). Like chicklit? Over 30? Chubby and single? Read it. You'll laugh out loud and shed a tear or two. I did anyway.

 Remember how I said in the TV Tuesday that if my life were a sitcom it would be names after my klutzyness somehow? Well, I hurt myself again yesterday. I'd been watering my plants and was coming back down my two stairs to put the hose back in its place. Apparently flip-flips and a slick porch = a flailing Sooz. I didn't fall all the way down, but I did slam into the door archway pretty hard. After I rectified myself and made sure none of the neighbors saw, I started walking and thought, Ut-oh. It seemed to stretch itself out during the evening, but when I rolled over once during the night. Ut-oh. It's been a long time since I've actually bruised myself. But my right hip/buttock looks lovely. I hate to say it, but this has been a lifelong issue for me. Tripping. Falling. Down stairs, escalators, bowling alleys. In front of people and alone. Because of something. Usually because of nothing but my natural grace. My last "good" fall was not actually the last one here. It was at my apartment. I probably went down a good ten stairs before stopping. My first thought was, I hope nobody saw that . Then as I sat there realizing I'd truly hurt myself I thought, I sure hope someone sees me . I should let my friend Sandy be a guest blogger sometime. She's been witness to more than her share. And yes, she always makes sure I'm ok. Right after she stops laughing.

 Mom and I stopped at a local beauty college yesterday to pick-up a price list. We'd like to take my Godmother there for a haircut. On impulse, mom signed up to get a haircut and I asked for a pedicure. It was &#36;15 + &#36;3 tip. Much better than the &#36;65 I was quoted at The Mirage and &#36;55 at The Aladdin!! Being a student, she was still pretty unsure of herself and for whatever reason, my toes kept twitching (?!?!). I wanted to tell her to hold onto them tighter, but she didn't speak English. We tried a little poor English / poor Spanish, but with not much luck. My mom came in to wait for me and usually she has better luck with her poquito Spanish. So the pedicurist was telling her something in Spanish and mom said, "She says you have pretty toes." I started to laugh, No, she's trying to tell you my toes are twitching. And then the pedicurist (is that what you call them) made twitching motions with her fingers. See?

 ok, now that I have urlLink that out of my system... I couldn't get online and stay online last night. I had all these things to post . . . and now can I remember them? No.

 The both of them. urlLink Idiots .

 I loved urlLink Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban . It by far exceeded my expectations and is now my favorite movie of the series. I knew within the first few minutes that I would want to see the movie again -- soon. I'd love for Cuarn to director the remaining films (alas, no). Cuarn seemed to really "get" the books and used his experence to set the tone with darker hues and more varied lighting. It was nice to see more of Hogwarts and the grounds. A simple slight redesign of the castle also set the tone for a more mature and intense film. To me it made the Hogwarts more compelling. I enjoyed seeing the paintings / pictures come to life. I thought the kids looked more like the teens they are. In clothes, hair (Draco!) and attitudes. I wish there had been more of Ron. I find his comedic timing impeccable, but this time he seemed to be the outsider while Hermoine really stepped to the forefront. Girl power! The dementors were exactly as I had imagined them. The werewolf not so much. The hippogriff was perfect. The homage to "I'm the king of the world" was cute. The adult actors in these movies are such great character actors. It's good to look at Sirius Black and not think Oh, there's Gary Oldman . David Thewlis as Lupin was straight on and I look forward to seeing him in the future. The transition of Michael Gambon to Albus Dumbledore was seamless. Sure, Cuarn took some artistic license with parts of the film. Scenes missing, out-of-order storyline. But the "sacrifice" is well worth the movie we are given. All in all, as Ron would say, Bloody Brilliant!

 A non-profit called about my resume and a Special Event Coordinator position they have open. She's e-mailing the job description and calling next week to set-up an interview. Yay!

 via Dondi: This is a story about a couple who had been happily married for years. The only friction in their marriage was the husband's habit of farting loudly every morning when he awoke. The noise would wake his wife and the smell would make her eyes water and make her gasp for air. Every morning she would plead with him to stop ripping them off because it was making her sick. He told her he couldn't stop it and that it was perfectly natural. She told him to see a doctor; she was concerned that one day he would blow his guts out. The years went by and he continued to rip them out! Then one Thanksgiving morning as she was preparing the turkey for dinner and he was upstairs sound asleep, she looked at the bowl where she had put the turkey innards and neck, gizzard, liver and all the spare parts and a malicious thought came to her. She took the bowl and went upstairs where her husband was sound asleep and, gently pulling back the bed covers, she pulled back the elastic waistband of his underpants and emptied the bowl of turkey guts into his shorts. Some time later she heard her husband waken with his usual trumpeting which was followed by a blood curdling scream and the sound of frantic footsteps as he ran into the bathroom. The wife could hardly control herself as she rolled on the floor laughing, tears in her eyes! After years of torture she reckoned she had got him back pretty good. About twenty minutes later, her husband came downstairs in his bloodstained underpants with a look of horror on his face. She bit her lip as she asked him what was the matter. He said, "Honey, you were right.All these years you have warned me and I didn't listen to you." "What do you mean?" asked his wife. "Well, you always told me that one day I would end up farting my guts out, and today it finally happened.... But by the grace of God, some Vaseline, and two fingers, I think I got most of them back in."

 Congress is back in session after a recess and now our voices matter more than ever in the fight against breast cancer! We are asking for immediate action to reauthorize two life-saving programs critical to early detection of breast cancer. Congress has not yet acted to reauthorize these programs, and time is running out. We need your help! Don't wait! Urge Congress to take action by urlLink signing the petition right now .

 Yes, I already have my ticket for the 5:20 p.m. showing of urlLink Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban . Whee!

 With the end of "regular" TV, I've been watching movies instead. I love urlLink HBO . On Sunday night, they premiered the excellent urlLink Something The Lord Made . Watch it. Tuesday night I watched urlLink Down With Love . It was a silly throw back to the old Rock Hudson / Doris Day movies. Tonight it was urlLink In the Bedroom on urlLink Encore . I think urlLink Tom Wilkinson is a powerful, subtle actor. I raved about him in another HBO film, urlLink Normal .

 Well, I got rejected twice today. First from a position that I didn't have "the right qualifications for" (um, I think I did, but ok). And second from the job I interviewed for last week. They made the offer to someone else. Which kind of ticks me off. While I said that the interview went really well (and it did), it was also very short. Less than 30 minutes. They didn't ask for writing samples or ask any questions about marketing strategy, etc... They really glowed all over me. The Executive Director told me as they walked me to the elevator, "I know this has been very short, but I feel like I have a good understanding of who you are." I took it positively at the time, but now I think Huh? I'm OK. I have several more resumes out, some are positions with real potential. I suspect the one I would love the most can't afford me. *sigh* Stupid mortgage.

 Very often, cats will leave "gifts" for their owner as a token of love. Cory left me a gift in my shoe for me. I didn't really notice it until I got to work and shook it out of my shoe. A roach. Lovely, no?

 I had an e-mail waiting for me at work today from my brother with Acute Myeloid Leukemia. He signed it with "Love,". And I just don't know about that. See, ours is a pretty dysfunctional families. I didn't meet my father's other children until I was 21. I met them at his funeral. Without me, Ernie is the middle child. I honestly don't know how old he is. 55-60 range - maybe? Anyway, I haven't seen or heard from Ernie in maybe 10 years. I had a falling out with my half-sister and all the boys but Jack sided with her. Can't say I blame them. They had known her longer. It was awkward to e-mail him. But I felt it was the right thing to do. If he dies, will I go to his funeral? Probably not. So there's the love thing. It's not something I take lightly and not a word I throw out to just anyone. Even a blood relative. So when I wrote back today, I just signed it with x's and o's. It was the best I could do.

 urlLink Marathon TV Watching 1. In the US many stations run "marathons" all day on Monday, many stations have also went to running all weekend marathons of old sitcoms. So question number one is: Did you watch any of the marathons running this year? In part? In whole? No. 2. Is there a show you'd like to see run an all day marathon? On the flipside is there a show you'd avoid in marathon? Maybe one that features "before they were stars" actors, like urlLink Square Pegs -n- such. 3. Is there a show/movie/program that brings back special memories for you and what is it? urlLink Moonlighting . I loved Moonlighting. OK, I really loved urlLink Bruce Willis . ~Bonus~ What show featuring those who protect your country (fiction or non-fiction) is your favorite? urlLink JAG . ~Bonus #2~ Out of curiosity, what's the longest you've ever watched TV in one stretch?! Mmmm. Maybe 12 hours? urlLink Everybody may or may not love Raymond 1. What's your favorite sitcom? urlLink Less Than Perfect . 2. Is there a sitcom you really don't like? There are quiet a few lousy ones out there, but the first to come to mind was urlLink Whoopi . 3. Which sitcom did you used to like, but now it just seems too hokey? urlLink The King of Queens . ~Bonus~ If your life was a sitcom, what would the title be? Something indicative of my lack of grace / clumsiness.

 urlLink The Queer Eye Glam-tastic Weekend

 I've been out reading blogs to see if there are any others I'd like to add to my blogroll. It's been an interesting adventure checking out some listed on the urlLink Recently Updated Blogs page. In looking for more guys to read, I've discovered lots of gay porn blogs. There are also a lot of illiterate teens out there.

 Follow my train of thought here, k? I was over at urlLink Kate's surprised to read that she watched Kerry speak. It made me remember reading something about Ted Kennedy losing 40 pounds this year. Something like "40 pounds for 04." I thought that maybe I could do "30 pounds before 40" ~ which is next year. Then I started thinking about turning 40. I'm actually looking forward to it. Weird, huh? I certainly don't feel nearly 40. And I don't feel like I act like I'm nearly 40. But then again, it's a little early to start obsessing about turning 40 when I'm not 39 yet, right? Age is a funny thing. Today I bought the new Ashlee Simpson CD urlLink Autobiography . I know, what am I? 12? But I love it. Makes me want to get in the car, crank up the stereo, drive fast and sing out loud. OK, maybe that makes me 16. Ah, to be 16 and know what I know now . . . [insert evil laugh here].

 Mmmmm. I love urlLink Ding Dongs .

 I've spent this afternoon finishing urlLink Bookends . I decided earlier in the week to give myself a reprieve and just enjoy having the TV in my room and not feel guilty about not reading. It's due on Monday and I remembered that I'd been enjoying it, so I took a couple of hours to finish it off. I thought it was a pretty great story about friends who become your family. And on the side it fed my fantasy of opening a book store / coffee house. Next up: urlLink A short history of nearly everything by urlLink Bill Bryson .

 I just spoke with Elizabeth on the phone. She sounds like a different person. I told her that she sounds loads better and she said, "It's pretend. Can I call you back?" Sure. Hmpfh. Pretend.

 About a month ago, my friend Elizabeth had surgery on both feet to straighten out her pinkie toes and stop them from curling under. Being the go-getter that she is, I think it surprised her how much her feet hurt post surgery and continued to hurt weeks later. E took two trips in the subsequent weeks, and when she returned home she left me a message on Friday that her foot was really hurting and she was going to the doctor that day. The doctor told her to soak them in Epsom salts several times a day. Her daughter called me on Wednesday to let me know her mom was in the hospital. Seems it was the first day she was coherent enough to ask someone to call me. She did the Epsom salt thing on Friday, but felt even worse Saturday. After talking with the doctor, they decided they would meet at the hospital. When they discovered she had a 105 degree temperature, they checked her in. After numerous tests, they determined she has a urlLink staph infection [staphylococcus] in her foot and a urlLink kidney infection . They put her on a full drip of bactrim [which is a heavy duty antibiotic] and morphine. As they pumped her up with antibiotics, a terrible urlLink migraine came on. It has been getting steadily worse -- yesterday they were hooking her up with a caffeine drip when I called. The nurse told me that she'd been vomiting a lot. I called today and spoke with her about 2 minutes. She sounds really, really awful. The migraine is still terrible and they are unable to stop the nausea. In the middle of the night they took her in for a urlLink MRI to check her for swelling on the brain, which could be urlLink encephalitis . Today they are testing her for urlLink West Nile Virus . She is really, really sick. I am very worried. And I feel very, very far away right now.

 None of the full-blooded siblings matched for a stem cell transplant.

 Zach Braff of urlLink Scrubs has a urlLink blog .

 I heard a new song on the radio on my way back to work and just had to find the lyrics. A few lines from urlLink 1985 : Springsteen, Madonna way before Nirvana there was U2 and Blondie and music still on MTV Shes seen all the classics she knows every line Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink even Saint Elmos Fire she rocked out to Wham not a big Limp Biscuit fan thought shed get a hand on a member of Duran Duran Wheres the mini-skirt made of snake skin and whos the other guy singing in Van Halen when did reality become T.V. she's still preoccupied with 19, 19, 1985

 This love affair that men have with the female breast makes me laugh sometimes. I work for a family-run business that includes four sons. As I was leaving work a few minutes ago, one of the sons was waiting out front for a ride. I stopped to chat. While standing there I caught the boob check. Now, this guy is totally innocuous, so I know it's an action of habit more than anything else. It did make me laugh on the way to my car. Silly men. I'd like to concur with wondering how men might feel if most women did a regular crotch check, but my guess is they might enjoy it! &nbsp; [for Kristy: the second son]

 When Sandy and I were talking about blogging earlier, we talked about comments and answering them. Some people are so good about answering every single comment. Me? Not so much. I read every comment, sometimes I comment on the comment, sometimes I e-mail the commenter. I should probably be more consistent. Then she asked if I read any boy blogs. I told her yes, urlLink Lee and urlLink Jim . Then I realized that was it. I dont really read boy blogs [there was urlLink Plain Layne , but she was a girl to me at the time]. I dont know why I dont. I hadnt ever really thought about it before. The two boys I read are smart, funny and quite sexy on occasion. They are boys Id like to know in real life. I always enjoyed Jeffs blog, but he quit. Maybe I should make a more concerted effort to read more boy blogs. Any suggestions?

 I was at mom's over the weekend helping her do a few things. She showed me a box of "my stuff" that I needed to take home. On top laid the photo holders from a couple of old wallets. They were&nbsp; funny to see. Me in a strapless dress with an ex-boyfriend. The boyfriend's kids. My nephew at 10. College graduation pictures. Wedding pictures. John. Gordy. Sandy. Carolyn. Mrs. Ryan. Big 80s hair. Shoulder pads. It made me laugh out loud. And then I came to a couple of photo booth pictures that made me stop. I just sat staring at them for a while. Remembering. Finally I said aloud, I still miss her . Without missing a beat, mom said, "I wonder if she is happy." I hope so. That's me and T. Can you believe those glasses?? Oy. I don't think they could've covered much more of my face. T and I became friends in college, working on the school newspaper together. I was the writer and she was the photographer. We were often assigned to work together do to "photo pages." A private skateboard park, a game of paintball (ow!). We had lots of fun and became fast friends. Ours was a relationship really hard to explain. We were almost so opposite that we fit perfectly together. We became roommates, traveling companions. I watched her date some interesting fellows and she listened to me moan about the same guy over and over. For years we were nearly inseparable. I truly believe there are people put on this planet that are our soul mates. I believe that even for as awful as our relationship ended, M&nbsp;and his children were some of my soul mates. I also believe T was too. Funny how neither of them are in my life any more. I have a very strong intuition. There are things I just know sometimes. It's been like this for years. For the last 18 months of our friendship I knew something was going on with her that I couldn't explain. I tried to get it out of her. I pointed it out to other friends. It was so frustrating for me. I tried to reason it off. She was not the greatest of students and was trying to get into some colleges out-of-state. Her parents weren't getting along. There were so many things and yet the obvious signs went over my head. She finally moved to Arlington to go to school. When I went to visit her, someone we both knew asked me to take her a gift. It kind of baffled me that it was a sealed gift bag with a rose sticking out of it. Her immediate response when she saw it was, "Did you open it?!" Of course I hadn't, but her reaction set off warning sirens for me. My detective skills kicked into motion and&nbsp;the moment I was alone in her room,&nbsp;I did. I was totally blown away by what I found. They were love letters from our friend, Isabel.&nbsp; [not her real name] I can't even begin to explain the shock I felt. I was really hurt. I was worried for her. She was already so not mainstream. And this. Oh, this. I don't know how, but I didn't let on what I'd figured out. I look back now and wonder if it wasn't a set-up.&nbsp;Isabel knew T well enough to know that she'd react to the rose. And she knew me well enough to know that I would play detective based on that reaction.&nbsp;A wanted me to find out. Later that week I told her I looked when I was alone. I told her why. Needless to say, it didn't go over well. I think if it had just been the two of us, we could've worked that point out and moved on. But it wasn't. A took the opening and ran with it. I violated their privacy and so on. Finally my friend was given an ultimatum. It was either me or Isabel . One of us had to go. I lost. I still miss her. I wonder how different our lives would be if we'd stayed friends. I wonder if she and Isabel&nbsp;are happy. They've been together at least 11 years by now. Probably more like 13 if you add in the time I felt something going on. [Yeah, I know. But that doesn't mean they are happy .] Things like this. Like finding those pictures, always happen for a reason. Example: for a period of time after our break-up I kept seeing my ex in the car. It became more and more frequent until I finally asked myself Why do I keep seeing him? And I realized it was to let me know that I was over him. I never saw him again. I found this picture of T on Sunday. She pulled up next to me on the freeway tonight. I got off at my exit and she kept going.

 This, my friends, is a true miracle baby. It's a long story that involves the short tortuous life of an older brother, a six-week early arrival and an extended&nbsp;hospital stay. Kathleen&nbsp;is the daughter of a co-worker. I felt privileged and honored to hold her today. A true living miracle.

 An interesting, albeit long, article on urlLink bloggers who turn postings into careers .

 Sometimes I think it is the best thing since sliced bread. Other moments it is worse than my old dial-up. Go figure.

 You know it's been a day when you come home, strip down, lay on the bed, turn on the TV and fall right to sleep. My supervisor was totally annoying to me today. From the minute she walked in the door until I left at 5 p.m. to her call just moments ago. Next week is my time of month. Maybe I'm just PSMing earlier than normal. I really was tired though. I remembered today it was a side effect the first time I tried Celexa. I figured since I hadn't had a problem with it since switching, I wasn't going to this time. I've already worked through the nausea, so hopefully this will cycle through pretty quickly too.

 An older lady gets pulled over for speeding... Older Woman: Is there a problem, Officer? Officer: Ma'am, you were speeding. Older Woman: Oh, I see. Officer: Can I see your license please? Older Woman: I'd give it to you but I don't have one. Officer: Don't have one? Older Woman: Lost it, 4 years ago for drunk driving. Officer: I see...Can I see your vehicle registration papers please. Older Woman: I can't do that. Officer: Why not? Older Woman: I stole this car. Officer: Stole it? Older Woman: Yes, and I killed and hacked up the owner. Officer: You what? Older Woman: His body parts are in plastic bags in the trunk if you want to see The Officer looks at the woman and slowly backs away to his car and calls for back up. Within minutes 5 police cars circle the car. A senior officer slowly approaches the car, clasping his half-drawn gun. Officer 2: Ma'am, could you step out of your vehicle please! The woman steps out of her vehicle. Older woman: Is there a problem sir? Officer 2: One of my officers told me that you have stolen this car and murdered the owner. Older Woman: Murdered the owner? Officer 2: Yes, could you please open the trunk of your car, please. The woman opens the trunk, revealing nothing but an empty trunk. Officer 2: Is this your car, ma'am? Older Woman: Yes, here are the registration papers. The officer is quite stunned. Officer 2: One of my officers claims that you do not have a driving license. The woman digs into her handbag and pulls out a clutch purse and hands it to the officer. The officer examines the license. He looks quite puzzled. Officer 2: Thank you ma'am, one of my officers told me you didn't have a license, that you stole this car, and that you murdered and hacked up the owner. Older Woman: Bet the liar told you I was speeding, too. Don't Mess With Old Ladies

 Course, that only really works when Joey Tribbiani says it. Kat wrote asking how I was doing. Which I interpreted to read, "How are you feeling ?" You know what?? I am feeling loads better. It is almost unbelievable the difference two weeks can make. It's hard to explain. I feel calmer. Less tense/on the edge. It is a wonderful feeling. To just feel more relaxed about life. Right now I am taking 40mgs Celexa (my psychiatrist had two months in samples, God love her) and 150mgs Wellbutrin XL. We're keeping the Wellbutrin in hopes of staving off the huge weight gain I had on Celexa last time. Frankly, I've come to a place in my life where I don't care if I end up fat, dumb&nbsp;and happy, as long as I end up happy.

 Yesterday when my urlLink flip-flips arrived and I gleefully showed them to my mom, she said, "Now who is this urlLink Kate ? Where does she live?" I'd told her about sending a pair off to Kate so she could fancy them up. Heck, she was there when I bought them (the orange ones were a bonus pair from Kate ~ cause we all know I love orange). Anyway, I guess it didn't really sink in. That I would send flip-flops to a stranger who would knit wild thread on them and send them back. That strangers do this for each other. Today at lunch I mentioned sending a urlLink book to urlLink Yvonne who is due any day now (hopefully). I told her about Yvonne's funny comment about sending urlLink Melly to steal my urlLink fab shoes . Again, she had the "Why are you sending a stranger a baby book?" face. Then I talked about my urlLink SBD group. Four of them are meeting each other in Chicago this weekend. I told her how cool I thought it would be and when I get to Houston I'd like to meet Sher ~ the member who lives closest to me. And I mentioned my reason for going to Houston would be to attend the urlLink Tiara Happy Hour to, again, meet complete strangers. I told her about one member of the SBD group talking about her son finally getting into that age where your clothes have to be certain brands, etc... Another member of the group with a son a year older offered to send her son's hand-me-downs. Really, how cool is that? After a while, she finally said, "It must be nice to have a community like that out there." Yeah. I talked about blogging earlier this week with my friend Sandy. She told me that she could never do it ~ especially comments because she would want to answer every single one. Plus it would just be a diary. Well, that's what I do. Chronicle my life. Someday it should make for an interesting read. When I told her about the flip-flops she said, "So you're like friends with the people whose blogs you read." Yeah .

 Mom bought me (what she considers to be) a belated Christmas present yesterday. I told her to make it an early birthday present instead.&nbsp; Yes, a TV for my bedroom. This could be very bad for my reading patterns. Yes, that's nosy Cory checking it out.

 Bravo urlLink Lance ! Thanks for letting me experience a little bit of history in the making this morning.

 Look, I am not a fan, but really people, let urlLink it go!!

 Check out this fab flip-flops! Aren't they the greatest???&nbsp;&nbsp; They were made by my friend urlLink Kate ! I love 'em!!!

 The "I told you so's" can begin at any time now. I am very excited that I can move to the couch to read the paper and I don't have to log-off!! What can I say? I lead a simple life, so it takes very little to excite me.

 I was just updating my "Reading" list and noticed this title on amazon: urlLink The Curse of the Singles Table : A True Story of 1001 Nights Without Sex . Now, that's I title I can relate to! I think I'll add it to my urlLink Library Book List .

 I am vacillating still from thinking this is really great to hmmm, not so much faster than dial-up. I do feel a sense of relief knowing that mom can get through to me if she needs to. I often worried that she might be calling for help and I don't know. Yeah, I'm a worrier.

 urlLink Fuck Corporate Groceries

 It's taken me most of the evening fiddling with my new DSL to get things the way I like 'em. Sometimes it seems faster than dial-up. Sometimes not.

 urlLink No Soprano's until 2006 ?? No Sex in the City, bizzaro Six Feet Under and now no Soprano's?? I might as well degrade my cable and save a few bucks!!

 Mom stops by to see the Godparents every Thursday. While she was there this afternoon, their youngest son stopped in. He'd just come from urlLink Grace Place ~ where he'd taken a tour and picked up literature. I am so proud of him!!

 urlLink Six Feet Under: 2001-2004

 Some days I think things are going better at work. And then my boss (not supervisor) will speak somewhere in the vicinity of me with a tone that I know is directed at me. "Yes, this is exactly what I wanted in the first place." It is so frustrating. I like what I do. I like the people I work with (even my super-chatty, nosey, CYA-ing supervisor). It's just her. I talked about it yesterday at lunch with someone I have worked a lot with over the years. Talked about how I am being treated. Things I am told. Like not being a team player. She looked at me incredulously. "Well, that's not true at all." She got pretty angry for me. About this woman messing with my livelihood because she can't be professional enough to put aside her personal dislike for me long enough to honestly look at my work.

 On Saturday at we get out of the car Linda says, "Did you know your inspection sticker expired two months ago?" Um, no? &nbsp; Yeah, so guess what I got on the way home? A ticket. Two months I am clueless and the minute I know, I get a ticket. *sigh* On Monday, Linda said, "Well, it seemed like a good day." Yes, I think it was a good day. No, we weren't talking about the urlLink fab shoes I bought. It was a good day for my Godmother. Sure, half the time she didn't make any sense at all, but the other half she did ok. You could tell she was having a great time being out and about. She was just so happy all day. She was with us from 9:30a to about 4p, so it was a good break for my Godfather too. As the officer walked from the car, Gina said, "Grrrr" with her clenched fist pretending to beat him. We laughed.

 Alias news from urlLink Watch with Kristen : The gang is now working for a covert leg of the CIA, so the show is going back to that undergroundy feel of the first two seasons. I say: Yay. And also: Woo-woo. Melissa George probably won't be back. Neither will Lena Olin. I say: Waaahhh. I want my Spy Mommy. David Anders is definitely not a series regular anymore. He does come back, but only for a few episodes, in which he gets some good play. Same goes for Greg Grunberg, who is moving forward with his bounty-hunter show, The Catch. He's back for a handful of episodes on Alias and also stars on Lost. (By the way, you're also going to see another familiar face on Alias as a series regular. Any guesses?) Whaa! No more Sark!? How can that be??

 Well urlLink Stacy grew on me tonight. Apparently on the daughters too. Frankly, NBC is sucking royally with their previews. Several times I have been able to figure out who is eliminated by the preview for the coming week. Tonight they showed both of the women walking towards urlLink Marty and his daughters . Then they showed the shoulder of the woman he proposes to. Uh, hello? Different dresses, different shoulder straps . . . I mean really, isn't that their job -- to keep me guessing???

 I have developed a Monday night routine as of late. Come home from work. Have a snack. Check in with my urlLink SBD group and other reads. Go to the library. Go to the grocery store. Come home to watch urlLink Who Wants to Marry My Dad .&nbsp; I like it!

 Dude. urlLink Six Feet Under was really hard to watch tonight.

 One year ago today I got my tattoo and bellybutton piercing while visiting Karla. In hindsight would I do it all again? Yes. &nbsp; For many months after, I felt remorse about the tattoo. Now, the only thing I would do differently is not have the black outline. I'd choose red or orange. Enough color to give the tattoo artist something to work with, but not so bold as black. &nbsp; Will I ever get another tattoo? No. Will I ever consider having the color touched up on my heart? Yes. &nbsp; The piercing. It was pretty crabby for a long time. I attribute that to being an overweight girl. I've seriously thought about taking it out on the one-year anniversary. Because I touch it a lot. A lot. When I'm standing talking to people. When I'm at work. When I'm at home. A lot. It must give me some sort of physical gratification, but I really shouldn't touch it when I'm standing around at the office talking to co-workers. &nbsp; Will I ever get another piercing? Probably not. If I did it would be in the nose. Just something small.&nbsp;But, you know, I work for a living. And I'm 38. The shoes below probably give you a better idea of who I would like to be,&nbsp;but I'm not. Will I take it out today? Probably not.

 I received a bill from my doctor's office yesterday. Essentially it adds up to $82. Of which my insurance will pay $11.98. I will end up paying $40. What's up with that?

 Note to self : If the movie makes you stand with your back against a wall so nothing can "get" you, you probably shouldn't be watching the movie.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Aren't they marvelous ??

 I finished urlLink Blessings last night. I took my time reading it, because I loved it. I loved the characters. I rooted for them.&nbsp;It made me laugh. And it made me cry. Two thumbs up for urlLink Anna Quindlen !!

 &nbsp; I don't think I mentioned that our youngest Ya-Ya was pregnant. I am certain I have not mentioned that the Ya-Ya's broke up. &nbsp; It wasn't an&nbsp;bad break-up with fights and ugly words. It was something that seemed to slip away until all of us let go.

 On Thursday my Godparents went to the local teaching hospital to see if my Godmother could participate in new Alzheimer's drug tests. They asked her to answer 14 simple questions . . . What day of the week is today? What month of the year is it? What is your address?&nbsp; She didn't answer one question correctly. They decline her participation because she is "too far along." &nbsp; Today mom, Linda and I are going to an arts fair about 45 minutes away. I wanted to invite my Godmother. &nbsp; I can tell that Gina enjoys just being in the car. I think she could really care less where we go or what we do. She knows that she is in the car. She is going someplace to do something. She is not stuck at home. &nbsp; Mom was quite hesitant about asking Gina along. I think part of it was because Linda is coming. I told her they (she and Gina) could sit in the backseat together. She truly said, "Gee, thanks." &nbsp; Like I've said in the past, she really seems to struggle with how to communicate with her friend. I just talk like always (who, me? talk?). She said that perhaps she'd pick her up another day and go garage saleing or something. &nbsp; I told her, Mom we may not have many more chances to do things like this . "I know." So we are picking her up on our way to meet Linda. And I'll let&nbsp;Gina sit in the front seat with me. &nbsp; I know, we may have several years yet of hauling her around. But I'm taking the tact that we need to get in as much time as we can now. Who knows what tomorrow may bring? For any of us.

 Now I understand why people blogroll themselves. Because when you go via your counter, you just see the blogroll list and can figure out where you are. But, some people don't call themselves "me" or another easy identifier, so I still can't figure out who it is . . .

 urlLink If You Read Only 10 Trashy Novels This Summer

 Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter. &nbsp; ~ Martin Luther King, Jr.

 I love this urlLink Obligatory Ring Entry . I love the gun as a ring analogy. Priceless.

 No, tell us how you really feel: urlLink Amazing Race Exes Get Evil

 The biggest Celexa side effect. The jitters. I just remembered now as I sit here at work with a shaking leg. You know, when you're nervous or have too much adrenalin and you catch yourself bouncing your leg up and down? Just now I caught myself thinking, I must've had too much sugar today , when I remembered this from before. It used to drive my mom nuts, because it makes me look nervous or impatient.

 I'm just putting this here for future reference. I don't really have any place else to save it . . . &nbsp; When all is breaking up, something new is breaking through. &nbsp; I just think it really applies to my life right now.

 Have you heard about the guys who drove their pickup truck into a lumberyard? &nbsp; One of them walked in the office and said, "We need some four-by-twos." &nbsp; "You mean two-by-fours, don't you?" the clerk said. &nbsp; "Let me go check," replied the man, and he went back to the truck. &nbsp; "Yeah, I meant two-by-fours," he said, returning a few moments later. &nbsp; "Alright. How long do you need them?" &nbsp; The customer paused for a minute to think and then finally said, "I'd better go check." &nbsp; After awhile he returned to the office and said, "A long time. We're building a house."

 urlLink Angie Dickinson was on urlLink Celebrity Poker tonight. It was funny watching the guys fawn all over her. I think if she'd asked urlLink Ron Livingston back to her room, he'd go in a heartbeat.

 There. That wasn't so bad. &nbsp; I think the most interesting thing about this interviewing process is figuring out which jobs I don't want. Today's position is one of those. &nbsp; There was an hour of testing when I arrived. I didn't finish. That shocked me. Spent too much time looking for clipart I think. &nbsp; Then the four-person panel interview. "And if we finish in enough time you can ask questions." Um, ok. I finished in time. They actually thanked me for my concise answers to their 12 questions. &nbsp; Then there were the three questions to be answered in front of a camera. Not hard at all and my hair looked great. &nbsp; However. This sound too much like an everyday putting out fires, living in crises mode, fending off the ugly media kind of job. Very high pressured. The tenure of previous staff is less than two years because of the pressure. Um, no thanks. &nbsp; There were 13 interviewed today. A handful will be asked to interview with the director next week. I haven't decided if I'll wait to see if I am asked back or if I should just send the "Please remove my name from the list" letter now. &nbsp; Hey. At least my hair looked good!

 Never ceases to amaze me. Love the new behind-the-scenes options.

 Breathing In. Breathing Out. Oh, what I wouldn't give for just a little taste of Xanax right now!! I am really nervous!! They shoulda just let the camera thing be a surprise!!

 I have a relatively small blogrolling list. So when I break up with someone, they notice. There's someone I want to break up with, but they've been around a long time and I don't want to hurt their feelings. Weird.

 I am *cough*cough* at home today. I figured I could use the time to prepare, get my portfolio ready, write out my questions, do laundry if necessary, etc... I am a little nervous about the hair. I think if I didn't have an interview today I would love it. However ...

 Well, at least it's not all red. Only highlights of red now. More brown and blonder highlights. I wish I wasn't so impatient. I want it to be back to normal right now ! The clan I had dinner with all said it looked "great." Guess I'll see what it really looks like on camera tomorrow!

 Tonight I am having my hair colored ~ hopefully close to its natural color. In the family at least . . . Then I am meeting Elizabeth for dinner. I suspect there is at least one beer on my agenda tonight!

 I ordered DSL on July 1. Just how long does it take to drop the doomahickey I need to get going in the mail??

 From Dear Abby's column today: A Dieter's Prayer The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want; He maketh me to lie down on vinyl-covered gym mats. He leadeth me to flavored calorie-free waters; He restoreth my goals. He diverteth me from the path of midnight snacking for my health's sake. Yea, though I walk through the alley of the Vendors of Pastry, I will fear no weevil; for thou art with me; My diet and exercises, they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me Spread with veggies and low-fat protein; Thou steameth my fish in foil, My resolve runneth over. Surely, if I follow this living plan all the days of my life, My hips will be slim forever. Amen. Pretty funny, no?

 The interview on Thursday includes an on-camera interview.

 I finished urlLink Can You Keep a Secret? last night. I really enjoyed it and would give it *** (out of four).

 urlLink Extreme Makeover Home Edition . I love it. And not just because of urlLink Ty . I so wish I could get a show like that to makeover my mom's house. There are so many small things that would just make life for her easier. A shower instead of just a tub. Oh, the list goes on and on. But all these families have compelling stories and I'm not sure if a "cause she's my mom and worked hard to give me the life I have today" would be enough.

 So, do you want written mini-reviews on what I read or the star system (which would really be astericks *)? Last night I started urlLink Can You Keep a Secret? . Blew through the first 138 pages. I've not really been a urlLink Sophie Kinsella fan in the past, but I am quiet enjoying this new novel of hers. And I see now that it's already being made into a movie with urlLink Kate Hudson .

 I noticed when came home earlier that I had a number I didn't recognize on caller id. I forgot about it for several hours until I noticed a message on my answering machine. It was a request for an interview for one of the jobs I've applied for (but not interviewed for yet). They want to set a meeting for July 15. Yay!!

 I've been pretty verbal about not being a fan of reality TV. But this summer I have been sucked into it. Monday nights it's urlLink Who Wants to Marry My Dad? I started watching this one last summer. I love the lie detector test! I want urlLink Suzanne to win. I started the urlLink Amazing Race on Tuesday. Again, another show from last summer. If there was ever a reality show I would like to do, it would be this one. I think Linda and I would make a great team. If all that running didn't give me a heart attack! My secret passion has become urlLink Celebrity Poker Showdown , Thursday nights on Bravo. Yummy urlLink Dave Navarro won the first round of the new game. Plus urlLink Queer Eye comes on right before, so I can catch the new episode. Makes for wonderful Thursday evening!

 Wow. People actually voicing their opinion on my blog. Maybe I should choose controversial topics more often.

 "yet to defend marriage, our nation has no other choice" When I first read this morning that President Bush "urged the House and Senate to ratify an amendment that defines marriage in the United States as a union of a man and woman as husband and wife" it bothered me. I thought, We don't need to be messing with the Constitution . And then I thought about all the afterthought amendments. Say like the right to vote (even though we had to do that several times to get it right), the end of slavery, etc ... all good things. I believe that marriage is a union of a man and woman as husband and wife. I don't believe marriage is an "evolving paradigm." I am all for civil unions. I believe gay and lesbian couples deserve legal protections for their families. However, I am also the wishy-washiest person I know. If my friend Elizabeth called tomorrow to tell me she was getting married to her girlfriend and asked me to the ceremony, I'd be there in a heartbeat. So I guess I'm saying I don't believe there should be a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. But I also don't believe in gay marriage. Mmmm. Just how hypocritical am I?

 You know it's going to be a day when you wake up 15 minutes before you're supposed to be at work. At work I received an e-mail from my brother with cancer. He needs a urlLink bone marrow transplant . Luckily there is a 1 in 4 match rate with full siblings. And he has four full siblings. I wrote him back and told him to let me know if no one matches -- that I'll get tested too. That seemed to make my mom really proud (he's not her son). But, you know, it's the right thing to do. And tonight we have a department party at my bosses house. Whee!

 Tuesday I picked up urlLink The Dominant Blonde at the library. It was the tagline that got me, The search for the perfect boyfriend and the perfect hair color . That's so me! Well, I'm working on the hair color part anyway.

 I got the funniest e-mail today from my massage therapist. The subject line reads "Good information and funny too." When I opened it up, it's a newsletter from eDiets. I just burst out laughing. On Monday she was subtly trying to tell me that my back wouldn't hurt so much if I exercised more . I know, I know. Now whereas some people might have been offended, I know she's just trying to show me she cares. It warms my heart. Plus, the newsletter had a jingle I haven't heard in forever . . . Coca-Cola came to town, Pepsi-Cola shot him down, Dr. Pepper fixed him up, Now he's drinking 7-Up!

 You know those lightbulb moments when you realize what a dumb ass you are for not thinking of something sooner? I had one of those yesterday. Why am I letting myself be miserable when I know there is a med out there that works perfectly for me. The epiphany was to pay for a prescription of Celexa ~ no matter the cost. This is where the stupid ass part comes in. I do some research. Right now, I pay &#36;100 every 90 days for two "formulary" prescriptions that have sucked the big one for me. If I have a "non-formulary" prescription it is only &#36;80 every 90 days. So basically I could be paying less and feeling better. What a revelation!! I just wanted to smack myself for not paying closer attention to this sooner. I'm guessing there's a reason I needed to go through this past year, but I'm not sure what the lesson was supposed to be. Tomorrow I have an appointment with my psychiatrist to pick-up the Celexa samples she has hoarded for me and to get a script. I feel better already.

 Have you ever purchased prescription drugs online via a Canadian pharmacy? [nevermind]

 As seen about town in blogworld [but hijacked at urlLink Natalie's ] . . . There are TWO rules to answering these questions: 1) Only ONE answer to each. Of course it's tough - that's the point! 2) Each blog/blogger may only be used ONCE. Which blogger inspired you to FINALLY start a blog? Jeff. I'm sad to say he no longer blogs. I miss him. Which blog do you visit the most often everyday? urlLink Katespot Which blogger do you think you have the most in common with? urlLink Glimpse of a Grrl Which blog can you be sure will make you pee a little you laugh so hard? urlLink The Mighty Jimbo Which blogger leaves you the best/funniest comments? urlLink Guruvious Which blogger do you wish would update more often? urlLink Lee Which blog do you wish more people would read? urlLink Not So Simple Which blog do you learn the most from? I learned that urlLink pretend bloggers are not very well liked out in blogworld. Which blog is your newest addition? urlLink Natalieville Who has been on your blogroll the longest? Since I've already said Kate once, I think it's urlLink Da Goddess . Whose blogroll would you LOVE find yourself on? I don't have a lot of regular readers, so I'm thrilled anytime I see myself on someone's blogroll. Whose blogroll were you the happiest to find yourself on? Ditto that last answer. If you could write like any blogger, who would it be? Well, maybe not like her blog, urlLink Snarkspot , but I'd love to write like urlLink Jennifer Weiner . What blogger are you the happiest you've "met?" Actually, it's a commenter. Kat. Which blog do you recommend the most? At some point in time, I have recommended every single blog I list. There's not "one" I recommend the most. Who is the next person you'll add to your blogroll? I'll let you know when I find them. Who is the blogger you hope to meet in "real" life? I would like to meet urlLink Christine and the rest of the Tiara Happy Hour girls. Which blogger do you admire the most? urlLink Moody Momma Who would you trust with your blog while you were away? urlLink Desktop Chronicle . I like how she thinks. Plus she's a Tiara girl! Which blog has your favorite design? urlLink Quirky Chick's Taste of India. How many blogs are on your blogroll(s)? 18 I did it! I gave one answer for each question and used a blog/blogger name only once! That was hard! [Just know that I love you all!]

 Well, I skipped to the end of urlLink Strange Bedpersons last night, so you know what that means. Tonight I'll try urlLink What the Lady Wants , also by Jennifer Crusie. Back to the library tomorrow. You can check out a CD for one week only.

 We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness . . . Happy Fourth of July!

 I finished urlLink Charms for Easy Life last night. I really enjoyed the sweet, charming read. It reminded me of urlLink Secret Life of Bees . Thanks for the recommendation Kat! Tonight, back to my regularly scheduled trash novel: urlLink Strange Bedpersons

 Spider-man, Spider-man Does whatever a spider can Spins a web, any size Catches thieves, just like flies Look out! Here comes the Spider-man! That young urlLink Mr. Maguire is a pretty cute kid.

 Apparently you can urlLink judge a blog by its cover ! [via urlLink big pink cookie ]

 I just got back from picking up a few things from the store. As I stood in line, I watched the couple ahead of me. A young couple with two children. I am certain the infant was less than a year and the woman looked about five months pregnant. I watched as she swept her card through for payment and then I noticed it was a food stamp card. Wow, I thought, how very cool. And then I remembered something tucked way back in my mental filing cabinets. I remembered being one of those people who would look down my nose at people thinking, Why don't you just get a job? Then reality smacked me in the face and I had an opportunity to use them. Long story short. 14 years ago I lived with a guy who had two kids. They spent weekends with us and weekdays with their mom (now she was someone who needed to get a job). Memorial Day weekend, she went up to a local river to do some tubing with friends. And she did a very stupid thing. She dove head first into murky water. Hit a rock. Broke her neck. Severed her spinal cord. And all hell broke loose. The two boys came to live with us full-time. It was a shock to our budget, so his ex-wife offered us her food stamps while she was in the hospital (and rehab). I'll never forget the first time we went to the store. We chose very carefully. No junk food. Necessities. Milk. Meat. Veggies. Cereal. We needed those thing to make it through. I remember feeling humiliated at the check out. Us rifling through the stamps. Feeling eyes on the back of my head. "Why don't you get a job?" faces staring at me. Now I know. I know I don't know their situation and it's not my place to make faces. You just never know.

 I have branched out into checking out CDs from the library. Right now I have urlLink So Called Chaos . I've decided I must buy it. I like Alanis. She had perfect timing with her urlLink Jagged Little Pill . She was angry and whoo-boy I was too . . . urlLink You Oughta Know Cause the love that you gave that we made wasn't able To make it enough for you to be open wide, no And every time you speak her name Does she know how you told me you'd hold me Until you died, till you died But you're still alive urlLink Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie . Well, um, yeah. urlLink Thank U wasn't too bad. urlLink Under Rug Swept . What's it been over a decade? It still smarts like it was four minutes ago We only influenced each other totally We only bruised each other even more so How long can a girl be shackled to you How long before my dignity is reclaimed How long can a girl stay haunted by you Soon I'll grow up and I won't even urlLink flinch at your name As I drove to work this morning urlLink This Grudge spoke to me. The lyrics are too long, you'll have to go read them. It made me think of my brother. Its been 14 years . . .

 Whoo, we got off a whole hour early today! I am glad to be home and ready for the weekend. I so need this.

 I've been meaning to share these: "The beautiful part of writing is that you don't have to get it right the first time, unlike, say, a brain surgeon." -- Robert Cormier, novelist "Keep learning. Learn more about the computer, crafts, gardening, whatever. Never let the brain idle. 'An idle mind is the devil's workshop.' And the devil's name is Alzheimer's." -- George Carlin, from his list "How to stay young"

 You are never going to guess what I did today. If you're a long-term reader, you might want to sit down for this one. I signed up for DSL. Shocking, I know. But, I switched phone carriers to a less expensive plan and added the DSL. My new bill will come to only a few dollars more than my old phone and internet bills. Whee! Now I can hardly wait for the parts to get here so I can get set-up and surfing speedy fast. Well, at least way faster than I am now.

 I swear Cory saves her smelliest poop for when I'm in the bathroom getting ready in the morning. p-u!!

 This morning in the elevator at work, I started laughing at something as the doors opened to let someone off. From somewhere outside I heard someone say, "I know that laugh! Is that [insert my full name here]?" Yes! It's me! I stuck my head over to see who said it, but the doors closed too fast. Yep, the laugh is that unique. [Later] Yes, I know it seems ridiculus that I don't use my full name here, being that it's pretty obvious. I just don't anyone searching for me to find me here via googling my full name.

 I don't think I've said this with such sincerity in a long time ... Thank God it's Friday!

 Thanks to Julia of urlLink Oh Dear! [cool blog design :-)] for leaving the tech tip of a lifetime for me! Worked perfectly! Many thanks.

 ok, I confess. I have been a reality TV junkie this summer: urlLink Who Wants to Marry My Dad? - I thought this version was much more scripted than last summer. I did think they had lovely women and a hunky dad. At first I rooted for Suzanne, but eventually Stacy won me over, just like she won the family over. I did not like, however, what they did to Suzanne in the finale. They were told that the "loser" wouldn't be coming back to the house, so when she did I know she thought she was about to get engaged. Then the daughters say all these lovely things about her until the big but. I felt so sorry for Suzanne having to have her heart broken on national TV. I believe her tears were genuine and that was pretty tacky of NBC. urlLink The Amazing Race - I love this show. I love the scavenger hunt aspect of it. I love the locales. And there are some really great teams still competing. It wouldn't hurt me to see the twins or the brothers [even though they are from Dallas] go, but I do like the other teams competing. I'm also rooting for urlLink Colin and Christie , the other Texans still in the game. urlLink Big Brother 5 - I am almost too embarrassed to admit it, but I am so loving this show. I was thrilled for Diane to win head of household last week and then nominate Scott and Jase. I was ecstatic to see Scott go and Natalie join the game tonight. And now Nakomis is HOH!! What can I say? I am in the need of some mindless entertainment these days. I've got to run because urlLink Celebrity Poker is on. Now, that would be a game show, right?

 Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, mom seemed pretty puny. She looked extremely tired and was unusually quiet. She did admit that she was still having dizziness if she turns her head the wrong way. But it doesnt last for more than a few seconds, unlike the hours on Monday. We went to the doctor yesterday and mom was given permission to drive again ["I believe you are someone who would drive responsibly."]. Dr. Boyd talked with her about starting on blood pressure medicine [which went over like a lead balloon]. Mom started to "argue" with the doctor that her blood pressure has been 130/70 for years. But the doctor started reeling off recent numbers and it has been slowly increasing lately. Peaking at 160 on Monday and still high yesterday. They came to a compromise that mom will have the school nurse [where she works] check her blood pressure every day for two weeks and then fax the numbers to the doctor. They'll discuss the next step after Dr. Boyd reviews the numbers. We had lunch and then I took her to get her car. She called late afternoon to see if I wanted some blueberries and she sounded like a different person. Lordy. I dont know what Ill do if/when she cant drive anymore. I have to admit that I was looking forward to a night home by myself last night, but she brought the blueberries over at 6:30 p.m. and stayed till nearly 10:30 p.m. making curtains. She was pretty chipper, so that was good. But tonight I am really looking forward to being alone! Elizabeth was released from the hospital on Monday. I spoke with her this morning. When I asked if she was feeling better she said, "yes and no." Seems the pyelonephritis [kidney infection] released lots of toxins into her body that are keeping her from feeling better right now. It will probably be several more weeks before she feels like her old self. Her neurologist is pretty certain that it was bacterial meningitis. While she was there her foot doctor took out the pins, so she was actually driving herself to see him as we spoke. She has also received permission from all her doctors to come here on Saturday. Oh, and have I mentioned that her cobra insurance expired on July 31? And from my oldest brother on the stem cell transplant blood test: "Right now there's nothing any of us can do for Ernie. He and Candi have decided to go the chemo regimen. He has the best doctors available without going to M.D. Anderson in Houston, and that doesn't mean his doctors here aren't just as good and the treatment just as effective. They have faith in their doctor and the hospital."

 Congratulations urlLink Yvonne !

 I need technical help. I have auto-fill set for my PC. My drop down list seems huge now when I start to fill in an e-mail addy. Can someone tell me how to delete the old/wrong e-mail address from that list?

 Mom has agreed to take a sick day today. Thanks heavens for that. I do worry about her being home all day in an un-air conditioned house. The heat index will be well over 100 today ~ I think I even heard 110. I have a raging headache. Mixed in with a little PMS. Ought to make for a lovely day.

 I'm not afraid of the hard conversations. Sometimes I stumble around them. Usually I just lay it out there. Today I talked with Elizabeth about the doctors thinking she was dying. That to me and her parents, she sounded like she was dying. That I worried about what would happen if she did. See, we have a pact, she and I. Where are your documents? What documents? You know, the documents that say what you want. Oh, those documents. They are in a blue can in my closet. That doesn't help me here when the time comes. I know. I know we talked about this before. I am a woman of my word, but I need proof. I know that. I will make copies for you very soon. The documents don't pertain to her will, but to where she wants to be buried. In Marble Falls. Next to her soul mate and best friend. Her current girlfriend doesn't know this. Doesn't know the plot has been bought and paid for. I promised her years ago that I would make certain she was buried next to urlLink Carole no matter what. And I intend to keep my word.

 So while I was wallowing in my self-pity, I decided to call mom and give her an Elizabeth update. She didn't answer the phone when I called, which is her job. Quick glance at the clock, Hmmm, it's not lunch time. That's odd. So I ask for her and I'm told she's just stepped away. Then Darlene figures out it's me and tells me that she'd [mom] had a dizzy spell and they'd taken her to the nurses office. She told me she was sure mom would be back soon and she'd have her call me. A few moments later mom called to let me know what was going on. We finally agreed that I would come get her and take her to the doctor. Naturally traffic was ridiculous, but it kept me from speeding wildly. I figured it was God's way of slowing me down. She was still laying down when I got there. We got her up, into a wheelchair and out to the car. I'd already called the doctor, so they were expecting us [a good thing about using the same doctor's office]. After what seemed like an interminable wait, Dr. Boyd came in and checked her out, finally announcing, "Well I don't think you've had a stroke." Um, that's good , I think from across the room. So basically it's an inner ear imbalance. Thank God. She's here now while we wait for her prescription. Thankfully we left her car at work, so she can't drive even if she thinks she can. And we have another appointment with the doctor Wednesday morning. If the meds aren't working [and she said we should call tomorrow if she doesn't have marked improvement], then she said she'd put her in the hospital to run the gamut of tests. I ask God for signs about what I am supposed to do in any given situation all the time. I have many, many blonde moments, so I ask for them to be neon signs so I don't miss them. Obviously this was a flashing neon sign saying, "This was not the job I wanted you to have, so focus on something else." Next time I'd like it if it were a little less flash to the sign.

 "For about five days they thought I was dying. I could see it in their faces." They still don't know what's [was] wrong with her. She's still having "crushing" pains in her sternum that can last 45 minutes to an hour. But when I called, Elizabeth was sitting in her chair waiting for the doctor to come visit so she can ask if she can go home.

 I called this morning about the job I really, really wanted. I didn't get it.

 My Godparents and one of their sons went up to Tyler for a few days to visit her niece. My Godfather called tonight to let mom know they were back. He recently talked to a facility for Alzheimer patients ($3700/mo ~ that ain't happening!) and asked them what they thought of Grace Place. "Excellent," they told him. Hallelujah! He's heard it now from someone besides us. Even better, he is going to call tomorrow! Thank God for answered prayers. GP has a special session on Thursday for caregivers that he wants to attend. Hopefully he can finally learn what is available to them. Claude also told mom that at one point during their travels Gina asked her son, "Who's your mother?" That cuts my heart. I can only image what it did to his.

 Tonight I skipped urlLink Six Feet Under in favor of urlLink Bend It Like Beckham . Good move on my part. Excellent movie about following your dreams. 3 stars!

 Well, ixnay urlLink A short history of nearly everything . I picked it up last night and decided it was much too serious for the mood I am in now. Ok, it is Bill Bryson, so maybe it's not that serious , but definitely not the fluff I'm looking for these days. Tomorrow: the library!

 So a few have asked if I will still have the test to see if I am a stem cell transplant match for Ernie. Absolutely. If they'll let me. I feel like I am being discouraged from being tested. Like if one of them wasn't a match as a whole sibling, there's no way I could as a half-sister. They are probably right. But there is only one way to find out and I am working to figure out what I need to do ~ with or without their permission.

 Elizabeth sounds so tired. Luckily she was "sober" enough today to bring me up to date on what's going on. She was excited that she got to take her first shower since Monday. The problem was her arms wouldn't go high enough to wash her hair. Why is that? She's had nine veins collapse from IVs. The migraine seems to have finally passed. She is still vomiting, but not as much. She remains on very potent pain meds and two very strong antibiotics. The West Nile test was inconclusive ~ probably because of the amount of antibiotics she's had this week. She's had some nuclear radiology which detected blood clots in her lungs. Her creatine level is too high, but probably is related to the kidney infection. The doctors can only tell her that she is "very, very sick" and they don't know why.

 "ABC News, citing anonymous sources, reported Saturday night that al-Qaida planned to send terrorists across the Mexican border into the United States, and that suicide attacks were being planned in the city, possibly using trucks. Attacks may be planned between now and Election Day. The Republican convention begins in New York on Aug. 30." A terrorist attack. On my birthday. Great. Cause it is all about me, right?
