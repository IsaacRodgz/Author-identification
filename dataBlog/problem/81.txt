 Maiden Lane and Nassau Street, NYC, 1929 - plucked willy nilly from the ridiculously huge urlLink New York Public Library Picture Collection Online (via urlLink Booknotes )

 The new algorithm (or rule change) adopted by Google has caused some distress, urlLink real or urlLink affected , in the blog community, casting many formerly prominent names into the further reaches of the rankings. Dive Into Mark (yes, him again) reviews the changes urlLink here . It doesn't seem to have done this blog any harm, though. This page turns up at #2 in a search for urlLink "enthusiasm" (after this HBO series, Curb Your Enthusiasm, which isn't shown in the UK, and I've heard no reports as to whether it's any good. No matter.) More exciting still, I've gone up from somewhere in the mid 30s last year to the top spot for urlLink "marc robinson" , seeing off even the Indian actor/model Marc Robinson - and he has actual fan sites dedicated to him... I'll try not to let it go to my head.

 The Nobel Prize in Literature will be announced tomorrow, according to the web site, which, as it turns out is very substantial.

 If geeky sites get any geekier than urlLink Intuitor Insultingly Stupid Movie Physics , trust me, I don't want to even hear about it. Try, if you will, to figure out who is the saddest person in the following quote, between the production people who made the series, the "apologists", and whoever wrote the actual sentence: Star Wars apologists say that the ship's computers detect the explosion and simulate the noise to inform the crew.

 urlLink Donnie Darko looks like my kind of movie. the official site is a tasty piece of flash work. Better than tasty, actually, its running in another window as I write, and it keeps getting better... This is from the urlLink Sight and Sound review : Kelly describes it as the soul of the movie, based on a completely inconsequential but similar moment in his own life that he never quite forgot, when he and a woman he never met waved to each other from passing cars. And so at his film's very end one character waves mournfully to another from across a street. The two people don't know each other at all at this point, and perhaps they never will because the character that connected them in another timeline has just died. The wave is a phantom of that other-time connection, one they feel numbly compelled to make.

 Thanks to Owen, Tammy, Cath & Gareth for a very pleasant blog-birthday celebration last night. And thanks to everyone for the messages (No takers in the non-blogging blog readers category, though, despite yesterday being another record breaker, traffic-wise. My curiosity is piqued even yet still further!)

 urlLink Los Angeles Times: Random Acts of Life and Literature Paul Auster gives out about writing in general, and a little something about the new novel, The Book of Illusions , out soon... (via urlLink All About George )

 urlLink Years and years ago, as a Fine Art student in Coventry, I attempted to give a seminar on The Glass Bead Game , and the relation between the studies of the game, as envisioned by Hesse, and contemporary art practice. There were probably a couple of dozen people in attendance, and not a single one of them had read the goddamn book, which left me in the unenviable position of struggling uphill, trying to explain the book, whilst the assembled company grumbled at details as I went along. Since then I've always felt pathetically grateful and indulgent towards almost anyone who's even heard of it. urlLink HipBone Games however, takes the work a whole lot further, devising playable versions of the game, and linking extensive resources on the game, what it has to teach about game design in general, and most strikingly, how it helps understand the nature of cyberspace. I foresee losing quite a lot of hours in here... (via Robot Wisdom)

 I don't remember how I found this yesterday, although it may have been related somehow to urlLink Ray Davies ' generous contribution of urlLink It's A Great Life If You Don't Weaken by Sam Lanin & his Orchestra to the Comics Journal Messageboard (for a limited time, hurry!). Anyway, urlLink Radio Dismuke streams popular music of the period 1925-1935 around the world, around the clock, and as such, it is an interweb treasure beyond easy comparison. Happy days are here again! (The picture is from urlLink The American Museum of Radio - one of many urlLink antique radio sites out there...)

 urlLink Death of an idea Julian Baggini steps up to bang another nail in the coffin of postmodernism. As these things go, it's a very similar argument to the ones advanced a year ago, and reviewed by urlLink Stanley Fish in the New York Times. I don't find it anymore convincing now than I did then. Surely postmodernism is being misrepresented when it is accused of actually denying the existence of "objective" reality? If I understand correctly, the existence of an objective reality is not really (heh!) in dispute - only the belief in the attainability of a single authoritative and exhaustive model of that reality. What's that Karl Popper word? Verisimilitude. That's the one. All of our understandings, or mappings of reality are culturally derived, and more fundamentally, contingent on the particular sensory and cognitive apparatus with which we are equipped. A good map is one that helps us get to where we want to go. A map that works. "Truth", or verisimilitude, only becomes an issue as and when the map fails. Wherupon the map may be revised - but the new map is more "true" only to the extent that it is more "useful"... (via urlLink Phil & Lit )

The object itself doesn't sound too interesting: a dirty snowball 800 miles across, another billion miles past Pluto. No local amenities to speak of, unless you're counting vowels ...

 Denis Dutton's urlLink Philosophy & Literature site, linked yesterday from the demise page of Arts & Letters Daily, is sitting atop the Blogdex chart right now.

Especially if you're a regular reader. Especially if you haven't left a comment here before. Especially if your blog isn't on my blogroll.

 urlLink The Tulse Luper Suitcases It looks as though we won't be able to move for Peter Greenaway's full-blown arthouse project (for which read, entire franchise) next year... This upcoming project will focus on the life of Tulse Luper, from his days as a child in Wales, to his adventures in his later life all over the world. The project will include three feature films, a TV series, CD-ROMs and DVDs. The CD-ROMs will enable the viewer to examine the contents of each of the 92 suitcases at their own leisure. The various contents of the suitcases include items such as 92 bars of Nazi gold, saucepans, cork frogs, musical instruments, 92 shoes, a map to Paradise, Vatican pornography, 92 vinyl-discs of military band music, Etruscan remains, burnt dog burns, food, 92 Atomic elements, a dog's coffin, and female underwear belonging to famous American film stars...

 urlLink I finally got to see urlLink Ghost Dog (Jim Jarmusch 1999) this afternoon. Woah. I don't watch too many ninja movies, but this I understand has established itself on the landscape, and it's not hard to see why. For a movie with so much violent death, it's remarkably peaceful and meditative. Forest Whitaker rocks the house with a laconic, thoughtful script. I do furrow my brows a little over the fetishistic caressing of powerful and lethal weapons, but the gore is pretty restrained - I was struck by the scene where Ghost Dog presents his best friend the Ice Cream Vendor with a suit he had been wearing for a full-on gun battle in the previous scene, and there isn't a wrinkle in the suit (which is kind of spelling it out, really).... A worthy if cartoonish attempt at a Zen fairy tale in film, and you don't get too many of those lately...

 Sarah came home today with a copy of urlLink The Complete Clangers Series 1 , among other fine things. Two hours of bliss, with a charming synchronicity thrown in. The case gave an address for an official urlLink Clangers site, which is kind of primitive, but I cannot fault the content of the site, which has a great deal more to it than the official urlLink Oliver Postgate site, which is terribly sparse. The Clangers site includes a bizarre story from the pre-production of the first series: Rather nervously I asked Ursula Eason of the BBC what they objected to in the scripts. She replied: "The bad language." I could only think of one piece of bad language. One of the episodes begins with Major Clanger trying to open the big sliding doors of the main cave mouth. It jams and his first line is: "Oh sod it! The bloody thing's stuck again!" "That's it." said Ursula. "You know quite well we can't say things like that on childrens' programmes." "But .. " I said, "they don't say it. They whistle it." "But surely people will know?" "If they have nice minds they will hear him say 'Oh dear me. The naughty thing is jammed again.'" "Oh, all right then, I suppose so, but please keep the language moderate."

 Dean Allen offers his urlLink Post of The Year , which concerns the habits of his dog, Oliver, after waking from his nap. It has not escaped my notice, by the way, that this is my third dog post in the space of about a week, and you might be forgiven for thinking that I'm craving for a canine companion, and who knows, maybe I am. As I said before, I've never lived with a dog, and I've no idea whether it would work or not. Perhaps what I crave is a lifestyle in which a dog and I could co-exist. That sounds more like it to me.

The other thing GS boasts is a collection of science stories going back to march, filleted of advertising and other irrelevancies...

 I wander thro' each charter'd street, Near where the charter'd Thames does flow, And mark in every face I meet Marks of weakness, marks of woe. In every cry of every Man In every Infant's cry of fear, In every voice, in every ban, The mind-forg'd manacles I hear. How the Chimney-sweeper's cry Every black'ning Church appalls; And the hapless Soldier's sigh Runs in blood down Palace walls. But most thro' midnight streets I hear How the youthful Harlot's curse Blasts the new born Infant's tear, And blights with plagues the Marriage hearse.

 urlLink International Dunhuang Project In 1900 a hidden cave was discovered at a Buddhist site near the ancient Silk Road town of Dunhuang. Sealed in about 1000 AD, it contained tens of thousands of manuscripts, paintings and printed documents on paper and silk dating from 400-1000 AD. The worlds earliest and largest paper archive, the caves contents included many unique documents, including the worlds earliest dated printed book (868 AD). The majority were in Chinese, but there was a large collection of Tibetan documents as well as items in Turkic Uighur and several other languages.

 urlLink USIA Electronic Journal 10/97 - Ashcroft There is a concern that the Internet could be used to commit crimes and that advanced encryption could disguise such activity. However, we do not provide the government with phone jacks outside our homes for unlimited wiretaps. Why, then, should we grant government the Orwellian capability to listen at will and in real time to our communications across the Web? The protections of the Fourth Amendment are clear. The right to protection from unlawful searches is an indivisible American value. Two hundred years of court decisions have stood in defense of this fundamental right. The state's interest in effective crime-fighting should never vitiate the citizens' Bill of Rights. Senator John Ashcroft, October 1997.

 The ranks of the reciprocal roll are recently swelled by Stanton Finley's urlLink Observations out of Taylorsville in Utah. What's there is promising, and his layout is rather lovely too, which helps. urlLink Philip Pearson was as good as his word - Enthusiasm is now on the map at urlLink Blogging Ecosystem . My stats according to BE are urlLink here . Currently, Enthusiasm lies just outside the top 500 for inbound links. BE counts 36 of them, which is two fewer than those in the 495-500 range. But we're just outside the top 100 for outbound links, which calls for a w00t! or similar exclamation. There are a couple of anomalies in here - BE detects outbound links to urlLink nik's miscellaneous ramblings , which I don't think I've ever linked to (until now, of course) and to urlLink holavaty.com , which I don't think I've ever seen before. One of these days I should look into why I'm not on the urlLink weblogs.com map of the blogging universe, too. I also got quite excited, seeing an unfamiliar name on the list of my inbound links - Nickel Bags of Thunk - although when I clicked it, it turned out to be urlLink IdleType . Nickel Bags of Thunk, aw'right . That is such a brilliant tag line, but I'm not seeing it anywhere on the page, nor is it to be found in the source. So where did it come from? Troy?

 urlLink I'm not 100% sure about this, but it may be that his being dead was the first I ever heard of Bill Hicks. Probably the first time I saw any of his work would have been about a year ago, out in Wales, when I mentioned that I'd never seen anything by him, and I was escorted rather smartly to the nearest VCR. What I saw filled me with the sort of admiration I hadn't felt about a standup comic since I discovered Lenny Bruce, and that was twenty five years ago. Anyway, I happened to find a little cache of MP3s of his work a few days ago, and I downloaded a bunch of them, and suddenly there he is on the cover of the Guardian's TV Guide on Saturday - a urlLink devotional piece by Andrew Mueller, and I gather there's a couple of new CDs coming out. I freely admit that I'm not qualified to be writing any tributes to Bill Hicks, and you probably were into him before I was. That wouldn't be hard. But if you're even more new to Bill than I am, I suggest you have a squint at the tribute linked up at the top, and the Guardian piece, and root around for more. Sorry to report that that little cache I found has disappeared again, and the official site has temporarily mislaid all of its urlLink audio files , but that's showbiz, eh?

 urlLink new books: Surrealist Subversions From its auspicious beginnings in the summer of 1966 to the present, the Chicago Surrealist Group -- and the Surrealist Movement in the United States, which grew out of it -- have continued to foment an exhilarating whirlwind of revolt while playfully igniting the sparks of Poetry, Freedom and Love in the crucible of the Unfettered Imagination. In so doing, it has brightly illuminated the pathways of absolute divergence that define the intrinsically anarchist trajectory of the surrealist adventure. Drawing on the full range of U.S. surrealist publications, from the original journal Arsenal/Surrealist Subversion to the very latest millennial communiques from the front lines of the ongoing battle against miserabilism, this volume contains over 200 texts (many appearing here for the first time) by more than fifty participants in the Surrealist Movement, making this the most comprehensive, diverse and lavishly illustrated compilation of American surrealist writings ever to be assembled.

 urlLink BBC NEWS | World | Middle East | Celebrating the Sabbath - in space Israel's Science Ministry has said it is investigating ways to allow Colonel Ilan Ramon, the country's first astronaut, to cast his ballot aboard the space shuttle Columbia, scheduled to lift off on 16 January 2003. Israel's first space traveller faces other difficulties: How does a Jew observe the Sabbath in space? More precisely, if he or she is in a low-lying orbit where the sun rises and sets every 90 minutes, what constitutes the Biblical "seventh day of rest?" Colonel Ramon is not particularly religious on the ground, but believes it is important to mark the Sabbath in space.

 urlLink I don't think I've found any edible wild mushrooms in London until today, but look - Shaggy Ink Cap, or Lawyer's Wig, Coprinus comatus (click for actual size) in perfect condition. I wish I could scan the smell of them for you. These mushrooms turn into an unappetising black goop rather quickly, and although they remain urlLink edible until they begin to blacken and liquefy, they are really good when the gills are still pale and the caps relatively unopened, like these. Even better, I found them only three minutes' walk away from here, and there's more coming! Now that's much better than a scan of my poor, injured, still throbbing finger would have been, don't you think? UPDATE: I cooked the mushrooms in butter with garlic and parsley. Like many wild mushrooms, they gave off a good quantity of liquid, so I let them simmer away for rather longer than I would usually cook mushrooms, so the liquor reduced. Then stirred in beaten eggs and black pepper to make an omelette of it all. The ink caps had a pleasant, delicate flavour, quite nutty, rather like almonds in fact, which nevertheless lingers almost an hour after I've eaten the dish. Of course I had no sooner eaten my wild mushroom omelette than I succumbed to Wild Mushroom Anxiety. I become briefly convinced that I have made a fatal error of identification, and that I am about to die a horrible and lingering toxic death. I get this every goddamn time I have wild fungus to eat - at least, every time I try a new species, or from a new source. Then I forget all about it until the next time...sigh.

 It's been a busy day. We've moved Sarah from Willesden, which is north west London, over to Forest Hill, which is fifteen minutes' walk down the road from here in the south east. It all went swimmingly, except that when we arrived at the new place, your humble narrator tried to open a sash window. I slipped the catch, and the top half of the window - controversially not equipped with the ropes and counterweights that make sash windows actually work - crashed down on the middle two fingers of my left hand like a guillotine. Fortunately it only caught the fingers on the nails - and if you ever whacked your fingernail with a hammer, you'll have some idea what that felt like. I wasn't what you would call conversational for quite a while. There followed a miraculously brief visit to the hospital - I think we were in and out of there within about half an hour, which these days is absolutely unheard of. The receptionist told Sarah while I was getting treatment that they'd dealt with all the saturday night injuries by that point, except for the ones who had yet to wake up and decide that they needed medical attention, so my little accident was perfectly timed to avoid the rush. My left hand ring finger is throbbing like something out of a Tom & Jerry cartoon, but here I am, actually typing with it, so I expect I'll be fine in a day or two...

I realise there are a million worse movies out there, but they're usually pretty easy to spot. This one should have been, at worst, mindlessly entertaining, something like Katherine Bigelow's urlLink Near Dark - but it was atrocious . It's far, far worse than you expect. I spent the whole 95 minutes trying to figure out a point of view from which it might have some merit, and came up with nothing. S. says I obviously don't fancy Keifer, and that explains it. Well, we both knew I didn't fancy Keifer before I suggested looking at the movie, but I didn't hear about this being the only reason to watch the thing back then...

 urlLink Roswell Incident Had Victims, Program Says While he told the world that a weather balloon went down in Roswell, an Army general had in his hand a memo telling Pentagon brass of a UFO crash with "victims," according to a new television documentary.

 urlLink Brewster Kahle interview The Wayback Machine man talks to New Scientist. The ground covered is pretty basic, but we shouldn't neglect the basics, should we? Websites are like shifting sands. The average life of a Web page is 100 days. After that either it's changed or it disappears. So our intellectual society is built on sand. You can't hold people accountable if, say, the promises posted on the Web by politicians are not available after the election. And key academic papers can become unavailable if a researcher leaves a university and their website is deleted. We've found that many websites of publicly funded projects disappear within a year. So as taxpayers we are investing in research projects, but we're not investing in a Web library that organises them and gives future generations access. Our Wayback Machine is the first attempt to do this.

 urlLink Guardian Unlimited Film | Interviews | Michael Moore This interview is dated 11th November. I'm not sure how I missed it until now, but I'm very glad I didn't miss it completely. I think they're very afraid of this film - they've been afraid of it since Cannes and they've been trying to figure out how to control it. Because it's not a gun control movie - this is a movie which says that something is more seriously and deeply wrong with the USA and our gun problem is a symptom of the larger illness that exists. Charlton Heston said in this interview with me, with no prompting from me, that the problem with America is "our mixed ethnicity". I'd asked a question about why Canadians don't have as many gun murders as we do and he said he was very proud that our country had been invented by those wise and dead white guys. And he kept making these kind of racial comments, but then he'd back off from them when I repeated the question to him. People were very afraid as to how that was going to come across. I don't know why anybody would feel sorry for a guy who leads the most powerful lobby group in the US and whose sole purpose is to make sure that people can have as many guns as they want to have and fire as many bullets as the guns can possibly fire. These people are insane and they have to be stopped.

Don Delillo's fictional biography of the putative perp / patsy, Lee Harvey Oswald, in urlLink Libra : Nicholas Branch in his glove-leather armchair is a retired senior analyst of the Central Intelligence Agency, hired on contract to write the secret history of the assassination of President Kennedy. Six point nine seconds of heat and light. Let's call a meeting to analyze the blur. Let's devote our lives to understanding this moment, separating the elements of each crowded second. We will build theories that gleam like jade idols, intriguing systems of assumption, four faced, graceful. We will follow the bullet trajectories backwards to the lives that occupy the shadows, actual men who moan in their dreams. Elm Street. A woman wonders why she is sitting on the grass, blooodspray all around. Tenth Street. A witness leaves her shoes on the hood of a bleeding policeman's car. A strangeness, Branch feels, that is almost holy. There is much here that is holy, an aberration in the heartland of the real. Let's regain our grip on things.

 urlLink Waiting for the fog to lift Steve Himmer tells of an anxious morning spent searching for his dog, Checkers, who got lost in the fog while out walking. I've never lived with a dog myself, and yet I find stories like this affecting in a way that I never have when they concern cats. I believe it's an altogether different relationship that humans have with cats, who seem to have their own individual agendas, and altogether more self-reliant. Dogs are more dependent on and devoted to the relationship; much more like children, in fact.

 urlLink Mark Pilgrim has come up with a cute web application called urlLink New Door , which will examine your blog page and compile a list of twenty recommendations for other pages you may or may not already be reading. It's based on data from Philip Pearson's blogging ecosystem, and you'd be much better off reading Mark's urlLink description of it than bothering with any cack-handed summary I might attempt. Here are the first-pass urlLink results for enthusiasm. It may prove unwieldy to make such an involved refinement, but: could version 2.0 automatically skip blogs that are already linked from the page being examined? Eight of my original twenty are already in my blogroll, and it took no less than 24 individual, manual exclusions to arrive at a list which contained no blogs to which I don't already link. I might add that unless and until I provide an RSS feed of this blog, enthusiasm will never show up in anyone's list of recommendations, which I think is a bit rough; I see the value of RSS in general terms, but enthusiasm is a weblog, not a stockticker, nor a news feed. I don't think that someone readiing enthusiasm through a news aggregator would really be "getting it" - as I suggested in the case of urlLink ikastikos , a urlLink couple of days ago . I must say that the list of twenty blogs I ended up with - which has the longest URL I have ever seen, and I've seen more than a few - only two or three are actually new to me, but one of them - urlLink greg.org - is so far up my street that it goes straight into the roll, and makes the whole exercise worthwhile, and I've been nudged into adding urlLink Kevin Marks as well, which I kind of suspected I ought to do all along. I might as well take the opportunity to raise issues I have with the urlLink blogging ecosystem itself. I realise I'm probably still off the radar, as far as the top 500 goes, but enthusiasm is mutually permalinked to at least ten of the current 500, but when I look at the stats for each of these sites, this blog is not listed either as linking to or from them - whereas if I look at the cached copy of each of these pages, there I am, large as life. What's going on? I'll drop the archive URL to this post into PP's mail basket when it's posted, and report back any response I get. I'm not paranoid enough to think that enthusiasm is the only blog which is disappearing from the ecosystem's map in this way.

 I don't know what my subconscious has against urlLink Lee Carsley , I really don't. I don't blog very often about football, and I may never even have mentioned it here before, but my team is urlLink Everton FC , as it has been since I was about seven or eight years old. For most of that time, being an Everton supporter has been nothing much to shout about, but lately we've been doing rather well; for the first time in living memory we have an honest to goodness wild-eyed zealot for a manager, in David Moyes; Everton managers have traditionally been of the suit and tie persuasion. We have the latest Official Football Messiah in 17-year old urlLink Wayne Rooney , about whom the pundits are talking the way they talked about Michael Owen a few years ago, and David Beckham a couple of years before that. We're fourth in the Premiership right now, we've won our last five Premiership matches, and we're three points ahead of Manchester freaking United. It's all rather disconcerting. We'll be competing in Europe next season if we're not careful. So why did I wake from a turbulent, repetitious dream last night in which midfielder and Irish international Lee Carsley scored a hat trick of own goals and was promptly sold, like the same day, to Dunfermline Athletic?

 urlLink GetContentSize is a brutally simple utility that will calculate the percentage of actual text on a given page, relative to its file size. In other words, it will give you a very rough idea of how lean your page is, codewise. This page gave 49.69%, until I added this post. The longer this post gets, I suppose, the higher the percentage will creep. So, em, what shall we talk about...? (via urlLink Gimboland , a newly discovered Cardiff blog with the unique distinction of being permalinked by urlLink Robot Wisdom - which makes its proprietor, Andrew Gimblett, a bit like Ian Hislop to Jorn's Richard Ingrams. Perhaps.)

 A dangerous and entirely unscientific application of archaeological principles to inspect evidence of previous human habitations and demises, preferably involving an amateurish and histrionic analysis of human relics, case and site assessments based on children?s diagrams of parlor games, and palindromic investigations of imaginary crime scenes. Equipped with expert witnessing skills and third-grade chemistry sets, we are always ready to take the stand.

 urlLink Wired 10.12: God Is the Machine In which Kevin Kelly advances the proposition that our universe is made up entirely of information, which is to say, digital, and then deals, after a fashion, with the follow up - if the universe is information, what is that information stored in or on, and if the universe is the programme, what and/or where is the machine that is running it? It's a nice little mind-bender of an article, but surely we've been through enough paradigm shifts by now to realise that the universe-as-information analogy is almost certainly no more fixed and absolute than the old universe-as-clockwork-mechanism analogy was in Newton's time? The crucial paragraphs appear to be these: Any large computer these days can emulate a computer of some other design. You have Dell computers running Amigas. The Amigas, could, if anyone wanted them to, run Commodores. There is no end to how many nested worlds can be built. So imagine what a universal computer might do. If you had a universally equivalent engine, you could pop it in anywhere, including inside the inside of something else. And if you had a universe-sized computer, it could run all kinds of recursive worlds; it could, for instance, simulate an entire galaxy.

 "A bit negative is a terrible thing to waste" Two instances of the urlLink ALICE chatbot set up to talk to each other. Predictably, the conversation runs into the ground pretty quickly, but the early stages, in which they argue about which should download a copy of the other, is diverting, if you want a particularly vivid illlustratiion of the expression, "the lights are on but there's nobody home". Anyone who's ever been 'entertained' by a certain kind of PR executive will find this stuff disturbingly familiar. (via urlLink fmh ) Meanwhile, urlLink As Above points to an urlLink interaction between ALICE and Barry DeFacto (another successful chatbot) that took place in 1998, in which the conversation turned to... Star Trek.

 As you may have gathered from my recent ramblings on Ophiuchus, I've been of a mind to read portents and omens lately, but urlLink this one stirred no more than a vague recollection, until just now I found this from urlLink AKMA : Bear with me. I know they were going to name it something, and it couldve ended up with just any initials, but IAO was the name of the Gnostic deity roughly based on the God of Israel. Gnosticism (roughly sketched, since there was and is no single essence of Gnosticism) identifies human salvation with knowledge (Greek gnosis). Of all the names of all the divinities in all the world, the name that winds up attached to the secret police agency that the highly-literate John Poindexter just happens to chair belongs to a deity who signifies the confluence of knowledge and power. Canadian friends: can we get a discount for a mass emigration?

 urlLink Lilly Heir Makes $100 Million Bequest to Poetry Magazine An ailing heir who tried but failed to have her poems published in a small literary journal has given that journal an astonishing bequest that is likely to be worth more than $100 million. Ruth Lilly, 87, an heir to the Eli Lilly pharmaceutical fortune, submitted several poems to Poetry magazine in the 1970's and was rewarded only with handwritten rejection notes from the editor, Joseph Parisi. Evidently she did not take the rejections to heart.

 It looks like I'm staying up late to no avail; there's low cloud and ground mist, there's little wind, and I can't even see the full moon, nor the nearby TV mast at Crystal Palace, let alone the urlLink biggest meteor shower for decades . Bummer. I'll give it another hour, maybe it'll clear...

 urlLink Stalking the Rational Mind Consciousness is different. Crick acknowledges that consciousness is bound to be a far more complex quarry than DNA. "There are lots of bits of business to explain," he says cheerfully, relishing the sheer intricacy of the quest. "Aesthetic responses to things, long-term plans and so on. The double helix was simple because it goes back to the very beginning of life, when things had to be simple. But consciousness is the product of millions of years of evolution."

 urlLink What happened was this: a week ago, I checked out a perfectly innocent astronomy picture, showing a rather sweet urlLink nebula (hi res version urlLink here ) in the constellation of Ophiuchus, and thought no more about it. Then a few hours later, while reading The Subtle Knife , a minor character points towards the constellation, indicating a flight of angels hurtling across the sky, and the witch Ruta Skadi takes off in pursuit. Oh-oh: dig in the ribs time again. Agenbite of inwit. Mindful of urlLink Alan Moore's remarks concerning weird stuff, I also took off in pursuit, and what I've dug up spreads out in many interesting directions, although some of the online sources I've visited verge on the bonkers, so, caveat lector , innit. Ophiuchus (pronounced OFF-ee-OO-kuss), as it turns out, is quite a large urlLink constellation on the ecliptic, between Scorpio and Sagittarius. The name means "snake handler" and the two parts of the constellation urlLink Serpens are arranged about him. It happens also to lie in the direction of the urlLink galactic centre . Ophiuchus is the only constellation on the ecliptic which is not also a sign of the astrological zodiac - because the plane of the ecliptic has shifted since the establishment of the astrological zodiac. Some people consider that this somehow invalidates astrology, although I would contend that this indicates a pretty fundamental misunderstanding of astrology. Still, we can get onto that in a later episode, perhaps... urlLink This page is about the most comprehensive summary of both astrological and mythological data, and also the source for the illustration I've used at the top there. An older image from the Ophiuchus constellation at urlLink APOD shows massive swirls of cloud known as the urlLink Snake Nebula - presumably because of their location, rather than through any particular resemblance to a snake. The mythical Ophiuchus is identified by most sources as urlLink Asclepius , Master Architect, Healer, and God of Wisdom - but mostly healing: he has five daughters, at least two of whom, urlLink Hygieia and Panacea, lend their names to medical concepts, and two sons, who don't. O-okay. The urlLink life story of Asclepius is complicated (isn't it always with these Olympians?). Asclepius is the child of Apollo by Coronis. Apollo has Coronis killed for supposed infidelity with the mortal Ischys, but is filled with remorse and he gets Hermes to tear the unborn Asclepius from his dead mother's womb on the funeral pyre. The child is given into the charge of the Yoda--like Chiron, the Centaur, whose wisdom is said to be greater than that of all the other Olympian deities put together. Chiron teaches him healing, and his skill becomes so great that he is reputedly able to revive the dead. He is enlisted as ships surgeon for the voyage of the Argo. He restores Glaucon, the son of King Minos of Crete, to life following a chariot accident, and a number of others, which eventually causes some consternation in Hades, where the ruler of the underworld complains that if humans are able to cheat death, his dominion - I almost said livelihood - is threatened. He prevails on Zeus to break out the thunderbolts, and Asclepius is killed while attemting to revive Orion, who has been killled while hunting. However in recognition of the benefit he has brought to humankind, the healer is placed in the sky as Ophiuchus, along with his snake. But there's more. Oh boy, is there more...

 Just noticed from my referrals that enthusiasm is linked from urlLink ikastikos , which I would never have known from looking at th page, because all the outgoing links are graphical. The link for enthusiasm looks like this. Ikastikos is a very distinctive blog - the red on pink comic sans text isn't really to my taste, but the links are interesting and plentiful - there's a particularly good selection on Pillow Books recently added - and it seems to me that reading a blog like this as an RSS feed, not that I've even checked whether such a thing is available - would miss out on much of the site's personality...

 urlLink disinformation has pulled together a very respectable collection of urlLink Robert Anton Wilson links, with a little light commentary by Richard Metzger.

 urlLink BBC NEWS | Entertainment | TV and Radio | Lost Doctor Who show revived The Doctor Who episode originally written in 1979 by Douglas Adams and whose production was halted by industrial action, has been remade for webcast by BBCi in the spring. Paul McGann will play the Doctor again. Hooray, perhaps. I'm old enough to remember William Hartnell, the first actor in the role, and to not remember any of them after Tom Baker left the series, which according to urlLink this page was in 1980. My, how time flies, and makes those curious radiophonic wheezing noises as it does so. Come to think of it, I also remember the Doctor that isn't included on this list. It would be almost tempting to make an audience participation thing out of it - except that there's no such thing as obscure trivia when you're sitting in front of a screen with an net connection, as you presumably are. Alright, alright, it was Peter Cushing, in urlLink Dr Who and The Daleks (1965) - which is the only time that Doctor was shortened to Dr., trivia fans! - and urlLink Daleks' Invasion Earth: 2150 A.D. (1966). I once had the book of the film of one or other of those, but I'm not sure which.

 I really cannot explain, even to myself, why I have failed to mention the most enjoyable conversation I had with adam reed of urlLink anthroblog , on monday afternoon. urlLink Cath Snow has just mailed me and mentioned that he'd mentioned it, and so I went and had a look, and so its only now that I remember my comments about blogging being analogous to punk rock - blog software allowing people to build sites without having to acquire too much in the way of technical skills first, thus dissolving the boundaries between performer and audience... I can't be the first person to have made this analogy, surely? I don't recall having seen it written anywhere before though... UPDATE: No, of course I wasn't the first person to make the blogging / punk analogy. Here's a dude called Dr Frank, writing in urlLink The Blogs of War - which I've never seen before - last December: In many ways the weblog phenomenon is a lot like the often unrealized ideal of punk rock, which is that everyone has a band, and all the members of all the bands are in the audience when they don't happen to be on the stage. There is an absolute equality of opportunity, yet it's also a true meritocracy since the ones with the most appealing or interesting content get the most attention; and there's very little subversion of this meritocracy, very little incentive for people to pander to the lowest common denominator to increase "market share", since the financial angle, if it's there at all, is minimal at best. At least, that's the ideal."

 The second and third Green Goddesses I've seen on London's streets just wheezed past my window.

 As you may have gathered already, there's been another little reorganization of the blogrolls. Sites that permanently link to enthusiasm at the top, then everyone else. I'm coming around to the opinion that mutual linkage is probably the most important aspect of the blog world, when considered as a whole (whereas any number of qualities might distinguish a blog considered as an individual concern), and this revision is reflects that. Please nudge me if I've got your blog in the wrong category, or if you're linking me and I've not yet noticed...

 Breathlessly, I finished the second of the Philip Pulllman books, The Subtle Knife just before seven o'clock this morning. Everything I said about urlLink the first one applies to this, only more so. These books are almost unbearably good. Fortunately, I have the third one close at hand, so I'll be surging straight into that one later today... I should also mention that Amazon searches for "Subtle Knife" give results in Kitchen Supplies on both sides of the Atlantic. Now wouldn't that be something?

 urlLink BBC NEWS | Scotland | 25-year murder conviction quashed How exactly do you compensate someone for the loss of all of his 20s and 30s and half of his 40s? The guy is a year older than me. He's been in jail since the Sex Pistols were in the charts. Expect some hullabaloo over compensation, though. What's possibly even more sickening is that the guy was refused parole for the last ten years because he refused to give up trying to clear his name. And the Manchester police have said they "did not rule out" the possibility of reopening the case. Strangely (or predictably, perhaps) there is no suggestion in this article that the police officers who coerced Robert Brown into signing a false confession will be brought to justice. That would be a start, wouldn't it?

 urlLink Science and the Artist's Book I don't remember who pointed this one out a week or so ago and I don't have time right now to go trawling (apologies to whoever it was) but this online exhibition shows copies of landmark science texts along with (mostly) contemporary artist's works concerned with presentation of scientific knowledge or conjecture. There's a larger jpg image of the ML Van Nice book, which really needs to be seen more closely, urlLink here . BTW - the Ophiucus piece is getting out of hand altogether. I won't be around to work on it this afternoon and possible also this evening, but I'll get there in the end...

 Could have sworn I posted something to this effect earlier on, but it seems to have disappeared. I've spent hours today chasing after a synchronicity: two references to the constellation of Ophiuchus in very different contexts, in the space of a few hours. I don't think I'd ever registered the name before, and there it is, twice. What started out as a blog post is now looking more like an essay. If I can lick it into some sort of shape this evening, you'll be hearing from me. Otherwise, tomorrow?

 Prompted by a google referral from someone looking for urlLink Kenneth Williams sound files (for which enthusiasm is in the top twenty results, according to google.de), I went rummaging for some, but I found nothing to compare with my venerable vinyl copy of The Best of Rambling Sid Rumpo, and so I found myself browsing Peter Cook fan sites instead. urlLink The Establishment - lots of interview transcripts urlLink petercook.net is another one, heavy on the flash, but a few bits of code leaking out onto the page here and there, which isn't too cool. The official Peter Cook site is weirder still - most sections are directed to the poshest 'under construction' sign I expect to see this year; a rather lovely raindrops in puddles kind of thing, and the secions that are there are pretty unimpressive. Such is the way with official sites, I suppose.

 urlLink These chimps are fishing for ants... but does this ritual make them cultured? A large and growing body of research shows that chimpanzees have quite a rich and varied culture, which carries implications, so they say, for conservation policy. It's another step in a slow awakening; it isn't all that long ago that Learned Societies considered culture to be the sole preserve of, ahem, People Like Us (meaning property owning white christian folk). Gradually the realisation dawned that other people had cultural agendas too, and "we" might have to take these into account. Of course there are still people who disagree with this; I had the dubious pleasure of seeing a urlLink documentary about one, only a week ago, during the course of which the University of Leeds awarded a degree to the stupid fucker. Go figure. And again, having a culture isn't going to stop George Bush dropping bombs on you and stealing your oil, either. Sorry, Iraqis. I have to conclude that merely prodding a few somnolent academics into a grudging recognition that you have a culture isn't necessarily going to save you from extinction. Sorry about that, chimps...

 Telemarketing militarism to school kids? This boggles my mind. Amidst all the other fascistic measures introduced by the urlLink WMPC a year ago, this one never came to my attention. Sharon Shea-Keneally, principal of Mount Anthony Union High School in Bennington, Vermont, was shocked when she received a letter in May from military recruiters demanding a list of all her students, including names, addresses, and phone numbers. The school invites recruiters to participate in career days and job fairs, but like most school districts, it keeps student information strictly confidential. "We don't give out a list of names of our kids to anybody," says Shea-Keneally, "not to colleges, churches, employers -- nobody."

 urlLink Anil Dash has words of advice for people thinking of watching the New York marathon, although they are probably just as true for marathons run elsewhere. Amongst these words: Position yourself near the volunteers who staff the first-aid stations. Because they are Marathon Enthusiasts, they have boundless energy and endless interest in each runner who passes. We spent three hours listening to one small woman shout "You're the best! You're a champion! You're doing great! We're so proud of you!" in an endless loop, at the top of her lungs, to each participant, no matter how pathetically demoralized and demolished they appeared or how poorly they were performing. After the race, make sure to seek the Enthusiast out, so she can specifically say, "I didn't mean you. You're a lazy slob."

"From the one particle, as a center," he wrote, "let us suppose to be irradiated spherically in all directions to immeasurable but still to definite distances in the previously vacant space a certain inexpressibly great yet limited number of unimaginably yet not infinitely minute atoms."

 urlLink Brain and Heart gelatin moulds I have a nagging suspicion that I once coveted a brain jelly mould, but I wouldn't be prepared to give these people money: Illustrate "Be careful little eyes what you see" with the brain. Everything you ever see will be stored in your brain...; it can never be removed. (Mold gummy worms or cards with items on them into the gelatin), ask your students to tell you what little Johnny or Susie has been watching on TV when no one's around.

 urlLink Unpublished artwork by Billl Sienkiewitz from Alan Moore's urlLink Big Numbers , at something called Lowbrowartwork.com. The site doesn't seem to be open yet though. The urlLink front page is linkless. (via urlLink lmg ) The link back to Alan Moore's description of the themes for the unfinished series goes dead, but it's worth reproducing again, with apologies to Darren: '...with the world political situation as it is at the moment the political radical is put in a difficult position because, hum, how do you rebel against chaos? You know, much as political conspiracy theorists would like to think otherwise, the brutal truth of the thing is nobody's in control, this is a runaway train. Nobody's in control, there's not some big conspiracy in control, whether it's Jewish bankers or nazis or CIA spooks, the simple truth is that the world is a complex storm of mathematics, basically... Very complicated mathematics that is beyond human comprehension.' -- Alan Moore

 urlLink Plan Plant Planet Our present global crisis is more profound than any previous historical crises; hence our solutions must be equally drastic. I propose that we should adopt the plant as the organizational model for life in the twenty-first century, just as the computer seems to be the dominant mental/social model of the late twentieth century, and the steam engine was the guiding image of the nineteenth century.

 Strange, animalistic squeaking noises on Saturday afternoon roused me from my desk - or wherever it was I had been slouching - to investigate. Sounded like they were coming from the kitchen. Wa-ay too loud to be a mouse though. From the kitchen, they sounded like they were coming from outside, so I peer down into the space behind the flats. A neighbour is changing a tyre on his car, with his toddler son helping. They have an air pump. The squeaking had evidently been Compressed Air Humour which, when you think about it, may be the best kind. True, I had been watching the South Park movie for the first time that morning, which had probably skewed my values a little. I had been very impressed by urlLink South Park: Bigger Longer and Uncut . Seriously. (I realise a whole swathe of you are rolling your eyes now and are no doubt toadally like, duh... but bear with me - mkay?) A film which apparently sets out to argue the Healing Righteousness of the Fart Joke and to scorn, furthermore the moral cowardice of individuals who crusade against 'potty mouth', it categorically refutes the idea that 'infantile' and 'obscene' humour cannot have serious intent. I don't remember the last time I used the word 'obscene' (outside of discussing economics, of course), and it feels weird even writing the word 'obscene', like I'm using parentheses like rubber gloves or something). Word is, very simply: we have more fundamental things to worry about than kids amusing themselves with 'strong' language. Things which are being actively ignored in place of policing our vocabulary . Real things. South Park points the finger and hoots, "Displacement Activity!" As Kyle has it: Dude, what kind of sick joke is that? I laughed so much that it did actually hurt...

 urlLink Unsolved cryptographic mystery alert! The Voynich Manuscript is an illustrated book of about 200 pages, written in what is apparently an alphabetical script, but which has resisted all attempts to decipher it. It was bought from a Jesuit College at the Villa Mondragone in Frascati, Italy, in 1912, and it is now held in the Beinecke Rare Book Library at Yale. When discovered, Voynich found a letter inside the book, written by Johannes Marcus Marci of Cronland, and addressed to urlLink Athanius Kircher . The letter claims that the book had been bought by Holy Roman Emperor Rudolph II, and suggests urlLink Roger Bacon as possibly the author. All of this makes the manuscript extremely interesting. There's a bunch of links to further reading at the bottom of the page - it seems the manuscript has been the subject of a dedicated urlLink mailing list discussion for several years, for example, and there are scanned images of every page of the book urlLink here on what I assume is a medieval Japanese web page (dating from before the evolution of thumbnails, anyway). Mark Frauenfelder suggests that cracking the cipher may be suitable task for distributed computing. I'd pitch in a few spare cycles for that, I think... (via urlLink Boing Boing )

 urlLink Long, detailed account of the recovery and conservation of the Swedish ship Vasa , which sank within one nautical mile of launch on its maiden voyage in 1628. The wreck was originally found in 1956. It seems that the ship capsized under identical circumstances which sank the urlLink Mary Rose in 1545: they'd left the gun ports open after firing a farewell salute, and a random squall filled the lower deck with water, and she was sunk within a few minutes. I have to confess that I'm not especially determined to absorb the details of all the chemicals used to preserve the wreck, but there are some great pictures in here, not least of which is the diver with blackened skull shown...

 urlLink I'm listening to a stream of BBC Radio 4's urlLink Quote Unquote game show, in which urlLink Donna McPhail just told a urlLink Groucho Marx story I hadn't heard before. Groucho was approached, it is related, by a clergyman who wished to thank him "for all the enjoyment you have given to the world". Groucho in turn thanked the clergyman "for all the enjoyment you have taken out of it"... Wandering, as you do, into a page of Groucho quotes... here is one that deserves to be a strapline on a blog, if not an entire blog directory: "Now there's a man with an open mind - you can feel the breeze from here!"

 Theresa Nielsen Hayden of Making Light blog has clearly been doing a lot of thinking about con tricks, frauds and scams lately. She's posted an urlLink overview of the topic yesterday, in which she observes: These scams take the forms they do because they're parodies--no, a better way to put it: they're cargo-cult effigies--of the deals the ruling class cut for themselves. If you're an insider, if you have the secret, you can have a job where you make heaps of money for very little work. You can avoid paying your taxes. You can inherit a pile of money because an ancestor of yours left a moderate fortune that's been appreciating ever since. You can be your own boss. You can have other people working for you, who have other people working for them, who all pay you a percentage of the take. Of course people believe it. After all, they vaguely know this sort of thing happens. It just doesn't happen to them. But why shouldn't they be the lucky ones, this time around?

 Well, 2003 has reached Eastern Europe at the time of this posting, and it's heading this way. We're off to the pub, and then to party chez urlLink abraxas . Happy new year and all that to everyone who reads this, in the slightly forlorn hope that next year turns out a little less apocalyptic than last. Laterz...

 urlLink BBC Top Gear reports that the DVLA have, rather disappointingly, declined to nominate a champion to represent them in single combat against 60-year old mechanic Leon Humphreys, who has demanded the right to trial by combat after being charged with failing to notify the agency that his motorbike was off the road - a heinous crime which carries a UKP20 fine. Humphreys insists that trial by combat remains on the statutes, but the Lord Chancellor's office are "unaware" if this is the case. Cowards!

 Since it's the end of the year, and since I vaguely promised a few weeks ago that I'd reel off a list of musical recommendations at about this time, here are my 101 most played MP3 files of the year, at leaast according to the counters on the files, as played in Audion. Doesn't count tunes played on CD, vinyl or tape (all of which have become very occasional) or played elsewhere. These are not necessarily my favourite tracks by these artists, and by no means all my favourite artists, nor even my favourite types of music are represented - I don't think there's any jazz in here, for example, and not very much blues.

 urlLink Pepys Diary is to be published a day at a time in blog format! Whoohooo! Samuel Pepys, in case you didn't know, was a civil servant in 17th Century London who kept an exceptionally vivid and entertaining diary for 10 years, between 1659 and 1669, never intended for publication, but which became a principal source for historians of the Restoration. The decade covered by the diary included the Great Plague of 1665, and the Fire of London the following year, and because of his occupation, he was able to give an account of historical events as an insider - and of course it did no harm that he counted Isaac Newton and Christopher Wren amongst his homiez. Anyway, Sam becomes Emeritus Blogrollee around these parts... (via urlLink leuschke )

 I don't recall ever visiting urlLink The Texas Mercury before, but following a link from Arts & Letters Daily, I stumbled on urlLink an amusing piece about suicide (especially for the festive season!), and then urlLink J.R.R. Tolkien's Self-Interest: Anarchy, Anti-Scientism & Selfhood in Tolkien's Lord of the Rings , which examines some of the politics and the psychology of Middle Earth. I predict that I will buy a new copy of LOTR - my original copy was lent out, never to return - and read it again this coming year...

 I just got home from Liverpool, and checked the traffic, as you do. The traffic has declined considerably over the holidays, which is only to be expected, but all the same - a hundred and twelve page impressions on xmas day?!?! I am astonished.

 urlLink Joe Strummer 1952-2002 . A riot of my own

 If I had picked up the TV guide about 90 minutes earlier, I would have been in time to stick a tape into the machine and record today's Afternoon Play on BBC Radio 4, which is called "Blue Veils and Golden Sands", and tells the story of urlLink Delia Derbyshire of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. It was she who created the Doctor Who theme tune - without multitracking, can you imagine that? - and no-one knows how she did it. I will have to put together some links about DD - still, for the moment, and probably for an extremely short time, you can listen to a RA stream of the play on urlLink this link , and find out why I am in love with Delia Derbyshire...

 Ha, look at that! The date, I mean. December 23rd. That sneaked up on me. I have a busy day today; I have a train to catch tomorrow. I should be home at some point on friday, and I don't necessarily expect to be posting anything here until next weekend, although you never know. Solstice greetings to you and yrz. See you on the other side...

 Some nice bloggage about polar bears at urlLink burnt toast . Thought you'd like to know, assuming that isn't where you just came from...

 Lightning bloggage again: I ventured into the West End today - I certainly wouldn't ordinarily do such a thing on the last weekend before xmas, but I was seeing off my beloved to Newcastle for the next few days, and I wanted to get a component that would reduce my stress quite a bit. For however long it is, I've been using an external USB hub with its own power supply, which despite being upstream of a surge-protected box, would momentarily drop all of it's connections when the fridge switched itself on. Not every time, just often enough to cause my computer activity to be suspended by a minute or so, while the hub remembered it had in fact been a hub, once upon a time, and decided to take it up again. Meanwhile the G4 had decided that my USB audio devices were no longer obtainable, and reverted to the internal ones, and these had to be reset manually, twice or three times in a day. Gets to you after a while. I had considered building a script that would restore the audio settings onclick, but it was a preposterous thing to have to do. Instead I bought a new component, endured the befuddling nonsense of non-liability on the grounds of it not saying suitable for Macintosh clearly on the side of the box. I mean, a PCI card is a PCI card, isn't it? Why would it not work, specifically? No-one was very keen to discuss it. I brought home the card, I stuck it in the G4 and it works. And he saw that it was good, which is more than can be said for the grey miasma of hysteria and carnage that was Oxford Street, seen from the Tottenham Court Road end, at about three o'clock this afternoon. The magic of xmas hung over the scene like a toxic cloud. Time for a shower, and then, more enjoyment!

 Enthusiasm had a referral today from urlLink this page . I'd more or less forgotten I'd ever registered with The Pepys Project. Judging from the tag-line I evidently put up when I did, it must have been quite early this year, at the latest. And this is my second referral from there, according to them. Which suggests that in this case at least, having a presence on a blog portal is a lot less significant than being linked by a blog or two of good standing in what is uncertainly called the community. Anyway, its 9.30ish, I've finished work for the year and I have a pub to attend. Later.

 It's nearly ten o'clock, and I'm flying in one metaphorical door only to fly out the other: I've been having a little drink at my local and for the first time this year the festive cheer has sliightly got to me.. But I heard a story this evening that nudged me into remembering something I saw on somebody's blog a few days ago, and which has been rolling around in my mind ever since. It essentially said, there is someone watching you. there is always someone depending on you, learning from you, taking from you, and you may never know about it. So you must not sell yourself short. The story that made me think of this again is the story of a very dear friend of mine who works as a psychiatric nurse. A few days ago he was going about the secure wards where some particularly scary patients are, in the current parlance, "cared for". A dude came out of his space with a box blasting a particularly fetching piece of dub, and my friend recognised it, because I had played it to him regularly over the last several years. And there they were, dangerous psychiatric patient and nurse, rocking steady to the Sly and Robbie digital dub mix of Slaughter by urlLink Black Uhuru (and I wish I was packing the bandwidth to MPthree you up, here) and when the tune was done, where hitherto there had been the most disturbing and fearsome grimace, there was a raised fist - Jah! Ras Tafari! - I thought you were going to punch me, said my friend, and there was a broad grin. Music can be powerful medicine. One more day to go, and then, the holidays. For some reason, this year, I feel up for it.

 I see that the second Lord of the Rings movie is in the cinemas from today. I definitely wouldn't have been so interested in this, had I not seen the first one, only last night, in the extended DVD version (with extra features hand-crafted by dwarves, if I interpret the TV trailers correctly). I expect anyone who is interested in this is already well aware, but the Fellowship of the Ring, the first episode, rocks like a... well, what does it rock like? The CG effects are very, very nearly flawless. The casting is superb. The battle scenes are just extraordinary. I haven't read the book in more than twenty five years, and yet it took me right back into it, to the extent that I was able to ask, "So was that the Balrog, that the orcs were cooking up in that vat of excrement, or whatever it was?" just as if I knew what I was talking about. Thanks to urlLink Cath & Gareth for a wonderful evening. My turn to cook and entertain next time...

 urlLink We finally made it to the urlLink Museum of London on sunday, mostly to see the new London before London exhibit I posted about urlLink weeks ago , although we made it through history up until the Fire of 1666 before hunger and fatigue set in. The prehistory exhibit was pretty good. Some of the stone tools on display are fantastically beautiful, as were the very early pieces of metalwork, both jewellry and weapons. By way of a bonus, there were several pieces of statuary from a Mithraic temple in the Roman galleries, which reminded me that I really ought to get on with the Ophiuchus material I collected a while ago...

 Hit-and-run blogpost: urlLink Philip Hensher on PG Wodehouse in the Spectator. Wonderful - go read it. (via urlLink wood s lot ) PS. Unlikely to be further bloggage here today - I'll be socialising this evening... hey, it happens, every now and then!

 So anyway, I finished the third of the Philip Pullman His Dark Materials trilogy, urlLink The Amber Spyglass . It was mostly up to the standard of the first two, although it started running down about a hundred pages from the end - tying up all the various plot strands took up rather too long, which made for rather curious structural problems with the book, and made it slightly less satifying than the second book, The Subtle Knife - but I wouldn't want to criticise too much. These books are far superior to anything I've read in the genre, and I'd do them all again straight away if I didn't have a dirty great heap of other books to be getting on with...

 I really don't know if I'm coming or going. I've been called back into work tomorrow (different project - I've outrun the development process on the site I had been working on), so I don't think I'll be catching up with the blogging for a few more days yet...

 urlLink Cameron Turner showed up at 0324GMT this morning, for which enthusiasm rejoices.

 A few days ago I promised to explain Menzies as my suggested middle name for the forthcoming Cameron Turner . William Cameron Menzies (1896-1957). His urlLink IMDb reference page makes very interesting reading: many more credits as a production designer than as a director. According to Leonard Maltin's Movie Encyclopedia, Menzies was th first person ever to be credited as a Production Designer on a movie, and frequently had a much greater influence on the look of a film than the director, since the responsibility extended into costume and special effects. The lead comment on urlLink Things To Come (1936) declares that it was the beginning of the 'Intellectual Cinema' anticipated by Eisenstein, and the only recommended viewing suggested in connection with it is Kubrick's urlLink A Clockwork Orange (1971). Menzies also co-wrote a screenplay, with Joe Mankiewitz, of a 1933 version of urlLink Alice in Wonderland which I've never seen. He was second unit director (as well as production designer) for urlLink Gone With The Wind (1939) - which is to say he was responsible for most of the good things about that movie. And he is all over the 1940 version of urlLink Thief of Baghdad (1940), as uncredited director, associate producer and associate art director, amongst others. It was his second crack at this - he had been art director on the 1924 urlLink Roaul Walsh / Douglas Fairbanks Sr. version , too. Aside: have you noticed how web searches for poets, authors and visual artists, the chances are you're going to find something reasonably to the point, whereas if you're looking for film directors, actors and more obvious Celebrities, you find nothing but commercial crap?

 That "more later" is hanging over me. It's nearly midnight, and although I have not been unproductive today, I've spent more time than I care to remember just staring at the screen, fingers hovering over the keyboard, and nothing much else happening at all. For which I am sorry. It's not even as if I'm that short of things to write about. It just hasn't happened today. Maybe I'll feel better tomorrow...

 Perverse, that's what I call it. I wasn't home at all yesterday, and it was a day of such unparalleled wretchedness that I'll have to write it up in some form or other over the weekend (although quite what I'm going to say about it I'm not sure at this point). Nor did I get to post anything. Yet I had more traffic on the site than any day since I started working. Weird. It's enough to make a cynical person consider taking a break from posting, just to watch the statistics shoot up. Not that it works like that, of course, and in any case, it looks like I'll be spending more time with my blog from this weekend forth, because my work is coming to an early close. More later...

 urlLink Notes Quotes Provocations and Other Fair Use 62 is a stunningly beautiful weblog by Jouke Kleerebezum, and absolutely new to me. The image to your left is a remodelling of Thoreau's Walden Pond cabin that Jouke assembled in 1996, and reposted about three weeks ago. Blogrolled, oh yes. I wish I could stay up late and browse this for a couple of hours right now ... (via urlLink wood s lot - who also has an enviable collection of Mark Rothko links today...)

 I must be hallucinating. Enthusiasm appears to be numbered presently in the urlLink eatonweb portal Top 50 blogs. I didn't know they even had a Top 50, and I still don't know how it's worked out - possibly it's done with their rating system, but I can't see how this blog would pull that many votes when I don't even carry the rating form on the page, I'm just registered there, along with eight and a half thousand others. It sure as hell isn't the traffic, I can assure you of that. Anyone who understands these things is very welcome to wise me up in the comments. I should add that only two others in this Top 50 appear in my 'roll (RandomWalks and As Above) and apart from them, I've only actually heard of one other. Also, I should mention that this hot chart placing has resulted, as of this posting, in... hold on, let me count them... one referral...

 urlLink By slightly spooky coincidence, I just discovered that urlLink Lisa posted a picture of a polar bear at some point yesterday - spooky because when I saw it, I had already sat down to post the image you see here, which I threw together about three years ago, when my then-employer helpfully tossed me a CD of public domain photos which he thought might possibly be useful for the job in hand. Fifteen minutes later I printed out a copy of this montage I'd thrown together, and pinned it on the wall to inspire the colleagues. I don't think that was quite what he had in mind, but still... I rooted this image out in the wake of a news item on the TV in which people were discussing the proper levels of warning that should be given to tourists regarding security alerts. I suppose it's reasonably obvious how we got here from there...

 It turns out that there are no less than three imminently expectant fathers within the immediate blog horizons - in addition to urlLink Gary Turner and urlLink Tom Matrullo , there is urlLink Michael O'Connor Clarke , and he's come up with a notion that the three of them collaborate on a dedicated team blog to record their experiences. And so, urlLink BlogSprogs has come to be. urlLink Janeane is very taken with the idea.

 The fevered anticipation of Gary & Fiona's impending parenthood has resulted in an outbreak of wagering. urlLink AKMA is holding a sweep on the birthday, and the winner gets to provide yound Cameron's middle name. I've offered the full moon on the 19th, and Menzies for the monicker. I'll have to expand on that another time, cos I have to rush out of the house any minute now. By the way, without wishing for a moment to sound skeptical or anything, but can anyone discern a baby in urlLink this picture ?

 There are coots on the canal. My knowledge of birds is rather patchy, but the one thing I had managed to absorb about coots, along with how to recognize them, is that they are quarrelsome little fuckers. Well, this afternoon - just after dark, I nipped out the back of the office for a smoke, and there were three coots in the water: two males, fighting, one female, egging them on, and a supporting cast of ducks looking on, appalled. The fighting had already started when I arrived, and it was still going on when I finished my cigarette and it was far too cold to hang around and watch anymore. I've found a few pages describing this deplorable behaviour, the best of which is urlLink here . It describes American Coots, which look a little different about the upper beak to the local variety, but the fighting I saw was very much like the description. There's also a pretty good picture of coots fighting urlLink here , but it didn't reduce terribly well, so I used a more placid illustration. UPDATE: I've just been telling Sarah about this episode over the phone, and she advises me that one of Arthur Ransome's Swallows and Amazons books was called Coots, or something like it, and sure enough, here's a 1935 dustcover of Coot Club from urlLink here . A-and here's a urlLink cheesy sig tune to go with it, which is frankly not recommended at all.

 urlLink Both urlLink Portage and urlLink riley dog , and other blogs too, I imagine, have posted amazing pictures of urlLink bats from a portfolio site by urlLink Tim Flach - over the weekend I finally got around to visiting the site itself, and it is really impressive - but this is the picture that grabbed me, even more than the bats. I'm a pig enthusiast...

 The last time I went out to work on a regular basis, I would step out every lunchtime to a secondhand CD store, and I would seldom leave the place empty-handed. Usually I would be carrying four or sometimes more CDs to get me through the afternoon. I believe I bought something like 800 of the things during the two year contract. I did have a lot of catching up to do, though; I'd only acquired my very first CD player, if you can believe this, in December 1998, and for a full decade before that, I'd been in no position to buy music, so I'd amassed huge numbers of tapes. A fair proportion of the music I'd enjoyed through those years on cassette tape was the music I bought secondhand in Camberwell. Now I'm working in a kind of grey area between Islington and Hackney, and there are several secondhand music places within striking distance, but in two weeks, and not for the want of searching, nor of inclination, I have bought only one secondhand CD. It is I Am Shelby Lynne , by erm, Shelby Lynne. The MP3s are encoding as I type this. (One track from this album, the wonderful Leavin' , has been a playlist fixture for more than a year, and I'm hoping that it isn't the best track on there by too wide a margin.) Why am blathering on like this? Oh yes. Why am I not buying shedloads of new music anymore? I already have more music than any sensible person could want or need. Actually, about three or four times as much as any sensible person could want or need, and more than most of , you know, the other kind. I'm already spending too much time even deciding what to play next. I can move ridiculous amounts of music around with me on MP3. I don't have a portable player yet, but every day I've been carrying three or four CDs from my backup box into work and copying a selection onto hard disk at work. That hard disk is now positively groaning with the stuff. Perhaps I have more or less caught up with my tastes. There isn't really that much new music that interests me enough for me to make speculative purchases, which have always been an extravegance, and long may they remain so...

 I should tell you that I went to the ballet last night. I didn't know this was going to happen; I had this vague idea that I was going to be taken to see a ballet sometime around xmas, but it sneaked up on me, and S. reminded me about midday, when I was still somewhere far short of recovery from the previous night's revels. So I showered and shaved and made myself presentable, and off we went to Wimbledon Theatre, and sat down to watch urlLink A Christmas Carol in ballet. I was fully expecting to doze off by the middle of the first act, if you want to know the sad truth of it, but I stayed awake and although I am by no means an afficianado, I quite enjoyed it. I didn't care much for tthe music, which was determinedly middle of the road, and slathered with predictable festive cheer - but the staging and lighting was effective, and some of the costumes - notably the ghosts - were outstanding.

 Whimsical Googlism on a rainy saturday afternoon, following a night of rather too much fun: starting point was simply the palindromization of data into atad. in one parallel universe, ATAD refers to some kind of sewage urlLink treatment process , the TAD part of things being Treatment And Delivery - but I never caught what the A stood for. But in an urlLink entirely other universe , Atad was a place where Joseph and his brethren, when on their way from Egypt to Hebron with the remains of their father Jacob, made for seven days a "great and very sore lamentation." ( urlLink Gen. 50:10,11 )

 Eeksy-Peeksy has been really having a really good streak these past few days - urlLink Occultation and urlLink Porn (Without Sex) are well worth revisiting..

 I've spent my day rebuilding my template for the site I'm working on, from the ground up, reincorporating a whole bunch of deprecated and obsolete tags, because for some reason the client insists that the site should accommodate those who insist on using the vile and useless Netscape 4.x. Of course it all makes work for the working codemonkey to do, but I just hope no-one comes breezing along this evening saying sure, I swear by Netscape 4, wouldn't use anything else, what's the point in upgrading, because they're likely to get a smack around the head...

 I can't spend as long on this as I would like - I have to go and cook a risotto - but if I don't put something down now, I might forget, and we don't want that. I walk through a little patch of my own personal heaven every morning on my way to work. It is a short stretch of the Regent Canal, parallel to the City Road, between the Angel, where I burst out of the Fritz Lang nightmare of the tube system, and Wharf Road, where I climb the steps. There are a number of narrow boats moored along the canal at this point, and the banks are green and dark with overhanging trees, and the narrowboats - at least some of them - are a vision of a way of life that I pine for, though why exactly they have such a strong impression on me, I could not say. This morning as I reached the canal bank, an unfamiliar boat had moored immediately before the canal disappears into a tunnel. Evidently it is inhabited by a woodsman - there's a tree surgeon's sign on the side, and the aroma of woodsmoke from the stove below is delicious. On other boats along the bank, I notice bunches of drying flowers and bundles of withies, evidence of manual crafts that have all but disappeared from the environment. I get a thrill from these few minutes' walk every morning, even when the weather is filthy. It is one of the most magical spots that I know, in London or anywhere else.

 urlLink Magic Kingdoms In the New Yorker, Adam Gopnik asks, what is a fairy tale, anyway? Fairy tales, however many times they are transformed, depend in some part for their effect on an air of sincerity, of urgent seriousness. For the not merely wise but wised-up children of this new century, other tales and other, more skittish ways of telling seem to have usurped the old stories and styles. Which means that the fairy tale could be headed for the place where all our good used-up things go, America's Island of Misfit Toys, the college English department.

 Well, it's half time at Stamford Bridge - I've been following the urlLink live text commentary of the match on the BBC, and we're 2-0 down. So, I'm heading for the pub, the better to console myself in defeat, or add to the excitement if we manage to come back into the game. More (and wobblier) typing later, possibly...

 urlLink Jury Service , a collaborative fiction by Cory Doctorow and Charlie Stross, is being serialised in weekly installments through this month at scifi.com. The first part is up today... (via urlLink Boing Boing , of course)

 Sitting proud at the top of the Blogdex chart right now, urlLink Eyeballing Total Information Awareness exposes convicted perjuror and all-round sleazeball John Poindexter to something like the scrutiny he intends to impose on his fellow Americans...

 Steven Green (of urlLink Plep ) is blogging up a storm on his South African trip at urlLink AfriPlep ...

 Thanks for more permalinkage to HotSoupGirl, whose blog may or may not still be called urlLink mechanically separated chicken . I must admit I'm getting a little panicky, these last few days, now that I don't have anywhere near the time I used to devote to prowling the web for blogging grist. But then I think to myself, well, there's some people who post maybe only once every week, or less, and I still go back and check them out...

 urlLink The Curse of Tom Wolfe Michael Shapiro bemoans the fate of magazine feature writing, which he assures us has fallen into a kind of technically accomplished entropy... I'd pipe up with a comment of some sort, but I don't remember the last time I actually finished a magazine feature, and I suppose that tells its own story.... (via urlLink Arts & Letters Daily )

 urlLink Since the early 1980s, artist Hubert Duprat has been utilizing insects to construct some of his "sculptures." By removing caddis fly larvae from their natural habitat and providing them with precious materials, he prompts them to manufacture cases that resemble jewelers' creations. Information theory, as explained by biologists such as Jacques Monod and Henri Atlan, helps us understand what seems to be the insect's aesthetic behavior. The activities of the caddis worm, as manipulated by Hubert Duprat, are prompted by the "noise"---beads, pearls and 18-karat gold pieces---introduced by the artist into the insect's environment. This article is based on a conversation between the artist and art critic Christian Besson.

 The mathematics of urlLink Spirograph - it had to be out there somewhere... (via urlLink memepool )

 I'm not in the business, directly, indirectly or at all, of accessorising celeb stalkers, so I won't reproduce the search, but in the course of my travels in Google just now, I was suddenly confronted with something that looks very much like home address and phone number details for Lou Reed - as a result of looking up one of the albums. I'm spending most of my available hours feeding the mighty MP3 database, mostly with tags. Data entry, hypnotic, compulsive, makes you feel bad. Rather like games for me, in fact. I almost don't do games. Anyway, it explains, if not forgives my silence. Back soon.

 I hope to get some bloggage done this weekend, including a speech to the Immortal Memory of Robert Burns for not one but two Burns Suppers we'll be attending this weekend. The speech is going on the road tomorrow, and in all truth it still needs a lot of work. I expect I'll be posting it on Sunday morning, but I'll be running some links to research sources as and when I pick them up early tomorrow. Or maybe this evening since, in the course of a suggestion that we just stay in tonight (on a friday!?) addressed to me during the previous paragraph, Sarah observed that my fingers were tinkling on those keys like a man who's enjoying himself"...

 I've written a basic draft of a welcome page that may at some point greet those who roll up here wearing Netscape 4.x. It goes like this: Aah, Netscape 4.x. So. We meet again. This site does its very best to be W3C standards-compliant. It may even "validate". If it doesn't, someone will be working on it. This browser, however, is a very, very long way short of standards-compliance. This browser, my dear sir or madam, is a dying breed:- something in excess of 99% of the internet has now upgraded to standards-compliant browsers, and those people are, I promise you, having an absolutely wonderful time with their CSS layout, snappy pageloads, and so forth. These are sites that, were you to visit them in this old jalopy, might resemble something sad and broken. But those sites are not sad & broken! Your browser, dearest of visitors, is what is sad and broken. What is your problem? Consult your dealer, you know? So, the word is, go immediately to a download site such as (whatever) and get yourself a proper browser. Mozilla 1.2.1 is very good, and it's workings will be more familiar to Netscape users than they might be otherwise.

 I believe this has already been slashdotted over the weekend, but there's a blinking world exclusive at ufomag.co.uk, where they will shortly be revealing photographical evidence, ladies and gentemen, of UFOs taken by satellite and analysed by somebody called urlLink EUROSETI , which sounds like one of those urlLink Brands You've Almost Heard Of , and then you look back at the actual front page of urlLink UFO Magazine and you think.... nah...

 Well, there's no escaping the fact that there's been nothing on here since thursday, so I must be leading an eventful life. The damaged fingernail came off on friday, and I was going to scan the result, which is by far the most photogenic state its been in since the accident - but then I remember I haven't used the scanner since before the migration, and then I remember the dishes. Or the kettle. Anyway, it isn't done yet, and neither for that matter are the dishes. Of the weekend, I remember football. I remember seeing a mouse on the railway line, and then a fox trotting (as they are wont to do) behind the fence, running the length of the platform opposite. I remember waking up more often in chairs than in full repose. And lots of preening of MP3 id tags, the better to play around with them in iTunes. iTunes is growing on me, I must admit. Soon as I've got the basics out of the way, I'll write me some of them Smart Playlists. Aherm. Yessir. So what with all that, and coding eight hours a day for money, and two hours (or more) per day commuting... you probably know how the sums go. I just don't have the hours I used to devote to this. I'm definitely looking at that commute. That's a lot of reading and writing time...

 Second talk on matters esoteric in the space of a week. I must be needing to restore balance to a life given over to coding for a living. Last night Steve Wilson addressed a packed upper room at the Princess Louise in New Oxford Street on the subject of "Living Gnosticism". This was a meeting of a group called The Secret Chiefs, about which you can read urlLink here (although there isn't a whole lot there - the list of previous talks makes interesting reading, though...). SW's talk was complex and bewildering in parts, but contained interesting revelations: there is apparently an authentic and continuous gnostic sect which traces back to pre-christian times, originating (?) in what is now northern Iraq - and a good number of them are living in exile just down the road from me, in Catford! They are called the Mandaeans, and they are the people referred to in the Koran as the Sabians. They have an urlLink official site (sluggish to load, most of it in Arabic, but it's there) - or you might keep an eye out on urlLink Google ...

 urlLink Attended another meeting of the South East London Folklore Society last night - Michael Staley gave forth on the subject of initiation, with particular reference to an urlLink Austin Osman Spare drawing called The Background of Prescience . I've been unable to find this picture on the interweb, but there are some typical examples of Spare's work urlLink here . He wasn't a great artist, but he was a hell of a lot better than Crowley, who for all his other talents was a dreadful painter (and not in a good way). I must say I was a little surprised to hear that he didn't think formal initiation was very important. It's understandable that someone may find the experience something of a let-down if initiation (in the sense of revelation of hidden knowledge) doesn't provide answers the initiate might hope for - but I have to suggest that there is a social and psychological significance in exoteric initiation, the loss of which in secular society, it could be argued, makes lifelong infants of us all. Which is all very fine for proponents and beneficiaries of heirarchical, paternalistic (and for that matter, consumerist) societies - but of course there are initiations for the elites, the Freemasons and the likes of the urlLink Skull & Bones - now, what about the rest of us? Shouldn't we consider reclaiming our rituals of validation and recognition as grownups? Mmmm?

 Such has been my state of distraction that a blogworthy thought that occured to me a full ten days ago hasn't yet made it into the blog. It was only because it cropped up in conversation in the pub last night that I'm recalling it now: has anyone noticed how tech shops are changing their look? It struck me, as I say, about ten days ago when I ventured into Tottenham Court Road to buy a hard disk. As the kit becomes smaller, computer shops are starting to resemble jewellers' stores, as the merchandise gets smaller, ever more bijou : only the secondhand stores have the ranks of beige boxes that used to fill the storefronts of TCR... I wonder if the stores themselves will eventually shrink around the wares they sell, or if the space will be more taken up with the glossy lifestyle projections that come with the selling of consumer electronics...

 It's been a little while since there were any new incoming links to enthusiasm, but I'm chuffed to see visitors from urlLink anglepoised heading this way. Hello! You'd never credit it, but at one time I used to blog about other things besides the state of my net connection, and which email addresses are currently on speaking terms with my mail client du jour . Seriously. Hang about, it's bound to get interesting again before too long...

 There had to be an easier way, but I made it back (again). The problem seems to have been a suspicious IP address that somehow crept into the network settings which wouldn't be removed, and some alteration to the startup routine that wanted to wait for network initialisation before letting me in. After a minute or so, it would give up waiting and start the machine up anyway. If this had been 9.2, I'd have just thrown away the network prefs and taken it from there, but at this stage it is far from obvious to me which file I could safely and usefully throw away, so I ended up doing a fresh install of OSX (with upgrades) and drivers for the DSL modem (with upgrades) and the driver for the USB hub that connects the DSL modem, re-entered all the settings and now (should that be for now ?) it's all working again. Maybe I'll have time for some interesting bloggage a bit later on, but I didn't have breakfast yet...

 This is most annoying - I was connected perfectly happily via OSX for more than an hour, doing all the things you do, and then I restarted in 9.2, to use some software that didn't seem very happy working under Classic. Job done, I restarted back in OSX - and the blasted thing is denying all knowledge of ever having heard of the boradband setup - the diagnostics software is still there (it tells me that it is diagnostics software, but it doesn't tell me much else, like a few health professionals I know) but the connection program insists that the communications device does not exist, and I should verify my settings and try again. And here I am back in 9.2, connected through a communications device which most definitely exists, and wondering what to try next. Does this ring bells for any OSX / broadband users out there? Any thotz?

 Did everyone already know that urlLink Norah Jones is Ravi Shankar's daughter, except for me? I nearly bought the album yesterday, in the secondhand CD shop, but they wanted a tenner for it, and I'm pretty sure I could get it new for a tenner if I looked around...

 urlLink William Gibson has a blog! I realise that this news is all over the place right now, but I couldn't really neglect to mention it. Started on monday, with the promise: In spite of (or perhaps because of) my reputation as a reclusive quasi-Pynchonian luddite shunning the net (or word-processors, depending on what you Google) I hope to be here on a more or less daily basis.

 Snow in London this morning. It's been a couple of years since we last saw any, and no doubt the city will be brought to a standstill as usual. There was about three or four inches of the stuff down in Sydenham/Forest Hill, and much thinner in town (I orginally typed "in the center" - I'm definitely coding too much), where it presumably melts on the way down... and wacky dreams last night, oh boy. If I can dredge enough details up, I think there might be the foundations of a pretty good horror movie...

 urlLink Structures and New Worlds - deep commentary on the work of The BBC Radiophonic Workshop by Robin Carmody, in truly frightening red sans-serif-on-black-with-bright-yellow-links. Grab the text and paste it into something more tasteful. (via Simon Reynolds' urlLink blissblog , which I now guiltily realise I forgot to blogroll when I last mentioned it...)

 Fabulous flash trinkets at urlLink N3xt.com , the picture being from the implicitly dated September 2000. Show me a clip of Louise Brooks and I'm sold . (via urlLink riley dog ) I realise I'm not illustrating terribly much lately, and until I get acclimatised to OSX, this is likely to continue. I'm only able to do this at the moment 'cos I'm on a flying visit back to OS9.2, collecting my mail. The email problems persist, and the support guy could only tell me that I shouldn't have been able to collect my mail the way I've been doing it for the past year either, which wasn't terribly supportive. Still, he's promised to call me back...)

 Here, mostly because I spotted a guy on the train home who looked a lot like him but probably wasn't, is the links page to the urlLink Fifth Aeon Agregore , which is Phil Hine's home on the web, and a useful archive of Chaos Magick resources. I did a workshop with Phil Hine about nine years ago in Wales, and iit was great fun. If Phil is reading this, hello. You may be amused to hear that the daemon we inaugurated that day near Machynlleth is still alive and well, and living in my teapot. Which reminds me, the kettle boiled some time ago...

 The net connection in here is a little temperamental - it's working okay right now, but I'm not exactly sure why now , and not for hours previously - and I've only managed to get the Mail client to pick up mails from my least useful address, so I'll have to revert to 9.2 to collect most of my mail, every now and then, until I get it sorted out. Apologies for any delay in replying to whatever anyone may have sent. Normal services (whatever they might be) will be resumed before too long, no doubt...

 Finally made it through the fog. This is my first post through OSX. The place is a mess - huge numbers of empty disk partitions all over the place, and everything is stacked up in the 120GB hard disk I bought yesterday specially for the move. Lots of unpacking to do. But the important thing is the migration is done, and the net connection is on. Whoohoo!

 The OSX install seems to have gone okay, but there's no net connection in there yet - I'm off to bed, and I'll be having a good long brow-furrowing THINK in the morning before any more fiddling occurs. I am so glad I don't have to do this every day....

 While I can still reach you - I'm up to my knees in the deeply scary process of migrating to OSX. I don't know how this is going to work out at all, but as far as I can make out, I do have a line of retreat in case things get really screwed. I hope to be able to connect and post from inside OSX within the next couple of hours. You might offer a libation to whatever geeky gods you favour on my behalf. Otherwise I'll see you sometime tomorrow, older, wiser, chastened and back in OS9..2...

 Belated birthday congrats to urlLink Plep , which is three years (and a day) old.

 Maps and territories continued. Eliot has this multicolored pixillated world map posted, and by clicking on the map, we conquer a part of the world for FmH. Fair enough. So I clicked on the map, and was presented with a page titled urlLink referer risk , further advising that I have conquered a segment of Egypt between longitude 28 and 30 and latitude 22 and 24. This piece of land was owned by majcher.com. Oops! It turns out that my little portion of the world is entirely featureless, at least according to my battered, 30 year old atlas, but the Tropic of Cancer runs through it.

 There was a time when New Year's Day was the most documented day of the year - diaries abandoned after a single entry. The emptiness of the day itself, the year not yet really begun, the festivities over (at last) and what better way to fill out the day than inscribing one's intentions, formalised as grandly capitalized Resolutions. Then the year got started, everything went back to normal, the diaries, and most of the intentions probably, forgotten. Now our diaries are everywhere, normal is nowhere, and we have these machines to do our remembering for us... urlLink Once upon a time, I climbed a mountain at New Year. 1984? 1985? One or the other. The mountain was Ben Rinnes (840m, doesn't sound as impressive as 2,759ft, does it?), the northernmost of the Bens, southwest of Dufftown, and no more than about 4km from Glen Fiddich. There were white hares up there, peering at us from rocky look-outs at a safe distance, and then haring off over the snow - as they are, of course, completely entitled to do - before we got anywhere near them... We climbed the northern face, in shade, so as we reached the higher ground, windblown ice and snow, cloud peeling off the mountaintop and trailing away behind us, the watery midwinter sun down into our faces through the ice mist. One of the most unworldlly environments I've ever experienced... you can find Ben Rinnes by clicking on the (unhelpfully reduced) map there, finding Dufftown with the search facility, and heading SW. The urlLink Ordnance Survey site appears to offer no way to bookmark locations, nor to determine a grid reference for a location, once found. Room for a little improvement there, I think...

 Sorry for the absence - I've been ripping. As it were. And I've discovered one of those things it's really only possible to discover when you're immersed in MP3s, which is that I have music dating from every year going back to 1923, except for two years. These would be 1932 and 1943. These may get filled in as I finish off putting the dates on the 2,118 tunes that don't have dates attached, but possibly not. So if anyone out there can, erm, recommend something or other from those years, I'd be most grateful...

 Today I am mostly enjoying urlLink Milestone at the Garden subtitled Irish Fiddle Masters from the 78rpm Era (meaning, 1923-1959). I've had this CD for about three years, but it fell among low company (less interesting compilations) and I'd forgotten, until yesterday, that I even owned a copy. The album included what is presently the oldest dated recording in my MP3 collection, Over The Lakes , played by Fireman Barney Conlon, in 1923, older by a couple of years than the oldest tracks on the Harry Smith Anthologies. Sadly, this was Fireman Barney's only recording - what a terrible waste of a great name! - and the only references I've found to the guy through Google bring me straight back to this particular track on this CD. And there are no pictures, so here's one from the booklet of the Hanafin Brothers, whose contribution is Miss Macleod's (1926) will be recognisable to Holy Modal Rounders fans (and others) as Hop High Ladies .

 It's taken a few days for me to notice, but Dr Menlo's got hisself a radio stream at urlLink Live365 - dr menlo radio . Been playing it for all of seven minutes, which isn't really enough to comment on the programming, but.... I WANT ONE!

 "If we accept the notion that using power against the powerless is wrong, a clear enough set of corollaries begins to emerge. We become able to distinguish, as populations (though not always their rulers) have usually been able to do, between outlaws and evil-doers, between outlawry and sin. Not much analysis is needed, because it is something we can sense in all its dead-serious immediacy. 'But all they are are bandits', the rulers whine indignantly, 'motivated only by greed'. Sure. Except that, having long known the difference between theft and restoration, we understand the terms of the deal whereby outlaws, as agents of the poor, being more skilled and knowledgable in the arts of karmic readjustment, may charge no worse than an agent's fee, small enough to be acceptable to their clients, ample enough to conver the risks they have to take, and we always end up loving these folks, we cheer for John Dillinger, Rob Roy, Jesse James, at a level of passion usually reserved for sports affiliation." Thomas Pynchon, from his introduction to Stone Junction , by Jim Dodge.

 So, word of the day was urlLink Copacetic . It showed up first in How The Dead Live by Will Self, and then failed to show up in the online dictionary, or my dead tree dictionary. The explanation for the word linked above doesn't provide any conclusive etymology, either - but I do have a record called Copasetic, by the Rulers, from Leslie Kong's studio in Kingston, about 1968. And later this afternoon, in the market at Crystal Palace, I turned up another Jamaican record on the Copasetic label. If I was stuck for things to collect, which I certainly am not, I might start a collection of words of unknown origin. I can't help but feel it's a fine quality in a word, that no-one can say where it comes from, or from what it is derived... but as Homer Simpson would have it, the important thing is that I diidn't dream it ...

 There's a rather strange antique shop just down the road from me - strange, because it's isolated and in London at least, antique shops tend to flock together in chichi areas that can stand the pain. Also the proprietors are anti-vivisection campaigners, not that there's anything wrong with that, but there's something slightly unhinged about the rather home-made, off-the-top-of-their-heads way they go about it: slightly deranged looking petitions pinned up in the window along side the china and upholstery. That isn't what this is about, although in a way, it makes what I just saw in their window even more bizarre. It's a life size bronze of a pit-bull terrier (or similar fighting dog, I'm not really up on the nastier breeds of canine) in full, snarling lunge. Four hundred and fifty quid to you, squire. And you know what? Round here, it will probably sell within the week. Not to connoisseurs of 19th century bronzes, either... I don't imagine it will still be there when I buy my camera, around the end of the month, but if it is, I'll post a picture...

 Baked a loaf last night, using yeast whose sell-by date expired five years ago . The result was completely fine. I wouldn't recommend this approach with regard to, say, meat pies, but. But.

 Aw'right then. Looks as if I won't be going out to work again until next monday, so along with a whole shivering heap of domestic chores to be undertaken, I'll be able to spend a little more time with my dialogue box. Yippee! As I mentioned, I've been spending a lot of time preening the tags on my MP3s, the better to employ the programmable playlists. These are coming along nicely, although it feels a little like I imagine it feels to be painting the Forth Bridge. Anyway, I've started implementing a custom genre system, the categories of which refer to moods rather than musical genres, because I may well require a dose of confrontational music (genre contains 'represent'), but when would I ever filter on 'rock', because I felt like listening to generic 'rock' music (however you care to draw the boundaries of that concept)? There are a few musical genres I might preserve - I may well want to filter a 'jazz' or 'dub' subset out of the 'shinyhappy' or 'blue' genres, for example... now that the basics are out of the way (duplicates removed, variations of spelling artist's names resolved, and the dates of release (at least for whole albums), trickier bits like genre handling can proceed more or less organically.

 There's a more comprehensive set of links to pictures of the blogmeet at the Green Man pulled together by Bel at urlLink Rise . Along with links to the various accounts of the evening to have appeared so far...

 There's pictures, courtesy of Cal Henderson, of the Blog Meet at the urlLink Green Man . A most enjoyable evening altogether. Anything I might have promised anyone is subject to review on being reminded. Completely unable to string words together yesterday.

 urlLink Now isn't that ironic? I paste in the recommended code for the little CSS Brave Little Codemonkey badge, and it fucking BREAKS! Above is how it ought to be written, without the line breaks in the image tag. Good grief, Charlie Brown...

 urlLink src="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/images/vcss" alt="Valid CSS!"> - by way of demonstrating just how relaxed I am this afternoon, I validated my code. The page would validate as XHMTL 4.01 Transitional - were it not for the ironic use of the blink tag last week, and for the Google search link, also from last week, which contains arguments that the validator doesn't much care for. The code for the page itself is clean as a freshly minted Clean Thing.

 Well then, the two sets of templates I've been working on since mid-December are finally put to bed. The sites themselves won't be live for a while yet. And I can relax for a while. Whaaaa-hey, and all that. This evening, I'm going to look in on the London blog meet - which I'd missed completely until urlLink Cath and urlLink Owen mailed me about it. Seems like a pretty good way to wind down after the hardest week's work I've had in years. Also, an opportunity to meet some of the nice people I've got to know only through their blogs, over the last year and a bit. The blog meet, in case the information is of any interest to you, will be at The Green Man pub by Great Portland Street station, at 7pm this evening. Be there or not.

 Working lo-ong hours this week, so I'm only very marginally aware that there is a world to be blogged out there. Yesterday I picked up a copy of Lou Reed's Metal Machine Music - at last! - and I even played most of it, though I didn't have time for it all. I hadn't heard any of it for at least ten years, nor seriously listened to it for more like twenty. Striking how musical it sounds, this time around... in case you've never experienced it, you can find a review with samples urlLink here ...

 It's nearly bedtime, but I have to report myself a happy camper, because the copy of urlLink Amazon.com: Music: Anthology Of American Folk Music Volume 4 (Edited By Harry Smith) that I ordered about a month ago finally arrived, and it's beautiful. Amazon says: Smith confesses that this volume was "lost" because his original liner notes went missing; he had hoped to create a thorough analysis of how each song's theme was interrelated...

 This is turning into a portent, that's what it's doing. For three days or so, I've left an MP3 file on my desktop, which is where it first appeared overnight. At first I thought it had come in as an attachment, but on closer examination it turned out to be a copy of a file I already had in my library. I hadn't played it recently, but somehow a copy of it had popped up on the desktop. It's the tenth track from Bob Calvert's urlLink Captain Lockheed and the Starfighters . Now I've eventually got around to playing the track again, and the album and since urlLink the story is pretty interesting , I did a little googling, as one does, and came across urlLink this page the first item on the menu of which promises "Brief history with details of speed records" but the link takes us urlLink here , and we find ourselves righteously spooked out.

 urlLink Thanks to a tip-off from urlLink plasticbag.org , I am now playing about with a very cute new software gizmo, name of urlLink Clutter . It's a little OS X application that looks up the tune playing in your iTunes, fetches the appropriate album cover from the prodigous Amazon database, and displays it in the primary Clutter window. Then, the cute part. It is possible to drag any number of these album cover images onto the desktop, where they can sit, in whatever arrangement you may care for, and you can rummage around in them, and when you find something you fancy hearing, you double click it, and off it goes. There's more. The album covers, which behave somewhat like windows, and somewhat like icons, are zoomable from ridiculously tiny to screen-fillingly huge. Keystrokes will whisk to to the relevant page on Amazon, or to Google search results. There are a couple of minor grumbles, which aren't really serious enough to amount to bugs - the search is rather literal, and I was dismayed to find that the first three or four tracks I tried gave no results when Amazon's database disagreed in rather inconsequential ways with my ID tags, and when I double click an album on my desktop, it takes a small eternity to find the tracks in my collection and get going. But then, my collection is unfeasibly large. This thing has been out in the world about two weeks, so I expect there will be some refinements - mutating into a plug-in for iTunes, perhaps? - but it's a brilliiantly simple idea, it deserves to be everywhere, and to make Sprote a gazillionaire. Which, since Clutter is freeware, is unlikely to happen... Now, if some kind soul would figure a way of piping this through to blogger or MT, and we can have a bunch of album covers floating up and floating down the page, we've got something that'll show a clean pair of heels to Blogamp, n'est ce pas?

 If you didn't already, go and read urlLink Robin Cook's resignation speech . Terrific stuff, and backhanded compliment though it may be, I have to say I haven't been so convinced by any statement from Robin Cook since, well, about May 1997...

 Last night I (rather unexpectedly) witnessed urlLink J-Walk vs La Planete Sauvage at the ICA. Electronica duo providing live soundtrack to a rather lovely French science fiction animation made in 1973. There were some creaky moments, as you might expect from a semi-improvised performance, but it all worked pretty well. The music made me want to go home and listen to PiL's Metal Box again, which can't be a bad thing... mind you, from the reviews I'm seeing here and there on the interweb, I'd be very interested to hear Alain Goraguer's original soundtrack of the movie...

 A few catch ups: the coots are nesting now. I'd been off work for four days before yesterday (long birthday weekend, thank you for asking) and when I took my first nicotine break of the morning, there she was, esconced, every inch the empress, and bad-tempered with it, being, when all is said and done, still a coot. Her other half is still chugging up and down the canal basin, collecting twigs, and muttering. I still haven't bought the camera. Top candidate is the Canon Powershot, but I'm still dithering. When I do, I can foresee this mutating into more of a photo blog, since I just don't have the time anymore to rummage around on the net for things to write about, and I don't really do journal blogs. Not really. Despite evidence from the last couple of months' archives which may suggest that I do. If this does turn to photobloggery, I'll be starting out with some old stuff, from the last time I had the use of a camera. Watch this space. Or, you know, some other space. I'm easy.

 I have the sound turned down on urlLink SAS Jungle: Are You Tough Enough? , so who knows what post-everything, ironic spin may or may not come into play, but since when did human rights violations become a spectator sport? And on the (cough, splutter) license fee, too??? (UPDATE: for some reason, I haven't been able to post this comment despite numerous attempts since last evening. This is monday lunchtime speaking, here goes another attempt... no, still not happening... maybe if I try through a different browser - although I'll be most displeased if it should turn out that I can only publish if I'm running Explorer...)

 Exhaustive list of urlLink The 37 Dramatic Situations considered to be possible, according to Geoges Polti. Actually, Polti listed 36, and the last one (Mistaken Identity) was added by someone else. I used to hear that there were only seven basic stories, but then someone demonstrated in the Notes and Queries section of the Guardian that all seven were contained in the plot of Casablanca, and therefore there was only one story, and that story was urlLink Casablanca ... Anyway, this page, apart from listing the 37 stories, randomly emboldens one for you. Mine was number 31, Conflict with A God. Come and Have a go if you think you're omnipotent enough.

 urlLink Yesterday's mystery bird has been identified by a workmate. The blighter's a Muscovy Duck, and the photo on the left there is the only one of the many I've found that looks anything like the bird I saw yesterday (and again today). Most Muscovy ducks are darker of plumage. Little known facts about the Muscovy duck: They don't swim very much, because unlike most ducks, their waterproofing oil glands are not well developed. You're more likely to come back with a recipe than natural history. jThe American Heritage Dictionary describes the bird's flesh as 'succulent', which is a bit fruity for a dictionary, if you ask me. urlLink Muscovy duck in burgundy and cranberry sauce sounds rather nice. The workmate who identified him added that he was obliged to boot the creature into the canal this morning, when he was menaced and hissed at on the canal path. This duck is possessed of a Bad Attitude. I forgot to mention yesterday that he was mostly engaged in psyching out the geese. Muscovies are natives of South America, the they are the only domesticated ducks unrelated to the mallard. Which perhaps explains why I didn't think the beak was duck-like. urlLink Here is a picture of a Musocovy Duck in profile, in silhouette, and up a tree, which shows just how little like ducks these fellows can look. And urlLink here , ladies and gentlemen, is a PDF of an article which claims that "The Internet Is A Muscovy Duck". A proposition which requires further rumination, I think...

 Twitchers of the blogosphere, help me out here. There was a mystery visitor to the canal basin today. A large bird - at least as big in the body as the Canada geese that hang around there, but with shorter legs and shorter neck. Sharply defined but irregular pathes of black and white feathers on the body, black to grey wings, briight red about the eyes, and a dark crest. I didn't see him swimming, but if he wasn't some kind of water bird, you'd have to have him down as some kind of water bird wannabe, considering the location. Cack-handed drawing from memory enclosed. I wasn't close enough to see the beak properly, but it didn't seem at all duck or goose-like. I already looked in some of the more obvious places to check, like the urlLink Bird Family List , but other than establishing that it definitely wasn't a Crested Grebe, I'm none the wiser....

 You really have to go and see urlLink the World As A Blog , which shows a point of light at the location of a freshly updated blog on a map of the world. There aren't many blogs registered in there yet (and enthusiasm, I have to admit, isn't yet one of them), but what a brilliant idea... (via Idletype, via reading & writing)

 I was woken up by a robot telephone voice this morning, which let me know that I should hold on, because there was a call waiting for me. The next voice greeted me by name, and then explained that it was from some financial company or other. Another robot voice. When it got through its introduction, I said, "this is telemarketing, isn't it?" No emotion, but at least no evasion. "yes" "no thankyou" It was still apologising when I hung up. It seems the forces of darkness have figured away to waste my time without going to the trouble of paying a miserable wage to some schmuck in a call centre...

 Things are looking up. Not only have I wrestled the blog back into some semblance of order, but suddenly I'm able to post again through Mozilla. Don't know where the blame lay with the problems I was having, but uploading posts has been impossible using the copy of Moz I was using until today (a fresh installation of 1.3b). Now I can relax, and maybe even get back to actual blogging. You never know...

 Whoah. More avian spookiness. I'm standing there in my customary nicotine spot by the canal, watching the geese, the coots, the ripples on the water, and looking out for fish. I've seen the same young pike in the canal three or four times now, and I was thinking, you don't see any herons around here. And then I look up, and perched right across the canal, not fifty yards away, there's a big grey heron, pretty much as illustrated. Magnificent creature. Now seriously, I've been working here since November, and not once have I seen a heron on these waters, until *the very moment* that I think to myself, hmmm, you don't see them round here... NOTE: this was originally posted on 28th March, as is still reflected in the archives. If you've been over this site in the past few days you may have noticed that the whole thing got into a terrible tangle, and the original post was deleted - kind of - during one of several attempts to clean up the mess.

 urlLink Sorry if this strikes you (as it vaguely strikes me) as a case of Look, Kittens! - but it happens that the first sequence of pics from the new camera will star a bunch of Fluffy Gosling Chickies and their Brave Mom. But it's late, I don't have time to code the click-through right now, and I'll be on a train in the morning, so most of it will have to wait, but this here's a taster. I've optimised it quite brutally, and it won't be winning any wildlife prizes, but whatever. Yes, So, Mother Goose fends off a passing coot and her chick, protecting her own newly hatched goslings. The little fellas on the right of the picture had been eggs not so very long ago at all. Who's a lucky boy to have this sort of malarkey going on under his nose when he nips out for a roll-up, then? I'm heading out west for a few days, so bloggage is expected to be slight, even by my current languid, not to say torpid, pace...

 Well, finally, today is the day. I'm racing out of here at lunchtime to go and buy a urlLink Nikon Coolpix 4300 . Assuming this goes smoothly, pictures will begin to appear by the middle of next week (I'm off to Wales this weekend, so there isn't likely to be any bloggage to speak of until I get back...

 Picked up Summer Sun , the new Yo La Tengo CD today. It sounded murky and bewildering on headphones at work this afternoon, but right now, on the big speakers, its just fine. Also a clutch of Greatest Hits compilations, dirt cheap: a good Al Green collection (there are plenty of not-so-good ones around, but this is the seventies hits package, with three extra tracks, including his soporific version of Unchained Melody, which I won't be playing until much later this evening; ELO - I've finally caved in to the notion that ELO are actually cool now. I've resisted this peculiar notion until now, and I have to admit they sound much better now than they ever did the first time around. Finally, an Edith Piaf - late, live recordings, most of the big tunes, good quality recordings, every home should have one...

 Walking along the canal path on the way to work just now, I saw a man bending to pick something up. He was in his sixties, dressed in shabby waterproofs, and wearing a flat cap. He straightened up, and walked down the path towards me, and as he passed, he said out loud, to no-one in particular: "Wonderful!"

 I just visited my stats page for the first time since about February, and was surprised to find that although visitors to this site are fewer than they were last year when I was doing this pretty much full time, the decline seems to have bottomed out at quite a respectable level: average daily visits have settled at roughly 120, which is half what it was at the peak. Which is quite astonishing to me, and which makes me agonise all the more over not being able to post more. I realise I've said it before, but it really isn't any lack of inclination that's caused this torpor, but lack of time...

 urlLink Here's the product of several hours' picture tweakage: I took a long detour after work a few weeks ago to get to the other side of the canal basin, to get up close to the Muscovy duck, and while I certainly got close, the pictures were a bit flat. So I tweaked, and I trimmed and cropped and here's the result - no longer looking much like a photograph, but looking a great deal like the Muscovy... and also, it has to be said, quite a bit like Darth Maul...

 Enthusiasm has a second blog child, urlLink Gypsy Mongrel . Very early days yet. If I still had the leisure time to go researching, I'd be off looking for second sibling characteristics on the interweb, but I have to go to work in... fifteen minutes, and here's me still dressed in a towel...

 Um, here's a new look for the site. Not much time to actually post anything else just now, but there's some catching up to do...

 What will they think of next? Severely disabled people who cannot operate a motorised wheelchair may one day get their independence, thanks to a system that lets them steer a wheelchair using only their thoughts. Unlike previous thought-communication devices, the system does not use surgical implants. Instead a skullcap peppered with electrodes monitors the electrical activity of its wearer's brain. Early trials using a steerable robot indicate that with just two days training it is as easy to control the robot with the human mind as it is manually. At the moment the system controls a simple wheeled robot. The user dons the electrode-lined skullcap, which monitors electrical activity on the surface of the head. A web of wires sends the information to a computer. Milln's software then analyses the brain's activity and, using a wireless link, passes on any commands it spots to the robot. At the moment the user can choose between three different commands: for example, "turn left", "turn right" and "move forward"....

 Apologies for any intermittent strangeness affecting this blog over the last couple of days, and for that matter over the next couple of days too. My hosting company replaced the server with a two week old backup yesterday, which wrecked the template once I republished the site - the backup didn't have the stylesheets and scripts that the new template uses. When they switch back, there's likely to be some posts going missing again until I republish. This has come at precisely the point at which I had decided to try installing MT on my site (again). The providers have assured me that all will be well if I let them know which folders to copy over to the server when they swap back, but I am skeptical ( - you noticed?). So, I think I'll just leave it until next week, when the dust settles...

 Happy coincidence: I switched on BBC Radio 4 this morning at about ten to eleven. At eleven o'clock: "Here's sound recordist Chris Watson with the second of two programmes, going in search of urlLink A Small Slice of Tranquillity . It so happens that Chris Watson participated by phone link with a presentation by my old friend Jon Wozencroft of urlLink Touch , at the Lux Cinema in Hoxton Square, concerning "non-musical" sounds, as I recall. When question time came around, I asked Chris if he could describe the closest conditions he had experienced to Total Silence. Sounds like the discussion bore some kind of fruit...

 Okay, the template appears to be installed, after all. Something a bit odd happened last night as I was, or thought I was, uploading the new template to the server. Everything fine and doodly at this end. Up go the scripts, stylesheets, images. Into Blogger, the template goes in, the changes are saved, and publish. Publish successful. We have a look, and we tweak a couple of tweaks, republish the offending scripts and there you go. Except that some of the images aren't loading. I check the code. I am considering publishing a test image, I'm putting up the latest tweak, and I publish. Publish error. We have another look, and when the page finally loads, it is as if none of this work has been done. Even the posts I've made are not showing any longer. The server then shut up shop knocking back connections through Blogger, and directly by FTP. This morning, however, all is well. There was no sign of the files I'd uploaded last night, so I put them up again, and here we are. I assume that I was switched onto a backup server in the middle of my upload, which was a bit trippy. So, comments on the new template. Regarding functionality, rather than aesthetics. Are the dropdown items working as they ought? They ought to be closed when the page loads, and expand when clicked, contract when clicked again. Are any of the text blocks overlapping each other? This is bad, and if it is happening, you're hardly likely to have read this far into the post, so hey, we'll probably never know. You would think that I, as a professional DHTML coder, would check my template on a PC browser or two before unleashing it on the world, wouldn't you? Oh no. Oh no no no....

 You know that template makeover I made a stab at last month? I think this is more the kind of thing I was groping for, but a week off work pays handsome dividends. As is traditional at these times, it remains for me to solicit comments from members of the PC-browsing persuasion, regarding the stability of this new whistle (hmm can you think of a usable rhyming slang for 'template'?). First through the gate with reassuring "it all looks fabulous, where's my lolly?" comment gets a lolly. Terms, and indeed Conditions apply.

 Today I've had more new toys landed in my lap than I've had on any given Xmas in at least the last ten years. By happy coincidence, orders for a urlLink new printer , memory card for the camera, the urlLink O'Reilly DHTML Definitive Reference all arrived on the day that I came home with a new urlLink MiniDisc recorder , and six, mostly science fiction books picked up from the strange anti-vivisection antique shop I mentioned a few months ago. I do realise that I haven't actually posted any pictures to speak of, yet. But it'll be coming! I've just about sorted out the slideshow stuff - PC users of sufficiently evolved calibre will even see the little beggars fade into each other (which I presently can't on the Mac - which is very odd, because I could have sworn I saw a filter fader working, at some point, in either IE or Mozilla, and now neither of the current versions want to do it at all. Maybe I dreamed it.) Also, of course, I can now pick from about 500 recent pictures, which is a large enough sample that even a trembly-handed buffoon such as Yr Humble Svt. can make a reasonable showing. Someone long ago quoted to me from the sayings of some exemplary photographic master who may or may not have been Cartier-Bresson, that anyone who takes thousands of pictures over a long period of time is just bound to get a few good ones along the way. After that, its just a matter of noticing them ...

 You see, George, it's not the lying and the doctoring of intelligence that has me all upset. It's that you've had control of Iraq for over two months now and you couldn't even find the time to plant just a few nukes or vats of nerve gas and at least make it look like you weren't lying to us. You see, by not faking some evidence of weapons of mass destruction, it shows that you thought no one would mind if it turned out you made everything up. A different kind of president, who believes that the American public would be outraged if they ever found out the truth, would go to great lengths to cover up his subterfuge.

 Yes, nexistepas.com, and consequently this blog, is back on its wobbly pins again. I won't bore you with all the lurid details, but essentially my previous hosting company couldn't be bothered to sort out the renewal of the domain, as they had promised to do back in July when I first raised the point with them. It turns out that when I asked them if they had the domain renewal scheduled, and they said yes, they hadn't even understood the question. Leave it to us, they said, and you see what happened. Domain falls off the map of the world... and then they took five whole days *after* I'd given up on them, renewed the domain myself and taken it elsewhere, before they even looked at it and noticed, hey, he's taken his business to another company... Sigh... So anyway, the blog is back up, but I"m pretty sure that most of the images are broken in the archives - I haven't even gone there yet - so that will need some looking at... soon, soon...

 Ominous rumblings, in the most literal sense, from Yellowstone... "The impact of a Yellowstone eruption is terrifying to comprehend." says Professor McGuire. "Magma would be flung 50 kilometres into the atmosphere. Within a thousand kilometres virtually all life would be killed by falling ash, lava flows and the sheer explosive force of the eruption. One thousand cubic kilometres of lava would pour out of the volcano, enough to coat the whole of the USA with a layer 5 inches thick.

What makes this particularly interesting to me is that only a couple of weeks ago, I was called by the company who furnished me with my mobile, and they said, how are you getting along with your phone. Since you ask, I said, it's been playing up a bit lately. Want a new one? they asked. Sure, I said, and the very next day, there it was, a new Sony-Ericsson T68i - the very model, dear readers, which Joe Kissell has employed in his review.

 As the second day of trawling through the blogrolls approaches its end, I've reached the bottom of the second 'roll ("furthermore..."). I've visited sites I haven't looked at in almost a year, some of which turn out no longer to exist, but happily there haven't been too many of those. Nearly everyone's redesigned to some extent, though. In the course of my travels, I've added but one address to the 'rolls: urlLink also not found in nature , which inclines towards hard news, and excited a permanent link for the commendable observation - on Blair's determination to infest the UK with GM crops regardless of the dangers - that "the only surprise here is that there are still officials in Whitehall who believe Blair works for the British government ...". Well said, that blogger.

 Rummaging back through recent referrals now - someone got here by running "essay-if you would have 10$ to plane day's adventure, where would you go,what would you" through Yahoo search.

Whatever that might involve....

 Spent most of the day going through the blogrolls. I'm pretty sure that I haven't visited some of the addresses in there for the best part of a year. A few of them weren't even there anymore, and now they're deleted. Othershave been moved up or down the lists - last time I did this, everthing in the top 'roll was blogs with whom I was reciprocally linked, at least at the time. I've fallen off a few 'rolls since then - on account of not keeping it up, no doubt. Now it's partly reciprocal, partly blogs that really ought to be visited more often than I've been doing lately...

 In case anyone's interested, almost all of the image tags in the archives are fixed, going back to the beginning of July 2002. Which leaves three or four months, and a few other bits and pieces still to fix...

 This afternoon I have noticed at least two things. First thing: urlLink William Gibson has ceased blogging , over a month ago, persuaded that trying to write a novel while blogging would be like trying to boil a kettle whose lid was left off (I'd be interested to know what urlLink Charlie Stross would say about this). So he's gone back to his day job. The second thing I noticed (stumbled over it while reading the last month's archive of Gibson's blog) is that it is possible to download the urlLink Babelizer as a stand-somewhat-alone OS X app. So I did, and I gave it my previous post, ran it through all the available languages, thus: The transport and the eye of the prices of the exchange, if with this same something Seins is qualified side, are consideravelmente near, but of Yoo, where this fact a private individual for measurement, which however the moment decides thus that it is him that you withdrew the adze ' and in the love of the place of the punnery, it, vorbehaltlichen an additional tiny room by additional additional of the methodologische of the additional material of water it, this 1, this for the cause of this of insufficient, is, for which they it folded those is, aechzt, it comes from the white woman of the woman who increases you with him if, for the respect?

 Heh. I just noticed that I missed enthusiasm's second birthday, which would have been, hmmm, last wednesday. You'd think I'd have something like that in my diary, wouldn't you?

 I wandered down to Tower Bridge a couple of lunchtimes ago, and milled with the throng beneath Blaine's box for a while, munching thoughtfully on my sandwiches. Blaine rolled onto his side. People waved. Blaine waved. What's he doing in there? Every possible means has been laid on to confirm what Blaine isn't doing: food, escape, standing up; but all we're getting out of it is the curious, continuing fact of a man lying in a box, waving every now and then. Where's the rest of the output? Where are the mutterings under the breath? Where are the the delirious ravings? In The Past&trade;, urlLink people did this kind of thing to themselves in the hope of seeing God. Will we be able to hear about it, live as it happens, if and when Blaine sees God?

 I've found some time to explore the growing mountains of list mail piling up in my mail client, amongst which was a pointer to a wiki project annotating Neal Stephenson's new book, Quicksilver. I haven't read the book, haven't bought it yet, and to be honest my estimation of Stephenson's work peaked with The Diamond Age - but I do enjoy his explanations, and his urlLink explanation of the Metaweb as an explanation system is one such. A site to keep an eye on.

 Benjamin Zephaniah's OBE urlLink rejection letter . There's something very strange about receiving a letter from Tony Blair's office asking me if I want to accept this award. In the past couple of months I've been on Blair's doorstep a few times. I have begged him to come out and meet me; I have been longing for a conversation with him, but he won't come out, and now here he is asking me to meet him at the palace! I was there with a million people on February 15, and the last time I was there was just a couple of weeks ago. My cousin, Michael Powell, was arrested and taken to Thornhill Road police station in Birmingham where he died. Now, I know how he died. The whole of Birmingham knows how he died, but in order to get this article published and to be politically (or journalistically) correct, I have to say that he died in suspicious circumstances. The police will not give us any answers. We have not seen or heard anything of all the reports and investigations we were told were going to take place. Now, all that my family can do is join with all the other families who have lost members while in custody because no one in power is listening to us. Come on Mr Blair, I'll meet you anytime. Let's talk about your Home Office, let's talk about being tough on crime.

 I thought I'd test a notion I'd cultivated, that the phrase, "following a disagreement with Andre Breton" must be among the commonest in writing about 20th century art, but it seems not. I thought I'd get a couple of dozen results for this, at minimum, but it returned none at all. urlLink Google Search: "argument with Andre Breton" , however, gave a urlLink single link - still kind of disappointing, in a way, but then isn't a single result the desired outcome for the curious sport of Googlewhacking?

 This is kind of interesting, thunk I to myself, when I found the urlLink ITMS Link Maker - whatcha do is, you enter song titles, album titles and/or recording artistes and the page returns an HTML link to the object of your search, so that folks can follow you into the iTunes music store and hear a sample what you're blethering on about. And buy it from the Music Store, if they're daft. Otherwise, they can whizz off somewhere else and pick up the actual CD. What it doesn't do is link to the more interesting, feature aspect of the store, so I am unable to link, for example, to Michael Stipe's celebrity playlist, which I might vaguely have wanted to do. 99 cents doesn't sound like a lot to pay for a tune, if you say it quickly. Then you see that you can buy, say, all of the tracks from Stipe's playlist, and that will set you back more than $30 - which is a hell of a price, really. Should be able to get some kind of quantity discount, at the very least...

 urlLink JavaScript version of Conway's Life program - I'll be studying the source code of this one rather closely. I suspect that if I can get my head around the coding of this one, it'll push me on a step or three in my desultory accumulation of Javascript chops. (via urlLink leuschke - haven't figured out handling links to GL's short links, or if this is even possible)

 urlLink Here it is then, the first scripted slideshow. It's very bare right now, there's no pausing or navigating, but what I've got so far will loop x number of images as long as required - and the window is resizable if that is your wish. Please let me know if this doesn't work on your platform/browser. More features in forthcoming featured presentations, no doubt...

 urlLink Follow Me Here turned four years old on Saturday.

 urlLink Happy birthday, sir! (portrait by urlLink Brigid Marlin )

 Simple idea, drippy, colorful forms, figures in landscape. Very appealing. (via everlasting blort)

 Point well made. It's a little corny, but it moved me to click on the What Now Button at the end. Flash content. (via gordon coale)

 Jeneane Sessum makes urlLink further reflections on meeting bloggers in person , amongst which: I sometimes giggle when I see bloggers handling money.

 Joseph Duemer had himself urlLink a frank exchange of views with a comment spammer. Most amusing...!

 Okay, so I just installed urlLink KungTunes yesterday. This is a little app that notes down the most recent tracks played here in my iTunes. Imagine iTunes as Doctor Johnson, and KungTunes as Boswell - except that since KT will only remember up to 50 tunes at this point, we also have to imagine Boswell with severe short term memory loss. Imagine Boswell as a goldfish, perhaps. A very interesting goldfish. There are all sorts of attractive possibilities suggested my this app - the information in the list itself can be hyperlinked to, well, whatever. I'm intrigued by the thought of a comments facility on the page - perhaps an ongoing, Kids from High Fidelity kind of deal. But that's for later. Here's a rough version of my urlLink play list . It won't necessarily stay at that address for long, but if it doesn't, there will be permanent and prominent linkage

 urlLink Neil Gaiman has the skinny on Those Royal Denials In Full. I'd have to paste the thing in full, which would be shabby, or else simply urge you to go over and read it, and brighten up your day.

 For the first time in months (and months and months), there is a new permalink to this blog. Hello urlLink Private Gravity , by Jimmy Kent in California somewhere, I think. Featuring a PK Dick quote for its epigram: "Giving me a new idea is like handing a cretin a gun, but I do thank you anyhow, bang bang."

 "According to a growing number of international legal experts [...] if the next Iraqi government decides it doesn't want to be a wholly owned subsidiary of Bechtel and Halliburton, it will have powerful legal grounds to renationalise assets that were privatised under CPA edicts [...] The only way out for the administration is to make sure that Iraq's next government is anything but sovereign. It must be pliant enough to ratify the CPA's illegal laws, which will then be celebrated as the happy marriage of free markets and free people. Once that happens, it will be too late: the contracts will be locked in, the deals done and the occupation of Iraq permanent."

 Plep is travelling in Nepal, and blogging at urlLink NePlep ...

 urlLink Eric S. Raymond proposes urlLink The glider: an Appropriate Hacker Emblem and has recently updated his document, urlLink How To Become A Hacker . The emblem, derived from Conway's Game of Life, makes a lot of sense - which is more than can be said for a lot of emblems.

 urlLink Some great pictures here of a blogmeet in northern Tehran. There is apparently a urlLink Cafe Blog in those parts, set up and frequented by local bloggers. (I hope the Cafe Blog page looks as beautiful in your browser window as it does in mine - your font-rendering may vary). Anyway, is this the physical world's first and only permanent structure dedicated to blogging? Or what? (via BoingBoing, via...)

 urlLink This isn't the guy who won. This is someone else. But there's lots more.

 It isn't every day I discover a new compression format. Rather bemused, when downloading some bits of Pearl Jam's appearance at the Bridge School concert, to discover the finished article was a folder (styled .shnf) containing a number of .shn files, which as I say, are a new one on me. A little research later, it turns out that .shn denoted a Shortened file. Shorten is briefly described urlLink here - it emerges from a Cambridge outfit called urlLink SoftSound , and there is a lengthier and more helpful description, at least for Mac users, urlLink here . Shortening reduces WAV file size by about 50%, but is claimed to be lossless, and so it is gaining favour amongst audiophile swappers. So I downloaded a copy of Shorten for Mac (from urlLink here ), and showed it the scary .shn files, and it spat out a string of WAVs, which are playing just beautifully in iTunes as I type. Of course I will now be converting them to MP3, and thus irretrievably blowing whatever audiophile cred I may have been building up here, but there you are...

 They say that everything is accelerating, but the more new years that go by, the harder it is to tell the difference. Nevertheless, Happy new year to you and yrz. I hope 2004 turns out better than it threatens to be...

 urlLink The Balvenie 12-year-old Double Wood in the house. Rich, dark and chocolatey. Not for the first time, I wish I could scan and upload an aroma. The site is rather nice, if a little fussy, although I've noticed that although the text on the site, and for that matter on the helpful leaflet included in the bottle's packaging, is really rather small, it didn't have me groping for my reading specs. Not too impressed by their insistence on collecting an email address before they'll let you see anything but marketing fluff, though...

 I don't think I ever knew, until I read in his urlLink biography just now, that before inventing the Daleks, Terry Nation had been a scriptwriter for "Terry Scott, Eric Sykes, Harry Worth, Frankie Howerd and Doris and Elsie Waters", among others, and would go on to haunt the final series of The Avengers, in the capacity of script editor. Which kind of puts them - the Daleks, I mean - into a rather less-than-fearsome context...

 One of the sites I was working on this time last year, the BFI's urlLink screenonline has gone live, at last. Happily, it still looks pretty much the way I coded it, so there's a new item for my CV page, whenever I get around to putting that back up. The first crop of features includes a piece on urlLink Oliver Postgate's Smallfilms , known to long term readers as one of enthusiasm's household gods. It seems that access to audio and video clips on this site, however, is for registered users only, and registration is limited to schools, colleges and libraries. Bummer. The sister site, luxonline, which I coded in parallel with this one, has yet to launch. What can they be doing with it? The front end was finished back in February...

 Also from Eliot, this urlLink article tells of Carmelite nuns agreeing to have their brains scanned while they attempt to recall the feeling on unio mystica in search of the neurophysiological seat of religious experience. A rather too-cute neologism has been coined for the line of enquiry this project represents: neurotheology - but the piece is interessting enough to overlook that. (Globe and Mail, via FMH)

 Eliot Gelwan makes exactly the urlLink tribute post that I would have done, or so I like to imagine.

 Any further typographical peculiarities are merely slackness on my part. I say, merely ...

 I'm (mostly) back. There was this glass of port, you see, that Someone had placed between me and the keyboard, while T was engrossed in something down to my right somewhere, and I turned back to the keyboard, and over went the drink. In seventeen years of messiing about with computers, this is the first time I've sloshed the keyboard, full on, with a glass of liquid. Since it was port, it was no good just waiting for it to dry and hoping for the best (sticky, sticky, for all eternity), so I unplugged it, ran it under the tap pretty thoroughly, and dried it off. Yesterday i managed to coax just enough of a response from the keyboard to log into the machine, but after that, nothing sensible could be done. What you see below is a scan of a sticky note, which was about all I could do using only the mouse to operate the machine. Then the keyboard went back into the airing cupboard for another 24 hours, and went off to explore Life without The Screen. Today, all but the south-western corner of the keyboard seems to be fully recovered - neither of the Command keys is working, nothing happens when I hit the z or the x which I'm selecting from the character palette, in case you were wondering (good thing Samuel Morse didn't put the e down there, eh?). When I finish up here tonight, The keyboard's going back in the airing cupboard again. Hopefully I'll have my remaning keys restored to me by tomorrow, or I'll have to go buy a new one after all. Can't go for long without the command key (equivalent of the PC's ctrl key - imagine living without that sucker, if you will).



 Some confusion and controversy at urlLink nettime over a piece by Wayne Madsen at Counterpunch, urlLink Wag the Turkey which claims that the WMPC's hit-and-run Thanksgiving Dinner in Baghdad took place at 6am local time. This contradicts urlLink other sources , which have Air Force One landing "after sunset", around 5.30pm. At the time of this posting, no correction has appeared on the CP site. Madsen gives no source for his information, but if he's sticking to his story, he ought to. As Kurt Ralske points out in the urlLink nettime thread : This raises an interesting question: how does one decide what the threshold of credibility is for a non-mainstream source of information? -- By the quality of the writing? By the popularity of the source? By the degree of intersection with one's own politics? By the quality of the web design?

 ... can it mean when you become a more prolific commenter on the blogs of others than a poster to yr own thang?

 7th March 1937 - 22nd February 2004 My mum passed away early on Sunday morning, after suffering a heart attack, out of the blue, on Friday morning. The ambulance team got her into resuscitation within 30mins of the attack, and at first there was little serious concern. It was thought that she'd be in hospital for a week or so, then home for rest. By Saturday morning, the hospital were making radically different prognosis, and my three brothers and I converged on Liverpool. Happily, we all made it in time to see her, and more to the point, for her to see us. She slipped away peacefully at around dawn on Sunday. I am still groping for words, but I know the words will eventually come.

 Okay, so you have a Torrent on the go, and you have a squint at it to see how it's coming along, and you find that there's so many KBs coming down, and so many KBs going up - but then you notice that your Torrent session is connected to... one, count 'em, peers. Wha? If this peer has more of the file than I do, then juice should be coming down to me, otherwise it should be going up from me to them. Oo-or have I misunderstood something? Wouldn't be the first time, of course...

 Insofar as you can have a good funeral, my mum had an excellent funeral. The turnout was gobsmacking: there must have been nearly two hundred people, many I had not seen in at least twenty five years. I think I'll be writing more about this, but perhaps not here. In any case, onward and upward.

 nexistepas must move to another host by the end of the month; I'm hoping I can get the whole process done by the end of this week, but if I don't, enthusiasm will be disappearing for a short time. Please talk amongst yourselves and see you in a bit...

 Picked up from Euen Semple: 1. Grab the nearest book. 2. Open the book to page 23. 3. Find the fifth sentence. 4. Post the text of the sentence in your journal along with these instructions. Thus: Johnny Seven Moons went to the open door, inhaled deeply, and started stripping off his clothes. (Jim Dodge, Stone Junction)

 I'll be wandering along to the massive blogmeet at the International Bar, at the bottom of St Martin's Lane, this evening. See you there?

 That makes two consecutive daily posts. And this makes three. I don't want to even think about how long it's been since that happened. Next thing you know, I'll be actually linking to something...

 I came, I chattered (a bit), I left. While it was great to see those bloggers I already knew, and a couple or three new ones, I really didn't care for the venue. No windows, for one thing. A crowded, noisy basement with a cubby hole through which they sold wildly overpriced drinks (4.50 for a half pint bottle of Grolsch - excuse me?). Then again, I got to meet Euen Semple, and confirm a strange occurrence. A week or two ago, I'd been walking through town somewhere - wish I could remember where exactly this was - and a tall, grey-haired chap strode past. 'That,' I thought to myself, 'is Euen Semple'. I don't know how I knew this, as far as I remember I'd only ever seen a thumbnail-sized headshot picture of him, but I was quite convinced of it. Anyway, there he was, large as life, and definitely the person I passed in the street the other day. Spooky, eh?

 urlLink BBC NEWS | Health : "Until recently it was thought that smiling did not start until six weeks after birth."

 was that I'd been unable to post for about a week, some configuration tweakage did the business, and here we are again. During the course of my fiddling in the guts of Blogger, I changed over to a regulation issue template, to see if that made a difference to the publishing problem. It didn't, but I'd forgotten to switch it back. In any case, this template contains all the built-in comments code and the other new blogger stuff that needed to be incorporated anyway, so it's all going into the new site design, and that'll be finished, oooh, any time now.

 and sporting an off-the-peg template, until I can roll up my sleeves and finish the new template. Oh yes, of course there's going to be a new template... Can't do it this evening, though: I'm off into town in a minute for the opening of Janette Beckmann's photos of britrockers at urlLink Proud Galleries .

 this is a message from the void. I've been deprived of net access at home since last tuesday - thanks a bunch, BT customer services - and I'm likely to remain so until somewhere in the region of next weekend. Maybe by then I will feel a bit more like writing than I have done lately. There's a new template pretty much done, so when I do get back online, this page will be a good deal more presentable than it is at the moment. You never know, maybe I can find the time to mark up some of the other pages that used to live here, and put them back up, too. It's not as if the delights of the network will be distracting me at all for the next few days...
