 Photo of the Day for March 11, 2004 -- Balancing Act urlLink Photographer: Franziska Lang Comments: At first I tried to position the camera to get full separation between Woody and his shadow but then I realized he was probably holding on for support to be able to balance on my wobbly table :) Image was slightly cropped, toned, auto-processed, clarify applied (this gives it that hint of a halo around Woody and his shadow), then resized and USM applied. Camera used: Nikon D100 Geo. location: Virginia Judge's comments: Lovely executed shot with the shadow touching Woody. I really like the idea. It almost seems as if the shadow runs away! Maybe a very small tilt so that the line of the table is straight? It is not disturbing at all, I just noticed. Congrats!

Photo taken March 23, 2004 using my Canon EOS 10d, which was beautifully repaired by the nice folks at the Canon Service Center in New Jersey!

 Photo of the Day for April 4, 2004 -- Spring on Van Pelt Street urlLink Photographer: Robert Mann Comments: Did I ever tell you that Van Pelt Street is lined with Lingham Cherry Trees in Spring? Guess I forgot. Well it is and it accentuates the street rather nicely, I think. Shame the blossom last to short a time but I was fortunate enough to get it this past week. The sky was buildings in the distance that seem to crowd the little street in, so it was replaced. I removed an air conditioner from one of the windows as well. The entire image was processed normally and then given a slight buzz simplifier no. 1. Camera used: Fuji Fine Pix S602Z Geo. location: Philadelphia, PA Judge's comments: Lovely shot, with nice colors. I bet the original was good as well, but the post processing makes it almost a painting.

I like the lines of the shadow. It is not 'just' a shadow but really adds to the picture.

 Photo of the Day for May 6, 2004 -- 18th Street North urlLink Photographer: Robert Mann Comments: I wanted to take a shot that has both the Arch Street Presbyterian Church and the Cathedral of Sts. Peter and Paul in it.....they both have great domes and the only possbile shot is lacking of one or the other. I did manage to take this one that shows the front facades of each up 18th St. The cathedral is the further of the two. I also like this one because of the many architectural styles running through the image. In the original image a power line was running along the fronts of all the buildings up to the catherdral...it and the several street lights from which it was hung were removed from the final image.

 Photo of the Day for May 29, 2004 -- Clasped urlLink Photographer: Gerda Grice Comments: Our Harbourfront in Toronto is currently undergoing a major renovation, so there isn't very much of interest to see and shoot there for the time being--except, of course, for the water fowl and the boats and mooring things.

You let that oly rock Robert! Congrats!

 Photo of the Day for May 25, 2004 -- Daisy Delight urlLink Photographer: Franziska Lang Comments: Shot with very shallow DOF to "lift out" the top flower from the rest of the photo. First I edited out the stem of the flower lying on the ground, then did some slight curve adjustments. Since the image was fairly monochrome I then converted to grayscale and toned with a warm orange. Next, resized, applied USM and then loosely selected the top flower, inverted selection and applied a soft focus filter to the remainder of the image. Camera used: Nikon D100 Geo. location: Virginia Judge's comments: Lovely image, great idea and well executed. I like the fact that the flower is completely sharp, and not only a part. Well done, congratulations!

 Photo of the Day for June 5, 2004 -- Off With Their Heads urlLink Photographer: Jim Carper Comments: Something about the look of this Great Egret put me in the mind of the Queen of Hearts. Photo taken April 28, 2004 at the Alligator Farm with my Canon 100-400mm lens attached to the 10d. Digital camera: Canon EOS 10d Geo. location: St. Augustine, Florida Judge's comments: What I like in this image is the great composition with the elegant head and neck on the right of the image, and the wonderfull feathers of this egret on the left. And ofcourse the details of the feathers of this bird. I think it is a great bird portrait. Keeps your eye moving within the image from the head towards the rest of the bird on the left. Congrats Jim.

 Photo of the Day for June 4, 2004 -- Hocus-Pocus urlLink Photographer: Blake Heminger Comments: A rose called "Hocus-Pocus" Digital camera: Nikon CP5700 Geo. location: Foster City, Ca Judge's comments: There are a lot of 'color' nuances in this black and white shot, which gives the image a lot of depth, almost 3 dimensional. The detail in the petals is extraordinary. Congrats Blake.

 Photo of the Day for June 3, 2004 -- Distorted Reflections of City Hall urlLink Photographer: Robert Mann Comments: Been shooting with the new camera all week and got this yesterday. The zoom gave the ability get this better than I have been able to prior cause I could get a better angle on the distortions from farther away. The image is reflections of City Hall tower in the face of the PNC Bank building. ( f/ 3.5, 1/800 sec., ISO-100 ( and I can pick 50 & 100 ISO now! YEAH!) manual setting, hand held, 04:26 PM) Digital camera: Olympus C750 Geo. location: Philadelphia, PA Judge's comments: I really like this image. The reflection of the clock is great, gives you something to wonder because the clock does not indicate 4.26 as time of shooting :-) The different reflection on the left side and right side is very well spotted. Because let's not forget.... something needs to be spotted first before a shot can be taken. And it is always easy to discuss a picture after that very moment. Anyway, I think this is an excellent reflection shot, bright and very clear and with enough to see. The lines of the building take your eye right through the image. Well done!

 Photo of the Day for June 2, 2004 -- Descending Through Clouds urlLink Photographer: Gerda Grice Comments: A district in the east end of Toronto is called The Beaches. The name applies to the whole area, which is home to some trendy but very nice restaurants, as well as lots of interesting homes--and, of course, a long stretch of beach at the lakefront. Yesterday, we went for a phototaking walk on the beach (neither of us swims, and it was much too cold for swimming, anyway), and enjoyed watching the water and the families with kids and dogs. I also got fascinated by this kite that a young boy was in the process of bringing back down and took several shots of it. This is my favourite of them. Digital camera: Minolta DiMage A1 aperture priority; ISO 100; f/6.3, ss 1/800 Geo. location: The Beaches, Toronto Judge's comments: Lovely bright and clear image. The sky came out very well. It is not always easy to shoot a colorful item against a bright sky! Well done and congrats!

And that.. is that a gull above my head? I imagine the kids giggling while they are fishing. A lovely shot... lets ME dream away anyway! Congrats.

 Photo of the Day for June 11, 2004 -- Butterfly and flowers urlLink Photographer: Jerry Santoniello Comments: This is mostly enhancements, I copied the butterfly and flower from photos and made the vase with Photo Impressions gradient fill for and interesting effect. Digital camera: Fujifilm S5000 digital camera Geo. location: Albuquerque Bio Park, Albuquerque, NM Judge's comments: What an interesting idea! I like this image a lot, it is a little mystical. Congratulations.

 Photo of the Day for June 10, 2004 -- 3 Gerbera urlLink Photographer: Robert Mann Comments: I shot this for the Three Challenge on Digital Photo Challenge and got my best finish yet. No ribbon, but a little closer. I wanted to get a vertical presentation that filled the frame, somewhat. I banded the daisy stalks together and arranged them as best I could. The lighting was from two 100w halogen bulbs on either side of the flowers. The lights were behind two translucent lite discs to cut down the harshness. A third reflective lite disc was held in front of the flowers during the shooting to even out the light. (f/ 8.0, 0.77 second, ISO-50, tripod mounted, macro mode, 09:30PM) Digital camera: Olympus C-750 UZ Geo. location: Philadelphia, PA Judge's comments: Lovely image with great detail. clarity and color!

 Photo of the Day for June 9, 2004 -- Abstract Illusion in Black and White urlLink Photographer: Gerda Grice Comments: This is a picture of a downtown office building. I've always enjoyed looking at architectural feature that looks like a jagged tear in the side of the building. I deliberately used an odd angle to take the picture from, but I didn't realize that the way the light was hitting the building would create a kind of 3-dimensional effect on the side facing me. That was a nice bonus, and when I was playing around with the image in PS, I realized that black and white could heighten the effect. Digital camera: Minolta DiMage A1, Aperture priority; ISO 100, f/3.5, ss 1/320 Geo. location: Judge's comments: Pfeew.... another image where we can really look at twice or even more! Indeed a strange effect what you captured here! The diagonal lines indeed add to the image. Congrats!

 Photo of the Day for June 8, 2004 -- Sunset with bicycle urlLink Photographer: Boris Myslovaty (Israel) Comments: Digital camera: Canon 300D+Sigma 12-24 Geo. location: Judge's comments: Lovely image, although I bet it is also nice in colors. This way we can fantasize about the colors of this sunset... orange... red? Congrats Boris.

 Photo of the Day for June 7, 2004 -- Abstracted urlLink Photographer: Kaye Grogan Comments: This is a picture of three small buildings I spotted on a putt-putt course at Smith Mountain Lake in Rocky Mount, Virginia.

Well seen and well captured this one.

 Photo of the Day for June 6, 2004 -- Not So Serious urlLink Photographer: Terry Cervi Comments: This is my niece Heather Digital camera: Canon EOS 10D Geo. location: Judge's comments: You best click the image for the larger version, since you can't see the image well on this small format. I like this portrait a lot because of the expression of the woman.

 Photo of the Day for June 18, 2004 -- Against the Wind urlLink Photographer: Cheryl Meisel Comments: A digital art image I had fun with. I used a few filters on this as I was playing with it.

I like the effect. it is very colorfull and yet pretty strong. Congrats.

 Photo of the Day for June 17, 2004 -- Grand Tetons Grand Barn urlLink Photographer: Ron Case Comments: Taken at Antelope Flats near the Grand Tetons in Wyoming. Supposedly this is one of the most photographed barns in the U.S. There were wild buffalo and antelope a couple of hundred yards to the north of here. f4.5 @ 1/1600 sec, ISO 100, Cloudy WB, aperture priority, 8:45 am 06/06/2004. Digital camera: Minolta A1 Geo. location: Wellsville Utah Judge's comments: A lovely scenic shot. Extraordinary with those mountains behind the barn.

 Photo of the Day for June 16, 2004 -- Sea of Windows urlLink Photographer: Franziska Lang Comments: A huge office building where I live. I love the curved angle the fish-eye lens gives to it. Digital camera: Pentax Optio 555 Geo. location: Virginia Judge's comments: Indeed quite an interesting shot and with this lens, the building looks really huge as if it reaches into heaven.

 Photo of the Day for June 15, 2004 -- Spreading Paint on the Bread and Butter urlLink Photographer: Gerda Grice Comments: This wasn't a planned shot. I just happened to see the painters painting this restaurant with a mural already on it when I was out walking today and, well, of course I had to shoot it! Digital camera: Minolta DiMage A1 Aperture priority, ISO 100, f/4.0, ss 1/1000 Geo. location: Judge's comments: What a lovely shot. There is quite a lot to be seen and frankly, that was what attracted me in this image.

Digital camera: Canon EOS 10d Geo. location: St. Augustine, Florida Judge's comments: What a lovely bird shot. I have never seen these before. The detail of the bird against the sky is marvellous. Congratulations.

 Photo of the Day for June 21, 2004 -- Sunny Bouquet urlLink Photographer: Robert Mann Comments: A bouquet from church. Regular processing of picture. Made two layers. One layer in smart blur edges only and then poster edges to accentuate the lines. Another layer in Buzz simplifier no.1. I get a bit hazy here....I think I reversed the layers at some point to get the effect I wanted so the smart blur was on top. Changed the blending mode to soft light and merged down. (I think). Digital camera: Olympus C-750 UZ Geo. location: Philadelphia, PA Judge's comments: This is so colorful. I really like it. The composition with the two yellow flowers is also very attractive. I like the effect, but I bet that this picture is great in the unedited form as well.

 Photo of the Day for June 20, 2004 -- Moo-set urlLink Photographer: chrissy darrah Comments: i took this photo last week in southern california as the sun was setting.. going about 75mph in the car on I 58! san francisco bound, we were crunched on time and i HAD to try.. w/ a shutter of 4000, it wasn't TOO difficult.. just had to roll the window down, hold steady, and pray for no oncoming traffic. i set my pentax ist*d digital slr to 800 ISO.

 Photo of the Day for July 3, 2004 -- Farewell, Mr. Brando urlLink Photographer: Bonnie Lackey Comments: I took a picture of a lithograph that hangs over the head of my bed. The horse head is just a section - it is a wonderful work by Guido Rosa depicting Joan of Arc upon her steed and was commissioned for a holiday card in 1926. Mr. Rosa gave this to my husband and me for a wedding gift in 1966. I used my Nikon D100, handheld, standing on the bed and angled to avoid a reflection of the flash. I have titled this "Farewell, Mr. Brando". Digital camera: Nikon D100 Geo. location: -- Judge's comments: Very fitting. Congrats on your win.

 Photo of the Day for July 1, 2004 -- Cape Meares Lighthouse 1 urlLink Photographer: Kathy Cunningham Comments: This was taken a couple of years ago with my old Sony DSC-F55. I had reason recently to "dust' it off and work it over. I cropped and did some cloning with PhotoShop to remove distracting elements. The pencil drawing effect was done with MS PictureIt and the Frame was done with PhotoImpact. The gallery I am affiliated with is featuring lighthouses in a special exhibition so this was one of the older ones I worked over recently. Digital camera: Sony DSC-F55 Geo. location: Judge's comments: Lovely image and I like the postprocessing. It fits the image and creates a nice atmosphere.

 Photo of the Day for June 30, 2004 -- Touch Of Class urlLink Photographer: Blake Heminger Comments: Digital camera: Nikon CP5700 Geo. location: Foster City, Ca Judge's comments: a Lovely rose shot again Blake! I like the colors and detail of this rose.

 Photo of the Day for June 29, 2004 -- The Warmth of Vynyl urlLink Photographer: Albert Conroy Comments: I was clearing the attic recently when I came accross some old vynyl records. I put one on the turntable and was surprised at just how warm the sound was compared to modern cds. I tried to evoke this warmth in the image. Digital camera: Olympus c-8080wz Geo. location: Judge's comments: I think you succeeded in your attempt. I like the atmosphere you created here. Unbelievable really that these turntables are almost 'antique'.... Makes me feel old.

 Photo of the Day for June 28, 2004 -- Bus Stop Abstract urlLink Photographer: Robert Mann Comments: The reflections in many of the food carts on the street corners near where I work have always fascinated me. I have shot this type of reflection shot several times using a fruit salad cart. I switched to another cart on the opposite corner this past week and got some new views in the the rear door of the cart that I liked. This is one of them. (f/ 4.0, 1/200 sec., ISO-100, hand held, 04:55 PM) Digital camera: Olympus C-750 UZ Geo. location: Philadelphia, PA Judge's comments: Lovely image with quite a lot to be seen here.

 Photo of the Day for July 10, 2004 -- Fields and Houses urlLink Photographer: Robert Mann Comments: Taken on our approach to the airport in Dublin, I guess I did not hear the announcement about the small electrics being turned off....Ooops.

(f/ 3.5, 1/125 sec., ISO-100, hand held, 07:39 AM) Digital camera: Olympus C750UZ Geo. location: Ireland Judge's comments: Great shot, I love aerial pictures like this one.

 Photo of the Day for July 9, 2004 -- Coo-Coo Bug urlLink Photographer: Fax Sinclair Comments: I had taken some pictures of these Hoverflys before but Terry Cervi's Mellow Yellow win inspired me to get up closer on these crazy insects. Didn't get a good angle on the graphic yellow and black tail (I'm a wing nut) but there is just so much going on with this little creature! How is this a survival advantage? The birds just think "Man, he's too busy to eat!" Digital camera: Nikon Coolpix 8700 Geo. location: Honaunau, Hawaii Judge's comments: Hey, I don't even like bugs, but this image is technically impressive. Very sharp and good use of DOF, also nice contrast in colors. Congrats!
