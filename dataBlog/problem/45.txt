 urlLink Three Headed Frog Found in England Frog Also Has 6 Legs Wildlife experts in Britain are stunned by the apparent discovery of a frog with three croaking heads and six legs, Local 6 News reported Friday night.

 urlLink Martha Stewart Found Guilty

 Today is urlLink Friday which means I survived my life another remarkably long week. The highlight of today has already been chosen. It will be later this evening when Jon gets off the plane and into a train back to the city. I'm looking forward to every warm snuggle. Above I linked to the Encyclopedia Britannica's definition of Friday as the sixth day of the week. If Friday is the sixth day of the week how do both Saturday and Sunday become the week's end. If it is indeed the sixth day of the week then Sunday is the first day of the week. If it's the first day how does it become part of the weekend. We should probably have Friday's off from work and show up at the office on Sunday, since according to the Encyclopedia it's the first day of the week. I think Monday should be considered the first day of the week which means most calendars should be reprinted. ( it's less religious that way, shhhhh) Talk amongst yourselves.

 Since my Oscar posting where I asked the question, "What instrument was Sting playing at the Academy Awards?", many people have been directed to my site as a result of doing an internet query worded similarly. urlLink Amanda and urlLink Adam were kind enough to answer the question for me in my comments section. Adam supplied an answer and Amanda supplied a link to a picture. Since so many people have been coming here looking for answers I am posting a picture of a Hurdy Gurdy and some descriptive copy. Link on the picture below for some more interesting pictures and to see from where I got the copy. ========================================== urlLink The hurdy-gurdy is the first stringed instrument to which the keyboard principle was applied. The French name, Viella a Roue (wheel fiddle), describes the method by which sound is produced. The bowing action of the fiddle is replaced by a wheel cranked by a handle. The outer rim of the wooden wheel is coated with resin. When the crank is spun, the wheel turns and the gut strings vibrate. Just as the bag of the bagpipe acts as a reservoir of air for continuous sound, so too the wheel makes possible continuous sound by avoiding changes of bowing. Both bagpipe and hurdy-gurdy use drones, provided in the former by reed pipes, and in the latter by strings which sound fixed pitches. Other strings tuned in unison provide notes of the scale. Tangents activated by keys press these strings at the appropriate points to produce different pitches. There is evidence of the hurdy-gurdy in Europe in the twelfth century. By the end of this century, the instruments was highly regarded. Before 1300 the instrument was often long enough to require two performers, one to crank, and one to push the keys. Single player instruments developed in the thirteenth century when the hurdy-gurdy became the ideal instrument for dance music. Musica Antiqua's hurdy-gurdy, really a four string symphonie or organistrum by Ellis, is based on a late fourteenth century Florentine marble fingure in the Vienna Leichtenstein Gallery. It has two unison chanterelles, two drones, and an interior pegbox. It is oblong in shape and has tuneable tangents and a range of two diatonic octaves with drones on g and d1. The gut strings are difficult to keep in tune when there are changes in temperature or humidity. Notice the cotton wrapped around the strings to keep the circular bow from wearing through the strings.

 Did I mention my celebrity spotting last night on my way to trivia? Last night, around 6:40, I was walking across West 3rd Street at Thompson, when who should I see but the amazing Sam Rockwell. He is such a good actor and such a nice looking man. Reason number 257 why I love New York - random celebrity spottings.

 I watched Law & Order tonight and got excited because I recognized one of the actors in the show from my day to day life. The grocer who was in the first ten minutes of the show was played by an actor I've worked with at the Helen Hayes theater. He is a character actor who has been acting for years but also runs the bar with his wife at the Helen Hayes. Their son is the head usher. That was pretty exciting. Good people. But even more exciting was the last actress that I recognized. Toward the end of the show, McCoy called a rebuttal witness, a hotel employee from New Mexico. That witness was played by the actress who plays Maria on Sesame Street. I actually thought I was watching someone I knew from day to day life. It was so amazing to see her acting. I love Law & Order. It continues to be one of my favorite shows, definitely my favorite show on network television because you get to see people on TV that you know in NYC and that's usually where they show up. Law & Order is famous for hiring tons of working and not working so much actors from the town where it's shot. However, let me clarify thatit's my favorite n0n-reality TV show on network television. Other favorites include South Park, The Dave Chappel show, The Sopranos (back on HBO this Sunday night) Six Feet Under and basically anything on The Science Channel. Of course, The Apprentice and American Idol are up high on the list too. Well, I guess the truth is out now. I'm a big geek.

 Awesome. Fun. Amazing. My favorite part was the Top Ten. We had to list the 10 states with the most crop land. So much discussion. As soon as Caren announced the room was buzzing with talk and arguments and laughs. When urlLink Caren announed the answers, people talked more. Even though my team didn't exactly win that particular round, we had so much fun listing the states we thought were right and then ordering them I couldn't even be upset. The co-host was urlLink Michael Malice . For his first round, he chose the Devil as his theme? Did you know that the antiquated name for the molusk known as the Octopus is Devil Fish? Did you know that the name of the demon that possessed Regan in the Exorcist was Bazuzu? Did you know that before their executions during the Salem Witch Trials, "witches" used to confess that the Devil's semen was ice cold? Or that the Hebrew word Satan means adversary? Very cool. Michael's visual round was identifying pictures of wives of political candidates that have lost major elections. That was challenging and fun. The audio round, that was tough. I had two people on my team that were exceptionally good at music. We had name song artists and titles of songs from 5 second snippets. Very challenging. Getting home, was the toughest part of the evening. I didn't get home until 11 even though trivia ended at 9:30. Why did it take me so long? Because the W train which is now local instead of express like it had been, was not running. Because there was no announcement I waited 45 minutes before finally getting on an R train and then meeting my N train at Lexington Avenue. Boy was I mad. At one point I even went and yelled at the toll booth clerk that the W train wasn't running. He kept arguing with me that it was. I'll never know because I got on the R train as soon as it came. I owe the MTA one angry letter.

 Due to some recent postings about skin color and humanity I thought I would share with you my favorite part about the interent and blogging. Appearance is not an issue. Fashions, looks, weight, shoes, skin color. . . not an issue. Religion, popular culture and politics are always an issue as that's generally what people write about but looks are not an issue unless someone writes about them. I never think about what somebody looks like when I'm reading what they write. I might think about what the people they write about look like but the author's. That's never a thought. That's what I like best about the internet. Readers don't care if I lose or gain weight because they can't see me and unless I tell you I'm a big fat pig or I look thin and sickly they have no way of knowing. In a way, the Internet is the great equalizer education is supposed to be in a way. More later. Gotta' go to Trivia!!!

 Today is Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday... I miss my boyfriend. (sniff).

 Jon is still in Barcelona and my wanderlust is growing. Here is tour I would very much like to go on when I have a chance to go to Barcelona. urlLink Visit one of the most important pilgrimage sites in Spain in its spectacular mountain setting, and then Gaudi and Picasso's Barcelona. Driving through picturesque little villages of the province, you come to the incomparable setting of the mountain of Montserrat, rising majestically to 1235 meters. You visit the Royal Basilica of Montserrat, which holds the famous 'Black Virgin', the Basilica has been one of the most important pilgrimage sites in Spain for hundreds of years. Attend a religious-singing performance by the "Escolania" children's chorus and enjoy free time for lunch and shopping. At 3.30pm return to Barcelona where your Modernist tour begins, with a bus tour to admire world renown architect Antonio Gaudi's works such as Morera, Casa Batllo, Casa Mila and his Sagrada Familia (Holy Family) Cathedral. You'll also make a stop to visit whimsical Guell Park and then enjoy the Picasso Museum which exhibits works from the "blue" and "pink" periods of this world-famous painter

 Basic information Location: Plaa de la Sagrada Famlia, s/n. Barcelona History : The Sagrada Famlia is the best known work of Gaud, this huge project in which he worked all his life -in fact he lives inside until his dead- was started in 1882 by the architect F. Villar i Lozano with a urlLink project in neo gothic style. Gaud undertook the work direction in 1883 changing not only the aesthetic of work, but giving to it a gigantic dimension with eighteen bell towers representing the Apostles, four towers Representing the Evangelists, one representing the Virgin Mary, and the biggest one with 170 meters high, crowned with the cross of four branches typical of Gaud, symbolizing Jesus Christ. Every window, column, element and shape referrers to saints, institutions or mysteries of catholic faith. Today surpassing 100 years from it's start, the works follow with the timing of a medieval cathedral, not really too quick !!, nevertheless the optimistic think in a end of works into the first quarter of XXI century (??). Description: At the present stage, only eight of the twelve bell towers for the Apostles are completely finished, and Gaud only built before his dead -at the age of 74, trampled by a tram in 1926- four of the apostles towers , the apse, and the Nativity faade. The gothic plant of the church is a Latin cross with five longitudinal aisles and a large apse with six chapels. An external cloister enclose the ensemble. Three faades, (two of them finished and explained below -the Birth and the Passion ones-) have the mission to illustrate in an understandable way the mystery of the birth, passion and resurrection -glory- of Jesus Christ. The polemic on the works continuation from 1952, was due to lack of original drawings, mainly destroyed during the Spanish civil war (1936-1939).

 I watched the Oscars alone. I was invited to an Oscars party, but I decided it would be better to view them alone so I could flip through the stations when the Academy Awards inevitably bored me to tears. Another benefit to watching alone is being able to fall asleep when the program invevitbably runs long. Other than some spectucular dresses, the Oscars didn't provide too many surprises. I did the like the woman who went on stage with her producer unannounced and then insisted on making a speech. I thought that was very special. Did you ever notice that the people who are awarded for shorts always have the longest f-ing speeches? (snore) What instrument was Sting playing? I've never seen that. He was winding one end while molesting the other but it didn't look like he was really playing anything. WHAT WAS THAT INSTRUMENT? Also, if the producers of the show know the program is going to run long, why don't they cut the introductions. I, for one could have gone without looking at almost naked Billy Crystal. I threw up a little during the film montage/parody thing. The tributes to actors who have passed, they are nice but if I were producing a time sensitive show I would produce them right out of there. By cutting the film montage introduction, that stupid song, and the nice but time consuming tributes to dead actors, I've already saved us an hour that could be spent letting people say thank you for receiving their well earned Oscars. And that's all I have to say about that.

 When I emerged from the subway at 28th and Broadway I was deeply engrossed in my friend's manuscript. With my nose buried deep in lose pages, I walked and read until I got to 5th and 28th when a garbage truck almost ran me over for not paying attention (my fault). It rolled up next to the curb right in front of me until I was standing face to face with the stink back of the truck. A garbage man jumped on the back of the truck and the woman waiting with me to cross the street said to him, "You have such a hard job that nobody appreciates but I want you to know that I appreciate it." The heartfelt comment put a smile on his face and mine as well.

 Here is something I overheard on the subway platform this morning. I walked by a woman who was standing right at the top of the stairs, flipping through the paper, as I came up. As I walked past her, she started yelling at the man walking next to me. standing at the top of the stairs "You could say excuse me. You hit me!!" walking away "Well, you shouldn't be standing in everyone's way!!!" still standing in everyone's way "Asshole. You hit a woman!!!!!" still walking away "SHUT UP!!!" still standing there "Come back here!!!! I'll kick your ass!!!!" almost at the end of the platform "SHUT UP!!!" I waited to see which car he got into and then I decided to wait for the next train.

 Straight from the pages of The Onion comes this serious look at a recent grant by The National Endowment of the Arts and Crafts . ================================================= urlLink NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE ARTS & CRAFTS CRITICIZED FOR FUNDING GIANT MACRAME PENIS

 This urlLink young couple got arrested after photographing their two year old smoking pot and then dropping off the photos to be developed at a local convenience store.

 It seems, urlLink young Prince William , heir to the throne of England, debuted his flesh as he made his water polo debut for the Scottish national universities squad in the annual Celtic Nations tournament against Wales and Ireland in Cardiff, Wales.

 It seems that some of our service men are coming down with an skinfection known as the Baghdad Boil. Sand flies are transferring these horrible parasites that live in their guts when they bite our soldiers about their bodies. Read about it urlLink hear . Warning. The article comes complete with a gross out photo that you can link to for more details.

 So....did you hear about this guy Rantisi? He is the Hamas leader who started screaming "Death to Israel, Death to Israel" and publicizing his plans to destroy Israel. Israel responded by killing him by fire bomb. He is the second Hamas leader to be killed in thirty days. The Palestinians are outraged (although I refuse to believe that every single Palestinian gets behind Hamas) that Israel has done this and they elected a new leader but this time in secret. You would think after the assassination of the first guy, Rantisi's advisors would have encouraged him to keep a low profile and not piss off Israel. It took two killings for Hamas to realize that Israel is trying to wipe them out. Between the suicide bombings (decreasing their own flock) and publicly condemning Israel, daring Israel to come to Gaza Strip and murder them, Hamas doesn't seem like the most clever of terrorist organizations.

 The Apprentice is over. Bill was chosen to be the apprentice. The job he won is to oversea the building of a sky scraper that will blot out the sun from the Chicago skyline. I think Kwame is the real winner. He has all the fame, will get a lot of job offers and he DOESN'T have to work for that megalomaniac Trump. Bill's salary will be $275,000 or something like that. It's just not enough money to work for Trump. I'm not sure what would be harder to take. Having to listen to how fabulous it is to be him 24 hours a day or having to listen to him pontificate about what it means to be a good business man. Harder than either of the above would be looking at his flacid face and horrible hair. The way he wears his hair is the ultimate sign of his arrogance. It looks awful, it makes him hard to look at or take seriously, you know he can afford to get it styled, yet he doesn't and if that doesn't scream of arrogance, I don't know what does. And oh yeah, on a construction site, I don't really think it's necessary to wear suits. As a matter of fact, it's just unnecessary to wear suits all the time in general. I dislike business, working for business, business to business. I have no idea at all why I enjoyed that show so much, but enjoy it I did.

 So, last night, I watched the President's press conference and you know what. He really is just such a seemingly earnest and likeable fellow (my grandmother always used the word fellow for a man who isn't Jewish). Even though he fumbled through a lot of his spontaneous answers, I got the feeling that he really believes in the actions we're taking in Iraq. While I continue to have mixed feelings about all that business (loss of life bad; preventing future acts of war against the US good) I believed he really thinks what we're doing there is just. And I was happy to see that he is willing to back up his belief. He respects the troops and repeated several times that he will give them all the support that they need. I truly hope that carries over to the times when the Iraqtion is over and the troops are home and recovering from their military adventures. While I think it is wonderful that he is making sure the troops are being well supported while overseas, it is important to remember that for many people who serve the action continues even when it's over. I know I've said this before on this website and I don't mind saying it again. Even if you don't believe in war or occupation of another country, it is important that we support the people who fight the good fight. Not only when they are in places that are not their home, but once they've come home and they need jobs, medical attention, homes, and/or psychological counselling. If people are going to spend their time protesting some aspect of war, sometimes I think it would be better if they were protesting to make sure that veterans are receiving the services they need after they return home. And that's all I have to say about that.

 Good morning. I have a confession to make. I'm not thrilled that Monday is here, but it's probably not why you think. It's not because Monday is the first day of the work week. It is because at midnight Sunday was finished and so was the most lovely Sunday I've ever spent with someone. I had the most wonderful time with Jon this weekend. We went on a historical walking tour of the lower Eastside that explored the neighborhoods a lot of Jewish immigrants moved to and lived in at the turn of the century. It was wonderful. Very educational. Due to the proximity of this neighborhood to Chinatown, it didn't take much convincing on Jon's part to get me to have lunch at Doyer's Vietnam, just about the best and cheapest place to get Vietnamese food in the city. I ordered the absolutely wonderful Lemon Grass Chicken, while Jon ordered the Setai Shrimp (spelling?). The generous portions were served family style and we dined ferociously as we were ravenous having skipped breakfast. Did I mention the to-die-for wontons we ate as appetizers and the hot banana served on a banana leaf with hot tapioca pudding? From beginning to end the meal was memorable. After that, meandering up Broadway, checking out the shops in Soho and then a restful ride back to my apartment where we competed at Scrabble. I don't know what it was about yesterday, but for some reason it was just better than any other day I've had in quite some time.

 "Yes. Who is it?" "It's the police ma'am. Please open up." "The police. Oh yes. Right away. What is it officer." "Well, Mrs. Bunny, I'm afraid we may have some bad news." The police officer pulls out urlLink this photo and shows it to Mrs. Bunny. Upon seeing it, Mrs. Bunny starts crying hard and fast, tears streaming down her face. "Do you recognize this man?" Mrs. Bunny passes out and the officers move her to a couch and bring her some water. (thanks to A at urlLink A Violently Executed Blog for providing the above link)

 Friday Five NB: The Friday Five was only late with their posting and not as I suggested, taking a hiatus due to good Friday. Either way, my questions still stand. 1) At what age did you start realizing how weird the concept of the Easter Bunny really is? 2) Were you religious as a child, meaning as a child, during your religious training (if you received this kind of training) did you attend weekly religious services? and if so at what age did you stop going? 3) Have you gone through the stage or are you going through the stage in one's life, where you are questioning the motifs and themes you learned during your religious training and what is that you are or were questioning? 4) Are you now in the stage of your life where you have come back to your religion either for personal reasons or for the sake of your children for whom you desire a similar religious upbringing? 5) Are you in a committed relationship with someone of the same faith as you or someone of a different faith and how is that going?

 Here is a urlLink transcript of Dr. Rice's testimony before the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks.

 It's about 2:40 and the day is starting to drag. I look to my friends' blogs for a quick pick me up while have this quiet moment to myself. I find some interesting links about urlLink urlLink milk bags on one friend's urlLink site . I find an article about desperate urlLink women on another friend's urlLink site . Plastic milk bags - seems silly to put milk in plastic bags when both cardboard and glass bottles are recyclable. Writing about desperate women - seems redundant. I was not surprised to read that women can have a hard time meeting men. Of course, I am talking about the links my friend's linked to and not my friends themselves. I'm just restless, is all.

 I watched a very bizarre show last night called urlLink The Swan on Fox. Do you guys remember that episode of the Twilight Zone where a woman receives plastic surgery only to find out in the end that her surgery didn't work, that she was still a gorgeous blond while everyone around her was pig faced? It was kind of like that, except the opposite. I don't know if the show is offensive or fantastic. I had such mixed feelings after watching it. On the one hand, the show is saying that to be average is not good enough. But on the other hand, they are giving people opportunities to completely change their lives for the better by giving them plastic surgery and encouraging them to workout. I cried at the reveals at the end of the show where two women who had undergone plastic surgery and three months of rigorous working out, dieting and psychological counselling (a nice benefit, I thought) saw themselves in the mirror for the first time in as much time. They looked good (of course the makeup, hair treatment and stylish dresses didn't hurt) and were practically unrecognizable from their before shots. The tears of joy they cried sent me into a fit of spilling empathetic tears through smiles. That was pretty touching. What I don't understand is how they are going to reconcile the difference between how they looked before and how they look now. More than rebuilding their self confidence in therapy, I think the focus should be on justifying not seeing your old face in the mirror anymore.

 It's somewhere in the middle of the week and I'm working under the deep fog of sleepiness. My mind is restless, sharp and alert. My eyes are half closed and burning from tiredness. My body seems to be cooperating, content for now to follow my brain on the rollercoaster ride that is to be my day. I hosted Tuesday Night Trivia last night which seemed to go well in spite of my lack of sleep. Not that I'm complaining, mind you. I've been having fun and doing great things. It's just that as I get older I find it harder and harder to operate without the appropriate amount of sleep. What that amount is, as of yet, I am not sure. Anyway, trivia went well. The winning team was Passover - The Feast of Inconvenience. It was a small crowd which was perfect for me as I find that easier to speak to than a large one and the teams were spirited but for the most part polite. Funniest team name - I can't remember. I went out with a friend afterward to get something to eat. We stayed out a little later than I should have but it was fun none the less. This morning, I'm doing some fun work, involving letter writing and RFP's and what not. So, I'm in a good place and a good frame of mind to do it, inspite of the FOG OF SLEEPINESS.

 Last night, I went to a seder at Jon's Aunt's house. It is the first time I've been to a seder outside of my own family and it was really interesting. For me, the most interesting part of family gatherings is observing how they interact and comparing those interactions with those of my own family. It's nice to see similarities in how other big families behave with each other. Probably the most enjoyable part for me was the presence of young children, the children of Jon's delightful cousins. There was a rambunctious eight year old boy, a bright and sensitive six year old and the most beautiful four year old girl I've ever seen. I was just telling Jon that that little girl would be perfect for that poster encouraging couples to propagate and advance the species. Not only did she delight us with special songs she learned for the seder, but she enraptured us with stories from her life and by singing most of the sound track to the movie Annie (with some help from her very sweet Aunt). Jon's family made me feel very welcome. There was no fuss, no special attention paid to me (which was perfect). I just seemed to blend in as if they'd known me for a long time. The seder was deep in New Jersey. Also enjoyable was the drive down. Jon and I had so much fun on the road, we were almost sorry when we reached our destination. The hardest part was perhaps waking up this morning because we arrived back in New York City so late. Getting up this morning was tough. I'm operating on four hours of sleep and about 5 cups of coffee.

 I just lost another Scrabble to Jon. Even though I made Quay on a trouble word with the Q on a double letter bringing be a total of 78 points for one turn, I still lost by 13 points. Pretty close game....... ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ West Side Story is playing on the DVD. I'm always amazed the actor that plays Tony was cast as Tony. He is so bright and cheery and optimistic, he's completely unbelievable as a gang leader or ex-gang leader and that scene in the sewing shop where Tony and Maria pretend to marry each other. Come on. . . are we to believe that any of the other Jets behave that way with their girlfriends? I don't think so. I am still of the belief that Russ Tamblyn should have been cast as Tony. He had the acting range, and that wonderful combination of vulnerability, toughness and athleticism. Actually, I think the movie would have been much stronger without Richard Beymer at all. Any of the other actors who played one of the Jets could have been moved up into the Riff role. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- At some point today, we're heading to Queens. On the way, we may stop at Macy's, maybe walk around the city a little bit (although) the weather is starting to turn sour. Tonight we're going to see my friend Triple EEE play at a bar somewhere on Sullivan Street. I'll be right back....I'm going to check the location.....here is the posting . . . .hopefully you can make it. =================================================================== SPRING FORWARD !! with Eric Everett acoustic tunes to make you stomp, giggle, drink and reflect on the Zen of pine trees and such, BUT DON'T FROGET (ribbit ribbit) to set your clocks forward so you can get there on time for EE to read your PALM 'cuz it's Palm Sunday too! Sunday, April 4 - EE's "Return to the Village" show!

 This evening, I watched another rousing episode of the Apprentice. My favorite guy got voted off - the guy with only a high school education, that learned the Art of the Deal by reading Donald Trump's book and built his own successful real estate lending business. I felt so sad for him. He, more than anybody, really, really wanted to work for Trump because Trump was is his idol. I was really, really hoping he would take it, but Mr. Trump decided that he was a little bit too reckless to run one of his companies. One of his close advisors suggested that Troy could be liablity as the CEO of one of his corporations. Good bye Troy. I'll miss your optimism and your good sportsmanship. You're a nice guy and I would like to work for you.

 Jon just got here and he brought with him one yummy calzone. He offered me some but I said no thank you until he started eating it. Before he got here, I made some yummy chicken soup which he is now eating. So, I took maybe a third bite from the half he put aside while he eats my soup. He said, "Hey! You said you didn't want any." I said, "You're eating my soup. I put my blood, sweat and tears into that soup. (BEAT) No. Not literally." He then laughed and suggested that I put this anectode on my blog which I have now done. PAUSE PAUSE PAUSE PAUSE Jon, just offered me a bite of his calzone to make up for a few minutes ago. I know. Perhaps, just a little too much of a slice of life for your taste.

 I just saw a commercial for Cialus, a new erectile dysfunction drug. The drug works for 36 hours and allows men to have spontaneous sex (I guess). After the usual list of side effects the announcer warned that erections lasting four hours or more, although rare, require hospitalization. Would that warning scare you away or make you think, WOW!! I COULD HAVE AN ERECTION THAT LASTS FOUR HOURS!!!!? I would say that it is a very effective commercial.

 Sunday, Jon and I went to the Bronx Zoo. I haven't been there in years and he's never been. We were there from noon to closing time at 5:30. We saw tigers and bears, no lions. We saw puffins and elephants and flamingos and babboons and snow leapords and lots and lots of screaming children. Every exhibit, every five minutes, a child screamed. No matter. The zoo was still fun and we rode the Skyfari, a tram that brings you from one side of the zoo to the other. Monday, today, we went to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. They are showing a special exhibit on Byzantium art. I saw pieces from as early as the early 13th century. I love Byzantium art. The exhibit was exquisite. It took at least three hours to walk through. For lunch, afterwards, Jon took me to Tang Tang, an inexpensive and fabulous Chinese restaurant on the Upper East Side, 76th St and Third Avenue to be exact. And of course on Saturday night, as promised I prepared blue fish for dinner. My order came in from Fresh Direct in 8 huge boxes. The food is beautiful. The produce, fresh. The meat, gorgeous. The blue fish is perfect. I made peppers stuffed with rice, string beans sauteed in onions and tomatoes and the blue fish...ah the blue fish. Did I mention blue fish is my favorite? It was fresh, fresh, fresh. I wrapped each filet in tin foil with a blended mixture of ginger, rice wine vinegar, fresh oregano, parsley, butter and slices of lemon and let it bake for about 1/2 an hour. It came out as I intended. I love Fresh Direct. I love living in New York and I love cooking for my boyfriend.

 During Kerry's speech today in Green Bay, Wisconsin, in a "surprising" move, the Democratic Presidential candidate came out against our President by saying that he rushed off to war with Iraq. urlLink The Reuters article failed to mention why Kerry was speaking in Green Bay. Keep in mind that I am a Kerry fan. I think he needs some better PR advice.

 There has been a lot of discussion lately about the different roles men and women play in the dating game. The discussions have been taking place at the site of, what I hope soon to be, a friend of mine, urlLink The Anonymous Blogger . Something of particular interest to me about the recent discussions has been the debate over whether or not women should be more aggressive in asking men out. I wrote about this before so if you remember that posting, posted when I first started blogging forgive me. You can skip over this altogether. If not, I'd like you to consider the following. Gen X'ers are in the interesting position of being raised between two worlds. We were generally raised by two kinds of baby boomers. The first kind of baby boomer is more traditional and transferred down old fashioned values, more than likely taught them by their immigrant or first generation American parents - in terms of families that have been here for generation upon generation, the more conservative values that existed at the beginning of the 20th century. I'm sure many of us have a grandmother who was a flapper, but when it came to family, she most likely married within her religion, race and gave it up all her shenanigans for the sake of the family. I personally fall into this category, where the dad went out and worked and the mom worked to raise the family and keep the home. Others of us were raised by the boomers who decided to rebel against established societal norms as well as societal evils. Very important. These rebels were feminists, civil rights activists, war protestors and brought a lot of attention to the fact that we need to watch our government closely. Great. But with all that, they also rebelled against traditionalism. Women were freer, they started working more outside of the home, they started attending college more. These men and women also had families but they raised them against tradition and not necessarily by it. Either they raised children as atheists, or women had kids on their own, or people started divorcing more, etc. People started changing those aspects of their worlds they didn't like and started to feel more empowered. Where does that leave us their children? Completely confused. We don't know whether to scratch our watches or wind our asses. Gender roles are completely turned around and seem to have lost all meaning. Men and women don't know which models to follow. Should we follow the traditional model which is more patriarchal, granted favoring the man, but leaving no question as to what are the gender roles. OR Should we follow the more modern approach, where it doesn't matter who does the asking - where men and women are on more equal footing; where a woman doesn't need a man to create her identity. And which type of man or woman are you or are you a modern traditionalist or a traditional modernist? And how do you find someone that matches how you? I think a lot of what we are going through now has to do with us not understanding how gender roles are changing and being caught in the middle. And I think that's why the urlLink Anonymous Blogger is probably so ambivalent (this has been changed from ambiguous). What do you think?

 Last night, I placed my first order with urlLink Fresh Direct . If you haven't heard of it, it's a wonderful service and it's finally arrived in Long Island City/Astoria. You go to their website, register, pick and choose the food you want and someone delivers to your house when you instruct. The prices were great. Some of the produce was priced better than my favorite green grocer. I'm having it delivered on Saturday between 11 and 1. I bought blue fish which I'm going to prepare for dinner on Saturday night. I'm going to wrap it in tin foil with butter, lemon, tomato, ginger and garlic and bake it in the oven. To accompany my favorite fish, I will prepare baby green beans sauteed in onion and tomato, and peppers stuffed with a melange of rice and spice. There will of course be a salad of wonderful greeness, dressed with my own, very special vinaigrette and if I'm feeling very brave I may attempt to bake something for dessert. I haven't cooked for my honey in a while and he's overdue for some good homecooking.

 The urlLink NY Times CIRCUIT section took notice of blogging yesterday. (registration required for this link) The article focuses on the somewhat obsessive nature of bloggers, siting several examples where bloggers are neglecting their work or spending upwards to 8 hours a day blogging. Often, the article says, bloggers are writing for an audience of one, themselves. The article failed to discuss the obsessive nature of tracking your blog. I must have checked my hit count 20 times already today. I don't know why. But every time the count goes up one more hit, I feel the slightest bit of satisfaction. That's probably why I do it. Adversely, if my hits don't increase, I feel eminently disappointed; as if somehow I am failing as a writer by not generating enough interest. Where's the article on that? Probably in the some psychiatry journal.

 Saturday afternoon, when Jon and I were at the street fair on Amsterdam Avenue, I encouraged Jon to visit the booth of a vendor selling goose down pillows for a good price. Before I encouraged him, I looked over the pillows, talked with the vendor and decided that the product was alright and that the vendor was a stand up guy. Jon bought two goose down pillows for $30.00 which I'm sure we would all agree is a pretty good deal. On the way home from the fair, we went into a pet shop just to look around. The salesman had a parrot on his shoulder that kept saying "How are you? How are you?" He was talking to a little boy who was just thrilled that this bird was talking to him. The little boy tried to keep the parrot talking by asking him, "What's your name?" But alas, all the parrot could say was "How are you?". We wanted to see the pets they had downstairs but that part of the store was already shutdown. We'd walked in just as they were closing. But before we left, I made sure to met the big, fat, adorable lazy cat laying on the counter. When we got back to Jon's house, we'd already walked quite a bit as I mentioned in an earlier blog. I was pretty tired so I plunked down on the bed. Jon pulled out one of his shiny new pillows and I quickly put it under my head to give it a test run. I was watching the TV when I noticed that I still smelled like the pet shop and I even asked Jon if he noticed that I still had that pet store smell on me. He didn't so I assumed that the cat was smelly and that the smell was still on my hands. I washed my hands and returned to the soft pillow. But then, the smell started getting stronger. I realized that the pillow stunk like a dirty pet store. Jon pulled out the other one and it smelled too. The pillows were bad. So I suggested we wash them as a solution. So, we went to the basement, put them in the machine and left them alone for their 30 minute wash. At the end of the cycle Jon went down to put them in the dryer and came back upset. Apparently the smell hadn't gone away. Deciding that he wanted to return them, I suggested that we dry them so he could bring them back to the crooked, sleazy vendor who sold them to us. When I went down again to pull them from the dryer and I put that first pillow to my nose, I made a loud and disgusted noise. It was so loud this other guy in there asked me if I was alright. The pillows smelled worse than before the wash. I brought them back up so Jon could repack them and research returning them. Apparently, after a couple of hours of research, Jon learned that he has no recourse. There is no agency set up to hear complaints from people who have been ripped off by street vendors and the company that runs the street fairs refused to give him the name of the vendor. Outside of going to every street fair left in New York City this summer and hunting this guy down, Jon has no recourse. What a sham, what a scam, what a shame.

 Have you heard about this guy on the Upper West Side who smashes rats as a hobby? By day, he is Manuel Rodriguez a handy man living on W. 109th street. By night, he exchanges the tools in his tool belt for his weapon of choice, a "custom carved pine plank", in order to sneak up on unsuspecting rats and smash them much to the delight of local residents. According to this urlLink Daily News article , Mr Rodriguez finds the rats by a trash cans and garbage bags piled high in front of his building on W. 109th Street and Amsterdam Avenue. His neighbors consider him a hero.

 Today, at a gathering designed to register voters, former Vice President and former Presidential candidate Al Gore gave a speech somewhere in New York. He came down hard on President Bush and his administration and eloquently expressed his anger about what he feels have been major flaws in the handling of American Foreign Policy since 9/11. If you have the patience here is the urlLink speech . It's long but Al Gore makes some good points even if his speech tastes faintly of sour grapes. I've read about half of it and am still amazed that he's not our President now. I liked Al Gore for the last election and I'm sorry it was taken . . . oops. . . .I mean he lost. Wanting to be fair, I'll try to find somebody's speech somewhere that is a little more pro-Bush and his administration and then link to it. Perhaps you can suggest something.

 We have a three day weekend coming up. =========================================== I want to go to the zoo on Sunday. Jon and I sent out about 20 invitations and so far we've had four rejections. Oh well. I guess it'll just be more zoo for us. I guess my planning was a little too last minute. =========================================== Fantasia Barrino is the first American Idol whose record I would actually buy. She's really talented and will most likely win. If she doesn't win, I will still buy her record. =========================================== The Anonymous Blogger has officially lost his mind. He thinks most women are crazy although he admits to there being acceptions. =========================================== I accepted an invitation to see Aaron Carter perform. Can someone tell me who he is? =========================================== Are you there God? It's me. Valerie.I wish my period would come already. I hate that feeling when you know it's about to start but then it doesn't. =========================================== I have an amazing boyfriend.

 So, Blogger's been acting weird. I wrote to a few friends about it. The Anonymous Blogger figured out what was wrong. In order to see your site now, you have to put in the name without the WWW. So, I sent everyone on my friend list an email regarding my change of address and AOL blocked my account because I guess one of you guys complained about SPAM. Don't do that again, guys. You know me. I wouldn't send you junk. Valerie

 After a nice bath and some self pampering I was ready for a nice evening out with my boyfriend. We went to a party up in Washington Heights (very interesting up there). The hostess had prepared clams, salmon, scallops, and other tasty snacks including both a Caeser salad and a Nicoise style salad with fresh endives and beautiful olives. The purpose of the gathering was to play a game, invented by the hostess which combines elements of $24,000 pyramid, charades and password. We played three games and finished up around 3 in the morning. Sunday morning, Jon and went bike riding in Central Park. Sunday's weather was the hottest and most humid. After the fourth hill, I was done. I was brick red, dizzy and on my way to a nice case of heat stroke. I couldn't do it. It was just too hot. Jon and I returned my bike to the rental place. We went back to his place and watched his new Kill Bill DVD (awewome!!!!) and then we headed back to Central Park where Jon showed me nature trails I never new existed. We ended up on the East Side at the top of the park and took a nice walk back to the street fair on Amsterdam Avenue. The street fair, was like all other street fairs. I'll walk through them if I happen upon them but I don't go out of my way to find them. All street fairs in New York City are exactly the same. I would rate this weekend as an 10 on a scale of 1 - 10.

 Apparently, I'm not only one who found offense in Thompson's ESPN article, which I linked to after finding it on The Drudge Report. Matt Drudge, who posted the link to this outrageous article also posted urlLink this article explaining how ESPN had to clean up his comments and included the original text which so offended earlier in the day. ===================================== According to urlLink this article , Mr. Thompson finds the recent photographs from Abu Grahaib more shocking than any atrocity recorded by the Nazis. Granted, the pictorial evidence of prisoner abuse coming out of Abu Grahaib is not pleasant and indeed shows a seedier side of life in POW facilities run by American soldiers, but in comparison to the treatment afforded Nazi prisoners before and during WWII in the camps invented for their final solution, this abusive treatement is mild at best. I'm sure there many examples even beyond what the Nazi's did, examples of atrocities committed by other countries and other leaders that far outweigh the cruelty shown by our misguided American soldiers to our prisoners of war in Iraq. Mr. Thompson's observation is misguided and a little anti patriotic if you ask me.

 Saturday. . . I did one thing during the day which took up a good part of the afternoon. I went to the nail salon for a pedicure/manicure. When I walked into Athena's, Athena asked me what I wanted, told me to pick a color and asked me to wait a few minutes. Not bad, I thought, considering how many people were being served. 10 minutes later I was taken to the back where I waited 10 more minutes for a spot in one of the wonderful, pedicure chairs. All of their chairs give massages so I promptly set my controls on compressions that moved up and down my achy back. Patricia was great. My feet were in better shape than I thought. I didn't even need the razor to slough off the dead skin, just a good scrubbing. She filed my nails, cleaned my feet, massaged my calfs and arches, and then painted my toes with the reddest polish I could find. Patricia then slipped my flip flops (thongs, zoris) on my feet and led me to the dryers where I was to wait for manicure...that was 3:50. I reset the dryer three times and still no manicure. My toe nails were completely dry. I stopped the fourth cycle, pulled my feet out and started a conversation with the woman next to me. She was getting ready for a blind date - comedy and dinner in the West Village. I gave her a few recommendations. While we were talking I noticed three people who came in for the same service as me, both the pedi and the mani were leaving, finished. I was still waiting for the manicure. By a quarter to five, I had had it. I marched up to the register where Athena grabbed my arm, trying to assure me it would be only two more minutes. I said, "I don't have all day to be here." I paid the 13 dollars for my toe job and when across the street and bought a big tuna sandwich from SUBWAY. Typical. I had to eat something because I was angry. Food as comfort. Well. After gobbling up my sandwich at home 10 minutes later, I calmed down a bit and started getting ready for my Saturday night out. . . . . . . . (to be cont'd)

 Well, I never thought I would live to see the day when Robert "Gothika" Downey Jr. would be spotted writing checks at a pizzeria in Astoria. Thanks to Vidiot sending me a link to urlLink Dick Johnson's gossip column in the NY Post, I have learned that RDJ is spending time in our neck of the woods. Apparently he's shooting a film about a guy not so many people have heard of who comes from Astoria. From Dick Johnson's lead, you'd think that RDJ had abandoned his home in the Hollywood Hills or less recently his jail cell for the more exciting and glamorous life of Astoria Hills 11101. But maybe I'm not being fair to Dick Johnson. I guess he really has left the Hollywood highlife, especially if he did it to shoot a film in one of New York City's outer boroughs. Come on Dick....give us a break!!!!

 It looks like the urlLink Ebola virus is on it's way back.

 This urlLink article begs the question, how much f-ing oil is there?

 I walked out of my house this morning and the first thing I thought was, "I can't believe that twenty minutes ago I was still sleeping." As I was walking to the subway, all I could think of was my large coffee light with half and half plus two sugars waiting for me at the corner coffee shop. While I was on the train, all I thought about whether or not Staples would be open, when I got there to buy my boss some mechanical pencils. When I was in Staples, I had the nicest conversation with the young woman behind the counter. She asked me how I was feeling. I told her, "I'm tired, I want to go home and I hate my job. How are you?" She said, "I'm pregnant." and she laughed. She was really giddy about it and told me how she was looking forward to it, although no matter what book she read she didn't feel ready. It turned my mood right around and set me up for a nice day.

 Saturday night. Ahhhhhhhhh. Tonight is the first Saturday night I'm spending alone in quite some time. Why? Well. . .tomorrow morning, my honey is riding in a big bike race to Montauk and tonight he's going to bed early in preparation. I don't mind. I've been trying to clean my house all day. I've made some progress but I keep getting distracted. First, there was the mid-July like weather. It reached almost 90 degrees today and the humidity was considerable. Of course, I needed to go outside. Then there was the availability of The House of Sand and Fog on pay per view. Having read the book earlier this year, naturally I had to watch the movie. I did manage to clean my dishes, my utensil draw (it was full of weird dried orts that fell in during some cooking travails), my oven, but then I had to see how far I could get on the next level of Corkscrew Follies, part of the Roller Coaster Tycoon extension pack. I finished the initial Tycoon game earlier this month and I'm so excited to be working on Corkscrew and building new rides and attractions. (I'm a game geek from way back). Time certainly did escape from me because now it is after 9pm and it's dark outside and the temperature has barely dropped and Lewis Black's comedy special, Black on Broadway, is coming on in about 45 minutes. Until then, I'm resolved to cleaning up my disaster of a living room, office, bedroom, dining room area (my one room outside of my bathroom and kitchen). Hopefully, tomorrow I'll be lending one of my couches to my friend and neighbor and creating more space. I'm rambling now......the thought of cleaning distracts and upsets me........but I am looking forward to the end results.

 Glory be!! Blogger has expanded their template file and I've been able to update the look of my blog. Sadly, I lost my comments so get to work people!!

 urlLink Caren wrote an interesting entry about politics as of late. I agree with her that people are hostile when it comes to their political beliefs and I also agree that it's an indication that people care. I don't necessarily agree that this development is recent. People have long been divided on the major issues such as healthcare, welfare, abortion, war, etcetera. When one lives in and around New York City, one notices that many people have a more liberal point of view regarding the major issues. I have an ex-boyfriend who used to say that any place beyond the tri-borough bridge is like the mid-west. As I get older I notice more and more how strongly people feel about their politics. Or perhaps as my friends and I mature we are more aware of what is happening in the world and what part we play in the happenings. We grow more more introspective and vocal. Our brains never stop developing. We are always finding new challenges and readjusting our views to help us fit in the worlds which we conform to and then grow out of. My friends and I are in our early to middle thirties. I think we are at a stage of development where we feel empowered as adults perhaps for the first time in our lives and wish to do something with that power either intellectually or physically.

 Here is a cute article I found by Emily Yoffe who is apparently acting as a human guinea pig for weird little experiments so her readers don't have to. In this urlLink article , she remains silent for 48 hours to see what happens.

 Wow. Thanks to series of linkages through a couple of friends' sites, I found this fantastic artist, whose work I've never before seen. His name is urlLink Mark Ryden and I believe he works out of California. Either way, check it out. It's worth it.

 Yes. I watched American Idol last night and yes. I am going to write about it. Last night, I watched as probably one of the best singers on the show was elimanated for not having enough votes. I truly don't understand how the country did not recognize LaToya London's talent. You can read about urlLink here if you want to. It was quite a show. Donna Summer performed twice, once with the contestants, once without.. She was pretty good but she can't hit the high notes like she used to. Clay Aiken sang also. I am still in shock over the level of stardom he's reaching. He is soooooooooo very average in looks and in talent. I guess people just like him. Paula Abdul was crying at the end as LaToya sang her swan song and graciously thanked everyone without shedding a tear. She's a class act and it's shame she didn't make it to the final two.

 Now that I've got my weather pixie under control, I feel I can write about something else. Do you remember in September when I wrote about living the Year of Yes? I decided around the time of the Jewish New Year that I was going to say yes to more of life's opportunities. I did it for a while, until November in fact when I decided that I was pushing it a little too far and tiring myself out. Well, it's May now, and I never quite picked it back up. I'm still in the same job (which is both good and bad), I haven't been going out all that much with the exception of my dates with Jon, I haven't been writing all that much, and I'm falling back into that quiet slump which prompted the Year of Yes in the first place. Today, I'm going to start it up again. I'm already scheduled to host Tuesday Night Trivia on the 18th and I believe that is a good place to start. The bike ride this past Sunday was also part of my resurrection. What kinds of things am I looking to do? Maybe a cool part-time job if anybody has any suggestions in the New York City area, one that could be done during the evening on site or from home. Maybe some kick boxing classes if I can raise the funds. Maybe spend more time with my nephew although my cold has been interfering with some good visiting time. I'm starting to get a little bore with myself, which I fear is making me boring to those around me. But hang in there friends. If I could pull myself out of my slump in September, I certainly can do it for the spring/summer season. Wish me luck!!

 The temperatures are up as well as the humidity. I hope today's level of moisture in the air isn't an indication of what kind of summer we are going to have because that will mean a very humid summer for the residents of New York City indeed.

 Today, in NYC we are having the first truly summer like weather outside. I just ran an errand and had trouble coming back into the office. Thoughts of the beach ran through my head, as I lolligagged my way back to my desk. Sunday was also beautiful. Jon and I rode bicycles all along the Hudson River in New York City. I've lived here a pretty long time and I was amazed to learn that there are walking and riding paths far removed from the West Side Highway traffic. I collected nice memories and a few more freckles. Yesterday, on my errand, I spotted a celebrity walking up Madison Avenue between 27th and 28th Street. It was none other than urlLink Andrew McCarthy perhaps best known for his work in such movies as urlLink Pretty in Pink and urlLink Mannequin . I've also seen him perform on Broadway in the hit show urlLink SIDEMAN which also starred urlLink Christian Slater and urlLink Edie Falco (fellow SUNY Purchase graduate)in it's different incarnations. He's quite handsome in person, moreso than on screen.

 Wow. urlLink Rumsfield is in it pretty deep .

 Yes. People seem to think the urlLink last episode of Friends was a little bit anti-climatic but isn't that how your 30's have been. When you first came to the big city in your early 20's, everything was exciting and new and the world was full of possibilities, but as you started to travel down your passionately sought after path, you started to settle down and the world stopped moving so fast. You grew up. Well, so did the fictional characters in the cast of Friends. I didn't find the ending to be anti-climatic at all. I found it true to life. People grow up, grow apart and move away. C'est la vie!!

 It seems like Howard Stern isn't the only one getting his rights trampled on. urlLink This article appeared in the NY Times and discusses how Disney is forbidding the distribution of Michael Moore film that cricizes President Bush. I'll see if I can find another source for this in case you are having trouble linking. As promised here is a urlLink link to the MSN article about the above.

 I spent this weekend chilling out and having fun. Friday night, a friend invited me to see Tony and Tina's Wedding, an interactive play that has been playing on Broadway at least 8 years that I know of. We were joined by another friend. The three of us had a blast. The most fun was watching our third friend interacting with almost every member of the cast (you know who you are). She did a great job improvising. She came prepared with a fully rounded character that she could blend into the action. Several cast members sat with us at the "reception", I think just to talk to her. It was cool. First we met at the basement of a church on 46th street to watch the "ceremony". That's where the audience first meets the cast members. We were assigned to sit with the groom's side of the family. Then after the ceremony, we walked over to the Edison Hotel for the "reception" where we served a glass of champagne, ziti and salad. There was a wedding singer with a full backup band and plenty of shenanigans (sp?). Good fun was had by all. Saturday, I chilled out watching three or four movies on the telly, changing my winter for summer clothes and then going out to see a couple of friends perform standup where Jon was to meet me later. I ran into another friend of mine and we all went out afterwards to a nice little Italian restaurant in the Village. Sadly, the evening was deflated by the commute home. All we wanted to do was take a taxi but that became a huge chore. Our first (yes, our first) taxi pulled to the side of the road half way to Astoria, claiming to be out of anti-freeze. We paid him and found another taxi, who surprisingly didn't know the way to Astoria or my house. By the time we got home we had all lost that nice feeling of having been out, kind of like that feeling after the limo ride into the city after your high school prom. Sunday....well, Sunday belonged to Jon and me. We went food shopping, I cooked, we played Scrabble, we went on the internet, we sat on my front stoop and talked to a neighbor that moved in about 5 months ago, and we watched the Sopranos. I had a nice relaxing weekend. And you? How was your weekend?

 In today's Post, there was a good article about urlLink Jacko's Junko . The headline was written by my Jon and a co-worker. In the article, the DA is about to examine fluids found in Michael's Calvin Klein underwear. NB - be sure to catch a glimpse of the tasteful yet bizarrely placed Calvin Klein ad in the middle of the article.

 urlLink Mr. Drudge speculates based on anonymous tips that Senator Hillary Clinton will most likely be chosen as Kerry's running mate. His reports site that signing up Senator Clinton would be the solution to a lot of Kerry's problems (see article). I feel that as exciting as it would be to have a woman running for the second top spot in the fall, choosing her to be his running mate will be the kiss of death for his campaign. What do you think?

 4:50 pm Either the craving for nicotine or the effort not to smoke, is giving me a big fat headache. It would be huge relief if I could just smoke. I hate quitting smoking. 3:23pm Agony. Agony. Agony. Huge craving lasting for hours. A great act of will required not to give in. I called Jon who reminded me why I am doing this. The support feels good, even if quitting does not. 8:45 am Confessions of a serial smoker: Last night, at the bar, when I was playing trivia, while my team was winning, I went out with a friend and smoked one of her cigarettes. Also, I smoked one when we were on our way out. But I am not discouraged. I have decided that today is a no smoking day as well. Day three is not going too badly. Earlier, I found that the need for a cigarette was properly quelled last night (see above confession) and I woke up feeling somewhat free of my addiction. This morning, when out of habit, I found myself thinking about buying a pack for the day, my body was not with me. Reason eventually won out because I just did not feel like spending $8.00 on another box of nails for my coffin. So, I didn't. Now I am at work and during the course of writing this between spurts of work, I find my urge comes and goes in proportion to the ebb and flow of my work. Answering two lines, while making photocopies and faxing out estimates seems to make me feel a little stressed. That happened about 20 minutes ago. Now I find myself again fighting the urge to run out, buy a pack and smoke, because again, there is a small lull before the next big rush of meaningless work. As you can imagine, I am receiving support from my friends and loved ones. I resist telling my family until I achieve at least a week of smoking sobriety.

 This is my second day of "choosing not to smoke". To say I'm quitting is way too much pressure. Today, I choose not to smoke. That seems less pressuring, no? Right now, it's hard not to. Work is a little slow and my system is screaming for one. For me not to smoke, requires me to believe that I am not naturally a smoker and these feelings of physical longing are simply something that will pass if I ignore them. I feel jittery, like pacing, like eating, like jumping, like talking incessantly. I'm in control though and I am resisting. Although sometimes it feels like resistance is futile.

 After yesterday's urlLink Farenheit post, I thought I would post something a little lighter and fluffier. Did I ever tell you guys about my little three year old imagination,the little tricks it used to play on me and how it helped me to rationalize the big, bad world around me? I'll limit this post to how it used to help cope with things that were too complicated for me to understand. For example, when I was about three years old and starting to learn how to communicate, I used to get excited by adults who were so thrilled to see me because they hadn't seen me in a while. They would always start with, "You've gotten so big. Did you grow overnight?" I used to hear that so much, I imagined growing happened overnight with the help of elves. While I was sleeping, the elves would open my head, pull out my skeleton, and replace it with a new, longer skeleton. I never remembered anything when I woke up from this experience but had a good idea that these little people were conspiring against children remaining small. With regard to my growing empathy to those around me, I used to believe that all of my dolls were alive and had feelings. It was important that none of them fell off the bed when I was sleeping otherwise their feelings would get hurt and they would get angry. With regard to what I consider an early appearance of insomnia, when I was trying to fall asleep at night, sometimes I imagined my wall disappearing altogether as it was replaced by a huge mural of imagined landscapes with a cast of cowboys and astronaut supplying the action. Do you remember your earliest thoughts about the world and how it worked?

 Here is an argument urlLink against Farenheit 9/11, written by former and beloved NYC mayor, Ed Koch. I have to admit, the urlLink more I hear about this movie, the less I want to see it. I'm no great supporter of the Bush family but if you're going to come out against them, I think you should at least urlLink get your facts straight . It doesn't sound like Mr. Moore is really presenting an accurate portrayal of his argument, rather it seems like he is taking some almost facts and manipulating them to support an agenda I don't understand, quite frankly. He seems to be motivated by money this time around. His efforts to promote this film seem above and beyond previous efforts to promote previous films. Again, not being a fan of Bush I can understand how someone can come out against him but to come out against this war so strongly and then release the movie internationally doesn't seem all that patriotic. Be against the war, be against your government but don't take it outside our borders. In other words, don't air our dirty laundry. I'm a little disappointed in you Mr. Moore.

 Does anyone remember the series "Ripley's Believe it or Not" hosted by Jack Palance? The Ripley people now have a cool urlLink website you can visit to find stories about the strange but true. Perhaps you can imagine what it was like is like for the following woman. urlLink The article I refer to comes from the BBC News World Edition online. This woman in Iran claims to have given birth to a frog. The paper that published the article claims that experts who have examined the frog says it has human characteristics. Possible explanation given is that while the woman was in dirty water somehow the larva crawled inside. The frog still has to undergo testing: But it quotes clinical biology expert Dr Aminifard as saying: "The similarities are in appearance, the shape of the fingers and the size and shape of the tongue."

 As promised, here is a photo of Vanisha Mittal, daughter of the 5th richest man in the world, at her $55 million wedding. urlLink And here is an article about it .

 or 25,475th floor The Ronald Reagan Space Station At first when I saw the headline for urlLink this article at urlLink The Drudge Report , I thought for sure it was an article about scientist Bradley C. Edwards having gone mad. But then I started reading the article and learned there are those that believe a space elevator could be ready and operating in 15 years to the tune of $10 billion. Still, I couldn't believe what I was reading was true. How could a space elevator even be remotely possible? Perhaps the urlLink Drudge Report was posting satirical articles like those written on the pages of the urlLink The Onion . So then I linked to one of the supporting links listed at the bottom of the article. This link is for the urlLink Third International Conference for the Space Elevator . If you go here, you can see notes from the conference and different articles on the different technologies that would make a space elevator possible. It's true. It is possible to build a space elevator. Even if you don't believe it can be done in 15 years, I should be able to see it's launch before I die. That's amazing.

 In an effort to save his constituents money, Governor Schwarzenegger is proposing to repeal a state law that requires animal shelters to hold stray dogs and cats for up to six days before killing them according to urlLink this article at urlLink SeattlePI.com . He suggests animals should be euthenized after three days of capitvity. Governor Schwarzenegger says that this measure would help to save local governments operating animal shelters up to $14 million. I think this is a great idea but I have a feelign that his constituents, in spite of all of California's financial problems, will not stand behind the Governor on this decision.

 For those of you who dislike breaking up a set, you may want to stop reading now. The news in entertainment this week is the Mary Kate half of the Olsen Twins has signed herself into a facility for urlLink treatment for an eating disorder . What I understand about the ailment is little. Experts say it's not about being thin, yet every one seems to become anorexic trying to get or maintain thin. Experts say it's about control. Well, Mary Kate and Ashley have a lot of control or so I've heard. My feeling is the disease is about escape. There's probably a lot of pressure on the Olsen Twins to keep succeeding and moving forward. The only way out really, without people barking at you is to get very sick. That's the only excuse some people will accept for not being busy all the time. These girls have been busy since they were 9 months old. I hope that Mary Kate is checked into a good facility, that she's getting rest and taking it easy and giving herself a break. You don't have to be on the move all the time to be succeeding. It's okay to rest. Unless you know you're checking out tomorrow, you've got years to get done what you're trying to get done. My advice to the Olsen Twins is to check out for a while. Enroll in college, go to classes, hang out with your friends. But stop working on your careers and work on protecting your sanity. This may sound condescending but I'm proud of Mary Kate for taking the time to take care of herself.

 Ki-lin A mythical being of Chinese mythology, comparable with the western unicorn. Ki-lin personifies all that is good, pure, and peaceful. It lives in paradise and only visits the world at the birth of a wise philosopher. The Ki-Lin is said to walk on earth and on water. It never drinks or eats dirty food or water. The Chinese unicorn never treads on smaller animals below its feet nor does it ever harm another living creature. The Ki-Lin is the emblem for exquisite goodness, longevity, grandeur, endless compassion and great wisdom. According to Chinese mythology, at the birth of Confucius a Ki-Lin appeared and Confucius died soon after a Ki-Lin was killed, he believed that his writings would not proceed from the omen of the death of the Unicorn. urlLink Which Chinese Mythological Being Are You? brought to you by urlLink Quizilla

 Tonight, when I got out of work, I stopped by Jon's office to bring him a cup of coffee. He works nights as a copy editor for the New York Post. It was five minutes well spent. I handed him his coffee and he gave me a hug. Then I went back to the subway. And I waited and I waited and I waited. Then my train pulled up but there were so many people waiting the train was too crowded before I even got to the door, so I didn't get on and I waited some more. Another crowd started to gather. We were all getting a little impatient when an announcement came over the loudspeaker. "Due to delays, there is an R train approaching 42nd Street." I was at 49th street so this was a good announcement. Although the R train isn't my train, this meant that a good part of the crowd would get on and there would be room for me on my own. Well, the R train came and went, right through the station without stopping. An N train came by and stopped, took in most of the crowd but even though that train was going to Astoria I decided to wait a few more minutes to see what came next. Two minutes later, a W train pulled into the station and I got on. Most of the crowd had boarded the previous train so this train was relatively empty. I sat with my eyes closed until my stop in Astoria. The end.

 Those Al Qaeda bastards urlLink beheaded Paul Johnson . Here is Paul Johnson's yearbook photo. I'm going to leave this one to the professionals to discuss. Here is the latest. urlLink Saudis Say Qaeda Chief Killed After U.S. Man Beheaded Saudi authorities said on Saturday they had killed al Qaeda leader Abdulaziz al-Muqrin and three other prominent militants after they beheaded U.S. hostage Paul Johnson. urlLink Saudi Arabia confirms death of al-Qaida leader RIYADH, June 19 (Xinhuanet) -- The Interior Ministry of Saudi Arabia said Saturday that the leader of the al-Qaida terror network in the kingdom, Abdulaziz al-Muqrin, had been killed. The ministry published photos on state television to support its claim. urlLink U.S. hostage beheaded; leader dead An Islamic extremist group in Saudi Arabia Friday beheaded Paul Johnson, the American electronics engineer whom they had kidnapped six days before. Within hours, Saudi Arabia announced that its forces had killed three of the extremists, including their leader, in a gun battle. The group, called al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, posted gory photos of Johnson's body on the Internet after the expiration of its ultimatum that the Saudi government free al-Qaida prisoners it holds.

 The urlLink Anonymous Blogger and urlLink Anonymous Bloggette are at it again. Anonymous Bloggette, yesterday, made the point that if women have it so much easier than men when it comes to dating there wouldn't be so many reality based TV shows where 50 women are competing for one man, that the show Average Joe and Average Joe 2 would never feature an Average Jane. Anonymous Blogger, today, makes the point that TV Producers are mostly male and suggested that programming is sex related for the benefit of making money. He challenges women to produce their own reality shows. He said that a program like the Swan is awful because it emphasizes outer beauty. I thought it was great!! It was honest. Ugly or average looking women do not fare as well in American Society as their better than average and great looking sisters. The Swan offered people a chance to succeed in a society where looks matter. Well, T.A.Blogger may not be aware of this, but I think he helped the Bloggette make some kind of point, but on an even bigger scale than either of them realize. Men just have it easier in this world. Period. Granted nothing is easy and 99% of us work hard for what we have as a whole but men still have it easier.

 This horse was determined to be the killer of 17 other horses in this urlLink bizarre story .

 I was just outside. It's hot out there. If you were a tree, what kind of tree would you be? or even better How much wood would a wood chuck, if a wood chuck could chuck wood? I can't let the Anonymous Blogger have all the fun, now can I?

 Hot and humid; that's our forecast for today. I walked out of my stifling Queens apartment with the hopes of feeling a cool breeze as my feet hit the sidewalk. Nope. It was just as hot and stifling outside as it was inside. I chose to open my windows today to air out my apartment. I've been running the A/C for a couple of days and the air is getting a little stale. Truth be told, if it weren't for the humidity, I wouldn't ever run the AC. Fresh air is preferred. So, as a result, it was hot while I was getting ready for work. I ran the AC until about 4 this morning. It's just too loud and drives me a little nuts. I can't sleep the night through while it's roaring cold air into my small space. My apartment is a studio with four windows facing the same direction. I get no cross ventilation so it gets hot pretty fast in there when the weather warms up. Some might even compare being inside my studio in the summer to being cooked alive. Anyway, it's a hot and humid day in the Big Apple.

 Did you hear about the urlLink American who was kidnapped as collateral against Saudi Arabia for some Al Quaeda prisoners they are holding prisoner? Why didn't they kidnap a Saudi? Say a little prayer for this nice man and his family

 Jon just watched "Used Cars" the other day and pointed out to me that Kurt Russell (in his first non-Disney, raunchy role) plays a sleazebag in cynical malaise-era America in 1980. In his most recent role in "Miracle" he plays a hero who helps "lead" America out of its cynical malaise in 1980. Just an interesting thought.

 In the pet store, I told Jon to touch the bunny because it was so soft and cute. 15 minutes later, checking out antiques, Jon's eye started to bother him. We decided to get outdoors figuring the dust was causing an allergic reaction. 1/2 an hour later sitting in the coffee shop, Jon's eye started to swell shut. It was the bunny.

 urlLink Caren , urlLink Sarah and I went to Staten Island to see urlLink Aaron Carter perform. Before we boarded the Staten Island Ferry we met for a late lunch or early dinner at FunAyama, a favorite spot of mine, introduced to me by Caren. urlLink Funayama is a sushi place like no other. Before even going, I liked the place because it has the word "fun" in its name. Sarah and I orderd the Sushi specials, Caren got the eel and we all shared a plate of edimame. If you are entertaining a friend, that you want to impress take that friend to Funayama. Last night, our portions were obscenely enormous but they always are, no matter the Sushi chef, no matter the day of the week or the time of day. It's on Greenwich Avenue between W. 10th and Charles Street. I'm ready start delivering food walking tours of New York. If I organized something like that - a day of eating at different restaurants over 6 or 7 hours in different parts of town - would you pay me and what would you pay? After a leisurely meal, we gathered our things and headed out on our musical mystery tour. 1. The Staten Island Ferry is free - I haven't been on the Staten Island Ferry in years and couldn't ask for better weather. In the early evening, the sky was still blue and the views were tremendous. Behind us, was a gorgeous view of downtown. If you head over to " urlLink Sarah's site , she posted a shot. On our left was Brooklyn and I think Governor's Island but I'm not entirely sure. I'll do some research and get back to you. A view of the Statue of Liberty passed us on our right. We laughed and joked around as Sarah hummed the theme song to " urlLink Working Girl " and fantasized about Harrison Ford being her lover. The ride was short but then again it was a free. This is another cheap thing you can do in New York, to entertain a friend or to entertain yourself. Staten Island is pretty interesting itself. We did only go as far as the Stadium but I've been there before. I've heard many New Yorkers refer to it as the armpit of New York but it isn't really. Link to urlLink Forgotten New York for some cool Staten Island places to visit. 2. Staten Island Yankee Stadium is a good venue for a show. Mostly because it's not too big and all around you see nothing but sky. Audience members are treated to a view of Manhattan. It's very clean. It's right on the water. (By the time I'm done writing this post, I'll be living in Staten Island) 3. The concert was a blast. Most of the audience members were 10 years old or under. What a happy place - not an ounce of cynisism to be found (outside of my body) which was quite refreshing for this New Yorker. Four acts were up before Aaron. Two solo acts, a thirteen year old boy and 14 or 15 year old blong girl, and two girl groups. All very pop, all very innocent all very Disney, actually. Aaron Carter was introduced by Hulk Hogan and his daughter - I think her name was Generic Blond - who Aaron Carter is seeing. Hulk Hogan - gosh he still looks hot. His body - yeowza! - he's been working out 24/7 since he fell out of the lime light. I feel bad for him because I'm sure he thought he would be retired by now, but no, Disney had to trounce him out on stage to introduce the 16 year old with the failed career who was performing to 3 - 10 year olds at some venue in Staten Island which wasn't even one-third full When Aaron came out every little girl (and at least three big [adult] ones) in that place lost their minds (again, see Sarah's blog) I can't say I found the music terribly good, but Aaron Carter worked his ass off entertaining the 5ifth grade and under crowd. The three of us were standing on our chairs for most of his performance. When he came out and started singing, I turned to Sarah and Caren and said, "Who is that girl?" It wasn't a girl. It was Aaron Carter. Honestly, this kid looks like he could use some time at a spa in New Mexico to regain his strength. By the end of the show, he was spent. I'll bet he loses 10 pounds every time he puts on a show. He can't weigh more than 120 pounds. Afterwards, as the crowd was breaking up, we spotted Lou Perlman, the one time despotic manager of the urlLink Backstreet Boys , urlLink N 'Sync , urlLink O Town and I'm guessing the two girl groups that warmed up the crowd. Their names were Huggy Poo and Play. (I'm not too sure about the name Huggy Pop but it was something like that). Sarah got a great picture of Mr. Perlman who was meeting and greeting the talent and their stage moms after the show. He was kind enough to stand still for her for the time it took take the photo. I guess the only thing I found disturbing was the sexiness of the choreography danced by the two girl groups. The audience was really young, I mean really, really young. It was like attending a Rafi concert. All around us were 4th and 5th graders having the times of their lives. I think their too young to see overtly sexy dancing. Last night was probably the first time I've really relaxed all week, truly relaxed. All in all, I had a great time and I'd do it again in a heartbeat. I recommend this experience to every cynical, pissed off, sick of life in New York City, New Yorker. Children have a way of making everything seem okay.

 I shit you not. I found this article on CBSnews.com urlLink Haute Croissant Couture French designer Jean-Paul Gaultier has created an entire collection of clothes made of fresh bread. Croissants and baguettes were turned into haute couture shoes, bras and even the perfect Oscar-night dresses. The Atkins-unfriendly threads are not for sale, but rather, are on display at the edgy Fondation Cartier in Paris until October. This video has no sound.

 urlLink Ray Charles died. He was 73. I guess he won't be "busted" anymore. (sniff)

 I find it interesting that the Reagans were unable to succeed in getting the Federal Government to relax regulations on stem cell research, urlLink firmly supported by Laura Bush , considering the amount of AIDS research not done during the Reagan's reign. Perhaps, if they had encouraged and funded AIDS research and education programs during their time in office, a cure for Alzheimers could have been found as a side effect. I don't wish illness on anyone. My heart goes out to the the Reagan family. I may not have liked Mr. Reagan as a politician but I didn't know him as a private person. He was probably a lovely man. Look at the turnout for his various wakes and the outpouring of sympathy for Mrs. Reagan. It's sad that so late in the 20th century and early into the 21st, people are still suffering from diseases that have afflicted humans for as long as medical professionals have been keeping records. Restrictions on stem cell research are so strong. With the politics of the Right to Life movement standing in they way who knows if American scientists will ever be able to follow their research to its end. Why must people suffer when cures are so close? There are several people in my life afflicted with ailments whose cure could potentially be found in the petry dish where the work will be done. That's where politics come in. That's why I dislike so many politicians. That's why it's so interesting that stem cell research toward finding a cure for Alzheimers was not available to the man who put the kibash on AIDS research during his run as President.

 I received this from one of my co-workers this morning, via email. What do you think? ======================================== How do you tell the difference between Liberals, Conservatives, and Southerners? Scenario: You're walking down a deserted street with your wife and two small children. Suddenly, a dangerous looking man with a huge knife comes around the corner, locks eyes with you, screams obscenities, raises the knife, and charges. You are carrying a loaded Glock 40, and you are an expert shot. You have mere seconds before he reaches you and your family. What do you do? Liberal response: Well, that's not enough information to answer the question! Does the man look poor or oppressed? Have I ever done anything to him that would inspire him to attack? Could we run away? What does my wife think? What about the kids? Could I possibly swing the gun like a club and knock the knife out of his hand? What doe s the law say about this situation? Does the Glock have appropriate safety built into it? Why am I carrying a loaded gun anyway, and what kind of message does this send to societyand to my children? Is it possible he'd be happy with just killing me? Does he definitely want to kill me, or would he be content just to wound me? If I were to grab his knees and hold on, could my family get away while he was stabbing me? Should I call 9-1-1? Why is this street so deserted? We need to raise taxes, have a paint and weed day and make this a happier, healthier street that would discourage such behavior. This is all so confusing! I need to debate this with some friends for a few days and try to come to a consensus. Conservative response: BANG! Southerner response: BANG! BANG! BANG! B ANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! click....Reload...BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! click.

 Jon and I hosted trivia and it went well. There were 8 teams, about 30 people, not the biggest draw but they bought lots of drinks so it was good for the bar. Our questions and categories were fun for the most part. However, my audio round - 10 arias, name the composer and the opera - didn't seem to go over very well. People didn't do as well as I thought they would but better, I'm sure, than they thought they would. Most people were able to get at least one opera or one composer. There was a tie for funniest team name. We awarded dirtiest team name to "George Bush - porn star or rock queen? We report, you decide." We gave the straight funniest team award name to "Permanent Bedtime for Bonzo." urlLink Caren walked with Jon and I a bit afterwards. . .and while we were walking up Sixth Avenue around 9th Street, Caren said "Hey, that was Elliott Gould." We couldn't tell because we'd already walked past him (he was walking towards us) and by the time she'd mentioned it all we could see was the back of his head. It could very well have been him, but unfortunately I wasn't as quick as Caren in spotting him. However, about 3 seconds later, ahead of us I spotted Jude Law. He looked good. Blonde, tan and I think he was with his wife, who was also blonde and tan and good looking. Caren was turning to go to her train but I stopped her and said, "look over my shoulder, behind me, is Jude Law." She looked up and confirmed that it was. Jon wasn't as sure. Not as familiar with Jude Law as Caren and myself, he actually went up to Jude Law and asked him, "Are you Jude Law?" to which Jude Law muttered, but not in an irritated way, "Yeah, yeah." Caren and I teased him a little bit because neither one of us would have gone up to him. Maybe it's a little bit of a New Yorker thing. I see celebrities in NYC all the time and I haven't gone up to one except the time I was walking with a friend and we saw Gordon Parks and he stopped to talk to him. It's either because I don't want to give them the satisfaction of being recognized or because I just don't want to seem uncool by thinking seeing them is a big deal or it's because I don't want to bug the celebrity, figuring they get bugged all the time. Earlier in the evening, on the way to the bar, Jon and I walked right past Jill Hennessy, formerly of Law and Order and now of Crossing Jordan. For me it's enough to recognize them. What do you think? If you saw a celebrity in your neck of the woods would you go up to them and talk to them or respect their privacy and leave them alone? Do you think it's cool or uncool to approach a celebrity in a non-entertainment related situation?

 North Korea has an intermediate-range missile called urlLink the No-Dong . This is too good to be true.

 Revisiting the department of weirdly appropriate names, I offer up urlLink Christopher Lame , who attacked a Taco Bell employee with a Chalupa because it wasn't what he ordered. You get it? That's pretty lame.

 urlLink Ronald Reagan died today. The above article speaks well of the two term president. Unlike urlLink these Nevada officials , I was never fond of Ronald Reagan as president. One of my earlier memories of becoming politically aware had to do with the Carter/Reagan election. As a child I was fond of President Carter. Not understanding the greater issues of the world, I felt bad that he was unable to free the Iranian hostages. I felt bad that he was blamed for the energy crisis of the 70's and I remember really liking his smile. I was disappointed when he lost to Reagan. As a teenager, I was only vaguely aware of the AIDS crisis that was growing during the 80's. As an adult I learned that Reagan and his administration are in large part to blame for the lack of funding for research into finding the cause for AIDS and preventing it's terrible spread. As a teenager I was aware as most of us were of the growing nuclear threat in the USSR and I remember the press conferences where President Reagan outlined his great plan for keeping the wolves at bay which was basically to bankrupt the USSR by forcing them to keep up with us in the arms race. We found out later that our own economy was also at risk as the dollar sank in value all over the world after his two terms were up I also remember the enormous coincidence of the Iranian hostages being released after Reagan took office. This is the time in my life when I started to become skeptical of politicians and learned that our government didn't always have the best interest of the American people at heart. They were more interested in personal gain. Do you remember the whole Iran Contra scandal when Ollie North fell on his sword? I do. My disappointment wasn't that great because I never trusted President Reagan. This is all based on my childish preference for Jimmy Carter's true warm smile over the false warmth of an actor turned politician. Our deficit increased, white collar criminals were practicing business crimes as if it was standard operating proceedure, the groundwork was laid for future savings and loans scandals, and thousands and thousands of people died afflicted with a disease that could have been prevented had the Reagan administration devoted any funding to research or education. These are my memories of Ronald Reagan. I don't think he was the great man many obituaries will say he was, although I do believe he was a pretty good actor.

 Yes. I made hamburgers for breakfast and served them with Mary Janes. Mary Janes pieces of bread with the middles torn out, and eggs cooked inside sunny side up. Hamburgers for breakfast? I got no complaints. I wasn't able to make the meat loaf last night, so that's what I ended up doing. Very exciting no? Today, I'll make banana cake.

 urlLink The Anonymous Blogger has done it again. Fanning the flames of our burning insecurities as men and women, he has made bold statements in order to spur on discussion. Well, it works with me every time. Bob stated that "women are crazy" that "women drive the dating process". CL responded by giving him what not about men having the upper hand when it comes to dating and marriage. Now, if Bob is speaking for all men that what he said about men being stupid is completely accurate. If men don't see that they have the upper hand when it comes to dating and marriage then they are truly blind. NOTE: I DO NOT SPEAK FOR ALL WOMEN. I SPEAK FOR HETEROSEXUAL WOMEN WHO WANT TO BE MARRIED OR IN A COMMITTED RELATIONSHIP. If it were up to most women, weddings would take place within in a year of meeting Mr. Right and falling in love. Women know almost right away whether or not they want to marry someone. They then have to play this game where they have to pretend like they aren't interested in marriage while Mr. Right slowly comes to the realization that he's not a kid anymore and he wants to get married. While this process happens at a rather rapid pace for women, men take quite a while longer to catch up. I can only imagine the thought process. "What if I meet someone younger?" or "What if she wants to stop working?" or "How do I know she's the one?" Well....we don't really know if you're the one either. Women decide they want to marry someone. They make a choice. Do we know if you guys are absolutely the one? Of course not, but we are willing to take a chance. How many years can we go on dating? How many men do we have to plod through before we have a pretty good idea of what we are looking for? Now if any of you single men in your 30's are surprised to hear that many single women in their 30's want to be married, you're truly unaware. Of course we want to be married. DUH!!!!!! There are some of us who have dated enough, had enough boyfriends, enough sex to know that it's time to settle down and pop out a few babies. We are on a clock guys. We have a finite amount of time that we can reproduce. So don't be surprised when the woman you are dating starts talking about a more serious relationship. AND THAT IS WHY YOU MEN HAVE THE F-ING UPPER HAND!!!!!

 You know it's bad when the Pope asks to see you about America's foreign policy in a nation America is currently occupying under your command. urlLink Pope John Paul II reminded President Bush on Friday of the Vatican's opposition to the war in Iraq and said the world has been troubled by recent "deplorable events," an apparent reference to the abuse of Iraqi prisoners by U.S. troops I'm assuming that the Pope invited President Bush to see what he could to end the war. As you know, I continue to have mixed feelings about the Iraq situation. Let's say, that the popular anti-war theory is correct and that this war is being conducted for the sole purpose of regulating the oil industry. Is that really so bad? The whole world depends on these lunatic OPEC nations for their fuel supplies. Shouldn't somebody be watching their shit? Part of me also believes that almost every country in that part of the world is out to rid the region of the Jewish scourge by slowly chipping away at Israel. So, if there is a strong military presence stationed there doesn't that kind of help Israel in a way, as a sort of a positive secondary effect? But then, there is that whole AMERICA is the watchdog of the world kind of vanity that seems to be wholly on display. There is something kind of despicable about taking over a country because you want to control it's resources. And then what happens when we leave. Everything is probably going to get worse. By the way, if anyone actually believes this war is about liberating the Iraqi people you are truly dillusional. I can't wait to hear what you have to say.

 Today is Friday, Friday, Friday. It will be fun day, fun day All day long So. Today is Friday - long awaited and finally here. That means that tomorrow is Saturday and most of us can sleep late. Tonight, after work here is what I would like to do. 1. Cook meatloaf (with a hard boiled egg in the middle of course) with homemade tomato sauce. I'll also be preparing a salad with a blackberry vinaigrette made famous by last Sunday's dinner chez Val. 2. Clean my home. After four days of work and ordering takeout, my house is a disaster; clothes every where, take out bags and containers every where, dirt every where. 3. Write trivia questions. This coming Tuesday night, Jon and I are hosting Tuesday Night Trivia at the urlLink Baggott Inn . I'm looking forward to this. As most of you should know by now, Jon and I met through trivia. 4. Relax and admire my French manicure/pedicure. Last night, I closed out Eve's nails. While my nails were drying the ladies were sweeping up and closing down. I was the last customer to leave last night but it was well worth it. The poor woman who worked on my feet sank in despair as I explained to her that I wanted a French pedicure. She was so sweet. I could tell she was tired and the last thing she wanted to do at the end of the day was yet another designer foot job. She was doing great up until the white line. She started to mess up and had to redo a couple of toes. She passed me off to another woman who did a much better job and finished off by doing a great job on my nails. That was a real moral booster. At some point tonight, I'm also supposed to write notes on my friend Dave's book. Poor guy. He gave his book to me over a month ago to read over and I haven't even finished it yet. We're getting together tomorrow to discuss and probably watch movies all day. He's my "movies all day on DVD" friend.

 This is going to be a wedding to remember. This urlLink steel magnate is renting out the Palace of Versailles for his daughter's wedding banquet, and if I read urlLink this article correctly, he has rented out urlLink this 17th century home of Nicholas Fouquet, the financial minister of Louis XIV. They are expecting 10,000 guests. The daughter's name is Vanisha. This makes me laugh. It's as if Lakshmi Mittal knew that his daughter's wedding was going to make his money "VANISH" when he first laid eyes on her. I hope someone posts pictures of Vanisha in her wedding dress.

 This little Georgian baby (Georgia in Europe not down South)is not so little. At 15 months, he already weighs 55 pounds. He's been gaining weight rapidly since his birth according to this article. Also, according to urlLink this article , his doctor told his mother that he should shed his weight by the time he's six or so. Hmmmmmmm.

 I read some good news on the website of a friend of mine. After a wave of bad luck with the opposite sex, it seems that things are starting to go his way. In our little community, we've been kicking around some dating philosophiese that we all think will help all of us in the long run. But I thought I'd add a few more things here. 1) Be positive. It's okay to be sad or talk about bad things that have happened to you in a day. But don't dwell on anything negative for too long. Talk about what made you sad and then move on. 2)Return phone calls in a timely fashion. If you wait too long to call her, she'll think you're blowing her off. If you haven't heard from your girl in a while, don't get all male on her and decide that calling her is a sign of weakness. Just call and see what's up. And don't call with an accusatory voice and say "WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?" Just call to say hi and see how's she's doing. 3) Respect the space issue. If you are feeling crowded say so. For example, "I was hoping to do something on my own tonight, but I WOULD LOVE to hang out tomorrow." or if she needs to do something without you one night, you can say, "Okay. I'll miss you tonight but perhaps we can get together later this week." 4) If you see something that you think she'll like, pick it up for her. You know you think about her and there' no harm in letting her know. I have more advice, but this could be considered condescending so I'll stop.

 urlLink This news of the condom ambulance comes out of Sweden. The Swedish Organization for Sex Education is stepping up their education efforts by offering an emergency condom service. People on the verge of intercourse can call the phone number 696969 and an ambulance with a red condom on top and wings will deliver packets of 10 condoms at a price of about seven dollars, which apparently is less than in the stores. The service is going to run through June and it's aimed at young people. You gotta' love the Swedes.

 Jon and I moved my futon into the living room to make room for the furniture that is coming tomorrow. This was no easy task considering the size of the futon and the angles of our new space. But it is done. So what if we scraped some paint from the bedroom door frame. The paint shouldn't come off that easily anyway. Tomorrow, we pick up our truck and the super move begins. We will be moving fastly and furious to make sure we meet our tight schedule. But tomorrow it will be done and we will be together in the same place. I feel so lucky that I met him and now that we are living together. . . I am very happy. I have off on Monday. A three day weekend. Wahoo! By the end of it, a new chapter will have begun. I will retire the Misanthrope and start a blog for the Rantings of a Shiny Happy Gen X'er.

 urlLink Carrot Top is still hot.

 I&nbsp;wrote the following at&nbsp;5 this morning so please forgive the typos. &nbsp; (I have to admit, I didn't watch this speech.&nbsp; Generally I find that the delivery of a speech can interfere with how you hear it, which is generally why I prefer to read them.&nbsp; Also, I watched Kerry for about a minute and immediately disliked him because of how he was delivering the speech.&nbsp; He came off as fake and icky. But now that I'm looking at excerpts of the speech, I have to admit, it's pretty good.&nbsp; There isn't much to criticize. Actually, after reading through the speech, it's clear to me that&nbsp;Senator&nbsp;Kerry should be writing speeches for his wife.)&nbsp; --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- From the website of the urlLink Democratic National Convention Senator John Kerry Excerpts of Senator John Kerry's Convention Speech(As Prepared for Delivery) (Can't argue with this. . . pretty good opening) My fellow Americans, this is the most important election of our lifetime. The stakes are high. We are a nation at war -- a global war on terror against an enemy unlike any we have ever known before. And here at home, wages are falling, health care costs are rising, and our great middle class is shrinking. People are working weekends; they're working two jobs, three jobs, and they're still not getting ahead. (Can't&nbsp;argue with this either.&nbsp; It's pretty&nbsp;optimistic.&nbsp; The word optimist is right in the excerpt.) &nbsp; We can do better and we will.&nbsp; We're the optimists. For us, this is a country of the future. We're the can do people.&nbsp; And let's not forget what we did in the 1990s. We balanced the budget. We paid down the debt.&nbsp; We created 23 million new jobs. We lifted millions out of poverty and we lifted the standard of living for the middle class. We just need to believe in ourselves -- and we can do it again. (I got nothin') So tonight, in the city where America's freedom began, only a few blocks from where the sons and daughters of liberty gave birth to our nation -- here tonight, on behalf of a new birth of freedom -- on behalf of the middle class who deserve a champion, and those struggling to join it who deserve a fair shot --- for the brave men and women in uniform who risk their lives every day and the families who pray for their return&nbsp;- for all those who believe our best days are ahead of us&nbsp;- for all of you -- with great faith in the American people, I accept your nomination for President of the United States. (This is kind of tricky.&nbsp; Again, I don't support the war but I don't think George W. wanted to go to war.&nbsp; I believe he genuinely think we needed to.&nbsp; Criticizing the current President is like insulting your former boss in a job interview.&nbsp; It's just bad form.&nbsp; Also, I'm sure that if a Dem had been President, they would most likely have received the same misinformation, although I don't know if Gore would have jumped to go to war.&nbsp; Also, W.&nbsp;isn't the sharpest crayon in the box and his decision making process is incumbered by a possibly low IQ and strident belief that God is his friend.) &nbsp; As president, I will ask hard questions and demand hard evidence.&nbsp; I will immediately reform the intelligence system&nbsp;- so policy is guided by facts, and facts are never distorted by politics.&nbsp; And as president, I will bring back this nation's time-honored tradition: the United States of America never goes to war because we want to, we only go to war because we have to. (Oh.&nbsp; That old chestnut.&nbsp; WE GET IT!!! W. used his "get out of jail free card" during Vietnam and Kerry didn't.&nbsp; Even if W. had fought in the trenches with the generation that was almost killed off, he still would have made the decision to go to war, just like his daddy!&nbsp; With that said, you can't fault Kerry for fighting the good fight regardless of the legitimacy of that police action turned askew.)&nbsp; I defended this country as a young man and I will defend it as President.&nbsp; Let there be no mistake:&nbsp; I will never hesitate to use force when it is required.&nbsp; Any attack will be met with a swift and certain response. I will never give any nation or international institution a veto over our national security.&nbsp; And I will build a stronger American military. (Okay.&nbsp; Here he is saying that the Democrats are no pussies and that we shouldn't be scared that our military is going to fall to shit when and if he becomes Prez.&nbsp; Not much to make fun of here either.) In these dangerous days there is a right way and a wrong way to be strong. Strength is more than tough words. After decades of experience in national security, I know the reach of our power and I know the power of our ideals. We need to make America once again a beacon in the world. We need to be looked up to and not just feared.&nbsp; We need to lead a global effort against nuclear proliferation&nbsp;- to keep the most dangerous weapons in the world out of the most dangerous hands in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;We need a strong military and we need to lead strong alliances.&nbsp; And then, with confidence and determination, we will be able to tell the terrorists: You will lose and we will win.&nbsp; The future doesn't belong to fear; it belongs to freedom.&nbsp; (I wonder if 95% of our container ships are really coming into our ports without ever being physically inspected. That seems like a high number.&nbsp;&nbsp;HEY!!! SOMEONE SHOULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He supports Homeland&nbsp;Security, interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I guess George W. and his people weren't completely full of shit.&nbsp; I don't really get that Firehouse remark but I'm sure the Dems at the convention ROARED when he said it.) And the front lines of this battle are not just far away&nbsp;- they're right here on our shores, at our airports, and potentially in any town or city. Today, our national security begins with homeland security. The 9-11 Commission has given us a path to follow, endorsed by Democrats, Republicans, and the 9-11 families.&nbsp; As president, I will not evade or equivocate; I will immediately implement the recommendations of that commission.&nbsp; We shouldn't be letting ninety-five percent of container ships come into our ports without ever being physically inspected.&nbsp; We shouldn't be leaving our nuclear and chemical plants without enough protection.&nbsp; And we shouldn't be opening firehouses in Baghdad and closing them down in the United States of America. (Overall, based on the excerpts, I'd say this was a good speech.&nbsp; The part I turned off was Kerry talking about pomp and circumstance and knew that not all of the speech would be terribly interesting.&nbsp; It's much better this way!!) My fellow citizens, elections are about choices. And choices are about values.&nbsp; In the end, it's not just policies and programs that matter; the president who sits at that desk must be guided by principle.&nbsp; For four years, we've heard a lot of talk about values. But values spoken without actions taken are just slogans.&nbsp; Values are not just words.&nbsp; They're what we live by. They're about the causes we champion and the people we fight for. And it is time for those who talk about family values to start valuing families. (I don't believe there is much that Kerry can do to lift the quality of our lives.&nbsp; It'll probably take a couple of administration's before the economy evens out and repeats it's performance of the 90's.&nbsp; But hey, what harm can he do by believing he or any President has any control over the economy at all.&nbsp; I'm still voting for him, simply because he is not BUSH.&nbsp; I'm just glad his wife isn't running.&nbsp; I hope she doesn't have that much influence over him.) We value jobs that pay you more not less than you earned before.&nbsp; We value jobs where, when you put in a week's work, you can actually pay your bills, provide for your children, and lift up the quality of your life.&nbsp; We value an America where the middle class is not being squeezed, but doing better.

 Non-superficial Deal Closers Here is a list of my own in no particular order - getting on board with the discussion started by urlLink The Anonymous Bloggette , then continued by urlLink Candy Blue Kite (s0rry to read about your boyfriend), urlLink et al . Love and Appreciation of Cartoons I need someone who grew up watching cartoons and still loves them.&nbsp; I need that someone to understand why cartoons are great for obvious and not so obvious reasons, who can appreciate the subtle or overt social commentary on both a serious and ironic level. Love of Animals I'm with the Bloggette on this one.&nbsp; Someone who loves animals, wouldn't harm them, gets emotional when they hear a sad story about one.&nbsp; If someone could be mean to animals, they could be mean to you. Familial Relations Unless someone's parents/family are absolute monsters, there should be at least a working relationship in place.&nbsp; This communicates an understanding of relationships and the efforts required to be involved in long term and intricate emotional bonds. A Kind Disposition&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nice guys don't always finish last.&nbsp; I need someone who is empathetic to those around him, someone who is moved by the struggles and/or misfortunes of others or who gets joy from good news. A Sense of Self Someone who is confident; who is not afraid to be himself; someone who can say no to me; someone who has interests that are similar to mine so we have common ground, yet enough that are different that I can be turned on to new things. Brains This may seem superficial but it's not really if you think about it.&nbsp; If a guy were too smart for me, I would never feel like I was good enough for that person.&nbsp; So it makes sense that I would want someone who wouldn't feel that way with me.&nbsp; Not that I'm some kind of genius, but I'm no dope needah.&nbsp; I need someone who gets my jokes, understands my cultural references and does not look at me&nbsp;like I have&nbsp;four heads when I use words with four or more syllables.&nbsp; I need someone who doesn't feel threatened by me. Similar Background After years of dating men with vastly different backgrounds I've decided that someone with a similar upbringing in the areas of both religion and education is best for me.&nbsp; Well Groomed Adequate to neurotic personal hygiene must&nbsp;be in&nbsp;place if I am to be your friend, let alone your intimate relation.

 Today is Thursday, Thursday, Thursday It will be a fun day, fun day, all day long. I've got over the hump and I'm in the home stretch. This weekend Jon and I will be focusing on finalizing his move.&nbsp; He's been moving his things in piece by piece but now we have to move the big pieces.&nbsp; He's made&nbsp;a lot of progress in that he has already moved most of his books, only two small boxes of books&nbsp;remain.&nbsp; The move will be difficult but not for the typical reasons.&nbsp; We are going to be a tight schedule.&nbsp; We have procured a vehicle which we have to return by a certain hour.&nbsp; In the time that we have it, we have to load up Jon's stuff, go to Long Beach to pick up some furniture from my parents, drive back to Queens, unload everything and then return the van. So, if anyone is feeling particularly altruistic this weekend and would like to give us a hand, you can contact me at urlLink genxmisanthrope@aol.com . I have spoken. &nbsp;

 Last night, we came in second place (wahoo!).&nbsp; Our team was named, Britney Spears is Changing her Name to Madonna .&nbsp; When the hostess with the mostess, urlLink Caren Lissner , announced our team name, the crowd responded with silence.&nbsp; I named our team for&nbsp;Britney Spears's upcoming Kaballah style wedding.&nbsp; Nobody laughed.&nbsp; I don't like to be in charge of naming the team, because often my jokes fall flat or they just suck. On my team were&nbsp;a chemistry teacher, urlLink Sarah and Eric(k). The co-host Michael "Prince Valiant" Lynch, brought a good game.&nbsp; I found his audio round very challenging - identifying Rolling Stones songs covered by different artists and then identifying those artists.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I recognized Linda Ronstandt's voice on Tumbling Dice but for some reason went with Melissa Etheridge as a guess.&nbsp; I recognized Tumbling Dice because it was a dance number from a Summer Show I planned to put on with the upstairs neighbor when I was 8 or 9 or 10 years old.&nbsp; The dance routine we "choreographed" involved a lot of rolling around on the&nbsp;floor to coincide with the words "tumbling dice".&nbsp;&nbsp; The visual round - we had to identify the Joneses.&nbsp; We got every one except Brian Jones, whose very old photo&nbsp;looked eerily similar to our co-host Michael Lynch.&nbsp; Funniest&nbsp;team name award went to &nbsp; urlLink I'd Give My Left Nut For Six Yellow T-Shirts . &nbsp;&nbsp; They won Reese's Peanutbutter Cups.&nbsp; Yummy.

 Teresa Heinz Kerry to the urlLink DNC , July 28, 2004 Thank you, Christopher. Your father would be proud of you and your brothers. I love you and all our family. My name is Teresa Heinz Kerry. And by now I hope it will come as no surprise to anyone that I have something to say. (Here is where Mrs. Heinz Kerry explains to the crowd that she is&nbsp;a citizen of the world who must really know what she is talking about because she can speak several different languages.) And tonight, as I have done throughout this campaign I would like to speak to you from my heart. Y a todos los Hispanos, los Latinos; a tous les Americains, Francais et Canadiens; a tutti Italiani; a toda a familia Portugesa e Brazileria; to all my continental African family living in this country, and to all new Americans: I invite you to join our conversation, and together with us work towards the noblest purpose of all: a free, good, and democratic society.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am grateful for the opportunity to stand before you and say a few words about my husband, John Kerry, and why I firmly believe he should be the next president of the United States.&nbsp; This is such a powerful moment for me. Like many other Americans, like many of you, and like even more of your parents and grandparents, I was not born in this country. As you have seen, I grew up in East Africa, in Mozambique, in a land that was then under a dictatorship. My father- a wonderful, caring man who practiced medicine for 43 years, and taught me how to understand disease and wellness - only got the right to vote for the first time when he was 71 years old. That's what happens in dictatorships. (Here is where Mrs. Heinz Kerry qualifies herself as an expert on the fight for human rights and civil liberties by describing her personal experiences with apartheid.) As a young woman, I attended Witwatersrand University in Johannesburg, South Africa, which was then not segregated. But I witnessed the weight of apartheid everywhere around me. And so, with my fellow students we marched against its extension into higher education. This was the late 50's, the dawn of the civil rights marches in America. As history records, our efforts in South Africa failed and the Higher Education Apartheid Act was passed. Apartheid tightened its ugly grip, the Sharpsville riots followed, and a short while later Nelson Mandela was arrested and sent to Robin Island.&nbsp; I learned something then, and I believe it still. There is a value in taking a stand whether or not anyone may be noticing and whether or not it is a risky thing to do. And if even those who are in danger can raise their lonely voices, isn't more required of all of us, in this land where liberty had her birth? (Here is where she explains to Americans what a great country this is, as if we need this explained to us like children.) I have a very personal feeling about how special America is, and I know how precious freedom is. It is a sacred gift, sanctified by those who have lived it and those who have died defending it. My right to speak my mind, to have a voice, to be what some have called "opinionated", is a right I deeply and profoundly cherish. My only hope is that, one day soon, women - who have all earned the right to their opinions - instead of being labeled opinionated, will be called smart or well-informed, just as men are. (Now she's just blathering on . . .) Tonight I want to remember my mother's warmth, generosity, wisdom, and hopefulness, and thank her for all the sacrifices she made on our behalf, like so many other mothers. This evening, I want to acknowledge and honor the women of this world, whose wise voices for much too long have been excluded and discounted. It is time for the world to hear women?s voices, in full and at last.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past year, I have been privileged to meet with Americans all across this land. They voiced many different concerns, but one they all seemed to share was about America's role in the world - what we want this great country of ours to stand for. (Wow.&nbsp; How great that this citizen of the world admires Americans so.) To me, one of the best faces America has ever projected is the face of a Peace Corps volunteer. That face symbolizes this country: young, curious, brimming with idealism and hope?and a real honest compassion. Those young people convey an idea of America that is all about heart and creativity, generosity and confidence?a practical, can-do sense and a big, big smile. For many generations of people around the globe, that is what America has represented. A symbol of hope, a beacon brightly lit by the optimism of its people?people coming from all over the world.&nbsp; Americans believed they could know all there is to know, build all there is to build, break down any barrier, tear down any wall. We sent men to the moon, and when that was not far enough, we sent Galileo to Jupiter, we sent Cassini to Saturn, and Hubble to touch the very edges of the universe at the very dawn of time. Americans showed the world what can happen when people believe in amazing possibilities. And, that, for me, is the spirit of America - the America you and I are working for in this election. It is the America that people all across this nation want to restore - from Iowa to California, from Florida to Michigan, from Washington State to my home state of Pennsylvania. It is the America the world wants to see, shining, hopeful, and bright once again. And that is the America that my husband John Kerry wants to lead. (And finally, she talks about John Kerry.) John believes in a bright future. He believes we can, and we will, invent the technologies, new materials, and conservation methods of the future. He believes that alternative fuels will guarantee that not only will no American boy or girl go to war because of our dependence on foreign oil, but also that our economy will forever become independent of this need. We can, and we will, create good, competitive, and sustainable jobs while still protecting the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the health of our children, because good environmental policy is good economics. John believes that we can, and we will, give every family and every child access to affordable health care, a good education, and the tools to become self-reliant. John Kerry believes we must, and we should, recognize the immense value of the caregivers in our country?those women and men who nurture and care for children, for elderly parents, for family members in need. These are the people who build and support our most valuable assets?our families. Isn?t it time we began working to give parents more opportunity to be with their children, and to afford to have a family life? With John Kerry as president, we can, and we will, protect our nation's security without sacrificing our civil liberties. In short, John believes we can, and we must, lead in the world - as America, unique among nations, always should - by showing the face, not of our fears, but of our hopes. (Did you know that he fought in Vietnam?&nbsp; I had no idea.) John is a fighter. He earned his medals the old-fashioned way, by putting his life on the line for his country. No one will defend this nation more vigorously than he will - and he will always be first in the line of fire. But he also knows the importance of getting it right. For him, the names of too many friends inscribed in the cold stone of the Vietnam Memorial testify to the awful toll exacted by leaders who mistake stubbornness for strength. That is why, as president, my husband will not fear disagreement or dissent. He believes that our voices?yours and mine?must be the voices of freedom. And if we do not speak, neither does she. (More condescension) In America, the true patriots are those who dare speak truth to power. The truth we must speak now is that America has responsibilities that it is time for us to accept again. With John Kerry as president, global climate change and other threats to the health of our planet will begin to be reversed. With John Kerry as president, the alliances that bind the community of nations and that truly make our country and the world a safer place, will be strengthened once more. (Again, she explains to us the greatness of America.) The Americans John and I have met in the course of this campaign all want America to provide hopeful leadership again. They want America to return to its moral bearings. It is not a moralistic America they seek, but a moral nation that understands and willingly shoulders its obligations; a moral nation that rejects thoughtless and greedy choices in favor of thoughtful and generous actions; a moral nation that leads through the power of its ideas and the power of its example. We can and we should join together to make the most of this great gift we have been given, this gift of freedom, this gift of America. (Is she likening her husband to Lincoln?&nbsp; Possibly.) In his first inaugural, speaking to a nation on the eve of war, Abraham Lincoln said, "We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave, to every living heart and hearth-stone, all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature".&nbsp; Today, the better angels of our nature are just waiting to be summoned. We only require a leader who is willing to call on them, a leader willing to draw again on the mystic chords of our national memory and remind us of all that we, as a people, everyday leaders, can do; of all that we as a nation stand for and of all the immense possibility that still lies ahead. I think I've found just the guy. I'm married to him. (Awwwwwwwe.&nbsp; How sweet!!) John Kerry will give us back our faith in America. He will restore our faith in ourselves and in the sense of limitless opportunity that has always been America's gift to the world.&nbsp; Together we will lift everyone up. We have to. It's possible. And you know what? It's the American thing to do. Goodnight and God bless.

 Not to offend anyone, but my nephew is&nbsp;the cutest baby ever born, EVER.&nbsp; To memorialize his cuteness, I just ordered two mugs with his 6 month old likeness from an online company that transfers images to things.&nbsp; This is my first aunt mania folley. I look forward to more.

 CARTER'S REMARKS TO THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION, BOSTON Mon Jul 26 2004 19:45:57 ET My name is Jimmy Carter, and I'm not running for president. But here's what I will be doing: everything I can to put John Kerry in the White House with John Edwards right there beside him. Twenty-eight years ago I was running for president, and I said then, "I want a government as good and as honest and as decent and as competent and as compassionate as are the American people." I say this again tonight, and that is exactly what we will have next January with John Kerry as president of the United States. As many of you know, my first chosen career was in the United States Navy, where I served as a submarine officer. At that time, my shipmates and I were ready for combat and prepared to give our lives to defend our nation and its principles. At the same time, we always prayed that our readiness would preserve the peace. I served under two presidents, Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower, men who represented different political parties. Both of whom had faced their active military responsibilities with honor. They knew the horrors of war, and later, as commanders-in-chief, they exercised restraint and judgment and had a clear sense of mission. We had confidence that our leaders, military and civilian, would not put our soldiers and sailors in harm's way by initiating "wars of choice" unless America's vital interests were endangered. We also were sure that these presidents would not mislead us when it came to issues involving our nation's security. Today, our Democratic party is led by another former naval officer -- one who volunteered for military service. He showed up when assigned to duty, and he served with honor and distinction. He also knows the horrors of war and the responsibilities of leadership, and I am confident that next January he will restore the judgment and maturity to our government that is sorely lacking today. I am proud to call Lieutenant John Kerry my shipmate, and I am ready to follow him to victory in November. As you know, our country faces many challenges at home involving energy, taxation, the environment, education, and health. To meet these challenges, we need new leaders in Washington whose policies are shaped by working American families instead of the super-rich and their armies of lobbyists. But the biggest reason to make John Kerry president is even more important. It is to safeguard the security of our nation. Today, our dominant international challenge is to restore the greatness of America -- based on telling the truth, a commitment to peace, and respect for civil liberties at home and basic human rights around the world. Truth is the foundation of our global leadership, but our credibility has been shattered and we are left increasingly isolated and vulnerable in a hostile world. Without truth -- without trust -- America cannot flourish. Trust is at the very heart of our democracy, the sacred covenant between the president and the people. When that trust is violated, the bonds that hold our republic together begin to weaken. After 9/11, America stood proud, wounded but determined and united. A cowardly attack on innocent civilians brought us an unprecedented level of cooperation and understanding around the world. But in just 34 months, we have watched with deep concern as all this goodwill has been squandered by a virtually unbroken series of mistakes and miscalculations. Unilateral acts and demands have isolated the United States from the very nations we need to join us in combating terrorism. Let us not forget that the Soviets lost the Cold War because the American people combined the exercise of power with adherence to basic principles, based on sustained bipartisan support. We understood the positive link between the defense of our own freedom and the promotion of human rights. Recent policies have cost our nation its reputation as the world's most admired champion of freedom and justice. What a difference these few months of extremism have made! The United States has alienated its allies, dismayed its friends, and inadvertently gratified its enemies by proclaiming a confused and disturbing strategy of "preemptive" war. With our allies disunited, the world resenting us, and the Middle East ablaze, we need John Kerry to restore life to the global war against terrorism. In the meantime, the Middle East peace process has come to a screeching halt for the first time since Israel became a nation. All former presidents, Democratic and Republican, have attempted to secure a comprehensive peace for Israel with hope and justice for the Palestinians. The achievements of Camp David a quarter century ago and the more recent progress made by President Bill Clinton are now in peril. Instead, violence has gripped the Holy Land, with the region increasingly swept by anti-American passions. Elsewhere, North Korea's nuclear menace -- a threat far more real and immediate than any posed by Saddam Hussein -- has been allowed to advance unheeded, with potentially ominous consequences for peace and stability in Northeast Asia. These are some of the prices of our government's radical departure from the basic American principles and values espoused by John Kerry! In repudiating extremism we need to recommit ourselves to a few common- sense principles that should transcend partisan differences. First, we cannot enhance our own security if we place in jeopardy what is most precious to us, namely, the centrality of human rights in our daily lives and in global affairs. Second, we cannot maintain our historic self-confidence as a people if we generate public panic. Third, we cannot do our duty as citizens and patriots if we pursue an agenda that polarizes and divides our country. Next, we cannot be true to ourselves if we mistreat others. And finally, in the world at large we cannot lead if our leaders mislead. You can't be a war president one day and claim to be a peace president the next, depending on the latest political polls. When our national security requires military action, John Kerry has already proven in Vietnam that he will not hesitate to act. And as a proven defender of our national security, John Kerry will strengthen the global alliance against terrorism while avoiding unnecessary wars. Ultimately, the issue is whether America will provide global leadership that springs from the unity and integrity of the American people or whether extremist doctrines and the manipulation of truth will define America's role in the world. At stake is nothing less than our nation's soul. In a few months, I will, God willing, enter my 81st year of my life, and in many ways the last few months have been some of the most disturbing of all. But I am not discouraged. I do not despair for our country. I believe tonight, as I always have, that the essential decency, compassion and common sense of the American people will prevail. And so I say to you and to others around the world, whether they wish us well or ill: do not underestimate us Americans. We lack neither strength nor wisdom. There is a road that leads to a bright and hopeful future. What America needs is leadership. Our job, my fellow Americans, is to ensure that the leaders of this great country will be John Kerry and John Edwards. Thank you and God bless America!

 The rug felt&nbsp;little walked on. The Seran Wrap felt invisible. The tuna felt like chopped liver. The shelf felt put upon. The wall felt exposed. The light&nbsp;was turned&nbsp;off.&nbsp;

 Has there ever been a more Monday Monday than today? I seem to remember rain in the forecast, yet it is amazingly cool and sunny and just generally beautiful outside.&nbsp; The weathermen called it wrong all weekend.

 It might not be every woman's dream to take cook for someone special but it is mine.&nbsp; Let me start by telling you all that Jon and I live together now as of very recently.&nbsp; We now a have&nbsp; an apartment bigger than both of our old ones put together.&nbsp;&nbsp; I now have a kitchen big enough to really do some cooking, which is what I've started doing this week. Thursday night, I baked my first cake in my new oven.&nbsp; I cleaned it and then baked in it.&nbsp; It still needs a good proper, lye cleaning but the brillo pad-sponge cleaning will do for now.&nbsp; The oven gets hot real fast and runs hotter than the gauge reads, so my cake batter cooked in 10 minutes instead of the recommended 30. No harm done; &nbsp;it was still perfect.&nbsp; You can't do much to mess up a Duncan Hines mix.&nbsp; (Yeah.&nbsp; I cheated, I know, but it was easy and delicious). I've been feeding that cake to Jon and various guests for several days.&nbsp; Yes. Guests.&nbsp; That's another new development.&nbsp; We now have room to entertain. Yesterday my brother and his family came over and hung out.&nbsp; My nephew has now been in my new apartment. He is so CUTE!!!.&nbsp; His cuteness is so severe it should be illegal.&nbsp; And he's such a happy baby. Giggling and cooing and spitting and drooling and blowing raspberries, which I found out is a normal and important stage of development for a six-month-old.&nbsp; Does anyone know why blowing raspberries is an important milestone in baby's development?&nbsp;&nbsp;He did it for at least half an hour and was completely entertained by it -- much to our amusement. Anyway, last night I fried chicken, which I haven't done in ages, for a very appreciative Jon.&nbsp; I made corn on the cob, salad and fried chicken.&nbsp; I fried it, then I baked it.&nbsp; It never cooks enough when it's fried in oil for some reason.&nbsp; If you cook it all the way through, the outside burns.&nbsp;I know that fried chicken is supposed to be a little pink, but I just don't like that.&nbsp; Either way it was&nbsp;a great meal finished off by the remains of the cake. Does anyone else enjoy cooking for someone else&nbsp;as much as&nbsp;I do? &nbsp; If so, please write in.

 I was told this post referenced sweat too much, so the censors have bleeped out any mention of sweat. The super razes&nbsp;wood from the turgid bathroom door so it will close.&nbsp;&nbsp;The manly *bleep* of&nbsp;*bleep* quickly fills the slowly cooling air of the slightly too warm apartment while the Beatles bleat out&nbsp; Revolver from the CD player in bombastic rhythms.&nbsp; I sit at this computer&nbsp;*bleep* while the super pulls out a power tool and starts making noises increasing in volume.&nbsp; I wonder at this point, how much extra door is there.&nbsp; The bathroom is a mess because the man, in all the years I've known him has never once brought a drop cloth with him to do work in either of my apartments.&nbsp; When he is done, I will be able to close my bathroom door.&nbsp; I will have the privacy&nbsp;necessary to piss in my pot. --------------------------------------------------------------------- I discovered that if I pull down the bedroom window from the top and then all the other windows in my apartment&nbsp; I can make a cross breeze.&nbsp; The apartment has been quite warm the last week or so.&nbsp; This rain today is&nbsp;a blessing, bringing much relief.&nbsp; This morning the air felt heavy, like it was retaining water, like it was squeezing me out for more room.&nbsp; It felt like the air was trying to get some air (from me) because I was having so much trouble breathing.&nbsp; But the rain is fixing all that.&nbsp;

 There is a joke urlLink in here somewhere but I can't seem to find it.&nbsp; Maybe you can help me flesh it out. &nbsp;

 According to this urlLink article , by quitting smoking, I have increased my chances of dying&nbsp;from obesity. Who is conducting these studies anyway?&nbsp; urlLink R.J. Reynolds ?

 From the title of this post you may think I'm referring to George Hamilton.&nbsp; Well, I'm not.&nbsp; To read more about this distinction, be sure to read urlLink Candy Blue Kite's essay &nbsp;about efforts to put Ronald Reagan on the $10 bill. It's a good one.

 urlLink It's hot, hazy and humid .&nbsp; It is so hazy and humid outside that I hurt myself breathing on the walk to my office from the subway.&nbsp; 25 minutes later I am just starting to feel better.&nbsp; There was a shart pain in my chest and now I'm completely congested. I urlLink HATE this weather, just really, really hate it. I'm hoping that the weather urlLink Amanda had yesterday will be repeated here.&nbsp; I haven't seen a rainbow in quite some time.

 It's Friday. The day we have all been waiting for. It's here!! Someone alert the media!! Call my mother!!! IT'S FRIDAY!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; WOOOOOOOO HOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!

 It turns out that urlLink Stephen Hawking was wrong about black holes eating matter and making it disapear.&nbsp; Now, he believes, that once the black hole disengtegrates, the matter it was holding reappears but in a mangled form. He could tell me that black holes are where leprachauns store their pots of gold after sliding down the rainbow or that the tooth fairy returns to her black hole every night after collecting children's teeth&nbsp;all I know about physics. It's&nbsp;a good&nbsp;thing he's been working on the black hole problem&nbsp;too, with all the problems going on in the world, it's truly important that one of our greatest minds be working on solving problems that don't really exist but in theory somewhere, far, far away in the cosmos. He's creating his own black hole right here on earth.&nbsp;

 Lordy Loo.&nbsp; It's the day before Friday.&nbsp; I made it over the mountain and I can see homestretch.&nbsp; My week has been a lot like this last leg of the Tour de France where Lance took the lead.&nbsp; He kills in the mountains. I'm&nbsp;tired but in a good way.&nbsp; Made more progress last night&nbsp;on the&nbsp;apt.&nbsp; I've been throwing away a lot&nbsp;of stuff.....last night I threw out an almost love letter from a man I knew in college.&nbsp;&nbsp;When he left school, he graduated&nbsp;one semester before me, he wrote me a note expressing how he was sorry he was mean to me and regretted not having gotten involved&nbsp;with me because we could have&nbsp;had something special.&nbsp; Well. . .I guess he was right, we could have had something special for about&nbsp;two minutes and then much to our surprise it would have been over JUST LIKE THAT!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; LOSER!!!!!!!&nbsp; I was happy to toss out his note considering I hadn't looked at it since I put it in my filing cabinet 11 years ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also threw out the picture of him I made for one of my photo classes; a playbill of a student production in which he starred;&nbsp; and a postcard where he referred to me as Hazel Nut. Yes.&nbsp; I threw out little bits and pieces of my past and we know how&nbsp;hard that is.&nbsp; I threw away the pay stubs from the jobs I've had over the last 8 - 10 years.&nbsp; Goodness only knows why I was holding on to those bitter reminders of past crappy jobs.&nbsp; Those weren't as tough to throw out as one would think. What else did I throw away?&nbsp; Bank statements from accounts that no longer exist; photocopies and printouts of articles that I was interested in 10 years ago about male rape (don't ask); letters I've written to people over the years but never sent (thank goodness, you know those letters); notepads with random scribbles and shopping lists that mean nothing now. When J came over last night, he commented that I look like I lost weight.&nbsp; I did in a way.&nbsp; I lost or threw out a lot of baggage to make room for someone new and it feels great!!!! And I am actually losing weight, which is weird considering you're supposed to gain weight when you quit smoking.&nbsp; It must be an oxygen thing. &nbsp;

 Today is hump day, hump day, hump day. It will be a hump day, hump day All day long. It's 7:25 am and I just woke up for the fourth morning in a row in my new apartment.&nbsp; I woke up 15 minutes before the alarm clock and 10 minutes before my mother called me to try out my new phone number.&nbsp; Yes it is early, but I don't mind.&nbsp; We have an understanding.&nbsp; She always seems to know when I'm awake and therefore never wakes me with her calls. I haven't spoken about smoking in a while. That's because most days, although the desire&nbsp;to smoke&nbsp;is&nbsp;still there, the cravings have been minimal.&nbsp; Sometimes, if the day is particularly busy or full of stress, cravings pop up left and right.&nbsp; Saturday and Sunday for instance, the day of my move, were stressful and for most of both of those days, I really wanted a cigarette.&nbsp; I snapped several times and the loved ones who were helping me.&nbsp; Thankfully, they are understanding and supportive and forgave me quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying sorry isn't always enough.&nbsp; People never like it when you snap at them, so hopefully the sting of my snappiness has worn off by now. The setup is going swimmingly.&nbsp; I find myself needing more furniture to fill up all this space.&nbsp; I'm having trouble getting used to length of time it takes to walk from one room to the other, but I'm sure I will soon enough. &nbsp;

 Today, for about a minute I smelled something that reminded me of my grandparents.&nbsp; They passed away awhile ago.&nbsp;&nbsp; They lived long, happy lives but they are still missed.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time I was thinking of them, I was looking looking over my links and realized that I hadn't been to urlLink Forgotten New York &nbsp;in quite a while.&nbsp; So I go to&nbsp;the site and one of his main features this month is on urlLink Mount Zion Cemetary in Maspeth. I know the place well.&nbsp; My granparents and several members of my family are buried there. The article about Mount Zion focuses on the very cool technique used to put the deads' faces on their tombstones. It's cool.&nbsp; You should check it out.&nbsp;

 Does anyone else get incredibly clumsy before getting their periods or is just me?&nbsp;&nbsp; It turns out that clumsiness is one of the listed symptoms of PMS on every urlLink website I checked.&nbsp; The only reason I thought of it tonight is because last week, I ran into my neighbor Pia from upstairs who told me that she noticed how clumsy she'd become the last couple of days and observed that it always happens before her period.&nbsp; Tonight I opened the box for my new desk lamp and as I was taking it out of the styrofoam it slipped right out of my hands and broke into 8 or 9 unsalvagable pieces.&nbsp; It was one of those cool lamps where you adjust the setting by touching it's base.&nbsp; $20.00 in the trash can.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; At least I didn't step on the glass. &nbsp; Anyway, I realized that I am PMS 'ing and that I've been a little clumsy lately.&nbsp; I recall that it seems to happen every month around this time and now I too have made the connection. &nbsp; So. .&nbsp;. ladies. . .does this happen to you too?

 This reader was upset by my criticizing Ozzy for comparing George Bush to Hitler and wrote me an extremely lengthy response, one that was too big to fit into the comment section. &nbsp; Let me know what you think!!!&nbsp; He or she is hard to argue with but I'm sure you will find a way. &nbsp; ================================== &nbsp; The Hitler references are based upon the definition of fascism, which is essentially an extreme form of nationalism that rejects individual freedom, individual liberalism, democracy, and the limitations on the state.&nbsp; &nbsp; It developed as a product of economic and political crisis of the years following WW I.&nbsp; Units called fasci di combatti-mento (combat groups) were established to oppose communism.&nbsp; Fascism protected the existing social order by forcible-suppression of working class movements, and provided scapegoats for popular anger against immigrants - Jews, foreigners and Blacks.&nbsp; It was also a way to prepare the citizenry for the economic and psychological mobilization of war.&nbsp; &nbsp; (Replace Jew with Arab and you have the definition of the present state of US affairs.) &nbsp; "The Fascist conception of life," Mussolini wrote, "stresses the importance of the State and accepts the individual only in so far as his interests coincide with the State. It is opposed to classical liberalism [which] denied the State in the name of the individual; Fascism reasserts the rights of the State as expressing the real essence of the individual."Mussolini thought it was unnatural for a government to protect individual rights: "The maxim that society exists only for the well-being and freedom of the individuals composing it does not seem to be in conformity with nature's plans." "If classical liberalism spells individualism," Mussolini continued, "Fascism spells government." &nbsp; The essence of fascism is that government is the master and the citizen is the slave.&nbsp; It is exactly what has happened in the United States.&nbsp; The people who say, ?It can?t happen here, this is America,? have deliberately blinded themselves to reality.&nbsp; There is no freedom of the press, no right to assembly, no right to a public trial with appropriate legal representation, no freedom from religion, no right to privacy, no right to elect your own President (the Electoral College is non-democratic).&nbsp; You do not have the right to free thought as evidenced by hate crime laws.&nbsp; (A crime is a crime, regardless of the reasons it was commissioned.)&nbsp; You are forced under threat of jail and seizure of assets to hand the government a huge portion of your sweat to pay for wars and debts that you and your children did not authorize.&nbsp;&nbsp; You are not allowed to step foot of federal or national lands (which serve as secured collateral for our foreign ? only foreign - debt) without permission from the government.&nbsp; You may not start a business, paint your house, or raise your children without government permission of some type.&nbsp; Worst of all, you are not allowed to say no to war.&nbsp; Well, you can, but most people have already been brainwashed into thinking they have no choice, living in fear that their plasma TVs and SUVs will be taken away if they exercise their conscience.&nbsp; &nbsp; Should Bush be compared to Hitler?&nbsp; Well, Hitler would probably be offended by the statement because he was far smarter than Bush.&nbsp; Hitler rebuilt an economy after the Weimer hyperinflation, liked animals (Bush used to put firecrackers in living frogs and watch them explode), and he was well-read.&nbsp; But there are too many parallels to the rise of the Nazi Party and what has happened here, namely with the 9-11 Reichstag fire.&nbsp; &nbsp; ?When Germany awoke, a man's home was no longer his castle. He could be seized by private individuals, could claim no protection from the police, could be indefinitely detained without preferment of charges; his property could be seized, his verbal and written communications overheard and perused; he no longer had the right to foregather with his fellow countrymen, and his newspapers might no longer freely express their opinions.? ? Douglas Reed, writing about the Reichstag fire. &nbsp; It was reported by Jane?s (March 2001), India Reacts (May 2001) and the BBC (June 2001) that the United States would attack Afghanistan in mid-October 2001, ostensibly on behalf of Enron, which needed to run a large natural gas pipeline through Afghanistan for their Indian operations.&nbsp; The first troops in Afghanistan received their orders at the end of June, 2001.&nbsp;&nbsp; So just how is it that Bush, who was left untouched by the Secret Service after the second plane hit the tower (while Cheney was literally carried to the bunker by the SS in Washington), knew that Osama bin Laden was involved?&nbsp; Have you seen the proof?&nbsp; FBI Director Mueller stated on two occasions that there was no physical evidence linking the alleged hijackers to the attacks.&nbsp; None.&nbsp; Nada.&nbsp; So what about those wills, passports, and flight manuals from the set of a bad B-movie?&nbsp; Military fighter pilots have stated that only an experienced pilot to hold up to the G forces of a 270-degree turn made by the plane that hit the Pentagon.&nbsp; Cell phones do not work at 28,000 feet, especially over rural farm areas without cell towers.&nbsp; A man in a cave did not make NORAD stand down.&nbsp; The laws of physics were not suspended when the towers collapsed.&nbsp; Numerous eyewitnesses, including firemen, said bombs went off prior to the collapse, which is also indicated when looking at the seismatic history just before the towers collapsed.&nbsp; There is no way a person can look at all the evidence and not come to the obvious realization that 9-11 was a present day Reichstag, a lie that has killed tens of thousands (and we have only just begun).&nbsp; Check out http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/ if you want to know who benefited from the attacks.&nbsp; It was not Muslims, Afghanistan, or the Middle East.&nbsp;&nbsp; Furthermore, disruption of the American economy has a significant negative effect on the economies of oil-producing nations, most of which have no way to feed their populations without the sale of this commodity.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Interestingly enough, Bush benefited directly from the Nazis.&nbsp; His grandfather, Prescott, was cited for Trading with the Enemy Act (designed specifically to stop Bush, Harriman and Thyssen), as Prescott was a business partner of the architect of the Nazi war machine, supplying goods and raw materials to Germany.&nbsp; There is evidence that Prescott Bush benefited from the slave labor of the work camps holding not only Jews, but as many or more individuals Hitler deemed inferior for race, physical or mental disabilities, or religion.&nbsp; The money earned from the aid to the Nazis was used to put George H.W. into politics and has provided the family fortunes that George W. has come to depend on for his existence, aside from the money he stole from taxpayers and investors through his insider trades.&nbsp; There is an interesting outline of the family history at http://www.geocities.com/bushfamilynazis/ , but a Google search will reveal hundreds of sites that have documented the Bush family Nazi past.&nbsp; If there was a free press in America, you wouldn?t have to search the Internet for bombshells like this. &nbsp; It?s interesting to note the hypocrisy of those who condemn Ozzie for speaking his mind.&nbsp; Why is okay for you to criticize Ozzy in a public forum, and yet you are criticizing Ozzy for speaking out in a public forum?&nbsp; You can?t have it both ways. &nbsp; I am especially bristled by people who say that Bush-Hitler comparisons are extreme, especially when many&nbsp;people saying this have admitted that they are virtually clueless when it comes to history and current events.&nbsp; I had to read Mein Kampf as part of my graduate work.&nbsp; Most people have never read it, assuming it is a blueprint for the concentration camps, when in reality Jews are barely mentioned in the book.&nbsp; He doesn?t mention their extermination, but he does address their control over the media, arts, banking, and business, and that in itself was merely relation of fact.&nbsp; The Jews owned most of Germany, despite their relatively small population.&nbsp; But this is not a defense of ?Mein Kampf?; I mention it because the book outlines how he was able to seize control of German society, and most of his power struggle has been mirrored verbatim by Bush and company.&nbsp; Mein Kampf is a primer on how to become a dictator.&nbsp; The most important reason for reading it is to prevent fascism from rearing its ugly head.&nbsp; But as the clich goes, if we don?t study history, we are doomed to repeat it.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; "I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator," said Adolf Hitler. &nbsp; "God told me to strike at Al Qa'ida and I struck them. And then he instructed me to strike at Saddam, which I did. With the might of God on our side we will triumph," said George Bush.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

 urlLink Ahnold seems to be resorting to childish reverse psychology tactics, daring Democrats to pass his budget by accusing them of being "girlie men".&nbsp; &nbsp; Not only is he offending just about everybody and&nbsp;blatantly plagiarizing that ridiculous SNL skit where Dana Carvey and the other guy&nbsp;played too&nbsp;"dumbbells", &nbsp;he's proving that he is incapable of bringing people to his point of view through the good old fashioned use of debate. &nbsp; I think that's a little scary. &nbsp; Here is a urlLink little bit &nbsp;from&nbsp;an article I found&nbsp;on VOANews.com: But a Schwarzenegger spokesman says the comment was the governor's way of saying that legislators are "wimps" (weaklings) by giving into special interest groups.&nbsp;

 Did anyone watch last night?s heart pounding episode of SIX FEET UNDER? It begs the question, what is going on with Alan Ball and his writing staff?&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; If you have been watching SIX FEET UNDER from the beginning, like me you?ve probably come to expect a certain amount of sex and death.&nbsp; As my friend and neighbor pointed out to me, that is what the show is about&nbsp;- sex and death as experienced through the eyes of the fictitious Fisher family around who the show is based.&nbsp; Every week the show basically follows the same format: a random person dies creating the backdrop for the unveiling of the show/s various serial dramas.&nbsp; The 10 or 15 minute vignettes bounce between the characters, slowly revealing Alan Ball's master story telling, full of wit, sarcasm, social commentary, strong character development, symbolism and just plain old weirdness.&nbsp; Each vignette ends with a fade to white instead of a fade to black.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Imagine my surprise, last night, when the show broke with it's own format and focused 40 minutes on the perilous adventure of one of the more beloved characters on the show.&nbsp; The character was put in danger and viewers like me were treated to the most suspenseful 40 minutes in the history of HBO's serial dramas. &nbsp; Definitely tune in if you can, when it is on next and definitely refrain from commenting on any plot points until next week to not ruin it for anyone else.

 I moved into the apartment across the hall.&nbsp; Instead of a studio, I now&nbsp;live in&nbsp;a one bedroom apartment.&nbsp; Instead of viewing a wall every time I look out the window, I now look out on the street.&nbsp; Instead of darkness, there is light.&nbsp; Instead of cave dwelling, I am living on an open plain.&nbsp; Instead of having to eat sitting Indian style on my bed, I can now enjoy meals prepared by me in my new eat in kitchen. &nbsp; I have gone from college style dorm living to living like a legitimate grown up. &nbsp; I am in the best mood today. &nbsp;

 As I told you Saturday, July 3, was a miserably hot day in Washington DC and somehow, in spite of my near heat exhaustion, I managed to keep pace with Jon as we visited the beautiful memorials and statutary tributes all over the mall. I have collected some photographic information that I'm going to use in a future posting about the FDR memorial. But for right now, I want to tell you about the Waffle Shop. We started our Sunday eager for more of DC's sites so we headed over to the Ford Theater. Neither of us had been to this neighborhood before so we did not know where to go for breakfast. We were walking down 10th street, looking at our guide book when out of nowhere popped this guy named George with SAM. I'm not sure what SAM stands for but he works for the city giving tourists advice on how to get where. He told us that the Waffle Shop was just up ahead. So we were looking and looking for a diner. As silly as it sounds I was surprised to find that the restaurant was actually called the WAFFLE SHOP . &nbsp; To make a short story long, we had a cool waitress and we enjoyed the food a whole lot.&nbsp; There was&nbsp; a greater story in there that I wanted to relate, but too much time has passed.&nbsp; I've lost the immediacy of the feeling to write about our great waitress, the colorful patrons and the funny newspaper review hanging on the wall which describes the place as too modern for Mary Todd Lincoln who probably would have not liked the 1940's style counters. &nbsp; Or to write about the record breaking torrential rain that fell that day, our experience at Ford Theater including my joke about the John Wilkes PHONE Booths, so named by me because they were designed to seem authentic to the rebuilt theater with wooden keys; including how our Park Ranger kept referring to the Civil War as WWII during her prepared statement about the Lincoln Assassination; and how we thoroughly enjoyed our trip to the National gallery where we saw the famous painting of urlLink A Woman Holding a Balance by Vermeer and an true to life urlLink DaVinci painting .

 The temptation to blog all day has been greatly heightened by BLOGGER's new formatting keys.

 A few years ago, urlLink Caren Lissner took four weeks off from her regular job to observe teenagers as they are today as of three years ago.&nbsp; She learned that they are not much different than when she was a teenager.

 Thank you Matthew Drudge for some more good reporting. (no sarcasm intended, hopefully none understood). On today's urlLink Drudge Report , MD has started an urlLink article discussing Ozzy Osbourne's stage show at Jones Beach where as part of the show, Ozzy plays a film montage comparing George W. to Adolf Hitler. Of course, I support Ozzy's right to free speech. He is certainly entitled to criticize President Bush as is Michael Moore. So naturally, I hope others support my right to criticize the President's critics. Again, I am not a fan of President Bush. I don't like the fact that that his strong religious beliefs seem to influence every decision he makes and that doesn't sound very objective to me or like he's separating church and state, especially in the area of reproduction rights. I don't like the fact that people are able to come up with conspiracy theories about him because where there is smoke there is fire. I don't like that many of his decisions seem to favor big business or lobbies that I don't necessarily agree with. With that said, I don't know enough about any of the above to really, publicly come out against the President so I'm not. I can say though that based on the above that I don't trust him and I don't like him and that I'm not voting for him. However, I also would not compare him to HITLER. To do so is irresponsible and disrespectful of Hitler's actual victims. George Bush is not killing his own people to make a pure and superior race of his choosing. He is not murdering political dissidents or exterminating physically and mentally disabled individuals. Nor is he imprisoning gays or conducting medical experiments on twins. Shame on you Ozzy. You grew up in post WWII England. You know about fucking Nazis and you know Bush isn't one.

 I am a winner. I have licked smoking. I had no cravings yesterday. It's done. I am no longer a smoker. So what if the cravings have been replaced by free floating anxiety. That's okay. That's why God made heroine.

 I extend a special thanks to urlLink Candy Blue Kite . First, for pointing me in the direction of a great site that lets you draw yourself as an urlLink anime character . You can find that link on her site or back a few space. Secondly, for providing me with the Southpark version of Val which was on my site earlier this week. Candy IS fun!!!!

 Here is a urlLink link to MICHAEL MOORE, UGLY AMERICAN by Jeffrey Morley for the Washington Post. In this article, Morley discusses Pete Townshend's reaction to what Townshend perceives as Moore's bullying him into using his "Won't Get Fooled Again" in the Farenheit 9/11 soundtrack. Here is a bit from the article: "I greatly resent being bullied and slurred by him just because he didn't get what we wanted from me," Townshend told urlLink Ireland Online . Moore wanted Townshend's rock anthem "Won't Get Fooled Again" for use on the soundtrack of his anti-Bush documentary film, "Fahrenheit 9/11." Townshend refused, saying he thought Moore's previous movies amounted to "bullying." In response, Townshend said that Moore accused him of being a war supporter. Townshend says Moore's attitude was evocative of President Bush's war on terrorism credo: if you're not with me, you're against me. It's an interesting article which I of course am posting, because parts of Morley's discussion support my stance that Moore is being anti-American. I also post it because for every article that supports Moore's movie there seems to be one against it. VIVA LA DEBATE!!!!!

 Today is Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday . . .ARGH!!!!! I woke up feeling like I needed a cigarette. The feeling has been waxing and waning all morning. Right now, it's a soft craving. I'm trying to put it out of my head. It's not like I'm not busy, or like I don't have activities to distract me. The activities just aren't engrossing enough. I'm working on the second of my three installments about my trip to DC. It's almost done. The last intallment will be my critique of the FDR memorial on the mall. It will have pictures so look forward to that. Someone is smoking on my building's fire escape and I can smell it from my desk. It smells both disgusting and delicious. What is wrong with me? I continue to receive support from my friends and family for quitting smoking. It's really the only time people will encourage you to be a quitter if you think about it. My family didn't rally behind me when I quit piano lessons, nor did I receive a lot of support when I tried to drop my History of the Civil War class in my third year of college. Anyway, that's all I have to say for right now.

 My inner demon took a break yesterday. I didn't experience any cravings. While I was bothered by the heat during my frisbee match in Central Park with Jon, I still wasn't bothered by an urge to smoke. Last night, while watching Shakespeare in the Park, I was a non-smoker, as if I had never smoked before, as if I never became addicted, as if I never started smoking, really smoking in college. Where were the challenges this weekend? Well, the big challenge was on Saturday facing the day alone. To combat my strong craving, which seemed to pick up around 1:30 pm where it had left off from my incredible craving of the day before, I employed myself in the most inane activity. I surrounded myself with the other shoppers on Steinway Street and spent three hours walking up and down two blocks of stores, looking at things and stretching $20.00 as far as one can possibly stretch it. The distraction worked. I was tired enough by the time I got home that I could nap, then get ready to go out and then face my next big challenge which was going to a party at a bar. Luckily for me, none of the attendees were smokers so there was no one to follow outside, there was no one to tempt me with their deliciously smoky smells and there was no way I was going to walk up a flight of stairs just to buy cigarettes. Anyway, I made it through another weekend without smoking. I rock!!!

 Yesterday, was the hardest of the days I have spent not smoking. From 11 a.m. up until I fell asleep last night, I experienced the worst craving of the non-smoking experience. I woke up this morning feeling free yet again of my addiction and I hope this feeling lasts. I am resolved not to smoke, which means I am resolved to endure all cravings to come no matter how painful. I know the pain will not kill me. It just really sucks, is all.

 (The unofficial story about the below is that the intensified heat sucked all the joy out of the experience for me, all the solemnity, all the awe. . .it was just too f-ing hot and I couldn't get out of that plaza fast enough.) Officially . . . Over the Fourth of July weekend, Jon and I visited Washington DC. The first memorial we saw (aside from the towering Washington Monument which can be seen from practically everywhere) was the WWII Memorial. Here is a picture of Memorial Plaza. As you can see, it is made of solid white stone. It's beautiful and moving. Memorial Plaza is divided in two parts, each representing a different theater of the war. Along the walls at eye level are bas reliefs depicting various scenes from various battles, all very sad, all honoring the great efforts of those who lived and died in what many consider to be the last great war. The taller posts, that resemble either columns or headstones are simply decorated with one wreath, under which is printed the name of each state or country (depending on whether it was in Atlantic or Pacific section). We arrived on Saturday, which was a hot and hazy day. At the WWII Memorial, strolling with the other tourist amidst all that sunshine and white stone was like crawling inside of an oven. You can see the water in the photograph. Picture mobs of people cooling themselves off in that water. I thought about going in myself but remembered that germs often do well in water and was worried about getting some kind of skin eating bacteria in addition to a few more freckles.

 For those of you who have been following my life's dramas, you may recall that I stopped smoking last week on Tueday. Aside from a few slips, I am still not smoking.

 That's what I'd like to see. A movie that doesn't pander to the NPR totebag crowds shuttling edamame home to their mud-compact homes in V-4 Saabs. One that has an answer every time the SUV-driving, fried-children-eating, baby-seal-beating Republicans say "But what about..." In stead we get a movie meant to make liberals feel good about themselves. The above is a snippet taken from urlLink THE FILTHY CRITIC 's review of Michael Moore's Farenheit 9/11 now playing in theaters. This critique strengthens my resolve not to see urlLink Farenheit 9/11 .

 urlLink Marlon Brando died. I'll never forget his timeless performance in Porgy & Bess, or the time he saved a small village from near starvation by not eating at any of their homes.

 I love to sing-a About the moon-a and the June-a and the spring-a, I love to sing-a, About a sky of blue-a, or a tea for two-a, Anything-a with a swing-a to an "I love you-a," I love to, I love to sing!

 Not surprisingly, urlLink Michael Moore's movie is likely to become the first imported documentary in China. So, I ask you. . . if this documentary comes out strongly and convincingly against our Government, should this film be seen in countries that are looking for any excuse to annihilate us?

 urlLink The Anonymous Blogger is pandering for comments. That's sad. urlLink The Anonymous Blogette pleads with her coupled up friends to be on the lookout for single friends that would be good romantic matchups. urlLink Wes has been watching the urlLink New Cutey Honey which I'm guessing is Japanimation. urlLink Candy Blue Kite expresses herself and well. urlLink Caren woke urlLink up , got dressed and linked to some information about a hurricane/tropical storm. urlLink Dawn is back from her vacation. urlLink Evil Twin Theory is teasing us with his first few short entries in over a month. urlLink George Takei presents his essay "Seattle: The Crucible of Imagination". urlLink Human Oddities' Amanda has been on a roll. She's been writing a lot. Her observations continue to entertain us. urlLink Phil sums up last evening's activities and gets a little political. urlLink Sarah continues to be cute. urlLink Vidiot continues to post good links. urlLink Violently Executed Blog's Adam and his wife celebrate the one year birthday of their son and are paying attention to the terror alerts. urlLink Wendy is coming to urlLink New York City over Labor Day Weekend !!! Hoorah!!!

 At 2:45 pm in New York City, the sky is almost black and rain is falling hard. At 2:15 pm it was a little overcast. This storm came in fast and furious and is causing a lot of excitement in my office as we watch the skies darken. But even as hard as the rain is falling, it can't compare to the hardness of my next decision. What am I going to eat for lunch? Answer: I don't know, but I am taking suggestions.

 It is Wednesday and the work week trudges on. I have been assigned a mailing of 100 pieces. It is the oven mitt mailing. Don't ask. I already put together 100 boxes last week. Today, I was told to affix the specially designed lables, get this . . . are you ready? . . . nice and straight . That was literally part of the directions for getting this mailing done. I received these instructions by email where someone else was copied. It's a little humiliating. I'm looking forward to the job where I don't have to label or stuff anything. On the fun side of life, last night I co-hosted trivia with the seasoned veteran Jonathan Bloomfield. There was a good turnout by the way of 10 teams, I'd say at least 70 people showed up. Granted the turnout wasn't as good as when Sarah and Caren hosted together but it was good none the less. Funniest team name. . . can't remember. Winning team . . .can't remember. I'm bad that way. But again, it was fun and I had a great time doing it. I'll be co-hosting again next week with Eric Kabakoff. Tonight I'm treating myself by going to a turkish bath. I won't say where to protect my privacy but I'm going with a girlfriend and I imagine we are going to have a great time. Well, back to the salt mines. I've got to go label 100 boxes, nice and straight.

 I wonder what urlLink this play is about. According to the article, [insert name of play] is being staged at an undisclosed Manhattan location. If you go to the middle of 10th street between Avenues A and B, agents will then take you to the show. You must arrive at least 30 minutes before show time. That sounds like the usual walk-in schedule to me for most plays and I bet the theater is in the middle of 10th Street between Avenues A and B.

 Today is Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday It will be fun day, fun day All day long . . . . . .and all night long too at the Baggot Inn when you come down to Tuesday Night Trivia. Tonight I am co hosting with Jonathan B. not my Jon B., but an other. It will be nice to see you there.

 In a surprise move today, urlLink Laura Bush came out in support of her husband's policy on embryonic stem cell research. Honk twice if this is news to you.

 As of August 6, Rantings of a Gen X Misanthrope is officially one year old. Here is my first urlLink post .

 I am reading a book by Paul Fussell called urlLink Bad or, the Dumbing of America . I am enjoying this book because he eloquently put into words why so many things in America are stupid for not so obvious reasons. His book gives credence to my cynical attitude about various institutions and the people and crap they turn out. If Mr. Fussell googles himself, I hope he finds this post. Thank you for writing your book. It's a relief to learn that I am not some weird, societal black sheep with an arrogant attitude looking down on the dopes around me.

 If I click my heels three times and repeatedly chant, there's no day like Friday, there's no day like Friday, do you think I will move forward in time to 5:15 Friday afternoon? Yeah. I didn't think so.

 Hey Ladies!! Check out who is " urlLink cruising " for a new wife.

 Trivia was packed last night. Hats off to young urlLink Ms. urlLink Ackerman for doing a great job co-hosting for the first time. Her questions really excited the crowd and got people talking. Perhaps it's Ms. Ackerman's teaching background or perhaps she is just a skilled speaker . . .she provided solid back up to the main host urlLink Caren Lissner , who is back on stage after a few weeks away from hosting. We were on the winning team , which I named "Paris is Bruising" per a recommendation by Phil that we make fun of Ms. Hilton somehow. Playing with me were Barry, Bob, urlLink Claire , Eric, urlLink Phil , and Robert the Republican. Claire and Phil were first time trivia players and I was very happy to have them with us on the team. They contributed throughout the game but ran the Top Ten list which helped put us over the top at the end. In a personal best, this was the first team I've gathered that scored so unbelievably high. In the second round out of a possible 20 points we scored 19. I won't say why we missed the 20th question, but you can read about it urlLink here . I also played against two other great bloggers, urlLink Candy Blue Kite and urlLink akachris both of whom I link to and both whom were worthy opponents. I particularly enjoyed the audio round last night. Ms. Lissner provided 10 snippets from famous songs from American musicals and when answering we saw that she arranged them alphabetically. Definitely fun and my favorite audio round yet from the year or so I've been playing trivia.

 Today is Tuesday and it's back to work time at the salt mines. Having the day off was priceless. Jon and I got a lot done and had a lot of fun doing it. Because of our work schedules the only full day off we have together is Sunday. Monday was a bonus, an extra, a treat and romantic. I won't bore you with the seemingly mundane and together activities that occupied most of our time but I will tell you about two fun things we did. We set up the home entertainment center and watched an episode of the Simpsons from the 4th season DVD. It was lady's choice and I chose the episode called "I Love Lisa" where Ralph Wiggums develops a crush on Lisa because she gives him a pity valentine with a picture of a train and the words "I Choo Choo Choose You". Aside from being a tremendously sweet episode, it introduces Ralph as Chief Wiggums son, gives us a President's Day pageant with the children of Springfield paying homage to our nation's mediocre Presidents in a song and dance number which is funny on "so many levels", it features some great details regarding Krusty and his show giving the writers an opportunity to satirzie Carson and the talk show format. . . .of course I can go on but then I'd be telling you how to enjoy the Simpsons instead of letting you enjoy it on your own. We also saw Thunderbirds, the live action version directed by Jonathan Frakes. Too much cheese to write about in this post. I'll give you more later.

 Today is Monday, Monday . . . . Hey, wait a second. . . .Today is Monday and I have Monday off!!!! Yay!!!! Wahoo!!! Yippeeee!!!!! The move went well. All of Jon's stuff is in. It's officially official. We picked up a couple of great pieces from my parents on the Island and they followed us back to the city to help us unload. My friend and neighbor helped with a particularly large piece of furniture, "in the speed of light, he arrives just in time." We were pretty wiped out last night. We were also pretty out of touch. We didn't find out until dinner time that the terror alert was not only on orange but underlined as well. I guess that really does justify the defense budget afterall. Sometimes I think the terror alerts were designed to convince people why we need to spend money on the military. I also thing the timing of the underlined orange alert is conveniently juxtaposed agaisnt the backdrop of the Republican Convention, but that's just me. I could be over thinking things. I'm going to go to the post office now and pick up the baby mug mugs.
