 And to give our readers a sense of historical perspective try this urlLink article on the Kingdom of Northumbria from the urlLink North East History site. If you have a read of that you will see the extent of this once mighty kingdom. We want self determination - fsck this Regional Assembly idea though. Reinstate Northumbria!

 With our plan to reclaim Northumbria well under way some of us who are not from the Newcastle area could use urlLink this . It also may be helpful for our US readers. :) How about a reclaim Northumbria icon?

 New icons for usage. That's 3 (Dibnah, Mr T &amp; Science) from Bungers and 1 (toon) from Merg. Have I missed any? I've also changed the search box to use Feedster. This searches the feeds for a site rather than the site itself which has 2 major advantages over Google: Results always point at post (either the new permalink style or the old) and not just to an archive page. Our posts seem get into the Feedster search database quicker than they did with Google.

 Yet more footie - who said it was the close season? This time it's not in urlLink Burundi but in Peru &amp; Newcastle. urlLink Bellavista Juventud was set up in Iquitos and is run by a pit yakker priest called Father Joe Plumb. Finances are tight so the Bellavista Social Club has been set up to help provide funds for strips &amp; equipment. This club is based in Newcastle and can count the best Peruvian footballer (evar) amongst it's members. They had their inaugural night out in the urlLink Egypt Cottage which is just around the corner from here. We could have went to that for our second night out! BykerSink, over at urlLink Space Hardware , has something to do with the blog so expect Billy Brag lyrics with added pan pipes. Or Something.

 We've all heard the story of how Pele couldn't afford a football when he was younger so he played with a tennis ball which helped to nurture his fantastic skills. These lads in Burundi can't even afford a tennis ball - so they have to go to the urlLink local rubbish tip for plastic bags with which they make themselves a football. So if playing with a tennis ball turns you in urlLink Edson Arantes do Nascimento then these kids should be very skilful. via urlLink Bifurcated Rivets .

 If you log in to the urlLink Blogger dashboard you will find the GMail invite is back. So you should be able to: Sign up and get your GMail address + 2 invites Go to urlLink GMailSwap Profit We'll have none of those ????? steps to profit on New Links! And I didn't say 'Google announces GMail' once. Bugger. And in other news that Merg may be interested in - I've fixed the Javascript so it works in urlLink Mozilla now. It did work before I added the new template but when I put the code into the new template I just assumed it would work. Silly me. I fixed it at the weekend with the help of Firefox's cool Javascript console so you should now have a new comment count, clickable date links to urlLink Wikipedia and the icon changing code for cut &amp; paste icon goodness. I think that's worth a picture of Times Square! ;)

 urlLink Piper confirmed to play Dr. Who's sidekick. I saw her in Canterbury Tales. The little Minx.

 Apparently we aren't urlLink checking our 'nads enough to prevent testicular cancer . Well I don't know who's scores have been combined with mine for averaging but they must never check as I check as often as I possibly can. At least that's what I normally tell the police anyway. Interesting factette buried away in that article. It seems men are at increasing risk of breast cancer. I suspect this is just a sneaky way we men use to get male cancer research spending increased. I don't know numbers off the top of my head (so I could be talking complete rubbish here) but I remember reading that many more men die of testicular cancer than women die of breast cancer yet breast cancer treatment funding is significantly higher than that of testicular cancer. I blame these wimmin's groups. New Links says 'Equal opportunities for bollocks'! This place is turning into the fscking urlLink Lancet . I'm off to find some 8008135.

 Actually, you may be in for a solution. New Scientist reports that it's risky and some say it shouldn't be done, but that isn't stopping a team of US surgeons preparing to carry out the world's first face transplant. More news as and when I can find it. Insert gag about face being rejected, because you're so ugly. I think this one has the legs to run and run... just remember, you heard about it first at New Links! Note to mmC : I think we need the science icon promoted to the sidebar...

 Here's a nice story from our buddies in Amsterdam. A thief broke into the offices of a charity without realising it. So he wrote an apologetic urlLink letter saying he was really sorry.

 Check it out fatties bariatrics! All you need is a DDR machine! urlLink Video Game Fans Dance Off Extra Pounds Edit : I've decided to combine the fruit icon with the science icon for all the urlLink bariatric stories on New Links. That's because fruit is good for you. You should be eating five portions of fruit and vegetables every day to stay healthy. If you're fat urlLink bariatric you're probably not eating enough fruit, and you're deffo not doing enough exercise. See...? Isn't the tinternet useful? You want proof? urlLink Carmen Electra eats lots of fruit. urlLink Fatty here doesn't. Actually, I just found this, and it reflects a serious point that I could be trying to get across.

 mmChronic and I saw a mystery object floating up the Tyne the other day. And no, it wasn't a brown shark, as it flowed against the tide. We figure it was a sea monster. Anyways, the Sea Monster was floating past a place where there used to be an island called urlLink Kings Meadows . The Island existed until the 1860's, until it was dredged to allow shipping upriver, and bigger ships to be launched from the yards on the Newcastle side of the Tyne. What price progress, eh? We would've had another pub to go to at lunchtime if it wasn't for those pesky industrialists! "this area was a rural riverscape, the main feature being the King's Meadows a 30 acre island. Complete with a Pub, the Countess of Coventry, the island was a popular festival venue for horse racing and regattas and the landlady kept cows to supply the village of Elswick with milk." It's where they used to have the Blaydon Races you know? Fascinating facts... ;)

 This is an urlLink abandoned town in Japan called Gunkanjima . in 1810 this town was created on a reef due to the discovery of coal. As the waste from the mines came out the reefs got bigger. Eventually the town was abandoned in 1974 due to the mines being exhausted. Next New Links trip? If we win the lottery maybe. After our fondness for urban, industrial archaeology demonstrated by our trip to the Byker Cully ( urlLink here - maybe we should have done the pictures in B&amp;W for that arty vibe!) and Victoria Tunnel (still lost in Bungers' mind) this one is a natural. via urlLink Boing Boing .

 Because he enjoyed the urlLink Da Vinci code so much he might be interested in the urlLink news of a talk that Dan Brown gave . The sequel is about Free Masons and is set in Washington. I wonder if it'll explain the urlLink masonic symbols on the US Dollar . The article doesn't say when it'd due but apparently there is a clue on the cover of the urlLink Da Vinci code which gives some information about the new book. He also said he left out what he felt would be the most controversial plot device - not for fear of it's controversy but because he felt it was &quot;flimsy&quot;. So what was so controversial? He was going to have Jesus surviving the crucifuxion. Which reminds me of something I've been trying to find out for ages. I remember reading a sci-fi book as a fairly young child (9-10) where a Jewish scientist goes back in time, discovers Jesus is a retard and takes his place. He then goes through lots of the things mentioned in the Bible and ultimately gets crucified. Does anyone know what this book is and who wrote it? via urlLink boingboing

 urlLink New Feature ? But it's an old picture from our urlLink Byker Cully report . It's the 1st picture that came to hand when testing our New Feature&trade;. Blogger have introduced photoblogging now. So what does photoblogging mean to we New Linkers? Well I could pretend it's all about riding the cutting edge of blogging and that we are hip, trendy urlLink Generation Xers . But that would be silly. The reason it is going to get used here is of paramount importance to the net's premier cheapskates - it means FREE hi-res image storage! YAY! A urlLink full tutorial is available at Blogger. But the basic premise is download and install a chat gizmo called urlLink Hello , choose send picture, then choose BloggerBot as the recipient. You will then get an option screen for resizing,captioning etc. Once you have done that, choose publish to blog and off it goes. The picture is published as a thumbnail which is a link through to the full size picture. When resizing images for the thumbnail choose one of the two smaller sizes for publishing as the largest size will probably screw the layout of the page. As for the size of the stored hi-res image choose the largest. After all we aren't paying for the hosting! ;) CAVEAT: I haven't looked at privacy implications yet re spyware etc as I had to have a fiddle with it straight away. I'll be going back to the Hello page to have a read soon. ps. Bungers was going to have a look at this and write something but there are several reasons I've done it instead.

 Remember urlLink Ship Of Fools who we featured regarding their urlLink 11th Commandment compo ? Well they launched an urlLink online virtual church last week. How did we miss that one? Unfortunately it has already been swamped with people logging in as Satan and swearing their heads off! The church is partly intended for people on the edges (and beyond them) of faith, so please be aware that the language and behaviour in church is often colourful and occasionally offensive. Please bear with us ? this is an experiment and we're working on creative solutions to the problem of mischievous visitors. Church of Fools is currently not suitable for children. Apparently moderators have been equipped with a 'smite' button! This urlLink article at CNN has more on the disruption. I thought CNN was supposed to be a serious news source? If so how can they say that someone who logs in with a legitimate username &amp; password is a 'hacker'? I've just logged into Blogger so I'm presumably a hacker now. I'm off to get a job as a security expert.

 Hands up everyone who immediately mentally pictured a scene involving North Shields Fish Quay and horny handed sailors? You can relax because it's nothing like that.

 I've just been on the urlLink bStats site which is Blogger's stats stuff for BlogSpot Plus users. Except it isn't. The page says that it is only for the premium service users yet I've just logged in, got my blog list and added the code to the New Links template. It works. Yay! We are currently using urlLink StatCounter which is a really good free stats service with data drill downs by country, referrer etc. The only problem with it is that the free service only keeps the details for the last 100 hits. The bStats service looks like it keeps everything as there are pages to see most popular page of the day, week, month and year. There isn't as much info available in the stats but the fact it keeps the info for longer means it may ultimately end up the better stats to use for New Links. The bStats front page has this bit on it: NOTE: bSTATS is currently free for Blog*Spot Plus users (hey, by the way, upgrade!) and not available for anyone else. If everything goes well, it will be available for others in the near future. So are they preparing to roll it out for free to Blogger users now or have they simply left the back door open? I don't know so I've left the StatCounter code in place for now just in case the 'free' bStats gets pulled for whatever reason. EDIT: I forgot to mention I found the bStats site via a post about bStats' temporary unavailability on the urlLink Blogger Service Status page.

 All the new features added by Blogger in their redesign have improved the design of the blogs no end with urlLink lots of benefits for those who have switched over. We implemented all the things mentioned in that article within hours of the redesign being launched and have been adding further hacks since. I've been meaning to write how-to posts for quite a while now and have finally got around to doing one. What with this and the long fabled Victoria Tunnel report allegedly coming on the same day you must be looking out of the window for the flying pigs now. The first hack to be written up is the On This Day hack. That's because it is the simplest one to do, and by extension, the easiest for me to write up. So what does this hack do? Can you see the date at the top of the page? You'll notice it's a clickable link. The interesting bit is what it links to - the On This Day page at urlLink Wikipedia which has famous events, births, deaths and observed holidays from around the world all of which are linked to good articles on the subject. So for the effort of inserting a little bit of code in your template you automatically get a link of the day style thing for every day you publish a post. Note that you don't need to be using the new designs to use this hack - it works equally well on the old templates too. Onto the hack itself. The first stage is to ensure your dates are in the correct format. To do this go to the urlLink dashboard and then go to Settings / Formatting as shown here. Set the date this format: Set the date language to English. Mine is English UK but any of the English options should work. Save your changes. Now we are going to edit the template to put the JavaScript code in to do the date linking. Before you start you should back up your current template just in case there are any problems when you are implementing it. Done that? OK. Copy the following code and paste it just before the &lt;/HEAD&gt; tag in your template. &lt;script type="text/javascript" language="javascript"&gt; function WikiOnThisDay(dateToMangle) { var dateChunk_array1=dateToMangle.split(", "); var dateChunk_array2=dateChunk_array1[1].split(" "); if(dateChunk_array2[1].charAt(0)=="0") dateChunk_array2[1]=dateChunk_array2[1].charAt(1); return "&lt;a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/" + dateChunk_array2[0] + "_" + dateChunk_array2[1] + "\"&gt;" + dateToMangle + " &lt;small&gt;[Click it!]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/a&gt;"; } &lt;/script&gt; Now find this bit of code in your template... &lt;BlogDateHeader&gt; &lt;h2 class="date-header"&gt;&lt;$BlogDateHeaderDate$&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;/BlogDateHeader&gt; ...and replace it with this code. &lt;BlogDateHeader&gt; &lt;h2 class="date-header"&gt; &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt; document.write(WikiOnThisDay("&lt;$BlogDateHeaderDate$&gt;")); &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;/BlogDateHeader&gt; Save your changes. You can now either republish the blog to apply the changes to the whole blog or just wait until you post next to apply the changes to any new pages created. Feel free to use this code on your blog. If you do use it, it would be nice to get a mention and a linkback to urlLink this particular post would be even better so that other readers can see how to do it.

 Blobs have been washing up down Whitley Bay for many a year now, but recently scientists have been testing some of the real big ones like the urlLink Tasmanian west coast monster . Disappointingly, they've put preserved blob samples a series of tests, and researchers have confirmed that the "giant octopus of St Augustine" from 1896, two Bermuda blobs from the 1990s and the 1996 Nantucket blob are also just the washed-up remains of whales.

 Has the world gone mad? Not yet as I hear that UEFA are refusing to hold a minutes silence as a mark of respect for the England fan who was murdered this week. With all due respect to the deceased I have to say that it's completely ridiculous to even contemplate holding a "ceremony" at the beginning of an international football match simply because somebody who enjoyed football was murdered whilst on a football holiday. At least UEFA have shown some sanity but no doubt they will be criticised for it. And the England team will all wear black armbands tonight. Like they're in mourning. Yeah right.

 Today urlLink The Sun reports (is that an oxymoron?) that Wayne is the new Pele. In their "exclusive" interview Pele states "Roo is the new me". I have a few problems with this... First of all it just bugs me that Pele, as a world recognised ambassador for football, is succumbing to 30 years of everyone telling him how great he is. Any modesty he had is gone in favour of attending a never ending stream of parties under the nomenclature of "the greatest footballer ever" and it seems his analysis of football skills is strictly limited to comparing footballers to his own greatness. Secondly, Rooney is not as good as Pele and anyone who says otherwise, including Pele, is talking tosh. But urlLink Freddie Adu might be the real thing. Doh! If I can't resist the Pele comparison then what chance does Pele have?

 With the meaning of the word 'roasting' being redefined over the last year or so this bit on the urlLink BBC front page made me laugh. Unfortunately the urlLink linked article doesn't carry the same title so I had to screen grab this instead.

 I am unable to check out urlLink this link as I have no idea if it's SFW or not. Assuming it is what I think it is, that age old British sporting tradition of tying two people together and letting them kick seven shades out of each other's shins - but in the nuddie, then I think it would be a great way to solve the Group B qualification problem where England draw 0-0 with Croatia tonight and the Swiss beat France 4-0. Forget play-offs/penalty shoot outs/away goals/goals against etc and just tie Wayne Rooney to Thierry Henry and let them kick sh!t out of each other. My money's on Wayne. Edit: Link fixed and SFW

 I haven't actually been able to check out urlLink this link as it's currently suffering too many hits. So, until it works, we can ponder over the rumour that Bruce has turned down the urlLink 2.75 million bid in favour of staying with Birmingham. Whilst we're on about fitba can someone explain how England are automatically through to the next stage providing we draw against Croatia tonight? What if France lose to Switzerland? Wouldn't that leave us with three teams on four points? Assuming that scenario is resolved by counting goals scored then how can we be certain that we will have scored more goals than France or Switzerland?

 I've now had a go of urlLink GTray and it works wonderfully. It's only drawback is that it opens IE to view your mail rather than the specified default browser. Many people have requested he makes it work in Firefox. I don't know whether he is going to or not - I hope so.

 As I'm on about Blair's nanny state I also have a problem with David Blunkett's announcement today that he's going to get tough on knife carrying. Sounds like something the government said urlLink years ago when a headmaster was stabbed and killed. Today's announcement is of course due to the schoolboy who was sentenced to life yesterday for the murder of another schoolboy. So just how is making carrying a knife illegal going to stop people stabbing other people? If you want to stab someone I don't suppose the illegal act of carrying a knife is going to put you off. It may have worked for guns but that's due to gun ownership being made illegal unless licensed. So are we going to need a licence to own knives?! Or is Mr Blunkett just repeating old promises that he has no intention of fullfilling? And will it make any difference anyway?

 I've always suspected that the government's national ID card plan was just one step closer to Blair's nanny state. Not that I'm against anything that will make it easier to track criminals but the Big Brother approach just seems like it's wide open for abuse. And now it seems that some of our MPs urlLink think the same . 'Function creep' is the term used to describe fears that, despite good intentions, the national ID card will be used to do a lot more than just track criminals.

 Manhunt is on at least two front pages today and it is urlLink guilty of murder . Apparently.

"Speculation is already running rife across fan websites about who will be the mystery gay character, ranging from Mr Burns' devoted sidekick Waylon Smithers to one or both of Homer's sisters-in-law." All I can say if it's Smithers it's not much of a bloody mystery - even my 10 year old daughter knows Smithers is gay. My money's on Neddy boy but only because of his big gay moustache. But if it is going to be a mystery it's going to have to be harder than that. So I'm going to go for Mr Burns who will disappear into the sunset with Waylon.

 urlLink 11 reasons to sack Sven from the Daily Mail. Reason number one being that Sven isn't the honest, cosmopolitan man of honour and integrity that we thought we'd hired.

He may be after the money (aren't they all?) but he's still a good football coach and he's shagged Ulrika. What's the problem? Errm? We didn't win Euro 2004. Errm? What's unusual about that?

Not a huge problem but it would be nice if they could have let users know that the links they have back to Technorati are useless. Oh and New Links was no longer registered as belonging to anyone - I had to reclaim it. And now I can't log in at all. At least when Blogger rolled out their redeisgn it came with loads of new features and took a while to settle down.

Don't worry though as this only applies to web weasels "If you are an employee, partner, affiliate or legal representative of any site which enforces compulsory user registration then we require you to complete our registration process. It costs nothing to register and will only take a moment." The form required is pretty big (although I have seen actual registration forms even bigger than that) and the questions are fairly silly. Revenge is sweet! ;) BugMeNot are also asking non registration sites to add the following to their TOS: Any subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, or employees of any site employing compulsory user registration mechanisms are not authorized to access the content or services of this site. which would effectively make it illegal for say NY Times reporters to use the web if everybody did it.

 NUFC.com asked readers to email in their views on urlLink Newcastle United signing Patrick Kluivert . The link is to the first selection they've published. For what it's worth I've wanted Kluivert to come to the toon for a few years now and it always seemed on the cards. But more recently it was Beattie who seemed to be our target and I had gradually warmed to and eventually liked that idea. I'm definitely not complaining though as Kluivert is world class - and we'll buy Beattie next summer when we are preparing for the Champion's League. ;) I know Kluivert hasn't been as good recently as he has been in the past but I'm sure him and Shearer are going to be absolute magic together. Just as well Dogs isn't around as we'd now have a urlLink slanging match . Yay!

 urlLink ...and he's going to give you urlLink free boobies to persuade you to join up.

 I don't know but one of the most common proofs given is that stars can't be seen in any of the photographs from the Apollo missions. The just urlLink weren't looking properly ! Someone has taken some of the Apollo 11 pics and processed them through photoshop (tm blah blah!) and has found stars are visible in the sky. So was it faked? This urlLink guy thinks not but a really convincing argument that it was faked can be found urlLink here . Just don't let urlLink this bloke hear you saying it! And whilst we are on the subject of the moon here's a couple of cool lunar panoramas: urlLink 1 , urlLink 2 (need QT).

 Newcastle has been chosen to host a World Cup qualifier between England and Azerbaijan in March 2005.This good news has been tempered by the fact that the cockney scum over at Old Trafford will get to host the other 4 games!! When exactly did Manchester become the centre of England? The reason given for the two grounds that have been chosen is the fact that they are the biggest in the country.It's all down to FA greed, the games could be shared with other cities such as Birmingham or Liverpool.The only problem is the FA will not get as much gate money.So what's a few quid compared to keeping a fresh atmosphere which you would get if the games were spread around and giving more people their last chance to see England in a quality game outside stinking London.It's only fair the games should be held outside London because when the new Wembley stadium is built the rest of England will never see another international game, but that's another argument. urlLink BBC SPORT

 The UK Independence Party has decided to deal with women's issues. Godfrey Bloom, their new MEP for Yorkshire and Humber is concerned about women urlLink "Because I just don't think they clean behind the fridge enough" . He also went on to say that no right minded businessman would ever employ a woman of child bearing age. I'm not sure what to make of UKIP, maybe they're having a laugh but I'm sure they're up to no good. I suspect they appeal to anyone who would like to bring back hanging, national service, corporal punishment, ban immigration and, if Mr Humber has his way, to put women back in the kitchen. No doubt they appeal to those who are too embarrassed to vote BNP.

 The link is to a video which shows urlLink a bomb massacre in Fallujah .

 Seeing as Merg has taken such an interest in (and become our resident correspondent for covering) the political issues on the other side of the atlantic, here's a couple more interesting articles that I was reading this morning... When he was governor of Texas, George W. Bush pushed for an abstinence-based sexual education curriculum. The lesson for Texas teens is that the only safe sex is no sex, and that may be a lesson that heads nationwide. Texas educators are debating what will be taught in new sexual education textbooks for its high school students. One textbook under review advises that a good way a teen-ager can prevent a sexually transmitted disease is to get plenty of rest so he or she can have a clear head about sex and choose abstinence. The 15-member Texas Board of Education is considering and will likely approve four books, all of which extol the virtues of abstinence. Three make no mention of contraceptives at all while one makes passing reference to condoms. urlLink Texas Sex-Ed Textbooks Face Contraceptives Battle Also this week, good ol'e George has also declared that his administration will "never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people." urlLink New 'Bushism' Born at Bill Signing Bunger's Quote of the Day&reg;: I can't remember who said it, but it runs like this : " making war to create peace is like fucking to preserve your virginity..." via Yahoo!

 Loads of urlLink quotes from Terry Pratchett lifted from alt.fan.pratchett and very amusing they are too.

 Apparently English is fast becoming the lingua franca of of the EU which means we will no longer have to shout at waiters abroad. Yay!

That'll be the Eastern Europeans who the urlLink Daily Mail wanted to keep out as they would be damaging UK culture or something. And scrounging benefits. And eating babies. Instead they are making it easier for us to go on holiday. Their second language, if they have one, is nearly always English as they don't like Russian having spent years under Russian rule, don't like German (something to do with Hitler) and they don't like French (something to do with France). With the arrival of all these English speakers French and German are being marginalised. The only thing to find out now is whether I can sue the school system for making me sit through all those shite French lessons - for nowt!

I've just put ours in which takes them to urlLink 353 at the time of writing. This database is going to be used to contact people to get them to put the get Firefox button on their site.

 It's that time again folks as i'm only around for another half hour or so. urlLink List of company name etymologies . Interesting, particularly urlLink Yahoo . urlLink Today's game . Match the shapes before the time runs out. urlLink Euphemisms for our favourite words. NSFW. urlLink Chimpmeister soundboard More on urlLink battered Paris for Bungers. urlLink New US army recruits? urlLink Spain says Gibraltar visit is unhelpful . Fsck them. urlLink Spider web construction gallery . Does anyone remember the experiments on spiders and how they make their webs when they are baked/toasted/stoned?

 More Lego models than you can shake a Golden Brick at can be found at urlLink Eric Harshbarger's LEGO Portfolio including urlLink Bart Simpson , urlLink R2D2 and, especially for Merg, a mosaic of urlLink SF and urlLink NY . The lego brick at the bottom left of each page is a quick nav menu thing. I only mention it because it's not immediately obvious. via urlLink Hals' Stoopid Links

 A man with a chainsaw fell out of a tree and landed on his missus chopping her up in the process. "Tragic accident" say the police, sounds a bit dubious to me. I think he was hiding in the tree waiting for his chance. urlLink BBC NEWS

 It seems in Finland, being a 'net junkie can get you urlLink out of national service . Worth remembering incase conscription should ever rear its ugly head again!

 erm... " style="FLOAT: left" height=68 src="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/117/945/1024/boobies.jpg" width=68> A Malawian priest, 43, and a 26-year-old nun have been caught romping on Wednesday. Nice work fella! urlLink Yahoo! News - Priest, Nun Convicted After 'Sex Act' in Car Passers by alerted police at Lilongwe International Airport after the parked Toyota Corolla, which had tinted windows, began shaking in what police described as "a funny manner." via urlLink Yahoo!

 We've had urlLink Google hacking before but there's another mention of it in the news. It seems people running websites are still being careless with your info and leaving credit cards details lying about and it now it's being reported that urlLink Google searches can turn up these details. via urlLink Roowlants

 erm... " width="64" height="64" />It seems the urlLink Women of WalMart didn't just get their tats out for any old reason - it seems they may have had to rely on food stamps to supplement a low income. I'm sure the money from Playboy came in handy. California urlLink paid out $86m in assistance to WalMart employees in 2001 because their wages were so low and needed assistance in the form of food stamps and health related expenses. The study was based on data from that year but as WalMart wage increases haven't matched inflation levels the report reckons it will be even worse now. So the next time you slap your arse in Asda's with a self satisfied grin spare a thought for their employees - they might be talking to Razzle right now.

 In the tradition of certain other dubious bloggy/news-type sites, people and readers ask their readership stupid questions. Great filler for those Slow-News-Days, too. In order to perpetuate this pointless exercise, I've decided to inflict it upon our visitors too. So, here's the very first "Aks Newlinks" -- in honour of a nameless aquaintance of ILN. Since most (all?) of us are using Firebird, which Firebird extensions do you use? (And if you're feeling loquacious, why?) I use: Adblock -- zap any ad. A must. Web Developer -- Some nice context-menu extras for web page work. Tabbrowser Extensions -- Save and load tab sessions, undo close, general managment. Nifty. Image Zoom -- For those times you just want to "make it bigger". The picture, the picture! IE View -- For the broken sites. EditCSS -- Edit CSS on the fly. Bug Me Not -- For those with You-Must-Register site blues. I was also running FlashBlock on older versions, but last I heard it didn't work on the latest Firefox. But right now, for me, nor does flash. I must get around to fixing that...

 I'm going to update the linkage in the sidebar soon to put some of the linkdump sites in that hve been referring to us. Some of them are pretty good. Anyhoo - if anyone wants owt sticking in the sidebar shout out. Preferably a good source of linkage trawling but if it's a good blog or whatever they can go in too.

 The New York Times is urlLink reporting that digital analysis of the audio recording of the Kennedy assassination is to take place, to try and clear up once and for all if there were three shots or four. (Insert bad/tasteless Dirty Harry joke here). As always, NYT requires registration, so if you lack the excellent BugMeNot extension for urlLink Firefox and Mozilla or plug-in for urlLink IE , use urlLink BugMeNot's website. Or you could just register....

 Here at our very own home on urlLink blogspot , a company called CyberQuest has been creating many cross-linked blogs in order to urlLink manipulate Google's page-rank. Once again, pr0n blazes the trail. Another psot that should be a hit with Bungers and Dogs -- computers and (the promise of, at least) bewbz in one place!

 The BBC is reporting that Ofcom is reviewing regulation of premium rate phone services in an attempt to curb fraud. Of particular focus are rogue dialers, apparently. Yet another good reason to lose the modem and go broadband, say I.

 urlLink was ILuvNUFC today?

 Let me start by saying urlLink RIP Dogs . You went out in style. A public toilet in Switzerland is made entirely out of one way glass.

 Someone's nicked one of our posts word for word and stuck it on urlLink their site . Cheeky fsckers! Probably.

 I've urlLink given up trying to use reason with the dimwit Dogs and need something else to fill all that spare time saved. And here is something urlLink almost as pointless as arguing with Dogs and will almost fill up the time I have spared by not continuing to argue bicker with him.

 Uh-oh! Looks like we might have our very own " urlLink Nantucket Blob " headed this way! urlLink Eighty-Foot Dead Whale Heads for Coast

 Tired of urlLink ordering a chicken to do stupid things? If so how would you like to order a fsck witted ape around for a change?

I reckon next in the series will be urlLink Subservient Poodle . via urlLink presurfer - see there for a link to commands to try (cheers for the sidebar link btw!)

 Seeing as you got no "Fungus of the Month&trade;" last month, I thought I'd "upgrade your package" to include " Woman Women of the Month&trade;". It's a New Links New Feature&reg;! So, for August, here are the Teles sisters . Just if you were wondering what the talent looked like on my world travels.... urlLink Google Search: "sarah and deisi teles" .

Ooopers! More coverage, and video of G-Phoria can be found urlLink here . via urlLink GameSpot . Also in the news this week, urlLink Rio Introduces 1st Challenge to iPod Mini . The Rio Carbon, shaped like a slim wedge and weighing 3.2 ounces, uses Seagate Technology's new 1-inch, 5-gigabyte hard drive, and touts up to 20 hours of playback time on a rechargeable battery. It will cost $249 and be available in late August Anyone remember that show with urlLink Doc Cox (yes kids, he really is ZANY! With a capital ZEE!) and Esther Rantzen..? I think it was called "This Life" or something. I'm not sure, as it was a bit before my time. So, as a tribute to them, here's some pictures of fruit, that look like c0cks and f4nni3s, in a story cleverly titled urlLink Thousands flock to see fruity display in Indonesia . via urlLink Yahoo!

 Morning all! And morning to the urlLink growabrain visitors too! Seeing as you've joined us in the middle of another urlLink blog war between mmChronic and dogs , here's a nice xylophone to calm everyone down. May I present to you, the urlLink Limmy.com Xylophone . You'll need speakers, and it's best not to play with a xylophone at work. If you know what I mean.

 Google is now so powerful you can type in an item you've lost with their new keyword eg lost: keys and Google will find them for you. It can now also find the perfect partner for you (although we've got urlLink loads to choose from for Dogs) and tell you the meaning of life. Check out all the other new features urlLink here . via urlLink Willy Dobbe

 Hello Growabrain readers! It seems Dogs' picture of a hairybacked man which he urlLink claims to be me has been picked up by urlLink grow-a-brain . Twunt! The last time urlLink grow-a-brain featured us we got loads of hits so no doubt the same will happen today. Luckily they didn't link direct to the post but to the front page - which means if I fill it up with Dogs stories today my thirst for revenge will have been satisfied. Probably. So without further ado let me present the picture of Dogs after his capture at the Princess Di waste of money memorial urlLink yesterday . The picture is from a canny collection of 'Owned ' pics - check them out urlLink here . Owned pics via urlLink dumpalink

 Here's your chance to fly an F18 and shoot things. The game is called urlLink Operation Thunderbolt which I could have sworn had been used as a urlLink game title before. Be careful you don't get a high score - you might get an automatic, non negotiable 6 month tour of Iraq as the game belongs to the Australian Air Force.

 Some urlLink optical illusions for your perusal. I particularly enjoyed urlLink this one . Sent me cross eyed it did. and just skip the IQ test cr4p if it appears

 It looks like Dogs has let the side down again. He's only went and took his pack of ill begotten offspring and urlLink piddled all over the People's Princess' Memorial thingummybob. He should be put down for treason. "'The critical issue is that this is a memorial. I don't think any responsible person would want to see people allowing their Dogs in it.'" We're very sorry and we promise not to let him out again.

 Before you urlLink chuck away IE , perhaps you should check urlLink this page which demonstrates a new vulnerability in the Mozilla and Firebird browsers that allows remote pages to generate content that looks like it's part of the browser UI. More info urlLink here , and a quick link to an extensions I like urlLink here , that allows one to view any Firebird page in IE with just a couple of clicks.

 The BBC is doing an online poll to vote for your favourite fictional scientist. There are at least 2 obvious ones missing from the list. They do however have urlLink Beaker !
