 Well the good news is that I get my laptop back on Wednesday....yay! It turns out I was right about what was wrong...and you doubt me...come on people. The got the new keyboard in today and got it installed and all should be well. They actually should have sent it out today and if they did and got it out today there is the remote possibility that it will be here tomorrow but it will definetly be in by Wednesday. Also on Wednesday I have the parts that I need for my pocket PC to go wireless that day as well....so it will just be a big ole love fest of hardware and goodies. What is nice is that I got a SD memory card that I can use in both my Pocket PC and my Laptop (it has a SD slot built in)...it is just neat all this technology. Well a lot has happened over the time that I haven't had real unfettered access to the internet and as soon as I get the laptop back I will most definitely making a rather large update as there is a lot to tell. There are good things and bad things...but at least there are things. We have a new CF patient up here on the floor she has come over from Childrens she is a little frightened. I may go visit her tomorrow and see how she is doing seeing that I am the old man on the floor now. There are CF patients left that are sicker than I am...but I am fast rising to the top of the list of the sick ones. I am also now officially the longest inpatient right now here at Shadyside seeing that Danielle is no longer over here....she is now over at Presby...she got her transplant finally...I will tell all about that when I have more time to update properly. I also have a lot to say about the current political climate and what seems to be almost a given now...the Kerry nomination. I have a lot to say about that....and boy oh boy it will be good to get it off my chest. Well there isn't much else I want to write about right now...so I will leave it at that... Remember hopefully by Wednesday you will see a much larger update and a lot of information. I will probably do multiple posts that day as I get one thing tackled after the other. I also have a lot to do online that day as well...like pay credit card bills and such...plus download to outrageous stuff for my Pocket PC. Peace...and until then have a happy time......

 Oh yeah and I just took 20mg of Oxycontin...so that should help out soon... All these pain killers? Yes...all those pain killers...being couped up and sedentary makes things hurt that you never thought you had...plus it helps get rid of the pain of coughing (when you are coughing day in and day out things get sore real fast). So I wish I didn't need all of it...but at the same time I am thankful that I have it. Peace

 Well earlier I went downstairs to get some food from the cafeteria and I thought that I wouldn't need any oxygen...well was I wrong or what...by the time I got back up here to my room I my fingers were turning blue and I was definitely feeling like I needed oxygen. I guess that will be my reality for a while. I am going to have to have O2 on me...that sucks ass. My energy reserves are so tapped you have no clue out there. I got to talk to Danielle today and it was so good. She sounded great. Her mouth was going a mile a minute and she never got winded...she is having some minor problems but nothing that is extremely serious. It was just very good to hear from her...plus she has offered to answer the myriad of questions that I have about transplant. Sure I can read the books and I can watch videos, hell even the docs can answer some things...but it isn't first hand experience and the questions that I have can only be answered by someone who has been through it. So I am very greaful that she has offered to answer questions. Well it is extremely early in the morning and I just had a dose of Benadryl and Dilaudid...so I am fading fast folks... Peace

 Well I know that I should be updating this blog more often but to be honest I just haven't had the energy. I spent most of yesterday in a hazy half sleep state and just not feeling well. Today so far I have seen two docs...both Indian...now mind you I don't mind foreigners...but I mind when they are trying to tell me something and they have a bare grasp of our language. Plus I don't like dealing with doctors outside of my own because chances are they don't know how to treat CF patients and end up screwing things up. Well I am already worn out and I think I will take another nap. Peace

 Well I am back in the hospital again. This time it is because I have had two episodes of coughing up plain good ole blood. There wasn't any type of mucus or gunk...just straight dark dark red (probably from an artery...oh joy) and my oxygen level on room air are down to between 80-85% when I normally run around 95-96% and that is what I was at when I left the hospital last week. When they first got the pulse ox monitor on me I was all the way down to the high 60s range...so to same I'm sick would ve an understatement. We will see how this all plaus our...so updates will probably be updating a little more frequent. So hang in there folks...he blog will slowly come back to life. Peace

 baaaa!! Thats what I have to say to it all.

 so I haven't been to sleep yet but I have something to say about our favorite serial lier...Ann Coulter (that neo-nazi, neo-con whore wannabe). You have heard me talk about Max Cleland before. He was a Senator from Georgia and he lost his campaign to a Republican partly because of a massive smear campaign that the Republicans are well known for. They ran an add with him and then pictures of Osama and Hussein. They called him "un-patriotic" for voting against several of Bush's bills that are now proving to be quite troublesome...mainly Iraq, the war on terrorism... Well Mr. Cleland lost both legs and an arm in Veitnam...now the story goes is that he was being sent out into the field to fix some radio equipment and when he got off his chopper he noticed a grenade on the ground. He thought that it had fallen off of his kit (as had happened many times before...they had a problem falling off of kit) so he reached down to pick it up and it exploded. He lost both legs and an arm. This all happened at Kei San...the worst battle that we fought in Veitnam...many young men died in the battle and Max recieved several high commidations for his work...the incident happened as the battle was winding down and he was flown to a hilltop to establish a radio tower so that the guys in the rear could better communicate with forward positions (although the guys in the rear were being shelled and had a great battle themselves). Needless to say he was in a combat zone....or hot zone. He came back and became rather succesful despite his obvious disability. Our beloved whore...wait I mean Ann...well she makes the case that this all happened not in a battle or combat zone but in a relatively safe place and while he was drinking with his buds. She basically said the whole "war hero" thing was a hoax and that he had lost his limbs out of drunken stupidity. Well the facts tell quite a different story...the military even responded and his commanding officers responded as well. Here is a link to a better telling of the story. I find it absolutely dispicable what this woman has done and I would love to challenge her to a debate and go on TV with her to just humiliate her. I would have no problems whatsoever calling her a lieing whore who doesn't have the foggiest of idea of what is really going on in the world. It makes me mad that she would question his patriotism...and it all came about because of the recent Democratic push for Bush's national guard records. Yeah those...where the major questions still lay unanswered. It is about time that liberals and centrists stand up and collectively tell her she is no longer welcome here. She needs to go live on an island somewhere along with all the other conservative hate mongers out there...let them destroy themselves....because I am tired of them raping our nation. To Ann...you need to get a clue, you need to stop lieing, you need to leave...you are no longer welcome. Anytime you question someones patriotism by attacking them for an accident where a man or woman gave their all in service to the American population you have then become what you hate most. It is time for you to exit stage left and for us to never hear from you again.

 Well today I got some new antenna's for the wireless setup and now all is peachy. It looks like it will be ok now. My grandpa is in the hospital...he has been having problems with his cental lines that they do his dialysis through. Over the past few days his one decomissioned line started to leak...well today he almost bled out from it. At some point the surgeons that he has seen put a patch on the artery in his arm and that patch blew today and it was spurting blood all over the place...part of the problem is that he has been picking at the wound for months and it has been infected for a long time. He went into surgery tonight and got that fixed and they had to take veins from his foot to save the arm. When they got the vein out they noticed that it was completely lined with cholesterol and plaque deposits...now normally you only see that close to the heart and in the groin...but this was all the way down at his hand...so he is really in bad shape. For me today it wasn't so bad...I got out a little bit and it was non-stressful. Right now I am about to play with my DVD burner and try and copy a movie...one that I already own. Now that the network is all fixed I will definitely be updating more often and I will get some of the hospital backlog up. Peace

 Yet another crap day...but at least I got my grandmothers computer up and purring like a kitten. The wireless setup is really flaky and I don't know why. I have tried so many different things. Every once in a while the AP just craps out and all the cards go looking for a network. The only thing that is good at switching like that is the damn pocket pc setup I have...and it works great! It won't matter much longer because I have a Netgear 802.11g router/ap on its way and that should clear uo the problem right there. Tomorrow I have to go to Radio Shack to pick up some raw cat five cable to make a longer one so that I can keep GM's computer hard wired and have the AP at a central location in the house. While I am there I am going to look for better antenna equipment for both the AP and the Reciever cards...they both have dinky 5 cent jobs...that will help out on the signal issues. Right now my PDA is showing an almost flawless conection to the AP...while the card that is in my box is showing only about a quarter of the PDA's signal. Not only to mention I have been getting a great "link quality"...so I think I have a bit to do before the system is really fixed up. Well kids its time for me to try and sleep...ttyl. BTW: I will get pics of my new laptop and desktop and PDA when I get all settled back in...because I am sure a few of you are wondering what kind of stuff this techno weeny is using...so stay tuned.

 Well Bush has unleashed his first round of re-election ads and so far they are going over worse than a fart in church...actually I would imagine Satan could walk into a Catholic Church and molest some alter boys and people would be less offended at that than Bush's ads. I have seen them and frankly I am offended not because of the images but because Bush said that he and Cheney would not use 9/11 as a political chess piece. Of course no one believed him at the time but we all hoped that they wouldn't. Bush is having to use 9/11 because really he has nothing else to run on. The economy is shit, the so called security that was supposed to be provided by the war on terror has turned out to have made us less secure, and to top it all of the Bush administration has nearly demolished our Civil Rights through various laws. We haven't even gotten to his Tax cuts for the middle class (I didn't know the middle class started at several hundred thousand a year and up). This administration is the worst in the history of the US. They have almost single handedly destroyed what America is. Today Martha Stewart was found guilty on all charges. While I agree that she was guilty as hell, I have to say that she is the big white elephant in the system to keep our attention off of Ken Lay and all those people in Enron and even WorldCom (although Bernie Ebers has been charged), Global Crossing...she was a diversion. It disgusts me that a big deal was made out of her crime which in the grand scheme was minor. She profitted all of 60 grand and since the government has decided to go after her the government has actually cost investors millions through prosecution of her...causing greater damage overall than if they had just fined her and suspended something or other. Today was also the day that John Ashcroft was admitted for severe pain to a hospital. He has something called Pancreatic Gall Stones or something. Painful and not pleasant for sure. I would never wish pain or illness on anyone (unlike Pat Roberts who called for his flock of sheep to pray that some of the Supreme Court Justices to get sick and die)...however maybe after he gets well he will see that his policies and the things he has done have been bad for the Union and maybe he will reverse his stance on some things...however I doubt he will change his tune. I wish him well and a speedy recovery so that the nation can bash his brains in during this election season and send him back to podunk USA where he lost a senators seat to a dead man. That is all for now....Peace

 Sorry for the lack of updates lately...I just don't feel like posting all that much. I am not well and really I have spent almost this entire stay in the hospital asleep. I went to meet the surgeon today and it was good that I got that out of the way. It was about time. I don't know how I feel about it all really. I don't want to be in pain and really I don't want to feel like shit. I am basically scared about getting sick and getting to the point where I have to carry oxygen with me and all that crap...as I have to now. I had to take O2 with me because I am not getting enough from my lungs out of the air...I really don't want to go through this all. I am afraid and I am worried. I can't really talk to my family about it because I don't know how. I don't want to talk to a therapist because I have done that before and it never helped. I don't want medication to feel mentally better because it comes with a lot of side-effects. I just don't know. As for friends...yeah like I have many that I can talk to about this. Sure I will probably get some email here and they will all be like "dude you can talk to me about anything"...well it isn't that easy and no I can't. There is no way you can understand what I am feeling and what I am going through. Really you can't help and I am not mad about it or do I want to not be friends...it just isn't something that I can talk with them about. I just don't want to be sick and I certainly don't want to go through all of this. I guess it is that time that I just have to buckle down and deal...and I hope I can. Another thing that is bothering me is that I have not had sex in over three years now. So? You say....well it isn't so much the sex or the intimate contact that I miss...it is that piece of the puzzle that you feel needed or wanted if only for a few minutes or hours...that is what I miss. I miss just being loved by someone other than my family and I don't mean "cutesy I love you, I love you", I mean it for real. To feel that connection again would be great. That is probably the biggest fear that I have...I will go through all of this alone and if I make it out the other side what will be there waiting...at this point nothing. On the other side of all of this is nothing...not a family, not a girlfriend or lover...just me. I wish that I could go out and play the field now...but even if I could I am horrible at it...sure I can be funny and witty...but I need an audience for that to work...one on one sometimes it doesn't relate. I would just like to know what is in store so I could make a more informed decision for myself instead of walking blindly into the great unkown. If I knew what was up...then I could make a decision and be content with it. Since I don't know or have a clue, making a decision is hard and I am not happy with it because I don't know. Peace

 I just saw a commercial for Viagra that uses Queen's "We Are The Champions"...now we all know that Freddy Mercury loved a good stiff cock from time to time...but I would think he would have a problem with his song being used in that commercial. Have they no shame. heheheheh...stiff cock.

 As we get closer to finalizing Kerry as the Democratic nominee for President, the more I feel like the American Public has lost control of our own government and that we are no longer needed except to rubber stamp things. I was thinking last night and I came to some interesting ideas and conclusions. Under this administration we have seen the budget for education slip...While it has grown it has not grown at the pace that is needed to just keep at baseline. With the "No Child Left Behind" act we are seeing that in essence the Federal Government wants to get out of the Education Business because after all if your school or district is failing then you first get put on a probation of sorts then if (which reduces Federal Funding...When it should increase to fix the problems) your district or school continues to not meet the standard then you will loose all Federal Funding. That is a classic case of breaking an already broken system. If you cut funding to a struggling school then obviously it won't have the resources to better itself and will continue to fail. Now what happens...Well your child is left without many alternatives...While I won't say that public schools will go the way of the Dodo but I will say that the public schools will produce even less educated people that it already does. It won't be a problem if you can afford to send your kids to private schools...and if you think that "well they will make vouchers available"...Don't count on an educating voucher to cover the entire cost of a private school...You the parent will have to make up the difference. So basically the lower classes here in America will be denied a decent education. Also if by some miracle little Sue or Johnny make it through primary education college will be a much more difficult beast to conquer. We have seen at State Schools a rise in Tuition average about 25% over the last three years (at least here in Western PA college tuition has gone up by about 25% over the last 3 years) and it is becoming more and more difficult for even an average family to send their kids to school. Don't even get me started on those young adults who are paying their own way....They now have to go into even more debt than before. The reason that College Tuition is going up...Well lack of funding from the Feds...But mostly because states are struggling to pay their bills. The economy is so rough right now that states simply have to cut budgets and pass the cost on to students and their parents. Yes the economy is improving according to the numbers...But those numbers don't tell you that the people benefiting from the slowly growing economy are the wealthy people. I saw recently that the average extremely wealthy person pays about 17% of their income to the government in taxes...While the middle class and the lower classes pay on average of 24% of their income to the government. The people that are the engine of the economy and the main payers of taxes haven't yet seen real growth or pay increases. Now if you take all of this into account and then look at what happens because your lower classes of people are less educated or completely un-educated you start to see some really bad things come to pass. We all know that as long as we have a Federal Government we will always have the Military and Security forces and they will always receive the lions share of the federal budget. What we don't see is that for many of the positions in both areas you need a college degree or high level of education. Take an Air Force Pilot...They won't talk to you if you don't have a college degree... Now look at who typically goes into the military (even as pilots because you would think higher classes would sign up for that...But I argue differently)...The people who drive the military are in general lower class citizens...You won't find many rich kids in the military. So what happens when these lower class people no longer have access to decent education...Well our military is going to suffer...Perhaps that is why the Air Force and other branches of the military are pouring money into UAV's and such...If your plane doesn't need a pilot only a minder...Then hey who gives a rats ass if the recruits are well educated. The same goes for other technical aspects in the military...They are slowly becoming automated and need only for human minders to just keep an eye on things. What is a real mind blower for you...Well it blew my mind. The people who are in the military...mostly from lower classes, they are also the ones who are paying for wars. Enlisted men and women are essentially paying for the privilege to get you ass shot up in some foreign land...Isn't that a bite. I would also argue that we no longer have a middle class. We have the upper classes which includes several layers...Those who never have to worry about money again, and then those who could loose it all in a blink of an eye but generally don't because they are "well leveraged". The you have the lower classes which can then be broken down into several layers. There are the poor, those who are under or near the poverty line. You have the working poor, those who have a job or two but can't really make ends meet but manage month to month. Then you have what would be the formerly middle classes down here. The middle class of the poor are those that have decent jobs, maybe college educated, and generally living beyond their means but they make it. However any bump in the road may derail these people. The upper middle class are those that are so close to being upper class they can nearly taste it...But they will most likely never make it. These people are college educated, have great jobs, and live lavishly, but again they don't have the money to just go on vacation out of the blue or spend a buttload of money on a purse shopping spree. These people are well off but as time moves on higher prices and taxes will slowly push these people to the brink and they will then have even less disposable income than they did before. The key to rating classes for me is Disposable Income. This is the excess income after you have paid your bills and put money away for college tuition and retirement. The money that you can afford to blow on frivolous activities. The richer you are the more money you have to blow. To me that is pretty simple, and the most reliable way to figure out who is rich and who isn't. So this whole post is about how the majority of the public is being screwed and on top of it all we are paying to screw ourselves. I hope that something gives soon because I am damn tired of looking like a war monger in foreign lands, I am tired of being feared to the point where people will go out of their ways to kill us in the hopes keeping us away. I am tired of the overall good people here in America paying for others to suffer and put us in danger. Peace

 Lord Of The Rings: Return of the King swept the Oscars tonight. Hoorah! Other than that...nothing to report. Peace

 I feel like shit. It is early in the morning and I just had all my drugs...but before I got them I puked my guts out. So hard that my nose bled a little. What really sucks is that I haven't eaten all that much in the past few days because everything has just tasted off to me. Since I came back to the hospital I haven't really had one good full meal. Like I say...nothing tastes right. I muscled down some food tonight but a little later it decided that it was going to come back up for a visit. I don't enjoy being sick like this. All of my energy is gone and while nothing is majorly off...something is still not ticking over correctly so you know I just have to feel like shit. All I know is that when I went to get food the other night from the cafeteria I didn't take an O2 tank with me and by the time I staggered back up here I was almost at the point of passing out. I just hope that I can get to a point where things are all semi-stable...because I don't like this feeling at all...even doped up it isn't pleasant...while I love all the drugs they are useless in the quest to make me feel level...only good health can do that.

 Oh yeah and I think I will be doing a little work on the blog here to spruce it up and rid it of some links. I am also going to seriously look into getting my own domain name and private host. I feel once I get the majority of this illness out of the way I will be freed to persue what I want which is simple really. I want a nice trendy (but not yuppie) loft apartment (preferably I would like to buy a building with a loft and either apartment units or a downstairs that can be a storefront or business). I will have it nicely furnished with lots of electronics and computers everywhere controlling all sorts of things. I would also set up a small hosting service of my own so that I can subsidize having my own fat internet pipe into the place...and on that I can do what I kinda have been floating in my head. I want one of those floor beds...you know IKEA bed where it is low to the floor in a big king or queen size and a big down blanket. I want the apartment to be an open floor plan so that you can see everything in the place with the exception of two bedrooms and the bathroom (which will be the bomb) and the rest is just living space with a nice kitchen and living area...and the entertainment center will be a center all right. All around a Plasma or LCD TV screen (depending on if LCDs come down as they have been...oh and has to be 40+ inches)...THX certified surround, and a media computer that controls it all with HDTV, gaming, and lots of goodies that will be tied into my apartments network (both wireless and wired). There is the living and kitchen on the one side and the other side will be a home office with another kick ass computer with dual LCDs and uber specs for work...and a nice desk...I have that kinda picked out already because the one I want is glass topped and just look beautiful. The bedroom will have a media center as well and a medium size LCD or Plasma screen and computer that is powerful enough...and for sleeping I could play mp3 with a kewl visualization on the Plasma or LCD...plus the sound system in there will be small but powerfull and clear. The bed and open closet design (and little storage things so it looks like I am anal). The second bedroom will be a little more basic...a bed, dresser, and few other things...but it will be comfortable. The kitchen will have a big ass fridge with a glass door so that I can see what is in it at anytime...kinda like a deli cooler. An island with the stove and oven and microwave...hanging above it is the pot rack (stainless steel all around)...just a tight looking kitchen. The floors would be wooden...with possibly radiant heat built in (saw it on this old house and it looked neat as hell and keeps things warm and is efficient)...there will be area and throw rugs...but the floor has to be wooden...I have always loved a good wooden floor. The place will be for both living and entertaining...not huge in space...but big enough that I can have people over and we won't be stepping over each other during a party (hence the big ass entertainment center that is THX plus it will have speakers wired around the house...and there will be a place for wanna be DJs to jack in and spin if they please)... I want these things because I could live there easily and comfortably for a long time. Plus if I get my ass going I could run a business or have rental units that will pay for the building itself. That would be the key to it all. The building must be able to sustain itself financially either through renting apartments or business space or by me running a business out of it. The goal is set so that I have something to aim for. Once I have something along those lines and my life is moving towards the achievment of that goal...then I will be ready for a relationship with some hot super model...hehehe And if not...all those LCDs and computers can put on porn throughout the house.... Oh yeah and I want the computers to be tied together and voice activated and for them to have a voice...like wakeup alarms...and I can say "set temp 70 degrees" and the system sets the thermostat, or I can say "tv history channel" and the tv I am addressing will turn onto the history channel. Kinda like HAL without the homicidal tendencies.

 I wanted to give a quick update to the story that I posted yesterday early in the AM. Well the death toll in Madrid is now up to 190 (and expected to rise) and over 1400 injured. It was three seperate attacks on three trains in three stations using a total of 10 bombs. At least that is what is known right now. At first the Spaniards insisted that it was ETA, a freedom fighter group for a small bit of land in the Northern part of Spain right along the border with France. Of coarse we chimed in and said it was Al-Queda. Some convieniant evidence shows up and it looks like it. Nobody really knows who did it yet and we all need not jump to conclusions until we know more. It was a trajedy and generally the people of the US send our best and we hope that you will not give in and your government will not turn counterproductive and revoke many of your rights unlike our own. Well I am still in the hospital. I talked to the doc today (well technically yesterday) and he is going to try and get me out of the hospital. We are both a little leary because of the infection and we have not been able to isolate it. If he springs me I am afraid that I will bounce back into the hospital in a short time. Whatever the decision is I will be happy and make the most of it because that is all I can do...and believe me I am living one day at a time. Peace

 I have been thinking more and more about this whole morality thing that the nation is going through. How so many people were shocked by Janet's Nipple, and how the sex on the tele has just gotten out of control (the only time I would consider it out of control is if you go tumbling off of it while in the act...that is wild sex)...but regardless the entire nation...or rather many people in the nation have gone completely nuts and started making mountains out of molehills. What it comes down to is that the Far-Right fundamentalists of the christian coalition and other radical groups have decided that the nation is filled with heathens and we all need saving. For a person like me it scare me to think that these wacko's are now censoring what I can see on TV...not just the old standards and practices kind of censorship but rather the fuvor of censoring even minor things. The first strike has already been done. We can't really do much about it right now...it can be fixed but it will take time. That first strike was the consolidation of the media giants. There are now but 7 major media giants and they literally control what we see on Tv and the Theatre...and even what we hear on the radio (with Clear-Channel or Infinity being the two companies who own the majority of radio stations). With this consolidation it becomes very easy to control the message that is being spread. Simple and easy. If you own all the media you can tell the people whatever you want and the public have no other place to get news. The interesting thing is that most people will take what they are being told as the truth because it is coming from repsected sources. Hey its NBC...they tell the truth most of the time. You see...easy. Then you start with your second wave. This is the morality police. They come swooping in and start the argument that children are seeing to much on the TV and that things are out of control and it is about time for some restraint to be shown by the media giants...ok no problem. That happens. Then once you have started getting little things done here and there...you start to go for larger prey and the outright dropping or pushing out of shows or people who do not share your views. No this predicates on the idea that the media giants have given buttloads of money to one party and that party has happened to deliver them the ability to become even larger...so they are allowed to grow and they only have to take orders every once in a while...and most of those orders are rather benign compared to boycots that would start if the radical right isn't listened too. So they target people and shows and get them fined and eventually thrown off the air. This could never happen right? It is and has already happened. Howard Stern is the most famous example as he has been pulled from several Clear Channel radio stations (including my own Pittsburgh station...and I enjoyed catching a show now and then) and will soon loose his job because the FCC will be fining him and his station soon...and rather than stick up for him they will fire him (he works for an Infinity station). They claim they are pulling his shows due to his crude humor and him stepping over the decency line. Well he has been doing this for years and years. He has not recieved many repremands in the past from the FCC. If anything his show has gotten a little more tame over the years. So the decency thing doesn't really wash. What changed is that he started talking out about Bush. Stern was a former Bush supporter as he is a liberaltarian and they vote mainly republican and he voted for Bush. Well he has changed his mind and decided to talk out about how things have gone whacky and that we are loosing our country of moderate people to a group of right wing nutters that carry crosses on their mini-vans and SUVs. Stern finds that frightening (as I do) and now he is targeted for removal. To be sure he will be removed. They also went after Bubba the Love Pump down in Florida...for similar reasons. Now compare it to some of the right wing morons like Hannity, Coulter, Rush, and many others and if you listen to right wing radio talk shows you will here more foul language and disgusting things out of them...and they are doing it to be funny or point out fact...they do it with a mean spirit and with the intention of riling people up. Those guys say horrible things...but because they pull the party line they are fined or dropped from the air...so it has nothing to do with language or decency...it is about politics and silencing political dissodent and dissodents. May we see this trick and fend it off for our own sake...because before to long we are going to have to clear our thoughts even through a government agency lest we want to run afoul of someone or something. peace....

 Well I forgot to mention that I had to get a blood transfusion on Tuesday. 2 Units total. It seems that I am leaking from somewhere because during my last visit I was also having similar problems, mainly that my blood count was low, iron levels low, and a high white cell count. Basically I was sick, had a few vitamin and mineral problems with the levels being low, and I was low on blood most of the time. This time it was enough to have to get a transfusion. I felt better later in the evening and yesterday all day I felt ok...so far today I feel so-so but not great. Hopefully after I get a little sleep I may feel a little better...which is important because I have to go start my car and run it up and down the garage to keep it from having problems from sitting to long. Also this morning there were a series of bombs that went off in Madrid, Spain. Many people are dead (62 and rising as of 5:15AM Eastern time). It is sad because right now because the world have basically become unstable. Around the world you here of at least one bombing per day and many deaths. All of the bombings have something in common that should be noted. All of the groups that are setting of the bombs are groups that are seeking greater rights or the ability to set up a nation of their own. All of the bombings have targeted the popular or predominant parties of nations. Basically most of them are Freedom Fighters. Let me stress that I do not think bombing inocent citizens is a valid tool for fighting a power that is opposed to you. The only place that it has worked has been in Ireland...and frankly all of the bombings that the IRA committed didn't do much except to get moderates to the table. In the end the IRA had to stop bombing places and killing civilians and then they were able to make progress towards independance and peace. Today still there are tensions over there and the peace can be called shakey at best. So it bombing civilians doesn't really get you far...but it does strike fear into the public at large. Sometimes drastic measures are needed to get negotiations going, and for me I can understand suicide bombers and bombings in general. When a people or group have to get to that point of dispair I can understand why things that are normally off limits become fair game. All of the conflicts that are happening now would not be happening if we still had two superpowers pointing missiles at each other (we still do but they are no longer "those commie bastards"). During the cold war all of the little tensions around the world were essentially supressed because people were always at threat of nuclear war and local spats were simply not worth the energy. Now that the cold war is over all of these little groups that have come out may well have the right to set up their own nations and govern themselves, but as always through history, the bigger governments won't let the little guys go (partly because the big guys that won't let them breakaway usually are not letting them break off because the little guys in that land have natural resources that the big guy needs to exploit) because of arrogance and ignorance. So we all need to buckle up because it is only going to get worse until the governments of the world realize that they cannot run roughshod over their people, and that some groups it is just better to let them have their land or new nation then fighting it out with them. Anyways...time for a nap...peace ya'll

 There is one Bush ad that is playing that is really pretty damn funny if you consider the Presidents past business dealings. The ad talks about Americans having a strong entrepreneurial spirit and how they need a President who understands that. Now the funny thing is that over 50% of small businesses that are opened each year will likely be closed within five years. Another funny thing is Bush saying he understands business. Um yeah...that would explain his many failed companies and the millions that people threw into them just disappearing. Oh yeah and much of that money came from Saudi Royalty and Bin-Laden family. It is just funny.

 Double post...oops.

 Gitmo. Our interment camp. Where there is no law, where there are no rights, where you go if you are A: possible terrorists B: Possibly political dissidents C: Or just plane baddies. Ok so the last two we don't know about...and it is probably just conjecture, but how do we know for sure? We don't. As an American who has read the Constitution and The Bill of Rights I find it absolutely criminal, and I find it even worse that normal everyday American citizens have not questioned it at all. These people in charge are breaking not only our own laws to due process and speedy trials, but they are breaking International Law as well as the Geneva Convention which all nations essentially play by (well at least the "Western" Nations...most "Eastern" Nations don't play it by the letter..they still do some pretty nasty stuff to POWs...however I am sure that we do similar things). We need to stop it plain and simple. We need to release all of the "detainees" and take them home and find some way of paying restitution to them..whether it be millions of dollars or help their country with giving aid, whatever they want we need to give it to them. I understand the fears of the Pentagon and White House, they think that if they release them that these men and children will re-join Al-Queda or the Talliban, if they were part of those organizations in the first place. The problem is we don't know for sure who these people are and what their true affiliated were. It is very possible that we picked up 50% of these "detainees" and they have no affiliation with either group, they were just in the wrong place at the wrong time with a long beard. Some of them are indeed part of those organizations and may well be a threat if they are let go. Now here is the real problem. We have held these people for two years or more without rights and in isolation. The problem is they are probably pretty pissed off at America and Americans. We may very well release them and they will join up with the first group that comes along and says "lets go destroy the great satan". That is our real problem. We have bred hatred in them. Before we came along and picked these poor people up they may have disliked America but many of them (at least the ones who weren't Al-Queda and just simple Afghan peasants) remember that we helped them rid their country of the Russians in the 80's. Again they had no love for us, but they certainly weren't going to out of their way to kill us. Now those people (with a minor minority who actually practice the love of Islam and decide to forgive us) are definitely candidates that may well go way out of the way to exact some vengeance on us. We can not avoid it sadly. There is no way that we can make it better. We stepped in the pile of shit and we are going to smell like it for a long time. We certainly can not keep these people until they die natural, over the years people will certainly get a bug up their ass about the whole thing and find some way to free them. We can not just execute them, that would lead to true International Outrage and may well trigger foreign countries to execute prisoners that are US citizens for some sort of revenge. The only option is to release them, try and make it right, and just watch our asses because they are going to be there ready to do something should we slip up for even a minute. Many people forget however the even larger picture to this all. Sure it is bad that we are holding these people without cause, without charge, without any legal rights, but it is what could set a precedent for the rest of the world. If we can do that to foreign nationals, then any other nation can do the same to us under the reasoning of the Bush administration (or rather rule of tyranny). Imagine you are over in lets say Egypt...not the best place for Americans, but a hell of a lot better than say Iraq or Iran. Say the Egyptians get a bug up their ass and they come and pick you up at one of the pyramids. Now mind you they don't call the embassy and tell them "hey we have John Q. Public and he is being charged with goat molestation"...no they just snatch you up and lock you away. You cannot get letters out or make a phone call. Not only that but they hold you indefinitely and in addition the people holding you are not familiar with the English language (hey do you think the average troop has even a passing bit of Arabic language...sure there are some that can speak it well for interrogation, but the average "grunt" knows only a few commands and not much else). Hopefully in the above example you can see that it is a real problem. If you think that it won't happen because you are an "American" and if you were held special forces would swoop in and rescue you. That only happens in the movies, very rarely does it happen in real life. Besides the Government doesn't even know you have been detained. If we really did those kind of things then we would be making many missions into South American nations to rescue Americans...but they don't, unless you are politically connected or very wealthy. Being an American at this point in history is not a particularly good thing in the rest of the world. We have no special rights in the rest of the world, and we are not special. Hopefully we can unseat our current "leader" (ha...leader...he's leading us alright...leading us to destruction) and get someone into the White House that will be willing to approach this all very humbly and ready with a lot of "I'm Sorry" cards from American Greetings. Unfortunately the person running against Shrub is Berry (I mean Kerry) and they are not to much different...both went to Yale and were members of the Skull and Bones club. Kerry went to Vietnam and won some medals so we know he isn't a complete chickenshit where Bush went AWOL from a reserves position and the most danger faced was stubbing his toe on a bench or jamming a finger when flying an obsolete jet. We can hope that things will change just enough so that Americans can at least start to hold our heads level...but it will take many years of groveling before we can hold them high. Peace...and to foreign readers. I assure you that not all Americans a trolls or evil people. Many of us are disgusted at what is going on. Many of us are mobilizing to save our nation, and hopefully to save some lives around the world. We aren't all beer guzzling, wrestling watching, inbred, and married to our cousins uncles sister in law who is the mother of Billy's kid your best friend. We aren't all like that. Many of us want and will change our nation for the better...and you can help us by supporting the non-cretins amongst us and recognize that some of us are trying...it is just hard because we have to live it day in and day out...and sometimes we tire. Peace...

 For an interesting video go check this out. It's about Bush and how he got where he is. Good little video It may take a few minutes for you to load and it is 56 minutes long...but certainly worth the time.

 Well the United States finally claim the number one spot in the world for at least one thing. We have the highest level of STD's in all of the industrialized world. 1/3 of all Americans will get some sort of STD at some point during their lives. Of the 19 million or so new infections of various STD's almost half (49%) of those people are in the age bracket of 15-24. You gotta love this country...maybe that will be a deterant to people wanting to come here. Maybe we can have a whole new slogan for the nation. "Come to America, get a free STD" or "STD's...an all-American tradition"...or maybe we should give some tips to people "Avoid the clap" (especially effective on resteraunt bills where is says "Tip"...waitresses love that...especially the ones that look like they have been ridden hard and put up wet...and those ladies are often found at truck stop food dives). So we need to be proud of something. Peace...

 Ok...we now know that Republicans want to rule the world and they will attempt it in any way possible..and that the media consolidation of late is a prime example of how they will do it. Through stifling any dissent against them or Premiere Bush...or Dictator Bush...whatever the hell he is because no matter what the supreme court says...he didn't actually win the election just like he never really finished his reserve duty. The RNC has warned CBS stations not to air the Moveon.org commercials saying that they are illegally funded and break the rules of 527's (a new class of PACs). A 527 is allowed to collect as much money as they want from donors and they can publish ads that knock candidates but they cannot explicitly endorse any candidate. Well if you have been watching TV lately you have probably seen a few moveon.org ads. They do a pretty effective and truthful job of attacking Shrub. Notice in the commercials they never once endorse a candidate, they just attack Bush. Well they are allowed to do that. The RNC states that they can't do that. Well the election commission sees it otherwise and says that they can as they are following the rules. So if you stand for stifling free speech, are for saying anyone who opposes your point of view, or anyone who may remotely disagree with you on any subject...than the Republican party is for you. All they want is world domination and all the money. It is yet more proof that the Neo-Cons want to run everything and are willing to do anything to get their way. It lends greatly to the idea of shipping them all off along with anyone in Israel that identifies themselves with the Lakud party, or any person that is born out of Taliban or Al-Queda thinking, to a remote island and arm them to the teeth. Let them destroy each other...and once one party is left standing the rest of the civilized world take a joint action and bomb the island back into the sea to make sure that we can be rid of all this nonsense. This makes me want to take what is left of my life and go start killing key people that are causing problems for America...and believe me there are both Republicans and Democrats on the list....no one in power would be safe. Alas I am to sick to do it though...but a guy can dream can't he.

 Today, well more like yesterday Dean launched his "new" idea...so far I am underwhelmed, but hey it is just getting started. Democracy for America, Dean's "new" idea. What it looks like he wants to do, and really it is a good idea, is keep the grassroots movement that he and Trippi started and give it direction for not just the Presidential race, but all races from local to state to national. In addition he wants to try and get the disparate groups together and pool resources and unify them all into a single entity with many specialties. I would imagine part of that would be getting people along the line that can go on to a News show or talk show to counter the Right's onslaught of pundants, experts, and policy wonks. Everyone would be under a unified banner while keeping their individual ideals and direction. Kind of like how our nation is set up. We have states that make their own laws and go about enforcing them and take action one way, but all of the States fall under the Republic of America or know as The U.S.A. That so far as I can tell, and coming out of various Republican campaigns that I had worked in over the years, is the weakest part of the Liberal movement is lack of coherence and direction. You have a thousand groups pulling in different directions at once. It is not a wonder that the Liberal point of view has largely been lost in the din of the Republican machine. If they were to get together and pool resources the movement could go a lot farther and have more of an impact on policy. Another thing that has been a big mark against liberals is that people think that is a dirty word...well many Americans at least. The Republicans have won a major coup by redefining the word and turning Liberals into these Ivy League pricks that all they want to do is raise taxes and then go out and spend the money on the National Endowment of the Arts so some starving no hack artist can carve a penis out of prison soap. The reality is that Liberals are far from that...well ok maybe one or two want to do that, but almost all of them to a tee want to see the Government returning services for the massive amounts of money it collects each year. The majority of that money they currently collect go towards the Military, and hey when is the last time the Air Force gave you a call asking if you wanted to take the new F-22 Raptor out for a spin, or the Army drops by and lets you run the M1-A1 Abrams through its paces and fire off a few practice rounds. It doesn't happen. Liberals want to see that needs are met for the neediest, and that our infrastructure doesn't fall into disrepair (which it already has). What is funny is that some have been calling for National Single Payer Health Insurance. In other words health care for everyone or universal health care. Republicans have been saying "it will never work, it will cost to much, sounds a little bit like a communist idea". The Republicans also paint it that everyone is against it. Well that really isn't the case. Currently GM has billions of dollars of yearly outlay for health insurance for current and retired workers, they estimate that 1200 dollars from each vehicle they sell goes directly to health care. Other companies are seeing similar problems. As health insurance prices go up, the harder it is for a company to afford them. They have to raise the employee contribution portion, or lay off people, raise prices on the product or service they provide, or in some cases they move plants overseas or to Canada where either Health care isn't thought about (China, India...have health care but state sponsored and not really high tech) and to Canada where they have great health care and it doesn't cost the operator/owners of businesses a lot of money. It doesn't help that the worlds largest company Wal-Mart doesn't really offer good health care, and most of its workers don't carry the company insurance unless they are management, most of the "associates" don't get the insurance. With that huge group not having insurance when they get sick and need to go to the hospital, then the entire system pays and prices have to go up to cover the uninsured. The health care system is in a mess. So many of the larger companies are coming around to universal health care. 60% of Doctors are willing to take minor pay cuts if it lessons paperwork, and along with it there is some sort of malpractice lawsuit reform. I am not saying tort reform, but rather a new system that vettes out the bogus claims and allows the real ones to go on to court where the person can get a bijjilion dollars or whatever. It is estimated that if we moved to single payer we would see a saving in administrative costs of almost 300 Billion (yes Billion) dollars and that would nearly cover all of the currently uninsured. It is all a big mess that can be fixed...and with this grassroots idea it could be used as a lobbying tool, but also a public education tool that informs people of the misconceptions that have often been floated by the Republicans. So that is where I think it will be headed...it is going to take some time to get rolling, but once a stone starts rolling downhill sooner or later that stone picks up speed and by the time it is at your doorstep it have enough force to blow right through your door. Peace Oh yeah and I am going to work on links and stuff when I feel well enough to code it out.

 Now I know these poll results are more than likely scewed...because we all know that the Presidential Race will be much closer than what this poll shows...but it is interesting nonetheless. I wish that the site had a place where you could write in your vote...I would have given Dean a vote. Suprisingly even Nader scores higher than Bush....I could only wish and hope that this really was how things are going...but we live in the real world. Here is the poll that I am talking about. Maybe it will come true...we can only hope. Again the poll is by no means really representative of what is going on (although more and more people are pissed off now towards Bush). The poll is being held by a liberal group so...take it with a grain of salt. Finally a journalist has done his/her job and came prepared for an interview. Who was the interview with? None other than our pal Donald Rumsfeld or Rummy for short (because he must be swilling gallons of the stuff if he really believes what he says...you could only believe it all if you were high or drunk or of some sort of altered mental state). I don't know who the reporter is or news guy...but I would love to buy him a beer because he came prepared and actually called Rummy on one of his many lies and in doing so set ole' Rummy on the defense...when he is confronted with the truth he breaks down and starts backpeddling as fast as he can. Watch the video from the link below. Classic Video that call Rummy on his lies...priceless! Peace Probably larger update later...

 As many of you who read my blog with any regularity know that I am not a fan of Shrub's Administration at all. Many of you know that I voted for him in 2000...and I regret that vote all the way. Every chance that I get on my blog I like to go after topics and issues that Shrub has screwed up or lies about. Now don't take me as just a simple Bush hater. I hate him for sure, but my hatred is of equal opportunity. I really just hate overall politicians and the system overall. I think that it is no longer for the people at all and has been corrupted by money for not even "special interests" anymore...it is now just the government works for the corporations. Unfortunately the average citizen is poorly informed of the past. Most people simply don't know history. So lemme give you a quick little American History lesson. Really I will only focus on the latter part of the 1800's and then this past century the 1900's. In the late 1800's the nation saw the rise of Robber Barons. These men were "capitalists" of first class ratings...something that many current businessmen would love to emulate and move towards once again. These Robber Barons exploited labor, exploited the land all for the mighty dollar. There was very little regulation of business at that point in time and the Robber Barons spent vast amounts of money on politicians to keep it that way. These "men" made their wealth on the backs of other real men and never gave back or rarely gave back. The 1930's saw some change in the air. The depression was in full effect and the average citizen was suffering either working many hard long hours for almost nothing (with the fear that if they tried to stand up to their employers that they would be fired...and if you had a job you were lucky and did nothing to rock the boat). The wealthy continued to do well. As a matter of fact their wealth soared while the average American barely and rarely put food on their tables. Some people that had both money and a conscious saw that it wasn't really right and with their political positions started to do something that had never happened before. The government started passing laws that limited what businesses could do to employees and started to give the employees sort of sharing in wealth. The government also embarked on a public works building spree. During this time we saw thousands of miles of roadways paved, the Hoover Dam...you get the idea. Also Social Security was also passed during this revolutionary period. Basically what was happening was that the government wasn't taking from the rich or redistributing wealth...instead it leveled the playing field as best as possible and with the leveling that allowed for ordinary Americans to move forward and earn more money. These laws and regulations continued for years. New things happening all the time. The minimum wage laws, child labor laws, the EPA, and many other things came into being. These changes were happening all the way into the 70's. Nixon was the President that signed the EPA into law and existence. Sure Democrats were usually at the center of the social programs and the ones who pushed hard...but if we look back we can see that many prominent Republicans actually proposed and passed many of the social programs. In the eighties things really changed...do we need to say why. The middle class is not an actual entity. It is not natural in a capitalist system. There are two levels period. You are either wealthy or poor...no in between. The side effect or symptom of many of the social programs and laws that were passed to protect workers and the environment actually produced the middle class. The middle class was a byproduct of these laws. During the eighties the Reagan administration started to dismantle many of those laws...well no they would take a bolt out here and a nut there...and while the laws remained they were weakened. Same thing happened under Bush 1. Clinton reversed some of the trend but in many other ways helped it along. This Bush...GW...he has really dismantled a lot of those laws and programs. Not quietly but with glee and in the open. Now that many of these things have been taken apart guess what has happened. The Middle Class has almost completely disappeared. The class will be extinct in a short time. Which brings me to what I really wanted to talk about...and that is jobs. Right now our economy is in full recovery...or so the administration line goes. Well we really aren't if you are on the street or in public. Hey the stock market has been doing well (up until this past week and this week), but as I have said many time...Wall-Street has nothing to do with the real world. Sure they can be an indicator of how weak or strong the economy is...but it is by no means a predictor of job or economic growth. Sure we are seeing growth...but much of it is credit card economic growth. The government is spending money like it grows on a tree and that helps grow the economy because they are buying stuff. Sooner or later that has to end because they will run out of credit. Some companies are doing great...but their bottom lines have improved through layoffs, increased productivity from remaining employees, and lastly (but growing quickly as a reason to worry) through outsourcing and offshoring (outsourcing is being used incorrectly most of the time...that means to part out work to a contractor...offshoring is the correct term...it means that jobs are actually going overseas or out of the country). Jobs have not been created. Sure the unemployment numbers have been falling, they are falling because so many jobless people have used up assistance, and stopped looking for work altogether. This means that our workforce is actually shrinking...and that is bad news. Last month there were 21 thousand new jobs. However none of them were created in the private sector. All the jobs were created by government at the state and local levels. Really this all wraps around to that right now we are looking at an unprecedented time in our history. We once again are seeing the rise of the Robber Barons just like in the beginning of the 20th century. I just hope that we are not doomed to repeat history...Unfortunately the adage stays true and never fails. If you don't know where you have been you won't know where you are going...or something like that. The parallels are frightening...only this time the stakes are higher with abilities of the armies of the world to destroy the world many times over...and on top of it all our Environment is so battle scared that whether or not the planet can support us if we don't do something to conserve what is left is up in the air. I hope we can fix things...but I hold little hope because the ordinary American has such a lack of knowledge about history...and this all isn't even ancient history...rather it is recent and you would think we could at least remember back 20, 30, 50 years. Read up folks...then act to change.

 Well I am finally back home. You have no idea how different it is to go from a sleek little laptop or notebook back to a clunky desktop...even though my desktop is far from clunky. The main thing is relearning typing. Of course the notebooks keyboard is smaller...and this is much bigger...but you wouldn't really notice unless you go from using a notebook exclusively back to a keyboard...I guess...maybe...I dunno...if you have ever had to make the adjustment you would know. Well there isn't much to say outside of that I got a feeding tube placed. YAY! Well small case yay...it hurts like a bitch and will do so for a few more days I am sure...and all I have is really a pea shooter for elephant pain. Oxycontin is great for long term pain, Oxycodone is great for minor, dull, easily numbed pain, but this is elephant hurts like a bitch needs morphine or dilaudid pain killer level. It really hurts like a bitch. Not that those pain killers take away all the pain, but they take away the constant nag pain and leave only the sharp pains that accompany coughs and sudden movements. So right now I am in pretty bad pain. Now that I am home I hope I can get a hold of people over the next few days depending on I am feeling. If I am in a shitload of pain then fuck it...I am going to be a hermit. If the pain is manageable then I will call people...because even breathing deep hurts like a bitch... Well goodnight all...I am going to try and get a little sleep and another 1000 calories while I attempt to sleep....yippie!

 This update is going to be short as all I can muster is shortness right now. My laptop is going to have to go back in to the shop because the DVD/CD-R/RW is on the fritz. It still burns CD, and sometimes it will read CD's, but it will not read DVD's. I have tried several and two were new DVD's...so we know it isn't the media. This frustrates me because my last Toshiba was reliable up until the end when it started to not read CD's. We are going to see what we can do because frankly if the laptop is going to have to keep going into the shop then I don't want the hassle. So we are going to see if we can just get a refund...this make two serious problems in three months and I don't want to risk anymore. If we get it returned then I will go completely insane and get an E-Machines laptop. M6805 Model, Mobile Athlon 64 3000+ (1.8Ghz), 512MB RAM, 60GB Hard Drive, ATI 9600 with 64MB graphics, 15.4" screen, DVD/CD-R/RW. The package is 1500 or something close to that and a 100 dollar rebate. I hope that they will take this piece of crap back so I can give something else a go. I just don't want to have fight with it anymore...and I foresee that I will be returning this thing back to the shop a lot...and if that is the case then it certainly not worth the time or energy. Jeesh...everythings gotta fight.

 I haven't updated in a few days again...I am getting lazy about this whole blogger thing. I need to get my ass back on the ball and get back to my political speeches and general hate towards all sorts of things conservative and crap that is even remotely associated with the Neo-Con right and their hate filled group. Ok so what new is happening in my little world...outside of getting a little better each day not much. I am trying to get myself up to full speed and then find something to do until I get a transplant...if I get a transplant. My sister got a job offer...essentially a little over 50 thousand a year...that makes me feel like a complete and total loser...which I am. I am never going to be employable...it is as simple as that. No one or company will employ me for any length of time because I am not healthy...and to even think about insurance...hahahah forget about it. Getting the transplant will change all that right? Nope...not in the least. First of all a transplant is not a cure, nor is it a permenant solution in all reality. A transplantee has a 50% chance of survival out to 5 years...odds haven't been given to me for after that time. So in reality...or bringing the elation back down to Earth and actually thinking critically about it, at best a transplant adds five years to your life, or life as such. You can figure that the first year even if things go swimingly well you will still spend most of it recovering and getting up to speed. The remaining years can be broken up into another two phases as I see it. The first phase is good health overall as far as the lungs are concerned and not many problems. The second phase is probably the last year or so of that time (or a persons life if you want to be real about it) you see your health decline and problems start popping up and you start to get sick and feel like shit. You then die. Hey...I am just being real about it. So what does this have to do with me and a job? I want to be productive in some way. Earn money so I can do things and get a Mini Cooper. I just want to be normal as possible. I know that I cannot be. I have so much in my head and so much that I feel that I have to say...but I have no credentials, I have no voice, I am a mute in a world full of people with bullhorns. Maybe one day someone will see what I feel, but that day must come soon as I don't know what I am going to do. I haven't decided to definitely get the transplant, I haven't decided on anything so who knows. I am tired...and Taken is on. I am going to lay down for a bit and watch that...and read Michael Moore's "Stupid White Men"...so far a pretty vicious book...in a way that makes me wanna go and take money directly from rich whitey. Peace...

 Ok well it again has been a few days and that was because I went to the hospital and while I got my laptop back I didn't have the proper cable to sign on and update...although I wasn't really all that much in the mood to do much of anything seeing that my ass was broken. They put me on GoLytly (I am not sure of the spelling)...that stuff works and works well. They should have given that to me a while back because it has been the only thing that has worked repeatedly and regularly. Well my ass is working again and that is good. I only spent two days there this time. I am hungry but I can't figure out what I want to eat and frankly I have little desire to cook anything. Well I am going to stop my bitching and go to bed. Love to all...peace out.

 I haven't written to this thing in a few days because my ass is broken. Yes it is broken. I haven't been able to go to the bathroom since I left the hospital. That hurts and sucks...so now I have to try and get it fixed. Hopefully I won't have to go back in to get it fixed...hopefully it can be fixed with something from the drugstore...because I don't want to go back in for a broken ass.

 Sick boy here...hehehehe...Well at least I have my sense of humor. May not have all my health but I still have my humor. Today has been a long day even though I have slept (YAY!) through most of it. Nothing else to say really...just out of words and thought right now. Peace...

 Well I am back in the hospital this evening...yay for me. Its ok because I am getting sick and I need to be here to get things well again...or at least keep things from getting to far out of hand. It will already be hard enough to get these bugs under control so might as well get started as early as possible before a deep infection gets itself entrenched in there. Outside of that I am still damn tired and I am hoping that while here in the hospital I will get a little sleep which would be nice...especially if I can get a cocktail of things that will knock me out. Well I am tired and I stink from my PEG (feeding) tube...it smells south of cheese. Oh by the way folks if you get a chance go see Ladykillers...damn funny movie that ends very differently than what you may think. While many critics have panned it calling it schlock essentially. I beg to differ. It is a Cohen brothers film which by default is quirky comedy, it also inherits a great use of the English language (and coming out of Tom Hanks he just does it justice even with the weird accent...almost correct for the place in MS that he says he is from), but the comedy is intelligent and you have to think about some things. Let me help a few of you out there with one thing from the movie. When Hanks is introducing all the cohorts to each other and he gets to the General and describes him as a tunnelling expert from French Indochina...that means Vietnam, rather seeing that he was a General and a tunnelling expert then he is North Veitnamese. I am sure that many people don't know that...especially if you were raised during that period as it is not really a thing that they teach you in school...and many college profs. don't tell you that either. It is just a little bit of Jeopardy Knowledge...but it is accurate. Also one other thing. For those who are looking at the screen and wondering who Mr. Pancake is. He is the Psychiatrist from the Original "Law and Order"...he replaced Dr. Olivet somewhere around 96-97 I believe. Anyways that is who he is so you don't rack your brains to hard. I am tired and worn out...so I will rest now. Peace...

 Oh and I have been sneezing like sneezy dude...all the damn time. Plus I can't keep warm or cold either way. I end up uncomfortable so that sucks and that is why I can't get a good nights sleep...I get hot and sweat then I get cold and shiver...then it happens all over again. I have tried all sorts of things including turning the heat up so I wouldn't need blankets...buff dat'...didn't work. Tried turning the heat down and cracking the windows to get it cool in there...nope...so I might need to get to the hospital to get some damn sleep. Gaa!!!! Peace again....

 Sorry for the lack of posts. I am sick yet again and my PEG (feeding tube) is infected. I went to the doc today and he thinks it is and put me on yet another anti-biotic. I am coughing a lot more and shit...tomorrow morning one of the nurses from the clinic will be calling me and if I am not feeling the slightest better she will get Dr. P and see what he wants, which will be head to hospital. Do not pass go, do not collect 200 dollars. Which I guess will be ok because they will be able to get me back on drugs that will knock my ass out for a bit so I can get some sleep. I haven't been sleeping hardly at all...and it sucks ass! Oh and speaking of 200 dollars I went to the Social Security Office and got some things straightened out and the money that has been deducted from my monthly SSD money for Medicare A+B will be refunded to me...now the problem is for how long back...I have been paying it since Oct 2002. PA picks up the cost of that when you are in a position like myself, disabled and not doing well...and while they should have been paying all this time something and some people didn't do there jobs...of course. So now we have it straightened out. I will be looking at between 600-900 back from them if they go all the way back to Oct 2002...normally they wouldn't go far that back (the state) but because they screwed up in the first place they are at least going to review the case and it looks like I will get some sort of chunk of change back. I will know on May 25 what the news is and how much I guess....nonetheless is that they will be picking the cost up from now on. Well I am headed to bed...I feel like shit and I think that I will end up in the hospital tomorrow. Peace...

 I may be going home on Monday if nothing goes majorly wrong between now and then. Well dinner is here and I am a little hungry I guess. Peace

 Well my port is getting infected again. Whoopie! Outside of that I am headed down to physical therapy to walk on a treadmill and work with weights. Does anyone know how much I dispise physical activity, I avoid it at all costs because I am pretty lazy when I am aloud. Well I am going to finish this lunch and then go to therapy....

 I watched the Bush's little press conference and he yet again has confirmed that he is one dumb ape. I find it hard to take seriously any person who says "terrists" and "my fello merricans". He seems to not be able to read very well because when he was reading his speech he had trouble sounding out some of the words. The Q&A was a joke. It was so staged that Andrew Loyd Webber would have been proud. When he was asked questions about whether or not he felt that he was in some part responsible for letting our guard down, or simply to appologize he said "I think back to that day and it makes me sick". What did he have some bad crab cakes that day? The correct responce should have been of sorrow and looking for absolution because he and his staff have clearly to many now, fucked up. Even more now then ever I feel that the people in power of this nation at that time knew exactly or knew well what was going to happen and to be able to get their way they let it happen. Since then we have invaded a nation that had nothing to do with terrorists. A nation that happens to be sitting on massive amounts of oil. Now I people may say "yeah the oil thing" in the classic way thinking that it is for our nation. Actually we get very little of our current oil needs out of the middle east. However Europe's oil and natural gas suplies come from that area. This is giong to be an economic card that we can use down the road to either hinder the European's economy or ability to make war. So what I see is that we just bought ourselves a little insurance because down the road the next major power will be coming out of Europe both economically and militarily. Imagine if the Europeans joined with Russia. All of a sudden you have a massive power that cannot be stopped. With our control over at least Europe's supply of oil and fuel we can dissuade them from challenging us. The Russians have their own oil fields...but we are making a play for that as well. Afghanistan, Kazakstan, and several other "stans" and those nations around the Ural Sea are sitting on the same oil that supplies the Russian oil fields. While we can't turn off the tap to them, we can certainly reduce the overall supplies available. Of course at the same time that oil that we now kinda own is great collateral towards issuing bonds and such. Bush was lieing on stage there as he was lieing back in 2003. I feel for the people that don't understand the larger picture here. To get what the Neo-Cons want they had to have an initial attack against us. So when this came down the pipe instead of preventing it, or even feining that they were doing something, they let it happen and then had their reason for starting this war against others. The war on terror is not a valid war. War by definition is against a state actor and cannot be against a group or idea. I feel for those parents of soldiers that are so misled and still support what is going on. If I were a parent today and a child of mine was faced with having to go into a war like this then I would have to say no and protest loudly because as I said....war can only be waged against a State (Nation), not ideas or a group. For those who have lost loved ones in Iraq...I am sorry. I am sorry that I cast my vote this last time for Bush. I am sorry for the party that I used to belong to. I am sorry that your children are having to go over to Iraq in my stay for something that is absolutely wrong. The problem with being there now is that if we pull out cold turkey then the place will fall into shambles and many will suffer and die, if we stay there we will loose many more people and our nation will once again be forced into a draft. Yes folks a draft. It will be the only way that the military will be able to get enough warm bodies to put over there if the plan even to deploy 100,000 for the time being (we already have gotten the hint that we will need around 140-150 thousand at all times for a long time...and that doesn't give us a sure victory). Right now our military is really stretching thin. How can we tell this? Because we are calling up even National Guardsman because they already have deployed most of the reservists and all of the active duty. Now you have many soldiers over there being told they will have to stay longer than the anticipated year they were initially told. Pretty soon they will run through all of the troops they can rotate through and then they will have to draft people. The draft boards just recently have been calling on local delegates to come in for training and other stuff. The official story is that the Draft Board people are at the end of their 20 year commitments and that new people are needed. That doesn't was though considering the draft was ended in the early to mid 70's then the newest of the board members would have been done in the ealry to mid 90's. Now we are remanning the Draft Boards. Sounds fishy, and considering that the Administration has been really good at lieing (not covering up though). Another small note I would like to say. When one senior government employee comes out and says that the administration is doing this or that. You can say "well maybe they have sour grapes". The second employee, well he was fired so he has a bone to pick. Third person the same story about this and that. By about the dozen or more employees and some being very high up like Clarke and O'neill with no reason to lie (becuase their asses are on the line as well) then you have to start to think and believe that all of these people can't be making it up. The conclusion that a person has to come to is that the Administration really was doing all of the things they were accused of (especially when it was confirmed over and over again by different people) then they must have been doing it. When the White House then launches a smear campaign against the people speaking out, that should also be a hint that the White House has much to cover up. If Clarke and O'neill were really as bad as the administration says they were then why didn't they fire them earlier and why didn't they come right out when the person was gone and level the accusations against them before they spoke out. It is all too convieniant that after these people blow the whistle is when the smear starts and not when they left or before they started to talk. This is just rational people. I will take all of those supposed "sour grapes eatin" people's word over just a few like Bush, Cheney, Ashcroft, and Rumsfeld. We all know what those "men" have done, they have drug us into wars and taken away many of our freedoms, so I don't trust any of them. I trust the recently unemployed from the Bush white house. Peace

 Ok so Ashcroft is a moron and a lier. Notable Quotes: "Evil Chemistry" "Evil Biology" Ben-Venista - "So you had no experience in dealing with Washington beauracracy" Ashcroft on his private jetting about because of "threats". "I still fly on commercial airlines for personal business, as a matter of fact my wife just flew on a commercial carrier." And the excuse as far as I could tell for not using commercial airlines all the time was because of his security detail carrying weapons and that poses problems on airliners. He just needs to be bumped off so he can sit by his father...Satan. He is evil...very evil. Listen to him sing sometime and you will know that he is evil. He sings like a bad televangelist. Now that is evil. Oh he wants more power for Patriot Act and finds no fault in holding people secretly and indefinitely. EVIL I TELL YOU...I think even Satan would shove pinapples up his ass.

 Ok so I got my computer rebuilt in about 3 hours with all the basics. The only thing that is really left to do is install a few media players and codecs, and update Windows. The updating is a long process because while the Cell phone connection is faster than dial-up, it is still slow for big files. I am hoping that maybe I can get up and running here soon and get moved on with my life. It is time. I don't know what I will do for money or a job as I don't have a degree (and frankly my health even if I get a transplant may still be an issue...the transplant doesn't cure you...it only "fixes" the problem). I am hoping that when I get moved on I can live comfortably and with niceties...but nothing fancy. I just want to finally be free from everything and on my own as best as I can. Realistically I know this can't and won't happen unless I go through with transplant. I was dead set against one for years, then I decided to go ahead, now I am just having doubts and fear and not feeling right about it all. I mean I have done stupid things and wasted my life up to this point and not accomplished much of anything...why do I deserve another shot at it all? Will I do it differently? I really can't answer that. I wish I could. I am just frightened and frankly I still have no one to talk too. When I was in school still I went to the counseling center every week for a little over a year (well at least while I was there and it was open). I had a great counselor...but while it helped for a few hours or maybe a day afterwords I would crash right back down into my self loathing state. I don't want pity or anything like that...I may have sought it at one time but it never did any good. The problems always remained the same. I am self destructive in many ways...all of them attributable to the fact that I will die young if I don't get a transplant, and if I did I could only look forward to a few extra years realistically. It really is a hard position to be in. My family seems to be pushing for the transplant and just assumes that I want to do it and will do it because I have gone through the procedures to get listed. I got listed simply because I would rather be listed and not accept, then not and all of sudden find myself in the position that only a transplant will save me and me not being on the list would basically be the death nell. I don't know how to approach it all. This is new and there are no answers. I feel really alone. I have people around me, my family supports me, and I have a few people that I consider my friends (but don't ever see them because of my poor ass health). There was a brief period where I didn't feel alone but the person that was in my life at the time felt alone with me because I couldn't open up (which I couldn't without looking like I was seeking pity). I have never felt that way again and frankly I won't. Simply because I don't have the energy or drive to even consider getting into another relationship unless I literally fell into one (in other words I don't even have to work at it outside of being nice...and that ain't happening anytime soon). So what to do, what to do. I hate to post these words because it leaves me open...but I promised myself that I would never self censor unless it was for legal reasons...otherwise everything and everyone was fair game. It has gotten me into trouble with some friends and family because I have pretty much stuck with that. That is what this blog is about. The complete lack of censorship, and just plain out stupidity on my part (because I have a lot of stupid thoughts and many people read them here). This blog is not my ultimate chronicle or anything, but it is a telling of my attitude from day to day and my political leanings because it all ties together for me. My life is thinking to much, writing jibberish, being outraged at the latest things coming out of D.C. (from all sides because most of our law maker I am sure are just plain retarded...or crooked as hell...or both). Hell it is all tied together...and for me I feel that it is my welfare that is at stake when those morons get a good idea. When they want to reform Medicare, that effects me. When they cut back on funding for health care funding to the states, well that effects me. The cut the budget for education. That effects me because students get dumbers, and sooner or later those students become workers and with most of them being dumb (even ones that get a college degree) by thinking that the American way is avoiding their duty...and the Christian way is not helping people (that one I will never get...where in the bible does it not say to help your fellow man...the Bible says over and over again to help them)...but damn when workers wages go down they pay less into the system that helps keep me alive. When we go to war I get worried. Not because my ass will be on the imediate front...but because when we go to war things at home go to shit. With this war that our "leaders" have gotten us into could very well involve us all (and I believe that the essentially good...but stupid people of the USA will reap the whirlwind of how or leaders have abused and run our good names into the ground). So everything that goes on I think about. I am selfish I guess...but it is because the welfare of society that it effects me. If society as a whole is doing well, people are working, kids are learning something outside of pigskins and sports stats, and we are at peace with our neighbors on this tiny planet then things will be good for me (and everyone else). If things are shitty...sooner or later that shit falls on us here. My biggest fear is that we are already to late to fix things. We could start doing things correctly tomorrow but that won't guaruntee that things will be ok...it is still a role of the dice for that. Yet our "leaders" and many of my fellow Americans think that screwing up our planet (in any number of ways) is ok and that we still have time to fix it...let the technology mature a little and the cost come down and then we will implement things. Well fuck people...things don't get less complicated unless you are implementing them, prices don't fall if the products aren't ever offered (even novely in the case of the GM electric car). Then we have the people that do want things to change sabotaging things as well. I have the solution to how to get "free" hydrogen without using nuclear reactors or stripping it from hydrocarbons (fossil fuels...which kinda defeats the purpose if you still need gases to fuel your hydrogen vehicle). The answer is simple...but it is scary because we have to become godlike. We have algea that goes around making the vast majority of our oxygen on this planet...we know how to tinker with the basics of genetics. I am sure with enough funding and trial and error we could come up with a bacteria or algea that instead of belching out oxygen it spews hydrogen. Hey the new bugs and stuff you create that don't work...well destroy them and then they can't slip into the wild. As for the bacteria or algea that does work you control it carefully because you don't want it taking over and making our atmosphere toxic (and we could even engineer a way to kill it directly without harming other algeas or bacteria). However we have those nuts who see any form of genetic engineering for any purpose as bad and they forget that man has been playing with genetics for thousands of years. Man has been for all of agricultural time been crosspollenating and creating new species or types of corn, wheat, and all sorts of plants. The have orange trees that spit out grapefruit as well. So we have been doing it for a long time now...only now we understand what we are doing and have better tools to work at the genetic level than ever before. Sure its scary...but we have to go down the road or someone else will. That is the problem here in our nation. Once we were adventurers. Once we took chances. We made many mistakes and screwed up a lot as well as being the cause of most of the environmental problems. However now instead of being bold we are being timid and not facing issues. Instead of venturing out we are shuttering ourselves in just like any other fundamentalist society. We are slipping back into another dark ages because we are being told that progress is evil...and because we are so afraid they may be right we defer to their judgement when in reality those are the very people that have caused much of the untold death and suffering throughout the ages. Yet they accuse anyone who wants to move on and progress as people who want to destroy life. Wake up people. Those are all the things I ponder daily...and for many of those reasons they are why I have doubts about a transplant...because if I can puss out without pussing out before all the shit hits the fan...I would rather do that then try to survive through what I feel are impending horribly dark and dangerous times. The only way we can even think of avoiding those bad times is by changing things completely...and rebuilding almost from the ground up. I am also thinking about this whole capitalist system and think that it is a model that cannot work. Like Dr. Nash has pondered if we all are attempting to attain the same goal then all of us will loose. So we need to rethink what we are doing. Do that...if nothing else think about these things. We won't suffer a loss of quality of life if we no longer "make" money but instead earn a living. Changing from fossil fuels to hydrogen and other power sources will not cost us as much as we think...it will cost less than having to invent some sort of technology to scrub the atmosphere or running it so far into the ground that only the rich survive because they can afford to rocket off this rock that they screwed up through poor leadership. All leaders are rich...all of the rich are leaders. It isn't a coincidence...it is the sad fact. Those few that are born leaders rise to be rich. Those rich that aren't leaders loose it all. Just think... Peace

 Well I did it today. I pissed my mom off. Over something stupid too. I have been watching Band of Brothers on The History Channel and have been really enjoying it. The couple of nights that my mom has been here during the show she starts to knatter on about one thing or another...tonight it got to me. She told some story tonight about a skit on MadTV...she thinks I didn't listen but I did...heard every word of it. It just wasn't funny and when she was telling me in the middle of the show I was less able to pay attention. The respiratory therapist was in here to beating on me so they were chatting back and forth making it very difficult for me to hear what was going on. Tonight I just let her know...obviously it was the wrong way. I just said "I will just catch it later tonight"...she then just went off. Now I know I am an ass sometimes and I haven't been in the best mood for a while now but I really didn't mean for her to take it that way. I meant it literally that I would just catch what I missed later on. No biggie. It makes no difference what I say or do most of the time. I just have this knack at pissing my family off. It will blow over sooner or later I just wish that things like this wouldn't happen...I guess I will just have to muzzle myself...but even then I will catch flack because of not talking enough...six one way, half dozen the other. I know that I said it wrong and I know she overeacted...I just wish that wouldn't happen. Ah well what can I do about it...not much she is already offended and she will take it out on me for a few days.

 Just dropping a line in on the blog so people won't think I'm dead. I just don't have the energy to do a lot of typing and thinking right now. I have some things to say but I want to get this page updated before I do another taxing post. So I am going to work on the layout (or style) tomorrow and hopefully it will be up and running tomorrow as well. I am still thinking about getting a private domain and hosting...I just haven't decided what I would do with it all. Well until later...peace.

 Well my room is painted and I have gotten it all re-arranged and stuff. It is in its summer configuration. It really is hard getting used to a full size keyboard...jeesh. Well I am going to hit the sack because I need to finish cleaning tomorrow and then I have to help my mom with the collectables down at this fleatique thingy...I can go sit for a few hours and be bored or something.... Well night all. Peace

 I forgot to tell ya'll what I did the other day when I went out for trouble. Well I went to a movie. I went to see Man on Fire with Denzel Washington, Dakota Fanning, Christopher Walken, Mickey Rourke, and Mark Anthony. I will say this now. Washington is a serious contender for another Oscar for this movie, and I would also go out on a limb and say that also filmography or whatever the catagory is that Black Hawk Down won in the film department. This film was not only brilliant...and it most certainly is not the same schlock that just keeps getting pumped out over and over again. I have been thinking about what to say about the movie and first I can say that Dakota Fanning is going to be around for a while because she not only held her own with Washington but also in some cases took the scene and made it hers. I could see a supporting Actress nomination but I doubt the Academy would have the balls. Walken delivers probably the best monologue that I have heard in a long time. It start with a little banter back and forth between himself (an ex assasin for some sort of government agency) and a Mexican equivalent of an FBI agent. The Agent asks something to the effect of "what did she mean to him", Walken "she showed him how to live again". Walken "you see every man has his art something they are very good at. Creasy's art is death. He...is about to paint his masterpiece." Ok so while it is not the exact lines from the script or movie...it is damn close and frankly dead on. No one but Walken could have delivered that line...no one. Not one single other actor known could have made that line as stunning, chilling, fascinating, and riveting as he did is less than 30 seconds of speaking. If you were to hear that in real live you would shit yourself because the way he delivered it, the line was absolutely perfect, cold, and telling all in one. So if you get a chance go see it. Warning that some parts are rought...but the rough parts are few and far between...and not shown in great lengthy detail. One other memorable line that was really good. Pita (Fanning) : "Creasy. What was the name of your first girlfriend?" Creasy (Washington) : "Nanya" Pita: "Nanya?" Creasy : "Nanya Business now get back to work" One other note on Man on Fire...much of the music was done by none other than our good old northern boy Trent Reznor of NIN....The stuff he did for this is just mind boggling. As soon as you hear the first few measures you know it is him if you know his former work. Go buy Underworld as well. Damn fine movie....and Kate just looks hot in Leather and with guns....she could turn me into a vampire anyday. Grrrooowwwwwlll! And yes there will be some changes soon. I am working on something here. Peace

 Updated a few things...

 My friend...B over at Brassmask.com and his wife just had their baby about a week and a few days ago. I can remember when they had just met like it was just yesterday...and now they are a family. That is the part of time that I do like when it passes when a great pair of people get together, make a life, and then create a life, and I know that they will raise their child with love and enlightenment. With all the grumbling that I do about things passing me by and life moving every once in a while I get word of news of something wonderful and something that I can look at and just be happy about. This is one of those times. This update is dedicated to Benjamin. My love out to you and your parents. Peace

 Ok...it has been well ten days since I last updated and I am sorry. The last few days that I was in the hospital they had to remove the port in my chest and go back to regular old arm IVs. Well the problem with that is that my arms don't really have good veins anymore due to all the prior IVs that I have had. Really I have maybe, I stress maybe four veins they can hit. The rest...shot. The veins they can hit are all in places that prevents me from using my hands...two on the wrists and two on the underside of the forearms. All of those locations are not ideally suited for typing or using mice...or really anything. Plus on top of it the veins are weak and when you put oh say benadryl into them...it burns the piss out of them. So to get my meds I have to dilute them down greatly and it takes forever and a day to get everything in...so it is incoveniant. The reason they had to remove my port was because of a persistant fungal infection. I have had so many anti-biotics they have killed off all the good little bacteria on my skin that eat the fungus that we all have. So I got a fungal infection that stuck to the actual rubber in the port and it just wouldn't let go so they ripped it out. Next time I go in (oh say in a week or two) I hope that my fungal infection will be under control to a point where they can go ahead and put another port in me...because when you need the anti-biotics and all the other things that I get when I am in, you really need to have a port. So hopefully I will get one put back in. If that doesn't happen then I will get a PICC line which is in the arm...it is uncomfortable but it can take a lot of abuse and a lot of meds and it doesn't burn. It is just a pain in the ass. I did get out of the hospital...on Sunday to be exact. I can honestly say that I don't feel all that well but I don't feel to terrible. I just want a week, maybe two of good times and decent health, and maybe decent sleep. I can dream. Well I talked to one of my old friends yesterday. She is getting married in September (or Septembre' if French...if I remember correctly). It came as a shocker to me...but hey everything is anymore. I have been left in the brokedown duck lane of lifes highway. I can't swim, I can't waddle, and I sure as hell can't fly...so I just have to watch everything and everyone go by. My sister is done with a Doctoral level degree, my "friends" are mostly done and gone, many on the road to the rest of their lives, while I just sit here sick and not able to move forward. I want to but I can't. Well enough wallowing for right now...I am going to get cleaned up and do something today. It is a nice day and I am free, white, and over 21...so I can do what I want...well within reason and my credit limit. So off I go to see what kind of trouble I can get into without getting into trouble. Maybe a movie or two, food...and soon I will be able to get my PA license and then nights out drinking till I'm blind will come...because hey with my liver functions anymore that would be oh say a beer or two...hehehehe... Off I go...peace out peeps... Oh and something that I wanted to say that struck me as oxymoronic. A few weeks back we had the NRA national convention here in Pittsburgh. Vice President Dick was coming into town to speak to some of the attendees. The ironic part of it was that they had security out the ass and all of the attendees had to go through security checks and metal detectors. Now call me silly but this dinner and speaking engagement put on by the NRA was on gun rights and such (I must mention that I am a lifetime member...a gift from a family member and I happen to believe in the Second Ammendment...I believe that you can own a howitzer and as long as you never use it inapropriately and for a crime then go right ahead...but I do also believe that some form of double blind registration should be in place so that you can't locate a person through records but you can tie a person to a gun kinda thing for some measure of accountability). Back to what I was saying being a dinner and speech by the NRA it strikes me funny that they would have metal detectors for all of the "law abiding" people to catch guns. If their was no danger from even this group of normally avid Republican supporters why would they need all that security for the VP. Very oxymoronic. Peace.

 Well I pretty much have things straightened out with the laptops. It is taking a bit to become accustomed to the smaller keyboard. I am also lucky because I got a G-Mail account today. 1GB of online storage. I can get huge emails! Well I feel like hell because my kidneys hurt like a bitch. If they don't stop hurting soon I am will call the doctor and see what to do. I took some Ibuprofin and they don't hurt as much, but I can't take a lot of it because it can hurt your kidneys. Well I am off for now. Peace

 Well tomorrow I have to finish up the laptop game so it is ready for my sis when she comes. I got her a card and will have it on the laptop when she gets here. Tomorrow I just have to get data off of it and then toss in the restore disk. After the restore disk runs I will then install a full version of Office 2003, Norton Systemworks 2004, Norton Anti-Virus Pro 2004, and Nero 6.3.1.6 (latest version and the version that is working with my DVD burner). Then I will tidy it up and get rid of some of the crap the restore disk will install and make it a little leaner then I will update it and get it ready to walk out the door. The laptop that I got today is indeed slower but not by much in processing, however I know that I will definitely have to get a RAM upgrade as soon as I can afford it. The graphics subsystem grabs memory from RAM and I have it turned down to just grab 16MB. Once I get more RAM I will let the buffer increase to 64MB. The only problem is that I will have to by a single big stick instead of just adding RAM. The laptop has only one RAM slot and it is used by the RAM that is in it now. Outside of the limited RAM it runs fine. I am surprised at how much the Athlon XP-M fluctuates in speed. It runs from down at 400Mhz when not doing much all the way up too 1.66Ghz when really busy, and it fluctuates fast. Well I am tired and I am having some sort of acid reflux thing that is making me want to puke...but I am holding it. Peace

 I have been trying to figure out what I want to do for my sisters graduation. Well I figured it out. I am downgrading. I am going to give her my laptop which will keep her for several years. It is practically new and has plent of horsepower for all she needs to do. I will get another laptop that suits my needs a little better. The Toshiba is just a little big for me to tote around. It weighs in at around 7 or 8 pounds with the power supply and for me to lug that in and out of the hospital is just getting to be a bit much. I found a good deal on a laptop for around 800 bucks. It is most certainly a downgrade from what I have now. The graphics subsystem is much less (S3 something to the Toshiba's Nvidia FX5200), the hard drive smaller by half (30gb to 60gb), and the processor less powerfull (Athlon XP-M 2000+ 1.67ghz to a Pentium M 1.4ghz...the Pentium M smokes everything in its class), but the big thing is that it weighs in at about 4.5 pounds with power supply. It is much smaller and will be easier to carry with me. Why would I do it? Because frankly I don't need the power of the bigger system. It will be a good replacement for her giving enough perfomance and durability for a couple of years at least. If I could afford a better system then my own I would get it for her but I can't so I will give her the more powerful system. I have my home computer which is more than enough for gaming when I game (which isn't often anymore) and the smaller system while not suited for games would be enough for what I need and that is surfing the net, writing, and watching DVD's while at the hospital. Well I am tired and I need some sleep...so I will update some tomorrow...I am going to call my mom and tell her what I am going to do and see what she thinks. Peace.

 Well good news today...well kinda. I am indeed sick again but not sick enough to go in the hospital. Doc is putting me on some oral antibiotics Cipro and Zithromax. So we will see. I don't react well to Cipro, my mouth gets sores and very raw. It is a painful side effect. I will only be on a ten day course so hopefully I won't get a raw mouth. I am on the Go list for a double lung transplant. I was talking with Brian online today from Brassmask . He asked the very questions that I have about all of this hoopla. The major questions that I have and if I got negative answers before a transplant may influence my decision are. 1. What happens when I fully reject the organs? Do I go back on the transplant list or is this a one shot deal? 2. Will they save some tissue for possible future growth of new perfect lungs once that technology is available? I have one answer already. They will be saving some tissue for research by one of my docs, but will it be available for making a new set once the technology is available. As for the other question...I really don't know the answer. The answers to the questions will influence my final decision. However if they call before I have the answers then I will go ahead with transplant and deal with all of that later (although I will ask for additional samples to be preserved). Am I ready for this all? Not really. I am not fully emotionally ready but I know that if thrust into it I would be ok. It just is something that I have to do. Well I am tired and I need some sleep. Peace

 I forgot to mention in other posts that I got my b-day present early this year (as almost every year for the past 6). My mom got me tickets to one of the best comics out there and I can't wait. I am going to see with my sister none other than George Carlin. He is probably the satirical comic out there. I cannot wait to see what he has ready for the masses in this tour. My PocketPC was having screen then synching problems that I was able to fix when I opened the puppy up and found a loose cable and a little resistor that had come loose. Once I fixed those problems my PocketPC is all ready for a date. I am going to take it along and hopefully will be able to get a good recording of the show. If it works I will be so happy. If he has CD's there then I will buy a couple (would rather do that). I am so happy...and even if I am in the hospital (which I probably will) I will drag the IV pole to the show...I ain't missin' it for nothing (short of transplant). Peace

 So today I was thinkin...yet again about Stem Cell research and the future of medicine in this nation. As I thought more and more I started to get pissed off about what has happened to Stem Cell research and how severely limited it has become in this country as far as government funding is concerned. One of the first big things that Shrub did when he got into office was to place a ban on harvesting new Stem Cell lines because of the misconception that all Stem Cells come from aborted fetuses. Because Bush is a pro-lifer (which should also mean that he wants to save lives but his other policies show otherwise such as pro death penaly and this horrible war in Iraq) he banned the harvesting of new lines because people are misinformed about the topic. Now I am not as informed as many out there but I do know that you can get Stem Cells from other sources outside of aborted fetuses (although they are the easiest to harvest these cells from). Quick science lesson. Stem Cells are basically blank slate cells that can develop into any kind of tissue for living animals. Stem cells need only DNA to tell them what to turn into (I don't think the scientists yet know how they know to become lung tissue where the lungs are or kidneys where they are). The promise of these cells is that you can program them to turn into anything that you need grown. They hold very little information from the start...they do contain DNA from the parents of the Stem Cells but that can be extracted or overwritten. As I said before Pro-Lifers wanted a ban on Stem Cell research altogether because the most common supply would come from aborted fetuses, however you can harvest some cells from the embilical cord right after birth. The ban at this point only includes retrieving new lines if government grant money is used. These grants basically say that you have to use one of the already existing lines harvested pre-new harvest ban. At the time Shrub gave some number and said that is enough...in reality there are only about a dozen or so viable Stem Cell lines to do research on. So you can see the scope of research will be limited. Outside foundations such as the Hughes Foundation (Howard Hughes) are allowed to harvest new lines at will, but I fear that may come to an end as well. A Hughes Foundation grantie has already grown new kidney cells from his research on these cells. Pretty soon they will be able to make filters for dialysis machines that use real himan kidneys cells and in doing so they could extend life expectancy on dialysis by years or more. The researcher hopes to soon be able to grow actualy kidneys for transplant within the next ten years. I believe he can do it. This opens up a realm of possibilities because if he is succesful the research could then be expanded to heart tissue, lung tissue, any type of tissue needed. It also holds promise of being able to make blood at some point (stem cells could even be taught to be blood cells or marrow that creates blood cells). Again the problem is an image problem nothing more. We need to change that image and make it human so that John Q. Public can understand and here is how I propose we do it. We go to old John there and ask him if little Bobby or little Suzy were dieing from some acute illness that effects the heart and their child has maybe at best a few months. Now they will also tell John that their child could be waiting years for a heart to become available but there is this new technology that can get the heart the child needs and put it in without fear of rejection. What do you think any sane or rational person would say? Of course they would want that procedure done. In bringing it that way and leaving how it is accomplished out of the picture you remove the horrible image of aborted fetuses from their minds. Now why do I think they need more lines than the few they have now since these cells are so versatile. I think that way because of the diversity of humanity. Lets say there are 7 billion people on the planet and maybe 20 million actual genetic trees (basically huge swaths of people in family tree like structures). In those 20 million or so trees there is great diversity. We only have a sampling of about a dozen of them now maybe not even that many. Down the road we may stumble into a situation where we really need to have that many lines just to get it right or get Stem Cells that develop tissue close enough to transplant without rejection into a patient. They may also find down the line that certain trees develop certain tissues better than others...like Stem Cells out of Arnold Swartzenegger's (sp) tree may be better at growing into muscle tissue and Stem Cell out of Einstein's (or Hawking's) would be better suited for nueral tissues. We don't know and we have already limited ourselves before we even got off the block. We need the research, we need the additional lines, we need to be at the forefront of this field. If we chose to do that then we could guarantee new jobs and better health. The possibilities are endless but we must first get over the negative image problem Stem Cell research has. For the Pro-Lifers' it is better to save something or get something good out of trajedy. All of this is self serving because for me the issue is clear. I need new lungs. Scientists one day in the future could take DNA from my lungs, fix the CF defect, then grow a new pair for me. This will happen in the next 10-15 years. It would be better to be on the edge of the wave for this or we will loose it to the world. Think about it...then educate yourselves. Peace

 I want to continue on the track that I started last night about our environment and the pending changes that are possible. The biggest problem that scientists have is that they cannot give definite timeframes all they can do is estimate what will happen and when it will happen. The reason they can't say for sure is because this is all new to us. There is no recorded history of how fast or when a huge climate change will occur. They just know what causes it and that it happens. There are several ways that our planet can be thrown into another ice age. We could have a meteor hit and have what would be essentially a nuclear winter where the sun is blocked out and the planet cools causing an ice age. We could have a nuclear war which would cause the death of probably 99% of the planets living things and then throw the planet into a nuclear winter and result in an ice age. The third way is how we are actually doing it...and frankly we don't know if its happened before or not. We are pumping out hundreds of million of tons of pollution each year easily. This polution then hangs around causing a thickening of the atmosphere which helps trap heat and warms our planet beyond an optimal temperature. This warming cause the polar caps to melt. We are already seeing that happen greatly. The polar ice is retreating more and more each year basically giving us a warning that something is wrong. The ice caps are the place you go to find out the health of the planet because even the slightest shifts in planet chemistry or balance show up there glaringly. You don't go to New Jersey to get a gauge on how polluted the Earth is, you go to the ice caps. You ask "how does global warming cause an ice age?". Well it is complicated yet very simple. In our oceans there are vast currents both shallow and deep. Sailors used to use them to get around and that is why for hundreds of years trade routes were pretty much the same because sailors were catching these currents. These currents actually serve more of a purpose than just getting boats around the ocean, they actually help keep the planets climate temperate and the oceans warm. As the polar ice caps melt they infiltrate these currents that are warmer than the surrounding ocean and cool them down. The effect of the cooling is that the currents first begin to shift and if the melting is extensive enough they could possibly stop alltogether. Now you can look at old sailing trade routes from hundreds of years ago. We have pretty good records from that period and they are fairly accurate. Now try and sail then and you will not have the same luck. The trade currents have shifted somewhat. Even if they have shifted a hundred foot you have to realize that a one hundred foot shift of a thing that has been happening for thousands of years is a major deal. To move billions of hectars of water one hundred foot requires huge energy being released. The engine for that energy is the melting ice caps. Not only do we shift currents the water level rises, and can rise drastically rather quickly. Look at Florence Italy. Sure it has always been the city of canals, and it has been sinking at a relatively constant rate for hundreds of years. Now it is sinking faster or so it would seem. Most likely the sinking is still at a constant rate but the water level is actually rising at an every increasing rate. The currents that are in the sea are much like the jetstream above in the skies. As the jetstream dictates weather, the ocean currents effect the weather of the ocean. As it shifts around and weakens the sea cools. Seeing that 97 percent of the planet is water, what happens when all that water cools? It eventually freezes. There is a movie coming out this summer called "The Day After Tomorrow". It will show what will happen in graphic detail. You may think it is just movie majic and movie hoopla but scientists have recently found that contrary to what was believed before that ice ages took many hundreds of years to happen and advance ice across land masses. The scientists have found that the changes from temperate climates to ice age climates took but a mear two to five years. In other words as far as geological terms a blink of an eye. The scary part about all of this is that we are already seeing the changes happening now. El-Nino and La-Nina (I don't have the proper accents at hand) have become much stronger and severe making there presence known. How many people can think back oh say fifty years and honestly say they knew those terms. Now most people have at least heard of them and many can desribe what they are. Well to scientists who study climate and climate shift they are a warning. Hey look here something is wrong. All of a sudden these things actually become a problem. The past few years we have seen much harsher winters than what we have become used to over the past several decades. When global warming first starts sure things get a little warmer but soon the temps drop and become colder. This year we have really seen the harshness of the new climate that we are facing. Right now in PA it is 50 degrees F. Normally or in the past the temps would be in the mid 70's or low 80's. The climate changes that we will see from now on will be more drastic and dramatic. This all ties back to ocean health and currents. If the largest percentage of our planet is unhealthy then it is bound to effect the rest of the planet. Another problem is that we don't know if we even change our ways today that it will make a difference at all. The damage may already be to extensive to avoid the catastophy that we are headed for. The only thing that we can say is that if we change things now we can curb some of the more catastrophic parts of what will happen. The military was even worried about it enough to write a report on how we should tailor our forces and what conflicts of the future will look like. So it is real. It is not just hippies and tree huggers that think this way. Respected scientists are seeing it, the military is worried, and some companies are making preperations. So the administrations and Republican line that it is voodoo science is crap. The line of science that they buy into is voodoo. They believe that there is a big guy in the sky that will make things all better should we screw it up bad enough, but they don't even believe that we are screwing things up. Conservatives just think they are entitled to 25% of the worlds resources and a huge chunk of the worlds pollution output. This all has to change. However it has to change from the top and the bottom at the same time. The top needs to lead and the bottom demand so the soft center will have to change and meet the challenge. I'm spent.

 Tonight I starting thinking more and more as I was driving back from dropping off videos about what this country needs and what Americans need especially seeing that this coming election could very well hold the very future of our nation as we know it at stake...not to mention that the world hinges on what America does environmentally in the next decade (if we even have that much time). If we stick with the way we have done things in the past and stick with the old ways then the Earth is destined to change. This change will kill a good portion of the population off. Now in reality...and if we keep doing things the way we are doing things then that won't really be a bad thing because if there are less resources then there has to be less population. It is a simple biological and ecological fact. If we stick with Bush we die...simple as that. He will not change things. If we choose Kerry we still may die...simple as that. The same people that fund Bush fund Kerry. There is no difference, or at least as far as the money is concerned there is no difference. What is different is the difference in possible environmental and ecological policies between the two. Bush as we know doens't give a flying fuck about the Environment. Most of the so called "good" environmental policies that will "help" are really just corporate give aways that enable companies to polute more while getting tax breaks. The "Clear Skies" Initiative, or so it is called, is really a cover that allows big polluters like coal fired power plants to pollute more. They accomplish this by creating a "credit" system. Each company that wants to pollute gets so many pollution credits (for various things like CO2 and Mercury). They use X number of each credit when they do what they do, like produce power. The problem is that these credits are transferable from company to company. What will happen (and it will even though they say they will have rules to prevent front companies to create bogus credits) is that big polluters will create front companies who's mission is to recieve the credits because they are going to make something, they then make the products but (albeit) efficiently (because remember it is cheaper now to build things to be efficient than inefficient and dirty) the extra pollution credits will then be either transfered or sold to the big polluters like coal power plants who don't really want to upgrade to clean technology. It is a system to replace the current clean air policies. Hey what is wrong with this system? Well look at it. I could theoretically set up a fake company...or even a real one that produces something. Then I could apply to get the polluter credits. I use 5 of my 50 credits. I then sell the other 45 for millions a year to a polluter. I get free money. Not a bad gig. Now imagine this happening tens of thousands of times over and over again. Big polluters could then collect more than enough credits to not have to worry about how much pollution it pumps out. The main problem with this new system is that there is no total credit cap for the nation. It is not like they are going to say that there are only 1 million credits available per year. If there was a total cap that was lower than what we are producing now (which under old law each year we are supposed to pump out less toxic and harmfull emissions) than the system would work. However the system allows for unlimited polluting as long as you have the money to purchase other peoples pollution credits. That is one of Bush's policies. So we know that he doesn't give a shit. He is only in it for big polluters who give him millions to run and make these new policies (which by the way don't have to pass through congress because it isn't law...just policy a big distinction). Whenever he either is voted out or gets through both terms (if Americans are stupid enough to vote him back in...hey I'm all American baby I can say we're stupid) he will get large endowments to his "library" which is funny because I am sure the longest book he has read was "Cat in the Hat". So... Kerry will at least keep the status quo and not do more damage and would roll it back to the old way. The big problem with Kerry is that he has no vision outside of "anything other than Bush" and frankly being a hoitie toitie he will loose against Bush unless he makes himself different and make a stand for a bigger picture, a big thing, something that will save us in both the real sense, but will save us economically by putting us on the forefront of a new world. This is what I propose Kerry do. Kerry needs to pull a JFK...as he so often notes that his initials are. He needs to say this and make it his motto. Hydrogen Powered Economy in ten years. Then he needs to outline how we get there, and here is how we do it. We are already using genetics and engineering stuff, we put money into it and tell our universities to engineer us an algie that burps out hydrogen instead of oxygen or methane (hell we can even strip hydrogen from methane), but coming directly out as pure hydrogen from these genetically engineered critters. Now I know the "purists" and those who are against genetic engineering would get all up in arms over it all but tell them "come up with a better system and we'll use it". All the mistakes that don't work simply destroy them, the one that does work we keep it locked up so it doesn't spread to the oceans. That takes care of hydrogen. We can do it in ten years. For hydrogen production we are going to need massive amounts of water. We either convert the massive oil pipelines we have running all over the nation or we build a new system, but we pipe water in out of the oceans. We then clean it and de-salinize it. Not only do you get the fuel for our fuel, but we could also have no shortage of potable water and irrigation water. The salt we take out we use as salt or we add it back to the sea in the correct amounts for the water that will drain back into the sea (seeing that there will be greater water runoff to the sea. So in this vision we not only get off of oil but we innovate and create jobs at the same time. If Kerry does that then guess what...he may have a chance. He has to think big...not just for the presidency but for the world. He needs it, we need it, and the world needs it. I hope he has the balls. Only two people in this race had this vision or something similar and had the balls to fight for it. Kucinich which he is a great man and Dean, who while isn't really a huge environmentalist he is a doctor and is educated well enough to know that we have to do it...not because it would be environmental...but because we have to. To keep on living we have to change our ways. Until next time...Peace

 Well my sister and I went to dinner with my mother and grandfather. Let me just put it this way. He is a two dimensional character not all that unlike Fred Flinstone. The difference is that he swears, is racist, smokes like a chimney, and is in the advanced stages of kidnay failure but still drinks like a fish and then heads out for a nice drive in his Town Car. We went to this place that I hate because the food is overpriced and the service is shitty, and they have lounge singers. I have a fixed amount of energy for each day. I was worn out within minutes of being there. One thing that happens is everytime I am driving with my mother and sister together I end up lost. Where this place is I don't know my way around. I got there fine with just my sister. When it was her and my mom with me driving shit just fucks up. My mother had said something about parts of the highway shutting down. I heard her say it during dinner but paid no mind because she said nothing when we stopped at a donut shop for some coffee for my sister. So I go to go back the way I came...on the highway. Well the way I need to go ends up being closed down. So I have to get onto the proper highway by going up an exit then planned on turning around. Well if I had turned around the traffic was detoured back to almost where we started. I ended up taking some bumwood road and it was a sheer guess as to where it lead...but we got to the detour route to get back on the highway. Now mind you this is my moms neck of the woods but she doesn't know North from South and got me turned the wrong way heading the opposite direction until I see a sign that told me we were headed the wrong way. Now I love my mother...but she has a poor sense of direction. You could give her a map, a compass, and a GPS unit with NAV points programmed in and she would still go the wrong way. She thinks and acts like she knows, but she hasn't a clue. Fortunately this time I was doing the thinking and we didn't end up lost in some suburban hell like the last time she was "navigating". The last time the three of us ended up going thirty miles out of the way to get back home because she thought she knew where she was. I know better now and pay more attention to my compass and keen sense of direction (and photographic memory...if I drive it once it will always be in my head). I have a lot of Indiana PAs area roads memorized. I can get from Indiana to Greensburg without using major highways, and from Greensburg to Latrobe using a highway for about three miles...the rest is back roads that a friend showed me. I can navigate most of North Mississippi above Batesville without using major highways...I often thought that if ever in a car chase I could simply loose the cops because I was so familiar with all of the service, dirt, minor, and dinky roads in MS. I had it to the point where I could blast down them at speeds that would seem suicidal if you didn't know the roads and where you were going. I have tried for this area and I am getting better at it...but west of Pittsburgh is a mystery to me until Robinson Town Center... So I am going to bed and I am going to sleep as much as possible. Goodnight...I am working on more stuff to rant about...I am sure I will come up with something soon.

 I wanted to say something else about religious zealots and right wing nutters like Rush Limbaugh, Pat Robertson, and Jerry Falwell. They are all pretty strictly anti-homosexual and are pretty homophobic on top of it all. Now I ask Rush and I doubt he would answer, if he were stacked in a naked man pyramid and had pictures taken and then distributed do you think he would be embarrased? Well it may happen...and I hope it does. I hope they convict his fat ass and he ends up a prison bitch because he already is a little bitch...well a big fat little bitch. The problem with the left is that it does have way to many pansies in it. For years it has been weak in down to earth, salt of the earth language speaking people. Well not only am I intelligent but I can say fuck with the best of them and wrap sentences and misinformation that they spew around and hang them with it all. In other words I filled with such rage towards these cowards who pick on little people that I would have no compunction about getting in their faces and confronting them with the facts and numbers (if someone would compile them for me) and tell them that they are fucking liars. Call them out. Not in a funny Al Franken way (which is amusing but to deal with pigs you have to get dirty and root around with them). I would not take the "moral and intellectual" high ground. Instead I would spew the same venom back at them only with the truth from the numbers...and I wouldn't stop at the right wing pieces of shit either. I would call out the left wing pussies who have for to long tried to appease and make nice with these vile humans that deserve prison treatment no better than what Saddam afforded to his prisoners. Fuck principles and moral decensy. These people have stolen the political landscape and molded it for their own gain and political raping. I love Amy Goodwin, I think that Al Franken is marvelous, but unfortunately these people cannot reach the masses. Not because they are to left wing or boring but because they speak a different language. It is the language of reasonable and intelligent people. They don't speak NASCAR dad speech. I understand them and frankly anyone who gave them an honest listen would be amazed that they can understand what these people are saying, but in the world of venom spewing vipers like Limbaugh and his ilk you have to do the same. Not to be like him, but to beat him at his own game. We can't make them play our game, and reasonably we shouldn't have to play their game, but face it people it is time we start and we get good at it. There is no reason why smart people can't beat these idiots at this. We can do it better. Once we have won then we change the tone. Then we shift the country left or at least more center. I advocate an all out attack on these people. If we can't play their game or we can't break into it then we break the game. All of these morons use technology they don't understand. Technology that peace loving people invented. Technology that smart people know how to manipulate. If we can't get into the game we shut it down. We take it off the air. If we can't play then there can be no game. We need to have a multi front war on these people and their ideas. We can beat them if we put our minds to it. We can beat them on their own turf, and if they won't let us play on their fields then we pave their fields over and take the game away. We invented it, we gave it to them, we can take it back. Call it the biggest Indian Give in the history of the US. (no offense to native americans...in my world you would have you land and nation inside ours if you so chose). So Peace...and if that doesn't work then all out war. They are rich and fat and out of shape...we are poor and hungry and lean...we know what it is to struggle and fight. One or two good black eyes and they will back down like the pansies they are! Well fuck me swingin' (thank you Russell Crow for that saying) where did that come from?

 I may have gotten myself kicked off of the CF mailing list today that I suscribe to because I simply cannot be an optimist and I must put before people the simple fact that under the current administration it doesn't matter what disease you have they want you to die. That is the simplest explanation that I can come up with. Harsh? Yes, but not as harsh as what they are doing to so many people. People with cancer, alzheimers, cf, and most of all the inherited and even other diseases are being denied the best research by the government because of a moral opposition to stem cell research and a fiscal allergy to spending money on actually helping people instead of killing people. Again this is all self serving because I need for billions of dollars of public funds to be spent on stem cell and genetic research. I need that money so that I can live longer (even though I don't have much that I really want to do outside of DANCE!...no write if I ever get my shit together and actually write down where I collect my info...I just hate documenting stuff, not research, but documenting because I love reading but not writing out all that crap). Well I made it through today and made out with a couple of cards, a balloon, pretzels, swedish fish, an ice cream cake (I don't eat cake but my sister loves cakes and ice cream...she got it for "me" but it was nice and it tasted good so I am thankful). My mom got me Carlin tickets for Saturday (I have already mentioned them) and my sister is going to get me Scary Movie 3 tomorrow (they were out of it today). So that was my B-Day...not bad and thankfully it was small and I didn't have to expend a lot of energy on excitement. Last year I had a big bash (along with my sisters b-day) and it was very taxing because I was sick, on meds, and just had my leash put on at that point (glad that is over!). I had to expend a lot of energy on being chipper and I didn't want for people to think I was ungreatful because I was...so I am glad that this year it was much less involved and only my family. Quarter plus two, two more than I thought, five years to the median, waiting for lungs, and average wait of two years. I have about 40% of my lungs left at a burn rate of 20% this last year...and it increases as time goes on. I am in for a rough time but I can handle it whatever it is. Not because I am that good...but because I just don't ever do anything like I am supposed too...so I will trudge on and blow the bell. Peace

 A quarter plus 2. 2 more than I thought.

 Well my doggie had his balls removed today finally. My sister took him down to the place where she did an externship in Cheswick and did the deed. He had one dropped and one in his abdomen. It was a hard surgery for Rufus because they have to cut him open and dig for the testicle. It is ok though he has pain meds. She also took Xrays of his hips to see how bad they are...and they are pretty bad. She figures about a year at most before something has to be done, but it could be as short as 6 months. So I will have him at most another year and that makes me sad cause I love my dog. We could replace the hips but it is a huge surgery and is a lot of pain for the dog and I cannot put him through it. I wouldn't want it I would rather be put down. It sounds ruthless but I see it as humane. I may cry I may not but I know I will have done the right thing because it will relieve his suffering. Well I am staying up with him because he is pretty gimpy and because of the invasiveness of this surgery (I couldn't imagine hip surgery) he is pretty gimpy and I just want to keep an eye on him cause he is my baby. Well off to get him his pain med for the night. Peace

 Well today I had a lung transplant support/informational meeting. It was really depressing for me to go to. First off I am glad I took my notebook because the computer the docs had there to use wouldn't recognize the USB flash drive the speaker had...it was an older Dell model with Windows 98 on it so it would't run without the proper drivers. So the laptop came in handy. The information I recieved was really a bummer. First out of the thousand or so patients that came in for evaluation for transplant only about 48% percent were accepted. I am through that phase. There are a bunch of other numbers as well but it boils down to that only 13% of the original thousand make it through transplant. CF patients have about a 48% transplant rate in all. If I had a different, less virilant lung disease I would have a much greater chance of making it through it all. It is just a little depressing. I know that I have as good a chance as anyone but the numbers are daunting and frightening. Well tonights discourse is about Social Security and the push by people on both sides of the isle, as well as many banker lobbiests', to privatize Social Security and its benefits. Now the rational is that the private market can make more money for the retirees in the stock market or even the most conservative of money market accounts. Yes it is true that if a person were to take the equal amount of money that Social Security witholds from the paycheck and put into a money market or riskier stock fund that person may make more money than what the returns would be on just the straight payment to the SS system. However there are two problems to that whole way of looking at it. First is that Social Security was never intended to be a retirees sole income but it has become a safety net for many many people. The deposits that many workers make into the system really have no value. Sure you can go look up potential benefits that you may get it really isn't there. You cannot reliably calculate annual percentage returns on Social Security because of how it works. If when you retire you have substantial savings or holdings of value your SS benefit will be less, the less you have the greater your benefit will be. It has very little to do with what you put into the system. However you are guaranteed to get out of the system more than what you put it. Who know the total "percentage return" you will see but it is nice to know that you will have something. The second big problem even larger than the first is that if you invest money you had better be prepared to loose it. Investing is almost as risky as gambling. In a casino if you have a large bank roll and play blackjack you have about an equal chance of walking out with at least as much money as you walk in with. Playing the stock market is like taking 100 bucks and hitting the poker tables. Sure you may win a lot of money, but more than likely you will loose money. The stock market is for the rich. If you have tons of money you can diversify and hedge your bets (investments) and you will always be ahead. If you are a small player then you will probably break even in the end, but the risk is great that you could loose it all. Look at the stock market bubble the burst in 01'. How many people lost everything. Tons...if it weren't for SS for some of those people who did all the right things (saved, invested, and are frugal in retirement) lost their savings and now rely on SS just to buy food. Now the bankers and investment firms would love to get a hold of the literally trillions of dollars worth of SS money. It would be trillions because they would have to transfer people who have been paying for years but aren't retired to these new accounts, plus all of the people currently paying in and new workers each year. For the government to privatize it all would cost the taxpayers trillions. Now for the real reason why they want to privatize the whole Social Security system. Or at least this is what I see. All of the ultra rich have vast holdings. Much of it in the stock markets. This money is tied up, if they were to start selling off these vast holdings it would drive the stock prices down, hence driving what they can get out of the stocks down, thus leaving them less wealthy then they were before. Laws of supply and demand work here. Their very own motto and creed kicks in free market economics. If there is a huge supply and little demand the prices are low, if there is a large demand and small supply the prices remain stable or rise. Over the past years the stock market hasn't performed as well as many would like so some legitimately want to get out and save their money, but imagine what would happen if say Bill Gates said that he was going to sell all of his Microsoft shares off. The price of Microsoft shares would drop, not because the company is unsound or bad, but because the market will be flooded with openly available shares of Microsoft (think about it now as a bidding war...20 million shares available we'll say, 18 million owned, 2 million floating around, and someone outside of the 2 million wants to sell 1 million shares...price drops slightly). Now what will all these people do with the money they would be able to take out of the stock market if public money (social security savings accounts as Shrub would say) became available. They would move to good ole' commodities. The rich are both smart and dumb. In the near future there will be famine and drought (we are seeing it now in its begining phase) and if you own commodities like wheat or corn not only does your wealth grow but you also own so much of this or that. With that you can go and get it physically to feed your family. You can eat wheat and corn, you can't eat stocks. Another problem is that these "savings accounts" won't be insured so if someone screws up and your money vanishes (as it tends to do on wall street) you have no recourse. Since there will no longer be Social Security as we know it you don't get anything. It is a play to get the poor mans money and give it to the rich man. If they get this infusion of cash many wealthy people will cash out of the stock market and many others will simply steal the money as we have seen at Enron or Tyco, and many others. The "experts" say that we need to do it now. The system is broken! It will crumble tomorrow. Well even they admit the system will be able to pay out until 2042 at current growth rates and that Social Security will remain solvent until then. With minor tweaks it will work until 207?. The main tweak is that people who make over 88 thousand a year pay more in SS tax. That is the big thing about SS right now a person who make 79,999 dollars a year pays the same as a person who make 4 million a year. So as you go lower on the pay scale the percentage of income paid to the system goes up, and the more you are paid the lower the percentage you pay into the system. Bill Gates pays that same amount of Social Security Tax as a person who make 88 thousand a year, yet he is paid far more money. The tweaks would extend the number upwards a little. What is unfair is that Bill Gates will be able to draw Social Security of some amount and will get something similar to my grandmother per month yet he hold vastly more in property and stocks than she does...but he will still get the same money. She has paid more of her wages in percentage over her lifetime than Bill has percentage wise. The Social Security system is really the poor helping the poor and the rich riding the poor for more cash as well. Social Security is run on the backs of the poor...but to privatize it would mean its demise and you will only be able to be able to afford Social Security because it will no longer be an entitlement. You will have to be able to afford to retire and afford to be part of the Social Security system if it changes. So when politico's come before you and say "the social security system is broken! it costs to much, we need to raise the retirement age, and if we don't privatize it the system will fail". Just reply "BULLSHIT!" The Social Security Administration is the most efficient according to Jim Hightower with only 1 percent overhead. There is no investment house or bank that has lower overhead. So don't kill a system that works already...and will continue to work for some time. Think...plan...act. Fight the power, buck the trend, be smart and confuse the leaders, use their words and studies to make them look like the fools they are. Peace

 I want to appologize to some people out there for not having kept in touch lately. It is not that I am being totaly anti-social it is because I just don't feel much like talking lately mainly because I am constantly bothered by a group of head people over this pending transplant. By the time I get done with dealing with them all I am all talked out and just ready to collapse. That is also another point. I don't feel much like talking because I am worn out and I get short of breath when I talk to long (like more than 5 minutes...yes it is getting that bad). Unless I get fired up about something and then I can talk for a long time and after I finish I pass out for a few hours. I sleep constantly and I am still pretty tired all the time. People tell me to sleep less and I will have more energy. Well I tried that for a week (slept 8 hours a night) and by the end of the week I was sicker than when I started the week and I ended up having to catch up on more sleep...causing the vicious cycle to go round again. I am not ignoring people...I am just not talking to anyone. Not because I am don't want too but because in many cases I can't. Later this morning I have a "support group" for lung transplant people. I don't want to go but I need too so that I can meet more of the transplant team. So until later...peace. And by the way the best way to get me is not on AIM but email...I am on AIM only occasionally...rather around my computer when messages come in. Email I check five times a day religiously and that is the best way to get me. For some people I don't have your email addies so email me and I can get back at ya! Night all

 I changed my email to my gmail account...so I will get mail there. Peace

 This new interface is really K-Rad. Well I said that I had more to write about and really it is more of a rant about health care and the military. If you add for the past century in this nation alone you would probably come up with 100 trillion in todays dollars that have been spent on researching and aquiring weapons. We have literally figured out a thousand ways to Sunday to kill people. Now if you add up the money spent on health care in the public sector (remember all military research and spending is on public money ultimately...Boeing develops a new missile and sell it to the US all of the costs are passed on to the Gov.) anyway you add up all the public money spent on research and implementing these life saving ideas it would probably be less than a tenth of the money spent on the military. To me that is uterly insane. We spend all this money on killing each other and we are right in the middle of a health care crisis. We have superbugs being made each day through the use (and overuse) or antibiotics. Instead of investing in new meds for healing our pharmicuticals are spending tens or hundreds of millions on penis pills. Don't get me wrong I love my dick...but when it comes down to it would I rather have a better antibiotic or stiffy...I'll take the antibiotic. Sure money is being spent on good research but it is not enough. Public money has all but stopped to help develop drugs. All of the current life saving drugs were developed years ago on the public dime in Universities then turned over to private companies in the hopes that they would not only develop the current class of drugs but also future drugs at the same pace. Well the pace has fallen off. We have hundreds of new drugs a year however many of them are not life saving drugs more like life enhancing drugs. Meanwhile the military needs more armor, needs more bullets. I am for a strong defensive military, but what have is not a defensive military. It is an offensive army. It can't defend anything, it can only attack. We have seen it in Iraq. The military was great at the war part and invasion because they have the tools to do that, but in the peace and defense of Iraq it has failed uterly. Canada has a defensive military. Sure they can attack but the majority of their military is defensive in nature. Our military is never in the country to defend. It is always elsewhere. We need a strong defensive military but not this monster we have now. A B2 Stealth bomber is not a defensive piece of hardware, it is for attacking nations secretly. Nuclear weapons may have had some defensive position at one time in a MAD (mutually assured destruction) scenario but we can't use them now. If we were invaded by Mexico its not like we can drop a few on Brownsville TX to stem the invasion. They are for attacking another nation. They serve no defensive purpose whatsoever. If you look and take into account the size and configuration of our military it is very easy to come to the conclusion that it is only for attacking and empire building...not defense. Department of Defense my ass...the old title would be much more appropriate The War Department. That is what it is simple. A Department of Defense would never keep a military as large and aggressive as what we have, a War Department would. That brings me to my next point. We are failing at all the things people are saying we are doing. If we are bringing peace and democracy to other oppressed nations like Iraq as the Administration would have us believe then we are failing. If we are empire building as most of the rest of the world says we are doing then we are also failing because all of our "colonies" are in revolution already. They all want us out. Sure the Romans, British, French, Spannish, Germans all suffered from the same problems we now suffer in building our empire they at least had a few years of peace (more peace the further back you go in time...things happen faster now due to better communications). So anyway we look at it we are failing on all fronts. So instead of wasting lives and money we might as well pull back and evaluate what is going on. The world will not fall into some evil hands if we leave it alone. Many would argue we are the evil hands because of what we do, how we do it, and then how we empose it on others. We have failed and we might as well face it. Bring all of our troops from around the world home. De-activate 80% of the military and change its configuration to a defensive posture only. Concentrate on creating the technology to make our nation cleaner and better. Finally we need to spend money on figuring out and making people healthy. Healthy people are happy people. That is what the rich have still not figured out after all these years. If you keep the people happy and healthy then they work harder and do not revolt. When will they figure that out. Who knows? But if they don't Americans will revolt and bring the nation back to where it is supposed to be. Peace... I have another one in me for another day...as always thanks for reading and if you have any suggestions email me and let me know.

 Wow...blogger has changed how you enter a post. I likes! Well today I was surfin the channels and came across a Chomsky speech from somewhere. It was recent, I want to say in March or April. He said exactly what I have been saying for months now to my family and I may have mentioned...actually I know I have mentioned here. While the reason for invading Iraq seems as simple as getting our hands on Iraqi oil for our use it is a tad more complicated...and I firmly believe in what I am going to write here. The real reason I feel is because most of the middle eastern fossil fuel reserves actually go to Europe or rather the EU. There are three large players in the world right now and frankly they will probably be that way for some time. I am talking mostly economically but also militarily. You have of coarse the US and North America (USA, Canada, Mexico) and together we are a large economic block and with the USA in this block we also happen to be the strongest militarily at this point. The second power is most of Asia or the Asian nations. China, North/South Korea, Japan, and then Sub-Asia (Cambodia, Vietnam, Malaysia, and many others). The third region is the EU. Both the EU and the Asian nations combined are much larger than we are and combined they are militarily stronger than North America (or as Michael Moore would put it "The Big One"). Asia is pretty much self contained. They have vast resources at their fingertips and they keep tight control over it all. They have huge populations that can afford armies of tens of millions. They also have something else we often forget. They have technology that is on par with our own because most of our technology is built there. We invent it (not so true anymore) and they build it. If they ever decided to exersize their power we would be helpless unless we wanted to destroy the world with Nukes. Also China owns huge chunks of our national debt. When our government issue bonds it is like a loan from someone (an investor) to the nation, at the end of the term the nation then has to repay the loan plus interest (however many people roll their bonds into new ones). The largest buyer lately has been China. They are able to do this because of the huge trade balance deficit we run with them. With the billions in difference that we see now that money goes into buying US bonds. So essentially China could call the debt tomorrow and we would probably not be able to pay it. Asia again has vast resources there. So they could isolate themselves and be fine because most of their materials they need are already there. This leaves the EU, particularly France and Germany. They both have the largest economies in the EU. Brittian is third and not a full member of the EU (they still haven't gotten rid of their pound for the Euro). However the EU must import most of its energy resources and they come out of the mideast and have for some time. Whoever holds the mideast holds their economies and can crush them if they were inclined to do so. Sure we need oil, but we still get most of it from here or South America (hell we even import from Canada!). Only some of it comes from the mid-east. With our hands on the tap we can turn it off anytime we want. That is also why we are in most of the Caspian Sea nations to control the natural resources. Not so much to bring here but to keep others from reaching full economic and military power, or rather to become a threat to the US. Chomsky of course put it better...but I am not as learned as he is, but these ideas truly have been bouncing around in my head after I saw a map somewhere of where we are in the world militarily. It so happends where we are all happens to coincide with where oil or gas or coal deposits are. When I told my grandmother about Chomsky's speech she said "hey you have been going on and on about that for a long time". My reply was well at least I am not the only one who sees this trend or patern and if Chomsky sees it as well then I may not be to far off base as to the thinking I aspire to do. She also suggest that I write something about it all and submit it. I told her its not that I don't enjoy to read but I hate to research because I research by grabbing bits of info here and there and cataloging them in my head then stringing them together how a Capitalist would and then put a twist on it. The sad part is my predictions have been pretty close so far as to what is happening. I would write for real if I could ever remember to keep pen and pad handy so that I can get quotes or write down sources and notes. Again I am lazy about that. Within a day or so I will write what I think of our "defensive military" and health. I will also talk about our noble goals of Democracy and spreading the love...and how we have failed at every angle you can look at it (including emperialism). Well Peace...my sis will be here tomorrow and I have to clean a room for her to sleep in.

 My sisters new laptop is nearly done and almost ready for her. It is finishing updating now downstairs close to the access point. Goodnight...I'm spent and my kidneys hurt worse now. Alas doctors are in bed and I get to suffer for a few more days. If it doesn't straighten itself out in a few days (I have drank almost a full bottle of cranberry juice to flush them out of any toxins possibly built up) then I will get a hold of the docs...but not until after Carlin on the 11th. Tuesday baby!!!! Then Thursday I turn a quarter century plus two. Longer than I thought or planned for. I'm out!

 yeat another post...drunken speech is the best!

 I now have audio blogging as well...and I will say my voice sounds kind of girlie...I hate that. I always get on the phone "yes ma'am" and shit like that. I would pay attention to it from time to time because I talk to myself a lot and now that I can record it for posterity sakes I will be recording a lot I figure...so tune in from time to time. I tend to bounce "crazy" ideas off of my brain and see how it goes. It may interest you in how I think. I would like to thank Blogger.com for all these great services. I not only get a free blog, but also the audio blogging now, and also I got my 1 gig gmail account because of being a longer standing blogger person. Of you don't have a blog get one...really it is cathardic in many ways. Gmail may seem harmful because they scan email but really they do it robotically and no person reads it...and frankly I have nothing to hide so scan the email bitches! My life is an open book...and I am sure that the audio blog portion will come in handy when I spend time in the hospital because it will be easier to do... Remember! PEACE! So much tonight...damn!

 I have to figure out a few things....I have to figure out the links portion and get the counter back up and running. I will add about 14 hits to it considering I have been getting about 20 a day if I get it done later today I will be close on my hits. These new layouts don't have places for links but I will make one ;-)

 Changed the layout...now I have to re-add all the links. It gives me a change to update and get a fresh start on links. If you would like a link email me at michael.honse@gmail.com

 Oh...it is getting ready to storm again. I love a little thunder and lightning and rain...lets me sleep well.

 I just realized that I spelled wine as whine, as in "I want some whine" or "you are a whiney bitch", not "wow that bottle of wine was good". Damn this spelling thing!

 Well today has been a long ass day. I spent most of it seeing my sister off, visiting, and then just spending time out of the house. I got my license the other day so now I can go drinking which is a good thing. I went and got a couple bottles of whine and a bottle of Absolute Vodka...I have drank about half a bottle of red whine and half a bottle of white, now I will get a little vodka in me. Tomorrow hopefully will be easy. I am going to try and catch up with some friends. I am definitely going out to a bar tomorrow night. I figure what the hell...I need it. I need to get out and have a little fun. Might as well because who knows how long much longer good time I have left, might as well spend it having some fun. Heard something interesting today. It seems the Justice Scalia's son was a lawyer for Bush when he sued to stop the vote recount in Florida so he should have recused himself. Also Justice Thomas's wife was a consultant for the Bush campaign that was gathering information for staff positions and appointments for Bush and his administration while the whole recount thing was going on, he should have recused himself as well. With those two justices recused the count would have been 4-3 in favor of letting the recount go on and that would have given Gore the victory. It sickens me worse each day as I learn about new things that this administration has done and is looking to do. Each day I become a little more convinced that anyone willing to vote for Bush again has a serious mental disorder. Peace

 OH this is priceless! This only further proves that the Republicans are no friend to the working stiff. Republicans offshore even their fundraising operations! Those fuckers...can't even raise money for their evil plans using Americans. Damn.

 Well I made it through today with no fever until a bit ago. It is mild and not bad. I got my birth certificate and MS Department of Licensing and Public safety drivers record clearance so I was able to go get my PA drivers license...even with my wild hair! Something bit me on the nose the other day and the end of it is all scabbed up on one side and I was thinking "oh great I am gonna look like shit on my photo"...well the picture is a great one, one of the better photos I have ever had of myself anywhere. Usually license photos are horrible...but this one is good. I had my head slightly turned and you can't really see the huge chunk of nose missing. I am pleased with it, and now that I have a valid ID (I had a valid MS drivers license but I didn't physically have it...or have it for almost two years!) I went to the liqour store and got a couple of bottles of whine for tonights dinner with grandpa. I picked good bottles too! So now I can go drink without a hassle!!! w00t! Well I am going to watch Aqua Teen Hungerforce and then hit the sack.. peace

 So I was ok today then I get home and low and behold I now have a fever of 102...pretty damn high. So I am going to pass out and sleep for as long as I can. Maybe whatever this is will pass.

 Doctor appointment tomorrow at 2. Lost of stuff floating around in my head. I will get it all formed into something semi-coherant sooner or later. peace

 Nothing to report today outside of that a shell was exploded over in Iraq that seems to have some sort of Nerve Gas in it. The gas was old and fairly weak it would seem as none of our soldiers has been reported to be having serious effects from it. WMD's seem at the moment to have been found in Iraq, this must make Bush pleased. I feel however that in a good analysis of the toxin they will find that it is old and was likely to have been produced pre-1990 as the potency was very low. I was hoping that no WMDs would be found but now that one has been discovered I hope that no more are detonated for the sake of our troops and for the sake of the civilians because if a truely potent WMD was detonated then there could be many casualties. That is the last thing our troops need to deal with on top of explosives. It will now be infinitely harder for our troops and much more hazardess because of this discovery. It will raise the "terror" factor with our troops because now they have to be worried about being gassed. As I have stated previously on this blog and in real life I still feel that any weapons that may be uncovered will most likely be old weapons with little potency. I do not believe that they had active and productive programs. If they did then someone was selling it to them, and that someone will definitely lead back to us when it washes out. If we find many weapons and evidence that a full fledged program was in effect that was producing weapons then I will eat crow and admit that they had it. However I want to make sure that we are safe and that the zeal to find weapons and programs will not overshadow reality. Regardless of the outcome on WMDs the war was still not justified as there are no apparent ties to terrorism or orginizations that have targeted us. Again if we can prove it beyond a reasonable doubt then I will eat crow. I will however diffuse one possible piece of "proof" in the training camp that was known to be in Northern Iraq. We knew it was there for a long time and because of where it was located it fell under our protection in the no fly zones so Saddam could not have actually destroyed the camp...even if he had marched some military up there we would have bombed it. Also the fact remains that the military had requested several times to destroy it and three seperate times to kill Al-Zarqowi yet the approval was never given by the Bush Administration (which leads me to believe even more so than ever that he is a CIA asset or that they need a boogy man in Iraq). Goodnight...and I send my thoughts out to our troops. I hope that we bring you home soon because you don't deserve to be over there fighting for economic and corporate interests that have little to do with national security. There are people here fighting to bring you home safely and soon. Peace

 Ok todays update will be short and sweet. I hope. My sis, mum, and I went to see Troy. Go see it. Not a bad epic. Pitt was very good in it and Peter O'toole was excellent and may see a nod for it. Pitt may also see a nod but it will be on the back of one scene between him and O'toole. It is a big movie and a long one, and a much better movie then Van Helsing (although I love Kate Bekinsale...I might bear a child for her...hehehe). I caught my Insult-A-Day calender up today and read it for the days I missed which included my birthday and it is like a prophecy for me. It makes me even more determined to become one of those people who speak out and spread the truth as best I can. Here was the insult. "A toothache of a man." - Radio Host (and former Secretary of Agriculture in Texas? I think) Jim Hightower on George H.W. Bush My calling may have come to me from an insult a day calender. Either it is destiny or pathetic. Either way I'm goin' big or goin' home. Night all.

 Well I went to see Carlin and damn was it good. I took the PDA but it just wasn't having anything close to recording all of the set. I just want to say that is really was worth all the walking up and down steps that I had to do. He had great new material and starts the show out with a bang. I am pretty tired from it all and I am still processing much of it...but this tour has less political satire than I was expecting. Seeing that there is so much cannon fodder right now I would think that he would have a lot of political stuff going on. This isn't the case but he does put Bush down twice and the second time it is "he lays his big fat empty head on his little pillow". There is a story behind it but it really is pretty funny. Just got this in...take it with a grain of salt as with everything on the interweb...but the AP picked up the story it seems. Rummy may have authorized the torture after all with the presidents knowledge. Well that hit me up pretty good. It is sad when we as Americans think and act like we have the moral high ground yet we are the ones killing and torturing on a scale that far exceeds what the so called "animals" in Iraq are and have done to us. Falujah...I am sure we killed not only a few true targets that were shooting at our men, but we killed hundreds if not thousands of women and children. The argument that has been made is that they had the chance to turn in the insurgents or leave the city. Well first many weren't allowed to go because their husbands couldn't leave...and last time I checked it is still a male dominated society over there so women can't really travel without men. Ok so back to the horror of it all. Second did many of our founding people turn in Washington, Jefferson, Franklin and others? Nope...why? Because they were revolutionaries. They were the insurgents of their day. No matter what we do or how we do it we will be kicked out of Iraq. No nation or empire on the face of the planet has been able to hold the middle east. Every nation or empire that tried was driven out by the local peoples, including the local Jewish people. (A dirty little secret is that before Israel was a state the Jews and Arabs that inhabited Palestine lived in relative peace outside of the occasional squable over goats drinking from the wrong part of the stream or eating in the wrong field. Only after Israel became a state and started expelling the local Arabs or Palestinians is when all hell started to break loose. The other Arab nations didn't help matters much because they propugated the myth that Jewish settlers would wholesale slaughter palestinians and that they should run or kill every jew they saw. Well that led to more violence. Also since the time of Muhammed the keys to the church or temple or mosque in Jerusilem, a religious site for all middle eastern religions including Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, the keys were entrusted to a Muslim family that there sole purpose was to make sure that the site remained open to all faiths and that the site was clean and protected. Muhammed foresight actually protected the site from the invading armies of Europe during the crusades because they were burning villages that wouldn't convert to catholisism. So they burned jew and muslim alike. Both groups fought side by side albeit contentiously but fought the European crusaders. The family to my knowledge still has the keys and still is in charge...it may have changed after Israel took Gaza and the West Bank which includes Jerusilem. But it was the Muslims who protected and kept up the most sacred sights for Jews and Christians alike because Islam was and still has hope of being a religion of peace.) Again we cannot win in Iraq. We have already lost. The thing that we must do now is find a way to retreat and let the most stable power come to power without looking like we placed him in power. Sistani may be the answer...let him "beat" the United States and feel his oats. That is fine. As long as he promises not to wholesale slaughter other factions and have some sort of representative government as part of our "surrender" or "cease fire" treaty. The only thing we can do is pull out strategically and hope that the region settles into some sort of stable peace. So we must pull out...otherwise we risk the attitude that started breeding (and it is starting even earlier this time) like that of Vietnam were we supposedly can't loose or the region will fall apart and become this huge communist domino and more nations will fall after that. Well it fell yes...but not to many fell after it. Now the region is seeing modest but steady economic gains and the people aren't attempting to export anything but local goods. For the the communist system has helped move them out of tribal and clan like systems that even the French were unable to do. It may have been through ruthless re-education but that doesn't concern us and doesn't affect me at all. So why should we have been concerned. Iraq is a strategic asset, but only if we can completely control it and we can't. If we continue and fight harder and harsher then it will galvenize the Arab nations against us. They hate us now, but soon they will despise us and when that happens you will see people from Saudi Arabia, Syria, Jordan, Iran, and Iraq come together and fight us as they have always done with past invaders. It won't be radicals that will be fighting us...as the powers that be will say. It will be average people who just want us out. It is already happening in Iraq and soon it will spread. That is what the politicos should be worried that the domino effect will be cause by our continued presence instead of our leaving the region both militarily but also economically. When we leave the region will have some upheaval as power bases shift but it will settle out quickly. If we don't leave soon we will end up fighting every Arab nation and incurring tens of thousands of deaths on our side militarily and increase the risk for civilian deaths here at home in terrorism, not to mention the millions that we will kill in retribution. We can save a lot of money and a lot of blood if we admit failure and pull out now. Pulling out is a great American tradition, only this time it is sure to work because we will remove the substance that is giving the enemy all of its gas to fuel the fires of hatred. Peace

 Played again tonight...although so far a lot less eventfull. I was mistaken in my thoughts the other night that I had banged most of the good looking women here in PA. I found a few tonight that matched well. I have this problem...it is called "no game". I am a severely stricken person. When even the worst are spittin' there best I am still only at "shutes and ladders" (mispelled on purpose that time). I really have no game. I would imagine that it would be like a young Noam Chomsky (my hero) trying to pick up women. It just ain't happenin' outside of a classroom setting with me being the teacher (and then it might be a felony). It takes a few sittings for me to warm up to people. I have just this impulse of that I hate people but I am amused by them and therefor need to be around them (plus when you drink alone you are an alcoholic...as I sip a glass of fine wine...really I am!). I need a good looking woman with some brains to keep me even remotely interested. For me at this point it is hard to find (and chances are I won't find her in a bar). I want a relationship but I don't. I can't, from my altruistic and rational side, see putting anyone through all the shit that will happen over the next months or years. On the other hand I would love to have someone to lean on from time to time when I am feeling blue (and of course the sex!). I am watching Fight Club and Cloe is saying she wants to get laid for the last time...that is how I feel right about now. I dunno what I want but I know I will probably not find it. I want closeness without the pain that goes with it. I want to be close to a woman for all the carnal reasons without the pain that will come with my passing. I know that I am going to die, sooner rather than later, but I still want someone there, yet I cannot bring myself to put anyone through that. I am on this CF mailing list and many of them are in relationships and I cannot understand why for the life of me. I cannot understand why someone would want to put another completely unrelated person through the pain of this disgusting disease. I need a "Marla" in my life...someone who doesn't give a fuck, a person who has realized the futility of it all, and yet has enough panache to live life (I used panache)...I know that person is out there...but I don't know if I will find her in time. Peace

 I wanted to say oops...I didn't update last night...there is a reason, Goldschlager, beer, and loud music all played a role in causing me to pass the fuck out and at points see parts of my stomach and bowel expelled into a trash can (thank god for plastics!). I will be paying for a bit but that is ok...I needed it. I will update with something a little more interesting later today...after I get some sleep, clean my car (it is truly filthy!!!), and get some more alcohol in me because it is Memorial Day Weekend baby!!! My deepest and greatest admiration and respect goes out to all of the men and women who have served this nation with honor and respect, and to all those who have died in the name of freedom on whatever battlefield. I salute you and I hope for a swift return home for the troops that are now deployed. Peace

 I feel rough. I feel rough. I feel rough. I feel like I have but limited time before I need a tune up. That sucks. Peace

 So I was going to wait and let things settle in my head and then put them to words but I couldn't wait any longer. Tonight my mother and I were talking over dinner and she said that I was rude in my defence of Arabs and intimated that I was mislead in my sympathies to their ways and way of life. She said that I was the same as Nick Berg who went there obstensively to bring new thought and that it would be my undoing as it was his. I am not a Nick Berg. Actaully I feel that Arabs are barbarians much of the time and their capacity for barbaric actions is almost limitless. Many of their actions shock me and disgust me in many ways, but at the same time the actions that westerners and especially we Americans have done are just as shocking if not more so. Let me explain. We go places to bring peace and unity and a new way of life under the banner of democracy. The problem is we rarely practice it here as it was meant to be practiced by our founders. Had they been able to foresee what we would do in the name of our way of life they would have most likely been opposed to it and probably would have written into our constitution and civil liberty documents specific measures to keep us from doing what is blatently obvious today. We went to Iraq under the pretence that Iraqi WMD's were an iminant threat to the US as well as suposed ties between Saddam and true terrorists that target us. A WMD has been found and there are sure to be others as well, however it is likely that these weapons are old and not as big a threat as they once were (being less potent), and they were never a threat to the United States because of sheer distance. Saddam held malice towards us as most Arab states do but not because they just hate us for hates sake, they hate us because of actions we have taken or actions we have sponsored in the region. The fact is that we have been medling in middle eastern politics for over fifty years with little success. We put into place horrible regimes that killed many people and we looked the other way as long as those regimes remained friendly to us, as soon as they turned on us all of a sudden they were a problem, but not before. Iraq, Iran both prime examples of shit we did to piss off the local populations. The big difference between them and us is that they accept death and welcome it in many ways because the afterlife is sure to be better than the current one. Suicide is a time honored tradition for them (or so it would seem) and what they fight for is perfectly legitimate, their methods are not though. I rail against the notion or idea that they just hate us and hate our way of life. Sure they see us as decadent, but so do our own fundamentalists here in this nation. Islam is no different from Christianity or Judaism in that all three religions require conversion or death, but also all three religions have a loving god figure. While many would love for this to be about religion (and for many on all sides it is) this is simply a war of failed policy on all sides. The scary part is that we intiated the failed policies and we are still doing them today in other countries. The more we fail the harder it becomes on us. We cannot underestimate how bad things are going to get, not from just Arabs, but also South Americans and much of the rest of the world. All of the worlds anger seems to be aimed at the United States. Not so much the people but the government that has done so many misdeeds in our name. Every tax dollar that is used to buy weapons, support dictators, and send death overseas will be revisited on us in ways that will literally tear us apart. To get out of this mess we have gotten ourselves into over the last century will not be easy, and we would be niave to think that even if we changed tomorrow that terrist acts would stop here. Instead we will see more of them and they would taper off over time. We can fix it but it does not stop the orphans that were made by US bombs, it does not ease the grief stricken mothers and fathers of lands that have been devistated by our policies. The thing we can hope for and change is that we no longer create more of these people.

 Nothing to report today...I slept most of it away

 Well I did more damage to the body tonight. Went and sat in a smokey cellar and listened to deafeningly loud music while sipping some hooch. Oh was it good. I have enjoyed going out and having a bit of fun from time to time. Unfortunately this may have been the last night I can do it in a while unless whatever is brewing starts to behave again. Not much happened today but I have to give a big "ups" to the Pope. I am not a big fan of Catholisism but I do actually admire this pope because he has remained pretty steady throughout his time as pope. I have to give it to him for admonishing Bush and this war. When the pope is against you...damn. A good bit that is coming out of the Catholic church lately is that they seem to be cleaning house out in Boston and here in Pittsburgh they are seeking people who were molested so that they can remove priests and take the appropriate actions. While many (and a younger me) would call for excommunication I do not feel that would be appropriate simply because the church and the teachings bear out forgiveness in God's eye...but it does not mean that I approve or think it is right and that the church should do everything short of that including seeking legal reperations against these rogue priests. Again I do not think kindly of the "fondling" priests I feel that the church and people should forgive if they truly believe the teachings of Christ. Remember if you subscribe to the teachings these men will have to answer for what they have done. That is all for tonight.... Oh by the way there were a couple of females there that were smokin'. Damn I wish I had game. Peace

 Well tomorrow I will going to see my friend Danielle it is her birthday. I am very excited about this because I have been wondering how she is doing and it seems that she is doing well. Another CIA dude quit today...although this resignation has been planned. I think that Tennet's was planned for a while because they need a fall guy and he makes a good one. I feel kinda crappy because I have something big brewing in my lungs and I know it for sure. First all of the stuff coming out is green...and I mean green. The second is that I have hives a lot which means something is going out of balance somewhere. The third reason is because I am sleeping a lot lately. I mean a lot because again something is out of whack. Well my grandmothers student the ever beautiful Cara. She is back for the summer and let me tell you that if I were a little younger and in better shape that I would go chasing her through the weeds so fast. Peace.

 Interesting little piece of writing.

 My friend Danielle that had her transplant in January is having a birthday this weekend. Hmmm....yay! Well today on the political scene things keep on getting worse and falling apart. It is fun to watch. Peace

 I hate getting up late...because it puts me behind the mark so many times on news of the day. Blaaah!

 CIA Tenent resigns. I am happy that it has happened but this is an obvious falling on the sword. It doesn't get shrub out of the crossfire. The snake Chalabi said he was glad Tenent was gone and that Tenent was the source of the misleading information also that Tenent has it in for him. Well Chalabi...you sir are retarded. Many of us remember that you and your I.N.C. were the source for much of the faulty information and it doesn't change the fact that you are a thief. It looks like these dudes are sitting in a barrel of gasoline and ole Bush is lighting a match. hehehehehehe... Peace

 Interesting tale of Bush Sr's bad luck in a plane during WW2 crashing and letting his flyboys die . There is always another account...and we know the Bushs' lie a lot...so I will give the benefit of the doubt. Even CNN didn't pick this one up. Peace

 Ok I finally found Howard Stern's site. I looked a while back and couldn't find it. Now I have. Regardless of if you think he is a mysonganist pig you have to defend even his right to free speech. I will say however that I love to listen to him because he has no censor in his head...he is probably the most honest radio host on the air because he has no agenda outside of shock and he is able to say what many think. Unfortunately he is under attack from all fronts and really it is all for nothing. Plus he hates Bush (not bush)...I am glad that we have him and I readily support him. He may say obscene things from time to time but it is not the states job to keep things clean...it is up to the parents. Go Howard! Get this...he is a conservative on many fronts as I am. He is a constitutionalist as I see myself, yet has a progressive attitude towards many things. Remember he is pretty well off in the end...Bush's tax cuts help him yet he sees something wrong with it although he still says he likes the tax cut. Peace

 Well today the President was reported to be seeking outside council on the whole Valerie Plaime thing...the CIA agent that was exposed by someone in the administration. Bush could be called to testify and most likely he knows how did it. It was one of three people I am betting Cheney, Rove, or Bush himself. We will see how that one shakes out. I must say CBS is really hitting the stride now. They also reported yesterday on the Enron tapes and again today more was revealed. Hmmm what else. Oh yeah Bush denied having talk with Chalabi and said he didn't know him well although Chalabi sat behind his wife at this years State of The Union and was the handpicked leader at first for the CPA council. Like he thinks the rest of us are stupid. It is just all very silly how they are trying to get out of all the shit they did. If it turns out that Chalabi was working for the Iranians as well and one of the higher ups spilled the intelligence bean on knowing how to decode Iranian intelligence than that may be high treason. Treason is punishable by death...so if these people are so pro-death penalty then Rove may have to see the gas chamber or see the needle...because we must remember that Rove is the nucleus of this warm little moist chewy administration and everything that happens inside the White House Rove knows about and probably had a lot to do with moving pieces around the board. I hope that we nail these people and break the neo-con back for good...or at least for now. Peace

 Well things are falling apart in the Administration even faster now. While many have know what is going on and saying over and over again to seemingly deaf ears we may this time have caught them with their pants down. We have to remember that these people aren't smatter than many of the people they rule. These are business people and business people are not intellectuals by trade. Engineers, scientists, historians, language professors are, but not business people. Business people essentially are the ruling class they don't know how things work but they are supposed to know how to manage and sell things. This administration has been pretty good at selling to people here in America as many fell for the lies. Again though they are not bright people, but are smart enough to attempt to control the flow of information (which this administration has done well admitedly), sooner or later those in the lower tiers of power get their toes stepped on and that is when we have leaks and new information come out. That is what has happened here with this administration over and over again. The administration has consistently tried to marginalize even Republican darlings like O'Neile. He is not a good guy, he never claimed to be one, but he does realize that you can't just lie like they do and get away with it forever. Generals who have four stars have come out against many of the policies, not because they don't want or like war, but because the administration stepped on their toes. The administration attempted to manage the government without much knowledge of what it does or how it does it. When you try to manage without having enough knowledge of how to work a system you find bad managers at all levels that have been appointed, and the people they piss off won't stand by forever and watch their hard work go to waste regardless of what it is from great big bombs that go boom, to a frog specialist at the EPA who is fighting a company that wants to dump waste in an area that will kill all the frogs (I know of now direct case...it is just a point). Sure the administration brought in some smart people (very few mind you) but they didn't listen to them and when those people weren't listened to they left and now they are talking about what they advised. Remember these are people they picked so if you choose to believe in the administration then you have to believe their appointees. Instead of listening to these people they have instead chosen to block the flow of information in every way they can and when something does get out they attack it (all of the radical right) and say it is "sour grapes" or make it out like the person has a political agenda. Sure some do but most again were appointees that Bush and Cheney tapped for these jobs. The information being leaked out in general is done by good honest hard working Americans within the government because what they see as wrong they believe the people have at least the right to know. Many have given up careers and put themselves into the fire for this and instead of praising them many Americans simply choose to ignore them just on the administrations word. I have no doubt that much is politisized in these days, but it always has been from Kennedy to Bush 2. Another thing to remember is that these people who are in charge are the same group out of the Reagan administration who helped fun the Iran/Contra deals, killed tens of thousands or more in Central America by supporting dictators as bad or worse than Hussein, and indeed supported Hussein himself even know he was a menace. These men are liars of the worst kind because their lies get innocent people killed en-masse. Not only have we lost 800 troops of our own there is little doubt that about 10,000 Iraqi's have been also killed. These men lie to kill, kill to lie, and then hand the bill to the taxpayer and then say "we are doing great" all the while the Nation is falling apart because of budget shortfalls. I have resisted the idea to Impeach Bush because while we know he lied about many things the lies can be manipulated to a point where it was misinformation. If this latest bit about Enron and the tapes leads to the administration then I say it is time we start the impeachment process because of their deeds and high crimes. Treason it is not but it is certainly worse than Whitewater or even Watergate. Peace

 Today CBS reported on some Enron tapes that show that there was market manipulation in California. Linky link... These tapes have been in the custody of the Department of Justice and were witheld from the public by both the Administration and the Department of Justice. I wonder who would such a thing. Maybe Bush, Cheney, Ashcroft and other oil men? Well it also is going to get Arnold in trouble as well because it was reported a while ago and I put here last year that Arnold had made a deal with Enron reps to settle the lawsuits that California had launched to recover about 6-10 billion dollars from Enron because of price gouging. Arnold agreed that once he took office the lawsuits would be settled and prosecution would stop for a settlement of just mere millions. In exchange he got great support from the energy lobby and recieved money as well. In 2000 Enron gave millions to Bush/Cheney/Republicans for the election all the while fleecing the California consumer. In return they got a President that witheld federal oversight into the market manipulations and also held the line and would not impose price caps of energy. In this climate Enron was able to do what it did. The roosters are coming home and it looks like they are shitting on Bush's desk this time. Ahh the sweet irony of being right :-) Peace

 Well I went to see my dad off and then to see "The Day After Tomorrow". I will say that it is indeed a pretty damn good movie. We will see however a trotting out of "scientists" that will say the science is hokey. Well taken as a whole it may seem a little hokey until you break it down like I did. First the shelf of ice that breaks off. There is currently a very large chunk of Antarctica that has broken off or is in the process of breaking off and will soon be the largest iceburg that has been recorded in modern times. It is huge. Once that much ice melts into the ocean it is sure to cause a slight cooling because it will drift and melt. Once it melts the ocean will cool maybe a degree or so and also change the salinity of the ocean. Again these changes will be slight in human terms. The ocean currents that I have spoken of before do indeed exist and we do have the knowledge of if you shift these currents you will cool the ocean and thus the planet also cooling the air temps. Here is the big if question. Scientists don't know how much ocean cooling or salinity shift will cause these currents to shift or stop all together. But we do know something will happen but not the extent. We know that changing paterns in the air flows and masses change our weather paterns. We know it because we can now see it pretty clearly. If the jetstream is changed drastically (or even slightly for all we know) we will see many problems. Tornadoes in Hollywood, blizzards in New Delhi. We just don't know. But we do know that the Gulfstream (ocean current) is linked with the Jetstream somehow. Also we know for fact that melting ice raises water levels and we have seen the ocean slightly rise (and it is rising at ever increasing rates) over the past years. Ok so now comes the hokey science. Or the part that can be passed of as hokey but hopefully I can convince a few people that it is probable. The Ice Age that starts in hours, days, or even a few months. We know it is possible. It has happened in the past. We have wooly mamouths that were frozen in place with food in their mouths and stomachs as if they were eating and then flash frozen. It is possible and it has already happened. It happened about ten thousand (10,000) years ago. A blink of a geological eye. This is where the movie kind of makes up some science...well sort of. The make the case that the shifting and eventual stopping of the Gulfstream effects the Jetstream while the water level is rising. As the Jetstream changes huge storms start to form similar to hurricanes only they form over the northern land masses toward the north pole. I think that the storms would be effected by the season in some way as to where they will form but that is my opinion. If the northern hemisphere is in fall winter and the southern is spring summer then the storms form north and vice versa. These huge storms reach the troposphere where the air is very very cold. Those storms happen now but they are small and the air that is sucked down as it is in a hurricane is warmed as it reaches the surface by water and air because it is over the water. Over land there is only air to warm it. A small storm would cause cooling of a few degrees. A large storm over land would suck down to much air at a time and allow it to not warm in the surrounding air. It would be a -150F blast of air to the ground. That would flash freeze almost anything and anyone. We know hurricanes do this and that is how they form and get strength along with warm water. Warm water, cold air and you get hurricanes. Well over land we don't know for sure and that is where the movie really speculates. However seeing that it has happened before it is plausible that it will happen again and we will be the cause of it. It was cause before by a buildup of greenhouse gasses that took tens of thousands of years to do naturally through volcanoes and other things. This time we have volcanoes and the rampant burning of fossil fuels that only adds to the problem. Now we can dismiss it all as hokey science but it will only be hokey till it happens. I believe it will happen. As was made evident over and over again in the movie there is no timetable we can follow because we didn't really record it the last time it happened. This time we will. You can slowly warm a frog in a bucket of water until he boils without him jumping out. When you toss a frog into boiling water he will try to jump out. I believe the water is already boiling but because we are all so used to these slight changes we will only see that the water is boiling around us when things actually freeze. Go watch the movie...it is impressive and entertaining all at once...and the science if you dig into it a bit isn't far off at all. Peace.

 Finally I will be able to add some pics easily to my blog. Thanks Kates! Anyways I have some pics on my laptop and camera that I wan't to put up...also a couple on my phone. I have pics of my sis (who I am so proud of now that she is a practicing vetrinarian) and my family. Now I can post them easily. Only a few more things and my blog will be put together to my liking (mainly adding some links and a full profile of myself). Well I am going to get some sleep. I have to get up in a bit to call my dad and possibly meet with him before he flies home, plus I wanna go to a movie. Peace.

 So I ended up in the hospital at 4:30 yesterday (Sunday) morning because I had an ongoing allergic reaction to something. I woke up Sunday and my lip was very swollen due to some allergy. I had taken about 150 mg of benadryl throughout the day and it just continued on to hives then swelling in my neck and throat to the point I lost my voice for three hours or so. It turns out to be some freak thing that I have had happen in the past but in the past I was able to stave it off with benadryl, it was a little different this time because it didn't respond. They gave me 125 mg of solumedrol and IV zantac. It brought the itching down but the hives were still there. It is all pretty much done I am still a bit itchy but at least the hive are gone for now. Outside of that not much is going on. I am going to try and see "The Day After Tomorrow" later today (I almost said tomorrow). I am also going to look for a little film called "Saved" or something like that. It is a film about a Christian School that Falwell was just on CNN blasting even though he admitted he hadn't seen the movie. As much as I can remember about my times in Christian schools I always found they were filled with horrid children and teachers. We went because my parents had just moved to the area and heard the public school were bad. Well the christian schools were worse because they tended to collect those who had been thrown out of public schools and those who's parents were rich sent their spoiled children to school. You had the worst of both socio-economic classes...and that always ends bad if you are in the middle of it all. I wanna say a little about the evil that is Jerry Fallwell. He is an evil horrid man that if there is a "god" I would hope that "god" will send him straight to hell because of what he preaches. He plainly preaches hate. There is nothing christian about his views outside of him framing himself as a christian. He is a neo-nazi'ish bastard of the evangelical movement. He has capitalized on the fears of what I feel are mostly good people. I do not agree with most evangelicals because they teach what is essentially no different from what the Taliban or right wing of any religion teaches. Convert or die and go to hell. The difference basically for the evangelicals is that they are mostly here (with the exception of those in Africa and they do what I am about to describe) and don't have the opportunity at killing people who don't. In Africa, the Middle East, and many parts of second and third world nations religious radicals or extremists do go around beheading and raping villages. We constantly talk about how the radical religious extremists, and many times comentators don't even bother to differentiate them form normal muslims. We talk about how horrible they are and how truely disgusting the acts that the extremists do when they burn some people or behead a person. It is no different from what happens in many other nations with and equal ratio of christian to muslim atrocities. With extremists in both camps constantly going back and forth killing literally thousands of people. Extremists always go to the most extreme that a population will tolerate, that is what makes them extremists. If the extremists could get away with killing people here we would see a lot more often. We would see more Tim McVeys, we would see more serial killers. We would also see more religious extremists killing people off. It happens elsewhere, the only reason it doesn't happen here is because it is not acceptable. Many of us are just run of the mill people that do not acsribe to the extremists of any religion or political view and when we see those people we tend to wince and turn our heads. On that note I will say that we have seen a marked shift in politics and religion in this nation towards more radical conservatism (which actually means bigger government and more wars) and more fundamentalist religious views. In moving that direction we have seen a degredation of intelectualism. The religious right come out in droves to fight anyone who questions their ideals or puts to task any of their teachings on history whether ancient or recent. That has been largely seen as acceptable and many mainstream christians have fallen prey to those extremists because it is framed as attacks of christianity and their ideals. When all that is asked is whether or not the historical accounts are correct when they are posed by "christian leaders". Mainstream christians, jews, and muslims need to drive these fundamentalists out of their ranks because those are the people that drive wedges between the moderates and always (always as in throughout history) drives those same moderates to war. It is always the moderates who suffer at the hands of extremists because by the time the moderates are driven into war it is because the extremists have come to power. The extremists are therefor through position protected from being one of those who have to fight. You can see it here right now. Ask any of the right wing hawks of the republican wing (or hawks of the democratic party) if they would be willing to fight or send their children as front line troops. The universally known answer is no. Instead they send pretty much moderate americans to go fight for their extremist views. All I ask is that we move back towards education and to hold that educating and intellectualism isn't a bad thing. We see week in and week out what football or baseball and basketball teams do at tournaments and in games yet we hear only once a year about some great students who have nothing to do with sports. We have university sports programs that have many of their students attending on partial or full scholarships, yet an english department may have only one or two students who get scholarships if lucky. As long as we reward the lack of intellectualism we will continue to see the nation move to the right. The greatest period of enlightenment in this nation of recent times came during the 60's. Not that we had a lot of great things but we had artists, thinkers, scholars who came out of this period and thrived during it as well. We saw some of the greatest laws passed during this period and many programs that have been overall good for the republic. Yet many people look back on it and think "those damn hippies". Well out of those hippies we had many of the greatest artists and thinkers of recent history. It all came to us via a educational culture that had influence at the time. Many kids were forced into college because of Vietnam and out of that we ended up getting excellent engineers and technology that has changed the world. While it is true we have more college students as percentage now than then the difference is that at that point in time students were encouraged to be students and thinkers and were not looked down on for being such. Now you go to college and you are looked down on in class by others if you attempt to be good at what you are doing. When you do well you are then expected to help others cheat by those who are poor students by them sitting next to you and copying (I have had that happen many times...I get a 90 or better on a test and everyone around me would get the same score!). We just need to promote thinking again...unfortunately we need to see it from the top and right now the top is a C average student and someone who proclaims proudly that he doesn't read often. If you don't read you don't know...do they draw cartoons like they did for Reagan (they actually did do cartoons for him so he could learn about a weapon system as claimed by Dr. Helen Cladicut who was the only no-nuke advocate to meet with him and she summed him up as being of low IQ...she is a doc so I believe her...she is a pediatrician). We need educated people who are willing to stand up and be educated and then spread the idea that the fundamentalists are anti-intellectual and therefor should be dismissed as uneducated. Peace

 Ahh there we go after many attempts to sign in. Tonight was good. I drank a six pack and had some fun. I then went to Eat-N-Park for some food. Not much else to report. Peace

 I wanted to write something else and it took me until now to remember...how pleasant. My mom and I get into what I would call heated debates or talks over Bush, Reagan, the Republican neo-cons, and the radical right, not to mention religions. She has often expressed her dismay that I am so disallusioned and so negative against my country. In some sense I am negative against our nation...but not so much the people or the physical land, but our government. I do talk negatively against it and I talk negatively against many of my fellow Americans who are not educated as to what is going on, and I really dispise the people who don't know and don't care because those are likely the people helping to make matters worse for the rest of us. I have railed against many of the actions that we have undertaken especially since 1980. As I become more informed about things the more I am enraged that people allowed it to happen. That adults of this nation supported these actions either directly through voting for the leaders or through inaction by not caring at all. My basic ideal, what I think we get right in all the wrong things that happen are the few acts of blind kindness that do actually happen. The recent mudslides and floods in Haiti where our military flew fresh water and supplies to the people, when we sent tons and tons of aid to Iran after the devastating earthquake last year. Those are acts of blind kindness. I don't consider foreign aid as acts of kindness because it always has some sort of caveat attached. When we send that kind of aid it usually is required that the aid money be spent here to get the goods to ship over there. Why can't those government spend the aid inside their own nation or in a closer nation on goods that are produced locally. That kind of aid actually would drive economies in those aid nations and help them out of the situation and build allies without restrictions. The fact is that you can get wheat cheaper in other nations where it is needed than you can if you buy it from us. I see a real disconnect between the rhetoric and the actions of this nation over and over again despite the fact that most of the people here really do mean well. We spend 400 billion on our military to fight against imaginary foes. Our military is simply designed to go toe to toe with other militaries, not against nationless drifters. I often think what would happen if we dropped bread or supplies instead of bombs. We bomb places back into the stoneage then we bring aid and expect the locals to say "our hero!" when we come rolling in. In reality we usually bombed them out of their sustinance living and thus making them reliant on our aid. I look at all humans as whicked, horrible beings. I hate all of my fellow humans. The reason is because any human has the ability to become a Saddam or Uday, but they also have the capacity to become the Dhali Laama. The problem I have with our government is that we support the creation of the horrible people instead of supporting the development of the good people. The development of bad people is easy because we do it everyday, it is much more difficult to create or grow good people because it means that we have to set aside personal differences and motives. We have to set aside our drive to have more than others, instead it means that we have to work with people and be willing to share the pie with the other 5.7 billion people on this planet. So change the world. It really is that simple. We just need to give up our primitive drive to have more stuff than the rest of the world. It should be quality over quantity. Peace

 Well the hair is now purplish..I had a lot of blue left and only a little purple so I mixed the two and the resulting color looks a lot more purple than anything. I have to wait about 30 minutes then I can wash it out and see the results. This is probably my favorite thing to do...I love changing my hair color to many shades just for the hell of it all. I am going to try posting pics again and hopefully it will all work out...if it does I will post the purple hair and the toenail of power. Peace

 The service I use for posting pictures is acting up. Well rather the software that is used with it is having some problems. I really want to put up that huge toenail for all the world to see. "Behold the power of the toenail!" I am still working on my Reagan rant...millions dead, tripling the defecit, economic policies that still haunt us today, AIDs "they deserved it" epidemic, and the law that required troops to pay for meals when in the hospital because no one in that administration could add or do basic accounting (law was signed in 1981...yeah republicans love the service men and women...see deficits), and just so many other things. People have been saying a lot that Reagan will be judged as a good president by the future. I hope that the future likes facts better than our current society who instead loves believing that we are great. History would hopefully be well read enough to say that he was a horrible president who presided over many wrongs. History will judge alright, but only if we have a future to judge from. The biggest thing that offends me is that the right wants to put him on the ten dollar bill and they want to build a monument to him on the National Mall, and they want his face on Rushmore. If they get any of it through, especially the Ten spot I will not use them. I will use only fives and explain to people why I don't have tens. Because Reagan was horrible. We can find fault in almost all of our leaders throughout time, but Reagan is recent and he ultimately was the person responsible for the terrorism hoopla that we are living with now. The root, the seed, stems from his administration and the people who ran it, and the same men run the government now. So it looks like the people will be the ones screwed for years and years. Not only did those people get richer at the expense of the rest of the nation and the world, but they also managed to help create the radical muslim movement that haunts us today. What a crack bunch of fuckers. Peace

 I didn't get the pics of the huge nail up yet but I will. I wish I had something in me to write. I am going to work up a Reagan piece here soon. It won't be nice because he was a horrible leader with horrible ideas. He was a simple man with below average IQ according to Dr. Caldicot. So I am sure it will be easy together a hell of a piece on him. Peace

 I finally was able to dig out this nagging ingrown portion of a toenail. I am so happy! My foot feels sleak and sexy, much more aerodynamic and lighter. It has taken three months to get to it! Bwahahahahahaha! Behold the ingrown toenail! I will have pics up of it later :-) Peace

 I want to stress how much I love to hear Chomsky on topics. Everytime I hear him it is like music to my ears because of how knowledgeable he is on so much. I would like to ask that people forward me any and all links that they come across for speeches he has made. I would love video, but just audio would be ok as well. I will probably start another page that has just Noam Chomsky links. So help me out here folks. I am going to start getting it ready here soon because he really is great to listen to his musings on what is going on. If you can get a copy of the Video/Movie/Documentary of "Manufacturing Consent" I would say do it. If you can find it I would be willing to send out a few copies to people as long as they agree to send out copies of it as well. So if you are interested then let me know and I will send out a few. Peace Essentially I want to create a Chomsky media library. I have the disk space, the DVD burner, and plenty of DVD's and CD's so I can get stuff together. I think it would be great inspiration to those who want to learn about ourselves and what we can do to change things.

 Cities react to Patriot Act. I have been watching a series on Free Speech TV called "Water The Drop of Life". It is a good series and I would recommend it for some educational watching. I thought I had a Doctors appointment later today but I don't it isn't until the 16th. I hope I make it that long but the good news is that if I stay out the extra week I will definitely showing the signs of the infection I know I have so they won't argue over a hospital stay. It sounds nutter for me to stay out the extra week but it is really for the best because then I can get a new port and all and just get the drugs I need instead of dicking around with oral meds. Reagan has been dead since Saturday and the media blitz of his "excellent presidency" is really wearing. I will be glad when it is over. Peace Off to surf the news.

 I don't know what all to write because not much has happened. Well a few things happened. I am refinancing my car for a hell of a lot less per month. It will only cost me 150.90 a month for it now. I can actually pay it off in about a year and a half. Once I do that I am going to save for a bit then I will probably trade it in and get a newer vehicle that is either 1. more fun for the fuel economy or 2. much more fuel efficient. If I could find a true sports car for around 10-15 thousand (like a Vette 00-01 model) I would get it. Otherwise I will look into a smaller sportier car that is more efficient. I want something sporty and efficient if I can't get a Vette. Probably will get a small two door...unless I find a hell of a deal on a hybrid. Well I think that will be all. Peace PS Is anyone else tired of Reagan shit? I am.

 Ok so I tried to sleep a bit ago but instead hives came on stronger. I have taken enough benadryl to kill a moose so maybe now they will go down. Peace

 I don't know what all to write tonight I am pretty much at a loss. I went back and read through a few of my old posts and all I can see are the errors. Spelling and others. This whole Reagan thing is out of hand. He was loved and loathed. He was good and bad. He was alive and is now dead. I will not attack the man because he is dead but I will attack the policies and the ideas because they were wrong in many cases. So with that I will be heading to bed or something... Peace Oh yeah...I will dig up a few more pictures to put up and I will get with the audio blogging :-)

 urlLink My friend Danille at her party...she looks great. When I last saw her before her transplant she looked so run down now she looks a lot more perky. Now we just need to get a few other things worked out and she will be ready to rock!&nbsp; urlLink

 I wanted to drop a quick note before I head to bed. I went to Danielle's birthday/transplant party and she really looks great. She is having troubles and things aren't perfect by any means, mostly other things CF related that are getting to her, but it looks like the lungs are ok so far and that is the best anyone could hope for at all. I sat there and talked with her and Joel (Joe...J something), and we talked and talked and talked. It was nice to sit with people who are in the same sinking boat. Joe (l) is in the best shape right now out of the three of us, Danielle and I tie for second/third, she has new lungs that work but guts that aren't real well and my lungs are heading down the shitter and my guts still work ok...pain she certainly has far more than I do...so I have nothing to complaign about at all...although my pain is getting past the 6000mg of daily aspirin, tylonol level (yes I take that much). 2000mg two to three times a day depending on pain. It would be easier to take pain meds but really I haven't the energy to fight for them at this point. Plus I figure I will doped up soon enough. Well I will leave it at that...I am just glad that I had a great time...and I got to hang out with people my own age, and I met some really nice people (and a few odd ducks as well). Peace Oh yeah Ronald Reagan died today. While I mourn his passing as I do any person, and it is a day of sorrow for our nation. We all must remember that his proposals and his budgets (with help from congress) ran up huge deficits, was responsible for at least several million dead from military actions he supported around the world, presided over the spread of AIDs and said "they deserve it", and managed to run many cities into the slums through decreasing federal tax dollars (it all went to "Star Wars"...loved the film hated the policy). Again it is a day of sorrow, but also a day to not forget all of the man...the good and bad. Rest in Peace Gipper.

 Right now as I sit here contemplating my navel and watching "Duplex". So far it is pretty funny. I to Danielle the other evening and we just had a merry old chat. It was nice. I am getting more of my story written and so far it looks like comic gold. There is so much that I have to get out onto paper and maybe just maybe I will get them all down on paper or on the computer. It will be interesting and fun. Peace

 They changed out my big ole feeding tube for a button. It hurt like a mother fucker getting the tube out. The dude just grabbed a hold of and yanked it out, as a result now the incision is bleeding. This was the same fucktard that said my feeding tube wasn't infected or having any problems. It just fucking hurt...and if hurts still. I am going to try and get a nap. Peace

 Ok so I hate PICC lines. They hurt like a bitch going in and they are inconvenient as well as a pain in the ass because it limits mobility. I just hope we can get everything straightened out quickly with meds and all because I need benadryl and if I am going to be couped up I will need something for my damn hips (I take 3000mg of Tylonol three times a day for it). Well we will see. I just hate all this mess. Now the numbing is coming off the PICC line insertion point (right now it is only a half hour old) and it is hurting a lot! Peace

 You're a Speak & Spell!! You nerd, you. Just because you were disguised as a toy doesn't mean you weren't educational, you sneaky bastard. I am a speak and spell. What 80's toy are you?

 So lets put it this way. I get a stay at club med Shadyside. I lost 11% of lung function in one month. Wooohooo for me! I went out tonight (yes in spite of illness) and there was this one elephant there wearing a zebra pattern dress that was way to small. All I could think was "that dress ain't hiding you from anything or anybody"...things that make you go brrrr... I will update later today when I get settled in. Peace.

 Well as you can see below I finally got my picture service to work properly and you now have the TOENAIL OF POWER!!!! I also got all the kinks worked out of my SprintPCS connection and got some software to work for my phone finally. Later today I have a doctors appointment and as of right now I think there is a good infection in there. Last time I thought that I was wrong...but hey this time it feels a bit different and most definitely there is something growing like a little weed in there. I talked today with the counselor for the transplant center. She asked a bunch of questions and is sending out a packet for me to get started with. When she asked how I deal with stress I was seriously tempted to say "I run puppies over with a lawnmower" but thought better of it. No I would never do that. What kind of question is that? Really can someone tell me? There are two types of people, those who get stressed and those who don't. If you get stressed you fall into one of two catagories. You either cope and deal or you don't. First I rarely get stressed about things. I have found it is a waste of time and energy to stress about things that are ultimately out of my control so why worry. When I do get stressed I just tend to shrug most things off to fellow human stupidity. Fuck it...ya know. Just don't let shit get to you. You either have control or you don't and if you do then do the best you can and be happy with that. Look you can't be right all the time, you can't be perfect, and you sure as hell can't please everyone, so fuck it. Do your own thing to the best of your ability and enjoy it. Do what you love, love what you do. It is a simple philosophy. When things get really bad I go for a drive...because I have at least partial control over what is going on. Well that is it for the evening. Enjoy the toenail...I sure did. The little fucker was in my damn toe for months and months. Peace

 Google ads are funny. Because I have "toenail" in my posts it is trying to hawk fungus cream and toenail care products. Freakin' hilarious! Peace

 Went to see saved today. The best way that I can put it is if you are a good christian, in other words not a fundamentalist then you would get it, if you weren't then you would be offended. Culken was great in it. Not much else to report. We did have a hell of a storm that knocked power out to the theatre but it was soon restored. Peace

 Up late yet again. All of my parts hurt, my brain aches, and my mind is numb. Looks as if we are going to have a gully washer here so it will be nice. Maybe the bird shit will get washed off my car. I am writing again. I think I have box office gold on my hands...really grade A classic box office gold. It came to me when my mom and I were walking to the movie theatre from the chinese place we ate the other night. These young girls passed us by and it was like a pack of small dogs yipping at each other and they were no further than five foot in front of us when I said out loud "I really fear for our future"...it spun out from there. I will leave people with this tidbit...it will be one part that will be a takeoff of the WWJD bracelets, only it will be "What Would Jessica Do?"...as in Jessica Simpson. Really it will be box office gold. Peace

 Went to see Riddic...or however it spelled. Decent movie, story choppy, slow middle, awesome fight scenes, Diesel good action star, leaves room for sequels or prequels. However go see it at a matinee price, certainly not worth 8 or 9 bucks to see. Also watched for the first time "The Last Samurai"...definitely an excellent movie. See it if you haven't. Very well done, great performances, and show the beauty in other cultures. Visually stunning movie and an excellent story. Worth the rental for most, a must buy for some. Peace

 Bush left the country today for Ireland and then Turkey. Last night I saw an interview that he had with an Irish reporter for Irish TV. She was a tough questioner, probably giving Bush his first real questions that he had no script to answer. At one point Bush said that most of Europe was behind the US and the war in Iraq. She looked at him as if he had just run over kittens with a lawnmower. The truth is that overwhelmingly Europeans were against us and this war. Even in the nations that supported us like Spain, Italy, and England, the majority of the people in those nations were against the war. Although their "representative" governments failed in listening to their people and took their orders from Crawford TX. The interview offended me in that our President, elected, appointed, whatever you want to call him it doesn't change the fact that he was rude to this woman. I wish that someone would have just slapped him across the mouth because of his behavior. I mentioned that last night but I forgot to add in the crap with Cheney. He told Sen. Lehey to "go fuck yourself" on the senate floor. There are rules in the Senate and profanity is prohibited. What was kind of funny was a Republican backed morality bill that effectively quadrupled fines for indecent things played or said on the radio or tv. The same day Cheney is telling his opponents to fuck off. Now normally that wouldn't bother me all that much. Actually I wish our politicians cursed more and yelled more often at each other. It would certainly liven things up a bit. As I said normally it wouldn't get me upset but this did. A few months back Kerry was interviewed for Rolling Stone and said something to the effect of "I didn't think he'd fuck it up this badly" in reference to his vote to authorize Bush to declare war. When it was printed immediately the right wing whackos came out all over and the chief of staff for the White House called for Kerry to immediately apologize for using that kind of language yet when Cheney says it on the Senate Floor in public (and probably broadcast on C-Span which would qualify him for the new fines they enacted..I should look for it on C-Span and then submit a complaint to the FCC and have him fined...that would be a bite). Again I have no problem with foul language but if you are going to expect one side to live up to a certain standard then they should do just the same. If you criticize one side then do the same for the other side. What I have noticed is that republicans have become the party of "do what we say but not as we do". Just like almost all right wing religious nut preachers and christians. I don't have much hope for our nation for the next four or five years frankly. If we re-elect king moron then we will surely be dragged into more conflicts, loose almost all funding for domestic programs (education, healthcare, EPA) and see military spending increase greatly. Taxes will continue to drop on the ultra wealthy and corporations while the tax burden is shifted to the middle and low class. If we elect the corpse we will still be in trouble because he proposes tax cuts for companies (although some rollbacks on the taxes on the rich). He will probably drag us into more war and other nasty things. Whatever happens it will be doubtful that he would be re-elected because so many drastic things will have to happen while he is president that no one would vote again for him. 2008 and we see some glimmer of hope if our nation is still intact. We may see Dean run again..and if he does he should tell people exactly the truth. If they had nominated him in 04' he would have had things fixed up by now or at least on the road to recovery. I just hope that regardless over the next few years that our fellow humans have patience with us until the people can take back our country. Just give us time people...we will get things back on the right track sooner or later. Peace

 Tomorrow is Ed's wedding and I am going to escape on the down low for a few hours to attend it. I am looking forward to it...at the very least I will be able to have a couple of beers and say cheers to the couple. On the health front there is not to much to report outside of my PFT's are going the wrong way. When you come in and do all the treatment and have all the IV antibiotics you can possibly stand the whole idea to the torture is that your lung functions may improve. Not me...no sir. Instead I come in, get tortured (and like it mostly), and loose lung function percentages. I went from an FEV1 or 39% a month and a half ago to 28% roughly two weeks ago, and then just yesterday my FEV1 was down to 23%. Overall capacity dropped from high 50%'s to the low 40%'s yesterday. I hate that this is happening but there isn't much I can do about it but hold on for the ride and hope for a new pair of lungs. I saw an interview of Bush by an Irish reporter for his trip over there today. He is pretty much hated all over Europe equally. He was saying that the majority of Europeans were in agreement with his war in Iraq. I don't know where he got that idea but almost all of Europe was against it with the exception of the governments of England, Italy, and Spain. However even those nations who's governments support the war the people of those nations are overwhelmingly against the war. She was a good reporter because when Bush would tell a lie (which was pretty much as soon as he opened his mouth) she would try and tell him otherwise. When he said that most of Europe was with him she tried to point out that the majority of Europeans were against the war he would interrupt her and tell her she was wrong. It was absolutely baffling because he almost looked like he believed what he was saying. I mean I know he has admitted with pride (he was proud of this?!?) that he doesn't read. I never could understand what he doesn't read. Was it the newspaper, or books, or reports from the intelligentsia apparatus? What exactly does he not read? I have a feeling that he doesn't read anything except maybe his speeches. How do I know he reads his speeches, because he often mispronounces words and in most of the cases of him screwing up words I doubt he actually knows what they mean. I have no respect for this President. He is not worthy of any respect and if I were a soldier I would not salute him or any of his administration. In all likelihood I would be attempting to find a legal way for the military to remove him from office and allow elections sooner. I would also be looking for a way to root out the Neo-Cons because their ideas and visions are truly dangerous for not only the people of the US but also the rest of the people on this planet. I cannot respect any group that elevates people who are uneducated, illiterate twits to their top ranks so they can manipulate that person. I cannot respect any group of people who say one thing, mean another, and enact something totally different. The people wear christianity as a badge yet have very little knowledge of how or what a christian is supposed to live. Hell many christians don't even know how they are supposed to live, but they all know they must live in fear. The people on the right are in fear all the time. They are in fear about loosing their jobs, in fear of a god of vengeance that is taught every Sunday and Wednesday. These people are scared of people in the far flung corners of the planet not because there is a genuine threat but rather an irrational reaction because their leaders (the right wingers), and indeed the moderates leaders as well. The far radical right operates on and out of fear as well. The fear that they will be caught, they fear loss of power, they fear poverty, they fear people wising up. That is why the people on the right are often the most combative people around. They are constantly trying to defend against imaginary enemies while at the same time trying to bring more people into the ranks of the right. The right is afraid. Afraid of what I don't know, but they are afraid. It is not just fear here in the good ole USA, if you look around the world and pinpoint all of the radical or fundamentalist right groups or religions, they are all afraid. Afraid of something that is not real. The way they have been able to gain power is by brokering in that fear. As long as we allow ourselves to be afraid then the right will always run things and keep us in fear and at war with each other while they sit back, watch the show, and make money off of our deaths and our fears. Stop being afraid. There is nothing out there to be afraid of. Don't even be afraid of death, it is yet another stage of life. There is no need for fear anymore. Peace

 Did I mention that I look like shit. I am having a breakout on my face...I hate being 27 and still having problems with zits and stuff. It is part and parcel of the meds that I am on for CF. I wish that it would all clear up for good because I hate having these breakouts. Maybe I will get lucky and it will stop...but I doubt it. I just want it to clear up. I am self conscious about my weight (I want to weigh more than I do), my back because is is curved and I wish that when I sat up straight it would be straight to, I wish that my teeth were white...they are yellow and spotty because of the meds I am on...and I wish my skin would clear up. I have had only a few points in my life where it was clear...and again it is the meds that cause all the problems. Outside of those few things I am pretty confident of myself. I like the way I look and there is nothing I would drastically change, but the few things I wish were different would make me feel all that much better about myself if they were fixed. Peace

 I am so happy. Danielle stopped by today and brought me a cinnamon and sugar bagel and a cup of chai tea. She looks good but she feels like shit. Her blood tests were all out of whack and she stopped by today because she was on her way to an appointment to have her lungs looked at. I hope that it all goes well and that she starts to perk up more soon because what is the point of getting new parts if you can't go out, have fun, and enjoy them. Something that has been floating around on this CF gimp board that I subscribe to (actually a mailing list) and it has to do with how people perceive CF patients based on looks. To look at most CF patients we look pretty normal on the outside, we may be thin in many cases, but mostly you can't tell. Now I have a gimp pass so that I can park closer. It has helped me many a time when I haven't felt all that good and allowed me to get out and be self sufficient when going to the store. I don't have to rely on someone else to help me from my car. Here is the problem with it all. People look at me and often confront me about having the gimp tag and using it. It doesn't help that I drive a big white Oldsmobile Aurora (Oldsmobile's are usually old people cars...or had that reputation). People look at me and assume that I am relatively healthy just from looks but I am not. I don't know how to put it and sometimes it is really frustrating to deal with people that don't know. When I am confronted about it there are times that I just want to go off and make them feel through my words how shitty things are. Sometimes I wish that I had this power that I could look at them and muster all the pain that I have gone through and the shortness of breath then touch that person and have them experience it if only for a few seconds. After they crumble to the ground crying I could then ask them if they now have any questions. I hate being sick, I hate knowing myself so well, I hate wanting to be so involved yet sidelined because of my health. Not to much sooner and I will be able to move forward...I can hardly wait because there is a lot out there left for me to do. Peace

 I am sitting here watching "The Simple Life 2" and it is so damn funny. I mean those two are just boobs...well they have boobs but I mean they are boobs in the "fool" category. I think I am going to enjoy watching it this season. Don't have much else to talk about right at the moment. If something comes up I will write. Peace

 Early this morning I was watching CNN and on the Early Morning show, not American Morning, but the show before it the man on there derided Michael Moore and his movie and called it propaganda and said it was filled with lies. His cohost looked at him as if he had just farted and called him on it. I wish I could remember the whole exchange but it was just absolutely uncalled for. I cannot believe that an anchorman would say something like that on air. That show in the morning is not an opinion show it is a news show where they report the news. It is fine if he has his opinion and its good that he does but that particular show and that particular time were not the appropriate time to be voicing it, especially in saying that the film lies. Did he see it? If he hasn't then he is relying on either uninformed speculation or has only read the talking points of Hannity or Rush. From the previews that I have seen and the articles I have read this particular movie is not the typical Michael Moore movie like Roger & Me or Bowling for Columbine. Both movies contained fact but twisted and distorted pieces of video to make points that could not have been made without manipulating the situation. For this movie the articles by the people who have seen it basically say that even if it is much propaganda that it still raises good questions and asks things that haven't been asked by mainstream media at all. Again I am mad about how the anchorman handled it this morning and I am going to try and get his name and then send it off to the films crack team that have been put together to counter all the little right wingnut attacks. So we will see. It was wrong and not appropriate and the guy should apologize to the viewers and state that while he believes his ideas but he should have reserved them for an opinion show or other forum, not the news. Peace

 Things are finally getting all straightened out. My guts still hurt a bit but much less as time goes on. I was able to get the meds increased. I now can get oxycodone every four hours, and the oxycontin was increased to 20mg every 12 hours. Also the Benadryl has been increased to 50mg every fours hours. That takes care of most of the med problems. As for the hole in my stomach hopefully it will be healed up soon. I think they may scope me to see if it is healed, fortunately they knock you out for that... Talked with the Third World Assasin aka The doctor who fucked up and he tried to explain and weasel his way out of responsibility. I told him that he screwed up and when he didn't listen to me when I said it wasn't placed correctly that at that point the prudent thing that should have been done was get a CT to see if the tube was placed correctly. Since he didn't do that he neglected the complaint and let it go. From there on it was a series of failures from that point on that were not the fault of the staff. All of the errors stemmed from his poor decision and his lack of interest in making sure everything was ok. He continued to try and get out of it all and I finally just told him that it was unacceptable what he did and ultimately it was his responsibility. He then told me that he was going to check on me tomorrow (later today) and I said that I preffered not to see him and that I would rather see one of the other doctors from that practice. I then thanked him for taking the time to come down and dismissed him. If he had come down and made a point of appologizing on Saturday and being the guy who did the follow up care and attempted to fix the problem I probably would let this all slide. Instead he avoided me until today (Tuesday...I'm still on Tuesday) and only came after he got a call from patient advocate department to get records and paperwork from him. He rushed down after that to try and cover his ass...but it is to late. I am going to sue him...not for money so much. Of coarse I want something for the pain abd additional time down, not to mention because he nearly killed me. I do want for him to pay the difference of bills for me having to go down to the CCU (ICU) and pick up those extra costs and reimburse Medicare because it could have been avoided with a simple CT scan. I am not asking for much, but I do want it to stick in his mind that in the future he should listen to his patients. I know my body and when I say something is wrong I am usually right. Well things are coming along...I don't know how much longer at this point but I know it may be a bit more time. Until later... Peace

 So here is what happened. I came into the hospital because I dropped my FEV1 from 39% to 28% in about four weeks. It is time for a tune up and hopefully roll back a little of the damage, and if nothing else get the infection under control. Back in March I had a PEG tube placed and I thought while I am here I might as well have the cap thingy put in instead of having that huge ass tube that I could lasso my dog with. I should have known better when I saw the GI guy looking at the packaging and the directions on the Button package. It got me a little worried but I just thought this guy surely has done this and this may be just a tad different from ones he has done before. Well I still dont know if he had done others but from my experience I am pretty sure he had little experience. First he told me this is gonna hurt a little bit but it will be okhe then grabs hold of the G tube and yanks the damn thing out. Of coarse it hurt like a mofo and I was crying by then but I still had a bit to go. We had to get the button in yet. Still studying the packaging he decides to go ahead. He takes the button and pushes it into my stomach and then inflated the retaining balloon. Well immediately I could tell that something wasnt right at all. I told him that I didnt think it was in properly but he dismissed it and said it was fine. Well throughout the day on Friday I was having some pretty hellacious pain in my guts. I kept telling everyone but was pretty much ignored. Meanwhile I am trying to not have to take shitloads of narcotics because the last thing I want stamped on my chart is med seeker that is the death bell for people in true pain. You have to walk a tightrope getting enough to take the edge off but not so much that the docs just think you like getting high. Well Friday night rolls on and the pain was worse and worse. The kept giving me Dilauded and that was helping but in the end I didnt know how much I had. They started the tube feeding and within a few minutes I was screaming bloody murder. The came down and by that time I had unhooked myself from the feeding equipment. They soon came down to see what I was screaming about and I was still in pain and writhing around apparently. So the shot me up with more Dilauded. Now I was on schedule of 2mg every four hours which was keeping most of the pain at bay. However apparently I had way more than that over the course of just a few hours. All of the feeding fluid was going into my body cavity instead of my stomach. Next thing I know I am coming around in ICU. I found out later from one of my friends who is a nurse here on my floor that I had coded and they had to bring in the crash cart and all. The didnt need to shock me but my O2 sats were down to 23%...frankly I should have been dead. My friend the nurse came in that morning and noticed all the bustle around my room so she came to investigate. When she got in here I apparently waved at her and said something but for the life of me I dont remember. All of this was a cascade of bad events that ended up in me coding. The problem that I have is what if anything am I going to do about it. If the doctor had listened to me in the first place this chain of events would have never occurred. I dont know what I want to about it and I am looking for some advice. Pretty much I am forgiving dude and few things bother me with the exception of negligence, laziness, or just plain ignorance, as well as not knowing your job. The even worse part is my doctor has pulled the dilauded out of my schedule. Which really sucks. I could understand if I was a heroin junky that scored a bad bag, but this was not my fault in the least. The OD was cause by a cascade of eventsand now I get to pay for them both in pain and in the battle it will be to get the meds back on the list of things I need. Again I dont know what I should do because I was just getting to the point where I knew if I needed meds to control pain I could get them without sounding like a drug seeker. Now that is shot to hell because now I have a history of OD. So what do you folks suggestI want to cut the GI guys heart out with a spoonwhy a spoon? Because it will hurt more. Peace

 Where have I been that I haven't updated my blog in a day and a half. Well let me tell you. I have been in ICU...yup ICU, now let me explain how I got here as best as I can piece it together. It started when Dr. Aziz came to replace my PEG tube (feeding tube) with a Button (much smaller device that is less intrusive and easier to live with). Well when Aziz yanked out the tube it hurt like a bitch and I was starting to think that something went wrong. I should have known when he was looking at the directions on the box on how to insert the damn thing that he probably wasn't qualified to do it. Well he jammed the new one in there and I knew it wasn't in my stomach and I said something, plus it was really hurting like a bitch. I told him it didn't feel right and he dismissed it and said it was fine. Later that evening I was getting ready for bed and they came to hook me up for tube feeding. We probably got only a few CC's in but I don't really know for sure because I was pretty out of it all. I started screaming because it hurt really really bad. Now we get to the point where I have very little recollection of what happened. The must have given me more Dilauded because of the pain...or at least one of the residents did. I remember puking all over the place, then the next thing I know I am coming to in the ICU with a re-breather oxygen mask on. So basically I think I od'd without any direct action from me to make it happen. Go figure. Yesterday I went and had to get a CT scan to see where the tube was and they had to put some contrast in it, the gave me something down there for pain and it worked somewhat well because I didn't scream out in pain as I had earlier when my nurse was just trying to push a little air into it to see if she could hear it in my stomach (I about jumped off the bed when she did that). They got the contrast in and it turns out I was right. It was just dangling in my gut and anything that was put through it went into my body cavity and not the stomach like it was supposed to. Later another GI doc came up and removed it...it hurt but at least it was out. Now everything is hurting worse than before and it hurst to breath even because of the gut pain. I think there is something in there that shouldn't be. The kicker is though that Dr. Weinburg doesn't want me to have anymore IV pain meds because I od'd. Even though I had no control over it, and it wasn't like I scored some bad heroin, they OD'd me and now I have to pay the price in pain for it. He has me on Oxycodone and Oxycontin, the codone is for "breakout" pain, the contin is longer lasting. Problem is that neither is actually enough to numb the pain. I would need a lot more of it more frequently to get the same relief as a small dose of just about any IV pain med. Again let me stess I am in pain because someone fucked up and they won't give me pain meds that work because someone else fucked up. I had been fighting for a long time to get any kind of pain med and then just like that, something that I did not do, I get the relief taken away. They are going to do another CT scan to see if something else is damaged. I have this feeling that something else is broken down there. This kind of pain isn't just normal belly pain, this is "something is broke you dumb fuck" kinda pain. Even if they don't find anything it won't matter, they aren't going to get me on the right pain meds anyway. I had been trying to keep myself from looking like a pain med seeker so I have been very judicious about asking for meds even though I am in a lot of pain, now it is going to be even worse because now I have an OD on my charts. Again someone else fucks up and I pay. Fuckin a, fuckin a...

 Damnit...dropped that last post I wrote. Well I won't repeat it because I am to lazy to type it out again. The jist of it was that I am going to start getting together a lot of Health Care info and I am going to find out how much state health care bennefits have been cut and where they have been cut. In the past four days I have heard of three seperate states that are cutting their health care programs for chidlren and disabled adults. Ohio, Tennessee, and Texas are all cutting programs either completely or so deeply that they might as well cut the programs altogether. That is in addition to the Federal Government or rather the Bush Administration has removed all CHIPs funding in the 05 budget that is now being shoved through the congress. I am going to compile all the changes in the coverage and then I am going to figure out the costs of a national program, put together proposals for enactment, and shop them out to politicians. In the process I will also be looking at other nations and how they implement their national health care systems. I think with a close look at how other nations do it we can then build an awesome health care system that serves all who need it here in the states. It means that I will have to learn a lot and then I will have to help explain it all to people. It will be my job I imagine and then pimp it out to people. It is going to be interesting. Peace If you run across articles or online blurbs about public health care cuts in your area or state please send it on to me I would be very greatful for the help. michael.honse@gmail.com Send it all there.

 I have been pondering over the last day of what I am going to do and how am I going to do it. I have a pretty good idea of what I want to do with my time. I have a lot of research to do over the next month or so. I need to compile a database of health care for the world. I want to know how much each nation spends on health care per capita and then I need to compare systems. It is a lot to do and I know that it will take me some time to get it all together but once I get it together I will be able to approach the topic of healthcare for our nation from a more educated standpoint. I would appreciate any articles that people run across about health care cuts to state programs. Please email them to me at michael.honse@gmail.com that would help me out. I would love to see online articles, newspaper bits, anything that talks about cutting bennefits to the needy. I need to know all of this so that I can see how much damage is being done by all the cuts. I am not out of the hospital just yet. I am still fighting all of this crap in my lungs and a fight it is. Maybe I can get myself healthy and then make getting health care for us all my job. I have been needing to find my nitch and I know that it has always been there for me. I am going to be the best I can at that and I will also become a pundant. I will spare no mercy on those who do not agree. I will be the best. I will be the voice of all of us. I watch those people on TV and they talk about shit that really doesn't matter to the majority of the population. I think there is a better way to do it all. I will find it and I will make the system come to me somehow...I don't know why or how but I know that something is going to happen. Maybe it will be my calling. Peace

 I didn't get out yet. My PFT's are no higher or lower than when I came in so I get to stay a bit longer. Yesterday I was interviewed by a sociologist from a little college in Carlisle PA called Dickinson. It was my honor to talk to Dan and Maggie for their project. I am not sure what all they were looking for. I know they were wanting to know how people live with CF, not medically but outside of that. What our lives are like, how does it involve our personal relationships with other people, romantic relationships, etc... I enjoyed talking with them because as I have said before my life is pretty much an open book for those who want to read it. That is part of why I have this blog. I try to keep it as open as I possibly can so that when people read it they can see that I am a person that has much conflict of policy and idealism. There are many things that I believe in such as the death penalty. It appeals to my primal gotta-get-even center of my brain. I often find myself thinking about certain people or criminals that they are great candidates for the death penalty. However I know that the death penalty does not deter crime, it accomplishes nothing in the grand scheme of things so why bother. It also is a sign of how barbaric a society is. If you are still wanting or craving this basic act of revenge it only helps to show that maybe you aren't up to speed with social ideals. These are the conflicts I face. I love guns and I think that any person who is not a violent person should be aloud to own whatever they want. A howitzer, fine just don't blow anyone or anyone's property up. I think you should be able to own an arsenal but I do believe in some forms of gun control. I believe that it can be helpful but I also know that most criminals don't get their guns from legal dealers. They may go through a straw purchase (having a friend or relative get the weapon for someone who can't), they can purchase it from a private owner, or just steal a gun. So gun control ultimately only really tracks those who purchase weapons legally. Again though I don't think that it is a bad idea to have some sort of controls on weapons. That is what this blog is for, that is what my life is like. I love politics, I love conflict, I love learning and then teaching. I beg of the people that read my blog to give input because how am I to know what others think. That is why I have the comments section. Please send me input and let me know how I am doing. I am going to go ahead and announce here that this blog may suffer a slowdown of posts possibly over the next quarter or more time. Basically there have been a lot of bad things happening in health care and cuts to state budgets that are threatening to start taking away health care that is needed for many people including myself. What it comes down to is that I have to do something and become active somehow. The past couple of days I have read several news articles announcing cuts to heath and welfare programs in combination with me pirating (which I don't do often because I don't have a problem with ripping off big media, but I feel bad for taking money away from directors and actors) and downloading "Fahrenheit 9/11" by Michael Moore. I knew all of the things he stated in the movie, the sheer theft of tax payers money, the welfare for corporations that is always forthcoming, yet for example CHiPs (Child Health Insurance Program is what I think it stands for and covers children with no health care for both poor and many middle class kids that have severe illnesses or lack of basic care) is being completely cut out of the Bush Administrations budget proposal for 05'. That money would not be provided to the states which in turn find their CHIPS programs. The states will have to do one of two things. They could gut or eliminate the CHIPs program for their state or the state could cut funding from other health related programs to try and make up the shortfall from lack of Federal Dollars. It also places the state into the uncomfortable position to have to increase taxes or run large deficits. In the states where you have Republican control it is even worse. In those states they first cut programs relentlessly, they then cut taxes where they can, third they run deficit spending as high as possible. The reason is because they want to bankrupt the governments so they can privatized as much of the services as possible. It is a very dangerous thing they are doing. They essentially want to take as much money from the taxpayers as possible and transfer that money into private companies for services because they believe that private companies can do things more efficiently than the government can. They use the argument that government wastes a lot of money of projects for example the 400 dollar hammer or other outrageous prices for things we can pick up at Wal-Mart or your local hardware store for a few bucks. However they never tell you that it was a private contractor that charged them 400 bucks for a hammer, or where other gross overcharging occurs. Every instance can be traced back to a private contractor overcharging the government so what do you think will happen when private companies take over even more of the duties of the government. They want to stop social spending altogether so that money can flow into other areas where companies can justify taking more than they could than if the money is supposed to be going to the needy or ill. I have come to a place where I have to stand up and fight for what I know is right. I can not stand on the sidelines and watch these people destroy my nation, take away programs that many good people depend on. I can not allow that to happen. Over the next few months I will be gathering data and reports and try to put together a movement if you please to try and fight this. That is why posts here may drop from time to time. I am limited in what I can do because of my health, I am limited in my resources, but I do have a computer, access to the internet from anywhere, and a mind so I am going to fight. I will keep people updated on what is going on. Mind you what I plant to do. What I hope to do is put together a platform of sound health care plans and options that will be farmed to all politicians. Whomever decides that they like our position then we will support that politician or candidate. If they are in office and claim to be in support of our platform and do nothing to promote it then we will confront them. I want to be the pitt bull of medical care reform for a single payer public health care system. I want to be a pain in the politicians ass. So hopefully we can get this going. My only cry to people is that they have the same view as me on health care and I will not care what their political leanings they have as long as they will help me fight for real substantive change. Peace

 I did a bad thing and downloaded "Fahrenheit 9/11" by Michael Moore. The copy that I downloaded was unfortunately not a complete or finished copy. It was the worst movie I have ever seen. The movie stirred such deep emotions that all I could do was cry while I watched it. To watch a movie about things I have been reading about, to see the pieces put together in front of my eyes, to see it visualized and put together. This movie isn't the worst I have ever seen...the content is the worst subject to cover because it is true. My mother has told me over and over again that the way I talk is anti-American and she feels that I hate America. I love my country, I love the idea of my nation, I love many of my fellow countrymen and women, but I detest my government and all of the leaders within in. I detest the fact that many of my fellow Americans cannot look past the end of their nose and see that the real war, the real battle is not between us and some little shit nation on the other side of the world, it is not with some man in a cave, our war is with other human beings. We bomb these people back past the stone age most of the time. It is a war that is not even valid or remotely real in the sense of that these people are a threat to me or any of my fellow countrymen and women. The real war, the real battle is between the vast majority of people on the bottom end of the economic scale and those very few who hold power and riches. We are in a war and we the people are loosing. There is no difference between my family and an average Iraqi, Indian, Iranian, Israeli, French, British, or Mexican family. We all struggle for the same thing, our families strive for the same thing, we strive to have food on the table, happiness in our homes, and the hope that our families will be healthy. We are all the same in that respect, we all strive for basically the same thing. We all have a common enemy and it is the upper crust of our societies, the powerful in our societies. Not all rich people are bad, not all powerful people are rich, and not all powerful people are bad, but the vast majority are. People with money and or power will do anything to keep and gather more of it and the prime way to do it is to lead us against each other. Powerful people only remain powerful when they are allowed to pit us against each other and in the process it makes wealthy men who have absolutely no compassion for anything or anyone outside of themselves. I don't know how I can explain it any better but to say that all people are the same. If you want to go and avenge the beheading of Nick Berg or any of those poor people who have been brutally killed...if you feel that we should go and kill those barbarians and behead them then you are no better than those people, you are no better than the people that want to drive the masses against each other. You are a barbarian just like the rich and powerful. Crime of all sorts and kinds comes out of a need for control, power, and wealth or some combination of the three. A rapist is someone who wants control and to dominate someone else, a crook is someone who wants control and to gain wealth. All crime is based in those three basic things. All crime comes out of it corporate, personal, or national. Our nation is nothing but an international criminal in its search and war to gain control, power, and wealth. It is that simple. If we spent as much time and energy as well as resources that we do on trying to gain those things we could solve almost any problem from world hunger to split ends on your hair. There is no problem that cannot be solved that if we put our minds to it in an equal and equitable fashion then we could really start to heal ourselves and our planet. The movie was not a typical Moore film at all. He only pulled his schtick in small portions of the film. Fortunately Moore allowed facts to tell the story and only a couple of times did I find where people might find things confusing because of how he sequenced things. Otherwise he put together a horribly wonderful film. I am saddened that a film like this has the facts to support it. It is sad that the story is indeed true. I hope that more people see the film and it sparks them to go do there own research. We should never take one persons word on faith as the absolute truth because that is how we enable powerful people the ability to turn us against ourselves. The even sadder thing is that Bush may be defeated in November but in reality little will change. Kerry won't stop the war or calling for wars. He will be in power and it will corrupt him. We would be better off with Kerry but not by much. The simple fact is that our government no longer serves the interest of the people it only serves the interests of the rich and powerful. I think it is getting close to revolution time, for the people to rise and speak as one around the globe that we are no longer going to kill each other for the powerful and wealthy people's amusement or benefit. If Bush has a grudge against Hussein let them fight it out man to man. That movie has made me mad and made me want to change things...I cannot stand by and let these things happen. To see the brutality of our weapons ripping apart children and women, people burned by napalm, for what? For what? Because someone needs more money or power. This war does not benefit me or the average soldier. No more personal freedom will be seen by the average Iraqi person all they continue to see is oppression and fear that they had under Saddam...and to say that at least we aren't killing them by the thousands and we aren't torturing them then I beg to differ. We drop bombs on them daily and whether we like it or not those bombs kill more innocent people than "terrorists", and we have seen the pictures of torture. We haven't seen all of those pics so I can't and most of you can't say "at least we didn't cut of limbs or fingers" because we don't and probably won't know all the facts and details of the torture that is worse than we saw in those pictures. All of mankind is created equal in that we all have the capacity to be Hitlers, Hussein, Stalin, Napoleon, Bush, Reagan, or any other number of equally despicable dictators, rulers, or criminals. It is every one of us. We also have the ability to be Mother Teresa, Gandhi, or other humanitarians. The goal should be for all of us to try and foster the growth of good people. First we must wake up to the cold plain truth of it all. Second we need to acknowledge those problems. Third we need inspire and lift up good deeds to the level of attention and adulation that we give sports stars and business people. Fourth we need to forgive those people that have kept us at war for their benefit and profit. Fifth we must make sure that we do not allow ourselves be ruled by fear and the same forces that control us now. We must resist that urge to follow blindly and resist following on sheer faith alone. Doing it that way has allowed humans to continue to be bad people. Go see the movie and I am pretty sure you many of you will cry as I did. Peace

 This is a continuation of the incident I had during my first couple of days in the hospital. I had all those problems on the 19th where Dr. Aziz had removed my PEG tube so that he could put in a button instead. His missed getting the button into the stomach so when I had a feeding that night the fluid went directly into my abdominal cavity cause great pain. My belly was distended and was limiting my ability to breath and then because of the pain my nurse was able to get my normal 2mg of dilauded upped to 4mg to catch the pain. Well they didnt know what all was wrong and didnt realize my belly was distended and once the dilauded was on board it naturally slowed my breathing down. Long story short I coded and we traced it back to the button not being properly placed that led to the chain of events that caused the code. Today I had my PEG tube replaced and went in for the procedure and all went well there, they kept me a little longer in recovery just to keep an eye on me with all the meds they had in me for twilight sedation and pain meds. Just to make sure. Once I was pretty much aware (which they hit me with a reversal very quickly after the procedure was finished) they brought me up to my room and immediately I needed some pain medication because the stuff they gave me down there was wearing off. Well I already have prescribed meds 5mg oxycodone every four hours as needed and 20mg oxycontin every 12 hours. The added meds that were approved was another 5mg of oxycodone every four hours. I knew it was low but I wasnt going to fuss until I knew for sure that 10mg wouldnt work. Took the 10mg oxycodone and no dice, the final bits of the bigger meds wore off from downstairs and the oxycodone wasnt cutting it. I requested that we see if we can get something stronger just to take the edge off, not to rid me completely of the pain just get the edge off. My nurse called my docs service and the doc on call said I could have 15mg of oxycodone once and then back to 10mg every four hours. She brought it in and I took it because at that point I was crying even though I knew it wouldnt work. I explained to my nurse what had happened at the beginning of my stay and said that it wasnt supposed to be a problem in getting IV pain meds when needed for bad pain. The doc had seen that I had the OD which wasnt an OD but rather a bunch of crap that just dominoed out of control. So my mom called the service and then talked to the doc on call and he was telling her he cant give me more because of my OD a bit back and oxycodone was all he was going to give meshe crawled all up his ass and he ended up calling my regular doc. He called in 1mg of dilauded every three hours as needed and I am now finding out if that is all the pain meds I get or if I still have the oxycodone every four hours plus oxycontin twice a day. The problem was that I should have been able to get IV meds but was unable to because of my chart and record (mind you my first PEG tube I was ordered 1mg dilauded every four hours and vicoden 7/500 every two as needed). I had talked with my doc because I was afraid that this exact thing would happen and it did. Before I wasnt to worried about what all happened and would have accepted an apology from Dr. Aziz for his fuck up, he never did and instead tried to weasel his way out of it saying things like He couldnt tell or it happens every 1 in 100 and other crap, I replied well when it doesnt feel right or you arent confident that it is placed correctly what do you do? He said we get a CT scan. Well he didnt that day because I was the last task of the day for him so he blew out at the end of his shift even with me saying it wasnt right. After that exchange I wanted for him to pay the difference to the insurance company as well as Medicare for the additional costs of his screw up like ICU costs, extra CT scans and suchnothing for me but reimbursement for the extra costs. Now that I have had this problem with getting meds because of his fuckup and me in pain and having to track down my doc to get something that would work and knowing that this will happen again in the future now I want blood. What would you folks do? I have already had my family look for a malpractice lawyer and as luck would have it we know one and his daughter studied voice under my grandmother. I feel bad in one way because I dont want to bring a frivolous lawsuit and the system needs reformed so huge settlements for silly ass things would never flyI am torn on what to do. What would you do? What would you ask for? It wasnt about money for me in the beginning, but now having dealt with what I feared no more than a week later and knowing that if it happened this time it wont change anytime soon and if my doc is out of town then other docs who arent in the loop to what happened then I will be in pain until I get a hold of my normal doc. What would you ask for? What would you demand? Am I overreacting to this all? Please let me know what you would do ________________________________________________________________________ That was a letter I wrote to my CF group and it pretty much sums up my suck ass day. Peace

 WEll today I am going to be getting another PEG tube put in...oh joy! It is better that I have one because this whole eating thing is just not working. I will also try weight gain formulas instead of that crap they give you. First the aftertaste in the morning is just bleech...and secondly if I am going to be filling my stomach and not eating during the day I might as well put something in there that has more calories than what that crap they give you. The good thing about surgery is you go in, they give you the drugs, then you wake up later on with everything done. Another good thing is that they will be giving me better pain meds, or rather stronger ones. Maybe I can get the Dilaudid back because that shit works miracles. Oxycodone products (Vicodan, oxycodone, Oxycontin, and others) work when you get enough in me...but they don't work well at the doses they give me which are too low considering my high tolerance to pain meds. Well that is all for this update...I will probably update while I am still drugged when I get back so the post may be interesting... Peace

 We turned Iraq back over to the Iraqis yesterday and it looks like there is going to be much more bloodshed over the next year or so. CNN has a story about what people on the streets over there thought about it all. The wanted us to go...blaa blaa blaa. They are leary of the new "governors" and government that is in place. Then they got to a newspaper publisher and he is running a headline today which was pretty interesting and I hadn't thought of it all this way. The headline goes something like this "America keeps its promise" and goes on to tell what happened. I am glad that we did hand soverienty back over to them, but what we handed them is a bit of legal mumbo jumbo that really sais that if they (Iraqi government) want to change parts of the laws Bremer and his crack team of corporate leaders and lawyers they have to come up with big votes and the way the structure is set up it may be impossible in practice to do. The prime minister Ayad Allawi was a loyal Ba'athist leader until he left the nation a while back. He has little experience and I believe he comes out of the same school of thought as Hussein. Allawi is a brutish thug that thinks he has great ideas, not unlike Hussein. If some people are correct in their assesments we may have just installed the next Hussein. I hope that things calm down for a couple of simple reasons. 1st I want for our troops to get home as quickly and safely as possible. I just wish we were leaving now and let the nation drag itself into a civil war and then deal with the regime that comes out of it. 2nd I want it to end soon because the Iraqi people have been brutalized for the past 35 years and we have only continued the pratice. I fear that we may not know how to deal with them and their culture differences, but it is clear that we are bumbling about making things harder. 3rd That whatever Iraqi state that emerges will be a secular state and reject fundamentalist religions. That is my wish list. I don't want Bush to get the credit at all. I want for there to be a debate of what we did and how badly we damaged our relationships with other nations around the world. I will say something positive about what has happened and what is going on. We were wrong to do what we did but we have done a few good things. They now have a less limited TV channel and mor papers have cropped up spurring free speech. We have been attempting to get schools open and hospital equipet (why that one is so hard is beyond me...they could do it and fully stock drugs for hospital in mere months if the money is invested). There are things that are getting better, but it is going to continue to be hard and we will continue bleeding. I just hope we can get a pressure dressing on it soon or we may loose it all and be dead in the water. Personal stuff. I am still in the hospital. My PFT (lung function test) was bad a few days ago (worse than what they admitted me for), the second one I had on Sunday was back to where I was when I was brought in. Overall no real improvement. So Dr. Weinburg wants to keep me a bit longer. My pre-albunim levels (protien measurement) was 18.9 when I came in. 20 is normal so I was not to terribly low. The last set of blood they got yesterday moring shows that my levels have dropped to 8-9 which is not good. The best reason for this happening is the whole ICU adventure. First I am a skinny little dude, I have few resources to go digging into when things go bad. Well after the ICU visit I was on a clear liquid diet then was bumped to dark liquid diet (grits and other stuff like that). I finally got back on a regular menu and my appetite is pretty much shot. I will put something in my mouth and chew and chew and chew and then try to swallow. The top portion of the swallowing mechanism (back of mouth) works somewhat ok. It is the middle bits that are causing problem. I have to fight to get basically mush into my stomach. It is something physical because I am having trouble with getting even pills down (considering I could take 10-15 at a time) has me worried. I need for those parts to work. The nutritionist (which she is nice here and helps out as much as she can) stopped by and told me about my albunin levels and said to me that she thinks I need the tube badly to get my minerals in order. I know it doesn't help me gain weight. Doctor Weinburg also agreed and first we are going to look and see if a fungus is causing problems with swallowing and if that is the case then we will treat that and then swallowing may come back on its own. However they are also going to evaluate me to have another PEG tube in. I think that I won't escape not having to get one. They suck bacause they just hang all balls out. I am going to ask if I can go directly to the button. My stomach hole is almost healed totally and they may be able to cut back through and save the one hole and just get it into my stomach. We will see...I would use it more often (every day and night) if it was easier and less intrusive to me, and less balls out hanging of hoses and such. With the lungs not perking up he is going to run a coarse of Solumdrol (a steriod) to get them working maybe a bit better. It should also stimulate hunger. I am glad I didn't leave today because no more than an hour after Weinburg leaving I had a treatment and went for CPT (chest physical therapy -aka- a beating). I didn't just but barely get comfortable and then after two lite taps I knew something popped. I didn't even bother to cough as it just slid out of my mouth. I had the moron PFT dude here and once it started I asked him to get me a contianer to cough in or anything that will hold sloopy bloody gew. It took him almost five mintuse to find the bucket I asked for and just grabbed the whole thin and brought it over. Now in this bucket is assorted goodies you might need incliding a spit cup. So she's handing me the entire bucket with all the shit and I just reached in grabed the kindey like bowl to cough into it. I then just gave him a dirty look. I don't like him because he is just a poor respiratory therapist and probably the worst here in this hospital. After Weinburg got back he lookes at it and mumbled "guess I am glad I didn't let him go". This will give him a chance to figure out what is up. so... Well it is very early in the morn and I want to get some sleep. Peace out

 Nevermind about Wednesday...we already transferred sovereignty of Iraq back to them. It changes nothing, we still will be occupying, we still be making most of the choices, we will still be the "security" for them, and if they ask us to leave we will laugh at them and tell them to get back to pretending that they are running things. We know that the right-wing nutters will all be out on the talk shows and news shows talking about how smooth it went and how they now have control. Bush will once again be the "hero". It will look like we caught Hussein in the polls. Bush will receive a bump in the poles but once people realize that there will be continued violence against Iraqis, our troops will still be in the crossfire and many more will die (unfortunately), the beheading will continue. Nothing will change and we will still pretty much be in control...the difference is they have a home grown "hero" that has done a great job in the past working for the CIA. Oh something that I don't know if I had mentioned before is the situation with the detainees from Afghanistan, and prisoners from Iraq. The Red Cross and several other groups have come out and said that first they should have more access to these folks, but more importantly they need to charge them with a crime, release them, or break international law. The administration line is that Afghan detainees do not fall under the Geneva Convention because the Taliban never signed onto the treaty, and that Al-Qaida forces are not under them either because they are "enemy combatants" that have practically no rights for anything. Legally they may have a case in some weird way but they painted themselves into a corner on these folks legally. First when a case was brought by a lawyer who could not gain access to his client there as well as take sworn testimony from others. The military and justice department claimed that because they could not be questioned because of their status and that the supreme court has no jurisdiction over them because they are not in the country. Then they claimed that Gitmo was part of sovereign US territory so certain laws applied. Basically the Administration tried to play both sides...so it is confusing. As for Iraqi prisoners the administration considers the top guys from the Hussein regime as prisoners of war. Well the good ole' Geneva Convention says that once the war is over and all prisoners captured during the war, the winning party or the ones who have custody of the prisoners have to bring charges on these people if they did anything within 90 days or they have to set them loose, or they can break the rules of the treaty which is what they have done. Hussein has fallen into a limbo situation. He has been in custody for over 90 days, the war is over, and he hasn't been charged or released so keeping him in custody is against international treaties and law. It is claimed that we will not turn him over the Iraqi courts until we can guarantee that he will get a fair trial (hah! yeah right!) so we still have him. The US government will not turn him over to the international court because during the trial they will be able to indict other big wigs who helped him get weapons or facilitated war crimes (gassing of Kurds and Iranians). So who would that be...hmm Donald Rumsfeld could be charged with crimes against humanity, the late Reagan could have been charged, and many many others high in the government that was in place during the 80's (Papa Bush would also be charged). So world court is a no no...so we have to turn him over the new government there or we have to deal with him. Oh things are just so fucked up...and if we could actually get Hussein a fair trial it could take down the all mighty neo-cons. Oh and on another note. Hussein, Bin-Laden, Scott Peterson, Kobe Bryant...in our court system, in our law, they are all innocent until proven guilty by a court of law. Sure we know Hussein was a bad dude and killed many of his own people...and yes he is guilty as hell, but he still deserves a fair trial. The same with Bin-Laden...we pretty much know he did it and planned it but under our system he is innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. I hate all those people who attack people like me or Michael Moore when we state this point of fact. It doesn't mean that I think they didn't do it, but to serve justice, to be a true democracy, and to follow the law that has been practiced for many many years we must insure they get a fair trial. It is the American way...if you are out there saying why bother with a trial for these dudes just hang em high...well I hope that you are never caught up in some false charges over killing a little retarded girl. The evidence may point to you but in reality someone else did it, but if you go with the "screw it he's guilty" ideology then the system might go away and you won't get a trial. So as repugnant as it seems these men are still due there basic rights. Peace

 I may be going home a little later today if I am lucky but I am thinking that there is something brewing, while not fully out the bugs are certainly partying up in my lungs. After I coded last Friday evening I went on O2 and have been on it since. Without the O2 my sats drop to between 82-89% on room air. I require some O2 to get back into the norm. Right now I am on 2 litres of O2 and my sats hover around 90-94%, on more oxygen the better they get. The room air sat was at rest to, and that scares me. I me going on O2 no. Right now I am watching "Enemy at the Gates"...an excellent movie. Well I am going to try and sleep. Peace

 Wednesday is the day that we turn "power" back over to the Iraqi puppet regime. The violence is getting worse by the day, more Iraqis are dying each day, US troops are in the crossfire, the resistors are getting bolder, and all the while the administation line is that things are better. Inflation supposedly hasn't risen but for those of us who aren't wealthy inflation is a bitch. Inflation is based off of a rise in price of durable goods (car, dishwashers, I don't know about housing but I think it is counted as well) in addition to other goods and services like food, gas, and a whole host of other things. Milk in some places is over 4 gallon, gas is hovering right around the 2 dollar mark (although we still pay less than most of the world for gas), foodstuffs have gone up because it costs more to get food to market, housing costs are up, energy costs are up...all of these things are up yet inflation is still low. The problem is that wages haven't risen to keep pace with these basic goods. Sure a washing machine cost the same as last year, but you can't eat a washing machine. Inflation has happened only to the poor...or rather it is the poor that are suffering the most. The pay check that has remained the same for the past year or more isn't making it now when the basics command a higher price. It is all just a mess. So what the economy gained 100,000 jobs in a month. Chances are that job is lower paying for many of the workers getting jobs now then their last job paid. So not only is Joe making less in dollar amount per pay cycle, but that money is also worth less than just a year ago. The nation is groaning under its debt. Trillions in federal debt, tens of trillions in private debt and Bush says things are getting better. Well Mr Bush it may be getting better for you and your circle of men, but for the rest of us it isn't... Things are going to break soon. I just hope it breaks for better and we come out with something better because we certainly cannot keep doing it the way we are doing. Peace

 I got an email today from the person who runs the CysticL mailing list. He wants me to stay on topic and stop saying other shit. I sent out a reply to a reply of a reply...basically I floated a porn movie idea...it wasn't dirty or descriptive, it was funny. He also wants me to tone down the political discussions that I often have/do/start. I kinda told him that I would tone down the off topic stuff (basically not spin things out as far as I do...my brain will spin things to the n-th degree and I often write it down or say it out loud...my little censor dude gave up a long time ago and said fuck it...let him make an ass out of himself) but I told him that he could pretty much shove it up his ass for other things. I will hold political discussions about health care and what our government does because it does directly effect CF patients. Also my kidneys feel a bit better...so I am not as gimpy as I was. Off to read some news and other stuff. Peace

 Today I have been pretty miserable. I hope that the rest of this day goes better. I am rehydrating myself because I think that I am very dehydrated. That is probably why my parts hurt (kidneys), and might be interfering with me just being able to breath well. Well I am going to get some rest after I get my next shot of dilauded. Goodnight.

 One of the nurses here at the hospital brought me a couple of old issues of Time. Many of the things, and people involved, are the same cast of characters now. The issue is from December 13, 1971. In the reader comment section of Time some people posed or nominated a couple of characters that are now on the front lines. "Sir: My nomination for Man of the Year: John Kerry. His eloquent, haunting protest against the war may well mark a turning point in our country's 'long day's journey into the night.'" By: Jero Magon of Miami Beach "Sir: For Man of the Year: the uncaped crusader, Ralph Nader." By: Mrs. M.E. Valentine of Dearing, Kans. It is interesting to note that the players that were around then are still around 33 years later. I find that sad because it means that politics and the whole machine is definitely not geared to bring in new ideas and leadership. Health Matters. I went down for a CT earlier today to find out what in the hell is going on that has been drawing down my O2 sats. I had to get another IV because they can't put the contrast right into the PICC line because of where it dumps out at. The contrast, had it gone through the PICC line and dumped out where the PICC line ends, could have caused a serious embolism. The CT scan showed that there aren't any huge mucus plugs or blood clots, but it does show some sort of diffusion in there that could be a new virus that we haven't seen in me yet. My kidneys started hurting earlier today, not just uncomfortable hurt, rather please stab me in the heart with a rusty spoon, salt, and lemon drops for sterilization. The biggest problem is that my O2 sats are dropping more each day and that is the scary part. So maybe if we can figure out what that stuff is on the scan and treat it, suck it out, or yell at it, then I think things will get better. Peace

 Ok I am going to bitch a little. I am having a lot of problems breathing and my sats keep on dropping. With 8 litres of oxygen I am at 91%, at night worse I guess because in the morning the past few mornings my oxygen has been bumped up another litre or two. Right now I can barely breath it feels like so I am going to relax some more and just remain calm. Peace from the purple boy.

 Instead of sneakily changing my previous post I need to report that the news about the Bush documents didn't hit the light of day until 6:47 AM. I reported that it hit the world at around 6:30. That was the last time that I had looked at the clock before I laid back and relaxed (I also got benadryl and dilauded at that time so time moves funky on those drugs). So there is the correction. I don't want people to say "YOU LIED!!!"...I just got the times mixed up by about 17 minutes. Peace

 If I had felt a little better when I first heard this early this morning around 6:30 AM I would have posted it immediately. What would posses me to want to post something that early considering I had been asleep (I was woken up for Benadryl, Dilauded, and Fortaz) and would have slipped back into the warm embrace of unconsciousness. There was a very short bit of blurb or press release from the White House. It seems that three months of El-Presidente' Bushs' military record had been destroyed. The real shocking part is that it was the months of service records that would show where he had been when missing and why; possibly, he was decertified for flight. I am sure that is was this big ole' mistake and all of the records from that three month period for his Texas Air National Guard unit were destroyed...so if you wanted to oh say, find someone else's record it would be impossible. The New York Times is the one who is reporting this mess. It seems that there was an effort to preserve microfitch films of payroll records and they were destroyed. I don't know how you screw that kind of restoration and preservation up. They have been practicing for many years in keeping them fresh and usable. It is just mighty damn convenient. I just wanted to get that up. I heard it first on CNN and they were reporting on a NY Times report. Some linx...how clever of me linx/links (wink wink) NY Times links may require registration Reuters report at NY Times. The same article different place on NY Times. Campaign 2004 Coverage on NY Times. You may have to register to get the articles...but registration is free. Regardless of whether it was truly an accident or it was a deliberate destruction of files there is something else that comes into play. When the records were finally pried from the White House some time back at the beginning of the year they claimed that those were all the files and they had done thorough research trying to find the paperwork. They released all of it with some of it blacked out for privacy reasons (which I understand, but it looks like he is hiding something he is still entitled to some privacy) they made a very big deal of the fact that they were releasing all of the files and that they missed nothing. Remember they released them late on a Friday evening and didn't let the press remove them from the office so they had to scour through them late in the evening and were not allowed to take them out to thoroughly vet them. So they lied again on this...while it may have taken them by surprise, it really should not have if they had truly looked under every rock, looked through all the records and such. So it was a lie of omission. Peace

 There is so much coming to head today. We have terrorist alerts at such a strange time. Even given the benefit of the doubt and they may be planning a large attack, the timing is just way to damn convenient. Stories of Pakistani security forces being given deadlines to catch or kill the top leaders like Bin-Laden and others. However the congress, specifically the Senate is locked up with legislation about a gay marriage constitutional ban, and other worthless pieces of legislation instead of bringing up the bill that funds our intelligence machine and money that is needed to make preparations for a possible terrorist attack. Of coarse the Republicans say that the Democrats are holding things up because they refuse to vote on the other bills, the Dems blame the Republicans because of bumping up the legislation for funding they would rather have things go in sequence and before that bill comes other much less important bills that will probably not be passed anyway. I have an idea...dump all non-essential bills. Get to security bills, get to bills that send money to police and firefighters. Who cares about a fruit marrying a fruit. If you are more concerned about gay marriage and think that it should take precedence over anti-terrorism legislation and funding...then go for it. You know what you deserve to die. Fucking retards.

 I have been looking over the past few days of posts and I have noticed something. Actually I noticed it earlier this morning when I was being given my morning doses of IV meds. Let me explain. Over the past few days I have been breathing a little faster and shallower. I haven't thought to much about it until this morning when the pieces just fell into place. This morning I had ripped my oxygen off at some point during the night and when my early morning IV treatment which this morning included benadryl, dilaudid, fortaz, and then added this morning was a blood draw. When the nurse first woke me up I guess I was kinda going along with it all then all of a sudden I was aware but blank and I asked what I was supposed to be doing when she handed me the blood collection stuff. She looked at me strangely and then she said she was going to get the other meds. It came to me but it took a good minute for me to realize what I was supposed to do. Once it clicked in my head I drew out the waste blood and then got the blood sample they needed and just sat there pretty much dead headed. It was a strange and uncomfortable feeling. I put the oxygen back on and pretty soon I started to get back in the game and started processing things more completely. When I am not on oxygen I go goofy. My lungs have finally gotten to the point where I think I may need to have oxygen all the time. I was completely disoriented and it only got better once my O2 levels came up. When I mentioned what happened to my nurse that is taking care of me now he said that the night shift nurse had said something about me being disoriented when I didn't have the O2 on. So it was like a revelation out of the blue. Damn that sucks because I really don't want to have to drag around an O2 tank and shit. I was hoping that I could stave off carrying around an O2 tank altogether and just get to transplant or whatever was going to happen. I guess I will learn to deal with it as I have to with other things but I really didn't want to have to. Side effects of low oxygen is that my fingers peel. The skin up to the nail starts peeling back and that has really kicked in the past few days. Shit. I also wanted to do an early post because of some things I have seen over the past few hours. Particularly concerning the Kerry - Edwards campaign already. I saw their first speech together and it was almost like night and day. Kerry is a shitty speech giver. He is able to say a lot without making a point. He can tap dance around an issue, give a twenty minute speech, and all you asked is "how was your day". When Edwards got up it was lightning had hit the crowd. While the applauded and cheered Kerry, the might as well have built an altar and sacrificed some virgins for Edwards because he was just that much better. He picked up where he left off during the primaries and just kicked ass. Now I will give Kerry a little bit of a bone. He has started to get better at giving rousing speeches and I believe that one on one with Bush he will definitely look smarter, sound smarter, but I fear that he may do to much tap dancing. I fear that his intelligence may work against him. I understand what he says, many people do, but we all just want to yell at him "GET TO THE FRIGGIN' POINT". There is nothing wrong with the way I feel or many others. Our hopes are on the line here. Many of us feel that the very future of humanity may be on the line. I feel personally that if we choose Bush we choose war. We will be at war for some period of time and it will cost us the good will of the world and in the end we will be defeated. If we choose Kerry I cannot say for sure that there will not be war, but I do have the feeling that Kerry won't go marching off on premature or pre-emptive wars. Will Kerry stop the bloodshed in Iraq or will he remove us from that mess. I doubt it. I would hope that he would listen to the will of smarter people and just get us the hell out of there, but I doubt he will. We do need to find a way to help them, maybe we leave and just send food and equipment, let them fight out a new government. I dunno the answer because it has now become infinitely worse. Back to the campaign. Edwards is a help. He is able to identify with normal people. I don't care that he is worth something in the neighborhood of 30 million, and that Kerry through his wife Teresa is worth between 500 million to a billion bucks. I don't care about that. What I care about is what they are going to do to help me, or rather are they going to make my life harder or easier. Harder is me worrying that I may loose my health insurance, easier is me not having to worry about that. I don't expect gold to rain down and the economy to miraculously open up and honey to flow freely. We just need for it not to have bad fiscal policy that is driving our nation into ever deeper depths increasing the likelihood of our nation foundering and put into a position where it will be ripe for the armies of "privatizers" to come in and destroy what so many people have given their lives for over our history. This campaign is a turning point, I am not so naive to think that if we elect Kerry - Edwards all will be magically better, rather if we vote them in then we at least will have a few more years on this our experiment. So forget about Kerry being dull (he talks all the right things that are emotional...but rarely does emotion seep through the tough veneer), forget that he blusters on for interminable periods of time, but in the end he is the better choice and the best hope that we can keep on rockin' in the free world. Peace One last thing. This is an article that I stumbled across that says what I have tried to say about Michael Moore's "Fahrenheit 9/11" . Give it a read as it really is dead on.

 Woo...I thought that they had monkeyed around with Blogger some more. I am glad they didn't because I am used to this format. I cleaned the room pretty nicely because there was just odds and ends hanging around. So I got it cleaned up and the room looks nice...a side note is that I got a bit hungry and I have been biting the heads off of sour patch kids (you see when you bite their heads off you need to make little screaming noises so that people with think you are eating babies....mmm babies. I want my baby back baby back baby back ribs...chilis baby back ribs....git in my belly! Ok enough of that. I have this bumper sticker that I can fill in. It has a "I" then a heart, and then you fill in the rest with whatever you want. I was going to go with WHORES! But lets face it...I don't want a whore (unless she is a dirty dirty girl like Christina). I got two compliments today. One was from a family friend. I had wrote her a letter about what all happened since I had gotten into the hospital. I really don't remember much of the letter because I scribbled it down so soon. Apparently what I wrote was a very detailed description and she liked it. This lady is a retired librarian so she knows good from bad. She showed the letter to her daughter (or daughter in law) who teaches an English class and she raved over it. My friend called to tell me that she loved the letter and to ask me if I would allow for her daughter (in law?) to use it in her English class to drive home the descriptions. Hey so something I have done is going to live on and be taught with. Also I had a newcomer to my blog site last night. She is a nurse from the hospital here. Normally I do not invite people from the hospital because I am weird and if it got out how weird my care might get whacky...naa but there are some things that are part of my sordid past. Some things of coarse I would change, but overall I am proud of the work I have done. This nurse complimented me on the content and told me to continue to be true to me. Woah! I have things to work out...and right now I am dead ass tired. I am about to get a booster or benadryl and then dilauded. I will be back tomorrow....till then Peace

 I am currently doing a complete backup of my Toshiba Pocket PC GenioE 550. It is about time just so I have it all if for example it does something goofy and I have to restore the system. My friend Kate stopped by last night (7/5 and early 7/6) and we chatted for a bit. She is pretty damn cool and easy to talk with because she has shit to say. Today a friend of the family just popped into town. Carol Lee is a great person and I love her dearly. She is the lady that has offered to give me a place to say, a car, and all sorts of things to just make me happy and help her out. She certainly is a great person and would bend over backwards if there was anything she could ever do for me. I feel really lucky because in reality I have a great set of people around me in my family and they are very supportive. She gave me a great compliment today and it is actually something that I have been thinking about it so getting the compliment made me feel like I wasn't just wasting time. She said that she thinks that I should go back to school and get a political science degree with a history minor (anyone who has read this blog would understand that I would easily pass these courses without much effort). Then with that teach and write books. She knows my teaching style and I will toot my horn a little...I can do a good job at teaching and you will walk out with the heavier duty words because I will use simple language and attach the more difficult terms to it all and associate it so that people get what it means. I am like Edwards and what they are saying where he can break down complex directives and speech and break it down to what people can understand. I do that well. I do want to write and I am practicing and trying to work out some of my bad habits. I will then have to pick a topic and run with it. Like I have said I have ideas in the works for things I want to do and from that I can teach and become active. I want to be on the national show and challenge these dufuses about ideas they supposedly know all about what middle America wants. Well I am going to get myself ready for another shot of benadryl and dilauded then I need to get some food from the cafeteria and then hit the sack. Thank you all for sticking with my blog and know that you will see the changes as they happen. Hopefully you will all become somewhat active with me....and if you all give input into my work you will all be credited. Peace... Oh yeah and I have a few more blogs to add and some other stuff. I am also going to be working to make this place a place where I will feel no shame about letting the nursing and hospital staff read....so I will have to not forget and slip and say I would chase her in the weeds kinda thing. Night all.

 I am going to drop a quick note that this mailing list that I am on for CF patients is just a lot of fun. Many people on there are prudes and seem to get their knickers in a knot over really silly stuff. However most of the people are really nice and can take a joke well, and it does have some great things going for it because they are all there only for support and questions from each other. It is a good place to get things out, but it also a good place to have fun. TTYL Peace

 Well obviously those posts I wrote did go through but I wasn't able to tell that they had actually made it to the blog. I am watching "Fahrenheit 9/11" again just so I can stay enraged on this; our Nations Birthday, travesty of what is going on in the world. Our Nation is now 228 years old. We are still a young nation in looking at others around the world. Our democratic republic has been the most ambitious attempt at creating a society that allows great personal freedoms to go after any goal one could ever imagine. The great part is that even with all of our national faults people have proven time and time again that any man or woman can lift themselves from one socio-economic class to another. The promise of this nation is that it offers the opportunity to go as far as you want. Our nation is great and nearly alone in this idea or practice. The promise that our nation can be a beacon to the rest of the world of personal freedom and political progressiveness. The sad part of all this is that our nation is faultering in these ideals. Our nation is in grave danger from a very determined group of individuals that preach the virtues of our system yet continuously subvert them through money, political clout, and downright theft in many cases. Some of us know who I am talking about some of you don't. I will give you a clue as to whom these people are although I cannot tell you outright to continue my thought or spread the word because that actually subverts the very idea of our own nation. The enemies of our nation are the very people who wear their patriotism and religion on their sleeves. They are the people who tell you to listen and follow blindly without questioning what we are doing or where we are going, much less what it will cost in lives, dollars, and above all else our own personal freedoms. You have seen these people on TV lieing about current world events, although many people don't see the lies or recognize them, but if you don't believe them then we can look at these same people who say "You are with us, or you are with them, the terrorists." Those are the people who are the true threat to our nation. It crosses party lines, there is no specific race behind it all. This is a large group of people from all sorts of walks of life. I also speak of Pastors, Ministors, Rabbis, Emans, and all religious leaders that have that same mentality. You are with them or you are with the damned. All of these people are the same. One group may be running our nation, the others running our moral lives. All of them are the same, they are all terrorists of the worst kind. They are the terrorists of thought, the terrorists that take away our freedoms, the terrorists are those people that seek to keep us in fear all the time regardless of what is going on around us. 9/11 changed things for us for sure. The biggest thing that it changed was our blindness to the rest of the world. We lost 3000+ lives, we launched two wars that have had tens of thousands of civilian dead, we have lost around 900 of our finest in military actions. However probably the most devistating loss to us has been the loss of the illusion. Finally with the blinders off we now see what the rest of the world has lived with for many years. Our nation has been lucky on the terrorism front, we have remained relatively untouched considering the role we have played in causing terror around the world. The loss of the blinders, the opening of our eyes to even a cleansed, sanitized, and largely censored view of the rest of the world has cost us our national sanity. Sanity? Yes. Sanity. Since we were not attacked but rather the target of a terrorist strike or event whatever you want to call it we have lost our minds. We had people on TV selling parachutes for people in skyscrapers to use in case of fire or terrorist attack to use as a means of escape. There has been a marked increase in sales of so called "safe rooms"...hell we were told that we could survive a biologic or chemical weapon attack if we simply sealed off a room in our house with duct tape and plastic. I wonder just how many people actually fell for that. I wonder how many people honestly felt that with some plastic sheets and duct tap they could avoid anthrax, or worse. How many people really fell for that. The simple fact is if you sealed yourself into a room with plastic and duct tape when an attack was happening it probably wouldn't stop the little baddies getting through that minimal barrier, but if you did manage to seal yourself up well enough you would run out of air to breath. We lost our sanity and we have willingly given into fear. When we started to fear we gave up willingly many rights that our men and women of the military have fought for. What our forefathers struggled for, and what we continue to preach that we have. It is ashame that at the very time we are supposedly bringing "democracy and freedom" to other nations, offering up our military for that ideal in other nations, at the same time many of the very rights we fight for are being taken away here at home. They aren't fighting to take them away, we are handing them our rights. It is time to stop the madness. It is time to stand up and say that we are more affraid of loosing our rights than being the victim of a terrorist attack. It is time that we actually honor those who died in the name of our freedom on that trajic day in 2001. We must honor them by taking back what we have lost. So on this 4th of July 2004 I mourn for my nation. I mourn for the men and women who have died for my nation, a nation that has been hijacked by fundamentalists no better than those who occupy caves in Afghanistan, or the deserts of Iraq, or those who are here, now plotting their next strike. I mourn that we have become largely a nation of scared people who no longer rely on themselves for their truth but rely on those who have lied to them over and over again. On this day I also see that our nation is on the verge of rebirth. I see all of the various groups and interests coming around, heading directly for each other in a crash that will shake the world. Out of this crash I feel that our nation will be better for it. I feel that on the other side we will be that beacon to others. At no other time in our history have we seen such forces at work, while many have said that before I truly feel that we are in a time of change. So on this, the 228th birthday of our nation, I see that she is coming to a rebirth. Long live the United States of America and her promise to be the best that humans can be. Let us focus our attention and energies of shaking the tree of freedom and loosening the bonds of fear. I don't know about all of you, but I am ready to have my nation back. Celebrate that our nation is indeed a great experiment and we are currently adding many ingredients and pretty soon we will have something new. Peace...love your fellow man. Love those around you who dispise you. If you live that way and pratice this every day and you will be better than all those out there who would drive us around in fear.

 Lets try this post again. I am going to compile a database of each state's Public Health Care plans and systems. In that database I am going to look at the number of people it serves from year to year, the amount of money spent year to year, and the budget year to year. Basically what I am going to do is see how much the systems have been cut. I will need some help in getting the numbers together but mainly I will need to have people help me collect and compile news articles on state health care budget cuts. The whole idea is to find out how fast the system is shrinking and then find out through calculations how much it would cost to insure the uninsured. Ultimately I want to see how much it would cost to have a national single payer health care system. Now here is one of the things that I think should stay the same. I think that hospital groups like UPMC (University of Pittsburgh Medical Center), or other University hospitals, and all hospitals (except VA facilities and those need to be upgraded and fully funded immediately) will remain under their current control structures. In other words the Government doesn't appropriate them, instead they will bill one entity for all medical bills. You can, and should, keep records of procedures and costs per patient but the hospital won't nesecarily won't bill individually. The hospital will submit a monthly bill to the insurance system and it pays it out to the hospital. Auditing will be done every so many years. Adding new technology to a hospital will be a cyclical thing. A new type of scanner is on the market that is usefull then the hospitals buy them just like they always do and then pass the bills on to the insurer as part of what would be a yearly upgrade budget for hospitals. There will be of coarse funds that will allow for hospitals to expand and renovate when needed but again because the hospitals are run privately or as they are now the billing only goes to one place. They still have to come up with money for new wings or equipment. There will be some money available each year from the Government but the rest will come from fund raisng drives or through submitting grants. Also they could by the equipment and expense it over a period of time. The idea is to allow hospitals to run as they do now but instead of having to bill up to 250 different plans just bill one place. Overhead goes down radically and the waste of beaurocracy is almost gone immediately. Well that is all tonight....maybe this one will post afterall. Peace

 Hmmm..they have changed the input section yet again. It is pleasing to the eye and it looks like they have added a few things. &nbsp; Anyways Steven Hawkings has solved his own paradox or so he says. He will be presenting it soon. Basically from what I understand he said that everything that goes into a black hole get gobbled up and just goes "poof" and all the information of the matter that went in there is lost. It is complex quantum physics stuff that I certainly have little grasp on. I just know something isn't right about the whole "poof" its gone. He now thinks that black holes essentially leak information over time so it destroys his "poof" idea. Here is a Newscientist.com writeup on it. &nbsp; I think that theoretically any black hole can gobble up all of the matter in this universe over an infinite period of time. When it finishes gobbling up the universe or matter here that matter isn't just lost it goes "bang" into a new universe and we have the big bang all over again. Now the limiter is time because it becomes meaningless. So there can be billions of black holes in this universe and they are all creating new universes elsewhere on another plane. Because time is the limiting factor or rather not a factor you essentially have this continual big bang happening over and over again as a new black hole forms. So once one forms a new universe is started because time doesn't matter. That is what I think. That is the only way I can wrap my mind around it because I always thought you cannot destroy matter, you can move it, you can change it from one form to another, but you cannot outright destroy or create it so it has to come from or go somewhere. &nbsp; Wow my head hurts after that one.&nbsp;I love the theoretical stuff. I wish that I was smarter so that I could do that. &nbsp; Well if Hawkings comes out and says this in his speech then guess what I got it down first. I have thought this over and over again. &nbsp; Anyways...I am going to surf a bit more then probably sleep. &nbsp; Peace

 They finally got me back to a normal room and I can't tell you how much better it is. The rooms are about the same size but they are better configured and plus I have a mini-fridge here in the room so I can get to keep extra food and drinks with me. I had another little lung bleed again this morning. It happens, I am not going to get to upset with it all. As long as it stops like it did then it isn't a big deal. I don't know what else to say this morning except that I am mad because they have on Golfing on TNT instead of my normal morning TV schedule. 10AM ER, 11AM ER, 12PM Judging Amy, 1PM Law and Order. It is all just screwed up so I have to float and I am actually watching ESPN and on right now is the trade of Shaq to the Miami Heat. It is actually the most interesting thing on right now. Plus I like Shaq. I like how he lives, I like that he says that he is no role model so put him up as one, yet he lives a pretty decent and private life. I just see a good man who wants to get paid for his play and he plays well. I just hope that he can continue to be a good role model because even though he says he doesn't to be, it seems almost out of question that he would get caught up in any kind of a scandal. He has kept his lifestyle on the downlow and if he has diddled outside of his marriage is seems that he does it right. I doubt that he does that completely though after seeing him in various shows with his wife and those kids he has. You can just tell that he is love with them and would never do something to jeapordize that and I have a great deal of respect for that. I also like the fact that he credits his parents for where he is and that his drill seargent dad kept him inline. I believe that is why he is the way he is. If he were to screw up it would disapoint his parents and I think that he holds them in high regard. Well I am going to surf around for a bit. Dr. Weinberg said that he thinks that these ports in here are supposed to be setup for Ethernet. If they are then I will need to get wireless router so that I can get all my stuff working. I love my internet on the phone but if I can get uber speed through the ethernet port then I am all for it. That will make things easier for me down the road. As I get sicker (which is going to happen I have realized that) I know that I will be spending more time here. So I might as well have all the right stuff on hand so that I can play and have some fun. There are things that I want to do. I am looking to build a better SFF box (small form factor). The new stuff that is getting ready to come out is driving costs down. I just want to get a system that has everything built in and allows for the possibility of RAID drive in the future because I would love to get two WD Raptor 10,000RPM 74GB SATA drives and RAID them together and have my third drive be just a big ole SATA drive (I have 120GB right now and I love that drive). Also I have a decent processor and good RAM and an excellent vid card. I can also get a full fledged double layer DVD+-R/RW burner for about 90 bucks. If I can put this new system together for a few hundred bucks that means I can pass down a system to my mom then my grandmother and I would get her old box so I could set up a storage server and get to my Terabyte of storage that I want to get too. I think I can do it. Well of to read this review of a new SFF and see if it fits. I will go to a better one after a year or two (I think I want to go to a Dual Opteron SFF that is coming out, but only if it has PCI Express for the new cards, enough room for a RAID drive, I can live with the extra storage out on the network...so I have a lot of plans). Off to read... Will update later. Peace

 I have been reading around a bit and I was right many people have started writing about the whole idea of postponing or canceling the election on Nov.2 and how bad an idea it is. Unfortunately my brief rant pales in comparison. My was a little more anger filled and fact light, but I did get the way it would happen right. President Bush is the only one who can declare a State of Emergency, once he does that FEMA becomes the default government which basically cancels out all of the rest of it. FEMA runs the nation and ultimately at the head of FEMA is the president. They literally take over everything including your own car and property. Everything falls under them and then they declare martial law to basically enforce it all. This swing essentially is for six months if the President chooses so and the congress can not take up the State of Emergency issue for at least 6 months. Now in this article that I am going to give the link to gives all the solid code and law behind it showing that it is indeed a real problem that I would expect Bush and crew would seriously consider doing to remain in power. The reason that he could and would is because he has seriously made 9/11 into a political weapon. Basically if there is a threat, a real one (and I happen to believe that there is the good possibility that something may happen) and the Administration didn't do anything they would be knocked for it. Also if the Democrats raise to much of a stink and essentially make it politically impossible for him to do it and an attack did happen the Democratic Party would literally crumble because they will be portrayed as having let it happen which the Republicans would say "we could have stopped this if the president had the power" kind of argument. However if it is allowed to happen because we are in fear then the terrorists have won and we might as well stop being us. Plus all of the worst things that have been happening under this administration will come on full bore and you just know that is dangerous for all of us. Well I will not longer bore you with my paltry words. I know turn you over to William Rivers Pitt and "Only Cowards Cancel Elections". Very well written and how if puts it is poetic. Peace

 This was a letter that I sent to my CysticL support group and I thought I would post it on my blog for tonight. --------------------------------------------------------That is an absolutely astute observation that doesn't just apply to our little group but that should apply to our day to day routine. I think that there has been a large attack on intellectualism in this country and around the world...but especially here in the United States and I have been able to see it in just my short life. What does this nation hold up as that standard bearers of "wealth" or good living. They hold up sports hero's, models, actors, and all sorts of people that aren't always the brightest bulbs on the trees. We see every night on our evening local new the scores for all the local football, basketball, baseball (not even always girls mostly just guys) scores and who did better. You have MVP's and others. You may see once a year the spelling bee national conference, and then maybe one or two local stories of those kids who do exceptionally well in their class. It continues on to college in a big way. How many dollars does the university give to have English or History full scholarships. Now look over at the sport department and you will see that many if not all students there have some sort of scholarship and many of those scholarships are full tuition scholarships. Now many people say that sports programs bring in lucrative contracts to the universities that infuse millions into them. The problem is the money almost always goes without fail to the sports programs for stadiums and many other things. All of the endorsement deals put shoes on their feet, uniforms on their backs, and helmets on their heads. The TV deals go to support scholarships and great TV studios (that rarely if you have AV tracks at your university get to use those facilities and often find themselves using older equipment). So all of the money that the University derives from the sports program goes right back into it and then the University still has a budget for them that grows each year, meanwhile they cut science funding, or they decided to put off a computer lab upgrade for a year. During all of this the students tuitions are going up. Now how does this fall into the placating and dumbing down of kids. Well used to we would get our education at schools and university level but now you can't expect to get it unless you fight for it. We hold these people up as hero's, we hold up the all mighty dollar as the absolute measurement of success and happiness. Unfortunately that puts most of the world at a disadvantage. There is simply not enough for us all to be multi millionaires. In doing that...or rather in figuring that out both political parties have joined together or rather an entire class, the rich, have loosely banded together to keep the rest of us placated and hungry enough to work hard for the possibility to move up, but only let a few people through so you keep the illusion that everyone will do well. I watch it all the time. When you look at trying to engage in debate with a person outside of your socioeconomic class you are automatically called a class warrior, and your argument may have nothing to go with class outside of that there is a definite class system right or wrong. You want to debate what is good for our nation, you not a patriot if you don't tow the President (dictators) line. Without question, yet our forefathers were great fans of debate. They would make it a sport almost. A speech that would be given back in that day would be several hours long and it would engage the audience at hand. People would fire questions at the candidates and then the candidates would actually answer the questions directly. An interesting thing. Politics is verbal war. Many people have forgotten that politics is the practice of democracy, and politicians and the powerful people behind the scenes don't like for ordinary stiffs to be involved. So well. I tell people be irreverent towards power. The powerful only derive power if you give it to them. I don't say be reckless. I don't say become an anarchist, but I do say become educated on something you like or an aspect of life you love because you can be an activist for anything. For CF'ers the best place to be an activist may actually be in health care and politics. We know what is going on and we have to deal with the system so might as well become good at it. Whatever you do enjoy it...and it also means that you have to learn how to debate. Learn to play devils advocate on issues you might deplore. The reason is because you will be able to argue a better case against your foes. I did that for a while on abortion rights. I am pro-choice in my legal standing and pro-life in my personal standing. It is not a weak position. I can comfortably tell people that I think it is horrible and they are destroying some sort of life, but I would not presume to attach my morals or ethics to anyone much less force them on someone. The law should be to allow safe reasonable abortions that follow good sound medical (not right wing partial birth and ugly term that doesnt even apply terms) terms and procedures. So let people choose. Do whatever you have to in helping clear your own conscience if it bothers you. Go down to health services and just engage, not nastily (remember you always catch more flies with honey) and talk to some of them. You may save a few, but chances are none. Remember that if you are the religious type then you should know that those people will have to answer for their own decisions, not you. If you are pro-life, take the pro-choice side a couple of times and be open to it. Really research it and see that some of these people fighting for that right are fighting for some basic women's rights of having choice over there own bodies. It is hard but anyone with reasonable intelligence can do it. That is how I became pro-choice...and I also became that way while I was in my really religious phase because I kept on reading that god gives choices to all his creatures and we can choose to go his way or another way, but either way he loves ya. Anyways...I tell people to question things and be ready to argue. It helps out. Drag your families into these discussions. I was always taught to listen twice as much as you talk (makes you look smart in front of strangers, but also you have two ear and one mouth so you should listen twice as much as you talk) but when at home keep on engaging people. If they won't, just keep on and keep on. Well that is all I am going to get some sleep... Peace ------------------------------------------------------------- Hope ya'll like it. Tonight I started on the BYPAP machine. It is this device that kinda breaths for you...no tube and not invasive. It is a big ass mask that just has positive pressure on it and blows in when you inhale and draws air out when you exhale. I had it on last night and it brought me back quick like...so tonightI am giving it s shot again to see if tomorrow is even better. Gnight'

 Well here is my "oh shit oh shit" update for the day. Last night I coded...again. I am not to sure of the events as usual but I remember flushing my IV because it was done and getting a head rush, I think I pushed for help, and I think I remember calling out for help...I think. Last night Lori was looking after me and I know she was right in there helping me out...I'm sorry Lori I didn't mean to do that...I dunno what happened. Maybe I can get clued in. I woke up kinda down here in the unit...again. They were taking a blood gas and I remember telling the guy it would be easier to get it out of my left side. They tried to get it a couple more times...anyway I have six holes that would be blood gas sticks. It is all very odd. We will get to the bottoms of it sooner or later. Peace And no I am not dead yet...

 There was something else that I wanted to comment on but I just forgot about it. Bush has turned down the NAACP for the fourth year to come and speak at their national convention. He stated the reason he has turned down the invitation is because of "what those people have said about me"...umm so he is not going to give a speech because some of the NAACP top officials have been critical about the administrations handling of affirmative action legislation. It is just a stupid thing. Bush is nothing but a racist pig. Every time they have to change Air Force one out and get one of the older birds to fly because of mechanical problems (seems to be a lot of "mechanical problems" throughout this administration) on the main Boeing 747 that jets him around the report is always "the president was not in any kind of danger"...all I do is snap my fingers, nod, and say well damn. It would be fitting if he went to Iraq on one of his secret fly ins and for the bird to be downed by RPG fire...I would cheer all day long. Bush is a piece of shit and we will be better off without him. The more it goes on and the more often I have to see him, Cheney, Ashcroft, Rumsfeld, Ridge, or any of that bunch of Nazis make me more and more angry and hoping and wishing that something will happen to knock all of them off at once...cut the entire head off of the republican party (don't forget Tom "show me the money" DeLay...he needs to be picked off as well). Pieces of shit! Peace

 I feel a bit better today and at least I didn't wake up completely short of breath, I hope it lasts through the day. There has been more coverage of the possibility of election postponement. I hope I run across some op-ed pieces on it. As I do I will link them for you all. Peace

 I have more links about this whole delaying the vote thing. Commondreams.org Coverage Truthout.org Coverage MSNBC.com Coverage Now these links are all based off of the same Newsweek Story and Reuters coverage. In each of the articles you will find links to those various sources as well. It is all very scary. As I got the info up, many others were getting their info up. Most people simply got the story and reprinted it, so far I have yet to run across any opinions outside of my own. I had a link to the story but I also shared my thoughts about it all and my fears. I am sure that over the next couple of days we will see more opinion pieces about it, but so far I am one of the first people to get an opinion up. Health matters: Today has been a shitty shitty day. All day I have been cycling between not so bad periods where I could breath easily to stretches where I couldn't catch my breath at all. There was not rhym or reason to it all and that tends to be very frustrating. It is also painful as well. The pain that you experience is very different from other pain. I really don't know how to explain it. Maybe if you were to take a deep breath and then swim from one side of a large pool to the other underwater without coming up for a breath and then turning around and getting half way back. When you come up and you at first are huffing for air, well take that first two huffs and puffs and extend that out for ten or twenty minutes. You have all the same muscle pain because you entire body can't get the carbon dioxide out so it is sitting in there giving you horrible pain. Well it is something like that. Oh yeah don't forget the headache that comes with it. It sears through you and it hurts horribly. When it gets that bad there isn't much I can do but keep breathing. It hurts horribly but you do it. I have found that if I get a shot of pain meds and benadryl it calms me down real fast and I stop hyperventilating. That is probably the worst part of it is the hyperventilating. I just hope we can figure out why it is happening so maybe we can keep it from happening more. Well I am tired and I do need some sleep. Peace

 Hi kids...and welcome to the new Fascist States of America, where a constitution and bill of rights watched over our land to keep us safe from the tyranny of evil men. These beacons of civilization held on high as if they were the documents of some radical religion, guarded zealously with the blood of millions of people from our own nation and protected from the blood of the tens of millions who dare challenge this most basic document set. I despair that today may have been the warning shot, an alert, to the new norms in our once proud nation. Today it has been found out that the Bush Administration has started to look at if a terrorist event were to happen before the November Election (or maybe even if it happens after the election up to the installment of the President on Jan. 20, 2005) whether or not it would be legal to declare a state of emergency and post pone the election for a set period of time or whether they could suspend the election for an unknown period of time. There is precedence of this happening and it was relatively recent too. In World War 2 President Roosevelt was retained as President because he was already up to speed on the issues and the war and to replace him would be difficult at best, so they kept him for a third term until he died and Truman took over. The idea is that Roosevelt could have remained president as long as the war was on simply because of the logistical problems of getting a new guy up to speed. That is the precedent. Today we have already had our "leader" say that this war will be a long one and a very dangerous struggle and that shifting courses mid-stream could be devastating for the nation so we should vote him in (that is his thinking at least). You could say that well why wasn't it done in the Vietnam era, and there is a simple answer to that, the Vietnamese posed zero threat to the USA, they could not pull of any type of attack he on the homefront. If the Soviets had invaded then surely elections would have been postponed. Some people will argue, and it is a valid argument (if your an idiot), that Bush would be doing it for the best of the nation and a vote would be held swiftly. The action would be a terrorist strike here, perhaps NYC or Washington, maybe LA, Bush would declare a state of emergency and martial law. All of the government would switch into a protective or secure mode which means the government becomes airtight and we cannot elect in new officials, actually it could give Bush even greater power to appoint more of his people to positions of national importance. Since the action happened during the "War on Terror" it would enforce the idea that our nation is in a state of war and give him the imperative to keep us from voting. Under a state of emergency and martial law all civil rights are removed and you have to listen to the government or you can be jailed or killed. What about the courts. Well that beloved Supreme Court of ours is already leaning right and we have several judges that are on the verge of retirement. If the state of emergency was still in effect at that point Bush could and would install whomever he wanted to the vacated seat/s thereby tipping the court over to radical right. Also if the people were to bring suit to try and get voting reinstated the courts are nearly powerless to do anything. So if you managed to get a case heard it wouldn't likely go far. This is scary. I talked about this over a year ago as it was something that I was frightened he would do. Scary scary scary stuff. So welcome to the new Fascists States of America. Ummm :-/ Linky Links CNN's Coverage Remember they are asking the Justice department, the very same group of crack lawyers who said torture is legal! and the Geneva convention was "Quaint". Somebody help us.

 Yes I do have a lot to say about the whole Sandy Berger thing...there is a lot more to it than meets the eye. Peace

 Today has been another crap day but I have gotten a few more things in order. My grandmosther wants me to get antourh place. Partly because I am after all 27 and I should be out of the house by now. So I guess I will have to start thinking about that. As for the Averatec I think that I am laying the groundwork for one and possibly another. One ultra-portable (my current system), another micro system with MS XP Tablet Edition (a kick ass spec'ed convertable Tablet PC...having one of those would just be fun). The third is the desktop replacement system. It has 3.0Ghz P4 HT Enabled, ATi 9600 64MB RAM, 512MB RAM, 60-80GB of HD Space, DVD+-R/RW/CD-R/RW combo drive. It seems that Averatec has decided to enter each of the mainstream markets, ultra-portable with the 3200 Series that I have (AMD XP-M 2000+, 256MB RAM, 40GB HD, S3 Omnichrome Graphics, DVD/CD-R/RW, 802.11G, and much more for a grand), the afformentioned 6100 Series for Desktop Replacement, and now the 3500 Series for TabletPC's based on a AMD XP-M 2200+, 512MB RAM, 80GB HD, DVD/CD-R/RW drive, 802.11G, and other goodies... They seem to want to offer products for any occassion. Well I am tired and tired and tired...so g'night. Peace

 I must update...I must update...I must update. Hey I am reminding myself to update...and soon!!! So here it goes. I found out what the specs&nbsp;are in&nbsp;the New Averatec C3500 TabletPC Model. AMD Athlon XP-M 2200+ (1.7Ghz) 512MB RAM up to 1GB 60-80 GB HD DVD/CD-R/RW drive Full keyboard (covertable style) 12.1 Inch Screen 4 USB 2.0 Ports 802.11G Microsoft Windows Tablet PC Edition Up to 4 and 1/2 hours on a charge. Very decent specs...and it will start at $1350...so a kick ass deal! With the one I have and if it is any indication that these little units are good (and so far this one is kick ass) then I think Averatec just helped make TabletPC a viable alternative for students finally. If a product would have been available when I first headed off to class for that price I would have jumped all over it. I am going to jump on this one as soon as I can because it is just kick ass. Averatec is also looking into doing a Centrino Laptop with high end graphics (NVidia 5700U Mobile or ATi 9700 Mobile both with 128MB RAM, a mid range Dothan Processor, all crammed into a small laptop like I have...or in a more traditional 15.4" setup. They need to do a compact with HDTV setings 16*9.&nbsp; That way there will be no wasted pixels for playing movies on these little machines.) I will say something about the performance of this little beast. It runs warm...you can tell. It isn't super hot but could burn you if you are not careful. The battery life that I see is generally a little better than what is usually reviewed. I get around 3.5 hours of medium use with a Cell Phone attached drawing power for internet service. The keyboard is fairly responsive although a little cramped. I like the click feel for them indeed. It has an annoying clunk that comes from the HD from time to time...it is the thermocoupling fluid that is re-adjusting...or whatever it is called. Well I passed out for a about half an hour and it is getting close to the next set of drugs...so I am going to zoink out some more. Love to all...and hopefully&nbsp;a handy addition to my Laptop stable...and then after tablet from Averatec...possibly a gamer from Averated Desktop P4 @ 3.0 HT Enabled, 512MB RAM, 15.4" screen, 60-80GB HD, DVD-+R/RW/CD+RW, ATi 9600 64MB RAM, and some other bits...unless they get the Dothan System out....at and at that price point with higher graphics Ati 9700 128MB or Nvidia 5700U 128MB....if I knew for sure they were going to do that then I would go save for that and get it when it hits because it will be a hot portable, gaming ready. and just overall goodness. Peace Let me drop this old RAVER saying on ya'll. P.L.U.R. (Peace, Love, Unity, Respect)...if we all showed it and praticed it daily the world would be a better place...a lot more polite at the very least. Blaaaaa

 Today I had the most horrific experience that I think a person can have...well maybe not the worst but it damn well ranks up there. &nbsp; I went down to the GI lab today to have my PEG tube placed a little further down in the GI tract...well out of the stomach and into my intestines. Now to do this they have to scope you and look down there to guide things. Now to do this generally they put you into Twilight sleep which is not fully out but not awake, and certainly not aware. &nbsp; Well I already had a bad experience with the one asshole, now I have another bad experience. This is the doc (dick) that came to look at my tube over the weekend. It has been leaking since I got the damn thing...or rather stomach contents have been leaking out from the incision where all the mess goes into the belly. &nbsp; Well we decided to put the tube a little deeper out of the stomach into the intestines to do two things. First to get the food from the tube into the intestines hopefully bypassing the "full" stomach trigger so I can eat and tube at the same time so that I can get full nourishment. Second I can tube feed for a few days to let the incision heal up properly and hopefully keep the food in my stomach from dribbling out around the incision. &nbsp; Well to do all this they have to twilight and tube you...well we got part of it right. &nbsp; I got down there with this asshole who worked on me today and he knew that I was nervous and I told him to make sure that I was pretty much out and all would go well. I also had told him I have higher tolerances to most narcotics and other drugs...which I do. &nbsp; Well I was wheeled into the little procedure room and he started to give me the sedative. Starts with 100 of Fentinol...well it comes in these carpi-jet tube things that you have to crack and setup...well if you do it right all the med makes it into the IV...if you do it like he does it 50% of it ends up on the patient and the other makes it into the IV...so for 100 units he only got in maybe 50 at best...so I was underdrugged. He was in a hurry and not paying attention. &nbsp; At some point I wake up during all of this...now it might have been when he yanked my old tube out and I started screaming bloody murder...because it hurt. I remember them tubing me...and I couldn't breath and had a coughing fit plus a panic attack...the manhandled me...or rather he did...it was just a big fucking mess and I remember balling because it hurt so bad. When I came a little more too in the recovery area I was already sobbing because it hurt so bad so I woke up or came too crying. I don't cry from pain often...but when I do it is because something really hurts. &nbsp; While I was down there I was wiped out and when one of the nurses came over to me I said to her "did what I think happened really happen to me?", she told me "if you ever come back down here make sure you only have Weinberg or Dubner, never the other two." I had two other nurses down there tell me the same thing. Basically I woke up in the middle of the procedure and instead of stopping or getting the situation under control before continuing he just plowed ahead and basically beat me up. &nbsp; When I got back to my room my mom was here and she asked me what happened because I was bruised and beaten looking. I was beaten up pretty bad. I recovered quickly and I am sore and swollen but I am not to much worse for wear except that I cannot believe that is the second doctor from this service that I have had that have caused me harm. There is no reason for all of this. The only thing that can be on this one was that I was the last patient (which I was) and he was in a hurry...plus he had someone observing. So he might have been showing off and in a rush. Hey...slow down and do it right. &nbsp; So when I see my Doc tomorrow I am going to bring it up because I don't want others to go through that. &nbsp; I try not to complaign to much about things because I don't want to be a whiney bitch about things. Unfortunately this time I am going to have to be a whiney bitch. &nbsp; Well I have some drugs coming to me now so I am going to do them...veg. and hopefully enter tomorrow with the hopes that it will be better. &nbsp; Peace

 I am sitting here watching "Secret Window". One of the respiratory care people brought it in for me to see. That is probably the biggest saving grace of all this mess is that the people here make me feel as part of their extended family and help as much as they can. They constantly offer to bring me food or movies, always asking if there is anything they can run and get for me. It makes me feel good that at least I am doing something right somewhere. &nbsp; Of coarse I rarely take them up on the offers because I don't want to put them out, although I know that it wouldn't be a bother for them at really. The thing that I do take people up on is the movie thing. If people have a DVD that I haven't seen and they offer I always take them up on it because I love watching movies. I will say that there is one disadvantage to this laptop and the smaller screen size. It is harder to watch a movie and do other things on it at the same time. It can be done and I am doing it now but it is cramped. The other thing that I really need to do is to get this thing upgraded to 512MB of RAM. The 256 works well but the graphics subsystem does pull from the main memory of the unit. So right now with 256MB of RAM installed I pull 16MB for the Graphics system and that leaves me with 240MB of RAM available for program use. It is an odd number and some programs that I would love to use have to have at least 256MB. The biggest problem with being short of RAM is that the hard disk spins more and the computer just has to work harder. So 512MB of RAM is in the near future. I also have to save for the Averatec Tablet PC...that looks like it will be a good system. I still have yet to find out the specs for sure on it but for 1300 bucks you cannot go wrong at all. Pretty soon I may be sitting here writing my blog entries and watching a DVD on this machine. If I do get the Tablet PC then I will not upgrade this one...I will instead make sure the Tablet PC is maxed out with RAM as it would be more usefull there. &nbsp; Oh so much to see and do...plus I would love to build a new desktop just to build one. &nbsp; I would use the majority of the components that I already have like the high end P4 running over 3Ghz, 1024MB DDR500 RAM, 120GB SATA HD, 60GB PATA HD, good video card, DVD Burners (I have two...w00t! but I want to move to a Dual Layer DVD+-R/RW and I can do that for 90 bucks), WiFi 802.11G card. I would roll all those into a newer system maybe based off of the Aria case and a Micro-ATX motherboard. I would love to add a HDTV tuner card from ATi, a much better sound card (perhaps a high end SoundBlaster Audigy2). &nbsp; I would love to add 2*74GB Western Digital Raptor 10,000RPM in a RAID0 Array and that would be hella fast, plus the 120GB SATA as a backup drive for videos and music. I do have my eye on a system from Shuttle, it is a new one that has the new P4 packaging, new chipset, and it will accommodate 3HD's, one optical drive, PCI Express graphics and a HDTV card. However that would mean I would have to get the two HD's, new Proc. (at a slower speed than what I have now because to get where I am now in Proc under the new packaging would be expensive, plus I would have to get an ATi X800 video card for the PCIe...that is major moola...that is why I am leaning towards the Aria case, and a Micro-ATX motherboard, and just add bits as I need them. Down the road I could use the case and upgrade to a board with the newer features and such.) &nbsp; That is all off in dream land of what I want to do...if I did all that&nbsp;I would love to save and get a big LCD flat panel (like around 30inches HDTV) so I could compute and work on it but it would be good for TV here in the hospital and watching movies...not to mention kick ass gaming. I would love to do all that because once I get through all this shit I could use it in an apartment and have a hell of a setup. &nbsp; I have so much I want to do...and I need to get moola to get there. Its just a lot of dreaming right now. However I will get somehow, somehow the Tablet PC...that would just be cool as hell...also Averatec offers a good mainstream PC 15.4 widescreen, P4 3.0Ghz (Hyperthreading enabled), 512MB RAM, 60GB HD, DVD+-R/RW drive, ATi 9600 Mobility 64MB RAM...Basically a good solid portable gaming machine. That one costs about 1300 as well. So if I could I would get two new laptops, the gaming edition and the TabletPC one...if I did that I would ignore altogether the desktop system with maybe a tansplant of cases to something a little more roomy with a better MOBO room for my DVD Burners, lots of HDs...and have it on a network so that I can use it as storage and brawn setup or something...I dunno I am rambling...really really rambling. &nbsp; This is a shit post I am sorry. I am bored...so much I want to do but not the energy or seemingly at the moment the mental acuity to do anything... &nbsp; BLAH!!!

 Today has been just a crap day and that is all I want to say about it. &nbsp; I hope I can have some nice days where I feel good and have the energy to feel good. &nbsp; That is all...I sat there for a few minutes to see if anything would come to me and low and behold not a damn thing did. &nbsp; Shit.... &nbsp;
