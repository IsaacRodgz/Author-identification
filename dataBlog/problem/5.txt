 DESIGN FLAW I'm not sure, but I think this simple page design is confusing some people. When I feel like it, the picture at the left changes, but the secret is I'm only giving a glimpse. You can always click the graphic to get the urlLink big picture .

 BEHIND ENEMY FIREWALL - HOURS 4,5 About an hour ago, I was liberated. AIM is back.

 BEHIND ENEMY FIREWALL - HOUR 3 Well I found out the problem. They're updating the firewall software in the server and apparently they're just retarded and can't do it right. I'm actually using another divisions server to post this. Apes. AIM use is getting more doubtful as the day wears on.

 FROM SIGUR ROS TO BLACK CROWES Yeah, that's pretty much one hell of a musical spectrum. I figured since my page was down when I went (with urlLink Jeff to see urlLink Sigur Ros , I'd talk about them now. They played at the urlLink Vic Theater two weeks ago. It was a fantastic little concert, very chill, very cozy. I love concerts at small venues. Anyway, Ros was really good and to my surprise they rocked out on a ton of songs I've never heard (no, I'm not a diehard fan, I just enjoy their music). It's probably the first and last concert I'll ever go to where I didn't understand a damn word, yet thoroughly enjoyed myself. As Alison mentioned, they were sans the 18 piece string section but they managed. It was just a great little band and a great little venue. If they roll through near you, I recommend checking them out. Last Saturday night, the 6th, urlLink Connie had scored us tickets to urlLink The Black Crowes . The concert was in Rockford at the Metro Center (we buzzed right over urlLink Rochelle ). We initially had some problems finding the place because neither of us had ever been there and all the signs in the town lied. Anyway, we get there about 7:15pm and park right across the street from the place with nothing but tour buses in our way...sweet. Already we're thinking things are a little off about this, how did we get so close? Where is everyone? So we head into the Metro Center and look for the "Will Call" booth to get the tickets. The "booth" turned out to be two middle-age women at a card table with a HUGE illuminated white sign behind them declaring them "WILL CALL." They looked more like a church bake sale than a ticket pick-up office. About 7:30pm we head for our seats. Connie had thought that our seats were good but no great when she was purchasing them, she figured we'd be off in a corner. Well to our surprise, we were 4 rows from the stage, SPECTAC! As we looked around though, the house was still empty, maybe 10% of the people were there. About 8pm, the opening band entered, urlLink Beachwood Sparks . They were funny guys. They told the 20 of us watching to "Please stand back and not crowd the front." There was no one up there. They were actually the best opening band I've ever heard, their music was lighter than the Crowes with some country flavor to it. Good stuff. Plus the few people in the crowd did cheer for them when they finished songs, they were well received. Poor guys though, near the end of their set, pieces of equipment were slowly falling from the rafters and the set decorum. They laughed out loud and continued to play. They were good guys, I bought their CD. After their set, they even signed CDs and tickets for people. When they were finished, the Crowes came out. The crowd was just beginning to arrive and being a pain in the ass to those of us already seated. Con and I were right on an isle so every time a late ape came, we had to shuffle out. Now me personally, I enjoy the Black Crowes. I like the Southern Rock feel of Lynyrd Skynard that they have. I admittedly own only urlLink Shake Your Money Maker , their first album. Connie on the other hand, LOVES the Black Crowes. Every word, every song, hooting and hollering. It was really fun. The Crowes are an AWESOME band to see live, the music is great and they convey this energy that makes you want to dance. I did the "white man tap and sway" dance. And as urlLink Rehmer had also noticed, there was a urlLink MRS. Robinson hiding deep off the side of the stage. A few times when the stage lit up, you could make out a heavy set of blonde curls. OH! And before I forget, there was the encore! The Crowes played Oh Well and they were accompanied by Rick Nielsen from CHEAP TRICK! YEAH! It was a fun night. Wednesday night I'm off to see urlLink Travis .

 BEHIND ENEMY FIREWALL - HOUR 2 Help me.

 PROXIES I've been trying to sign on to AIM for an hour now but I'm stuck behind enemy firewalls. If I can't have my AIM, there's gonna be HELL to pay.

 88 WEST I'll be in the urlLink corn this weekend. Back Sunday with new pic.

 FREE Heading home baby, wear something sexy...

 PLAY IT NOW Okay, so I'm STILL at work and I have "Cracklin' Rosie" by Neil Diamond, spinning on heavy repeat in my head.

 EXCUSE ME... (cough) urlLink Kyle's urlLink site (cough)

 BOYS AND THEIR TOYS My dad drives a urlLink Chrysler Sebring .

 STEVE BUSCEMI, HERO I'm pretty sad that we haven't heard more about what I'm going to report. I was talking to urlLink Connie last night and she mentioned that urlLink People Magazine had done a story about the celebrities who were helping down at the World Trade Center "Ground Zero." It was reported that urlLink Steve Buscemi (known as "Mr. Pink" in urlLink Resevoir Dogs or "Donny" from urlLink The Big Lebowski ) was seen out among the rubble and declined all media attention. Steve was out at ground zero helping firefighters sixty hours. Back in 1980, Steve was a member of the Manhattan Engine Company and left in 1985. Connie said Steve was quoted as saying, "I'm out here looking for my brothers." The only article I could find online about this was in urlLink German (I think that's German) but you get the idea. If I find an article in English, I'll post it. Buscemi put his life on the line to rescue people that he shared a life style with, that he shared a badge with. Steve was down in there doing what he could. My hat goes of to you Mr. Buscemi.

 SHORT ROUND I'm currently enrolled in an "Intro to Archaeology" class at my local community college. Of course, on many occasions, my teacher has stated that "sometimes it can get a little urlLink Indiana Jones " or "I've been in situations where urlLink Tomb Raider is very real." Well for some reason today she kept going on about urlLink Indiana Jones and how the adventure often finds you. Yet while she was talking, a small voice in the back of my mind kept repeating, "Release the DVD, you urlLink jerk . Release the DVD, you urlLink jerk ." I would LOVE to have that set on DVD right now, including the often looked down upon, " urlLink Temple of Doom ." But I guess this is what happens when your urlLink friend/colleague/partner pulls the same crap with his film catalogue. Their combined power sickens me. It must be nice to know that by releasing the entire "Indiana Jones" trilogy as well as the "Star Wars" trilogy, you could single handedly destroy the entire VHS empire, much like Michael Jackson's Thriller on compact disc did to the audio cassette universe.

 YELLOW I took the picture on the left and had it developed. When I got it back there was a sticker on the photo telling me that the lighting and color were bad. I took this picture because that was actually the color of the sky that night. Click the picture on the left for the full image (modem users use caution).

 YAR Welcome urlLink back .

 GRAND RE-RE-RE-RE-REOPENING I'm back, and as all other sites under the urlLink StickBus.com empire, with much help from urlLink The Doctor . Anyway, I kept the design simple cause I'm going to try and display more photos in the box currently occupied by the best ninja turtle ever. That pic might change daily or weekly, depending on what I find. Blah, blah, back to work.

 INSOMNIA? It's almost 1:30am, I've been home for an hour, I'm editing digital photos and listening to 80's rock, more specifically, "Your Love" by Outfield. WHY CAN'T I FALL ASLEEP? So many worries...

 WHILE MY GUITAR GENTLY WEEPS There will be a lot of people doing this today, but I just wanted to say urlLink goodbye myself.

 HAPPY BIRTHDAY EMPIRE DINER! 365 days, done and gone. One year ago today, at 7:49am, the words, "Testing, testing. Is this thing on?" echoed across the internet and information super highway. Since then, people's lives have changed, the borders of countries redrawn, the earth tilts differently and the universe is just a little more askew than it was a million years ago. So a year ago, urlLink Kyle showed me this little website called urlLink Blogger . And of course, being that I need to have the same toys as all my friends, I started this, the Napkin Notes at the Empire Diner. The name itself was derived from the Billy Joel song, "The Great Wall Of China." The lyric goes, "Help yourself, it's all you can eat at the Empire Diner tonight..." Plus I have some odd obsession with old 50s and 60s diners. So now that I've said that little factoid that no one cares about, we'll move on. I copied my entire blog, every single entry into Microsoft Word (not by hand of course, I copied and pasted). In a year, I've posted roughly 87,000 words, which for some reason seems low because I talk so damn much about nothing. I went through a list of words I though I commonly used and counted them up... Biblical figures: urlLink Jesus (25), God (71, you can't link God) Choice words [parental advisory here]: urlLink Damn (82), urlLink Crap (48), urlLink Ass (228), urlLink Shi t (51), urlLink Fuck (21, wow, I'm beaming with pride about that one), urlLink Hell (41) Friends: urlLink Stick Bus (83), urlLink Kyle (244, that's sad), urlLink Bruen (108), urlLink Jeff (124), urlLink Sarah (58), urlLink Connie (104), urlLink Mark (27), urlLink Alison (21) Famous People: urlLink Al Gore (2), urlLink Ichiro (22) Places: urlLink Chicago (61), urlLink Illinois (22), urlLink Los Angeles (32), urlLink California (22), urlLink Barney's Beanery (12), urlLink Columbia College (15) And this is where I am today, one year later. Many things have changed in my life, most for the better. And trust me, the next 365 days are going to get interesting. Pretty much the last year has been other people's lives shifing around mine. This year, is my turn. I'm sure my site will fall prey to slow times and be plagued by " urlLink hiatus " graphics, but behind the scenes I'll still be at it and trying to win whatever battle comes next. Here's to the diner and the next revolution... ...We'll begin with a spin, trav'ling in the world of my creation, what we'll see will defy, explanation...

 HAPPY BIRTHDAY EMPIRE DINER! Yessir, today my very own Napkin Notes at the Empire Diner turns the big ONE year old. Oh and what fun it has been. Expect a retrospective later...

 TOYS I love my new urlLink digital camera . Here are a few urlLink pics urlLink that urlLink I've urlLink taken urlLink so urlLink far ...

 YOU KNOW IT'S A SLOW DAY WHEN: You edit all of the names for blogs in your bookmark list to read the author's name followed by the blog title in parenthesis. For example: Dave (Empire Diner). Now that's done, what do I do now?

 UPS, DON'T FAIL ME NOW! So I'm at work and I've been watching urlLink UPS Tracking all morning because I'm waiting for my new urlLink digital camera (pause to wait for my "comments" to fill up with messages about me not saving money and being in debt). Anyway, if you're REALLY bored too insert the number 1ZA41W190244708887 and see if it's there yet.

 BILLY ZANE SUCKS Yes he does, and urlLink this will help me prove that.

 JUST ONE OF THOSE ARTICLES There's really nothing I can say to even sum up the contents of this urlLink article .

 DAVE'S NEW CAR JOKE OF THE DAY "Is that a new cell phone?" "No, that's my car."

 DAVE'S NEW CAR JOKE OF THE DAY "Sure it gets good gas mileage, but every ten miles you have to stop and empty the mulch bag." ...and there'll be more...

 BIG DUMB MALE So I went outside to get the mail. I saw I received the new urlLink Rolling Stone . When I revealed the cover, I blurted out to the neighbors and kids outside... "HOLY CRAP."

 THE HUMPTY DUMPTY LOVE SONG I had a premonition A movie in my mind Confirming my suspicions about what I would fine You followed me to LA, down to Mexico Came in through the back door At the start of the show

 WE CAME, WE SAW, WE DROVE OVER A LOT OF SHIT In February of 1999, I ventured out with my parents on one cold and snowing winter weekend in search of a car. Little did I know, I would be leaving there with a truck and what would later be a reliable friend. My original intent was to become one of the many who drive in the Pontiac Grand Am family. I had liked the cars and they were somewhat affordable. At the time, I was working 40 hours a week at a real job and I was pretty sure that was not going to change (later I would high-tail it and return to school). So I test drove a $23,000 Mercury Mountaineer, V8 engine, leather interior, 6 CD changer, sunroof, the works. I would later sign the papers to make her legally mine. In the years to come, her mighty chariot wheels would take me to Bloomington, Illinois where she makes and appearance in the urlLink Stick Bus film, The Blairwich Project (that trip would also bring another infamous incident where she was vomited on, I was not told of this until TWO YEARS LATER). She drove me as far north as Kenosha, Wisconsin to happy memories of batting cages. From Lake Michigan in the east, and the campus of Augustana in the west (she carried Gordons in on angelic winds). Finally there were the countless trips into the cornfields of DeKalb, she would fly me where I needed to go. Sadly though, it was these trips, especially the ones to DeKalb, which would cause us to part ways far earlier than I had ever hoped. It was only a matter of time until she rocketed through the 75,000 mile marker, also bringing an end to her faithful warranty. Through the years, she had minor problems internally. Some electrical work here, some unexplained corrosion there, and once she blew out her subwoofer while singing along to Dr. Dre's, urlLink The Chronic 2001 . It was the combination of these that made my parental units weary of her strength and feared that she may not remain reliable. So on Tuesday night, November 13th, I gave her away in exchange for what can only be called a go-kart. I can only stare out my window at night, hoping that someone else will find her and love her like I did. Wax her and wash her, kiss her visor when she made it through the yellows, and yell, "THAT WAS F**KING AWESOME!" as she smashes into high standing water along the roadsides. Perhaps one day, when the world slows down and the stars are seen from the west coast, we'll meet again. Goodbye dear friend, and here's to you, your legend, and your glory. May your wheels carry you far and your heart remain strong. Farewell. Big Maroon Machine 1999 - 2001

 THE WAKE In ten minutes, I'm losing a good friend forever. There will be an epitaph later.

 NEXT REST STOP 1,745 MILES Yesterday, after a long and heated discussion (again) with urlLink Kyle , I finally put into writing the major events that I need to make happen in the next year. I know most of you reading this could care less, I'm doing this more for my own benefit. Due to bad credit card abuse, I'm cutting three of my four cards tonight. This also includes deleting all the stored credit card numbers I have stored in various online companies. Tonight I'm buying a new/used car that will be covered under a warranty with low mileage. Of course this means it isn't a car I like, but getting one I do like isn't a choice I have. I LOVE my Mountaineer and now I'm going from a V-8 roaring machine to a 4-cylinder foreign lawnmower. Goody. Anyway, somewhere along the line the new car is going to be beneficial and I could save a little cash from it. I'm buying this new car today and I just have to deal with it (regardless of the damage it may do to my ego and image). I am going to finish my schooling at CLC. After this semester, I will have 51 credit hours, 60 are needed for an associates degree. With help from urlLink Connie , I already know what classes I need to take to earn my associates degree. The degree WILL be received in June of 2002. Once I have that minor degree, I can transfer to almost any college I want and the degree ensures 60 credit hours, the college I would transfer to cannot reject any of those hours. At the same time, because I will be able to arrange my classes better, less time at school will be needed, therefore I will be able to work more than 19 hours a week. This will greatly benefit my checking account. With the money I will have theoretically saved, I will arrange some form of transportation to the Los Angeles, California area. The next step will be either finding a cheap hotel or begging Kyle and urlLink Sarah (and baby) for stays lasting about a week, sporadically throughout the summer. While there, I will find a place to live and apply for many jobs, both in and out of the entertainment industry. In August of 2002, pending the results of number 4, I will be moving to Los Angeles with home and job waiting. Once living in Los Angeles, the search for work and income will take priority over education. In December 2002, if need be or I feel it is necessary, I will apply to colleges in California. With my associates degree, I can apply to any California college without fear of losing credit hours. I live happily ever after on the west coast. Events taking place in this time will include scooters, tattoos, parties, marriage, kids, conquering the world, retirement, parties, walkers, death. And of course it's all going to be much more complicated than all that, but that's the basic plan. There are probably more places and people I should mention in there, but I'm keeping it simple. Ive always lacked a plan, this was pointed out as my downfall. I need dates to reach my goals, and steps to follow. In a way, I now have that. I guess I'll see you there.

 FU&#183;RI&#183;OUS adj. Full of or characterized by extreme anger; raging. Suggestive of extreme anger in action or appearance; fierce. See Synonyms at angry . Full of activity; energetic or rapid: the furious pace of the trading floor.

 EEE-CHE-ROW urlLink Konichiwa I don't know what that means.

 NOW, I'M WEEPING I just saw the second urlLink Episode 2 teaser.

 BLING-BLING-BLING-BLING-BLING

 WONDERFUL TICKETMASTER I recieved an e-mail from Ticketmaster this afternoon, the subject was, "RATT & more cool events happening near you!" I was amazed to see "RATT" and "cool events" in the same sentence.

 ANY FRIEND OF CONNIE'S IS A FRIEND OF MINE Stick Bus : so what exactly do you need my lady for again this weekend? Silki125 : becasue I miss her Stick Bus : oh...but you don't miss me? Silki125 : no not at all actually. Silki125 signed off at 1:20:21 PM . Isn't that sweet?

 BOOM If the feeling that I'm trapped here forever isn't bad enough...I've suddenly become very concious to how fat I am.

 OUT/IN so go out and make strong your stance you were the best of them just breathe out and in hold me again cause then you're off to them like the rest of them you're gone

 FRUSTRATION AND THE BIG MAROON MACHINE Last night, my dad and I drove an hour and a half to Rockford to look into buying a new urlLink car . Well...it was a DISMAL failure. The dealer was a nice guy and all, but I've pretty much screwed myself with the Big Maroon Machine. I still owe $10,535.80 on the Mountaineer, but the dealership was only able to give me $7500 on the trade in. So the $3000 difference would be added to the $20,000 price tag on the new car. Plus, I have no down payment (well, I do, but $100 isn't going to do much). After some calculations, the dealer said I'd be paying about $460 a month (that's IMPOSSIBLE when you work 18hrs. a week) and the dealer suggested that I try to sell the car myself and aim for $10,000. That killed me. Like someone kicked me in the face. It wasn't his fault so I wasn't mad at him, I was mad at the situation I've now been put in. And of course, now this morning, the Big Maroon Machine had a REALLY hard time starting up. Great. With all this, I'm frustrated, I'm pissed off and just confused. I was really hoping just to do this and move on. And I know urlLink Connie will be mad that I'm going to say this again, but if I had done what I was supposed to do (go to school) and finish when I was supposed to, then I might have had a full time job by now and been able to afford that. Ugh. Now I just have to try and not be a spoiled little kid and probably sacrifice my pride for "something that just gets me from A to B." Damnit.

 ROADS? Acapriccio : new car = awesome Stick Bus : yeah? you floorin' it? Acapriccio : yeah. i also have working brakes! Acapriccio : i'm so excited Acapriccio : and the keyless entry thing is OOC Acapriccio : and the remote trunk pop thing Acapriccio : i can't stop doing it Stick Bus : welcome to the 21st century. Stick Bus : i really don't know what i'd do without keyless entry though. Stick Bus : putting a key in a door is so 1980's. Acapriccio : my prob is that i keep hitting the alarm button in my pocket Stick Bus : with your big dick? Acapriccio : yep

 OVERPASS crawling home the street lamps dotted the black sky they lined the night like a flipped runway around me the ghosts were driving red cadillacs and the big memories were riding little scooters the traffic was packed on the off-ramps the trailer trucks crowded the shoulders my suspension rode easy across the gaps in the pavement the speed grabbed at my antenna unhappiness fought inside my engine under the roar were the whispers of pistons firing up and down pulling me forward telling me i was wrong for leaving time stretches and doubles the sleep in my eyes blurs the road into the 405 the cold autumn wind squeezes in through a cracked read window it bites my neck and snaps me back to the 294 i'm awake to the fact that my mind is so everywhere that i feel stuck going nowhere the odometer just counts miles in the wrong direction around me the fears were driving gold hondas the hopes were in the distance walking on foot the driving forces my mind to move just as fast emptiness stretches and doubles the sunroof is open the moon shines through the street lamps the dashboard glows blue i should have stopped for gas thirty miles ago but that would have made the trip worse with the engine roar gone i'd be thinking clearly and wanting to go back to where i'm now allowed to be right now i hate the distance where a phone call seems so quick but a trip feels like days what little strength i have left from the addiction of sleepless nights is beaten on by memories behind me my dreams were piled in buses and the tomorrows were in station wagons somewhere in a memorized pattern of left turns and right turns i make my way back to my room knowing that it's not where i'm supposed to be and i'm sure not supposed to be alone i left my bags on the floor eighty-five miles back in a room along with socks and shirts there's a clichd heart in a jar on a nightstand next to a book under a light and close to a sleeping girl all the way i know that my love is riding next to me wearing a bright yellow coat and driving faster than i ever could

 FRESH CORN With help from urlLink Kyle (as usual), urlLink Connie has a new website. I don't think she even knows it has changed yet...

 INTENSE B-DAY WISHES Happy birthday urlLink Robert Patrick ! Run, jump, morph!

 FUN AT 3AM I've been waking up at 3 in the morning again, I've done it for the last 4 days. It's fun.

 THE GAMES The urlLink Bears game was PHENOMENAL. That's all I'll say about that. And congrats to urlLink Arizona , and especially to urlLink Mark Grace . You did it with the wrong team, but I'll forgive you.

 VAYA LOS OSOS! Played football yesterday again, and like EVERY OTHER TIME, I got my ass kicked. I tried to stop a running play, the guy running was 5-foot-8 and like 250lbs. I tried to stop with only my thumb. My thumb subsequently was jammed or sprained or something BAD. Sidenote: I was able to take down the guy using an illegal dragon-sweep. Anyway, time to get ready. I have a Bears game to attend.

 SURVIVAL OF THE FATTEST How is it that respectable entertainment news sites like urlLink Mr. Showbiz die out, while the urlLink waste of entertainment news sites lives on?

 WAX ON, GET OLD Jesus, urlLink Ralph Macchio turned 40 today. He was 23 when he did the only urlLink work he's really known for. He wasn't a KID at all. Oh the lies of Hollywood.

 CRUISIN' So I'm not the only one who's in the new car market. Seems urlLink Kyle and urlLink Sarah bought a new urlLink ride this weekend.

 NOTHING GOOD Drunk and tired.

 WHEN PEOPLE TAKE YOUR IDEA AND DO IT urlLink This reminds me of back in the day, when urlLink Bruen , urlLink Kyle , urlLink Jeff and I used to cruise the Gurnee McDonald's because they had 25-cent burger nights. A Ronald McDonald just like the one in the article sat on a bench and begged us to steal him. However, we never did. Yet, a couple of kids did. And when I see the finished product...it's far funnier than I ever imagined.

 HOW KYLE FORD TAKES ON GEOLOGY Acapriccio : i took geology at augie Acapriccio : all i remember Acapriccio : was that i licked them all Acapriccio : to determine if they were salt Stick Bus : HAHAHA! Acapriccio : that's how i passed Acapriccio : that's the key

 CHRISTMAS GIFTS Gosh, I really hope urlLink Kyle really enjoys the Christmas urlLink gift I got him...

 WHAT I DID TODAY FOR $15 AN HOUR This is a summary of what I have accomplished at work today... Step 1 - Play on internet. Step 2 - Stare at ceiling. Step 3 - Go to bathroom. Step 4 - Repeats previous steps 1, 2 and 3.

 COUNTING DOWN...AGAIN 10 days until urlLink Los Angeles .

 ONLINE WASTELAND Where the hell is everybody? Hello...? Anyone...?

 IT HAPPENED AGAIN One year ago, I posted the following... Time for a useless actor birthday announcement. urlLink Grard Depardieu is 52. I think the picture they use to show him says it all. Well, now he's 53...and he still sucks. And that picture...still sucks.

 WHAT THE? BLOGGER HACKED? Well, I tried blogging this morning only to find that over Christmas a ton of people had the same problem I did. When I tried to sign into blogger this morning, I kept getting a "Oops, bad login. Try again." type error. It seems that everyone's password in the blog-universe has been changed to the number "1." How odd. So I changed my password as soon as I logged on with the number "1" and changed it back. You should obviously do the same.

 QUICKIE Of course it's Christmas so I'm not expecting anyone to read this. I have a TON of new pictures already to edit and post but they may have to wait. I'm jumping onto the urlLink Stick Bus server soon so I have to clean house and move. We'll see. Have a good holiday everyone. This year, family and friends mean a lot more than they have in the past. May your days be great and your hearts be warm. There is so much to be thankful for, but during this time we cannot forget our loss. May whatever God you believe in give you strength to overcome and make next year even better. To my friends on the west coast all the way to my friends on the east coast and to all my friends in between, merry Christmas and happy New Year. Later amigos, we'll talk in 2002...

 252 REASONS TO LOVE HOCKEY urlLink This brings back memories of the epic urlLink Detroit vs. urlLink Colorado brawl.

 GIVING "PRIMATIVE" A NAME GrovesA16 : i hate widescreen. Stick Bus : my Stick Bus : god Stick Bus : that's like saying you hate stereo.

 SPELL CHECK Okay, I don't think anyone has ever made this official, so I'm doing it now. After reading some other weblogs found off of urlLink www.stickbus.com , I've noticed many people writing it as "Stickbus." That's good...but horrilby, horribly wrong. The correct spelling is "Stick Bus." Two words. Two, stand alone, words. No hyphens, no merging. Two words. Why do I know this? I didn't get 150 t-shirts made up that say "STICK BUS" for nothing (I still have a few if anyone is looking)...

 FINALLY, IT'S DECEMBER And today...it's finally snowing.

 GIVEN TO FLY he made it to the ocean had a smoke in a tree the wind rose up, set him down on his knee a wave came crashing like a fist to the jaw, delivered him wings, "hey look at me now..."

 FAME AND OFFICE PARITES Stick Bus : not a goddamned celebrity there. just a bunch of fat people and white trash. Acapriccio : ass Stick Bus : i'm the only celeb here. Stick Bus : "ooooh! freddie prinze! at our party! [size XXL panties hit dave's face]"

 GOING POLITICAL I've never been one for politicial causes like save the rainforest or stop the sweatshops. But today, I think I've found my urlLink cause .

 THE 2002 NAME-IT-DAVE CAMPAIGN On the 7th of this month, urlLink Sarah wrote, "we just found out it's a boy," which only added fuel to the "2002 Name-it-Dave Campaign." As most of you know, the focus of this campaign is to influence urlLink Kyle and Sarah to name their child David, after myself. I've spent some time researching the name, "David Ford," and it seems that there are not only MANY successful David Ford's in the world, but some rather handsome ones as well. Let's take a look... This urlLink David Ford is an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Concordia University. This urlLink David Ford was the head art director in such movies as urlLink Stargate , the late 80's classic (ass) urlLink Heathers , and the box office smash urlLink In the Army Now starring Pauly Shore. This urlLink David Ford is a member of the British government representing the urlLink Northern Ireland Assembly . This urlLink David Ford is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering at Texas A&M University. His professional interests include (but not limited to) statistical thermodynamics, molecular simulation, adsorption, transport in microporous materials, and diffusion in polymers. This urlLink David Ford is an Assistant Professor with a Ph.D. at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This urlLink David Ford teaches at the College of Forest Resources, University of Washington. This urlLink David Ford is the Vice Provost for Academic Affairs at Virginia Tech.

This urlLink David Ford homes in Britain and says, "I am 60 years old and retired from my job as a Senior Electrical Engineer in the Offshore and Petrochemical industry." Nice! This urlLink David Ford is in charge of graphic design for K-VA-T Foods. This urlLink David Ford is the Chief Operating Officer at Orion Partners Ltd. who specialize in commercial real estate services. This urlLink David Ford is a Florida State Universtity Alumni who currently works for the Goldman Sachs Asset Management Division. And finally, this urlLink David Ford is dead. And that is only the beginning of the David Ford legacy. There are hundreds, perhaps THOUSANDS of David Ford webpages that I couldn't even mention (doing all the links for what's above killed me as it is!). I mean really? What more proof do you need? Name the boy Dave, and you're guaranteed a urlLink stud .

 I HATE OFFICE CHRISTMAS PARTIES! I LOATHE the person or persons who ever started the concept of the office Christmas party. First let me say this. Because Abbott employs some 30,000 people, all pretty much in one location, the notion of having an annual company-wide Christmas party is out of the question. Instead, the hundreds of units and divisions are broken down into making the decision to celebrate holiday festivities on their own. Now being that my unit (about 30 people) is a pretty diverse unit of people and ages and lifestyles, there is no way that they could all ever agree on an event to attend or restaurant to go to. Instead they opt for every person bringing in something to eat, they called it "Holiday Potluck Luncheon." Potluck makes me think of the random crappy hot lunches that a urlLink few of urlLink us suffered through in the grade school years at urlLink Rockland Elementary (note: Raptors my ass, ROBINS FOREVER!). So why do I hate this so much? Just because I can. Christmas alone drives me nuts, the sick consumerism and every moron ever on the road. People here don't really understand that I when I'm at work, I'd just rather be left alone. There are a few individuals here that I enjoy talking too, primarily because they understand the workings, or lack there of, of this area. The secretary staff alone is enough to push me over the edge. I'm already getting crap from the because I didn't bring a "dish" to share. Eat me people, I'm not an experienced chef and I didn't want to bring a box of cookies that would go uneaten and unnoticed. Instead, I just brought nothing. There's such a fakeness about it, most of the people here talk crap behind each other's back, but the moment we have something like this, it's all smiles. I SWEAR it's like high school, down to the cliques. And this is just on my nerves today because I have far more important things to be doing than sitting here, bitching about people whose entire life is based around this events of this office. I'm tired, I'm crabby and I've got finals for school tomorrow...can you tell?

 WILL WORK FOR MONEY So here's the situation. I currently work AT urlLink Abbott Laboratories but I'm a "temporary employee." I technically work for urlLink Kelly Services who in turn, whores me out to Abbott. Well within the last two months, Abbott has decided to go exclusively with another temp service named urlLink Manpower . The deal was that Kelly Services was going to negotiate with Manpower to "absorb" the Kelly employees at Abbott, and we'd all live happily ever after. I guess it fell through...a week ago. Today my boss and I learned that Kelly Services is canceling my contract to Abbott Labs as of the 31st of this month. What this means is that if I can't wheel and deal with Manpower, I'll have to leave Abbott Labs at the end of this month, or possibly even be among the unemployed. Part of the stress here is that my boss is going on vacation Friday and she won't be back until the beginning of January. So she really wants to get this done so I'm not caught up with something for the next two weeks. Now there are pros and cons to this entire situation, but it's a weird feeling to know that you might now be working in the same place because of something that wasn't your fault... I'll keep you posted.

 PLEASE DON'T HURT 'EM Need something to do on Wednesday, December 19th? I got your answer right urlLink here . And if that's not enough to move you, how about some urlLink promotional urlLink photos .

 WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED? We've learned that you can buy everything you need on urlLink QVC , just not the urlLink host ... "After his arrest, police found two boxes containing engagement and wedding rings strapped to Young's chest." Nice. If you're going to hunt someone down, come prepared to marry them at gunpoint.

 DAMN DIRTY APES I'm at CLC using school computers and this is probably one of the most horrible displays EVER. I'm running this from Netscape 4.7! What the HELL is that all about? Plus there are only like 20 computers here in the library, yet this DUMBASS next to me has been playing Yahoo pool since I sat down. Glad to see he's going to class or letting someone else use the computer who may actually need it. People who attend CLC are worthless.

 I AM IRON MAN! urlLink This is for urlLink Bruen . I linked the pic so it wouldn't destroy people's computers, it's a pretty big file. Ye with modem use caution in opening...yar.

 STEVE PERRY = ROCK GOD In my mail yesterday was a package from urlLink Alison in which the double CD set, urlLink The Essential JOURNEY , was enclosed. Double CD set of Journey! That's like, 2 hours of Journey! Or more! With great tracks like, "Don't Stop Believin',"Separate Ways," and "Open Arms," you just can't go wrong! I feel like I should be wearing tight black jeans with a Journey concert t-shirt that has an iron-on logo (great Christmas idea by the way). Journey ROCKS!

 FREE AT LAST Finally, the DSL gods have answered my prayers. Time to download EVERYTHING!

 IT'S AN E. HONDA DAY, AGAIN

 CHRISTMAS IN JULY...KINDA It's December 4th, and usually by now there's snow on the ground and the average high is 33 chilling degrees. Yet outside, right now, it's sunny and 60 degrees. Where the hell am I?

 "IT" FINALLY ARRIVES And I'm going to be the first to start the urlLink Segway Human Transporter Hell's Angels. Our slogan is going to be, "We're going to ride across America, and every 15 miles stop for 6 hours so we can charge our battery. But then it's back to KICKING ASS!"

 CHRISTMAS SPIRIT My mom loves Christmas, or at least I thought so. Every year, box upon box upon box finds its way out of our crawl space and the decorations erupt around the house. Then this morning I saw urlLink this box and almost died laughing.

 TODAY I'M Bored beyond belief.

 WEEKEND UPDATE Well, I finally fell asleep around 2:15am last night. That sucked, and its suckage was only amplified by the fact that I woke up at 8:30am this morning. urlLink Outfield rocks. Played football today too. Not only am I again a grid-iron stud, but now I'm paying for it as usual. Sore legs, sore back, re-jammed my thumb, and there seem to be a set of teeth marks around the back of my right arm...odd. Since Tuesday night, I've watched urlLink Rushmore four times. Yes...four nights, I've had the opportunity to sit on my ass, get fat, and watch movies. And finally, my damn urlLink mouse is dying. It goes berzerk and starts shooting my arrow all over the screen and throwing me all over the internet. urlLink Kyle said his is dying to. Guess I have to go buy a new one tomorrow. Add another to the heap, urlLink Poje ...

 I *HEART* HOCKEY "It just goes to prove what a chicken he really is," urlLink Theo Fleury said. "My 5-year-old son hits harder than he does. Cairns throws muffins out there. He jumped me from behind -- typical Cairns. I have no respect for that guy whatsoever, none. If you're going to talk the talk, you've got to walk the walk. Courtesy of urlLink ESPN.com .

 FORMAT THIS! Once again, I have fallen prey to the styling criticism of urlLink Kyle Ford . What this time you ask? Well apparently it's a crime to put the TWO spaces after a period between sentences. And right now you're all saying, "What? You're supposed to do two spaces, that's what we learned in school! That's urlLink MLA format, everyone uses MLA format." Well, apparently it's wrong. I don't quite understand the reasoning behind it, but it's wrong. What makes two spaces even better is when Kyle wants me to write something for him and it's FULL of those two spaces. That means when he edits the stuff, he has to find them and take one out. So I'm now making a concious attempt to only SINGLE space between sentences. Please be aware of this change. Thank you.

 IT FINALLY CAME Well our big snow fall finally blew across Chicagoland. And of course everyone behind the wheel of a car (except me) decides to go dumb when driving in it. Anyway, I took a few pics before I ran to work this morning. All I can say is damn I miss my truck... urlLink 1 | urlLink 2 | urlLink 3

 HARRIS K. I have a favorite quote about L.A. by William Shakespeare. He said, "This other eden, demiparadise, this precious stone set in the silver sea, this earth, this realm, this Los Angeles."

 BLIZZARD I never get Dairy Queen.

 EVERYTHING YOU WANT check your head and slam the door all your dreams are dead tonight it's a million miles away the place where the hopes are born again the storms end somewhere out near kansas your heart stays here devoted your mind goes to the hills the place where the world is yours again set fire to the sky and rewrite your past everything changes out there you know the place where the dreams are born again

 60 DEGREES AND JANUARY It's been the nicest weekend of the winter and I've been indoors the entire time. All I've accomplished was urlLink this . How sad.

 CHANGES AND UPDATES I added three little links at the bottom of my page, just to fill her out a little more. They're pretty basic right now, but I'll fill them in over the weekend. Finally, today will be the last day you can view the "Battling E. Hondas" at the bottom of my blogger. Get your fill now, could be awhile until the next "E. Honda Day." REVISION : Okay, so I just posted this last entry and it pushed the Hondas off the page. I apologize for any hopes I may have crushed.

 E ---|---|---|--- F i passed 2am hours ago with wilson bringing in the smell of summer all this driving and hoping that i'll crash into what's mine along the way i took off the seat belt miles ago to catch a breath somewhere i paused to change the cd my camera needs film again and my mouth needs a cigarette my sunroof yawned and let in the night sky i feel everything that was with me before climbing up my throat and beginning to be tossed aside i just need to pull over and rest awhile.

 DESIRE

 "IT'S NOT A PAYPHONE! IT'S A PORTABLE PHONE!" If you thought " urlLink COPS ," " urlLink World's Scariest Police Chases ," and " urlLink Temptation Island 2 " were as low as urlLink FOX television programming could go...prepare for urlLink tonight . Thank God urlLink one man will save the night...

 POSTING BAIL I saw urlLink this , and I'm crying. Link courteousy of urlLink EW .

 GOODNIGHT, HOLLYWOOD BLVD. I've had the urlLink Pete Yorn album, urlLink Musicforthemorningafter and the urlLink Ryan Adams album, urlLink Gold , sitting on my desk for some time (like what? Four months?). Monday I finally tossed them into my car's CD collection. Now I know because they were both a little under the radar, they're probably considered "trendy" or whatever, but both albums are really good. Surprisingly good. Anyway, this is just me telling you that they get the Dave Sliozis seal of approval because my tastes in movies and music are the highest in all the land. Oh yeah, and I "borrowed" urlLink Pet Sounds . This after our local oldies station played back-to-back Beach Boys. Pet Sounds is California.

 RECYCLED urlLink 2nd hand urlLink digital urlLink fun .

 EL BLOGO DE MI HERMANO Well it looks like even my brother urlLink Mark is back in the blog business. And Mark left a subtle reminder of how he earned his fame by saying, "I was in Can Tag, and still nobody is showing me love." Mmm...Can Tag... Hey wait a minute...Can Tag + new server = reissue of the Can Tag movies? We'll see...

 JUNK E-MAIL This junk e-mail thing is finally starting to get on my nerves. I didn't get to check my AOL e-mail all weekend and I returned home to 30 messages waiting. Only three were worth my time (one of them I had sent to myself as a reminder). It seems like most of my friends have already changed e-mail names at least once to escape the deluge of "virgin girls" and "free viagra." I just don't understand this business tactic at all. Why the hell would I every trust a product that was advertised to me via e-mail? Especially when it comes from some garbled, worthless e-mail address. The latest trend that is pissing me off in regards to junk mail is subject lines that make you think it's a real e-mail. For example, this morning in my hotmail junk folder (I have to check to make sure nothing good slipped through) there was an e-mail with the subject, "Wait! You forgot to message me back!" Of course it was from an e-mail I didn't recognize but to exercise my point here, I opened it. It was an ad to see Jennifer Love Hewitt and Anna Kournikova in "shocking fotos." That's right, "fotos." Another example, I have an e-mail titled, "RE: Your Inquiry" from another crap address. This ad told me, "You were referred to me today as someone who is seeking a financial miracle. If this is true please continue - I promise this will be worth your time!" Right. First of all, I never made any inquiries so I'm not going to bite. Second of all, I do need a financial miracle, however I'm not stupid enough to follow this e-mail for help. And the saddest part is there are people out there who open these. They're too stupid to go, "Gee, I don't know anyone with the e-mail oiledteen5361@wildoats.com, but it says it's regarding the message I sent. I should open it." It's these same morons that get e-mails here at work titled "I love you" and open them to release viruses onto our servers. What the hell is wrong with people?

 BACK TO THE BLOG urlLink Connie brought her blog back to life last night to keep score with the Golden Globes. Does this mean she'll be using it more now? I guess we can only wait and see.

 THE LAST DANCE Well, it was a good run for the urlLink Bears this season, and everyone in Chicago knows it would have been a far better game had that cheap shot not taken Miller out of the game. And what the HELL was up with urlLink Maynard ? A 15 yard kick? There's always next season. Hopefully Bears management won't pull a Chicago Bulls on us and start tearing apart a good thing. And while I do like Miller as QB, I certainlly wouldn't complain about seeing Bledsoe in the blue and orange. They're getting there, we just have to be patient.

 DECLARATION At the moment this post hits my web page, I am declaring myself, "The Most Bored Man in the World." I used to be able to handle the 40 hour work week. Now it's killing me. I'm going to go to school part time forever just to avoid this 40 hour monster.

 MYSTERIES OF THE CARTOON UNIVERSE I was watching Scooby-Doo before work this morning and I just couldn't help thinking, "These kids, are goddamned morons. How many adventures have they been on where the ghosts were actually ghosts? Everytime, it's some guy in a suit. Morons."

 SO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN...? What happens when a punter becomes a hero? He gets his own urlLink website of course.

 DUDE, WHAT'S UP WITH YOUR DOG? What kind of dog wants a toy like urlLink this ?

 FINALLY THE PHOTOS I finally coded and captioned the 70 pictures I deemed worthy enough to build a photo gallery around. So here you go, just on the other side of this urlLink link ... MODEM USERS BEWARE! There are ten pages, seven photos per page and they're pretty damn big. So if you're on a modem (cough-hahaha-cough) you may want to find something else to do while the pages load. Might I suggest reading urlLink this .

 SWEATING KYLE FORD Last night, urlLink Bruen , Uma and myself were sitting in our local urlLink Baker's Square . As usual we ended up talking about urlLink Kyle . We were talking about my recent rash of server problems and Uma asked why I don't "just call Kyle." My response went as follows: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DAVE: Have you ever tried talking to Kyle on the phone? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He talks so fast sometimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BRUEN: Yeah, when we were talking a while back, I hung &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;up and I was sweating. Like I ran a marathon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[ Dave collapses to table laughing hysterically. ] Anyway, those who know Kyle will understand that. But now to rival urlLink Alison for most digital camera pictures on a personal urlLink StickBus.com hosted site... urlLink 1 | urlLink 2 | urlLink 3 | urlLink 4

 IT'S A BATTLING E. HONDA DAY

 INSPIRATION AT 1 AM urlLink urlLink urlLink

 I HATE MY CAR The Junkfisher: i can arrange for that car to be stolen and driven into lake michigan from lake bluff. The Junkfisher: all i would need from you would be a ride back home Stick Bus: i was actually just going to set fire to it in the front yard. Stick Bus: i'm all about making a show of it. Stick Bus: maybe i'll wear a yellow biohazard suit while smashing the car with a frozen turkey and yelling, "BACK TO THE UTERUS! BACK TO THE UTERUS!" it would be wonderful performance art. The Junkfisher: i'd pay to see that.

 TEST I'm having some technical difficulties. Back later.

 THE MIRROR PROJECT If you don't know about the urlLink Mirror Project you might be a little behind the times. Anyway, I got urlLink published today with a snap from the LA trip (blog still pending).

 PROOF OF BLOG This post is to prove to urlLink Alison that she is a retard and blogger is working.

 WONDER YEARS I hate urlLink Winnie Cooper .

 BACK IN CHICAGO I'm back in Chicago. I have 160 photos to go through, edit and put together, so give me a few days on that. I'll hopefully blog the week's events as of tomorrow (for all you X-Files fans out there, prepare for my encounter with Carter...that's right). Back later.

 FOR THOSE KEEPING SCORE AT HOME Use urlLink Flight Tracker , we're on United Airlines flight 119 from O'Hare (ORD) to Los Angeles International (LAX). Bye kids.

 BACK IN ACTION I'm back, but only for a little while. Gotta keep packing for Los Angeles. We'll see you in a little while.

 iTHEFT People are urlLink stealing software from computer retailers with their urlLink iPod . There's a brilliance in using an iPod for evil.

 REBIRTH Huh, how did urlLink this get on my site? [warning: do not click the link above unless you have urlLink Quicktime video capabilities. And for modem users, be sure you have time to watch the slow download.]

 DR. DEATH II - QUOTE OF THE DAY My biology teacher today was trying to simply explain to us how learning the functions of " urlLink organelles " is much better done if the sample can be live as opposed to a dead sample. His compassionate analogy went as follows: "It's like a funeral. You've got grandma in a box and someone says 'Isn't she lifelike.' NO! " Quite the poet.

 DRIVER RECOGNITION WAVE Now we all know that we're supposed to courtesy wave when someone lets us have a spot in a parking lot or lets us pull out in traffic. But there's another kind of wave that takes place between owners of the same vehicle type. Normally I should be giving urlLink this wave to other urlLink Honda Accord owners. However, because I have such a bitter animosity toward my car, it transcends to other people who would be foolish enough to purchase that car. So now when another Accord owner waves to me, I wave back like urlLink this .

 MAKES FOR A LONG DAY Nothing like starting out the day by watching " urlLink Big Top Pee Wee ."

 I HATE BIOLOGY I guess I should be more specific. I hate the lab part of biology. First of all my class consists of 30 people. But the kicker here is that 27 of those 30, are girls. Of course this means the three guys are left to fend for themselves. But, one of the guys (who I think may be technically a guy with different "orientation") is friends with some girls, so he doesnt deal with myself and the other guy. The last remaining guy, besides myself, probably sucks at biology just as much as I do. Now when that one guy shows up, I at least have someone to talk to for and hour and a half. But today, that bastard took the quiz in the morning and left early. So I'm there by myself. I feel like such a piece of meat. The next reason I hate the lab is a direct result of my inability to just do it. For some reason, I just can't mix test tubes and chemicals and all that crap. I can read the instructions word for word and follow each step PERFECTLY and still somehow screw it up. The rule I've adopted is the "three strikes" rule. If I screw up on one lab practice three times, I quit and move on. Without fail, my tubes are always different colors than everyone else's, or they fizz more than everyone else's. One day we screwed up so bad, the liquids in the tube were boiling...without a hot plate, the tube was scalding hot. It's really degrading. Whats worse is I can hear all the whispers and I can see it in those girl's eyes, "stupid meat can't mix a test tube." Yeah, that's what they're saying alright. So in this biology class, we're never getting out of the "microbiology" scale, which sucks. Give me a worm, a cat, a pig, and lemme cut it open. I can do that. I can memorize organs and functions. None of this chemical mixing with organic molecule shit. Finally I was talking to my teacher on the way out about why things go horribly array with my experiments. After listing off reasons that made me feel like I was two ("Did you use a clean test tube?" "Did you properly read the directions?" "Stupid meat can't mix a test tube?"), he asked me what my "major" was, to which I replied (and I don't know why I say it anymore) "film." His response was even better, "Oh... you're the film guy." He knew I was the "film guy" because on the first day of class we filled out surveys about ourselves. Anyway, he proceeded to tell me how I can benefit from biology in the film world. Needless to say it went in one ear and out the other. The teacher is classic though. If you recall from my semesters at urlLink Columbia , I had an environmental science teacher there who pretty much explained that "humans" were a form of pollution and that we're pretty much killing the Earth and we're all going to die. Happy class. I called that teacher, Dr. Death. Well now in this biology class, I have Dr. Death II. My biology teacher never goes a day without telling us about something we eat and how it can kill us. He seems to target fat people a lot, talking about McDonald's and how evil they are. Of course he mentions smoking and artificial preservatives. But, the man actually said, "Sure, go out and drink beer. Beer is better for your system than you think." Which really just says to me, "come to class drunk." And I still want a tattoo.

 BLOG CRAVING I feel like I should blog something but I don't know what. I want to say that I finally saw, " urlLink A Beautiful Mind " this weekend and I want to say what I thought about that movie, but I know I'll only doom my comment box below to the same conversations that can be read pretty much on any other site in the urlLink Stick Bus family. I'm also thinking more seriously about getting my tattoo. I still have no ideas for what I want. Right now the leading idea is "THUG-4-LIFE" arched from shoulder to shoulder with the image of a crying virgin Mary underneath it. What do you think?

 ...SIGH... I love urlLink Canada but at the same time, I'm hating them...

 IS SHE SLOW? Being that I already loathe figure skating (it's really just NASCAR with people and judges) doesn't help me look at urlLink Sarah Hughes without my view being tainted. But have you heard this girl talk? Jesus, it takes her forever to answer a question. Enjoy that medal honey cause you sure as hell aren't getting any commercial endorsements. Unless, urlLink Sylvan Learning Center is looking for someone...

 USA HOCKEY Tonight, the urlLink ladies go for it all.

 CLEAN CUT AND SHAVEN My my, what a haircut will do. urlLink before | urlLink after Oh, and am I a POSTING MACHINE tonight or WHAT!?

 SAUSAGE LINKS Okay, so all of my links work down there. Happy?

 MICHAEL...BOLTON? Right now, the Michael Bolton rendition of Cyndi Lauper's "Time After Time" is playing over our office speakers. Once again proving that there is no God.

 SMALL UPDATES I added a few more quotes to my "about" section down at the bottom of my page here. Plus I added links. Go to it. Oh, and I know the "photos" page doesn't work. So don't get all over me about that.

 BLOGCON2002 As urlLink Alison mentioned, there will be a urlLink convention held in urlLink Las Vegas for members of the urlLink Blogger community. And as of right now, I'm strongly considering going. I'm sure I could at least get urlLink Kyle to go if I tell him he can push a certain urlLink company's services there. Of course I'll also keep checking around the Blogiverse to see who else is planning on attending. I don't want to fly to Vegas to find myself alone or caught up in some urlLink adventure where urlLink Zack loses his hard earned money, urlLink Kelly becomes jealous and urlLink Slater gets chased by mobsters. And yes, I did make an attempt to link every word in this post. urlLink Thank you .

 HEDGEHOG My hair is getting really long and it's starting to look like a urlLink hedgehog . I really need a haircut (and a shave!) and I took urlLink this picture to prove that point, but I failed, the pic really doesn't show that (but it does show my GIANT DIGITAL CAMERA). I was then going to make a comment about my hair being so long that I could have urlLink dreads like urlLink Ariel once had, but I failed. So I could have just said, I need a haircut. Instead I've wasted time writing this. Oh well.

 OOH! I GET IT! So I now understand the rules and scoring of urlLink curling . And with a little help from urlLink Bill Nye Science Guy , I also understand the urlLink physics .

 FEATURED CLIENT At urlLink Stick Bus, LLC , they feature a client from the select group of individuals housed on their server. This month happens to feature urlLink Jeff Eichhorn : Hes the architect who would be king, despite the fact that he hasnt updated since May of 2001. Get your fill of Jeff Eichhorns personal website, this weeks featured client. The fact that the "featured client" is someone who hasn't touched a web page in almost year says something about the quality of customers they host for. Plus I hear there's a dog, and a guy that doesn't even really exist.

 JUST MEGA

 NO FUN It's no fun this late at night to be tired, drunk, and without your girlfriend. Jesus, I am drunk again...huh. Autoshow pics tomortorw, some great Chicago photots too.

 SEARCHING FOR FRIENDS I was searching urlLink Google (because I have nothing else to do at work right now), so I entered the name urlLink Bruen to see what the results would be. I got urlLink this picture...

 WHAT I'VE LEARNED ABOUT BIG BUSINESS - PART 2 Today at work, I received a 3,818 page catalog from urlLink Grainger . Apparently they supply EVERYTHING. I could order urlLink this right now. I don't know what it is, I don't know what it does...but I can order one. That's power.

 WHO'S JOHNNY? "Who's Johnny?" she said And smiled in her special way "Johnny" she said "You know I love you" "Who's Johnny?" she said And tried to look the other way Her eyes gave her away

 BRILLIANT ADVERTISING - PART 2 Speaking of brilliant adversting, the commercials for urlLink 10-10-220 are advertising marvels. They used the following simple mathematical formula: urlLink Terry Bradshaw + urlLink ALF = BRILLIANT.

 BRILLIANT ADVERTISING In danger of showing myself as a true male...has anyone else seen that new urlLink Victoria's Secret ad on television? Jesus, it's BRILLIANT! There are boobs and bras and water and milk on boobs and music, oh my GOD! I just don't think I'm just not doing the commercial justice. Of all the Victoria's Secrets commercials I've seen, this one is RIGHT on target. When I see it, I just want to sign online and buy women's underwear. So if you find underwear in your mailboxes in the near future...you know who sent it.

 CURLING i don't understand urlLink curling , but I love it.

 WHAT I'VE LEARNED ABOUT BIG BUSINESS If you want something new, intentionally break the stuff you have, say, "I don't really know what happened," and wait for them to say, "We'll just have to buy you a new one." God bless multi-million dollar companies. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a 17-inch monitor to destroy.

 BRADMAYNARD.COM I finally got around to doing an update on urlLink The Brad Maynard Experience . It's part one of the "Maynard Fiction." Check it out! Right now!

 VALENTINE'S DAY Clever how I made the font red, eh? Anyway, I can't believe it's only 9:00am and I'm ready to rip the tradition and ideals of urlLink Valentine's Day to shreds. Now those of you who know me are probably already saying, "Dave, you dumbass, you've been dating urlLink Connie for almost two years. You should be happy to have a person to share Valentine's Day with." Well right, I am happy to have someone on Valentine's Day. That's not the reason I hate this awful day though. Essentially, my total disgust lies in the way that we view this day and act on it. And for the record, I think that Valentine's Day just BARELY edges out Christmas for the number one spot on my "hated-holidays" list. So why do we "celebrate" Valentines Day? The following is an excerpt from urlLink HistoryChannel.com : One legend contends that Valentine was a priest who served during the third century in Rome. When Emperor Claudius II decided that single men made better soldiers than those with wives and families, he outlawed marriage for young men -- his crop of potential soldiers. Valentine, realizing the injustice of the decree, defied Claudius and continued to perform marriages for young lovers in secret. When Valentine's actions were discovered, Claudius ordered that he be put to death. According to one legend, Valentine actually sent the first 'valentine' greeting himself. While in prison, it is believed that Valentine fell in love with a young girl -- who may have been his jailor's daughter -- who visited him during his confinement. Before his death, it is alleged that he wrote her a letter, which he signed 'From your Valentine,' an expression that is still in use today. And that brings us up to now. A man dies for his love of a woman and what do we do now to pay tribute to that love? We buy flowers that die in a day and crappy balloons. We pass out crappy Valentine's at schools with phrases like, "I CHOO-CHOO CHOOSE YOU" (that's a CLASSIC, I know). I think the only reason that this tops Christmas as a shitty holiday (if it can actually be classified as a holiday, perhaps I should specify as a "gift giving" holiday), a shitty GIFT GIVING holiday, is because our Christmas shopping mentality gives us almost a month to go out and select the perfect gift for someone. However, do you shop a month in advance for Valentine's Day? No. The Valentine's Day market is geared for LESS than ten minutes of shopping (perfect for urlLink Kyle ). You go in a store, grab something pink and heart shaped, and five bucks later you're back on the road. At least during Christmas some thought goes into the gift. Now I'm not saying that EVERYONE shops that way. I know a few people who take time to actually celebrate this day and love. But the other 95% of you, PLEASE quit being trash. This is a day where you are supposed to celebrate love, and I don't know how you can do that with a urlLink $1.99 rose and a urlLink $2.99 teddy bear . Anyone who says, "it's the thought that counts" here, go outside and stand in traffic...now. As for those of you who are single, you obviously have the "standard" reason for hating Valetine's Day. But really, it's just another day manufactured by the evil urlLink Hallmark corporation to prey upon the wallets of those who are in relationships and exploit the most beautiful of human emotions for money. Goddamn Hallmark. In the end, thats $20 more dollars that you have to spend on beer for St. Pattys Day. And really, shouldn't we take time and do things for the people we love all the time? Not some froo-froo nasty pink holiday? My Valentine's philosophy is this, give something that comes from your heart, something that makes you feel good to be giving. A simple card with something wrote is perfect. But I guess if the $2.99 teddy bear comes from your heart, I guess it's okay too.

 KYLE WAS RIGHT In the "Moments of Zen" section of urlLink Sarah's site she posted: "Have you been experiencing an increase in barnyard sex emails lately?" - Kyle Ford, 1/23/02 But it's true. Out of my 12 AOL e-mails today, 4 involved chicks and equestrians.

 POSES Reclined amongst these packs of reasons For to smokes the days away into the evenings All these poses of classical torture Ruined my mind like a snake in the orchard I did go from wanting to be someone now I'm drunk and wearing flip-flops on Fifth Avenue

 BOYS AND CARS To me, this is like dating the urlLink sister of the urlLink prom queen .

 TEMP I've been feeling pretty crappy underneath these last few days. I feel like everything is just part-time. Part-time student, part-time job, part-time boyfriend, part-time friend, part-time, part-time, part-time. Nothing is really a focus and nothing seems constant. I feel like I'm watching someone else's life through a television. I guess I just want a focus, something that feels like a base that I can always come back to in a day when everything else feels so jumbled.

 ULTRA VIOLET Sometimes I feel like I don't know Sometimes I feel like checking out. I wanna get it wrong Can't always be strong And love, it won't be long.

 SHUTTER More people need digital cameras.

 PEOPLE SKILLS Well the boss I've had for almost two years here at my job is moving on to better things and leaving me behind. Unfortunately, I will be getting a "temporary" new boss until one can be found to replace my old boss. The guy replacing my boss hates me, I'm pretty sure. He scheduled a meeting with me next week, I think it will go as follows (him being the "Bob" character and myself playing "Tom," exerpt from the movie urlLink Office Space ): BOB : What, what would ya say, ya do here? TOM : Well look, I already told you, I deal with the goddamn customers so the engineers don't have to. I have people skills! I am good at dealing with people! Can't you undersand that? What the hell is wrong with you people? And...scene...

 OPEN TO SEARCH urlLink Kyle put things in order yesterday so I can start checking my site stats again (it's an ego thing) and apparently people have been searching for, and finding my site under some strange seach queries... > "fox studio karaoke" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been to the studio, I don't recall and karaoke there. > "empire diner" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;duh. > "girls boarding school sexual experience pics" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I uhh...well I umm...next entry please... > "whoppers" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't even like Whoopers. > "lawnmower dmx meaning" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How complex can a urlLink lawnmower lyric be? > "rob dobi sucks" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I never met the guy but I like urlLink his site. > "fire and ice lark voorhies" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" urlLink Fire and Ice " is a movie, also staring urlLink Tempest Bledsoe ! > "lark voorhies pics" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quit pushing the Voorhies! > "jamba juice market potential" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know nothing of the market, but I *heart* their product. > "sweet sites to buy sick ass hockey rollerblades" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uh huh, good use of "sick ass" as adjectives. > "steve zahn naked photos" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No...never.

 WELL GOOD MORNING TO YOU, BITCH PC You have to love waking up, turning on your computer and having urlLink this be the first thing you see.

 DIGGING " Just remember that someday could always become tomorrow ." - urlLink Connie Sommerville

 NASA - HOME OF THE DREAM KILLERS So my childhood dream of being an astronaut was brutally crushed earlier this week when urlLink NASA announced the new " urlLink space tourism rules ." " A candidate's past and present conduct must be assessed, according to the criteria, with disqualification considered in the case of delinquency or misconduct in prior employment or military service. Other disqualifying traits: criminal, dishonest, infamous or notoriously disgraceful conduct; intentional false statement or fraud; habitual use of intoxicating beverages to excess; abuse of narcotics, drugs or other controlled substances; and membership or sponsorship in organizations which adversely affect the public's confidence in the space station or its partners. " Why the hell is there ALWAYS a "habitual use of intoxicating beverages to excess" clause when you want to go to space? Well, so much for being an astronaut, I guess it's on to politics.

 WHY IS TAPE STICKY? There is no chemical bonding or reaction between a pressure-sensitive adhesive and the substrate, the surface to which it bonds. A pressure-sensitive adhesive is a sticky, viscous, liquidlike material that adheres to a surface using only pressure. To function well, it should have good adhesion to a surface and good cohesion, or internal strength. For good adhesion, it is important that the adhesive can readily flow out on the surface. The degree, or freeness, of the flow often determines the intensity of adhesion. Degree of flow depends on the difference between the surface energy of the material and the surface energy of the adhesive. Pressure-sensitive adhesives tend to flow out on materials having a high surface energy--for instance, metals, glass and plastics such as acrylic, polycarbonate and nylon. Pressure-sensitive adhesives tend not to flow out as easily on low surface-energy materials such as polyethylene, polypropylene and Teflon. Mechanisms for adhesion include both mechanical adhesion and specific adhesion. Mechanical adhesion occurs when the adhesive flows into the texture of the substrate. Specific adhesion includes electrostatic forces, van der Waals forces and acid-base interactions that take place between the adhesive and the substrate. In the case of acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesives, the intensity of the bond typically increases over time. This growing degree of 'stickiness' occurs because of the long time it takes for the adhesive to flow onto and into the surface texture, and for the adhesive polymer to align with the surface to create the interactions.

 BACK IN THE MIDWEST Kyle came back for a visit. Here are some pics from last night. urlLink 1 | urlLink 2 | urlLink 3 | urlLink 4 | urlLink 5 | urlLink 6 | urlLink 7

 SONIC SAYS: "Dude, lets get the HELL outta here!"

 CELEBRITY BIRTHDAYS Happy birthday urlLink superstar .

 WHY? Why am I at work today?

 HATED TECHNOLOGY TERM OF THE DAY "Download." It's just too long to type. I hate typing "downloaded" and especially "downloading." That's worse than typing "Sliozis."

 SAD STATS There is nothing more disheartening than waking up to see someone searched for " urlLink weekend at bernies 2 " and found my site. That's not the kind of image I want to have. "Look! There goes that Weekend at Bernies Two search query boy!"

 HATED TECHNOLOGY TERM OF THE DAY "Log on." I hate that term.

 MEH I updated my urlLink photo section with a bunch of new pictures from around urlLink Libertyville . And I think " urlLink Let's Bowl " is one of the most underrated shows on television right now. Needless to say, " urlLink The Osbournes " probably fall under that umbrella too.

 BRU'S NEW MEMOIRS urlLink Bruen finally put up his new site design and mentions his new urlLink fianc . Congrats to Bru and Uma!

 MEMORY LANE I got my scanner back from urlLink Bruen and then I got my hands on my old grade school photos. When I scanned them in I left them really big so you can get a good look at everyone (so modem users beware). See if you can find both Bruen and urlLink Kyle . Oh, and I seem to have lost the 4th Grade. urlLink Pre-school | urlLink Kindergarten | urlLink 1st Grade urlLink 2nd Grade | urlLink 3rd Grade | urlLink 5th Grade

 PIANO THEME MUSIC I just want spring to come and bring the fifty degree temperatures with it so I can start running my fat ass around the block again. Oh, and it can bring urlLink baseball season too.

 300 DAYS IN PHOTOS Well, according to my " urlLink life " link, there are 300 days left until I leave for urlLink Los Angeles . I've decided that I'm going to take one picture a day of something that reminds me of Libertyville or something of my past here. I'm going to display them in my " urlLink photo " section (which is hurting for photos right now). I figured I'd give a little heads up about things going on here because I've posted nothing but a Japanese hot dog ad in the last week.

 FOXTROT For urlLink Wilco fans, it's about urlLink time .

 BANZAI HOT DOG! urlLink

 REFRESH I need a new picture for over on the left. I'll take some this weekend. You people do know that if you urlLink click on that picture over there, it opens to a bigger view, right? Right?

 LIFE IS WRONG It's one of the nicest days so far this year, here in Chicago. I just spent 3 hours at school and I'm about to spend another 5 hours stuck behind a desk with no windows to the outside world. What the hell is wrong with us where we feel that this is the right way to live?

 zZz zZz zZz zZz zZz I need sleep very badly.

 WANTED I need something new. An adventure or something.

 FETISH There is NOTHING I like more than a good looking hockey urlLink jersey .

 HEALTH WARNING I was eating a bag of Chee-tos and I just wanted to let everyone know for their safety that apparently they are "dangerously cheesy." Heed this warning.

 HE'S COMING BACK Even though it was only a high of urlLink ten degrees here yesterday, out west the baseball season is picking up again. So it's only right that I brush the dust off something... urlLink EEE-CHE-ROW!

 PERSPECTIVE Okay, it's just a pair of urlLink shoes . Do we really need to sell them in a steal case?

 OH CRAP And then urlLink this happened... [ background : For those of you who are unaware, young Jeffrey has not blogged since the 14th of May, 2001. Some feared he was dead, others feared he was amassing an army in some 3rd world communist country. I'm not sure what to make of this current post but there may be code within the lines.]

 ATTACK OF THE ACCORDS This afternoon, I was on the hunt. Last week, I posted about the "same-car" wave where you're supposed to recognize people who drive the same car as you. Well we all know how I feel about my car, and we all know how I wave to other owners. So this afternoon...I locked and loaded my "hand canon." Below is a series of photos I took during my "safari." The two at the end are me posing infront of my crapmobile. urlLink 1 | urlLink 2 | urlLink 3 | urlLink 4 | urlLink 5 | urlLink 6 | urlLink 7 | urlLink 8 | urlLink 9

 WHAT A WONDERFUL DAY I hate the urlLink midwest . Brr.

 SPOILERS AND LOW RIDERS We're getting urlLink The Fast and the Furious for free on our Pay-Per-View station right now. Oh the curse of free terrible movies...

 HOW LOW Okay, seriously, people at urlLink FOX , fire your urlLink idea guy.

 PRIDE I'm so proud of my urlLink father [sarcasm implied].

 WEBCAM...AGAIN I kinda-sorta have my cam back again, it's down there under "cam" (creative title, eh?). The one night it was up and running, urlLink Kyle had urlLink this reaction...

 HUH Here, you figure urlLink this one out.

 BURNED So tonight, I did something stupid. I got a wicked electrical burn because I'm a moron. I was crawling around under my desk and I was plugging my stereo jack into the back of my computer (yes, it was powered down), holding a urlLink large metal flashlight in my left hand, then I brushed the back of my computer with my lip (don't ask how or why). Well needless to say, the computer and the flashlight completed the circuit or whatever, and boom. 250 watts exited out my shoulder (because above my desk was a lamp the electricity could go to) and left a nice burn circle the size of a silver dollar. Nice, eh? I'm a dumbass.

 SEARCH QUERY FOLLIES Today's search engine hit comes via "lark voorhies naked ass." People...please.

 FIRE Nothing like a nice urlLink controlled burn fire on an 85 degree day...

 AHH...WRIGLEY Went to the urlLink Cubs game yesterday. Going to Wrigley just feels like you're going home. There's nothing better. I took urlLink pictures from the excursion. I'm sitting here now with sunburned arms and face. Thanks Wrigley! [note: I HIGHLY recommend the "Rum Runners"]

 UGH, FEELING...FORDY I'm starting to feel like I need to take this damn site down. Time to scan a paper plate with child molestor hand writing.

 HOW TO MAKE A DELIVERY INTO A CIRCUS urlLink Kyle now has photos and video (yes...video) of the Little O up on his page.

 WELCOME Well, it seems the stork came early for urlLink Kyle and urlLink Sarah . Everybody welcome urlLink Owen urlLink Elliot urlLink Ford ... [more details later]

 THERE ARE SOME THINGS... ...that just never get urlLink old .

 THE OFFER THAT WAS REFUSED DAVE : urlLink Bru , Uma, urlLink Connie and I wanted to all pitch in for something nice for the baby, something beyond clothes, etc. When I asked urlLink Kyle , his response was, "The baby needs to learn about the mob. urlLink Godfather boxed set ." Do you need anything else or anything special for the kid? Like a changing table or car seat or something? SARAH : Kyle is such a slimeball. He won't REST til he has that f**king Godfather set and when he gets it he won't even watch it. He doesn't watch ANYTHING he has, he just buys them and then goes to Blockbuster every night to rent DIFFERENT movies. Spousal rage is great.

 HOW DO I GET ON THE COVER OF ROLLING STONE? It's a perfect night for driving. A little more gas, and I might have made urlLink it . You'll like this urlLink one , I promise. And finally, how do I get on the cover of urlLink Rolling Stone ?

 TWO WHITE SHIRTS Recently, urlLink The GAP ran a series of urlLink ads that were pretty much done in the typical GAP fashion. Popular people wearing popular clothes. We're used to this by now. Now I'm sure many people cringe and urlLink loathe these ads, however I am horribly and uncontrollably drawn to them. Allow me to begin by saying I am probably one of the last people to ever shop in the GAP. I've never owned anything with the GAP label, nor do I really ever plan to own anything from the GAP. And I'm not saying that their clothes are bad or they're appeal to "good looking" people is wrong, I'm just saying I own a white shirt and khakis, do I really need more? Now we've all seen the ads, there's one with crazy urlLink Ashton Kutcher (ad directed by urlLink Roman Coppola ) and another with delicious urlLink Kate Beckinsdale (directed by urlLink Cameron Crowe ). It was the third ad with urlLink Christina Ricci and urlLink Dennis Hopper that really grabbed my attention. The first act of brilliance with the " urlLink Two White Shirts " ad is simply the star power. What better way to sell things in today's celebrity craving culture, than with two very well known names. A subdivision of that brilliance comes in the actors selected. Christina Ricci is 22 years of age and she is there to capture the younger demographics, as where 66 year old Dennis Hopper is there to capture the attention of your parents. But enough of the statistical ad crap. Lets talk shop. Something I believe in very strongly is that if you can create a scene and tell a story in thirty seconds without the use of dialogue, you have that "thing" that makes great film directors, great. The "Two White Shirts" ad is directed by the Coen brothers ( urlLink The Big Lebowski ), urlLink Ethan and urlLink Joel . Now I've read a few different "theories" as to the meaning of the ad but none of them sound right to me. urlLink Connie read me an article from urlLink Cosmopolitan magazine in which readers voted that the character relationship in the ad is "sexually based." Ah, that's crap. Everything about the scene is simple, so why would the story be so complex? The ad starts with Hopper seemingly staring at us, the viewer. I believe he's just spacing out, waiting for his turn at chess. From there, the ad continues to simply show two people relaxing in their white shirts and khaki pants. See? Simple. Ads are designed to make us feel a certain way. This ads was designed to makes us believe we can relax next to a pool with lemonade in our GAP clothes...not have a sexual relationship with a 66 year old man. Black and white film is gorgeous. It always will be. It creates a depth and a texture to everything in a scene and at the same time eliminates everything that visually could distract from telling the story. There are no reds, blues, greens or any other colors that would distract us from looking at the actors and the bright, white shirts they are wearing. I love black and white, I always have. It has the ability to take on whatever feel you want it to have. And as always...it's cheap. Finally, there's the soundtrack. Each ad had two versions done, only the soundtrack changed. The first time I saw "Two White Shirts" the soundtrack was a song called "I See the Rain" by a group called The Marmalade, a British pop-ish type band. The second version of the ad had a song that fit much better. "Hang on to Your Ego" by the Beach Boys. When we hear Beach Boys, we think warm sun, golden beaches, we think California. There's something secure and comfortable with the Beach Boys that adds to the scene, we feel like we're there, like Dennis and Christina are our good neighbors and we've been doing this for years. But at the base of it all, the ads are brilliant for one reason. The concrete fact that I never consider going into a GAP store is radically shaken and suddenly I find myself looking at Dennis Hopper and thinking, "Goddamn, could I be that awesome if I just bought a shirt?" Of course I can.

 UPDATE I'm getting a haircut.

 TRAINING I think I'm going to start training my body to require minimum sleep this summer. I feel this is necessary to live a happy life. And I need a haircut.

 DRESS CODE I just want a job that will let me wear sandals.

 THE ARROGANCE OF THE TURN SIGNAL There's a growing trend within the driving communities of America, and frankly, I find it disturbing. The use of the turn signal to indicate the intentions of drivers is on the decline. And why? What is it that has swept across the millions and millions of American drivers that does not allow them the extra two inch reach to flip a lever up or down? Has the concept of the turn signal become too complicated? Perhaps there is a failure in the teaching stages where certain individuals have a "signal deficiency." Personally, I believe it's due to American arrogance. Now, I'm not saying you ALWAYS need to signal. For example, if you are in a turn lane, everyone else should already understand that it is your intention to turn. That's why you are in that lane. However, it is the persons who do not signal maneuvers, like right turns in traffic, where there is no turn lane. Suddenly, chaos erupts simply because one person decided they were too good to show people what they were going to do. I think the "get out of my way" attitude of the American culture has now leaked into even our basic driving skills. It's almost as if not signaling your intention to turn is the same as saying, "Halt, your life must be suddenly delayed so I can continue mine." Turn signals, at their most basic ideal, are a simple warning. And in a world where we are said to be growing farther and farther from individual personal contact, how great is a device that can tell everyone what you're thinking without having to talk to anyone and open yourself up to the world. On top of that, it's the law. In every community, a person can be ticketed if they do not signal their intentions. Obviously it's a minor offense and obviously local police departments have left this crime go unattended until it has reached epidemic proportions. How sad. Think about that one, every time you don't signal when you turn, you are committing a heinous crime. My fear is that this arrogance will blur the lines between the drivers who believe they rule the road, and those who should not be on the road. One who believes that they are too good for the signal should know that drivers passing by believe that they are simply too stupid to work such a simplistic device. Just remember that, you may THINK you look cool, but really...you just look like an idiot. I'll get off my soap box racer now.

 HOMETOWN HEROES I recently learned about a group of guys who created the film company, urlLink Lumberyard Productions . I just thought it was interesting that there was a very urlLink familiar story in all of this. There was an urlLink article written about a month ago in the News Sun and makes interesting reading for those who are interested. I wonder how open they would be in regards to bringing a fellow Libertyville film hopeful into the mix. At least I have someone to call in urlLink 240 days ...

 APOLOGY I would like to apologize for the banner at the bottom. Please bear with it.

In this box, you get special deals on random items for 60 minutes (the time begins when you open your box). Just go look for yourself. Anyway, I decided that maybe I'll post the strangest item in my "gold box," and today it was an easy choice... Today's oddity, urlLink The Ultimate Demolition Fireman's Battle Axe .

 I WANT YOUR JOB Instant message from urlLink Kyle : Kyle: can't talk now...i shit you not...tony hawk is outside skating on a halfpipe. back later.

 FUN That's what pixels are.

 I SHOULD WRITE SOMETHING - PART II That's a picture of a different scooter hopefully more acceptable to urlLink Mrs. Sarah . And sadly I just realized that I have nothing better to write about than scooters. How unbelievable sad.

 I SHOULD WRITE SOMETHING That's a picture of a scooter.

 THE WHEEZ So urlLink Weezer is coming to town and I really wanted to see them because their latest album, urlLink Maladroit , is their best since their debut album. Anyway, the kick in the nuts is that they're playing the single crappiest venue Illinois has to offer, the acoustically pathetic urlLink Tweeter Center in Tinley Park. Worst amphitheater EVER. The sound is terrible, the view is terrible and the entire complex is literally a band shell in a dirt hill. And I don't care how much you love a bad because the Tweeter Center makes everyone sound like an amateur garage band. I guess that's the price one pays for having a favorite band be popular. So much for seeing Weezer.

 IS THIS THING ON? Hello? Anyone?

 THINGS DAVE DISLIKES #921 urlLink Wisconsin .

 I NEED NEW FRIENDS A clip of an IM conversation I recently had. This may bring some of you to tears. Me: What browser are you using? Friend: I have no idea what that even means.

 THE QUESTION THAT IS ON EVERYONE'S MIND If we don't have sex, what do we do? Yesterday, while searching the internet for what some of urlLink us thought was a movie quote, I came across urlLink this most interesting web page. Now before I continue, the web page is apparently about alternatives to not only abortion, but the steps and "activities" that lead one down a road where abortion might be an option. The aforementioned web page in no way reflects the views of the sliozis.com management. I also don't care to turn this into a political forum about abortion either, just sit back, put the guns and bibles down, and try to find humor in this page. After reading the "If We Don't Have Sex, What Do We Do?" page, I was at first trying to figure out what age group they were targeting here. For example they talk about avoiding sexual situations like this, "Its like playing a video game. After a while you know the traps and the dangers and you take action to avoid them before you get blasted. Same thing here." Wow. I'm guessing that this was penned by some 36 year-old who is afraid of girls and spends his days counting down to the next urlLink Final Fantasy release. Video games? The site also teaches you great social tact when discussing "the sex" with a date. "Want some fun? Before you go out, bring up the fact that you are not at all interested in getting involved sexually." Yeah, that sounds like fun. "Hi, I barely know you but I want you to know now that the chances of us ever being intimate or me even seeing you naked are slim to none. And frankly, the idea of your bare bosom scares the crap out of me. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go play Final Fantasy." Nothing opens the door for a second date more than honesty. Then the authors of this page also tell you how to choose your friends and how disastrous peer pressure can be to your non-sexual self. "Thats why its important to choose friends who share your values. Then you will hear things from friends that reinforce your commitment, not wear it down. The same goes for people you date. If you know someone is a player or partier, dont go out with him or her. You are only setting yourself up!" Because you know, people don't change. So if you really like a "player" or "partier" they'll always be that way and basically try to have sex with you. We all know that all people who like to have fun are really just trying to get some ass. So I sent this page to average, white male, middle America guy, urlLink H.R. and he responded to the site like this: I asked myself why on all of these questions from that web page? "Dont leave blocks of time where you have nothing to do, especially when you are alone at home or in a car." Why not? You need to take the other person home sometime or another. The only way to avoid any sexual situation is having to park your car in the city (it's not fun) and when someone's home is filled with people. "Going out in groups insures that you will stay out of tempting situations." HOW???? All my friends talk and think about is sex. "Hand holding, hugging and kissing (that doesnt mean making out) are OK. But basically anything below the neck is off limits if you are serious about creating a pure, long lasting relationship." COME ON NOW! You start with the hand holding, hugging and kissing...which leads to everythign below the neck...am I right? You can't just dive right in no matter what your doing. Jesus H Christ...bring on the urlLink Domo-kuns ! For the record, I think H.R. ending with "Jesus H Christ...bring on the Domo-kuns!" was just brilliant. Anyway, the page continues and finishes up with "55 Fun Things to do Instead of Sex." I'm not even sure I can explain how bad this list is but I'm going to cover the highlights. And I'd also like to state that most of these are just starters for walking down the trail to fornication and sin. Lets start with " 5. Slide down a grass hill on a block of ice ," what the HELL is that? Where the hell does one even get a "block of ice" in the middle of summer? Next is " 13. Wash each others car ," woohoo. Or how about " 19. Dedicate a song on the radio ," there's twenty seconds gone, now what? " 27. Go to church together ," I don't need to comment on that one. " 28. Dress up and go to McDonalds ," dress up? As what? Or do they mean like suit and tie? Apparently whoever wrote this came from a town where Le McDonald's is the IT place to go. " 30. Send a funny card ," BAM, another twenty seconds, now what? This is probably the most retarded one, " 35. Chop up things in the blender and make 'food-art' ," what in God's name is "food-art?" Or there's " 39. Have breakfast at sunrise ," which to me says she was already AT your house which probably means this entire list was null and void. " 41. Spend an evening with each others families ," HA, if you only knew my girlfriend's family. " 44. Take a fun class at your community college together ," no. " 53. Blow up balloons and stuff a friends car ," which means HOURS of entertainment. And finally there's always, " 54. Have a canned whipped cream fight outside ," hello? Whipped cream? Jesus, if that doesn't lead to sex, I don't know what will. So really, I can't say that this page helped at all. And I'm wondering what kind of life the author leads if he or she believes that all of those things are "fun" and "innocent." And I'm also willing to bet that if it is a guy, once he finishes playing Final Fantasy he proceeds to stare at the urlLink Britney Spears poster on his wall and then urlLink kills some kittens . Thanks to urlLink Bess and urlLink Alison for the linkage.

 DON'T LISTEN TO STALIN KID! HE'S A PUNK! Nothing much to write about so far this week. I do have to ask, what the hell is a urlLink Domo-kun ? Because urlLink this amuses me (I believe urlLink this is the "picture" in question). Isn't the internet just messed up? And suddenly I feel as though my blog content has taken a turn for the worse...

 JACK BURTON AND THE PORK CHOP EXPRESS You just listen to the ol' Pork Chop Express an' take his advice on a dark and stormy night when some wild-eyed eight-foot tall maniac grabs your neck an' taps the back of your favorite head up against a barroom wall. An' he looks you crooked in the eye an' he asks if you've paid your dues. You look right back at that big sucker an' remember what Jack Burton always says at times like that. "Have you paid your dues, Jack" "No, sir, I've just charged 'em."

 I SWEAR, IT WAS LIKE FINDING AMERICA Picture this. Summer, 1997. You're cruising along, windows down, and listening to one of many classic rock stations that the Chicagoland area has to offer. There is a song on the radio, you are enjoying this song. Roughly six minutes later, the song ends. The station DJ makes no mention as to the name of the song. The song enters your head, and that's where it will remain, unnamed and untitled for the next five years. I first blogged about this song back in November of 2000. And at that time I thought I was on the right track until something terrible happened... Original Blog Date - 11/30/00 Since August I have had this song rattling around in my head. I heard the song on CD94.7, the classic rock station in the Chicago area. I don't know the name, I don't know the band that sings it, I don't even know any lyrics. I do know the tune and how the piano in it goes. That's all. So I made the active decision to listen to CD94.7 religiously until I heard that song and my quest would be completed with a quick dip into the Napster libraries. Well, last night something odd happened. CD94.7 was playing some 80's tunes, and I thought, "okay, they play blocks of some late 60's stuff, why not some 80's?" So today, I turn on 94.7 in my car and I'm horrified. They're still playing 80's tunes. I visit what WAS the CD94.7 homepage which is now the 94.7 THE ZONE homepage. I was suddenly numb. The one channel I knew for sure would eventually save me from this musical hell, was now gone. We already have an 80's station! Now we have NO classic rock, or not that I know of! ARG! The music gods have scorned me. Months would pass and eventually come to February of 2001. The song reared it's ugly head again... Original Blog Date - 01/31/01 Last night I heard that damn song again. This time however, I was able to get what I thought was the name of the song and of the band. I was in the car with Jeff on our way to see whatever movie (we saw "Anti-Trust," it wasn't too terrible) and on 94.7 (still The Zone) I heard it. The deejay said the song was "Not the Man You Think I Am" by Misunderstood. YES! I finally can get that song out of my head......right? WRONG! I did an extensive search of Napster, CDNOW, and whatever search browser I could think of and "Not the Man You Think I Am" by Misunderstood did not exist anywhere. I tried different variations of the song title, I tried just switching the song title with the band name. Nothing. What's worse is that now I'm not even sure it was the right song that I heard and it is going to drive me nuts until I KNOW! ARG! The music gods have scorned me. Please help me. Note: I did eventually find out that the non-existent song was " urlLink Misunderstanding " by urlLink Genesis and no where near the song I was in search of. I couldn't win. About two months ago, Connie and I had another encounter with this song and I thought I might finally have it. Connie was able to record the time the song played as well as the other songs that followed it on the playlist. So I promptly e-mailed whatever radio station had played the song and enclosed all the information I had. To this day, they still have not returned my e-mail. The search continued. Last night, Connie and I were driving to dinner and I was flipping radio stations. Then, the song came back to me once again. This HAD to be the final battle and I needed to win. We stopped at Blockbuster (because I forgot to place the urlLink Amelie DVD back in the case when I returned it, der) and Connie kept watch on the song. When we finally got to dinner, the song ended. Then it was the moment of truth... ...the DJ spit out the song title and the band and I was euphoric. I think I almost cried. The song was " urlLink Fool In the Rain " by urlLink Led Zeppelin . How lame did I feel? Regardless, we returned home and I immediately downloaded it from urlLink Kazaa . It was like the weight of a planet had been removed from my shoulders. And now that I have that song, it will grace the end of every mixed CD I will ever make. It took me five years to find. I think I can die happy now.

 LE FABULEUX DESTIN D'AMLIE POULAIN And somehow, that translates simply to " urlLink Amelie " in American. Last night, urlLink Connie and I rented the adventures of Amelie. We had been trying to catch the movie at one of our local urlLink art houses , but failed repeatedly due to the sweet yet evil curse of apathy. urlLink Blockbuster (not sure why I linked that) had an abundance of them, probably due to the fact that people aren't patient enough to read subtitles anymore. That's a sad statement (so is the fact that more people went to see the brain dead urlLink MIB2 than the potentially Oscar worthy urlLink Road to Perdition ...you apes). The first portion of the film does a hit and run feeding of background information about the childhood of Amelie. The beginning of this movie (gotta keep saying movie before urlLink Kyle rages) is probably both the funniest and saddest intro I've ever seen. We are shown the beginning of this little girl's life and the odd extremes that set her on way to becoming the Amelie of age twenty-three (the age she is for the duration of the film). Basically, Amelie is the story of a girl who realizes that there is no better feeling in the world than helping others find some small piece of happiness. However her weakness is that she can't seem to help herself. As much as she tries to overcome her personality and behavior (that we were able to see form in the movie's beginning), Amelie falls back and hides herself away. I'll say no more. urlLink Audrey Tautou has these eyes and this face, that you can't ever hate (don't trust that imdb.com photo either, it's terrible). There's this doeful look that gives way to a character who has an imaginative brilliance underneath it all and a bigger heart underneath that. Tautou gives Amelie everything she needs for the audience to just love her and she intoxicates us so much that we feel bad when we see her flounder. Tautou also keeps us believing that she is twenty-three and that she is at an age where she understands clearly what needs to be taken seriously and what other things can be enjoyed. If I say any more about Audrey, Connie will kill me in a blind rage driven by jealousy. The camera work is amazing, and it's even more amazing when you think that urlLink Jean-Pierre Jeunet also directed urlLink Alien: Resurrection . He went from space war to love story, those wacky French. And for awhile, I had heard that this movie was a French urlLink Alley McBeal and in the end, this film was CERTAINLY not that. Jeunet has a chemistry with the vision of the movie. The camera angles, colors, contrasts, special effects all give the movie almost a living comic book feel, if that makes any sense. Jeunet just has a wonderful choreography to Amelie that is almost like " urlLink Moulin Rogue " on handfuls of sedatives. And everything above is complimented by a really good soundtrack. It's piano heavy, which personally I love, and in most scenes it's hidden in the background somewhere. I'm a believer that soundtracks are an important part to movies. Most movies can use them correctly, others can't. Amelie is a great example of how music can play on your feelings and enhance the feel of a movie. Honestly, I hate writing movie reviews because I'm usually pretty bad at it. I think this was one of my worst since all I did was gush about the movie. I inject far too much of my own opinions, I usually feel like I have no idea what I'm talking about and I'm lucky if there is any organized thought. But if it makes any difference, I'm probably going to buy it on urlLink DVD , and to me, that means it's certainly worth renting. I'm pretty sure this review won't earn me a spot on the "balcony" with urlLink Ebert either.

 BACK FROM SOMEWHERE IN SANTA MONICA urlLink Bru and I are back in Illinois after our visit out to California. I didn't take many pictures or much video (I know I recorded it, just can't find it), but I know Bru has photos. Maybe he'll put the good ones online. Summing it up, I'm more miserable to be back than glad. I always forget how few things I care about here and how good my feet felt in the sand off the urlLink Santa Monica Pier . Chances are I won't be back in Los Angeles until it's time for me to go there for urlLink good . The closest I might come is San Fran, sometime in November. We'll see, that's getting really far ahead. Right now I'm going to go count my air miles and stare at the sun tan I got on my feet. Hustlers grab your guns Your shadow weighs a ton Driving down the 101 California here we come Right back where we started from

 FOR THOSE OF YOU KEEPING SCORE AT HOME Or those of you who are probably at work and not doing anything ( urlLink cough , urlLink cough , urlLink cough , urlLink sniffle ) and also for those of urlLink you who are supposed to come get us, you can follow urlLink Bruen and I as we fly across the US. This urlLink link takes you to a flight tracking page. Both flights are via urlLink United Airlines (UAL) and our flight schedule looks like this: FRIDAY, JULY 19th : UAL 131, departing 9am CST from ORD. FRIDAY, JULY 19th : UAL 129, departing 10am CST from ORD. MONDAY, JULY 22nd : UAL 108, departing 11am PST from LAX. I'm probably not going to post anything after this until I get back. And then I'm sure I'll have photos (none of which will involve me and a baby) and definitely video, plenty of video adventures.

 THREE UNRELATED ITEMS CRAMMED INTO ONE First, I put up a new urlLink movie . It's titled, "A Really Bad Joke and Dan Saves the Day." Second, has anyone else noticed that urlLink TBS Superstation has FINALLY dropped their obsession with starting every at five minutes after? They're actually starting their shows on time now. Never thought I'd live to see this day. And third, it's never too late to think about the urlLink future . BONUS ITEM: I'm not sure why but Prince's " urlLink Batdance " is stuck in my head. "And where, and where...is the Batman!?"

 REALLY BAD WORD PLAY GONE REALLY WRONG Alison: urlLink Kyle is making an "Owen: Special Edition" DVD. Dave: And a sequel called, "OWEN II: AFTER BIRTH" Dave: HAHAHA! get it? HAHAHA! Alison: LAME Sliozis. Lame.

 ADVENTURES IN IMOVIE I give you the urlLink first of many. I promise they'll get better.

 GOOD JOB PENGUINS Quite possibly, one of the best urlLink music videos ever. Link blatanty stolen from urlLink Ariel .

 PIECE OF MIND First let me note that my post titles as of late, have been really stupid. Anyway... Do you pronounce urlLink Reese's Pieces , REES-IZ or REES-EES? I've always said, REES-IZ because it rhymes with pieces . However, as of late around the office, I've heard the REES-EES pronunciation on the increase. Which is right? Plus REES-EES rhymes with feces. And that's bad. urlLink Is my Blog HOT or NOT?

 A MINOR DEBATE A debate is raging on over at urlLink Kyle's site about a pretty noticable flaw with the storyline of the movie, urlLink Minority Report . Feel free to weigh in about things, but make sure you read everything first so we're all on the same page.

 FULL OF HOT AIR a.) Yes, that is a terrible title. b.) Do we care that this urlLink guy flew a balloon around the world? I'm not sure that "Extreme Hot Air Ballooning" will catch on. I mean seriously, who cares? How much money did this entire ordeal cost anyway? And why couldn't he do something good with it like donate it to a charity? Instead he floats above the Earth where he can't shower and has to piss in a can or something. If someone comes to me and says, "Dave, here's a million dollars. What do you want to do with it?" Do you think my first answer will be, "Balloon around the world." Hell no. And on top of that, he didn't even really go AROUND the world. He went around like the southern-southern part, pretty much around Antarctica. Going "around the world" to me means around the equator. And right now, he's totally the 15 minutes of fame celebrity. In one week (if the idiot can land) no one will ever remember his name. Well, I hope he's happy. At least he did it this time and we don't have to even THINK about how much money our government spent to save his ass the five times before when he crashed into oceans and had to drift over no fly zones. I hope he gets a plaque or a trophy for this.

 I REALLY FEEL LIKE WRITING SOMETHING However, all I can write is, "I really feel like writing something." Ugh, how frustrating. I think the heavy regimen of bland papers in english classes and distracting atmospheres has destroyed what there was of a writer in me. I wrote some shitty script almost four years ago and that's been the highlight of my screenwriting career. Pretty frustrating when what is in your head can't make it to paper. Is it possible to have writer's block for six years?

 DOMO-KUN, CREATURE: ANSWERS THE FRIDAY FIVE 1. What's your favorite piece of clothing that you currently own? As you can see, me Domo-kun no have clothes. Me covered in fur. If I had clothes, me favorite piece be...umm, probably pants. 2. What piece of clothing do you most want to acquire? Oh, easy question. Me most want to acquire pants. Even Domo-kuns no always like to walk around with his no-no's in the open. 3. What piece of clothing can you not bring yourself to get rid of? Why? Why you ask Domo-kun such strange question? I tell you me no have clothes. You confuse Domo-kun. However, if Domo-kun had pants then Domo-kun NEVER get rid of pants. Especially if pants are corduroy. 4. What piece of clothing do you look your best in? Tuxedo. 5. What has been your biggest fashion accident? Eesh, look at me. Me no wearing pants. Domo-kun think that number one on fashion accident list. Do your own urlLink Friday Five .

 E. HONDA, SUMO: ANSWERS THE FRIDAY FIVE 1. What is your current occupation? Is this what you chose to be doing at this point in your life? Why or why not? My current occupation is "World's Strongest Sumo Wrestler." You can look it up. On the side I travel the globe competing in the Street Fighting contest in order to prove I am not only the strongest sumo, but the strongest fighter on the planet! [ E. Honda raises his massive arms in a show of triumph ] Is this what I chose to be doing? Yes, I guess it is. I mean I'm happy being a sumo wrestler and competing. The lifestyle is great, women, money and all the food I can get down. And really, what else is there for a sumo to do? I mean can you imagine me working at The GAP? 2. If time/talent/money were no object, what would your dream occupation be? Hmm, that's a good question. If time/talent/money were no object to me, I think I'd like to follow in the footsteps of that Lance Bass fellow [ E. Honda points his thumbs in some kind of dance ] and become an astronaut. Of course a guy like me would need to slim down quite a bit first, eh? Perhaps I'd even start the first sumo training camp on the moon. How great would that be? Without gravity, everyone could experience the rush of doing one of my famous "sumo headbutts!" 3. What did/do your parents do for a living? Has this had any influence on your career choices? My father was once a famous chef all across China and my mother was a waitress. During my father's traveling cooking show, they stopped into a restaurant for their demonstration. My father said, "A clumsy and beautiful waitress came crashing through the kitchen door spilling rice and teriyaki all over. Our eyes met, and the rest is history." My father is a wonderful cook and while I was growing up he had made me his official taste tester, [ E. Honda pats his belly and roars ] that would explain a few things, eh! WAHAHAHA! Anyway, my grandfather on my dad's side was actually once a great sumo wrestler, so all the plans were there for me to become the "World's Strongest Sumo Wrestler." 4. Have you ever had to choose between having a career and having a family? Oh yes, many times. I have to travel often for not only the sumo wrestling circuit but also to compete in the Street Fighting arenas. I can be gone for weeks at a time [ E. Honda shakes his head ]. But my family understands. They understand that it's my job to compete and one day they know that I will retire and be home with them. Plus the kids don't seem to complain every time I buy them a new Digimon toy! [ E. Honda roars again ] WAHAHA! You know what I'm saying! HAHAA! 5. In your opinion, what is the easiest job in the world? What is the hardest? Why? Wow, this is a very difficult question because even the simplest job has many difficulties. Even the origami folder gets many paper cuts. Now, if I were a sumo looking for another job, the hardest might be something like an airline steward. Those small aisles are a tight fight for me! Also being the leader of a country would be very hard. A sumo takes many knocks to the head during his career and the president must make great decisions that must be unclouded. The easiest job for a sumo? That's easy, official taste tester! [ E. Honda lets loose one more massive laughing that shakes the room ] HAAAHAAAHAA! DOOF-OY! urlLink Friday Five inspired by urlLink The PJZ .

 IT'S THIS BIG BUILDING, YOU CAN'T MISS IT So after living in the state of Illinois for 24 years myself ( urlLink Connie for 21), Connie and I realized neither of us had ever been to the Skydeck of the urlLink Sears Tower . So last night, we went. Unfortunately, night came and so did the clouds before we could get to the top so I didn't get all the pics I wanted. Please enjoy these anyway. urlLink Enter the album.

 WAGONS WEST And by wagon I mean my piece of crap Honda Accord. Anyway, due to financial woes this summer, urlLink Connie and I had to settle for a journey to Dekalb, Illinois. What lies ahead is a 92 picture photo album with some of the most gorgeous and splendid land that Illinois has to offer (and if you didn't catch the sarcasm in all that, read it again). I also want to apologize for the lame comments under the photos... urlLink Enter the album.

 MY FATHER LOVES CAPTAIN EO! I asked urlLink Bruen this morning how he thought my father (the guy on the right in the picture) would handle the wedding ceremony with his short attention span (and that is also where I get mine). Bru replied: " There is music, bright colors and a different langauge. To him, it will be a Disney musical. " Fantastic.

 GOOD-BYE SUMMER In just over a week, urlLink Bruen and Uma are getting married and urlLink Connie is going back to school. I guess this means summer is over. urlLink Best eCard EVER !

 WHAT'S WRONG WITH SAMMY SOSA? This post is in regards to the comment chain on my post from August 13th. It was decided that I should post this for four reasons. First, it's relevant to the conversation. Second, it's long. Third, it let me change my picture. And finally, urlLink Kyle hates posts about baseball. Enjoy this Kyle. 1.) urlLink Connie was right about the "removing urlLink Sosa " factor. You'd have to replace him with an imaginary "average" player like a urlLink Gary Gaetti and work the stats that way. Now, the urlLink Cubs , I'm sure, would still be hurting without Sosa. There's not questioning that. And the Cubs clearly do not benefit from having him because when 20 of your 40 home runs are hit with no one on base, that's bad. The other batters in the line up need to step up and do their job by getting on base. If there had been just one other runner on base during those 20 home runs, that's another 40 runs that could have benefited the Cubs in many games. 2.) Sosa's refusal to take the steroid test, whether he's on the juice or not, was a pretty bad PR move, no question about that. Unless he's afraid of needless. To me, that was along the same lines as the child who tells you he washed his hands for dinner and then refuses to show them to you. Automatically, it's safe to assume that there is something wrong there. And he may not be on steroids, he might be taking some other form of muscle supplement that maybe he's not supposed to. And urlLink Bruen is right too when he says we can't accuse him because we have no proof, however his behavior leads us to believe that there is something strange going on. 3.) Sosa is a home run hitter. He's built like it (obviously) and everything about his swing demands it. It's almost like everything that isn't a home run, is an accident. His motion remains unchanged whether he hits a home run or hits a dribbling single. Everything about Sosa is swing for the fences. And there's nothing wrong with that...unless, we go back to my number one. And this year, Sammy is also low in strike outs. If he keeps on track this could be his best year in that category in six or seven years. Sammy just needs to take it easy on occasion, shift his weight and just get that single. There comes a point where home runs won't win games. It's just getting a base hit with runners in scoring position. Again though, Sammy is doing well in that category, again it seems to be the rest of the Cubs who aren't giving the run support. 4.) I am a strong supporter of the drug testing in the MLB. Primarily because it's a job. And if I have to occasionally drop drawer and piss in a cup to prove myself, they should too. It's all about the image that it gives off. These players are seen by millions of people daily and have direct influence on the lives of kids. It's interesting to see these kids yell at the players just so they'll wave. But when they see it's okay to use supplements of any kind, there's a better chance that the children will do it to. So begins the trend. If someone from the news came to my business and said there were employees doing drugs or supplements, the reactions to it might be the same (if we were of a more celebritized status). People who know I work for this imaginary company might make the assumption I'm doing drugs. That's the nature of the media beast. The players, whether they want it or not, have the responsibility of being a role model. And the least they can do is piss in a cup to show that they're clean. Also, it's these supplements that have forced that bar to be raised repeatedly. Every player wants to be bigger and stronger because every other player is getting bigger and stronger. I think this is because the home run makes you famous. Does anyone really care about urlLink Randall Simon because he's having the best year of his career? Can you imagine a 220lbs. urlLink Ichiro ? Banzai. 5.) The entire focus of the Chicago Cubs organization is wrong. They love filling up those seats at any cost. Sammy Sosa is probably the MAIN baseball related reason that people attend games. Unfortunately a majority of ticket holders at games are there for the sole reason of getting drunk. I can't even tell you the last time I saw some one in the bleachers keeping score of the game, just keeping score with how many empty beer cups are stacked together. People go because there's a good chance they can say "I saw Sammy's home run," at the office water cooler the next day. The Cubs made some pretty poor player movement decisions in the off season and I only say that because I'm a believer in if-it-ain't-broke. I mean their pitching staff's ERA was one of the best in the MLB last year? Where are they now (Bere-what?) The Cubs brought aboard Moises Alou, who cost a lot and was hurt a lot. So far he's played 94 games this season and surprisingly squeezed 44 RBIs out of it. But the Cubs need more and they can't rely on aging- urlLink Alou . urlLink McGriff has been a huge help to the Cubs line up and has had a pretty decent year. However, he's 39. Even Sammy is starting to get old, but he's in good shape it seems. All we hear about are stories from the farm system. Bru referred to fabled urlLink Hee Seop Choi (I think I spelled it wrong but he probably won't be reading this). I think that since the Cubs clearly won't be pulling up from this nosedive safely, that they should get on the phone and get some of these kids in their farm system up to touch the grass at Wrigley. Let them play a few weeks, get their feet wet, begin a chemistry with their big league brothers. They have an opportunity to switch some players around and see who might be a good addition to next years team. The Cubs ARE being more aggressive about people on rooftops and packing seats than they are with trying to win. They've passed up several opportunities to bring players to the club that would benefit them, and just sit back quietly. That seems to be the Chicago curse. Overall though, I just don't believe that Sosa the premier player and the reason that the Cubs are surviving. I think the Cubs, if need be, could probably trade Sosa for a couple of players that would strengthen some of the holes in the line up. I don't think that Sosa plays for himself because he loves baseball ("Beisball has been berry berry good to me.") But on the other hand, when the Cubs suck, word starts spreading that he wants to jump ship. Grace stood neck high in water on that sinking ship for most of his career. Like urlLink Alison says, "He'll probably be a Yankee in two years anyway." And baseball is suffering all around. From players to the owners to the management and to the fans, the entire past time seems to be a disorganized mess. Side note: Sammy should certainly never entertain the idea of a film career after appearing in the movies, urlLink Kissing a Fool , urlLink Hardball and urlLink On the Line . Talk about bad PR...

 IT'S A LAZY OLD FISHERMAN DAY So I'm 24 now. Doesn't feel much different. Still broke, still mildly annoyed with my job, still hate my car, still living at home. urlLink Bruen reminded me this morning I'm supposed to die at 25. Thanks for that Bru. The birthday was delightfully uneventful. I managed to avoid the office party radar and just have a nice quiet day. I won't reveal what I got for my birthday because it might do some permanent damage to my urlLink Hot or Not score. Regardless, I am still thankful for the gifts, the cards, the well wishing, and the people who understood that I just like a quiet birthday. I need some new photos because I know you're all starting to think I like looking at myself over there. I placed second in urlLink The Frankenberry Monologues first annual (biannual? weekly? I don't know how often) urlLink haiku contest with this whizzer: "strong and silky legs with a voluptuous chest how i love your dad" Nice, eh? Next time, I'll take that first place title. urlLink Leaf is the urlLink Apollo Creed to my urlLink Rocky ... NOTE TO urlLink ALISON : My urlLink Great American Baseball Count needs to be updated to 9 to tie with urlLink Rehmer . However you may wait because I'm going to urlLink Cubs vs. urlLink Astros tomorrow to watch the 30 million-dollar-man suck it up again (for you non-baseball-ites, that would be urlLink this overpriced outfield decoration). I could rant about nothing for days.

 TWENTY-FOUR HAPPY BIRTHDAY ME!

 IT'S BE-A-SAMURAI-AND-CUT-UP-YOUR-WORK DAY Slice away! P.S. - urlLink Haiku your heart out.

 WHAT DO WE DO NOW? Yesterday, urlLink Alison posed an interesting question... Alison: "I wonder if we're going to get September 11th off." Now before you start filling her mailbox with angry "you hate America" mail, Alison's question is raised because her apartment is only a few blocks away from a clear view to where the World Trade Center once stood. Alison was in New York City that day and saw the aftermath. She's living and working in a city, where one year later, the events of that day are probably still echoing around the streets of the city. So what do we do now? How do we remember and mourn the events that occurred on September 11th? And we must remember that it was not only in New York City, but also in Pennsylvania and at the Pentagon. Do we mourn or do we just take this in stride? I'm sure there will be the moment of silence tributes. I'm sure there will be more than enough television coverage. I'm sure we'll all have to relive that footage of the smoking towers over and over and over... But that's all clearly not enough. So should there be a day off on September 11th? To me, the answer is both yes and no. In New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington D.C., I think the answer is clearly yes. The people of those areas saw and survived the most disgusting act to take place on American soil. New York is still rebuilding and I believe the Pentagon is also. The scars are still visible. Give those people the day to get away from things and just stand back to reflect and remember. Give them the day to return to the footprints of the Trade Center and pay their respects. As for the rest of us, while we still felt the effects, we weren't there. We stood behind televisions, we stood with ears to the radio, but we did not stand in those streets. Out here, to have the day off for most people would probably be just another day off. In the back of our minds we'd remember why we weren't stuck at computers all day, but I'm not so sure that the day would be used appropriately. It's a lot easier to forget the point when you're out and away from TV and media. It would be too disrespectful to say, "Yeah, since we don't have work tomorrow I'm going to go run some errands and pick up my dry cleaning." And then there's academic America. What do we do with the millions of kids? Of course, if you ask the question, "Should there be school on September 11th, 2002?" I have a feeling that at least 90% of those attending school (I'm including everyone from pre-school to college), would say no. But to me, wouldn't it make more sense to keep kids in school and teach them about this in a history class or just have an open discussion about it? There was so much to learn about with September 11th, everything from how our government works, to our military and all the way to topics like diversity and racism. I think there is a much greater benefit to keeping the kids in school for that one day, than there is to let them go run about not understanding what it was that let them have a day off. Right now, the company I work for is not granting us a day off for September 11th, and that's fine with me. However I have a feeling that too many people will be using it as an excuse to take a day off. I can understand that friends and families of victims would take that day to do what they had to. But honestly, we can all think of that one man or woman in our area where we work that would pull the, "I'm too sad to work" line only to go home and wash their pick-up truck. So what do we do now? We've all seen the plans devised by the architects that are going to turn the WTC land into an office complex/memorial, which is good an bad. Good because we're marking a spot where something happened and needs to be remembered, bad because the value of the land seems to take precedence over the point of a memorial. There will probably be debate for years to come about what we should do about all of this, but the bottom line is that no matter what it is, it has to be done with such careful respect. Thousands of innocent people died that day, that doesn't give you the right to go pay bills, wash your car and sit out in the sun. Alison: "But I can still remember like it was yesterday, looking at the buildings across the river, and as the wind shifted seeing the outline of the airplane in the side of the building."

 OKAY, SO I'M AN EGO WHORE That little square above represents what people seem to be thinking about my blog, or at least the few that rated it. Via another one of those trendy internet schemes, the urlLink Hot or Not people have created a forum for rating weblogs (I think these are the same people behind the brilliance of telling people they're ugly in the same urlLink fashion ). Regardless, I'm amazed that it is rated as highly as it is (even more amazing is the fact I don't think original web whore urlLink Pete Z. has picked up on this phenom yet). Anyway, I know you'll all do the right thing and urlLink give me a ten .

 A GENERATION OUT OF REACH Overheard at my dentist office this weekend: Man: "It was called urlLink Jay and Bob Return or something. I have no idea what the movie was about. It had these two pothead kids running around and swearing. It also had those urlLink Good Will Hunting guys in it. urlLink Ben Affleck seemed to play like six different characters. My wife and I were so confused, so we turned on urlLink JAG ." Okay, I added the JAG comment, but the rest of it was true.

 WISDOM urlLink Jeff's perspective on people asking urlLink Connie (she's 20) to go to bars. Jeff: "It's like asking Connie to use a urinal. You know she can't, so it's really not fair."

 THE NASDAQ SMAQ DOWN Last night I received my monthly financial statement telling me where I stand with my money in the stock market. I'm currently down $3,000 from my original investment. I now understand why my father was stealing my statements out of the mail before I could see them...

 TROPICAL STORM KYLE Currently, urlLink Tropical Storm Kyle is moving around the Atlantic Ocean. The characteristics of this storm are quick and unpredictable movements, strong hot air gusts, the inability to maintain a personal website, and a trail of empty beer bottles and devoured buffalo wings in its path.

 EVERYTHING I LEARNED, I LEARNED FROM JAG This morning I was approached by a 50-something co-worker looking for pre-work chatter. His topic of choice, the season opener for the television show, urlLink J.A.G. : CW: Did you catch the J.A.G. season premier last night? Dave: [ pretending to work ] Nope. CW: You know the Ensign on the show? The chubby faced guy? Dave: Not really. CW: Well last night he lost one of his legs in Afghanistan. Dave: [ fighting urge to say, "Did he find it?" ] Really. CW: You know, it could have been you over there. Dave: [ thinking, "Jesus" but said... ] Yikes. CW: Although I saw far worse in Vietnam [ and in the same breath ], man, J.A.G. is a great show. Dave: [ thinking, "Go away." but said... ] I'll have to check it out. I can't wait until I'm at the age when dramatic and quality television like J.A.G. triggers horrific memories for me.

 MICHAEL RAPAPORT, ACTOR: ANSWERS THE FRIDAY FIVE 1. What are your favorite ways to relax and unwind? Yo, first of all, lemme give a shout out to some of my boys in Brooklyn. Haha, give it up for my posse. Man, I got a lotta ways that I like to relax and kick it. First and foremost, I like to play basketball. Man I LOVE hoopin' it up. Second, I just love to wonder around New York City. It's like, people see me and even though I'm a big star and all, they just leave me alone. It's nice because they're not all up in my business. Oh, and I also like to watch some of my own movies. Man I love urlLink Palmetto . urlLink Elisabeth Shue was SMOKIN' in that movie. Yo! Elisabeth! Call me! 2. What do you do the moment you get home from work/school/errands? The first thing I do is check my answering machine to see if my agent called me about any new work. I mean who plays an under-educated New York, Irish punk better then Mike Rapaport? I think nobody. My agent says I'm "typecast." Whatevah that means. I mean did you see me in urlLink Palmetto , baby? That s*** ain't got nothin' to do with New York. 3. What are your favorite aromatherapeutic smells? Aroma-what-ic? Man, that's a whack word. Hey, you ever see urlLink Metro with me and my boy, urlLink Eddie Murphy ? Yo, that move was hot. Oh man, I haven't talked to Eddie in awhile either. Yo! Eddie! Call me! 4. Do you feel more relaxed with a group of friends or hanging out by yourself? Yo, I'm totally more comfortable when I've got my posse. Like when we were filming urlLink Palmetto , I used have two or three people hanging around me at a time! That's huge! I'm not really sure who they were, but yo, stranger people! Call me! We'll hook up and watch urlLink Palmetto for old time's sake. 5. What is something that you feel is relaxing but most people don't? Bam, first thing that comes to mind...playing the part of a under-educated New York, Irish punk. I mean, it's like it almost comes natural to me. And I love doing it so much that I try to add a little Big Apple Mick to every role I play. There are parts in my movies when I try to slip that bit in. Like you never see it coming when I do it in urlLink Palmetto and urlLink Metro . I just slide it in there. What's the next question? What? What do you mean "no more?" That's whack! Hey, call me! That was urlLink Michael Rapaport . We all need urlLink heroes . Do your own urlLink Friday Five .

 THE WOLF I just found a site that has a ton of lyrics and this was what the had for the intro to "Hungry Like a Wolf" by Duran Duran. It made my day. Ha ha! Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do And I'm hungry like the wolf

So in my need to do something, I'll be updating this movie list all day... 1.) urlLink Resevoir Dogs 2.) urlLink High Fidelity [Insert two hour nap here] 3.) urlLink Dolemite 2: The Human Tornado 4.) urlLink Amelie 5.) urlLink Major League Ugh.

 BILLY ZANE, ACTOR: ANSWERS THE FRIDAY FIVE 1. Would you say that you're good at keeping in touch with people? I'd say I, Billy Zane, am excellent in keeping touch with people. I'm proud to say that I keep in fantastic communication with my two friends. But forget that, let's talk about my blockbuster smash, urlLink The Phantom . 2. Let's not. Which communication method do you usually prefer/use: e-mail, telephone, snail mail, blog comments, or meeting in person? Why? Meeting in person is certainly my favorite way of communication, especially when it's with the ladies. I also prefer telepathic communication, just like the Phantom used in my movie, urlLink The Phantom , to communicate with my glistening white steed. I can't even begin to explain to you how much urlLink The Phantom impressed me. It was probably my strongest role since urlLink Back to the Future when I stood around and said nothing. 3. Do you have an instant messenger program? How many? Why/why not? How often do you use it? The only instant messenger program I have is called instinct, that's a little something I learned while training for urlLink The Phantom . I mean the entire basis of the movie was man versus nature and how the power of nature, or three magic skulls, should not be abused by man. This is what urlLink The Phantom was sworn to protect. 4. Do most of your close friends live nearby or far away? They seem to live very far away. I think after the success of urlLink The Phantom , they were a little worried about being in the spotlight. I mean it took it's toll on me. When a movie is that well done and that well written, the spotlight comes in brighter than ever. I think a lot of the people that worked on urlLink The Phantom are still to this date hiding away from the spotlight. I mean, look at urlLink Kristy Swanson , she hasn't been able to do a movie that came anywhere near the caliber of urlLink The Phantom . 5. Are you an "out of sight, out of mind" person, or do you believe that "distance makes the heart grow fonder"? Oh, for me, I'm completely the "out of sight" type. I put such disasters as urlLink Tombstone and urlLink Titanic behind me, because those are the types of movies that destroy an actor's career. But movies like urlLink The Phantom will make you a film legend. Just remember my credo..."W.W.T.P.D?" or, "What would urlLink The Phantom do?" Thank you urlLink Billy Zane . Go get a job. Do your own urlLink Friday Five . Author's Note: In addendum to last week's "Friday Five" with Christopher Walken, I have post " urlLink Can Tag: The Movie " featuring Mr. Walken.

 CHRISTOPHER WALKEN, GOD: ANSWERS THE FRIDAY 5 1. What was/is your favorite subject in school? Why? My favorite class, subject , in school was one that challenged both mind and soul. There is a deep fondness in my heart for, Geography . I mean, you get to see the world , learn of strange places, see magnificent places that you would never get to see. Then I became an actor, and I could visit these places I learned of. For urlLink Sleepy Hollow , we went to England. Do you have any idea where England is? It's somewhere to the East, very far. 2. Who was your favorite teacher? Why? My favorite teacher was the bombshell Ms. Valentino in my 5th grade math class, a bombshell . But truly, the greatest teacher, is life, experience . If you want to learn how to build a house, build a house. Don't ask anybody , just build a house. I mean look at the character urlLink Max Shreck , I don't think he learned anything. 3. What is your favorite memory of school? My favorite memory from school, ah this is brilliant. One time , in the 4th grade, Billy Jacobs and myself were having a classic showdown in the contest of marbles . Do kids play, marbles , anymore? Anyway, the young Mr. Jacobs came out to the be victor of the challenge. So the night I rode my bike to his house, I pithed the family tabby and wrapped it in an empty marble bag. It had to be done, do you understand? Had to be done. 4. What was your favorite recess game? Oh recess. That was the time when the boys could be boys . Around recess time, some of the older neighborhood boys would come to the playground . They taught us games , like, "Ditch the Pigs," "Sell the dope ," and my favorite , "Gang Initiation Beating." Very exciting that game. Once, when I was a 5th grader , I kicked a 2nd grader within a inch of his life. Very exciting. To this day, I don't think he found all his teeth. 5. What did you hate most about school? I loathed the other children. Their nice clothes, fancy shoes, I hated their laughing . I hate the laughing... Mr. urlLink Christopher Walken everyone. Do your own urlLink Friday Five .

 WELL CALL ME MR. BUTTERFINGERS Within the corporate cubicle community, it's a sure thing that people will try to decorate their areas with personal items or any small, sad relic that somehow makes them feel like being at work is ALMOST like being at home. These people are called "sad." But that's getting off track. I work within the confines of what is the "Health & Safety" department of my HUGE corporation. Someone dies on the job, we know about it. Someone severs a limb, we know about it. Someone gets a papercut, we know about it. You get my point. Essentially, we keep track of the people who think sticking their arms in heavy machinery is a good way to fix it. We're also the ones who say, "Don't touch those sharp edges," and "Don't run with vats of acid." Okay, I'm still off track. The lady who sits in the cube next to me ventured off to Seattle one weekend and found herself in a store that dealt in oddity antiques. She came across a mirror that she purchased and then quietly hung in her cubicle. The mirror itself is surrounded by eight illustrations: a man with his arm stuck in a meat grinder, a man with his wrist being severed by a urlLink band saw , a man being electrocuted by power lines, an explosion at a factory, molten steel raining on a couple of guys (my personal favorite), a box at a shipyard about to crush some workers, a plane wreck, and a sinking boat that just happened to be in shark infested waters. I've linked a few pictures so that you can see the carnage up close. urlLink 1 | urlLink 2 | urlLink 3

 KHAN, ANGRY SPACE GUY: ANSWERS THE FRIDAY FIVE 1. What is your biggest pet peeve? Why? My biggest pet peeve would surely be that blasted Captain James T. Kirk. We have quite a history you know. That bastard had me exiled to a desolate planet, then I tried to kill him. Oh, and I LOATHE screaming babies in restaurants. Come on, I almost defeated the flagship of Starfleet, how hard can it be to control your kids? 2. What irritating habits do you have? Gee, I don't know. I'd say my temper. And some people have told me when I'm angry, I get to dramatic. Apparently at sometime I yelled out, "From hell's heart, I stab at thee. For hate's sake, I spit my last breath at thee." Honestly, I don't even know what that means. And then there's the hostile take over of planets, my hatred of select individuals, and I chew with my mouth open. 3. Have you tried to change the irritating habits or just let them be? Yes I have, on several occasions. But no matter what, I just find myself chewing away, mouth WIDE open. It's terrible, I think people lose respect for me because of it. I also tried yelling, "I'm going to KICK your ASS!" when I was upset. However there's something lost in the message there. 4. What grosses you out more than anything else? Why? I do this thing with these worm-like creatures, where I put them in someone's ear and they allow me to then control my victim's minds. That's not gross, however the clean up AFTER the worms exit is the NASTIEST s*** you have ever seen. It's all gray and slimy and if you get it on your clothes, that crap doesn't wash out. It's just gross. 5. What one thing can you never see yourself doing that other people do? Well there's that whole obeying authority thing, but other than that, I'd have to say...dance clubs. The thumping music, the flashing lights, the grinding pelvis'. Oh man, that kind of stuff is totally not for a guy like me. Someone would probably make me spill my beer and the next thing you know, I'm miles above Earth getting ready to photon torpedo the joint. I'll steer clear of those places.

 SOME THINGS NEVER CHANGE Semi-related to the high school topic of yesterday, I decided to be daring and scan in my senior photo from 1996. Needless to say, a few things have changed and probably for the better. And for the record that IS the 1990's classic haircut style, the "bowl cut." urlLink then | urlLink now And just for kicks, there's always the grade school years... urlLink Pre-school | urlLink Kindergarten | urlLink 1st Grade urlLink 2nd Grade | urlLink 3rd Grade | urlLink 5th Grade

 SOME 3650 DAYS LATER So last week, urlLink Mac e-mailed me with a web page category question, and the conversation eventually came to the topic of our ten year reunion. In just about three months, the graduating class of urlLink Libertyville High School , urlLink class of 1996 , will be getting some form of strange invite from some small faction of our class that has been eagerly anticipating this day since we got our diplomas. What's even sadder perhaps is the fact that I can picture some of them, still donning their LHS orange and black cheerleading outfits, huddled around a table going, "Eew, do we have to invite him/her/them?" Am I alone in thinking that ten year reunions aren't what they used to be? I'm sure that back in the day, people had reunions because they didn't have the extensive abilities to communicate with each other like we do today. They had the long lost art of the post office. I'm sure in the 40's and 50's, I would have lost contact with Kyle or urlLink Bruen or urlLink Jeff . But now they're just an e-mail away so I don't need a reunion to catch up with them. The entire nature of the reunion has changed. It ends up being one of those "life reminders" like weddings* and babies*, where you sit back and mumble, "Jesus, I'm getting old." Now it seems like the reunions are almost there as a comparison of status. "What have you done in ten years?" I know my personal story isn't that great and sometimes I'm pretty embarrassed by it. I should have been doing better things by now, but that's a whole different rant. Regardless, there's always that feeling of underachievement that will bind itself to the ten year reunion with me. And maybe it isn't so much that I dislike comparing myself to other classmates, than it is realizing that I'm way off my path. Ugh. Anyway, for the same reasons I loathe seeing people I graduated with in public, I loathe the idea of going to the ten year reunion. The fact that we have to replay the last ten years of our lives over and over and over and over and over. I mean 99% of the people that I graduated with, I haven't kept in touch with...for a reason (does anyone really know where Phil Erisman went?). If I haven't talked to you in ten years, what makes you think I want to talk to you now? I can hear urlLink Kyle giving me his "burning bridges" speech again after this. What's the appeal in trying to talk to people that I barely had anything in common with for four years, and then trying to do it again ten years later? It kind makes me think of prom. People getting together, listening to the trendy music of the time. You know we're going to listen to endless Pearl Jam tracks sprinkled with the one hit wonders of the day. Everyone probably dressed real nice to impress the others and then within an hour, all those little high school "cliques" come back and people separate. But I never went to prom. I told Mac that the chances of me attending the ten year were pretty slim, and if we were to go, we'd be going in a certain urlLink style and I would most likely be packing "heat." My bundle of friends seem undecided right now, but I'm pretty sure most of us will have reasons not to go. I guess I still have three years to make myself feel worthy of attending the reunion so don't cross me off the list just yet. [ Talking to his psychiatrist about his high school reunion .] Marty: They all have husbands and wives and children and houses and dogs, and, you know, they've all made themselves a part of something and they can talk about what they do. What am I gonna say? "I killed the president of Paraguay with a fork. How've you been?" * Note related to weddings: At the recent urlLink Bruma wedding , they played urlLink Peter Gabriel's , "In Your Eyes." Kyle and Sarah had a conversation worth recording. Sarah: I like this song. Kyle: I like it a lot too. Sarah: You should, it was our wedding song, you f***. Sweet bliss.

 SLOW Nothing new to report.

 METAL UNDER TENSION, BEGGIN' YOU TO TOUCH AND GO On August 26th, urlLink Connie and I were staying at the urlLink Hilton for the urlLink Bruen /Swamy wedding. In the hotel room, there was a "pseudo-wall" that divided the main room from the bathroom area. This wall had an eighteen-inch gap between the top of the wall and the ceiling. The night before, I talked a big game about being able to make the jump. I even placed a wager (that I'm yet to repay) that I could make the jump. urlLink Some were with me, urlLink others were against. So what happened?

 KNOWLEDGE IS POWER Or at least it should be, right? I mean logically, those individuals who know more about the universe and its workings should be nested proudly above the rest of us on the brain-chain and we should simply be awed by their wisdom. But somewhere along the trail of history, someone in corporate America said, "Screw that, it's how long you've been somewhere that makes you a leader." Well...that's pretty much bullshit. I work in an area, surrounded by PhDs and Mds who have been schooled by some of the most prestigious universities the United States has to offer. I think there are even some have to gone to universities outside of this country. There are people here who know medical and chemical science like it's everyday conversation, how the body works or how many hydrobonds (if there is such a thing) hold the world together. Regardless, a majority of the employees in this area have proved themselves degree-worthy at some pretty high levels. Now in my mind, these people should clearly be higher in the corporate food chain than myself, a two-year community college grad (it took me six years to do that, mind you). And by all means, they also deserve the higher levels of pay, right? You know more, you get paid more, you go farther in the company. Makes sense to me, that's the way the business beast works. But if this is the case, that the smarter people are paid more and are "higher ranked," then why do I deal with the following scenario on a daily basis? Dr.: Dave, if you have a moment, could you please come help me with a computer problem? Dave: [ knowing FULL well he should say he's busy ] Sure. Dr.: Okay, I keep clicking print, but nothing is printing. Dave: [ noticing the blinking green light on the printer immediately ] You're out of paper. Of course the Dr. lets out the "oh silly me" laugh and I go back to my desk knowing full well that this person makes somewhere in the six-figure range, while I scrape by in the low $20,000 area. Technology is the ultimate weakness of 90% of upper management around here and that makes me wonder if it's the same all over America. I've saved countless e-mails, spreadsheets and presentations from hands of "Dr. Techno-Challenged" and for what? So I can proudly be the bottom of the food chain? The guy over there who could probably do open heart surgery on a lunch table with a spork, is rendered a complete idiot when it comes to replacing a printer toner cartridge. Why is that? The vice president who has to present the annual figures of the department to the head of the company can't figure out how to make his font color yellow. It awes me. We of course do have the standard "information systems" (the IS people) area which is just a nice way of saying, "high paid geeks," and they of course could assist in all the areas I assist with. But in our company, each division acts like it's own business. For the IS people to come out and install a program on your PC, it costs $50. WHAT!? $50 for some chimp to put a CD in, click okay and watch it for three minutes? What is THAT about? I'm the savior. I save the people here that $50 every time they need something installed or moved or setup. I've probably saved thousands of dollars. Yet, no one really cares. Web design and graphic design are also handled by other departments and both come at a HUGE price. So they come to me. I make a web page, I make a conference logo. Does anyone care that I just saved probably $3,000? Nope. I think I'm getting away from my point, I apologize. Knowledge isn't power anymore. No one cares what you know, just how long you've been doing it. It's probably safe to say that most college grads actually know more than the people who have been around for 15 to 20 years, but it's experience. Experience is power. No one cares of you can delete the entire contents of a corporate division's shared drive, they just care if you've been around ten years. You could be the all knowing Christ, but if you've only been with the company for two years, sit there and shut up.

 I had a revelation today in regards to all the junk e-mail in my inbox. I was reading what they were all offering and there seem to be three basic types of spam mail. 1.) Porn 2.)

If anyone is going to help me with my money, it's not someone I found via spam mail. And why would I order medication online when I can drive a block to one of the thousand Walgreens or Sav-ons in this city? I just don't get it.

 About a month ago now, urlLink Blender released its list of the "Worst Songs of All Time" or something like that. Connie and I watched urlLink VH1 Most Awesomely Bad Songs yesterday, which was done with Blender. While most of the choices were indeed horrible songs, they didn't have anyone on to defend why the songs are awesome. Connie and I disagreed on many of their picks. One of my personal all time favorites, "Final Countdown" by Europe, made the list (number 16). If you break down the song by sections, for example: it's synthesizer heavy, lyrically hilarious, and vocally nothing special, it's a bad song. But when you put them all together, it's one of the GREATEST 80's rock songs EVER! I want it to be played while they're lowering me into the ground during my funeral! And "We Built This City" by Starship as their number one? Please! Dear VH1 & Blender, You're both fools. Do you not remember disco? How could Starship even make this list with an entire decade of horrible music out there? We built this city on rock and roll and you're no longer welcome! And VH1, leave urlLink Best Week Ever on the table on your way out. Sincerely, - DMS

 The problem with moving 3/4's of the way across a continent is that moving things tends to be an issue. For example, most of my once illustrious CD collection is now floating in a magic void between Libertyville, Illinois and Los Angeles, Cali. I'd say roughly 1/4 of my collection is either an empty CD case with no matching CD or a CD with no matching case. Orphaned by my poor packing before I left (okay, there was no packing). Stone Temple Pilots, Core, if you're out there, stay strong. I'll find you.



 urlLink This album was on display in a hodge-podge of crappy CDs near the checkout line at Ralph's on Thursday. I almost bought it.

 And no. This isn't the over-hyped site that I had envisioned in my head. urlLink Guess who talked me into getting this thing up again? And on top of that, I've rejoined the urlLink Blogger family. As you can see, the last time I used Blogger was almost a year and a half ago, and there's a ton of really, really, really poorly written crap under this post. I beg you not to look. So uh, yeah. Hi.

 ...and I hate them even more when they're in movie theaters. We just went to go see Spider-Man 2, and I know, it's opening night. That was our first mistake. The Buckle was super psyched to see the movie, so I said, "Sure, why not?" Now, I've given up the practice of going to opening weekends a long time ago because that's when all the stupid assholes who think it's funny to hoot and holler and talk decide to go. And sure enough, even though I silently hoped and prayed that the price of $11.00 a ticket would somehow magically keep said-assholes out of my theater...it wasn't to be. Of course there was this jackass who thought it was funny to yell, "WOOOO!" every time Spider-Man did something spiderish, and his douche-troop of merry idiots laughed everytime. So tonight, I propose a new idea. Forget getting the theater to give you your money back, it's not their fault. From now on, I'm going to find a way to sue all these assholes for my eleven bucks. This also goes for constant talkers, loud children, cell phones, and people who bring babies to loud movies. Oh, and anyone from the age of fourteen to eighteen who don't have a job or aren't accompanied by parents. And while we're talking about things that I hate, let me mention the worst ad campaign EVER, the urlLink Fantanas . Go ahead, urlLink Sarah , what are your thoughts?

 Roadface, I wrote my last letter to you on urlLink Thursday night about how you're basically rude and disgusting. I just wanted to add total moron to that list. YOUR LAUNDRY IS STILL ON TOP OF DRYER FROM THURSDAY NIGHT, YOU FREAK! Good LORD. - Dave [THE WORST UPDATE EVER - 9:32 AM: I stepped out my front door and Roadface is sitting at her dining room table (which is inexplicably next to her front door), and though her door I heard her say on the phone, "Michael, I had [relations] with him last night." One of these days I'm just going to cry out, "I CAN HEAR YOU!" She also FINALLY got her laundry and proceeded to leave both the laundry room door open and the security gate which would allow just any passer-by to come steal all our clothes that are in the wash. I'm SO calling the landlord Monday. Ugh. I'm buying a house. ] [PISSED OFF UPDATE - 12:58 PM: So I go to get my last load out of the dryer and my wet towels are sitting miserably in my basket. Roadface took it upon herself to take my towels out of the washer so she could start laundry. It's still going to be another hour before they're done. And of course, she left all the damn doors and gates open! Mom, Dad...if you're looking for me, I've been arrested for assult. ]

 To our dearest neighbor, Roadface: A few years ago, I was living at home. In this home, I had a brother. My brother and I have always led very different lives and this led to many battles about how my lovely brother really had no respect for the people around him and could care less that he was bothering me with his loud music late at night and screaming alarm early in the morning. I clearly remember thinking, "I can't wait until I move out because people don't act like this in the real world..." Well, I'm an idiot. You, Roadface, have single handedly taken my hopes and smashed them into millions and millions of really sad pieces. You slam your door every time you go in or out of it. You're home all day and yet you start laundry right as the rest of us, who work for a living, are arriving home. You play your horrible, horrible, HORRIBLE music (Michael Bolton, Enrique Iglesias, Paula Cole, etc.) to an almost embarrassing level. You leave all the security gates open and the laundry door allowing anyone to just come and go. You have "relations" with your male friend...in your living room...with the patio door open...so we can all get ill at once imagining what's going on over there. And to top it off, you left your "unmentionables" in the dryer when it was my turn to use it and I had to touch your stuff to put mine in. Just...nasty. Sincerely, Dave and Connie

 urlLink Kyle mananged to score a couple of passes to see an advanced screening of urlLink Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle . All I'm going to say is that America is not ready for such incredible use of cheetahs and urlLink Neil Patrick Harris .

 There's no other word in the human language right now that makes me as randomly furious as the word "carbs." You know what? Wheat was one of the first grains man learned to grow and harvest. We've been eating carbs for millions of years and for the most part, we've been just fine. And then dead Dr. Atkins comes along and makes people forsake our history. I'm actually thinking of marketing a line of food and beverages that are TWICE the amount of carbs than normal foods. It won't sell at all, but it's the principle of the matter.

 The Exploding Blender/Food Processor/Mixer. You know the gag. "Oh crazy! I'm either a fool in the kitchen or someone said something shocking and I turned the blender on and it spewed all over!" Bury it. Deep.



 Aside from the lame and obvious title of this post, today is my last day on the job before I move to bigger things on Monday. It feels weird because I've never really moved up in any job before. I'm sure that feeling will be long gone when I'm a VP in two years.

 Just saw the Olympic torch go by our building. Sometimes being 21 stories up has its benefits.

 One of the negative aspects to finally moving out of your parents house is that there's no one around you can sucker into taking your car to the mechanic during the day. Sunday evening, my brakes began to emit that shredding metal sound that says, "Hey buddy, it's time to replace the brakes that were probably factory issued on this car." So I called around on Monday, and for whatever stupid reason, every brake repair place in Los Angeles is only open during the hours I work (hence the call for the urlLink personal assistant ). Due to this, I put together a series of tactics that you can follow to make getting your brakes fixed almost free. Soundtrack - Find a CD that you really like to blast in your car. Make sure it's good and loud when you drive, that way you can't hear the squeaking. Then you can say, "I don't hear any noise, just the ROCK of TESLA!" Eye Contact - Chances are that everyone around you is going to know that you need your brakes fixed. When people hear that noise, they instinctively seek out the source. When you see their eyes casing traffic, just don't make eye contact with them. If you don't admit you have a problem, then you don't really have a problem. Camoflauge - This is based on the "ugly friend" principle. Find a car in far worse condition than yours and stick near it. When you brakes squeak, people are going to think it's coming from the rust heap. Strategy - The most obvious plan is to stop as little as possible. Your brakes won't scream if you don't use them, right? This opens the doors for fun games like, Am I Going To Rear End You? and Don't Mind My Rolling Stop . And don't forget my personal favorite, Red Light Means Step On It!

 urlLink YEEEEEEEEEEAH! Lakers SUCK!

 " I've seen a lot of L.A. and I think it's also a place of secrets: secret houses, secret lives, secret pleasures. And no one is looking to the outside for verification that what they're doing is all right. " - urlLink L.A. Story Los Angeles is great because it seems that the city moves at its own pace, writes its own rules, follows its own trends. But at the same time, this individualism leads to some behavior that just doesn't make sense and there's no one around to say, "What? Are you stupid?" I've compiled a list of current trends that the country of Los Angeles hold dear to them and I've noted why these things are not as cool as Angelinos believe they are. If you see something I'm missing, feel free to urlLink e-mail me. BMWs - Back in the Illinois suburbs, BMWs meant you had some extra cash and could afford a cushy ride. Out here, every idiot and their mother drives a BMW. The SUV is to the Midwest as the Beemer is to the West Coast. And most of the time, they aren't even new BMWs. They're lower end models or ten years old. The Lakers - Yeah, they suck. Get over it. All you damn Lakers fans who think they're the greatest team ever need to shut up and listen. First of all, you're doing it with OUR coach. Phil Jackson took a team of no-names (except for Jordan and Pippen) and took them to the top several times. So far, Phil hasn't done so well out here. Second, the Lakers organization was just trying to buy a ring. Their line-up reads like an all-star roster. There's no heart to your win. There's no John Paxton forcing up a gorgeous last second three pointer. Valet Tickets - When cars get the royal treatment out here, they put a little tab under the wiper blade of your car. And some people just think it's cool to leave that stupid little stub there. "I was able to afford valet parking this weekend, meh." When you can get valet parking at any mall out here, it's not that cool. High Heels and Blue Jeans - It's the weekend...at the grocery store...why are you trucking all over in those nasty, pointy-toed heels? They make your butt stick out and you make a lot of noise when you walk. Just because you're wearing heels does not mean you're making buying milk any more sexy. Name Droppin g - You're in Hollywood. Of course you're going to see celebrities or know a guy who knows a guy who knows someone. So what if you interviewed urlLink Peter Gallagher or urlLink Rachel Bilson was climbing all over you like a monkey looking for a banana. Get over yourself. Von Dutch - Yeah, it's dead. It's been dead. Trucker hats, sweatbands on the forearms, uggs, they're all dead. Talking Loudly on Cell Phones - More specifically, doing it just so people know you're talking to someone. We get it, you have friends. Congrats. Now shut up and go away. Avocadoes - They're everywhere, that's great. But just STOP putting them on EVERYTHING! I do NOT what avocado on my BLT. I know they're supposed to be good for me, but just stop trying to sneak them into my food. Partying Like You're 22 - You know what? You're 42. You don't fit in those clothes and chances are you look like hell when you're drunk. Go tuck your kids in. Script Deals - You've got one? That's great. I mean really, that's so awesome. Wow. Neato. Really? You're from the Midwest also and you've always dreamed about breaking into showbiz and your agent is shopping your script around? Oh wow, and you're working the mailroom at Paramount? Wow. Paramout. I'll see you at the top my friend! Script deal = "I'm paying $1200 a month for a bachelor apartment that I can barely afford by delivering pizzas in my Geo Storm." Ashton Kutcher - He's not funny. He's not even that good looking. Quit drawing attention to him and he'll go away.

 Due to my crazed Hollywood lifestyle, I have decided that I need to hire a personal assistant. Please send me your resume if you're interested in this once-of-a-lifetime opportunity.



 Kyle and I were out in the hills today with an appointment to meet one of Hollywood's A-listers (but due to current and on going stipulations, I can't tell you who). This is the view from just below his house. In the end, we had to cancel the meeting (to be rescheduled) because while we were out there, his assistant called and said, "Evidently he's getting on a plane." That's gold. Eccentric gold.

 Jeff: Ray Charles died. Dave: So I see. I guess you could say, he never saw it coming. Dave: SHABLAM!

 I just gave away my last urlLink Gmail invite without getting anything urlLink I wanted . I'm a pushover.

 Oh, Sarah. Not urlLink again ...

 Looks like I've got myself THREE TWO ONE urlLink ZERO Gmail invites ...Sorry, all gone. Who's interested? Not sure what I'll start the bidding at yet though... urlLink Hmm ... urlLink Hmm ... urlLink Hmm ... urlLink E-mail me . Oh! Or a urlLink sweet board .

 Here's a urlLink gallery of all the pictures I have taken so far with my phone. I lead a sweet life.

 I bought urlLink Jumpin' Jack Flash on the lot today. In future news, Connie ran me down with the car.

 High points, or low points, of the evening: 1. Kyle constantly referring to his poker guide. 2. Kyle holding his cards like a woman as he refers to the guide. 3. Kyle not being able to deal cards and forcing others to get their replacement cards. 4. Kyle on his knees pushing a large, metal Tonka truck, then asking "Who am I?" We all stare as he replies, "Owen!" Then, in an act of God, Kyle stands up, kicks the Tonka truck which destroys his foot and proceeds to fall all over the dining room. God is great. 5. Sarah laying down her cards and saying, "Two queens." Kyle then instinctively saying, " urlLink Two Princes ." 6. Sarah repeating, "You ARE Gary Ford!" somewhere near 100 times. I can't wait until next weekend.

 ...Or urlLink TBS if you prefer. TBS Superstation unveiled its new logo this week, and all I can think of is that the bottom half of the logo is to celebrate urlLink Kim Cattrall's horrifying chest in that show made for desperate chicks.



 Kyle celebrates his freedom. Buckle celebrates his sweet chicks (I don't know why he looks so freaky).

 Where else could I seriously say, "Today at work a guy named The Buckle hit me in my bathing suit area with a boom mic?" Seriously. Can you say that about your job?

 Kyle's last ride. Kyle's last ride looking at Kyle's last ride.

 [ SCENE: Last night, 11pm. Dave and Connie are conversing when the following moment occured. ] DAVE: "Rectum!? Damn near killed him!" CONNIE: Oh my God...I seriously just got that one. Connie Sommerville ladies and gentleman! [ slow clap ]

 For the first three weeks I had my new cellphone number, I was getting this crazy phone number on my caller ID. It was one digit longer than normal so I believe they were international calls. So I picked up one night and said "hello" about three times before I heard a quiet little, "hola." I must have said, "wrong number" in reply to a few more "hola's" before I blurted out "numero incorrecto!" After that I saved the number in my phone's phonebook as "Numero Incorrecto" and I'd shake my head and say, "Numero Incorrecto, when will you learn?" Numero Incorrecto hasn't called lately. I hope they're okay.

 Wow. Nomar is a Cub. So, I've been doing the best I can to keep up with our beloved Cubs even though I'm way out here. The fact that I can watch Chicago's FOX Sports Network at work is a big part of that. But here comes my opinion and my questions for you back home. First, I've always been a fan of Nomar's. I think he's got a big heart, a consistent bat and is a great shortshop. He's also been pretty injury free in the last few years aside from his big injury at the start of this season. But did they really need a shortstop? I thought it was no secret that the Cubs relief pitching staff is their weakness, shouldn't they have found some people to plug that hole? Second, we all know I don't like Sosa and this is a great chance for all those wannabe Cubs fans (the ones who go on Friday nights, not for the game but to chat and turn it into Dance Wrigley) to see what fielding is all about. The whole "I-sneezed-and-destroyed-my-back" fiasco really didn't help his case. Oh, and when he stereotypically fanned on that pitch during this year's home-run derby. While he's still a huge slugger I kinda home that next time I go to Wrigley, if it hasn't collapsed yet, I hope to see more Nomar jerseys than Sosa jerseys. Discuss.

 I'm not one to complain about celebrity behavior, because if I were in their position, I'd be behaving just as badly. But seriously folks, someone needs to take away urlLink Wilmer Valerrama's little black book, or PDA, or whatever he has, because he seems to have a list of girls on the brink of turning 18. He just sits and waits for the legal system's egg timer to ding and then he moves in for the kill. See urlLink Lindsay Lohan for present reference; see urlLink Mandy Moore for past reference. You'd better keep your heads on a swivel urlLink Emma Watson and urlLink Dakota Fanning ...

 The urlLink White Castle adventure was quite possibly one of the biggest let downs of my life. urlLink Kyle (who has more pics), Connie and I were so hungry and our hopes were so high, that when we arrived and saw the lamely decorated mock-up of a White Castle, we instantly knew it was going to be bad. Then we were given what could only have been microwaved Slyders (one per person too) without anything to drink in our urlLink Harold and Kumar promo cups. "I expected to wait in line for hours," Connie said. Instead we walked right up to a window where they slapped us in the face with reheated patties. It just sucked. And this first pic is our old aparment, now demolished so some jackass could make a crapload of money. God bless America.



 This is the best news I've had since moving to Califonia: As part of a special promotional event, White Castle is opening its very first restaurant on the west coast for an 11-day promotional event leading up to the release of the film. The full-scale replica of a White Castle Burger restaurant will be located at 8301 W. Sunset Blvd. (across the street from The Standard hotel) and will be giving away 50,000 free White Castle hamburgers over the course of the week in conjunction with local radio station Power 106 FM. The promotion kicks off with a star-studded ribbon-cutting event, to be held July 22 at 8:00 pm, and will run through August 11. The full press release is urlLink here . Move over In-and-Out...

 "It's not bad because I'm always tired. My life is a state of jet lag." - urlLink Kyle Ford

 Due to the fact that I've seen quite a few celebs around here in the last couple weeks (Trey Parker and Matt Stone all the way to a unconfirmed Tom Cruise) I've decided just to be a tourist and post who I've seen and their rating on my celebrity scale. So here we go. WHO: Tommy Hilfiger and Ally Hilfiger (you can't miss the teeth) LOCATION: The Grove movie theater CELEB GRADE: Tommy - B-; Ally - C+

 On the way out to California, I picked up a postcard in every state. This one was from Nebraska and it reads "Punching Cattle on a Jack Rabbit." I have no idea what that means.

 I call this display, "It Could Have Been SO Good." That's my dad trying to fly a kite on a day with no wind. Now you see where I get my bright ideas from. Kyle gave me a scanner and I've got two huge boxes of old photos. Expect more gold like the pictures above.

 In belated celebration of our nation's freedom, I figured I'd share this conversation with you. A little history first though. I don't really remember how this British chippy started IMing me, but it was almost two years ago. Somewhere in that time, she got weird. Babbling on about her relationships and I started ignoring her and ultimately it led to urlLink this conversation . Tonight, she tried again. The following conversation took place and I didn't change any of her grammar: BRIT: welcome back ignorer DAVE: I'm sorry, i think you have the wrong screen name. BRIT: i dont BRIT: Dave BRIT: y dont u rember me DAVE: No. This is paul. BRIT: Slizois BRIT: Paul who? DAVE: That's none of your business. BRIT: u serious not pretending to be called paul so i dont talk to you BRIT: sorry for asking BRIT: do u know where dave is?: DAVE: I have no idea who Dave is. BRIT: u sure/ BRIT: cos ive had this screen name down for a yr BRIT: shame cos i was gonna tell him a secret DAVE: I just signed up like two weeks ago. BRIT: weird BRIT: u from usa then? BRIT: hes done a runner on me DAVE: I'm kidding. This was dave. You're dumb. [ Dave Sliozis has signed off ]

 I had one CD in my car's CD player this weekend. Can you name it? Connie, you are not allowed to answer.

 When I first saw the trailer for urlLink Garden State , I didn't know what the film was about but I wanted to see it. I've been a snobbish sucker for small films with Sundance accreditations for quite sometime. I'll admit it. Garden State would turn out to be a film that fit me like a new sock. Being that it was written by, directed by, and starred Zach Braff of urlLink NBC's Scrubs fame, also made me curious. I wanted to see how a guy who I only knew from a TV sitcom would show his other sides. Braff did a great job wearing all three hats. The overall story is pretty obvious and I think the simplicity in the writing is actually one of the films strengths. Braff lays his characters and plot out there and doesn't do anything to distract you from them. Braff's character, Andrew Largeman (or "Large") is a 26 year-old, struggling actor (whose only fame is playing a retarded quaterback on TV) who left his small town nine years ago and has returned because his mother died. The character arch is laid out in front of us and we can't get mad about it because Braff does a great job of getting us to love Large as well as everyone else around him. I had long lost faith in Natalie Portman. She made my Top 5 Hottie list a while back, but really hadn't been a thought since. Somewhere between any number of movies she did with the word "where" (see urlLink here and urlLink here ) at the beginning, and the acting train wrecks that are the Star Wars prequels, I had just filed her away under, "Smart Kid Just Acting To Pay The Bills." I fully expected Portman to play some semi-robot toned character in Garden State , but from the moment she appears on the screen, I was completely blown away. Portman does an incredible job playing Sam, a girl who doesn't so much see the world with fresh eyes, but help pull Largeman out from his protective house. At one point in the movie, Sam is spewing realizations about her relationship with Largeman, and I was so smitten by Portman's acting that I giggled like a little girl. The side characters of Garden State are amazing too. From the grave-digging high school buddies Largeman hooks up with at his mother's funeral, to his emotionally detached father, to Sam's adopted African brother Titembay, every character holds a moment of amazing. If you're okay with a story that doesn't try to hide anything from you, you won't be disappointed. Garden State is a great film all around. ...we also watched urlLink You Got Served . It didn't exceed my expectations. It was about as good as watching an orphanage burn down.
