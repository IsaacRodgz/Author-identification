 The Arab progressives, whose voices have increasingly grown stronger since September 11th and who use the Internet as their main pulpit, are under constant attacks from their Islamist and Pan-Arab nationalist opponents. In his weekly program on Al-Jazeera television, the moderator Dr. Faysal Al-Qassem summarized the main criticisms against them: "I wish we had never scolded the traditional Arab liberals… At least they were nationalists, while the new Arab liberals stand to the right of Fascism and Zionism… Are they not closer to the neo-conservative Americans who are destroying the world, than to the real liberals…? Are they not part of the enmity to Islam, Arabism, nationalism, the [armed] resistance, and all the noble Arab and Islamic values? Why do they lean blindly toward anything Western? Why do they praise and extol normalization with Israel…? Why do they depict America as a benevolent angel who has come to save us from our evils…? Why do they absolve the enemies from being responsible for the backwardness of the Arab world? Why do they despise the nations that embraced Arab and Islamic values? How is it that the neo-liberal Arabs call for tolerance while taking the lead in accusing [others] of heresy? Doesn't liberalism advocate acceptance of others and interaction with all factions? Why do they call for uprooting the Islamists and the proponents of Pan-Arabism? Aren't the neo-liberals more fundamentalist and radical than Osama bin Laden ? Why are they antagonistic to anyone who opposes them? Is this Liberalism or a repulsive Fundamentalism? Are they anything more than a fifth column…?" [1] Throughout his TV program, Dr. Faysal Al-Qassem has supported the views against the Arab liberals, and ten days later he published his opinions in an article in the pro-Saddam London daily Al-Quds Al-Arabi. In his article he makes a distinction between "the real liberals," whom he calls "the nationalist liberals," and the "neo-liberals," whom he condemns. The progressive commentator in the program, Dr. Shaker Al-Nabulsi, also wrote an article explaining his point of view. It was published simultaneously by the liberal Internet site Elaph.com and the daily newspapers Al-Siyassa (Kuwait), Al-Mada (Iraq), and Al-Ahdath Al-Maghribiya (Morocco). -- This is why moderate Arabs and Muslims need to come out and talk. We need to hear some sort of voice from Islam. Islam needs change. We (non-Muslims) cannot change the face of Islam. Only Muslims can change it...from within. Where is the Martin Luther of Islam? Who will be the leader for change in Islam? Who will defend freedom and justice in the name of Allah?...Who? Andrew B.

 The Rafah international border crossing reopened for business Friday morning, allowing 2,500 Palestinians stranded on the Egyptian side of the border for almost three weeks to return to the Gaza Strip. A statement released by the IDF Spokesman said that following a security assessment of the situation and after certain security measures had been taken a decision was made to open the crossing this morning. The crossing was closed on July 18 due to security warnings and fears that terrorists were attempting to build a tunnel and stack it with explosives underneath the crossing. While the crossing was closed, Israel constructed an alternative crossing at Nitzana to cater for the Palestinians stranded in Egypt, but the Palestinian Authority forbade anyone from using the new terminal and refused Israel's humanitarian gesture. "We can't say that the site is 100% secure but we have definitely hampered the terrorists' attempts," a senior military source told The Jerusalem Post. Regarding reports that the army had hired a US company to inspect the crossing and determine whether any tunnels had been built, the source said, "There is no American company. We are constantly approached by various bodies seeking to experiment with new equipment and test it." Security officials admitted that the decision to open the border crossing was following international pressure on Israel due to the outcry made by PA officials who blamed Israel for allowing the Palestinians to remain stranded in Egypt. The PA officials, however, never once referred to the alternative crossing Israel built and refrained from giving reasons as to why they refused to cooperate. -- I think between Egypt and Gaza...there should be a deep channel dug into the border so that terrorists cannot create tunnels to begin with.

 IDF troops operating near the village of Salfit, near the West Bank city of Ariel, shot and killed an armed Hamas member, Muhammad Balasma, Friday morning. Following a gun battle that erupted between soldiers and armed Palestinians near the village, IDF forces arrested Ibrahim Nagi, the head of the Tanzim in the area, Army Radio reported. Earlier Friday, special IDF forces arrested Samah Barghouti, a Tanzim terrorist, in Ramallah. Security forces suspect that Barghouti shot and killed an Israeli citizen, Moshe Yohai, a month ago near Ramallah. Yohai, 63, of Ashdod, was murdered during an unauthorized visit to the Ramallah area in June. Apparently Yohai had entered the PA-controlled area for business purposes. His body was found in his truck, having been shot through the chest. A long-standing order issued by OC Central Command specifically forbids Israelis from entering PA-controlled areas. Security forces reiterated that the entry of Israelis into these areas is strictly forbidden for their safety. -- Sounds great...destroy Hamas and the rest of the terror gangs. Andrew B.

 (Hat Tip: Teri) Having dealt with the "big picture" of global excess mortality it is useful to note some surprises that arise from this analysis. Actually these should not be surprises to informed observers - they should only be surprises to most because the First World global media steadfastly refuse to report the extent of global mass mortality and selectively romanticize particular political events or agendas. Thus the successive military takeovers since 1987 in Fiji (score 6%) have been universally described as "bloodless coups". However my analysis has revealed a subsequently elevated "excess mortality" of some 4500, confirming the sensible predictions of those who observed the loss of doctors, business people and other professionals who left after the first coup. At the other end of the scale, the data indicate horrendous mortality in the Muslim world. Thus the "excess mortality" in preponderantly Muslim countries plus the present Muslim proportion-based component of the "excess mortality" of other significantly Muslim countries totals about 550 million for the period 1950-2004. This death toll is about one hundred times that of the Jewish Holocaust (6 million victims) and of the "forgotten" World War 2 man-made famine in British-ruled Bengal (4 million Muslim and Hindu victims) [1-3]. The Muslim Holocaust has many components - thus "excess mortality" has totalled 5.2 million for Iraq since 1950, 1.5 million for Iraq since 1991 and 340,000 for the Occupied Palestinian Territories since 1967. Since 1950 "excess mortality" has totalled about 49 million for the Turkish Near East and Central Asia and 70 million for the Arab Middle East and North Africa - with the present Muslim proportion-based component of post-1950 "excess mortality" estimated at 93 million for East and South East Asia and the Pacific, 148 million for South Asia, and about 189 million for non-Arab Africa. The sheer magnitude of this Muslim "excess mortality" compels one to address the following questions to First Worlders: when does mass mortality become a holocaust, when is it "fit" to be reported by our media - and when does our complicity become morally insupportable? As outlined above, the prosperous First World should have been dealing with the Muslim world with honesty, goodwill and assistance - rather than with the mix of denial, neglect, hostility, malignant interference, sustained violence and war that has helped cause this horrendous and continuing Muslim Holocaust. Such complicity is clear in the numerous cases of outright military attack or invasion. Indeed an arch-conservative John Valder, a former Federal president of the ruling Australian Liberal Party (equivalent to the US Republicans and UK Conservatives), has repeatedly called for trial and punishment of the Coalition leaders for war crimes over Iraq [21, 22]. Of course non-Muslims as well as Muslims contribute to an annual global death toll of about 20 million people from deprivation and malnourishment-related causes. Economic exclusion, militarization, debt, threat, malignant interference and war have had a major impact on "excess mortality" in Central and South America, Africa, Asia and the Pacific that totals about 1230 million for the period 1950-2004. -- Read the rest on the site. A MUST read. Wow. Andrew B.

 (Hat Tip: Teri) PARIS, Aug. 4 (Xinhuanet) -- France on Wednesday urged Israel to find a "rapid and worthy" solution to end the situation in which thousands of Palestinians are being prevented by the Israeli army from entering the Gaza Strip from Egypt at the Rafah border point,the only connection between the two countries "According to the news we have received, about 3,000 Palestinians -- including many children -- have been stranded on the Egyptian side since July 16 by an Israeli army blockade of theRafah border point," French Foreign Ministry's spokeswoman Cecile Pozzo di Borgo said in a statement. "For sanitary and humanitarian reasons, we call on the Israeli Authorities to find a rapid and worthy solution to this situation in respect of international humanitarian rights," the statement said. In 1993, the Palestinian authority agreed to give Israel control of the border point at Rafah -- a city on the Egypt-Gaza Strip border -- on the Palestinian side. The Israeli army closed the border point on July 16 "because ofan attacks alert" and asked tourists to enter the Gaza Strip via the Nitsanit passage some 60 kilometers south-east of Rafah. -- The French are really pathetic...as if they have any credibility in the world. Andrew B.

 WELLINGTON, New Zealand - Vandals burned down a Jewish chapel and destroyed dozens of gravestones Friday in what was believed to be the worst anti-Semitic desecration at a cemetery in New Zealand. It was the second time Jewish gravesites have been vandalized in New Zealand in three weeks. The first, on July 16, came just hours after two Israeli men were imprisoned for passport fraud and labeled spies by New Zealand's government. Jewish Council President David Zwartz said it appeared both acts were sparked by the government's diplomatic sanctions against Israel over the spy affair. In Friday's early morning attack, the chapel at Makara Cemetery on the outskirts of Wellington, the national capital, was destroyed by fire and up to 90 headstones at Jewish graves pulled out of the ground and smashed, Detective Sergeant Tim Leitch said. On July 16, vandals destroyed historic headstones and cut a swastika into a lawn at the Jewish section of a central Wellington cemetery. Police were not sure if the two attacks were linked, Sgt. Dexter Trail said. There have been no arrests following either. Zwartz said some attitudes toward New Zealand's Jewish community had deteriorated since the spy scandal. "We see a progression from hate speech to hate action," he said. Prime Minister Helen Clark suspended high-level diplomatic contacts with Israel after two Israeli men attempted to illegally obtain a New Zealand passport. She said the pair were working for Israeli intelligence agencies. -- These people are animals...whoever did this should be hung to dry or sleep with some fishes. That is ont of the lowest forms of cowardly acts of terror. Andrew B.

 By BETH GARDINER, Associated Press Writer LONDON - A key al-Qaida operative suspected of authoring surveillance documents that sparked terror alerts in the United States was among 13 terror suspects arrested in Britain, an official said. The documents of surveillance of five U.S. financial institutions were found on the computers of two accused members of Osama bin Laden (news - web sites)'s terror network arrested in Pakistan last month. Pakistani intelligence officials told The Associated Press the computers also held images of London's Heathrow Airport and that this information was passed to British officials. The revelations draw a link between two major sweeps against suspected al-Qaida networks in Pakistan and Britain — as well as the alerts announced Sunday in New York, New Jersey and Washington. At least 20 people have been detained in Pakistan in the past month, and Britain is holding 12 men from raids on Tuesday after releasing one person. British police on Thursday announced the arrest of another man, wanted in the United States for allegedly helping finance terrorist activity. -- Like I have said before...there is much more than what meets the eye with these terrorists. There are others and they all are linked somehow. Either by computer emails and such or by phone. Some how these terrorists are communicating and we need to crack that code...Without communication there are no plans...terrorists cannot meet and agree to do certain things together. If we can disrupt their meetings and plan making abilities then we have a shot. We also can monitor the meetings and when they all get together to perform the act of terror...get them then. It's a tricky business of catching terrorists. Andrew B.

 BAGHDAD, Iraq - U.S. and Iraqi forces have killed about 300 Iraq (news - web sites) militants in two days of fighting in Najaf with militiamen loyal to radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, the U.S. military said Friday. Battles in other Shiite areas of the country has killed dozens more, according to Iraqi authorities. Two U.S. Marines and an American soldier were killed in Najaf on Thursday, and 12 troops were wounded, the military said. Coalition troops have been battling the militiamen since early Thursday in fighting that shattered a series of truces that had ended a widespread Shiite rebellion two months ago. The fighting was heaviest in Najaf, where U.S. warplanes and helicopters attacked suspected militant positions. "We estimate we've killed 300 anti-Iraqi forces in the past two days of fighting," said Capt. Carrie Batson, a Marine spokeswoman. -- Talk about kicking some serious ass. That's a lot of DEAD TERRORISTS. Sounds great to me. Keep going...plenty more where that came from. I am willing to wager a small fortune that most Iraqis are growing tired of these terrorists...maybe at first they might have supported them for various reasons, but now its a different story. These people can see their future crumbing with the terrorists. They see a bright future with the Americans and the coaltion that is helping to rebuild Iraq and bring it back to life after thousands of years of decay. The 'Cradle of Civilization' will come back and better than before. Andrew B.

 By JAMIE TARABAY, Associated Press Writer BAGHDAD, Iraq - "Give us $100,000, or we'll you give you back your son's head," the voice on the other end of the phone spat at Leon Katchader. "And if you tell anyone about this, we'll come and blow your house up." Two days earlier, his 14-year-old son, Rami, was snatched from around the corner of their house. And the car repair shop owner was only just beginning to grasp the sophistication of the racket behind his son's kidnapping. "Where am I going to get $100,000? Who told you I was some kind of millionaire?" Katchader pleaded with the man on the phone. But the kidnappers knew he could afford to pay a ransom. They knew that three days earlier, the family had been in Syria, where one of Katchader's four daughters was married. They even knew Katchader's nickname, Levon. "I can only afford $3,000. And as God gave me my son, God can take him away," Katchader said. Then he hung up the phone and collapsed. While scores of foreigners have been kidnapped by militants as leverage in their fight against the government and coalition forces, Iraqis have faced their own epidemic of kidnappings in the chaos since the fall of Saddam Hussein (news - web sites)'s regime last year. The motive is simply money. -- This is what Columbia is like..only minus the Muslim terrorists and beheadings. Other than that it is pretty much the same thing. Gangs kidnap for ransom. When the ransom is paid they kidnap again and again. Once you give to terrorism, it only emboldens the terrorists to use it again and again. Andrew B.

 By MARK LAVIE, Associated Press Writer JERUSALEM - Israel will allow Palestinian police to resume carry weapons, security officials said Thursday, a significant step toward shoring up the prestige of Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qureia. As part of a reform program, Qureia decided to deploy blue-uniformed police on the streets of Palestinian cities and towns. However, for the last three years, Israel has not allowed Palestinians to carry arms in public. The Israeli officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Palestinian Civil Affairs Minister Jamil Tarifi met with a senior Israeli official this week and put forward the request. Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz said Israel would agree, but it would require presentation of a list of those who are to receive weapons and would have to approve each one individually. Control of Palestinian streets has been taken by armed gangs and militant groups in the absence of Palestinian police. Israel banned the police in 2001, charging that they were involved in violence. -- Yeah...that's a great idea...let's give the guns back to the terrorists and have them kill more Israelis...what a bad plan. We all know why Israel is doing this, but I think this is really stupid. I can see why the "Palestinian" police would need guns, but the police are part of the problem...many of them are part of these terror groups. How do you quantify each one? Give them an interview or something to fine out whether or not he is capable to doing his job correctly? Andrew B.

 JERUSALEM - Israel will reopen the Rafah crossing between the Gaza Strip (news - web sites) and Egypt on Friday, allowing 1,500 stranded Palestinians to return home, the army said Thursday. The crossing will reopen Friday morning after the army changes security measures because of concerns that Palestinian militants were planning attacks — perhaps through tunnels, the military said. Egypt warned Wednesday of a humanitarian crisis at the crossing, where Palestinians have been waiting for more than two weeks. Israel said it closed the crossing July 18 — warning Egypt and the Palestinians beforehand — and opened a different one nearby. Palestinian travelers have been reluctant to use the second crossing, especially since it would require them to enter Israeli-controlled territory instead of Gaza. The Palestinians waiting on the Egyptian side were unable to properly bathe and had to share food and clothes. The crossing frequently closes, but rarely for such a long period. According to interim peace agreements, Israel controls all crossings between Palestinian territories and neighboring states.

 Srinagar, India - Suspected Islamic rebels decapitated a woman in Indian Kashmir and left her head hanging in a tree, police said on Thursday, adding that six other people were killed in the restive state. Police were investigating the motive for the beheading of Shameema Akhter near the town of Tral, 40km south of the Kashmiri summer capital Srinagar, a police spokesperson said. None of the dozen rebel groups fighting Indian troops in Kashmir has claimed responsibility for the murder. In other violence, Muslim rebels shot dead a pro-government militant in southern Anantnag district and a civilian in Udhampur district, further south, police said. Indian troops, meanwhile, shot dead three militants in northern Kupwara and southern Poonch districts overnight in two separate encounters, police said, adding that a suspected smuggler died in southern Pulwama district early Thursday in cross-fire between militants and Indian troops. Thousands of people have been killed in Kashmir since the eruption of anti-Indian insurgency in the scenic Himalayan region 15 years ago. -- As usual...disgusting. RoP strikes again... Andrew B.

 By BETH GARDINER, Associated Press Writer LONDON - Armed with new intelligence from Pakistan suggesting al-Qaida plotted to attack London's Heathrow airport, police questioned a dozen terror suspects Thursday and announced the arrest of a man wanted in the United States on charges of raising money for terrorism. But at Heathrow, a man reading a newspaper with the front-page headline "HEATHROW BOMB PLOT," said he was unaware of any security scare. And a woman headed to Boston shrugged off the threat, saying, "I've just got to get on with it." Intelligence officials in Pakistan told The Associated Press they found images of Heathrow and other sites on the computers of two arrested al-Qaida fugitives, and that this information was passed to British officials. Police, however, would not say if this information helped lead to the arrests of the 12 suspected terrorists earlier this week in Britain. Among the 12 was a senior al-Qaida member, known as Abu Eisa al-Hindi or Abu Musa al-Hindi, who media reported was involved in plotting against Heathrow. On Thursday, police gained court approval to continue questioning until Sunday afternoon. Further extensions up to a total of two weeks are possible. Police also said they had arrested a British man, Babar Ahmad, wanted on terrorism charges in a warrant issued by a federal prosecutor in Connecticut, and that anti-terror officials were searching three "residential premises" and one business in southwest London on behalf of U.S. authorities. -- al-Qaeda is all over now...unbelievable. This is why we need to stay vigilant through this war. This is not your typical war. This is an asymetrical war. The terrorists seem to have the upper hand because they can make the first move and not us. Andrew B.

 LONDON - British police said Thursday they had arrested a British man wanted on terrorism charges in the United States. The Metropolitan Police said Babar Ahmad, 30, was arrested in central London on a U.S. extradition warrant. The warrant alleges that between 1998 and Feb. 19, 2001, Ahmad sought through American Web sites and e-mail people in the United States or elsewhere "to give or otherwise make available money and other property" to commit terrorist acts in Chechnya (news - web sites) and Afghanistan (news - web sites). Ahmad was to appear in court Friday. Ahmad was taken to a London police station and was due to appear in court Friday. His arrest was not believed to be linked to the detention of 12 men on suspicion of terrorism earlier this week. Those men, whose arrests sparked speculation about a plot to bomb Heathrow Airport, were being questioned at a London police station. The police said anti-terrorist officers were searching three "residential premises" and one business in southwest London on behalf of U.S. authorities. -- Somehow I think that this isn't the last one to be nabbed. Andrew B.

 BAGHDAD, Iraq - A series of explosions shook central Baghdad late Thursday, rocking a neighborhood near the hotel compound that houses foreign journalists and foreign contractors. Smoke rose outside the Palestine Hotel and gunshots were heard nearby. The cause of the blasts was not immediately clear.

 By PETER ENAV, Associated Press Writer MAALEH ADUMIM, West Bank - Israeli bulldozers churned across a West Bank hill Thursday gouging a rough road needed for a government plan to build housing in an area it hopes to make a permanent part of the Jewish state, despite strong objections from both the Palestinian leadership and the Bush administration. The road would link the sprawling Jewish settlement of Maaleh Adumim to Jerusalem, four miles away, and officials confirmed Thursday that they foresee thousands of new homes along the route — despite a provision of the internationally supported "road map" peace plan that calls for a halt to growth of Israeli settlements. In another development, Israeli officials decided to allow Palestinian police to carry weapons again, which could help shore up the prestige of Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qureia and improve security in Palestinian areas. Underlining growing lawlessness in those areas, masked gunmen forced three Palestinian Cabinet ministers to stop speaking at a news conference in the Gaza Strip (news - web sites) town of Beit Hanoun on Thursday and forced them to leave town.

 By CURT ANDERSON, Associated Press Writer WASHINGTON - Two leaders of a mosque in Albany, N.Y., have been arrested in an alleged plot involving a scheme to buy a shoulder-fired missile, the Justice Department (news - web sites) announced Thursday. Court papers filed in the case alleged that the weapon was to be used to assassinate the Pakistani ambassador at that country's consulate across from the United Nations (news - web sites) in New York. The two men — identified as Yassin Aref, 34, the imam of the mosque, and Mohammed Hossain, 49, one of the mosque's founders — were arrested on Wednesday night in a government-run "sting" operation, Deputy Attorney General James Comey told a Justice Department news conference. Two U.S. law enforcement officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the two men have ties to a group which has been linked to the al-Qaida terror network. -- There is probably more people involved than just 2 people. I am expecting at least 6 more people. Terror cells contain roughly 3-8 usually. We will see how many more terrorists are picked up. Oh BTW what a surprise that the man who opened the Mosque is one of the 2 people picked up. Andrew B.

 By NADIA ABOU EL-MAGD, Associated Press Writer CAIRO, Egypt - Outrage over a columnist's description of the Holocaust as a lie prompted a front-page clarification Wednesday in a weekly newspaper published by Egypt's ruling party. Al-Lewaa al-Islami, or "The Islamic Banner," said that two columns by Rifaat Sayed Ahmed expressed only "the opinion of the writer, which is subject to discussion, agreement or rejection." Editor Mohammed al-Zorkany said in an interview with The Associated Press that he had not expected the columns in the Islamic-oriented weekly to generate controversy. Ahmed himself was unapologetic. "The issue should be the Holocaust that the Palestinians are going through, not the Jews," said Ahmed, who heads a think tank that researches Palestinian and Lebanese Islamic movements. "The West has a serious problem of double standards." -- I think this is outrageous because the paper gives an offical statement like this... ...the opinion of the writer, which is subject to discussion, agreement or rejection... Excuse me, what is there to dispute or discuss. It happened. The Holocaust happened. You can't deny it. There is proof. Case closed. There is no room for discussion on whether or not it happened. It's moot point. Anyone that tries to dispute it anti-Semetic and disgusting. What kind of person would argue whether or not it happened? Who are these people?

 By TED BRIDIS, Associated Press Writer WASHINGTON - The Bush administration learned from a third person, separate from two prisoners identified this week, that al-Qaida was plotting to attack American financial buildings, officials said. The information from the third person was "another new stream of intelligence" that supported the White House decision to issue a terror warning on Sunday, the officials said. The information arrived days before the public alert, as officials were reviewing reams of recently obtained documents and photographs that showed surveillance of five buildings in New York City, New Jersey and Washington carried out years earlier by al-Qaida. "Old information isn't irrelevant information — particularly with this kind of enemy," Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge said Wednesday in Nashville, Tenn. The information corroborating al-Qaida's intentions to carry out attacks against U.S. financial buildings came from someone other than two men recently captured in Pakistan, said a senior Justice Department (news - web sites) official, speaking on condition of anonymity. It was unclear whether the person was a prisoner or informant. Information from the two captives — a young militant familiar with computers and a man indicted for the U.S. embassy bombings in Africa in 1998 — had provided the bulk of the intelligence that led to Sunday's warnings. -- According to John Kerry...Bush is abusing this information to make it seem as if there really is a threat. Well...guess what Mr. Effing Kerry there is a threat and its coming right for us. Andrew B.

 BASRA, Iraq (AFP) - Militiamen loyal to Shiite Muslim radical leader Moqtada Sadr declared holy war against British forces based in Iraq (news - web sites)'s main southern city of Basra after four of their comrades were arrested. "We will wage jihad (holy war) and war against the foreign troops, not against police and Iraqi forces," said Sheikh Saad al-Basri, Sadr's representative in the overwhelmingly Shiite city. "However, if they (the Iraqi personnel) fight on the side of the occupiers, we will strike them harshly." Basri accused British forces of arresting four Sadr supporters in order to "create in Basra, the state of crisis that exists in Najaf". An AFP photographer saw British troops deployed in armoured vehicles and tanks around Sadr's main offices and elsewhere in the city. Police chief General Mohamad Kazem al-Ali said officials at Sadr's office had rejected his attempts to defuse the tension through negotiations. Basra deputy governor Salam Audeh, who represents Sadr on the provincial council, accused foreign troops of reneging on a June truce that ended Sadr's uprising earlier this year.

 RAMALLAH, West Bank - Israeli soldiers raided a Palestinian engagement party Wednesday in the West Bank city of Ramallah and arrested the prospective bridegroom, participants said. Rami Barghouti, 28, an activist in the Islamic militant group Hamas who has long been in hiding, was celebrating his engagement when Israeli forces surrounded the house. Participants said Barghouti tried to hide, but the soldiers opened fire and captured him. He was wounded, they said. His fiancee was not detained. Barghouti is a distant relative of Marwan Barghouti, a Palestinian uprising leader serving five life terms after being convicted in May in an Israeli court of involvement in attacks that killed 26 Israelis. The Israeli military said only that "a Hamas terrorist was arrested in Ramallah" on Wednesday. -- "Activist"? How about TERRORIST or ASSHOLE? I think those are more succinct. What's with the PC language? Call a spade a spade...a terrorist is a terrorist is a terrorist is a terrorist....Get it? Got it? Good... Andrew B.

 By EDITH M. LEDERER, Associated Press Writer UNITED NATIONS - The United Nations (news - web sites) will have to rely on the U.S.-led multinational force in Iraq (news - web sites) for security for its new envoy in Baghdad because no countries have offered troops for a separate U.N. protection force, Secretary-General Kofi Annan (news - web sites) said Wednesday. Ashraf Jehangir Qazi of Pakistan will take up his post as U.N. special representative in Iraq before a national conference of political, religious and civic leaders gets under way in mid-August, Annan said.. But Qazi will be deployed with only a small team, and Annan told Security Council ambassadors Wednesday that at least 5,000 troops are necessary to protect the much larger U.N. staff needed to help Iraq through elections and in rebuilding the country, according to a council diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity. -- Why should we do anything for the UN? The UN has done everything it can to prevent anything positive from happeneing in Iraq and the rest of the world...it's like a debating society with dull teeth. Andrew B.

 BAGHDAD, Iraq - A U.S. Marine helicopter was shot down Thursday morning during fighting in the southern city of Najaf but the crew survived, the military said. It wasn't clear how many people were aboard the UH-1 helicopter, but some were injured and were evacuated, military spokesman Spc. Justin McCue said. The helicopter was shot down about 11:43 a.m. as militiamen loyal to radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr fought with Iraqi and U.S. forces. The clashes killed at least two people and wounded eight, Health Ministry officials said. Al-Sadr's Mahdi Army attacked a police station there with mortars, rocket-propelled grenades and gunfire. U.S. Marines entered the area to assist the police, residents said. (Corrects typo in overline, garble in lede.) -- G-d bless these soldiers. It's amazing no one was killed. Credit should be given to the pilot of the helicopter for saving the lives of the crew. incredible bravery. Andrew B.

 LONDON (Reuters) - Intelligence shows al Qaeda has plans to target merchant shipping in a bid to disrupt world trade, Britain's top Navy officer said in an interview published on Thursday. "We have got an underlying level of intelligence which shows there is a threat," the Royal Navy's First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff, Admiral Sir Alan West, was quoted as saying by Lloyd's List maritime newspaper. The Defense Ministry confirmed West had given the interview in which he reiterated previous warnings about the threat of an attack on the world's commercial fleets.

 PRETORIA (AFP) - South Africa expressed "outrage" at reports that two of its nationals detained in Pakistan had allegedly confessed to planning terror attacks on key sites back home, saying there was no evidence of such plots. Government spokesman Joel Netshitenzhe said Pretoria wished "to express its outrage at the manner in which these matters have been aired without any credible substantiation from security agencies in our country and in Pakistan." "There is no confirmation from South African or Pakistani authorities that South Africa has been targeted in the manner that been described," he told a news conference in Pretoria after a top level government meeting. Vusi Mavimbela, the head of South Africa's National Intelligence Agency, told the press conference there was "no need for panic." -- This is exactly what I was talking about. Just deny, deny, deny, deny...I can hear it now...'they won't come to us...we were against the war from the beginning...we don't HATE MUSLIMS'. It's really pathetic how the South African government is treating this alert. Why would Pakistan lie or mislead the truth? What sense would it be to say that there is going to be a terror attack in South Africa...out of all places? There is a reason why Pakistan alerted South Africa. If the South Africans do not take this seriously and do not take all the precautions that they should...then they shouldn't be surprised if something happens...(G-d forbid). Andrew B.

 By PAUL HAVEN, Associated Press Writer ISLAMABAD, Pakistan - Two South Africans captured along with a senior al-Qaida terrorist were plotting attacks on tourist sites in their home country, Pakistani officials said Wednesday, a surprising target for Islamic terrorism given the African nation's vocal stand against the war in Iraq (news - web sites) and Israel's treatment of Palestinians. South African officials cast doubt on reports of a terror plot, though this past spring a top South African police official indicated that authorities foiled plans to attack the country during its April 14 elections. The two men are believed to have arrived in Pakistan on a flight from the United Arab Emirates just days before their July 25 arrest, which followed a 12-hour gunbattle in the eastern city of Gujrat. They greeted police with curses and promised an unending battle against President Bush (news - web sites) and anyone who supports him, according to a senior police official. The South African suspects were identified as Feroz Ibrahim, believed to be in his 30s, and Zubair Ismail, in his 20s, said Gujrat Police Chief Raja Munawar Hussain. -- You have to love the response of the South African government "...officials cast doubt on reports of a terror plot..." that's right...just ignore the threat and it'll just go away...or better yet...just tell the terrorists that you were against the war from the beginning and they won't bother you.

 By MICHAEL CASEY, Associated Press Writer JAKARTA, Indonesia - Shifting tactics, an al-Qaida-linked group that staged the deadliest post-Sept. 11 terror bombing is believed to be planning assassinations of Western and regional leaders in Asia, moving away from large-scale strikes against civilian targets, officials told The Associated Press. Increasingly isolated and on the run, Jemaah Islamiyah's capabilities have been eroded by dozens of arrests, a shortage of funds and divisions within its leadership. As a result, the group isn't focusing on coordinated attacks like the 2002 Bali nightclub bombings that killed 202 people and the 2003 suicide bombing of the J.W. Marriott hotel in Jakarta, which killed 12 people, officials told the AP. "The threat has been contained but it is still there and has not been eliminated completely," said Zainal Abidin Zain, director-general of Southeast Asia's U.S.-backed anti-terror center in Malaysia. Jemaah Islamiyah remains the most dangerous terror group in Southeast Asia. But the Marriott bombing was the last large-scale attack attributed to the group. Some security officials suggest the arrests of key members — including Hambali, the group's alleged operations chief — has stripped it of the ability to strike big anytime soon. -- This is what happens when you let these freaks run around with impunity. It's time for Indonesia to stand up for freedom and democracy and take down these terror gangs before they can do some serious damage. Andrew B.

 ISLAMABAD (AFP) - The Pakistani Al-Qaeda computer expert captured last month was one of the terror network's top planners, had a five million dollar bounty on his head and had plotted to attack London's Heathrow airport, a senior security official said. Naeem Noor Khan, 25, alias Abu Talha, arrested in the eastern city of Lahore on July 12, "is in the top hierarchy of Al-Qaeda's external operations wing," a security official closely associated with the latest Al-Qaeda swoop told AFP Wednesday. Khan had not only been creating websites and secret email codes for Al-Qaeda operatives to communicate with each other, he had also actively plotted terror attacks, the official said on condition of anonymity. "He was involved in planning for attacks at Heathrow airport London some time ago and was wanted by the US government," the official said, but was unable to say exactly when the Heathrow attack was planned. The United States Central Intelligence Agency (news - web sites) (CIA (news - web sites)) had offered a five million dollar reward for his capture, he added. Khan is one of at least 18 Al-Qaeda suspects swept up by Pakistan since July 12, along with a key suspect in the 1998 bombings of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, two South Africans and a Nigerian who was carrying coded messages as he tried to fly out of the country. -- This shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone. This is the new face of al-Qaeda. Many of these terrorists are getting younger and younger...not only that...but they are getting smarter and more web savvy. Andrew B.

 By STEPHEN GRAHAM, Associated Press Writer KABUL, Afghanistan - Afghanistan (news - web sites)'s powerful defense minister on Wednesday backed a rival to President Hamid Karzai in the country's upcoming elections, and insisted he would not use violence to try and hang on to office. Karzai last week dropped Mohammed Fahim, a militia leader who also serves as deputy head-of-state, from his ticket for the Oct. 9 presidential vote. The surprise move split Karzai's Cabinet and put NATO (news - web sites) troops in Kabul on alert for any reaction from Fahim's troops. In his first public reaction, Fahim said the decision was a "mistake" that had alienated many of the militia leaders who helped U.S. forces oust the Taliban in late 2001. But he insisted that the upcoming power struggle would be peaceful. "The time to pick up a gun and fight is over," Fahim told reporters. "Now is the time for politicians." -- This is great for Karzai. This gives more credibility to his campaign as well as to his future projects concerning Afghanistan. Andrew B.

 GAZA CITY (AFP) - Israeli helicopter gunships fired at least two missiles at targets in the northern Gaza town of Jabaliya, wounding at least two people, Palestinian witnesses and security sources said. Medics said the two wounded late Wednesday were evacuated to the town's Kamal Redwan hospital, although their condition was unclear. -- More updates to come...

 --And the "Palestinians" wonder why there are checkpoints are random searches in Gaza and West Bank. You have to be really stupid to second guess what the Israelis are doing. I mean really...look at what the Israelis have to go through day in and day out.--

 --What other countries greets it's new immigrants with 1000 beautiful women? Answer? Probably NONE, if any. Israel goes out of their way to make Jewish families feel at home when they make "Aliyah" to Israel. It must be an incredible feeling to say I am home...I am finally be home...in Israel.--

 --Marhaban everyone...hey is this a party or what? Hey Habibi...put some more pitas on that table. Put some of that rap guy on...what's his name? MC Kufr. Ooops!!! Oh...did someone step on a duck? Did I do that? Sorry everyone...I think I did something. Will someone please change my anti-Zionist underwear...oh wait I am not wearing underwear...--

 -- The World's Oldest Terrorist has a birthday today...(born in EGYPT). Hey Yassir...Happy Birthday and I hope you die soon. Sorry to be so blunt, but I think we have had enough of your terror for one century already. By STEVE WEIZMAN, Associated Press Writer JERUSALEM - Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat (news - web sites) turned 75 Wednesday, but there were no birthday parties or parades. Arafat spent the day as usual — hunkered down behind sandbags in the shell-pocked compound where he lives and works in the West Bank city of Ramallah. Aides said a few Palestinian officials brought Arafat flowers, but no festivities were planned. Israel has confined Arafat to his Ramallah headquarters for more than two years, and the Israeli government refuses to deal with him, saying he has done nothing to halt Palestinian attacks and is an obstacle to Mideast peace. Palestinians consider Arafat their main symbol of struggle and independence, though many disagree with his autocratic style of rule. -- Why is this news? This is nurishkite (Yiddish for "Nothing" or "Meaningless").

 WASHINGTON (AFP) - Jamila is poised to be a household name in Afghanistan (news - web sites) -- an expectant Afghan mother who sought pre-natal care, delivered her baby in a neighborhood clinic and breastfed her child for six months. But this model mum exists in name only. The headscarf-wearing and sweet-voiced Jamila is a key character in a "talking" book produced by the United States in a novel effort to reduce war-torn Afghanistan's shockingly high infant and maternal mortality rates. The 42-page interactive book provides women with a hands-on approach to learning about healthy living practices in a country where illiteracy is among the main barriers to good health. In a joint venture with a leading American developer of technology-based educational products, the US Department of Health and Human Services (news - web sites) published 20,000 copies of the battery-powered book at a cost of 1.2 million dollars for distribution throughout the landlocked country. -- This is some great news for Afghani women...most of whom cannot read because the Taliban made it illegal to do so. The women have a great and better future ahead of them. Women in Afghanistan have a chance now. Today, is a good day for Afghani women. Andrew B.

 By Mark Trevelyan, Security Correspondent BERLIN (Reuters) - Key evidence in the planned retrial of a September 11 suspect in Germany was probably obtained by U.S. authorities under torture, his lawyer alleged on Wednesday as he called for the case to be thrown out. Lawyer Josef Graessle-Muenscher said he would use the torture charge to press for the case against Moroccan Mounir El Motassadeq to be dropped as soon as the retrial gets under way in Hamburg next Tuesday. "I will say that we can't conduct fair proceedings because the evidence we need comes from the United States, it was obtained under torture and it must be rejected," he told Reuters in a telephone interview. President Bush (news - web sites) has condemned torture as alien to American values and said he has never ordered its use, but Washington has faced an international outcry over its treatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba and the abuse of Iraqi inmates at Abu Ghraib jail near Baghdad. The German court case revolves around Ramzi bin al-Shaibah, a captured al Qaeda leader who knew Motassadeq in Hamburg. Both were part of a circle of Arab students there which included Mohamed Atta, Marwan al-Shehhi and Ziad Jarrah, three of the suicide hijackers who led the attacks of September 11, 2001. Germany has asked the United States to provide information from the interrogation of bin al-Shaibah, who was captured in Pakistan in 2002, which could help secure a conviction in the Motassadeq trial. -- I can't stand this stuff...These RDDB (Red Diaper Doper Baby) lawyers are driving me nuts. They make it so difficult to protect our people and the people of the world. They are more concerned with the rights of these TERRORISTS than us. It is sickening. Andrew B.

 WASHINGTON - The State Department on Tuesday updated a warning urging Americans to leave Gaza immediately and defer travel to Israel and the West Bank because of security concerns since the kidnapping of a U.S. citizen in the West Bank last week. The hostage, and two others, subsequently were released after officials said the Palestinian Authority (news - web sites) promised to pay the kidnappers an unspecified amount. The warning, updating one issued April 28, also cites the kidnapping of other foreigners in the West Bank and Gaza and the killing of two Hamas leaders that have resulted in Hamas threats of revenge against U.S. interests. The latest advisory cautions that the threatened actions "could include kidnappings, although we have no information that these threats will be carried out at this time." "The potential for further terrorist acts remains high," it adds. "The situation in Israel, Jerusalem, Gaza and the West Bank remains extremely volatile with continuing terrorist attacks, confrontations and clashes. ... In addition, as the Israeli Defense Force continues to conduct extensive military operations, especially in Gaza, the possibility that innocent bystanders might become victims remains high." -- People shouldn't be afraid to go to Israel. Israel for the most part is a safe place, however...the areas near the West Bank and Gaza are probably places where an American and Jews shouldn't be right now or for the near future. Andrew B.

 By SAMIR FADHIL, Associated Press Writer MOSUL, Iraq - Fierce gunbattles broke out Wednesday between Iraqi police and militants in the northern city of Mosul, killing 12 Iraqis and wounding 26 others, officials said. Dozens of masked men with assault rifles and rocket propelled grenade launchers moved through the streets in the Bab al-Toub area of the northern Iraqi city Wednesday afternoon, witnesses said. Soon after, police headed to the area and a gunbattle, punctuated by explosions, broke out, witnesses said. Police blocked off roads in the neighborhood, and shopowners closed their businesses. The U.S. military said the violence was part of a series of attacks in the city, including a grenade attack that hit a home, a shooting at a police station and a roadside bomb attack on a U.S. convoy. The fighting killed 12 people and injured 26 others, according to Mahir Salam, an official at al-Junhouri Hospital in Mosul. In response to the violence, the provincial government imposed a curfew on the city and banned anyone from shooting there without official authorization.

 By ARTHUR MAX, Associated Press Writer JERUSALEM - Israeli tanks and bulldozers moved toward the packed Jebaliya refugee camp in the Gaza Strip (news - web sites) on Wednesday, severing electricity and telephone lines in an operation to stop Palestinian rocket attacks, witnesses and Israeli officials said. -- I won't even bother pasting the rest of the article...it's your typical left sided propaganda.

 By IBRAHIM ALI SULEIMAN, Associated Press Writer KHARTOUM, Sudan - More than 100,000 people marched through Sudan's capital Wednesday in a state-orchestrated rally opposing a U.N. Security Council deadline for the government to disarm Arab militias blamed for killing thousands of people in western Darfur province. Demonstrators also presented a memorandum to the U.N. envoy in Sudan demanding that U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan (news - web sites) apologize for "misleading" people on the nature of the situation in Darfur, which the world body has described as the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. Annan visited the region last month. "You, as the secretary-general of the United Nations (news - web sites), hold all the responsibility for escalating the crisis in Darfur, as your remarks formed the basis of the misleading, antagonistic Western propaganda against Sudan," the memorandum said in Arabic. Annan issued a statement after his visit accusing "government security personnel" of threatening displaced people and expressing grave concern about "reports of continuing intimidation, threats and attacks against refugees." The demonstrators' statement also accused Annan of collaborating with the United States and Israel in "expressing enmity to Sudan." It was signed by the Popular Association in Defense of Conviction and the Nation. -- Of course they need more time...they only have a few hundred thousand to go untill all the Southern Dafur peoples are completely wiped out. These terrorists know the UN won't do anything so they try to stall for more time so they can continue to commit genocide. Meanwhile, the world is fixed on Israel and a barrier. Go figure...Let's see hundreds of THOUSANDS of people being SLAUGHTERED with KNIVES or a cement wall and some barbed wire. Hmmmmm...yeah the UN is useless. Andrew B.

 By SAMEER N. YACOUB, Associated Press Writer BAGHDAD, Iraq - A tribal chief in the turbulent city of Fallujah said Wednesday he led a raid that freed four Jordanian hostages, while a militant group released two Turkish workers after Turkish truck drivers agreed to halt deliveries to U.S. forces here. The Jordanian hostages were kidnapped eight days ago along a highway near Fallujah by a gang of kidnappers that never named its demands, said Ahmad Abu-Jaafar, one of the freed captives. "The kidnappers have nothing to do with the resistance," Abu-Jaafar told The Associated Press by telephone. "The good people of Fallujah moved and save us from this." Also Wednesday, the Arab satellite network al-Jazeera reported that an al-Qaida-linked militant group in Iraq (news - web sites) said it will free two Turkish hostages after their company promised to stop sending trucks to U.S. troops in Iraq. Hours later, Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul said the men had been freed. "The two Turkish hostages in Iraq have been released," Turkey's Anatolia news agency quoted Gul as saying. "This good news has made us happy." Turkey's truckers association said Monday it was halting deliveries to U.S. forces in Iraq in hopes of freeing the men after the release of a video that showed militants shooting and killing contractor Murat Yuce. -- Free at last...free at last...by G-d we are free at last...(I am sure they were saying that...but only in Arabic and Turkish) Andrew B.

 By MARIAM FAM, Associated Press Writer BAGHDAD, Iraq - A long-awaited amnesty plan intended to help end the 15-month-old insurgency in Iraq (news - web sites) will not cover fighters who have killed anyone, a government official said Wednesday. The government had originally proposed the amnesty as part of a carrot-and-stick package to end the violence; the insurgents would be forgiven for their past crimes, but those who continued killing could be executed under a planned death penalty law. But the amnesty, which was expected to have been announced soon after the interim Iraqi government took office June 28, has been repeatedly delayed, and subsequent drafts have narrowed the list of who would be eligible. Officials were still uncertain about when it might go into effect. "The amnesty covers those Iraqis who have not committed killings, who have been deceived into joining the resistance and who are now convinced that they made a mistake. We welcome them," said Georges Sada, spokesman for Prime Minister Ayad Allawi. "Anyone who committed the crime of murder will not be covered by the amnesty," he added. -- Well...it's good to see and hear that Allawi is not letting these freaks get off so easy. Andrew B.

 BY KNUT ROYCE WASHINGTON BUREAU August 3, 2004 WASHINGTON -- More financial institutions than previously disclosed may be at risk of attack, and an al-Qaida operative has told British intelligence that the group's target date is early September, intelligence sources said yesterday. The operative, described as "credible" by British intelligence, told his debriefers that the attack would take place "60 days before the presidential election" on Nov. 2, according to a former senior National Security Council official. On Sept. 2 President George W. Bush is expected to address the Republican National Convention at Madison Square Garden. Counterterrorism officials are analyzing data from a computer seized in Pakistan last month to see if financial institutions in addition to the five disclosed Sunday are at risk of attack, U.S. officials said yesterday. The former senior National Security Council official said he was told by British intelligence that they are interrogating an al-Qaida operative who confirmed that financial institutions are being targeted and that an attack was planned for September. And a U.S. official familiar with the ongoing analysis of the computer said, "There are references to other things [buildings]" in the al-Qaida computer's data, including a picture of the Bank of America building in San Francisco. "There is mention of other places." The laptop computer was seized on July 25 following the arrest after a 12-hour gun battle of Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, who is wanted for his alleged role in the 1998 bombing of two U.S. embassies in Africa. Pakistan's information minister confirmed to The Associated Press yesterday that e-mail data retrieved from Ghailani's computer indicated planned attacks in both the United States and Britain. A British official said that the threat to the U.K. was not specific. -- Hold onto your party hats kids...it's going to be a bumpy ride. Andrew B.

 By BETH GARDINER, Associated Press Writer LONDON - Police conducted anti-terrorism raids in London and several towns Tuesday, arresting 13 people believed involved in preparing terrorist acts. London's Metropolitan Police said the afternoon and evening arrests were "part of a pre-planned, ongoing intelligence-led operation." The men were detained "on suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism," the police statement said, without elaborating. The arrests did not appear to be linked to information Pakistani authorities recently said they had uncovered about threats to Britain and America. The police said the arrests were in northwest London, suburban Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire and in Lancashire, northwestern England. The Lancashire raid was in the town of Blackburn and the Hertfordshire arrests were in Luton, police said. Detectives were searching homes in all those places in operations expected to take time to finish, police said. The suspects, who are all in their 20s and 30s, will be brought to a central London police station for questioning by anti-terrorism officers, police said. They declined to specify the men's nationalities, but the British Broadcasting Corp. said they were all of South Asian descent and some were thought to be British citizens. -- I love how they don't tell you if they were Muslim or not. (I know I am jumping to conclusions, but lets face it...there aren't too many Hindu, Jewish, Buddhist, etc...terrorists around the world) Although in all honesty, they could be an anarchist or communist group...but I highly doubt it.

 By RAVI NESSMAN, Associated Press Writer BAGHDAD, Iraq - Insurgents killed seven Iraqi security personnel in a car bombing and other attacks Tuesday, and the U.S. military announced the deaths of six Americans, including four killed by guerrillas. The American dead included two soldiers killed by a roadside bomb and two Marines who died after being wounded in fighting Monday. Two others died in non-combat-related incidents. The U.S. deaths brought at least 919 the number of U.S. service members who have died since the beginning of military operations in Iraq (news - web sites). Also Tuesday, saboteurs set off a bomb at a key northern oil pipeline, sparking a fire and sending huge plumes of thick black smoke into the sky. The explosion had no immediate effect on exports, which had been halted for weeks from the north. Iraqi Prime Minister Ayad Allawi blamed the continuing violence on "evil powers ... trying to stop Iraq's march toward safety." "We expect that as Iraq's (security) capabilities increase, the crushing of these (armed) operations will increase," he told reporters Tuesday. -- It's always sad to hear about death whether it from our soldiers or the brave Iraqis that are standing up for freedom. My heart goes out to ALL of these brave men and women. Saving ours lives each day. Andrew B.

 By ABDUL HUSSEIN AL-OBEIDI, Associated Press Writer NAJAF, Iraq - Radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr's militia has kidnapped 18 Iraqi police officers in hopes of using them as leverage to force authorities to free detained militants, police said Tuesday. The recent kidnappings took place as al-Sadr aides accused authorities of trying to arrest top officials from the cleric's Mahdi Army. The new tensions appear to threaten a fragile cease-fire between the Mahdi Army and Iraqi authorities. Al-Sadr's followers fought a two-month rebellion against U.S. forces in April that died down after a series of truces. But on Monday, U.S. Marines clashed with al-Sadr militiamen near the cleric's house, and a woman and three other bystanders were killed. Mahdi Army militiamen have seized 18 police officers and two police cars in recent days, hoping to get some of their comrades out of prison, according to a Najaf police official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Najaf's governor, Adnan al-Zurufi, confirmed a number of policemen were abducted. -- I guess we should have killed him when we had the chance a few months ago. This guy is bad news...we should just take him and his followers OUT. I know it sounds easier said than done, but the fact remains that he is a danger to all around him. He must be taken out. Andrew B.

 Introduction The Iraqi interim government under Prime Minister Iyad Allawi was constituted on June 18, 2004, following concerted and coordinated efforts by the United Nations Special Representative to Iraq Lakhdhar Al-Ibrahimi, Iraq's Governing Council (IGC), and the Coalition Provisional Administration (CPA). On June 28, sovereignty was transferred to the interim government by the CPA. As a result, the CPA ceased to exist, the IGC was dissolved, and Mr. Al-Ibrahimi returned to his headquarters in New York. But the mechanism left behind has started to function as a de facto government. Although this government has been in power a little over a month, it has made a sufficient mark on both the internal and external policies of Iraq. The following is an interim progress report: [1] The Challenges Facing the Interim Government From the outset, Allawi has faced almost insurmountable challenges. In addition to daily acts of terrorism directed mainly against police stations, Iraq faces the threats of the unpredictable and often radical Shi'ite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr and his Mahdi Army. There are the Sunnis who feel marginalized in the post-Saddam Iraq and therefore feed into the resistance and even the terrorist movement. There are the Kurds, who remain suspicious about the intentions of the Iraqi Arabs regarding the Kurdish aspirations for autonomy within a federated Iraq, whom he must avoid alienating. Allawi has to perform a balancing act vis-à-vis the multinational forces, primarily the dominant American forces, without being seen as a tool of American policy. He has to demonstrate that Iraq has regained its sovereignty, but at the same time he cannot conceal his dependence on the American forces to keep the situation in the country relatively under control. Most of all he has to deal with a stagnant economy, a dilapidated infrastructure, and a high rate of unemployment which persists because while massive amounts of aid have been committed to Iraq by the U.S. and a variety of other donors, the security situation has prevented the government from embarking upon reconstruction programs and creating new jobs. Additionally, Allawi is faced with pressure on Iraq's eastern and western frontiers from two authoritarian regimes, Iran and Syria, which have allowed their borders with Iraq to turn into almost open crossing points for Islamists of various degrees of extremism, committed to fighting America on Iraqi soil. These two regimes, while clearly concerned that a democratic culture in Iraq could spill over their borders and cause political ferment and instability, complain vociferously about the absence of an elected government in Baghdad, a form of government which neither of them has had for decades. All these challenges would represent a tall order for any government, let alone a government whose members face a daily threat of annihilation by car bombs, suicide attacks, and other lethal weapons. -- There is more on the website.

 Which states in Africa are terrorist havens? Experts say many nations on the continent bear watching as current or potential havens for international terrorists. A failed state like Somalia has long been a breeding ground for extremists, and Sudan’s previous links to al Qaeda are well-documented. But experts warn that any African nation with the combustible mix of a weak central government, widespread poverty, and an increasingly politicized Muslim population is at risk. Why is there increasing concern about terrorism in Africa? Many experts say that Africa, with several war-ravaged areas and vast swathes of ungoverned territory, offers ideal conditions for extremists seeking to establish a foothold. “There are many areas where the government is not in control,” says Jonathon Schanzer, Soref fellow at the Washington Institute of Near East Policy and author of the forthcoming book, “Al Qaeda’s Armies: Middle East Affiliate Groups, Ungoverned Territories and the Next Generation of Terror.” “If you can’t seal your borders and there are areas that no one’s watching, it leaves the opportunity for exploitation,” he says. Daniel Byman, assistant professor at Georgetown’s School of Foreign Service and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution’s Saban Center for Middle East Policy, says there are large Muslim or Arab populations in several African countries that may be sympathetic to al Qaeda and other terror groups. In those countries, “it’s logical that you would find some significant presence” of terrorists, he says. Is Islamic fundamentalism on the rise in Africa? Yes, experts say. “As a result of the madrassas and Wahhabi funding, some Muslim populations are increasingly identifying more with their religion than their nationality,” says Joseph Siegle, Douglas Dillon fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. Many of the religious schools known as madrassas that Siegle refers to teach the strict Wahhabi form of Islam promoted and underwritten by Saudi Arabia. The resulting growth in young Muslim leaders who seek to guide their countries along “pure” religious paths worries some experts, who say the United States is not doing enough to combat this new threat. “Countering the rise of grass-roots extremism has been a central part of U.S. strategy in the Middle East, but the same has not generally been true for Africa,” warn Africa specialists Princeton N. Lyman and J. Stephen Morrison in an article in the January/February issue of Foreign Affairs titled “The Terrorist Threat in Africa.” Does al Qaeda have a presence in Africa? Yes, concentrated in East and North Africa. U.S. officials have described the Horn of Africa—a region that includes Sudan, Somalia, Kenya, Djibouti, Tanzania, and other nations—as a front line of the war on terror. A U.S. anti-terror force of 1,800 troops is currently based in Djibouti. -- There is more...and it is awesome. The article really goes into detail about the future of Africa and terrorism. It's going to be a hotbed really soon, if not already. Andrew B.

 (Hat Tip: Teri) Wednesday, July 28, 2004 WASHINGTON — U.S. Muslim groups say they should have had more input on the Sept. 11 commission's final report, which they say fails to lay out a comprehensive plan to win the hearts and minds of Muslims overseas. "Why would they fail to consult a key group who could help them understand what's going on in the Muslim world?" said Ibrahim Hooper, spokesman for the Washington-based Council on American-Islamic Relations (search). The groups, reacting to the commission's final report, called the recommendations a "step in the right direction," but ultimately inadequate in addressing terrorism's root causes they think U.S. actions don't match the rhetoric of freedom, they said. "The report describes a message of standing for freedom and opportunity. Step number one to push any message is that we ourselves should live up to it," said Maher Hathout, a senior adviser for the Muslim Public Affairs Council (search). He noted as an example the alleged abuse of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison (search). The groups cited the report's failure to explore the impact of U.S. policy toward the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as well as whether the war in Iraq has made the Middle East and United States safer or at greater risk to terrorism. In its final report, the panel of five Republicans and five Democrats recommends reshaping foreign policy with a "preventive strategy that is as much, or more, political as it is military." To reach unanimity, commissioners avoided the contentious issue of Iraq. They also took no position on Israeli-Palestinian relations. Khaled Medhat Abou El Fadl, a visiting professor at Yale Law School who specializes in Islamic law, testified before the commission in December on U.S. Muslim immigrants and their fears of unlawful detentions after the attacks. He did not address conditions abroad. The commission's report says the United States should work to spread a message of freedom and opportunity in the Arab and Muslim world so terror groups cannot find sanctuary in "lawless places" such as Pakistan, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia. "We should offer an example of moral leadership in the world, committed to treat people humanely, abide by the rule of law, and be generous and caring to our neighbors," the report states. "If we heed the views of thoughtful leaders in the Arab and Muslim world, a moderate consensus can be found." One step to building consensus, the advocacy groups said, is to stop identifying the 9/11 problem and its aftermath as "Islamist" terrorism, which appears to unfairly attack Islam or "Islamic" religion as a whole. In the final report, "Islamist" refers to the extremist groups bent on harming the United States. "'Islamist' is one of those hot-button terms that are ill-defined or not defined at all," Hooper said. "They're basically saying this is a label for Muslims we don't like or agree with." -- You have to be kidding me right? Andrew B.

 From the August 9, 2004 issue: On whether any of Saddam's loot made its way into Osama's pockets. by Claudia Rosett 08/09/2004, Volume 009, Issue 45 IF, as the 9/11 Commission concludes, our "failure of imagination" left America open to the attacks of September 11, then surely some imagination is called for in tackling one of the riddles that stumped the commission: Where exactly did Osama bin Laden get the funding to set up shop in Afghanistan, reach around the globe, and strike the United States? So let's do some imagining. Unfashionable though it may be, let's even imagine a money trail that connects Saddam Hussein to al Qaeda. By 1996, remember, bin Laden had been run out of Sudan, and seems to have been out of money. He needed a fresh bundle to rent Afghanistan from the Taliban, train recruits, expand al Qaeda's global network, and launch what eventually became the 9/11 attacks. Meanwhile, over in Iraq about that same time, Saddam Hussein, after a lean stretch under United Nations sanctions, had just cut his Oil-for-Food deal with the U.N., and soon began exploiting that program to embezzle billions meant for relief. Both Saddam and bin Laden were, in their way, seasoned businessmen. Both had a taste for war. Both hated America. By the late 1990s, Saddam, despite continuing sanctions, was solidly back in business, socking away his purloined billions in secret accounts, but he had no way to attack the United States directly. Bin Laden needed millions to fund al Qaeda, which could then launch a direct strike on the United States. Whatever the differences between Saddam and bin Laden, their circumstances by the late 1990s had all the makings of a deal. Pocket change for Saddam, financial security for bin Laden, and satisfaction for both--death to Americans. Now let's talk facts. In 1996, Sudan kicked out bin Laden. He went to Afghanistan, arriving there pretty much bankrupt, according to the 9/11 Commission report. His family inheritance was gone, his allowance had been cut off, and Sudan had confiscated his local assets. Yet, just two years later, bin Laden was back on his feet, feeling strong enough to issue a public declaration of war on America. In February 1998, in a London-based Arabic newspaper, Al-Quds al-Arabi, he published his infamous fatwa exhorting Muslims to "kill the Americans and plunder their money." Six months later, in August 1998, al Qaeda finally went ahead with its long-planned bombing of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Bin Laden was back in the saddle, and over the next three years he shaped al Qaeda into the global monster that finally struck on American soil. His total costs, by the estimates of the 9/11 Commission report, ran to tens of millions of dollars. Even for a terrorist beloved of extremist donors, that's a pretty good chunk of change. -- Read the rest...very informative. You really have to wonder... Andrew B.

 By Mark Trevelyan BERLIN (Reuters) - North Korea is deploying new land- and sea-based ballistic missiles that can carry nuclear warheads and may have sufficient range to hit the United States, according to the authoritative Jane's Defense Weekly. In an article due to appear Wednesday, Jane's said the two new systems appeared to be based on a decommissioned Soviet submarine-launched ballistic missile, the R-27. It said communist North Korea had acquired the know-how during the 1990s from Russian missile specialists and by buying 12 former Soviet submarines which had been sold for scrap metal but retained key elements of their missile launch systems. Jane's, which did not specify its sources, said the sea-based missile was potentially the more threatening of the two new weapons systems. "It would fundamentally alter the missile threat posed by the DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) and could finally provide its leadership with something that it has long sought to obtain -- the ability to directly threaten the continental U.S.," the weekly said. Apart from targeting the United States, South Korea or Japan, cash-strapped North Korea might seek to sell the technology to countries that have bought its missiles in the past, with Iran a prime candidate, the article added. Ian Kemp, news editor of Jane's Defense Weekly, said North Korea would only spend the money and effort on developing such missiles if it intended to fit them with nuclear warheads. "It's pretty certain the North Koreans would not be developing these unless they were intended for weapons of mass destruction warheads, and the nuclear warhead is far and away the most potent of those," he told Reuters. -- Oh this is relaxing news.

 August 3, 2004 -- Investigators suspect terrorist moles worked at the Citigroup and Prudential buildings to case the skyscrapers as potential targets of car or truck bombs, The Post has learned. And now federal agents want to comb through employee records of the businesses that operate in the buildings to try to identify the moles, law-enforcement sources said yesterday. The feds suspect that the extraordinarily detailed information about the skyscrapers — which was discovered on an al Qaeda computer in Pakistan — was compiled by accomplices who had time to study Citigroup's 59-story building at Lexington Avenue and 53rd Street and Prudential's building in Newark from the inside, the sources said. Officials who examined the information concluded that the most recent surveillance of the buildings was done in January. There was additional surveillance last year, a law-enforcement source said. But most of it was done even before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks — and goes back to 2000. Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said yesterday that the terrorists' information was "vulnerability analysis" — which details how well or poorly guarded the targets are — and that there is no indication that it was "tied to any operational plan." -- How am I not surprised by this news.

 Accuses its leadership of not carrying out real reform. Says it is responsible for situation in which 50% of territory offered today while 2 years ago 98% discussed. Marwan Athamna “The Palestinian Authority must carry out a real reform and tell the Arab world what it wants of it”, Abdullah King of Jordan told the Arab satellite network al-Arabiya on Tuesday. Abudllah harshly criticized the PA and said that because of the way it handled the situation, Israel today is offering it only 50% of territory that was conquered during the Six Day war, while two years ago, over 98% of the territory was discussed. “In the past, compensation to Palestinian refugees was discussed while today only a marginal return of these refugees are mentioned; we don’t even know what the situation would be like in a year or two”, the king added. According to Abdullah, the Palestinian leadership must clarify its position “so it won’t surprise us every time with new decisions or proposals, which were once considered a betrayal, while today they are depicted as a triumph”. In spite of recent difficulties, the Jordanian ruler expressed hope that the peace process would resume. “Today, more than in the past, the Palestinian leadership must take advantage of the situation in order to make peace and to amend its mistakes which caused the entire world to point its finger at it”, he said. Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qorei (Abu Ala) reacted strongly against the king’s remarks. Abdullah’s remarks are very severe accusations, he said. “We will send a delegation to Amman to try and understand what made him say what he had said”. Palestinian Communications Minister Imad Al-Faluji said, “It is a shame that the Jordanian king chooses to criticize one side rather than the other”. -- I am shocked that a major figure in the Arab world would say something like this...but we'll see what kind of teeth it has on PA.

The explosion went off when Palestinian residents gathered to inspect the damage caused by the army, which demolished six homes and damaged three others during its overnight operation. An army spokesman said it was not immediately clear what caused the explosion. (AP Photo/Khalil Hamra) -- Ok, where to begin on this one. Don't you just love the AP's vile anti-Israel diatribe? With sentences like this: after an explosion killed at least three people and wounded several in the area where the Israeli army has been conducting an operation in the southern Gaza Strip (news - web sites) town of Rafah Tuesday Aug. 3, 2004. Let's break this down. First of all...AP doesn't give you any CONTEXT to why these three people died. It was because they were trying to plant a roadside bomb and it went off on them, prematurely. The AP tries to make you believe that it was the Israelis that caused the deaths of these three people. How irresponsible of the AP to not even do any investigation to the truth...they just make it up as they go along. It's amazing what they get away with. They won't get away with it this time. I am keeping an eye on them. Andrew B.

 By PAUL HAVEN, Associated Press Writer ISLAMABAD, Pakistan - Pakistani authorities have arrested at least two al-Qaida suspects in recent days, both believed to be linked to others in custody who provided intelligence leading to the arrest of a key terror suspect and Washington's issuing a terror attack warning, officials said Tuesday. One of the men identified himself as Juma Ibrahim, a Syrian. He was arrested Sunday at a bus station in Hafizabad, a town near the eastern city of Lahore, and was turned over to Pakistan's spy agency, said district police chief Aslam Ghauri. A government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said another man was arrested trying to board a plane in Lahore with questionable documents. The official said "several" al-Qaida-linked suspects were arrested, but he gave no further details. It was not clear how significant the latest detainees were, but the official said they were believed to be linked to other al-Qaida suspects in custody, including a computer expert identified as Mohammad Naeem Noor Khan who was arrested July 13. Information provided by Khan led to the arrest in eastern Gujrat on July 25 of Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, a Tanzanian al-Qaida suspect wanted in the United States for the 1998 twin East Africa embassy bombings, said an intelligence official in the eastern city of Lahore who was involved in the raid on Ghailani. Update: Pakistan nets 18 suspects as Al-Qaeda hunt moves east to cities (AFP) ISLAMABAD (AFP) - An intensive swoop by Pakistan on Al-Qaeda cells in the east of the country has netted at least 18 Al-Qaeda suspects including four African operatives and a computer mastermind, a senior security official told AFP. The latest crackdown has taken Pakistan's Al-Qaeda hunters far from the terror network's traditional sanctuaries in rugged northwest tribal lands bordering Afghanistan (news - web sites) to the dense eastern cities and towns of the Punjab, its most populous province. The captures have also netted "valuable information" from computer records, cds, emails, detailed maps of Islamabad airport, documents and photos of key financial institutions in New York, Washington and Newark.

 By SAMEER N. YACOUB, Associated Press Writer BAGHDAD, Iraq - Insurgent bombers killed four Iraqi national guardsmen, a police chief and a patrolman Tuesday in the militants' unrelenting attacks against the country's security forces. Also, two U.S. soldiers were killed and two others wounded by a roadside bomb late Monday in Iraq (news - web sites)'s capital, while two American Marines died of wounds received in fighting in Anbar Province west of Baghdad, the military said. One of the Marines died during the Monday engagement; the second died Tuesday from his wounds in that fighting. The national guardsmen were killed when a car bomb hit their post north of Baquoba. Six guardsmen were wounded, said National Guard Lt. Mohammed al-Duleimi. -- This is a message to PM Allawi. Take off the gloves. Do what you need to do to get rid of this scourge. Destroy them.

 MADRID (AFP) - Spain accused Britain of clinging to its imperial past to the detriment of good relations with its EU partner as the Royal Navy prepared to celebrate three centuries of British rule over Gibraltar. "It is strange in the 21st century that the military occupation of part of one member state by another should be commemorated within the European Union (news - web sites)," Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos said in an article published by the daily El Pais. Wednesday is the 300th anniversary of the capture by British forces of a tiny peninsula on the southern coast of Spain dominated by a 408-metre (1,326-foot) peak overlooking a narrow strait separating Europe from North Africa. Although Spain ceded the 6.5 square kilometres (2.5 sq miles) of land including the "Rock" to Britain by the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, it has never given up its claim to the territory. "The question of Gibraltar is fully open," Moratinos wrote, adding that he wanted "a realistic solution to Europe's last vestige of colonialism." -- Oh boy we knew it was coming, but I guess never this soon. Gibraltar is now Europe's West Bank.... "It is strange in the 21st century that the military occupation of part of one member state by another should be commemorated within the European Union..." They said the word...yup you guessed it.... "OCCUPATION" . That's today's KEYWORD. So now Europe is trying to internalize the problems in the Middle East by blaming others about old problems...today. Interesting. I wonder how Freud would have viewed this arguement? Andrew B. P.S. - Random tid-bit of the day: Did you know Gibraltar is the ONLY place in Europe where Monkeys exist in the wild? There is a small wooded area on the Rock itself and monkeys live there as well as walk around the towns. Thought I would relay that information to you...in face here is a picture of one...

 By NADIA ABOU EL-MAGD, Associated Press Writer CAIRO, Egypt - A group claiming to represent al-Qaida in Europe repeated threats against Britain, Italy, Bulgaria and other nations with forces in Iraq (news - web sites) in a Web statement Tuesday. But the statement denied that the group, calling itself Abu Hafs al-Masri Brigade Europe, had demanded that Italy withdraw its troops from Iraq within 15 days. The ultimatum, also signed Hafs al-Masri Brigade, was posted on the Web on Sunday. Tuesday's statement was one in a series of claims and counterclaims in recent days that illustrate the difficulties of determining the authenticity of such Web threats or whether those that post them have any ability to carry them out. The Abu Hafs al-Masri Brigade takes its name from a top al-Qaida lieutenant who was killed in a U.S. airstrike in Afghanistan (news - web sites) in 2001. It has claimed responsibility for a number of attacks on Western targets, including the March 11 train bombings in Spain. Counterterrorism experts question whether the group has any agents capable of launching attacks and say some of its claims are obviously false or exaggerated. -- Let the games begin...this is a game of chicken...Halal style. We will see who flinches first. Andrew B.

 By NADIA ABOU EL-MAGD, Associated Press Writer CAIRO, Egypt - The Palestinian militant group Hamas has issued a video threatening daily attacks on the Israeli town of Sderot unless soldiers halt a monthlong operation aimed at stopping rocket attacks. Hamas, blamed for dozens of suicide bombings in Israel, has not issued such video threats in the past. The video aired Tuesday on the pan-Arab television station Al-Arabiya featured three masked men surrounded by weapons and standing before a green flag emblazoned with the Muslim credo: "There is no god but God and Mohammed is his prophet." One of the men reads a statement threatening to rain rockets on the Israeli town of Sderot and identifying his group as "the Brigades of the Martyr Izz al-Din al-Qassam," Hamas's military wing. "We will continue to shell you every day to see what your defeated army will do for you," the Hamas threat said. "Oh residents of Sderot, stop your army from carrying out their crimes and get them out of Beit Hanoun otherwise you will play the price." -- Ok...gloves off. Go in and get these freaks before they kill again. That's it. No negotiating. It's over...the INFANTADA is over. Andrew B.

 This article was originally in the Wall Street Journal...then FoxNews picked it up and has really helped to tell this kid's story. HUSAYBAH, Iraq -- One day in December, a smooth-chinned 14-year-old approached American soldiers at a checkpoint here and asked surreptitiously to be arrested. He told the soldiers that his father, an Iraqi Army officer under Saddam Hussein, led a 40-man cell of insurgents, and he agreed to show the troops where to find the men and their weapons. The soldiers put a sack over the teen's head, loosely cuffed his hands and led him away to a new life as an informant. U.S. officials say he has provided a wealth of military intelligence, allowing them to capture numerous insurgents in Iraq over the past six months. But the teenager's decision to turn on his father, who he says beat him, has cost him his family and his freedom. Since he began cooperating with the Americans, he has lived among U.S. troops, knowing that losing their protection would mean almost certain death at the hands of those he betrayed. With the handover of sovereignty to an Iraqi government less than three weeks away, the troops who have used and befriended the teen are desperately seeking a way to get him to the U.S. The soldiers aren't sure how they can legally take the boy -- who isn't an orphan -- out of the country without it looking like Americans are stealing Iraqi children while there is no local government to stop them. It isn't likely he would qualify for entry into the U.S. without special governmental dispensation. And even if soldiers get him to the U.S., they'd still have to find an American family willing to take in an illiterate, street-hardened youngster who speaks little English. Insurgents in Iraq know the teen's identity and that he has provided information to the Americans, according to the U.S. military. While U.S. commanders asked that his name and tribal affiliation not be disclosed, they are eager for publicity that might help the boy gain entry to the U.S. His story has been pieced together from interviews with him and U.S. military personnel, and from military records. While aspects of his personal history couldn't be verified because people involved are either dead, in U.S. custody elsewhere in Iraq or have moved, soldiers and Marines who have dealt with the teen say information he has provided about the insurgency has been accurate. The boy grew up in Husaybah, a border city of some 100,000, known for its smugglers of weapons, gasoline and other goods. His father was a powerful man around town, thanks to his ties to the Hussein regime. Speaking through a military interpreter, the teen says he had completed the equivalent of the third grade when he dropped out of school at age 13. He can't read or write Arabic, except for a few simple words. Some of his family memories are warm. He remembers his father happily cooking rice and dolma, grape leaves stuffed with mutton, tomatoes, peas and spices. But he also recalls the time his father brought home photos that pictured him beating a bound man with inch-thick cables. He thinks his father was trying to impress his mother with a show of force. His father appeared to snap, the teen says, after Mr. Hussein's regime fell in April 2003. He says his father spent time and money to build a network of insurgents to fight the Americans, and succumbed to frequent rages, beating his children more severely than ever before. Once, he says, his father tied his left hand to his left foot, and right hand to his right foot, and beat him "with anything that came into his hands." His body bears witness to the violence around him. His scalp is a roadmap of scars from beatings and an accident. The skin on the back of his left hand is disfigured from the time he says his father accused him of stealing money and used a red-hot spoon to punish him. The teen recalls crying for days, in part because his mother didn't come to his rescue. He says he joined the resistance at his father's insistence, and never fired a shot. During his first operation, an ambush of an American patrol in November, he wedged himself into a pile of garbage from a local hospital, he says, trying to hide. He pulled his long-sleeved black T-shirt -- the battle dress of the local mujahedeen -- over his nose to mask the stench. Then he says he hid his AK-47 rifle amid the soiled syringes and empty food cans, and ran home to his mother. After the gunplay died down, the teen says he retrieved his rifle from the trash, emptied bullets from his magazines, and told his father he had fired at the Americans. His father patted him on the shoulder and said, "I'm proud of you," according to the boy. "You did a good job, my son." The Americans are all "Jews and Christians," he recalls his father saying. "They are strangers occupying our country. God will send our souls to paradise for fighting them." A while later, his father and others placed a bomb some 30 yards from an overpass above a stream and waited until a military convoy passed, he says. The idea was to flush the troops out with the explosion, then gun them down as they left their vehicles. The teen says he was supposed to fire on the soldiers. Instead, he says he hid under the bridge in shallow water during the attack, hitting his head on a steel bar and opening a long gash on his head. The scar that runs back-to-front down the middle of his head is a result of that, he says. He spent the night concealed under the overpass, narrowly escaping capture, he says, by an American soldier sweeping the area with a flashlight attached to his rifle. -- Please read the rest...at the link above.

 (Hat tip: Teri) Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat on Saturday called for a cease-fire with Israel during the upcoming Olympic games in Greece, but Israel dismissed the offer as insincere. In ancient Greece, the Olympic Truce lasted from a week before the Olympic games began until a week following, to allow participants and viewers to travel to the games and return home safely. Arafat issued the call at a lighting ceremony for a symbolic Olympic torch at his headquarters in Ramallah. "On the occasion of lighting the Palestinian Olympic torch, I declare our respect and commitment for an Olympic Truce, which I signed in my besieged office," Arafat said. "We hope that the revival of the ancient and noble Greek tradition will help in creating a world that enjoys peace, justice and security for the coming generations," he said. I would have responded like this, had Allah not beaten me to the punch. Meanwhile, more on the PLO Arab representation at the Games. Palestinian officials have said they plan on sending a swimmer, fifteen terrorists, two runners and a boxer to the Olympic games, which are to take place August 13-29. Although these are the only sports in which PLO Arabs will be represented, their Olympic training encompassed a broader range of Olympic sports. In an Israellycool exclusive, we have obtained pictures from the various training sessions. -- You have to see the photos...it's a riot! I was laughing for 5 minutes straight!!! Andrew B.

 Most Kurds are familiar with the fact that Kurds and Jews have been friends for thousands of years. Most Jews are not. Most Arabs know that there is cooperation between Israel and the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG). Officially, this is all very secret and based on plausible denial. Why is this so? There was very close cooperation between Israel and the KDP in the years 1965-75. During most of that time there were usually some 20 military specialists stationed in a secret location in southern Kurdistan. Rehavam Zeevi and Moshe Dayan were among Israeli generals who served in Kurdistan. The Israelis trained the large Kurdish army of Mustafa Barzani and even led Kurdish troops in battle. In 1966, Kurdish troops led by colonel Tzuri Saguy of Israeli military intelligence wiped out an entire Iraqi brigade, i.e. about 5 000 Iraqi soldiers. Israel was able to assist the Kurds only because the Shah and the United States allowed it to do so. Everything was “secret” as requested by Israel’s Kurdish partners. Mullah Barzani’s royal “friend” in Teheran sold out the Kurds to Saddam in 1975. The KDP could no longer guarantee the security of the Israeli guests and they were thus evacuated. Rather than fighting to the last man the KDP leadership preferred to flee to Iran. The Shah gave the KDP leadership a suburb of its own in Teheran. The grateful KDP leadership declared that the Shah was their greatest friend and blamed their disaster on the Jews. The malicious and libellous claim that Israel somehow abandoned its Kurdish allies is still promulgated by people with much Kurdish blood on their hands. The truth is that Israel never abandoned the Kurdish people despite the flaws of its Kurdish allies. The 1975 Iranian sell-out of the Kurds was a major strategic defeat for Israel in the region and was followed by an even greater strategic loss in 1979. This meant that Israel no longer had any ally to the east of Israel’s eastern front. There are two books published in Hebrew that describe the 1965-75 relationship.[1] -- The article goes on...and it is a great eye opener. Andrew B.

 By David G. Littman FrontPageMagazine.com | August 13, 2004 The following statement -- delivered by the representative of the World Union for Progressive Judaism on the floor of the UN Sub-Commission on Human Rights in Geneva on Wednesday, August 10, 2004 -- concerns the abominable atrocities taking place in Sudan. The inability of the UN once again to act effectively in another clear case of genocidal ethnic cleansing -- even after Rwanda in 1994 -- deserves the widest publicity. FrontPage magazine is happy to call these injustices to the forefront of the civilized world's consciousness. -- The Editors. Sir, the humanitarian disaster unfolding in Darfour – over 50,000 people killed and 2.2 million displaced from their homes, and in urgent need of relief aid – includes the systematic rape of African Muslim women and girls, as well as their enslavement. In her scathing Report to the Commission on the situation in the Sudan, released last Friday, the Special Rapporteur on extra-judicial killings could not have been clearer on the motives. This is arousing an international solidarity, a subject addressed by Mr. Dos Santos Alves in his working paper. Ms. Asma Jahangir states: “A large number of people whom I met had a strong perception that the Government was pursuing a policy of ‘Arabization’ of the Sudan, and, in particular, the Darfur region. Allegedly, those of Arab descent seek to portray themselves as ‘pure’ Muslims, as opposed to Muslims of African ethnicity.” She also reported that many people she interviewed recalled the cries for help from Darfur had gone out for several years, and that clashes between Arab nomads and sedentary African farmers since the droughts of the 1970s and 1980s had been noted by a previous UN Rapporteur in 1997. It is enough to reread his Reports from 1993 to 1998 to understand, then and now, the present situation – and in Southern Sudan. Based on his full documentation, we published a documentary article in the Sepember 1996 Middle East Quarterly, entitled “The UN Finds Slavery in the Sudan.” -- Incredibly disgusting...how the UN and the rest of the world are USELESS when it comes to stopping a 'Genocide". They put together words on paper, while REAL people are being HACKED to death in the Sudan. It's so BIZARRO how these "DIPLOMATS" think and work...nothing gets done. Andrew B.

 Hi Friends One begins to realize in these days the profound wisdom of the Holy Koran where it is repeatedly emphasized that hypocrites are the worst kind of people. Muqtada Al Sadr claims that he is fighting against “Tyranny” and “Occupation”; but his main weapon consists in “terrorizing” all those his followers can reach who are mainly the poor ordinary people and government employees who have the misfortune to live in the slums and poor areas infested by his men. Kidnapping, intimidation, torture and murder are his favorite weapons. He frequently claims that he is the sole representative of the people and everybody else who disagrees with him is an agent and puppet and to be completely dismissed. Now this is the essence and substance of dictatorship. Who gave him this mandate we would like to know? what ballot box; what popular referendum? The same kind of claim we hear often from the other “Turbans”, such as the “Association of Islamic Scholars” who frequently declare that they represent all the Sunni people of Iraq, when again we don’t know who gave them this “sole and exclusive” representation rights? The first (Mr. Muqtada), nobody has ever heard of, apart from his direct circle, in the days before the fall of the regime, whereas many of the venerable members of the “Association”, were the same preachers appointed by Saddams’ “Mukhabarat” (Intelligence Agency) to the main mosques in Baghdad and elsewhere to replace the original less reliable clergy. Both these are entirely self-appointed. Both are a Godsend to those who wish to subvert the country and prevent stability and progress at any cost. -- I think this is great. I wish more and more Muslims around the world would stand up and say this DOES NOT represent Islam. Muslims are afraid to come out and say something for they fear the consequences of their actions. They should not have to fear...but this is reality in the Muslim world. i wish there was something I can do to change that, but these things take time. There is nothing that you and I can do...(as non-Muslims) to change Islam. Islam needs to change from within. I know I have said it in the past and I know I will say it again in the near future.

The explosion caused Palestinian casualties and the injuries of six border police soldiers, three of them seriously. In the past few days since the terrorist attack, the members of the terrorist cell responsible for planning and executing the terror attack were arrested in a joint operation of the IDF the GSS and the Israeli police. Several hours after the terror attack Bassam Mustaffa Asad Abid, a 29 years old taxi driver was arrested in Rammallah. His investigation revealed information which led to the arrest of Mohammed Fathy Div Ayosh, 27 years old, on July 12. Both Abid and Ayosh are residents of the Arabe village, located next to Jenin. -- Truly an amazing finding...who would have guessed that the "Palestinian" terrorists would be using a loophole as a way to commit murder.

 Anti-Semitic graffiti, including a sign saying "death to Jews," was found scrawled Saturday on a wall on the grounds of Notre Dame Cathedral. Police cordoned off part of the esplanade in front of the cathedral in central Paris that draws thousands of tourists daily in the summer. The graffiti, written in black marker, included a swastika. It was discovered around 10 a.m. (0800 GMT) Saturday on a low wall that runs along the side of the cathedral facing the Seine River. Three stones of the wall had been dislodged, police said. Paris Mayor Bertrand Delanoe said he was "saddened and sickened" by the anti-Semitic vandalism. "I deeply hope that those responsible for this new insult to the values of our civilization will be quickly identified and severely sanctioned," the mayor said. -- The situation in France is getting so bad that more and more Jews from that country are flocking to Israel. I wouldn't surprised if the rest of the Jews from France left France within 5 years time. It's that bad, from what I read. Andrew B.

 The Ideology of Martyrdom is Spreading Now in Our [Islamic] Nation "… Dear brothers in faith: "The ideology of martyrdom is spreading now in our [Islamic] nation, praise be to Allah, Lord of the universe; and it exposes the [falsehood of the] People of the Book [2] and of those who claim that it is their prerogative to be close to Allah in the hereafter on the Day of Judgment, and especially [the falsehood of] the Jews who claim that they are God's deputies on earth - but they are lying. This past week, this man, Mordechai Vanunu, exposed once again the Jewish state, after having converted to Christianity and having abandoned their religion. He exposed Israel's nuclear program, which the oppressive great power [America] wants to overlook. Because they [the Jews] are afraid of death and are afraid to fight honorably, so they want to kill people with weapons of mass destruction, and they want this weapon to be in their hands but not in the hands of others. It has become clear to anyone with two eyes, to any fair-minded person, that the safety and security of Israel means today the loss of security for the whole world. The security of the whole world should be lost in order that this cancerous, fabricated, and iniquitous state should survive. The whole world should be deprived of its security for Israel to continue to exist on its iniquity and aggression. "However, they control the media and they want to blind the sight of people. They buy the conscience of the heads of state that rule us and the protection of the sheikhs who put themselves at the service of these heads of state. This is not uncommon. This should open the eyes of people: If that man [Vanunu] who is of Jewish extraction did it, what can be said of Muslims, even Muslim clerics, who hold diplomatic passports, and [yet] are reluctant to serve the cause of Islam and the Muslims and betray Allah's words for a meager price." -- What a nice guy al-Masri is...he's so honest and forthright. I guess we have to be "TOLERANT" of his views. Just because he hates me as a Jew doesn't make him a bad guy, right? We should roll out the red carpet for this guy...he's expressing his views. Wow, he's so diplomatic...he has thoughts and views...he must be smart or even better qualified to give ideas about hate.

 ISLAMABAD (AFP) - Pakistan's Interior Minister Faisal Saleh Hayat has accused Islamist parties of having links with Osama bin Laden (news - web sites)'s Al-Qaeda terror network, a report said. He said all recent arrests of Al-Qaeda suspects in Pakistan led authorities to the offices of Islamist parties. "All the Al-Qaeda operatives arrested (recently) were picked up from their (religious parties) regional headquarters," the Daily Times newspaper quoted Hayat as telling the federal parliament Friday. Hayat alleged that the religious parties were supporting the terror activities of Al-Qaeda. The Islamists had targetted him with questions and allegations the government was going to launch a military action in southwest Baluchistan province, bordering Afghanistan (news - web sites). -- This guy is really sticking his head out...and taking a real risk.

 By Charles Aldinger WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States plans to withdraw about 70,000 troops from Europe and Asia in a major realignment of American military presence prompted by the end of the Cold War and the beginning of the war on terrorism, U.S. officials said on Saturday. President Bush (news - web sites) will unveil the move to make the high-tech military much more mobile in a speech on Monday to the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Cincinnati, Ohio, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "The president is going to make an announcement about a major initiative to reduce the burden on our forces overseas," said one of the U.S. officials. They confirmed a report in the Financial Times of a total shift of at least 70,000 troops from overseas to home bases. The British newspaper, citing people briefed on the plan, said two-thirds of the reductions would be made in Europe, mostly in Germany. "Germany is definitely a place where there will be a major rearrangement," one U.S. official told Reuters of plans to bring two big armored units back to the United States from there. -- Take them all out of France, Germany and Belgium and put them in Poland, Ukraine and Azerbaijan...that makes more sense.

 By ABDUL HUSSEIN AL-OBEIDI, Associated Press Writer NAJAF, Iraq - Truce talks aimed at ending more than a week of violence between Shiite militants and U.S. and Iraqi forces in the holy city of Najaf broke down Saturday, Iraqi National Security Adviser Mouwaffaq al-Rubaie said. It was not clear if the breakdown would lead to an immediate renewal of the fierce fighting between followers of firebrand Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr and the combined coalition-Iraqi force that shook Najaf's streets with gunfire and explosions since Aug. 5. The battles ended early Friday as the negotiations started. Aides to al-Sadr blamed the United States for the breakdown and said there had been progress until the other side abruptly ended talks. Al-Rubaie said the talks had been going nowhere. "I feel deep sorrow and regret to announce the failure of the efforts we have exerted to end the crisis in Iraq (news - web sites) peacefully," he said. "Our goal was to spare blood, preserve security and for the militias to put down their weapons." -- What a surprise that these "negotiations" fell apart...ummm has anyone thought about who were are dealing with? This isn't a the chess team from Howell, NJ...these are terrorists from the heart of darkness itself. Andrew B.

 GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip - About 100 unemployed university graduates stormed a Palestinian Authority (news - web sites) building in a Gaza Strip (news - web sites) refugee camp Saturday, holing up inside and demanding jobs. The graduates — all of them unarmed — said the Palestinian Authority promised them employment and failed to live up to its obligation. Negotiations between police in the Khan Younis refugee camp and the protesters were underway. Turmoil has plagued the Gaza Strip and West Bank in recent weeks. -- That is what I am going to do to my local congressman here in New Jersey, if I don't have a job. Very civil...very moderate...very "Palestinian". Andrew B.

 DUBAI, United Arab Emirates - Militants linked to Osama bin Laden (news - web sites)'s al-Qaida terror network have claimed responsibility for the killing of an Irish engineer earlier this month, according to a statement posted on the Internet. The statement said "one of the mujahedeen (holy fighters) brigades killed an Irish engineer at his workplace in Riyadh." It gave no other information about the killers. The claim appeared on an Internet periodical seen as the voice of al-Qaida's operation in Saudi Arabia, called the Voice of Jihad (holy war). It could not immediately be verified. Armed men ki lled Anthony Christopher Higgins, 63, on Aug. 3 after storming into his Riyadh office firing machine guns. It was the second killing of an Irishman in the Saudi capital in two months. Simon Cumbers, 36, a British Broadcasting Corp. cameraman from Navan, Ireland, was shot and killed while filming in Riyadh on June 6. -- As always...lovely people from the RoP at it again. Lovely. (sarcasm) Andrew B.

 By BASSEM MROUE, Associated Press Writer BEIRUT, Lebanon - Lebanon criticized French efforts to ban the militant group Hezbollah's television station, saying the channel may be anti-Israeli but it is not anti-Semitic. France's Council of State is expected to act later this month on a July 12 request by France's media watchdog, the CSA, to block broadcasts of Al-Manar TV through the Paris-based satellite operator Eutelsat. CSA was moved to action last December when CRIF, an umbrella group of French Jewish organizations, complained that Al-Manar had televised an anti-Semitic television series in France. The request comes at a time of increased tension between the governments of Israel and France, and what appears to be a rise in anti-Semitic attacks. Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon (news - web sites) recently claimed that France is engulfed in "the wildest anti-Semitism" and urging Jews to leave. Lebanon's Foreign Ministry defended Al-Manar on Friday, saying the station's programs "condemn the policies of Israeli governments and are not by any means racist or critical of the Jewish faith or people." -- Right...so let me get this straight. You hate Israel, but you don't HATE Jews? You are anti-Zionist, but not anti-Semetic? Somehow, I find this very UNconvincing. I think Al-Manar TV station is one the worst propaganda machines in the world. It's disgusting not only for it's content, as vile as it is, but for the sheer fact that the TV station is owned and operated by Hezbollah...a known terrorist organization. It would be inconceivable for France, as vile as it is, to even let this kind of garbage into their borders. Andrew B.

 CAIRO, Egypt - Al-Qaida No. 2 Ayman al-Zawahri's uncle, who won a number of national medical awards, has died of a heart attack, Egypt's leading newspaper reported Friday. Dr. Mohammed al-Zawahri, a dermatologist who received the presidential Award in Medical Sciences and the Republic's First Class medal, died Thursday in the Mediterranean city of Alexandria, Al-Ahram reported. It did not give his age. The paper, which is close to the Egyptian government, did not mention the blood relationship between the doctor and Osama bin Laden (news - web sites)'s deputy and closest aide, Ayman al-Zawahri. However, Mahfouz Azzam, another uncle of al-Zawahri, told The Associated Press that Mohammed al-Zawahri was considered the "chief" of (Ayman) al-Zawahri's family. - ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ.....as if I give 2 shits.....ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ Andrew B.

 By ADNAN MALIK, Associated Press Writer MANAMA, Bahrain - More than 2,500 people marched along a major highway in Bahrain on Friday, many shouting "Death to America" and "Death to Israel" in an angry but peaceful demonstration against fighting in the Iraqi holy city of Najaf. Protests also took place in Lebanon and Iran, where a crowd in Tehran set fire to American flags and an effigy of President Bush (news - web sites). In Manama, the late afternoon march brought traffic to a halt on one side of the highway leading to the capital's commercial center. -- Peaceful eh? "Death to America" and "Death to Israel" aren't peaceful in my opinion...maybe I am alittle off base, but when someone is chanting for my DEATH...I think that qualifies as HATE SPEECH. Not to mention the whole burning effigies thing of Presidents is very "PEACEFUL" and "CIVIL"...lovely people. Andrew B.

 By TODD PITMAN, Associated Press Writer NAJAF, Iraq - The platoon leader's call came crackling over Charlie Company radios: "We're taking RPG fire, 800 meters! Small arms fire, 300 meters!" With night falling, the soldiers of the 1st Calvary Division were being attacked again by militants creeping tombstone by tombstone toward them in Najaf's sprawling cemetery, a killing field neither side has managed to secure in more than a week of sporadic fighting. "You have to give them credit," Sgt. 1st Class Mike Dewilde said after a brief firefight with insurgents Thursday in a cemetery zone the military has code-named the Bronx. "They do an amazing amount with what little they have." The men of the 1st Battalion, 5th Cavalry Regiment had been patrolling a dusty road that cuts into the graveyard's heart for eight hours to prevent militants loyal to firebrand cleric Muqtada al-Sadr from moving north. -- Hey at least we won't have to look far to bury these freaks...they are in a cemetary already... Andrew B.

 By MARK LAVIE, Associated Press Writer TEL AVIV, Israel - The Israeli military is using a high-flying, high-tech balloon to spot Palestinian rocket launchers in Gaza, an army publication reported. The balloon has been flying several hundred yards over the main army command post just outside the Gaza Strip (news - web sites) for the past month, according to the current edition of "Bamahane." The balloon is equipped with sophisticated cameras and transmitters and it relays pictures of a wide area back to the base. The soldiers' weekly said each balloon system, developed by the Israeli military research company, costs about $2 million. -- This is how you win the war on terror...well at least part of it. You can't let the enemey sleep. You have to keep at them 24/7. Never give in! Andrew B.

 By ALI AKBAR DAREINI, Associated Press Writer TEHRAN, Iran - Security forces have detained an American man for illegally entering Iran from Pakistan, state television reported Friday. An Iranian police officer confirmed to The Associated Press the Tuesday arrest of the unidentified American, saying his motives for crossing the border had not been determined. The American was being interrogated, the officer said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Iran has tightened security on its eastern border with Pakistan and Afghanistan (news - web sites) to prevent infiltration by supporters of the al-Qaida terror group and the former Taliban regime in Afghanistan. -- What was an American doing in Pakistan??? This is indeed a strange story... Andrew B.

 NAJAF, Iraq (AFP) - Shiite Muslim rebel leader Moqtada Sadr issued a list of conditions for an end to more than a week of deadly clashes between his militia and US troops and Iraqi forces, a spokesmen said. The conditions were spelled out at a news conference at a hotel in the besieged holy city of Najaf by Sheikh Ali Sumeisim. If all multinational forces, Iraqi police and soldiers leave Najaf and the Marjayia, or religious authority, agrees to take responsibility for the city, "the Mehdi Army would pull out from Najaf," Sumeisim said. All basic services must be restored, Sadr's Mehdi Army recognised as an ideological movement and its members allowed to carry weapons for self-defence, Sumeisim continued. Those jailed for supporting the resistance, all imprisoned clerics and women must also be released from prison, the spokesman added. -- This guy has some serious BALLS. I say screw the truce...kill him and his "followers". Andrew B.

 The reporting of Israeli Mossad infiltration in southern Kurdistan provides a microcosm of the problem Kurds face in perception in the world -- as judged by the reaction to the news by the Israeli and Kurdish governments, the enemy states surrounding Kurdistan and global opinion. The veteran American journalist Seymour Hirsch brought this information to light with the same aims he had upon his unearthing of the scandal at the infamous Abu Ghreib prison. News of Kurdish "collaboration" with the Israeli Mossad was meant to be a revelation of how the Bush adventure in the region was spiraling into instability, news that is pleasing to the ears of progressive Europe and the liberal elite in America. The Turkish foreign ministry leaked the "secret" to Seymour Hirsch with at least two aims in mind: to embarrass the Israeli government, as relations between Israel and Turkey are going through a rough period; and to deceive the Americans into thinking how once more the interests of the Turks are ignored in Kurdistan. While the reaction of the enemies of Kurdistan and the progressive global opinion is understandable, the purpose of the vehement denials of the existence of a relationship between Israel and Kurdistan by their own leaders is not clear. This attitude is detrimental to both Israel and Kurdistan. The Israeli and Kurdish people have a great deal in common, from their determination to live in freedom, to having a mostly common enemy. These are good reasons for Israel to ally itself with Kurdistan. For Israel, a strong Kurdistan will be a major buffer against the Arab and Islamic world. For Kurdistan, a strong alliance with Israel should bring much needed military strength and critical access to the seat of power in Washington. -- There is more at the website. I have to tell you...this guy is right on the money. He really understands what is going on in the Middle East. An alliance with a Kurdish state would be HUGE for Israel...yet at the same would be one of the worst things for Israel...in relation to Turkey. Turkey is one of the strangest allies anyone can have. We all need them because of the location (on the cusp of Europe and Middle East) and it really is the only "moderate" Muslim leadership in the Middle East.

 Contrary to most demographic predictions regarding the population statistics of Israel, a revolution of sorts is underway in the Jewish Israeli birthrate. Contrary to most demographic predictions regarding the population statistics of Israel, a revolution of sorts is underway in the Jewish Israeli birthrate. According to a Health Ministry report, the Jewish Israeli birthrate is on the rise, while the Arab Israeli birthrate remains unchanged. In Israel of 2003, 144,625 babies were born, representing an increase of 3.4% over 2002. A breakdown of the statistics reveals that the Jewish population saw an increase of 4.8% and the Arab population saw no change. In addition, the Health Ministry reported, there was a notable decline in infant mortality in 2003. During the year, 718 newborns died, representing 4.96 deaths per every thousand live births. In 2002, the statistic was 5.5 per every thousand. Infant mortality among Arabs is double that among Jews. The most common cause of infant mortality for all populations is premature birth. -- This is great news for Israel. I hope every Israeli woman has 7 or 8 kids. If there are no kids there is no future and no Israel. Andrew B.

 By JOHN J. LUMPKIN, Associated Press Writer PARTENIT, Ukraine - Ukraine's defense minister said Friday his country will maintain its sizable military force in Iraq (news - web sites) for the foreseeable future, contrary to his earlier suggestion that the force might be reduced or withdrawn. Defense Minister Yevhen Marchuk said the force would stay close to its current level of 1,600 soldiers. His comments came in a news conference with Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld in this resort town on the coast of the Black Sea. Ukraine's troops constitute the fourth largest contingent of allied soldiers aiding the large U.S. force in reconstruction and security efforts in Iraq. They are primarily involved in training Iraqi security forces. Rumsfeld, after meeting with Marchuk and Ukraine President Leonid Kuchma, praised the former Soviet republic for its support in Iraq. Kuchma's office issued a statement after the meeting saying Ukraine "remains on the path of Euro-Atlantic integration," despite his recent move to back away from assertions that Ukraine is striving for full membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the European Union (news - web sites). -- Don't you just love how the AP the other day was all over a POSSIBLE WITHDRAWAL of Ukraine troops in the DISTANT future. Of course countries are going to pull their troops out EVENTUALLY....DUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH...The AP would like to have you believe the pullout was going to be next week or something that crazy. Their bias never ceases to amaze me. Incredible.

 JERUSALEM - A Palestinian gunman killed an Israeli security guard near a Jewish West Bank settlement Friday before being slain himself, the army said. The guard was driving near the entrance to the settlement of Itamar when he was ambushed, the army said. He died on the way to a hospital. A dog traveling with the guard was also killed. -- Why does the AP insist to use the word..."gunman" or "militant"...how about TERRORIST? I think that is more succinct. Andrew B. Update: This is the man who was murdered by a wild "Palestinian" animal...disgusting. Update: The attacker was identified as a member of the Tanzim, an offshoot of Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement. Palestinian sources told Israel Radio that Yusuf Hanani, 25, was also an officer in the Palestinian Preventive Security Service. Hanani lived in the West Bank village of Beit Furik, near Nablus, from where some 30 Palestinians have carried out shooting attacks and suicide bombings since the start of the intifada.

 BASRA, Iraq - Gunmen abducted a British journalist from his hotel in the southern city of Basra after shooting him twice in the leg, officials said Friday. About 30 gunmen, including some dressed as police, stormed the Diyafah Hotel in Basra on Thursday, Capt. Hashem Abdullah said. Hotel staff showed a check-in form purportedly filled out by the man, identifying himself as James Brandon, 23, working for the Sunday Telegraph. It said he checked in on Wednesday. Hotel owner Mohammed Uglah said gunmen found Brandon and shot at him after he tried to escape, hitting him across the head before taking him away. -- Typical barbaric radical at work. We all hope the journalist is ok and is doing well. How can you negotiate with terrorists like this. There is nothing you can do to appease them...the only thing that we can do is either convert to their vision of Islam or just commit suicide. Their jihad will never end untill we cease to exist...just like our war against them (the radicals) are completely destroyed. Andrew B.

 NAJAF, Iraq - Radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr was hit by shrapnel in his chest and a leg Friday as he met with members of his militia during clashes between U.S. and Iraqi forces in Najaf, his aides said. A spokesman described his condition as stable. Al-Sadr has led an uprising against coalition troops for more than a week in the holy city, vowing to fight "until the last drop of my blood has been spilled." -- I hope he's dead or dies really soon. What a waste of space that jerk is... Andrew B.

 JERUSALEM - Israel can defend its northern border even if it gives up the strategic Golan Heights in a peace deal with Syria, Israel's army chief said in an interview published Friday. Israel has long argued that giving up the plateau, captured from Syria in 1967, would leave northern Israel vulnerable to Syrian attack. "If you ask me, theoretically, if we can reach an agreement with Syria ... my answer is that from a military standpoint it is possible to reach an agreement by giving up the Golan Heights," Lt. Gen. Moshe Yaalon said in the interview with the daily Yediot Aharonot. "The army is able to defend any border. This is correct for any political decision that is taken in Israel," he said. The last round of Israeli-Syrian peace talks collapsed in 2000, when then-Syrian President Hafez Assad rejected an offer of an Israeli withdrawal from virtually all of the Golan, with minor border adjustments near Israel's Sea of Galilee at the foot of the plateau. The Syrians insist that Israel pull back to the frontier that ran between the two countries on the eve of the 1967 Mideast war. Last year Syria made overtures indicating it wanted to resume talks. However, Israel says Syria must first end its support for Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon and Palestinian radicals it hosts in Syria itself. -- What a bad move that would be...Giving up the Golan would be aweful because of the strategic value of this location. If Israel gave it back to Syria...Syria could use it to launch new attacks against Israel. We know this because this is where they launched attacks years ago when Golan was part of Syria. Israel can't let this happen. Andrew B.

 Great article by Clifford D. May. Terrorists bombed two hotels in Istanbul this week. Neither happened to be the hotel in which I was staying. Still, considering that last November al Qaeda-linked terrorists bombed the British consulate, a bank and two synagogues killing more than 60 people, a little nervousness would not have been inappropriate. Indeed, the night before the bombings I dined at a rooftop restaurant high above the Bosphorus, the waterway that divides Europe from Asia. Suddenly, a series of deafeningly loud explosions erupted. My dining companion leapt from his seat. I remained calm � not because I'm unfazed by the possibility of getting caught in a terrorist attack, but rather because from where I was sitting I could see what he couldn't: the colorful fireworks that had been set off at a wedding party in the garden below. These days many signals that are difficult to interpret are coming from Turkey. For centuries, this land was the heart of the vast and powerful Ottoman Empire. But when that realm shattered in World War I, Mustapha Kemal -- the urbane general who had defeated the Allies at Gallipoli -- founded a modern, European-style nation, determinedly democratic and secular. -- Please read the rest..Mr. May makes some great observations about Turkey and how it plays an important role in the 'War on Terror'.

 The victims of terrorism directed against Jews worldwide will be commemorated by the State of Israel at a Mt. Herzl site, alongside to the central memorial for Israel's civilian terrorist victims. This recommendation was made by the Ministerial Committee for Ceremonies and Symbols, chaired by Minister Danny Naveh and the Committee for Diaspora Affairs chaired by Minister Natan Sharansky. The decision was made this morning at a joint meeting of the two committees, following the initiative of JAFI Chair Sallai Meridor. According to the proposal, the memorial for those killed in terrorist activity in Israel, situated on Mt. Herzl, will be extended to include a site for the victims of terror directed against Jewish targets in the Diaspora. Natan Sharansky, Minister for Jerusalem, social and Diaspora Affairs, will head a committee to work with all the relevant parties, including the National Association for the Victims of Arab Terror, in erecting the memorial site. The committee will design the site, including the architectural design and coordinate funding to finance and maintain the site. It will also outline the format of the ceremony to commemorate the victims, in conjunction with the Jewish Agency, a representative of the Minister of Social Welfare and Diaspora Jewish organizations. "A memorial for the victims of terrorist acts directed against Jews all over the world reflects the centrality of Israel and the country's overall responsibility for all Jews, as well as the shared fate of the State of Israel and the Jewish people", said JAFI Chair, Sallai Meridor at the committee meeting. -- It's about time...someone constructed something like this. If we do not remember the past...we are doomed to repeat it. This is something we (Jews) cannot wait for. We will defend our existence...forever. Andrew B.

 By TAMER ZIARA, Associated Press Writer RAFAH, Gaza Strip - Dozens of homeless Palestinians led by gunmen occupied a government office in this Gaza refugee camp Thursday, forcing officials to leave and lashing out at the Palestinian Authority (news - web sites). The demonstration came just after Israeli troops raided the camp, destroying buildings as they searched for arms-smuggling tunnels and weapons. The four-hour standoff, which ended after Yasser Arafat (news - web sites) intervened, was the latest blow to the Palestinian leader's prestige and part of the growing chaos in Gaza ahead of Israel's planned withdrawal from the territory next year. -- Prestige??? Since when did Arafat have "Prestige"? Knowing him and his "antics" of terror...he probably incited this violence. Why should this come as a shock to anyone? Andrew B.

 By MARIAM FAM, Associated Press Writer BAGHDAD, Iraq - Iraqi Shiites expressed anger Thursday at a major U.S.-led assault on a rebel militia in the holy city of Najaf, warning the violence could spread to other parts of the country and damage the political process. Fighters loyal to rebel cleric Muqtada al-Sadr have been holed up in and around the Imam Ali shrine, which holds the remains of Ali, the most exalted Shia saint and the son-in-law and cousin of Islam's prophet Muhammad. Damage to the shrine could anger Shiites and Muslims worldwide. "This will lead to revenge for the holy sites and for those killed," said Salama al-Khafaji, a former member of the disbanded Governing Council. -- You can't have it both ways. Either it is a holy site and no soldiers are allowed in which I support...but at the same time you can't have these terrorists staging their attacks from a Holy Shrine. That's a bunch of BS. If these terrorists use a mosque as a vantage point...I say it's free game. Knock it down if they are abusing the rights of the mosque. You can always rebuild a mosque...you can't rebuild people. How many churches and synagogues were destroyed during the rise of Islam in the 7th Century? Where was the outrage from Muslims then? This is a different war. This has NOTHING to do with ISLAM in general. This does have to do with RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS that threaten the free world and civilization. Andrew B.

 By JOHN P. McALPIN, Associated Press Writer TRENTON, N.J. - In a stunning declaration, Gov. James E. McGreevey announced his resignation Thursday and acknowledged that he had an extramarital affair with another man. "My truth is that I am a gay American," he said with his wife by his side at a nationally televised news conference. "Shamefully, I engaged in adult consensual affairs with another man, which violates my bonds of matrimony," the twice-married father of two said. "It was wrong, it was foolish, it was inexcusable." McGreevey, a 47-year-old Democrat, refused to answer questions at the Statehouse news conference. He said that "it makes little difference that as governor I am gay," but added that staying in office and keeping the affair and his sexual orientation secret will leave the governor's office "vulnerable to rumors, false allegations and threats of disclosure." -- I can careless if he is gay...what makes me mad is the fact that he was having an affair with this Israeli guy and after the guy was fired he was given 100,000 a year as hush money...(I live in NJ...that's my money going to this guy) I am not happy about this at all. On the boob-tube tonight...the Republicans are jumping on this BIG TIME, which they should... Doug Forrester (R) and Bret Schundler (R) are gearing up to wedge themselves into that Governor's Seat. We will see how all this plays out. People in this state are freaked out. We all knew he was gay, but this was over the top. From what I hear and read there is a bunch of stuff to be coming out really soon about his personal life. The people I really feel bad is his wife and kids. They have to live with this shame. (Not the shame of having a gay father...but the scandal of a powerful Governor falling FAST from grace. Andrew B.

 PATRAS, Greece - In its first Olympic competition since its country was shattered by war, Iraq upset star-studded Portugal 4-2 on Thursday in a gritty, come-from-behind victory as about 200 chanting fans cheered and jumped wildly. “This victory will be received with happiness by my people, who have suffered through much,” said Iraqi coach Adnan Hamad, whose countrymen were already taking to the streets of back in Baghdad, lighting up the night sky with streaks of celebratory gunfire. The stunning victory over a team that made it to final of the recent Euro 2004 tournament brought a rare moment of joy for residents of a country plagued by violence, chaos and constant power outages during the hot summer. -- This is great moral for the people of Iraq. I am happy that they can experience joy for once. This will be an incredible Olympics in Greece for the world. Andrew B.

 It’s still tense here in Baghdad and everyone is talking about the expected major operations in Najaf. There are different opinions on who’s responsible of what happened but the majority clearly confirm the responsibility of the militias, and even those who hold the Americans responsible for the latest violence believe so because they think that the Americans together with the Iraqi government gave those gangs the freedom to act like this when they should’ve dealt with them firmly from the beginning. I was talking about this with some of my friends and I was trying hard to explain that the government was patient to show that force is not the only nor the 1st choice to confront problems but it will be the last choice and after exhausting all other possible solutions. All this to show that Iraq’s policy will be entirely different from that of the dictatorships that ruled in the past. A policy that seeks what’s best for the people rather than the government’s will or desire, to avoid any possible losses among people. However the truth has to be said and as one of my friends said, “what you say is true but the militias in question were the ones who raised arms and that was 1st choice, and here responding with force will be a self defense rather than a choice made in haste”. -- Great work from Iraq the Model...keeping us updated with what is going on in Baghdad and other areas. Andrew B.



 BAKU, Azerbaijan - U.S. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld thanked Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliev on Thursday for his country's support in the war on terrorism. Rumsfeld spoke with Aliev on a trip to visit U.S. allies in the region. Defense Minister Gen. Col. Safar Abiyev assured Rumsfeld that his country is committed to keeping 150 soldiers in Iraq. Azerbaijan is the only predominately Muslim country that has contributed troops to the multinational coalition assisting the emerging forces of the Iraqi interim government. Azerbaijan, which also has 22 troops in Afghanstian, is seeking U.S. support in mondernizing its military and resolving a territorial dispute with neighboring Armenia. The United States, meanwhile, is appealing to Caspian Sea countries like Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan as foils to Iran, which also borders on the oil-rich sea. -- True Allies stick together in the face of adversity.

 By Emma Ross-Thomas and Blanca Rodriguez MADRID (Reuters) - Explosions hit two Spanish coastal cities Thursday after a newspaper received a warning call in the name of armed Basque separatist group ETA, and at least one person was injured, officials said. Santander and Gijon, some 130 km (80 miles) apart on Spain's northern coast, are packed with holidaymakers at this time of year and the explosions appeared to fit into ETA's strategy of seeking to undermine Spain's key tourism industry. A small bomb exploded in one of Santander's busiest streets, close to a major office of Spain's biggest bank, Santander Central Hispano (SCH), and near regional government offices. The bomb caused no injuries and only minor damage, officials said. Almost simultaneously, another explosion occurred near a restaurant in Gijon, officials and news reports said. It was not immediately confirmed that it was a bomb, but a police spokesman said one person had been injured. The Santander bomb had been left in a bag, according to the web site of newspaper El Pais. -- Welcome to the 21st Century Spain... Andrew B.

 By TODD PITMAN, Associated Press Writer NAJAF, Iraq - U.S. forces stormed a Najaf house belonging to a radical Shiite cleric, who has led a deadly uprising against coalition and Iraqi troops for more than a week, as American and Iraqi soldiers launched a major assault Thursday on his militiamen. Explosions and gunfire echoed near the revered Imam Ali shrine and its vast cemetery. Residents saw U.S. forces break into Muqtada al-Sadr's house without meeting any resistance. Al-Sadr, who has vowed to fight "until the last drop of my blood has been spilled," was not there at the time. It was not immediately known where he went, but residents reported clashes between Iraqi police and members of his Mahdi Army militia near the house Wednesday, which may have prompted most residents to leave the area. -- Knock down the whole freaking house and kill the guy already. Andrew B.

 By TAMER ZIARA, Associated Press Writer RAFAH, Gaza Strip - Dozens of Palestinians, some of them armed, occupied the local government offices in a Gaza refugee camp for several hours Thursday, demanding assistance after a series of home demolitions by the Israeli army. The four-hour seizure, which ended with no injuries after intervention by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, was the latest sign of growing lawlessness in the Gaza Strip ahead of Israel's planned withdrawal from the area next year. Palestinian security forces, severely weakened by four years of conflict with Israel, have been vying for power ahead of the withdrawal. Taking advantage of the power vacuum, violent gangs roam freely, and militants accuse local officials of corruption and ineffectiveness. The office takeover came a day after Palestinian militants exploded a bomb at a West Bank checkpoint. The attack, aimed at Israeli troops, killed two Palestinian bystanders and wounded 16 people, including six Israeli guards. -- What do these animals think they are accomplishing by taking over these buildings and kidnapping people. I am not getting it. How could this possibly work in their favor? Andrew B.

 By OMAR SINAN, Associated Press Writer BAGHDAD, Iraq - Iraqi Prime Minister Ayad Allawi called Thursday on the Shiite militants fighting U.S. and Iraqi forces in the holy city of Najaf to put down their weapons and leave the Imam Ali shrine where they have sought refuge. Allawi's appeal, made in a statement read by Iraqi officials, came as U.S. and Iraqi forces began a major operation in Najaf intended to defeat the militants. The militants have been holed up in the shrine, one of the holiest sites in Shia Islam, during the fighting and the U.S. military accused them of launching attacks from the shrine compound. "These places have never been exposed to such violations in the past," he said, adding that the violence has killed many innocent people. "Our government calls upon all the armed groups to drop their weapons and return to society," Allawi said. "We also call upon all the armed men to evacuate the holy shrine and not to violate its holiness." -- Don't call, don't ask...DEMAND! Get them the hell out of there. Andrew B.

 By Nima Elbagir KHARTOUM (Reuters) - President Omar Hassan al-Bashir on Thursday accused Western nations of interfering in Sudan's troubled western Darfur region to try to exploit the country's gold and oil resources. Sudan is under intense international pressure to rein in Arab militias, accused of looting and burning African villages, and provide security for more than 1 million people displaced by the fighting in the remote area bordering Chad. If not, the U.N. Security Council in a July 30 resolution says Khartoum could face unspecified sanctions. There has also been talk of possible foreign troop intervention in Darfur. Bashir on Thursday said Western nations, especially Britain, were inflaming the Darfur fighting to destabilize wider Sudan. "There is an agenda to seek for petrol and gold in the region," he told a women's union meeting on Darfur in Khartoum on Thursday. -- Insanity has a new name and it is The Sudan. This has to be one of the dumbest excuses for genocide I have ever heard. This is typical behavior of a spoiled person who got caught doing something they shouldn't have...they blame it on other people. It's never their fault. Andrew B.

 "The wave of North American Aliyah has become a reality - and it's about time," co-founder Rabbi Yehoshua Fass told the crowd of new olim, reciting the words of the blessing thanking God for bringing us momentous occasions. "To all of you, our dear olim, we applaud you for your Aliyah, but we laud you for becoming leaders - leaders in your families, leaders in your communities, leaders in your federations and synagogues, for raising Aliyah-by-choice to the surface, preaching it to all your friends and family and paving the way for them to follow. I want to bless you all that, [as it says in Psalm 126,] your lives, your reality here in Israel surpass your dreams..." -- Imagine being greeted like this when you move to another country? I really don't think so...ONLY in Israel. Andrew B.

 “The four Jewish towns in northern Samaria which the government will be dismantled as part of the disengagement plan are not going to be the only ones,” Olmert said. Olmert made the comments while touring the separation fence in the area near Modiin. He assured reporters that despite the fierce opposition to the Prime Ministers disengagement plan, the withdrawals from Gaza and parts of the northern Samaria would indeed take place – and be but a prelude of things to come. The Deputy Prime Ministers words are sure to rattle some supporters of the disengagement plan who believed previous claims that a withdrawal from Gaza would strengthen Israel’s diplomatic position, ensuring that Jews could remain in Judea and Samaria. -- Empty out the settlements and let the "Palestinians" figure out how to live without law and order.

 (Hat tip: newscaper) NAJAF, Iraq (Reuters) - U.S. marines, backed by aircraft, launched a major offensive to crush a week-long rebellion by Shi'ite militia dug in around holy sites in the Iraqi city of Najaf on Thursday. Thousands of civilians were fleeing the area around Imam Ali Shrine in the heart of the city, witnesses said. A message in Arabic read out from Humvees said: "To the residents of Najaf: Coalition forces are purging the city of Mehdi Army." U.S. tanks were blocking all roads leading to the shrine, one of Shi'ite Islam's holiest sites, as U.S. aircraft and artillery pounded a nearby cemetery, a stronghold for the militiamen loyal to radical cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. The fresh fighting comes after seven days of efforts by U.S. and Iraqi government forces to root out Sadr's troops. A threat by Sadr's militia kept a main southern oil export pipeline shut on Thursday although crews had repaired it after sabotage stopped operations for three days, an oil official said. A senior official from Sadr's Mehdi Army, Sheikh Asaad al-Basri, had warned that militiamen would blow up pipelines in the south if U.S. forces tried to storm their Najaf bases. -- Let's roll!

 (Hat tip: zulubaby) Charging that Israel's housing demolition policy violates international law, the European Commission allocated €1.35 million on Wednesday to Palestinians whose homes were destroyed by the IDF in the Gaza Strip's Rafah area in May and June. The European Commission also gave a €1 million grant in March to help those Palestinians who lost their homes through IDF demolition activities in the Gaza Strip. "House demolitions are disproportionate acts that contravene international humanitarian law, in particular, the Fourth Geneva Convention, and show a reckless disregard for the lives of civilians," said Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid, Poul Nelson. "These funds do not absolve the occupying power of its responsibilities to uphold international humanitarian law." -- You've got to be kidding me...say it isn't so...(yeah it is...BARFFFFFF) Andrew B.

There is so much compelling information here that it would even make Tom Friedman and Robert Fisk blush. I highly suggest that you all visit the website and check it out. *Note: Take a look at the quality of the tunnels and then think to yourself..."how can these imoverished people have the technology to dig such an advanced tunnel for weapons smuggling?"

 (Hat tip: Teri) August 10, 2004 -- AS the American presidential election campaign moves into top gear, what looks like a double misunderstanding is taking shape on the two shores of the Atlantic. Some on the American side, notably Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry, seem to believe that a change of administration would suffice to heal the wounds of last year's diplomatic duels over Iraq. In fact, Kerry appears to have based his Iraq policy, which remains a mystery, on the assumption that it would win instant and practical support from countries such as France, Germany and Russia. The misunderstanding is even deeper on the European side. "With the Bush administration, nothing is possible," says a senior French diplomat. "Kerry, however, has shown that he lives in the real world." -- Europe and Kerry have one thing in common...they are both out of touch with reality. Andrew B.

 (Credit to: zulubaby) Security officials said that more that 90 attempts to carry out suicide bombings inside the 'Green Line' and against Israelis targets in the Palestinian territories have been thwarted since the beginning of the year, Israel Radio reported. The officials added that all Palestinian terror groups have increased cooperation and joint operations. Iran's involvement in Palestinian terrorism, whether directly or through the Hizbullah, is also increasing, the officials said. The officials added that there have been some, but very few, cases of terrorist attacks that have been thwarted by Palestinian security forces. The nerve center of Palestinian terrorism remains Nablus, the officials added. According to the report on Israel Radio, over 2 tons of explosive material, bullets, mortars and other weaponry has been smuggled into Palestinian territories through Egypt. -- Interesting...yet the world would rather Jewish children to be blown up by animals from the other side. Whatever...The important thing here is that Jewish people are safer because of the wall, fence, ditch, etc...it is obviously WORKING. It is working so well...that these freaks have resorted to cowardly firing shabby missles into Israel, usually hitting nothing. Pathetic. Andrew B.

 JERUSALEM (AFP) - Israeli Jews overwhelmingly want President George W. Bush (news - web sites) to beat his Democrat challenger John Kerry (news - web sites) in the US presidential election on November 2, according to an opinion poll. A total of 49 percent of people questioned said they preferred Bush, with just 18 percent wanting Kerry to win. Seven percent believed the two candidates were equally good for Israel, while two percent said they were equally bad for the Jewish state. The rest offered no opinion. -- No comment needed here...the poll speaks VOLUMES by itself. Andrew B.

 By OMAR SINAN, Associated Press Writer BAGHDAD, Iraq - Ahmad Chalabi, a former Iraqi Governing Council member who fell out of favor with the United States, has returned to Iraq to face counterfeiting charges, an official in his political party said Wednesday. Arrest warrants for Chalabi and his nephew were issued Saturday by Iraq's Central Criminal Court. The nephew, Salem Chalabi, is wanted for murder. Ahmad Chalabi, who was in Iran when the warrants were announced, had said he would return to Iraq to clear his name. He arrived in Baghdad on Wednesday afternoon, said Mithal al-Alusi, of Chalabi's Iraqi National Congress group. "He is back among his people and trying to get some rest before returning to his political duties, trying to help the government and stop the violence," al-Alusi said. -- I think he has some explaining to do to A LOT OF PEOPLE...especially...ME!!!

 U.S. intelligence officials say a high-profile political assassination, triggered by the public release of a new message from Osama bin Laden, will lead off the next major al Qaeda terrorist attack, The Washington Times has learned. The assassination plan is among new details of al Qaeda plots disclosed by U.S. officials familiar with intelligence reports who, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the killing could be carried out against a U.S. or foreign leader either in the United States or abroad. The officials mentioned Saudi Arabia and Yemen, two nations that are working with the United States in the battle against al Qaeda, as likely locales for the opening assassination. The planning for the attacks to follow involves "multiple targets in multiple venues" across the United States, one official said. The new details of al Qaeda's plans were found on a laptop computer belonging to arrested al Qaeda operative Muhammad Naeem Noor Khan of Pakistan. "We're talking about planning at the screwdriver level," one official said. "It is very detailed." -- I wonder who they are going to after...hmmm....take a wild guess. Duhhhhhh... Andrew B.

 By Chris Simcox ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Two groups of Middle-Eastern invaders were caught in Cochise County in the past six weeks. Information officer Andy Adame, from the Border Patrol Tucson sector says, “I guarantee it’s not true.” However, seasoned Border Patrol field agents have shared some disturbing information with the Tumbleweed as well as other civilian sources with the hope the information will make it to the general public. The Tumbleweed has verified information that a flood of middle-eastern males have been caught entering the country illegally east of Douglas, Arizona. The increased patrols in the Huachuca Mountains area of Cochise County, seems to have diverted the flow of OTM’s, “other than Mexicans” east to the Chiricahua Mountains. Adame, who says many of the agents in the area are “green”, questions why they would have shared the information with the Tumbleweed or any other source. “Our policy is to turn any OTM’s over to the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security,” Adame said in a phone call made to the Tumbleweed Wednesday morning. For reasons of National security, Adame said his agency cannot talk about the origin of nationaity, however Adame says that since October 1, 2003, the beginning of the fiscal year for Border Patrol, agents in the Tucson sector have apprehended 5,510 illegals from countries other than Mexico or other central or South American countries. Adame described them as “people from all over the world”. -- CLOSE THE FUCKING BORDERS ALREADY!!! For crying out loud!!! Andrew B.

 Michael Freund, The Jerusalem Post Wen-Jing smiles upon hearing the Court's decisionFor the first time, a descendant of the once-vibrant Jewish community of Kaifeng, China, has undergone conversion in Israel and formally returned to Judaism. This past Sunday, Jin Wen-Jing, an 18-year-old student at the Yemin Orde youth village, went before a Haifa conversion court under the auspices of the Chief Rabbinate. After administering an oral examination aimed at assessing her commitment to Judaism as well as her knowledge of Jewish law and tradition, the three rabbis comprising the Beit Din informed Wen-Jing that they had decided to accept her as a Jew. Speaking in fluent Hebrew, Wen-Jing was quick to express her joy, and relief, at the court's decision. "I was very nervous, but now I am very happy," she said. "This has always been my family's dream – to return to our roots." Wen-Jing arrived in Israel four years ago with her parents. Her father, Jin Guang-Yuan, who now goes by the name Shlomo, is a direct descendant of the Jewish community that existed for nearly a thousand years in the city of Kaifeng, which lies north of Beijing, on the south bank of the Yellow River. At its peak, during the Ming Dynasty, Kaifeng Jewry numbered about 5,000 people. But widespread intermarriage and assimilation, as well as the death of the community's last rabbi, brought about its demise by the middle of the 19th century. Scholars say there are still hundreds of people in Kaifeng who cling to their identity as descendants of the town's Jewish community. Wen-Jing's father still carries with him a copy of his internal Chinese identification card, which lists his nationality as "Youtai," or Jew. He and his wife hope to follow in their daughter's footsteps and undergo conversion soon. -- WOW! This is incredible. When I read this I got all teary-eyed...this is really a special story that I really wanted to share with all of you. Andrew B.

 Pharoz Rajifar (sp?) president of the Iranian organization that " Defends values of Islam" said that 15 thousands Iranian have volunteered to commit suicidal attacks in Iraq. Hamshri newspaper that's published in Iran reported that Mr. Rajifar mentioned that all the volunteers are ready to "defend Islam" in southern Iraq or any other place that might need their services. The registration process started in last June following the clashes between the coalition forces in Iraq and Sadr's militia in Najaf and the latest clashes have "provoked more people to volunteer". The Iranian government said that this initiative has nothing to do with the government and refused the accusations of interfering in Iraq's internal affairs saying that the Iraqi officials need to prove these accusations or remain silent.

 By Ron Strom © 2004 WorldNetDaily.com Has leftist Hollywood met its match? The organizers of a pro-America film festival believe it has, going on the offensive to present and promote conservative movies and documentaries in Dallas next month. The American Film Renaissance hopes its festival will be the opening salvo in a battle to get more patriotic and traditional-values oriented movies produced and seen by the film-going public in the U.S. Using a war analogy, festival president and cofounder Jim Hubbard explains his vision: "Conservatives have been on defense in this culture war going on 40 years," he told WorldNetDaily. "No war has ever been won playing defense. � My notion is that we should go to the offense. That's the only way you can win any struggle." -- Finally...a breathe of fresh air in the midst of hot and stale crap from Hollywood. Andrew B.

 By PAUL HAVEN, Associated Press Writer ISLAMABAD, Pakistan - If Osama bin Laden (news - web sites) is directing plans for an attack on the United States — as Washington intelligence officials suspect — his instructions are likely coming out of the craggy mountains between Afghanistan (news - web sites) and Pakistan on the back of a donkey or under the shawl of an unassuming-looking villager. After the arrests of several top lieutenants, bin Laden and his right hand man, Egyptian Ayman al-Zawahri, have learned their lessons well, Pakistani intelligence officials and international terrorism experts say. They don't use satellite or cellular phones, don't trust anyone outside their innermost circle and never come up for air. Messages from the men likely pass through the hands of many couriers, most of whom have no idea where they originated, before they are turned into e-mails or conveyed by phone calls to other militants. -- Drop a bunch of JDAMs in there...that should wake them up a bit. What we really need is better intelligence. Action or inaction is defined by the quality of intelligence obtained. Andrew B.

 LONDON (AFP) - Britain's government received a boost for its controversial policy of detaining foreign terrorism suspects without trial, when a court rejected an attempt by 10 detainees to win freedom. The High Court in London turned down an appeal by lawyers acting for the 10 men against a ruling that Home Secretary David Blunkett had acted properly in deciding they were a risk to national security, and thus should be detained. The ruling was made by the Special Immigration Appeals Commission, or SIAC, a secretive legal tribunal which decides on the status of foreign nationals facing detention or deportation on the grounds of national security. The men's lawyers had argued it was wrong to hold them under evidence which might have been gathered using torture or ill-treatment at US detention centres such as Guantanamo Bay in Cuba or Bagram airbase in Afghanistan (news - web sites). -- Finally, some sanity in a court system. Honestly...who really wants these FREAKS out? Andrew B.

 TRIPOLI (AFP) - Libya has rebuffed a US call for compensation to be paid to the families of American victims of Berlin nightclub bombing 18 years ago, claiming that Washington should instead recompense the Libyan victims of a subsequent revenge air raid on Tripoli. Germany and Libya reached agreement on Tuesday on compensating scores of people wounded in the deadly 1986 bombing Libya's ambassador, Said Abdulaati, told AFP that Tripoli had agreed to pay a total of 35 million dollars (28.4 million euros) to non-US nationals who were hurt. The bombing at the "La Belle" discotheque, which was frequented by US servicemen, in then West Berlin killed two GIs and a Turkish woman and wounded more than 250 people. -- Is anyone really shocked by this?

This guy cannot have it both ways...either be tried as a US citizen for treason or try him as a foreign terrorist and kill him already. By SONJA BARISIC, Associated Press Writer NORFOLK, Va. - A U.S. citizen captured on the Afghanistan battlefield might soon be allowed to walk free after three years in custody, bringing an end to one of the Bush administration's longest and hardest-fought legal battles to arise from the war on terrorism. Lawyers for the government and for Yaser Esam Hamdi informed a federal judge Wednesday they've been negotiating his release since the Supreme Court said enemy combatants could not be indefinitely detained without legal rights. In court papers filed jointly, the lawyers asked U.S. District Judge Robert G. Doumar to stay all proceedings in the case for 21 days so they can try to complete efforts to reach a mutually acceptable resolution. -- Walk free? I think not... Andrew B.

 -- I guess it is not a good time to be living in Turkey...Earthquakes, Train derailments, terrorists...etc... By JAMES C. HELICKE, Associated Press Writer TAVSANCIL, Turkey - A passenger train in northwest Turkey ignored a stop signal and rammed into an oncoming train Wednesday, killing six people and injuring 85, officials said, in the nation's third deadly rail accident in as many weeks. Rescue workers in blue and orange jumpsuits climbed through the wreckage near the village of Tavsancil in Kocaeli province, some 50 miles east of Istanbul, searching for more victims. They threw mangled pieces of metal out the shattered windows and used axes and torches to cut through the wreckage. Armed troops were guarding the site. By nightfall, rescue operations had largely ended and emergency crews were using flashlights to search inside the wreckage for any bodies.

 By Khaled Farhan NAJAF, Iraq (Reuters) - U.S. Marines Wednesday said they were preparing a final assault on militia in the Iraqi Shi'ite holy city of Najaf, but a militia leader warned they would retaliate by bombing vital oil pipelines in the south. The New York Times said that after preparing for a major attack on militia loyal to cleric Moqtada al-Sadr in Najaf Wednesday, U.S. forces called it off as it was about to begin. The radical cleric called on his men to keep fighting, even if he was killed. The Times said officers described the move as a postponement and said the attack could go ahead at any time. U.S. officers with knowledge of the plans could not be reached for comment.

 By ALI AKBAR DAREINI, Associated Press Writer TEHRAN, Iran - Iran is ready to "pay the price" for pursuing a peaceful nuclear program, even if that means being brought before the U.N. Security Council for possible sanctions, President Mohammad Khatami (news - web sites) said Wednesday. At the same time, Iran successfully test fired a new version of its ballistic Shahab-3 missile, which already was capable of reaching U.S. forces in the Middle East and since has been upgraded in response to Israeli missile development. The Shahab-3 can carry a nuclear warhead. -- Let's trust the Mad Mullahs on this one...Oh yeah. Andrew B.

 DUBAI (AFP) - An Islamist website showed a videotape which it said was of a US national and CIA (news - web sites) agent being beheaded by members of a Islamic militant group in Iraq (news - web sites). In the poor-quality video, whose authenticity could not be verified, a young Western-looking man is seated on a chair surrounded by five hooded gunmen, one of whom uses a long knife to cut through the man's neck and then brandishes the head. The same site (http://ansarnet.t35.com/dabh-cia.htm) shows a dozen photographs of the operation to kill the "CIA agent". During the four-minute video, an identity card is shown with the purported American's photograph and the mention "visitor". But the gunmen's words are unintelligible, apart from their cry of "Allah Akbar" (God is great) when the head is cut off. -- Hunt them down and destroy these freaks. This is so vile, so abhorent I really don't know where to begin with it. Andrew B.

 "It's Time For Bible Believing Americans To Arise and Vote!" This is the kick-off for a new campaign launched by the Global Israel Alliance along with Americans for a Safe Israel: a national referendum for American Christians to vote for or against a Palestinian state west of the Jordan River. The goal of the project is to receive up to one million votes, with the vast majority presumably voting against such a state. The organizers then plan to put all the ballots in an 18-wheel tractor-trailer and drive them to the White House, followed by tens of thousands of supporters, in advance of the presidential elections. The message to President Bush will be: "Your core group of 20 million voters will vote for you if you adopt a policy against a Palestinian state - but about a quarter of them will stay home and not vote at all if you ignore them on this issue." -- You think it was about time someone did this? Andrew B.

 Fuck You.

 Although few American journalists know how to report on it, a change is slowly developing in the American Muslim community. Terrorist atrocities, exemplified by the recent series of horrific, videotaped beheadings, have increased in Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and other countries, even as the U.S.-led campaign against Islamist extremism, both political and military, continues. The federal authorities, in the Report of the 9/11 Commission, finally summoned up the will to identify the enemy: not merely "terrorism," but radical Islamist ideology. Given these developments, non-Muslim Americans cannot help but feel heightened suspicion about the very nature of Islam. The situation has been dramatically worsened with news that two Islamic clerics in Albany, New York, Mohammed Hossain, 49, and Yassin Aref, 34, were arrested in an FBI sting operation while expressing support for a proposed assassination of the Pakistani ambassador to the United Nations -- a plot that, thank God, was fictitious. But the terror links of Albany's Yassin Aref appear anything but fictitious. Aref is allegedly associated with Ansar ul-Islam, a deadly, Saudi-financed terror conspiracy operating in Iraqi Kurdistan but with tentacles in many out-of-the-ordinary places. For example, Ansar's main leader, who calls himself Mullah Krekar, has long resided in Norway as a political refugee, even while his subordinates killed civilians as well as Coalition soldiers in Iraq. -- I like Steven Schwartz because he tells it like it is...and also as a convert to Islam he is highly critical of his fellow Muslims. He really is a shinning beacon in a dark, dark seemingly endless tunnel of hate. Andrew B.

 By: Yigal Carmon In the last two months, an organization calling itself the "Abu Hafs Al-Masri Brigades" and claiming to be connected to Al-Qa'ida has published a number of threats addressed at Europe in general and Italy in particular, aiming to prompt a withdrawal of European and Italian forces from Iraq. Today it published a new statement claiming responsibility for this morning's bombing in Istanbul, and announcing that this is the first of a series of upcoming attacks in Europe. This report will assess the veracity of these threats and address questions regarding the existence of such an organization. Content of the 'Brigades' Threats On July 1, 2004, the Abu Hafs Al-Masri Brigades published a long essay titled "The Road Map of the Mujahideen." It included, among other things, threats against European countries: "To the European people … you have but a few days left to accept the peace [ sulh ] which bin Laden has offered you. If you do not do so, you will have only yourselves to blame… Muslims who live in Western nations: those of you who can emigrate to a Muslim country should do so, and those who can not should live in areas inhabited by Muslims; [should make sure] that he and his family have provisions for the coming month and that he has means of protecting himself and his family; [he should make sure] that he has money for one month or more, and should strive to do good deeds." [1] In mid-July the "Abu Hafs Al-Masri Brigades in Italy" published an additional threat explicitly addressing Italy: "This is the last warning to the Italian nation. Either you get rid of the Berlusconi or else we will burn Italy down. This is a clear equation that we are presenting to you in order to clear ourselves of responsibility, for he who warns can not be blamed. You will be seeing the next message on your own territory and not on the Internet. Berlusconi is dragging you into additional bloodshed and total subservience to America… We are capable of hitting quality targets with non-conventional weapons that will cause a huge disaster. A single individual determined to sacrifice himself for a just cause equals an entire army, and September 11 is the best proof of this." [2] On July 28, 2004, the Abu Hafs Al-Masri Brigades published another threat addressing the European governments: "Today we have declared a bloody war against you. We shall not desist from our attacks against you until you come back to your senses, after the reprieve which Sheikh Osama bin Laden has granted you - may Allah keep him - has ended … we will raze the cities of Europe to the ground and you will be first, Berlusconi! We will turn them into [cities] drenched in blood until you, the leaders of Europe and its peoples, return to your senses. Withdraw your troops from Iraq, and walk in the path of those who preceded you, lest you taste the bitter fruits of blood. Do not aid America and that pitiful Bush, commander of the infidels. If you do not do as we say, you will regret it very much, God willing." [3] -- Read all of it. The Radical Islamic Crusade has begun. gear up people...our fate will not be decided by these freaks.

 By ALI AKBAR DAREINI, Associated Press Writer TEHRAN, Iran - Iran on Wednesday test fired a new version of its ballistic Shahab-3 missile, which was already capable of reaching U.S. forces in the Middle East and has since been upgraded in response to Israeli missile development. The Shahab-3, which Iran last successfully tested in 2002 before providing it to the elite Revolutionary Guards, is the country's longest-range ballistic missile, with a range of about 810 miles. It has since been modified to improve its range and accuracy. Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani said last week that the modifications were in response to efforts by Israel to improve its own missiles. No details on the changes, including the new range, were provided. -- Israel...get ready for a bumpy ride. Get the anti-missle-missles ready. Iran is going to open the gates of Hell and Israel will be there to close it for good. If Iran attacks Israel...I am willing to wager Israel is going to send over a nuke and blow them off the face of the map. Andrew B.

 By GAVIN RABINOWITZ, Associated Press Writer KALANDIA CHECKPOINT, West Bank - A car bomb exploded Wednesday near a busy Israeli military checkpoint in the West Bank, killing a 60-year-old Palestinian man and wounding at least 13 people, including both Palestinians and Israelis, officials said. The Al Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, a violent group with ties to Yasser Arafat (news - web sites)'s ruling Fatah (news - web sites) movement, claimed responsibility. In a telephone call to The Associated Press, a member of the group said the car was blown up by remote control, and that the bombing was meant to avenge the killing of a leader of the group by Israel last month. The blast killed 60-year-old Salah Abu Sneineh, and wounded three members of his family, including a 6-year-old grandson who was seriously wounded, hospital officials in the nearby West Bank town of Ramallah said. -- Must be a "WORK ACCIDENT"...You know...the local demolition crew's dynamite went off "prematurely".

 By JAMES C. HELICKE, Associated Press Writer ISTANBUL, Turkey - Turkish police have detained eight people allegedly linked to Kurdish rebels for bomb attacks against two hotels in Istanbul and a liquefied gas plant, police officials said Wednesday. A previously unknown Kurdish group claimed responsibility for the pre-dawn bomb attacks Tuesday that killed two people and wounded 11 others. An al-Qaida-linked group also claimed responsibility in a statement posted on a Web site, but Turkish authorities cast doubt on that claim, saying Kurdish separatists were suspected. Police officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said authorities were questioning the eight, who were detained Tuesday and Wednesday and suspected of links to militant Kurdish groups, about the bombings. Police said it was too early to say if any charges might be brought against them. The officials provided no other details about those in custody. -- A terrorist is a terrorist is a terrorist is a terrorist... Andrew B.

 BAGHDAD, Iraq - Gunmen killed the head of a regional office of one of Iraq (news - web sites)'s largest Shiite parties in a drive-by shooting south of the capital, police and officials said Wednesday. Ali al-Khalisi, the head of Diyala province for the Supreme Council of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, was gunned down in the town of Mahmoudiya, about 25 miles south of Baghdad, said Haitham al-Husseini, a SCIRI spokesman. Gunmen drove up beside his car and opened fire, said Alaa Hussein from Mahmoudiya police, and Dawoud al-Taei, from the hospital that received al-Khalisi. Al-Khalisi was in Mahmoudiya visiting family, al-Husseini said. He blamed Saddam loyalists and insurgents for the killing. -- As usual...disgusting... Andrew B.

 Great News From Israel By DAN WALDMAN, Associated Press Writer JERUSALEM - Israel might "adopt" 6,000 Indians who claim Jewish ancestry, depending on a decision from the Chief Rabbinate, officials said Tuesday. A delegation sent by Chief Rabbi Shlomo Amar traveled to eastern India last week to investigate the group, called the "Bnei Menashe," or children of Manasseh, who claim descent from the lost tribes of Israel, a spokesman for Amar said. About 800 of the Bnei Menashe have been brought to Israel in the last decade by a group called Amishav, Hebrew for "my people returns." However, the program was halted by Interior Minister Avraham Poraz last year because of concern that refugees from developing nations would take advantage of dubious links to the Jewish people to gain entry. "A year ago, Amishav approached the chief rabbi to investigate the issue," said Shlomo Parvar, Amar's spokesman. "He sent a delegation to India to find out if they are Jewish." -- This is great B'nai Israel has been a known Jewish group from India, but for some reason never recognized by Israel. I hope they all can make "Aliyah" and return home finally.



 By RACHEL L. SWARNS ASHINGTON, Aug. 10 — Citing concerns about terrorists crossing the nation's land borders, the Department of Homeland Security announced today that it planned to give border patrol agents sweeping new powers to deport illegal aliens from the frontiers abutting Mexico and Canada without providing the aliens the opportunity to make their case before an immigration judge. The move, which will take effect this month, represents a broad expansion of the authority of the thousands of law enforcement agents who currently patrol the nation's borders. Until now, border patrol agents typically delivered undocumented immigrants to the custody of the immigration courts, where judges determined whether they should be deported or remain in the United States. Homeland Security officials described the immigration courts — which hear pleas for asylum and other appeals to remain in the country — as sluggish and cumbersome, saying illegal immigrants often wait more than a year before being deported, straining the capacity of detention centers and draining critical resources. Under the new system, immigrants will typically be deported within eight days of their apprehension, officials said. -- It's about time...any illegal alien anyway in the country should be deported if they do NOT have the proper paper work on them. It's that simple. This really should be a NO BRAINER. Andrew B.

 By RAJESH MAHAPATRA, Associated Press Writer NEW DELHI - India's Cabinet voted Tuesday to repeal a tough anti-terrorism law that critics say violates human rights and is often misused by authorities to punish political opponents. The Prevention of Terrorism Act, passed by the previous Hindu nationalist government in August 2002, gives authorities sweeping powers to detain suspects for three months without charge and to try anyone suspected of giving money, shelter or other support to terrorists. It allows for the death penalty. The law was intended mainly to combat Islamic militants in India's portion of Kashmir (news - web sites), where more than a dozen guerrilla groups have been fighting for the region's independence or its merger with mostly Muslim Pakistan. Separatist outfits are also battling security forces in India's northeast. However, human rights groups say authorities have used the law to target religious minorities, arresting large numbers of minority Muslims in the western Gujarat state following clashes with majority Hindus. -- There goes India...Without the Indian version of the "Patriot Act", India will not be able to vigorously go into trouble areas and take out threats before they emerge. This really is a huge set back for the world's biggest democracy. Andrew B.

 LONDON (AFP) - At least two Britons have taken up arms in Najaf on the side of Moqtada Sadr, and they say there are more foreigners like them in the radical Iraqi cleric's militia in Najaf, a newspaper reported. "It is our country and there are invaders here," the older of the two Iraqi-born Britons told The Times newspaper's correspondent in Najaf. "We have taken the side of Moqtada Sadr because we believe it is the right side." The Times said the two men, an uncle and nephew just two years apart in age, spoke in "distinctive London accents" and refused to identify themselves beyond their noms de guerre. Neither had weapons training or military experience, but within hours of arriving in Najaf they found themselves guarding the city's sacred Imam Ali shrine, it said. -- What about stories about Iraqis helping to fight terror? Where are the stories of the average Iraqi trying to do his/her part in the rebirth of Iraqi civilization. Where are these stories? We KNOW they exist. The Media refuses to cover it because it would be going along with the notion that the war was justified and thus against their CORE beliefs that the Bush administration waged a preemptive fictious war over fake WMD's.

 By Nima Elbagir KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Sudan carried out fresh helicopter attacks in Darfur on Tuesday and worsened an already desperate humanitarian situation while Arab militia targeted refugees trying to escape the conflict, the United Nations (news - web sites) said. "Fresh violence today (Tuesday) included helicopter gunship bombings by the Sudanese government and Janjaweed (militia) attacks in South Darfur," the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in a statement from Geneva. "The violence has already led to more displacement," the statement said, adding: "Janjaweed attacks on internally displaced persons in and around IDP settlements continue to be reported in all three Darfur states," it added. Civilians have previously said Sudan used helicopters and other military aircraft to attack villages in Darfur, but there have been fewer reports of such attacks since rebels and the government signed a cease-fire in April. -- We can expect the usual Kofi-cake Annan "condemning" these actions with no real teeth of authority. To the EU and the UN...entire villages are wiped out...GONE. An entire culture on the brink of extinction by mass murders...what does the world do? Looks the other way. Why is it that when something happens in Africa people really don't care as much? I am trying to figure it out. Andrew B.

 MOSCOW [MENL] -- Russia has completed more than 90 percent of the Bushehr nuclear reactor in Iran. Russian officials said Moscow has accelerated work on the Bushehr power reactor. They said 1,500 Russian nationals and personnel from the former Soviet Union were sent to Iran to complete the $1 billion nuclear project. So far, officials said, Russia has completed procurement for Bushehr. They said the remaining work includes the assembly of the equipment, systems integration and preparing for operations. "By now, the first power unit of the Bushehr nuclear station is 90 percent ready," a Russian Atomic Agency official told the Moscow-based Tass news agency. "All heavy equipment, including the reactor, has been brought and assembled at the station building." -- Israel get the jets ready...the world is about to get a little crazier in about 6 months...

 Police and Shin Bet officers on Monday arrested Tali Fahima, the left-wing activist and reported lover of Al-Aksa Martyrs Brigades Jenin leader Zakaria Zubeidi, the man she lived with for two weeks in the West Bank city. Her remand was extended by nine days at the Petah Tikva Magistrate's Court on Tuesday. Fahima is suspected of assisting Palestinian terrorists in planning a terrorist attack and committing serious security breaches, Army Radio reported Tuesday. Security officials believe Fahima to be in constant contact with Zubeidi, who is the most wanted terrorist in the Jenin area. Fahima, a resident of Tel Aviv's Yaffo neighborhood, was driving from Tel Aviv to the West Bank when police and Shin Bet officers arrested her, Israel Radio reported Tuesday. Zubeidi, who Fahima says 'is a kindhearted person whom I was lucky to meet,' is wanted for involvement in a number of terrorist attacks. In May, Fahima was arrested at the Salem checkpoint north of Jenin for violating an IDF order not to enter Area A. "There is no chance that she was involved in planning terror attacks," Fahima's lawyer told Army Radio on Tuesday. "Taking into account my experience from the last time Tali was arrested, as well as her personality, I think there is no chance that she was involved in planning terror attacks. She's an Israeli like you and me, and has no interest or motive to plan or help in carrying out attacks against Israelis," she said. -- It's funny how this terrorist enabler resmebles a certain comedian here in America that bad mouths America. Hmmmm...I wonder who she looks like? "Jenin" Gar-AWEFUL-O. Andrew B.

 The United States has refused to allow German judges retrying the only man convicted over the September 11 terrorist attacks to question al-Qa'eda suspects it is believed to have in custody. Mounir El Motassadeq arrives at court with his lawyers The decision, announced to the court in Hamburg in a letter from American officials, threatens to undermine the prosecution's case against Mounir El Motassadeq, who is charged with plotting the attacks and with being a member of a terrorist group. The letter said the judges could not question al-Qa'eda suspects because the United States had to protect its sources and the methods of its intelligence agents. It even said it could not confirm or deny whether it was holding suspects the court wants to question about whether Motassadeq, a 30-year-old Moroccan, was involved in the al-Qa'eda plot. -- This is completely nutz. If this guy goes free...there is not justice in this world...JUST US. Andrew B.

 By Khaled Fahran NAJAF, Iraq (Reuters) - U.S. forces pounded Shi'ite militia from the air and ground in the holy Iraqi city of Najaf on Tuesday, and used loudspeakers to urge the entrenched fighters to lay down their weapons. U.S. helicopter gunships struck positions near the city's ancient Shi'ite Muslim cemetery, a haven for militiamen from firebrand cleric Moqtada al-Sadr's Mehdi Army who have been battling American marines for six straight days. Marines have thrown a tight cordon around the cemetery and the Imam Ali Shrine but have yet to make a full assault on fighters holed up in the sites, a move that would enrage Iraq (news - web sites)'s majority Shi'ite community and probably spark further violence. -- Green light...go go go go. Zulu go go go go...Tango spotted eliminate the enemy. Andrew B.

 DUBAI (AFP) - An Islamic website carried a claim for deadly explosions in Istanbul signed by the Al-Qaeda-linked Abu Hafs al-Masri Brigades and warning of more such attacks in Europe. "The Abu Hafs Brigades have carried out the first of a series of operations that will be launched in the face of European states...and the upcoming attacks will be more violent," said the statement posted on the website Tuesday. It said the strikes were ordered after "all European states rejected the truce offered by our sheikh," Al-Qaeda terror group chief Osama bin Laden (news - web sites). Attacks targeting tourist hotels and a gas complex killed two people and wounded another 11 in Istanbul on Tuesday. "The bitterness that Muslims are tasting in Iraq (news - web sites) and Palestine will be tasted by everyone living in Europe, in Istanbul, Rome and the rest of the countries that are following the policy of the United States," the statement said. A subsequent statement "will disclose the way the mujahedin (fighters) arrived at the site (of the bombing) and how they succeeded in planting the bombs and get away safely," it said. It was the latest in a series of warnings attributed to the Abu Hafs al-Masri Brigades before and after the expiry of Bin Laden's truce offer on July 15, directed notably at Italy but also including Britain and Bulgaria. In a taped message broadcast by the Dubai-based Al-Arabiya television on April 15 the Al-Qaeda chief offered peace to European countries that refrained from aggression towards Muslims and pulled their troops out of the Muslim world within three months from its announcement. -- Is Europe waking up or sleep walking? If Europe is standing its ground with Al-Qaeda...then why is their stance with Iran so different? I am still trying to figure it out. Andrew B.

 BERLIN - Libya agreed Tuesday to pay $35 million in compensation for victims of a 1986 bombing in Berlin that killed two U.S. servicemen and a Turkish woman and injured 229 others, the Libyan ambassador to Germany said. The deal applies to Germans who were wounded in the April 5, 1986 attack on the LaBelle disco and the family of the slain Turkish woman, but not the families of two Americans, Ambassador Said Abdulaati told The Associated Press. It is the latest step in an effort by Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to end his country's pariah status, following agreements to settle the Pan Am and UTA airliner bombing cases. The deal came in negotiations in Berlin between Libyan officials and lawyers for the German victims. "This is a good step," Abdulaati said. A German lawyer involved in the talks also said the two sides had settled. "I can confirm that there has been a settlement for $35 million in the La Belle case," Sven Leistikow told The Associated Press by telephone. The latest talks were held at a secret location in Berlin. The La Belle was a hangout for U.S. soldiers when they were stationed in West Berlin during the city's Cold War division. In retaliation for the bombing, U.S. warplanes carried out airstrikes in Tripoli, killing 37 people, including an adopted daughter of Gadhafi. A Berlin court ruled in 2001 that the bombing was organized by the Libyan secret service and aided by the Libyan Embassy in then-communist East Berlin. It convicted four people of carrying out the bombing, and a federal court upheld their sentences last month. -- Is Libya turning the corner? Andrew B.

 By MOHAMMED DARAGHMEH, Associated Press Writer RAMALLAH, West Bank - Yasser Arafat (news - web sites), pressed by his legislature to commit to promised reforms in writing, has largely been evasive, disappointed lawmakers said Tuesday, after two meetings with the Palestinian leader. Arafat's only concession so far is an assurance that his prime minister, Ahmed Qureia, can appoint Cabinet ministers, said the legislators, members of a committee set up last month to write a reform plan, following growing chaos in the West Bank and Gaza. Qureia briefly resigned last month to protest his lack of powers. Arafat has refused to share power and has run the Palestinian Authority (news - web sites) with a system of patronage, nepotism and official corruption. The Palestinian leader has evaded reform demands by the international community, most recently Egypt which wants him to relinquish some control over the security services ahead of an Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip (news - web sites) in 2005. However, he appears to have been shaken by growing dissatisfaction at home, including unrest in Gaza and open criticism of his rule. -- Evasive?........Evasive?......How about NON-EXISTANT? Andrew B.

 By Jean-Philippe Baille LYON, France (Reuters) - Vandals daubed swastikas and slogans on 56 graves and a war memorial in a Jewish cemetery in eastern France, the latest in a spate of attacks on Jewish, Muslim and Christian property that have shocked France. The attackers also used black paint to scrawl slogans glorifying Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler and declaring "Resistance to the Islamist invasion" on some of the graves on Monday evening in a cemetery in Lyon, France's second city. President Jacques Chirac, the government, opposition and Jewish leaders on Tuesday condemned the attack, which prompted calls for tougher action to prevent such vandalism. More than 300 tombs or graves have been desecrated in eastern France since April -- many in Jewish cemeteries but also some Muslim and a few Christian graves -- despite a drive led by Chirac to eradicate racism and protect France's tolerant image. "It is very symbolic to see graves that bear the Star of David defaced by a swastika," Richard Wertenschlag, Lyon's chief rabbi, said at the cemetery. "It's an indescribable shock." He noted that the attack coincided with the 60th anniversary of France's liberation from Nazi occupation in World War II and described it as an attack on the Jewish community. -- Outrage from who? Certainly not the French people. Certainly NOT the Muslim community. The obvious outrage is coming from the Jewish community in France. We will see what the government is going to do about this digusting act of terrorism and vandalism. Andrew B.

 By GEORGE JAHN, Associated Press Writer VIENNA, Austria - The U.N. nuclear watchdog agency has traced some particles of enriched uranium found in Iran to Pakistan but has not yet verified Tehran's claims that all such material came into the country on equipment bought on the black market, diplomats said Tuesday. Still, the reported finding boosts Iran's stance that it did not process uranium into its enriched form, which can be used both as fuel to generate power or as the core of nuclear warheads. It also weakens the case being built by the United States and its allies accusing the Islamic Republic of past covert enrichment as part of a clandestine weapons program. Iran's contention that all traces of enriched uranium came into the country on "contaminated" black market equipment has been the focus of months of investigations by the International Atomic Energy Agency as it tries to determine whether the Islamic Republic violated the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Faced with evidence, Iran over the past year has acknowledged clandestinely assembling a centrifuge program to enrich uranium for what it says are plans to produce electricity but has denied actually embarking on the process. The enrichment process spins uranium hexaflouride gas through thousands of centrifuges in series to gain increasingly higher levels of a uranium compound that can reach weapons grade above 90 percent. -- You have to love how the IAEA is falling right into the Iran's master plan. Fool everyone until it is too late. Then after it is too late start attacking Israel with nukes and then to Europe. Is Europe in a fog or is it just me. Clueless... Andrew B.

 JERUSALEM - Israeli Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz has frozen a plan to allow Palestinian police to carry handguns in public, after his plan drew sharp criticism from hardline Cabinet ministers, security officials said Tuesday. Last week, Mofaz had agreed to the resumption of armed police patrols to help the Palestinian Authority (news - web sites) deal with lawlessness in the West Bank and Gaza Strip (news - web sites). However, Cabinet hardliners harshly criticized the decision and verbally attacked Mofaz at a Cabinet meeting Sunday. After the meeting, the plan was put on the back-burner and high-level Israeli-Palestinian security talks, which were to have taken place in coming days, were put off, according Israeli security officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. -- That was a shot lived idea. It is better that these "Policemen" do not have weapons that they could GIVE to the terrorists...or even better yet...the police might even be DARE I SAY IT...COMPLICIT in the terror attacks. What a shocker that would be eh? Andrew B.

 By PAUL GARWOOD, Associated Press Writer CAIRO, Egypt - Al-Arabiya TV chief Abdulrahman al-Rashed knows Iraqi militants use his station to get their message to the masses and understands that each time he airs a video of a kidnapped foreigner, terrorists are encouraged to grab others. At rival station Al-Jazeera, chief editor Ahmed al-Sheikh says he faces the same agonizing dilemma every time militants deliver yet another tape bearing a shivering hostage or a deadly threat. But both men, like those at many news organizations, say that though it is becoming increasingly difficult to decide whether to report developments like videotapes of hooded gunmen surrounding captive truck drivers, they can't shirk their responsibilities to cover the news and chase advertising ratings. It is a reality on which militants in Iraq (news - web sites), and recently some militants in the Palestinian territories, are capitalizing. "I am convinced the airing of (militant group) tapes is encouraging more kidnapping, issuing of demands and other examples of this kind," says al-Rashed, general manager of Dubai-based Al-Arabiya, which along with Al-Jazeera TV has been receiving and broadcasting the bulk of the militants' tapes. "We can see it on the ground, but this is the nature of the media and there is little that we can do," he told The Associated Press. -- This is a surprising development in the Arab World...finally someone has woken up and realized that the terrorists are using the Media as part of their terror. If these groups didn't have the Media to convey their message...who knows what could happen. Maybe these attacks could end because the end doesn't justify the means. If everyone in the Media just ignored them and refused to air the videos I wonder what would happen. Andrew B.

 By MARIAM FAM, Associated Press Writer BAGHDAD, Iraq - A militant group on Monday threatened to launch a campaign of attacks against ministers and government offices and warned Iraqi state employees to stay away from work. The group, calling itself the Divine Wrath Brigades, said its "military rebellion and the shelling" would start Tuesday against state buildings. "We warn all civilian government employees and others ... against going to the offices and institutions where they work because they could be subjected to shelling," the group said in a statement. It said humanitarian groups and Health Ministry employees working in hospitals would not be targeted. Meanwhile, insurgents in southern Iraq (news - web sites) attacked and set fire to an office of the political party of interim Prime Minister Ayad Allawi. The attack Sunday night on the Iraqi National Accord party's office in Nasiriyah was claimed by a group calling itself the Islamic Jihad Organization. -- Ever hear the old story of "The Boy Who Cried Wolf"? That is what I am thinking when I hear reports like this...over and over and over again. Andrew B.

 Security sources revealed today that in In months, at least three attempts by Arab terrorists in Israel to use minors in attacks against Jews were foiled. In one case, a group of 11-14-year-olds were caught smuggling weapons between Egypt and Israel. In another case, a 17-year-old Arab youth blew himself up in an attempted attack near the Arab village of Jinsafut, 11 miles east of Kfar Saba. And in yet another incident, three Arab youths aged 13-15 were stopped at an IDF checkpoint in Jenin on their way to carry out a shooting attack in the town of Afula. The security sources say that the latest incidents are only a sample of the widespread use of children and minors in the terrorist war against Israel. Among the actions carried out by minors since the start of the Oslo War in September 2000, are: suicide bombings, riots, clashes with IDF soldiers, smuggling, reconnaissance, serving as spotters, digging tunnels, and more. IsraelNN's Haggai Huberman noted that the defense establishment views the phenomenon of children terrorists as a direct result of the ongoing incitement to violence in the Arafat-controlled and schools. -- Does this come as a real shocker to anyone? I mean really...what else could these terrorists do to shock us? Wait...maybe I shouldn't speak so soon...who knows what will happen in the coming days, weeks, months, years, etc... Andrew B.

 From now on...I will be posting a drawing daily on my blog. The "Art World" has often found inspiration in the social and political spheres. During war time and international conflicts, an artist is frequently seen as a commentator - reflecting their world and ethos in their work. Art may be beautiful or thought-provoking but does not require a factual basis - just a voice. The voice of the contemporary "Art World" has frequently aligned itself with the notion of the unspoken, subjugated or deficient - frequently romanticizing a struggle. Objectivity is never an ideal. It is not a question of whether the "Art World" is just in their representation - they are not claiming to be journalists - but rather, who gets to have a voice. Nowhere is this more evident than in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Since the start of the current "Intifada," many New York museums and galleries have showcased the conflict in solo and group exhibitions - featuring Arab and pro-Arab artists. There has not been a single Israeli or pro-Israeli exhibit. Many European museums and galleries have gone further, banning shows of any Israeli artist. In both instances, only Arabists are given a voice. The Anti-Anti series utilizes semantic portraits of media personalities, international leaders and political pundits to explore the social and political spheres of the "Art World" - asking the audience to question the difference between political art and propaganda, artists' motivations and artistic truth versus fact.

 ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Simultaneous explosions rocked two hotels in tourist areas of Istanbul early on Tuesday, killing one person and injuring eight, and the city's police chief said it appeared to be a terrorist attack. Details were sketchy but television pictures showed emergency services rushing to the scene of the blasts and debris from one explosion lying in the street. Istanbul police chief Celalettin Cerrah told Anatolian news agency the blasts occurred around 2 a.m. local time (7 p.m. EDT Monday). Anatolian said one person was killed and eight injured in the blasts. More than 60 people were killed in four suicide bomb attacks on British and Jewish targets in the city last November. The attacks were carried out by a group linked to al Qaeda.

 (Hat Tip: Teri) August 4, 2004 Participating Media: · The Wall Street Journal · Corriere Della Serra · Bloomberg News · Kommersant · Jewish Telegraphic Agency · Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung · WINK/WNOG Question: How do you see the current power struggles in the Palestinian Authority, the players…and how do you see things developing over the coming weeks and months? Khaled Abu Toameh: The situation in the PA these days is that there is a power struggle raging between what we call the younger generation and the older generation. The young generation, meaning young Fatah activists… the grass root leaders of the Palestinian national movement; and the older generation, represented by Yasser Arafat, or, as some Palestinians call them “the Tunisians”, those who came with Arafat from Tunis. So, there is a power struggle between two generations inside the Palestinian national movement or specifically, inside Fatah, the largest Palestinian faction in the PLO. Some foreign journalists have mistakenly portrayed the power struggle as a power struggle between reformists and corrupt officials. I think it that this is inaccurate because these people who are fighting all belong to the same group…those who are campaigning against the older generation and are in fact fighting for position and money. Mohammad Dahlan, the former Security Minister in the Palestinian Authority, was until recently part of the structure, part of the Palestinian Authority leadership, but when he was dismissed from his job he lost the campaign under the pretext of fighting corruption and demanding reform. Similarly, the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, the armed wing of Fatah, they have also joined the campaign, but they are not reformists, they're not liberal. They are jockeying for power and position and money. They are angry with Arafat because he stopped paying them their salaries. So as I said I disagree with those who tend to describe this power struggle as one between reformists and corrupt officials. Although -- there are demands, growing demands among the Palestinians for reform and an end to corruption. Those reform-minded Palestinians, those Palestinians that want transparency and democracy have taken advantage of the state of lawlessness and chaos, of the fact that there are many militias operating out there in the West Bank and Gaza, to press for reforms and democracy. There is a bit of confusion as to what is happening, but what is certain is that the events of the past few weeks have affected Yasser Arafat's position and status. It doesn't look good for him that Palestinians are fighting amongst each other. All these stories that have come out about corruption in the Palestinian Authority have also affected his status and to a certain extent also have undermined his authority to a point where in recent days he’s been forced to order many of his supporters to come and demonstrate outside his office in order to show the world that the Palestinian people are still with him and they still support him. -- There is more on the link above...if you have the chance...please read the whole thing...pretty amazing.

 By JAMIE TARABAY, Associated Press Writer BAGHDAD, Iraq - Despite the steady clang of mortar shells outside and persistent violence in the country, many delegates at the opening on Sunday of Iraq (news - web sites)'s National Conference held out hope that this first fragile taste of democracy would succeed. "So far, so good," said delegate Saad Qindeel, from the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, the country's largest religious group. "It's important that this conference succeeds, and it has many obstacles before it." The three-day conference is an unprecedented forum for Iraqis of all ethnic and religious groups to discuss their visions for the future of this country, which is struggling with a Sunni insurgency, a renewed uprising by Shiite militants and constant sabotage attacks on its reconstruction efforts.

 Meanwhile, the most prominent Palestinian prisoner is working on a smooth transition in the Gaza Strip (news - web sites) after Israel's planned withdrawal next year. Marwan Barghouti, a leader of Yasser Arafat (news - web sites)'s Fatah (news - web sites) movement, has presented an 18-point plan for Gaza to Hamas and Islamic Jihad, and the leaders of the two militant groups responded "positively, in principle," according to a source close to Barghouti. A copy of the plan was obtained by The Associated Press. Barghouti proposed that after the Israeli withdrawal, militant groups be given a role in running Gaza, but insisted that they halt attacks on Israel from that territory — though not from the West Bank. Militants would stop parading armed in public, and within three months of the withdrawal would have to sell their weapons to the security forces. Gunmen could join the security forces, but would have to cut their ties with the militant groups. Since Israel announced its pullout plan earlier this year, concerns have been raised about a power vacuum and a possible takeover by Islamic militants. Under Barghouti's plan, Arafat's Palestinian Authority (news - web sites) would be the sovereign in Gaza, but a "monitoring committee" with representatives from all groups would have considerable say. -- What a crock of shit. I have read some serious propaganda in my day, but this takes the ticket...not because it os from a known international terrorist, but more so that the AP just accepts it as facts rather than "window dressing"...

 By Paul Hughes TEHRAN (Reuters) - A senior Iranian military official said Sunday Israel and the United States would not dare attack Iran since it could strike back anywhere in Israel with its latest missiles, news agencies reported. Iranian officials have made a point of highlighting the Islamic state's military capabilities in recent weeks in response to some media reports that Israeli or U.S. warplanes could try to destroy Iranian nuclear facilities in air strikes. Iran last week said it carried out a successful test firing of an upgraded version of its Shahab-3 medium-range ballistic missile. Military experts said the unmodified Shahab-3 was already capable of striking Israel or U.S. bases in the Gulf. "The entire Zionist territory, including its nuclear facilities and atomic arsenal, are currently within range of Iran's advanced missiles," the ISNA students news agency quoted Yadollah Javani, head of the Revolutionary Guards political bureau, as saying. "Therefore, neither the Zionist regime nor America will carry out its threats" against Iran, he said. An attack on Iran "could only be carried out by angry or stupid people. For that reason, officials of the Islamic Republic must always be prepared to counter possible military threats," Javani said in a statement, ISNA reported. -- The boy that cried wolf...remember that story...Iran is slowly becoming the boy who cried wolf... Eventually Israel is going to take out their nuke reactor before it goes online. It is at that time...we will see who will flinch first. The Iranians will try to launch a multi prong attack on Israel...trying to target many cities at once with a barrage of missles. These will fail because Israel's missle defense system is now in place. I would not be surprised if the Iranians try to launch missle attacks at the same time towards various cities in Israel. If the Iranians launch missles at these cities...Israel will nuke Tehran to send them a lesson. The fallout would be HUGE (no pun intended)...mostly against Israel in terms of world opinion. (Not that Israel cares too much already about that...) In terms of political fallout...The Iranians would have no choice but to launch everything they have at Israel, US, and Europe in a last gasp of evil. Israel again would probably nuke them again thus ending the Iranians. (all of which I do not want to happen, but most likely will happen) There isn't much that we can do. The only thing that we can pray for and try to help facilitate is the democratic revolution in Iran. We need their country to implode socially. The students and people that lvoe freedom need to stand up for what is right and take back their culture and country. This is the only way we can prevent a nuke going off in Tehran. I wish there was another way...but there isn't. The IAEA, EU and the UN are jokes. They keep threatening Iran, but the Iranians laugh it off and use the stonewalling as time to speed up their "Tehran Project". Because the international community is so lax with Iran, the Mullahs have taken it upon themselves to use every bit of spare time to prepare for doomsday. Andrew B.

 Ketziot Prison, one of the largest IDF detention centers for Palestinian security prisoners located along the Egyptian border, has recently received seven unexpected visitors. The prison, which has some 1,500 Palestinian detainees locked up, is currently holding seven Sudanese nationals who illegally crossed the border with Egypt into Israel after walking by foot from their villages in the country's war-torn Darfur region. Five of the prisoners arrived in Israel close to two months ago, and another two were brought to the jail last week. The seven say they fled their homes fearing for their lives after civil war and a humanitarian crisis struck their homeland. "We ran away since we were afraid we would get killed," said Aaron, one of the prisoners. Aaron, in his late twenties, said that his sister and two of his brothers were gunned down by terrorists shortly before his village was demolished. Together with four of his friends, he set out in search of a place of sanctuary, eventually arriving in Israel. "We are happy that we got here," another of the prisoners added. "Israel is a free country and we hope that we will be able to stay." The 15-month conflict in the Darfur region has reportedly claimed the lives of 30,000 people, driven more than one million people from their homes to other parts of Sudan, and forced some 200,000 to flee to Chad. Prison officials admit that the Sudanese are a bit out of place in the high-security IDF jail, but that under the current conditions in Israeli prisons, no one is willing to take them. -- This is so unbelievable. These people walked on foot to Israel. People we are talking like hundreds and hundreds of miles. They could have fled into Chad or other countries but they went to Israel because in their words..."Israel is a free country"...this would be GREAY PR for Israel if they accept them as refugees, just to show the rest of the world that Israel is a kind country and willing to take desperate people into their borders. When this story came to my attention...I couldn't believe it. How could anyone walk that far, but then I thought to myself... The Jews walked for ages in the vast wilderness and sandy deserts to find the land of Israel. So for these people to find their way to Israel really isn't that amazing as it is Destiny. Israel is a land of hope. Jews come from all over to find themselves in Israel, but it is not only Jews that look toward Zion to find peace anymore. Israel is slowly becoming the America of the Middle East. People who want a brighter future move to Israel because of the opportunities for jobs and better life. It is just like America...only Jewish and smaller. Andrew B.

 BAGHDAD, Iraq - Iraqi police ordered all journalists to leave the holy city of Najaf on Sunday, just as a new U.S. offensive against militants hiding out in a revered shrine began. Four police cars surrounded a hotel in the city where journalists were staying and presented the order signed by Najaf's police chief, Brig. Ghalib al-Jazaari. It did not spell out a punishment for those who did not comply, but police who delivered the order said any reporters remaining would be arrested, according to journalists at the hotel. The police said any cameras and cellular phones they saw would be confiscated. In response to the threat, many journalists left the city. Later Sunday, the government appeared to be backing down. Government spokesman George Sada said he contacted Interior Minister Falah Hassan al-Naqib, who informed him that police will be "taking it easy on the journalists." -- This is something that should have been done a long time ago. These reporters are giving away too much information to the enemy...whether it is on purpose or not... Andrew B.

 GAZA CITY (AFP) - Any progress in the Middle East peace process is dependent on the release of all the 8,000 Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails, prime minister Ahmed Qorei warned. In a statement released to mark the start of an open-ended hunger strike by the prisoners, Qorei said their plight was one of his administration's top priorities. "The release of all the prisoners is an essential condition for any solution or progress in the peace porcess," the prime minister said Sunday. "The government regards the prisoners issue as being at the top of its list of priorities." -- Yeah that sounds like a great idea...release all the terrorists out into the wilderness AGAIN. Hell no. What kind of negotiating is this? It is a bit ONE SIDED don't you think? Why should Israel release these animals? Why? Why should Israel endanger it's citzens like that? That would be political and physical suicide for Israel. Andrew B.

 NEW DELHI (AFP) - Dozens were killed or injured, many of them children, in two blasts in India as the country's premier marked Indian Independence Day with a pledge to wage an unrelenting fight against terrorism. "We will unitedly combat this. Let there be no doubt on this score because violence cannot lead to development and progress," Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said Sunday on his first Independence Day since taking office in May His speech from the ramparts of the Red Fort in the capital, New Delhi, came as festivities were marred by a powerful blast at a college parade ground in the rebel-infested northeastern state of Assam that killed 15 people. "Seven of the dead were boys between 10 and 12, six were women believed to be their mothers or relatives. There were also two men who died," Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi told a news conference in state capital Guwahati. -- Must be those pesky Buddhists and Jews colaborating again...(sarcasm) Andrew B.

 MALE (AFP) - Hundreds of people were rounded up in the Maldives, South Asia's most expensive resort paradise, after President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom imposed a state of emergency following protests against his rule, dissidents said. State radio said on Sunday the National Security Service (NSS) and police had arrested 185 people after protests Friday against Gayoom, Asia's longest-serving leader. But the Moldavian Democratic Party (MDP), which is campaigning for a multi-party democracy in the tiny, one-party Indian Ocean atoll nation, said hundreds more were detained Sunday. "Our activists are in hiding," MDP spokesman in Colombo, Mohamed Latheef, told AFP. "Security personnel are going from house to house and pulling out suspected dissidents and beating them up in public." -- Sounds like it's "par for course" to arrest people for speaking out for democracy in Muslim countries. It is sad that these things are happening, but it is important for the world to know that these people want democracy. Men and women in Muslim countries around the world can see that democracy in Iraq and Afghanistan is almost tangible and they want that too. It is time for people to rise up in their countries...and change. Andrew B.

 ROME (AFP) - Italy was on alert after a group claiming to be linked to Al-Qaeda threatened to launch attacks throughout the country and target Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi following the expiry of an ultimatum for Rome to pull its troops out of Iraq (news - web sites). "This message follows the same logic as the previous ones," Interior Minister Giuseppe Pisanu told a news conference in Rome. "We are not underestimating it but we are not going to be intimidated and we have confidence in the substantial protection measures that have been introduced," he said Sunday. The threat, signed by a group calling itself the Abu Hafs al-Masri Brigades-Al-Qaeda and posted on an Islamist website, did not deter British Prime Minister Tony Blair (news - web sites) from arriving in Italy with his family at the weekend to visit Berlusconi. -- Never hit an Italian...never. Let al-Qaeda learn the hard way. Hell hath no fury like an Italian scorned. Andrew B.

 By ABDUL HUSSEIN AL-OBEIDI, Associated Press Writer NAJAF, Iraq - Explosions and gunfire shook the center of Najaf on Sunday as U.S. troops in armored vehicles and tanks rolled back into the holy city and new fighting broke out after truce talks collapsed. The new U.S. offensive in Najaf cast a pall over Sunday's opening of the National Conference, a gathering of more than 1,000 delegates from across Iraq (news - web sites) seen as a key step toward democracy in the country. Hours after the conference opened, insurgents fired a barrage of mortars that hit a commuter bus station in central Baghdad, killing two people and wounding 17 others, according to the Health Ministry. -- Go in...get them...and get out. Sounds easier said than done, but that is basically what needs to happen. Andrew B.

 By LAURIE COPANS, Associated Press Writer JERUSALEM - About 1,600 Palestinian prisoners began a hunger strike Sunday to protest conditions in Israeli jails, despite a warning by Israel's public security minister that they could "starve to death" before he agrees to ease restrictions. An extended fast by this many inmates would be the biggest challenge to Israeli prison authorities since the outbreak of Israeli-Palestinian fighting in 2000. The remaining Palestinian prisoners and detainees — Israel holds a total of about 7,500 — are to join the hunger strike by the end of the week, organizers said. In the past four years, Israeli troops have rounded up thousands of Palestinians on suspicion they were involved in bombing and shooting attacks that have killed nearly 1,000 Israelis. The prisoners are being held in Israeli jails, a large tent camp in the Negev Desert, and at crowded military bases in the West Bank where prisoners have complained of poor sanitary conditions. -- Someone famous once...said..."Let them eat cake." Andrew B.

 BAGHDAD, Iraq - Three mortars hit a commuter bus station in central Baghdad on Sunday afternoon, killing at least one person and injuring several others, officials said. There were contradictory reports of death tolls. Police Lt. Yasser Fawaz, who was at the scene, said about 10 people were killed and about 15 others injured. Interior Ministry spokesman Col. Adnan Abdulrahman said the attack killed one person and injured five others. The mortar barrage came just hours after the start of a heavily secured national conference meant to move Iraq (news - web sites) on the road toward democracy. -- Killing innocence is never good or right. It disgusts me to no end...to hear stories like this. Andrew B.

 BAGHDAD, Iraq - A Ukrainian soldier was killed Sunday in a land mine explosion southeast of Baghdad, a spokesman for the multinational forces said. The blast occurred n the area of Suwayrah, 25 miles south of Baghdad, in the Ukrainian troops' area of responsibility. -- More Updates to come

 By LOUIS MEIXLER, Associated Press Writer ANKARA, Turkey - Islamic militants volunteering to fight in Iraq (news - web sites) or carrying cash to fuel the insurgency are using fake passports or bribes to sneak across the Syrian border into Iraq, according to the U.S.-led coalition. Others bypass guard posts and simply drive across the poorly patrolled desert border. Iraqi and U.S. officials are boosting efforts to close the porous crossing points, calling it a key step in fighting the insurgency. But they have to protect 2,200 miles of frontier shared with six countries — Turkey, Syria, Iran, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Iraq is training 15,000 new border guards and hopes to have them in place within six weeks in an effort to stem the flow of volunteers, said Ziad Cattan, deputy secretary general of the Iraqi Defense Ministry. Cattan refused to say how many guards are now on the border, commenting only that it was "really not a lot." -- Gee...like I couldn't have written this article... Andrew B.

 President George Bush will announce tomorrow that the US military will pull up to 100,000 troops out of Europe and Asia in the biggest redeployment since the end of the Cold War. The plan will see a number of US bases in Germany closed down, and troops returned home or redeployed to Eastern Europe. The redeployment - first reported by The Observer in February last year in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq - will be presented by Bush as a logical response to the war on terrorism when he addresses the 2.6 million-member Veterans of Foreign Wars at its annual convention in Cincinnati. In February last year, however, when the proposal was first mooted, Pentagon officials presented the closure of the bases in Germany as punishment for Germany's refusal to back the war in Iraq. -- It's about time. Why do we have to have German bases and bases in South Korea? The logical places to put troops would be in Eastern and southern Europe where a new threat is emerging, radical Islam. I think the perfect place for bases would be a strategic base in Poland, a satelite base in Ukraine, possibly a couple in the Balkans and way out in Azerbaijan. This would be huge for the US. We would have a better grasp of what is really happening in Europe. Not only that, but we can set up a defense system with anti-missle missles...so that if Iran tries to attack Europe...they will be disappointed. This is the new face of war...you must adapt or you will lose. Our enemy uses stealth-like tactics and cowardly hides within the community. Our new weapon is not a gun or tank or special goggles. It is intelligence...it is the reinvention of spies and lingusts that will break these terrorists. We need more smart people in the field to translate and help prevent another 9/11. Obviously there is more to it than that, but you get the idea. Andrew B.
