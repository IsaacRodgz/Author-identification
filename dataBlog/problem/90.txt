Coolgal805: really so gershon can technically1 Jumper991: Last Updated: Thursday, 15 May, 2003, 12:50 GMT 13:50 UK Email this to a friend Printable version The new rules of sex What you get up to in the bedroom, or elsewhere, has never been entirely your business. Soon, a raft of new sex laws will be enacted. So what will be allowed and outlawed? By the yardstick of the English poet Philip Larkin, the sexual revolution is marking its 40th birthday this year. "Sexual intercourse," Larkin once famously declared in one of his verses, "began in 1963 (Which was rather late for me)". The broadminded, however, would argue that any genuine breakthrough in sexual attitudes never got off the starting blocks. Many of Britain's sex laws are a throwback to another era. Even the wording can read like something out of a Dickens novel. For example, the man in the dirty old raincoat who bares all to a passer-by, might expect to be charged with "exposing the person". The term features in the Vagrancy Act 1824 and the Town Police Clauses Act 1847 - both of which are relied on to prosecute flashers, along with the common law offence of "outraging public decency". "The law on sex offences is largely recognised as archaic, incoherent and discriminatory," said Home Secretary David Blunkett recently. That's about to change. With the new Sexual Offences Bill, the government has come up with a brand new set of sex rules that are destined to overturn many of the old laws. So what will and won't be allowed in 21st Century Britain? HOMOSEXUAL GROUP SEX SEXUAL OFFENCES BILL The bill proposes tougher laws on rape and child sex abuse It also repeals offences such as buggery and gross indecency And tightens up on non-consensual sex of all kinds There's nothing to stop heterosexual orgies, but take women out of the equation and you've currently got yourself a law suit. The issue was highlighted three years ago when the European Court overturned a conviction in the so-called ADT case - named after the initials of the three men involved. The case became a cause celebre for many gays after police in Yorkshire prosecuted a man after they were handed a sex video filmed at his home of the accused and two male friends. The new law takes a "gender neutral" approach to sex, granting equal rights to homosexuals and heterosexuals. INDECENT EXPOSURE The tendency has sometimes been to dismiss flashers as "dirty old men"; sad and harmless. But the new law comes down hard on the raincoat brigade, threatening a prison term of up to two years. Research has shown a link between flashing and more serious sexual crime. However, it shouldn't stop naturists doing what comes naturally. MPs have responded to naturists' concerns that by going naked they might fall foul of the new law, by amending the bill. Streakers are also protected, and should continue to be treated as a social nuisance rather than sexual offenders. Under the new bill, the (relatively few) women who indecently expose themselves will be punished as harshly as the men. VOYEURISM Indecent exposure it ain't The days of the old "peeping Tom" are gone. Voyeurism today is about miniature video cameras and posting films on the net. And like indecent exposure, there is evidence to link the practise of secretly watching someone with more serious offences (one study found 14% of child molesters and 20% of rapists had "committed voyeurism"). In the past, there has been a tendency to regard the practice as a nuisance rather than a crime. The proposed new law threatens a two-year sentence for anyone who views a film knowing the subject had not given consent. BESTIALITY The proposals represent a softening attitude to so-called "zoophiles", who risk a life sentence under the terms of the current law. It ties into the bill's general theme of "consent" - that fundamentally all sexual activity should be mutually agreed. But again, research has shown a link between abuse of animals and abuse of children. Nevertheless, the proposal has drawn criticism from libertarians, such as Francis Bennion, a barrister and author of The Sex Code, a moral guide to sex. He argues that since the act is recognised to be "profoundly disturbed behaviour" zoophiles should be sent not to prison, but the psychiatrist's couch. NECROPHILIA Many people will be alarmed that sex with dead people is not currently a crime. But that's about to change even though critics argue cases of necrophilia are rare and this is simply an opportunity for the government to reinforce its high moral authority. Nevertheless, offenders can expect anything up to two years in prison. Coolgal805: hhah so gershon is going to jail...but hopefully u wont die soon!

 stolen from dani...... really funny DynamiteDG: A man is lying in a hospital bed with an oxygen mask over his mouth. A young nurse enters his room to sponge his face and hands. "Nurse," he mumbles from behind the mask, "Are my testicles black?" Embarrassed, the young nurse replies, "I don't know Mr. Jones, I'm only here to wash your face and hands." He struggles again to ask, "Nurse, are my testicles black?" Again the nurse replies, "I can't tell. I'm only here to wash your face and hands." The head nurse walks by and sees the man getting a little distraught, so she marches over to find out what's wrong. "Nurse," he mumbles, "are my testicles black?" The head nurse whips back the sheets, pulls down the man's pajamas, moves his penis out of the way, has a good look, pulls up the pajamas and says, "There's nothing wrong with them." Frustrated at this, the man pulls off his oxygen mask and asks again, "I said, are my test results back?!" rikki713: lol! DynamiteDG: A guy was walking down the street when he sees a woman with perfect breasts. He says to her, "Hey, miss, would you let me bite your breasts for $100?" "Are you nuts?" she replies and walks away. He turns around, runs around the block and gets to the corner before she does. "Would you let me bite your breasts for $1,000?" he asks again. "Listen, sir, I'm not that kind of woman. Got it?" So the guy runs around the next block and faces her again. "Would you let me bite your breasts... just once for $10,000?" So the woman thinks about this for a while and says, "Hmmmmm, $10,000?" She thinks a bit "OK, but just once, and not here. Let's go to that dark alley over there." So they go to the alley and she takes off... her blouse to reveal the most perfect breasts in the world. As soon as the guy sees them, he jumps on them and starts caressing them, fondling them, kissing them, burying his face in them... but not biting them. Finally, the woman gets all annoyed and says, "Are you gonna bite them or what?" "Nah," he replies. "Costs too much!" rikki713: lol DynamiteDG: Becky was on her death bed with her husband, John, maintaining a steady vigil by her side. As he held her fragile hand, his warm tears ran silently down his face, splashed onto her face, and roused her from her slumber. She looked up and her pale lips began to move slightly. "My darling John," she whispered. "Hush, my love," he said. "Go back to sleep. Shhh. Don't talk." But she was insistent. "John," she said in her tired voice. "I have to talk. I have something I must confess to you." "There's nothing to confess," replied the weeping John. "It's all right. Everything's all right, go to sleep now." "No, no. I must die in peace, John. I slept with your brother, your best friend and your father." John mustered a pained smile and stroked her hand. "Hush now Becky, don't torment yourself. I know all about it." he said, "Why do you think I poisoned you?" rikki713: hahaha DynamiteDG: On a transatlantic flight, a plane passes through a severe storm. The turbulence is awful, and things go from bad to worse when one wing is struck by lightning. One woman in particular loses it. Screaming, she stands up in front of the plane. "I'm too young to die!" she wails. "Well, if I'm going to die, I want my last minutes on Earth to be memorable! I've had plenty of sex in my life, but no one has ever made me really feel like a woman! Well I've had it! Is there ANYONE on this plane who can make me feel like a WOMAN??" For a moment, there is silence. Everyone has forgotten their own peril, and they all stare, riveted, at the desperate woman in the front of the plane. Then, a man stands up in the rear of the plane. "I can make you feel like a woman," he says. He's gorgeous. Tall, built, with long, flowing black hair and jet black eyes, he starts to walk slowly up the aisle, unbuttoning his shirt one button at a time. No one moves. The woman is breathing heavily in anticipation as the stranger approaches. He removes his shirt. Muscles ripple across his chest as he reaches her, and extends the arm holding his shirt to the trembling woman, and whispers: "Iron this." rikki713: omg DynamiteDG: A police officer attempts to stop a car for speeding and the guy gradually increases his speed until he's topping 100 mph. He eventually realizes he can't escape and finally pulls over. The cop approaches the car and says, "It's been a long day and my tour is almost over, so if you can give me a good excuse for your behavior, I'll let you go." The guy thinks for a few seconds and then says, "My wife ran away with a cop about a week ago. I thought you might be that officer trying to give her back!" rikki713: lol DynamiteDG: An older man goes to the Doctor in desire of a prescription for Viagra. The Doctor looks over the man, and says, "Viagra can be very dangerous and we do not just dispense it indiscriminately, Please bring your wife to my office next week and we'll discuss this in more detail. So the following week he shows up with his wife. The Doctor asks to see the wife by herself for a few moments and she follows him back to the examining room. The doctor asks her to disrobe and she does. He then asks her to turn around in 360 degrees a few times then instructs her to get up on the examining table and to turn in various positions. He then tells her she can get dressed and goes out to meet the Male Patient. "Sir," The Doctor Says, "There is nothing wrong with you, I couldn't get an erection either. rikki713: hahaha DynamiteDG: Jim and Edna were both patients in a mental hospital. One day while they were walking past the hospital swimming pool, Jim suddenly jumped into the deep end. He sank to the bottom of the pool and stayed there. Edna promptly jumped in to save him. She swam to the bottom and pulled Jim out. When the hospital director became aware of Edna's heroic act she immediately ordered that Edna be discharged from the hospital because she now considered Edna to be mentally stable. The director went to Edna and said, "I have some good news and some bad news. The good news is that you're being discharged because you responded so rationally to a crisis by jumping in the pool to save the life of another patient. Your action displays sound mindedness. The bad news is that Jim, the patient you saved, hung himself in the bathroom with his bathrobe belt right after you saved him. I am so sorry, but he's dead." Edna replied, "He didn't hang himself. I put him there to dry. How soon can I go home?" DynamiteDG: A husband, wife and son are barely making ends meet on their farm. One morning the woman sees the family's only cow lying dead in the field and hangs herself in desperation. When the man awakens, he sees his wife and cow dead and shoots himself. The son finds his parents dead and goes to drown himself, only to discover a mermaid at the river. The mermaid tells him, "If you have sex with me 10 times in a row, I will revive your parents and the cow." "Why not 20?" replies the son. "Fine," she says. "Twenty it is." "But wait," says the boy. "How do I know that 20 times in a row won't kill you like it did the cow?" DynamiteDG: Two new members of a hunting lodge get introduced to its oldest member. They ask him to tell his favorite hunting story, and he agrees. “Well, back in 1944 in Africa,” the old man starts, “we went big-game hunting. Didn’t have much luck at first, but on the third day I was resting by a tree when I heard a noise. Next thing I know the biggest lion I’ve ever seen jumped out of the bushes at me like this…RO-A-A-R-R-R! Well, I just shit my pants.” The young men are amazed. One of them says, “I don’t blame you. I’d crap my pants too if a lion jumped at me like that!” The old man shakes his head and says, “No, no, not then—just now when I said roar!” DynamiteDG: A bus carrying only ugly people crashes into an oncoming truck, and everyone inside dies. They then get to meet their maker, and because of the grief they have experienced; He decides to grant them one wish each, before they enter Paradise. They're all lined up, and God asks the first one what the wish is. "I want to be gorgeous," and so God snaps His fingers, and it is done. The second one in line hears this and says "I want to be gorgeous too." Another snap of His fingers and the wish is granted. This goes on for a while but when God is halfway down the line, the last guy starts laughing. When there are only ten people left, this guy is rolling on the floor, laughing. Finally, God reaches this guy and asks him what he wants. The guy calms down and says: " Make 'em all ugly again."

 DynamiteDG: A bus carrying only ugly people crashes into an oncoming truck, and everyone inside dies. They then get to meet their maker, and because of the grief they have experienced; He decides to grant them one wish each, before they enter Paradise. They're all lined up, and God asks the first one what the wish is. "I want to be gorgeous," and so God snaps His fingers, and it is done. The second one in line hears this and says "I want to be gorgeous too." Another snap of His fingers and the wish is granted. This goes on for a while but when God is halfway down the line, the last guy starts laughing. When there are only ten people left, this guy is rolling on the floor, laughing.

 This was written by a black guy in Texas..... When I born, I black, when I grow up, I black, when I go in sun, I black, when I cold, I black, when I scared, I black, when I sick, I black, and when I die, i still black. You white folks....when you born, you pink, when you grow up, you white, when you go in sun, you red, when you cold, you blue, when you scared, you yellow, when you sick, you green, when you bruised, you purple, and when you die, you gray. So who you callin' colored folk's???

 Car Crash A man and his girlfriend are driving down the highway. The man asks 'If I drive 100 mph, will you take off your clothes?' and she agrees. So the man drives 100 mph and his girlfriend strips. The man is so busy looking at his girlfriend that he crashes into a tree. The car flips over, trapping the man and all of his girlfriend's clothes. All that is free of the car is the man's girlfriend and one of his shoes. The man yells, 'You have to go get help. Go to that gas station over there.' His girlfriend says, 'Are you kidding me? I'm naked.' 'Well,' replies the man 'Take my shoe over there, cover up yourself, and go get help.' So the woman covers herself with the shoe and goes to the gas station. She says to an attendant 'You have to help me. My boyfriend's trapped' 'I'm sorry ma'am' the attendant replies, 'he's too far in.'

 When the good Lord was making the world, he called Man aside and bestowed upon him 20 years of normal sex life. Man was horrified, but the Creator refused to budge. Then the Lord called the Monkey and gave him 20 years. "But I don't need 20 years," said the Monkey. "Ten years is plenty." "May I have the other 10 years?" asked Man. The Monkey agreed. The Lord called the Lion next and also gave him 20 good years. The Lion also only wanted 10, so again Man asked for the remaining ten. Then came the Donkey, who was also granted 20 years. Like the others, 10 was more than enough. Man again asked for the spare ten years and got them. This explains why Man has 20 years of normal sex life, 10 years of monkeying around, 10 years of lion 'bout it, and 10 years of making an ass out of himself.

 This guy is suffering from extereme abdominal pain so he goes to the doctor. The doctor says that the problem is serious, but with medicated rectal inserts the problem should go away. After the inital insertion, the Doctor explains that the second should be inserted before bed. That night, before he goes to bed, the man attempts to insert the medicine. After about 15 unsuccessful tries he calls his wife for help. His wife puts one hand on his shoulder and inserts the medicine. He lets out a scream. 'Did I hurt you?' his wife asks. "No, but when I was at the doctor's, he had TWO hands on my shoulders!'

 A bear was chasing a little rabbit. "Stop running and get back here!" yelled the bear. "Never!" shouted the rabbit. As the rabbit was running he tripped on a lamp. His soft furry foot brushed the lamp and out popped a genie. The genie noticed the frightened rabbit was being chased by the bear. The genie said to the bear,"Hey! If you stop chasing him I''ll grant you and the rabbit both two wishes!" The bear agreed and was so eager he jumped to go first. He said, "I wish that a had the biggest penis in the world!" *Poof!* and his wish was granted. The rabbit went next, "I wish I had a super fast motorcycle!" *Poof* and the rabbit''s wish was granted. The bear looked at the rabbit and thought, "What a lame wish!" For his final wish, the bear smirked as he wished that all the other bears in the world were female. *Poof* his wish was granted. The rabbit jumped on his motorcycle, revved the engine and laughed. Just before he booked out of there he said, "I wish the bear was gay!"

 A group of guys were chatting with a good-looking girl and, somewhat improbably, asked her to climb this pole that was conveniently nearby. For whatever reason, she decided to do it. When she told her mother what happened, her mother scolded her: "Don't you understand that they only wanted to see your underwear?" The girl was understandably upset at being very stupid and naive, and decided to show those boys a thing or two. The next day, they repeated their request, and when she came home she was beaming. "What are you so happy about?" asked her mother. "I totally showed them. Today I didn't even WEAR underwear." ha who does that remind you of?

 One Friday, two women were sitting and talking. One woman looked up and saw her husband coming down the street with a bunch of flowers in his hand. She rolled her eyes and said, “There comes the asshole with flowers in his hand. Now he'll expect me to spend the weekend on my back with my legs in the air.” Her friend promptly replied, “Don't you have a vase?”

 Impossible is just a big word thrown around by small men who find it easier to live in the world they've been given than to explore the power they have to change it. Impossible is not a fact. It's an opinion. Impossible is not a declaration. It's not a dare. Impossible in potential. Impossible is temporary. Impossible is nothing.

 We've spent a lot -- and we mean A LOT -- of time debating "The Bases." What are they? When's the best time to hit each one? Does holding hands lead to kissing, or is it kissing that leads to a little of the touchy-feely? Ask three people what it means to get to second and you'll get three different answers. Tell those same three people that hitting a triple on a first date is okay, and watch the fireworks erupt. Trust us -- this topic elicits more unease and discomfort than Pamela Anderson's eternally shape-shifting boobs. And so we ask you, oh wise eCRUSHers: 1) First base is: Holding Hands Kissing Frenching Juggling the Jugs 2) Second base is: Frenching Juggling the Jugs Below the Belt Frisking Oral 3) Third base is: Below the Belt Frisking Bump-n-Grind Oral Doing the Deed 4) A home run is: Bump-n-Grind Oral Doing the Deed Morally Reprehensible 5) How far SHOULD you go on a first date? First Base Second Base Third Base Home Run 6) How far WOULD you go on a first date? First Base Second Base Third Base Home Run 7) Should you wait until marriage to hit a home run? No - take the car for a test drive first, if you know what I mean. Maybe -- it totally depends on the person you're dating. Absolutely -- wait until after you're married. I can't get married anywhere but Toronto and Holland, so this question is insulting and stupid. 1. First base is: Holding Hands 15% Kissing 46% Frenching 36% Juggling the Jugs 3% 2. Second base is: Frenching 40% Juggling the Jugs 34% Below the Belt Frisking 23% Oral 2% 3. Third base is: Below the Belt Frisking 45% Bump-n-Grind 12% Oral 40% Doing the Deed 3% 4. A home run is: Bump-n-Grind 13% Oral 5% Doing the Deed 76% Morally Reprehensible 6% 5. How far SHOULD you go on a first date? First Base 79% Second Base 16% Third Base 2% Home Run 3% 6. How far WOULD you go on a first date? First Base 45% Second Base 35% Third Base 9% Home Run 11% 7. Should you wait until marriage to hit a home run? No - take the car for a test drive first, if you know what I mean. 25% Maybe -- it totally depends on the person you're dating. 50% Absolutely -- wait until after you're married. 24% I can't get married anywhere but Toronto and Holland, so this question is insulting and stupid. 2%

 Wanna know a secret? That Hamlet guy? Had it all wrong. Seriously -- "To be or not to be?" Whatever! To date or not to date -- that's the real question! So, when it comes to dating, are you in it for the long haul, or do you have the attention span of a gnat? Do you immediately start picking out china patterns with your significant other, or do you make like Julia Roberts in Runaway Bride and bolt at the first sign of commitment? Take our fast and easy quiz to find out whether you're a Devoted Dater or a Dedicated Dumper. It's six simple questions -- and your life may depend on it! Okay, not really, but don't you want to know? 1) You're on your first date. Within fifteen minutes of sitting down, a couple of your date's friends show up and join you at your table. What do you do? Embrace this turn of events -- the more the merrier! Wonder what the hell your date's thinking, but play along anyway. Hit on one -- or all -- of the friends. 2) Your date's cell rings during dinner, and they answer the call to start yakking and giggling with one of their friends. What do you do? Shoot death rays of hatred from your eyes in your date's general direction. Tensely shred your napkin to bitty pieces while waiting for them to get off the phone. Maintain eye contact with your date while smirking and mouthing things like, "Who is it?" and "What's so funny?" 3) Your date suggests an appetizer loaded with garlic. You: Assume this will not be a romantic evening. At all. Assume your date has a fondness for garlic. Assume nothing! You don't even know this person that well! 4) Pick a Hollywood Tom: Tom Hanks Tom Cruise Tom Green 5) Your love life can best be summarized by which Hollywood movie title? The Wedding Planner. How To Lose A Guy in 10 Days. Some Like It Hot. 6) Which is your favrote shade of J. Crew blue? Heather Champagne. Pewter Moor. Splash. Dedicated Dumper Don't know if you know this, but -- hey, where are you going? Just sit still and listen for a second: If the Short Attention Span Theater was looking for a new above-the-title star, you'd be perfect for the job. You are to dating what ADD is to -- hey! Over here, okay? Now, where were we? Oh, forget it -- you get the idea, right? It's just that someday, when you realize you really want a significant other? Let's hope you've managed to work out your issues with commitment first.

 how dirty is your mind? 1) If the motion picture ratings board got inside your head and saw your last fantasy about your crush, they would: Rate it G. Rate it PG-13. Rate it NC-17. Order you deported. 2) Mazel tov -- you just won round-trip tickets to anywhere on Earth! Where are you headed? Cancun. Bangladesh. The Virgin Islands. Down Under, if you know what I mean, and I think you do. 3) You're at a video arcade, and you find a dollar on the ground. You use it to: Play some wholesome air hockey. Fire up that ancient Death Race 2000 in the corner. Replace the top scorer's name on Galaga with a smutty word. Pay for a bus ride out of this heathen hellhole. 4) Pick a number from the list below: 482 3.14159265 24/7/365 69 5) Does your milkshake bring all the boys to the yard? Yes. No. I could tell you, but I'd have to charge. Huh? Frozen dairy products? I can't figure this one out. 6) What astronomical phenomenon would you most like to see out of your space station window? Halley's Comet. A cute cosmonaut. The sun rising over Uranus. A supernova exploding. 7) So, how many licks does it take to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop? Ah-one, ah-two, ah-three. *Heh.* You said "licks." Didn't I already answer this?? 69! Stop befouling a beloved childhood memory. Not So Fresh Not perfectly clean, but not incapable of being washed off, either. If you were a dinner plate, you'd be coated with the remnants of last night's fettuccine Alfredo. Nothing wrong with that -- just make sure you throw yourself in the dishwasher every once in a while.

 fabityfabfab49: 10 Things You Won't Hear a Man Say 1. Let's watch Lifetime! 2. Sex is overrated. 3. I don't want to go too far on the first date. 4. Yes, I did notice your sister's breasts are bigger than yours. 5. There is nothing I like better than crawling into bed with a good book. 6. I'm glad I don't have a large penis. 7. My hips are too big. 8. Aw, can't we watch Oprah? 9. Does this suit make me look fat? 10. I'll never get tired listening to Celine Dion.

 fabityfabfab49: An attractive blonde and a handsome man step into the same elevator. The blonde sighs happily and says 'TGIF', and is surprised when the man replies 'SHIT'. The blonde thinks perhaps he didn't hear her correctly, so she repeats it once again: 'TGIF!' and once again the man replies 'S H I T'. Finally, the blonde explains 'Sir, TGIF - Thank God it's Friday!' Stepping out of the elevator, the man smirks and says 'S H I T - Sorry honey, it's Thursday.'

 fabityfabfab49: A priest was driving along and saw a nun on the side of the road. He stopped and offered her a lift which she accepted. She got in and crossed her legs, forcing her gown to open and reveal a lovely leg. The priest had a look and nearly had an accident. After controlling the car, he stealthily slid his hand up her leg. The nun looked at him and immediately said, "Psalm 129." The priest apologized. "Sorry sister but the flesh is weak." Arriving at the convent, the nun got out gave him a meaningful glance and went on her way. On his arrival at the church, the priest rushed to retrieve a bible and looked up Psalm 129. It read, "Go forth and seek, further up, you will find glory."

 fabityfabfab49: A fart can be quiet, A fart can be loud, Some leave a powerful, Poisonous cloud. A fart can be short, Or a fart can be long, Some farts have been known, To sound just like a song. Some farts do not smell, While others are vile, A fart may pass quickly, Or linger awhile. A fart can create A most-curious medley, A fart can be harmless, Or silent, but deadly. A fart can occur In a number of places, And leave everyone With strange looks on their faces. From wide-open prairies, To small elevators, A fart will find all of us Sooner or later. So be not afraid Of the invisible gas, For always remember, That farts, too, shall pass.

 Little Joey was sitting in the back of class rubbing his crotch, and the teacher asked, “Joey what are you doing?” Joey replied, “Teacher, my mommy had me circumsized yesterday and it still hurts.” So the teacher sent Joey to the principal's office to call his mother and ask what he should do. When Joey came back from the office, the teacher noticed that he had his penis hanging out. Shocked, the teacher asked, “Joey, what are you doing!?” Joey answered, “Mommy told me to stick it out till lunch and then she would be here to pick me up.”

 urlLink urlLink Blonde - Detectives Three blondes were witnesses to a crime, so they went to the police station to identify the suspect. The police chief said he would show them a mug shot of someone for thirty seconds, then ask each one for a description. After showing the photo to the first blonde, he covered it, then asked her how she would recognize the suspect. ''Easy,'' she replied. ''He only has one eye.'' The chief was stunned. ''He only has one eye because it is a profile shot! Think about it!'' He repeated the procedure for the second blonde and again asked how she would recognize him. ''He only has one ear,'' was her answer. ''What is the matter with you people?!? It is a profile shot! You are seeing him from the side!'' He repeated the procedure for the third blonde, then said, ''How would you recognize the suspect? Now think before you give me a stupid answer.'' After viewing the photo, she thought for a minute, then said, ''He's wearing contact lenses.'' This took the chief by surprise. He looked real hard at the picture and couldn't tell if the suspect had contacts or not, so he went into the database and looked at the report. Sure enough, when the mug shot was taken, he was wearing contact lenses! He went back to her and asked, ''How could you tell he was wearing contact lenses? Nobody else here in this precinct saw that!'' ''Well,'' she said, ''he can't wear regular glasses with only one eye and one ear, now, can he?''

 A man and his wife are stranded on a desert island. The wife begins to lose interest in her husband and wishes on a star that she would find another man. The next day a man is washed on shore. He is very nice looking and finds immediate interest in the wife. The husband was very pleased that there was another man to help work. So they started on building a watchtower. The stranger and wife wanted to have mad passionate sex on the beach. So he tried to think of a plan. SO then the stranger offered to watch first from the watchtower. While the husband and wife worked, the stranger yelled, ''Hey! No fucking! Get back to work!'' At this, the couple yelled back, ''We're not fucking!'' A little while later the man again yelled out to them. And again the couple denied it. This happened several times during his shift up in the watchtower, and when his turn was over, the husband took over. With that, the stranger made love to the wife on the beach. The husband, watching, exclaimed, ''Wow, it really does look like they're fucking from up here!'''

 A sexy lady in a bar walks up to the counter and motions the bartender over. She starts to run her fingers through his hair and asks to speak to the manager. The bartender says, ''He isn't here but I can do anything the manger can do for you.'' By this time the lady is running her fingers down his face and into his mouth and is letting him suck on her fingers. She says, ''You're sure he isn't here?'' The bartender says, ''Yes, I'm very sure.'' The lady says, ''Well, I just wanted to tell him there's no toilet paper or soap in the women's restroom.''

 urlLink urlLink Little Johnny walks into a pharmacy and brings a box of tampons to the register. The cashier looks at the boy and says, "Hi. Are these for your mom?" Little Johnny thinks for a moment and says, "Umm, no." The cashier says, "Oh. Then they're for your sister?" Little Johnny says, "uh-unh." The cashier, now a bit curious, says, "Oh. Then they must be for your granny!" Little Johnny says, "Nope." The cashier is now really confused. Finally she asks, "Well, what are you going to do with them?" Little Johnny says, "Well, I'm not sure yet. But on TV, they said if I buy these I can go fishing and swimming and horseback riding!"

 n engineer dies and reports to the pearly gates. St. Peter checks his dossier and says, "Ah, you're an engineer -- you're in the wrong place." So, the engineer reports to the gates of hell and is let in. Pretty soon, the engineer gets dissatisfied with the level of comfort in hell, and starts designing and building improvements. After awhile, they've got air conditioning and flush toilets and escalators, and the engineer is a pretty popular guy. One day, God calls Satan up on the telephone and says with a sneer, "So, how's it going down there in hell?" Satan replies, "Hey, things are going great. We've got air conditioning and flush toilets and escalators, and there's no telling what this engineer is going to come up with next." God replies, "What??? You've got an engineer? That's a mistake -- he should never have gotten down there; send him up here." Satan says, "No way. I like having an engineer on the staff, and I'm keeping him." God says, "Send him back up here or I'll sue." Satan laughs uproariously and answers, "Yeah, right. And just where are YOU going to get a lawyer?"

 one day in school, a boy is told by a classmate that most adults are hiding at least one dark secret, and that this makes it very easy to blackmail them by saying, “I know the whole truth” -- even when you don't know anything. The boy decides to go home and try it out. As he is greeted by his mother at the front door he says, “I know the whole truth.” His mother quickly hands him $20 and says, “Just don't tell your father.” Quite pleased, the boy waits for his father to get home from work, and greets him with, “I know the whole truth.” The father promptly hands him $40 and says, “Please don't say a word to your mother.” Very pleased, the boy is on his way to school the next day, when he sees the mailman at his front door. The boy greets him by saying, “I know the whole truth.” The mailman drops the mail, opens his arms and says, “Then come give your FATHER a big hug.”

 A man was chosen for jury duty who very much wanted to be dismissed from serving. He tried every excuse he could think of but none of them worked. On the day of the trial he decided to give it one more shot. As the trial was about to begin he asked if he could approach the bench. "Your Honor," he said, " I must be excused from this trial because I am prejudiced against the defendant. I took one look at the man in the blue suit with those beady eyes and that dishonest face and I said 'He's a crook! He's guilty, guilty, guilty'. So your Honor, I could not possibly stay on this jury!" The judge replied, "Get back in the jury box. You are just the kind of juror we are looking for -- a good judge of character. That man is his lawyer."

 all this time you were pretending so much for my happy ending

 ok so today we had a family day. basically i woke up and my mom was yelling. so i cooked french toast...actually not so bad. and then as a family we cleaned the family room up. meir was straightening something and the toaster fell on his head ( we dont normally keep toasters in the family room. it was one for cooking clay ) and he was bleeding all over, sooo gross. then we went to see cinderella story and meir and abba went to see i robot. now our movie was really good except after movies like that ( love stories where the girl always gets the guy and lives happily ever after) make me feel so alone and left out and completely unloved, so it was good but sad for me. then since abba and meir werent done yet my mommy drove me hannah and tamara to target where hannah TRIED to fill out an application. soo many questions took over 15 minutes and the only way she got thru it was saying dani did it i can too... over and over again i made up my own question your co worker is crying. what do you do? a. go steal a box of tissues and comfort her/ him b. tell your supervisor c. ignore her/him d. shove her/him under your register e. start crying with them so people think its normal these were the type of questions they asked. i wanted to kill myself then we went to the mall and walked around . i got lost like 3 times, first in strawbridges, then in h and m and then in the mall. we went into kitchen kapers...best store, i played with all the fun stuff in there. i got a phone cover that smells like chocolate for a dollar, but doesnt fit. we were in models for the longest time and there were really cute guys in there so i was with them for a little while and then i got super bored so i called mel and got to talk to her mommy and then i went over to my mom and told her id kill myself if i didnt leave soon. the attendant guy thought i was nuts. so i left and wandered for a little while . and the really cute guys were in spencers but my mommy went into the leather store and god does that place smell so i didnt get to see them again. i should have gone up to them when i had the chance. but they were playing with the helmets and hockey sticks and skateboard so i kinda wanted to stay far far away. and besides guys kinda suck right now cause the one you like either doesnt like you back or doesnt talk to you at all...you know who you are....... then i went back and we left. but it was pouring and my skirt and sweatshirt was completely soaked. anyway the day was pretty good except for that stupid movie! ahhh now were watching little rascals. as a family while we make dinner. joy! ok so we ate dinner and we had salsbury steaks and my little sister was like davida what is this, so i pointed to five random ones and im like these are salsbury steaks the rest are hamburgers. so she ate one and then was still hungry so my abba said eat a salsbury steak and shes like no those are hamburgers. my family cracks up and my mom tells her i was lying and she said they are better when i lied. love her shes so cute so we caught the end of little rascals and i wouldnt let tamara change the channel until he said whoopee cause ive watched that movie fifty times and always missed it and its the best line of the whole movie. and only some of us and gila get that one. and now were watching hook. with pirates!! score

 life is a mixture of sunshine and rain, laughter and pleasure, tear drops and pain, so when clouds hide the sun, and your skies are all grey remember i am only a phone call away! :-D shevy always has the best away messages

 I've been travelin for some time (echo) With my fishin pole and my bottle of shine (echo) On these long dark dusty roads (echo) Lookin there's nowhere to go I guess I gotta hide away, far away Cause I gotta find a way, to find my way I gotta hide away, far away Cause I gotta find a way, to find my way Ay-ay-ay ay-ay-ay aaay I FOUND THE REAL WORDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

 On March 23, 1994, the medical examiner viewed the body of Ronald Opus and concluded that he died from a shotgun wound to the head. The decedent had jumped from the top of a ten-story building intending to commit suicide. He left a note to that effect indicating his despondency. As he fell past the ninth floor, his life was interrupted by a shotgun blast passing through a window, which killed him instantly. Neither the shooter nor the decedent was aware that a safety net had been installed just below at the eighth floor level to protect some building workers and that Ronald Opus would not have been able to complete his suicide the way he had planned. Ordinarily, Dr. Mills continued, "a person who sets out to commit suicide and ultimately succeeds, even though the mechanism might not be what he intended" is still defined as committing suicide. Mr. Opus was shot on the way to certain death nine stories below at street level, but his suicide attempt probably would not have been successful because of the safety net. This caused the medical examiner to feel that he had a homicide on his hands. The room on the ninth floor from whence the shotgun blast emanated was occupied by an elderly man and his wife. They were arguing vigorously, and he was threatening her with a shotgun. The man was so upset that when he pulled the trigger he completely missed his wife and the pellets went through the window striking Mr. Opus. When one intends to kill subject A, but kills subject B in the attempt, one is guilty of the murder of subject B. When confronted with the murder charge, the old man and his wife were both adamant. They both said they thought the shotgun was unloaded. The old man said it was his long standing habit to threaten his wife with the unloaded shotgun. He had no intention to murder her. Therefore the killing of Mr. Opus appeared to be an accident, that is, the gun had been accidentally loaded. The continuing investigation turned up a witness who saw the old couple's son loading the shotgun about six weeks prior to the fatal accident. It transpired that the old lady had cut off her son's financial support and the son, knowing the propensity of his father to use the shotgun threateningly, loaded the gun with the expectation that his father would shoot his mother. The case now becomes one of murder on the part of the son for the death of Ronald Opus. Now comes the exquisite twist. Further investigation revealed that the son was in fact Ronald Opus. He had become increasingly despondent over both the loss of his financial support and the failure of his attempt to engineer his mother's murder. This led him to jump off the ten-story building on March 23rd, only to be killed by a shotgun blast passing through the ninth-story window. The son had actually murdered himself, so the medical examiner closed the case as a suicide.

 How come we dont even talk no more And you dont even call no more We dont barely keep in touch at all And I dont even feel the same love when we hug no more And I heard it through the grape vine we even beefin now After all the years we been down Aint no way no how, this bullshit can be true We family and aint a damn thing changed, unless it's you this goes out ( ha love that ) to more then one person. i miss you

 so i woke up this morning at like 9 and looked at the clock and was like screw this why am i up this early i dont have to work today! so i turn on the tv to .....something and fall back asleep till ten , when i wake up and the house is super quiet. i get a little nervous so i walk around the house a little then decide to go take a bath. so im in the bath reading double fudge- cute but very fudgelike- and i hear a guys voice in my house. it sounded familiar so i just sat there. then i hear hannah singing some random song so i continue reading. ari was at my house. i get out find the biggest towel i could go to my room and sit on my bed and watch dawsons creek till like 1130 then hannah says i have to go to the library so i get dressed and she and ari and i go to pick up michelle. ari makes fun of me the entire way there...shmuck.... then we drop ari off at his house and me off at the library, where i search for almost 30 minutes trying to find books by isaac bashveis singer but since im an idiot and kept typing in isaac bashevis singer instead of singer, isaac bashevis, i couldnt find it. i eventually did and then went to the desk for the devil weasr prada and gossip girl which my stupid library didnt have. i call hannah to come pick me up she says shell be there soon so i sit and start to read this book...in her shoes... really good and really slutty and hannah comes a half hour and 2 more phone calls later. i walk up to the car and michelle gets out of the front seat i get a little confused and just open the back door she gets back into the car and was like ive been in so many 2 door cars lately force of habit, ya we made fun of her the ride home. so i was hungry and so i started to make mac and cheese and then i go down into the pantry to find....something.... and see chocolate pudding which i needed and cambells soup which i havent had since school. and i got really excited so i went upstairs to make it. I ACTUALLY PUT IN WATER AND THEN HEATED THE SOUP UP! all by myself!! how proud rachel? then i remembered i was making mac and cheese so i ate my soup finished making the mac and cheese and just left it there. my mom came home and threw a fit about the kitchen but i didnt do it. and hannah and mich invited me to watch a movie with them,. and i would cause i love hannah and mich is cute, but they are watching pirates of the caribean which reminds me of someone i really care about who major fight with- if you read this im sorry hun- and i had to watch a pirate movie last night when i was fighting with him. and i really like pirates so when it hurts to watch them life really sucks. and how does ashli know who i am? so i stayed in bed basically all day and finished my book...oh soooooo good! and we ate dinner. i made pudding for work tomorrow. were making dirt- the kind with pudding and crushed oreo cookies and gummy bears and since i wanted it to be kosher i had to make the pudding but we only had one box of chocolate pudding so i decided to make a box of vanilla pudding mix it with the chocolate pudding and add chocolate syrup. tastes fine but when i mixed it i completely forgot to keep the mixer in the bowl and pudding got all over. so fun!

 my weekend was good i got dressed after my shower friday night to go to shul- i go every friday night like a good girl- and i have hannahs shirt and skirt and my mommys shoes. hannahs shirt is too small in the boobs and my moms shoes are huge but they are soooooo pretty so i stuffed the toes with tissues. but she wouldnt let me wear them to shul cause it was all muddy so i put flip flops on not realizing if you walk in the mud in flip flops it kicks the mud onto your skirt. anyway...... i get to shul 15 minutes late- as usual- and i see the shul lights arent on and no one is in there. all the men are davening in the kiddush room. i didnt see a womens section so i just change my shoes, get a siddur and start davening in the lobby. by the time im finished mincha they have a women section ready. they took 6 chairs placed them in rows of two up against the wall and put a tallis rack up as a michitzah. whatever. we daven and get up to lcha dodi. worst tune i have ever heard! ever! so i go home and tell my abba that. the next morning he tells the rabbi who starts laughing and says thats the tune they had to use cause its so close to tisha bav... i felt sooo smart! friday night dinner was hysterical! all during kiddush we were giving tamara purple nurples and as soon as kiddush was over she run up to her room and came down five minutes later. she had huuuuuuuge boobs. we all start laughing and she looks my mom in the eyes and says " got socks? " oh god! she looked hysterical. i said- is that why you never have any socks?- .....we had a fun meal and i got out of walking the dog with hannah cause michelle was there. i made myself read 100 pages of isaac bashevis singer for school and then read good books and went to sleep. i woke up the next morning read the newspaper got dressed and had lunch. then i read my ym...ashlee simpson is soooooooo hot! more isaac bashevis singer and then read barbara delinsky- more then friends- such a good book. then i slept a little , said havdalah . i worked on mels birthday present some more. and then watched animal house with my abba...... FUNNIEST MOVIE EVER!!!! really i sat there laughing the whole movie and then couldnt stop for a half hour later. you need to go see this movie!! then i steal pirates of the caribean from hannah and watch the bloopers and deleted scenes. then i watch about 5 minutes of the actual movie before i fell asleep. today- i woke up around 1130. said modeh ani washed negel vassar and watched more pirates of the caribean. then i make breakfast eat and get my mom to take me to kohls and target. there were soooo many people at target! all in the school supply section. my mom bought 15 packs of markers glue and rulers. then 30 notebooks 15 watercolors........sooooooo much stuff! then at kohls i got a new sports bag cause meir ruined mine. its yellow and so pretty. they had a pink one but it was too small. then we picked hannah up and went to bjs, where i got completely lost!! it was sooooo scary. we bought tamara a flute and this lady thought i was 18. cause we walked by her desk and she had bj bags and i said i want one! and she said sign up for the card...blah blah blah. i said i couldnt cause im just a little girl and shes like your not 18. i said no im 14. she started laughing and didnt believe me! then we picked up meir tamara and my abba and went out to eat in the northeast at espresso cafe and sushi bar- horrible food but hannah saw jason and ari waks was there. and he didnt look so hot. he got really long sideburns but my brother the asshole goes up to him and says davida likes you... i hate little brothers. and then we got ritas cause i didnt eat anything at the resturant...muy bad. and now the whole family- besides for me is watching finding nemo jens getting her phone tomorrow!! and i got two letters from her!

 all stolen from shevys blog shev4ev.blogspot.com Davida had a really cool blog, so now I'm gonna have one too!!

 my day was blah i woke up watched finding nemo, got dressed and went to the orthodontist. we were early so we went into bed bath and beyond and then to the ortho appointment. i got taken in early so i was done before my appointment was origially scedueled. so i make hannah come pick me up and when she does benyamin is in the car. he was at my house writing the shtick. then we go to pick gershon up and hannah went inside and i was bored so i pulled out my tooth. and then we went home and wrote the shtick- i get to be me in it so im kinda excited. then i ate pasta and made hannah take me shopping for a straightner. turns out they only need 8 inches for locks of love so im getting it cut. itll probably be up to my shoulders. really excited. and as i straightned my hair i watched teenage drama queen. it wasnt as good as i thought it was going to be. little dissapointed and then we ate dinner and i had ice cream i really like ice cream. then the stupid fast started and morrison called me and i was on the phone with her for two hours- which is really really long for me but i love her!!!! and i cant watch tv or shower or listen to music or anything.......so screwed and i called jen but she was on her way to eicha so shes call me back later. yay for me!

 Rachel: Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay. (Goes and grabs a bag, that looks like a purse, and shows it to Joey.) Joey: Really? A purse? Rachel: It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag. Joey: It looks like a women's purse. Rachel: No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look. (Shows him.) See look, men , carrying the bag. Joey: See look, women , carrying the bag. (He puts it on his shoulder and looks at himself in the mirror and likes what he sees.) But it is odd how a women's purse looks good on me, a man. Rachel: Exactly! Unisex! Joey: Maybe you need sex. I had sex a couple days ago. Rachel: No! No Joey! U-N-I-sex. Joey: Well, I ain't gonna say no to that. hahah such a funny episode

 Jumper991: im gonna tell you a story LethaLithuanian: yay! Jumper991: ok so once upon a time there was a pretty pretty princess Jumper991: her name was hannah Jumper991: she had a best friend name jon but everyone called him jon the moron cause mean hannah casted a spelled on him Jumper991: so everyday mean hannah would make jon the moron juggle and do magic tricks for her Jumper991: and then she would throw tomatoes at him Jumper991: jon led a very sad life Jumper991: but one as he was skinny dipping- naked- wow thats redundant Jumper991: a very cute maiden happened to pass by Jumper991: and she said" jon " Jumper991: and jon doesnt answer Jumper991: so she says jon again Jumper991: he still doesnt answer Jumper991: she gets closer and says jon again Jumper991: he doesnt answer Jumper991: she progressively gets closer Jumper991: and then whispers in his ear jon Jumper991: and he jumps Jumper991: and hes naked!!! Jumper991: he sees this maiden and gets very embaressed Jumper991: the maiden can see hes upset so she turns away and waits for him to get dressed LethaLithuanian: sounds good LethaLithuanian: except i dont have anythign to be embarrased about Jumper991: this is my story silly! Jumper991: you are naked in front of a cute maiden Jumper991: you are embaressed! LethaLithuanian: ok! Jumper991: goo Jumper991: so back to where i was before i was sooooo rudely interrupted Jumper991: when jon is finally dressed he goes over and takes the maidens hand and leds her to go sit down Jumper991: they sit down and talk and the maiden asks why he didnt answer when she called his name Jumper991: and jon said " i was thinking of my dream last night. it was ever so enchanting. i met a girl and she loved me for me. and didnt care i was jon the moron . cause she knew inside i wasnt a moron." Jumper991: now this maiden knew of the horrible cruelty of princess hannah Jumper991: so she leaned over and gave jon a hug Jumper991: then she said meet me here again tomorrow LethaLithuanian: NICE! Jumper991: and went off into the scary forest LethaLithuanian: aww LethaLithuanian: no good bye hug? Jumper991: shhhh!!! Jumper991: jon was so amazed at what had just transpired he just sat there transfixed Jumper991: meanwhile the maiden is running thru the forest continualy looking at her watch im late im late for a very important date Jumper991: then all of a sudden the trees start throwing apples at her Jumper991: poor maiden is bruised and she cries as she runs Jumper991: but she doesnt stop running Jumper991: finally she gets to princess hannahs castle Jumper991: where she takes off her clock Jumper991: cloke Jumper991: no Jumper991: cloak Jumper991: right? Jumper991: and goes into the pantry and gets the mop. she ties up her long gorgoes red hair and gets to work because she too was under princess hannahs spell LethaLithuanian: evil hannah Jumper991: as soon as the maiden finishes mopping the floor until its shining Jumper991: evil hannah storms in... mud all over her shoes. she has michelle- her lover and josh- her fictious boyfriend with her Jumper991: they are all laughing at what a fool jon the moron was Jumper991: princess hannah was cackling over wat a good job she did Jumper991: then she stops right in front of the maiden and says what is that smell LethaLithuanian: BITCH! Jumper991: you smell of water Jumper991: the maiden laughs and says what do you think i cleaned the floor with witch Jumper991: and hannah turns around and then slowly faces the maiden Jumper991: well.....the floor doesnt look very clean does it? i can see muddy footprints all over Jumper991: then she kicks the bucket of dirty water at the poor maiden Jumper991: spit on her hair and walks out LethaLithuanian: i thought this was a story for ME Jumper991: im having fun! Jumper991: fine no mas story LethaLithuanian: no!! Jumper991: i just said id tell you a story LethaLithuanian: keep going!! Jumper991: didnt say what it was about Jumper991: fine! Jumper991: the maiden almost starts to cry and then realizes she cant let the bitch win so she stands up gets new water and starts dancing around with the mop until the floor is sparkling again. Jumper991: because one of the reasons princess hannah help such contempt for the maiden was because she could dance Jumper991: verrrrry well LethaLithuanian: good for her Jumper991: the maiden finished mopping cooked hannah and her entourage dinner served it and cleaned it up and then washed the windows Jumper991: finally at around 2 am she went to sleep only to be woken up at 5 to bathe hannah and make her beautiful Jumper991: we all know how much work that takes LethaLithuanian: ha!!! Jumper991: and then it was time for jon the moron to act again LethaLithuanian: oh man Jumper991: instead of his normal production he decides to tell jokes LethaLithuanian: rescue me maiden!! Jumper991: shhh! Jumper991: he starts off with : A man is lying in a hospital bed with an oxygen mask over his mouth. A young nurse enters his room to sponge his face and hands. "Nurse," he mumbles from behind the mask, "Are my testicles black?" Embarrassed, the young nurse replies, "I don't know Mr. Jones, I'm only here to wash your face and hands." He struggles again to ask, "Nurse, are my testicles black?" Again the nurse replies, "I can't tell. I'm only here to wash your face and hands." The head nurse walks by and sees the man getting a little distraught, so she marches over to find out what's wrong. "Nurse," he mumbles, "are my testicles black?" The head nurse whips back the sheets, pulls down the man's pajamas, moves his penis out of the way, has a good look, pulls up the pajamas and says, "There's nothing wrong with them." Frustrated at this, the man pulls off his oxygen mask and asks again, "I said, are my test results back?!" Jumper991: but no one is laughing Jumper991: so he coughs nervously and says: Becky was on her death bed with her husband, John, maintaining a steady vigil by her side. As he held her fragile hand, his warm tears ran silently down his face, splashed onto her face, and roused her from her slumber. She looked up and her pale lips began to move slightly. "My darling John," she whispered. "Hush, my love," he said. "Go back to sleep. Shhh. Don't talk." But she was insistent. "John," she said in her tired voice. "I have to talk. I have something I must confess to you." "There's nothing to confess," replied the weeping John. "It's all right. Everything's all right, go to sleep now." "No, no. I must die in peace, John. I slept with your brother, your best friend and your father." John mustered a pained smile and stroked her hand. "Hush now Becky, don't torment yourself. I know all about it." he said, "Why do you think I poisoned you?" Jumper991: jon the moron switches tactics and goes to ..... How many animals can you fit in a pair of pantyhose? Jumper991: 10 little piggies, one ass, two calves, one pussy, and some crabs on hares. Jumper991: but no one is laughing Jumper991: jon is getting very very anxious Jumper991: he glances at princess hannah who looks monster pissed Jumper991: he immediatly pulls out his balls Jumper991: hahahahahhaahahaha LethaLithuanian: whoa Jumper991: sorry Jumper991: and starts juggling Jumper991: but now its too late Jumper991: hannah screams off with his head!!!! Jumper991: but instead of chopping off his head they throw watermelons at him Jumper991: and watermelons hurt Jumper991: so jon is running to get away LethaLithuanian: im tough Jumper991: not when you have watermelons being thrown at you! Jumper991: and he stumbles on a watermelon and gets hit with three more LethaLithuanian: yea i am Jumper991: ahh Jumper991: ouch! Jumper991: oh no LethaLithuanian: ok Jumper991: the pain the pain!!! LethaLithuanian: i think im gonna take over LethaLithuanian: jon catches a watermelon Jumper991: but you dont know how its supposed to end Jumper991: joooooon! LethaLithuanian: crushes it in 1/2 with one hand LethaLithuanian: and takes the bigger 1/2 LethaLithuanian: and dumps it on davida's head so sh ecant tell anymore of the story LethaLithuanian: unless she wants to change it Jumper991: no now im not telling you anymore Jumper991: and it was soooooo good Jumper991: now im going to bed LethaLithuanian: no Jumper991: yes LethaLithuanian: otherwise img onan b mad at u Jumper991: what! Jumper991: the ending was that jon the moron and the maiden fall in love and when the kiss the broke the spell and jon became the handsome prince and shocked princess hannah into dumping her lesbian lover and her " boyfriend" only to be turned down for her maiden who when the handsome jon said he loved her she turned into the most beautiful princess and stupid hannah became the maid Jumper991: but because you are RUDE you didnt get to hear that part LethaLithuanian: oh LethaLithuanian: man LethaLithuanian: i suck Jumper991: ya LethaLithuanian: im sorry LethaLithuanian: :'( LethaLithuanian: forgive me?

 my day was exhausting its a fast and i couldnt go to sleep last night cause i always watch tv or listen to music until i fall asleep and i cant cause of tisha bav . so i wake up when my alarm goes off get dressed and procrastinate for 45 minutes cause i didnt have to make lunch shower or eat breakfast. stupid clock. then we go to work i make copies and the little kids start coming. i love jessica she is sooo cute. so they play for a little while and then cause it was raining we take them into the multi purpose room and they play with the balls and bowling and the parachute. then we take them back inside and they paint and have snack and i have to pour the juice give out snack and i cant eat it. damn fast days! then i take the kids out, by myself, and judi keeps a couple to paint more. so were outside on the yellow playground and as we get there the really cute guy went inside. aww boo! but while we were there the 3 year olds came out, and they are sooooo sweet and they wanted to go on the monkey bars over and over again. then they decided there are aliens and monsters and we have to run away from them on the wet soggy ground and i have to carry each kid on my back. silly me ended up twisting my ankle and breaking my shoe so i was running on the wood chips barefoot. not hot. then we go inside and the kids color. really it takes so long to make the kids color my god! and i cut out the really intriquite little stars and then get all their lunches ready. i hate bologna and it smelled sooooo good today. and jessica saw i forgot my lunch and she kept offering me her goldfish, muy cute. hannah comes picks me up and we go home and i immediatly go lie down and watch tv and fall asleep till like 5:30 and i completely miss the ncsy meeting thing which i was told wasnt going to be a real meeting just watching the beverly hillbillies but nooo they actually had a meeting. so after i wake up i ignore calls from everyone and just sit and watch tv and put my hair up in a pony which looks really pretty cause my hair is really long and straight now. then i tried to draw the design for our sweatshirts this year. if anyone can draw really good hillbillies tell me! and my mommy is having an art class and its sooooo loud. not in the best mood, damn fast! but i get to go shopping and hair cutting tomorrow.and jen has her phone!!! and then i watched sex and the city and friends and ate dinner and now that hannahs back im having ice cream! i love ice cream

 will: i could switch tactics and talk to like a true gay guy.... ironically that would be fruitless &nbsp; i love will and grace

 my day was........... bittersweet it was the last day of camp, and my mommy couldnt drive me cause she had to take hannah to register for public school so i was supposed to get a ride with megan but i slept too late and she had already left by the time i got there. so i stupidly decide to bike to work, over a half hour away in the car and on some major highways and roads. i dont have my own bike so i take meirs and put leggings on under my really cute mini skirt and sneakers. i start biking on rt 38 im on the left side, with no bike path flipping out cause the cars are freaking speeding past me and then i hear like beep beep beep behind me and my mom is pulling me over. shes freaking out cause im on the wrong side of the road and i could have died- she drives me to work and im there really early. again. i set up the classroom its all good. and i get a pretty watch and two gift certificates to the moorestown mall and 20$ from judi- i had a really good time working with her this summer, shes fun! we play and then go down to arlenes room and i love the kids there. me jake and nickolas....best friends! they tell me im beautiful(( yes im a sucker for compliments )) and then when were outside on the bikes i sat down and all of a sudden there were like 8 little kids surrounding me all asking me different things. maya is the cutest thing... ah im gonna miss them all so much! and then hannah comes and picks me up and we go to this weird school - that should only have been like 20 minutes away but it took us 45 minutes cause hannah sucks. she gets registered and i go get a hair cut. while im there this girl calls the stylist and tells her to keep her peeps off her man ..... really such little kid stuff it was hysterical. she did a crappy job on my hair, i came home and fixed some of it. and its really really really short!

 If Parrots Could Talk A lady was looking for a present for her husband Harry, the pirate. She went to the only pet shop in town to buy one. The pet shop owner refused to sell her the one parrot he had. "You don't want this one, it has lived in a brothel all its life." "Yes, I must have it", said the pirate's wife." Harry has wanted a parrot all his life, and this is a beautiful bird!" "Thanks, gorgeous," said the parrot, and he was soon taken to the lady's house. She put him into the corner, covered him up, and waited until the party that night to show her husband his gift. When she uncovered the parrot, her husband was amazed. Then the parrot said. "Nice house, better broads; oh, Hi, Harry!" DON'T TALK TO THE PARROT One morning, Mrs. James woke up and her dishwasher wasn't working. She called a repairman and he said that he would be able to come out and service the dishwasher that afternoon. Since Mrs. James worked during the day, she said, "You can come out this afternoon but I won't be at home. I'll leave a key under the back door mat, you fix the dishwasher and leave me a bill. I'll mail you a check tomorrow. I need to tell you, though, that I have a Pit Bull. He's a gentle dog so don't worry about him. I also have a parrot. He's not so nice, so whatever you do, DON'T TALK TO THE PARROT!!" Later that day, the repairman let himself into Mrs. James house and sure enough, there was her Pit Bull. He was a gentle dog . . he just lay on the rug and watched the repairman do his work. The parrot, however, was another story. He screamed, and squawked, and lunged at the repairman the entire time he was in the house. Finally the repairman couldn't take the bird's screaming any longer and he yelled, "SHUT UP YOU STUPID BIRD." At that, the parrot looked at the Pit Bull and said "Sic 'em, Brutus."

Bi-Lingual So this guy goes into a pet store and sees a beautiful parrot but it has a blue string handing from one foot and a red one from the other. He thinks this is a little strange so he asks the shopkeeper what the strings are for. "Well this is a highly trained parrot" the shopkeeper replies. "If you pull the red string he talks in French, if you pull the blue string he talks in English". "Wow" exclaims the man shopping that's really neat "What happens if you pull them both at the same time?" "I fall off my perch you idiot!" exclaims the parrot. Fowl Language A young man named John received a parrot as a gift. The parrot had a bad attitude and an even worse vocabulary. Every word out of this bird's mouth was rude, obnoxious and laced with profanity. John tried and tried to change the bird's attitude by constantly saying polite words, playing soft music, and anything he could think of to set a good example. Nothing worked. Finally, John got fed up and he yelled at the parrot. And, the bird yelled back. John shook the parrot, and the bird got angrier and ruder. Finally, in a moment of desperation, John put the bird in the refrigerator freezer. For a few minutes, John heard the bird squawk and kick and scream...then suddenly there was quiet. Not a peep for over a minute. Fearing that he'd hurt the bird, John quickly opened the door to the freezer. The parrot calmly stepped out onto John's out-stretched arm and said, "I believe I may have offended you with my rude language and actions. I am truly sorry, and I will do everything to correct my poor behavior." John was astonished at the bird's change of attitude. As he was about to ask the parrot what had made such a dramatic change in his behavior, the bird continued, "May I ask what the chicken did?" Long ago li ved a seaman named Captain Bravo. He was a manly man's man who showed no fear in facing his enemies. One day, while sailing the seven seas, a lookout spotted a pirate ship and the crew became frantic. Captain Bravo bellowed, "Bring me my red shirt." The First Mate quickly retrieved the captain's red shirt and while wearing the bright frock he led his mates into battle and defeated the pirates. Later on, the lookout spotted not one, but two pirate ships. The captain again howled for his red shirt and once again they vanquished the pirates. That evening, all the men sat around on the deck recounting the day's triumphs and one of the them asked the captain: "Sir, why did you call for your red shirt before battle?" The captain replied: "If I am wounded in the attack, the shirt will not show my blood, and thus, you men will continue to resist, unafraid." All of the men sat in silence and marveled at the courage of such a man's manly man. As dawn came the next morning, the lookout spotted not one, not two, but TEN pirate ships approaching. The rank and file all stared in worshipful silence at the captain and waited for his usual reply. Captain Bravo gazed with steely eyes upon the vast armada arrayed against his mighty sailing ship and, without fear, turned, and calmly shouted: "Get me my brown pants." A burglar broke into a house one night. He shone his flashlight around, looking for valuables, and when he picked up a CD player to place into his sack, a strange, disembodied voice echoed from the dark saying, "Jesus is watching you." He nearly jumped out of his skin, clicked his flashlight off and froze. When he heard nothing more after a bit, he shook his head, promised himself a long vacation after his next big score, then clicked the flashlight back on and began searching for more valuables. Just as he pulled the stereo out so that he could disconnect the wires, clear as a bell he heard, "Jesus is watching you." Totally rattled, he shone his flashlight around frantically, looking for the source of the voice. Finally, in the corner of the room, his flashlight beam came to rest on a parrot. "Did you say that"? He hissed at the parrot "Yes," the parrot confessed, then squawked, "I'm just trying to warn you. " The burglar relaxed. "Warn me, huh? Who do you think you are anyway?" "Moses," replied the parrot. "Moses," the burglar laughed. "What kind of people would name a parrot "Moses?" The parrot quickly answered, "The same kind of people that would name a Rottweiler Jesus." A magician worked on a cruise ship in the Caribbean. The audience was different each week, so the magician allowed himself to do the same tricks over and over again. There was only one problem: the captain's parrot saw the shows each week and began to understand how the magician did every trick. Once he understood, he started shouting in middle of the show: "Look, it's not the same hat!" "Look, he's hiding the flowers under the table." "Hey, why are all the cards the Ace of Spades?" The magician was furious but couldn't do anything. It was, after all, the captain's parrot. One day the ship had an accident and sank. The magician found himself on a piece of wood in the middle of the sea with, as fate would have it, the parrot. They stared at each other with hatred but did not utter a word. This went on for a day and then another. On the third day, the parrot could not hold back: "OK, I give up. Where's the boat?

I cant believe all the good things that you do for me Sit back in the chair like a princess from a far away place Nobodys nice when you hold her your heart turns twice Shut out what they say their too dumb to need it anyway When we were kids, we hated things our sisters did Backyard summer pools and Christmases were beautiful And the sentiment of colored mirrored ornaments And the open drapes looked out on frozen farmhouse landscapes Have you forgotten how to love yourself?

 Monica: Ross, you've got to do something about the humping. Ross: What? It's, it's just a phase. Chandler: Well, that's what we said about Joey... Ross: Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal. Rachel: [Out of shot] Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey! Ross: What? Rachel: Let's just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious. Chandler: How about Joey... Pepponi? Joey: No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral. Chandler: Joey... Switzerland? [The waitress brings their coffee] Joey: Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big. [Waitress looks at him funny] Which I'm not. Chandler: Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin? Joey: Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar. Chandler: Well, it does not ring a bell with me... Joey: [Writes it down] Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good. Chandler: Might wanna try Joseph. [Joey visibly thinks 'Of course!' and writes it down] Joey: Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that! Chandler: Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof. Ross: She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity. Joey: [To Chandler] Hey! He beat ya. Joey: I dunno what to say, Ross. Uh, it's a monkey. Ross: Just, just say what you feel. Joey: Marcel, I'm hungry. Ross: That was good. ROSS: Man, I sure miss Julie. CHANDLER: Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how you got there. (phone rings) ROSS: You ever figure out what that thing's for? CHANDLER: No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if I'm always answering the phone, people'll think I don't have a life. My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned. (MACHINE--JOEY'S VOICE): Here comes the beep, you know what to do. JADE: Hello, I'm looking for Bob. This is Jane. I don't know if you're still at this number, but I was just thinking about us, and how great it was, and, well, I know it's been three years, but, I was kinda hoping we could hook up again. I barely had t he nerve to make this call, so you know what I did? CHANDLER: What? JADE: I got a little drunk...and naked. CHANDLER: Bob here. CHANDLER: (on phone) What've you been up to? JADE: Oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying way too much. Oh, and in case you were wondering, those are my legs on the new James Bond poster. CHANDLER: Can you hold on a moment? I have another call. (to Ross) I love her. ROSS: I know. CHANDLER: I'm back. JADE: So, are we gonna get together or what? CHANDLER: Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish? JADE: Great, I'll see you then. CHANDLER: Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off. ROSS: Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, "hey, you're not Bob." CHANDLER: I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table. ROSS: Oh my god. You are pure evil. CHANDLER: Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I've done this. MONICA: I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti. All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office. It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job. JOEY: If it's not you, this is a horrible story PHOEBE: No, huh uh, no way, I'm sorry, not gonna happen. CHANDLER: Whoa, whoa, prom night flashback. PHOEBE: Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff. CHANDLER: Why did you look at me when you said that? CHANDLER: Yeah. Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today. ROSS: Whoa! You had sex today? CHANDLER: Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome, ok? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming. ROSS: Wow. CHANDLER: Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign. (phone rings) ROSS: Still doing the screening thing? CHANDLER: I had sex today. I never have to answer that phone again. MACHINE: Here comes the beep, you know what to do. JADE: Hey, Bob, it's Jade. Listen, I just wanted to tell you that I was really hurt when you didn't show up the other day, and just so you know, I ended up meeting a guy. CHANDLER: Bob here. JADE: Oh, hi. CHANDLER: So, uh, you met someone, huh? JADE: Yes, yes, I did. In fact, I had sex with him 2 hours ago. CHANDLER: So, uh, how was he? JADE: Eh. CHANDLER: Eh? JADE: Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name. CHANDLER: Well, that makes me feel so good. JADE: It was just so awkward and bumpy. ROSS: (silently mouthing) Bumpy? CHANDLER: Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it. JADE: Well there really wasn't much time to get used to it, you know what I mean? RACHEL: Who gave you that hickey? MONICA: That would be the work of a Blowfish. RACHEL: Oh! PHOEBE: Oh! I can't believe it. I can't believe this. We're just like, sitting at home, trying to guess Joey's fingers, and you guys are out like partying and having fun, and you know, all, "hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck". . CHANDLER: [singing to the tune of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood] Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor. JOEY: Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever. MONICA: [entering] All right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts. RACHEL: Oh god. I think I'm gonna be sick. MONICA: Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them. MRS GREEN: This is so much fun, just the girls. You know what we should do? Does anybody have any marijuana? RACHEL: God! MONICA: All right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food. MRS GREEN: That's fine. I never did it. I just thought I might. So, what's new in sex? RACHEL: Oh! What's new in sex? MRS GREEN: The only man I've ever been with is your father. MONICA: I'm dicing, I'm dicing, I don't hear anything. MRS GREEN: I mean, this is no offense to your dad, sweetie, but I was thinking there might be more. RACHEL: Oh, I'm sorry. You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you. I mean, god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell Daddy. What? What do you want? Do you want my blessing? MRS GREEN: No. RACHEL: You want me to talk you out of it? MRS GREEN: No. RACHEL: Then what? What do you want? MRS GREEN: I guess I just figured of all people you would understand this. RACHEL: Why on earth would I understand this? MRS GREEN: You didn't marry your Barry. I did. RACHEL: Oh. MONICA: All right people, we're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move, move, move! CHANDLER: Monica, I feel like you should have German subtitles. MONICA: Joey, speed it up! JOEY: I'm sorry, it's the pigs. they're reluctant to get in the blankets! PHOEBE: Monica, how did this happen? I thought you had this all planned out. MONICA: Do you want me to cry? Is that what you want? Do you wanna see me cry? PHOEBE: Sir! No sir! MONICA: [to Ross] All right, you! ROSS: No. Look, I told you I am not a part of this thing. MONICA: All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do. But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called "pigs in Ross". All right, ball the melon. CHANDLER: Hey! How come I'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon. JOEY: It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly. CHANDLER: Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding. CHANDLER: [to the woman who just rejected him] All right look. Penis schmenis. We're all people. [She walks away again.] heeheeehee.........waay too much time on my hands
