 CULT OF JEF UPDATE I have mapped out the flowchart of the new improved Cult of Jef with lemon-fresh borax, but it's going to take me some time to build the new site. I'm actually going to HAND CODE the site. I know what you're saying, "Jef this is madness! This time you have gone TOO FAR, SONNY!" However, I think you'll be pleased with the new site. Just bear with me and I'm planning to have it done in a few weeks.

 RECONSIDERING YOKO ONO OR LOVE AND THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD I went over to Troy's urlLink Sometimes Happy blog for my daily dose of happiness. He had a quote from Yoko Ono. Now, I personally find Yoko to be a bit obscure for my taste, but I generally find that if Troy posts it on his blog it will have some relevance and value. Ms. Ono was giving a quote about the Consitutional amendment to ban gay marriage and she said the following: "I find it strange that there should be so much controversy about this issue in a modern society. In these turbulent times, how wonderful it is for anyone, regardless of sexual orientation or gender, to find love. We should embrace, share, celebrate, and validate that love. Every man has a man who loves him! Every woman has a woman who loves her!" What a wonderful sentiment and outlook! Personally, I find this quote to be the most succinct and eloquent statement about the whole issue so far. It sort of cuts to the chase and reminds people that we live in a time where there are a lot of other more pressing issues that need to be addressed and isn't the miracle of love a wonderful and beautiful thing... no matter who it occurs betweeen? This begs the question, do we really understand what love is? Can scientists reproduce it in a laboratory environment? Can love and the scientific method coexist in perfect harmony? I'd say no. Oh yes, sometimes we can predict it like the weather, but how often have we also said there would be snow and rain and found ourselves inundated with sunshine? Two people see each other. Their eyes meet, the pulse quickens and they look away from each other. They become fascinated with one another and have to know everything about that person. What were they like in the first grade? What does she think about euthanasia? Does he foxtrot? It's all so intoxicating! No, I think you can make a list of the qualities you want in a potential partner so that you can avoid the people who are unhealthy for you. You can meet someone who has the qualities of that list, but there still has to be that myseterious, spiritual, chemical reaction that ignites between two people and causes the beaker to fizz over.

 WHEN JOAN CALLS... Jeff: Did someone come by today that you want to tell me about? Jef: No. Jeff: Someone who might have left me a piece of paper. Jef: Well, if you're hinting at the exterminator, I don't necessarily want to tell you about it. He rang the doorbell and handed me the bill. I figured you would know what it was for if I put it in your special mail spot (Dining room table). Jeff: By the way, Joan called. So I called Joan. She doesn't answer her telephone anymore because she is being stalked by telemarketers who breathe heavy. I left a message and she called me back. We talked for two hours. I don't know why. I had things to do, but we talked for two hours. She confessed that she always thought that I would have enjoyed Justin Timberlake's Justified album. She has already slipped over to the Dark Side. I"ve never heard it. I told him that I heard that the JC Chasez album had gotten better reviews. She pronounced his name and it sounded like a Gospell drag queen. I told her that I was getting e-mails from the Kylie Minogue Mailing List again. They had stopped for about a year. There are many people who are relieved that has pulled out of VH1's Divas Las Vegas show. Joan heard that Posh and Becks are breaking up because he has been diddling another ho. I told her that was whack! I've always been fascinated with the obession of the public with those two. We discussed the fact that Scary Spice is performing in Rent on Broadway and Baby Spice has been the most successful of all the Spice Girls. I mentioned that Brits and Aussies use the word "whilst" a lot and we Americans don't. I decided to use the word "whilst" whilst i blog each day. We discussed some personal things about her sister, Marti, but I can't say anything about Marti getting her unmentionables pierced yet. She will announce it on the Ramblings of a Redhead site soon. We discussed her nephew, Eric, turning 22. No one seems to know how he celebrated it. I said that was whack! We reviewed the list of the top ten celebrity meltdowns on MSN.com. We laughed at the comments from Mariah Carey, but my favorite meltdown was Whitney Houston. She's whack! I commented on how I think it's funny when people blog about their significant other and refer to him/her as baby as a term of endearment. It seems more natural when people say it than when you read it. When you're reading along and you see "baby" it just stands out and everyone slows down. Imagine if you were driving down the highway and everyone slows down because there is this big "baby" in the middle of the road that everyone has to get off the highway and drive around. That's what it's like. I don't like to be called baby. At this point, we both decided it was way too late and we were suffering from sleep deprivation. I told her to go to Sometimes Happy to see the picture of the orca penis. It's long and tendrilly like an octopus. I don't care if it needs cleaning, I don't watn to touch it. That's whack!

 POLITICAL CARTOON My friend, Marcia, sent me an e-mail in response to my post, Post Mortem Of Senate Resolution 595. "There was a good cartoon in todays paper, where the courts are restoring marriage to its traditional definition: man and property. It made me laugh, but disturbed me at the same time. It was like intellectual sweet & sour chicken.

 OVER MY DEAD BODY! Interstate 75 and Interstate 85 merge into one highway as they go through downtown Atlanta. They are both closed this morning because authorities found a body on the Interstate. (Is dead body redundant? You never imply that someone has a sexy dead body. I'll have to genuflect on this.) I imagine this body in the middle of the highway with a boundry of chalk surrounding it. Yellow crime tape stretches from one side of the highway to the other. Detectives in rain coats and fedoras stand around looking pensive while eating donuts. Japanese tourists wander up from somewhere and smile as the fingerprint brush guy takes their picture in front of the body. What if they picked it up and began posing with it? That's horrible! The other image that comes to mind is that it is a really big body laying across the freeway and preventing traffic from passing. However, since I do not know any 40-foot people, this is most likely impossible. Oh well, back to work. Sometimes it's nice to work from home.

 GREEK ORTHODOX GOOD FRIDAY SERVICE Okay, so Jeff asks me if I'd like to go to a Good Friday service at a Greek Orthodox church. It seems he has been chomping at the bit to visit this church for a while. As luck would have it, our friend Ryan attends a Greek Orthodox church and invited us to the Good Friday service. So we went. Ryan met us there. We lit a white taper candle and stuck it in a sandbox near the door of the sanctuary. I'm not sure why. I simply followed the herd. Please note that I am simply reporting what I experienced. Ryan was sitting on the other side of Jeff so I didn't always hear the explanation of everything. The church itself was one of the most beautiful churches that I have ever been in. There were murals of different scenes of Jesus' life on all the walls. Everyone had that heavy-eyelid look that was popular in Byzantinian art. [Yes, I received an "A" in Art History 101.] Jesus looked like Max Von Sydow. Max played Ming the Merciles in urlLink Flash Gordon . Every time I looked up at the murals during the service, I would look at Jesus and hear "Flash! Ah-ahhhh. Savior of the universe!" It was very distracting. I've noticed that there are many images of Jesus and the disciples looking very happy. They always look so solemn. It doesn't seem like very good marketing for a missionary selling the Good News . Of course, I suppose Jesus knew what was coming and I could understand seeming a bit non-plussed by that. It makes you wonder exactly when Jesus knew in his life what his final moments on earth would be like. Did he know from the time he was born or just before he returned to Jerusalem? There were six doors that separated the front area from an altar. A different Biblical figure was on each door. It sort of gave the impression that if you put 75cents into the coin slot, the door would open and you would receive a saint. In actuality, only the far door on either end was truly functional. Above these doors were images of the faces of Saints. It reminded me of an add for a movie where is shows all the movie stars making cameos in a light comedy. It was just another reminder what a strange little world I live in. I view everything through pop culture glasses. My favorite image was of the Madonna with child. Her arms were at either side as if she was saying, "Ta-duh!" The baby Jesus stood on her lap looking more like a very small adult who was washed in very hot water and shrunk. His hand was in the air and his fingers seemed to be forming the peace sign, which of course made me hear Richard Nixon saying, "I've never been a quitter." It was a very ornamental church. There were lots of icons as would be expected. The service was conducted in Greek with some sections in English. The liturgy was chanted in a very melodic fashion so it was very soothing to listen to. We sat at times and then stood. At one point, Ryan pulled out the kneeling tray without warning and almost amputated my foot, but I'm okay. The hardest part for me was the incense smoker. My nose is so hyper-sensitive to smoke now that there so few places that smokers can light up, that even the briefest hint of incense can make my sinus cavity quake with fear. I'll be damned if the clergy didn't come by and swing that incense thingybobber in my face and just missing my nose by a few inches. After two and a half hours, the congregation lined up to pay their respects to a mat that had the image of Jesus' body that was laid in a mock tomb. They would pay their respects and kiss it and kiss a Bible too. Some of the younger children crawled under this structure after they kissed the Jesus mat and Bible. I presume it was for some blessing or for a good year or something along those lines. Ryan apologized for the service going so long. It seems the Bishop always drags the service out and he did not typically come to the 3:00pm service, but he did this time. All in all, I found it to be a very beautiful service. I enjoyed watching the faces of the congregants and seeing them emotionally respond to the service. I've never felt emotionally connected to the church. Emotions are things that should not be trusted at face value. It's more important to understand things on an intellectual level. My relationship with God is personal and their is emotion there, but it something expressed in private and not for all to see. For a long time, I thought religion was something that everyone else got that I just didn't get. It was like a joke where everyone else understood, but I didn't. I didn't see the point of laughing along with everybody else if I didn't think it was funny. Much of this is due to the fact that I grew up in the Church of Christ, which is a literalist church. There are no musical instruments in the church service because of a scripture that says make music with your hearts. I asked Ryan, who doesn't necessarily feel drawn to organized religion, why he comes to this church. He said it was because it was what felt right or comfortable to him. It was what he grew up with. He liked the pagentry and the icons and the incense. I thought that was interesting and it reflected back how my interpretation of the service was based upon my own religious upbringing and pop culture experiences. Furthermore, it made me wonder what is more important: the message of Christianity or the style in which it is presented?

 IS THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN GEORGIA AN ENDANGERED SPECIES? For an interesting summary of last Tuesday's vote in favor of putting SR 595 on Georgia's ballot in November, read urlLink Kevin Griffis' article on the Creative Loafing Web site. Furthermore, urlLink Scott Henry's editorial on former Governor, Zell Miller, is enlightening as well. And finally, for a good laugh, read this parody of Christian Coalition of Georgia Chairwoman, urlLink Sadie Fields . For another interpretion of the state of the Democratic Party in Georgia in the AJC, urlLink click here .

 A DIFFERENT KIND OF STUD For those of you who have never seen oral historian and author, urlLink Studs Terkel , interviewed, you're missing out. There is an informative article in Sunday's AJC about him. In the early 90's, I began interviewing young gay men and women about their experiences for a book I had planned to write entitled They Walk Among Us . My purpose was to educate the public that gay and lesbian boys and girls did exist and they were discovering their feelings and their identities much younger than imagined. It was to allow them a voice to tell their own stories. No two individuals are alike. In fact, I remember interviewing a boy in high school and trying to make him understand a question that asked him to identify a psychological rationale behind his sexual actiivity, but ended up feeling like he thought I was just getting turned on by having him tell me about his sex life. I wonder if there is still merit in such a project? After working with the historical committee with our neighborhood association and reading two books on the history of gay New York, it has made me want to document some of the history of gay life in Atlanta. My friend, Mark, and I talked about interviewing some of our gay elders to put together an Atlanta gay history Web site about a year or two ago. I should really do something about this. Our community was so devastated by the aids crisis in the 80's that many voices and stories have been lost forever. I think I'll put this down on my calender to being doing something with in the Fall.

 BARR STILL AFTER CLINTON Bob Barr has contributed articles to urlLink Creative Loafing that have demonstrated his intelligence and knowledge of law, but his quest to reinstate a defamation suit against Ex-President Clinton undermines that creditibility in my opinion. Based upon this article from the urlLink AJC , he may be undermining his credibility with me again. I'd like to see the facts presented by both sides, but I find it doubtful that Barr will win that 30 million. WASHINGTON -- Former U.S. Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.) will get another shot at longtime foe Bill Clinton today when his lawyers ask a federal appeals court to reinstate a defamation lawsuit he filed nearly two years ago against the ex-president.

 MASADA IS MORE THAN A BRAND OF BAGELS Tonight, I read the Sunday urlLink AJC . The Target ad, my main reason for buying the Sunday paper each week, was abysmal. Best Buy and Circuit City didn't offer much hope either. I briefly zipped through the comics and found myself face to face with the rest of the paper. I found myself oddly motivated to read the rest of the paper and to find out what was going on in the rest of the world. In the Travel section, there was a fascinating article about urlLink Masada . Is is the ancient fortress near the Dead Sea where in the first century 960 zealots held off Roman soldiers for over a year before commiting suicide on the eve of their capture. The event is mentioned nowhere in the Talmud and was basically ignored by Jewish history until archaeologists began to uncover more information at the site during the 1960's. The zealots were so commited to their spiritual beliefs that they fled Jerusalem during the second revolt against the Romans and retreated to Masada. They defended themselves and their ideas until they realized there was no escape and that capture was imminent. More than likely, all the men would be put to death, but the women would most likely be raped and the children turned into slaves. The men of Masada felt that it would be better to kill their own wives and children than to allow them to fall into the hands of the Romans. S ome could argue that women and children were viewed as nothing more than property at that time and that the decision to slay the women and children may not have been for the most alstruistic reasons. Still, giving the benefit of the doubt, I'm not sure that many of us today believe any a cause so strongly to take such action. Is there any cause today that would inspire you to lay down your life for your beliefs? Granted, if any of us were on a plane and a terrorist attempted to do something, I think we would all stand up now and inform them that we are from the United State of Kick Your Ass. I cringe at writing that from the perspective that other nations seem to have of Americans and our current attitudes about foreign policy, but what I mean by writing what I did is that the victims of 9/11 had no idea of what was about to happen to them. We had always been told to cooperate with hijackers to prevent from being hurt. Look what happened to them? Now, we believe that any attempt to take control of an aircraft is a threat to every person aboard that flight in addition to anyone else that might come in contact with the plane. In other words, the responsibility would now fall upon ourselves to take action no matter what country you come from. All in all, I don't know that I could give my life for many of my beliefs. Am I going to kill myself to make a point about a Constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage? No. Do I speak up and say that I think it's wrong to change the most sacred government document to discriminate against some of our country's citizens if it may jeopardize my life? In that sense, maybe I am willing to risk my life even if the chances are little to none that I will actually be harmed. I think the Masada story is a good one to read. To read one rabbi's theory on why this event was let out of the Talmud, read the entry for urlLink Masada at the Jewish Virtual Library .

 EASTER IN REVIEW I woke up late this morning. Please see the previous post for an explanation of why I didn't sleep well last night. As a result, I didn't make it to the early church service or my Quest class. Although there are quite a few interesting things in the final lesson that I think you will find interesting. I'll post them later. I was feeling pretty sluggish today and got dressed with the intention of going to the 10:55am service at Jeff's church here in the neighborhood. I looked up and realized that I was late. I hate being late and many times will not go if I'm going to be late. I made that decision today. Instead, I picked up around the house and my friend, Tim, called from North Carolina. In fact, I need to post separately about Tim. He is a character that deserves many separate posts. Jeff and I went drove down to his parents house for Easter dinner. We ate about 2:00pm. The weather was overcast, but it was a pretty day today. We had a nice meal and I spent most of the afternoon outside with Jeff's great nephew blowing bubbles. We were going great guns with bubbles until the great nephew decided that he wanted to hold the bottle. The next thing I knew, I was sitting in the bubble mixture. So much for bubbles! I dyed eggs the night before so we could hide them. I was most impressed with the chartreuse eggs. When I was kid, we had four colors: red; blue; yellow; and I believe orange. I'm not sure why we had an orange tablet since it is a secondary color and yet we had to use blue and yellow dyes to make green. In the egg dye kit that I bought this year, it came with nine tablets in various colors including the aforementioned chartreuse. I hid the eggs and the great nephew hunted for them. He would squeal with delight whenever he found one. Of course, this is expected when you are two-years-old. I wondered what my co-workers would think if one day I just squealed like a big ol' girl when my Good Faith Estimate (GFE) matches my settlement statement. Does the increase in testosterone production supress the desire and ability to scream like a big ol' girl as boys grow into men or do we learn to change our behavior to what is expected of us? I'm not sure. In truth, I'm not really interested in screaming like a big ol' girl anyway, but I like to have my options left open to me. What guy doesn't? Jeff's parents gave me a small Easter basket. I'm officially the adopted son. It even had a Cadbury egg in it, which is my favorite alongside those Brach chocolate marshmallow bunnies. I must confess that I have not eaten as I normally do over this past weekend. It's a holiday. We make exceptions. I stretched out on my bed to read the Sunday paper this evening. Buddy, the cat, decided to join me. As usual, she tried to make it all about her and wanted me to rub her and pet for the next 20 years. After ten minutes of reading and petting, I felt drowsy and began to drift off to sleep. Suddenly, a sharp little paw taps me on my lower lip. I bolted up right, which caught her claw and punctured my lip. She was just trying to get my attention, but OUCH! "Don't do that!" I shouted. She just looked up at me as if I were some crazy, illogical pet owner. I napped for an hour and then got up and Jeff and I had a sandwich for dinner. I called my parents and now I'm updating the blog. I had wanted to organize my desk this weekend, but instead I worked on my bedroom and the rest of the house. Where has the weekend gone? I'm reflecting back upon Easter. It's not one of my favorite holidays, but I like the symbolism of Easter. It's about overcoming adversity and succeeding against the odds. It's about rebirth, renewal and rededication. I've been giving a lot of thought to those things and how to apply that to my life. One of the goals that I set this year was to mentally go through my day and forgive anyone I need to forgive or release anything I need to release from the day. Sometimes the person I need to forgive most is me. It's not about someone being right or wrong. It's about having my energy and emotional energy tied up and invested in a particular situation or with a particular person. As a result, I find my resources compromised because I'm stuck in this situation. If I can forgive and release the person/situation, then I have all of my resources at my disposal. It may sound corny, but I find it works for me. Afterwards, I meditate for about ten minutes before I go to bed. I haven't been consistent with this and I have made the decision to do this every night at 10:00pm to ensure that it's done. It's a fresh start with me. Looking at your own life, is there any area of your life that you would like a fresh start with?

 JEF VS. ACID REFLUX Last night Jeff and I went to Uncle Julio's for dinner. I was craving sour cream chicken enchiladas in a bad way and they were delicious. We ate late and I'm not used to eating that kind of food on a daily basis. Last night I dreamt that I wrote a musical play about two pioneer women who fall in love with the same mad scientist. I was amazed that I had written these songs that these women sang. The melodies were so beautiful and I had never heard them before. How can we create original music in our dreams and be unable to remember them after we wake up? Anyway, I was enjoying the show when I suddenly found myself on all fours in my bed with vomit coming out of my nostrils. It wasn't a lot, but I was startled and my nostrils were burning from the acid in my stomach. I went to the bathroom and washed my face, blew my nose and brushed my teeth again. It took me quite a while to get back to sleep. I spoke with my parents tonight. Both my parents have acid reflux from time to time. I told them what happened. They both asked me if I ate late and had a heavy or greasy meal. I sheepishly admitted that I had. I spoke with them both separately and they both informed me that the other parent had a problem with acid reflux from time to time. I had to laugh. Neither one spoke of their own problems with acid reflux but mentioned the problems of the other parent. I've always had a very acidy stomach. As a small child, I couldn't tolerate orange juice very well. It seemed to burn my stomach. All throughout my life I've had moments where acid from my stomach seems to take the express elevator up my throat. It doen's happen frequently, but from time to time. I guess I have found another special aspect of who I am. I'll also be careful to eat that type of meal so late in the evening.

 NUMBERS IN MY HEAD I just realized that my first roommate's birthday is today. I'm not exactly sure where Chris is now, but I believe he turns 34 today and I wish him all the best. We lived together for four years and we used to make birthdays something really special. Whether it was a Bart Simpson T-shirt when The Simpson had just premiered the previous Fall or kidnapping me to take me to a comedy club. We had fun. Some Saturday mornings, we wake up early and travel to every Half Price Books in the Metroplex to look for 12" records and promo CD's. We loved a good remix! Somewhere along the way, I introduced Chris to Donna Summer and ABBA. Soon, Chris would play little else and it was many years before I could tolerate hearing Dancing Queen again. When Chris and I first met, we both had best friends that had left the city earlier that year. I think we were both lonely in a way that guys are when they miss a male best friend. We made a pact that we would always be there for each other. Unfortunately, there was also enough mutual attraction to get us into bed together, but not enough of what we needed to make a healthy romantic relationship. I guess that I brought Chris out and it was strange to watch how he evolved from gay people approaching him making him shiver in terror to bursting out of closet and yelling, "FLAME ON" He truly became the Human Torch for a time. Sadly, we were too much in each others pockets to allow one another to move on. It was just as much me as him. We did the best with what we knew at the time. I remember a moment between the two of us where I couldn't tell whether either one of us was giving because we wanted to or giving out of obligation and that's when I knew we both needed to go our separate ways for now. The last six months we lived together were in silence. I think he may have been angry with me when I said I was leaving. He may have thought I was deserting him, but he needed to more room in his life for a new boyfriend and I needed more room to find myself first and then perhaps a new boyfriend. I knew the greatest gift I could give him was to let him go and allow myself to walk away. It was painful and it was scary, but I did it because it was the best thing for both of us. A month after I moved out, I was surprised to realize one day that all the pain and anger and frustration that I once had vanished. When I thought of Chris, I remembered us laughing and having a good time. Some time later that summer, I was driving to the post office on Oak Lawn. I suddenly had a very strong feeling that I should go to Oak Lawn Records with an urgency that is usually reserved for imminent vomiting. I had no need or desire to go to Oak Lawn Records because I had been there recently, but I had been reading about intuition at the time so I decided to honor the feeling so to speak. When I walked into the record store, I founnd Chris. He smiled sheepishly at me and I said hello. We exchanged some pleasantries. I was surprised at how easy it was for me and how awkward it seemed for Chris. I felt like I should try to put his mind at ease. He was quiet for a moment and said something to affect of I'm sorry for the way things happened. I smiled and told him not to worry about it. I let him know that I didn't have any negative feelings toward him. I think we exchanged phone numbers because I talked to him on the phone some time later. I'm pretty sure that I must have called. I wanted for us to be friends again to some degree, but I was wise enough to know that there would be some differences. I knew it was not healthy for us to spend a lot of time together, but if we could go to lunch once a month or so I would have been pleased. I wanted to stay in touch, but I didn't want to hold a lot of influence over his decisions now. He had a boyfriend now and I wanted him to turn to his boyfriend for that type of support. The conversation was awkward and I felt that there was some heavy burden of guilt that Chris carried for the time we lived together. There was no logical reason for it, but when have emotions been logical. After speaking for about 15 minutes, I knew that we could not renew our friendship at that time. I hung up the phone and said a little prayer for him and wished him the best. I needed to focus on working out my own issues and problems and not try to fix everyone else. This was the new me with lemon-freshened borax! I ran into Chris occasionally when I ran into him while I was out at J.R.'s or Moby Dick's. I was with my new friends that he didn't know and he was with his own friends that I didnt' know. We would say hello. Occasionally, we might make the attempt to initiate a stiff hug. Eventually, I moved to Atlanta. Many years later, I was home for Christmas and I Kent and I drove to Dallas to meet his new boyfriend, Blaise. We went to dinner and came back to the house where Blaise was renting a room from Stevie. In walks Chris. It turns out that Stevie and Chris are friends. We smiled and said hello awkwardly. At this point, I just felt uncomfortable being around Chris at all because I felt like I made him so uncomfortable. Here I was basically invading his territory. He asked me about life in Atlanta and my boyfriend. I asked him a bit about his. Then, Blaise, Kent and I left. Last time I heard, Chris had been through the Saturn Retrograde where you lots of life-challenging events occur when Saturn returns to where it was in the heavens when you were born. This usually happens when you are 28 or 29. I don't normally put much stock in astrology, but I can assure you that this happened to me. In fact, I'm not looking forward to age 56 with much anticipation. Chris and Stevie had a falling out and now they have renewed their friendship. I'm glad about that because Stevie is really great guy who is a fantastic friend to Chris. Sometimes people come into your life and they stay a lifetime. Some people just come into your life to walk with you for awhile and then your individual paths take you in different directions. I don't measure the success of a relationship, be it romantic or platonic, based upon the time you spent together. I base the quality of the relationship on what I learned with that person. I went through some of the most difficult life lessons I have experienced with Chris. At the time, I thought he was responsible for some of my unhappiness. In retrospect, he was a patient teacher. I hope I was the same for him. I wouldn't give up those experiences for anything in the world because they made me who I am today and I really like who I am today. Happy birthday, Chris, and I hope you have the best day ever! As I come to the end of this post, I realize that I meandered severely off topic. The purpose of this post was the way that some dates remain permanently etched onto our brains for life while we cannot remember others at all. For example, I remember birthdays of people that I was very close to in my mid 20's, but I have difficulty remembering anyone else's birthday. I can remember birthdays for Susan, Chris, Kent and Joan without breaking a sweat, but I cannot remember the birthdays of some of my closest friends from high school as my friend, Duane, demonstrated last Sunday when he called on his birthday. The human mind is strange and funny thing.

 FEEL MORE JOY Someone once gave me a little book by Shakti Gawain entitled Reflections In The Light: Daily Thoughts And Affirmations. I try to read a passage every morning to put myself in the right frame of mind for the day. I found today's entry unusual until I actually started to think about it. I'll share it with you. Feel more joy Saness is related to the opening of your heart. If you allow yourself to feel sad, especially if you can cry, you will find that your heart opens wider and you can feel more love and more joy. * As I allow myself to feel my sadness, I open to more joy. *

 A NIGHT AT THE BIG TOP Yesterday was a strange day. As hard as I worked, I felt like I was just running in place and didn't seem to be moving ahead. I had some new marketing ideas that I feel good about, but it's probably best not to try to implement them on Good Friday since you never know who is open and closed for business. In addition, I have a full list of things I can do today and I have already been up early taking care of one of them at a time. Sometimes I have to remind myself to break things down into steps and take it one step at a time. I can be my own worst enemey at times, but I'm learning how to be my own best friend too. Jeff reminded me that we had tickets to go see Alegria at urlLink Cirque Du Soleil last night. I have been so focused on work, volunteer stuff and the Perfect Pitch contest this week that I had completely forgotten about it. This was about the time some work-related events came to a head and I just had to sit down and center myself. I just had to ask myself why I was really getting upset because it was not about what I initially thought it was about. After a few minutes, I figured it out and regained my sense of peace. Shortly after, I received an e-mail from urlLink Image tha the Perfect Pitch contest deadline had been extended from April 9th to April 23rd. That was a relief. About 6:00pm, we drove up to Smyrna, which is just north of Atlanta. We had a nice dinner at urlLink Red Lobster . I ate a cheese biscuit and FRIED shrimp. I'm sure some of you thought that the earth would go spinning off its axis if I ate something UNHEALTHY. Well, I lived and we are still in orbit around the sun. It looks like the coast is clear. It was amazing to see these huge tents along side the highway near the Galleria. It looked like someone had inflated a Renaissance festival. We walked into the gates and Jeff decided that I should have a souvenir program. I stopped and was waiting for him to come back when a group of older gay men appeared. They looked at me for a moment and they saw Jeff come back with the program and hand it to me and they just smiled and wend, "Awww...." I know it sounds cheesy, but it was really a sweet moment. I have an obsessive fear of not using the restroom before any performance. Going to see The Return Of The King was very nerve-racking because I didn't drink anything for 24-hours prior to the movie so I could make it through without a mandatory intermission. So I walk up to one of the latrines and open the door and there is a guy standing there coiling his equipment back up into his jeans. I was very embarrassed even though the door said that it was vacant. The guy laughed and was cool about it. I think he may have been an exhibitionist. The set was very impressive. There were clowns in thse 18th Century masks walking around. The show is a combination of music and gymnastics. One woman did an impressive trapeze act. There was a fantastic juggler who looked like Helena Bonham-Carter in the face. One fellow did a hand-balancing act that was awesome. There were acrobats that did flips and landed on these soft boards and some guys who did something on a swing of sorts above the audience. I had never seen it before. It was impressive, but I would not have made it the finale. The contorionist was pretty awesome with her hula hoops. At times, I couldn't tell if I was looking at her from the front or back because she was literally a human pretzel. The flying man performed some aerial skills on sort of a bungee wire. I looked up several times at Jeff and he was so excited to share this with me that it made even more special. He asked me what my favorite part of the show was. It was hard to say. The contortionist and the hand-balancing act were technically amazing, but I really wanted to do the flying man's job. Afterwards, we went by urlLink Steak & Shake and bought chocolate shakes. (Will the madness never end?!) There was a couple there that were being very affectionate. The looked like brother and sister so it reminded me of John Irving's Hotel New Hampshire. It was a very nice end to a so-so day.

 EMOTIONAL QUICKSAND You know how you are just cruising along fine and something happens that just seems to suck you into a black funkin' hole where all hope, happiness and light has been condensed into blackness? Well that happened to me this afternoon. I sat down, sighed, took a deep breath and just allowed myself to feel it. My mind, like a playful puppy, saw the door wide open and ran for it with full abandon. I sat calmly as I watched my imagination run away with every absolute worst scenario and then when it wore itself out and was standing outside the door, I opened it and asked, "Are you through now?" It barked and came back inside and everything calmed again. I know there is a reason for everything happening in my life right now and I'm talking about much more good than, well nothing bad really, but I'll call the things "preferably nots." I sat down at 5:30pm and finished Carrie Fisher's book, The Best Awful . I enjoyed it. It was a sequel to Postcards From The Edge . I liked this one better. There was a line on the last page that struck a chord with me and I think I will share it in this little space because I really like you: And when they asked her if she was happy, this time she'd answer, "Among other things."

 WAXING ON ABOUT THE FEMALE BREAST "Do feel any different now that you're older?" "OH YES!" "Like what?" "I can't go out all night and then survive a full work day on 15-minutes of sleep." "Point taken." "And my boobs aren't as pretty anymore." "What do you mean?" She paused for a moment. "They're just not the same anymore." "Do you mean their sagging?" "DOH! YOU SAID IT! Now they will sag more." "I doubt very much that my spoken word has made your boobage advance any further down than where they are now. If it was true, I could just say, 'Do you mean they're sagging?' seven times fast and they'd be dragging the floor now." "They point south now." "I beg your pardon?" "They point south now. My nipples...." "Oh." "If I ever had any additional income to throw away on cosmetic surgery, I would have my breasts reduced and the nipples repositioned." "My friend, Laurie, from high school had a breast reduction surgery because of her back. They had to cut her nipples off and reposition them on her breast. The feeling didn't return for sxi months." "Owie!" " I guess that makes sense. Otherwise your boobs would be cross-eyed, wouldn't they. They could be very distracting for any potential sex partner. It might seem like your boobs aren't paying attention during lovemaking and cause him to lose his enthusiasm." We were quite for a moment. "Well, I guess I'd better run and get back to work." Yeah, I need to take a shower. Let's talk about breasts again sometime." "Okay."

 A PASSIONATE CONVERSATION Joan and I went to lunch yesterday afternoon. During a burrito at urlLink Moe's , we had the following conversation. "Do you have any desire to see urlLink The Passion of the Christ ?" I asked. "Yes... and no." "What do you mean?" "I'd like to, but I'm afraid that I wouldn't be able to watch all the violence. I had to turn Saving Private Ryan off." "Jeff's sister walked out of Private Ryan during the opening batttle becaue she got sick, but she said didn't have a problem with The Passion . She said it was easier for her because she knew that what she was seeing was actually close to what happened to Jesus." "Do you have any desire to see it?" I paused a moment. "No, I think I have a good understanding of what happened intellectually and my spirit doesn't feel the need to go see this movie in an effort to understand it emotionally. I guess it's my Church of Christ background. You know what chilly literalits they are." There was much chewing on burritos and ideals for a moment. "Joan, do you know if Jim Caviezel gets naked in this movie?" "Why would he have a nude scene?" "The Roman soldiers did strip him and beat him, I just wondered if it depicted that." "Do you find Jim Caviezel attractive?" "Oh yeah!" "So you will go see a movie that displays the ee-hee (Joanese for penis) of Christ for the "woo woo" factor, but you won't go see the movie to be moved by the most significant event that has ever happened." "You make it sound so... so... dirty." "You're reducing Jesus Christ to a sex symbol!" "No, I'm not. I just asked if Jim Caviezel did a nude scene. That's all. Even if he's doing full-frontal, it's still not going to get me into a theatre. I just wondered how commited an actor was to his part and the director to the authenticity of his interpretation. It is rated R after all. Besides, I would never see it as Jesus' penis it would be Jim Caviezel's penis and it would not be in it's full glory while he's being beaten. You're confusing The Passion with Pledgemaster IV: The Final Paddle ." "Okay, I believe you." "I bet Merrideth would go see it just to see Jim Caviezel naked." "You're probably right. She does like hirsute fellows with long flowing locks and facial hair." "Would you like some more Diet Coke?" "Yes, I would. Thank you."

 FROM TODAY'S PICKLEJUICE Natalie has a fascinating post on Picklejuice today. "But back to Liberians. Fascinating, fascinating people. In Liberia they don't use watches - trouble is that Liberians in America don't use them, either. Two p.m. on Saturday afternoon could just as easily be ten a.m. the following Tuesday as far as they're concerned, and they are really put-out if you're otherwise engaged when they finally show up. "But we made the appointment two weeks ago!" Really? And how would you know, Ms. I Keep My Own Standard of Time? It can be frustrating, but it's just another cultural difference I have to learn to contend with." Click urlLink HERE to read the rest of this post.

 MOTH BALL DIARIES, ENTRY 2 Katy, Kellie, Chris, Jeff (not 2F's) and I met at Grant Central West to discuss this year's Moth Ball. I had called Katy to confirm where we were meeting as I got into the Miata, having just received a hair cut. As fate would have it, George, her husband, had kid duty and informed me that he would pass the phone on to Katy who was just stepping out of the shower. There's nothing like talking to someone on the phone who you know is naked. Personally, I felt that this was way too early in the planning stages for us to talk on the phone naked. In my mind, mid-summer should be the sufficient amount of time required to talk on the phone in the nude. I figured by July that Katy, Kellie and I would be having three-ways in the buff all the time with the help of Southern Bell. Chris is the President of the Grant Park Neighborhood Association (GPNA) and Jeff is the V.P. It was hard to hear on my end of the table with the ambient noise. I watched Chris as he spoke, but there was no soundtrack for a good portion of the time. I found myself wondering what Chris would look like in drag and wondering, "Do we have a potential Queen of the Moth Ball contestant here?" We received confirmation that we will have the tent at the Zoo Atlanta for the same Saturday as the Tour of Homes. In order to do more with the party, we're going to make the event a fundraiser. Katy suggested that we give the money to the Grant Park Conservancy (GPC) and I suggested that we give it specifically for the restoration of the fountains in the park since our study revealed that it will cost $300,000 to get just one working. That's a lot of brownies and bundt cakes for a bake sale approach. Plus, it's something tangible that people have been talking about lately. I'm concerned that Glenn may actually show up one day with a chisel and a hammer to try and fix it himself. I asked them if there were some other things we could offer at the Moth Ball that we could charge for in addition to the ticket. It would allow us to raise more money for the fountains. They asked for an example and all I could think of was lap dances. Chris and Jeff seemed intrigued by the idea, but Katy and Kellie were having problems visualizing it. Maybe the Queen of the Moth Ball could offer the lap dances? Kellie suggested having a photographer with and old camera with a long lens. She may be on to something. Things ended with Katy and I disagreeing on exactly what symptoms designated whether someone was a midget or a dwarf. It was my understanding that the term midget referred to someone who was small in stature, but their limbs were in proportion to the rest of their body, where as a dwarf was not. The politically correct term for both now being little people . Upon returning home, I found an e-mail from Katy with the answer. Come to find out, we were both right. Here is the information straight from the official Web site of urlLink Little People of America . I only hope that Katy wasn't so outraged when I challenged her that she had to rush home and access the Internet to resolve the question once and for all. She's a saucy wench. I like that in a woman.

 REMEMBERING THE RABBIT TEST AT EASTER TIME I'm not a big fan of Easter other than I enjoyed seeing my family when I still lived in Texas. When you're younger, the Easter egg hunts are a nice diversion, but ultimately I think they have led to my obsessive compulsive collective disorder of owning the full set of everything. If I buy one of something in a series, I must own every other one as well. If I find a CD I like by a certain band, I must immediately collect every other album they have released. Alone and glassy-eyed, I cruise the pages of eBay like a shark along a sandbar at dusk. This has led to my quest to own every Bananarama record in existence. But honestly, do I really need a picture disc of Do Not Disturb in the shape of Siobhan? Of course I do! Let me just say that I don't like peeps. They are little marshmallow treats in the shape of baby chickens and coated with a light coating of yellow sugar. They also come in the shape of pink bunnies too. My mother would buy this for us every year until my older sister and I were well into our 20's. I'd eat one or two for nostalgia's sake, but inevevitably they would find a home on top of the microwave and or in a drawer and become a painful reminder of another piece of unfinished business that I refused to complete. I couldn't just throw them out because that would be a reflection on the love for my mother, but I just couldn't eat them. I could not longer continue to eat the past. This made me question why the mascot for the resurrection of Jesus Christ is a rodent, smartly dressed in a bow tie and tailored jacket who lives to hide brightly colored hard-boiled eggs for children all over the world. Is this rabbit a vegetarian? Where is he getting all of these eggs. My guess is that he has a sweat shop full of chickens in Asia and somehow Kathy Lee is connected to it all. Bunnies have never been associated with the ability to rise from the ashes to reinvent themselves. To me, it would seem more appropriate to have an Easter Phoenix or an Easter Madonna (Ciccone). At least with Madonna, there is more than one connection. This made me think of a movie from the 70's with Billy Crystal and written by Joan Rivers. He was the first man to become pregnant and the title was Rabbit Test . When I was young, the rabbit test was still used to determine if a woman was pregnant. She would give a urine sample to the doctor and it would be injected into a female rabbit. When a woman is pregnant, she produces a hormone in her urine, which affects the ovaries in a female rabbit. In the movies, they used to say the rabbit had died to indicate that a woman was pregnant. In actuality, they only killed the rabbits in the early 20's because they had no other way to check the rabbits' ovaries. In time, physicians learned how to inspect the ovaries without killing the rabbit. At one time, female bunnies were slaughtered for no other reason, but to indicate that a woman had a bun(ny) in the oven. Jesus was crucified on trumped up charges. I'm beginning to see a similarity. Now the bunnies have been saved and we can look at their ovaries without doing them in. In doing so, we are able to determine if a woman is about to give life to a new human being. Likewise, Easter is a celebration of Jesus' triumph over death to have everlasting life. The symbolism is intriguing. This Easter, I will go to church and then have lunch with Jeff's family. I am the adopted son they never had. We'll enjoy good food and good company. We'll hide the eggs for the kids and watch them hunt. Afterwards, we'll come back and I'll foolishly say that this year I'm actually going to watch The Ten Commandments on TV knowing full well that I cannot invest such a large amount of time in watching TV when I could be doing something productive. It should be a nice, quiet day. However, if someone offers me a Jesus peep, I may have to hurt someone.

 WHAT THE BLOG?! I was reading a new blog by a guy in Australia. He lives in Canberra, the Capitol as a matter of fact. When we were planning our trip down under a few years ago, our travel agent tried to talk us out of going to ACT. "No one ever goes there," she said. "But we want to and we're paying your salary. Capiche?" She looked at me spitefully over her bifocals and said, "Kuh-peesh." Two of my friends in our party worked in state government and the other friend was also very interested in politics. I was simply along for the ride because I got to see the Twelve Apostles off the coast outside of Melbourne. Once we arrived in Canberra, I enjoyed it tremendously. There are many great museums that I wished we had been able to see, but alas, we were only there for a day and a half. I've been surfing around and trying to understand what attracts me to a blog. I like to click on the Home Page links when reading Halo Scan comments and check out other blogs. Some immediately capture my attention and others don't. I check back with some from time to time and occasionally grow into them. I'll most likely review the ones I have on my blog and and put some new ones up that I'd like to recommend. I like urlLink Belle De Jour because she sometimes writes about very common things in a fresh way. I enjoyed her story about going to visit her friend's mother and and the ghosts of the children. I also like the way she ends some of her posts with a twist or foreshadowing of things to come. I like urlLink Sometimes Happy because you never know what Troy is going to write about and he has a pretty diverse group of readers commenting on his site. I usually find some interesting new blogs to read by clicking on that Home Page link under the Halo Scan comments. There is a vulnerability in his posts that I think any reader can relate to, but he holds back just enough to remain mysterious and you want to read more. I don't think it's manipulation. I think it's what he is comfortable with for now. It's like every day is a perfect little pop song. I like urlLink Beastmomma urlLink Not Enough Drew In The Worl d was one of the first blogs that I found on my own. He has a Walter Mitty quality about his writing that makes me check in from time to time. His life has had some interesting ups and downs over the past few months and I've enjoyed watching him overcome it all. He has shared some of his playwriting on his blog, which is very good. In fact, I must remember to e-mail him to let him know I found two short screenplays that take place in elevators that I wrote several years ago. It was for my screenwriters group. It's always an adventure to check in and see what personality he has taken on for today's adventure as I eat my morning yogurt. If you want to read about a night out with the scoobies, Drew's your man. urlLink To Blog Or Not To Blog has been a refreshing read over the past few days. First, it's nice to read about straight people at times. I don't want to get stuck in a little, pink, gay ghetto. Mick, that's his name, rants about a lot of things: Easter; DVD catalogues; Kurt Cobain's suicide; lack of rain; and politics. Today he was even kind enough to explain to me why Primeminister John Howard is a wanker. He's also one of those rare people who can use the word fuck a lot in his writing and it doesn't seem out of place. If you want a change of pace, check out the family man from down under. What is it that makes us peek into the daily lives of other people? It is the accessibility of other people across the country, the ocean or the globe? Do we actually begin caring about the well being of these people we have never met before? Are we stimulated by what captures their attention that day? Do we learn and grow from their own experiences expotentially? I don't know, but it's very addictive to pop over to see what spin Adam has put on the latest political development on urlLink The C-Blog or see if Marti is talking to cats again or uncovering a secret world of desktop items at urlLink Ramblings Of A Redhead . For now, I don't think I'm hurting myself or anyone else, so I'll continue to do it until I need glasses.

 KENT VS. CONNIE CHUNG I was thinking about Kent tonight as I was doing some ironing. Things seem to come out of nowhere when I'm doing repetitive tasks. Kent was my best friend from the time I was 13 up until he died on January 2, 2001. I won't go into detail about his death at this time. That's a post for another day. In the Spring of '95 I lived in the River Oaks complex on Cedar Springs in a third floor condo that faced the woods in the back. It was secluded and overlooked a little stream and a wooded area. It was a nice respite from the city. Donald had just moved in with a friend who owned a house and traveled quite a bit. He wanted someone to watch the house while he was gone. Duane was living with us and pursuing a personal training career at Bally's on Turtle Creek. This was after his career as a go-go boy at Damewoodz next to J.R.'s and B.M. (Before Maggie). Kent had been diagnosed not only with hiv in January of '93, but full-blown aids. I had already seen him go from the person I knew to an emaciated skeleton in a hospital bed and now his meds had caused him to gain some extra weight. Duane and I invited him to move in with us so that he could be close to the aids resource center in Dallas and some other day programs for people with aids. At this point in our friendship, Kent had already shut me out and let me back into his life once or twice. I imagine it was his way of dealing with disease. It was his protection, but all I knew was that it had hurt me and I didn't understand. Kent and I had usually seen each other every day or at least talked every day up until that time. We were so close, people often thought we were together, but we had never crossed that line. It would have been incestuous. One day I came home from work and found Kent laying in the hallway half-way in a closet reading old People magazines. "What are you doing down there?" "Well, I got tired and had to sit down and I was too weak to get back up so I thought I'd clean out this closet. Did you know what Charles did to Princess Diana when they were still together?" "Why didn't you call me at work?" "I couldn't reach the phone. Anyway, Charles was seeing Camilla the whole time." I felt awful. My best friend was stranded in the hallway of our home for several hours and unable to get up. One day we were sitting on the couch. Kent was watching television and I was reading the Dallas Voice or something like it. A commercial for a program featuring Connie Chung came on and Kent said, "I fucking hate Connie Chung." Silence followed. I looked over at the top of the newspaper at Kent. He had a content look on his face and sipped his soup as he watched a rerun of the Golden Girls . It wasn't unusual for Kent to explode in a rage over some injustice and then be over it in a moment's notice. I decided to let the moment pass without further questioning. However, now when I look back, I wonder what Connie Chung ever do to Kent. I guess I'll never know.

 SO YOU SAY YOU WANNA WRITE Tonight my writers group met at Outwrite, a local book store and coffee house. It's always interesting to meet there because when you read your work, it's sort of like playing strip poker and you have to reveal an article of clothing. There are people at people around us at other tables. They are flirting with one another, reading books or magazines, playing on their laptops and possibly listening to us reading our writing. Perhaps there are two people at this WiFi location who may even be chatting with one another on their laptops who are oblivious to the fact that they are only a few feet apart. T. is about to submit some of his work to a radio program. He wrote a very creative gate opener that I believe will bring him to the attention of the producer. It was clever, funny and written well. What else is there to consider? Then we begin exploring the idea of whether it is achieving its purpose and we begin to move things around and offer possibilties. Does it really give enough background information about him without becoming too much of a regular bio? I gave copies of "Exfoliation" with the understanding that it could be read outside of the meeting and read the Ten Years After The Honeymoon that I posted here back around March 27th. I'm still curious about where this story came from and why I wrote it. Some of the feedback I received was that they wanted to see more hints at struggles in the relationship in the past before they finally reach this point of understanding something deeper in their relationship. How come I don't describe the woman? Is it because I am a gay man? I don't feel that was necessarily the reason. It probably has more to do with the fact that I told the story from her perspective, but that's an interesting thought to consider. Some of the dialogue seems too literate. No one talks that way. Actually, I'm one of those people who does talk that way and that can be a disadvantage when it comes to writing dialouge. I have never been a good measuring stick when it comes to exemplifying something typical. I received a compliment about the subtlety and texture in my writing as well as the detail. All in all, the comments were helpful, but I need to decide what I want to do with this story. I could disregard it and think of it as simply an exercise, but emotionally, I find that I am somehow connected to these people. I want to return to them, but it will have to wait another week or so. I'm really enjoying C.'s work. Last month was his first meeting. His stories are about people and situations that are very unusual. I don't think he realizes how good his writing is. I also suspect it's going to get even better. There were a lot of people at Outwrite tonight, especially a lot of younger guys with laptops and journals. I wondered if they were writers. If so, how come they were not part of our group. Still, I enojy the intimacty of our small group, but I would like for the maximum number of people to benefit from it. I think the boy behind C. was flirting with me, but I just assumed that he was trying to get the attention of someone behind me. I think my indifference may have hurt his feelings. It's much easier to blame it on the person behind me no matter who he was smiling and making eyes at. It's interesting to see how the three of us look at things so differently. Our topics are so different. Our strengths and weaknesses are different. I've begun to realize that I'm lazy. I don't want to go back and reread my work after I'm done. After I've purged, I want to leave it alone for awhile. I'm horrible with typos. I'm going to work on that this month. I've also noticed that I'm more interested in telling the story than I am in the language of writing. In some ways that can be good and in other ways it can be bad. There are also times where you realize you've written some lovely prose, but it does not add anything to the piece and you need to cut it. Ouch! That hurts. After T. left, C. and I stayed for a few minutes and talked some more. He said some things that I thought were interesting, but because I did not ask if I could share those comments, I will refrain from doing so. The most important thought that came to me from our conversation is that although we all would like to be published and write full-time and earn a comfortable living, I find that I write to connect with other people. The success of my story or essay is to connect with someone emotionally, intellectually and perhaps even sexually in some instances. The person could be in my living room or on the other side of the world. The fact is that my characters and their situation had an affect on someone, however small, and perhaps changed them in some way. Even if it is just to open their mind to the possibility of that the character may have the right to make choices that the reader does not personally agree with. I want it to be real on some level and have it resonate and connect. Isn't that why we write our blogs? Don't we want to share something of ourselves and establish a rapport with others who relate to what we are communicating. Through a keyboard and some ASCII characters, we make ourselves vulnerable in a safe way. We strip and bear ourselves naked to the scrutiny of anyone that finds our little URL. No matter whether we are making fun of something or being sincere, we reveal information about ourselves with every keystroke. It's like autoerotic asphyxia. We take ourselves to the edge of no return and then stop before we black out and die. We create our tribe.

 WHAT MY SOUTH MEANS TO ME On my way home from my writers group meeting, I passed a MARTA bus with a a banner on the side. The banner showed a guy's face and explained that his South was about where jazz was born and a few other things. It got me thinking about what the South means to me. It's sweet tea, a Southern drawl, y'all, opening doors for ladies, driving everywhere, deep fried everything, Rebel flags and the rednecks that go with them, cowboy hats, and the proper way to say pecan [puh-kahn]. Looking back, I'm not impressed with my list. Have I left out loyalty and good neighbors? I don't know what's missing, but my list is not complete. I also imagined interviewing different people about what the South means to them. For some reason I imagined a very masucline lesbian with bleached, spikey hair, quite a bit overweight, smoking on a bar stool and doing shots of tequila. She tells me her South is between her legs and no man ever gets in there. I picture a little castle around her vagina with little men storming the castle with battering rams and trying to cross her moat. Alas, it is for naught. She goes on to tell about soft Georgia breezes blowing through her pubic hair and the sweetness of the morning dew between her legs. At this point, I'm beginning to question why I want this character in my head and where she came from. I understand the sincerity of what she is trying to say, but she has taken a question about home and turned it into a self-examination of her sensuality, if not her sexuality. Of course, I'm assuming that she was born and/or raised in the South. Perhaps she was born and bred elsewhere and her response is a passive agressive answer ripe with hostility. Maybe she struggled with her sexuality and has fianlly embraced the wonders of her body and she is just declaring this freedom in her words. The question still begs, what is she doing in my head? I've been very earthy as of late and I'm not sure why. I'm not sexually frustrated so I don't know where this is coming from. I guess time will tell. What does the South mean to you? Comment if you like.

 PAYING RESPECTS TO REALTORS One of the first things you will hear mortgage brokers talk about as a negative of the business is that you have to work with realtors. I found this pretty harsh at first. Then I went out to meet some realtors and I learned what they were talking about. Some of these people were so nasty to me just for saying hello. I've been very fortunate that I met the owner of a real estate office near my home with some great agents in it. They have sent me several clients and are just so much fun to work with. There is a real estate office in another near by neighborhood that I've been meaning to stop in and visit. They are a private company that is not associated with any big companies liek RE/MAX, Coldwell Banker, etc. I had an appointment this afternoon and on my way home, decided to swing by and introduce myself. I sometimes have clients that do not currently have a real estate agent and I like to refer pre-approved clients to realtors who have helped me in the past. I also like to match the personality of the client to the personality of the realtor. I walked into the office and held the door open for a man coming in behind me. As it turns out, he is the owner of the company. I explained that I didn't know anything about his company and wanted to learn more as I sometimes hae clients that I refer to realtors. He asked me several questions. He had a bit of an accent and I would gather that he might be of Italian, Greek or Middle Eastern descent. His primary business is investors and property management, but he does do some residential mortgages. I told him that I had some investors that might be interested in speaking with him and he said he would review his list of clients and try to send me a client. I reached out to shake his hand just as he removed a papertowel from his hand and revealed that part of his finger was missing. He put the papertowel back on his finger. I smiled and we shook hands. It was one of those paintings that Norman Rockwell forgot to paint: Ambitious Loan Officer Meets Realtor with Seven Fingers. I walked away from the meeting feeling very good about it even though so many things were not what I expected. I had a really good feeling about going today as if all the stars were in allignment. I guess we'll see what happens.

 F*#@KIN' FORGIVENESS I've written a lot about forgiveness lately because it just keeps coming up in my life lately. It's sort of like when I bought a Miata, I began noticing just how many Miatas were on the road... and not one as sharp as mine. Yesterday, I ran to the bank and picked up some lunch on my designated lunch break. I'm driving back to the house and go through the green light. This African-American couple walk out into the middle of the road with a baby in a stroller and I have to break quickly. I didn't even come close to hitting them, but I'm wondering to myself why they are J-walking in the middle of the street and walking through a line of cars going the opposite way from me. I couldn't see them for the cars so when they walked out into the street, it was like they were just jumping out in front of me without warning. I have no idea why they didn't go to the corner and wait for the light. Anway, I motioned for them to cross since I'm already stopped and they just stand there and stare at me like I've done something terrible to them. I was tempted to rev the engine to motivate them on, but I found myself thinking, "Okay, practice what you preach. Maybe they are just embarrassed or don't understand how their actions jeopardized their lives. We all make mistakes. No one was hurt. Just let it go." So I took a deep breathe and just let it go and it felt good. This afternoon, I ran by Target on my way home and the guy in front of me stops in the parking garage and puts on his emergency lights. A lady walked up to cross over to the store and I stopped. She stopped. I motioned for her to go and she motioned for me to go. Then the guy opens his door so I have to stop. Then she frowns and looks at me and mouths something and starts to cross the road shaking her head so I start laughing. This seems to piss her off even more. What can I do? I think about what happened yesterday, take a deep breathe and let it go. I wondered what was going on in that lady's life to make her so disagreeable. I wished her the best and moved on. It reminds me of something Louise Hay once said about people getting upset about driving in traffic with bad drivers. "Why should I get upset because you can't drive?" It's true. We all choose whether to invest our energy into getting upset about what someone does or does not do. We should think about whether it is worth the price before we get upset. Granted, there have been times where I debated the price, decided it was worth it and then went for the jugular vein. IN the end, I didn't feel good about it and usually paid for it. Who was it who once said, "Do you wanna be right or do you wanna be happy?"

 POST MORTEM OF SENATE RESOLUTION 595 In November, Georgia voters will decide whether the state constitution should ban same-sex couples from marrying. On a second attempt, the state House of Represenatives approved this anti-gay marriage amendment last Wednesday. Supposedly the four or five votes that made the difference were from the Legislative Black Caucus that lobbied fellow caucus members to vote against SR 595. "It is a night of relief, and we are gratified that this is behind us," stated Sadie Fields, the chair of the Christian Coalition of Georgia. "It's just good that this moment has been finished for once and for all, and that the people will have the voice that they deserve." As she completed her comments to the press Wednesday evening, Gregory Casajuana, a gay 15-year-old, wrapped his arms around Ms. Fields and said, "I would like to give you a hug and say, 'Thank you for taking my rights away.'" It seems several legislators who voted in favor of SR 595 felt their actions were being unfairly labeled as discriminatory . What?! Say it isn't so. "We've been called bigots, we've been called full of hate and hate-filled," said Rep Barbara Bunn (R-Conyers) during the House debate on Wednesday. "But the Judeo-Christian values that have held our society together for all these years is not equated to bigotry and hatred." I supposed that is easy for her to say when she hasn't been chased down an alley by Baptist boys with tire irons for being different. "Jesus told me to kill all faggots and I killed 'em good. In fact, I mounted one of the heads up above my fire place between the buck and the moose head." Bless her heart. Sate Rep. Sue Burmeister (R-Augusta) doesn't feel that gays and lesbians face discrimination when it comes to marriage. "No one is preventing homosexuals from living together -- all homosexuals have the right to get married and have that marriage sanctioned by the state. They just have to marry someone of the opposite sex -- the same rights I have. If society is forced to redefine marriage, then we are establishing new and special rights." Oh, I know she did not say special rights . However, she has a point and I think I would like to explore the possibility of marriage further with her daughter. She did not state that I had to have sex with her daughter, but just to marry her for those unspecial rights. We would move in with Sue and I would bring my close friends over to the house and we would have boys only Bible study up in my bedroom with the door lock. "Sue, now don't you worry when you hear those screams coming from behind the closed doors. I'm just exercising, uh exorcizing those demons out of his body." Bless her heart. "We all know the story of Sodom and Gomorrah -- men of the city wanting the male angels," said Rep. Hinson Mosley (D-Jesup). Excuse me, I though the issue raised in this particular scripture was sexual assault and not gay sex. Therefore, if the men of the city wanted female angels, it would have been okay because they were probably all painted up like cheap hussies and deserved to be raped anyway. I was blind, but now I see. Bless his heart. I think it is interesting with the number of men and women dying in Iraq that the issues that have captured the attention of the American people so far this year have been Janet Jackson's Nipple Gate and whether we should change our most precious government document, the Constitution of the United State of America, to ensure that only the right people are allowed to have the benefits of a legally recognized union. After all, we have to preserve the sanctity of marriage, right? Ironically, Rep. Tom Bordeaux (D-Savannah) proposed an amendment that would have added a ban on adultery, but some of the good ol' boys in the House were too busy out fornicatin' to pass that amendment. Bless their little bitty, teeny tiny... hearts. Rep. Nan Orrock (D-Atlanta), the House Majority whip also proposed an amendment to SR 595 that would have removed Section B, which is the piece of legislation that critics argue will prevent private companies and local governments from offering domestic partner benefits to gay couples. It was defeated also. So, in effect, not only am I unable to enjoy the rights of marriage as recognized by the state of Georgia, unless I marry Rep. Burmeister' daughter, but now I am unable to receive medical benefits from my partner's employer even if they have agreed to do so. Bless my heart... and bless my soul. I'm screwed! On the bright side, it seems that the push toward discriminating against gays and lesbians is creating sympathy amongst younger heterosexuals in the U.S. The polls show that more people are reconsidering their position either because of the fact that don't find this issue significant enough to change the Constitution or perhaps they have become more educated as more gays and lesbians have come out and shown how normal and non-threatening we really are. The Executive Director of Georgia Equality, Allen Thornell, said the outcome of last Wednesday has only motivated him to continue the good fight and not give up. "My first reaction was, 'OK, now we're going to have a ballot initiative.' We lost this time, but the discussion that this will cause about gay and lesbian issues around the state will change the state of Georgia forever." In closing, I think the answer is education. Many heterosexuals still believe they do not know any homosexuals when their daugher has a crew cut, wears flannel and is the president of the local Indigo Girls Fan Club. There is still a lot of fear out there. You say that you're gay and many people still immediately visualize you in a compromising position with all the members of the Village People. People are only now beginning to learn that we can settled down and have commited relationships and can care and love one another and even raise children. Let's show them that GLBT people come in a variety of flavors and we are not all mincing, lisping faggots or macho butch lesbians. And when we do decide to mince or be butch, we're fabulous! We must stop the dissemination of any lies and untruths about homosexuals. Now, if you will excuse me, I have to go sprinkle fairy dusts into individual ziplock bags. I'm hitting the school yards early tomorrow to get my converts. I'm only 23 newly converted homosexuals away from a stainless steel toaster oven, which will look fabulous in my kitchen. "Then said Jesus, 'Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.'" Luke 23:34 King James Version

 SINGLE STRAIGHT MEN AND THEIR CATS Last night I spent about half an hour looking at other blogs. I came across this straight guy who is into soccer, fast cars and has a cat named Ms. Sadie. For some reason, this just stood out like a sore thumb to me. I can't think of any straight guys I know who own cats without a wife or live-in girlfriend. Strangely enough, a straight man living alone with a cat is like a girl riding in a truck between two guys. It just has a scarlet letter written all over it. Then I stopped myself. I reprimanded myself for marginalizing a minority, straight single guys with cats, not crabs. I sometimes wonder if the Senate Resolution 595 hasn't fixated my mind on gay-only issues and made me insensitive to the needs of my straight friends. So I shifted my perception with an audible pop and imagined what my life as a cat would be like with a straight owner. I imagined that there would be plenty of pizza to eat and beer to drink. There were be lots of dirty laundry all over the floors and furniture to take little cat naps on. I would probably be tossed around a bit as if I were a football. "Hey Jerry, go on out for a pass and I'll throw Sadie to you." I would dread whenever his friend, Roger, would come over. Roger is a punter. I imagined myself cleaning myself one evening in the living room as I hear my owner talking on the phone to one of his buddies about his new girlfriend. It's all rather trivial and I usually tune him out as I crane my neck around to lick my anus when I suddenly hear my owner say something about eating pussy. My head shoots up and I stare at my owner, ready for his first move. My claws are ready. I am ready for my opportunity. I'm not going to be feline mingon. As soon as the door opens, I'm out of here. No, I just can't imagine a cat living with a single straight guy. It's beyond the realm of my imagination.

 THE DAY IN REVIEW Do you ever have one of those days where you were very busy, but upon review, you don't have much to show for it? That's what today felt like. I'm working on several different projcets at once and have completed none of them. However, I'm going to take a break and go the gym and will come back and finish one before the day is over. I created a newsletter to send out to former clients and potential new ones. It really has turned out nicely. I'm still working on the first time home buyers workshop, which has been a little more complicated than I would have anticipated. During my lunch break, I decided to go into my bedroom and go through a box. I found a bunch of old cassettes that I now have on CD. I guess I'll put them on eBay so that someone who will appreciate them will find them. I'm really trying to free up some space in my life from things that I no longer need or use. I also jumped rope this morning. I'm still surprised at what a great workout that is in just ten minutes. I have decided to jump rope every morning and continue with weight lifting three days a week with some possbile in-line skating or swimming on the other days. I think I may have gotten too comfortable with carbs again. I had a burrito for lunch today and I forgot to tell them to cut the rice. I feel a bit bloated today as a result.

 COLD MORNING THOUGHTS A northern blew in Saturday night and we woke up to a cold morning. I'm not a cold morning person. When I wake up, I look at the clock and like to snuggle under the covers and enjoy the warmth for just a bit longer. When I was a very small child, my mother brought me a book about two chipmunks that lived under the front steps of a family of four. I don't know if the chipmunks were living an alternative lifestyle, because the pictures did not indicate a flashy wardrobe, a fixation on Madonna or a fabulous apartment. The antagonist of the story was a cat that cramped the chipmunks' lifestyle so they got rid of him. I don't think they did anything as poisoning the cat or enticing him into the wood chipper, but they cleverly removed the cat from the premises. The last picture showed the chipmunks sleeping together on some straw. They were snuggled up together and sleeping together with warmth from the body heat. That image comes to mind every time I'm snuggled under the comforter and thinking about facing the cold air. If it is espcially cold, I pull the comforter over my head and imagine that my starship has crash landed on the froze planet Tundra and the comforter is a technologically advanced cover that will use my body heat to keep me warm and put me into a state of supsended animation until help arrives. Then I'll drift off to sleep. It's strange, I know, but it works for me.

 PALM SUNDAY 2F's and I went to the MLK Chapel at Morehouse College today for a Plam Sunday Service. Atlanta Unity was invited to hold their service there by Dean Carter. I was happy that 2F's went with me. It meant a lot to me. Joan was on stage singing with the choir. I always identify her by her tennis shoes. The sermon was on religious tolerance. Reverand Strickland told the story of how Ghandi read the Bible and then remarked that it was a shame that no one seemed to be putting it to use. In spite of the marketing that the U.S. is a Christian nation, I often times look at our actions and have to disagree. Why are we still living an eye for an eye and not turning the other cheek? If Jesus appeared on the planet now, I wonder what he would think of the teachings that have evolved into Christianity.

 OUR WORLD LEADERS: HOT OR NOT? I came across this interesting poll on urlLink Buggery.org from Australia. You rate how sexy our world leaders are. Personally, I give studly Crown Prince Felipe of Spain a ten for shagability. Woohoo!

 MY GRANDMOTHER'S AIR CONDITIONER For some reason I was thinking about window box air conditioner units. I think I may have seen some advertised in this week's Sunday ads. You don't see them much anymore. However, we saw one yesterday in the Public Storage office. I was amazed at how cool it made the office when it was so hot and muggy outside. My grandmother and my Aunt Barbara did not have central air conditioning in their houses. They had these air conditioners in windows throughout the house. They were so foreign to me. I would look at them and place my face close to the vent and it would chill my face. I would step away and put my hands on my face and be amazed at how icy my skin had become. My grandmother also had a makeup mirror that had the colored slides that would change the light to various times of day. I didn't understand why it was important, but it came back to me during my TV production classes in college. Sometimes I would steal away to my grandmother's bedroom in the afternoon. I would lay on her bed and stare at the air conditioner as I listened to the steady rhythm of its rumblings. Often times I would fall asleep to this mechanized lullaby. I miss those air conditioners; when I see them, I always smile.

 SCREENPLAY UNDER CONSTRUCTION So I have to write the rest of the screenplay, about 110 pages, in less than two weeks. This will give me a week to do have people read it and give me feedback so that I can do rewrite and make corrections in the last week. As fate would have it, we had already planned to do a neighborhood yardsale the morning of the Perfect Pitch Contest. I've spent the past few days looking over my screenplay books, fleshing out the treatment, creating character biographies, sketching out scenes on index cards and I think I'm ready to begin writing tomorrow morning. I have found looking over Syd Fields' The Screenwriter's Workbook to be very helpful. I had read his first book, Screenplay, back in the summer of '92, so I guess that makes it exactly 12 years ago. Eek! I can't believe that much time has gone by and I feel as if I have done nothing. Still, I was having life experiences that have led me to writing this screenplay today. At least 13 years have not gone by. As I have read through the book, things have come back to me quickly, such as the setup, plot point one, conflict, plot point two and the resolution. There have even been some new concepts such as the pinch. All in all, ideas have come to me to flesh out the story and characters with deeper meaning and symbolism. I'm very excited. I'm also feeling very confident. I trust that when I sit down to write and do the work, the ideas and answers come to me easily and effortlessly... and they have. It's as if the story is writing itself and I'm only taking it down. I remembered the first time the character of Millicent came to me. I was driving to work last summer and in my mind I was sitting on Jay and Susan's porch next door. She was selling Girl Scout cookies. I told her that I was on the South Beach Diet and currently doing Phase One. She reminded me that Girl Scout cookies freeze well and I knew that she was a force to be reckoned with. Over the course of time, her gay neighbor, Chuck, and her mother, Kylie, entered the picture as well as her best friend, Emily. Then Chuck's boyfriend, Bob, showed up and things began to gel. It all sounded like a crazy idea at first. Who would want to read a script or watch a movie about these people. Millicent looked at me with love and patience in her eyes. She said, "Trust me." So I did and here I am writing a script about these people. I've also realized that this story is about a scared little girl who learns, through trying to control the people and events around her, to embrace faith. There are few things I want to tweak about the first ten pages to tighten it up a bit, but for the most part, it will stay the same. I feel as if the screenplay is teaching me a lot about myself now.

 NORWEGIAN YARDSALES ARE THE STRANGEST THINGS You would think that once our company left, Jefffifer would slow down. Sadly, it's not to be. Jeff and I went on an excursion yesterday morning to move his books from one storage facility to another. Afterwards, we had lunch at the Australian Bakery in East Atlanta. I thought I ordered a big fluffy thing, but what I received was a small thick wedge of pork pie. It was good, but I was really hankering for the big fluffy thing. Next time, I'll have to be more specific when I point to something in the glass case and ensure that whisk the right item out and into the oven. I spent the rest of the afternoon cleaning and doing laundry. I'm buidling a portfolio website for my written works and put that up on the server. It's amazing how many websites I have up and out there. I'll post the URL once I finish for those who would like to visit and give me feedback. I was actually amazed at the amount of poetry, essays, short stories, scripts and plays that I have written in my lifetime... and I still have to find the rest of it. I'm going to have to type up some of the pieces again. I've been thinking about this for a while. Over the past few months, I have come to realize that I want to write and to publish my work. I figure the best way to do that is to put a portfolio on the Web that I can refer people to. I went for a run yesterday and it rained half way around the park. The rain was refreshing. I took the headphones from my portable CD player and tried them with my Archose Jukebox and it's amazing the difference in the sound quality. I can actually crank the sound bass up to appropriate levels and have 10GB worth of music at the mercy of my ever changing moods. Tony and Thom saw me running and asked if Jeff and I wanted to go to dinner with them. I checked with Jeff when I got home. Since we were planning on grilling a steak and staying in, the rain put a stop to that. We went to a new restaurant in East Atlanta called Pasta Thyme. It was very good. Afterwards, we went to Jakes Ice Cream for dessert. I got half a scoop of strawberry cheesecake and chocolate cinnamon. Everyone else got cotton candy, which tasted amazingly like cotton candy. Tony shared that he didn't think that cheesecake really tasted like a dessert. We all took in his opinion and carefully considered it in silence. I worked on the screenplay last night. This morning I rose early and went to church for my class. TOday we discussed praying for others. It was interesting. I was taking notes with a pen that has a light built into it. I kept unconsciously clicking it and blinding the instructor. We went to lunch with Brian and Brian at Einstein's. We discussed religion and invasions by gay aliens from outer space and burying saints to find lost objects. It was very educational and nutritious. Afterwards, Jeff and I went to a yardsale around the corner and they were selling Ivory soap, but the packaging was in Norwegian. It was a strange selection of items. The proprieter was also selling songs from the 80's and 90's off his laptop for a dollar. I was curious as to what kind of royalties he was paying to the recording industry, but didn't ask. I'm waiting for Tim to pick me up and we are going to go see Van Helsing. Afterwards, Jeff will meet us for dinner. I was hoping to go to Michael's so I could buy a Sharpie marker set with fifteen different colors, but Tim says that Michael's closed where we are going. I was speechless. Tomorrow, I'm not planning to do anything but work on my screenplay and exercise. I think I have successfully spent time with everyone that I have been putting off for months. Maybe I can take a nap before Tim gets here.

 GOODBYE CANADIAN FRIENDS So Joel & Merideth left to drive home to Canada around lunchtime yesterday. Afterwards, Jeff and I lay on my bed and just felt sad. I was amazed at how quickly you can form a bond with people that you just met a week ago. In fact, I realized that I was getting sad Thursday and willed myself to zoom out in my perspective so as not to be maudlin. Jeff met Joel's older brother, Jeff, on a missionary trip back in 1989. They became fast friends and Jeff refers to Jeff as his other brother Jeff. Jeff usually flies up to Canada after Christmas each year and visits. He considers them to be his extended family. In 1999, I met Jeff for the first time and I would say we hit it off well. Last year, I met Jeff's wife and kids. This year I met Joel and his wife, Merideth. Jeff just told them that he was gay last Christmas. Saturday night, we went to Dakota Blue and had dinner. I suggested fish tacos and J&M thought I was making it up. Merideth decided to be bold and got the fish tacos and really enjoyed them. Afterwards, we walked back home, chatted a bit and went to bed. The next morning, they went to church and I met them at Cafe 458. We had lunch and went to Zoo Atlanta. It was nice to finally go since I've been a member for two years. Afterwards, we went to Jake's Ice Cream and I had half a scoop of Animal Crackers ice cream and half a scoop of Chocolate Cinnamon ice cream. We went to Publix and bought groceries. We grilled hamburgers and watched Coupling over lemon ice box pie. Monday evening, J&M took in the MLK Memorial and Little Five Points. I met them after my first time home buyers workshop and we had dinner at Commune. We then took the fifty cent tour of Atlanta. On Tuesday, they went to World of Coca Cola while I was at work. We went to see the Chihuly glass exibhit at the Atlanta Botanical Gardens. I saw the fitness model who used to go to my gym. He's been in several magazine covers and he models some swim line that is based here in Atlanta. Small world. Then we went to Loca Luna for tapas. On Wednesday, we attempted to go to the drive in, but decided to go to Chick-Fil-A instead. We toured East Atlanta and got coffee and Java Joe's. On Thursday, we went to Fat Matt's for barbecue and then to the gay sports bar, Woof's for a beer. Afterwards, we went to Backstreet to see Charlie Brown's Exotic Cabaret. We couldn't figure out why it was so dead until we ordered some drinks. We forgot their liquor license had been suspended. It was fun. Joel had a really good time laughing at Charlie Brown's bad jokes. This morning we got up and made muffins and took it easy. J&M packed up and loaded their car. They rode Jeff's little motorized scotter up and down the block. They took our picture in front of the house and then left. They gave Jeff some wind chimes as a thank you gift for letting them visit. It will be nice when Jeff hangs them up because whenever we hear them, we'll think of J&M.

 HAPPY BIRTHDAY KENT AND KYLIE Today is the 35th birthday of my best friend, Kent, and Australian singer, Kylie Minogue. I find it interesting that they share the same date of birth. Unfortunately, I will be unable to celebrate with either one since Kent is dead and Kylie is in Australia, France or London. Still, I shall mentally send a shout-out to the ethereal realms and down under. I didn't necessarily like Kent the first time that I met him. We were both in the seventh grade. I thought he was strange. He had brown curly hair and would sit beside me on the school benches at lunch and recite strange poetry such as: Mary had a little lamb Its fleece was white as snow And every where that Mary went She stood on it He really didn't have anything on Sylvia Plath, but I guess you could say it was... inspired. Kent and I crossed paths at a strange time in both of our lives. My family had just moved to Burleson, Texas and I was having a hard time adjusting to this small town. I discovered that I was one of those socially phobic people who didn't know how to mingle. Making friends was very difficult for me and I ran from my loneliness into the company of books. These weren't necessarily good books either. If I recall, one of them was a paperback novelization of David Cronenberg's Scanners . Kent was the youngest child of three splitting time between divorced parents. As fate would have it, Kent actually lived two streets over from me and we rode the same bus. Over the course of time, we eventually began to hang out together. One of our first activities was to play strip poker in my father's camper. It wasn't a sexual thing at all. It was just the most visible way we could think of to show progress in the game. I don?t even think we made it down to underwear before we lost interest. Kent was famous for putting his belongings down and leaving them anywhere. My father mowed over far too many of Kent's shoes and socks than he cares to remember. Kent also had a hot temper at times. You never knew what would set him off, but for the most part, he was usually jovial. One day while sitting on the couch, a commercial for a evening news program with Connie Chung came on TV. Kent?s face contorted up like a constipated, walrus rectum and shouted at the TV. ?I fucking hate Connie Chung!? It was never clear to me why he felt that way. Kent and I were so close that we could often finish each other sentences. We had a very similar sense of humor. We used to look at one another and imitate smalltown Texas women by saying, "I don?t know why Betty. I don?t know why.? We thought it was hilarious and that?s all that mattered. Somewhere I still have the script for our comic masterpiece, Spittle On My Windmill. At one point, Kent and I decided to make a science fiction movie with my parents? Super 8 camera. It was a rip-off of Forbidden Planet and Alien, but we were excited about it. Kent played the bloodthirsty creature who is destroyed in a burst of flames by a psychic laser beam at the end. Kent said he knew how to make some flame-retardant substance with every day household items found in the kitchen. He was going to whip some up on the stove so we could lather it all over him and then set fire to him with the camera rolling. Unfortunately, somebody?s parents found out and soon halted production on our blockbuster on a shoestring. It was a shame too because we had already written the theme song. Meanwhile, Kylie released I Should Be So Lucky in the U.S. I saw the video on MTV and bought the 7? record without knowing who she was. She later covered The Loco-Motion, which was one of my favorite songs as a kid. Her music was as innocent and nave as I was about human nature at the time. When I moved out of my parents? house to go to school at the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA), Kent moved into an apartment down the street with his lover, Roger. We saw each other or spoke on the phone at least once a day. Any new people who entered our lives had to understand that you just didn?t get one of us, you got both of us. This was tested once when one of Kent?s boyfriends came on to me. I really liked Brian and thought they made a great couple, but I didn?t want to stir trouble up. Maybe I was jumping to conclusions. Besides, Kent was too much in love with Brian to believe me. They broke up a month or so later and I finally told Kent. He didn?t think I was making it up and he agreed that if I had told him at the time, he wouldn?t have believed me. Kylie and I were estranged from 1989-1990. She wasn?t on the radio in the U.S. and since I didn?t know any of the songs on Enjoy Yourself, I opted to purchase something else with my limited budget. I later bought a Stock Aitken Waterman megamix that had Never Too Late on it. I fell in love with the song and went out and scored a copy of Enjoy Yourself at Half Price Books. It was good to be friends again. When I graduated from college, I made Kent a cassette tape with various dance music that we liked. It was called the Bitch Goddess Tape and Kylie was included in the mix as well as Bananarama and Betty Boo. We would play it in the car when we drove around together and sing at the top of our lungs. When I graduated from UTA, I bought Kylie?s Rhythm Of Life CD and some Eternity cologne by Calvin Klein. I was ready to be in a relationship now and What Do I Have To Do was my theme song. Little did I know that I would be waiting to meet Kirk until later that autumn. In the mean time, I sang along to Shocked, Stepped Back In Time and Better The Devil You Know. Kent and I began going two-steppin? at the Roundup in Dallas. I was now entering my country phase and showed little interest in Kylie?s Let?s Get To It album. Instead I would watch cowboys moving about the dance floor with their arms around one another in the soft lights while Pam Tillis sang Maybe It Was Memphis. Sometimes I would close my eyes and imagine that I was one of those cowboys. I packed up and moved to Dallas in the summer of ?92. I received Kylie?s Greatest Hits for my 25th birthday and found it hard to get too worked up over What Kind Of Fool (Heard All That Before) and her cover of Kool & the Gang?s Celebration. It was a good mirror of where I was emotionally. Kent had entered massage school. I found myself entrenched in one short-lived relationship after another with emotionally unavailable guys. My contact with other friends occurred less because I now lived in Dallas. My temp-to-perm job was going nowhere. In 1993, Kent was diagnosed with aids. It was a long quiet period as Kylie recreated herself after the PWL years and Kent and I learned how his illness would change our friendship. I asked him if knew who had infected him with hiv and he said that he knew. I asked him why he had unprotected sex and he said that he was afraid that if he made the guy use a condom, he would go away and he didn?t want to be alone. Those words made my blood chill. How could my best friend have such little regard for himself and his health? Why wasn?t I a better friend? Why didn?t he talk to me about this earlier? However, in time I learned that had very little to do with me and more to do with human nature. It was just the nature of the beast, that?s all. Kent drifted back to Fort Worth and a new boyfriend in 1994. I moved out of the apartment that I shared with Chris and Susan began dating Sue. I suddenly found myself alone. By September, I was hit hard by a dysfunctional relationship with a guy named Mark. One minute he was loving and kind and the next he was downright mean. The worse he treated me, the more I wanted him. Kylie?s Confide In Me intrigued me with the dark secrets that I knew lay within Mark, but it was Put Yourself In My Place that helped me grieve the loss of the relationship. Kent had his first brush with death the following year. I went to visit him in the hospital. He was emaciated and jaundiced. I didn?t know what to do. Kent and I had become estranged during his last relationship and we found ourselves staring at one another and wondering who the hell this person was. Later that year, Kent recovered and moved in with me for a few months. He did well during that time and was very involved with some programs for people living with aids at the local aids resource center. More importantly, we got to know each other again. He thrived for awhile and then his health spiraled downward. He moved in with his mother and suddenly I was alone again. I moved to Atlanta the following year. I went to see Kent before I left. We took a walk outside and he got somewhat emotional. I told him that if he needed me, I would come back to Texas. I would be there for him. However, it?s hard to believe when your heart is full of fear. After I moved to Atlanta, I had a dream that Kent was in trouble. The next morning, there was a voice mail message from Kent in the middle of the night. He was tearful and said that he hoped that I would come home if he died. I felt selfish for moving and I just wanted to cry. In ?97, I had received a promotion, Jeff and I had started dating and Kylie released Some Kind Of Bliss. I found the new and improved Indie Kylie to be revitalizing. Kent has responded well to the drug cocktail and recovered nicely. He entered a rehab program for people living with aids. Kent proceeded to come in and out of my life. It was frustrating. He?d be there for awhile and then he?d be unavailable. I knew it was his way of dealing with his disease, but I found it taking a toll on me emotionally. During Christmas of ?98, I told him how I felt. I asked him to either let me back into his life fully or just shut me out, but quit treating me like a yo-yo. So he let me back into his life fully. The following year, I met his boyfriend, Blaise, who I immediately adored. I could not have found a better match for Kent. He finished his rehab program and went back to work full-time. He was doing well. Meanwhile, Kylie got her momentum back with those gold hot pants and Spinning Around. The album Light Years made her hot again. She had reinvented herself. Kent and Blaise had moved into a house when I saw them during Christmas 2000. They only had mobile phones at this time as they were in hiding from Blaise?s ex-boyfriend, Robert. They believed Robert had set the house that Blaise was renting a room in on fire. Now he was stalking them. Kent had just come from applying for his permit to own a gun before we went to dinner. As I was leaving, I told him I didn?t think the gun was a good idea, but I knew his mind was made up. I hugged him goodbye and there was a bad feeling in my gut. I knew the gun meant trouble. On the evening of January 3, 2001, Donna called me to say that Kent had been killed the night before. Robert had tried to break into the house and Kent went outside with the gun to confront him. If Kent could keep Robert on the premises, the police would be able to do something about the situation. Robert ran for it. Kent went after him. Robert jumped into his Jeep and took off. He hit Kent and drug him for several blocks. Kent died a few moments later. Because death was always a possibility for Kent, he had clear instructions for what he wanted his funeral arrangements to be. Donna and I were to each give a eulogy. I made plans to fly home. I dreaded seeing Kent?s body at the viewing. I had not cried yet and I was terrified that I would choke up when I saw him laying there. I didn?t want to confront my feelings in front of others. It was something I felt more comfortable doing alone. Ironically, I was fine when I saw him. He looked so peaceful laying there in his sweater. I stayed up all night trying to find the perfect words to send off my best friend. I mentioned funny moments and touching moments, but most of all, I saw Kent dancing. He loved country and western dancing. No matter what life threw his way, he could find peace in movement on the dance floor. He was confident and graceful? and immortal. We played The Dance by Garth Brooks. I went to another memorial service that evening. It was people that Kent knew from a church he went to occasionally. These were friends he knew from aids organizations. They were people I didn?t know. They talked about memories that were foreign to me. They laughed at jokes that were not share with me and I hated Kent for that. I was furious with him for hiding from me for all those times when he wouldn?t return my phone calls. I was angry with him for not sharing his life with me when he got sick and when I shared everything with him. Now, our time had run out. I didn?t have any reason to be mad at him, but it?s what I felt at the time. A week later, I was driving home from work and I felt Kent?s presence in the car. Well, I felt his energy. It was more like that. He was checking on me. I told him to go away. There were other people who needed him now. I didn?t want him around me. I was still pissed and I needed time to cool down so I could forgive him. Eventually, I did. I never did cry, but I do feel that I grieved in spite of what anyone else said. Instead, I found myself thinking of things that I wanted to tell Kent only to remember that he was dead and that I could not tell him. A few years later, I visited Blaise at the holidays. He told me that he went with some friends to see a channeller who was making a presentation to a small group. An hour into the meeting, Kent came to her and told her what to say to Blaise. Blaise said he knew it was Kent. Before he left, he told Blaise to tell me hello and that he was okay. Somehow, I believe Blaise. Kylie ended that year with a huge hit in Can?t Get You Out Of My Head and the album Fever. This time there was no one to share it with. I miss Kent. I wish he was still here with me, but I like to think he lives through Kylie?s music. If you want to find him, I would advise you to check the dance floor.

 A CANADIAN PERSPECTIVE ON LESBIAN SEX APPEAL So I asked Joel last night, "Why does seeing two women having sex together turn heterosexual men on?" He kind of smiled with a faraway look in his eyes as if he disappeared into some special place within himself. "Well, I uh.... It's just hot." "I think men find it intriguing," Merideth began. "But they would never act on it." "Why wouldn't they?" I asked. "It's sexier in theory than in reality." "So what do heterosexual women think about watching two men having sex together?" Merideth tilted her head to the side and stared at a box of books across the room as if she was scrying with a crystal ball for the answer. "I'd rather watch two men clean my house and talk about their feelings. That turns me on. Clothes are optional." You learn something new every day.

 HOORAY FOR CHICK-FIL-A As you can probably tell, it's been a busy week. Tonight we took Joel & Merredith to the original Chick-Fil-A Dwarf House restaurant. We went through the dwarf door and had the Chick-Fil-A sandwich platter. They were big hits. We even had peach pie with ice cream. I'm having a lot of fun, but my waist is expanding.

 JUST PINCH ME! I was trying to send a fax when the phone rang. I had already been interupted once before by Erin from Sign-A-Rama and someone calling for Lucilia. "Hello?" I asked abruptly. "Jef?" "Yes?" "This is Mark with Image Film & Video Center and I was just calling to let you know that you are a finalist in the 2004 Perfect Pitch Contest." I smiled. Mark talked on a bit about some important things like when I had to show up on June 19th at the Atlanta Film Festival and some sort of orientation. I was in a daze. "Okay," I began. "I just want to make sure that I heard correctly. So my treatment and first ten pages of my script were chosen for me to pitch my script to the industry professionals at the Atlanta Film Festival." "Yes." It was like my mind was running underwater. Listening took so much effort. Mark said something about needing to make other phone calls and I think he thought I was under the impression that I had won the whole contest or something. I thanked him and got off the phone. I immediately felt like a total dork and then got it over it and I think I actually screamed like a teenage girl, but it came out sounding like a 13-year-old boy whose voice is in the middle of changing. I ran to the front door only to realize that there was no one to tell. I called Jeff, but got his voice mail. I left a little message. I called Mark because he's always accessible and left a message. Merrideth and Joel came home from the MLK Memorial and I told them the news. They were very gracious about the whole thing. I sent out an e-mail out to a few people to let them know, but I didn't feel right posting anything until I received the official e-mail from Mark. I spent the rest of the afternoon trying to concentrate on my work. Someone asked me if I was already dreaming of my first Oscar. This seemed like such an odd thing to even think about. I almost didn't even enter the contest because I didn't have a lot of time and I thought my idea wasn't very good. However, I decided that it was important to go ahead and enter because I was always putting this kind of thing on the "One Day" list because there was always so much other more important stuff to do. I felt so good when I sent my entry off because I finally did something for myself. My friend, Tim, from my writers' group recently found out that he won first place in the O Georgia writing competition. He received right before he left to go to a writing conference and said that it made him officially feel like he was a writer and belonged at the conference. I cannot tell you the difference that I saw in him at the last meeting. Today, I really understood what he felt. It was nice to receive validation that the little markings I put on paper were perceived as worthwhile and valuable. It has seemed like careerwise I have faced a lot of obstacles lately and I can't help but wonder if this is a sign that perhaps writing may be a future career one day. So what's next? I have an orientation to go to at some point where they explain what we need to do. I don't have to show my script until the day of the event, which is good because I haven't finished yet. I pitch, or explain why my movie should be made, to industry professionals on June 19th at the Atlanta Film Festival. This will be done before a live audience, as opposed to a dead one I guess. I have a friend who has some film experience and I'll ask him for some pointers on pitching. I'll need to practice, practice, practice. Three scripts will be chosen to be sent off to industry professionals in New York and LA. They will determine one winner who will be flown to LA to pitch their script to several studios. I can't tell you how honored I feel that my script was one of the ten chosen. Yes, I must admit, it would be nice to win and see my script made into a movie. However, what I want most is to have a script that will make the reader laugh, perhaps shed a tear, but ultimately finish the script feeling satisfied that the character seemed like real people and somehow changed by the story. I want to do good work. Right now, I'm just staying in the moment and feeling thankful.

 AD SPACE So I decided to put an ad in the urlLink Southern Voice to see if would bring me some extra business. I spoke with the account executive, David, and sent him a copy of my business card and a headshot so they could put together a design. I received their comp back on Friday and it didn't even have the company logo on it. In fact, the whole design did not even seem to match the style of our company. So I pulled up Photoshop and Illustrator and got to work. I don't think of myself as much of a graphic designer, but with a little patience, I came up a with an ad that make me very proud. I pulled down the logo from our Web site because our Vice President does not seem to be able to obtain a copy from the designer in an uncorrupted format. I'm just very please with myself. It made me feel like that $17,000 I spent on that Web design degree is finally being put to use. I'm not really thrilled with the headshot. Everyone says that it is a very attractive picture, but I think my hair looks funny and I look odd in a suit. It's definitely not Jef in his natural habitat. Let's hope that it generates some business for me to make it worthwhile.

 CANADIANS IN THE SOUTH The Canadians finally arrived yesterday evening. My friend, Karen, pointed out that in speaking of the Canadians invading the house, it makes it sound like they are an ominous virus descending upon our cell structure. Well, I in no way meant to imply their visit was unwelcome. In fact, I rather like Joel & Merredith. Joel looks somewhat like his brother, Jeff, but for the most part looks very different. He's alittle more laid back too. Merrideth reminds me of prettier Bjork. She is kind of pixie-esque, moves quickly about the house as if she is sprinkling fairy dust around the house and ends most sentences with an upward inflection as if she is always asking a question. I noticed this because this way of speaking is noted in the book, She's Not There , which I am currently reading. More about that later. We walked across the park and had dinner at Dakota Blue last night. Joel & Merrideth thought I was joking when I mentioned the fish tacos, but Merrideth was game enough to try them. Then we came back and crashed. I slept eight and a half hours last night. I normally cannot sleep beyond six or seven hours. However, Jeff and I were exhausted from cleaning. The only thing about impending guests that I regret, is that Jeff and I usually become very irritated with one another about this process. Jeff's idea of cleaning is somewhere just shy of burning the entire village to ensure a complete quaratine of the ebola virus. Places people normally don't look must be deconstructed, sanitized and reconstructed. However, the real cherry on top of my sundae was when he made the comment about my having too much stuff in my bedroom. I slowly looked around the house at the boxes of books and papers and tool boxes and clothes draped over furniture and said, "My stuff is contained in my bedroom. Your combined closet space is four times the size of mine. I am not getting rid of all of my belongings to sastify your sense of order when you are not willing to compromise and give up your own stuff." Five minutes later, he decided that we could compromise by storing some of my stuff in his closet up stairs. I'm usually pretty accommodating about living here and letting him pick out the furniture and decorations he wants. However, this was like when Buddy cornered one of the neighborhood cats in her little box. My claws came out! Things are fine between us now. The amazing thing about love is that even when you hate someone momentarily, you still love them deeply.

 SUNDAY AM I once made a cool mix tape of slow, soothing songs, which contained a lot of overdubs and synths. I started out the tape, or perhaps I ended, with a cool song by Book Of Love entitled Sunday AM . It was written by Lauren and Ted about their memories of hanging out at the Sound Factory with Junior Vasquez until four in the morning. The vocals are pretty sparse, but it's very ethereal. Whenever I heard the track, it would always cause me to pause and literally go to another place. I used to be very good at that. I used to go places through out my day. In the fourth grade, a teacher led excursion to the lunchroom was often being led by Imperial Stormtroopers to interrogation with Darth Vader. "The fools," I thought to myself. "Don't they know I can resist the mind probe." It helped me cope. When did I lose that ability? When did I grow up? I'm beginning to feel that I tap into that again with my writing. I used to sing along to records in the mirror as a kid. It's a shame that I never manifested my lip sync talents into female impersonation, but I never felt so inclined. I have an averstion to ripping duct tape off from between my legs, along with my genitalia. I think we could all use a little more fantasy and mindless excursion in our lives.

 PERFECT PITCH UPDATE I had assumed because I had not heard anything by mid-May that I was not selected as a semi-finalist for the Perfect Pitch Conetest , which is sponsored by Image Film & Video and the Georgia Film Commission . However, I received my weekly Image e-mail and it states they will announce the ten semi-finalists next week since there was a record number of entries this year. How exciting! Of course, I was suddenly hit by a strange bout of self-doubt. My mind is filled with people who have submitted all these action-adventure stories or scripts about single mothers overcoming schizophrenia in order to finish sewing a decent Easter dresses for their daughters. My idea about a little girl who decides to kill her next-door neighbor's boyfriend because she is in love with her next-door neighbor just sounds so aburd. I know it's just the jitters. I think I'm just tired. The important thing is that I actually moved beyond my obsessive-compulsive disorder that makes me feel that I must wash all the dishes and clean the house before I can write and sent in the treatment and first ten pages of the screenplay. I'm sure next year will be even easier. I'd also like to see an example of a good one-page treatment. Keep your fingers crossed for me.

 PEEPING ME I am standing in the bathtub in socked-feet, looking out the small window. No one can see me because the light is off. The only illumination comes from the window on the first floor of the house next door. I shift my weight to the other foot. There is no water in the bathtub. It is empty except for dead leaves from the suicidal fern perched tragically on the edge of the tub. I lean closer and my nose scrapes against the screen, which gently grates off imperfections in the skin on a microscopic level. There is a floor lamp without a shade keeping watch at the open window next door. The spill of light guards against any intruders who might come too close to his castle keep. The concertina wire is imagined, but the barrier seems very real between our houses. I can almost reach out touch the side of his home, but as always, he remains just out of reach. Beside the lamp I see a computer mini-tower and a portion of the back of an easy chair. It appears to be gray or could it be that it has faded with time and use like a groove worn into a much played record? I can't see him, but I hear him blow his nose. Sometimes I hear him vacuum in the middle of the night. The sound is soft and alien in the acoustics between our homes, which make it sound like ghostly moans and chains rattling in the attic. It's like he is trying to erase proof of his existence in order to keep himself secret. He blows his nose again. I continue to listen, but he doesn?t say anything. There is no one else to talk to next door. In fact, I have never heard him speak at all. The first time I saw him was on a blustery March afternoon. He parked his pickup in front of his house as I put my trash can on the curb. He emerged from the truck in an old T-shirt and jeans and his long, stringy hair flowed in the wind like some folliclly-empowered super hero. I said hello. He stopped and turned to me as if I had surprised him. His eyes peered out at me from deep within his weathered face. I looked into them and saw nothing? not even my own reflection. Did I exist in his eyes? He grunted and continued his way up the steps into the dilapidated house. The house is overgrown with ivy, which seems to be invading the house and possibly feeding off it like a parasite. The roof sags dangerously in back and might cave in at any moment. There are no shingles on the side of house facing my window and the reflection from the exposed insulation seems to call to addictive sun-worshippers from miles away. The window remains open even in the cold of winter. How can he live in this squalor next door to my own neatly organized home with the alphabetized spice rack? Who is this man? I have heard that he was a helicopter pilot in the Viet Nam War. He doesn?t talk about it now - period. I have also heard that he did too many drugs during the sixties and seventies. Was it to forget what he refuses to mention? Is this why he refuses to speak at all? It all seems so foreign to someone who can barely remember this war ending as a small child. My memories are relegated to the latter part of the seventies and consist of flashbacks of Farrah Fawcett-Majors and Star Wars . I have heard that he is a carpenter, but this cannot be true. The very idea makes my mind want to implode as I stare at his house that could possibly follow suit at any given moment. I picture him at some local pub, sitting on a bar stool. He drinks whisky and chain smokes cigarettes. He talks to no one, but instead gives his full attention to the small TV mounted over the bar. Depending upon where you are sitting, one half of his face is the dark side of the moon. Someone once told me, though I forget which neighbor it may have been, that this man once bought dog food and cared for the dogs of a sick friend or one that had just died. This makes me like this him. This makes me want to know more about him. One day when I was downtown, I decided to go into the courthouse. I was able to find his full name on his property deed. I wrote it on a piece of scrap paper and keep it in my dresser drawer. It makes me feel triumphant when I look at it. It?s as if I have gotten closer to him without him knowing it. I strain my eyes with more effort to peep into the window below. This seems odd to me because I do so in order to hear better. There are voices, but there is no one else to talk to next door. Is he talking to himself? Has he gone crazy? No, they are voices from the television. I wonder what types of television programs he might watch. I picture big-bosomed lifeguards with long, blonde tresses and red lips jiggling into the surf to save children from drowning. I envision a NASCAR race or footage of cops pulling people over for drunk driving. Maybe he watches game shows. However, I recognize the voice and music. He's watching Public Television. In fact, he's watching a documentary about Australia. The voice tells me that there are more ants in Australia than any other place in the world and there is a wide variety of plant and animal life that can kill a grown man in a matter of seconds. I should be terrified since I am traveling down under in another month, but instead, I smile and think, "I like this guy."

 CAT PERSPECTIVE Last night after the neighborhood association meeting, I came home and made a chicken Caesar salad for dinner. Anytime anyone is the kitchen, Buddy, our cat, will magically appear out of nowhere. The back door was open and she likes to lay in the opening to enjoy the night air as she listens to the sounds of the night. At one point, I sat down next to her and began to pet her. The next thing I knew, I was on my back looking out the doorway and into the night. "This is what she sees," I thought to myself as I glimpsed her little world. The trees were black except for little patches of less dark sky peeking through the leaves. It was interesting.

 WHAT REMIX ARE YOU? Several weeks ago, I was thinking about the differences between remixes today and remixes of yesteryear. In the early eighties, remixes were generally called twelve inch versions or extended version. No one seemed to be particularly interested in the DJ who remixed the track. Francois Kevorkian was quite well known, but it really wasn't until to the mid to late eighties that you began to see big names like Shep Pettibone, Ian Levine, Justin Strauss and Ben Liebrand. They would take the song and keep the essence of it, but might add their own little special twist. Remixes began to have names like "The Hellfire Mix," "Escape From New York Mix" or "The Acid House Remix." Now days, the remixer usually receives credit in the song name, such as "Richard 'Humpty' Vission Return To The Pleasure Dome Remix." That's a short one. Today's remixes rarely even sound like the original song. They are usually very long instrumental versions of the song or they will sample one portion of the song over and over. I agree with my friend, Maggie. I miss words. Give me some lyrics, man! I want to dance along to a song that I recognize. Then I had an idea. If I was going to give myself a remix name right now, what would it be? So I thought about it. Tonight, I would be "The Linda Blair Bad Girl Dub." I've become aware that I have had some repressed anger about a particular situation and I'm feeling good that I'm allowing myself to express it and talk about it. I say that I'm a dub because they typically do not contain all of the lyrics to the song. Today, I feel in touch with the feeling, but I can't adequately put it in words. What would your remix name be?

 THE CANADIANS ARE COMING Jeff informed me that Joel and Merrideth will drive down this weekend from Canada. I can never remember what part of Canada they are in, but I think they are in the same time zone. They may bring their small dog with them. Buddy should find this very interesting since she does not seem to care for any other animal life on the planet except Jeff and I. I don't think she felt well today. She's been laying under my bed all day today. She came out to eat dinner and then laid at my feet while I was working at the dining room table. She did a brief stint in her cat bed, but is now back under my bed. I haven't seen any visible signs of illness. This evening, I spent some time in my bedroom. I laid on my bed and watched the ceiling fan go round and round like a record baby, right round, round, round. I really noticed the mission style light fixture. I wondered if it fell on my in the middle of the night, would it kill me? It's plastic, not glass, but if it got me in the righ spot, would I be a goner? I did some spiritual reading and work this evening and it felt good. I have been meaning to do it for several weeks now, but allowed too many other things to get in the way. I have a sense of satisfaction. Joel and Merrideth are to arrive on Saturday evening, which means that Jeff and I will be doing power cleaning after the home history workshop Saturday morning. So much for waxing my car! I wonder what Canadians eat? Do they do South Beach? It would be so convenient.

 YOU TOUCH MY TA-LA-LA My friend, Tim, sent me the video for the Ding Dong Song by Gunther Levi and the Sunshine Girls. It's very silly in an early 80's way. I believe it's a Swedish group. It also has some male nudity at the beginning. I don't particularly find the lead singer's facial hair flattering. Here are the lyrics: oh, you touch my talala, mm my ding ding dong. la la la la.. Oh, you touch my talala la la la la... mm, my ding ding dong. la la la la...

 LIST YOURSELF Troy knows that my answer for almost everything is to make a list. I enjoy making lists. They give me clarity. There is something about committing thoughts to paper that puts forces into motion in the Universe that makes things happen. Each day, I make a list of the things I need and want to do. It's amazing how much more you accomplish each day when you have a written plan.

 YOU GOTTA HAVE... FAITH? Johnny asked me about my faith this evening. We were sitting on the porch in our white wicker furniture. He had an adult-refreshing beverage in his hand and Phi's dog, Taylor, lay at his feet. Jeff was cleaning books and I had ventured out to check on him after watching the E True Hollywood Story about Whitney Houston while I clipped coupons. I'll say it again, "She's wack!" Johnny said that he is itching to have faith. He wants to feel it. He wants to believe in it. If you could buy it at Target, he might have two bottles in his shopping cart. How do you explain what faith is? I suggested that first, you must be willing to be open to cultivating a relationship with God, the Universe or a Creator. Secondly, it is a relationship that requires work each day. You wouldn't ignore your wife each day. You talk with her. You share with her. You spend time with her. As the relationship grows, you develop trust and faith in God. I'm not sure that this helped him. He gave me a book that he ordered from Amazon.com about becoming a Christian. He asked me to read it and tell him how it ends. I told him I'd do that just as soon as I finish reading the book about the English professor who had a sex change. He wanted to know how I could console my sexuality with my faith and I told him that he was assuming that my faith found my sexuality unacceptable, when in fact my faith celebrates my sexuality. This threw him for a loop. Johnny fetched his guitar and sang us a new song he wrote. He had a dream that he was a teenage girl dying alone in a hospital. It was so powerful that when he woke up, he was crying. He wrote a song about it. He started the song several times, but never finished it. Instead, he played the music on his guitar, which was quite nice. He showed me the lyrics. They were sad lyrics about dying alone. He then became embarrassed about his lyrics. During the course of our conversation, I was baking hamburgers in the toaster oven. I also baked some sweet potato fries. They were both very delicious. I have decided that I now make the best hamburger in Atlanta. I did my reading and exercises for my Quest class for this week. Ironically, it was about praying for others. I think I will pray for Johnny tonight and that itch he wants to scratch so badly.

 PRAYING FOR TIME I have never been known for saying I have too much time on my hands and lately I have been evaluating where I have been spending my time. I volunteer for the neighborhood association as secretary, the neighborhood historical committee and the Moth Ball planning committee, which is a local fundraiser. I also participate in the Atlanta Gay Writers group. I volunteer for things at church from time to time as well as Image when they need volunteers for film festivals. In addition, I try to exercise in some capacity every day, albeit I have been off somewhat this week since I think I pulled my hamstring. I've been working out my upper body, but have tried to let my left leg recover as quickly as possible. With work and things that need to be done around the house, it doesn't leave a whole lot of time left for me to write, work on programming the new blog and explore drawing and painting again. I am going to be involved in Jeff's used book store to some degree. I believe I will be managing the on-line sales, which I think will be kind of fun. This will take some time and it has made me realize that I need to figure out what committments I need to maintain and those that I need to let go of. Right now, writing is very important and I would like to get involved with film and video again. At church this morning, we were discussing prayer in my Quest Class. The book we are reading states that the best prayer is basically meditation whereby we increase our awareness of God. I questioned how we are supposed to pray for others if this was the case and it was shared with me that in those situations we should see the divinity in those people made whole and not to focus on illness or conflict. In other words, if someone is in the hospital, we affirm that they are already healed and recovered. We went on to discuss that when we spend a few minutes in silence and focusing on God, that it shifts our energy and the type of experiences and people that we attract. Some of us were concerned about the uncertainty of knowing what action to take in our lives when we are focusing on being and not doing, but I feel that if we are going down the wrong path, we will receive a feeling in prayer/meditation of which way we are supposed to go. Ironically, I was reading a review of a book about Dante in the newspaper this morning and it stated that Dante believed that we should only have one passion that we worked toward. Granted, that one passion should be to know God, but we usually have one gift or desire that captures our attention and we should focus on that gift or desire with all our heart and soul. Now I just need to figure out what that one passion is for me. I think I need to pray for more time: to do all the things I want to do; and delay making any uncomfortable decisions about what I need to let go of.

 I HAVE FOUND IT Tony, Thom, Jeff and I went to see urlLink Kandukondain, Kandukondain [I Have Found It] at the urlLink High Museum tonight, which was presented by urlLink Cinema India! It was a Bollywood retelling of Jane Austen's Sense & Sensibility set in modern day India. I understand that the one of the main actreses was a Ms. World and now lip syncs in Bollywood musicals. She did a totally Natalie Wood. [Natalie Wood lip synced to another actress's vocal in West Side Story .] It's about two sisters who want to get married. One sister's future husband kills himself over a white nurse in America. She seems to be cursed and everyone always talks about what bad luck she has. The other sister continually tries to cheer her up by bursting into song and disappearing into fields of grain and dancing around with a bunch of what appear to be native Africans and some Japanese performance artists. Eventually, she catches the eye of a young film-maker who promises to return to marry her after he directs his first film, which is about a runaway train that cannot stop or a bomb will go off. [Does this sound familiar?] Meanwhile, the other sister wants to be wooed with poetry. Instead she charms a bitter, drunken war vetran with one leg. Enraptured with her beautiful voice, he gives her a tabula and challenges her to learn music. She does. However, she soons is caught in a rainstorm with a young, successful investor banker who just happened to be floating down the river singing ancient poetry. She sprains her ankle and he carries her home, singing to her all the way. Grandpa dies and the house is willed to the son who left him over ten years ago. It seems grandpa had been trying to tell the ladies to open the chest in order to change the will since his daughter and granddaughters had been caring for him all of these years. The brother and sister-in-law decide to take the house and drive their sister and nieces away to the city. The non-singing daughter gets a job as a receptionist and soon becomes a junior programmer after finding the answers to the coding problems in the program the company had been working on for weeks. The other sister finds her investor whose company is about to go under. They are suddenly transported to Scotland where they sing a little ditty in kilts. The actor looks strikingly like Phil Oakey from the Human League and the actress's facial expressions remind me of Grace from Will & Grace . Eventually, he marries a politician's daughter to save his company and the sister falls down a man hole and almost drowns. Luckily, the one-legged man was in a nearby bar and saves her. [I presume he was just having a coffee since he embraced sobriety for this girl.] Fortunately, she had just recorded some songs before the manhole incident and she has become the next Madonna while in her coma. Meanwhile, the young film-maker is too busy to talk to the other sister because he is making his action movie with a female action star who falls in love with him during a musical number on boat. She asks him to drop her off at an awards show on the back of his moped and it makes all the scandal sheets. Naturally, the girlfriend jumps to conclusions and decides to transfer to the American office. At the same time, the one-legged man tries to fix up the singing sister with a buff water polo star who seems to be the only man who knows how to use a razor in this movie. She rejects him and confesses her love for the unidexter. The film-maker finishes his movie and returns to marry the sister whose bags are packed for California. She cries and will not let him in because he changed the name of the movie she picked out because he thought it would bring him bad luck. He goes outside and sees her on the balcony. He asks her to marry him and incredibly she finally lightens up and says, "Yes." The sisters get married. Roll credits. I enjoyed the movie. On the way out, we shared an elevator with three Indians. I asked if they liked the movie and they said yes. They asked if I thought the movie was long. I told them I didn't find any movie long after the last Lord Of The Rings movie. A long uncomfortable silence followed and then we all got off the elevator.

 ASK BUDDY THE CAT My cat has offered to answer all of your questions about life, love and whatever else ails you. Please visit her blog, urlLink Ask Buddy The Cat - The Tao Of Meow and ask her a question.

 A NIGHT ON THE TOWN WITH THE BOYS Last night Kiki, Shawn and I went to dinner at The King And I restaurant. It's a Thai restaurant and I had some great mango chicken, which sounds like some wild and wacky dance from the 50's. "More tequila please!" We ran into my good friend, Ryan, which I have not had the opportunity to get to know as much as I like. We had been planning to go get some coffee. He'd sent his phone number to me and when I tried to reply back with mine, my e-mails kept being returned as undeliverable. I thought to myself, "Great Scott! I've been spaminated!" In actuality, I think it's probably a server issue. I never bothered to call Ryan because I kept thinking that it would clear up soon and I kept trying periodically. In the end, I gave him my phone number at the restaurant. I also had the pleasure of meeting his very polite friend whose name escapes me due to the onset of my short-term memory loss. "Color me Dory!" After dinner, we piled into Shawn's Volvo and headed to urlLink Compound for the swimwear fashion show that Kiki's friend, Eric, was in. Kiki is an aspiring fashion designer and Eric was one of his models for one of his fashion shows. Eric seems fascinated by Kiki's gayness. From what Kiki has told me, I gather that it's sort of like urlLink Lion Country Safari where you drive the park and look at the baboons, but without the safety of a window. Kiki picked up copies of urlLink David Magazine for all of us with Eric on the cover. It's a new design and look for the magazine and the fundraiser was coinciding with the launch of David' s new look. "What am I supposed to do with this?" I asked. "We'll take them with us when we go back stage to see Eric!" "I'm not asking for an autograph." As a side note, I have to say that Shawn has good musical taste. We listened to Tom Jones, Xymox and Sunscreem during the course of the evening. That said, we'll return back to our story. We arrived at Compound and decided to do valet parking due to the urban wasteland quality of the surrounding area. We pulled up in the parking lot; a tattooed boy in a windbreaker ran out, got in the car, turned the steering wheel and drove it four feet into a parking space. He handed the keys back to Shawn and Kiki and I paid the guy $7.00. It felt like valet-lite. We walked to the club and I had to tell the boys not to walk so fast with my pulled hamstring. "Hey! Hey! Hey! Wait up for Tiny Tim, will ya!" We waited in line and I noticed that the girl working the velvet rope used to own the salon where Randy cut my hair. She seemed really happy doing what she's doing now, which I imagine is exactly what she should be doing, if anything could really make her happy. She has perfected the look of the nonplussed Asian-American girl. In the brief moments I have interacted with her, she was always pleasant, but seemed as if she would be happier somewhere else. If that was my personality, I would invest in one of those butterfly vibrators that you can wear all day long - while at the office, the tennis court, dancing, ironing, etc. At least it would make me feel that even though I'm doing things for other people, I'm still doing something for myself as well. It's a win-win situation. A feisty redhead welcomed us to club. "Are you virgins?" She asked with great half-interest. "Why yes," I replied. "Do we get to be thrown into the volcano?" Unfortunately, there was no volcano, but it was a fantastic piece of architecture. There is a little covered area when you walk in. Then it becomes an open courtyard with a fountain/cement pond. There are little Eastern stone bridges over little rock streams. Blue lights are everywhere. If I was a pharmaceutical salesman, I would hold all my meetings about antidepressants there. Inside there is a kitchen with an island/counter proceeding out from one wall. It serves as a bar. There is an open living room with video of waves crashing on the shore projected on each wall. We sat down on modern chairs that were made out of that can cuzi material. It cupped your body so that you leaned way back and your legs sort of splayed apart. It was very Sex And The City as well as perfect for an OBGYN. There was a brooding Latin guy nursing a longneck across from me. He kept looking at me the whole time. I smiled once at him in an effort to be friendly, but it seemed to produce some reaction in him that may have been lust or rage. Having produced a completely opposite effect than I had wanted, I decided it might be best to look at what was going on around me. I was amazed at the number of people who looked absolutely plastic. I'm not exaggerating. They looked airbrushed. I thought I sort stuck out with my tan shorts and Charlie Brown-style shirt, but I didn't really care. I was also impressed with the number of people my own age and older that I saw out because you hear all the time about how when gay men get older they disappear into the suburbs. I think Atlanta has a very active mid-life generation. Granted, it wasn't a club per se, but more of a bar with atmosphere and music. The music was rather lively. Everything sounded like a Robbie Rivera diskofied version of theme songs from 70's TV shows. My favorite was the Stardust-inspired version of the theme from The Price Is Right . Shortly after we arrived, we found Dave and Stuart. I've known them both since I moved to Atlanta on May 16, 1996. Dave was one member of the infamous David Posse that my co-workers joked about. I had five different friends named David at the same time and they were referred to as David 1, David 2, David 3, David 4 and David 5. When my co-workers asked what I did for the weekend, it was always interesting. I met Dave on a water skiing trip and I remember admiring his chest and wishing mine was that perky. Stuart accosted me at a pool party for reading someone's tarot cards for fun. I thought they were going to have to put him in a straight jacket. I have gone on several hiking trips with urlLink Wilderness Network of Georgia since then and have had a very pleasant time with him. At one point, I wandered around by myself and ran into an old boyfriend. I can't say that we ever dated in the traditional sense. We went to dinner and movies at times, but our relationship was primarily a physical one. It was like two kids playing together and exploring their bodies and pushing the boundaries. There was a sense of fun and delight to it. However, we never really had much else in common on which to base a relationship. It was casual. I suppose it was a serial hook-up in today's vernacular. Anyway, he looked good and is doing well. He always smiles so big at me that I can't help but smile back. We still have a connection, but it's hard to describe what it is. I assume it has to do with the fact that we have very good memories attached to one another. We're both in relationships now, but he has paired himself with someone without much of a sex drive. He asked me if Jeff and I are monogamous and I told him we were. He asked if this was Jeff's decision and I told him it was a decision we made together. However, my choice to honor that commitment is my own. He asked me if I thought less of him for suggesting it. I told him no. I was flattered and he and his boyfriend needed to do what worked best for them and if that included an open relationship, so be it. He kissed my cheek, hugged me tight and then slipped away into the sea of faces. I saw him look back once and he was gone. I caught up with the guys in the building in the back. There were 19 flat panel monitors on the wall. We couldn't figure out if they were real or if the images were projected on them. If they were real, the cost was staggering. They were showing underwater footage that had to be computer-generated. The camera perspective on the swordfish was too perfect. No diver could have kept up with it. After waiting until 11:00pm, the show finally started and I turned my attention away from the hair on the guy beside me. I was fascinated by its ability to defy gravity. Since the show was running so late, I reached in my pocket to call Jeff, but realized I had left my cell phone on my desk when I went to check on the cat before I left. All night long, I thought I could feel it vibrating in my pocket like amputees who can feel the pain of extremities that are no longer there. Eric came out and strutted his stuff down the runway. If ever I suspected his was gay, it would be from the way he works the stage. He was in touch with his Inner Diva . I don't mean in a bitchy way, but in an in control way. He shifted his weight. He spun around like Michael Jackson. He sashayed and he shartayed. He did it all and the crowd ate it up. I had forgotten just how huge he was. He's very tall and just built. He has huge shoulders and arms and legs and tiny waist. I was very concerned about the models walking in flip flops because it seemed like they would be hard to walk in, but no one fell. At one point, a drag queen came and stood in front of me and almost wiped me out with her wig. I was almost done in by the overpowering smell of her hairspray. Soon the show was over and I waited while the boys went back stage to say hello to Eric. It was too crowded for me. Everyone had fun and Kiki made a professional contact. "You need to hurry up and become famous so we can meet Ashley Judd," I told him. As we walked out I asked Shawn if he wanted me to go get the car so that he could at least feel that it was truly valet parking. He considered, but then said it wasn't necessary as we walked off into the night. "Hey! Hey! Hey! Wait up for the lame boy!"

 HOW DO I FEEL? This week has been a strange week. I have felt like a Japanese Godzilla film. I feel somewhat out-of-sync with the world as if other people's lips move and then the sound follows shortly after. It's not good or bad. It just is. I've become quite comfortable with that concept as of late. Careerwise, I have felt somewhat as if everything I have done has been a struggle this week. I finally found a program and a rate that made my client happy and then contract fell through. Now they are looking for a new house. It's not the end of the world, but I had everything set. I had a feeling of accomplishment. If I believed in curses, I would say that I'm living under one that delays every loan I work on. However, I don't believe in curses. My other loan that has been pending since March will finally close Friday. I know my customer will be happy. It's been a trial at times for him. It will be nice to be paid too. I'm going with Kiki (that sounds sooo gay) and Shawn to see Eric model at some bar near the King Plow Art Center. Kiki said Eric will be on the cover of urlLink David Magazine too. He's a nice kid. I won't be home until 11:00pm and I haven't had a nap today to recover from waking up at 5:00am. After the PowerCore meeting, I finally had some time to reorganize my desk. It had gotten out of hand. Order and balance are important in my life. There is so much I want to do, but I just don't feel very motivated do anything. I feel half-focused on everything. I think I may just need sleep.

 CONNECTIONS With each passing year, I come to believe with more certainty that things happen in our lives for a reason. This afternoon, I was feeling somewhat affected by a general weirdness in the office. Things have been tense lately. I'm not sure of all of the details. Our appointment with the realtor in North Canadian Georgia was canceled. I prepared for my meeting with the condo client. I finally found a way to make the numbers work, but the rate was 7%. I knew she was rate sensitive, but with her amount of debt and the adjustments for a high rise condo, this was the best I could do. As I was driving to the appointment, I started paying attention to how I was feeling and I discovered a great well of doubt. This confused me somewhat because I have been feeling as things have been going well. I started speculating if I was in the right profession. I called Jeff to hear his voice to get me back on track. We spoke for a few minutes and he reminded me that in every line of work, there are good days and bad days. I got off the phone determined to go in there and give my best. If I got the loan, great. If not, what have I really lost? It then dawned on me that perhaps the purpose of this appointment was not to get the loan, but the experience. This seemed to make my inner ding go off. I met the client. She was very charming and had a beautiful office. We went over her credit report and she began telling me which debts should be included and which ones should not. When I asked why, she told me that the company pays these debts. When I asked why the company would pay these personal debts she replied that the funds were used for the company. I asked her again if she was self-employed. She said no. Why then, I asked, would she use personal funds for the company. She replied that she owned the business. I qualified her position as self-employed, but she corrected me. She didn't seem to get the concept that to own a company is to be self-employed. The remainder of the appointment continued along the same lines. She told me my rate was too high even though I showed her the rate sheet and explained how I arrived at the rate. It would be interesting to know what rate she finally ends up with. In my opinon, she shouldn't buy the condo to begin with. She already has too much debt. In the end, she complimented me on my work and professional manner and she was a pleasure to meet. Perhaps I will hear from her again, but her accounting still makes me quiver. I was reading urlLink Mindful Threads tonight and Gregory wrote about throwing away old momentos. Joan and I had a conversation tonight about letting go of things we no longer needed, which reminded me of the connection theory. It's got me thinking.

 READY, SET, GO! It seems as if every second of my day has been filled lately. Business seems to be good after my dry spell where all of my closings were pushed back a month. New loans and opportunities are coming to me. It's taking a little more effort to keep balanced. I got a good night's sleep last night and went over to Kiki's house in Inman Park to swim. The official Inman Park Pool is behind the townhome he shares with, I guess I will call him Didi since I have been instructed to use these ridiculous code names. We went to the locker room and I slipped into the trusty Speedo. I bought a new one last year because the old one had worn out and I was quite shocked when I got out of the water and there was no imagination left to what was between my legs. The new Speedo is very modest. It gives the impression of being as unisex as a stick of a gum. Although International Male may seem a very different impression, the purpose of a Speedo is to allow you to swim without drag and not simply optic foreplay. It was a bit chilly this morning and I slid into the water slowly. Once I was in and moving, it wasn't bad. The lessons from last night were a bit foggy. I'll have to review them again, but I found the strokes and drills from last summer coming back to me. I found my "sweet spot" easily and I must say I could probably continue with that drill all day. It's not tiring in the least. It really does feel like I am moving effortlessly through the water. The Slimfins are awesome. I have never had such a great pair of fins. They make you work your legs more and provide more control. They are also much smaller and actually fit in my gym bag. I'm meeting Karen for lunch today and then driving to North Canadian Georgia to meet a realtor in a subdivision with Carol Lynn and Robert. I hope it's productive. I am supposed to meet my client with the condo in the afternoon to take an application. I need to do my research on that Wells Fargo loan that doesn't exist this morning. I hate it when unethical mortgage people sell rates and programs that don't actually exist. They think once they get them in the office, they can talk them into another program and rate and then they refuse. the continue to wander around the moors lookly for a ghostly sign of this mythical rate and loan program. All in all, it's a good exercise in staying focused on purpose and not judging or whining. See ya later, sports fans!



 I REBUKE THEE, MONDAY What a day! I met with the realtor in my PowerCore group this morning for coffee. She is married to a mortgage broker so she doesn't give mortgage leads, but we got to know each other a little bit and came up with some other ways we can work together. We found that we actually share a lot of the same values. I went by Barnes & Noble to look at some books on SQL & PHP before my lunch meeting. I skimmed through a few that answered some questions I have. I need to contact my Web hosting service. I went to lunch with the insurance guy from my PowerCore group. I have a good idea of all the different services he offers. He explained how people cash out life insurance policies today. It was quite interesting. We are all way too under insured. I came home and looked through the pre-qualifications I received from several of the lenders I sent the application and credit report from Friday. I was actually suprised the rates were so low. The client thought they were high. I have one more lender I'm expecting a pre-qual from tomorrow. I received a lead from a client purchasing a condo for half a million. She was very pleasant. I pulled credit after I got off the phone with her and she has a lot of debt. Most lenders will not approve a loan if your monthly debts are over 50% of your monthly gross income and this client makes quite a bit of money. There are adjustments on the rate because (a) it's a condo, (b) it's over five stories tall, (c) the loan amount is over $333,000 and is referred to as a "jumbo," and (d) we'll probably have to state her income instead of showing income on the loan application. Evidently she seems to know something that I don't because she told me that wasn't correct. We're supposed to meet tomorrow. This should be interesting. I quit working about 8:00pm and went to the gym. The little red-haired girl was there and she handed me a towel as I walked in. I almost said to her, "Oh you nasty girl," but I didn't. I did an upper body workout. I pulled a muscle in my leg last week and I've finally stopped limping. It feels much better, but I thought it was better to refrain from doing my leg workout for another two days. When I left, the little red-haired girl smiled at me again. For some reason, it makes me smile in spite of myself. Maybe she's making me straight. "We want you! We want you! We want you as a new recruit!" I came home and caught up on a few of the blogs. I really haven't had time to read them lately. I never read Spam Poetry. I think I should remove her from my honor roll. It's nothing against her. I just think I should give someone else some attention now. I think I may remove Belle De Jour too. She doesn't blog much anymore and I forget to check her. I went over to Kiki's house and we watched the Total Immersion video on Freestyle and backstroke. It's a fascinating concept for learning Masters swimming. It's all about getting slippery in the water and being more fish-like. This week, we are working on finding our balance in the water and then our "sweet spot," which is a place of perfect balance and comfort in the water. There is one guy in the video who has the body that I want. He is lean and fit and has a tattoo. Kiki and I are meeting at the pool at 7:45am tomorrow to swim. I don't like cold water. I must approach in three stages: submerge to testicle level; submerge to nippled level; and finally, head under water. I suppose "rudder man" will be there. He's a nice guy, but he always starts to get an erection next to me in the showers when we are alone. Fortunately, I just start asking him how work is going or how his kids are and he deflates. He can't talk and be aroused at the same time. I find that it gives me a sense of control over at least some aspect of my life. Kiki doesn't help the situation. One morning I left my shampoo in the shower and had to go back into the shower. It's very awkward reaching around Kiki as he is performing oral sex on rudder man. Furthermore, it's one of those social settings where you don't know where to look. What experience do you have in this department? It's not like there is a Norman Rockwell painting to refer back to for guidance like "Rusty Inspires The Football Team On The 50-Yard Line" or "Johnny Shows His Team Spirit." Another friend says that I attract these situations. "Maybe you get something out of it." Safe to say that I was able to retrieve my shampoo before I actually did get something out of it. I am sure it would have washed off, but I prefer that people keep bodily fluids and appendages to themselves, thank you very much.

 I AM SO EMBARRASSED I was reading Gregory's blog, urlLink Mindful Threads , this afternoon. He posted his answers to one of those e-mails with all the questions. Question 16 was where you own a home if you could own one in any place in the world. Gregory answered Sydney, Australia. Now, anyone who knows me knows that I have been planning to own a condo there since I first visited in 2001. When I read it, a strange gay sound issued forth from my mouth. It was unlike anything I have ever uttered before. I looked around me and found myself alone. The cat was outside. I felt very embarrassed and I think I may have turned red.

 MOTHER'S DAY IN REVIEW Last night Donald, my friend from Art School, came over with his girlriend, Julie. I love Donald and Julie. They are two of my most favorite straight people in the world. In fact, they are two of my favorite people in the world in general. If I had a brother, I would want him to be like Donald. He's just a really nice guy. He kind of reminds me of Jeff in that they both are always eager to help other people and do the right thing. We went to Six Feet Under, the little fish pub across from historic Oakland Cemetery, and had dinner. The night was beautiful and we had a nice dinner and a lovely conversation. This morning Jeff and I got up and made a salad to take to lunch at his parents' house. I went to church and then drove down to the south side. We had a nice lunch and sat around the table laughing and enjoying ourselves. They really do seem like my family. I really like them and I guess they like me too. I sometimes wonder how they would feel if they knew about my relationship with Jeff. Part of me thinks they have to suspect a little at least, but then sometimes denial can do amazing things. Jeff is not comfortable sharing this part of his life with them. I knew that from the beginning and I accept that. I got back home about five o'clock and read the Sunday paper and a manuscript a friend is working on about her abusive ex-husband and chronic fatigue syndrome. I spent an hour working on the new blog and the whole mySQL and PHP may take a little more research than I have time to put into it right now. I may have to reschedule this for June. I'm a little disappointed, but I'm doing a much better job of setting my priorities these days. I need to spend some time working on the screenplay this week so I may just do one post a day each day.

 CHANGING PERCEPTIONS My friend, Charles, sent me urlLink this link , which refers to a conversation we had last week regarding gay Asian men being down on the gay desirability food chain. The threads on this link seem to imply that gay Asian men are soft, submissive and effeminate. This seems strange to me because one of the first gay Asian Americans I knew was very masculine and proactive. I believe that if we choose to accept certain beliefs, we will continue to draw experiences to us that affirm those beliefs. However, if we choose to reject these beliefs, we must replace them with a new belief. Therefore, we must have a clear idea of what beliefs we want to manifest for ourselves. Therefore, if Charles chooses to create new beliefs about how he will be perceived as a gay Asian American, he must have a clear idea of how he wants to be perceived. What are your thoughts on this theory?

 WIDE OPEN SPACES Today we finished painting the newly patched hole in the ceiling where the leak from the upstairs shower was. Jeff repainted the entire wall. The hardwoods have been mopped with Murphy's oil. The furniture has been moved back in place. I'm shocked at the amount of room in the den now. It almost feels like a ball room. It fills me with hope and possibility. Jeff was frustrated today by the amount of things he feels he needs to do. He made a few comments today that were not very loving. He didn't mean them. He was just frustrated, but in the sting of the remark, you can't help wonder what really lurks in the wide open spaces between those comments. You can drive yourself crazy analyzing these situations, but I decided a long time ago to be strong, hold my head high and say, "Fuck it!" My stoic response was to fold his laundry, take it upstairs and put it away. Getting angry never solves anything. He didn't mean it. As a result, we had a very nice evening. We human beings are funny creatures.

 PERFECT TIMING So Tacy calls tonight and she asks, "Do you remember that story you told me about Louise Hay last month?" "Which one?" "The one where she looked for an apartment for six months when she moved to L.A., but she couldn't find anything she liked. When she finally did, she found out that the builder had just broken ground on her perfect apartment when she moved to L.A. It wasn't ready for her when she started looking." "Yeah, I remember that. I think about that story a lot when I feel anxious about trying to make something happen." "Well, I applied for a promotion." "Terrific!" "Remember the new GLBT group at my company that I told you about?" "Didn't you go to the first meeting last month?" "Yes, I did. I was asked to share my coming out story at this month's meeting. I started talking about Kim being in D.C. and me being here. Well, the CEO of our company came to the meeting as the keynote speaker and after listening to my story, he told me, 'There is no reason with today's techonology why you and your family should be separated.' I don't know what he did, but I got the promotion. I'll work in Chicago four days a week and then fly to D.C. Thursday night and work from home on Friday." "Tacy, that's fantastic! I'm so happy for you." "There's more. Kim and I have had some good heart to heart talks over the past month and we've worked things out. In fact, she's going to come out to her family over the Memorial Day Weekend." "Wow. That's huge. What brought this on?" "I told her that I can't be just a roommate after nine years and she agreed." "Wow. Are you going to be there with her when she tells her family?" "I will if she wants me to. I'll support her in whatever way I can. Hey! Why don't y'all come up for July 4th to D.C.?" "Jeff will be on his missionary trip, but I think I might be able to come up for that." "That would be awesome." "Damn straight!" "You know, you were right." "What do you mean?" "When I was down because I couldn't find a job in D.C., you said that maybe it's because the right job wasn't available yet and maybe it was being created." "Ooh... I did say that, didn't I?" "That's exactly what happened. It also gave Kim and I time to think and talk about our relationship. I'm not sure if we would still be together if we hadn't had this time apart." Silence. "Are you still there?" "Yeah. I'm just taking it all in. It's pretty amazing when you think about it. I mean, the way the Universe works." "I am so thankful. Everything happened in the perfect time and in the perfect way." "Your good fortune inspires me to believe that the same thing will happen with some things I'm waiting on too." "It'll happen man." "I'm glad y'all worked things out. I didn't want my favorite lesbians splitting up. At least not before y'all go to work at the chocolate factory." "You're crazy!" "Yeah."

 SOMETHING INTERESTING THIS WAY COMES A friend sent me a link to urlLink SHOWStudio . Click on the Link for Lyric . It will take you to some video projects made with celluar phones by some celebrities. Kylie Minogue has collaborated with two others for the lyric to Copacabana . It's very different.

 DELIGHTFUL, DELOVELY, DECLUTTER I have made some progress with my desk and bedroom, but I still have these papers that I'm shuffling through and boxes of stuff that I don't know what to do with. Some of the papers and some of the items in the box I need to keep, but I must find a place for them. I've been devoting an hour to this process each day, but I wish it would go faster. I'm very dedicated to my "power hour." I keep thinking that I would be so much happier if my life were much simplier and sparser. Why can't I be a monk in Sri Lanka and just have a begging bowl and an umbrella and be happy with that? Instead, I received the GLX-2800, which will allow me to digitize my vinyl and cassette collection. It's an attractive little mixer and it will indeed allow me to release some of the excess vinyl and cassettes that I have, but it's still one more thing that I own now that takes up space. Does the physical clutter in my life reflect the mental clutter of negative thinking and false beliefs that are sprinkled about my mind? I sometimes close my eyes and picture myself in loose fitting cotten pants and a matching top, perhaps in a flattering, serene cyan, and closely cropped hair. I wander about the ashram meditating here, meditating there. I focus on my breathing and I don't feel any regret that Kylie Minogue's third single from Body Language will be one of my least favorite songs of all. It doesn't disturb my inner peace. A friend called this evening. During the course of the conversation, he asked, "Should I shave all of my pubic hair off again?" "Hmmm... that seems like a person decision. I cannot make that for your grasshopper." "I know, but it's a lot of work." He inhaled on his cigarette and then exhaled. "I just feel so much neater with a smooth dick and balls." "Doesn't it irritate you when the hair starts to grow back in?" "No," he replys incredulously as if it never occured to him that anyone would ask so stupid a question. "It makes me feel in control and like everything is in order in my life." The strength of his reply was so assured, that for a moment, I contemplated marching to the bathroom to grab my razor, but I was distracted by an orange on the way.

 BONDING OVER BEIGNETS I met Holly and Larry from my PowerCore group at urlLink Crescent City Beignets this morning for breakfast. The purpose of our meeting was to get to know each other and find out more specifics about our professions and the clients we are looking for. The big joke was that today was urlLink International No Diet Day . Somehow I ordered three beignets. I was hoping Holly might eat one, but she just drank water. Damn her holistic hide! At first, we just started to get to know one another. Holly is a massage therapist at a yoga facility. She looks as if she came from Minnesota with her fair skin and blonde hair. She seems "all natural." Larry is an older fellow. He has a dark complexion and glasses and looks as if he should be running a business in New York. We began talking about business and at some point during the conversation, I let out my inner talk show host and began asking some very directed questions. What kind of conditions can you treat with massage that most people would not think about? When a customer comes to you for service, what should they expect? What's it like to do business with you? What kind of customers do you like working with? What's your favorite thing about your job? At one point during our meeting, I looked up at Larry and then back at Holly and you could tell in their eyes that we were all cognizant of something magical going on. We were connecting on levels that went beyond business and we found some commonalities in spite of all of our differences. It was a very pleasant feeling.

 ONCE UPON A SUMMER.... Last night I remembered being 12 years old. We lived in Waco and it was one of my favorite summers between 6th and 7th grade. We lived in a house on Bellaire Drive, but for some reason I refused to spell it correctly. I think I spelled it Belair because that is the way it was spelled on a box of frozen fish fillets that I saw each week in the freezer at Safeway. For the longest time, I wasn't allowed to ride my bike any further than up and down my block. Eventually I expanded my territory to the full lenth of the street, but there was an invincible force field that would not allow me to venture onto our neighboring streets. In the summer of 1980, I broke through that barrier. I began riding my mother's bike, which was a masculine looking three-speed, and I was exhilerated as I rode down Topeka Street as fast as I could. At some point, my friend, Kurt, and I rode over to the edge of the neighborhood where they were building new houses. There were fields of giant sunflowers there. I had never seen sunflowers like this before and I wanted to get off my bike and run through them, but I couldn't leave my mother's bike on the side of the road by itself. Plus, the dark, thick interior of sunflower stalks was intimidating. What might lurk in there? Sometimes we would ride up to the 7-11 and get a slurpee. I bought my first chocolate chip cookie/ice cream sandwich there. It was a time of Star Wars trading cards and Pop Rocks. There were trails near our house and I used to love to run up and down them in the woods. It was an adventure. Sometimes we used to cut through them while walking home from school. One day we found some pages from an adult magazine there. It was a woman with long dark hair and a dark-haired man with a moustache. The woman shaved his moustache off and then there was a picture of her supposedly shaving his pubic hair off. It was all very softcore. The text talked about shaving his nether regions and it made me go home and look it up in the dictionary. Therefore, I can truly say it was an educational experience. The pictures made me feel funny, but I was unable to put my finger on what it was that I felt. I had nothing to compare it too yet. We threw the pages away to prevent younger kids from finding it. We thought we were doing a good thing, but I thought about those pages from time to time over the summer. Most of all, I remember the big mimosa tree in our front yard. In the early part of summer, the skies became very beautiful. Huge rolling clouds could be seen in the sky in various shades of peach, pink and purple. They would roll in from down the street where Lake Waco was. I used to think they were reflections of the waves from the coast frozen as reflections in the sky. I would sit in the tree and watch the clouds for hours.

 EARLY MORNING I woke up at 5:30am for this week's PowerCore meeting. In spite of my fear that I will sleep through the alarm, I don't seem to have a problem waking up or arriving on time. The meeting went well. The members got a kick out of my sexy mortgages. It may be my new tag line. I had breakfast with Dr. J., the chiropractor and Mike, the actor and motivational speaker. I'm having coffee and lunch with a lot of people between now and the next meeting so we can know more about what we each do. I prefer coffee to lunch. It's more flexible. Besides, I don't like people to watch me eat in a business setting. It kind of makes me feel like one of those Iraqui prisoners forced to masturbate before female soldiers. It's been a busy day. I went into the office for awhile and did some research. Carol Lynn and Bonnie loved my affinity program letter and they are going to use it also. Tuesday, Carol Lynn, Robert and I are driving to North Canadian Georgia to meet with a realtor in a subdivision. I think one of us is going to be in the subdivision at all times to get the loan business. I'm waiting for more details, but I'm concerned about how many days a week I will have to be there, specifically on weekends. There isn't much flexibility with just two people. I feel like I've been up forever.

 INSPIRATION FROM THE ODDEST PLACES I received the new issue of Entertainment Weekly on Saturday and was looking through it while I ate lunch. It's one of my guilty pleasures. It's the only way that I appear to know about Friends even though I never watch TV. There was an interesting article in there about Dr. Sharon Mitchell, a former porn star and drug addict. After being attacked by a crazed fan in 1996, she went back to school and got her PhD in human sexuality and opened the Adult Industry Medical Health Foundation (AIM). After porn actor, Darren James, and porn actress, Lara Roxx, recently tested positve for HIV, she was able to halt production of adult movies for 60-days in the Los Angeles area. First, it's nice to know that the adult film industry has some measures in place to try and prevent the spread of HIV among its actors. More amazingly, I am surprised that it has been as successful as it has until this major outbreak, which nothing of its kind has happened since 1998. Still, it's good to know that something is in place instead of nothing at all. Still, you would think they would require condom use at all times. Secondly, I think it's very inspiring that a woman who has slipped away into stripping in clubs to support her heroin habit, is beaten so badly, it sends her a wake up call that something has got to change. What does she do? She goes back to school for the training she needs to help others from her former industry. Some of the services she has extended to clients include: birth control; drug and alcohol counseling; information on how to get in and out of the porn industry safely; scholarship program; medical checkups; and STD screenings. Many people may have felt that there was no point in bettering themselves because they were too old and too set in their ways to change. It's too hard. Why bother? I was reading an essay in Michal Thomas Ford's My Big Fat Queer Life and it had something to do with how silly porn was. He mentioned the deaths of Joey Stefano, who I knew died of a drug overdose, and Ryan Idol, who fell or was pushed out of the window of his Manhattan hotel. This sounded very mysterious so I decided to research it a little. As it turns out, Ryan survived the fall from his fourth story window. It's actually an amazing story. He landed on an awning that broke his fall and he was so drunk that it distributed the impact more evenly through out his body. urlLink Here is an interesting article I found about the incident, his stage career and opinions on how he may or may not be using the gay community. I've never been a big fan of porn. I've always felt it is sort of like alcohol. When used in moderation, it can be enjoyed by some people. However, with excessive use, it can destroy lives. In the late 80s and early 90s, my best friend, Kent, had a msyterious porn collection. I would go over to his apartment and he would have stacks of gay porn magazines. It was then that I learned the significance of Cyndi Lauper looking at the pages of a Blue Boy magazine in She-Bop , the world's greatest anthem on the right for maturbation tolerance. Knowing that he was a college student like myself, I knew he didn't have the money to buy all of these. The magazines weren't cheap. He said that friends gave them to him. I never met those friends and always wondered about who they were and what exchange may have transpired for these magazines. Ken would hand me several magazines to puruse as he finished getting ready to go out. They're really not doctor's office or hair salon reading material, are they? I mean the purpose of porn is to titilate with the expectation that one is going to manually self-stimulate oneself. It's not like you're going to whip it out at the doctor's office and go to town or tell your hair dresser, "Oh, let me just switch my Butterly vibrator off. I was picking up some good vibrations." Furthermore, when I venture into any territory outside my upbringing, my mother's voice usually accompanies me. As you flip through the pages and you see some smooth model type with a big grin on his face as he holds his legs up in the air to expose his perky and pink anus, the only thing I can think of is, "You know, he can never run for political office now." My mother's voice says, "What would his mother think?" Granted, I think at one time or another, we've all wondered what it would be like to runaway and do something wild like pose nude for a photographer or buy toothpaste without out a coupon, but we know we would never do it. I'm not ashamed of my body, but it doesn't necessarily warrant that I present my spinchter to the world for general viewing. Plus, I don't particurlarly want my mom and dad to see my genitals on parade, thank you very much. On the other hand, I read an interview with porn actor is some local periodical about how his mother runs his fan club and helps hime choose which nude pictures to submit to magazines. "Which picture do you like best Ma? The cowboy, the biker or the all American boy-next-door?" "I like the all American one. You've got a bigga hard-on." So there was one particulary magazine that I actually liked to read. I think it was called Man Shots and they had interviews with the directors and actors as well as pictures. Kent would always tease me for reading the articles, but I thought they were fascinating. I had no idea how huge the porn industry is in the United States, let alone the rest of the world. It is a well organized, finely tuned machine. It was enlightening to discover what a director looks for in an actor/model and what reasons led some performers to get involved in the industry. Sadly, Kent's porn collection is gone. I went to visit him when his sick once and staying with his mother. As I was leaving, he said he wanted to return my box of books. I told him that he didn't have any of my books. He expressed with much emphasis that he did indeed have some of my books. I suddenly understood that I was to be the care taker of his porn while he was living at home. My friend, Tacy, had gone with me to visit Kent. As we drove away, I rifled through the box and was amazed at the collection. It had all changed. There were movies too. For some reason, Chip Off The Old Block sounds familiar. The box remained with me for several years. In fact, at one point, it was even in my parents' attic in storage. I eventually through it all away. At one point, I was going to cut all of the erect penises out and write a poem with them on a canvas. Sadly, it never happened. I don't own any porn and I sometimes feel like a cowboy without a horse. How can I be a gay man without porn? I've often flirted with the idea of buying a movie just to keep around the house in case I ever decide I want to watch it. The idea of just knowing it's there in case I want to watch it soothes me, but trying to pick out a particular title among the thousands of titles gives me a headache. I'm very particular about the regular movies I own, I would imagine I would be even more specific with a blue movie. In the end, I can't say that I have missed anything over the years. In closing, I did find an urlLink interesting Web site in my research for Ryan Idol last night. It's a site that lists deceased porn stars and how they died. It seems like many of them left this mortal coil in some most unpleasant ways. I don't know the numbers for regular actors in the porn industry, but the ratio of deaths by tragic circumstances may be small in comparison to the number of actors as a whole. However, I would say that in an industry where drug and alcohol use are common, it does not seem surprising. As I read the names and the circumstances of death, I found myself pitying these people, but then I changed my mind. Don't we all face challenges no matter who we choose to spend time with or which profession we go into. Whether it's learning to tell our boss to get his or her own coffee extracting ourselves from the clutches of a craze fan who is beating the crap out of us, they are all opportunities for growth and it is what we make of those opportunities that counts.

 I, CHANGELING "I washed that outer curtain that you wanted washed." "Yeah, but you put other clothes on top of it and now it's wrinkled." So I start laughing because he usually has a constructive comment for everything. He really means well, but there is no positive comment in front of it to soften the blow so it just comes across as annoying to me. "Why are you laughing." "Because you fill me full of joy." "Yeah, right. You're making fun of me." He reached around me to pour some lotion on his hands. "I'm enjoying you," I said, as I walked out of the bathroom. The door swung closed behind me. "Hey, I can't open the door. I have lotion on my hands." "I can't hear you!" I called up to him as I descended the stairs.

 THE WEEKEND IN REVIEW As I sit here, I'm trying to think back to what I did this weekend. I know that I worked Friday and then met Jeff at the gym. We had a urlLink Poblano Pesto Burrito at Qdoba Grill afterwards. We came home and then did things around the house. I attacked my old personal files and threw out a lot of old documents. Saturday, we got up late. I guess it was 9am. Jeff and I decided on recipes for the Progressive Dinner Party. I started laundry and went for a run around the park. I put lunch in the oven and took a shower. I cleaned out the refrigerator. I threw out some things that I'm not sure Jeff would have allowed me throw out had he been there. I will say this: I threw out some things so old that they in our refrigerator the last time Justin was in Britney. That's all I'm going to say. My cleaning spree continued. I helped Jeff load books into the truck to take to a storage facility until he has enough to lease a space. At some point, we received a phone call that Joel & Merredith would not be coming this week. They are in the process of selling Joel's late father's business and there has been a delay. I'm not sure when they are coming now, but we got a lot of cleaning done that needed to be done. We kept cleaning. I shreded some more old documents. We went to Virginia Highlands and had dinner at urlLink Everybody's Pizza and then went by urlLink Publix to pick up ingredients for the Progressive Dinner Party items. They had one piece of that fantastic tiramisu left and I bought it. There was some dramatic lightning against the skyline as we drove home, especially from Freedom Parkway where you have a magnificent view of the city. We had just brought the groceries in when the rain poured down. The wind was blowing hard. Naturally, I did the only thing I knew to do. I ate tiramisu and went to bed. I was tired. I got up Sunday and went to church. I found myself distracted because of all the things I still needed to do this weekend. There was a teenage boy sitting four rows in front of me. He was dressed in a suit and his haircut made him look like a grown man. He was kind of sitting in a grown up way. Even though I knew he was too big to be a little person, I kept watching him periodically through out the service because he just stuck out. A cute married couple in orange sat down three rows in front of me. They had the cutest little girl with big glasses with thick lenses. She was too cute. Two rows in front of me, the butch lesbian trio sat together. I though there was a fourth, but it just turned out to be a heavy metal guy with long hair. There was a hispanic guy sitting in front of me. He came in late and I think he's gay. His shoes were a dead give away. Don't ask me to explain. It's instinct. He may be a few years older than me. During the announcements, I contemplated his haircut. I wish my hair looked like his in the back, but it's too thick. I always wanted jet black hair. Rev. John was in a bible-flipping mood and we we flipped through our pew bibles. I finally stopped because by the time I find the section he's reading from, he's almost through reading it and I don't get anything out of it. As I was getting into my car to leave, I noticed the hispanic guy and said hello. He was startled at first and then smiled. I wonder if anyone has ever made the effort to introduce themselves to him before? I'll try to do that next week. I did more cleaning when I got home and then began cooking. Jeff did some things outside and then worked on presentation. After the Progressive Dinner Party, I ironed a shirt for him while he worked on his presentation to appeal our property taxes Monday morning. I called and spoke with my mom and little sister and that was about it. Where does the time go?

 POST PROGRESSIVE DINNER PARTY It's the morning after and we had a great time. I live on a really neat block with a diverse group of people. Eleven out of fourteen houses participated and we also had some participants from outside the neighborhood. A northern blew in last night, but I still attended in shorts and a smart, orange T-shirt with stripes. I felt rather Charlie Brown-esque in my fashion. The cool weather was refreshing. We started at 6pm with drinks and appetizers at Jeff & Susan's house. They are really fun. I hadn't had the opportunity to spend much time with them before, but I have decided that I like them and that they can stay. I made spinach and artichoke dip and some fruit dip with amareto. Fortunately, the group didn't eat it all so I got to bring some home. I love the fruit dip. It really gives a strawberry some kick. "Oh, I'm drunk off the fruit dip!" Not. We went to Joey & Amy's house next for soup and salad. Come to think of it, I didn't get any soup. I wonder if it was good. The salads were great. Marcia led a lively discussion on the joys of TiVo. I waxed on graciously about a new spam blocker called urlLink Spambayes , which Mike at urlLink To Blog Or Not To Blog wrote about. It truly is a great spam blocker. It learns as it goes and it's doing a great job. The group then descended upon the Johnson home for the main entrees. We had some great ribs and sides. Come to think of it, I didn't have the opportunity to eat all the sides. The Johnsons have a large family room with this wrap around couch that reminds me of being a guest on Good Morning America. I interviewed Marcia about her imaginary novel, Why I Hate George W. Bush . I made a pitch for the Moth Ball and our neighborhood yard sale. I also had the opportunity to learn more about Lorenia's college years and how she met her husband, Roland. We finished at Tony and Thom's house. Thom made a delicious mandarin orange cake, which someone said was moister than a drunk sororiety girl at a keg party. I'm not sure about that, but it was moist and tasty. Dave made a coconut cake. Our chocolate cherry cobbler wasn't a disaster, but I found it to be somewhat lackluster. Jeff said it needed more cherry pie filling. Probably so. I don't know that I would make it again. Jeff 3 was working the coffee bar and gave me a mean capacino. There was some discussion about the effects of caffeine to which some people were surprised when I mentioned that caffeine has no effect on me. I'm not sure if it was doubt or amazement in their eyes. I chased Olive, Tony & Thom's dog, around the house for some exercise and then we ended the evening on the sleeping porch as Jeff & Susan told us the story of how they met in traffic court. We discussed how to discern from all the Jeffs and Susans on our block. It's easy for me because I'm 1F and Jeff is 2Fs. Gigi dubbed Jeff as Jeff 3 a few years ago. Jeff 3 suggested a J-lo concept, but that would make me J-Blo and that doesn't sound very good. Jeff 3 stated that he got first dibs on J-Ho.

 OLD TEXAS DRIVER'S LICENSE I was cleaning out the filing cabinet today to make room for my business files and I'm consolidating my personal documents into a pendaflex. I've been able to throw out tons. I found my old driver's license from when I was 21. I look so different, but not so different. First, I was very, very skinny. I've always had the hardest time gaining weight. My jaw seems more square. I still have the same long, thick, floppy, blonde hair. I have on a black Boy London T-shirt and a white cardigan. I must have thought it was really cool as I was still heavily influenced by Bananarama at the time. I can't say that I look more innocent because I know that I certainly wasn't. In some ways, I had not been beaten down by life yet, and then in other ways, now I have learned to control my thinking and see the joy in every moment. I can't say that I would want to go back to that time in my life again unless I knew what I know now. I'm not someone who has ever been cordial to regret. I view it as a waste of energy and time. I've often thought of writing my autobiography now that I have had some time to distance myself between the more painful times of my youth. Now I understand myself better and why I did the things I did. I also understand the people who were in my life at the time better too. I wonder if there is some reason why I came across this photograph at this moment in my life. I shall have to sleep on it, me thinks.

 SWIM STRAIGHT, SOLDIER! This morning I got up at seven and drove over to Kiki's house to renew our swimming program from last year. We've had conflicts for most of June, but we are finally back onto a Tuesday and Thursday schedule. I'm not a natural swimmer. It took me a very long time to become comfortable in the water as a child. Because my mother never learned to swim well, she insisted that my sister and I take swim lessons. Our first attempt was at the local community college. We had to rinse off in the showers before getting in the pool, which were also shared by the students. They were open showers and I can remember the shock of rinsing off and turning to my right to see a penis and furry scrotum staring at me. I think I may have let out a yelp. I don't recall every paying much attention when I may have seen my father undressed before then. Moreover, I had been so close to anyone's private area before. It wasn't sexual at all. It was more the shock of seeing something there that I wasn't expecting and almost putting my eye out. I must have been about seven so my eye level was right at there crotch level. I felt that the younger people should have had a separate shower area from the college students because we were just there to rinse off. We weren't serious showerers . Swim lessons at the community college got off to a rocky start. The instructor, a college-age girl, was rather impatient. I remember she was working with me to help me float on my back and I just started babbling about how I really didn't want to take swimming lessons, but my mother had made me and I was just sure I was going to drown. Although there was no couch, it was definitely water therapy. The next summer, we took swim lessons at the YWCA with a woman my mother knew from Girl Scouts. The classes were much smaller and I found that I actually learned to become comfortable in the water. I could float and tread water, but I never could get the breathing right for freestyle. In January of 2003 I ordered two videos from urlLink Total Immersion Swimming , which was created by Terry Laughlin. He basically paid attention to what made some swimmers move faster in the water with less effort and created a fishllike swimming program. It's based upon the principles of achieving balance in the water, which is not exactly the way we have been taught to swim in the past. Through progressive drills, students learn to find their balance in the water and lengthen their body to make it more streamlined in the water. This results in being able to move more swiftly in the water while use less effort. These principles have worked for many U.S. Olympic swimmers. Having wanted to learn the four Masters swim strokes for some time, I decided to give the program a try. After all, swimming is a great low impact and highly aerobic form of exercise. Last summer we worked on the butterfly and breaststroke and this year we are working on freestyle and the backstroke. I've already been amazed at how these drills that start off so far from the final stroke work so well. My biggest challenge seems to be with my feet, which seem to sink like I'm wearing a pair of concrete Keds. However, fins seem to help. I also seem to have a problem going in a straight line on my back. I think that I'm either throwing myself off with my kicking or my head is not exactly straight. When you're looking up at the sky, it's hard to keep your bearings. I'm really commited to this. Anyone who knows me knows that I hate to be cold. I need a reason to put on a Speedo and jump in the cold water early in the morning. I also have to say that a swim cap is like a condom for the head. It's tight and unattractive. It makes me look like a blue bullet. The one odd thing I have noticed over time is that I don't like being in the pool by myself. It's not that I fear a shark is suddenly going to appear in the pool to attack me, but I have a lot of anxiety about being alone in the water with no one around. I'm not particurlary scared about getting into trouble as I'm rather relaxed in the water, but perhaps on some level I'm afraid that an accident could occur that might leave me unconscious and I'll drown. I decided this morning that I just needed to push my comfort zone and work through this anxiety once and for all. As I practiced my backstroke drill down the pool, I affirmed how comfortable I was in the water by myself. I am safe. No harm can come to me. Then I ran into the other end of the pool head first. Perhaps there is a reazon I should be anxious.

 HAN SOLO AND PRINCESS LEIA When I was twelve years old I developed a strange obsession with Luke Skywalker's relationship with Princess Leia Organa. The kiss for luck before they swung across the bottomless chasm in the Deathstar connected with a deeply hidden, gooey, emotional center that I can only equate with the Barbie gene in young girls. I was constantly speculating on how Luke and Leia's relationship was developing. How often did they see each other? Did Luke always pay for dinner and was it fair since he was just moisture farmer and she was a princess? Did Luke kiss Leia in a way that made her hair buns unfurl? My Kenner action figures were practically Malibu Barbie and Ken. They would go on dates in Luke's landspeeder that were probably just like Barbie and Ken's mating rituals except that they were interupted by Tuskin Raiders. I knew Luke was just about to pop the question when the novel for The Empire Strikes Back was released. The picture of Luke looking deeply into Leia's eyes touched a passionate part of me that almost caused me to swoon. Oddly enough, I did not think this strange for a 12-year-old boy. I immediately read the book in one night and was shocked to find out that scoundrel Han Solo basically stabbed his best friend in the back and stole his girl. And don't get me started on that two timing bitch, that's Ms. Organa to you, who could not have a decent hair do if she tried. I was so devastated that I put my Han Solo action figure in a shoe box and put him on the uppermost shelf of my closet. It was the only way I felt I could control the situation. I felt so lied to. I felt like George Lucas had misled me. I felt that Alan Dean Foster had gotten my hopes up in Splinter Of The Mind's Eye only have my hopes and dreams stomped upon by a one-legged Vegas showgirl in stileto. What about the house? What about the children? I had already picked out the names Logan and Ariel. What did I have left to live for? I had spent two years pouring all of my energy into a relationship that had suddenly come to an end. All I had done was give, give, give and look what I got in return. NOTHING. In time, I slowly began to heal. I found Luke and Leia began to avoid one another and if one showed up on the Milenium Falcon, the other would disappear into my Creature Cantina playset. Wondering what Leia saw in Han that she no longer saw in him, Luke began to look at the walrus man in a strange new way. He would find himself getting drunk and venturing out into dark alleys with willing Jawas. It just wasn't right. When Luke and Leia did find themselves in social situations, it was awkward and the conversation forced. Eventually, I returned Han to the fold and he and Leia didn't waste anytime before moving in together. Luke couldn't stand to watch it and aliented himself on my dresser where he threw himeelf into his Jedi training. Before long, all was forgotten. Looking back, I think this was my first experience with disappointment in a relationship, even though I was only indirectly involved. In the future, I would find myself looking at boyfriends like a Leia who had abandoned me for a Han. Inevetiably, I would find myself in a bar moisturizing my sorrow in a frosty swirl. I looked to my left and saw a walrus man of a different kind, but thankfully, I saw no Jawas.

 MOTHBALL DIARY We had another meeting tonight at Katy's house. Katy put together a list of possible sponsors and we each have contacts to ask to contribute. We discussed the band and DJ situation. We have three months left and we are beginning to feel the pressure so naturally we wandered off to discuss the connection between men and porn. "It seems to me that gay men would be more apt to have porn because they are so much more promiscuous than straight men," said KM. "I disagree," KS argued. "I bet there's porn in your house that you don't know about." "But when I worked at the hair salon, all the gay guys talked about how they watched porn and their sexual adventures." "Gay men are more likely to open up and share with you about those things because they view you as a friend, confidant and equal. Straight men would never share that with you unless you were a lesbian," I offered. "What do you mean?" "Straight men view women as either a potential sexual experience, their mother or someone who will tell whatever they say to their wife or girlfriend, which will make their life a living hell." "That's a good point." "Men are biologically created to want to mate and think about sex constantly," KS explained. "They also have permision to be more open and honest about it because even if they are dating someone or in a relationship, it is somehow more acceptable." "I would agree with that for the most part," I said. "Gay men tend to have make open relationships part of their lifestyle more commonly than their straight counterparts." "I don't think women are able to do that as easily. I mean, open relationships are a great idea in theory, but I would just be too jealous." "It's not for me," I advised. "However, I can see why three-way live-in relationships would be attractive. 'Oh, you're going down to the dungeon to take turns fisting one another? Y'all have fun. No, I think I'll just spend a quiet evening on the couch with Edith Wharton.' I would love having a night off." We laughed and I felt my bond with my straight sisters bringing us closer together. We realized we got off track and got back to business for a few minutes. "Have you read the new David Sedaris book?" "I just got it in the mail today. I'm so excited. Is it good?" "It's the best one yet. Although, his fascination with feces disturbs me." "Not me. I'm a mother and pet owner. I live with shit every day." Here we go again.

 CAN I SEE A PORK ROAST AND NOT THINK OF A FEMALE SERIAL KILLER? Once a month some of my neighbors and I will get together for a potluck dinner a movie that we like to refer to as Cinematherapy . We usually start at 6:00pm and rap up around 10:30pm or so. The weekend had already been rather busy. I hadn't felt well on Thursday or Friday and Saturday was pretty much the same. I spent a lot of time sleeping and reading. Occasionally I would get up a do a few things and then head back to bed. I don't know if it was a bug or just something from the constant on again/off again rain we have been having. For the past two weeks the sky will go completely dark as if the world is ending and it will rain and then it will be sunny as a picture post card day and then the sky will become black again. This has been occuring daily for what seems like forever. I felt better on Sunday and tried to make up for lost time. I headed over to Marcia's house and we had a delicious dinner. Marcia made a pork roast with pepper jelly. It doesn't sound good, but it tasted great. Gigi made a great salad with mandarin oranges. Dave brought some bread from Atlanta Bread Company. It was big slices of manly bread. Jeff W. made a vegetable dish with potatoes, brocoli, sweet poatatoes and pears. It was absolutely delicious. I made a strawberry Jello pie with a graham cracker crust. It was all good. For movie selections, Marcia let us decide between Stargate and Aileen: Life And Death Of A Serial Killer . We chose the documentary, which is about Aileen Wuornos who Charlize Theron played in the movie Monster . I must admit that I haven't had much of an interest to see Monster although I've heard the performances are great. I saw Boys Don't Cry a few years ago and it just bummed me out for the rest of the afternoon. My friends Merredith and Bran told me they watched Monster a few weeks ago and they were left feeling like society had really failed this woman. "She never had a chance," Merredith stated. I tend to shy away from making such definite statements. This lady killed seven men in cold blood. I mentioned reading that there was a documentary released shortly before Monster was released and I would be interested in seeing that. As fate had it, I did. The documentary was very well done. It picks up with the film-maker being summoned to be a witness in Aileen's appeal trial and when he gets there, Aileen suddenly denies that the witnesses testifying on her behalf are not telling the truth. She seems to be sabotaging her defense. As it turns out, Aileen realizes that she is never going to get off death row and she just wants to get the wait over and be executed "The waiting is driving me crazy." She believes that the police knew she was the killer after the first murder, but wanted her to continue cleaning up the world so they would have someone to pin it on. It is uncovered that three police officers and Aileen's lover tried to sell a film deal regarding her story and could have resulted in a retrial or something to that nature. Nothing happened. Her childhood is explored. Aileen's mother abandoned her when she was six-months old and she was brought up by her grandfather who physically and sexually abused her. Her brother had sex with her. All the boys in the neighborhood had sex with her, but didn't want to associate with her in public. She gave birth to a baby at thirteen and gave it up for adoption. She was thrown out of her house and lived in the woods for two years. She was an outcast that society ignored. Eventually, she went to Florida and became a prostitute. I found myself agreeing that society had indeed failed this woman. She never stood a chance. Yes, she killed seven men, but if anything in her life had been different, would it have made a difference?

 KYLIE MINOGUE MAILING LIST I realized today that even though I'm sure Abby is a fine girl, I do not need to receive 50 e-mails from her each day regarding Australian, pop singer, Kylie Minogue. Abby, who I believe lives in Oklahoma, loves Kylie. I know this because she mentions it in her many e-mails each day. She also loves Kylie fans and carefully places little "X's" and "O's" in her e-mails to signify the love and kisses that she is spreading to us all. I'm not sure how I suddenly got on the Kylie Minogue Mailing List, but I began receiving e-mails about two months ago. I would like to know updates on when new material is being released, but I do not want to do speculate on whether or not Kylie has had a brow lift, if she and her boyfriend, Oliver Martinez, have secretly wed, wax on about the merits of Kylie painting her front door pink, debate whether or not you can actually see her left nipple in a photo from 1988 or what Kylie song is best to make love too. For consistent rhythm and motion during the dirty deed, The Loco-Motion is going to win hands down every time. It's time to let go. Now I must find where the details are to unsubscribe myself from the list. Sorry, Kylie, but I must be free.

 GAY PRIDE AND BISHOP DON Vickie is moving to West Virginia and her going away party was canceled. Jeff was notified that he had to go out of town for business this weekend and he's going away on a missionary trip the following weekend. Meanwhile, our friends Mark and Steve invited us to walk around the corner and meet some friends of theirs who recently moved to the neighborhood. Afterwards, I planned to meet Joan and Joanne at Vinyl to watch Joanne's son's band, Bishop Don, play. I did laundry for Jeff before he came home and made dinner while he was running last minute errands. He asked why I had not taken the remaining items from our yard sale to Goodwill. I told him it had been raining. He said he could not stand to have the stuff on the porch a minute longer and he was going to take everything to Goodwill right this second. I told him to knock himself out... and so he did. I made dinner and was beginning to wonder where he was when it occured to me that Goodwill has books and that explained why he was so anxious to go to Goodwill. I smiled and kept the food warm until he got home. We ate and then Mark and Steve showed up. We walked down to Steve and Tim's house for their gay pride party. It's very nicely decorated. It looks like the Fab Five exploded inside. I jokingly asked Steve if they had a dungeon and he replied with all sincerity that it was in the basement, but the door was locked. I asked Mark for a hairpin so I could open the lock and have a peek, but then someone offered me a Jello shot and I was gone. It was difficult prying the Jello shot out of the plastic cup. I noticed that the lesbians at the party seemed to be ferreting out the Jello from the cup with their skilled tongues. I suddenly had even more respect for my lesbian sisters. It was amazing to see how many gay men live in Atlanta. I recognized people from when I used to go to Bally's several years ago. I talked with a couple as I was standing outside. One minute Andy was telling me how he moved from Ohio and the next minute he is telling me that if he gets down on all fours and places his butt high enough in the air, this allows Joe to insert his penis into Andy's rectum and repeated pound his prostrate, which results in a satisfying and messy orgasm for both. I tilted my head to the side and said, "Hmmm." I then excused myself to get one of those delicious little homemade piggies in the blankets that were inside. I wasn't sure if this conversation occured because of my natural ability to put people at ease and tell me all of their personal business or whether I just attract freaks. Mark and I briefly discussed updating the Grant Park Tour of Homes and Gardens to include sex chambers and dungeons. Last year we had candle making demonstrations, lessons on whipping up dried flower arrangements and a tutorial on how to churn your own butter. Wouldn't it be interesting this year to provide helpful hints on what household cleaners best removed bodily fluids from latex clothing, show the versatility of the velcro dungeon and providing a hands on fisting demonstration. "Are there any volunteers who would like to get into the sling?" After half an hour, Jeff and I headed back home. He continued to pack and I drove into town to see Bishop Don play. Joanne had on a Bishop Don T-shirt and she has to be the cutest band mother I've ever met. She was be-bopping in the crowd with her little backpack on. I also enjoyed watching young heterosexual men dance to the music. It's a little less fluid than homosexual dance steps. It's much more stacato with jerky movements... like having an epileptic fit without falling down. Joan and I watched two girls play video games at the bar all night. The band was good. They played a variety of styles and wore little suits that reminded me of punk bands from the late seventies. I started to fall asleep after 1:00am, but the show ended and I headed home. I was quite hungry at this point so I decided to stop at Taco Bell on the way home and buy a quesadilla. It made me feel just like Ryanstask. I placed my order at the little drive-thru box. The attendant said something back, but I couldn't understand him. Finally I heard him say just to pull around. As it turns out, he didn't get my order at all and I had to wait for them to make the quesadilla at the window. The attendant became very flustered. It looked like he was understaffed. I thanked him for my quesadilla and headed home. Jeff was still up when I arrived home. He finished packing right after I brushed my teeth and we went to bed. Sleep never felt so good.

 WISH ME WELL I haven't felt very good the past three days. It seems like every morning I wake up with a headache and I feel nauseated and I'm tired. By the late afternoon, I usually feel better. However, it has put a screeching halt to my productivity both in business and my personal life. I spoke with a friend on the telephone and mentioned that I didn't feel very well. As soon as I uttered the words, I thought to myself, "Now she's going to tell me that I've been burning the candle at both ends." My friend asked, "Is your body just stressed out from doing too darn much?" I laughed to myself. I was amused by my ability to predict what someone will say after knowing them for many years. I'm sure you can all think of examples in your own lives from your own friends. After I hung up with my friend, I recalled a conversation I had with her a month or so ago where she told me that she wished sometimes I would just listen to her vent and not offer suggestions for taking action. I understood what she was saying. It's a very male-oriented trait and at home with my practical nature. I suddenly realized that I wished that if I mentioned that I was tired or not feeling well, I wished my friend would not immediately comment on my condition as being the result of doing too much or not taking care of myself. I just want to say I'm sick or tired in a venting way and for my friend to say, "That's too bad. Well, I hope you get to feeling better." Then it occured to me that my friend is just expressing her authentic self by reminding to take care of myself. She enjoys mothering people. It's how she expresses her love for others. However, my authentic self does not want to be mothered. I have a mother already. As I look back over our friendship, I can see a definite pattern of how when she mothers me, I pull back. I find this very interesting because in all the years this little dance has been going on, I've never consciously thought about it or analyzed it. It just seemed so silly, but then I realized something interesting was going on. My friend is making some changes in her life that have suddenly made her aware of certain feelings and beliefs she has about certain things and she is consciously making new choices to bring about positive change in her life. Like a pebble in a pond, I realized that her ripple effect is spreading out and making me aware of some of my own unrecognized feelings and beliefs. In the end, the fact that my friend mothers me has never been a serious issue, but I'm excited by the effect her own fearlessness to change her own life is beginning to rub off on me.

 PRJOECT ARCHITOOTHIS Ben has a new music project and is looking for writers to submit lyrics for him to put to music. If you would like to hear some of his work, click urlLink here . I finally made time to jot something down. I don't do much with rhyme, but felt like doing so tonight. It always looks funny to me. This is my dark song about obsessive love with a twist of Bjork. I hope you like it. Paper In Your Hands Sitting in the long grass Watching your house My heart is my compass Thoughts of you arouse The wind carries your scent To my troubled heart What is it your words meant? I'm left in the dark Your silhouette is a painful reminder Of the spell you have cast over me The light spilling from your window Is far too weak to shine the truth On my fantasies I'm paper in your hands Write on me, write on me Fold me over and keep me secret But close to your heart Looking in your bedroom You talk on the phone Talking now with someone Now taken my throne Your deep laughter pierces through me With the force of a subway train Blinded by what I want to see And now my school boy dreams are slain It's a tragedy I'm paper in your hands Write on me, write on me Fold me over and keep me secret But close to your heart I'm paper in your hands Write on me, write on me Let me keep your thoughts and poetry Whisper to your heart Don't wad me up Or throw me away Nor cut me up In little pieces Don't cover me With another sheet Take me out and Use me, use me, use me Staring down at your face The time has now come Ink dripping from my pen There's no place to run Your eyes show surprise at my grip My hand over your soft mouth Write on my skin with fountain tip Let me feel the prick of your vow It's such majesty I'm paper in your hands Write on me, write on me Fold me over and keep me secret But close to your heart I'm paper in your hands Write on me, write on me Let me keep your thoughts and poetry Whisper to your heart I'm afraid of the empty page I'm afraid of the empty page I'm afraid of the empty page I'm afraid of the empty page

 PAINKILLERS I could not get to sleep last night and I finally fell asleep about three. I got up early to attend our neighborhood business meeting. Cathy Woolard discussed the new beltline develop, which will provide intown rail service for neighborhood residents on existing railways in the city. Cathy also resigned as President of the Atlanta City Council three months ago and will now run for the fourth Congressional seat. It was a good business meeting. I met a real estate investor and the business manager for a builder. Things are looking up. Afterwards, I drove around Cabbagetown and Reynoldstown looking for realtors and For Sale By Owner (FSBO) properties to contact. I came home to Jef Base Alpha to check e-mail. It seems my neighbor, Tony, was held up at gun point by four men outside his home last night. I don't have many details, but I assume that Tony came home late last night since he is a doctor and works varied shifts. He said they held a gun to his head. This is very unsettling since most neighbors on our street would agree that we live on one of the most well lit and safest streets in the neighborhood. Obviously we need to keep our eyes open... especially on Tuesday and Wednesday evenings when most crack addicts come down from their high and need to steal to buy their next fix. The best thing to do is throw your wallet toward the robber and run for the house. They usually just want the money and are typically bad shots anyway so their chances of fatally wounding you are low. The worst thing you can do is cooperate by laying down face down. You never know when these people are so tweaked that they might shoot you anyway. I came home this evening and took a nap. I haven't felt very good the past few days. Jeff brought me back some dinner after his dinner meeting. I felt like I was walking underwater for quite some time. In a rare occurence, I turned the television on. It's rather pathetic that I actually had to look at the manual to figure out how to work the remote. After some effort, I was able to find Will & Grace . Sadly, it wasn't funny and I found a documentary on the History Chanel about King Arthur. I found it interesting that Camelot and Lancelot actually came from the French and were later incorporated into the Excalibur legend. Now I am watching VH1 Classic. I love this station. I've seen Word Up by Cameo. The lead singer has been thrown into jail so many times here in Georgia for not paying child support. Then I watched Kim Wilde sing Kids In America. She looked so young and skinny. She looks nothing like the 40ish, heavier Kim Wilde who appears on Garden Invaders in the UK now. From pop music to horticulture, she has certainly changed. I saw the video for She Blinded Me With Science by Thomas Dolby. I had actually forgotten that video. I remember playing Donkey Kong on my Colecovision while listening to that song on the radio. Dolby reminds me of a guy named Randy that I dated in my first year in Atlanta. He was shorter and a vegetarian. I laughed when he told me his house burned down on New Year's Eve. I thought he was joking, but then he showed me the video tape with the story that was on the news. He lived in the Georgian Terrace Hotel across from the Fox Theater, which is where Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable stayed when they were in town for the premiere of Gone With The Wind. However, the movie did not premire at the Fox Theater. Randy wasn't actually my type. A friend had suggested that I place a personal ad in Southern Voice and I did. I don't remember much about the few other guys that answered except that they each seemed to have some fatal, psychological flaw. Randy and I talked on the phone several weeks before we met. He made me laugh at a time when I needed to. In December I had just moved into a one bedroom apartment in Morrow, Georgia. I had very little money and little furniture. I slept on a air mattress. I would go over to Jeff's house on Tuesday and Thursday evenings to work out, but I rarely saw him any other time with his various commitments. I was lonely and I enjoyed talking to Randy on the telephone as I laid on the air mattress in the dark with the Art Of Noise playing in the background. When I finally met him, we had brunch in Virginia Highlands and walked through Piedmont Park. It was Janauary, but not cold. We sat on the hill and held hands and it was nice even if he wasn't someone who I would normally be attracted to. We often saw each other on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. He was a consultant for Anderson and traveled throughout the week. He took me to a lot of different restaurants and would rarely let me pay. I didn't think much about this at first, but after a while, it began to bother me. No matter how many times I brought it up, he just dismissed it. Randy liked Morrisey, Thomas Dolby, Bronski Beat and the Pet Shop Boys. Bilingual was their newest album and we listened to it a lot. I just sort of opened myself up to him over time and eventually my feelings deepened. I remember one night we were lying in bed in mid tryst and I said, "I love you." It just sort of slipped out without any thought and it surprised me. Randy froze and his back muscles tensed up. I asked what was wrong. "Nothing," he said and I can say with absolute certainty that's when everything changed. Over the next few weeks, we saw each other less and our telephone conversations grew shorter. One night, we went to dinner and he was just painfully silent. I remember feeling very strong and thinking if this was the end, just say so and get it over with. He wanted me to come back to his apartment and he watched television while I read. Eventually we went to bed and he just laid there. I asked him where we stood and what he wanted. He said he didn't know how he felt and I was confused. In hindsight, I wished I had just gone home. However, over time, I found my strength whittling away. I became a slave to uncertainty and found my emotions unraveling. The relationship was ending, but I didn't know why. I just wanted closure, but that was being withheld from me. I couldn't understand it and one night I remember crying about it. Correction - it was beyond crying; it was deep sobbing where my whole body shook and I didn't think I'd ever be able to stop. It scared me because I'm not an overly emotional person, yet I knew that what was coming up wasn't just about Randy. It was like I was grieving all of these old fears and unresolved feelings from my entire life. Twenty-nine years of stuff was just bubbling up and I was boiling over. I found myself listening to the Pet Shop Boys album over and over, but the songs seemed so different now. The joy had been replaced by sadness. I actually helped him move to another apartment in the midst of the undoing of the us that no longer was. I remember sitting on his bed asking how we could work things out and him telling me that we could never work things out. He didn't have the same feelings for me that I had for him. Some may call it denial, but I knew that he felt more for me than he let on. His mouth said one thing, but his body language belied his words. I left his apartment and walked back to my car. I was surrounded by hundreds of people on the sidwalks of downtown Atlanta, but I couldn't have felt more alone. Randy and I went to in-line skate in Piedmont Park. It was very important to him for some reason to maintain a connection with me. At one point, I remember asking him if the reason he was pushing me away was because of his unresolved feelings about his mother's death from cancer. He became very angry so I knew I was right. We sat on the patio of The Mill, our skates still on, and he pretended that nothing was wrong. Intuition told me that there was someone else now. I just wanted him to admit it. I just wanted him to tell me the truth so I could let go. I pulled back for a while and limited my contact with him. I told Jeff about what had happened and his reaction surprised me. He seemed uncomfortable to find out that I had been dating someone for three months. Why should he care? We began to spend more time together and I noticed that when we were together, we began to talk more openly and shared more intimate details about ourselves. There was an energy between us that was building, but I didn't think much more about it. I was too tired of conjecturing about what had happened between Randy and I without having any information. Randy and I went to dinner one evening. We each had some stuff that belonged to the other. It was another attempt to maintain a friendship. Ironically, we had dinner in the same restaurant where we had brunch on that first date. I felt much stronger now. I had accepted that what my intuition told me was true and I no longer needed for him to tell me. I made my own closure. Randy sensed the difference in me. I think he liked the idea of knowing that perhaps I would always be there. I became aware of the fact that Randy's humor now seemed caustic and mean-spirited, where as before I always found him very clever and witty. I wondered if he had always been like that or whether he had changed. He reached for the check when it came and I took it. He told me he'd get it and I said, "No, it's important to me," and I paid the damn thing. My stuff was in the trunk of his car. He had bought a Saab Convertible and I couldn't help but think it was just a change of scenery. We talked for a moment and I said I had to go. This seemed to startle him. I hugged him and left. On my way home, I stopped by Jeff's house and we talked a bit. I asked him if I could spend the night on his couch. "I'm fine, but I just don't want to go home to my apartment. I've spent too much time looking at the same old walls feeling sad and I feel too good to feel that sadness out of habit." He understood and we were lying in the floor talking and I felt us growing closer. I wasn't expecting this, but I kissed him and he kissed me back and the plot thickened. Randy and I went to lunch a few weeks later and hiking on Kennesaw Mountain. It unsettled me that I didn't find him funny at all now. In fact, he irritated me because everything he said seemed to put someone down. We were near the top of the mountain and he finally admitted that he had been seeing someone else near the end. I suspect that he answered another personal ad after I said the "L Word." He asked me if I was seeing someone else and I told him I was. "It's funny, but I think our relationship was just something to pass time before Jeff and I became involved." He looked as if I had socked him in the stomach. "It never would have lasted between us because as soon as something happened between Jeff and I, I would have ended things with you." I didn't say it to be mean or hurt him. It was true. The past few months had given me a lot of time to think and my relationship with Randy had been a painkiller. It was a relationship that distracted him and allowed him to no deal with what was inside himself. It was a relationship built on sand that never would have lasted the first rain. Randy sent me a few e-mails over the next few months, just jokes and stuff that he forwarded to me and then we finally just let each other go. Two years later, I went to a Pet Shop Boys concert at the Tabernacle. At the end of the show, I saw Randy there with a girl friend of his that I had never meant before. He was drunk and he was purposely laughing loudly and stumbling aroudn to get my attention. I looked into his eyes and I can't exactly explain what they said to me. I think he understood now what had really happened between us. I think he missed me. I think if he could have done things differently, he would have. I think he appreciated me. I smiled at him and walked by. I wasn't trying to be mean, but my gut told me there was nothing left for me to learn from him. He was looking at me with bedroom eyes that only people who have slept with each before can recognize. I was in a relationship now and it wouldn't only be a reanactment of the past. It was just another painkiller and I had no place being there. I hope he's doing well now. I really do wish him happiness and good health. Looking back, the one thing that stands out about Randy after all this time is that flossing was very important to him.

 SUNFLOWERS The other afternoon, Jeff and I were outside in the backyard and he told me to close my eyes. He led me over near the fence and told me to open my eyes. He had planted some sunflowers for me and they had bloomed. They were huge. I'm always so amazed at how tall they grow from little bitty seeds. I had been asking to plant some for the longest time, but he told me we didn't have any space for them. Then he plants them anyway. He's a sneaky guy. Sunflowers remind me of one of my favorite summers. It was 1980 and we lived in Waco. I was going into the seventh grade in the fall and I was breaking new ground in so many ways. As a 12-year old boy, my bike was my passport to adventure and I had begun expanding my territory out beyond Bellaire Drive to include Topeka and finally the new subdivision they were building four streets over. I never asked for my permission to ride beyond the boundaries my parents had set for me years early; I just did it. My best friend, Kurt, and I would ride our bikes up to 7-11 and I would sometimes buy a treat that consisted of two cookies with vanilla ice cream in the middle. It had a particular name like a cookiewich, but I don't think that was it. That was 24 years ago. Yikes! Where has the time gone? Anyway, we would ride back home and we would take a short cut that led through the new subdivision. The road snaked around the edge of the development and on the left side of the road there was a field with oceans of sunflowers that went off into the distance. I would hear choruses of cicadas singing their otherworldly songs, which sounded like something from a science fiction movie from the fifties. I should know. I didn't live in that time period. I remember that I often wanted to stop and wander into the sunflowers, exploring what was in the middle of the field. However, if we left our bikes on the side of the road, they would have been stolen. Plus, I could hear my mother's voice in my head warning of snakes. Still, the appeal of wandering into the sunflowers that towered over me appealed to some primal part of me. Perhaps it was the onset of puberty that pounded primordial, tribal rhyhms in my head as it pumped testosterone throughout my body. It wasn't sexual, per se, but it was very powerful. I longed to be part of a secret brotherhood that did not exist. So many unknown things were being revealed to me and I wanted to know the answers to all of life's mysteries. I can't explain it, but even now, I can still feel it.

 SEINFELD AND SUPERMAN I have to admit that I really enjoyed watching these short films with Jerry Seinfeld hanging outh with Superman. They are very creative and very witty. You can watch them by clicking urlLink here .

 SEX IN THE SODA SECTION After the aborted attempt to swim, I decided to drive up to Publix and pick up a turkey wrap for dinner. 2F's was out for the evening having beer and wings with a closeted friend. 2F's friend likes to go out once a week to some of the more subdued gay bars, but told Jeff tonight that he could no longer use him as an alibi because his wife is beginning to suspect that Jeff is gay. I like to think of Jeff's friend as my own personal reality TV show. It's too strange to be real, but it is. I walked by the dessert case with the tiramisu. I didn't plan to buy any, but I still like to know how many are there in case of an emergency. I chose a vegetarian wrap and walked toward the check out lanes. As I approached an endcap of soft drinks, I noticed a hunky guy in a tank top looking at me. Without even thinking, I looked down at my feet and smiled. I may have actually blushed as well. After I walked by the guy, I remembered that I needed almonds and turned around to go down the aisle I had passed, which was just beyond the soft drinks. As I did, I noticed the blonde guy smiling at me just as a case of soft drinks fell on him. I laughed to myself as I went up the aisle for the can of almonds. Unfortunately, they were out of the natural almonds and I once again headed for the check out lanes. Feeling playful now, I got in line behind the hunky guy, which just happened to be the shortest line as well. He knew I was behind him and he kept doing things to turn around like reaching for magazines and checking the nutrional information on candy bars and gum. He had very nice upper arms and a nice butt. Finally, I decided to move to the next lane, which had become shorter. I picked up a copy of Vanity Fair with Becks on the cover and as I looked up, I saw him watching me. Now I began to worry that I may have gotten myself in trouble. Fortunately, his transaction was completed before mine and he walked out of the store, but not without giving me one more gaze. As I walked out, it occured to me that it was nice to be noticed after being in a relationship for seven years. It had been so innocent the way I looked up and saw him looking at me. I was surprised that I could become so embarrassed like a school boy. It wasn't aggressive or sexual. It was like a romantic comedy with Julia Roberts or Sandra Bullock. This guy liked the way I looked and just wanted to talk to me, perhaps ask me my name and if I might like to go get some coffee sometime. I looked up at the sky after walking through the automatic doors. The hunky guy was driving out of the parking lot in his SUV. It sort of made me sad. I wondered if he would have been a nice guy. Would he have wanted to be my friend when I told him I was already in a relationship? What would I do with him? It was like throwing a fish back that was too small or endangered. None the less, I caught myself smiling in the rearview mirror as I saw him smiling at me once again, just before the case of softdrinks fall on him. Priceless!

 TASTEFUL NUDES "Oh god!" Kiki began. "There's Rudder Man. He'll probably want a blow job in the locker room after our swim. I suppose you'll want to watch." "Not really," I replied. "Remind me again of the name of this strange little world you live in." Kiki turned his so quickly to the left to serve attitude that I thought I her his neck snap. He regarded me in the large Jacki-O sunglasses and white robe, his hair swooped up in a towel-made turban. He looked like The Bride of Frankenstein having a day of beauty a local salon. Kiki and I had planned to work some laps in tonight, but Rudder Man advised us that the pool was closed for 24-hours due to contamination. It seems some kid decided to use the pool as his or her own personal toilet. I suppose it was for the best because lightening began a dramatic display in the distant sky as we left the pool. I was picking my keys up off the sofa when Kiki shoved a Playgirl in my face and it was a bit unsettling having a head-on with a hard-on. "How old would you say this man is?" Kiki asked. "Fifty-five." I replied. "Fity-five. Can you believe it?" "Yes, I read about him in The Advocate ." "It was in The Advocate ." "I'd like to have perky nipples like that," I explained. "You know, the kind that just sort of hang off bulging pecs like stalagmatites." "Well all you need to do is have a 300-pound man grab hold of them and jump of a tall building. That's what stretches them out like that." "Oh. I guess you're right," I admitted, after closer inspection. "Those would definitely draw attention throught a T-shirt." As I flipped through the Playgirl , I couldn't help notice how raunchy it has become. Almost every guy is sporting a woody. The last time someone had shoved a copy in my face it had been much more tame in comparison. Kiki's new hobby is taking digital pictures of his friend, Eric, who is a model. Kiki has decided that he can take some tasteful nude pictures of Eric, polarize them in PhotoShop and sell them at Randy's salon, Helmet. As crazy as it sounds, he'll probably make enough to keep him in the sushi lifestyle he has grown accustomed to. Kiki tells me that Eris is very protective of his penis and his ability to keep it concealed at all times while posing for nude photos in shower stalls almost qualifies him for membership in the Justice Leage of America . Kiki showed me another image that David dubbed boring. I suggested that he crop it more closely to create more tension and then copy it and flip the image so that mirrored the other side and then polarize the second image. Kiki took my lead and began to inspect his work more with great interest as he stroked his imaginary Van Dyke. "Tasteful nudes...." He muttered to himself as he stared at the monitor. I couldn't help but laugh at how the line between tasteful and tasty is very fine indeed and dependent upon how recently the beholder has had an orgasm.

 MILLICENT MEYERS' MAGNIFICENT MURDER PLAN Many of you have asked if you can read a copy of the screenplay. I have placed a copy of the screenplay in PDF format on my portfolio site. urlLink Here is the link to the script. If you have problems, please send me a Jef-O-Gram.

 POST PITCH UPDATE I parked next to the Georgia World Congress Center and slipped into the Omni Hotel, which is attached to Phillips Arena and CNN Center. The buildings are all interconnected and it's more incestuous than an Alabama lineage. I made my way up three escalators and as I walked across the skyway to CNN center, it became very quiet like I had slipped under water. I looked out the glass walls and saw cars driving by silently. It made me feel uncomfortable for some reason. I signed in, drew my number, which was six and gave my screenplay to Jennifer in the Hospitatlity Room. I stood around and talkd to a few of the other contestants for a few minutes. They seemed dedicated and humble. I was having trouble rehearsing my pitch after the stress from the morning's yard sale and fearing that I would forget to buy tickets for all of my friends who were coming to support me. In the end, I did forget two. Fortunately, they were able to buy tickets. I decided to go ahead and read my pitch off a piece of paper. I preferred to go up there without anything, but figured it was better than going blank since I was having trouble concentrating. Mark Wynns came in and gave us our pep talk. My friend, Greg, from the Georgia Film & Music Office came in. I was afraid to say anything to him for fear that it would be read as a conflict of interest, but I didn't want him to think that I was ignoring him. He winked at me when no one was looking and I felt okay. Soon, we walked in and took our places in the front row. I was beginning to get nervous because I couldn't concentrate. Fifteen of my friends came to support me. I was overwhelmed because I didn't expect anyone really to be interested. Thanks to Jeff, Joan, Donald, Julie, Pat, Marcia, Brian, Brian, Mark, Steve, Dan, Irene, Joanne, Katy and Kellie for your support. The first few people went. The stories were interesting, but the panel of inustry professionals didn't seem very impressed. One of the panel members said she didn't like to see someone read from a piece of paper so I immediately changed gears. They didn't care for the story that the cocky guy pitched. I hate to admit that I was delighted by that, but arrogance is so unattractive and unnecessary. Finally, it was my turn. I walked up to the microphone, took a deep breath and just started to explain my story as if I was talking to friends. The panel responded well. One of the male members stated that he loved the sound of my voice and became lost in it. He liked the pitch, but got lost in some of the details, but felt he would definitely call me back for a second meeting. The second panelist seemed to have gotten lost as well. By the third panelist, there was some confusion about the age of the little girl even though I stated this information in the first sentence of my pitch. This panel member asked if this was clear to the audience and she was suprised when 95% of the audience responded that it had been made quite clear to them. The last male panel member really liked the story. Over all, I got good marks on the pitch and they found the story interesting. I sat down feeling good that I had done a good job and did not throw up into the microphone. Hadji's pitch was fantastic. He basically just went up there and winged it and seemed to throw out all the advice we were given in our orientation. His presentation was 180 degrees what it had been from what he had presented to us at the orientation. I was very happy for him. Afterwards, friends and other members from the audience came up and gave me positive feedback, which was nice to hear. I told the guy who sat beside me that he did a good job and he was kind of chilly in his reception of my compliment. Oh well! Jeff, Joan, Donald, Julie, Joanne, Pat, Marcia and I went down to the Food Court of CNN Center and got a little something before the Awards Ceremony at the Library. The general concensus was that Hadji and I would make the top three. I felt the guy who sat beside me would make it too. I didn't think his presentation was so great, but I thought the story was interesting and it had presented it fairly well. However, I questioned if would even be able to win since he was one of two alternates that were allowed to pitch. Ten of us were chosen as finalists and two alternates were chosen as well. If the two alternates were allowed to compete as well, why were they called alternates? If one of us had not showed up, just have nine compete. It didn't really make any sense. We went to the library and found seats in the theater. The three winners for the Perfect Pitch were announced and they were Hadji, the guy who sat beside me and the other alternate who pitched her story about a toxic cat that passes lethal gas that kills people. I was dumbfounded. I thought she pitched fairly well, but what did the panelists see in such a crass story with details that were ever changing. I took a deep breath, and I was okay. There was no resentment or anger on my part. I figured that things happen for a reason and I had complete trust that something good would come from it. I felt genuine happiness for the winners and enjoyed the rest of the awards ceremony. After the awards ceremony, someone immediately reassured me that I had been screwed and I stopped them right there. The decision had been made. I did not want to fill myself with any negative energy. I felt in my heart that some good would come out of it, even if it was not apparent to me now what that good was. Greg came by and told me that I had placed fourth. If I had placed one space higher, my script would have been sent to people in New York and Los Angeles. He said that there had been a lot of talk about my story and one of the male panelists in particular had said that with such an original idea and the way I presented it, I had to be a great writer. That was reassuring. Greg told me to go down and speak to the panelists because they had really expressed an interest in me. As I walked down, they were speaking with the girl who won and I started speaking with one of the other contestants. He was floored that she won as well, but we traded contact information and are going to be in touch to look at each other's work. When I finally did get to speak with the panelists, they were kind of distant. Perhaps they thought I was going to attack them. I thanked them for judging and said that I had learned a lot. I didn't know what else to say and I sort of felt like I had asked someone to dance and had been rejected. Jeff told me that I didn't get down there quick enough and I missed my window of opportunity. I'm not really sure what that means or what he judged it on. I congratulated the girl and Hadji, and once again, my well wishes were coolly received. What was up with that? One thing that I heard many of the other contestants say is that we had been coached to make our pitch in under a minute so the last two minutes could be used for answering questions from the panel and the audience. However, the panelists kept saying that we should have given more information because we had three minutes. It was if we were being criticized for doing as we had been told. They were furious that both alternates had been allowed to pitch and win. Although I was not furious, I understood what they were saying. Another point of contention is that because they were the last two contestants to pitch, they had time to adjust their pitches based upon what transpired with the first contestants. I had not thought of this and there was some truth in this too. By the time people were throwing out conspiracy theories that the winners included an African-American, an Asian-American and a woman, I had to excuse myself. I was not going down the path because that just leads to people being pissed off and getting stuck. At that point, we decided to go eat. After all the time and energy I had put into the contest the past week, preparation for the yard sale, work and the actual yard sale, I was tired. I should have gone to the closing night party after the last film, but I knew I wouldn't be worth anything. Jeff, Donald, Julie, Joanne and I went to Ted's Montanna Grill and had dinner and then Jeff and I came home and turned in. I'm still sleepy today. All in all, I was pleased with what I did. I got off my butt and finished my second full-length screenplay. I was selected as a finalist. Industry professionals were happy with my pitch presentation and story idea. I placed fourth out of twelve people. I had fifteen friends come out on a Saturday afternoon to support me because they belived in my creative talents. And most importantly, in spite of all the work I had put into this contest, I was proudest of the fact that I did not spiral into a pit of blame and resentment. I had reached a space in my life where I was not at the mercy of disappointment. In fact, I could be happy for the other winners and still let the experience inspire me to continue to move forward with new projects. That's pretty good stuff!

 FALLING OFF THE ROOF Jeff never ceases to amaze me. Last night, he broiled fish in the toaster oven with the toasting lever. Is there nothing that man cannot do?! As we were eating dinner, Jeff opened a newsletter from his former church and asked if I remembered a certain man. I told him I did not. He told me that he used to dress up like a clown, but his personality was sort of manic depressive so you never knew if you were getting Chuckles the Clown or Sad Sack the Clown. Anyway, he died last weekend. I asked how and Jeff replied that he fell off the roof. I asked if he fell on anything. Jeff looks at me and replies that he fell off the roof. Thinking he did not understand my question, I asked him again if the man fell on anything. Jeff leans forward and speaks slowly as if talking to a retarded person or a foreigner, "He fell off the roof." I replied, "Yes, I understand that, but did he fall on anything, such as a fence or wall or a large spike that just happened to be situated next to the roof?" Then Jeff begins to tell me that you can fall off even something as small as a ladder and you will most certainly die if you fall on your head, which I understood. However, I don't typically fall on my head so my first thought when the man fell off the roof is that he fell on something and broke his neck or back. I have to agree with Jeff, we do have some communication issues at times, but it will never overshadow the fact that I just love the little guy. What can I say? He does something to me. (As in the Cole Porter song, not a specific sexual act.) Jeff read the screenplay last night and really liked it. I was a bit worried because he can be my toughest critic. However, if he liked it, that's a good sign. It's amazing how many typos I missed that were right smack in front of my face, but I haven't had any distance from it and I have noticed that typos are much more apparent once you print out any document than when you read it on the monitor. It was fun sitting in the floor beside him as he read my script. He did suggest that I change one small thing in two different scenes, which I thought were good suggestions. He told me I only had three incidents where he felt that I was pornographic. Granted, pornographic for Jeff could easily fly in a PG movie or be on TV, so I need to consider this carefully. None of the passages has anything to do with sex, by the way. I'll correct the typos this afternoon and print out a few copies for tomorrow. My pitch is ready and I'll practice it periodically through out the day. I feel ready. I am excited. I also feel unusually prepared. Regardless, I'm just going to have fun tomorrow and enjoy myself. I've got a few files to prepare for work today. I should be able to wrap up a little early this afternoon and prepare for the yard sale. I'm also having lunch with Ryan today, which should be fun. We always have interesting conversations about politics, life and chocolate.

 WHAT DAY IS IT? First, I would like to begin by saying that I don't particularly like for anything sexual to be done to my nostrils. Whew! I'm glad I got that off my chest. Jay and Susan arrived yesterday with the baby, Owen Edward. I have to say he is the prettiest baby I've ever seen. He wasn't all wrinkled like a lot of babies are and I didn't come home and feel compelled to iron. Owen had on a little tobogan and it made hime look like litle a wee li'l hip hop artist. Susan is moving slow after the C-section, but doing well. It had been a difficult pregnancy in the beginning. Both she and Jay were exhausted and only managed to have seven hours of sleep since Saturday night when her water broke. They introduced Sadie, their Saint Bernard, to Owen. It went okay, but not as well as they hoped and they are laying low today to help Sadie adjust to the new member of the family. Jeff and I made them dinner and took it over there last night and we have other neighbors who will be taking meals today and tomorrow. I live in such a neat neighborhood. I'm still coordinating yard sale preparation amongst the neighbors. Jeff and I will price everything Friday night so we can just take it out shortly before 8am on Saturday morning. We have a lot of neighbors participating and I think we'll have a good time and pass on stuff to people who need it. I finished editing and revising the first half of the script last night. So far, I'm very pleased. I'm sure that if I took another look at it in a week from now, I'd probably see other things I would change, but is an artist ever really through with any of his creations? I added a dinner scene at the beginning because there needed to be a scene where the little girl tries to drive the boyfriend away. It didn't turn out the way I imagined, it turned out better. I believe that if you know the purpose of the paragraph or the scene you are writing and just start doing it, it will form as it should... typically in better ways than you can imagine. I have revised dialogue here and there to make it tighter or flow better. I should have the rest of the script ready for Jeff to look over this evening and I'll make my final revisions tonight so I can print several copies of the script out tomorrow. I'm told that I will most likely be asked for copies of my script by industry people at the Atlanta Film Festival and I should bring a few extra copies. I'm also going to make some business cards with my contact information for writing and include the URL for my on-line portfolio. I'll post a link to the script on my on-line portfolio after Saturday so people can take a look at the script if they want to. Work has been incredible. The amount of business I have received last week and this week has quadrupled over what I was doing since I started working on my own in March. I'm very excited, but cannot explain it. Realtors who would not give me the time of day a few weeks ago or now my biggest fans. I'm amazed at how much I'm still learning and yet it's amazing to see how confident I am now as compared to even a few months ago. I'm very grateful and enjoy helping the clients who didn't think they would be able to get a loan. The money will be nice too. In a completely unrelated note, I'm shocked at how completly excited I am about the DVD release of the first season of Wonder Woman with Lynda Carter. I wonder if it will still be as good as I remember almost thirty years later? I guess time will tell.

 A FEELING OF ACCOMPLISHMENT You've probably noticed that I haven't been posting as much lately. As some of you may know, I have been working furiously on finishing my screenplay for the Perfect Pitch Contest on Saturday. I had originally wanted to be finished this past weekend, but I had some unexpected things come up that slowed me down. However, it doesn't matter because I have finished. Well, I've finished the first draft. What happens now is that I will print the script out and reread it first for typos and other mistakes and then I will reread it to see how it flows together and to make sure each scene advances the story along and the characters are properly developed. I have to say, my characters surprised me. The mother ended up playing a bigger part in the story than I had anticipated and the next door neighbor ended up not being in as many pivotal scenes as I had imagined. Still, the little, the mother, the neighbor and his boyfriend are all very good parts. I've been thinking Naomi Watts would be great as the mother, but I think Nicole Kidman would do a fine job too. My only concern is that she is such a huge star that she might overshadow the part and the movie. I also think it would be fun to see what Ben Afleck and Matt Damon would do with the neighbor and boyfriend parts. I think they could have fun with it. They seem to handle the rumors about their relationship in a good natured way and it would allow them the opportunity to grow as actors. I would probably cast Matt as the neighbor and Ben as the boyfriend. The one character who really stood out for me is the little girl's best friend, Emma. She really turned out to be a hoot. The ghost of the father grew quite a bit too. It's interesting that some of the scenes I initially imagined didn't quite work on paper as I had anticpated. Some were cut because they would have added too much time to the script. Others just didn't work. Some were funny, but really didn't contribute to moving the story forward so they had to go. The most interesting thing was how the final climax came completely out of the blue today. It grew out of an analogy the father used and it was just perfect and it really worked. All in all, I'm feeling really jazzed right now. I feel good about the story. It's funny, but it's also very emotional at the end. There's a heart to it that surprised me. Now, tomorrow when I begin revising and editing, I may freak out and think it's the worst thing I've ever written. I hear this is normal. I still have three days left so I should be okay. Once I have finished the revisions and have the final draft, I'll make it available to anyone who wants to read it. Wish me luck!

 WHAT DID YOU SAY? I went with Jeff to The Home Depot on Saturday night to pick up some odds and ends. Basically, I just go for support and to push the cart. Why do they call it "The Home Depot?" You never hear anyone say, "I have to go to The Home Depot." No. They say, "I'm going to Home Depot. Does my hair look okay? No, I don't need anything, I'm just going to pick up a date." Well, The Home Depot is a very cruisy place for gay men. "Where are the work gloves? They've moved them! I'll never find them! The world as we know it is rapidly coming to an end!" "Why don't we ask someone where they are?" "No, let's walk over to this section of the store together and retrace my footsteps in a place where I know they are not." "Excuse me, sir. If I were work gloves, where would I live in the store?" "Aisle 12." We reverse our direction and find the gloves on ailse 12. However, I did let him down in the check out department. It seems that I didn't get the cart close enough to the check out counter and put the items on the counter in the right order. And it is so obvious to even a retarded person, you know! However, he had a headache, so I cut him some slack. Most people would just take aspirin. However, Jeff kept forgetting to take aspirin. I don't really understand that because if my head is pounding, I'm not going to forget the headache until it goes away. Then again, we all function in different ways so I will not judge. As we were tooling around in the garden department, a small black boy ran up beside me and wedged his way between my cart and a garden pond. He peered down into the water with astonishment and then turned to look at me and said, "Flah flof flah flah flah." "Excuse me?" "Flah flof flah flah flah." At this point, it occured to me that he might be (a) retarded; or (b) have a speech impediment. I admired his bright you spirit to choose to live with joy in the face of adversity. About that time his parents showed up and his father said, "Flof! FLOF! Flah floo fla fla." Then the mother piped in, "Flu, fludda flu flu flu." At that point I was flabergasted at the kid's ability to mimic these people. He spoke flah flah fluently... and without an accent. I was impressed. As I moved my cart away and followed Jeff over to pine bark, I remembered a girl that I used to work with back at TRW. My friend, Susan, will remember her, albeit her name escapes me now. She once made a comment about a vendor who called in that I didn't quite understand, but after hearing this little flah flah family, I finally understood. This girl released her call, spun her chair around and said, "She talk like she got shit in her mouth." "Pardon?" "She talk like she got shit in her mouth." And she was right. It was like this little family learned to talk with those sytrofoam peanuts in its mouth or was just too lazy to use their tongue to deftly whip those consonants off the back of their teeth. I smiled as I pushed my cart on and we headed into the air conditioning supplies. "Where's the air filters? Don't they believe any 24x60 air filters anymore?!" I smiled and said, "Let's ask someone."

 IRONMAN MIA There is a bond between a boy and his Timex Ironman Triathlon watch that cannot be broken. Imagine my shock when my watch disappeared. After Joel and Meredith returned home, I noticed that I had misplaced my watch somewhere as we had all shifted around to make room for them. I felt as if I was adrift at sea with oars. I had no stopwatch or timer. And when I ran, I felt naked. I wondered where it could be and after weeks, I let go of the matter figuring it would turn up again one day. Last night as I fell asleep, the idea that I should check one more time under the bed ocurred to me. I slept fituflly last night, tossing and turning the way skinned rattlesnakes do when thrown into a hot pan over a fire. At 5:30am I heard a softly muffled, "Beep, beep! Beep, beep!" It was the alarm from my trusty Timex going off. Then it stopped. I thought I must be dreaming. A few minutes later, it went off again. It sounded as if it was coming from under the bed. "I must check under the bed," I thought to myself. "I must find my watch." Once again, sleep overcame me. When I woke up, I made the bed and recalled the bizarre dream from last night. I got down on my hands and knees and looked under the bed. No watch. But it had seemed so real. Finally, on a gut feeling, I moved down to the end of the bed and saw a black shadow hidden behind a box. I reached out for it in faith. Sure enough, it was my Ironman. "Hello, old pal," I said as I slipped it back on my wrist. It chirped, happy to be home again.

 IT STARTED WITH EVERYTHING BUT THE GIRL As I was writing tonight, I suddenly had a hankering to listen to ebtg, or as they were known before their huge hit, Missing , Everything But The Girl. I opened my closet door and found Tracey and Ben right there in the "E" section. I pulled all the CDs out and shuffled through them to find just the one I wanted. Strangely enough, I was drawn to 1994's Amplified Heart, which is not one of my favorite albums at all, but I am especially fond of Rollercoaster and Troubled Mind . It is a very acoustic album and it did not seem to move me at a time when dance music seemed to be the only thing that would. I had actually allowed the album to be released and refrained from buying it for a few months before I picked up my own copy. It scandalous the way people talked about it. "He actually allowed other people to own it before he did. What he will he do next?" 1994 was a volatile year in my life. I had left a four year relationship with someone who was not just a friend, but not quite a lover either. It had always been unfathomable to me to leave any relationship, but there was a quiet calm in the chaos of my heart that said I was doing the right thing. I moved in with a friend who turned out be a nudist whose idea of fun was reading biographies of presidential first ladies and singing along to Cher and Celine Dion while ironing in the nude. A bout this time, I decided that I should get out more and was pleased when I received one of the leads in a revival of Neil Simon's Barefoot In The Park except this production changed Jane Fonda's character to a male and it was about a gay couple. It was great fun, but whenever people heard about it, they would always ask, "Did you have to wear a dress?" "No. I was gay, not transgendered or a transvestite." I would speak in a firm and audible voice as if I was addressing the elderly or a clerk at 7-11. The summer was long and hot and I did too many things, and in retrospect, too many people. I always seemed to enter into a Whore of Babylon stage after a relationship ended. I was searching for something, but not quite sure what it was. At times, validation that I was attractive and sexy were pleasing, but it was something else. Lust is as powerful as cheesecake calling to a dieter from the refrigerator in the middle of the night. Afterwards, I would like at my partner(s) and think, "Gee, that really wasn't that good. I should have held out for Sara Lee." I began making mix tapes of 80's music that summer. They were like aural photograph albums that captured bits and pieces of my history. I would arrange the songs in a certain order on each tape and then play them. I would close my eyes and try to remain very still and I could almost capture the moment again with all of my senses. At times it was somewhat stressful knowing just where to put a certain song. For example, Cruel Summer by Bananarama was released in the summer of 1983 in the UK, but was released in the summer of 1984 in the US. Which tape should it go on? I also spent a lot of time at the pool that year. I found that I actually enjoyed going down to the pool about 10pm and swimming for 20 minutes or so. It was typically deserted and a nice way to wind down my mind and body for the evening. It felt so good to come back to my apartment and climb in bed and pull the sheet up around me. One Friday night, I swam late and met a guy down at the pool reading The Celestine Prophecy by James Redfield. In an effort to overcome my chronic shyness, I asked him about the book and we struck up a conversation and we talked for several hours. We eventually stood by the gate of the pool in a pefunctory attempt to go our separate ways, but we were enjoying each other's company. Perhaps it wasn't for the healthiest of reasons. He came back to my place and spent the night. To tell the truth, it wasn't a night about sex. We played around a bit, but it didn't go too far. Mainly, we talked and slept and held one another. In the morning, we took a shower and he dressed to leave for his weekend job. I remember he sat me down on his lap and he looked into my eyes and I looked into his. I could see something that looked like treasure in murky water. I could almost make it out, but the undulating motion of the water made it impossible to see. In hindsight, he saw joy and happiness and expecation in my eyes and you could almost smell the disappointment on him. He had just been cast aside by a younger man, whom he obviously still cared for and as much as he wanted to dive into the possibilities with me, there had not been enough time to heal. It was an odd relationship. We lived in the same apartment complex. Sometimes he would call me in the evening, sometimes he wouldn't. Sometimes he would ask me to come over and spend the night and sometimes he wouldn't. Rarely did we go out on weekends because he worked part-time as a salesman in a department store. In time, I saw that he was a very angry man beneath the surface. I wanted to soothe that anger, but that only stoked the fires more. It went beyond the younger man of two months ago. It went much further and deeper than that. I felt that I must always be available in case he should need me and would always suffer when I would see the light from the televison through his bedroom window and he did not call me to come join him. I could smell the disappointment all the way in my apartment. I went to San Francisco for the first time in September of that year. I wanted him to miss me. He wanted me to have fun. I wanted to pull his string so he would say, "I love you. I'll miss you," but it was like his string was broken. I walked around Union Square listening to Sade sing Love Is Stronger Than Pride . The words tried to speak to me, but they made me just focus on the beats all the more. I came back on my 27th birthday. The reception he gave me was more than I had expected and it gave me false hope. A few weeks later he gave me an expensive camera as a belated birthday gift. He had gone out of his way to send a card and some cassettes to the previous boy for his birthday. He attended my own birthday party and didn't even give me a card. In the heat of an argument, I played the birthday card card. In his eyes, it was about material possessions. In my eyes, it was about taking me for granted. The gift was to appease his own guilt and make him feel better. It ended in the fall when I ran into him with his new boyfriend at a viewing of the aids quilt. I walked up to him and said hello. They were holding hands. I introduced myself and was polite and then excused myself. I went outside and held onto a tree, feeling like I would vomit all of my internal organs up at any moment. I felt betrayed. I felt hoodwinked. I was angry with myself because I knew something was wrong and I had asked, but he never would say anything. I thought it was my fault and I should try harder. We spoke on the phone that night and he told me he was really put out with me. He did fine job placing the guilt back onto me and it took several months to dig my way out of that snakepit. I blamed myself because he couldn't tell me the truth. He told me just enough of what I wanted to hear to keep me around and waiting, but never enough to let me know how things were between us so I could move on. Sure, it would have hurt, but I would have gotten over it. Instead, I experienced the pain of seeing the light from the television in his bedroom each night and the car of his new and improved boyfriend with lemon fresh borax parked next to his apartment when I left for work each morning. That fall, I decided that I was tired of pain. My friend, Tacy, and I began reading A Course In Miracles (ACIM) and listening to lectures by Marianne Williamson on cassette. This Jewish girl from Texas would talk about these teachings that Jesus channeled through a middle-aged, Jewish, agnostic pspychiatrist over a period of years. It sounded like something out of a science fiction movie, but the teachings were remarkable. Nothing is real or has meaning except for what you give it. I began to ungive meaning to him. I said I forgave him even when I felt I didn't and in time I did forgive him. A year and a half later, after he had moved out of that apartment, I was planning my move to Atlanta. I lay in the living room floor journaling and wondered if I had any unfinished business with him. I was quiet for a moment and then wrote down, if there is unfinished business between us, then let us meet again. I closed the journal and went to Target to pick up toiletries and literally ran right smack into him. He helped me pick up my tooth paste and other items. I smiled at him and cautiously he warmed up to me. I told him I was leaving to move to Atlanta in another two months and wondered if would like to go to dinner. We went the following week and we had a good time. There was no expecation on anyone's part. He had found another young lost boy to take care of in his new apartment complex and that's when I figured it out. I didn't need to be taken care of. I wanted to take care of him and help him. To him, that did not compute. He didn't know what to do with me. We ended the evening in my living room as we sat on the futon. He thanked me for the evening and hugged me. I could feel that he was genuinely glad that I did not haror any ill feelings toward him. He kissed me on the forehead and then on the lips. I watched him walk out of my life and closed the door. He was one of the most painful experiences I ever lived through, but never before had someone so shaken up the dirt and allowed me to find all the buried treasures in my own excavation. I discovered why I did some of the things I did, worked through those issues and moved on. The year ended on a melancholy note. I bought the new Kylie Minogue album entitled simpley Kylie Minogue . The songs Confide In Me and Put Yourself In My Place captured exactly how I was feeling. Tell me your pain and just you wait, matey, one day you'll get yours in turn. On Christmas Eve 1994, I drove to a stranger's home. He lived in a mobile home, albeit a nice one. I didn't find him sexy or even likable, but I found something attractive about so that I wouldn't have to go. For some reason, I didn't want to be alone on Christmas Eve that year. In the morning, I woke up and thought, "I should have held out for Sara Lee." I didn't know why I was feeling what I was, but I took a quick shower, changed and drove to my parents' house. As we opened a presents and feasted on turkey, I couldn't help wonder what my family would think of where I had come from that morning. I wondered why so many people around me thought I was so together and strong when I felt like a house of cards on the inside. At one point, I pressed my face against the glass patio door and felt my cheek become chilled. Surely, the next year had to be together. Determined, I pulled away from the glass and went to secure a chocolate-marshmallow Santa Clause.

 THE OFFICIAL SALUTATION OF CULT OF JEF I have decided that when I call people on the telephone, I will greet them with, "What are you wearing?" It's kind of seedy, kind of friendly and kind of concerned.

 THESE DREAMS.... I don't normally remember my dreams, but last night I did. Perhaps it's because I was asking for my subconscious to work on a particularly sticky spot in the script. In the first dream, someone told me that I had nice Jewish muscle. This sort of bewildered me since I'm not Jewish, I was wearing clothes that hid my physique and the conversation was about everything but muscle. However, instead of just asking what Jewish muscle is, I just pretended that I understood perfectly and was completey oblvious to the rest of the conversation as I tried to unravel the puzzle of Jewish muscle. Jeff says that dreams are basically our brains flushing themselves at the end of the day. Anything we came across in the media or a friend may have discussed is privy to make a guest appearance. I have resisted this theory before, but perhaps he's onto something. Yesterday, I visited the link of an artist who shared that she had miscarried and discussed how she was torn between telling people about the loss. She discussed the experience from many different view points, including what I interpreted as Jewish spiritual perspective. Perhaps this stuck in mind because I was inspired by the way that she chose to embrace this difficult time with strength and courage. It is she, not I, who has Jewish muscle. The other dream was not so poignant. Aliens came down in Dallas and my neighbors and I had to make our way back across Interstate 20 to Atlanta in secret. There were lots of big sand hills and the aliens had stolen all the hand soap in all the gas station restrooms along the way. However, they did not realize there was a convenience store clerk resistance. Sometimes I amuse myself without even trying.

 PUMPING As I was doing research on freak deaths for my screenplay last night, an article from Thailand caught my eye. The writer was waxing on about the evils of pumping among teenage Thai boys. At first, I thought this was just another way of referring to masturbation and I thought he should just leave them alone. After all, the teenage Thai boys could be spilling their seed into teenage Thai girls and impregnating them and retired Americans and Europeans are already handling that job quite well. I was about to left-click the back button and return to Google when I discovered what pumping actually is. Evidently, some Thai boys insert the end of a bicycle pump into their anus and pump their rectal cavity full of air. I assume that this produces some sort of pleasurable feeling, but I would be concerned that once the pump was removed that the boy might fly around the room like a runaway balloon. The boy mentioned in the article worked his way up to a double pump and on a dare from his friends, snuck into a gas station and inserted the air chuck from one of those air/water machines into his anus. No, he did not rapidly fill his rectal cavity with water by accident. After inserting a coin into the machine, the air was rapidly propeled with great force inside his body. I would think that the pressure of the air into his colon and internal organs would do some damage, but it seems that with all of the gases inside his rectum, it caused him to explode. Now this sounds a bit far fetched if you ask me, but I met with a client yesterday who is a massage therapist and she confirmed that if you perform a massage with a counter-clockwise circular motion on the abdomen, you can constipate them for days. Sometimes the things that just sound way out there, end up being completely true. The article ended with a female witness saying that she thought she saw fireworks going off. It certainly creates a picture in my mind.

 ODE TO A CHOCOLATE PECAN PIE Jeff was out of the country helping third world people build ovens. I was still a Web design student at The Art Institute of Atlanta and to this day, I still don't understand why the "The" in "The Art Institute of Atlanta" is capitalized. Sometimes I used to lay awake in bed mulling it over in my head until I thought I might lose my mind, but I digress. I was typing code on my computer. TIPPITY-TYPE-TYPE! TIPPETY-TYPE-TYPE! The door bell rang and it was Jeff from down the street. Did I want to go to dinner? Sure. We drove over to East Atlanta in his retro station wagon as he inhaled on a cigarette and introduced me to he who is known as Radiohead. We dined at new restaurant called Twang. I liked to say the name and did so many times that evening. I would always say the name with an echo as if I had just tapped a tuning fork. "TWANGGGGG!" We had a delicious, unforgettable dinner. (Don't ask me what it was.) For dessert, Jeff chose watermelon sorbet, but with one look at the menu I saw the one word that makes me smile bigger than a cat seeing a quad amputee rodent hopping across the kitchen floor.... chocolate pecan pie. Mmmmmm.... I can close my eyes and smell it even now. My tongue longs to know the textures of the pecan ridges and melted chocolate chunks again. I ate it slowly and investigated every crevice of my fork with my urgent tongue the way most bio-hazard teams mop up a toxic spill. The next day, lust was in my heart when I thought about that pie. "I must have it again," I thought to myself. When Jeff returned, we flew over to East Atlanta in my Miata, eager to share the secret joys of such a heavenly concoction. With each passing block, I could feel myself once again experiencing its chocolatey pecanessence, but alas, when we walked up to the door of the restaurant, it was boarded up, closed and cold. There was no longer any warmnth from freshly baked chocolate pecan pie issuing forth from Mama's oven. I grabbed the door firmly and shook it so hard that the alarm went off. Defeated, I hung my head and wept. "Curse those Roman barbarians!" Jeff pulled his baseball cap down on his head and drug me down the street to Grant Central and the police arrived. Inside, he ordered a pizza for us to share. "It's a pie to," he offered cheerfully. I half-smiled back and thought to myself, "Yes, but it's not the same thing."

 IS MICKEY MOUSE A WUS? I stopped over at Andymatic for a visit and he is at conference for creativity coaches, C urlLink oachamatic . He has created a new blog where you can read about his adventures in the Orlando area. I think I may want to be a coach some day. It's somewhere between best friend and a psychiatrist. Andy commented on how Mickey Mouse is boring in comparison to everybody's favorite opera-singing, cross-dressing, carrot-crunchy wascally wabbit, Bugs Bunny. I have to agree. Cartoons have made me what I am today. Every once in a while, I find myself singing to myself and I'll hear these words come out of my mouth: La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, abracapo-cus La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, pocus-cadabra It's from the cartoon with the vampire who changes into a bat when he says abracadabra and back into human form when he says hocus pocus. Then Bugs mixes up the words and turns him into a half human, half bat creature. Inevitablly, I'll look up and see people staring at me in bewilderment, but occasionally I'll see someone giving me a knowing smile. I know what song they will be singing the rest of the day.

 JOAN'S GOOD NEWS I called Joan back after I hung up with Jaspreet. She received a call about her resume from a chiropractor's office and they want to talk to her tomorrow. This is the first call back she has had about her resume. It's amazing what happens in your life when you change your thinking. We were discussing Jennifer Lopez for a moment and then decided to see what our J-Lo names would be. Joan would be J-Mu. Hers isn't bad, but mine is awful. I'm J-Blo!

 BEASTMOMMA SPEAKS Jaspreet, AKA Beastmomma, asked me to call her tonight to get the information for her pre-qualification for a mortgage. I found it interesting that Adam from The C-Blog will be visiting in a week or so and I was about to speak with Beastmomma, both of whom are people I would have never met without my blog. Jaspreet and I had a wonderful conversation. We took care of the loan information first and then discussed her first boyfriend from the eighth grade, George Walter Booth. Isn't that a great name? She met him in Catholic school and they carried on a torrid hand-holding affair behind the nuns' bad habits. She admitted to not being an outdoorsy girl. We laughed a lot and discussed some deep things but never got too deep in anything. I'm looking forward to lunch on Sunday. I have to figure out what her rising sign is for horoscope. Oddly enough, I never read horoscopes. She told me that I had a slight southern drawl, which is interesting. Most people don't think I have a southern accent.

 PLIGHT OF THE PIANO Jeff and I went over to Elaine's house to help her move her piano and some other furniture to the house next door. It actually turned out to be easier than we anticipated. Jeff was smart enough to suggest that we remove one panel of the fence and just walk the furniture through instead of going up and down both sets of steep steps. We were also able to avoid loading furniture in a truck, driving across town and unloading it. Elaine refused to watch while we moved the piano, which she believes is an extension of her body. If that were true, it could have just walked itself next door. Once inside the house, I was looking at Elaine's books. I did not see the copy of Methods Of Torture And Execution Through The Middle Ages that I bought for her as a Christmas present. As soon as I saw it, I immediately thought of Elaine.

 POWER FAILURE AT POWER CORE I had a very hard time getting up for the PowerCore meeting this morning, yet somehow I managed and made it to the 7am meeting. I felt very drained and dazed this morning when the mentor coordinator asked me what I learned at the new member orientation luncheon last week. Put on the spot, I responded, "I learned that I had my choice between a barbecue sandwich and a grilled chicken sandwich." Everyone laughed and it gave me time to download that file and remember hearing about a testimonial letter for the first time. Whew! At the end of the meeting, we each give a referral trigger, which is a short statement about what makes us different and a good candidate to give business referrals to. Today's question was what is your biggest distraction and how do you overcome it. It was pretty dry and people gave very serious answers. When it was my turn, I stood up and said, "The biggest distraction I have is female clients throwing themselves at me. I cannot tell you how many times I have been taking a loan application when a female client interrupts me and says, 'God I love the way you hold a pen.'" Then I gave my real answer. It lightened the mood and got everyone's interest. By the end of the meeting, they had decided that I was in the wrong profession and should be on television. There was talk about me trying out for some reality stand-up comedy show. It was flattering, but how do I explain to them that I cannot make myself be funny. What I think and what I say isn't created to be funny, it's just me expressing myself and my thoughts. There's no agenda behind it; it's just me. There was actually a time when I remember asking God to make me like everyone else so I wouldn't stand out with my sense of humor, but eventually I just accepted it and just allow myself to be who I am. Of course, now I'm drawing a correlation between expressing myself and expressing breast milk. I'd better stop now.

 FOR THE RECORD I hate to be called dude. There, I've said it. Boy, do I feel better to have that off my chest. It just sounds so stupid to me. Maybe it's too close to doo, as in doo doo. I don't know. I do like being called buddy though... or even bud. I'm sure it says a lot about me psychologically.

 JUST WHEN YOU THOUGHT IT WAS SAFE TO GO BACK INTO CULT OF JEF.... Through a strange twist of fate, I found one of my favorite websites that had gone MIA for awhle: urlLink http://www.sharkattack.com/ . It has a bunch of information on shark attacks from around the world and pictures of people who have been attacked and what they have recovered from sharks' stomachs. I love sharks. They get a bad rep, when in fact, they are really the victims. So many sharks are caught each year by Japanese fishermen who cut off their fins and throw their carcas back in the water to die... just to make shark fin soup! Whenever we go into the water, we enter their domain and we take our chances. I'll never forget the media frenzy over that boy in Florida who was attacked and it became the Sumemr of the Shark. In reality, there were less shark attacks that year than on average. Secondly, it turns out the boy was wading where his uncle was shark fishing. I thought it was odd that a man could wrestle a six foot bull shark onto shore.

 AND THE THEN TELEPHONE RANG.... So I'm standing in the doorway of the dining room whilst fellow History Committee members are asking me why Jeff doesn't have the correct dates on the captions for next year's historic photograph calendar. I'm just about to say, "Look, my job was to compile and order the images. I didn't even know that he had even written any captions yet. You obviously think that just because we are in a relationship and live together that we actually communicate," but then the telephone rang. It was Bonnie and she was calling to tell me that the builder is ready for Robert and I to be on site at the subdivision on the weekends beginning this weekend. Now, I'm very excited because I can pick up a lot of leads and business by being there. Then it hits me that the next two weekends are two of the busiest weekends of my life. I'll have to talk to Robert about scheduling tomorrow. I can work this Saturday, but the yard sale and the Perfect Pitch Contest are next Saturday. I can't work this Sunday because I already promised to go to lunch with Beastmomma, the original Curvacious Indian Diva (CID) this Sunday. Of course, next Sunday I could work, but I Adam from the C-Blog and his friends will be staying with me. I guess I may have to be a rude host and work. Hopefully, it will only be a few hours. Here's the interesting thing; I've started saying affirmations for fifteen minutes every morning regarding work and I'll be damned if the goals I am supporting with those affirmations are actually coming to pass. It really drives home the fact that our minds are indeed little computers and we program them all day long regardless of whether we are conscious of it or not. I received a large envelope from Capitol One today that contained a letter stating they had recently sent me another application for a platinum Master Card just like the one they had included in the big envelope. They had actually taken a sealed credit card application in a second envelope like they had sent me two weeks before and sent it to me in a bigger envelope. I thought this was the strange, but interesting market approach. In the end, I put it through the paper shredder. I have enough credit as it is. If there is one thing I have learned in the mortgage business, you can have too much credit.

 TEMPER, TEMPER My friend, Steve, sent me this and it's a gentle, but funny reminder to keep our cool at all times. A stressed-out woman on a busy boulevard was tailgating a man. Suddenly, the light turned yellow, just in front of him. He did the right thing, stopping at the crosswalk, even though he could have beaten the red light by accelerating through the intersection. The tailgating woman hit the roof, and the horn, screaming in frustration as she missed her chance to get through the intersection with him. As she was still in mid-rant, she heard a tap on her window and looked up into the face of a very serious police officer. The officer ordered her to exit her car with her hands up. He took her to the police station where she was searched, fingerprinted, photographed, and placed in a cell. After a couple of hours, a policeman approached the cell and opened the door. She was escorted back to the booking desk where the arresting officer was waiting with her personal effects. He said, "I'm very sorry for this mistake. You see , I pulled up behind your car while you were blowing your horn, flipping the guy off in front of you, and cussing a blue streak at him. I noticed the 'Choose Life' license plate holder, the 'What Would Jesus Do' bumper sticker, the 'Follow Me to Sunday School' bumper sticker, and the chrome-plated Christian fish emblem on the trunk. Naturally, I assumed you had stolen the car."

 PERFECT DAY Business has been picking up and I'm glad. I've been focusing on the positive, setting new goals and trying new things. It seems to be paying off and I have already surpassed my goals for the month. It's a bit overcast today, but the temperature is so pleasant. Buddy has decided to spend the day inside in her little cat bed. I think she's just trying to throw me off. She's plotting something. I started the South Beach Diet again yesterday. I got a bit too crazy after the Canadians came and I was having trouble settling down. Needless to say, I wasn't feeling very good physically. Processed foods and refined sugars make me feel awful after I eat them. It's amazing how much better I feel already. I bought the South Beach Diet Cook Book with one of the Borders gift cards my sister sent me for my birthday last year. I also picked up David Sedaris' new book too. They were both on sale so I didn't have to pay a dime. I'm always amazed at all of the delicious foods you can make from other things. For example, you can make mashed potatoes out of cauliflower. It tastes just like real mashed potatoes, but without all the startches. I was shocked to discover that my BMI is right at the top of what it should be for my age and height. It's the same situation with my height. I'm in good shape, I just want be in a little better shape. We're supposed to go to the beach sometime before the summer's over and I would like to look a little more fabulous than I do now and maintain it. Why is it that people in general find it so hard to eat in the way they should to take care of their bodies? We brush our teeth. We go to the doctor. Why is it so hard to try to eat the foods that are good for us and eat only the other foods in moderation?

 THE TROUBLE WITH JUNIOR I woke up this mornng feeling very inspired so I put on my running shoes, grabbed my MP3 player and walked down to the high school to do some cardio. It was a cool morning and I did a mile around the track before walking a half mile and then running another mile, etc. It feels like I'm getting more of a work out and burn more body fat. There were several women there walking and jogging. One had brought her children. As I ran around the track, one of the little boys would speed run up beside me and pass me like he was racing. At first, it was cute, but after a while, I thought to myself, "Isn't he to young to be compensating for an undersize penis?" Fortunately, he gave out after the first mile because near the end he would run out frome behind the bleachers and cut over inches in front of me and I'm almost ran over him. After my five miles, I headed home. I noticed Junior asleep on the bleachers, I guess that half mile he must have run wore him out.

 DIANE WANTS After I moved to Atlanta in the summer of 1996, I joined a screenwriters' group that would meet on Saturdays at the Fulton County Public Library across from the High Museum of Art. We had a contest to write a ten-minute screenplay about characters stuck in an elevator with a serial killer. I actually wrote two different screenplays - one comedy and one drama. This is the dramatic one. Well, it's actually a suspense-thriller. I thought y'all might enjoy it. I'll see if I can find the comdey screenplay. INT. OFFICE BUILDING - AFTERNOON An attractive woman in her thirties, DIANE, runs out of office, slamming door behind her. She pushes the button for the elevator repeatedly. Impatient, she lights up a cigarette. As she inhales, her eyes rest upon a ?No Smoking? sign on the wall. DIANE Deal with it! It?s an emergency. Elevator door opens. Diane steps into - INT. ELEVATOR - AFTERNOON DIANE presses button for the lobby. Camera zooms slowly into her face as she continues to smoke her cigarette rapidly. DISOLVE TO: INT. OFFICE - A FEW MINUTES EARLIER DIANE Jack, we can work this out. JACK What?s to work out, Diane? DIANE I know things have been difficult these past few months, but I know once the baby is born... our marriage will be different. JACK It?s already different. I?ll be home to pick up my clothes this evening. DIANE (laughing and crying at same time) Why are you doing this? Why are you trying to hurt me? JACK Hurt you?! JACK slams his fist against the wall. JACK (cont?d) Who in the hell is trying to hurt who?! DIANE Jack, you have to understand. It?s only natural for a woman to want to give her husband a child. I want to give you a child... a son. JACK Oh, I see. Why didn?t I see it before? You?re doing it all for me. Cut the crap, Diane! It?s all for you. Everything?s always been for you. You?ve always gotten everything you wanted ever since you were a little girl no matter what the price your family or anyone else had to pay! DIANE You?re not being fair. I want something to love and take care of... especially with all the late hours you?ve been putting in at work the past few years. JACK Diane, I?ve tried my best to make you happy, but it?s never enough for you. I?ve given you a house, a car, clothes, money, anything you wanted, but most of all I gave you my love. All I ever asked of you was one little thing. Why can?t you keep that promise? INT. FORTUNE TELLER PARLOR - NIGHT GYPSY, a compassionate, middleaged woman lays Tarot cards out on small table for DIANE who is smoking. When the GYPSY is done she looks at DIANE?s cigarette and clears her throat. DIANE puts out cigarette. DIANE I want to know about my marriage. GYPSY Yes, I can see that. The Queen of Swords is the card of marriage and needs a relationship, but you are are covered by the Lovers which indicates the marriage is at a crossroads. Happy times are behind you. The Ten of Swords indicates that you have lessons in humility to learn in the future. You must learn to temper your ego needs and quit being a slave to material desires as represented by the Devil. Somehow, the Wheel Of Fortune reversed tells me there is a karmic debt to be paid... possibly in a previous existence. DIANE What does that mean? GYPSY Karma means what you put out comes back to you. That is cosmic justice. Furthermore, the Empress reversed speaks of a creative project aborted and child not born. Are you expecting? DIANE Yes. GYPSY Let?s see what the final outcome shall be. Hmmmm... Death. DIANE Does that mean my baby is going to die? GYPSY No, it is not a card of death in a physical sense, but a transformation or a metamorphosis of some kind... a continuation of the circle of life. DIANE But what about my baby? GYPSY (closes her eyes) I?m sorry, my child, but I don?t see a baby in your future. DIANE This is crap! GYPSY No. The cards never lie. They just didn?t tell you the truth you wanted to hear. INT. BEDROOM - MORNING DIANE is holding the hand of JENNY, a young woman in bed. DIANE How do you feel? JENNY I don?t hurt anymore. I feel peaceful and... Mama came to me, Diane. DIANE Jenny, the doctors say you?re going to get better. You just need rest is all. JENNY Diane, you know that?s not true. It?s okay. Mama?s here. I?ll be with her and Daddy soon. DIANE Jenny, don?t talk like that. You?re scaring me. You?re all the family I have left and I?m not going to let you go. JENNY It?s not about what you want, Diane. Besides Jack will take care of you now. He loves you very much and you love him. Don?t you? DIANE Of course I do. JENNY I didn?t think you would ever get over Matt. He always seemed to hurt you so bad, but that only seemed to make you want him more. DIANE Yeah, well he?s ancient history. JENNY Remember the lake we used to spend our summers at when we were kids? DIANE Yes. Yes, I do. JENNY I want you to have me cremated and spread my ashes on that lake. DIANE Oh, Jen... I can?t. JENNY Please, Diane. Some of my happiest memories were spent there with you and Mama and Daddy. DIANE I can?t let them do that to you, Jen. JENNY Why not? My body will just be a shell and my spirit will be in Heaven anyway. DIANE I wish I had your faith. I wish... I wish I could believe as easily as you do. JENNY We all come here to learn different lessons. Promise me, Diane. Promise me that you?ll spread my ashes on the lake so you can always go back there when you miss me. DIANE I promise. JENNY Good. I love you. DIANE I love you too. Diane brings Jenny?s hand to her lips as she closes her eyes. INT. APARTMENT - CHRISTMAS EVE NIGHT JACK and DIANE sit next to fireplace. DIANE looks at JACK. DIANE Thank you. You?ve made this the best Christmas ever. I didn?t think it could be after Jenny. JACK I?ll take care of you now. Hey, I think you have another present. JACK pulls out a small box hidden under the tree. DIANE opens it and finds a ring. JACK raises his eyebrows as if to say, ?Will you?? DIANE throws her arms around him and kisses him. He continues to hold her as she gazes at the lights of the tree. DIANE Jenny looked beautiful at the funeral. Could we go to the cemetary tomorrow and put some poinsettas on her grave? JACK Sure. DIANE I hope she?s comfortable in that casket. JACK I?m sure she is. So tell me, who do you love? DIANE You and only you. DISOLVE TO: INT RUNDOWN BEDROOM - AFTERNOON Man on top of DIANE orgasms and rolls over. MATT is attractive in a ?bad boy? way. He lights a cigarette, inhales and then hands it to DIANE. MATT You?re a strange chick, Diane. I never knew a girl who liked it as rough as you. You can?t get enough of me, can you? DIANE (Sitting up) Not really. I just like to slum it every once in a while. MATT grabs DIANE and forces her down on bed. He gets in her face. MATT I can have any bitch I want in this town... and most of the men too. Don?t you forget that. DIANE Don?t hit me in the face! Of all days, don?t touch my face today. MATT Does your little white bread boy make you feel the way I do when he squeezes inside of you with his two inch dick? Do you talk dirty for him and scream how you want him to fuck you at the top of your lungs?! DIANE You disgust me. MATT You think you?re too good for anybody, don?t ya? Yet somehow you always come sniffin? around here for me to give it to you doggie style. Why is that, Diane? DIANE Only so I don?t have to look at you. What time is it anyway? DIANE gets out of bed and picks up clock on bedside table. DIANE Shit! The rehearsal is in thirty minutes. MATT moves up behind her as she is getting dressed and thrusts his pelvis into her. MATT Here COMES the bride! DIANE turns around and slaps him while Matt falls on bed laughing. DIANE You make me sick! MATT So when will I see you again, baby? DIANE You won?t. MATT (exhaling smoke) You?ll be back. INT. LOBBY - AFTERNOON Elevator opens and DIANE exits. She stops in center of Lobby and turns to look back in the direction of her husband?s office. INT. OFFICE - A FEW MINUTES EARLIER JACK sighs and runs his fingers through his hair. JACK Diane, you just don?t decide to have a baby on a whim. Look, maybe we could look into adoption. DIANE I don?t want to adopt! I want my own baby. I want our own baby. JACK You know it runs in my family, Diane. You know I had to watch my own brother die that way as a child. I still have nightmares about it for God?s sake! I couldn?t live with myself if I had to watch my own son or daughter die the same way. DIANE The doctors say there is a fifty/fifty chance the baby will be born healthy. JACK That?s not a chance I?m willing to take. DIANE Well, you?re gonna have to because I?m pregnant. A CLOSE SHOT of JACK as he stares at his wife. DIANE I love you, Jack..... Do you still love me? JACK I don?t know anymore. DIANE runs out of office. INT. LOBBY - AFTERNOON DIANE looks down at her stomach and places her hand there. Her gaze then turns to the cigarette still burning in her hand. She drops the cigarette onto the ground and rubs it out with her foot. DIANE turns around and gets back in elevator going up. INT. ELEVATOR As the door is shutting, a GRUNGY MAN, played by same actor playing JACK, gets on. The doors close. DIANE smiles at him, but the GRUNGY MAN looks back at her menancingly. They ride up in silence as the tension builds. The elevator stops again and a well groomed BUSINESS MAN, played by the actor playing MATT, gets on. DIANE smiles at him and he returns her smile warmly. The doors close and the elevator ascends once more and then stops to let the GRUNGY MAN off. As the doors close, DIANE turns to speak to BUSINESS MAN. DIANE God, I?m so glad you got on. That guy gave me the creeps. The BUSINESS MAN smiles at her again. She smiles back when suddenly the BUSINESS MAN pulls a piece of wire from behind his back and wraps it around DIANE?s neck. They stare into one another?s eyes as he strangles her. GYPSY VOICE OVER You must learn to temper your ego needs JACK VOICE OVER You only think of yourself! JENNY VOICE OVER Promise me! MATT VOICE OVER You think you?re too good for anybody, dont ya? JACK VOICE OVER You only think of yourself! DISOLVE TO: EXT. ALTAR - CENTURIES AGO BUSINESS MAN, now a SLAVE wearing only a loin cloth is tied to an altar at the top of a mountain. He has dark skin and hair. A MASKED PRIEST in long robes approaches the altar through a mist. The SLAVE pulls at the restraints to no avail as he cries for mercy in a strange tongue. The MASKED PRIEST raises a dagger above the man and then plunges the knife into the SLAVE?s chest. Blood splatters onto the mask. The MASKED PRIEST takes off the mask to reveal DIANE?s face, also with dark skin and hair. She reaches into the man?s chest and pulls out his heart which is still beating. DIANE holds it up above her head. We hear the roar of approval from the crowd down below. DISOLVE TO: INT. ELEVATOR DIANE finally takes her last breath. The BUSINESS MAN loosens the wire around her neck and DIANE?s body falls to the ground. The elevator stops and the BUSINESS MAN gets off. DIANE?s eyes stare blankly at the ceiling as the elevator doors close and the Wheel Of Fortune from the Tarot deck falls on top of her body. GYPSY VOICE OVER Karma means what you put out comes back to you. That is cosmic justice. FADE TO BLACK

 MONDAY, MONDAY The weekend went by so quickly, like the Batman ride at Six Flags Over Georgia. I didn't work on the screenplay at all this weekend, which throws my schedule off, but I may be able to make up for it over the next few days. That is life and one must learn to adapt and be flexible. Call me Gumby! Yesterday was church, a birthday lunch for Jeff's niece, helping Jeff take down part of Elaine's fence, walking four and a half miles, late dinner, grocery store and then a catch-up conversation with Joan from Convsersations With A Woman . There was a nice breeze yesterday, but it still seemed to be rather muggy. Growing up in Texas, the weather began to be downright hot and humid by the last few weeks of May. It's been relatively mild here, which Jeff says is normal. After the mega-carb birthday lunch, I found myself feeling extremely sleepy. My body is just not used to all the refined sugar in hamburger buns, hot dog buns, potato chips, potato salad, chocolate pie and banana pie. Now, I'm not saying that no one should eat any carbs, but for me, I tend to stick to fruits, vegetables, whole wheat pasta and whole grain bread. I find I have more energy, feel better and I don't take on extra body fat. I didn't feel like running yesterday, so I decided I would do some power walking. I grabbed my portable jukebox and walked down to the track at the high school. It was nice to see several African-American people with a few extra pounds working the track. I always find the people exercising without perfect bodies because it's much harder to be motivated without already having some significant results. If you already have a six-pack, it's easier to stay on track. I forgot what good exercise walking is. Granted, I was walking fast and swinging my arms for momentum, but I wasn't doing the little duck dance that many power walkers do. I was surprised at how quickly I broke a sweat. My only complaint about walking is that it takes longer than running. When I finished, I felt good, but somehow I rubbed a raw spot on the inside of my left leg. The only thing I can think that was rubbing against it were my shorts and they were fleece so I'm not sure what this is all about. All I know is that it is painful. I've started drinking my protein shakes for breakfast again. I don't care for breakfast. Every once in a while, I have a craving for waffles or french toast, but I've never beena big fan of breakfast foods. I'm usually in a hurry anyway. The shake is not bad and fills me up, but sometimes when you drink a lot of protein shakes, you miss chewing. I realized last night that I have been here in Atlanta eight years now. I was living in Marietta at this time. I had stayed with Jeff for two weeks when I first moved here. We were just friends then. It was exciting as I got to know the city. I did a little temp work until my job came in. Looking back, I really made the move by seat of my pants and I'm amazed that everything came together, but I had confidence that I would. I had visualized the move in my mind for several months prior to my move and it all came together just as I saw it. It wasn't until a year later that Jeff and I finally came together, but we needed time to get to know one another. I think that's one thing about gay dating habits that creates a hurdle in the beginning - our tendency to meet someone and go straight to bed. Granted, there are exceptions to every rule, and we usually think we are the exception, but I find that the most successful relationships I have had were with guys that I waited a while before I had sex with them. Instead, I spent time with them and got to know them. If I found that I liked them as people and friends, then we would become more physically intimate. It's the times that we took the express bus to the missionary position where I found myself wanting out of the relationship before the end of the week. They were always small little irreconcilable differences such as: the way he held a cigarette; how he really dressed outside of clubland; extreme neediness; crazy ex-boyfriend who didn't realize his crazy ex-boyfriend status; etc. The great thing about Jeff is that we already knew each other's personalities and foibles well before we jumped into relationship infested waters. It wasn't as easy just to dispose of someone once we found ourself repulsed by some personal habit and God only knows what that habit reflected back at what was inside of us that we chose not to see. Last night, Jeff was driving us home in the Miata. I turned to look at him and the wind was blowing through his hair. He looked so handsome. He turned to look at me and smiled, which made his eyes twinkle. I said to him, "You're cute. You can stay."

 HARRY POTTER Jefffifer went and saw the new Harry Potter movie tonight. I had read in several different places that it was the best Harry Potter movie yet. You could definitely see the difference in the directors' styles with the visual presentation in this one. The bits with the whomping tree were great and I loved Dawn French as the lady in the painting. However, all in all, I don't agree that this was the best Harry Potter movie of all three. I liked it a lot, but I didn't feel that it was the best. For one thing, this movie seemed to be on a red alert level throughout the whole movie. It seemed to plateau instead of having many peaks and valleys. I know this book's much longer than the first two and it not everything could be crammed in, but the slower parts of movies are like white space in graphic design. It allows you to rest your eyes and emotions. I also felt that Malfoy was more of a buffoon in this movie than any serious threat and we saw so little screen time from Hagrid and Professor McDongel. The new Dumbledore did a nice job. Emma Thompson did a great job as the divination teacher. Jeff and I both noticed that when Harry discovers who saved his life at the end of the movie, he was just sort of matter of fact about something that had just been so important to him. I feel like there was something inbetween that was cut out. Granted, the movie is already at two hours and 19 minutes. The closing credits are spectacular. I imagine the remaning movies are going to be even more difficult to lens simply because each book gets longer and longer and the complexity of the subplots grows. This book was originally going to be two movies. Perhaps they will have to resort to that for the upcoming books. It seems to have worked for Kill Bill Vol. 1 and 2 .

 ACT 1 I completed ACT I of the screenplay. It's actually coming along nicely, but it's tiring to write more than ten or more pages in one sitting. However, I think I write pretty quickly compared to most people I have talked to. Tomorrow I'll try to do 15 pages with a break in the middle. I'll do the same on Sunday. That means I would be halfway through the screenplay by Sunday evening. The characters are developing well. It's always interesting to see what comes out of their mouths. They aren't exactly following my written treatment faithfully, but the new directions seem to make more sense. I'm going to trust them. I've looked back and read over a couple of pages, but I try not to do this. Instinctively, I begin judging what I wrote and the point is to finish the script, take a day off to decompress and then read the whole script and make revisions. My concern is that some of the beautiful passages of dialouge I have written may need to be trimmed somewhat. A screenplay is about action and some scenes may be too long. I guess that's why we do rewrites. I'm really enjoying myself and it's been a long time since I have felt this way about anything I was doing. It feels good. They are playing Your Woman by Whitetown on 88.5. I love that song. It's too bad the whole album wasn't as good as that one song.

 CANADIAN CLARIFICATION ON LESBIAN SEX I received an e-mail from Merideth today. She's been to the blog and surived reading about herself and her husband, Joel. She did add that what she was trying to say the night we discussed lesbian sex is that most straight men imagine themselves in the middle of two straight women getting it on together. In other words, what some people might call lipstick lesbians. Glamerous nude women in heels, thongs, lots of hair, nail polish and tongues of steel. However, many straight men are shocked to find out that most gay women fall into happy medium between folky girl singer and MABEL (Macho Butch Lesbian). It doesn't quite have the same effect, does it? She went on to say that she wasn't sure if most heterosexual men would balk at the opportunity to have a go with two women, but she doesn't think Joel would. Although she did add that he could surprise her, but after meeting Joel and watching them together, I don't think he would. I would still wager that most straight married men would shy away from the oppurtinity if presented with it. Some fantasies are better in mind than in reality.

 PITCH 3.0 After her father is killed in the line of duty, a precocious eight-year-old girl falls in love with her middle-aged gay neighbor. When her neighbor attracts the attention of a new boyfriend, and she is unable to drive the boyfriend away by any other means, she decides she must kill him through various botched murder schemes involving Easy Bake Ovens, falling bowling balls, doll parts and Vaseline-covered skateboards. At the same time, her mother's attempts to find a new father for the little girl are thwarted when the mother unexpectedly walks into every hare-brained trap. This creates more conflict between parent and child as the mother struggles to understand the little girl's odd behavior. By the end of the story, the little girl befriends the new boyfriend and learns that she cannot control other people or situations out of fear, but instead begins to embraces life with excitement and a sense of adventure.

 PITCH 2.0 A precocious eight-year-old girl falls in love with her middle-aged gay neighbor and attempts to do his new boyfriend in with one madcap murder plan after another. Unfortunately, her widowed mother unexpectedly walks into every trap with hilarious results. By the end of the story, the little girl befriends the new boyfriend and learns that she cannot control other people or situations out of fear, but embraces life with excitement and a sense of adventure.

 PITCH 1.0 A precocious little girl falls in love with her gay next-door-neighbor and decides to murder his new boyfriend.

 IS IT THE SAME KIND OF LOVE? This morning, I woke up to NPR. Well, I always do. 2F's sets his clock/radio alarm to switch Public Radio on instead of an annoying bleating sound like a Bo-Pimped sheep. It doesn't usually wake me up immediately. Instead, I flail around in bed awhile dreaming of the gas crisis, the war in Iraq and typically someone's murder. It's very unsettling and as much as I like Bob Edwards, he just doesn't perk me up in the morning. So I got up and made the bed and out of the blue started singing "River Deep, Moutain High." It's an old Tina Turner song she recorded with Phil Spector and Erasure covered it in '88. Well, I started thinking about the lyrics. Tina sings about how she had a rag doll and loved it like nobody's business and now she loves her beloved like she loved that rag doll. I thought to myself, "I'm not sure that I want to be loved like a rag doll," as I carefully lined up the lines on the quilt the way 2F's has patiently instructed me to do. One of the other lyrics goes on about how her boyfriend probably had a puppy and he probably loves her like he loved that puppy. Now, this could imply beastiality if her intended grew up on a farm or just that he would like to get her on all-fours. I don't know. It still doesn't sound very healthy and just sets up an analogy to refer to her as "his bitch." I personally don't think that fondness for a ragdoll or puppy is the same as the love one feels for boyfriend/girlfriend/lover/partner/wife/husband. Granted, I think that the love a child has for a stuffed animal will generate a loving energy with the child's body and that's the feeling that they think of when they speak of love. I do believe that pets are very much a part of our families, but I do not love Buddy in the same way that I love Jeff. So what's the difference? Is it the sexual component? Probably to some degree, but passion fades in time and a deeper love runs through it. I don't mean to imply that I'm a victim of lesbian death bed in reverse, but in time, the friendship and companionship in a relationship takes priority over sex. It doesn't mean that couples should not have passionate moments, but you don't find yourself looking at him in the middle of the Wal-Mart sporting goods department and saying, "Take me! I'm passion's plaything." In the end, I guess true love is the unconditional love we should show both ourselves and others. Jesus had that right. Regardless of how you feel about Christianity as a religion, the man had it goin' on. He saw the child of God in every one and loved them equally. Jesus didn't say, "I love you all, but I especially love the good Samaritan with the big breasts by the well." He did not love them to get anything in return. He loved them because they were his brothers and sisters. I really need to work on that. I sometimes think we need to create new word for the different types of love. I know all about agape, but I think we need to define it even further. There is the love children have for toys. There is a love for family. There is a love for friends. There is a love for pets. There is a love for Bananarama. There is a love for our first girlfriends/boyfriends, which is usually ruled more by hormones and psychological issues than anything else. There is love for our significant other/wife/husband. There is a love for mankind. What are your thoughts about this topic?

 VASELINE INTENSIVE CARE MONKEY BUSINESS I have very dry hands. That's all there is to it. If I don't keep my hands moisturized, they crack and bleed. It's very painful. I don't like pain. I guess I'm just funny that way. As a kid, my mother would slather Neutrogena hand creme on my hands to keep them from cracking and bleeding. "If it works for Norwegian fisherman, surely it will work for you." Through out my adult life I have always had hand lotion near by both at work and home. In fact, I even keep a trial size tubes in my backpack and the car. I never know when I'll need it so I like to be prepared. Once a Boy Scout, always a Boy Scout I always say. One advantage of el mano moisturization is that I always have very soft hands. Women love to touch my hands. My friend Susan used to touch them for hours the way some women twist their hair around their fingers. It's too bad I'm not straight because it could definitely work in my favor. Now, being that use moisturizer for my hands very frequently, I find it smart to buy the big economy size pump of Vaseline Intensive Care Water Resistant Skin Protectant Lotion in my bathroom. It's sort of like how some gay men keep a two-gallon pump of personal lubricant by their bed for when they are flying solo or with a full cabin. However, I do not personally use my precious Vaseline Intensive Care Water Resistant Skin Protectant Lotion as a personal lubricant. I'm not sure that I want my genitals to be water resistant. Anyway, I've noticed that some point during a new bottle, it gets edgey and their is nothing worse than edgey hand lotion. Typically, I place my right hand undter the nozzle and push down with my thumb, which produces a proper, reasonable bit of lotion to put on my hands. By the way, it's best to open the door first or you may find yourself trying to get a grip on the door knob until the lotion soaks in your hands. I have moments where I have stood at the bathroom door fondling the door knob to no avail. Beginning yesterday, the pump began shooting hand lotion up in the air and several feet away, missing my hand all together. It's like going to bed with a sailor who has been at sea for several months. CHA-CHING! So there I am, left standing with a palm facing up, dry and empty while lotion criss-crosses the bathroom like disorganized crime tape. This morning,I adjusted my hand accordingly to account for my sharp-shooting Vaseline. Once again, there was an orgy of hand lotion over the bathroom. I feel like I'm up to bat in the World Series and unsure of how the pitcher is going to throw the ball. I'm not sure there is a solution to my problem, but I just wanted to share.

 TONIGHT, I MET TOXIC PUSSY Tonight I went to the Image Film & Video Center for a seminar on pitching my screenplay. I left early and got there five minutes late. Damn the traffic! It was an interesting mix of people. There were four men and the rest were women and we had nice racial mix too. Everyone was very down to earth, except for maybe one guy and it may have just been general male heterosexualtiness more than cockiness that made him seem so aloof. I have to say that I really enjoyed finding out the details of the other screenplays. Everyone's idea sounded very marketable. Oddly enough, one of the other men wrote a story about an eight-year-old girl whose mother died. Is that eerie or what? My screenplay is about an eight-year-old girl whose father died. However, his script is a supernatural thriller and mine is a black comedy. I also met the lady who wrote Toxic Pussy. I thought she would be some anime-obsessed chick with tatoos and body piercings. She could be just your average 40ish woman from the suburbs. She described her story as a raunchy comedy about a cat that escapes from a lab and passes gas, which kills people. Somehow it is befriened by a woman with enormous breasts and they are pursued by a detective. He must stop the toxic pussy before it has kittens. I have to say it was the most original story I heard tonight and I love the title. However, it's a hard one to pitch. Eddie presented the seminar. He teaches screenwriting at Emory. He wore a fedora and had a cain. I'm not sure if he needed it or if he was just being stylish with ambulatory accessories. Eddie gave good information and we had to pitch each of our scripts to him. I did a pretty good job the first time around because he didn't rip me up too bad. He had us work on them a few minutes and then we did it again and he liked it even better the second. He said my delivery was a bit morose, but I was just trying to project loude enough in the room where sound didn't carry well. I'll be zany on the day of when I have a mic. Eddie seemed to like my story too. He used it as an example many times during the course of the evening. More importantly, I like my story. I worked on it a bit this afternoon before the meeting and things are flowing much better now. Every day some new little detail is tweaked. On the day of the event, we have about 50-seconds to pitch our story to the panel of industry professionals and then they or members of the audience can ask questions. Surprisingly, this is a popular event to watch and the 250 seats should sell out. The great thing about this contest is that all the participants are having our work presented to industry professionals and even the scripts that are not chosen can still end up being produced. In fact, the screenplay that was entered is just sort of like a business card that is opening up opportunities. It may result in meeting someone who will ask a contestant to write a screenplay from an idea they have. The funny thing is that the contest isn't based upon how good your writing is. It's about how good your idea is and how good you can sell it to producers as something they need. It's funny how this is drawing upon the skills I have developed over the past year. The three finalists will be announced at the Atlanta Film Festival at 6:30pm after the contest. In the past, I would be very tense and thinking negatively, but I feel very good about this. In my mind, I'm already a winner because I have gotten turned on to screenwriting again and see how real the possibilities are. It's not so far away and impossible anymore. Plus, I really believe in this story. Eddie told us to keep working on our pitches and e-mail them to him so he can review them and help us tighten them up. I may have to take his class now.

 BARRY MUST DIE I was worried last night about not waking up in time for my PowerCore meeting and then I woke up half an hour before the alarm went off and could't go back to sleep. It was a rather quiet meeting. I nailed my InfoMinute right at sixty seconds and received some ooh's and ahh's. I went by the office and dropped off the settlement statements from last Thursday's closing. The attorney still has not received the Certificate of Occupancy (CO) and if he doesn't receive it by Friday, the lender will not fund the loan. This deal will close or there will be a reatlor, customer and mortgage broker after a builder. I went to the PowerCore New Member Orientation. I was not in the mood to network or be sociable today. The information was helpful, but I didn't care for having it at a restaurant during lunch. I don't like trying to eat and listen and participate at the same time. As soon as the meeting was over, I headed to the restroom. I cannot hold water for longer than 30 seconds, but soft drinks can stay in my bladder for days. Go figure! Anyway, as I looked down into the urinal, I noticed that someone had written on the little plastic pad "BARRY MUST DIE!" I contemplated it as I urinated and it left me with all sorts of questions. Who is Barry? What did he do? Why must he die? Who wants to harm him? Does he like Bananarama too? It was all too much. Finally, I had to walk away from it all or go mad. Bonnie gave me two realtor leads and I followed up on them. I got voice mail and have not heard anything back. I've developed a pretty thick skin about realtors. It's a numbers thing. Eventually, I'll land a couple more. I think the Perfect Pitch Contest has given me some new confidence in the other areas of my life. It's like a gentle reminder that I do in fact have value. We sometimes forget things like that. I haven't received any calls from the ad in SoVo yet, but typically it has to run a few weeks and people need to see it a few times before they call. Advertising and marketing is interesting.

 THINKING OF OTHERS My advice for Elaine turned out to be disasterous. Now she has to find a new place to live and be out of her current house in six days. If anyone knows of anyone in Atlanta looking for a roommate, please e-mail me. Also, my friend, Cherry, e-mailed me and she is returning home to Burleson. Her father is battling colon cancer and she is going to spend some time there to help her mom out. Gosh, it seems like only yesterday I was giving Cherry rides home from school and we were listening to Tears For Fears. She only lived one street over from mine. She is one of those rare women that can be your buddy and sex kitten all at the same time. If only my sexuality had not gotten in the way. Now she is an opera singer in NYC and teaches computer skills to the spouses of celebrities. Please think a kind thought for Elaine and Cherry's father.

 NAOMI, MAKE IT STOP! I'm having another reoccuring dream again lately. It's always the same. I'm doing crunches at the gym and suddenly Ashely Judd appears in Versace. She walks around the mat and speaks in a big words that even I don't know and would have to look up in the dictionary. I feel like she is trying to warn me or tell me something. Finally, she becomes frustrated and goes over to the butterfly press and works out her frustrations. Tentatively, I approach her and put my hand on her shoulder. She turns around, only now it's Elton John in Versace and his hair extensions are askew. It startles me and I wake up. What does it all mean?

 THE JOY OF GAY JFK Yesterday was a quiet day. I woke up early and sprang, literally, out of bed. I did things around the house in the morning and ran some errands shortly before lunch. I finally bought a 12-pack of Sharpie markers at Michael's. I don't know whey I wanted them so badly other than the fact that they come in a rainbow of colors. I have been obsessed with color, especially orange, since art school. Plus, I had a 50% off coupon for Sunday and Monday only. I went to Borders to see if they had the new David Sedaris book so I could use my gift card from last September, but learned that it came out today. I briefly flirted with buying Swimming To Antarctica , but talked myself out of it. I already have two more books to read before I do that. Besides, I don't need any distractions until after the Perfect Pitch Contest. Instead, I purchased a book on some database things I want to do with Dreamweaver MX. I'm helping Jeff with the Web portion of his book store and Jim with the Web site for his gourd artwork. Web stuff is actually fun again for once after the long two years of school. When I got home, I discovered the CD with all the files used in the book were missing. I called the Midtown store and they said they had three in stock. I figured that I'd go up there later that evening and exchange it. I received a lead from my Georgian Merideth yesterday. I believe I can offer a better rate and loan program than what he was offered, but I need to check on a few things this morning. I've started setting some simple and modest sales goals. For this month, I'm aiming to take one or more loan applications a week. Interestingly enough, I have in the two weeks that I've set and written down that goal. The mind is an amazing thing. I spent the afternoon doing the unfun portions of screenplay writing, which is planning and character development. It's a slow process that makes one think. Syd Field refers to it as the "Kick Your Ass" process and and I have to concur with his opinion. Oddly enough, I still didn't feel discouragement slip a mickey into my mental attitude martini. Elaine came by this evening and we discussed some options for her housing situation and I gave her some feedback on which option I thought was best for her. It seemed to help her. We also discussed the parts of her manuscript I read. She has lead a very interesting life. The story is about some experiences that are specific to women. I gave Elaine some feedback that I felt came from a storytelling aspect, but it's a tricky dance when you are discussing a story where you cannot completely understand the character's situation because of gender. Elaine seemed to think my comments were helpful, but the decision to make use of those comments is up to her. It will be interesting to see how the story develops. Afterwards, I drove up to Borders to exchange the book. A very cynical woman helped me when I couldn't find a replacement on the shelf. She asked me why I didn't ask them to hold one and I told her the woman said there wre three in stock and there should be plenty when I got here. She told me that I must have called some place else because no one would have told her that. I told her very nicely that unless there is another store answering the Phone Borders Midtown, I had indeed called the write store and spoke with Barbara and that is what she told me. If there was a problem with the information that was relayed to me, perhaps she should discuss it with Barbara. The woman's eyes turned to little slits and she walked off to check in the back. As I stood there waiting for her, I noticed an endcap of gay-related books in the computer section. I wondered why they didn't put them on the endcap of the gay and lesbian studies section. Did they uncover solid evidence that hot gay men are in fact attracted to computer geeks? Is there research that gay men will eagerly pick a copy of the HTML Bible for the coffee table when it's next to an endcap full of mysteries solved by circuit boy detectives? More importantly, why would anyone write a book called The Joy Of Gay JFK ? I took a closer look and realized that JFK was actually Sex. It was in a funny font and the word Sex was in a different color. I looking forward to see what pictures were inside The Joy Of GAY JFK . The cynical woman returned and gave me a copy of the book. I noticed her attitude had improved. Maybe she had banged her head against the wall in back of took a cat o' nine tails to Barbara in the stock room. As I was waiting for Jeff to get ready for bed, I checked some of the blogs I normally read. I was tired physically and mentally and actually found a ring of gay Atlanta blogs. They were interesting and I think one guy may live up the street from me. Small world! It also brought to my attention that I'm not a normal gay man. I do not ingest enough mind-altering substances or drink enough refreshing, adult beverages to fill a small kiddie pool. Nor do I post enough intriguing images of myself on my blog in various states of undress, pursing my lips at the camera to evoke a myriad of vacant and desirable looks. In short, other than the fact that I'm in a relationship with an other man and have a fabulous CD collection, I'm not very gay at all. However, I still enjoyed them anyway. In fact, I may read them again some time in the future. Well, I have a lot of e-mail that I have not answered and I need to look at a few other things for other people. I should be able to take care of my work priorities for today by early afternoon so I should have the rest of the day to take care of other things. The writers' group meets tonight and I'm debating if I should go. I have so much to do, but I get so much out of just meeting with my friends from the group each time. I did write a story already, but it's just a matter of how much I get done on the screenplay before the meeting. After the meeting I'll probably go to bed because my PowerCore meeting is tomorrow at 7am, which means I need to wake up at 5:30am. Tomorrow is a full day out in the field. Time to get to work.

 GOING TO THE DOGS I've been feeding and letting my neighbors' dogs out in the evenings.&nbsp; They consist of a little mutt, named Max, a tiny, fluffy toy poodle, Poochie, a sassy, black dachshund, Daisy and a fostered mutt whose name I forget.&nbsp; She's a sweet thing, but old and blind.&nbsp; I usually have to pick her up and take her outside and set her down on the grass.&nbsp; She doesn't like the grass for some reason and finds it best to squat on the deck and propel urine out of her body with great force.&nbsp; Thankfully, her other excretory functions are not spring-loaded as well.&nbsp; However, that would be some trick at the canine Olympics, wouldn't it? There is a couple who come by in the mornings and they leave me messages on notebook paper.&nbsp; Last night's message read" Jeff &nbsp; Fix dog food We be back morning Now, I admire people who can write a short, succinct message, which gets straight to the point, but don't deny me my punctuation.&nbsp; It adds the texture to the written language&nbsp;like the crunch to my food - pure pleasure!&nbsp; From the note,&nbsp;I have somewhat of an idea of what the couple may be like, but I found the beer bottles in the trash more telling.&nbsp; Somehow, I don't think Daisy, Max and Poochie have much interest in Bud Light. I always find it interesting to go into someone's house while their gone.&nbsp; I'm not sure what turns me on more: the fact they actually trust you; or knowing that you can do anything while their gone and they'll never know.&nbsp; I could go through all their drawers and try on all their clothes.&nbsp; I could have a keg party.&nbsp; I could put on a non-musical production of Rogers & Hammerstein's South Pacific in their living room.&nbsp; The sky is the limit.&nbsp; However, as heady as it can be, I never do anything.&nbsp; It's the opportunity that makes my nipples hard, not the actual execution or fulfillment of the possibility. In closing, I will say that the little foster dog has affected me this week.&nbsp; She has taken a shining to me and follows me around&nbsp;wherever I go while&nbsp;I'm there. Yes, I know she's blind, but I really think she likes me. While the other dogs can be anybody's for a dog treat, the little foster dog ignores them and prefers to remain quietly near me and wags her tail as I pet her.&nbsp; How did we ever become so close to these animals?&nbsp; How did we ever learn to trust one another and how did they learn to give to us so unconditionally?&nbsp; It amazes me. Well, it's been a busy day today and I have many things to do still.&nbsp; Have a great weekend.

 GUESTBLOGGER I have been kindly asked to guestblog for Ya Ya Empress while she and Chris the Great are in Italy. If you would like to check out my effort and her fabulous blog (Did I just use the "F" word?), click urlLink here .

 MIRROR, MIRROR.... I went to urlLink Billy's blog this morning and read his post BOO-KITTY!&nbsp; It reminded me again of why I like reading blogs, which is&nbsp;a frequent theme in my posts. We all have moments where something captures our undivided attention and adds value to our lives.&nbsp; It might be rocking a baby to sleep or hitting that home run that won the game or the first time you realized Madonna existed and should be worshipped.&nbsp; (I'm thinking about the people I know.)&nbsp; Jeff once shared a story with me of how he learned to love baseball.&nbsp; In the summer, his parents put him to bed about 7:30pm when it was still light.&nbsp; He used to hide out under his covers and listen to the baseball game on his transistor radio. Now, when I read Billy's post, I did not become teary-eyed, but I was touched by his experience.&nbsp; (You'll have to read his post to understand what I'm referring to.)&nbsp; There was something that happened in his past that had value to him.&nbsp; He interpreted it in words and put it out on the Internet for everyone to experience.&nbsp; Then we visit his blog, read it and it changes us.&nbsp; We're influenced by his words, his thoughts and experiences and we'll never be the same again.&nbsp; Some posts may make us laugh or cry or make us think or make us angry.&nbsp; They're like mirrors that reflect back what's inside of us and/or what would like to see inside ourselves.

 JUSTICE FOR KIRSTY I came across this article on the urlLink BBC News website regarding one of my favorite singers, Kirsty MacColl.&nbsp; In addition to being married to Steve Lillywhite, one of U2's favorite producers, singing backup for various musicians such as Morrissey and the Pogues, daughter of Ewan MacColl who wrote The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face, she was also a formniable singer and songwriter herself.&nbsp; Her most memorable songs include They Don't Know ; There's A Guy Down At The Chip Shop Who Swears He's Elvis ; A New England; Terry ; Walking Down Madison and T he Fairy Tale Of New York with the Pogues.&nbsp; After her divorce from Lillywhite, Kirsty's career began to pick up again when she recorded Tropical Brainstorm which included the hit, In These Shoes? , which was featured on Sex And The City and later covered by Bette Midler.&nbsp; In my humble opinion, Kirsty's was the better version.&nbsp; It's ironic and less "over the top," which allows the humor to shine through.&nbsp; Who else would write a song about an on-line sexual encounter with a man from Amsterdam and write a chorus that goes, "Sha-la-la-la-la get your rocks off baby"? In December 2000, Kirsty was diving off the coast of Cozumel with her two sons when she was hit by&nbsp;a speedboat in an area reserved for swimmers.&nbsp; Her sons witnessed her death.&nbsp; Click urlLink here for the original BBC News article. Deckhand Juan Jose Cem Yam was found guilty of culpable homicide in 2003.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr Cem Yam was fined 61 by a Mexican court after being found guilty of negligent homicide in March last year.&nbsp; He was also ordered to pay 1,450 in damages to MacColl's two sons, Jamie and Louis.&nbsp; Private investigators hired by Kirsty's mother, Jean, say they have new evidence about who was driving the boat when Kirsty was hit and the case has been reopened.&nbsp;&nbsp;Jean has created&nbsp; urlLink Justice For Kirsty &nbsp;where you can keep track of the most recent efforts to seen justice done and donate to the cause. All in all, it sounds like there is something fishy about this case and I'm glad it's being reopened.&nbsp; I was absolutely gutted when I heard that she had died.&nbsp; It was truly a great loss.&nbsp; The situation can best be summed up by quoting a line from Kirsty's hit, There's A Guy Works Down The Chip Shop Swears He's Elvis , "But he's a liar and I'm not sure about you."

 A SMILE TO HIS FACE I told Jeff about the poem that I wrote for him seven years ago and posted on the blog.&nbsp; He doesn't read my blog.&nbsp; He doesn't understand why I want to share the personal details of my life with strangers all over the world.&nbsp; He's kind of private. I showed him the post and the nice comments so many of you took the time to share.&nbsp; He smiled and thought it was sweet. As he walked away, I think I heard him whistling and had a bounce in his step.

 VOICEOVER CLASS #4 I walked into class just as we were starting this evening.&nbsp; The only chair available was next to Mr. Puppy Dog.&nbsp; Don't get me wrong, he's a nice guy, but he watches me through out the whole class.&nbsp; He may read Maxim , but I think it's just for the articles. There are several African-Americans in my class who have great voices.&nbsp; One has done voiceover work for PBS documentaries in North Carolina, but she has only made half of the classes so far.&nbsp; The two guys both sound good.&nbsp; One wants to go into radio and I think he'll do great.&nbsp; He just likes to read stuff too. He's not interesting in emoting noun articles.&nbsp; The other guy has some background in television or radio, but I don't recognize him.&nbsp; Since I seldom watch TV or listen to the radio, that would make sense. I find it ironic that my bachelor's degree is in radio/TV production. Suzanne, the word-stretcher, did not bother me as much tonight.&nbsp; I think I may be growing fond of her.&nbsp; Naturally, that scares the hell out of me.&nbsp; You let someone become privy to your trust one day and the next day your reading Dr. Suess to disabled children in the Macon Public Library.&nbsp; I guess that really wouldn't be so bad as long as I don't have to "Stretch Armstrong" the words. The Spanish girl is growing on me too.&nbsp; She is so dedicated to her craft and never afraid to interpret any piece of text dramatically.&nbsp; Who knew the ingredients in Lipton Onion Soup Mix could be so moving?&nbsp; And her encore of combining the soup mix with ground beef for zesty hamburgers?&nbsp; Fan-bloody-tastic! Paul Harvey Man still bothers me.&nbsp; I like his regular voice, but whenever he reads anything in class, it always sounds like he is a character actor in a Rodgers & Hammerstein musical after a night out on the town with a bunch of Russian sailors.&nbsp; Imagine Paul Lynde & Wayland Flowers &amp; Madame in Rent .&nbsp; That's what it's like.&nbsp; Stuart kept trying to make him read in a normal voice and it was very difficult for him.&nbsp; I suppose I can empathize, but I'm afraid it will lead me down the stoney path to become Saint Candyass. The professional dancer with the bad knees has been warming up to me.&nbsp; Her knowledge of the different places in the body that Americans suck air into is amazing.&nbsp; I think her voice would sound much better if she dropped it down a bit.&nbsp; Her interpretation and phrasing&nbsp;are very good. I forgot to do my homework this week.&nbsp; We were supposed to look up forty of the most misunderstood and mispronounced words by Yale drama students.&nbsp; Thankfully, I knew most of them already.&nbsp; We went around the room and had to pronounce and define them.&nbsp; Oddly enough, I knew what a quidnunc was and how to pronounce it.&nbsp; Even stranger, the word pronunciation was on the list. My inner smart ass came out a few times in class today.&nbsp; I think Stuart likes me, even though I didn't do my homework and I still struggle to blend.&nbsp; I really need to practice this week.&nbsp; I'd like the last four weeks to be very good.&nbsp; I'd like to continue studying with Stuart afterwards, but I just have so much going on right now. I wonder what I could next week to throw Mr. Puppy Dog off.&nbsp; I purposely didn't talk to him much tonight in hopes that he might calm down a bit.&nbsp; He has more enthusiasm than Burt Reynolds has body hair.&nbsp; He was looking onto my legal pad as I was listing Madonna singles in sequential order to stay awake.&nbsp; I thought about drawing pictures of muscular men with erections just to see if his eyes would grow wide and there might be an audible THUMP of his loins hitting the table, but I really don't want to encourage that.&nbsp; I just want him to mess with him a bit.&nbsp; I think I'll create a necrophilia lover's newsletter in Microsoft Word this week and have it casually fall out of my folder for him to see.&nbsp; I definitely did not get enough sleep last night and I'm meeting Jason to swim tomorrow morning.

 THIS IS WHY I AM A MORTGAGE BROKER I had a wonderful closing this afternoon.&nbsp; My golden couple closed on their new home.&nbsp; I loved working with them.&nbsp; They had the highest credit score I have ever seen and everything about them was wonderful: property; credit; assets; income; employment; etc.&nbsp; They were also very organized and were such a joy to work with.&nbsp; I think I shock clients with my quick response time.&nbsp; It's rare that you will not reach me on my mobile phone, but if you don't, my goal is to return a call within an hour, usually less.&nbsp;&nbsp; This time of the month is very busy for closing attorneys and they may close 25 or more loans per day.&nbsp; We should have had our settlment statement last night or at the very least early this morning, but we didn't receive it until an hour before the closing.&nbsp; I called my client to tell him how much to bring to the closing.&nbsp; It wasn't my fault, but I hate for things not to go perfectly. The sellers were the first to arrive and I had a very enjoyable conversation with them.&nbsp; The buyers arrived next followed by the two realtors.&nbsp; George loves to close with Mark and we typically have a good time.&nbsp; George is so funny.&nbsp; He makes our work so much fun.&nbsp; The other realtor, Andrew, told me today that I'm officially his lender and showed me all&nbsp;my business cards in his portfolio.&nbsp; He gave me a lead, which I called on today and the buyers asked if I would like to put one of my signs in their yard.&nbsp; I feel that I can finally relax a bit.&nbsp; I have been so focused on getting my business to this level and now I can just concentrate on helping my clients and realtors for awhile.&nbsp; I like meeting clients and making everything run as smoothly as possible for them.&nbsp; They have enough to worry about.&nbsp; I love giving good service. (Don't take a beautiful moment to the gutter.) Of course, the money is good too.&nbsp; All in all, to quote urlLink Daniel , today was magically delicious.

 A VIEW FROM I-75 I had major insomnia last night.&nbsp; Of course, this surprises no one.&nbsp; Most people who know me understand that I think sleep is the biggest waste of time.&nbsp;&nbsp; I could do so much more with that time.&nbsp; Last night I pre-qualified the my new lead who works for a major sports organization.&nbsp; Then as I was searching for some blank agreements to sell personal property for a For Sale By Owner (FSBO) that I'm working with, I found a folder full of poetry, short stories and plays I have written over the last 20 years.&nbsp; I decided that I must type a few up and feature them on my blog.&nbsp; I hope you liked them.&nbsp; I need to alot some more time to my personal website with my portfolio of written works. PowerCore went fine today.&nbsp; I have been asked to be Junior Deputy Referral Coordinator.&nbsp; I thinks that's what Irene said.&nbsp; She's going to Prague for two weeks in August.&nbsp; I'm also a back up in case she gets stuck in traffic, which doesn't make much sense if you consider that we live less than a mile apart and I would probably be stuck in traffic too.&nbsp; There was a couple there today who you can hire to go do your errands.&nbsp; They are called The Gopher Girls.&nbsp; That made me laugh.&nbsp; I have to stop doing that.&nbsp; The last time was during someone's infominute and everyone looked at me as if to ask, "What is it?"&nbsp; You can't respond back with, "I just thought of something my mother said once."&nbsp; It sounds like you're not listening or you hear voices. On the way home today I noticed that the car in front of me on the highway had an orange cone stuck under its wheel axel.&nbsp; It didn't seem to be causing any problem, but I wondered if the driver was aware of its presence.&nbsp; It made me wonder what I'm not aware of.&nbsp; This made me think of the character in Doctor Zhivago who doesn't realize how beautiful she is and goes through her whole life believing she is plan.&nbsp; What if I go through my whole like and never realized that I'm a total hottie?&nbsp; I never really thought about it because I'm no one special.&nbsp; I've only been asked to do gay porn fifteen or sixteen times.&nbsp; You know, I've never named my penis.&nbsp; Is that weird?&nbsp; If you name your penis, should you name your testicles as well?&nbsp; I wouldn't want to leave anyone out and have anyone get jealous.&nbsp; Of course that begs the question of whether the scrotum is actually an entity of itself or just a place for the testicles to hang around.&nbsp; So, I ask all of my female readers, if you have named your vagina, did you also name your ovaries as well? Inquiring minds want to know.&nbsp; I think the lack of sleep has caught up with me.

 NAKED I wrote this poem after the first time Jeff and I made love.&nbsp; I was still reeling from the surprise and astonishment of after being friends for two years, we finally came together in a way that seemed so natural, but we had both been resisting.&nbsp; He had never been with a man before and it was both exciting and terrifying for him.&nbsp; Looking back, it was for me too. naked you turn away from me reticent in your love you avert your gaze from the intensity in my eyes sexuality creativity acceptance and nourishment for the soul i can feel the tears run down your heart as my energy reaches out to heal you i can hear the cries of your inner child as he throws himself on the ground kicking and screaming with the fury of runaway horses while crying out to the universe for a gentle, reassuring touch i carefully wrap my arms around you like tissue paper around glass fragile i kiss your neck and feel you inhale my being relax and lose yourself in my breathing as the rising and falling of your chest becomes in unison with my own no words no promises just the moment when we can both lay down our arms newborn and naked

 MARTA I wrote this poem to be used as part of an art project that I have never completed.&nbsp; It was to be printed out in a column format as if it was an article torn from a newspaper.&nbsp; It would be centered on a canvas with bits of trash that you would find on the subway and Polaroid pictures of the narrator. &nbsp; I wrote it in the urlLink Caribou Coffee on the corner of Piedmont and Monroe in Atlanta in the summer of 1996.&nbsp; I had been thinking about lust, the past and Anne Rice, in no particular order. It's almost midnight and I am riding the

 ODE TO A DEAD SQUIRREL By request, I have been asked to post my classic poem about road kill: On my way home from work today I passed a dead squirrel in the road He was round and flat like a pancake, But his tail was still slightly fluffy His little brown eyes were open He seemed almost human I wondered if he had a little squirrel family Waiting for Daddy to bring nuts home for dinner With a little squirrel wife suffering from little squirrel post natal depression Little squirrel children squabbling Over a little squirrel prize out of a little squirrel box of little squirrel cereal A little squirrel teenage daughter Who never comes out of the little squirrel bathroom Did he worry about&nbsp;squirrel&nbsp;pattern baldness? Tree&nbsp;payments? If he got enough bran in his diet? Was he ever racked with little squirrel guilt over masturbation In his tender, teenage squirrel years? What kind of sound does a squirrel make during orgasm? Did he ever experience that dissatisfaction While gathering nuts one day? "Is this it? Is this all there is?" Was he really waiting to throw himself In front of that station wagon Full of ornery Cub Scouts On the way home in the car pool? A squirrel on the edge Driven to the brink of destruction Or maybe he was just gay Alas, I'll never know About that time a large, Hostess bakery goods truck rolled over the squirrel I watched the truck drive off into the distance With the squirrel stuck in the tread of the tire Disappearing Reappearing Disappearing Reappearing Going round and round Somehow it made me think it was the skit that Lucille Ball forgot to perform Were she and Vivian Vance secret lovers? I read that once However, they're both dead now And we'll never know Why doesn't anyone think to ask these things before they die? Then again, Perhaps I think too much

 EASY AS A, B, C Last night I went through all the blogs I bookmarked over the past six months and sorted through them.&nbsp; I tried to decide which ones I would really go back and read and which ones I was still interested in.&nbsp; It's nothing&nbsp;personal.&nbsp; There's just not enough time in the day to visit the entire Internet. After deciding which ones to keep, I put them in all in alphabetical order so I could access them easier.&nbsp; Some update daily, some once a week.&nbsp; I find something interesting on all of them.&nbsp; Some are political and some are whimsical.&nbsp; Most are nothing like my own.&nbsp; I like reading about people who are different from myself.&nbsp; I also try to comment on other blogs.&nbsp; It's nice to receive a comment and I try to spread encouragement and a humorous thought where I can. You may have noticed that I'm proof reading my posts pretty regularly now and using spell check.&nbsp; If my typing could keep up with my mind, I probably wouldn't have to.

 SAY MY NAME, SAY MY NAME Someone asked me recently what it's like to date someone with your own name.&nbsp; Well, it's interesting.&nbsp; Obviously, I do spell my name differently from Jeff since I do not believe in a silent "f."&nbsp; (Isn't a silent "e" enough in one alphabet?)&nbsp; Typically, when someone says our names, we usually know who they are referring to.&nbsp; It must have something to do with pheremones. When&nbsp;I answer the telephone and they ask for one of us by name,&nbsp;it's a little harder.&nbsp; Jeff suggested that I answer the phone with my full name, but I told him I couldn't do that unless I asked if they wanted fries with their order.&nbsp; It just seems too unnatural.&nbsp; So I'm not a team player in this arena - So sue me!&nbsp; Jeff had told me that I don't actually call him by name very much.&nbsp; This is probably true.&nbsp; If he is sitting in the same room with me, when I speak, it's not hard to figure out who I am addressing.&nbsp; Jeff calls me by name more often.&nbsp; We also have silly names for each other, which we use more often, but I'm not going to share those with you. They're not kinky or anything; I just don't want them to lose their specialness.&nbsp; It's like taking the Lord's name in vain. People generally want to know what it's like to call out your own name in the throes of passion.&nbsp; Upon reflection, I don't think I yell Jeff's name or anyone else's for that matter, which could be highly embarrassing.&nbsp; Several years ago I just learned just to say, "Oh baby."&nbsp; That way you don't stumble over anyone else's name later on down the line.&nbsp; When someone has your bits in their mouth, you don't want to piss them off.&nbsp; They may grind their teeth when they're angry.

 THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN INSIDE "I had never been with a black man before," my friend began, "But the thought of him fucking me, of having his cock inside me just really turned me on." Although I appreciate the fact that most people feel comfortable sharing most everything with me, his comment made me somewhat uncomfortable.&nbsp; "The only difference is the color of his skin." I reminded him.&nbsp; "It's not like sex comes in different flavors depending upon your pigment." Then I started wondering about what it would be like to have sex with&nbsp; a raspberry flavored/colored man. "No, that's not what I mean.&nbsp; I've never been attracted to black men before, but the thought of having a black man penetrating me, a white man, just really excited me." I began to feel that incredibly embarrassed feeling I typically get just before Lucy does something really stupid.&nbsp; This was beginning to sound racist in my friend's own innocent way.&nbsp; In his defense, he had grown up somewhat sheltered in a well-to-do, Southern family.&nbsp; "Why does it excite you?" "Because I know my father would die if he knew I was having sex with a black man, of having him inside me." "If you only had sex with him because he was black, that sounds like you are using him as an object instead of for who he is as a whole person.&nbsp; If I was him and you told me that, I'd be offended." "Use him?&nbsp; It was just a fuck.&nbsp; It's not like we're dating or anything." "That's not the point.&nbsp; You didn't have sex with him because you were attracted to him as a person.&nbsp; You had sex with him because he was black." "I really didn't put that much thought into it.&nbsp; So you're telling me that you've never had a one night stand with someone just because of some physical trait?&nbsp; Or did you get to know them as a whole person first?" He had a point.&nbsp; "I don't recall anyone ever being discriminated against because of the color of their hair or eyes.&nbsp; I'm saying you boinked the guy because it turned you on that your parents would disapprove of you having sex with a black man.&nbsp; If you had gone out, saw him and went home with him just because you found him attractive or liked his sense of humor, that would be different.&nbsp; I bet you wouldn't even go out with him again." "I would." "Really?" "Sure.&nbsp; He wore&nbsp;Ralph Lauren and drove a BMW and he had a really nice dick."&nbsp; In his own way, this was my friend's way of seeing beyond color.&nbsp; Then he added, "Besides, it's not like he's one of those thug black guys who wears all the gold chains and acts black." "I don't think I can discuss this with you anymore." My friend took a drag on his cigarette and was pensive for the moment.&nbsp; "It's funny you should get so bent out of shape over the fact that I find having a black man fuck me to be exciting.&nbsp;&nbsp;In a way, it's like I'm doing my own part for the civil rights movement." I looked him in the eye.&nbsp; "Do you really believe that?" "Of course.&nbsp; It means I'm not a bigot like my dad.&nbsp; After all, how much more can I give of myself to someone?" I thought about this for a moment.&nbsp;&nbsp;My friend was absolutely sincere in what he was&nbsp;saying to me, but it came out like he was telling someone, "Of course I think you're attractive.&nbsp; It's not like your missing a leg or something."&nbsp; However, at the same time I was appalled that his pleasure from&nbsp;being with this person stemmed from what the man represented in his Southern bred psyche instead of for the person that this guy was.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet in the South, there is an unspoken taboo that you do not date, marry or fuck someone of another color... especially when the&nbsp;skins contrast each so starkly&nbsp;as black and white do.&nbsp; Somehow, Asian or Hispanic is much more&nbsp;acceptable, but now days you see more and more interracial couples among young people.&nbsp; Attitudes are changing. In addition, you have the taboo of a man being penetrated.&nbsp; Nothing scares the hell out of a straight man, and some gay ones, more than that.&nbsp; It is all sodomy no matter how much love it is done with.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was one thing to know that your son was gay, but for him to be a&nbsp;passive sex partner, that was unthinkable.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, combine&nbsp;these two taboos together, and you've got something explosive. My friend had a good point though.&nbsp; Was there any difference between picking someone up because they were black and picking someone up because they were muscular,&nbsp;hairy or had&nbsp;dark hair.&nbsp; Sure&nbsp;the color of&nbsp;someone's skin crossed over into the&nbsp;ambiguous edge of&nbsp;racial discrimination, but when you really get down to the essence of it, they are all the same.&nbsp; You are attracted to them because of&nbsp;what the &nbsp;black skin, red hair, a muscular body build or a hairy chest or back mean in your psyche.&nbsp; Isn't it just as much discrimination to turn down a lean unmuscular guy only to be with a big muscular one? It's not like your rating both on their personality and values.&nbsp; It's just that this type of discrimination is accepted and not emotionally charged in our society. My head was beginning to throb. Finally, I decided to ask one last question. "Do you remember his name" I asked. "Sure," my friend said, looking at me quizzically.&nbsp; "It's Clay." For some reason, that made me feel better.

 LIFE AND THE BROWN LEATHER CHAIR It was a little slow this afternoon so I decided to tidy up the house.&nbsp; As I was upstairs cleaning the master bedroom, I noticed that Jeff had cleaned off the brown leather chair he bought last year.&nbsp; I had always wanted a chair like that.&nbsp; You have probably seen them at Pottery Barn&nbsp;or similar stores.&nbsp; I think he actually bought this one at Rich's.&nbsp; Typically&nbsp;the brown leather chair &nbsp;is filled with clothes or stacks of things.&nbsp;I recently cleared it out while he was in Central America and sat in it one evening, reading a book.&nbsp; It was very nice.&nbsp; It looks very stylish in the corner of the room.&nbsp; You can lean back and put your feet up and watch the moon and stars through the skylight.&nbsp; When Jeff returned, so did the stuff in the chair.&nbsp; I can't complain.&nbsp; It's his chair and his stuff.&nbsp; However, I noticed this afternoon that the chair was empty.&nbsp; I was surprised that Jeff left a flat surface uncovered and cheered him inside.&nbsp; As I walked around the bed with the vacuum cleaner, I noticed that there was actually a pair of folded pants&nbsp;that was not visible behind the arm of the chair.&nbsp; I sighed.&nbsp; "Life is like that," I thought to myself.&nbsp; "You go along thinking that your chair is empty and you prepare to sit down only to find a pair of pants there.&nbsp; Then again, you may need those pants someday."&nbsp; I smiled and headed down stairs to suck grime out of crevices.&nbsp; Perception is everything.

 SWIMMING TO ANTARCTICA I have been wanting to read urlLink this book for many months now and finally bought it a few weeks ago.&nbsp; I had purchased a book at Borders and realized that I was in love with the idea of reading that book, but I never would.&nbsp; Does that make sense?&nbsp; It's sort of like I was in love with the idea of the mesh club shirt from urlLink International Male , but it felt entirely too creepy when I put it on my bare skin.&nbsp; I'm also slightly disturbed that just about every store sells through urlLink Amazon on-line now.&nbsp; However, I digress. For those of you who don't know, Lynne Cox broke the men's and women's world record for swimming the English Channel when she was 15.&nbsp; She broke her own record about two years later.&nbsp; She has set a record for swimming the channel between Catalina Island and the California mainland.&nbsp; She swam the Cook Strait between both islands of New Zealand, the Strait of Magellan, the Cape of Good Hope, the Bering Strait and finally off the coast of Antarctica.&nbsp; She has an amazing ability to swim in cold waters that would induce hypothermia in&nbsp;minutes for the&nbsp;average person. I have found myself very inspired by her story.&nbsp; Perhaps it's because the past week I have found myself frustrated by challenges with my personal goals.&nbsp; What would it be like to throw caution to the wind and just do what I really want to do?&nbsp; More importantly, how can I be sure that what I think I really want to do is really what I want to do?&nbsp; What steps do I take today?&nbsp; What direction do I go in?&nbsp; My head tells me to do some things, but are they old programming of limiting beliefs from my childhood or my sense of True North? I was speaking with Joan the other evening and she mentioned that she thought my purpose in life was to be funny.&nbsp; "Have you ever thought of being a commediene?" "But I'm not funny, Joan." "Yes, you are.&nbsp; You're hillarious!" "No, you don't understand.&nbsp; That's not me being funny.&nbsp; That's just who I am.&nbsp; I'm not trying to be funny; it's just the way I see the world and express myself.&nbsp; If I tried to be a stand-up commediene, I would fail because I would be trying to be funny." "Then you should write a comedic screenplay." "That's what I did with the urlLink Perfect Pitch Contest .&nbsp; Remember?" "I know, but something may still come of that.&nbsp; Besides, you can write another one." It's food for thought.&nbsp; At a time when I wish I had more clarity, I feel less inclined to go to church.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though I was dressed and ready to go, I skipped&nbsp;the service today.&nbsp; I can't explain it any other way then by saying that the feeling that I should just stay home and read the Sunday newspaper instead was stronger than going.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was excited to see that urlLink Best Buy advertised that the urlLink Scissor Sisters album will be on sale Tuesday for $9.99.&nbsp; All I can say is that it's about time.&nbsp; I digress yet again.&nbsp; I feel like there is something going on inside of me on the subconscious level.&nbsp; I mentioned yesterday that I felt as if I was jogging in place.&nbsp; Something is going on, but I'm not conscious of it and it bothers me.&nbsp; It's like I have spyware running.&nbsp; I've been spending a lot of time in meditation, but the only thing that comes up for me is to stay aware of what I'm feeling through out the day and not to judge or blame myself.&nbsp; The other is to write, write, write, etc.&nbsp; Does blogging count? When Lynne Cox was crossing the Cook Strait, she was fighting unexpected tides that were carrying her out into the ocean when the weather unexpectantly changed.&nbsp; She told God that she needed His help to complete her task.&nbsp; She couldn't do it alone.&nbsp; They were in colder waters where the white pointer, also known as the great white shark, frequents and she suddenly felt a big fish moving under her.&nbsp; Fortunately, it turned out to be a pod of dolphins.&nbsp; They helped guide her along her swim.&nbsp; The dolphins&nbsp;would disappear and reappear as if on cue and led her away from rip tides and other dangers until she finished the swim.&nbsp; I am certainly open to a friendly pod of dolphins, but I guess the chances of them appearing on dry land are rather slim.&nbsp; Oh well... I'll remain open to the idea anyway.&nbsp; Love and peace.

 PUSSY AND PADS urlLink Beastmomma was in town today so urlLink Joan and I had lunch with her.&nbsp;&nbsp; Jaspreet, AKA Beastmomma, is preparing to meet a man she met through an on-line dating service.&nbsp; They communicated through e-mail for several weeks and have now been talking on the telephone until the wee hours of the morning.&nbsp; Although it's a long story, we have begun to refer to the promising young man simply as "Samsonite." (Mr. Totes came in a close second.) We talked about limiting the time they spend together on the first date to no more than two hours in order to avoid moving too fast.&nbsp; After all, there is nothing worse than having a breadstick in your mouth one minute and a turgid, throbbing penis in the next minute.&nbsp; I tend to think that if you want to see the person again, it's best to take your time.&nbsp; You have to let the pot roast simmer. "Okay.&nbsp; Let's think of some questions you can ask to break the ice when you meet in person.&nbsp; What is your favorite song?" "'Pussy Don't Fail Me Now' by Missy Elliot." She replied. I looked at her a moment, non-plussed.&nbsp; "Remember the conversation we had about no fellatio on the first date?&nbsp; This song would not help us achieve that goal." What is it with this week and the word "pussy?"&nbsp; It's not even a word that comes up with me that often.&nbsp; Yet this weekend, it has appeared like an uninvited guest and settled on my couch with its feet on the coffee table. Jaspreet asked us to go shopping with her to find something special to wear for tomorrow.&nbsp; Now I'm not one of those gay men who dreams of stepping into Will Baker's shoes when he suddenly has&nbsp;a coronary before one of Kylie Minogue's appearances.&nbsp; I would just as soon throw some curtains around the bitch and tie&nbsp;them on with an electrical cord.&nbsp; "Kylie, the Spiderman look is FABULOUS!" Jaspreet decided that I should call Samsonite and ask what he would be wearing on Monday evening.&nbsp; She dialed the number and handed her cell phone to me.&nbsp; The answering machine came on,&nbsp; the beep and then I was live and on the air. "[His real name here], this is Jef and I am Jaspreet's personal life coach." About this time Joan ran into another car that was speeding around a gas pump in the QT parking lot.&nbsp; There was a crunch and screams from the ladies. CRUNCH! AIGH!&nbsp; EEK! "I was just calling to find out what you will be wearing tomorrow evening.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; Buh-bye." My ability to stay calm in any situation never ceases to amaze me.&nbsp; Fortunately, the mishap did not result in much damage. Beastmomma did not find anything that struck her fancy so we went to urlLink Target so she could buy pads. "Are you embarrassed to be seen with me and my pads?" She asked. "Hell no!" I replied.&nbsp; "I'm not going to be wearing them."

 A VISIT FROM REID "I have something I want to show you," Reid said when I answered my cell phone.&nbsp; For some reason I looked around to see if I was on a hidden camera at the restaurant.&nbsp; Normally, I would hang up on somebody if they said this to me, but Reid was a friend and I was pretty sure it had nothing to do with a tattoo or genital piercing. "Okay," I replied.&nbsp; "Jeff and I should be home by ten or so." "Great! I should be there before eleven." When I arrived home, Jeff and I decided it was a car.&nbsp; As interesting as Reid is, he leads a life that is on the straight and narrow so there weren't many other options.&nbsp; When he rang the doorbell, we immediately opened the door, rushed past him and said, "Where's the new car?"&nbsp; Reid smiled and led the way down to his new blue urlLink Jaguar .&nbsp; I forget which model it was.&nbsp; My boss has a XJ, but I think I liked Reid's better.&nbsp; It was a shade of royal blue, not bright, but very pleasing.&nbsp; For some reason we immediately jumped in the car and drove to urlLink Krispy Kreme Doughnuts & Coffee .&nbsp; They got doughnuts while I perused the T-shirts, which for some reason I found rather cool.&nbsp; They split a container of milk and ate their sweets while Reid kept looking outside to check on his car. "I had no idea that you liked Jaguars." I mentioned casually to Reid. "Oh, I've wanted one for a long time, but I met one of the owners of the dealership working on a political campaign and he gave me just too good of a deal to pass up." "Well, I'm very glad that you bought something that makes you happy." We talked about different things for awhile.&nbsp; Jeff has developed this resistance to my theory that genetics plays a good sized part in individuals with fantastic bodies.&nbsp; It's not the only thing, but&nbsp;I believe it plays a big part. &nbsp;Jeff has a nice physique and his schedule doesn't allow him to work out regularly, but he has a flat, slightly rippled stomach and very nice biceps/triceps.&nbsp; I made the comment that his genetics really play a part in maintaining that.&nbsp; Now he has to mention how he drinks water instead of soft drinks and doesn't eat French fries.&nbsp; That's when I ask about the cinnamon rolls for breakfast and all the lemonade.&nbsp; Jeff made a comment about someone in Krispy Kreme who could have nice body like our friend, Eric, if he ate right.&nbsp; He said this as he shoved the last of his doughnut into his mouth.&nbsp; "It's what you eat," he said.&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's true," I replied, "But his genetics will allow him to quickly reshape his body with diet and exercise as opposed to someone like me who is basically as stick.&nbsp; It will take me longer and I won't be able to get as big as he could be."&nbsp; Somehow we got on the subject of Eric's height and I mentioned that he was 6'4" and Jeff told me I was exaggerating and that Eric couldn't possibly be 6'4".&nbsp; Jeff has this habit of dismissing my credibility that makes me want to ram an ice pick through his ears.&nbsp; (Isn't love a beautiful thing?)&nbsp; I told him that Eric told me he was 6'4".&nbsp; Reid laughed because he knows Jeff.&nbsp; Jeff told me that people often exaggerate their height to make themselves feel better.&nbsp; "Wait a minute," I said.&nbsp; "Why in the world would Eric need to make himself feel better?&nbsp; The kid is a Greek god.&nbsp; Secondly, he is a model.&nbsp; He has to know his height because people are always putting him into their clothes.&nbsp; He would have to know."&nbsp; Jeff asked Reid a question about the Jag and we never revisited the subject.

 SOMETHING GOOD Jeff did something for me that totally blew me away.&nbsp; It was totally unexpected and really showed how much he loves me and cares about me.&nbsp; It has nothing to do with sex, but I'm very grateful.&nbsp; That's all I want to say.

 AN EVENING AT EINSTEIN'S A friend of mine invited me to his birthday dinner at urlLink Einstein's last night.&nbsp; It's one of a few restaurants owned by a gay management company.&nbsp;&nbsp;I like it because they serve dessert in a test tube with dry ice.&nbsp; Ah ambiance!&nbsp; The food is pretty good too, but service has been kind of spotty in the past.&nbsp; The owners had renovated the building and it was very nice.&nbsp; It had a Pottery Barn look with an Asian accent.&nbsp; It was minimalistic with a lot of wood and very elegant. I was a few minutes late because I opted not to park in the lot across from the restaurant.&nbsp; I can't stomach the thought of paying $10 to park for an hour or so.&nbsp; I drove around the corner and parked there for $5 less.&nbsp; That's one of the only negative things I can say about Atlanta.&nbsp; I enjoy the restaurants in Midtown, but parking is terrible.&nbsp; Back in Texas there is plenty of land to cover in cement and park an extended cab pickup on. I was a little nervous about going last night because Jeff had to go to a barbecue benefit for an antebellum mansion here in town and I was on my own.&nbsp; I am a very shy person and at times, socially phobic.&nbsp; I can perform on stage and sing and dance without a problem.&nbsp; I can give a presentation or go to a lunch meeting with a client, but I hate going to parties where I don't know anyone and try to make small talk.&nbsp; The only person I knew last night was my friend. We sat down at dinner and I was surrounded by folks I didn't know.&nbsp; I remained calm and started by asking those around me what they planned to order.&nbsp; Two of them copied what I had selected.&nbsp; (Wannabes!)&nbsp; Then I asked everyone what they did.&nbsp; There were a lot of Information Technology (IT) people.&nbsp; One of the guys was a legal assistant and his boyfriend was a sales representative for children's books.&nbsp; It was interesting talking to them because they had unusual stories to tell.&nbsp; The sales representative, Joe, had a degree in radio/television production like I did and had wanted to be a screenwriter.&nbsp; I told him about the urlLink Atlanta Screenwriters Group and the Perfect Pitch contest.&nbsp; Brian had been the victim of a practical joke where a "friend" had a female call him and pretend to be from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI).&nbsp; She&nbsp;accused him of being in a hit and run accident.&nbsp; He had become very upset and was furious at his friend afterward. Personally, I would have immediately suspected it was a prank because the odds of me winning the lottery are pretty slim so I figure the odds of something terrible happening to me are pretty slim too.&nbsp; The woman asked where he was on Tuesday at 5:45pm.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would have told her I was in a sling in my boyfriend's dungeon with a fire extinguisher up my ass, but then that's just me.&nbsp; I tend to think pretty quick on my feet. "Isn't it illegal to impersonate someone from the GBI?" I asked.&nbsp; As it turns out, on Monday one of the attorneys in his office is going to call the female and play a prank on her as well using this angle.&nbsp; What comes around, goes around. The other intersting person I met was a Philipino juice-bar master at urlLink LA Fitness in Roswell.&nbsp; She was a spitfire of energy and we kept making inuendos about all the different ways people could be juicey.&nbsp; It seemed hillarious at the time, but in hindsight....&nbsp; All I can say is I was drinking iced tea and water. During the course of the meal, I was asked what I did for a living.&nbsp; When I replied that I was a mortgage broker, Joe mentioned that he would need one in a few months and Brian replied that he knew a girl at work who needed one.&nbsp; I suddenly felt very awkward.&nbsp; I'm not a shameless self-promoter, but gave my card to them both.&nbsp; I just don't like to mix business with pleasure per se, but I guess it was okay.&nbsp; They liked the card.&nbsp; Everyone likes the card.&nbsp; I guess it's the green and those damn hats. When it came time to leave, I realized that I had enjoyed myself and gotten to know many new friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeff was going to join us for drinks, but they were planning on going to Wet Bar and Jeff doesn't feel comfortable going to gay bars.&nbsp; I told my friend that the three of us would go out another time soon.&nbsp; My new friends expressed disappointment that I was not going and that made me feel good.&nbsp; Perhaps I will see them again some day.

 JOGGING IN PLACE Do you ever have one of those days, or weeks, when you look up and realize that you've been very busy, but you're not getting any closer to accomplishing your goals?&nbsp; It feels like your a ball bouncing in place or someone jogging place.&nbsp; You keep moving, but you're not getting anywhere. I'm one of those people that stays constantly busy.&nbsp; I'm also surrounded by many people who have turned a couch potato perspective into an art of leisure.&nbsp; They don't understand me.&nbsp; They say that I do too much and it wears them out just thinking about it.&nbsp; Although I believe that we should all take time each day to relax and do something we enjoy, these naysayers annoy the hell out of me.&nbsp; I sometimes feel as if they are not trying to support me, but in fact pull me down.&nbsp; I feel like Indiana Jones being tied to a love seat and forced to watch television for six hours.&nbsp; Those are six hours I will never get back.&nbsp; Instead, I try to look at where the majority of my time is going and figure out if these activities are helping me move to where I want to be.&nbsp; I'm finding that I do a lot of things around the house that are busy work and I can probably figure out a more efficient way to achieve all of my tasks. I was overwhelmed this morning when I got up.&nbsp; I sat down to meditate to figure out what is going on in inside me.&nbsp; The impression I had is that there are a few things that I have said I want to accomplish, but I'm not eager to do them.&nbsp; I put them first on my list of things to do today.&nbsp; I figure when I can scratch these things off my list, my energy will start moving again.&nbsp; It's odd to think of, but basically everything is about energy, isn't it?

 WHAT SHE'S AFRAID OF Every once in a while I like to remind myself that the world does not revolve around me.&nbsp; I also need to remind myself that there is 90% of the world that does not identify as homosexual.&nbsp; I would like to say that I like straight people.&nbsp; I think God gave homosexuals&nbsp; heterosexuals to enjoy.&nbsp; Just kidding.&nbsp; However, I really do think that it's important to have&nbsp;a diverse set of friends.&nbsp; My straight friends are just as important as my gay friends.&nbsp; Male and female are both equal in my book.&nbsp; (However, if the woman has a bigger penis, she may gain a competitive edge.) I enjoy having friends of different ethniticities and cultures because I find it makes me a richer person and cultivates understanding.&nbsp; This can be difficult because the gay community can sometimes insulate itself away from the rest of the world or anything considered "unfabulous."&nbsp; While reading urlLink Beastmomma 's blog at lunch, she commented on a theatrical production that she went to see last evening where people did dramatic self-portraits.&nbsp; In particular, one said, "Two things I fear are marrying a wife beater and&nbsp;my father dying before we can mend&nbsp;our relationship."&nbsp; I was struck by how powerful are words are.&nbsp; Individually, the may not carry much meaning with the exception of some like: I; nigger, Madonna; and Cher. Some words carry a lot of punch in themselves or are branding.&nbsp; However, when you begin to rearrange words to imply meaning, you paint on an emotional canvas. Perhaps that is why I like the challenge of writing free verse poetry. Now, look again at the words the woman said: "Two things I fear are marrying a wife beater and my father dying before we mend our relationship."&nbsp; I have never met this woman, but I know many things about her and I could probably write a pretty accurate story about her based upon the information carried in thosee 18 words.&nbsp; It really makes you think. I'll leave you with some Beastmomma's own impressions of this woman's words: As she was talking about her dad, she began crying. I wanted to rush on stage and give her a hug or save her or protect her or reassure her.&nbsp; Then she talked about the things she hoped, the first being to marry a good man because she thought she deserved it and two mend things with her dad. I was struck with her choice of the phrase "I think I deserve a good man."&nbsp; &nbsp;It seems that we all waver between what we fear, what we hope, and what we believe we deserve.&nbsp;

 EATING PUSSY I don't think it's possible for the stereotypical heterosexual male to own a cat.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Picture this, an orange tabby sitting on the couch next to his owner, a young male in his mid 20's.&nbsp; The cat is cleaning himself meticulously as the guy talks to his friend on the phone about women and sex.&nbsp; The cat's eyes grow heavy and he's just about to fall asleep when he hears his owner utter the words, "I just want to eat some pussy, ya know man?"&nbsp; Immediately the cat runs to the back bedroom and puts some cat nip, Friskies and his favorte cat toy in a banadana, ties it to a little stick and takes off down the road.&nbsp; The English language is funny animal.

 DOESN'T EVERYONE HAVE A TOXIC PUSSY? I went to Casino Night for the Kennesaw Business Association, which was sponsored by one of my PowerCore friends.&nbsp; It was a lot of fun.&nbsp; They had black jack, poker and all the different games at various tables.&nbsp; Most of all, it was fun just to sit around with my PowerCore members and watch them smoke and drink.&nbsp; Everyone is so happy when they drink. Mo had heard that I came in fourth at the Perfect Pitch Contest and asked me about it. "What did you do?&nbsp; Are you an actor?" She asked. "No.&nbsp; I wrote a screenplay and had the opportunity to pitch it to five people from the film industry at the Atlanta Film Festival ." "I just can't believe that anyone would choose anyone over you.&nbsp; You are so funny and talented."&nbsp; Mo is my biggest fan. "Well, the guy who placed first had a very commercial idea and he pitched the best.&nbsp; He really nailed it.&nbsp; The alternate who came in second had a good story idea that I would have put in the top three as well." "What about the third?" "Well, I thought she was another alternate and pitched okay, but her script was about a cat that escapes from a lab and kills people by passing deadly gas.&nbsp; It was called Toxic Pussy .&nbsp; It's a great title, but the story did not appeal to me." Mo just looked at me for a moment.&nbsp; "Did you say Toxic Pussy ?" "Yes, I did.&nbsp; I was told that it was a very close decision between her script and mine and they chose her.&nbsp; So the top three scripts are sent to people in New York and L.A. to be read and they choose one winner to fly to L.A. in December." "I can't believe you were beat by a Toxic Pussy .&nbsp; You must have been so disappointed." "Well, yes and no. I figure things happen for a reason and maybe it was just their time.&nbsp; I'm happy for them.&nbsp; Another opportunity will come along for me." "That's such a great attitude." "Thank you." Mo took a drag on her cigarette and picked up her glass.&nbsp; She paused before bringing it to her lips.&nbsp; "Doesn't everyone have a Toxic Pussy ?" I coughed as beer went down my windpipe.&nbsp; "I beg your pardon?" "I have a Toxic Pussy too!" She said, bobbing her head with emphasis.&nbsp; "We all have someone who has come along and seemed to have snatched our opportunity away from us.&nbsp; We may have felt like we were cheated, but we just have to trust that everying does happen for a reason." I smiled.&nbsp; "Mo, your Toxic Pussy is very deep."

 A FORGOTTEN NIGHT AT THE OSCARS urlLink Andymatic had an interesting link to a urlLink cuddle party on his blog today.&nbsp; Basically, it's an event where people get together in a safe space where they can be physically affectionate in a non-sexual way.&nbsp; Think of building a fort with the cushions from the couch.&nbsp; I think it's a great idea.&nbsp; So many people in our country have so many barriers up and don't realize they are starved for physical affection.&nbsp; However, I will admit that I'm a little leary of letting anyone get too far into my personal space without knowing them.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, there were a few Saturday nights after several drinks where I made some exceptions.&nbsp; Human behavior is so contradictory. I wonder if a cuddle party would be helpful for women who have been raped or sexually abused in their past or gay men who have recently been diagnosed HIV positive?&nbsp; Then again, how would would our girlfriends/boyfriends react to us cuddling with others?&nbsp; Could we have an open-cuddling relationship?&nbsp; What if you had the opportunity to cuddle with someone you found very physically attractive?&nbsp; Would the cuddling only excite you more or help you achieve a different space with that person?&nbsp; It's all very interesting. It reminded me of an experience I had many years ago.&nbsp; I had a friend when I lived in Dallas who worked as a male escort.&nbsp; In fact, he may have ran the company.&nbsp; He was never clear on the details.&nbsp; It was his nebulous edges that I found interesting.&nbsp; Anyway, one evening he asked if I would do a job for him and I told him no.&nbsp; He knew that I needed some extra money to pay an unexpected bill and my portion of the fee would be about $20 shy of covering it.&nbsp; He told me that the job didn't require any sex.&nbsp; It seems there was an older gentleman in town and he wanted company for the evening.&nbsp; It seems my friend overbooked himself or had wanted to spend time with his new boyfriend of the week.&nbsp; I think he actually told me one excuse before and one after.&nbsp; I agreed to do it, but I was a little nervous.&nbsp; So I drove the hotel, which I want to say was on the other side of I-35 in the designer district.&nbsp; It may have been the Marriot or the Hyatt.&nbsp; I can't remember now that I no longer live there.&nbsp; Anyway, I went up to the room and knocked on the door.&nbsp; A man in his late forties answered.&nbsp; He was dressed nicely and invited me in.&nbsp; He was an attractive guy and he may have carried a few extra pounds, but I found it odd that he would call an escort service for company.&nbsp; I called my friend to let him know I was there.&nbsp; There was a lounge area and we talked for a bit over some wine.&nbsp; We ordered room service and had dinner.&nbsp; Then we sat on his bed with our backs against the headboard and watched the Oscars.&nbsp; I think it was 1994.&nbsp; I remembered that he smelled very good and at one point he asked if he could put his arm around me and I told him yes.&nbsp; It felt nice.&nbsp; We laughed a lot and shared stories through out the shot.&nbsp; At some point, I fell asleep beside him and woke up later.&nbsp; The TV was turned off and he was watching me, smiling.&nbsp; I apologized and he said that he enjoyed watching me sleep.&nbsp; It was half an hour past the time I should have left.&nbsp; I told him that I enjoyed myself, but I needed to get home although I would have liked to have stayed.&nbsp; I put on my shoes and walked to the door.&nbsp; He told me I was forgetting something and motioned to the table where there were some neatly folded $20 bills.&nbsp; I told him I felt funny taking the money.&nbsp; He asked me if this was my first time and I told him it was.&nbsp; He smiled and put the money in my pocket.&nbsp; "It's not a payment," he said. "It's an investment in a bright young future."&nbsp; I smiled and I really wanted to stay the night.&nbsp; I didn't want to have sex.&nbsp; I just wanted to sleep beside him and keep him company.&nbsp; I moved toward the door and stopped. I turned around and said, "If you're ever in town again, you more than welcome to call me.&nbsp; I mean, you can call me directly.&nbsp; I'd be happy just to share your company at no charge."&nbsp; His eyes smiled at me and he said, "I don't know that my business is ever going to bring me back to Dallas, but... in another place and time, I would have liked to have met you."&nbsp; I knew I'd never see him again, but it had nothing to do with me.&nbsp; He opened the door for me and I turned to walk out.&nbsp; "May I kiss you?" he asked.&nbsp; I turned to him and&nbsp;nodded.&nbsp; He put his hand under my chin and pulled my lips to his.&nbsp; It was a gentle kiss with a dash of passion that&nbsp;made my lips hum.&nbsp; When he pulled away, my hand instinctively went to my lips to touch them.&nbsp; I looked into his eyes and said, "Thank you." He looked into my eyes for a moment and said, "No, thank you." Then kissed me on my forehead and I walked out the door.&nbsp; When I reached the end of the hall, I looked back before I turned and was still watching me.&nbsp; I waved and he smiled and waved back.&nbsp; On the elevator ride down I debated about going back, but my gut said that was the way it should be.&nbsp; For some odd reason, I actually followed my intuition and went home.&nbsp; I called my friend to tell him I made it home safely and then went to bed.&nbsp; For the longest time I kept replaying the events of the evening. I could not believe I had worked as an escort for the evening and earned $120 for not putting out.&nbsp; Maybe there was hope for gaykind. I went over to my friends apartment the next day and gave him the money.&nbsp; He was already tired of the boyfriend of the week and asked me how it went.&nbsp; I smiled and said that it went well.&nbsp; My friend asked if he tried anything and I said no.&nbsp; He counted the money and then handed me some back and then handed me an extra $20.00.&nbsp; "What's this for?" I asked. "He gave you a tip."&nbsp; I looked at the additional $20 and was amazed that out of nowhere I now had enough money to cover the bill.&nbsp; "Why did he do that?&nbsp; He paid for dinner and my time." My friend smiled at me as if were a child.&nbsp; "He enjoyed your company.&nbsp; That's how he showed his appreciation." My friend tilted his head to the right.&nbsp; "Are you sure nothing happened?" "No," I laughed.&nbsp; "Why do you ask?" "He called today and said that you were exceptional.&nbsp; No one has done that before." I smiled.&nbsp; "Does he call you every time he comes to town?" "Actually he was a new john.&nbsp; I'd never heard from him before.&nbsp; Do you think you may be interested in doing this again now that you see how easy it is?" "No.&nbsp; I think I'd rather quit on a high note.&nbsp; I just wanted to help you out, but... if he calls you again, let me know." My friend looked at me suspiciously and I realized that he would never believe nothing happened so I left. I never heard from the gentelman again and I lost contact with my friend about six months later.&nbsp; I think he moved to L.A. is what I heard.&nbsp; I wondered what happened to that gentleman and what his story was, but most of all, I hope he's doing well.&nbsp; However, sometimes I like to honor him when I have a college-age waiter who gives me good service and is personable.&nbsp; I'll tip more than I should as an investment in a bright future because there was someone who saw a spark in me when all I saw was blackness.

 ADVENTURE IN THE AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL GALLERY When Jeff and I went to Australia with some friends a few years ago, he decided that the "R" in Cairns was pronounced subtlely when locals said the word.&nbsp; I didn't hear it.&nbsp; I asked the locals about it and they said the "R" was not pronounced.&nbsp; Jeff continued to say Cairns with a "R" in it with such conviction that soon everyone else in our group was saying it that way.&nbsp; The locals gave us funny looks. Jeff also decided to correct me when I said the word Aboriginese when referring to the native Australians.&nbsp; He told me that there was no such word and that the proper phrase was "Aboriginal people."&nbsp; He tried to convince me that aboriginese had never been used.&nbsp; I was in the National Gallery hoping to see photographs of Kylie Minogue and Barry Humphries when I actually saw the word Aboriginese used on some text under a painting.&nbsp; Finally, I had proof.&nbsp; I pulled out my digital camera and took a close-up picture of the text.&nbsp; I'm not exactly sure where the three guards came from, but after I was able to breathe again I tried to explain to them that I was not taking a picture of the painting, but of the word Aboriginese so that I could prove to my boyfriend that it was correct.&nbsp; I was pretty sure they were going to send me to Tasmania, but they just made me delete the picture from my camera. I found Jeff a few minutes later and told him what happened.&nbsp; He told me he knew that aboriginese was correct and that he was just teasing me.&nbsp; I don't buy it.&nbsp; He was saving face after being busted.&nbsp; You know that you truly love someone when you are willing to be incarcerated in a foreign country on the other side of the world just to prove their wrong.&nbsp; Love is indeed a many splendored thing.

 VOICEOVER CLASS #3 &nbsp; My client called and was running late so we rescheduled for tomorrow at 10:00am.&nbsp; I made a quick sandwich, banana and Diet Coke and jumped in the Jefmobile, AKA '95 Mazda Miata and headed to class.&nbsp; I drove down Decatur Avenue, which becomes something else downtown.&nbsp; I drove by the statue of Grady, who invented anesthesia.&nbsp; I also drove by the hotel that caught fire during the 40's while several honor students were in town for a junior political convention.&nbsp; It was the worst fire tragedy of the time and may still be.&nbsp; As a result of that fire, we now have fire escapes and most of the safety requirements in hotels that we have now.&nbsp; There's a lot of history in Atlanta in spite of the fact that many people think Sherman burned everything down.&nbsp; Of course, we do a pretty good job of tearing down what Sherman left standing in order to build parking garages or Starbucks. I arrived at class early and showed up just as Stuart, my instructor, arrived with another student.&nbsp; He's 66yo, white hair, goatee and carrying a few extra pounds.&nbsp; He sat next to me tonight, which meant I had to be on my toes.&nbsp; I never had a nap today so I found myself becoming very drowsy during class.&nbsp; It's not an indication of my interest; I'm just tired. Mr. Crush was back tonight.&nbsp; He brought a copy of Maxim and kept going on and on about the pictures.&nbsp; Perhaps my Gaydar is broken, but he did seem to go on and on about those pictures&nbsp;quite a bit.&nbsp; "What's the story Lady MacBeth?"&nbsp; Personally, I'd prefer that he is straight with no interest in me because I'm "occupado."&nbsp; However, I am open to making new friends.&nbsp; I guess I just get suspcious when people seem that excited about me from the first time I meet them.&nbsp; Don't get me wrong.&nbsp; I don't have self-esteem issues.&nbsp; It just seems unhealthy when you meet someone and they show so much interest in you from the very beginning.&nbsp; There needs to be time to get to know people better before they want to be your best friend. We read passages of poetry tonight.&nbsp; I think I made progress with my blending.&nbsp; It's not as easy as it sounds.&nbsp; I find myself trying to blend all the consonants at the end of words with the vowels at the beginning of the words that follow.&nbsp; Plus, he wanted us to read with meaning and phrasing.&nbsp; I sound like I'm learning to read in the first grade, but I think I made some progress.&nbsp; Each week he gives us a few more details that we didn't have the following week. There are a lot of actors in my class.&nbsp; I think they're kind of weird.&nbsp; It takes a lot for me to say someone is weird since I tend to march to the beat of my own drum as well.&nbsp; These people are proud actors.&nbsp; They leap at every opportunity to interpret every word on the page outloud.&nbsp; I really don't think it was necessary to recite the class phone list with such emotion, but the magic seems to be lost on me.&nbsp; Suzanne wants to do books on tape.&nbsp; She stretches out everything she reads and it makes me uncomfortable for her.&nbsp;&nbsp; She creates a character for everything she does.&nbsp; So if you need someone to read a recipe for green bean casserole from the perspective of a single mother on death row, she's your girl. Connor is very enthusiastic.&nbsp; He's enthusiastic for about ten people.&nbsp; I wish I had his enthusiasm.&nbsp; There is an urgency to everything he reads.&nbsp; It's the urgency of someone who has to urinate very badly and there is nary a restroom in sight. There is another guy in the class. I can't remember his name, but he reads everything in this strange Paul Harvey versus Phyllis Diller voice.&nbsp; It is very different from the way he normally talks, but he seems to use it as his professional stage voice.&nbsp; It reminds of the voice you would match with a puppet for the Head Elf at the North Pole Toy Factory.&nbsp; He speaks very loud.&nbsp; I can almost picture the Head Elf saying, "Now don't mix the Betsy Westy dolls with the vibrators or someone is going to get hurt." When it' s my turn to read, I find myself becoming uncomfortable.&nbsp; I just want to read normally.&nbsp; I don't want to experiment with all the various ways we can say, "Guns and drums and drums and guns!"&nbsp; I think I have issues.&nbsp; A friend told me that my fifth chakra is constipated.&nbsp; I'm going to have to spin the wheel and clear that sucker out.&nbsp; Daddy's got to master this so I can become a voice for a character on Space Ghost .&nbsp; I think it's important to have goals. I realized tonight that Stuart is the voice of all those commercials you see on television for the Ford F-10 or S-10 pickups.&nbsp; He's done commercials with Alan Jackson.&nbsp; I forget how much is done right here in Atlanta. Stuart told us tonight that at his age, he finally understands how to play King Lear.&nbsp; It's the only Shakespearan role he has not performed.&nbsp; Only now he says he's too old and he'd have to drag the bitch in by her hair.&nbsp; This is a colorful expression for saying that he is no longer capable of carrying his dead daughter onto the stage as written in the play. In other news, Stuart's grandson is obsessed with his penis. And what 6yo is not?&nbsp; He also has a desire to see his teacher's underwear.&nbsp; Dont' we all?&nbsp; The little nipper also has some great advice for us voiceover students - "Fuck the punctuation!"&nbsp; Words to live by.

 EVERYONE LAY ON THE FLOOR AND REMAIN CALM I know many of you are most likely suffering from Jef withdrawals.&nbsp; It can't be helped, I'm afraid.&nbsp; I'm highly addictive. This morning was my usual up at 5:30am to be at the PowerCore meeting in Marietta by 7:00am.&nbsp; I was feeling a bit tired and my throat was scratchy.&nbsp; Naturally, I was picked to go first with my InfoMinute.&nbsp; I continued where I left off last week when my mind went completely blank.&nbsp; For some reason my fellow networking group members think I'm funny.&nbsp; When my blanked out last week, I made a little joke and all was forgiven.&nbsp; They went on about the rest of the meeting.&nbsp; The InfoMinute went well.&nbsp; I discussed "no doc" loans, which means that your credit score is so good, you can get away without showing income or assets.&nbsp; Of course, your rate is higher, but there is usually a reason you can't show income or assets right now. Afterwards, I followed up with my realtor partners and clients and then went to Best Buy to purchase a HP DVD Writer.&nbsp; I need to archive some pictures and music files.&nbsp; I'm trying to archive my massive CD collection in a more managable format and I figure DVD is the best format since each one holds 4.37GB.&nbsp; urlLink Jesse put the idea in my head a few months ago. I spoke with a good friend in Kansas City this afternoon while waiting for my client to arrive.&nbsp; It's amazing how even when we haven't talked in months, it's always like just picking up where we left off.&nbsp; If anyone was my spiritual soulmate, it would have to be him.&nbsp; I'll tell you the story some time.&nbsp; It's very strange. I tried to blog earlier, but Blogger was down.&nbsp; I'm not enjoying some of the new Blogger formats.&nbsp;

 PHOTOSHOP TO THE RESCUE &nbsp; One of the greatest inventions of the last decade or so has to be Adobe PhotoShop.&nbsp; It cane remove powerlines from your favorite scenic photograph or enlarge the girth and length of your male member to fire extinguisher size proportions.&nbsp; Of course this begs the question, "Do people kill other people or does PhotoShop kill people?"&nbsp; Wait a minute!&nbsp; What does this mean?&nbsp; I'm just trying to point out that basically most things are simply what they are.&nbsp; They are nothing in themselves, but only have the importance that we put on them.&nbsp; &nbsp; For instance, money is just bits of paper or metal coins.&nbsp; It signifies a value for bartering in our world based upon agreed trades of energy.&nbsp; I agree to do extend this much of my energy for you in exchange for this much money.&nbsp; PhotoShop is just a tool.&nbsp; It helps us edit digital images, create websites, etc.&nbsp; Yet I can't help but wonder what the use of a particular tool says about our culture.&nbsp; &nbsp; I did not think it was possible for me to receive any more porn spam than I do, but it has increased this week.&nbsp; What have I ever done to give anyone the impression that I would be eager to see horny teenage girls performing fellatio on a horse.&nbsp; There are only two things that one should do in a stable in my book: keep a horse; and/or have a baby.&nbsp; I've also begun receiving e-mails that show women being serviced by men with gargantuan mutated phalluses.&nbsp; There is now way these images can be real.&nbsp; If they were, the man would pass out every time he sported&nbsp;a woody.&nbsp; The human brain could not support that much loss of blood to any other part of the body.&nbsp; &nbsp; So I wonder what people will think of our culture when they look back a hundred years from now?&nbsp; Will they say, "Oh they dressed funny and liked to enlarge their genitalia through digital imaging."?&nbsp; It just seems like if you have enough of these porn spam e-mails flying around the Internet that historians will most likely think that was the interest of the population as a whole based upon volume.&nbsp; Then again, what if I'm the only person in the world receiving these e-mails?&nbsp; I shudder to think of it. &nbsp; I was reading another blog where someone mentioned removing&nbsp;himself from a photograph via PhotoShop.&nbsp; I think it would be great if you could just remove anything you don't like in your own live with PhotoShop.&nbsp; If you don't like your co-worker who sits next to you, rub her out with the eraser tool in PhotoShop.&nbsp; If you don't like your boyfriend's buddies, take 'em out.&nbsp; If you don't like your president, hmmm....&nbsp; Can it really be that easy to get rid of a Bush?&nbsp; Probably not.&nbsp; As a country, we can't seem to decide on anything and the Republicans and Democrats just bicker between each other.&nbsp; We would have so many political leaders being rubbed out of office each second that it would seem like one of those cartoons that send Japanese school children into seizures. &nbsp; All in all, I was quite shocked to realize that there aren't really any people that I can't stand.&nbsp; There are a few people whose personalities don't click with mine, but nothing I can't work around for us to remain pleasant.&nbsp; For the most part, I get on with just about everybody.&nbsp; What a waste of PhotoShop.&nbsp; I guess I'll just have to make my genitalia bigger.

 RAINBOW BOYS &nbsp; Now that 2F's is collecting books for his store, it's always interesting to see what he comes home with from book buying expeditions.&nbsp; It's sort of like rushing to the bottom of a box of cereal or Cracker Jacks. &nbsp; Recently he came home with a copy of Rainbow Boys by Alex Sanchez.&nbsp; I recognized the book and recalled that one member of my writing group actually knows Alex.&nbsp; I decided to read it and I have to say it's like reading a gay Harry Potter. &nbsp; The story is about three high school seniors who are all at some point in their coming out process.&nbsp; Nelson is your loud and queer student.&nbsp; Kyle, his best friend, is the studious member of the swim team and Jason is the basketball player caught between his girlfriend and his attraction for Kyle.&nbsp; Each chapter is from the perspective of a different character and it's an addictive read.&nbsp; I read 170 pages last night and would have read more if I had not made myself go to bed.&nbsp; I have come to realize that I'm a romance junkie.&nbsp; After I got over the initial shock, I have accepted the fact that I enjoy a good love story.&nbsp; I don't mean sex.&nbsp; I mean love story and Rainbow Boys has a good one.&nbsp; &nbsp; I am really impressed at how Alex worked so many contemporary themes into this book.&nbsp; It is amazing how things have changed since I first came out in 1989 as compared to how things are now days.&nbsp; GLBT kids come out on average at the age of 15.&nbsp; &nbsp; 2F's had already made it through half of the book before I picked it up.&nbsp; (The man reads at light speed.)&nbsp; I was asking him last night about his impressions of the story and he gave it good marks.&nbsp; He said it made him wonder what his life would have been like if (a) he had realized he was gay when he was a teenager, (b) it had been more acceptable to be gay at that time, and (c) his religious beliefs had not prevented him from accepting his sexuality.&nbsp; There was quite a bit of sadness in his voice when he said this.&nbsp; It's not because he wanted to go out and sow his wild oats.&nbsp; That's not the kind of guy he is.&nbsp; My partner did not come out until he was almost 38 years old and the progress he has made has been impressive.&nbsp; Still, it has to be difficult to have lived almost 40 years without consciously knowing who and what you are and being unable to accept it.&nbsp; Looking on the bright side, at least he is aware of&nbsp;who and what he is&nbsp;now and takes each day as it comes.&nbsp;&nbsp; He's living his life more fully, but he still has his challenging moments.&nbsp; I've noticed that with each year there seems to be more of a modest activist coming to life in him.&nbsp; All in all, I'm very proud of him. &nbsp; I found this information on Alex's website that might be helpful for any writers out there: &nbsp; What advice would you give to young writers? Have you ever been to a museum and seen an art student with an easel copying a painting hanging on the wall? The equivalent applies to writing. Take a book that moves you and actually copy your favorite parts. It will reveal much about what makes good writing. It's a great way to learn. In addition, read your work aloud. When you write, appeal to as many of the reader's senses as possible-visual images, sounds, tastes, smells, and textures. Use dialog sparingly. Actions really do speak louder than words. And above all, surround yourself with people who will give you confidence and build you up as a writer. Encouragement is so important. &nbsp;

 SHALL WE DANCE? &nbsp; Whilst waiting for my pot roast to simmer, I explored another new blog.&nbsp; Check out today's entry on urlLink Confessions Of A Gay Guy , which is Dances With Goats .&nbsp; It's very clever, probably true and both shocking and amusing.&nbsp; Oops!&nbsp; It's time to turn my rump roast over.

 THIS IS WHAT BLOGGING IS ALL ABOUT &nbsp; I've been roaming the Internet looking at other blogs, particularly by people whose lives are not similar to mine - gay white male with a three-legged cat and obsessed with Bananarama and shark research.&nbsp; &nbsp; I found a blog by urlLink Linda and her last entry regarding abortion from July 19th was very powerful.&nbsp; I highly recommend reading it and giving her some feedback.&nbsp; Her story is very moving and shows just how complicated our decisions can be.&nbsp; Furthermore, at times we may even choose for freedoms for all even though in certain circumstances we may choose not to embrace that freedom. &nbsp; I don't know how many of you have ever read urlLink Rebecca Blood 's book on weblogs, but in the beginning she mentions how many of them consisted of posting links to different topics and issues and showing both sides of the coin.&nbsp; The purpose was to have readers learn more about each side and come to their own conclusions and comment.&nbsp; &nbsp; The Internet community is a powerful ware to share information and ideas in a way that forces us to think and sift through our identities in ways to constantly reshape ourselves.&nbsp; We are not stagnant; we are ever changing.&nbsp; I like the idea of going to to a website and being moved by something I read as well as receiving a laugh.&nbsp; I like reading retelling of private moments that may have no significance to anyone else, but remain special to the author.&nbsp; &nbsp; We are truly a global village and my perspective is being changed to encompass the opinions and needs of people beyond Atlanta and beyond the U.S.&nbsp; Even though we all may be miles apart, our words and thoughts keep us all nearer than our hearts.

 I, ROBOT &nbsp; Jefffifer went to see I, Robot with Paul, Boo, Rachel and Doug last night.&nbsp; We went to the Buckhead Backlot where you can eat dinner while you watch the movie. It's basically bar food and the service is much to be desired, but it is convenient at times.&nbsp; There were other movies I probably would have seen before this one, but most of our group had already seen them so I was ready to see this movie.&nbsp; The effects looked cool and the robots reminded me of Bjork's video for urlLink All Is Full Of Love . &nbsp; I have never read the original short story, but I believe the only thing that remained from Isaac Aismov's prose are the three laws.&nbsp; Everything else was new.&nbsp; The acting was good. The action was good.&nbsp; It was your basic formula-driven, summer blockbuster. &nbsp; Will Smith once again plays an angry blackman and it works well with this story.&nbsp; He's definitely kept up with his workout regime since Ali because I was impressed with his body.&nbsp; He has a definite V-shape and his legs look massive.&nbsp; We really didn't need the shot of his naked butt in the shower, but I guess it's the obligatory eye candy.&nbsp; &nbsp; After the movie was over, I wondered if I made a movie called Uncircumcized , would it be politically correct to sell a DVD with the Director's Cut.

 HAPPY ANNIVERSARY TO JEFFFIFER &nbsp; Jeff and I have officially been together for seven years as of July 15th.&nbsp; When I look back, on some levels I think it's amazing that we have stayed together for so long.&nbsp; On other levels, it makes perfect sense.&nbsp; &nbsp; In the beginning, I kind of made a big deal about it and he looked at me as if I had suggested that we take Ground Hog Day off and throw a party.&nbsp; Eventually, I just settled for realizing it had come and passed a few weeks earlier.&nbsp; I would look up from the newspaper and say to him, "By the way, happy belated anniversary."&nbsp; Then I would go back to&nbsp;Marilyn Van Savant in Parade Magazine . &nbsp; This year has probably been the most challenging.&nbsp; I've basically gone to work for myself and Jeff is trying to start his own business in his spare time.&nbsp; Also, we've basically gotten to the point where we no longer treat each other with kid gloves and just say it like it T-I-S.&nbsp; This doesn't always go over well.&nbsp; &nbsp; Romance is still there, but we're not quite as lusty as we once were.&nbsp; Well, looking back, I may have only been the lusty one from the beginning.&nbsp; I've gotten to the point where I'm quite satisfied to kiss him goodnight and disappear into a good book.&nbsp; "How will Harry escape from Snape this time?" &nbsp; A few days after Jeff came back from Central America, we sat upstairs and discussed our relationship and our differences.&nbsp; Neither one of us is sure that we completely understand where the other is coming from, but we have decided that we are both committed to one another to make it work.&nbsp; I just can't imagine being with anyone else.&nbsp; He can't either.&nbsp; Afterwards, we made out on the bed for an hour like a couple of horny teenager after a football game in the back of a Pinto. &nbsp; I made reservations at urlLink Pricci's .&nbsp; My boss gave me a gift card to the urlLink Buckhead&nbsp; Life Restaurant Group for Christmas and I decided to take us out for a nice dinner to celebrate.&nbsp; When he came home, he brought me some roses.&nbsp; In fact, I'm looking at them now and they are orange, pink, yellow and white.&nbsp; They have opened up and are quite beautiful and fragrant.&nbsp; It really allowed me to get in touch with my inner teenage girl, albeit I didn't cry or anything.&nbsp; It just made me feel gooey inside. &nbsp; I actually put on&nbsp; a tie and we went to dinner.&nbsp; It was very nice.&nbsp; We had baked lobster crepes for an appetizer and followed it with a seafood salad for me and a salad that focused on tomatoes for him.&nbsp; For entrees, I had toretelli and he had something meaty that was once part of an animal.&nbsp; I can't remember now because we tossed so many things around.&nbsp; I want to say it was a lamb shank or something.&nbsp; Afterwards we had coffee and tiramisu.&nbsp; I will admit that you could definitely tell it was made from scratch, but I still favored Publix tiramisu over Pricci's dessert.&nbsp; I don't know why.&nbsp; &nbsp; I was pretty stuffed from eating so much.&nbsp; I went to the restroom and they had the hallway lined with photographs of celebrities.&nbsp; There was a pic of Elton John and Rod Stewart with a couple of women.&nbsp; There was a picture of Steve Martin with Anne Heche before Ellen entered the picture.&nbsp; It was interesting. &nbsp; We laughed a lot and came home.&nbsp; I slipped into bed with a good book and he instantly fell asleep.&nbsp; I finished reading the urlLink The Blue Meridian: The Search For The Great White Shark . It is the story of how some filmmakers went about shooting the documentary urlLink Blue Water, White Death , which is the first time anyone captured the great white shark on movie film.&nbsp; Peter Benchley used it as the basis of his research as he was writing Jaws .&nbsp; Jeff bought the book for me at a yard sale because he knows how much I love sharks.&nbsp; In fact, if I had to list any true heroes, I would have to name Ron and Valerie Harper, two Australian naturalists (wildlife, not nudists) who have brought more attention to how amazing sharks are than anyone else on the planet. &nbsp; After I finished the book, it was late and I looked over at Jeff sprawled out on the side of the bed, hair askew and his mouth open.&nbsp; I thought he looked very beautiful.&nbsp; It was like the way that the author described the shark in the book.&nbsp; Yes, they sometimes attack people by mistake, but if you truly look at great white sharks for the perfect creations of nature they are, they seem so beautiful.&nbsp; Yes, sometimes Jeff and I don't agree on some things.&nbsp; However, I cannot ever imagine loving anyone more beautiful than him.

 NATIONAL ICE CREAM DAY &nbsp; It makes your nipples get hard just thinking about it, doesn't it?&nbsp; And I don't just mean that because ice cream is cold.&nbsp; Nothing makes me more excited than a though of going to urlLink Jake's Ice Cream &amp; Sorbets .&nbsp; I'll probably go up there on my way to the grocery store this evening.&nbsp; &nbsp; I wonder what flavors they have today?&nbsp; Some of my favorites include: Chocolate Slap Yo Mama; Chocolate Cinnamon; Devyn's Animal Crackers; Thin Mint (tastes like Girl Scout Cookies); Chocolate Pecan&nbsp;Piescream; Chocolate Leya Cake; Mexican Hot Chocolate;&nbsp;Tiramisu; B's Straweberry Cheesecake and Cotton Candy.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Naturally, I have delayed starting&nbsp; urlLink The Abs Diet until tomorrow.

 A SHOUT OUT TO RACHEL'S SISTER &nbsp; Polly, if you did indeed send me an e-mail, I did not receive it.&nbsp; My spaminator program may have deleted you.&nbsp; If so, leave a comment and let me know what e-mail address to look out for.&nbsp; I just don't want you to think I was being rude.

 LIKE CATWORK &nbsp; The weather is warm now and Buddy, my cat, enjoyes spending days in the backyard.&nbsp; She's a little tortise shell manx sans one rear leg.&nbsp; Every morning she wakes me up with a loud "blah, blah" sound, which means, "Feed me and let me outside!"&nbsp; I dutifully put food in her bowl, check her water and then let her outside.&nbsp; She usually sits by the backdoor looking at me until I get the message.&nbsp; Typically, I will brush her first.&nbsp; Then I let her out and she sits in the doorway as if suddenly changing her mind.&nbsp; Sometimes I can count to three and she will quickly wiggle out.&nbsp; Other times I nudge her with my foot.&nbsp; I'll usually put her food and water out with her.&nbsp; She'll sit on the back deck steps, looking around and sleeping.&nbsp; Sometimes she goes under the house.&nbsp; Other times she'll sleep under the shade of the fig tree.&nbsp; Late at night, she's at the back door, ready to come home and back inside.&nbsp; She's had a hard day at work, just lazing around.&nbsp; It's kind of cute.&nbsp; If only she had a little metal lunchbox to go with her each morning.

 MEET ME AT APPLEBEE'S &nbsp; The day started off with a phone call early this morning.&nbsp; It was a referral from a recent couple that I helped to finance their new home.&nbsp; The man was interested in taking cash out of his home to purchase a hotel/motel.&nbsp; I got the basic information and was able to prequalify him easily for the mortgage.&nbsp; Today was his day off and he wanted to meet to take the application today.&nbsp; I told him I would call him back after lunch to set a time.&nbsp; I hung up and realized that I needed to leave shortly to make my closing at 10:00am. &nbsp; I quickly showered and headed up to Lenox for my closing.&nbsp; The attorney has a new attorney that has started in his office.&nbsp; The new attorney has an unusual name.&nbsp; I've often thought I would like to be a real estate attorney. &nbsp; I rushed home and started pulling the preliminary paperwork together for my appointment that afternoon.&nbsp; I spoke with the boss about doing commercial loans.&nbsp; Evidently, I can.&nbsp; I have the power!&nbsp;&nbsp;I met George for lunch and then returned home to finish prepping the file.&nbsp; One of my other clients called a few minutes before I had planned to call him.&nbsp; I gave him his weekly update, which I do every Friday.&nbsp; He was happy with the information and I drove out to Stone Mountain for my appointment. &nbsp; On the way, I received a phone call from my friend, Steve, in Dallas.&nbsp; He brought me up to speed on what's been going on with him.&nbsp; His boyfriend has gone back to prison and he starts a new job with a mortgage company on Monday.&nbsp; I lost his call once I drove past Stone Mountain, which is a huge mountain of granite outside of Atlanta.&nbsp; It has a relief of three of the greatest heroes of the Civil War and on Summer evenings they do a laser shon on the mountain. &nbsp; I met my client at Applebee's and we took care of the paperwork.&nbsp; Afterwards, we talked for a long time.&nbsp; He told me about his family, their roots in India, growing up in England, his views on the world today and that money isn't everything.&nbsp; I shared some of my own history and perspectives with him and we really connected.&nbsp; It was so cool.&nbsp; He also said some things that were perfectly timed for me to hear.&nbsp; It's kind of spooky when the universe conspires to bring these type of experiences about. &nbsp; I thought of Jaspreet, AKA Beastmomma, and a story I have thought about writing based upon her experiences.&nbsp; The working title is Punjabi Girl .&nbsp; I may write out the treatment this weekend if I have the time. &nbsp; My client asked what I enjoyed best about my work and I replied, "I enjoy problem solving and helping people.&nbsp; I like building relationships with people."&nbsp; I think I did this afternoon.

 LAST NIGHT I HEARD CARUSO SING &nbsp; As I was reading in bed last night, I heard the faint sound of someone singing and playing a guitar.&nbsp; It was an unusually cool night for July and we had the windows open upstairs.&nbsp; I listened closely and determined it was a male voice.&nbsp; "Who could it be at this hour?" I thought to myself as I realized he was playing a guitar as well.&nbsp; It then dawned on me that it was Jay, my next-door-neighbor, singing to his newborn son, Edwin.&nbsp; I turned out the light to help focus my concentration and hear better.&nbsp; I lay in the dark listening to the singing.&nbsp; I couldn't really make out the words or the melody, but it was soothing.&nbsp; I pictured Edwin slowly going to sleep to his father's serenade.&nbsp; I wondered if he would ever remember this moment when he was older.&nbsp; I wondered if Jay would ever remember this moment when Edwin was older.&nbsp; "Isn't it amazing?" I thought to myself, "How one spontaneous decision to pick up a guitar and sing to your child can have emotional reverberations for the rest of his life, and perhaps, through out time.&nbsp; It was a pebble thrown into the water, so to speak.&nbsp; I fell asleep soon after.

 HE'S GOT TACT &nbsp; Yes, one of the rarest finds of all Bananarama memorabilia is on urlLink eBay and I'm thinking about buying it.&nbsp; In 1983, Bananarama recorded He's Got Tact as a promotion for Honda Scooters in Japan and appeared in a commercial with Peter Fonda.&nbsp; It's never appeared on any album or CD.&nbsp; It's the only one of their 39-singles that I do not own.&nbsp; You're probably thinking, "39 singles?! I thought they only released Cruel Summer , Venus and I Heard A Rumour ."&nbsp; It's not the greatest song they ever recorded.&nbsp;It reminds you of girl group songs from the 60's, albeit the lyrics about getting into a fight with a girl in a bar make me smile.&nbsp; It's simple, early, shambolic Bananarama.&nbsp;&nbsp; Things seemed so much more innocent and pure back then... or were they?

 I'LL HAVE THE GEORGE SALAD &nbsp; I met my favorite realtor partner at Heaping Bowl this afternoon for lunch.&nbsp; I love George.&nbsp; He gave me my first real break when I first started in the business and has continued to send clients my way.&nbsp; In fact, he's even given me some of his own personal business.&nbsp; I love working with George because he's just a lot of fun.&nbsp; George always calls me "honey" or "sunshine" and he doesn't take it all too seriously.&nbsp; You just can't and stay sane.&nbsp; Plus, he just has a hillarious outlook on life and isn't afraid to say "fuck" when it needs to be said.&nbsp; Most of all, I like the way that George treats his clients.&nbsp; He treats them the way I like to be treated so I like alligning myself with other professionals like that. &nbsp; We talked a little business today, but we're also starting to share more about our personal lives. I like that because I think George is a great friend too.&nbsp; He basically came out in the 70's so it's interesting to get his perspective on things and how they have changed. &nbsp; I was surprised to learn this afternoon that George frequents Heaping Bowl almost daily.&nbsp; In fact, they've named a salad after him.&nbsp; It's called the George Salad and if you order it, they'll know what you mean. &nbsp; "I didn't know I was having lunch with a celebrity, George." I said. &nbsp; "Stick with me kid," he winked.&nbsp; "I'll teach you all the tricks." &nbsp; How can you not like someone like that?

 MUSIC DOWNLOAD SERVICES Does anyone have any suggestions for websites to download songs from? I'm looking for legal sites where you pay per song, but I want to be able to burn the song onto a CD to take with in the car. Any suggestions and feedback would be greatly appreciated.

 ANOTHER REOCCURING DREAM I keep having a dream that I'm helping one of the Olsen twins qualify for a mortgage. I think it is Mary-Kate. Is she the "fat" one? She seems very anxious and it begins to wear off on me. I read that she had sex with Henry Winkler's son in Italy. I don't think I should know that.

 SUMMER NIGHTS IN ATLANTA I love summer nights. I like the feeling of the air conditioner on my skin while driving around at dusk. The light is dying in the sky just as the neon is yawning to life. I hummed Petula Clark's Downtown to myself. I like the tourists buzzing about CNN Center as images of Anderson Cooper flash on the big screen on the bulding only to be replaced by the Super Friends on the Cartoon Network. For some reason, I find Anderson Cooper sort of sexy in a repressed way. I know he doesn't talk about his personal life, but doesn't that just scream, "GAY!"? Maybe I would be the same way if my mother was Gloria Vanderbilt. I bet he'd be fun to have beer with and play bar trivia together. I can't say I've ever had sexual fantasies about him spinning me 360 degrees like a record baby, right round, round, round. As I drove by the TBS building tonight, they had a huge billboard of Outback Jack on the side of the building. I found it unusual that I completely ignored the shirtless guy to notice the font used in the ad. There is something about Avant Garde that is just so sexy. Mmm... delicious. I sort of wanted to keep driving tonight, way out into the country where it's dark and you can see the stars. I was playing Sophie Ellis-Bextor's new album and Lipslide by Sarah Cracknell from Saint Etienne. I could have almost driven to Athens. Once, in the summer of '92, I woke up late at night and crept out of the house. Susan and Joan were spending the night with Chris and I. I drove north of Arlington on the back roads where the strip clubs like Baby Dolls are. I kept playing a Culture Club greatest hits cassette that I had purchased at Half Price Books. It was a private moment. It made me feel closer to something, but even now, I can't tell you what it is. However, I can still feel it now.

 VOICEOVER, CLASS TWO I was five minutes late tonight due to a tornado warning, some light rain and people who don't know how to drive. I hate being late. It's so disrespectful. I know some people have made it into an art, but that's another blog for another day. I didn't practive much this week and I've been trying to figure out why. I think I was intimidated by the blending exercises. They're hard, but I practiced for a couple of hours today and I did better than I expected. It's going to take some time master though. On some levels, I feel like I'm learning to talk all over again. Our instructor was the narrator for Wings on the Discovery Channel for many years. He told us that the religious right is always after him to do their voiceover work because they like his voice. Problem is, he doesn't like them. Finally, his agent convinced him to do it because it was putting him in an awkward position with the ad agency. Now he does their voiceover works and takes the money he receives and gives it to the organizations that the religious right opposes. You gotta love that guy. Many of the people in my class are... ACTORS. They are very serious about it. We had to go around the room and say who we are and why we're taking the class. Everyone had a professional reason for doing it and I was the lone, "Well, people tell me I have a nice voice and I thought it might be fun." Our homework was to read a monologue about Jenny. We had to decide who we were and the context of the monologue. Was Jenny dead? You get the picture. One lady volunteered and read her homework. She was extremely over the top. It was like being trapped in one of those read along books that comes with the narration on a record. Tinker Bell kept ringing her bell to the turn the page and it never stopped. I thought it was too much and my instructor loved it. The rest of the class thought she was great too. Naturally, I assumed that the problem must have been with me, but I kind of have a rule I follow with things like this - if that lady read that story to me that way in an elevator, would I be afraid for my life? I'm sorry. I would have shot her or at least demolished both knee caps with a fire extinguisher. The rest of the class we spent reading passages of poetry, exploring phrasing and finding the cadence. Evidently there are some new rules about blending that came up tonight that we all seemed to have missed last week. In spite of the fact that it may sound like I didn't enjoy the class, I'm enjoying it. It's challenging. It inspires me to rise to the challenge. There is an actor who is originally from Spain. She read one passage and the instructor told her she sounded like Rosan Rosanadana from Saturday Night Live (SNL). She looked at him blankly as everyone laughed and said, "Pop culture means nothing to me." The instructor just sort of looked down and said, "I shouldn't have said that." We have to come up with 15-20 radio commercials for next week. I haven't found any on the Internet yet. We're going to sort through them to find a few to use for demo reel. We're supposed to choose things that we adore. I guess that would be sex, Bananarama and Jake's ice cream. I think the kid who sat next to me has a crush on me. He kept watching me and hanging around me. After class I walked outside and stopped to watch a beautiful firey sunset on the way to my car. He came up to me and asked about our homework. It was one of those conversations you have just to keep talking not because you really care about what you're saying. I know it because I used to initiate those conversations. He's really cute and my heart just goes out to him because he kind of reminds me of me. I could totally write a little humorous love story with him in it. Maybe I will. He seems like a really nice kid. Maybe we'll end up being friends and I'll be a surrogate big brother. I'll introduce him to someone who will put him boy training and fulfill his repressed desires to explore the leather lifestyle. Who knows? I'm taking it one onomatopoeia at a time.

 I KNOW THERE IS A SPECIAL HELL FOR COLLECTION AGENCY EMPLOYEES I have a friend who cannot manage her money by herself. Her ex-husband beat her for many years and she has some cognitive difficulties. I finally realized that no one was going to help her out and stepped into help. I have power of attorney over her bank account and have begun paying her bills for her out of her checking account. However, there were a few bad checks that were written before I stepped in and now the last one has showed up from a local collection agency. In my conversation with Jay last week, I explained that my friend is only paid once a month and we have already used all of the funds to get her current on her utilities and other past due bills. I didn't know about this check, therefore, I did not budget for it. I explained that my friend is paid again on the 31st and we would send a money order for the full amount. That was fine. Yesterday I received a call from Pamela. She could not have picked a worse time to call. I told her that I had already worked out arrangements with Jay, however, those arrangements were now unacceptable. I explained the situation again to Pamela whosse only comment was a cheery, "It doesn't work that way." Being somewhat mentally deficient, Pamela asked me once again how I planned to take care of my friend's debt. With great restraint, I gently explained to Pamela that for the last time, there is no more money in my friend's bank account. It echoes and there will not be money again until the 31st. Suddenly filled with the Spirit of Jesus Christ, Pamela began speaking in tongues in attempt to overpower me and we were somehow disconnected. There were two messages on the answering machine when I returned home last night. It was a telephone number saying that it was important to call. There was no information about what it was regarding. I call. It's the same collection agency. This time I speak with Jenny. We go round and round again. Finally, Jenny wants to know why I don't loan my friend the money and I said that it wasn't my responsibility. After all, I'm already helping her. Jenny, then began to attack me for not giving my friend the money and all she has to do is walk the file ten feet over and have it sent to the magistrate court. "Oh look, I just found the $107.00!" I said with great excitement. Jenny then began to tell me how I could immediately pay her over the phone. "Jenny, I'm being ironic. Have you not heard anything I've told you in this conversation. There is no money to pay you right now." Jenny told me again that I should loan my friend the money and I had to cut her off. "Jenny, this is not about me. I'm going to confirm with the amount that is owed and where it needs to be sent to when my friend is paid again. I just want to confirm this since everything else I have been told has changed." Jenny tried to divert it back to me and I had to remind her this was not my debt and she was taking me away from my work time. I confirmed the information and hung up. I called my friend to give her the update. Maybe she can borrow the money from someone, but it's doubtful since she burned most the bridges long ago. I think they were just trying to intimidate me. Still, it's basically my friend's predicament and if she can borrow the money to pay them off, good for her. However, I'd still like to make those people wait until the 1st. The only thing that kept me civil on the phone today was thinking about Kathleen Turner prank calling people in Serial Mom and saying, "Cocksucker!" into the phone.

 INFOMINUTE FAUS PAUX I stayed up until about one o'clock working on my short story, Exfoliation . Jeff had already gone to bed and I realized that he didn't set the alarm so I could get up at 5:30am. My Timex IronMan is MIA again so I set my large, old fashioned alarm clock with the hammer between the bells and went upstairs. I woke up every half hour thinking I had over slept and then worrying about the alarm waking Jeff up too. At 4:15am I decided to bring the alarm back down stairs and sleep in my my/spare bedroom. I made it to my PowerCore meeting and decided that this week's InfoMinute would answer the written questions I received from my seven-minute presentation from last week. I had already written out what I would say and gone over it a few times so I was fairly relaxed. My turn came and I stood up and began and then after I answered the first question, my mind went completely blank. I stood there for about five seconds and then said, "Excuse me, I'm downloading." Everyone laughed and I said I would continue next week. As soon as my firm buttocks touched my seat, I remembered the second question I had planned to answer. It worries me that there may be a connection between my ass and my short term memory. I had breakfast with our team chiropractor after the meeting. He's an interesting guy. He's interested in doing motivational seminars and I referred him to the contact at my church. He's also writing a self-help book too. It was just like my meeting with Mike, our motivational speaker, a few weeks ago. Speaking of Mike, he's been out in L.A. the past few weeks shooting C.S.I. New York . I think he has a fairly big part and it's reoccuring. This is big break for him. It's reassuring to see good things happen to good people.

 THIS LAND IS YOUR LAND, THIS LAND IS MY LAND My friend, Blaise, sent me urlLink this . I find it to be a very skewing of both political parties. However, I like the ending best. The comment on what we did to Native Americans is funny only because it is atrocious what our fore fathers did to the indigenous people of North America.

 LOVE COMES IN SMALL PACKAGES I met someone tonight at a neighborhood function who revealed to me that he has a fetish for midgets. "I believe they prefer to be called little people." "Little people ain't sexy. Midget! That's sexy." "I can't say I've ever thought about it." "Are you saying midgets ain't sexy people?" I found myself becoming angry that this jerk was putting me on the spot to eroticize little people for fear of coming across as some sort of bigot. "No, I'm not. What I'm saying is that it never occured to me single out a physical characteristic that medical science considers a deformity, well, a physical anomaly and single that out as source of sexual excitement where as other wise ignoring the rest of the person." He took a swig of beer and licked his lips. "Have you ever looked at some guy and thought he had a nice ass?" "Yeah." "What's the difference?" "Look, I understand what you're getting at, but it's not the same. A nice ass is not singled out in our society." "Hell, it ain't!" "Not as a disability." "You ever been fucked by a midget?" "No." "It's hot as hell." "May I ask a question?" He smiled, excited that I might ask for more intimate detail about his sexcapades with men of shorter stature. "Sure." "Technically, midgets are properly proportioned, but just smaller. However, dwarves are diminutive, but not in proportion with the exception of their genitals. Therefore, I would imagine that you probably mean you are turned on by dwarves." His face contorted like a constipated Cabbage Patch Kid. "That's sick man! That's just sick!" I thought he was going to punch me for a second and then he stomped off. "Finally," I thought to myself and exhaled with relief. Now I can't stop thinking about what it would be like to have sex with a midget or a dwarf.

 WHAT DO YOU WISH GUYS WOULD DO MORE OF IN BED? A friend of mine was recently shocked to learn that I do not own any porn.... specifically gay porn. In turn, I was shocked by his schock. "What's the big deal?" I asked. "Are you crazy?" He asked, pulling hair on both sides of his head for dramatic effect. "Why it's only your goddamn right as a Gay American!" "Really." I set my TBB (Tequila Based Beverage) down on the table and turned to give him my full undivided attention. "I'm intrigued. Tell me more." "You need something to focus on." "This sounds too much like natural childbirth training and I'm not having a baby." "You need pictures of hot, hung young men to jump start your libido." "I've already got quite and imagination and I don't necessarily won't to try everything that I imagine. I mean a hamster is one thing in fantasty, but quite another in execution." Finally, he leaned over the table. "A gay man without gay porn is like Batman without a utility belt." I haven't been able to get that conversation out of my head. My friends words have rung in my head like the bells that toll for me. Maybe I do need porn. Perhaps it's a right of passage long overdue like my first jock straps or knee pads or cleats. I decided to look up some gay porn magazines online to see what's available. My friend is very fond of Fresh Men, which does sound good as opposed to Not So Fresh Men. I visited their website and they have an interesting poll going on: What do you wish guys would do more of in bed?. Take the poll by clicking urlLink here . I learned that 41.6% of men polled want to cuddle and kiss followed by another 25.4% that want men to rim and play with their ass. 13.0% have been boinking Speedy Gonzalez while 9.2% just want some more nipple play, please. Tied with 5.4% are talking dirty and other. I've always liked the sound of other. I wonder what it is. It reminds of something Lily Tomlin once said: "I always wanted to be somebody, but I guess I should have been more specific."

 YOU'D BETTER WORK! Kellie came over to help print out sponsorship forms and letters for the Mothball. September 25th will be here in no time. Katy and her daughter, Emma, both had colds so Katy stayed home. Watching her makes me have respect for mothers with small children. Children are to be cherished, but they take a lot of time, care and attention. Kellie brought over a pizza from Wholefoods and it was delicious. I never would have thought about putting squash on a pizza. She also made a basalmic vinegar dressing from scratch. Is there nothing that girl can't do? We listened to the Moulin Rouge soundtrack since that is the them of the Mothball this year. Afterwards, we put on Ultimate Dance Party 1997. I mentioned that I had been enjoying VH1 Classic recently and she said, "You know that I was on VH1 once." "Really?" "I was on House of Style." "What were you doing on there?" "I used to model." "Oh." "You don't know, do you?" "Know what?" "I used to be a professional model and lived in Milan and Germany. I worked for Prada." "You said the 'P' word." "Yes, I did. Prada provided a chef to us and he prepared our lunch every day. It was usually champagne and chocolate." "So what happened?" "I got mono and came home to get better. I realized that if I wanted to be with Steve and spend time with my family, I couldn't pursue modeling so I decided to go back to school." "You gave modeling to be with Steve?" "Yes." We stuffed envelopes in silence for a few moments. "You must REALLY love Steve." "Yes," she smiled. "I do."

 STEPWORD WIVES WASN'T SO BAD Saturday afternoon I went to catch a matinee of The Stepford Wives. I wasn't expecting much because it received such horrible reviews, but I wanted to see it anyway because it was one of those movies my mom watched again and again as I was growing up. Plus, I like Nicole Kidman and Bette Midler. First, I cannot believe how expensive movies have become. It's $8.50 for a movie now. I went to see a matinee and it was $6.50. When I was a kid we used to walk ten miles through the snow to the theater and only pay $1.75. Okay. Now that is out of my system. The spoof of reality TV shows was great especially the one with the man and the woman competing to answer the questions and the woman hits the buzzer first on the question, "Who is more likely to be turned on by a sexy lesbian?" The characters are not entirely three-dimensional, but Nicole Kidman and Matthew Broderick do a nice job. Bette Midler and the guy who plays the gay guy are both great. I cannot believe that Faith Hill faked an orgasm on screen. The ending added a new twist to the original, but I'm not sure what the robot on the table was all about. It did get a little preachy at the end, but overall, it was just good fun. Definitely worth a matinee or a video rental.

 ABSENCE MAKES THE HEART GROW FONDER On my way back from the gym this evening, I thought about my best friend, Kent, and I found myself overcome with this feeling that I just wanted to spend some time and talk with him very badly. Trouble is, Kent is dead. I wasn't overcome with grief, but just a sad longing to drive around singing old Bananarama songs and listen to him do bawdy Katherine Hepburn impression from On Golden Pond . "Henry, sometimes I just want to grab your penis and yank it around and around and around." Or Carol Channing singing Let's Hear It For The Boy . We could have fun doing anything and we didn't have to have money. Kent was also the best person to watch comedy with because he had this epileptic giggle loop that just kept going once he got started. I've had an idea to adapt a true story for a script and this afternoon I finally felt that the time is right to approach this person about his story. We'll see what happens. Absence makes the heart grow fonder. It's a phrase that is supposed to be sentimental, but it sounds like a fungus problem if you think about it.

 THE FIRST LINE I came across a scratch of paper that had the following written on it: "'I want to die in Mexico City,' she said." Underneath that I had written the words "snow globe." I wonder what it all means. I do like the first sentence. Wouldn't it make a great first line of a story or novel. Perhaps we should all do it and y'all can send me your stories. The winner will receive some gourmet hot sauce.

 CONFLICT RESOLUTION "Sometimes I feel like you ignore me." "I'm sorry. I didn't mean to." "It makes me feel like you don't care... like I'm not important to you." "I didn't realize I was doing that. The next time you feel that I'm ignoring you, please let me know." "Oh! So the burden of the responsibility is back on me." "No. I'm just saying that if you feel like I ignore you and I don't realize it, how else am I going to become aware of this behavior?" "If you were really into me, you would know."

 HOLLIS GILLESPIE IS STALKING ME IN MY DREAMS There's no place to run and no place to hide. Eventually I will have to go to sleep. The words I type seem like a familiar cliche from a 50's science fiction movie, but the reality of the situation is that there is a real fear to feed the fires of my paranoia. Last night, urlLink Hollis Gillespie appeared again. We were in a urlLink Waffle House somewhere south of Atlanta on Interstate 85. Hollis was dressed in a smart ginham pant suit that would have looked at home on a Mary Tyler Moore Show supporting actress; think Valerie Harper or Cloris Leachman. For some reason I'm feel nervous and the food has not arrived so I can't place the blame there. It's almost like trying to tell someone you have romantic feelings for them, but I don't know this woman and I'm gay. Eventually, I just spit it out that I know that she's written a book called urlLink Bleachy-Haired Honky Bitch: Tales From A Bad Neighborhood and my friend and former neighbor, Katy, knows her. I also suspect that it was she who came by our neighborhood yard sale and Jeff gave her daughter a Christmas ornament. It was hard to tell because her tongue wasn't hanging out of her mouth. However, I don't let my doubt get in the way. It just feels good to part my biscupids and let it all out. She appears relieved as well. Her lower lip is trembling in an anxious way and her eyes are poised on every word I say. In a good way like someone is finally telling you something that you've always wanted to hear, but still can't believe is true... like you've just won a MTV contest to have Belinda Carlisle headline a barbecue in your backyard with 500 of your most intimate friends. We lean close to one another and talk maniacally, laughing nervously every minute or so. We're bonding. She is frequent commentator on NPR and I'm a frequent.... Well, I don't know that I'm a frequent anything. It sounds so authoritative, like an expert witness. Frequent UFO flyer certainly carries more prestige than certified nut and resident of lower Alabama. I'm just an ordinary man who is meeting a columnist for urlLink Creative Loafing in my dreams and I don't know why. At this point, Jeff's sleep apnea usually kicks in and startles me awake, but once I remember the cows from the Chick-Fil-A advertisements rushing into the Waffle House. These aren't fun, party-kind of cows looking for some cheap, greasy food after a night out drinking in Buckhead. These are terrorist cows who hurl a rubber chicken onto our table with a ticking bomb inside of it. Hollis throws herself onto the rubber chicken as I cry out, "No, Hollis! No! There isn't a squeegee big enough to get all of the gingham off the walls!" Then I wake up. I'm not sure about that last part. They may have been the sour cream chicken enchiladas talking. I should really read Hollis' book. I think I would enjoy it. She lives in or around my neighborhood and she wrote a column once about taking her daughter to daycare at St. Paul's Methodist Church and encountering a naked homeless person with their pastor, Susannah. It was humorous, but moving. After reading it, I felt that Hollis, as the writer, and I, as the reader, were both naked too. I like it when unconventional people who don't fit the mold of what society and the media consider acceptable and marketable make it. It gives me faith in humanity. It gives faith that people are not being completely dumbed-down by radio playlists and marketing analysts. Yes, I should really read that book, but after an e-mail from one of my readers about the magic spot (See "Do You Know Where Your Magic Spot Is?" from Saturday, July 10, 2004,) I had to pull out my copy of "The Multiple Orgasmic Male" and read it again. It's amazing to rediscover that my body is practically a X-Box of hours of pleasure that can be played with one to two players. After that, I need to finish a book on the great white shark and the "Life of Phi' that Jeff gave me as well as a novel by another local author. I'll get to it eventually, but for now, wherever Hollis is, I hope she is safe and loved and not wearing gingham. Also, keep an eye out for rubber chickens.

 WHEN A FORMER BASEBALL LEGEND CALLS Hank Aaron keeps calling my house. This afternoon was the third time and I hung up on him again. Hank lives in the area and owns a BMW dealership. He's supporting a local political candidate. I don't know who because I hung up on him. I don't like these prerecorded messages of endorsement. They're a great marketing idea, but I've reached the point where I hate to hear my phone ring. It's an interruption from whatever I'm doing to run to the den and pick up the phone to stop the obnoxious ring. Yes, I know there is an answering machine, but that just means postponing talking to whomever has called. Who needs to add another item to their "to do" list? At least with e-mail spam I can filter it out or delete it. At the times I have sat down to read e-mail, that is my purpose to be there. I do not sit down by the phone, ready to take a phone call. Nor do horny teenage sluts call me up to offer their well-lubed orifices for my pleasure. They simply appear in my in box, legs in the air and covered with a seminal facial. I just click "delete as spam" and they are gone from my life. No mess, no worry.

 DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOUR MAGIC SPOT IS? A friend of mine complained the other day that he and his boyfriend had tried about everything sexually. He asked if I knew of anything different he and his boyfriend could try. I suggested that he press his boyfriend's magic spot right before his boyfriend orgasms. "The what?" I explained that the magic spot is located almost center between the anus and scrotum along the perenium. It's a small indention that you can feel. If you press a finger firmly about inch in, it hits a trigger point that diverts the ejaculation from the uretha directly into the bladder. In other words, his boyfriend would have the muscle contractions of a typical orgasm, but no semen will spew forth. He asked me how I knew this and I told him I read a lot. He thought I was joking, but I was serious. "It's nice alternative," I said. "You know when you're out on the town and you don't feel like swallowing and there are no Taco Bell napkins in the glove compartment." My friend looked at me as if I was some sort of pervert and I had to remind him that I wasn't the one into water sports. In closing, let me qualify my comment by saying that my friend does not know how to water ski.

 HAIRY DETAILS My bangs were hanging down in my eyes. It's hot and humid. I'm too active to have hair this long. Randy gave me a hybrid cut. It's not quite a crewcut, but I would look at home on the set of Black Hawk Down .

 THAT WAS GREAT, BUT THIS TIME, CAN YOU BE A LITTLE MORE MINTY? Voiceover class was interesting. One of the instructors reminds me of the psychiatrist from Augusten Burroughs' novel, "Running With Scissors." He looks like everyone's favorite Santa Claus look-a-like who is most likely to molest an altar boy that you know. He's from Alabama and speaks magnificently. The other instructor is a former voice talent agent and she played his 60-second demo. It was amazing. This man has done so many commercials that I have heard on local radio and national TV. He's the voice of Quick Trip, Ford, Valveline and Jag-u-ar. The voice talent agent used the term "money shot" and had to explain it to a young girl. I think I enjoyed that moment too much. I sometimes think my middle name is diabolical. Everyone in my class is a serious actor. Naturally, I feel somewhat out of place. I'm just taking it for fun really and feel much like a PTA mother who wandered into an A.A. meeting by accident and just feels too embarrassed to leave. It's like I'm a fauxaholic. We learned about blending on Wednesday. If you have a word that ends with a hard consonant followed by a word that starts with a vowel, you blend them together. For instance, the phrase "act of" becomes "ak tov." It sounds easy enough, but try reading outloud when you have never seen the script before. The black guy sitting beside me did a fantastic job. He read with meaning. I meant to do that, but I didn't want to miss a blending opportunity. I'm supposed to practice for an hour each day, but I've already missed Thursday and Friday. I'll have to make up for it the rest of the week. I didn't expect it to be so much work, but I think it will be good for me. I need to learn to talk correctly. If all else fails, I'll just go in and pretend that I'm Dawn French or Jennifer Saunders. "Are you going to use the accent? "I am using the accent. Howr uhr yew?" This may not be pretty.

 THE BAR, THE BEER AND THE BOY I met a guy at the neighborhood business association and we met for drinks tonight at a local bar. After I had accepted the invitation, I began to wonder if perhaps he might be gay. You may think it's a funny question to ask, but I've been rusty the last few years. As worldy as my life has been, sometimes I can be so naive. For instance, I recall the lesbian couple that Jeff and I met at the Biltmore Vineyard. Jeff wasn't so sure they were lesbians. I told him he was a novice challenging a professional. I called his attention to how close they were standing next to one another and one girl's short hair. How was I to know she recently finished chemotherapy? It's not like she had to wear a sign. Anyway, I've always been leary of assuming anything. It's not just my fear of being wrong, but my adversion to gay people who think that the entire world is gay and just itching to come out and service their large, turgid members and manhandle their gargantuan breast-globes. So I met this guy, who I'll call Trevor because I just feel like it, about 5:30pm at a nice local bar. He had a pitcher of beer waiting. Now, I haven't been a big drinker for several years. It's like one day I just woke and forgot all about alcohol. It's like it was an old sweater. "Hey, here's that old cardigan grandma gave me. I think I'll have a sip." Also, I've never been a big beer fan, but I think I drank almost a whole pitcher myself. Soon, I no longer felt my scalp. When my eyebrows went numb, I slowed down. Trevor and I talked for about three hours. We talked about... well, everything. He introduced me to several people in the bar. I met the bartender and his fiance. Their parents are meeting for the first time tomorrow evening. A salt of the earth country couple will be meeting an affluent Asian-American family from Roswell tomorrow night. Let the wine flow. The rehearsal dinner was going to be at Six Feet Under, but evidently Chinese people cannot have any sort of wedding celebration within sight of a cemetery. It's a bad omen. No more than the bride walking in on the groom boinking the maid of honor, but who am I to judge? I wish them the best. Some of the other people referred to Trevor in a plural so I believe he must have a roommate at the very least. Ironically, I found myself not talking about Jeff either. It wasn't because my intentions were dishonorable. I'm afraid I've just gotten very used to Jeff being very uncomfortable telling anyone about our relationship and not it just seems normal to me. Moreover, it sort of comes across weird when you announce to someone that you're gay and that you have a boyfriend, whom you're in a monogamous relationship with. It either comes across as if you're telling someone that you think they're homophobic or they want to have sex with you. I would have liked to have seen my facial expressions tonight because when I start thinking like this I reach a certain point where I just think to myself, "Jesus, just let it go before you drive yourself INSANE!" About 9:00pm I excused myself and went to Publix. I bought some sushi and tiramisu and came back home to watch "Thoroughly Modern Millie" with Julie Andrews, Mary Tyler Moore and Carol Channing. It was released in 1967, the year I was born, and I like to believe that I would love this movie even if I wasn't gay. They made it into a Broadway musical several years ago. I love Mrs. Meers, the Chinese hotel mother, who is secretly kidnapping all the orphan women and selling them into white slavery. "Shu sho! Shu sho!" I also like the elevator that you have to tap dance in to get it to work. It's just a silly movie. I've waited to watch it hoping that there might be a time that Jeff and I could watch it together so I could share it with him, but that has been a pipe dream so far. I finally decided that I wanted to watch it tonight. I remember watching it once when I was a kid. It came on again a year later and I talked my sister into watching it. She laughed and laughed and I remember watching her during the movie and thinking that it was neat that she was sharing this with me. We didn't really get along much when I was younger.

 HEY, I'VE BEEN BUSY Tomorrow I must wake up early and clean the house. Jeff is coming home tomorrow night from Central America. The house is not in disorder, I just need to freshen it up a bit so it looks like I made the effort to spruce it up for his homecoming. Well, I'm not going to just make it look like that; I am doing that. It's been a busy week with voiceover class, Mothball meetings, taking loan applications in the evening, working on Jim's website. (Have you noticed that I have begun spelling website as one word with a lower case "W". That's the way Macromedia spells it. However, I once lost points on a paper because my instructor said that Web site is referring to the World Wide Web and should be capitalized. It's hard to let that go, but I need to move beyond it and forgive the bitch. I'm such a loving person.) It's always interesting how all of Jefffifer's mutual friends call when Jeff leaves for this trip once a year. "How long will Jeff be gone?" "A week." "Are you okay?" "Yeah. Why do you ask? Did his plane go down?" "No, but.... you know." I would find it hard to believe that anyone who knows me would think that I would be a tramp while Jeff is away. Maybe they just think that I'm helpless without him. I wish I could say that I had eaten pizza and rented videos, but I have not. I've cleaned my bedroom and gone through my books. I've organized my desk and files. I haven't even looked at gay porn on the Internet. Do I get points counted off for that? Jeff is going to ask me if I missed him and to tell you the truth, I have been so preoccupied with so many things that need to be done that the week has flown by. I'm conscious that he's gone and I think about things I want to tell him when he gets back, but I'm not like a devoted lab staring morbidly at the door until he returns. A few years ago that might have bothered me, but I've grown up a lot. Although I never expected a relationship to be easy, I've been surprised how much the intimacy of companionship soon overtakes lust. Maybe lesbian death bed is not such a bad thing. Maybe we've just been fooled into thinking that romance, sex and passion is everything like we once believed that low-carb diets are our only salvation. In some parts of the world, arranged marriages are still the norm and love is never really considered. Tomorrow night he'll arrive at the airport and I will pick him up. He'll be dirty and tell me he missed and about all the experiences he had down there. After we arrive home, he'll shower and then he will quickly pass out from exhaustion. I'll brush his hair back off his face and watch him sleep for a few moments. I'll read for a while and then I'll turn out the light. I'll hear his sleep apnea sputtering like machine gun fire in the darkness beside me and smile. I'm glad to have him home.

 I'M BEING TRADED My friend, Mark, sent me this urlLink link today. Cult of Jef is listed on the Top 100 Incoming Links at #8 and #13. I have no idea what it means.

 JEF'S GOT A BIG ONE! Four or five times a year I give a seven minute presentation at my PowerCore meeting about some aspect of my business. For the past month I have been discussing the interest only LIBOR Adjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM) and I decided to end my series with my seven minute presentation. Being that talking about one's business is rather dry, I decided to liven it up a little with a good analogy. I decided that since an ARM does involve some risk since it's not a fixed for the life of the loan, it's sort of like a wild animal. For the most part it's predictable, but if you choose an ARM for the wrong reasons, it can come back to bite you. My goal was to explain which customers and circumstances are best for this product. I decided that it reminded me of Mutual Omaha's Wild Kingdom except no one is wearing khakis, shooting tranquilizer darts or measuring the loan amount and saying, "Looks like Jef's got a big one!" The analogy went over well, but the seven minutes seemed rather dry. I had a few jokes here or there, but it's not the subject matter that consistently results in laughter or tears. I had decided it was a good first experience to learn from and vowed to do better next time. However, after the meeting several people came up to me and asked questions about the product or told me they had that product and loved it. I also received three leads today. I guess I did better than I thought.

 I HEART JOHN EDWARDS Truth be told, I always preferred Howard Dean and John Edwards to John Kerry. I'm still not gung ho on Kerry, but Edwards sounds promising. Of course, I have a lot of research to do before I make my final decision. I've noticed over the past decade or so that as Americans, we are generally a lazy lot when it comes to politics. We tend to ask the opinions of our friends and co-workers and accept these views and choices as our own. We hear something about Bush on TV or the radio and accept it as Gospel truth instead of putting out the effort to find out the facts. Now, I'm not a Bush supporter, but I don't belive in bashing the man just because I'm gay and he's supporting a Constitutional Amendment to ban gay marriage. Likewise, I tire at hearing comments made about Kerry that are completely subjective. I still maintain my belief that we would be better off without political parties. With each passing year it resembles the alliances between two people on Survivor so they can vote someone else off the island. Unless you have been under a rock, you know that Michael Moore released his documentary, Fairenheit 911 . Never before has anyone used a documentary to sway public opinion about an imcumbant president prior to an election. It's an interesting concept. Several people have told me it's a powerful film and I must see it. However, when I have asked them what was powerful about it, no one seems to give me any details. On the flip side, I read editorials about the movie by Republicans who basically said that Moore is the anti-Christ and a liar. They told me that to believe the lies in that so called documentary would prove that I'm unpatriotic. As I skimmed through the text I discovered no specific details included in the film that were rebutted with facts. They didn't have to see the movie; they knew it was all propaganda. We are coming up on the biggest election our country has ever seen and we have two political parties that are pointing fingers at each other and saying the other one started it. Never before has it been more important for each of us to read all the information available about all the candidates who are running for the office of the President. We need to be careful to dismiss any information we are given that is unsupported by fact, but is based on opinion. We have to learn to think for ourselves. It's not easy. It's work, but if we give in to taking the easy way out by voting for whom our friends are voting for, we are basically dishonoring everyone who has died in the last 200+ years of country to give us the right to vote. There is no reason that any of us should not vote. Don't tell me you're neutral. If you are, go to Switzerland. If we choose to become lazy we allow our democracy to fall apart. Now, I have to admit that out of the President/Vice President combos that are running, I would most like to perform oral sex on John Edwards, but I am going to stretch myself beyond such fantasies to research and analyze whether Kerry and Edwards should be in the White House just because Edwards has a humongous member. How do I know this? I read it in chat room, therefore, it has to be true.

 HIS NAKED TRUTH ABOUT FLIP FLOPS I've never been a big fan of the little plastic sandals commonly referred to as flip flops. However, I did finally break down and buy a pear this summer as I returned to the pool. They are red and blue and manufactured by Speedo. After banging my toe on the side of my bed the other day, they also came in useful when it was difficult to wear other shoes. I mentioned this to someone I know as I looked down at the still black and blue toe on my right foot. "I think there sexy as hell." "Really?" I asked, turning around to look at him, tilting my head to the side to imply interest. "Hell, yeah. My favorite thing to do is to walk around the house naked, wearing nothing but my flip flops." "Is it for religious purposes?" "No. I just like the feel of it." "The feel of it?" "Yeah. I like to look at myself in the mirror. I like the way I look wearing nothing but flip flops." "I would imagine it is very revealing." "I like the way my dick hangs between my legs, pointing straight down at my flip flops." "It doesn't sound very stimulating." "It's mathematical." "I beg your pardon." "You know that implied triangle that you see in all of DaVinci's artwork. That's what I see between my dick and my flip flops... an implied triangle. It makes me feel powerful... sexy." "I'm afraid I have no response to that." "Of course the best feeling is when you walk out of the shower and your balls are hanging down to your knees." "I really didn't need to know that." "It makes me wish that I had a beard that reached down to my feet. I bet it would feel good tickling my- At this point I put my hands over my ears and began singing, "La, la, la, la, la, la, la...."

 PROJECT RED, WHITE AND BLUE The Internet has really been harnessed for so many useful things. For example, there is an online petition to have Warner Brothers include Lynda Carter, the former TV Wonder Woman, in the Wonder Woman movie. It's called Project Red, White And Blue. They really should at least give her a cameo. The woman has devoted a good portion of her life promoting the character and has done a very nice job of it. Warner Brothers should really honor her in this small way. If you would like to sign the petition, click urlLink here .

 BLOGGER BLAHS Boy, Blogger seems to be acting up lately. There have been several times when I have tried to view other Blogger-based blogs and they were unavailable, even after refreshing the page several times. I changed the comments back to Halo Scan and I'm trying out Blogrolling. Everything is not pretty yet, but I don't have a lot of time to devote to it right now.

 BLOGGER FACELIFT I decided to give the old blog a new look. Naturally, it has done away with all of my old comments and links. I'll try to get them back up soon.

 V.O. STANDS FOR VOICEOVER Image Film & Video is holding an eight-week class called Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Voiceover.... Interested in fine-tuning your speaking skills for commercial or voiceover work? Imagine developing and strengthening your own vocal power with two instructors covering both the business and the talent aspect of voiceover work. Co-taught by Sally Neal (former voiceover department head for People Store) and Stuart Culpepper (veteran of stage, film, television and radio), this class will combine acting, critical analysis, and business savvy in order to turn your interests into a possible vocal career. With Stuart, you'll record, listen to, and receive constructive feedback from the class and the instructor on in-class vocal exercises. With Sally, you'll learn the business side of things, including how to get a demo together, approaching an agent and knowing what to expect, union/non-union recording rates, and how to market yourself if all else fails. Eight Wednesdays, July 7-August 25, 2004. 7pm-9pm. Registration deadline: Tuesday, July 6. Limited to 12 students. Students must bring a battery-operated tape recorder and two hours worth of tape to class for individualized recording exercises. All of my adult life people have told me that I have a nice speaking voice or radio voice, but I've never done anything with it. At the Perfect Pitch contest, one of the panelists mentioned that he had become distracted from what I was saying by listening to my voice. I've always been interested in doing voiceover work, but gave up on the idea when I auditioned for the Georgia Reading Network and was turned down for reading to the blind. I'm feeling adventurous. I think I'll do it!

 GHETTO ENVY "Say it," I said. Joan giggled. We were sitting at Arby's after church. "Say it." "Why?' "It makes me laugh." "Why?" "It just sounds funny when you say it. C'mon, say it." Joan put down her sandwich and leaned across the table. "Black folk." I laughed hysterically. Joan began referring to African-Americans as black folk a few years ago when she began spending time with our friend, Ray. Joan began to embrace so many things African-American. Ray accused her of having ghetto envy. I just enjoy the way Joan says black folk. It's something in the way she massages the sounds with her mouth. It just fills me with delight and makes joy burst out of my mouth. Wouldn't it be great if everyone felt such joy about black folk? I have to believe that one day we will finally grow and move beyond all of our prejudices.

 DRINKING A FIFTH ON THE FOURTH Mark told me to meet him at Paul's condo about 5:45pm. We were going over to Doug's condo for a barbecue. As I drove across town, I wondered if Doug knew I was coming along. I hate to crash parties uninvited, unless of course Bananarama is there and then you just need to get out of my way. I'm sorry, but I'm there number one fan. Paul seemed a bit surprised to see me. I mentally replayed changing clothes at my house just to check that I had not actually put on a French maid's outfit or my WWJD thong. These of course would explain a quizical stare. "Am I early?" I asked. "Not now," Paul replied slyly, "But fifteen minutes earlier and you would have." Mark and Steve arrived a few minutes later. We went to Publix to pick up a few thigns to take over. I learned that we had missed the party for the most part and we were taking things over to have an after party. I was directed to bring a platter of patriotic cookies and some Arizona iced tea with lemon flavor. Doug greeted us warmly and I met his girlfriend, Rachel, whom Paul led me to believe was a coatcheck girl, but is actually a court clerk. We had a spirited discussion about the legalities of ripping music from CD's and then making copies for friends and/or selling them to used CD stores. It is always interesting to watch Paul debate someone whom can hold his own with him. He has such a delightful look on his face when he meets someone who can almost be his equal. I ate way too many cookies. I must have been hungrier than I thought. The icing turned my tongue blue and I looked as if I had just rimmed Nightcrawler from the X-Men. Doug insisted that I eat a patriotic cupcake, which I did. That combined with with the Doritos and ice tea almost sent me into a sugar coma. I trised sushi and watched Southpark for the first time. I guess this virgin can't be thrown into the volcano anymore. Doug is obsessed with soccer and shared his World Cup CD's with us. He has to be one of my all time favorite straight people to observe. He is a bundle of energy and thoughts. He's not a big ball of masculine bravado, pretending to be something he's not. He has managed to retain the enthusiasm of a little boy and channel into a myriad of interests that range from public policy to unusual toys from the eighties. Rachel complements him well. She is very intelligent and earthy - two of my favorite qualities. I also have to admire her for almost as eating as many cookies as I did. We had an interesting conversation about the differences of being born Catholic as opposed to being born Jewish. I feel that it's easier to decide to choose to not be Catholic as opposed to choose to not be Jewish if you were born into either religion. Although they both utilize guilt very effectively, I think Jewish culture is more entwined in the psyche than Catholicism. After all, Jews have historically descended from the tribes of Israel and we discussed how they were consdidered their own race by the Nazis. We also discussed how easy it is for the gay community to slide back and loose social acceptance. After all, look at how open and accepted gay culture was in Germany prior to Hitler's rise to power. None of us felt that there is anyway that the Georgia Constitutional Amendment against gay marriage will be stopped. Even though 2/5 of Georgia lives in the Atlanta area, the other 3/5 will vote for it. Written so broadly, it's bound to effect domestic partnership benefits for both same sex couples and opposite sex couples. I questioned what would happen if you had a couple where partner B obtained medical benefits through partner A's company and then wad diagnosed with a serious illness. If the new law means that the company can no longer insure partner B even if they want to, what happens to partner B's medical treatment once the benefits are gone? Partner B cannot apply with another insurance company because partner B now has a pre-existing medical condition. We left about 11:30pm and I was surprised we had stayed so long. I had a great time when I had seriously thought about just staying home earlier. I was able to spend time with my peeps (Paul, Andrew, Mark and Steve), get to know Doug a little bit better and find a new friend, Rachel.

 KABBALAH THIS! Joan gave me an interview with Madonna that was in Oprah magazine to read. As usual, Madonna waxed on about the Kabbalah and I was surprised to hear how much it sounded like Unity where I go to church. Now most people will tell you that Kabbalah is not a religion, but a path. Unity has been called the same. I found myself wanting to know more. I did a little research on-line, but never found anything I liked so I looked up several books on the Internet and decided to check them out at Borders today. Unfortunately, I never found any that I liked. I have a book on Kabbalah somewhere, but I seem to remember that I couldn't get into it. I have studied the Tree of Life before. I've recently begun practicing yoga again and I'm listening to Madonna a lot. Am I becoming Madonna... or Mandonna? I admire her for her drive. I guess I'll have to see what happens as I continue with yoga and if I explore Kabbalah in more detail.

 CONVERSATIONS WITH JOAN Yesterday was a lazy day. I came home after taking Jeff to the airport and went back to bed. I woke up about 10:30am, which might as well have been 4:00pm my time. I never sleep that late. I took it easy around the house and then Joan came by to pick me up and went out to dinner at Nuevo Laredo for her birthday. Nuevo Laredo is a Mexican restaurant that is out in the industrial district beyond Chatahoochie Boulevard. There is always a wait so we went early. Fortunately, we only had to wait about five minutes. We ordered chicken chimechangas and drank margaritas and Dr. Pepper. As I was admiring some art on the wall, I asked, "Why can't angels be allowed to drink beer if they want to?" Joan looked at the artwork and said, "That's not a beer bottle. That's a bugle." "You see your reality," I said. "I see mine." Afterwards, we went to Tower Records and Joan read magazines about Janet Jackson while I looked at exercise magazines that told me how to lose my body fat. Somehow, I don't think I can outrun it. I flirted with the idea of buying a pornographic magazine while Jeff was away. "What kind would you get?" Joan asked. "Oh, you know... something with a smooth, pretty boy who shaves his asshole. The usual." We decided to go to Jake's for ice cream. I ordered Devyn's Animal Crackers and Chocolate Pecan Pie Scream and Joan had Slap Yo Mama Chocolate and Strawberry Cheesecake, I believe. We went upstairs and ate our ice scream while Joan discussed some things in her life that she wants to work on and achieve before her next birthday. A boy and girl came upstairs and stood in the doorway. He mentioned every piece of furniture in the room, but ignored us. I began moving like one of the animatronic presidents at Disneyworld and began saying, "Four score and seven years ago...." We finished the evening off at my house. We were going to watch The Dame Edna Experience, but Joan decided that she wanted to make a treasure map, which is a visual representation of something you want to manifest in your life. She cut several words and pictures out of magazines and glued them onto some colored paper while I made an inventory of my mid-year goals. It was very helpful and I feel much clearer now about what I want to accomplish before the year's end. Finally, we both realized we were tired. She went home and I went to bed. It was a nice evening.

 THE ROAD TO CENTRAL AMERICA As many of you may know, 2F's is now in Central America on a missionary trip. He has gone every summer for the last four years. The first year it was hard because we were just three years into our relationship and had only been living together for a few months. The second year was easier. Last year I dropped his fuzzy butt off at the airport and went to buy the new Harry Potter book and went home to read it over a chicken buiscitt. Tim and I drove up to Helen, Georgia that afternoon and had lunch. I enjoyed having the house to myself. Buddy and I ordered a pizza and watched movies together. Toward the end of the week, I missed him and was glad to see him return. I think relationships grow the most when you're apart. Jeff was packed early this year and we managed to get into bed before 11:00pm. As we were attempting to go to sleep, a huge fireworks display began at Turner Field. We could see them from the window and the sound was loud. It sounded like we were in a combat zone. After twenty minutes, I got up and came down stairs to finish laundry. We got up shortly before four and I drove him to the airport. He seemed very concerned to be separated from me for this week. I certainly don't believe that he thinks I'm going to misbehave in his absence, but I wonder what he wanted me to do or say to make him feel better. After four years, I've sort of gotten used to his absence for a week. He enjoys going and I support him in doing so. Plus, we're in the phase of our relationship where we've been together long enough that we're not chasing each other around the furniture anymore. Well, we never really did, but we're at the stage where our relationship is based more on friendship and companionshihp than it is on urgent physical intimacy. We both have goals we are working on right now and we're both pretty focused on those goals. I've realized that in focusing on our goals so much, we really don't make a lot of time for each other anymore. Granted, eat dinner together each evening and talk several times a day, but we don't spend a lot of time together where we are just focusing on each other. We don't ever make out on the couch anymore while listening to the Saturday night jazz program on Public Radio. I've realized that he is so fixated on opening the book store that there are times where I feel I must write a title on my spine to get his attention. I think I'll plan some things for when he returns. On the way to the airport, he expressed his concern about our communication skills. It was a dire prognosis. The way he talks, you would think we are Israel and Palestine. I've talked with other couples I know and they have confirmed that even the best couples don't always communicate one hundred percent of the time. For example, while he was gone on Friday, a woman came by and dropped an enevelope off for Jeff to give to her son when he went to Central America. I didn't think that Jeff would be back before I left so I put the package on the bed upstairs with the other stuff he laid out to pack. When I returned home later, he said that he had been waiting around all afternoon for this woman to come by. I told him that she had and I had placed the package upstairs. He then proceeded to tell me that I should have told him. Now, he wasn't here. He doesn't keep his cell phone on unless he is expecting a call and I can leave notes for him that will never be read no matter where I place them. I told him that leaving the package by his dufflebag seemed like the most obvious choice since he told me he would be packing this afternoon. He didn't see it even though it was right on top of the bed where he had laid papers down on top of it. Then he wanted to know where the been jerky was and I said I didn't know. The woman handed me the envelope and give it to him and I did. Jeff then launched into the communication lecture about how I need to do a better job of communicating with him or else the earth is going to spin off its axis and fly into the sun. Now, I'm not perfect, but I refuse to believe that I have almost made it to the ripe old age of thirty-seven and have managed to communicate effectively with most of the people in the world. Until I learn to read minds, I'm just going to have to do the best I can.

 BIG BUSINESS Things have really exploded this week with work. I've had one client come back from the dead and two new clients referred by one of my realtor partners. Carol Lynn said that it would be happening soon and now it is. After months of marketing and struggling to some degree, I'm beginning to see results. I have the potential of having seven loans in my pipeline this month. I'm excited to be busy doing loans instead of marketing and actually having the opportunity to help people. Someone asked me the other day if I still enjoyed my job. I thought about it for a moment and I said, "Yes." I like helping people. I like having clients that may have some part of their application that is not perfect and finding a solution that works for them. I also enjoy getting paid. I can work all I want, but if I don't turn in loans that close, I don't get paid. I'm feeling more confident these days in my ability. One of my realtor partners called Saturday morning and asked for a good prequalification letter becaue he was having some trouble from the other realtor. As I was faxing the letter, the other realtor called and it was actually a realtor I knew. Andrew had actually asked me to work with him in February when his loan officer was leaving the industry to take another job. Unfortunately, the job fell through and Andrew remained with his loan officer. However, I admire loyalty. Andrew asked me about the borrowers and I told him they were great and they would have not problem paying the mortgage on their current house as well as the new house while waiting for the old house to sell. This relieved Andrew and kept the deal from falling through. There are 20,000 realtors in the Atlanta area. What are the chances that I would know the other realtor? Sometimes I have the feeling that God is winking at me. This was one of those moments.

 CHECK YER HEAD! I actually had the opportunity to visit a few blogs today and Beastmomma presented an interested idea of stating what areas of our lives are we looking at in this moment. Here's what came to mind: Mortgage Business - My business is beginning to expand and I'm hitting the goals that I have set for myself. I've noticed that areas of my work that I used to be uncomfortable with in the past are now comfortable and my confidence has increased as well. Whenever it occurs to me that I need another loan for my pipeline, I relax and let go of the thought instead of worrying about it. I have actually had a new client call me within five minutes of doing this. My Relationship - I'm looking at the communication between my partner and myself and see room for improvement. I'm also becoming aware that we have grown as far as we can in some areas and that we need to reevaluate some things and make modifications to move forward. It's nothing negative or pessimistic. Every realtionship is a dance with constant modifications. Such a process would have scared me in the past, but I have become very comfortable with change. I feel that universal intelligence is always at hand and will guide me if I remain calm. Writing - I have been astounded to discover how much I enjoy writing, but feel that I have not had much time to do so. My goal is to write every day for at least thirty minutes. If I choose to write longer after thirty minutes, I can. I am giving myself permission to try different writing styles and formats. It's okay for me to embrace the essay and lesbian fiction. Thunderbirds are go! My Environment - My bedroom and desk are a mess. Anyone who knows me can tell you this is unnatural. However, in an attempt to organize and simplify my life, I have pulled things out of closets and stacked them in my bedroom until I figure out where to put them. In a way it seems to be symbolic of some of the things I am outgrowing in my relationship and is a visual cue that I need to find a new way to interact with my partner to have my needs met and to meet his. I'm in love with a minimalist design philosphy and I loan to have more negative space in my room. My eyes need to rest on open spaces. Fitness/Nutrition - I've felt a need to let go of the low-carb thing for the time being and just eat normally, but in moderation. I got off track for a week when I was ill and eating some junk food left me feeling blah. I've become bored with running again, but started walking five miles three or four times a week. I've also started swimming again. I love learning to make my body more streamline by changing its shape in the water and seeing how that affects how quickly I move with the least amount of effort. Observation - I'm paying more attention to my thoughts and feelings and allowing myself to explore them without jugment or fear. I'm suddenly the "What If Boy!"

 BUDDING ROMANCE KNEW NO BARRIER It's stories like this one that give me hope about people. I came across this article in last Sunday's urlLink AJC about a young Carrollton hemophiliac who wanted a girlfriend, but was challenged by his HIV status. It was such a beautiful story that I'm tempted to turn it into a screenplay. urlLink Truth trumps HIV in affair of the heart A hemophiliac infected as a child, Jay Minish spent his teen years and early 20s fearing love was forever off-limits. But he refused to give up his quest. Helena Oliviero - Staff Sunday, June 27, 2004 A chubby-faced Jay Minish pushed the microphone away after his 30-minute speech about living with the virus that causes AIDS. "Do you have a girlfriend?" a female student asked. "Not right now, but I hope to have one real soon," Jay said, flashing his signature grin. "Are you a virgin?" a sweet-looking blonde asked. Some of the teenagers burst into nervous giggles. An adult moderator at the Alpharetta high school told Jay he didn't have to answer. But Jay beamed. He liked the question. It went to the core of his struggle as a twentysomething who worried about spending his life alone. "God, Almighty. That's probably the best question I ever got," he said, blushing. His palms got sweaty. He brought the microphone close and said, "Yes, I am a virgin." Born a hemophiliac, Jay was infected with the human immunodeficiency virus as a child while being treated for the inherited blood disorder. Struggling with both illnesses, he lived his life walking a thin wire. A simple fall could provoke uncontrollable bleeding. A mix-up in HIV medication could be deadly. But he didn't stop living because he was afraid of dying. Jay, a native of Carrollton, traveled across Georgia and spoke to tens of thousands of students as an AID Atlanta speaker. He called his speeches "therapy." Dressed in Tommy Hilfiger jeans, he blended with his peers. He enjoyed the benefits of young adulthood: independence, close friends and his own car, a canary yellow Dodge Neon. But what gnawed at him was what he wanted above everything else: romance. He was part of the first generation of children to survive HIV into adulthood, because of advances in medication. But surviving posed a new set of challenges. Although these children did not contract HIV through sex, they have a disease usually associated with physical intimacy. And that dichotomy made the simple hope of finding true love seem out of reach. "The hardest part of living with HIV is not having a girlfriend," Jay said. Walking away Every Wednesday night over pitchers of Bud Light and a basket of fries, Jay, 24, played trivia with friends at Los Locos in Carrollton. He reveled in the games and the opportunity to meet women. They flocked to him, a well-mannered young man who wore pressed khakis and a crisp white cotton shirt to bars. He smelled fresh, like Zest. But when they learned he was HIV-positive, they walked away. "It happens all the time," said his friend Gena Willard. "A woman will walk up to me and say, 'Jay is so great.' But after a date or two, the woman disappears. She doesn't return his calls or says, 'Let's just be friends.' " On a night last December, a twentysomething blonde flirted during trivia. He smiled back, but brushed her off. "I just am not up to it tonight," Jay said as he returned to his seat. He sat next to his buddy John Olsen. Olsen whistled at his girlfriend, Sarah Muller, to get a kiss. Muller kissed her boyfriend once on the lips, twice on the cheeks. Jay looked away. But he knew love was possible. Three years ago, a nursing student chased him across a parking lot to give him her phone number. He called her a couple of days later, and they laughed through their first date over cheese grits at a Waffle House. But the woman's mother began to fear the virus, and fear him, according to Jay. After two months, he sat with the woman and her mother at their kitchen table. The mother thought the relationship was too dangerous. She begged the couple to separate. Jay wept in his car and headed home. Staying positive Jay's parents always focused on the positive. Shortly after he learned of his HIV status in the seventh grade, his parents pulled him off the community swim team after several parents complained. Jay's father, Dan Minish, found another way for his son to swim. As a middle schooler, Jay and his father attended Camp Sunburst, a California summer camp for HIV-infected children. Jay's parents encouraged their only son to play pingpong and manage the high school basketball team. They indulged him with rare baseball cards, beach vacations and fishing excursions. Though divorced, they regularly sat together with him at Braves games. Jay and his father, a former sports information director at the State University of West Georgia, developed a spirited college rivalry. Jay rooted for the University of Georgia, his father for Georgia Tech. Jay's mother whipped up his favorite snack --- deviled eggs --- anytime he asked. "I never let myself get down because I surround myself by so many positive people --- my friends and family," Jay said. "My dad has a way of always making me laugh." But when it came to girls, his parents --- united in concern for their son --- were at a loss. His mother, Terri Todd, knew he was lonely, but what could she possibly say? His father wept openly at the thought. While rejection by girls is a natural part of growing up, Jay never seemed to get a fair shot. But he was upbeat and thoughtful and had lots of friends. He regularly taped a wrestling show for a friend who worked nights. He obtained a $500 loan last year to help pay for Christmas gifts for his "extended family." At Applebee's, where he worked as a waiter, he danced in the kitchen to make his co-workers chuckle. Even Jay's doctors sympathized. "How are things in the girl department?" Dr. James Steinberg asked during one of Jay's routine visits to Emory University Hospital. "Nothing new there," he replied, head bowed. Steinberg asked whether Jay had checked into online dating sites for HIV-positive singles. "Yeah, I looked at it once, but it didn't feel right," he said. "Well, we'd be happy to talk to her if it happens," Steinberg said. "And your fan club here" --- pointing to a colleague, Dr. Shanta Zimmer --- "can also give a thumbs up or down." Jay laughed. "OK, OK," he said. "I'll let you know if anything turns up." 'The Speech' Suzanne Brons, a 23-year-old waitress, first eyed Jay while eating at the Applebee's where he worked. Those engaging green eyes. His wide smile. They made eye contact. Jay introduced himself. Suzanne loved his gentle voice. He seemed polite. Suzanne begged her friend Georgia Richards, who also worked at the restaurant, to pass along her number. Richards said she would, but told her that Jay would need to share a secret before "anything happens." Later that week, Suzanne saw Jay again at the Mansion, an upscale Carrollton restaurant where she worked. Someone pointed in Jay's direction and whispered, "You see him? He has HIV." Suzanne wanted to hear it from Jay. She smiled at him and later approached him. He wanted to buy her a drink. "I can buy my own drinks, thank you very much," she said. A few days later, Jay and Suzanne had a date. They met at Jay's one-bedroom apartment in Carrollton to watch the movie "Dumb and Dumberer." But before Jay slid the video into the player, he turned to Suzanne and gave "the Speech." "There's something I need to tell you," he said. He told Suzanne that he was born with hemophilia, a rare disorder in which a person's blood does not clot normally. Sometime during the early 1980s, he was injected with a treatment that was contaminated with HIV. He was diagnosed when he was about 8, but his parents waited a few years before telling him about it. With his hands clasped on his lap, he said flatly, "This is the part when most girls leave." Suzanne, a petite blonde with turquoise-colored eyes, did not. She'd dated a legion of losers, men who blew her off, men who were untrustworthy. "Well, I am not going anywhere," she said. Jay started the movie. Suzanne slipped her hand into Jay's. As the movie went on, they leaned into each other. They laughed. Afterward, Suzanne slept in Jay's bed. They held each other tightly. In the middle of the night, Jay awoke and pulled Suzanne's arm around his waist. He had craved a woman's touch. He wanted to be sure she was still there. For the next three weeks, Suzanne and Jay slept in the same bed every night. They had, according to Suzanne, "a full and complete relationship." "I think it's safer to be with someone and to know what they have and take precautions instead of being with someone and not knowing," Suzanne said. They saw each other during work breaks and text-messaged each other with their cellphones. Jay was romantic. Once he surprised Suzanne with a single red rose, another time with a takeout dinner of country-fried steak and mashed potatoes. He visited four music stores to find a Jimi Hendrix movie after she said she liked his music. He shared his hope of someday having a son to name after his father. He sent her a stream of text messages. I think it is going to work out between us Home safely? Just making sure Listen with your heart. Not your mind Sweet dreams 'I love you' On May 15, a Saturday, Jay celebrated his buddy Greg Waldrop's upcoming wedding over beers and conversation. Suzanne was working across town, but his friends knew about her. He seemed to have found the real thing. Celebrating, Jay was tipsy. At some point during the party, he fell down. Falls and bumps can be quite serious for hemophiliacs, but he got right back up. "Are you OK?" Waldrop asked. "I am perfectly fine," Jay said. Jay slept over at Waldrop's and went home Sunday. By Monday, Suzanne knew something was wrong, but she thought maybe it was that Jay was ignoring her. "Jay did not blow people off," she said. "But I am insecure." On Tuesday afternoon, another friend, Steven Cook, swung by Jay's apartment to maybe watch a game. Jay's Dodge Neon was in the parking lot. Cook knocked on the front door. It was slightly ajar, and swung open. He heard a box fan in Jay's bedroom, but his friend wasn't there. He turned toward the front door to leave, when he noticed a light in the bathroom. Jay was lying on the bathroom floor with spots of dried blood around his nose and mouth. He was alive, but barely. Cook called 911. An ambulance rushed Jay to the emergency department at Tanner Medical Center in Carrollton. Within minutes, a friend notified Suzanne that Jay was in the hospital. Upon arrival, Suzanne saw Jay's father and stepmother, Cindy, waiting outside the emergency department. Still in her waitress uniform, Suzanne halted at the doors. She felt close to Jay, but she had known him less than a month. She wasn't sure she should interfere. Within a couple of hours, more than 100 people --- high school friends, customers from Applebee's, buddies, co-workers and Suzanne --- stood outside the hospital, forming a circle and praying for Jay. There was still hope: Jay had swallowed twice and had moved his body slightly. At nightfall, he was transferred to Atlanta Medical Center. Suzanne tapped out a message on her cellphone while she was on her way to downtown Atlanta. I know you will get through this. I care for you. I love you. At the Atlanta hospital, Suzanne walked into Jay's room. As a handful of friends and family members parted to make room for her, she leaned down and gently placed her arms against Jay's body. She sobbed. Jay had suffered a massive stroke, probably caused by a brain hemorrhage and complicated by his hemophilia. Doctors said it might have been from the fall, or it might have been spontaneous bleeding, common among hemophiliacs. Jay's family, one close friend and Suzanne held hands and encircled Jay. They recited the Lord's Prayer. Then Jay was taken off life support. Suzanne knew the relationship was in its early stages. Jay had never met her family. But she mourns a sweet and brief courtship that might have led to something special. "I have a different kind of hurt," she said. "My hurt is because of the excitement I had. And because I was really looking forward to our relationship." Epilogue About a week after Jay's death, his father opened his son's apartment to friends and asked them to take home anything they wanted as a keepsake. Suzanne fumbled through his closet until she found the blue oxford shirt he wore during their first date. She also picked up the slip of paper with her phone number that he kept on his bedside table. And while cleaning Jay's car, his father found a note from a teenager, written after one of his speeches: "Don't worry, you will find someone for you someday

 WONDER WOMAN BLUES I've been very busy with new business lately and I feel like I haven't had time to read my regular blogs. It seems as if everyone else is experiencing the same thing because it feels like traffic and comments are quiet. I enjoyed reading about Jesse's adventures in San Francisco and Ryan's road trip to his new home in San Diego. I've also enjoyed checking in one of my frequent readers from Malaysia and of course Mick down in Australia. Unfortunately, I haven't had much time to comment. I've had two loans that I just submitted that required some extra work to gather all documents that the underwriter might ask for to ensure that it goes through smoothly. I'm not trying to put anything through that is suspicious, but a good loan officer thinks of anything that an underwriter could think of to halt progress or deny a loan. I received a new lead and had planned to meet with this client tonight to complete the loan application and disclosures, but a friend advised her to check Bankrate.com and of course they are advertising rates that are almost a point lower than I quoted her. We've established a good rapport and she asked me to research it. Well, it was quite interesting to find that when I compare my Annual Percentage Rate (APR) to Bankrate.com's APR, it is more than a a half a point higher than mine, which includes one point of origination. This means that are adding a lot of junk fees and probably a mortgage broker fee to make their money on the back end. Well, when you average these additional fees into the life of the loan, it results in a higher APR so their customer will really have a higher interest rate. I hate that. That take advantage of people and make me look bad. My client's birthday is tomorrow so I'll have a nice surprise for her. I went to purchase The New Adventures Of Wonder Woman DVD yesterday, but Circuit City was sold out. This surprised me. I had to go to three different Circuit City stores to find a copy and I got the last one. I had a gift card so I wanted to use it. It brought back so many memories to watch it. It was much cheesier than I remember from when I was eight years old. I realized that the last time I saw these episodes was 29 years ago. It was hysterical to see Fannie (Fried Green Tomatoes) Flagg as the Amazon Doctor and Cloris Leachman was horrible as Queen Hypolite. It was just to shades away from being a French & Saunders sketch. I also realized how much they watered down Wonder Woman. She is rolling around on a desk struggling with Stella Stevens and in the comic book Wonder Woman would have kicked her ass with her pinkie. She is strong as Superman. Still, I love the plots taking place in WWII. Jeff watched a bit of it with me tonight. Every time Diana Prince spun around and turned into Wonder Woman, he was captivated.

 IT WAS JUST MONDAY.... It's amazing how quickly time flies. My mother always said that you older you get, the faster time goes. Perhaps it has something to do with momentum gained going down hill. However, age is a state of mind and I don't mean to imply that as you get older, everything goes to hell. In fact, I feel better with every year and I'm in better shape now than when I was younger. Maybe as we age our molecules vibrate at a faster rate. It's been a busy week. Wednesday and Thursday were especially busy. Wednesday was Jeff's birthday and he turned 45. That makes him nine years older than me, which seems to freak some people out for some reason. Personally, I find him delightfully immature on some levels so I'm sure we even out. (Just kidding.) He had dinner with his family and I went to voiceover class. We were going to go out for dinner and a movie last night, but he decided he just wanted a night at home and we're going to go out on Sunday evening. However, we actually went to eat the Flat Iron Grill in East Atlanta because we didn't feel like cooking. The Flat Iron Grill is a smoker's paradise, but it wasn't overly smokey. There were quite a few pumped up gay men there, which surprised me because it doesn't really reek with fabulousness. I had the parmesean chicken with wild rice and sauteed vegetables and let me tell you, those sauteed vegetables were delicious. I suspect they had a lot of salt, but I don't eat them every day. Last night we cleaned the house because my close friend, Susan, is coming to visit today. I could have a month's worth of blog entries for my adventures with Susan, but suffice it to say that for the years 1989-1994, the Dallas/Fort Worth area wasn't safe if we were around. I'm looking forward to seeing her. It used to be impossible for us not to speak several times a day and now we may trade two or three e-mails per year and go to dinner when I'm home for the holidays. It's strange, but it's juse one of those, "Omigod! I've grown up and become and adult!" things. Yesterday, I became totally obsessed with the Eurythmics again. I found a mix CD I made with several of their remixes of the greatest hits and it was fantastic. I had completely forgotten some of the imagery that Annie Lennox could paint with words. "When you touch my skin, I smell disaster," and "I could give you a mirror to show you disappointment." It's definitely not Bananarama, but still good stuff. I met with Danny on Wednesday afternoon to discuss scripts. I was a little apprehensive because Danny had ripped me a new hole because my script was 137 pages long and you should really try to have it no longer than 120 pages. After printing out his script, I saw it was 125 pages. However, I suspected that his comment was truly intended to be helpful and his manner was specific to his personality. I actually enjoyed Danny's script. It was well written. I gave him some feedback about what stood out for me and what came to mind. Some of my thoughts he had heard from other people already and some of my suggestions were new and seemed to excite him. I always offer feedback as just my opinion and do with it what you feel you need to do. It's easier to see things from the outside than the inside when it comes to written work. Danny gave me some good feedback on mine. Ironically, he didn't make a lot of marks in my script. Even after Jeff and I had gone through it twice, Danny still found a few typos. It was a bit embarrassing. He said he laughed out loud several times, which is not an easy thing to do. That made me feel good and suggested some pieces of dialogue I could cut. My playwriting background always makes me feel compelled to spell everything out, which I don't need to do in a screenplay. A movie tells a story through action. A play tells a story through dialogue. I was already aware of this. Most importantly, Danny gave me some confidence in a few areas of my script that I was questioning. He felt they were fine so I'm not going to worry about them anymore. His thoughts were basically that I have two stories. One is about a little girl who falls in love with her gay neighbor and tries to kill his new boyfriend. The other is about both the neighbor and the little girl's mother beginning to date again. I was actually surprised I wrote so much about the relationships and I'm going to edit that down. I also read through the script a bit the other night and was able to see things I wanted to tighten up. I'm feeling good about it. Danny and I are going to get together again in early September with two of the other contestants from the Perfect Pitch Contest and just kind of talk about screenwriting and swap books and stuff. We're going to do rewrites to share with each other in October. The Mothball will be over by then. It's nice to know other people who have the same interests and goals that I do. We understand and support one another. In closing, I'd like to put the Cult of Jef Spotlight on urlLink Me Southern . He had a very inspirational post from yesterday about a friend of his. It encompasses many things, but I have found it very moving and motivating.

 VOICEOVER CLASS #5 I'm really feeling bad that I have had so little time to do my homework for voiceover class. It would have been better if I took this class in October. I saw Kevin tonight. I ran into him at the baseball game on Friday. It was so weird seeing someone I know in the 45,000 people at the game. We spoke briefly and there was nothing to say. Ironically, it seemed there was so much to say last Friday. Mr. Puppydog continues to watch me out of the corner of his eye, but tonight I was too tired to care. I asked a question tonight and Stuart jumped. He said I always sneak in and it takes him by surprise when he first notices me. He asked me what my name was and I told him that my Hewbrew name was Esther. He thought I was serious and I could see him bracing himself for my dietary requirements. I think he likes me. I think he likes me because I'm a natural smart ass. Don't be fooled by cheap immitations. We all went around the room and read the same sentence differently. The whole blending thing still throws me off, but I decided to read the line as if I was trying to pick someone up in a bar. Evidently I did very well. I was told that I sounded like a cross between Hugo Speer in The Matrix and James Mason. Sadly, none of the women were moved enough to offer to have my baby. We then went around the room and read our commercials. Spanish Girl read a commercial about fake eye lashes. She read with greate excitement and her voice went higher and higher with each word. I thought she was going to explode. I almost ran for the hills for safety. She has an interesting accent without an accent. Mr. Puppydog reads everything as if the sirens have gone off to tell everyone to evacuate the city. He has a youthful voice, but I wish he'd slow down. Eric read a radio spot for a safe place for teenage runaways to go to. He has a nice voice like everyone's best friend. Stuart thought it conjured up images of child molesters being tempted by these children waiting in these safe places. I suggested that Eric read it again as Hanibal Lecter. One of the local anchor people off the evening news is in our class. He's a nice guy with a great voice. I spoke to Stuart tonight as I left about continuing to take classes with him after the class is over. He thought it was a good idea and thinks that I have potential. After five weeks, I'm encouraged.

 THROW ROCKS AT BOYS I don't normally advocate violence, but I really enjoyed urlLink this . Thanks to urlLink Daniel .

 DRIVING HOME I stopped at a traffic light by Centential Park , which is next to Philips Arena and CNN Center . There is a huge video screen on the outside of the building. As I looked up, they were showing footage of Sesame Street On Ice . There were some new muppets with lots of dangly tentacles. They were very unsettling. Then they disolved into Van Halen. The light turned green and I moved on. I was be-bopping along to Gary Numan's Cars when I passed a truck with a man in the back. He was bent over and appeared to be moving something around because it looked like he was shaking his butt in time to the music in my car. It made me laugh.

 I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT ORAL SEX AGAIN Why do we refer to fellatio as a blow job? You don't actually blow anything up. Well, not with explosives anyway. I always pictured a frazzled mother blowing air into a life-size, inflatable Barney through an air nozzle conveniently placed in his groin. Can you imagine doing that to another guy? I like to take my time. I'm afraid that he would explode from over inflation. Then again, what if you lost your grip and he went flying all helter skelter all over the room? Furthermore, why do we refer to orally stimulating an anus, vagina or clitoris as eating out? You don't actually pay a check or leave a tip. There is no basket of hot rolls and the vagina is the last place you would want to bring yeast to. You do not actually take a bite of anything and ingest it for sustenance. I've never seen someone squirt a shot of tabasco sauce onto an anus, vagina or clitoris and chow down. English sure is funny language.

 BOND'ING AT THE OFFICE I left the house at 6:20am to go to the PowerCore meeting. I was a bit off the cuff today and people seemed to find the phrase "drinking a beer while sitting in a lawn chair in a kiddie pool in his backyard" very funny. Personally I don't get it. I was just selling a dream. One of the Gopher Girls returned. I met a client at a bagel place and took her application and then drove to the office. I worked at my desk putting together several files I needed to turn in. Kiki gave me a Shirley Bassey CD to listen to that is nothing but remixes of her hit songs from her long and illustrious career. It has several of the James Bond theme songs she has recorded such as: Diamonds Are Forever ; Moonraker ; and Goldfinger . (I bet you didn't realize there was a theme song to Moonraker , did you?) I kept humming Goldfinger to myself. Finding myself alone and the office quiet, I suddenly had the urge to belt out, "Mistah Goooooldfingaaaaah. He's the man, the man with the Midus touch, a spidah's touch." I sang the whole song through and then turned to find all of my co-workers in the doorway of our office staring at me. Without missing a beat, I said, "Tips are appreciated," and walked past them to copy pay-stubs and bank statements. They all broke into applause. You know something? They're kind of weird.

 DALLAS 1992-1993 I moved to Dallas, Texas in 1992. I felt I needed to start over again. I had graduated from UTA the following year and was still living in a duplex near school with Chris, my roommate, friend and... something between fuck buddy and boyfriend. I basically had a nervous breakdown in the summer of 1992. The catalyst was finding a message from Chris' boyfriend on the answering machine. (And you thought that kind of thing just happened in movies.) At the time, I thought we were getting closer to a permanent relationship, but evidently I was mistaken. In reality, it didn't have much to do with Chris. I was nursing wounds from my family and my grandmother's death from many years before. Ultimately, I had a great fear of abandoment, which stemmed from a time when my parents separated and almost divorced and my grandmother dying on the operating table while undergoing bypass surgery. My grandmother was the most important person in my life and when she died, I was gutted. I just realized her birthday was yesterday. I had opted for being laid off from TRW , where I was working at the time, and did not accept their offer to move to Atlanta. (The irony is not lost on me.) It just didn't seem like it was the right time. I didn't feel like I could move to a new city where I didn't know anyone. Instead, I took a job at JC Penney's in a credit call center for Saks 5th Avenue . Chris decided he wanted a change to and we moved together. In hindsight, it was probably not the best idea, but we had made a pledge to always be friends and be there for one another no matter what. Loyalty means something to me. We chose an apartment complex where fellow conspirators of Timothy McVey would be arrested a few years later. The job at Penney's didn't pan out. The manager for the Saks Fifth Avenue credit division met me and decided she hated me. I know that sounds like something a kid would say, but it was literally what happened. I said good morning to her and her lip curled up. I had 100+ scores on my training tests and one day was asked to leave. At first I was angry because I had never been fired before and I called them on their bluff. The head of HR got nervous and I realized that it was a blessing in disguise. The place was like a Nazi concentration camp. People were written up for being late when there was a huge wreck on the freeway. Suddenly without a job, I went and applied at Today's Temporary and was working the next day. This led to a temporary to permanent job for American Eagle Aviation Insurance . I worked for a boy from Iceland named Thor. He looked like one of the children from The Village of the Damned all grown up. Thor liked me and inisted on getting right in my face to speak with me. He had very bad breath. I was always offering him gum, but he never took the hint. One day I swore I would feign being overwhelmed by the odor and pass out. I never did. There was gray sense of melancholy that underscored my existence at that time. I made very little money and had a college degree that seemed worthless in the recession. Madonna's Erotica album was the big thing and I don't recall ever hearing any of the songs on the radio. I was far from Susan and Joan and the friends I did make in Dallas seemed very superficial. Chris was still seeing "the boyfriend" occasionally. Susan and I finally got a look at him and we thought he looked like Floyd the barber on the Andy Griffith Show so we began referring to him as Floyd. Chris and I still maintained a consistent sex life just to make things really confusing for both of us. I would sometimes go to the Wave with Colin and we would pick up abandoned drinks off the railing and offer them to people we didn't like. We eventually began spending time at the Round Up and before long I had a pair of ropers. I liked to watch the men dance together. After you adjusted to the shock of seeing men dance together, it really is quite beautiful. I remember watching one fellow in particular when the lights were down low as he two-stepped around the floor to Pam Tillis' Maybe It Was Memphis . It was straight out of a movie and I fell in love with him. Some time later I actually met him and he had a very high voice and was very effeminate. This was not congruent with the picture I had created, but it taught me something. It's best not to fall in love with someone until you really know them. It wasn't his efeminancy that bothered me. It was the fact that I had constructed an entire illusion based upon my needs instead of just allowing myself to get to know someone's authentic self. We used to talk to Randall, the doorman. He was funny and wise and taught me that I should never wear a straw hat after Labor Day. Randall smoked cigarettes that smelt like the kind my grandmother used to smoke. I don't like cigarette smoke, but I love the smell of when a cigarette is first lit. There was another boy that I used to watch. He was closer to my age, always wore a pager and I liked the way he chewed gum. Randall said he had a buiscit butt, flat and round. I should have asked more people to dance, but I was afraid. I didn't feel that I danced very well even though I went to the lessons on Sunday evening. Kent danced very well and would stay on the floor all night. Our friend, Danita, came with us and I used to practive with her, but I soon became frustrated and quit. She always insisted on leading and had trouble with the turns. Danita was a big girl from Kansas and when we came to a turn, she would just pick me up and set me down again. It was very disporienting and I soon just had to say no. I don't know when exactly it happened, but one day without saying it, Randall communicated to me that I needed to quit hanging out in a cowboy bar and talking to the doorman and live my life. He was pushing the baby bird from the nest. It was just in his eyes when he looked at me. "You're young. You should be living not wasting your time talking to an old coot like me." I moved on even though I liked talking to him. In January of 1993, Kent was diagnosed with HIV and eventually full-blown AIDS. I was devastated. Donna, Michael and I gathered around him in his father's house. It got very serious and I asked him if I could have his couch when he died. Kent busted out laughing. No one understood because we understood each other in ways even we didn't know. I just knew he had become far to serious and I had to ground him with humor. We had our own language like twins and our devotion to one another was matched by no one other than possibly a mama bear and her cub. After all, we had been friends since we were 13. Kent spent a lot of time talking with Randall, who was also positive. I took time off from work to be with him. He started on medications and slowly began to return to his normal life. Meanwhile, the underlying depression that was already there was only further complicated by Kent's diagnosis. For the first time in my life, I had several mornings where I woke up and just didn't have the motivation to get out of bed. It drove me crazy to lie there, but it just didn't seem like there was anything worth getting up for. Things weren't getting better, they were getting worse. To be continued....

 MORTGAGE QUESTION 243 Welcome to my world.... Client:

 GIVE ME AN OMEN, GIVE ME A SIGN Living in Grant Park, I meet a lot of interesting neighbors. On the way back from one of my morning runs, I met an older lady who practices what I guess would be mailiomancy. She meditates on a question in her life and then reads her mail like tarot cards. Problem: she can never find her bifocals or car keys. Mail: an offer for recipe cards and a misdirected copy of Field & Stream with a big hefty bass on the cover. Meaning: eat more fish to improve her memory. I thought I would give it a whirl: Problem: I don't have enough time to work on my writing projects. Mail: an offer for a free booklet Practicing the Presence of God ; an offer from Providian to give me a free FICO score; copy of Daily Word featuring a woman who is preserving North American folk songs when not serving as a chuck wagon cook on cattle drives and an offer to receive six issues of [2] magazine for just $19.99, which features hot photospreads of beefy gay couples getting it on for my entertainment pleasure. Meaning: I'm afraid to know. More over, who has sold my information so that I now receive offers for gay porn? I bet it's that damn Children's Digest .

 IT CAME FROM THE 23RD PEW I looked up casually and saw the red eyes glowing at me as Reverend John continued his sermon on prophetic ministry. I leaned forward to get a better look. It appeared to be battery operated and quite large, say 12-inches. It seemed to be a cross between an insect, human and android. He had a friend and the little boy was pitting them against one another as Reverend John talked about our ultimate quest for world peace. "Why can't we all just get along?" The little boy, who I call Jamar just because it felt right to me, had one action figure toss the other across the pew. Next, he tossed him in the air and I full expected Jamar to hurl one of the bugoids high in the air and lodge it in the rafters. The little toy arms clinging for escape to the beam above us. However, that didn't happen. The sermon ended and we gave our tithes and offerings, blessed it, read the ticket for the winner of the book store gift certificate for parking in remote parking and taking the shuttle and then joined hands to sing The Peace Song . Boy, that sounds funny when you read it. It sounds a bit cultish, but that's far too interesting for me. Jamar reminded me of what I was like when I was younger and going to our local Church of Christ in Waco, Texas. My mother used to give us Lifesaver candy until the day she looked over and found me with my head leaned over the back of the pew dangling a cherry candy in my mouth by the little waxy, green string you use to open the package. I think she knocked me on the back of my head to have me sit up, but instead I dropped the Lifesaver in my mouth and swallowed it whole, green string and all. Another time she got bent out of shape because I was reading a Spider-Man anthology in church. Okay, so maybe I was reclining across the pew with my head resting on one hand, similar to Burt Reynolds infamoust Cosmopolitan centerfold, but I ask you, "Was I hurting anybody?" Furthermore, I was reading about the forces of good triumphing over the forces of evil. One day we were sitting in church and a little boy maybe five or six was standing in the pew in front of us. He stared at my mother and then stuck his tongue out. He turned around for a moment and then repeated it. He did this several times before his own mother caught him and took him outside the sanctuary and spanked him. I smiled as I listened to the little cuss get what he deserved. On our way to the steakhouse after the service, I asked my mother if she heard the little boy scream as he received his spanking. "Yes," she replied. "But now I feel bad that I stuck my tongue out first."

 THERE IS A SONG IN MY HEAD It never fails that there is always a song in my head that I absentmindly hum to myself through out the day. Lately, it's been She Bangs by Ricky Martin. I'm not sure why. I have nothing against Ricky. He is a fine man. Well, he is a FINE man, but what I meant is that I have no bone to pick with... This is just getting worse. You know what I mean. Anyway, I like to sing it with great emphasis on the "Bangs." Me:

 WEEKEND POST-MORTEM My head is still spinning from how quickly this weekend went by. Friday evening Jeff and I went to Braves game with Brian and Brian. It's funny to think that we can walk to Turner Field from our house, but it's not a good idea to try and walk back at night through Summer Hill. At the edge of the parking lot there is a tall metal tower that is crowned with the cauldron from the '96 Olympics. It symbolizes so many things to me since I moved out here in May of that year and people told me I wouldn't find a job or a place to live because of the Olympics. Many people left the city and frankly, traffic couldn't have been better. Eight years have gone by since that time andmy life has changed in so many ways. When I look at the cauldron now, it makes me think of McDonalds french fries because it is shaped like one of those red containers. I may need to take a picture and do some Photoshop work. Turner field is about a third of the Olympic Stadium that was used in 1996 and is now home to the Atlanta Braves. We had really good seats for the game against the Mets. It was a good game. It moved along quickly and we won. I was surprised to see how many of my favorite players have been traded. I had a foot long hot dog and it was good. Saturday morning, I woke up early and Kiki (he chose the code name, not me) and I went swimming. David, his partner, joined us later and he taught me how to do turns at the end of the pool. I actually picked it up pretty well. Kiki has decided that Sophie Ellis-Bextor should sing theme song for the next Bond movie. For once, I have to agree with him. The concept is utter genius and it's the one time that I can actually say that I am jealous I did not think of it first. Afterward, we went to Starbucks with their neighbors and I had a mulit-grained bagel and passion fruit iced tea. Why do they call it passion fruit? I certainly didn't feel passionate after I drank it. I did laundry and met one of my clients to sign paperwork. I received three more leads over the weekend. Business keeps getting better and better. I'm beginning to make serious money and many people keep reminding me that it's okay. I work hard and I don't take adavntage of people. I think it's beginning to sink in. I met Jeff on the south side yesterday evening to see Spider-Man 2. All I wanted was an unsalted pretzel. I ordered it in addition to popcorn and a Coke for Jeff and a Diet Coke for me. After she has the popcorn and soft drinks, she informs me that they are out of pretzels. I suppose the pretzels on display are "stunt pretzels" and are not edible. She tells me to come back in fifteen minutes. I make my way to my seat and I have already missed part of the movie. I wait 30-minutes and head back, wait in line only to be informed that the pretzels are still not done. I know it's not the girl's fault, but all I wanted was a friggin' pretzel. I did not want a hot dog or nachos. I wanted a pretzel. I have already bought a $3 Diet Coke that is useless to me without the pretzel. I didn't go back because I could not in good conscience trample over the people at the end of the row again. The movie was good, but I cringed at the foreshadowing of the next movie's villain. I'm assuming they will probably have two villians. I thought Kirstin Dunst looked pretty running through New York City in her wedding dress. Afterwards, Jeff mentioned that he found the dialogue in three sections stilted and awkward. I, on the other hand, found those three sections to be written very well and had marveled over the writing and the performance. He had already made a condescending remark about my pretzel frustration and it just went down hill from there. It was like he was George W. and I was John Kerry. Jeff was on the computer for most of today shopping for a computer for the book store. He finally found one. We were supposed to go see Truth Or Dare at the drive-in as a fundraiser for urlLink Out On Film , but only a few of us showed up so we went to urlLink Front Page News for dinner instead. Afterwards, we went to Jake's for ice cream. I got a half scoop of two of my favorites: strawberry cheesecake; and chocolate leya cake. I haven't read any blogs over the weekend and just checked my e-mail. I received a very nice note from urlLink Jesse . It seems he printed out my screenplay from my portfolio website and read all of urlLink Millicent Meyers' Magnificient Murder Plan in one sitting. I know it's 137 pages, but the screenwriting format usese more paper than a novel so you're really not reading as much. I really appreciate his time and his feedback. I did make a quick post as a guest blogger for urlLink Ya Ya Empress while she's in Italy with Chris the Great. As a favor to me, keep urlLink Gregory in your thoughts tomorrow. His father is having heart surgery. Well, I did catch up on CNN.com for a moment, but now I'm off to bed. It's an early day tomorrow and I may not be able to blog again until tomorrow night. I wish you all well.
