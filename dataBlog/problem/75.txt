 So, I'm sitting in my office, looking out at this overheating car in the parking lot - looks like this guys radiator blew up or something - he'd just pulled into this spare urlLink parking space . Next thing you know the smoke starts getting urlLink thicker & urlLink thicker . Until pretty much the whole car is urlLink engulfed . So, as you could see in the previous picture, the urlLink fire department rolls up and gets some water on it. Here's what was urlLink left over . I went down afterwords to try and get a picture of the motor and the interior (which were completely scorched out - NOTHING left), but I felt a twang of conscience walking over with the camera. I'd asked permission to take the pictures you see here, but when I walked down the second time, I felt like a complete shit bag taking pictures of this kids car all burnt to a crisp. All I could bring myself to ask was, "What caused it" - apparently a fuel line. Guess I can no longer say "nothing fun happens to me" - b/c this was pretty damn random.

 Looks like as an "active blogger user" I'm eligible for a urlLink GMAIL account!! Something I've been tryin to get for MONTHS! effin SWEEEET! Thanks urlLink Blogger and urlLink Google ! Alright, all you bitches need to urlLink send me an email (!!), I gotta get some base info for my filter to start kickin in. I'm such.a.dork for being this excited about this. lol UPDATE: Holy god, the GUI is gonna take a little getting used to. I'm *really* diggin the ability of the program to "hide" or "unhide" the email history - it allows you to see the first line of an email, and then hide all the other bullshit. Conversation log example: I sent an email to my dad, then he responded, and I responded back again - the conversation log shows one message with a "(3)" next to it - so I can track back (in 1 place) all the messages with that subject header. The only weird thing is that it also tracks who last responded (being "ME") - so the way I'm used to reading email it looks like a sent file, as I have to look one person to the right to see who it was addressed to (I'm not sure that made any sense....). UPDATE #2: Oops. Ok, I fucked up, it doesnt track who the last two commenters were - it tracks the originator of the email, THEN the last commenter. Cool. I'm going to test this by sending an email to a list and have people comment to see how google treats the responses. Again, another thing to note is there is no "header" columns, like in Outlook (my normal email program). You cannot sort by date, topic, file size etc. The file size data sort is gonna be the one I'm going to miss - as I used that "sort by" every once in a while. More to come as I play with the application more.

 Yes folks, this is not a joke - urlLink he's protesting , which will, in turn draw more attention to his fucked up economic "policies" (if you can call them that). This literally had me laughing out loud.

 Not that we needed a graph to figure this out, but this map helps show YoY gains. Jesus. No wonder I'm gettin priced out of the market.

 Didn't intend for urlLink my comments to this post to be construed as a publicity stunt, but referrer logs don't lie. I'll see if I can get a post together at some point in my busy day to discuss what I feel defines a true "hero". FWIW I think this all comes down to the old liberal trick of bastardizing language ( urlLink case in point ) to justify means to an end. For, unfortunately, I look around me these days, and I don't see any hero's. Our ADD-ridden society is serverely deficient in the "conviction" department, and to this jaded 25 year old, hero's appear to be a thing of the past. Adding insult to injury, the more we try and seek hero's in our everday lives (to make ourselves feel better that we're not completely fucked) - the more we cheapen the concept and spiral further away from the essence of "heroism". More to come. I guess the best quick analogy I can come up with is the William Wallace example - the character Mel Gibson played in Braveheart. I think this is the first image that comes to peoples minds when they hear about the defiant Italian who was un-ceremoniously urlLink shot in the neck by human filth, the same murder Al Jazeera is touting as "too violent" for their animalistic audience. An interesting thing was happening in the comments section of Allah's post noted above - people started calling this courageous soul a hero . While that was also my initial gut reaction, I changed my mind when I started thinking about it. I empathize with the bandwagon jumpers - they want to make a martyr out of this man. Whether your motivation is to get angry at Muslims, or feel superior to them, or simply to feel SOMETHING about what happened - we should put those things aside if we're going to label one man, above all other comers a hero. What he did was defiant? Yes. Courageous? Yes. Noble? Very much so. Heart wrenching? Fuck yes. Heroic? No. I'd put forth the only argument that could be made that this man be recognized as a hero would be for his ability to view his situation with an unclouded mind, and recognize, with 100% clarity the extent of his situation and turn it into the absolute best thing possible. However, in my opinion, that earns my deep-seated respect (and it's not an outburst I'll likely forget for the rest of my life - for this certainly is one of those things we'll tell our grandkids), but not the exalted title of Hero. More after lunch, I need food.

 urlLink Russian Captives Freed in Baghdad Some weird shit appears to be going down in Iraq.

Pretty fucking stupid - however I guess it will weed out the weaker of the Coalition members - you know, see who'll cave at the slightest provocation.

 LMFAO - urlLink The Hornivore ! Don't ever marry, you're The Hornivore. Roaming, sexual, subhuman. The Hornivores (you) are some of the most screwed up and naughty beings in the Universe. And their numbers are growing, mostly due to skipped or misused contraception. You care not. There's one thing you want, one sole need. Half manly, half bestial, you act on instinct, and animal charisma smoothes the way. It's unlikelyyou're driven by much other than your own selfish, orgasmic requirements. Your appearance and personality have evolved for the hunt. Ass beckons, you oblige. For the record, you can happily bang all personality types, however your match percentages might be low with the kinder, more sensible people of the world, purely because they all wish to avoid you. Good luck to them.

 Well, not really, but I went out today with my boss and a buddy from Santa Monica. Was literally 5 minutes into the ride, when I tried bunny hopping and heard this giant *SLAM*. (Uh oh, that's not normal). Long story short, the shock acted like a fucking pogo-stick for the rest of the entire ride, and proceeded to both top and bottom out on each bump (doesn't make sense, I know). Net net net, I blew the damping cartridge in one of the fork legs. Oops.

 I thought it might be nice to remember what we're supposed to be urlLink celebrating .

 Oh look, urlLink Gore opens his mouth , once again. Does what he said surprise anyone.

One thing about Gore, he doesn't disappoint. And urlLink the GOP's response : Washington, DC—RNC Communications Director Jim Dyke issued the following statement today in response to a speech by former Vice President Al Gore attacking President Bush. “Al Gore served as Vice President of this country for eight years. During that time, Osama Bin Laden declared war on the United States five times and terrorists killed US citizens on at least four different occasions including the first bombing of the World Trade Center, the attacks on Khobar Towers, our embassies in East Africa, and the USS Cole.” “Al Gore’s attacks on the President today demonstrate that he either does not understand the threat of global terror, or he has amnesia.” Heh.

 So, this girl on myspace posts the following from Michael Moore: Monday, March 17, 2003 A Letter from Michael Moore to George W. Bush on the Eve of War George W. Bush 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Washington, DC Dear Governor Bush: So today is what you call "the moment of truth," the day that "France and the rest of world have to show their cards on the table." I'm glad to hear that this day has finally arrived. Because, I gotta tell ya, having survived 440 days of your lying and conniving, I wasn't sure if I could take much more. So I'm glad to hear that today is Truth Day, 'cause I got a few truths I would like to share with you: 1. There is virtually NO ONE in America (talk radio nutters and Fox News aside) who is gung-ho to go to war. Trust me on this one. Walk out of the White House and on to any street in America and try to find five people who are PASSIONATE about wanting to kill Iraqis. YOU WON'T FIND THEM! Why? 'Cause NO Iraqis have ever come here and killed any of us! No Iraqi has even threatened to do that. You see, this is how we average Americans think: If a certain so-and-so is not perceived as a threat to our lives, then, believe it or not, we don't want to kill him! Funny how that works! 2. The majority of Americans -- the ones who never elected you -- are not fooled by your weapons of mass distraction. We know what the real issues are that affect our daily lives -- and none of them begin with I or end in Q. Here's what threatens us: two and a half million jobs lost since you took office, the stock market having become a cruel joke, no one knowing if their retirement funds are going to be there, gas now costs almost two dollars -- the list goes on and on. Bombing Iraq will not make any of this go away. Only you need to go away for things to improve. 3. As Bill Maher said last week, how bad do you have to suck to lose a popularity contest with Saddam Hussein? The whole world is against you, Mr. Bush. Count your fellow Americans among them. 4. The Pope has said this war is wrong, that it is a SIN. The Pope! But even worse, the Dixie Chicks have now come out against you! How bad does it have to get before you realize that you are an army of one on this war? Of course, this is a war you personally won't have to fight. Just like when you went AWOL while the poor were shipped to Vietnam in your place. 5. Of the 535 members of Congress, only ONE (Sen. Johnson of South Dakota) has an enlisted son or daughter in the armed forces! If you really want to stand up for America, please send your twin daughters over to Kuwait right now and let them don their chemical warfare suits. And let's see every member of Congress with a child of military age also sacrifice their kids for this war effort. What's that you say? You don't THINK so? Well, hey, guess what -- we don't think so either! 6. Finally, we love France. Yes, they have pulled some royal screw-ups. Yes, some of them can be pretty damn annoying. But have you forgotten we wouldn't even have this country known as America if it weren't for the French? That it was their help in the Revolutionary War that won it for us? That our greatest thinkers and founding fathers -- Thomas Jefferson, Ben Franklin, etc. -- spent many years in Paris where they refined the concepts that lead to our Declaration of Independence and our Constitution? That it was France who gave us our Statue of Liberty, a Frenchman who built the Chevrolet, and a pair of French brothers who invented the movies? And now they are doing what only a good friend can do -- tell you the truth about yourself, straight, no b.s. Quit pissing on the French and thank them for getting it right for once. You know, you really should have traveled more (like once) before you took over. Your ignorance of the world has not only made you look stupid, it has painted you into a corner you can't get out of. Well, cheer up -- there IS good news. If you do go through with this war, more than likely it will be over soon because I'm guessing there aren't a lot of Iraqis willing to lay down their lives to protect Saddam Hussein. After you "win" the war, you will enjoy a huge bump in the popularity polls as everyone loves a winner -- and who doesn't like to see a good %@!$&-whoopin' every now and then (especially when it 's some third world %@!$&!). So try your best to ride this victory all the way to next year's election. Of course, that's still a long ways away, so we'll all get to have a good hardy-har-har while we watch the economy sink even further down the toilet! But, hey, who knows -- maybe you'll find Osama a few days before the election! See, start thinking like THAT! Keep hope alive! Kill Iraqis -- they got our oil!! Yours, Michael Moore To which I responded: Sorry, but Michael Moore is a urlLink fat, smelly, douche bag To whit she responded: ok, so why don't you like m.m.? I think the guy tells it how it is most of the time. Did you know disney is censoring his movie? How do you think this reflects on our rights? You prolly like Bush too don't you? Just curious to know what you think And my response? urlLink Censored ? Sorry babe. His "stunt" aside, Disney is not a governmental organization. They have every right to NOT pay Michael Moore for his movies. Just like you have every right not to watch it. Disney, acting in their own best interest, decided that they would not *distribute* the movie (which they've now gone back on I might add). Technically, Miramax funded the movie, Disney owns Miramax - that's the extent of the relationship. Disney doesn't have Moore tied up in some backroom, or have a gun to his head telling him what to (and what not to) say. If Miramax, or Michael Moore, for example, wanted to distribute the movie on their own dime, no one is stopping them. Moore's a multi-multi-multi millionaire. If he wanted to get it done, he could. Think Mel Gibson and The Passion of the Christ - worked good for him, right? In any case, all I'm sayin is do your homework if you're gonna come back with a retort. Or, you could just swallow every hunk that fat fucktard spews out for your consumption without questioning a word of what he says - despite the fact that he admits he goofs on his sheeple (see link above). BTW, what I *think* or how I *feel* has nothing to do with Mr. Moore being a big fat liar. THAT is a fact. ;) Stupid Bitch:0 Fat Kid:1

 Better urlLink jump on this one before someone snatches it up. I wonder if any blogad advertisers would be interested in sponsoring the site? What motivated this you ask? Some stupid whore on urlLink Myspace posted something I'd expect from a stupid whore, that letter urlLink fat bastard wrote to President Bush back in 2003.

 When's the last time you saw an American Congressman pull a urlLink stunt like this b/c some agricultural subsidy was veto'd. Answer: Never. However, with urlLink the way our political climate is shaping up it wouldn't surprise me in the least to see more and more people getting all fired up like this guy. What I'd really like to see if Michael Moore threaten to commit suicide if Bush is re-elected, and follow through when Bush wins.

 For those of you who didn't already know, I ride a motorcycle, an R6 specifically.

I avoid doing shit like that for a number of reasons: 1) I'm not that coordinated, 2) I have this fear of falling off and getting run over by a car (call me a pussy if you must) and 3) it's just stupid. However, I can let some of that stuff pass b/c those guys aren't endgangering (for the most part) other people. Odds are if they fall off in traffic, they're not going to hurt the driver who runs them over. urlLink This guy OTOH, should be tarred and feathered . What an effing retard.

 urlLink All of it . So they found a sarin shell? Eh. Halliburton put it there, it was old, and besides everyone knew Saddam had WMD, and we gave him the sarin anyway, and it would be news if we found 400 shells, but if they were old undeclared shells they wouldn’t count because they weren’t a threat to us anyway – do you know that most of the 9/11 hijackers were Saudi? Why aren’t we invading them? Not that we should, that would TOTALLY be about oil, anyway , did you read Doonesbury today? He had this giant hand talking in a press conference. This big giant floating hand. I think it was a reprint. I like when he has that bald dude who’s in charge of some Iraqi city. Bald dude is like, wasted. The story of the prison abuse might have had a different impact if the media had chosen a different tack. The only news that hits the front page is bad news; the innumerable small fragments of good news don’t make A1 because papers have their standards, you see. We are expected to repair Iraq’s dilapidated electrical grid, so replacing an old generator and turning on the power to a neighborhood that’s had brown-outs for ten years is not news. Two Marines dead in an ambush is news because A) death leads, and B) that “mission accomplished” aircraft carrier photo op needs to be debunked, however subtly, as often as possible. The media has come to believe that reporting more good than bad somehow makes them suspect; it goes contrary to The Mission, which is to find out what’s wrong.

 File this one under, "I've said it before, and I'll say it again" - urlLink Rachel Lucas RULES !! UPDATE: Haha! urlLink Lagmonkey comes through with urlLink a quality photoshop . Awesome !

 First off, let me just say that I love Jeff Jarvis, however his continued urlLink shameless promotion of Iraqi bloggers kind of weirds me out. Dunno why, it just seems like every time I check his blog, he's got some new post trying to get Iraqi bloggers picked up by mainstream news sources. I thought what they were doing was present themselves as an ALTERNATIVE to mainstream media. Having them on the payrolls of these organizations (IMO) would probably compromise their objectivity. Even if it's not explicit, the editors desk will provide for an implicit censor - not what these guys need, or us even for that matter.

 No posts on this (usually) hyperactive blog urlLink since 5/11 . A few options cross my mind: 1) Allah finally found a job 2) Allah just isn't finding urlLink today's news satire-worthy anymore. 3) There's some political significance ( urlLink # of days , etc) to the 5/11 that I don't get. Either way, sucks if the site just goes down with no "final post" or something.

 urlLink Chimaira urlLink As I Lay Dying urlLink Maroon 5 Yeah, not too confused, right?

 urlLink www.AndrewSullivan.com - "Faked" op-ed. So far in the Iraq war battle, two major anti-war media outlets, the BBC and the Mirror, have been rocked. Tony Blair is still in office. I've said it before, and it's worth repeating. It really is stupid to be passing such quick judgement on our progress in Iraq, people don't just say "Hindsight is 20/20" for the fuck of it. Only in the coming 20, 30, 40 or even 50 years will we see the true ramifications of what we've done here. My stance on the war is that, within those timelines our actions will be seen as a major positive. Compound that with the stance of the anti-war left, with their nanosecond by nanosecond attention span (or lack thereof), and it becomes clear to see what it is that frustrates me so much with them.

 Came across this urlLink Saleen S7 just cruisin up the 5, about 60 mph. Welcome to SoCal.

 urlLink "Nope, no fire here, just keeeeeeeeeep walkin..." urlLink This is another one of those things that kid on the R6MN rails against. Claims it simply doesn't exist, or if it does, it's all right-wing religious fundy propaganda. I have no idea what he'd say about this example for a few reasons: 1) I'm banned and 2) he refuses to read any link I've ever posted. 3) even if he did read it, there is no way in FUCK he would ever respond, b/c there's nothing for him to say, so, the classic 3rd grade approach to debate ensues....sling an insult and hope to change the topic. LOL 4) he might not even know about it, given the urlLink lack of coverage by "big media" as noted by Glenn Reynolds. Like a worn paperback baby.... *sighs* Funny thing is, today has actually been a super relaxing day. I haven't had to read any stupid bullshit from asshatted liberals, I've done my job, the day is nearing an end. Oh yeah, and no (true) religious fanatics have urlLink cut the heads off of US civilians . And, btw, am I the ONLY person in the world who finds it disgusting how his father is trying to urlLink politicize this whole thing ? Have some respect for the dead, even if you disagree with the motivations for your son's actions, you can at the very least respect his memory by shutting the fuck up. I'll tell you what though, it sure is nice to be getting IM's and emails from my friends on the R6 board, talking about how bullshit my banning is. I guess one of them is going to make a banner, "Save Triguy" or something like that, which a few of them are going to use as their "sig banners" in protest. Heh. Nice to know the whole world isn't going to shit, thanks guys.

 urlLink Luna took my cherry, urlLink Eli got sloppy seconds, and urlLink Celo 's waitin for dirty thirds. :P Apparently the R6MN didn't like my innovative approach of limiting my political debates to my blog. So, I've been banned . Found out this morning when I went to check a private message urlLink one of the mod's had sent me, when "voila" no more board access. Logged out, and checked a few of my posts, only to see "banned" written under my name. I feel like a fuckin leper. LOL. Ob la dee ob la da life goes on bro, naaa na na na life goes on. So, the least I can do is solicit ideas for new "titles" for me when/if I go back to the board. I was thinkin something along the lines of: "Scapegoat" "Pariah" "BANNED" "Oppressed" "Lazarus" "On thin ice" or "DMZ" or something. Leave your suggestions in the comments box!

 "I don't read the newspapers." Classic.

 Yeah, urlLink holy SHIT . And did you SEE his camel toe? ROFLMAO Props to pooponastick for diggin this one up.

 This one about his urlLink internal conflict , and his wife's impression of his reaction to the Abu Grahib prison scandal. And the money quote: "I've been reading a book about the Civil War and Ulysses Grant — and I'm not going to compare the two, don't get me wrong, and don't anybody rush off and say he doesn't get the difference between Iraq and the Civil War," Mr. Rumsfeld said. "The fact of the matter is, the casualties were high, the same kinds of concerns that we're expressing here were expressed then." The people then, Mr. Rumsfeld said, "were despairing, they were hopeful, they were concerned, they were combative." But in the end, he concluded, "the carnage was horrendous, and it was worth it ." It will be a sad sad sad day in American history the day Donald Rumsfeld is forced from office due to partisan bickering.

 So, in case anyone is wondering wtf this post is about, I'm about || 1) Not piss off the moderators with my political rants, which usually denigrate my witting victim 2) Direct some more traffic here - our political insult-fests (on average) get more hits/posts than anything in those sections. 3) Have the new traffic allow me to get some BlogAds, which should contribute about $.50 every 6-months to my beer fund.

 And maybe this can help explain how furious I get when a liberal opens their stupid ass retarded mouth, some choice quotes from the R6MessageNet - a motorcycle messageboard I frequent: This first one's about the Marine who recently received the Navy Cross, that nobody heard about on the news: I read the citation above in the story and just wondered if the guy runs for president as a democrat in 30 years or so, will the citation be questioned along with whether he really did kill as many enemy as suggested, etc. Quote: That's definitely a nice change... But alas, the American News Media only tells us what they want us to hear, and apparently True Acts of Heroism aren't "News" to those who provide it. Well maybe the next time one of you retards wants to blame the "liberal media" () you should realize that bad news sells newspapers, not sappy crap. Who wants to see 30 stories of schools being rebuilt*, and see nothing but pictures of smiling Iraqi kids? Fundies and people so slanted that thats what theyre seeing anyway, thats who. Its called human nature, folks. And FYI, spin goes both ways. * - rebuilt, not built. Think of the difference. Again, just some bullshit from two hippies in CO, both are disgruntled tech employees who're feeling rather inadequate I'd guess. If you feel like checking out the source doc's for these posts, they're as follows: urlLink Post 1 . urlLink Post 2 . Oh yeah, and if you were curious, this guy (quote #2), should have been aborted. That's how highly I think of him. lol EDIT: OK, maybe not aborted, that's not really fair. LOL

 Even if you don't like cats, urlLink this is just fucked up . (but funny)

 $5 says urlLink this guy is probably one of the nicest guy's you could ever meet in person, but holy sweet jesus, can you imagine the carnage ? Brings new meaning to that old Marine joke: Have you heard the joke about the Marine who was in Iraq? He was below a sand dune, a very high sand dune. And he yelled over that sand dune, "One Marine is worth 10 Iraqi soldiers." The commander on the other side of the hill said, "I need 10 volunteers." Ten volunteers, they went over the dune. Yelling and screaming and smoke and gun fire and then silence. The voice came again, "One Marine is worth 50 Iraqi soldiers." The commander sent 50 soldiers. Went over the dune and the same thing, yelling, screaming, smoke, fire, gunshots and then silence. The voice came again. "Ha. One Marine is worth 100 Iraqi soldiers." Again the commander asked for 100 soldiers. A hundred soldiers went over the dune. Yelling screaming, firing, gunshots. Then silence. Then the voice came again. "One Marine is worth 1,000 Iraqi soldiers." The commander asked for 1,000 soldiers. They went over the dune. Yelling, screaming, gunfire, shots. But this time, one Iraqi soldier, his arm badly wounded, holding it against his side, his leg badly limping, came up over the dune. And he said to his commander, "Don't send any more soldiers. He lied. There's two of them." Makes you wonder if urlLink al Sadr heard the joke. Heh. UPDATE: I don't suppose we'll be hearing a damn thing out of urlLink Ted Rall , you know, b/c this guy's still alive.

 Expect daily changes to this thing - the one part I'm really bummed about is how "skinny" the text portion is - however if you take a peek at the code you'll see how each "layer" has been individually sized, which means (as far as I can tell) each box needs to individually be re-sized (oof). That is something I have neither the time, talent or desire to accomplish, so unless one of you urlLink turkey's feels like havin a go at it, it's not gonna change any time soon. EDIT: I'm also having problems "deleting" comments - which the new blogger comment service supposedly allows me to do. I'd made two comments to the previous post (as you can see), and I'd subsequently bah-leted both of them. Curious that they're still there, eh? In any case, I'll try and figure that out tomorrow at work, hehe. Until then, try out the comment service if you would. urlLink Libbo has already given it a go and was urlLink scared by the log in procedure. :/ I was led to believe it's a one-time thing as you have the option for the service to "remember you" - so, I'll have to check that out from a different IP addy to confirm though. Well, again, feedback is appreciated, just don't tell me it sucks. Heh.

 urlLink Nader Misses Texas Ballot Requirement, Sues . Need I say any more? Honestly.

 This via: urlLink The Federalist In his latest election-year stunt to undermine the Bush administration -- and our national resolve to finish the job in Iraq -- John Kerry has launched a petition calling for the resignation of Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. Kerry claims that Secretary Rumsfeld should be held personally responsible for the actions of a few soldiers in Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison who humiliated a group of the captive terrorists in their search for "actionable intelligence." This is the same John F. Kerry, by the way, who has alternately employed claims of his Vietnam wartime heroism and wartime criminality to catapult himself into the highest echelons of public life over the past three decades. Kerry's irrational call for Rumsfeld's resignation, harkening back to his days as a Vietnam War protestor, is anything but out of the ordinary for the "gentleman from Massachusetts". Kerry claims his petition received about 250,000 signatures. Act now to refute this political folly and support Secretary Rumsfeld. Today, PatriotPetitions.US, the nation's leading public opinion advocate for U.S. national security and sovereignty, has released its newest campaign entreating the President and Congress to support Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. Please register your support for Secretary Rumsfeld. Let your voice be heard! Please join fellow Patriots on the front lines in defense of our liberty and national sovereignty.

 Some key excerpts from the WaPo article from earlier today: The rally lacked the star power, and certainly the numbers, of the first Million Mom March in 2000, when hundreds of thousands of women flooded the Mall on Mother's Day. Organizers this time put the crowd at close to 3,000, a figure that could not be confirmed because police no longer estimate crowd sizes. And another gem: Assault weapons are "made for violence," Rep. James P. Moran Jr. (D-Va.) told the crowd. "They're made for causing catastrophes. They ought to be illegal."

 urlLink Google Search: smashed testes . Oh yeah baby, oh yeeeeeeeeaaahh.

 So, I was watching the season finale of " urlLink All Star Survivor " last night with the roommates, and somewhere between glass of wine #4, 6 and beer # something, I decided it was a good idea to call the boss and tell him I was going to be coming in around noon today. Apparently I left a nice rambling drunken message wishing my boss, Tony, a happy mothers day. Tony's a guy, urlLink flaming , but a guy. Fortunately, he got a kick out of it, and I still have a job. I did however, miss his birthday luncheon due to my hangover. Oops. And, for those of you coming in from Lagmonkey, I'll apologize now for the lack of "hot chick" pictures, I kept a relatively low profile this weekend - however I'm going to see if I can get some pics from my buddy Aaron of the club we went to Saturday night. I spent most of the weekend helping a buddy move into a new house, which I'll also post pictures of as soon as I go and take some (heh). All I gotta say about the house is $3.5 million with a $500,000+ renovation budget. O.M.F.G.

 This is COMPLETELY blowing up, I see no less than 15 articles on drudge referring to this crap today. I can see this getting very ugly, very fast as people have time to disseminate what just happened. What bugs me is the initial reaction I've gotten from people calling for Rumsfelds resignation, as he's claimed responsibility. Last I checked, that was something you would expect of a real man (accepting responsibility), I think the last thing we want to do is can Rummy. Wait and see... UPDATE: urlLink Cool review of the proceedings here , from a decidedly "anti-Kerry" standpoint. BTW, I've just found a new favorite website. lol

 Well, that's what you'd need if you ever wanted a liberal to utter anything akin to urlLink Rumsfelds' statement to the Senate Armed Services Committee this morning. “These events occurred on my watch. As Secretary of Defence I am accountable for them. I take full responsibility,” Rumsfeld told the Senate Armed Services Committee in Washington. Now that, folks, is a man .

 urlLink T-Shirt Hell , found via urlLink Lagmonkey . A sample of their wares you ask? A little urlLink Friends bashing to end the week.

 Good luck getting urlLink Disney to finance your next mockumentary you urlLink shitbag .

 OOOOOHHHHHHH! Looks like urlLink lagmonk ey is situated right near the heart of this thing. This is the event that all the socialist mothers from our Bethesda platform have been promoting through our WORK email system for WEEKS now. Libbo, I'm gonna have to compile these emails and send you them - I actually complained to HR about having to receive political BS at work, and they basically told me to STFU!!!!!!! I decided that if I were going to fight it, I'd most likely get fired. Bunch 'a anal warts.

 urlLink She's back ! Most excellent news of the day I proclaim!

 Firstly, let me say that Michael Moore is a waste of oxygen who needs to have his breathing-privileges permanently fuckin' revoked for constantly churning-out 4-plus-hour pieces of self-indulgent garbage and allowing hoardes of mindless bastards with room-temperature IQs to call him "visionary" and "gifted" and all the other fuckin' mindless platitudes they reserve for only the most TALENTLESS cunts in the Director-game nowadays! Michael Moore suffers from a sadly non-fatal disease called A.N.T.S (Absolutely No Talent Syndrome) and watching his movies is less stimulating than intravenous valium and almost as unpleasant as watching naked 70-year-old homosexuals fuck. That having been said, it would be a good idea if his next movie was entitled "The decapitation and disembowelment of Michael Moore: Death Of A Talentless Cunt Thanks to Mango for bringin this to my attention!!

 Found via urlLink Drudge over at the urlLink Cincinnati Enquirer . Some urlLink more evidence that Bush is, in fact, Hitler.

 Some urlLink more insight into this Ted Rall cartoon fiasco: "Ted Rall's cartoons could have run in every paper every day since 9/11 and there will still be kids who saw Tillman's choice as a remarkable act. (Tillman's Choice: there's a phrase that sums up quite a lot, doesn't it?) People like Rall are sitting on the curb, feet in the gutter, watching the parade go past, smirking at the guy with the baton, sneering at the cheerleaders. Everyone else watching the parade thinks I wonder if there will be elephants! And when they do appear, he rolls his eyes. Elephants. How obvious. You want to live like that? I don't want to live like that. Because when you see red all the time you miss things. My favorite panel of the cartoon had Tillman signing up and asking "Do I get to go kill Arabs." Of course Rall knows that it's not literally true, but it's true in some metaphysical sense, which makes it truer than reality itself. And it's a bitter joke, don't you know, because that's the unspoken subtext, isn't it? " Damn. This guy's good. What makes this especially good is he's touched on something that I see in myself: ...when you see red all the time you miss things. Life goes by too fast to miss things.

 In today's day and age with the internet permeating our lives, we are exposed to some pretty shocking shit - whether it be goatse or tubgirl, or just some crazy stuff going on around the world, we get it from all sides. That being said, I just received two of *the* most fucked up vid links EVER. So, consider that fair warning if you're sitting at work reading this entry. These are just plain old jacked. I honestly have no idea how to respond to them, I just kinda sat here and stared, first thing coming to mind was "This is SO not cool I'm looking at these at work". urlLink Vid one . And the even more disturbing (if that's possible) urlLink vid two . And, FYI, there will be no Office Space stapler jokes, thank you very much.

 urlLink Bloggers rejoice ! Hopefully this is the first (of many) articles the WSJ will not hide behind their "registration wall". Only good things will come out of this, more attention to the WSJ as they are an excellent news source, and bloggers will be more than happy to reference them. As it appears they're already selling blog ads, the more click-through traffic they get, the better their income producing potential is from their ads. In any case, I'm droppin a referral link in here simply b/c it's positive reinforcement - so, click it please let's show the WSJ some love . :)

 A great review/op-ed discussing the urlLink plusses and minuses and politics behind Googles newborn Gmail service. Those of you who read my blog know that I've had my gmail account for a couple weeks now, and love the thing. Traffic to the account has been very limited as I'm wary about posting my account to too many bbs or blog comments sections, as those are typically the ways spammers get my 411. That my gmail account name is my actual name, makes me even more wary. In any case, if any of you have been presented with the opportunity for a gmail account, but have been stymied by State Senator Liz Figueroa's (admit it, you knew you were gonna see a "D" next to her name) urlLink demonization of the program, I really suggest you have a look-see at this article - it really lays it out for you.

 One more example of George Bush's fictional "Presidency" being a miserable failure. Just today George Bush personally urlLink raised interest rates one full quarter point . His unilateral reckless approach to raising interest rates has, in effect, kicked over 10,000,000,000 people out of homes they were only able to afford by obtaining interest only adjustable rate, no cap mortgages. These working middle-class tax-paying citizens will soon be living out on the street, urlLink what good will the tax cuts for the rich do for them then , huh urlLink Hitler ? Huh! In addition, the increased interest rates will serve as a dis-incentive for business to invest in capital items, in turn plunging the economy futher into a quagmire. Editors note: The opposite statement (lower interest rates produce jobs, in effect) does not hold true, that is, if it serves to improve Bush's ratings. Of course.

Seriously though, you've gotta wonder if John Kerry throws Dean-esque tantrums when he reads urlLink news like this . I can just picture him yelling FUCK!!! as loud as he can, then start bawling un-controllably. It's shit like this (economic news) that makes me happy again. There is simply no fucking possible way the media can spin a net gain of ONE FUCKING MILLION JOBS IN THREE FUCKING MONTHS . You just can't do it. Then again, you can ignore it... let's see what the media's response is.... .... .... just checked CNN, nothing. Top headline? "Cassini Races towards Saturn orbit" and another headline by Howard Stern (in Michael Moore fashion) who's quoted saying " urlLink I criticize Bush, then I'm fired ". Hah. I wonder if that recently employed bloc of about ONE MILLION PEOPLE are gonna vote for Bush, given it's HIS FUCKING ECONOMIC POLICIES that got them jobs. I doubt it.

 The Middle East is the urlLink asshole of the world . Proof positive. Thanks Goat!

 urlLink Coward . I can't empathize, but I can sympathize with this man (I use this term loosely). For this "man's" reaction to his son's death has brought dishonor to the memory of his son, and what his son went to Iraq for. For this man to so vehemently attack the administration for his sons death is projection pure and simple, and he lends credibility (and tacit support) to the his sons true killers (Zaraquai). I honestly have no other words to describe his lack of composure. UPDATE : Somebody show Mr. Berg urlLink this fucking video .

 In searching for a definition of "Pax Americana" I came across urlLink this entry over at disinfopedia. The line that cracked me up strikes straight at the heart of the pacifists/peace-niks/nay-sayers etc: "Kagan is more blunt: 'People worry a lot about how the Arab street is going to react,' he notes. 'Well, I see that the Arab street has gotten very, very quiet since we started blowing things up.'" Heh.

 urlLink Ace of Spades HQ: CBS/NYTimes Poll: Bush's Approval Rating Now at Negative Sixty-Six Bazillion I wonder if mainstream media is setting up a situation (potentially inadvertently) whereby everyone in the US is under the impression it's gonna be a close race, then when Kerry loses (as he will) one half of America will get pissed off b/c it goes against everything they've been seeing on the TV/reading in the newspaper. Hmmm. OK, yeah, I should take off my tinfoil hat - I'm startin to sound like Michael Moore. No, I don't honestly believe they're (the media) going out of their way to stage something like that, I do believe it's a potential outcome. God help us all if we have another close Presidential race where the Supreme Court has to come in and be the deciding factor. urlLink Jeff Jarvis follows up and labels it "extremism". Again, with the fad (see my comments over at the urlLink Young Curmodgeon ). Ever see "extreme toothpaste" or "extreme deoderant"? Well, now we've got "extreme politics". Not so "heh".

 I'd posted this "bulletin" (below) in response to one whore who just kept posting "GO SEE F911" like 50 times a day. Then, one of my friends wrote me the response (at the top), basically calling me an idiot. Nice (but wrong). I disagree--the movie is brilliant. Perhaps a bit too in your face with Moore's opinion--but any adult with half a brain can take the facts from the speculation--we do this every day when we watch the news. Either way--your bulletin entry is silly--and I am telling everyone I know regardless of their party affiliation to go see the film. Until you do--you know nothing about it, or the brilliance of the documentary itself. I don't care if it doesn't change your mind about the President--but you can't make an educated decision either way until you have seen the film. ----------------- Bulletin Message ----------------- From: Fat Kid Date: Jun 28, 2004 05:25 PM via - Ed Koch (read bio here) speaks out against MM's newest mockumentary over at World Tribune.com. Money quote: The movie's diatribes, sometimes amusing and sometimes manifestly unfair, will not change any views. They will simply cheapen the national debate and reinforce the opinions on both sides. The question it leaves, is, where do we go from here? Like MM himself says, "Do something", maybe it's time for us to simply rise above the shit-flinging and actually initiate civil dialogue beyond the scope of the "Bush = Hitler", "But, but, but....Halliburton!!" and "No blood for oil" screeds... Food for thought.

 Realizing that I just spent way to much time putting together a list of links, de-bunking MM's political fiction movie released this weekend, to not share it with you. So, this is basically a link dump of some of the articles I've read about the movie. As always, I've attempted to remove the personal (fat/stupid/lazy/smelly/slovenly) attacks against Moore, b/c they don't really serve my purpose, but know they constituted about half of what I read. LOL Caveat Emptor : The coup de grace: urlLink Slate Excellent read: urlLink Jarvis Various support documentation: urlLink Sun Times urlLink NY Times urlLink Jarvis urlLink IMAO urlLink Jewish World Review urlLink NY Times urlLink LGF urlLink Allah urlLink NY Times urlLink Moore Lies urlLink Jobless Lawyer urlLink Troester urlLink Sisu urlLink Kottke urlLink Samizdata urlLink Reason urlLink Sully "Fahrenheit Tedium" post urlLink Roger Simon And finally, the infamous urlLink Moore Watch (which appear to be down). I'm sure the release of F911 has absolutely NOTHING to do with this "catastrophic database failure". Nothing what.so.ever. Go urlLink back to sleep .

 This just in from the French Reuters: urlLink Terrorists = Activists . Oh. Someone tell Daniel Pearl's wife, or how about Nick Berg's family or how about Paul Johnson's family? I'm positive any one of the 3,000+ families DIRECTLY affected by the 9/11 suicide attacks wouldn't spit in your face for saying that. Way to hit bottom and keep digging Reuters.

 Time to urlLink award amnesty and change tactics. So, why don't all you guys just come on home, we'll guarantee your safety, we'll rethink this plan of how to fuck some American's, then we'll re-release you to sow havoc.

 Yes, urlLink Libbo , I know I haven't gotten my shit together to get my t-shirt model thing going (you goat), but thanks for rubbing it in. However, when I do, urlLink Frank J. over at urlLink IMAO.us is going down, or at the very least, urlLink his t-shirt babe is. Either way, it should end up in gratuitous traffic for me. Muahahahah . :P Sidenote: Why do I feel like a bastard for having a "model-off" with Frank? Let's give a run down of the problems I've been having so far: 1) No time 2) No time 3) No shirt(s) 4) No time 4.5) See sidenote above um 5) No time? Did I mention that yet? In all honesty, I've been pretty stressed out/slammed at work, and just about the only thing I feel like doing when I come home it sitting down, having a beer and not thinking about my day. Having to hassle with extra-curricular items (beyond going to the gym for stress relief) has more or less been beyond me these last few weeks. I'm sure my roommate can post up to that effect. :( I do honestly have two models - well, they've both expressed interest, and they're both paid models, so I guess they count as "models", right? J and T, mind if I link some pics of you guys up there so Libbo can see I'm not a straight-up liar, and that I do actually know hot girls? Post up in the comments or drop me an IM if it's cool. So, in any case, I need to place an order (tonight/tomorrow) for urlLink one of my own damn t-shirts , or a few of them as the case may be and get ahold of these girls for hopefully this weekend. I still have no idea how I'm gonna get someone to model urlLink the thong . Maybe you tramps will get lucky, I'll have about 18 too many beers, and a camera will pop up... Hmmmmm.... the fat kid in a thong, shudder to think. In the meantime, I'll show you the urlLink most recent addition to my t-shirt collection . ... and my gun. urlLink

 "We're just workin till the day we decide we've had enough" -Against Me! "Jordan's first choice" Against Me! is a super-liberal punk band that I kind of put up with b/c I like their energy, the guys voice is pretty cool, and they make fun of liberals (they're anarchists). Dunno why stuff like this has been resonating with me lately.

 Considering urlLink the source , I'm surprised that *wasn't* the headline. Regardless, a bunch of chickens are dead, and it's all Bushs' fault. Or something. Thanks urlLink Drudge .

 Seems like there's a lot of urlLink animosity towards the press , and it's not a new phenomenon: "He then recounts a conversation with old friend Nicholas Katzenbach, then on the board of the Washington Post, telling him that he was 'ashamed of the paper's coverage on Whitewater.'" To put it in some perspective, I'll refer you to a Toby Keith song, "The Critic": Tell it like it is He gets up real early on his mornin' drive Down to the office for his 9 to 5 He drives a 94' two tone economy car Loves to tell the local bands down at the bar That he's the critic, yeah I can hook you up I know everybody in the business He flunked junior high band he couldn't march in time He tried to write a song once, but he couldn't make it rhyme He learned 2 or 3 chords on a pawn shop guitar He just never quite had what it took to be a star So he's a critic I work for the gazette man I got a real job He did a 5 star column on a band you never heard He did a bluegrass review without an unkind word He thought it was time to ask his boss for a raise His boss said I can't even tell if anybody's even readin' your page yeah So he thought and he thought a little more He caught a young hot star headed into town Then he hid behind his typewriter and gunned the boy down Here come the letters, the emails, the he faxes They raised him to 20 thousand dollars after taxes He's a happy critic yeah He's rollin' in the dough Man I could do this forever This is easy They're all readin' my column Please don't tell my mama That I write the music column for the gazette She still thinks, that I play piano down at the cathouse Emphasis mine.

 Have to get a whole bunch of stuff done before tomorrow, but: They're demo'ing walls. Loudly. I almost wish I could head over there and ask to take a few whacks with the 10 lb sledge. Talk about stress relief. I could even use urlLink Libbo's Michael Moore range target! Oh Joy! (Now if Libbo would only get his damn archives working, I could link you directly - so, urlLink here it is , as found in urlLink Rachel Lucas ' archives)

 urlLink BuzzMachine... by Jeff Jarvis "Horse. Barn. Gone." 'Nuff said. *shakes head in disgust* P and I were just talking about this last night. His question was more "Wonder what precipitated that?" (Safire's response). I thought that since Cheny (the second biggest dog on the block) was forced to come out and respond, that the White House was probably (and rightfully) pretty pissed off. However, as Jeff Jarvis points out, the retraction is moot. The damage has been done, and that headline is all most people will ever see/hear. They won't listen to the retraction, they won't listen to the Commissions refutation of that headline - all they read is the big bold lies letters on the cover of the New York Times.

 A bunch of these recently, first it was urlLink Andrew Sullivan ( urlLink see this post ) and now we've got a gentleman from urlLink the WSJ claiming Cheny should remove himself from the Bush/Cheny '04 ticket b/c of his ties to Halliburton. What's lame is this guy is masquerading as a fan of Cheny's and that Dick would be sacrificing himself in order to let Dubya win another term. Too bad Dick Cheny is one of Bushs' strongmen, losing him would be tantamount to cutting off both your thumbs. Well, I've got an open letter for the author of that article, and it goes something like this: Dear Mr. Gannon: Shut the fuck up. Sincerely, Fat Kid

 In your face . As it needs to be. Thanks P for making me realize this. Who would you rather be? -or- You know what. Fuck the 'rabs.

 Over at urlLink GapingVoid . Thanks to Jeff Jarvis over at urlLink BuzzMachine for pointing this out. Oh, and here's Geoffs first " urlLink submission ". ROFL. And yes, I fell out of my seat.

 Drudge has gone urlLink ape-shit . Holy God. I've never seen so many links on one page before.

 Anything to get Kerry elected urlLink it appears - from this article it looks like they're sellin the "nothing will change" line. Rrrrrrriiiiiiight.

 In 25-50 years when we round up and summarily shoot all the people who have totally fucked up our country over the past couple years, I swear to God people are going to look back at urlLink Michael Moore and MoveOn as two of the case-study examples of just how stupid people in our country can be in the pursuit of power. What a sneaky bastard. That's about as close as I can come to complimenting Michael Moore. Shudder to think. UPDATE: Moorewatch hits it urlLink on the head . Read.

 A friend just made his own urlLink 1911 . This isn't some kit gun, the guy actually machined a number of internal parts, namely: the frame rails, took off the front strap finger grove, the front sight dovetail, .250 beavertail cut, beveled magwell, blended the rear of the slide to the frame, checkered the back Sooo cool. Now, all we gotta do is get out to the outdoor "range" to try that puppy out ... oh yeah, and his .50. ;)

 urlLink BuzzMachine... by Jeff Jarvis And the coolest comment from the thread? Please. He did what he did because that's what served him the best. He's a narcissistic, loud-mouthed publicity whore who's made a career out of creating 90-minute multiplex fixes for bourgeois desperate to have Important Opinions. Ex-actly.

 This from our Olympic hopeful - total stud on the team, turned professional maybe two and a half years ago, guy about my age, and our team has sponsored him through various fund raisers so he's been able to travel all around the world for various events. We call him "The Terminator". Total.fucking.animal. +++++++++++ first, i'd like to send out a hearty thanks to all who have taken an interest and supported me this year in my build up to olympic trials. it was an honor to race at an event of such magnitude and i'm thrilled i was able to represent team psycho this weekend. in the two weeks leading up to the race, and in the race itself, things went either very well, or very badly. i capped an intense training build up the week prior to the race with a PR at the Harpoon 5 miler (good), only to suffer a recurrance the next day of the lung inflammation i've been dealing with (bad). i felt that a week of recovery would be enough to overcome this setback but found that on race morning i was still having lung troubles. it was difficult to dwell on the negative though b/c i had made it despite all of the setbacks i've been dealt this year. only 15 men started, and of those there were 10 americans, 4 kiwis, and 1 brazilian. each of us were individually introduced and called out onto the pontoon through a narrow gateway. the race coverage was intense, with a helicopter above us for the entire race, and underwater divers fliming us during the swim. a minute of so into the swim my lungs started to tighten up. i couldn't find my top end, had to settle for a choppy tempo, and i exited the water almost two minutes down on the rest of the field. (results are at triathlon.org) the first two laps of the bike were also a struggle, but i started to find a rhythm about 20 minutes in. the crowd on the one huge climb of the day (a 3 min. climb were i used my 28 rear cog each time up) was in my face the whole time, and i couldn't help but think that this was the closest thing to riding up a col in the tour de france that i would ever experience. on lap five i finally closed the gap to the chase group up the road. this is where my race suddenly went from very bad to very good. riding solo is not a good use of energy in a draft legal race so i made good use of the draft for the final lap and came into transition slightly recovered. i ran as hard as i could knowing that i had crawled my way back into the race, and i finished 8th overall, 5th american. i don't generally spend too much time digesting my races philosophically. but this race has so far resonated with me like no other. i've had, by most accounts, a disasterous early 2004 season. i missed two early season races, olympic trials in honolulu, and countless training sessions dealing with health issues. i mananged to requalify for trials, and i finally put together two weeks of consistent training, only to suffer yet another setback the week leading up to the race in bellingham. and in ITU races when you're almost two minutes back exiting the water, your race almost always over. but i did not give up earlier this year, and i did not give up on sunday. i'd like to take the credit for doing all the work on race day, but the truth is that racing for a team that has so graciously supported me these past two years really does put wind in your sails when it seems all is lost. and when you represent a group of people dedicated to getting the most out of triathlon, quitting is just not option. the reservoir of psycho karma has grown larger each year, and i'd like to think that i tapped into that source on a day when the tank was empty.

 urlLink Ratings row over Moore Iraq film Anyone have statistics about how much *less* money R-rated films make? I don't remember them off the top of my head, but I know it's significant. An R-rating severely restricts your audience, and of course Moore is pushing to get a PG-13 ranking, so he can shock the shit out of his viewers. Also, don't you just love how he mentions recruiting in the same sentence as 15 and 16-year olds - brilliant propaganda. *shakes head*

 Till the (hopefully) party of the year. Black tie affair, house-warming party, overlooking the water - this should be prime time for me to round up some more potential models for my " urlLink Musings t-shirt " and more specifically, urlLink thong . Don't worry folks, I am bringin a camera, and there will be pictures come Sunday most likely. Keep your modems peeled, and your hands out of your pants.

 In an effort to de-throne urlLink Frank , the King Of All Things urlLink French , urlLink monkey-smelling and not- urlLink manly , Fat Kid hereby announces his first ever t-shirt contest. urlLink Frank came up with the absoulutely ludicrous idea that he might be able to sell more shirts by having icky girls urlLink take pictures of themselves wearing them , then have various dirty old men from the blogosphere vote on them for a spokesmodel position. Where's urlLink NOW , when you need 'em I say? Very original, and it appears to be working (damnit). I (with the help of urlLink Libbo kicking me in the toofises) came up with the also very original, and very brilliant idea of beating urlLink Frank at his own game. So, again, with urlLink Libbo doing all the heavy lifting (I'm fat, remember), he designed the urlLink first ever "Fat Kid" t-shirt !!! urlLink BUY IT HERE! Now that I have t-shirts available, I AM IN SEARCH OF MODELS . That's right ladies, if you think you have what it takes to represent the Fatness, urlLink get in touch . In an ironic twist not lost on me, no fatties allowed - I'm lookin to sell shirts here people. C'mon. I've already got one two volunteer(s), just need like 50 more for this thing to work. Also, if you're reading this, do me a favor and click every link that says " urlLink Frank " - I want to make sure he see's me comin. Wouldn't be fair to trample him from behind and all... PS: urlLink Libbo sounds off , spreading the news that urlLink Frank J. will soon be de-throned. Fat Kid Akbar . PPS 2: Tryin to find these two... PPS 3: Got a two model(s) fuckfaces. Anty up...

 I dont know what's better, gettin laid or gettin paid, I just know when I'm gettin one the other's gettin away... -Dilated Peoples, "This way" I'm at work. Gettin paid. Fuck.

 You know you've been owned by the fat kid when 28% of the bandwidth for your site urlLink has been leeched . :/ Sorry dude. Thanks to my trusty referrer log for the heads up.

 urlLink Reagan Akhbar ! What you don’t know when you’re 22 could fill a book. If you write that book when you’re 44, you haven’t learned a thing. My thoughts on James Lileks you ask? Nobody does it better. If his "Bleat" is not a daily "must read" for you, your life is that much poorer without your even knowing it. Seriously. An observation from today's Opinion Jounal: Stanley's colleague Adam Nagourney tries to find hope for the Democrats: "Some Republicans said the images of a forceful Mr. Reagan giving dramatic speeches on television provided a less-than-welcome contrast with Mr. Bush's own appearances these days, and that it was not in Mr. Bush's interest to encourage such comparisons." Well, maybe. Certainly Bush isn't as eloquent as Reagan was. Then again, neither is John Kerry. When Bush speaks, you often imagine Reagan might have said the same thing better. When Kerry speaks, you imagine Reagan would disagree--assuming he could even figure out what Kerry was saying. Update: Holy shit, I've got urlLink tears in my eyes .

 Spent about 2 hours yesterday trying to fix the elevator in my buddy's house. Apparently someone pulled the door frame out of the wall (just an inch or so) and the elevator got stuck between floors. My initial thoughts were that, since the elevator moves slow as fuck, someone was drunk, got tired of waiting for it, and yanked on the door that closes off the empty shaft a little too hard - thereby tripping a fuse or something. Just got the update, someone stopped it in between floors, urlLink got their fuck on , then couldn't "un-stop" the elevator, had to kick open the door from the inside, and boogied out of the party. I have my sneaking suspicions. //cough geoff cough// Geoff , you wouldn't happen to know what I'm talking about? Would you Geoff ? Huh, Geoff , about the elevator Geoff , I mean. LOL

 Electric urlLink relaxation . Pic of sunset from a Wednesday night surf session. I've got a great series of about 5 photo's of the sun setting that night, lemme see if I can string it together into one photo.

 Looks like one of the distruntled leftward-thinking individuals from the urlLink R6MessageNet got a urlLink little pissed off about urlLink todays news that, no, it wasn't his urlLink house that was startin to flame up; it was the ECONOMY (stupid). Silly communists never learn. For those of you NOT in the know, COSAC stands for: CO lorado S ocialist A ctivities C lub The same group that had me banned from that motorcycle message board a few months ago. Think: EvilHalliburtonBusHitlerKNEWChenyKKKAbuGraibworsethan911 MichaelMooreisGOD - basically a bunch of knee-jerk reaction losers from Colorado, and one Muslim Social Worker from SoCal. Heh. Update : Check out the referrer logs, look at all the traffic comin in from there. Wonder what that's for? Heh.

 Sure to break both my legs, my back, my neck, some fingers and my ear... Here's Jesse urlLink catchin some shorebreak yesterday. I think it's worth mentioning (for you poor land-locked souls) that no, that is not a surf board - it's called a "skimmer". Flat bottom (waxed up) and a bit of a kicker on the nose - you basically run down the beach, throw the board down in some wet sand then jump on it like a skateboard - in my case, most of the time with disastrous results. And here's some other dude urlLink getting sodomized down at the urlLink Wedge . Note that the water is sheeting over the sand on the beach. That wave might as well be crashing in the sand. Thanks to Jesse for both the pics!

 urlLink Sudan - Why There Are "No Villages Left to Burn" . In 1983, 11 years of peace between northern Sudan, dominated by Arab Muslims, and southern Sudan, dominated by black Christians and animists, came to an end. As part of a program to implement Islamic law throughout Sudan, President Ja'far Numayri divided southern Sudan into three provinces. The citizens of the non-Muslim south rebelled. Autonomy for the south was not universally popular in the north. Hasan al-Turabi, the leader of the National Islamic Front (NIF), an Islamic fundamentalist movement with a strong presence throughout northern Sudan's civil society, allied himself with Umar Hasan al-Bashir, a major General in the Sudanese army willing to continue the war.

 urlLink DRUDGE REPORT FLASH 2004� Roger Ailes, chairman and CEO of Fox News, writes in the Wall Street Journal (6/2, A14). "John S. Carroll, the editor of the Los Angeles Times, recently gave a speech at the University of Oregon, in which he attacked Bill O'Reilly, Fox News Channel and me, the chairman of Fox News. However, Mr. Carroll obviously did not feel particularly restricted by facts, truth or sources. In an effort to use guilt by association, he compared me to Sen. Joseph McCarthy without evidence, sourcing or analysis. An old, cheap trick used by weak writers and thinkers. Mr. Carroll essentially announced that the reason Fox News Channel is the No. 1 cable news network and is gaining viewers is because the American people are stupid and gullible. In addition, he deliberately confused our highly rated news analysis and opinion shows like Bill O'Reilly with our hard news coverage." Ailes adds, "Mr. Carroll's pathetic attempt to smear Fox News Channel will only drive his paper's circulation down, as it should. Fox News Channel's audience in Los Angeles is increasing daily. The Los Angeles Times is becoming less relevant in people's lives, so Mr. Carroll is trying to flog health back to a newspaper by attacking television news. ... He owes the fine journalists at the Fox News Channel an apology for his insulting comments. However, we will never see that. He treated Fox News Channel worse in his newspaper than he treated the terrorists who recently beheaded an American. But of course, he sees Fox News as more dangerous."

 You know when you post opening lines like in urlLink this article , a suspicious eyebrow has been raised. Classic. Just plain classic. Where's that media bias nobody is talking about again? Heh.

 Yes, a re-post, but worth it. urlLink Fuck, it's too big BTW, for those of you from Newps, post up and tell me who the FUCK that girl on the right is. MmmmK?

 This one's for you Libbo. Kind of. This girl, urlLink Shalane Flanagan , is pretty much one of the top runners in the world right now, 5k, 10k stuff. It just so happens that I grew up swimming with her, which is weird, and cool. It also happens to be that she is hot as hell (which is where you come in Libbo). Enjoy. Also, here's some urlLink linky goodness in case you feel like reading more.

 Next time some jerk tells you a urlLink diamond lane violation adds points to your record... urlLink don't believe the hype . I spent two (wasted) hours of my life sitting in line to talk to a judge at the OC Superior Court, only to get up, try and plead guilty so as to request second level traffic school, only to have it tossed back in my face that, traffic school is not an option for this infraction. Apparently, contrary to popular belief, thi is not a "points earning" offense - bah. Of course, I don't feel as bad as the stoner kid who got busted with a nickel bag, and asked the judge to reduce his $50 fine, only to have the judge make fun of him. Something about the hypocrisy involved in living in OC, being able to afford drugs and a mere $50 fine. Heh. Or the bitch who tried to cry about driving on the toll road without her speedpass, when the judge wasn't havin any of it, and told her (basically) that she was stupid, she got all flippant with him and stormed out of the court - that was fun. Nor do I feel as bad as the kids who were read the riot act for doing something stupid like 50 in a school zone @ 2:30, or how about them no insurance, no license, no registration broke-dick illegals - gotta love them. Scary thing is, they made up the largest percentage of offenders. Net net net, if you're ever bored, and in need of a good laugh, go to traffic court and pull up a seat in the back.

 urlLink This would pose a LOT of problems.

 Am I the only one who thinks advertising is a bunch of horse-shit, and these guys' sole r'aison d'etre is to see how much money they can urlLink piss away without drawing too much attention to themselves. Just feels like they're always looking for a new scam to justify their budgets.

 Will be Lance Armstrong. I've been reading a bunch of political blogs, and a bunch of cycling blogs and I haven't read this anywhere, so you can report you heard it here first. Lance Armstrong: Six time TDF winner, cancer survivor, Texan, all around blue-collar guy. The only thing Bush is going to have to deal with is his recent divorce, but I think Lance is one of those indelible characters that you simple can't bash without looking like a total shitbag. The Dems tried it with Max Cleland, and it blew up in their faces. Lance is no politician, which makes him that much better of a candidate to speak at the convention.

 Tentatively planned for late August, if not the first week in September. Looking to take a full week off of work. Do one of the "leave Saturday AM at 0300" things - get up to urlLink St. Georges (famous MTB spot) get a day, or two, of MTB in - then hit the road for the final 500 or so miles up to the urlLink Grand Teton National Park . Either that, or take the round about way over to Idaho Falls and say hi to Pat, then cruise down through urlLink Yellowstone and Grand Teton, spend a couple days camping, do a day or two in a hostel in urlLink Jackson , then cruise home while hitting up Cedar Rapids or (God help me) Vegas on the way hom. Holy effin FUN batman. Oh yeah, did I mention this 2,000 mile trip will be solo ? urlLink Map here .

 I hate my Ipod, urlLink Om Malik explains why . This is one of *many* problems I've had with this thing. The bag over the head and punch in the face (as Clark Griswold would say) is that there'e literally NO VIABLE ALTERNATIVE on the market. Rio's tank, and don't have the UI of the ipod, and Sony's new gem only plays their proprietary ATRAC format, which I'm very wary of. Sucks being an "early adopter".

 Remember when the coups in Venezuela were "big events" as little as a year ago? Chavez (the socialist dictator) pretty much nationalized everything in the country, from media companies to oil production etc. Well, in the process his cronies also murdered a whole bunch of civilians, and the US has been working behind the scenes since then to help prop the democratic leanings of the people. This urlLink referendum, was a source of the most consternation on the part of Chavez - and now, looks like it's going to be carried out in the VERY near future. Neat. Too bad it's being overshadowed by *more pressing* issues like Michael Moore's speeches at the DNC, the hysterics surrounding that event and whatever other urlLink conspiracy theory the hacks over at DU can come up with at the moment. Food for thought, we (as a country) need to stop forgetting that the rest of the world doesn't stop and hold their breath while we pick a Presidential candidate.

 And Donald Trump ushers in the urlLink end of reality TV as we now know it. Wow.

 All in response to urlLink this item , which has been blowing around the blogosphere for the last week or so.

That's sarcasm folks, it seems like lately all Dem's have been doing is "questioning the timing" of anything and everything the administration does. Well, here's one more example of something that makes them looks stupid (PC-culture blowing up in their face), and it just so happens that it took place in Texas, where we all know the President is from - the land of The Cowboy . Of course Karl Rove came out with this "leak" (even though their assets were frozen in 2001) at the same time as the DNC to distract the rest of the country from all the great work those bumblers are doing back in my hometown. Goofs.

 urlLink Ann Coulter get's bagged , USA Today replaces her column with urlLink something by Jonah Goldberg , only to have Ace urlLink satirize the shit out of it . Hehehehe. I take back my comment from earlier, urlLink American Digest isn't my only new favorite blog, urlLink Ace is right up there too.

 urlLink Ace once again tears into Sullivan . Oh yeah, btw, Sully just endorsed Kerry. Expect more where this came from. As a sidenote, I hope one day I can pull in $120,000 from this fucking POS blog, and pass it off as "bandwidth" expense. *raising hand* Glad I didn't donate to *that* shitbag.

And when I say tax dollars, I'm talking about your money, money the government took from you to build a road for chickens to cross.

 I can't be the only one thinking urlLink this years Olympics are going to be a monumental disaster/flop. Honestly. After the last two sets of summer games, what were they, Sydney and Atlanta - which were extremely well organized, now we've got this debacle? I mean, I was in Sydney fully 8 months before the games were scheduled to start, and we were swimming in the Olympic pool, with all the get up and go. The transportation infrastructure was complete, they were just putting finishing touches on the venues. These guys are dealing with blackouts, incomplete venues, inadequate security and a whole slew of other bad omens, and we've got one MONTH before the games start? Oh man. This is going to be the one set of Olympic Games in my memory that I can honestly say I'm glad I won't be attending.

Way to kill a weekend, eh? In any case, in some interesting news, I did just go to the shooting range, and fortunately for my fragile ego, I left the targets there, so don't expect me to post any pictures. Let's just say I offically suck. I am, however, going to make an attempt at doing something about it. I took a gentlemans biz card, and I think I'm going to start taking some basic lessons. I need to learn the uber-basic shit like how to hold the god damn thing for one, and how to "squeeze, not pull" the trigger (though I may have that backwards - lol). In any case, yeah, I can't shoot for shit. Do need to learn though. In other "good" news, I noted that they have the urlLink GODFORSAKEN S&W 50 cal for RENT. FOR FIVE FRICKIN DOLLARS. They don't immediately mention, however, that the ammunition for the beast costs $40 for 20 rounds. /kickinthenuts I'll save that for when I have friends to share the burden, or at least take pics of me laughing my balls of when I shoot it - the gun that's designed to basically kill any non-armored (metal plates) living thing on the face of this earth. Well, maybe an exaggeration, but it is designed to kill any game animal - including bears and boars, two of the nastier animals I can think of. I wonder what it'd do to a blue whale, not that you'd want to shoot one... but, you know...

 From urlLink The Guardian no less, and the money quote: "'I think that if you don't know the facts you could be persuaded,'" Read the whole thing.

 urlLink Here .

 Just like urlLink Al Gore ! Disclaimer: I never claimed to be civil, alright.

 For those of you forced to register under urlLink Megans Law (for one reason or another), here's something urlLink you might enjoy . $5 says the seat is pressure sensitive, sit on it and the glass clears up. Heh. Thanks to Giraffe for the link!

 Cruising along I-5, about to hit my exit, when all of a sudden I see what looks like a lady shaking her fists in anger in front of me. Nothing out of the normal says I, CA drivers suck. Next thing I know, this woman start swerving off the road, mind you this lady *was* 15 ft in front of me, we were moving along at about 40-45 mph in traffic. I back off, thinkin "WTF is this lady doing" - the very next thing, she goes off the road, takes out a call box, a urlLink 50 ft light pole , continues to swerve across the merging 2 lanes, goes flying off the road, through a ditch and into some bushes!!!! WTF Myself and 4 other cars pull over, this lady is still on the gas. Only reason she's not moving is b/c the wheels are off the ground. Fortunatly her stroke was over by the time we got to her, and she was just kind of hangin out. The front windshield held up, so she wasn't a bloody mess. The rear of the car didn't do so well, as you can see. Sorry for the crappy image quality, they're from my camera phone. I didn't want to take more b/c I felt like I was gawking. Which I hate.

 Hope all y'all had a great weekend. Though the weekend had it's ups and downs, overall some very good shit. Spent much of the time hangin with Geoff down at the Laguna House and his beach house. We spent yesterday cruisin the boardwalk on the bikes, and gettin into mischief. Geoff was so kind as to provide me with about 40 sets of beads, which by the end of the day were gone, and I'd seen about 35 pairs of lucious titties. A beautiful thing... In any case, I did want to share with y'all the results of my "bike fight" with Jesse yesterday. Somewhere along the line I think we decided it would be fun to start hurling bikes at eachother. Attempting to avoid a beach cruiser that was hurtling at my head, I somehow did urlLink this to my urlLink foot . Think it's broken much? The Doc should be able to give the official word, but you tell me where the smart money's playin. ;) Excuse the dirty tape marks, I found a physical trainer last night somewhere along the line and she taped me up with some industrial stuff, and it's a little too tender this morning/afternoon to remove all the tape-shit.

 I've been sayin urlLink this about urlLink The Onion for years. It always bugged the shit out of me the way they portray some things (politics being the main offense). Which, is basically why I haven't read it much for the past couple years. Basically ever since 9/11 - it just seems they've taken the whole thing as urlLink a joke . I mean, you can find at least one article in every single on-line issue like the one I just linked. God forbid we even start to talk about Homeland Security or Ashcroft... *shakes head* Political discourse in this country is swirling down the toilet.

 *shrugs* keeps the snow off the driveway Teeheheheh.

 urlLink I need more FUNDING . Giant tsunamis, super volcanoes and earthquakes could pose a greater threat than terrorism, scientists claim. Nothing like exploiting 'terrorism' to further your budgetary outlook for next year, eh "scientists". You know who should be focusing their energy on this, as opposed to, say, pursuing nuclear weapons, India. How many of those mofo's die each year b/c of monsoons or tidal waves - I bet high 6 digits, if not 7. All you have to do is go read some of the geo-political strategy reports that have been coming out these last few years - the US is pretty much the best-positioned country in the world to deal with any kind of severe natural catastrophe. All this airport screening shit is doing nothing but helping us prepare for some "big natural catastrophic event". For those of you who *haven't* read the reports I'm talking about (I'll try and find links later) - they basically say, in the event of some dramatic global climate change (poles reversing, etc.) it's going to be countries with wealth, land and natural resources that will thrive. The problem will be immigration, little insignificant countries like France, where 10,000 people died last summer b/c it was HOT are going to witness violent street protests and societal upheaval. So long welfare state. Nevermind countries like in sub-saharan Africa, or the middle east. LOL. Let's talk about "fucked"... every single shithead dirt bag is gonna come runnin for OUR borders - and why? B/c we have our shit together, that's why. All we have to do once they get here, is give them a free ride. "Hey, you're new here, have some gov't programs to support you and your free-loading family for the next 20 years. All you gotta do is VOTE DEMOCRAT in the coming election, those Republicans are heartless bastards!". And people wonder why Americans are so selfish. When the shit hits the fan, there's only one place people come running. urlLink It ain't France (btw, I consider Israel, "little America")

 urlLink MY WAR - Fear And Loathing In Iraq h/t: urlLink EHOWA This one's good for any of you who'd like to read first hand knowledge about what's really going down in Iraq - from a soldiers perspective.

 OMG.

 urlLink Plain and simple and Ace explains why. I agree.

 If I don't get some poonanny soon, I'm going to go crazy. I now return you to your regularly scheduled programming.

 urlLink Interesting . Oh, and btw, this is my 600th post bitches. Heh.

 So, last night went down to Carlsbad to Keri's little BBQ thing - had a great time, got really shitfaced and ended up talking politics with a few Navy dudes, and Keri's liberal best friend. Oops. Turns out the Navy dudes felt the same way about JFK as I do - we'd like to give him a urlLink cleveland steamer . Well, little miss liberal had a differing opinion - I don't remember much of the argument, but I think it ended in raised voices, me feeling like an asshole and everyone else deathly quiet. Or something. Heh. In any case I did meet some totally cute chick, Julia, who had the raddest ink on her stomach I've ever seen. Not sure that I remember what it is, but it sure was cool. It probably helped that she was fucking hot. So, around 2 I decide that it would be a great idea if I drove home, after having a bottle of wine and damn close to a six pack of Sierra Nevada. It goes without saying it was a pretty hairy 45 mile drive home. A stunt I won't soon be repeating, believe you me. Given that it's already a late night, I got home around 2 or so, I decide to haul off and check my myspace account to see whats up. Got a few messages from some cuties, so I log into AIM/Yahoo to see if anyone's on - b/c I'm feelin frisky. Turns out two are on. Woop, here comes the webcam. Next thing I knew it's 0400, I'm starin down the barrel of a mean fucking hangover, a long day at the office, inability to form a coherent thought (look no further than this post), a case of the shits and no clothes to wear for work in a couple hours. Fuck. Me. Not good prospects. In any case, go listen to Slipknot "Before I forget" - it owns you.

 Drug my roommate away from his incessant studying for about an hour this morning, to go shoot urlLink this beast . Well, feel free to call me a pussy, but my wrist is friggin sore from shooting 10 ROUNDS . With a box of 20 rounds costing $40, I wasn't about to haul off and buy too much ammo - no friggin need, and I have bills to pay. Regardless, this thing is out of control - urlLink it makes shooting my .45 feel like plinking , however the gun is totally controllable. I was expecting the thing to buck back and hit me in the face on recoil - no such thing. The gun recoils almost straight back, and as you can see in the vids, the upward kick is limited to maybe 30 degrees. Very cool. Below are two vids of me and my roommate shooting this supreme American piece of ingenuity. Forgive the quality/resolution of the vids, they were taken from my POS cell phone, as my cam battery is dead. After you've DL'd them, you can always just make them bigger through quick time. urlLink Me, acting the fool ( rt. click > save as ) I was actually hoping P would take a vid of everyone's responses as I took my first shot. Apparently the 10 other people at the range stopped what they were doing, looked at eachother and quizzically announced a collective "WTF was that?!?". A couple dudes walked over, and indicated with their best "it was THAT big" pose that I was shooting something that was clearly larger than my penis... moving on... Here's a urlLink close up vid of Pat ( rt. click > save as ) putting a few holes through the target at 15 or so yards. And yes, that's me giggling like a bitch at his first shot - this gun is comical, like something out of an old comic book. It actually took me about 5 minutes to contain myself before firing the first round - I couldn't stop laughing at this 5 lb+ gun, with ammunition I can almost fit my pinkie finger in, which can fire a 1 oz slug at sixteen hundred and fucking sixty five feet per fucking second - which is approximately two times the speed of sound, which is approximately twice as fast as the rounds chambered in my HK .45. Oof.
