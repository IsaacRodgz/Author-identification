 So. Not much to write about, really. Life is... life, and everything's OK. Can't complain. Oh, except that my interview to be an SLA co-chair is tomorrow and I'm nervous. I really really want to be a co-chair but I know there were a TON of people who applied for just a few available positions. I'm scared. Even if I don't get to be a co-chair I'll still be a delegate, but I think it would be a lot more fun to have some power in the hierarchy. Mmm, power. It really is the ultimate aphrodisiac. And before I forget, happy day-after-the-Ides-of-March.

 I'm getting worried about colleges. (Don't tell me I'm only a sophomore. I know this. I'm paranoid.) The only colleges I've looked at that I really really like are mad-crazy high end, like Princeton, Stanford, Brown, Harvard, et al. I don't know what I'm going to do if I don't get into one of these schools. They're so wonderful, and nothing else I've seen out of the colleges I have a decent chance of getting into are any good. Witness: urlLink Harvard's history program kicks serious history program ass. Stanford's urlLink History, Literature, and the Arts curriculum is cool beyond reasonable measure. And don't even get me started on urlLink Princeton's religion department (scroll down to "REL - Religion" and click "Search"). So so pretty... not to mention absolutely perfect in every possible imaginable way. I haven't found any mid-level schools that even come moderately close to matching these kind of programs. So far William and Mary, Tufts, UVA and UNC are my best options, but even UVA is really hard to get into and the others have some pretty serious faults. I need to apply somewhere I have at least a half-way decent shot of getting into. I'm scared.

 So. Lots of stuff has happened over the past few days. A brief recap is probably in order. - Friday night, went prom dress shopping with Kit, Claire, and Elena. It was much more fun knowing that I already had a dress and all the trappings that go with it. Either way, making fun of all the skanky dresses was muchos gratifying. - Got my packet from YLA. I'm on the Judiciary Committee. Yay! It's the one I wanted the most, and I get to be with people I know. Smiles! - Saturday, worked my tail off. Finished almost all my homework, did all my chores, and cooked dinner. Whew. I was in the mood to work, though, so it really wasn't bad at all. I was glad to get everything over-with. - Slept in this morning. Mmm. Sleep is good. - Went through catalogs with my mother to find some more YLA pants. Ordered two pairs: black and khaki. The most comforting thing about the whole process was I pretty much knew they were going to fit me because I already own one pair. They're a little short for me, but we ordered a longer hem this time. Sweet. All I needed now was one more shirt, and I would be done. - Went to urlLink Target to look for a YLA purse. I was hoping to find a cute little red retro one, and I did! It's absolutely perfect, and I was very pleased. (It was also on sale for $14.99. Not bad at all.) - While wandering through the clothing section, I stumbled across some business-y blouses. I tried one particularly cute one on, and what do you know? It fit! And it gets better - it was also on sale for $16.99! I was very very happy. Now all my YLA shopping is done, I'm on the committee I wanted, and I didn't have to spend too much. I am a happy happy child. - Now I'm home, and pretty much all I have to do the rest of today is some more studying and... that's it. Excellent. Hannah gets to go to bed early again.

 An interesting link from urlLink Mr. Grunden's blog . A LiveJournal written from the perspective of the, er, urlLink rather ditzy Mars rover, Opportunity . It's pretty good. There is something really wonderful about those nights where you come home, take a walk, finish all your homework, and all you have left to do is read about 15 pages worth of Nietzsche. Mmm, rest... Please also note: There is a new link on the sidebar entitled "Cute Kitten Generator." I linked to it once before a few weeks ago, but now it's permanent. Go there and marvel in the cute-kitten-ness. Definitely have a French test tomorrow. Definitely didn't bring my textbook home. Definitely don't care. I need a weekend. Bad. Someone please make sure tomorrow goes quickly.

 After much delay, an update: - This has been a busy week - I've had a test every day except Monday, and I will have another test on Thursday and another on Friday. These past two weeks have been kind of tough (last week especially was really emotionally draining), but I think once I get through this week I should have a while to relax. I'm really looking forward to it. - My guitar teacher stuck his fingernail file in the light-switch and managed not to get electrocuted. He did, however, destroy a breaker knocking out electricity to a large part of the building and fry the end of his file to a crisp. It was pretty entertaining. - This afternoon my mom and I went to JC Penny's to look at some blouses she and my sister had seen the last time they were there. I made perhaps the most successful shopping trip in recent memory. I found not one but TWO things that fit me! (OK, so they were the same thing in different colors. Let me be happy - this is a first.) And it gets better! They were perfect, and I mean Perfect with a capital "P," for legislative outfits. But it doesn't stop there! They were ON SALE! How beautiful is this! I nearly cried I was so happy. It was a wonderful moment. - Environmental Science is actually starting to evolve into a science class. Ms. Brongo isn't nearly as political as Mrs. Nelson was, and it's really a breath of fresh air. We're memorizing chemical processes instead of all the reasons why Reagan is the devil. It shouldn't be this shocking that a science class teaches us (gasp) science, but there it is. Either way, it's definitely better now. In other news, I We should... Write a campaign ad in which we make deliberately malicious and false statements, burn crosses, show graphic sexual acts and incite people to immediate violence (posing a clear and present danger) and then show the ad in a school really loudly at 3:00 in the morning in order to disturb the neighbors. It will be fun.

 As I foreshadowed last night, it's been a very very long day. Sorry I don't have another update. I'll start being a good blogger again tomorrow. Hopefully.

 Too tired to post tonight. A very long day tomorrow. Goodnight, everyone.

 The Uglies. A terrible condition in which nothing works. Your hair absolutely refuses to do that cute thing it did all on its own a couple days ago, even with various topical chemicals those random red spots on your face just won't go away, and no matter how flattering your clothes are you can't manage to find an outfit that doesn't make you want to scream when you look in the mirror. My friends, I am currently being invaded by The Uglies. How does one remedy this terrible illness? As I see it there are two solutions. 1. Don't do anything. Lounge around all day in your ugliness and enjoy the time spent away from all other people. There's no point in trying to make yourself presentable today, so why not get out all that ugly energy in one fell swoop? Although it may not be the prettiest thing, one ugly day every month or so is good for your health. Normally this is what I do, especially if I'm lucky enough for my Ugly Day to fall on a weekend. But it was far too beautiful out today. The daffodils were out, and there was no way I was going to be kept indoors by The Uglies. I therefore resorted to Solution #2: 2. Make yourself pretty. Pull out that prom dress that's been sitting in your closet since you bought it in January and put it on. Get all dolled up while you're at it - put on some jewelry and perhaps even some makeup. If you have a pretty dress on, those spots on your face and your hair that refuses to cooperate will suddenly be less noticeable. After you've done that, why not get out that really cute pink summer dress and put that on, too. When all your pretty clothes are put back in the closet, put back on your normal clothes (don't look in the mirror - it will most likely reverse the whole process) and have a nice cup of tea with a girly book. I highly recommend urlLink "Confessions of a Shopaholic" by Sophie Kinsella . Relax for a while, and remember that although you are ugly on the outside, there is no need for your inner-pretty to go away. Perhaps one day soon it will resurface again. Until then, think pretty thoughts and remember that while it's what on the inside that counts, a pretty dress now and then never hurt anyone.

 We just watched "Secondhand Lions." Stupid movie. Don't watch it. It was kind of cute, but not even extraordinarily cute, just blah cute. There was one big highlight, though. At the very end, urlLink there was this . Made it all worth it. (This picture is actually from "Sweet Home Alabama" - another silly movie - but it was the best one I could find.)

 Today, Kit and I worked on our assignment for APES. We wrote a series of (you guessed it) haikus for our poem, and made a urlLink totally awesome cartoon . Check it out, it's really cool.

 Today in APES, we had an assignment to draw a cartoon and write a poem about a scientific study on the detrimental effects of UV radiation on aquatic life. Inspired by the idea of writing poetry (something I normally loathe), I spontaneously wrote a haiku about the environmental science curriculum. It made Kit cry she was laughing so hard. The Environmental Science Haiku Save the earth because They are trying to kill it. Republicans suck. It was much fun. I then decided, why not write another? I was inspired by the very accurate words of Carla, whose quote you see in the second line. Lots of useless work. "Blow up the whole f***ing earth." That's how I feel, too. In my other classes, I wrote some more. (The second line of the first one translates as, "What makes you angry?") French class is boring. "Qu'est-ce qui te met en collre?" Take a wild guess. Three classes over. Now I go to Chemistry. Pretty double bonds. And one about the philosophy discussion today after school: Ayn Rand discussion Philosophical bitch-fest Two things that match well. My incessant haiku-writing has infected some other people as well - Kit wrote some really good ones in her English class. I think it pretty much goes without saying that as all this was going on, very little environmental science was actually happening. Teachers really should know better by now than to give me and Kit an assignment to write funny poetry and draw stick figure cartoons. (Ms. Edmundson learned that one last year the hard way.) Put it this way: We wrote a sonnet about fish dying, and had a French stick-man representing UV rays shouting, "Fire zee missiles!" It was one of the most fun classes I've had in a long long time.

 Kit would be pleased: from the urlLink Drudge Report comes urlLink a very stupid picture of Kerry . It's true. He looks like an idiot. I'm a little worried. I think I may be becoming addicted to political blog/news site browsing. This could be serious.

 Michael Moran points out that Bush's plans with Haiti will either solidify or reject the Democrats' claim that he is urlLink "nation-building."

 From urlLink Mrs. Newmark's blog , David Broder is handing out urlLink Democratic primary Oscars .

 Today's... Number: 11 Letter: S Color: Purple-y brown Taste: Bitter Sound: Static Smell: Plastic Texture: Sandpaper Onomatopoeia Word: Kaplunk Book: "Motherless Brooklyn," Jonathan Lethem Cup: White with a green stripe across the middle Accessory: A pencil in my hair Emotion: Exhaustion It's been one of those days.

 I counted. Between now and the end of the year, there will be (at most) three weeks during which I will not be stressed, angry, or upset about something, school or otherwise. This is all together way too much to handle. I need some time off. That feeling I had about a week ago? The one where I wanted to curl up in a ball in a corner and stay there until eternity? Yeah, it's back. Dammit.

 Today: - Writing test. Blech. Stupid. - Had to miss Chemistry. Makes me angry. - Squonk things upset me. Go figure. Today was not so hot a day. Oh well. Nothing that a little sleep and some chocolate can't remedy. And Thursday is the National French Exam, so I get to miss first and second periods (sweet). I did really well on that test last year - I came in fifth in the state - but not quite well enough to win anything good. Just a medal and some certificates. But if I do better, I could win either some cash or a trip to Paris! How cool would that be! Probably won't happen, but I'm OK with that. It's just more stuff to put on that college application of mine. Talking of which, the list of colleges is getting interesting. Number that I'm kind of looking at right now: 9. Number of those that I actually have interest in going to: 5. Number that I have a halfway decent chance of getting into: 3 Number of the ones I have interest in that I have a halfway decent chance of getting into: 1. It's good. The List (kind of in order, but not really) Stanford Princeton Brown Tufts Columbia Georgetown UVA UNC William and Mary Mmm, Stanford. Mmm, Princeton. Mmm, Brown. I would kill to go to any of those schools. Alas. I'll settle for something smaller.

 Yesterday I was listening to This American Life on NPR and Sarah Vowell came on with this hilarious story about growing up with her gun-loving father. To listen to the whole show, go urlLink here and scroll down to "Last Week." You can click on the icons on top to open the audio file. Skip the first four minutes or so - it's just an introduction. The story is the first one after the intro. The rest of the broadcast wasn't anything out of the ordinary, but the Sarah Vowell story was hilarious and very poignant. Laugh really loud when you're listening to it. It makes it even funnier.

 Following Danielle's example, I started writing in random words in blogspot addresses. I found some kind of good ones, and even one in Spanish. My favorite, though, was when I typed in "chocolatelover.blogspot.com" and got urlLink this : a blog that was only posted on twice and hasn't been updated since, you guessed it, August 2, 2002. Ah, the tragedy of a lost and almost forgotten blog. And such it would have been forever if not for me. Now I can sleep peacefully - I have done some good in the world.

 Playing around with a link from urlLink Kit/Claire's blog . Check out urlLink my creation . Tee hee, good times.

 While I was cleaning out my shelves, I found all these mix CDs from when I was a loser Napster user (pre-iTunes) with lots of funny songs that I apparently liked a few years ago. Good lord, I had bad taste. It's kind of fun to listen to it though. Some of them are pretty decent, or if not decent, at least fun. Like Seven and the Sun, "Walk With Me." It's cute and upbeat, and brings back lots of fun memories of dancing in the car. But my favorite song so far is probably Trik Turner, "Friends and Family." Our drama class in eighth grade used that song as the intro music to our year-long project of writing, producing, and acting in a soap opera. Molly and I were the writers, and I also played one of the principal characters. It was a good project. Our drama teacher was also really really cool, and made the whole thing way more fun than it would have been otherwise. So Mr. Matthews, if you're out there, thanks. We love you.

 My new amusing link: urlLink Television Without Pity . Take a gander. It's quite funny. (Link via urlLink Anonymous Rex .)

 The Lord of the Rings urlLink swept the Academy Awards last night, winning all of the 11 awards it was nominated for, including Best Director and Best Picture. YAY! It really deserved all of them. Other winners were The Fog of War for Best Documentary Feature, Sean Penn for Best Actor, Charlize Theron for Best Actress, Tim Robbins for Best Supporting Actor, and Renee Zellweger for Best Supporting Actress. And Mitch and Mickey performed their song from A Mighty Wind. I cried (from both laughter and honest emotion).

 Got the Josh Kelley CD. It's lovely. Thirteen tracks, plus four bonus ones on a separate EP. Mmm, pretty new music makes me smile. The APES final was much easier than I expected. Not only was the actual test mind bogglingly straightforward, but the grading curve added a much appreciated confidence boost. (As long as you get at least 36 of the 75 questions right, you get an A. Sweet life.) I'm glad I didn't over-stress. My grandparents arrive at 10:00 tonight. I am excited to see them, but at the same time being around them (and around my parents around them) can be really exhausting. Tomorrow, for instance, we are waking up at an ungodly hour to drive to Wilmington. After the two hour drive, we drop my sister off at her All-State rehearsal and then have to spend the rest of the day wandering around Wilmington. Since my grandparents have never been there, and because my grandma in particular has a freakishly high energy level, I can guarantee we'll be trekking around whatever there is down there. Then we go to the concert in the evening and still have to shlep all the way home before I can crash on my sister's room's floor. (The grandparents are sleeping in my room.) Sunday my sister and I will spend most of the day - a solid five hours minimum - making dinner. Trust me, homemade dim sum takes one hell of a lot longer than you think it does. Then the week starts again, and I know with this combination of illness and company I'm going to burn out sometime around Wednesday. Be forewarned. Anyway, I shouldn't complain. It's really not bad at all. I've got pretty music playing in the background, family is coming, I've been booted out of my room, I'm still sick... I think I'll just stop before I talk myself in a circle. Talking of strange things, (were we? Oh, oops.) I've run into a crazy number of people in strange places today. It's uncanny. In Wellspring: - Mrs. Scicinska - Nancy and Joseph, who used to live down the street from us - Mrs. Scicinska found someone my mom met once, and introduced us In Borders: - Mrs. Martin, my math teacher from eighth grade It's a mad mad world.

 This is what happens when my sister asks me (on LOTS of cold meds) for help with her science homework. She had to write a poem about the digestive system. I realize the iambic pentameter isn't perfect, but hey, it's about the digestive system. Cut me some slack. I now present you with... Ode to the Digestive System System of digstion, how I love you, And all your peristalsis processes. Your sphincters that connect things, they are two, And let food move through your system with ease. But first we meet the salivary glands, Where we break down the polysaccharides, Through the esophagus with muscle bands, To the stomach where food goes for a ride. Duodenum - a funny word it is, For the first part of the small intestine, Then to the large intenstine, where its biz Is to absorb the water still within. Then finally our journey comes to end, When out the rectum food waste does descend.

 So watching Jon Stewart a while ago ( . I immediately rushed to iTunes, and lo and behold, they had him. Unfortunately, they do not carry the entire album (it's missing two songs) and since the list price for the album is quite a bit lower than normal, I'm thinking this is a rare opportunity to buy the actual CD for less than it would cost me on iTunes. Shocking, I know. But partially in gratitude for all the wonderful things iTunes has done for me, and mostly because I had genuine interest, I did purchase their exclusive acoustic version of "Amazing." It is absolutely lovely. So if you're like me and all your old CDs are getting worn out from extensive play and you are dying for some new rhythms, I suggest you give Josh Kelley a try. I promise you won't be disappointed. P.S. Although I shall try my best, the grandparental units are coming into town tomorrow evening, and due to their visit, posting will most likely be at a minimum. I shall try, however, to keep my loyal visitors (ha) updated on the progress of my seemingly never-ending illness and the status of my work and exam schedule. P.P.S. For my loyal visitors (ha): I'm not feeling much better. I'm currently on... hang on... four drugs and they are all making me woozy. Trust me, it's a lot harder typing when you can see two keyboards. I'm nervous about the APES final tomorrow, but not worried. (Does that make sense? No. Blame the meds.) I shall try to post more later, and hopefully then it will not only be better news, but also coherent. Freaky.

 The Good News: It's not mono. The Bad News: Still sick, still have an APES final on Friday, etc. The usual.

 CURSES! And just to make things worse, I can't find my Jethro Tull CD anywhere. !%$#*&#@*!

 I need to start writing longer posts again. Or if not longer, at least less whiny, self-centered, and irritating. But I don't have time, and the only things I seem to be able to articulate lately are how tired and sick I am. Sorry. Hopefully once this whatever-it-is-and-hopefully-it-isn't-mono thing passes I can get back to being myself. Until then...

 Someone mentioned to me today that my symptoms happen to be the same ones as mono. And apparently there might be a strain of it running around the school. And a whole slew of people were out today. Coincidence? I sure hope so.

 I just wrote a long post about things... but I don't want to post it. Some things are better not on the internet, somehow.

 Sick! Tired! Voiceless! I wish I could get better. I also wish I could sleep. That would be nice, too. While we're wishing things, let's make AP exams go away. The APES final, too. Blech. Summer needs to get here quicker.

 Whew. OK. I think I've got most of it back up. It took me long enough - I've been sitting here nearly an hour and a half. Obviously it's not all there yet - it does look awfully bare in some places - but enough of it's there that I'm going to go take a nap. (I'm sick again, in case anyone was wondering.) If anyone knows of a link that I missed, and I'm sure there are TONS, feel free to let me know either by posting a comment or by emailing me. Thanks.

 Wow. My comments suddenly disappeared. How very random. UPDATE: So did my entire template! WHAT THE HELL?! I'll try to get it fixed... man, I really liked that one. UPDATE #2: I found part of the old code for the template, but unfortunately it didn't have any links on it. I'm in the process now of rebuilding my sidebar. Bear with me.

 Look at what I got! I get to read it first, before my dad. I'm very excited. The two of us saw an interview last week with Woodward and he seemed like a cool guy. I read the first ten pages or so in the store, but since I didn't have my glasses I got a massive headache and had to stop. Anyway, it's home now and I can't wait to get into it. Yay!

 Things That Are Over: - This week! - APES tests! - GoPo tests! - Incredibly sick feeling! (Replaced with slightly-less-sick feeling) Now we just have to make it through the APES final (it's next Friday, folks), the AP exams (mine are both in three weeks), and finals (five weeks from now). Not good. But once that's all over - summer! Is there such a thing as sophomore-itis? If there is, I think I have it. Work hasn't really been happening lately. Wednesday night, I came home and literally did not open my bag at all to do homework. I am so ready for summer. Mmm, sleep. It's a good thing. Tonight is prom. Although I doubt anyone who's going will read this tonight because they'll be too busy getting ready, I hope they all have a wonderful time. I get to go out to dinner with some friends, so I'm very happy about that. I leave you with the song currently playing in my room: All I Need Everywhere someone's getting over Everybody cries And sometimes you can still lose even if you really try Talking about the dream Like the dream is over Talk like that Won't get you nowhere Everybody's trusting in the heart Like the heart don't lie - Matchbox Twenty

 I'm sick. I'm tired. I don't like being either one. I also don't like having to study for two big tests tomorrow. Plus write a composition. Plus reading. Ick. The good news: Five weeks and one day until summer. Sweet. The bad news: Between now and then (in order), APES final, AP exams, rest of finals. Sickness and tiredness. I feel really really gross right now.

 Is it a little sad that I just now got around to resetting one of the clocks in my room for Daylight Savings Time? Yeah, a little.

 Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M. I can hear the soft breathing Of the girl that I love As she lies here beside me Asleep with the night And her hair, in a fine mist Floats on my pillow, Reflecting the glow Of the winter moonlight. She is soft, she is warm, But my heart remains heavy And I watch as her breasts Gently rise, gently fall For I know with the first light of dawn I'll be leaving, And tonight will be All I have left to recall. Oh, what have I done? Why have I done it? I've committed a crime, I've broken the law. For twenty-five dollars And pieces of silver, I held up and robbed A hard liquor store. My life seems unreal, My crime an illusion A scene badly written In which I must play. Yet I know as I gaze At my young love beside me, The morning is just a few hours away. - Simon and Garfunkel

 Hannah has pretty new things! 1. urlLink GUITAR! It's beautiful and it makes my heart smile. I've named him George. He has a solid spruce top, rosewood back and sides, and a mahogany neck. George, I 2. FILE FOLDERS! ( urlLink 1 , urlLink 2 ) They are also pretty and color-coded and make my geeky side smile. But not nearly as much as George does.

 From urlLink Mrs. N : urlLink John Kerry flip flops . That's almost as good as urlLink Freudian slippers .

 I have a couple things to say to Diane Keaton. 1. Don't try to keep playing Annie Hall when you're sixty. It doesn't work. Find a new character. 2. The choice between a grumpy old Jack Nicholson and a (relatively speaking) good-looking guy in jeans is not a hard one to make. When you have Keanu Reeves chasing you around your house, the intelligent thing to do is not to blow him off and go for the grumpy old guy who keeps having heart attacks. Yeah, I just saw Something's Gotta Give . It was terrible. If you haven't seen it yet, spare yourself the pain and don't. You don't need to picture Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson getting it on, much less see it on film. It's disturbing. Even fast-forwarded, it freaked me out. But I also saw Manhattan , and that is a great movie. This one you should all see, if you haven't already. Something's Gotta Give tried to steal a lot of the themes from that movie, but alas, it failed. It was painful. Don't watch it.

 You want more? I'll give you more. This is a sampling (just a sampling ) of the Religion department. REL 363 Perspectives on Religious Ethics: Recent Philosophy (EM) Enrollment by application or interview. Departmental permission required. Maximum Enrollment: 15 Professor(s): Jeffrey L. Stout Description/Objectives: This seminar will examine philosophical accounts of what it means to live well, focusing mainly on works written in the last half century that are relevant to issues in religious ethics: whether morality requires a religious foundation, the ethical significance of divine commandments, and the concepts of virtue, goodness, evil, horror, holiness, sainthood, faith, and the sacred. --- REL 242/ JDS 242 Jewish Thought and Modern Society (EM) No Audit Professor(s): Leora F. Batnitzky Description/Objectives: What is Judaism's, and the individual Jew's, relation to the modern world? Is Judaism a religion, a nationality, an ethnicity, or a combination of these? This course explores different answers to these questions by examining various historical and cultural formations of Jewish identity in Europe, America, and Israel from the seventeenth century to the present, as well as by engaging particular issues, such as Judaism's relation to technology, the environment, bioethics, feminism, and democracy. --- REL 245/ JDS 245 Jewish Mysticism: From the Beginnings to Kabbala (HA) Professor(s): Peter Schfer Description/Objectives: The Kabbalah, the summit of Jewish mysticism, is among the most revolutionary innovations in the history of Judaism. It transforms the single, static (and essentially male) God of biblical and rabbinic Judaism into a dynamic and multifaceted God, whose rich inner life can be explored -- and influenced -- by human beings. This course follows the historical development of Jewish mysticism from its early beginnings and examines its major themes, e.g., God, his female aspect, creation, good and evil, redemption, and mystical union. --- REL 252 The Early Christian Movement (HA) No Audit Professor(s): Elaine H. Pagels [!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!] Description/Objectives: Investigation of gnostic gospels and other writings and their significance for understandings of the origin of Christianity. Topics include: conflicting interpretations of Jesus and Paul and their messages; human nature; the origin of the universe; religious experience; sexuality; and organizational politics. --- POL 309/ REL 309 Politics and Religion (EM) Maximum Enrollment: 155 Professor(s): Maurizio Viroli Description/Objectives: Close study of a number of texts that have illuminated the connection between religiosity and politics, and, in particular, the role of religious language and ideas to establish, preserve, reform, and redeem republics. Special attention will be given to the religious dimensions of revolutionary and messianic politics, and to the role that religiosity has played in the development of contemporary social movements and in the moral and political resistance to totalitarian regimes. Two lectures, one preceptorial. --- AMS 362/ REL 366 American Spirituality from Transcendentalism to the New Age (SA) na, npdf Enrollment by application or interview. Departmental permission required. Maximum Enrollment: 15 Professor(s): Leigh E. Schmidt Description/Objectives: A history of the formation of spirituality in American culture from the Transcendentalist world of Emerson, Thoreau and Whitman to Theosophy and New Thought on through contemporary expressions. Topics to be emphasized: mysticism, nature and solitude, meditation, eclecticism, cosmopolitanism, and individualism. Is the "new spirituality" really new? Is it a subversion of authentic Christianity? Is it dangerously self-absorbed? Is it a model for a religiously plural and democratic society? --- REL 502 Philosophy and the Study of Religion */NC Maximum Enrollment: 20 Professor(s): Jeffrey L. Stout Description/Objectives: This course examines the impact of twentieth-century philosophical ideas on the academic study of religion. It gives attention to naturalism, phenomenology, hermeneutics, structuralism, Nietzschean genealogy, and American pragmatism, among other philosophical movements. --- Again, this is only a tiny, tiny sampling of what they have. Another sigh.

 Found some pictures on the internet of Bellingham. The first is the tulips I described. The second is the San Juan islands just offshore. We could see them from right near the hotel. They were lovely. This is Mount Baker. And yes, it really is only an hour and a half away from the tulips. Cool, eh?

 The Trip (I'm going to make a valiant effort not to use bullets in this post. It will probably fail anyway. We shall see.) From Wednesday until Sunday, my family was in a small town in Washington called Bellingham, and the village within known as Fairhaven. It's a sweet little town very close to the Canadian border. Fairhaven used to be a separate town, but since both have grown, they joined up to become one larger city - although it's probably still not big enough to be called a city. Our traveling began very early on Wednesday morning, and aside from almost missing our first plane because we missed the bus, everything went as smoothly as could be expected. I worked on homework. A lot. We arrived at the Seattle-Tacoma airport and rented a car. The car we got had not been filled with gas, so one of the attendants came over and filled it up for us. He was lots of fun. We got in the car and drove to Bellingham. The normal route would have taken just over an hour, but my parents wanted to take the scenic Chuckanut Drive that follows the coast, so it took a good bit longer than that. I slept most of the time. We finally got to Bellingham. We drove around in a neighborhood for a while (very cute, I might add) and then went to Fairhaven to check into our hotel. I was shocked. From where I was sitting, the village was a dump. It looked messy and gross, nothing like the cute little village my dad had described. I was totally dismayed. But we got to the hotel - a very sweet little inn - and dropped our things in the room. By that time we were starving, so we went to eat at a cafe that was attached to a bookstore. It was quite tasty. After eating, we walked around the town a little bit. I was shocked to see that on the actual ground, the town didn't look nearly as bad as from the car. In fact, it was kind of cute. There were a bunch of little shops and restaurants and even a little park in the middle that faced a large building that had a big white square painted on it. My dad informed me that in the summers they project movies onto the screen and people come to watch them. Slowly but surely I was falling for this little town. We adjourned back to the hotel and went to bed. I hardly slept. I don't know why. The next morning we got up and ate breakfast at this darling place called the Harris Avenue Cafe. I can't say enough good things about it. We then decided to walk around Western Washington University, just a short ways outside of Bellingham. It was kind of ugly. Too much concrete and really grungy-looking kids. I didn't like it much at all. Afterwards, we drove another ways to an arboretum, where we climbed a tower and got a fantastic view of the shoreline and the San Juan islands just off shore. It was really beautiful. For lunch, we went to a double-decker bus that was parked on the corner and had fish and chips. No, I'm not kidding. There really is an old double-decker bus - just like the ones in London - that sells fish and chips. And they're damn good, too. We spent some time that afternoon walking around the harbor in the town. There was a lovely walk that traced the coast, but unfortunately a good chunk of it was under construction so we could only walk a small part of it. Either way, the weather was wonderful and we got to pet lots of cute dogs. That evening, we discovered that My Architect , a documentary that was nominated this year for an Academy Award and a film that my dad really wanted to see, was playing at a theatre in downtown Bellingham. We got in the car and drove over. It took us nearly fifteen minutes to find the place; silly us, we were looking for something that at least resembled a movie theatre. It turned out that it was basically a hole in the wall. We bought our tickets, and practically had to walk through the ticket booth to get to the theatre itself. It was an absolute crackup. There were a grand total of about 50 seats in the whole thing, and everyone there seemed to know everyone else. It was absolutely hilarious. On top of that, the movie was really great. If you haven't seen it, I would highly recommend it. We went back to the hotel and to bed. Didn't sleep much again. Friday morning I spent a good length of time working on homework. (Come to think of it, I spent a large part of my vacation working. Mrs. Newmark, I hope you're happy.) My aunt Jessica and my five-year old cousin Reagan, whom I had never met, arrived in the late morning. My aunt is an extremely critical person, and she almost immediately leapt on my hair. Yeah, that was fun. The six of us all went out to lunch at the Skylark Cafe and had quite an enjoyable meal. Every April in the northwest corner of Washington, the tulips are all in bloom, and the people there hold a month-long tulip festival. We drove out a ways to see some tulips, and parked in a field with tulips of all different colors going on forever. It was truly a sight to see all those beautiful colors contrasted with the snow-capped Cascades in the background. It was really really beautiful. We ate dinner at a restaurant on the water, and although the food was mediocre (except the salmon - obviously) the view of the marina was spectacular. There we said goodbye to my aunt and cousin, and returned to the hotel. Saturday morning we ate again at the Harris Avenue Cafe. The waitress recognized us. It was cool. We also ran into some people who were also from North Carolina, and we chatted for a while. Soon after breakfast we drove out about an hour and a half to Mount Baker. It was incredible to see the transition - tulips to eight feet of snow. We got to the ski lodge and saw a huge number of people all skiing on the mountainside. It was really cool. We drove up another ways and came to another ski lodge, although this one was closed. We walked around in the snow for a while amongst the cross-country skiers and the snowshoers. It was the coolest thing to be in almost eight feet of snow and be so warm that all you need is a tee shirt. This was probably my favorite part of the whole trip. If nothing else, it made me realize that I really really need to learn how to ski. We wandered back down the mountainside and stopped in a few places to be near the river and to take a short hike in the woods. It was quite pleasant. Since none of us were really hungry, we just had some ice cream for lunch and then spent some time walking around Fairhaven. We went in a bunch of shops, and then retired back to the hotel to rest for a while. For dinner, we walked a short ways to a restaurant called Coppa. This was by far my favorite meal of the trip. (Except maybe for the fish and chips.) We ordered a whole bunch of tapas and ate them together. My God, it was good. There was hummus and tabouleh and green salad and chickpea salad and another salad with raw calamari and crab dip and sausage with lamb and pork... suffice to say it was incredible. Wow. The next morning we woke up freakishly early (4:30) and got in the car to drive back to Sea-Tac. We got on the plane and spent the whole day flying home. I worked on homework. Some more. Namely like four hours. As soon as we got home, I collapsed into bed and fell asleep. I'm still very jet lagged and have not yet adjusted to the time zone. Icky. But overall I had a very pleasant trip and was glad to have gone. Especially considering I was dreading the whole affair, it went really really well. Now all I have to do is cope with coming back to school.

 I'M ALIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIVE! Details later. (If you guessed I'd say that, give yourself a cookie.)

 Happy Birthday, Blog!

 I hate this trip. It hasn't even started and I already hate it. Blast.

 Some more legislative pickup lines: - You can be my Youth Affair. - I'm the chair of the Education Committee. We're drafting a new bill about re-instituting paddling in schools... wanna go try it out in my room? - I'll move your previous question all night long. - I'd like to make a point of personal privilege out of you. Again, if you have any more, let me know and I'll post them.

 The 2004 Youth Legislative Assembly Conference Friday - I arrived at the Sheraton hotel, dropped off my things in a storage room on the third floor, and met people. Kit, Claire, Elena and I were all on the same committee (Judiciary) so we stuck together for much of the time. I met a guy named Matt, whom Kit had met over the summer at NC Teen Summit. He seemed nice, although just a little too conservative. - We got on buses and were taken to the Legislative Office Building, where we held our opening ceremony. The Tri-Speakers made some announcements, and a woman (whose name I forget) gave a very long and boring speech. - We adjourned to committee meetings to discuss the individual bills. Our bill was to allow the Ten Commandments and other non-specified religious articles pertaining to the history of law to be placed in the Supreme Court building, and to give other court buildings the option to do so as well. We had a consultant come in to talk with us about the finer points of the issue, and he was lots of fun. We amended the bill in a few key areas to play down the blatant unconstitutionality, but alas, it was still frighteningly unlawful. - We returned to the hotel for free time. It took them a very very long time to get us our room keys, but eventually we got them and were able to put our things in the room. We relaxed for a while before dinner. - We went down to dinner in one of the ballrooms. The setup was quite beautiful - there were tables with candles and formal place settings. The food quality, however, did not justify the setting. Suffice to say I later regretted that I ate so much. But I was starving; what was one to do? There were a couple more boring speeches during dinner. - We went upstairs to change into casual attire, and then had a brief committee meeting in the lobby. It mostly consisted of exchanging bad pick-up lines, especially legislative ones. - There was a talent show that we had to attend, and it went until after 11:00. Not only was it excruciatingly painful, but I was totally exhausted and really wanted to go to bed. They finally let us out, and we went back to our rooms and to sleep. - Didn't sleep much at all. Maybe three hours. I'm not entirely sure why, but it could have something to do with Claire kicking me the entire night. Saturday - Woke up, got dressed, ate breakfast downstairs. It wasn't bad. Plus I got to eat with some fun people I hadn't really known before. - We got on buses again to go to the Legislative Office Building, and the General Assembly convened. The first bill was terrible - it nearly killed me - but most of the others were really fun. There was some excellent debate, and lots of other exciting things. - For lunch, we walked down about a block to eat outside in a park. The meal itself was catered by Bear Rock Cafe, and was pretty good. There were lots of fun people, and some good discussion. I didn't really know Geoff or Jillian much before this trip, and I never realized what cool and interesting people they are. - We walked back to the LOB and continued General Assembly. Again, lots of fun. By the time there was about one hour left in the session, our committee realized that after the bill we were just introducing was our bill, and if we went today we would only have about fifteen minutes to debate it. We really wanted lots of time - it was a fun and controversial bill - so we stalled. A lot. Anyone who tells you that it's impossible to filibuster in the House clearly hasn't seen our YLA committee at work. We called every single vote, even the ones to move the previous question, for division, and proposed tons of amendments. The other delegates, and the Speakers, got really frustrated with us, but it was extremely amusing and in the end we won out. Our bill wouldn't go until the next day. - We commuted back to the Sheraton where we hung out for a couple hours. An interesting plan was proposed to make a certain person rather uncomfortable... but unfortunately it fell through. Next year. - We got changed into formal attire to attend the Tri-Speaker's Banquet. The food, again, kind of sucked, and the speakers were really really (really) boring. I also started feeling a little sick, which didn't make me happy at all. - We all went upstairs again to change into casual clothes for the dance. A few girls tried to force me into a rather skanky outfit to send me to the dance with, but I really wasn't feeling well and so opted to stay in my room while the others went to the dance. (Apparently I didn't miss too much - it was supposed to have been pretty dull.) - In my room I watched the Britney Spears concert on Showtime. Just a little disturbing. - The other girls came back upstairs eventually, but I honestly don't remember what time because I was almost totally asleep. - I slept much better this time. Don't know why. Sunday - Woke up, got dressed, ate breakfast downstairs. Same thing. - We dropped our luggage off in the same storage room and checked out of our hotel room. - The General Session convened again, but because of time restraints we held it in one of the ballrooms in the hotel instead of at the LOB. It was a little tighter, but not bad at all. Our bill was first on the agenda. - After some very long and heated debate on our bill, the body passed it. That's right - the YLA of 2004 passed by two votes our blatantly unconstitutional bill. It was more than a little discouraging. - We finished all the bills and even had time to move on to one Special Resolution. - After debate was over on all the bills, we adjourned the General Assembly and went home. I immediately crawled into bed for a long, long nap. All in all it was a really lovely time, and I look forward to next year's event. And in closing, some legislative pickup lines. (Some are old standbys, others are new ones that Kit and I came up with during the Assembly.) - You can bang my gavel anytime. - Wanna go up and caucus in my room? - So about that Lemon test, I hear you're really into excessive entanglement... - You can drop your bill in my docket. - I'm human; you're sexual; let's form a committee. - I'm on the Environmental Committee - we do it in the wild. - I'm on the Commerce, Science, and Technology Committee. You know, you can do anything under the Commerce Clause. - I wanna get affirmative with your action. I can't remember any others. If you have a good one, let me know and I'll post it.

 YLA ended a little after 1:00 this afternoon. Twas much fun. I'll have details later, but for now I really really need to get some sleep. Also: Happy Time Change!

 Probably no more posts until Sunday, when YLA is over. Unless of course I can find a computer with internet access at the hotel. But now I go off to debate blatantly unconstitutional bills that the Supreme Court ruled against hardly eight months ago. (More details when I get back.) Wish me luck!

 People. They're irritating. And I wish they'd go away and leave me alone.

 Today = Really Hard. Five tests and a paper later, I'm still alive. I don't know about you, but I think that's kind of impressive. Cookies are almost totally done. I've got one more batch in the oven and once those come out I can relax cookie-guilt free. Definitely don't think my hair cut is happening tonight. Oh well. I'll just go to YLA with raggedy hair. Talking of which: YLA. It starts tomorrow. If I had any energy whatsoever I'd be bouncing off the walls. But no. I'm kind of dead. Sleep is my best friend. I miss it.

 From urlLink Nate and urlLink Madeline : Hannah, your subconscious mind is driven most by Peace You are driven by a higher purpose than most people. You have a deeply-rooted desire to facilitate peacefulness in the world. Whether through subtle interactions with love ones, or through getting involved in social causes, it is important to you to influence the world. You are driven by a desire to encourage others to think about the positive side of things instead of focusing on the negative. The reason your unconscious is consumed by this might stem from an innate fear of war and turmoil. Thus, to avoid that uncomfortable place for you, your unconscious seeks out the peace in your environment. Usually, the thing that underlies this unconscious drive is a deep respect for humankind. You care about the future of the world, even beyond your own involvement in it. As a result, your personal integrity acts as a surrogate for your deeper drive toward peace and guides you in daily life towards decisions that are respectful toward yourself and others. Though your unconscious mind is driven most strongly by Peace, there is much more to who you are at your core. What drives urlLink your subconscious mind?

 Yeah, well, maybe. Just a little. Seeing as it's summer and since I plan on taking lots of fun pics, I thought I'd go ahead and be a bit of a poser by setting up a photo blog. This template just isn't cut out for posting pictures, but I didn't feel like changing it to accommodate them. I've already put up a couple graduation pictures (courtesy of urlLink Kit ) and some pictures of Bellingham and Fairhaven. Don't, of course, feel obligated to check that blog often - if I post something I'll try to announce it here. Enjoy.

 So graduation was nice. I cried a couple (OK, more than a couple) times. Kit took fun pictures and as soon as she posts them I shall link to them. I am going to miss a number of the seniors beyond reason. Alas! I really would post something legitimate. I really would. But I am exhausted and have a headache and don't feel like it right now. I'm thinking sometime in the not-so-distant future a real update will happen. Never fear.

 Meymandi Concert Hall. BTI Center. 2:00 PM. Be there or be triangular.

 Last day of exams... school's over for the year... I'm not an underclassman anymore... life is looking pretty good. So I celebrated the best way I know how: I came straight home, made some tea, and watched "Sense and Sensibility." Oh, how I love that movie. Some days it scares me how similar to Elinor I am. And then other days I feel exactly the same as Marianne. Either way, that movie is just as good the 138th time as it is the first. Do see it if you haven't. (I'm so jealous the rising seniors get to read "Pride and Prejudice" over the summer. Why don't we get to read something as cool as Jane Austen?) Speaking of summer reading, I'm doubting I'll get to do much of my own with all the school stuff we're being assigned. There's a novel and four short stories in AP English, as well as a couple writing responses and an AP response; there's a book and an assignment in AP US History; and the newest addition is for AP French: Guy de Maupassant's "Pierre et Jean." And yes, it's the same Guy de Maupassant who wrote "Ball of Fat." Remember how that wasn't particularly the lightest or easiest read, even in English? Yeah, well, now we get to read a novel by him in the original language. I'm scared - I don't feel at all prepared for this. Granted, I did start skimming it after my French exam and it wasn't nearly as bad as I anticipated, but still. It's a lot of reading. And after all that we have to write a composition analyzing the family dynamic presented in the story. Also in French. I suppose if nothing else it should really help us all become that much more fluent, but that doesn't make me feel any less intimidated. What have I gotten myself into? I spent a good part of lunch with a group of seniors today, and they were all talking about how it was their "last lunch at Raleigh Charter" and all that. I was so jealous - I would have given anything at that moment to know that I was going to college in just a few short months. College, why can't you be sooner? And it's not like I'm even going to be a senior, although it sometimes feels that way. No, I'm just a lowly junior, with two whole years left to go. Not that I don't like RCHS - I love it - but at the same time I feel ready to move on. I'd love to meet new people, do new things, live in a new place, everything. Alas. Another two years.

 Raleigh Charter is ranked 173 for Best Teachers at urlLink RateMyTeachers.com . Let's keep those rankings coming, guys! You can leave a ranking on any teacher by going to the site and searching for Raleigh Charter.

 Everyone I know keeps talking about how much they've studied for finals. "Oh my God, I studied for like 30 hours this weekend!" or "I totally crammed for this exam last night - it must have been five hours!" And then the inevitable: "How long did you study, Hannah?" Well, that depends how you define studying, I guess. I mean, I did all the review assignments, and I thought about them. I even did some practice Chemistry things, but not too much aside from the review packets. I went over French vocabulary and verbs a little. I drew funny pictures of French people and wrote stories about them in French. (OK, so that was more boredom than studying. It still counts.) I spent a solid 20 minutes looking over the notes for English and a little for Algebra II the night before the exam. That's it, really. I feel kind of bad - last year I spent hours studying for weeks in advance. Apathy set in big time this year, especially after APs. It just didn't seem worth doing any more work. So I didn't. I mean, the fact remains that I think I know the material, especially given that I was acing most of the review assignments without having to think too hard about them. It's not that I'm worried in particular; I just feel like I should have done more just for the sake of doing more. Is that logical? Probably not. Go figure. Exams aren't logical.

 Finals completed: 4 Finals remaining: 2 Hours of school: 5 hours and 5 minutes Days until graduation: 3 On a scale of one to ten... Satisfaction with exams thus-far: 8.5 Confidence about exams tomorrow: 4 (I've heard Chemistry's really hard) Happiness at school being out: 11 I'm very excited that there's only one more day of school (yay!), but on the other hand tomorrow is my hardest exam day. I need to review French pretty badly, and I've heard icky nasty things about the Chemistry EOC. That's the problem with EOCs - you can't ever fully prepare for them because there are inevitably a couple questions that you never will have seen before. I hate that feeling of staring at a question and having no idea what to do. It makes me feel really insecure. I'm hoping to keep that feeling at a minimum tomorrow. Exams so far have gone swimmingly. English - piece o' cake. Math - not easy, but I felt pretty good about in nonetheless. APES - already got my grade back and I'm quite satisfied with it. GoPo - don't make me laugh. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that tomorrow will go half as well as the past two days have.

 I hate clothes. I hate them. I hate hate hate hate hate them. I recently ordered a couple pairs of capris from Eddie Bauer - the only store that ever has pants that fit me. I tried them on, and they were hideously off. Waist too big, thighs too small, length too long, butt way too small... the list goes on. I feel so depressed - I must have tried on every pair of pants in that store and in an act of desperation ordered the petites from the catalog. And they didn't work. So now I feel fat, ugly, and stupid. I hate this feeling, almost as much as I hate my body right about now. You know, some days I almost like being a little curvy, but when I go to buy clothes I always say, "Dammit, why can't I just be a stick like everyone else who buys pants?" The same goes for shirts - why can't I be flat? And no amount of losing weight will ever help me, because my freaking bone structure gave me these damn hips and butt and there's no getting rid of them. I spent about ten minutes in my room cursing and crying because I was so upset. I hate clothes, I hate my body, and I hate myself for being a fat, ugly pig. I'll probably delete this post later. I'm just really upset and had to get it off my chest.

 Last day of English! Fortunately enough I was able to restrain the urge to cause him physical pain for another 25 minutes, and now I'm home free! Well, except for the exam. But urlLink today's Foxtrot gives a pretty good idea of how I plan to handle that one. Speaking of exams... Tuesday: English & Algebra II Wednesday: AP Environmental Science & GoPo (ELPS) Thursday: French & Chemistry I'm not too worried.

 I just had a really really nasty encounter with a pair of cockroaches and other assorted insects that like to hover around my door. I feel like I need to take a bath in disinfectant or something to get this icky itchy feeling to go away. Ewww! So so gross! Damn, I hate bugs.

 Am happy about that. Although I find it interesting that of the four pictures of me (including the standard one) I am wearing a striped shirt in all four and three of them are the same shirt. Am I really that bland, or did they just get me on bad days? I sure hope it's the second. Am also happy about the fact that we have 70 minutes of English left. So close... Science Olympiad peoples left this afternoon for Nationals, leaving a gaping hole in both my classes and daily conversations. Come back, fun boys and girls! P.S. AJ so far wins the contest for Most Bizarre Yearbook Entry Ever. It's a keeper.

 Was tired and in a bad mood today. I need more sleep - this is getting annoying. I'm in "I hate everything" mode. And it's not fun. Especially around exam time. Stupid mood swings. I hate them, too. The only thing that's keeping me going is my new light read: "Eats, Shoots & Leaves." Read it. It's good. Well, and the fact that there's only 115 minutes of English left. Thank God. I don't know if I could handle any more than that. So to conclude (?), if I seem distant or annoyed, it's because I'm... distant and annoyed.

 For Mr. Grunden's fourth period Chemistry class: Call me crazy, but I think I may have found a way to get some of the dye off your hands. This is what I did, and feel free to test me and try any or all of these steps. I have no scientific evidence to back me up, and considering I missed Mr. Grunden's speech about acids and bases I may very well be reversing science by claiming that this works. Anyway, here's what I did and it succeeded in getting a large part of the dye off my hands. 1. A hot shower. Some of the dye came off while repeatedly rubbing my hands in the hot water, so I'm sure a hot hand bath would work just as well. Shampoo may or may not have been a factor (I couldn't tell). 2. Some good ol' nail polish remover on a cotton ball. I scrubbed that for a while and then rinsed my hands in some more water to get rid of the smell. Some more dye came off then. There are still hints of green in my skin, but the blatant color has almost completely disappeared. If anyone has any real evidence as to why this method should or should not work, or if you test it yourself and care to share your results, I am all ears. Feel more than free to leave a comment so the rest of the world can be that much more enlightened.

 Today: - Got to visit with lots of fun reptilian things in APES. They were slippery and slimy and fun all around. - Tie-dyed in Chemistry and got dye all over my hands, as we couldn't find the gloves until way too late. They look quite scary and are bound to for at least the next couple days. Woo hoo. - Got the results from the National French Exam. I placed fifth in the state and sixth nationally. Not bad. I came in second in my class - Caroline got fourth in the state and fifth in the nation (wow!). Congrats, everyone! - Umm... that's it. I honestly thought I had a lot more exciting things to say. But no. I don't. Except... 160 more minutes of English!

 Comments. They don't like to work sometimes. And that irritates me. Also, I just made some brownies that I thought were very average. It was a new recipe my mom found, and it called for espresso powder. Personally, I'm a purist when it comes to things like chocolate, and really don't like to mess around by putting extraneous ingredients in. Give me my classic brownies and chocolate chip cookies and leave me alone. On the upside, tonight is the first night in about two weeks that I actually did all my homework. Rock on.

 urlLink Sigh...

 Days of class left: 4.5 Days of class + exams: 7.5 Days until last exam: 10 Days until graduation: 12 Hours of class left: 25 and two-thirds Minutes of English left: 205 I'm impatient.

 I went shopping today, and was painfully reminded of the never-ending difficulties people with my body shape have with finding clothes that fit or look good, let alone both. Nonetheless, I did come away with an adorable urlLink pink skirt from the Gap, in addition to a sweet urlLink pink printed wrap-around shirt (definitely not the color in the picture). I'm quite pleased with my purchases. urlLink J.Jill , in a rare display of frumpiness, did not impress me and I subsequently did not buy anything. My sister, however, did come away with a cute top from that store. While in urlLink Eddie Bauer - the only, and I mean only, store whose pants even come close to fitting me - I was accosted by a saleswoman who absolutely refused to leave me alone. I tried on several pairs of capris in different styles, and decided I didn't care in particular for any of them. She approached me as I left the dressing room and asked if anything had worked out. I replied no, but thank you very much for your help. She demanded, almost in a harsh tone, to see one of the pairs on me. A little scared, I obliged her and put on the pair that had almost worked. She kept telling me that they looked fine, that they seemed to fit me very well. I remained steadfast, saying I just didn't like how they felt, that they were too tight in some places and too loose in others. Fortunately, just at that moment, my mother and sister reappeared and helped me escape from Crazy Sales-Lady. I was eternally grateful for my narrow escape. In other news: My summer reading list is starting to come together very nicely. There's no way I'll be able to finish it - there are at least ten tomes of over 700 pages each, all of very dense material - but I should at least get a head start. I'm very excited. Summer's almost here... can you taste it?

 I can't stop watching urlLink "The School of Rock." Call me whatever you want, but I think it's an absolutely precious movie. The music is good, the acting is genuine, and I'm a little in love with Zach, the guitarist. I just watched the DVD with the kids' commentary in the background, and although it was a tad irritating at first, overall it's so funny that it made up for any small (or large) annoyance factors. If you haven't seen it yet, I would offer it with my highest recommendations. It's silly to be sure, but I challenge you to find a movie so simultaneously sweet and not-teeth-gratingly irritating. Go see it.

 Go into your 25th post. Copy the 5th line. Paste it here along with the directions. 3. Every time someone asks you to do something, ask if they want fries with that.

 - Stole my mom's pink scarf when she was out this morning and wore it. Mwa ha ha. - Just a movie in English. Nothing particularly painful, and it was decently entertaining. - Spent APES goofing off, after briefly planning a mind-boggling easy project. - French was... uneventful. Just the way I like it. - Chemistry test went fairly well. I think/hope. - Fun and interesting lecture from Mrs. Newmark's husband. Apparently history and foreign language majors are some of the lowest-earning majors. Alas. See if that stops me. (It won't.) - Easy math with cookies. - Philosophy discussion went really well, more so than usual. Kit and I were reelected to the leadership team, and Trevor got a newly-created third position. That club rocks my socks. - Went home, got dolled up, and went to the ballet with a friend. While certain parts of it were fairly average, the whole second half was "A Midsummer Night's Dream," which was spectacular. It was hilarious, well-danced, and did I mention it was hilarious? I had a great time. - Got home, collapsed, and went to sleep. Ironically enough, it was the first night in the several years that I've had my bed in its place that I've hit my head on the window sill. (That part wasn't great, but everything else made up for it.) So with such an interesting and stimulating day yesterday, what have I done today? Nothin'. Not one thing. I've been sitting at my desk for almost half an hour hoping I'll somehow get the motivation to do some homework and be productive. I'm still waiting.

 They were both in my dream last night. I dreamt that I walked into chemistry with my new pink iPod in hand (unfortunately that was only in the dream... man, I want one of those) and moved to my seat. But Mr. Grunden had rearranged the room and he offered me a new seat not at one of the lab tables, but at one of the computer desks towards the back of the room. Perplexed, I asked why I couldn't sit with everyone else. He replied that he thought I might like it back here better, and that it would give me more time to do fun experiments. He then handed me my first assignment: a titration. All my concerns spontaneously disappeared, and I started jumping up and down. A titration! Yay! I immediately set to work, and as he went to talk to the rest of the class all seated at the tables, I put the earbuds in my ears and started the delicate procedure. I don't think it means anything. I was probably thinking about titrations and pink iPods as I fell asleep. Still. It's odd.

 Days of actual classes left: 6.5 Hours of school left: 37 Days of class + exam days: 9.5 Days until graduation (and possibly seeing someone I really want to see): 16 Level of happiness I feel at knowing I only have to deal with a certain English teacher for 6.5 more 45-minute blocks: 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 to the billionth power

 Given the evidence, I'm starting to wonder if my linking to a blog on the sidebar is a death warrant. There are multiple people who, once I've linked them, stopped posting all together. Witness: Brad, Heather, Kaj, and Trevor (although his posting wasn't too consistent to begin with). So many dead blogs... it makes me sad. But somehow I don't have the heart to remove them - I keep hoping they'll get a new breath of fresh air and become the most interesting and unique blogs ever. Don't let that discourage you, though - if you want to be linked just let me know, either by saying so in the chatter, leaving a comment, or if you want to be really discrete you can always drop me an email.

 That's right - no more APs for Hannah. Yay! This one also went much better than yesterday's fiasco of an exam. Actually knowing the material: priceless. But with the end of APs comes an excruciatingly bad evening ahead of me. Learn and memorize a page of guitar music, do three days worth of homework for other classes, and try to get some sleep. Eek. P.S. Congrats to everyone who took an exam - I'm sure everyone did wonderfully.

 Of the multitudes of things I was supposed to accomplish tonight, only one was actually done: study for GoPo. And probably more than I should have. The advantage: I am *not* going to repeat the APES experience from this morning. This test is going DOWN. The disadvantage: Tomorrow evening will be... interesting. And busy. And bad. Sophomore teachers need to be more sympathetic to APs is all I have to say.

 Just bombed the APES exam. Comments aren't working. Cat is sitting on the keyboard. Arg. This week needs to be over. Update: So apparently now the comments are working. Alas! This is my lucky day. (That was sarcasm, folks.)

 I really wanted my new template. So here it is, in all its unfinished glory. Just wait - it will get better. I promise. Also - if you want to be linked, email me. There's a link further down.

 urlLink I think not! The urlLink title is the best part. (You can see Kit's artistic creation on urlLink her blog . It's, er, interesting. And a little communist.)

 I'm uber-tempted by some of the new templates Blogger has. Shall I be a poser and give in to the standard template, or hold strong with this one that could use some serious revamping? I'm thinking a major reinventing of the blog look (and possibly of the self) is happening this summer.

 Environmental science tomorrow morning, GoPo Wednesday morning. I'm feelin' lucky.

 Un post en franais. Parce-que je le veux, c'est pourquoi. Alors, aujourd'hui tait... je ne sais pas. Mes grand-parents sont partis ce matin, et la maison sent trs vide. Mais ce n'est pas mal - pas du tout! J'ai ma chambre, et maintenant je peux dormir seule et tout quand je veux. Puis, les examens de AP sont mardi et mercredi prochain. J'ai beaucoup de peur, et je suis trs nerveuse. (Est-ce que c'est la mme chose? Je ne crois pas. Mais j'ai les deux, alors ce n'est pas une problme.) L'examen de gouvernement sera trs difficile, mais si j'tudierai beaucoup, je pense que je peux faire bien. La science environnementale... je ne sais pas.

Alors, pour les collges, si je ne ferrai bien, ce n'est pas un gros partie pour m'accepter. *Le sigh*... Au revoir, mes amis.

 urlLink Kit's blog yields a fun and interesting quiz. Your urlLink pirate name is: Captain Prudentilla Bonney Even though there's no legal rank on a pirate ship, everyone recognizes you're the one in charge. You can be a little bit unpredictable, but a pirate's life is far from full of certainties, so that fits in pretty well. Arr!

 A few lovely moments in the house by myself. Aaah, solitude.

 I didn't realize that until just now. Things are bad when you have to judge time by when your exams are and not by when the flowers are in bloom.

 I really miss having my room. For anyone who doesn't know me, or doesn't know me very well, I am extremely introverted. I can be good at pretending I have energy and am out in the open, but truthfully after a day of talking to people and being active I really need that time at home to recharge and get my energy back. But for four days now I haven't had a place to go. My computer and various school-related things are set up in the front room (that's where I am now), but my sister practices cello in here and it's so unbearably loud that I can't be in the same room, especially if I need to concentrate. The living room is out - my grandparents are in there most of the time and usually they're watching television also at an unbearably loud level. The kitchen, middle-of-the-house-slash-dining room, and basement provide few places to relax and be alone (the downstairs is cold and all the comfortable things have been moved to my sister's room for me to sleep on). I didn't even get to go to bed at my normal time last night because my sister was studying in her room and I can't sleep with the lights on and all that activity. I've been sneaking naps on my parents' bed and in the chair right next to me, but since our house is so open there are no doors to close to escape the noise and bustle coming from the other rooms. I know this all sounds self-centered. And it is. I just feel like I haven't gotten to get my energy back in too long, and I'm getting more and more tired because of it. I need some space of my own to be alone for just an hour. Normally I can go in my room, shut the door, and think... but not until Friday. I feel drained .

 Isn't it perfect how the memories feel the same? Isn't it amazing how the song remains unchanged? Time is wasted on money and money wasted on lust. Treat her like a lady and she'll never get enough. - Josh Kelley, "Home To Me" I love that song.

 Home at last. My Birkenstocks are still wet. This is freakish.

 In Wilmington. In a cafe with wireless access. Considering I'm running on practically zero sleep and have been up since 5:00 this morning, things are going relatively well. We got to Wilmington around 8:30 and dropped my sister off at her rehearsal. We then drove downtown with the idea of walking around, even though it was pouring rain. But did that stop us? Not with my grandparents in tow. They wanted to get around and walk, so walk (more like swim) we did. But even though we were soaked to the bone, somehow that wasn't good enough. The heavens looked down and said, "I don't think the Krakauers are wet enough yet." Several inconceivably large downpours later, I politely asked to be dropped off at a cafe so I could work on homework. I've been here several hours sitting at this table by the window with my mother, who joined me because she had a headache. My dad and grandparents visited some disappointing historic homes and walked some more. I'm glad I stayed here. I've accomplished most everything I wanted to, although I had to leave my GoPo notes at home because they were far too massive to bring in the car and I therefore can't work on the questions for this weekend. Alas. Just about everything else is finished, though, and that's a good feeling. My sister's concert is at 4:30, so I'll probably be here until pretty close to then. If you want to be a kind soul and urlLink email me , I will most likely get it and love you forever. Ciao.

 Things have happened over the past few days. - Went to one of my dad's former nurses' house for lunch a couple days ago with my parents, her and her husband, and another nurse and her husband. The food was amazing , and the whole thing was very fun. - Had a bit of a shopping spree at New York & Company. Everything was on uber sale, and I got five high quality tops for less than $45. Awesome. - Put in a looooong work day on Friday. Hopefully I'll get my first check in a couple days. By my count it should be about $150. I know it's not much, but it's something. The way my job works I can only earn up to $600 dollars anyway, so I'll get there. - Today, went to Southpoint and played in the Apple store for a while. My sister's old math teacher works there now and he was a lot of fun. And holy crap, iPods are the coolest things ever! I want one so so much... I tried the regular one and all five colors of the minis. Fun! We also bought some of the Microsoft programs made for Macs to help with file converting and things. It's all installed and happy now, and I am a happy child. - Finished "The Accidental Tourist." It was average to mediocre until the ending, where it just went to complete crap. But then again, unless you're reading "Pride and Prejudice" what more can you expect from summer reading?

 It took me long enough, but here's the "summary" of my Boston/Maine vacation, for anyone brave enough to read the whole thing. Tuesday - We arrived at the airport freakishly early in the morning (we haven't done that in a while because normally we just do carry-ons and don't have to check any bags, but we did this time) and after some brief confusion got all our luggage checked and the car parked. Unfortunately, when we got to the security line it was flooding out the door, and when we finally got to the front, my mom was randomly selected for the total-search-thing. This meant that we all had to go to the high security line, which in another twist of fate had a mother with at least five bazillion babies at the front of the line. Our plane wasn't scheduled to leave for another half hour, so we were fine, but this scary lady standing behind me and my sister had a flight leaving in less than five minutes. She started freaking out and breathing on me in funny ways, and I honestly couldn't tell you which was worse. Eventually she got through (although I will never know whether she made her flight or not) as did we. Almost as soon as we sat down by our gate, they called us to board. I vaguely remember thinking it was kind of funny that they just called the whole plane instead of the back rows first, but when I got to the end of the gateway I realized why. Our plane was a crop-duster. The whole plane had maybe fifty seats at most, and was arranged in rows of three, one seat on one side and two on the other. I had been on a plane like this once before, but that was flying from Omaha to Minneapolis. I somehow assumed that a flight from Raleigh to Boston would be slightly more populated, but I was delighted and amused to find that it was not the case. Even on such a small plane there was more than enough room for everyone, so we got to spread out a lot and take all the single-row seats. My sister and I had fun asking each other, "Do you want the window or aisle?" and then responding, "Yes." - Upon arriving at Boston, we got a taxi and drove to the hotel. We stayed in Cambridge at a very nice hotel right in Harvard Square. The location could not have been better, and we spend a good part of our time there exploring Cambridge and the surrounding area. After lunch at a pleasant plaza right outside one of the entrances to Harvard and a nap, we decided to take advantage of the strange timing (about 2:30) and take the 3:00 student-led tour of Harvard for prospective students and their parents. It was fun to see the other kids on the tour - almost all were girls - but even more fun than that was their parents, and how much more energetic and obsessed they were than their children. Put it this way: my parents are lax compared to these psychos. Anyway, the tour was very helpful, as was our guide. Although I cannot say I fell madly in love with the university, I was highly impressed, hopefully enough so to go back and spend a night in the dorm as part of an official Harvard visit. - After the tour, we went out for the most depressing Thai food I've ever had in my life, and then walked some more around Cambridge to listen to the many street performers. We sat and listened to a guitarist for a while, but were interrupted by an annoying "jazz" trio just around the corner. My dad offered to give me ten dollars to give to them to make them stop, but we then realized that instruments in the hands of the wrong people can be dangerous in more ways than one. We returned to the hotel and went to bed. Wednesday - Our second day in the Boston area was a little more exciting. We took a subway from Cambridge into Boston near the park and proceeded to walk through the park, headed southwest into a more residential area, and then circled the park the other direction and followed part of the Freedom Trail all the way to the North End, where we walked around some more. The North End is famous for two things: one, it's the end of the Freedom Trail and is where the Old North Church is located (we quickly got out of there as it was crawling with annoying tourists as you might imagine), and two, it's the Italian district. If you manage to escape all the tourist traps along the way, there is a pleasant residential neighborhood covered with cafes and pastry shops. We debated for a while going into a pastry place to have Bill Clinton's favorite cannolis, but later decided against it. I regret to say that we did not eat anything other than coffee and gelato there, but as wonderful as everything looked, none of us were hungry. - Before I move on, I have to mention two things we saw on the streets. Irrelevant as they are, these two people are probably my two best anecdotes from the whole trip. While we were walking through the park, we saw lots of begging people walking around. One man, however, was not asking for money, but simply announcing his weather predictions. "Eighty two degrees today! Tomorrow, seventy six, and rain tomorrow night!" I honestly couldn't tell you whether he was right or not, but he was amusing nonetheless. My second story blip takes place in the North End. While crossing the street, a taxi got mad at us and honked his horn. A man, presumably an Italian resident of the area, said in the sweetest Italian accent, "Hey, relax, this is a residential neighborhood!" Although I couldn't hear, the driver must have yelled at the guy because he then responded, "Hey, you want me to get your license taken away? Because I will. What, you don't believe me? What's your license number?" This exchange continued for a couple minutes, but eventually we moved on for fear of being the Italian tough guy's next victim. Anyway, both incidents put big smiles on everyone's faces. - That evening we walked around Cambridge and the Harvard campus a little more before eating an uneventful dinner and going to bed. It strikes me as odd that the biggest metropolis we visited on this trip, i.e. Boston and the larger Boston area, was by far the worst for food. How ironic. Thursday - We breakfasted at the same place we'd eaten lunch upon our arrival. While eating my croissant, a very bold finch flew up on my plate and stared at my food. I was shocked, and was so pleased that I gave him a piece of bread. After he left, another two finches came up to beg for food. As much as I loved having birds fly practically to my hand, I was a little worried about being bitten (it's probably more appropriate to say my mom was worried about me being bitten) and was forced to chase them away. Poor little buggers. - We rented a car early that day and drove to Portland, Maine. We arrived relatively early in the day, and after checking into the hotel we asked for a lunch recommendation. Seeing as we were in Maine, we thought it would be appropriate to get some clam chowder, and after communicating this desire to the man downstairs, he pointed us in the direction of a large restaurant on the water. We walked down there only to find the biggest tourist trap I've ever seen. The walls were covered in ship pieces and various other nautical accouterments. It was hideous beyond belief. However, having nowhere better to go, we stayed, and I must confess that the clam chowder was pretty good and the view was very nice. - After eating, we walked around Portland a bit. I'm not entirely sure what we expected of the area, but whatever our expectations they were most certainly not met. The entire place felt touristy and dumpy. The thing about my family when we travel is that we try our hardest to steer away from anything that attracts tourists since we much prefer to be around the people that actually live there. Consequently, although I have been to New York City several times, I have never seen the Statue of Liberty or the Empire State Building. We instead spent most of our time toodling around the lower-east side in residential neighborhoods, a place where you are not likely to run into many people who don't actually live in New York. You may understand when I say, then, that the town felt fake, especially having come from Cambridge and the Freedom Trail, both of which were fairly touristy. In a word, it felt icky. Friday - We had planned on spending two nights in Portland, but having exhausted what we believed to be, well, everything the night before, we left early and took the scenic route up the coast. Parts of it were quite lovely, but since I hadn't been sleeping very well I slept for a good part of the trip. We made a few stops along the way: we spent all of about twenty minutes in Freeport, the location of the L.L. Bean outlet store (among others), and about the same amount of time in another town whose name I forget, although I can practically guarantee that it had either rock, port, free, or land (or a combination of the above) in its name. - Since we didn't feel like getting to Bar Harbor a day early, we spent the night in Camden: another little town of no consequence on the highway. Even though it was just yet another tourist trap, we ironically had our best meal on the trip that evening. We decided to treat ourselves to a nice dinner, and found a smallish place right on the water. One of the nice things about Maine is that the further up the coast you go, the cheaper the lobsters get. I had never had lobster before in my life, and my dad decided it was high time I try it. My first lobster was, in a word, *amazing.* It was a little like a prawn, except softer and sweeter and oh so good. If you've never had one, I highly highly recommend it. And that wasn't the only good dish that night - my dad ordered that one, so my mom had salmon (excellent), my sister had a steak fillet and the biggest prawn I've ever seen in my life (also wonderful), and I had the halibut with lemon, capers, and asparagus (incredible). We also got a seafood salad to share as an appetizer, of which my favorite part was the tuna, just barely seared on the outside with an olive-y crushed sauce on top. It tasted exactly like you'd imagine the ocean to taste. All in all, it was an amazing meal. - We returned to the hotel and had an uncomfortable night there. But we were all so happy from the meal that we didn't really care. Saturday - First thing in the morning we got up and drove to Bar Harbor. We arrived at the hotel, and it was possibly the loveliest thing I've ever seen. We were right on the water with a little balcony and two chairs. I have tried to find pictures on the internet of the islands we could see from our room, but to no avail. Just imagine the most peaceful water with two islands right in front of you covered with trees and looking just as calm as the water they sit in. It was amazing. The sky was dark when we got there, and it looked like rain. Despite weather warnings, we tore ourselves away from the view and took a stroll around the town of Bar Harbor. It was a cute, albeit touristy (again!) town. However, just as we were walking, a huge clap of thunder struck, and rain started coming down in sheets. Although we had brought a couple umbrellas with us, they did not keep my sister and I, who were wearing sandals, from getting soaked. We sprinted back to the hotel, where we sat in front of the lobby fire for a while. After drying a little we went back to the room to wait out the rest of the rain. Meanwhile, fog started developing just offshore, and we could see it starting to roll in and cover the islands in a misty haze. It was just beautiful. - After the rain stopped, we walked into town again and ate at a good but very garlic-y Italian restaurant. - Walking back to the hotel, the rain had almost stopped, and all that was left was a slight drizzle if anything. We were walking down the street when I suddenly glanced up. There in the sky was the perfect double rainbow. Everyone has seen a rainbow at least once in their life, but I am telling you, not only were the individual rainbows the biggest and clearest I've ever seen, but there were two of them, one right on top of the other! We stood still staring for a full few minutes, until the top rainbow started to fade in the middle at first and then little by little towards the edges. The bottom rainbow was still there, though, perfect and crisp as ever. It was truly a beautiful sight. - And just when the sky couldn't get any prettier, we got near the marina and the hotel and saw these huge, billowing rolls of fog starting to come ashore. It was moving so fast you could see it coming closer and closer, and before long everything was covered in it. We headed back up to the room after admiring the scenery for a while, and then spent the next fifteen minutes or so out on the deck just staring at the fog covering the islands. I swear, within one minute this huge fog cloud started at one side of this rather large island and quickly swallowed the whole thing. I've never seen anything like it, and cannot find any pictures that convey what I saw and how clean I felt watching the whole thing take place. It was simply gorgeous. Sunday - As I'm sure beach people know (and not being a beach person myself I didn't really know this), the sun comes up much earlier all the way on the coast than it does here. At precisely 3:44 AM, all four of us woke up because the light coming from the not-yet-risen sun was just too bright for all of us to keep sleeping. The sky was covered in bright pinks and oranges, and even though we were all tired from staying up late to watch the fog, we couldn't bring ourselves to go back to sleep and miss this gorgeous sunrise. - When it was a decent hour, we headed downstairs for what we assumed would be the standard complimentary breakfast with perhaps some stale muffins and spilt cereal. On the contrary, it was very nice - everything was fresh and most of it was pretty decent. The fruit in particular was very good; we surmised that they must have had local berries there because the strawberries were just amazing. We also got to eat outside on their deck and stare at the water some more. The fog from the night before had cleared, and we saw that what we thought was just a couple islands was in fact a whole bunch of them, though we hadn't known because many of them had been hidden the day before. - After admiring the view some more, we got in the car and headed to Acadia National Park: the smallest national park in the country. It's about 37 square miles and some change. Why is it so small you might ask? Because it's all either rocky beach or vertical hiking. - My dad had visited this park before and had gone on one of the completely vertical hikes, complete with ladders and climbing poles. We inquired at the rangers' station about those hikes, but unfortunately they were all closed because the peregrine falcons were nesting. We settled for the next-best thing: a medium level hike with some vertical parts and some more flat parts. Basically it was like scrambling over boulders uphill for a couple miles. It was fun as hell, even if it did take a while. When we started getting closer to the top, the trees started clearing and you could see all the way straight down the rocky cliffs into the water. It was very beautiful, but my mom started getting a little scared and opted to sit down a little ways away from the very top while my dad, sister, and I continued our hike. Just a few short minutes later we reached the very summit. It was nearly a complete 360 degree view all around the park. On one side was mountains and lots of trees and rocks, and on the other was this gorgeous coast with the most crystal clear water I've ever seen, spotted occasionally with small islands. The wind was incredible, and to avoid getting knocked over (it would have been a long way to fall, trust me) we sat down on a rock and stared at the view for a few minutes. It was so beautiful and peaceful up there, none of us wanted to leave. But at last we got our strength back together and started the long hike back down, picking my mom up along the way. Somehow it seemed much shorter on the way back, perhaps because we were all a little giddy from the view. - After the hike, we drove around the park a little more, including stopping to play on the rocks right next to the ocean. (You'd have thought we'd seen enough rocks by then, but no.) We then returned to the hotel to rest for a while, since it had been an excruciating morning. We'd all gotten sick of restaurants by then, so my dad opted to walk to the local grocery store and get us a picnic. It was lovely: we had turkey sandwiches, pickles, and cheese and crackers on our little porch, which by then was sunny and clear. My dad had also picked up a couple movies while he was out, so we stayed in for a little while and watched one of them. - By the time dinner rolled around, none of us were very hungry since we'd eaten such a lovely and filling lunch, so we skipped dinner and just had some leftovers from our previous meal (we had a little fridge in the room: very handy). We then went for a few short walks in town and on the coastline, but mostly stayed pretty close to the hotel. - As a general rule, I don't sleep well on vacation. Something about being in a new bed and having to share it with my sister and be in the same room with my parents unsettles me a little, I guess. I hadn't gotten more than a few hours of sleep each night since we'd started out, so when I woke up at 1:30 in the morning to all three of my family members snoring their brains out, I couldn't take it anymore. I moved the whole operation into the only place in the room where I could get rid of the noise: the bathroom. I took a couple pillows and a blanket and settled myself on the floor in there. Although I didn't actually sleep much, I bet I got more rest in there than I would have in bed, and when I did sleep I had very pleasant dreams. Still, it was probably the most uncomfortable of all the nights, for obvious reasons. - A couple hours after I went there, I heard this loud scratching noise, like some one was dragging something heavy across a concrete floor. However, I was so tired and the noise sounded like it was coming from farther away from our room that I did not get up to investigate. Monday - Woke up early again (blame the sunrise) and went back to bed for a couple hours, since everyone seemed to have stopped snoring. I looked out the window and realized what had caused the noise I'd heard earlier that morning. Just offshore was a large cruise ship that must have arrived in the middle of the night. We speculated for a while that maybe the captain was new and made a wrong turn and crashed into a sandbar (there is a reason they call it Bar Harbor, after all) since to enter the dock you had to go around another island. But after a few hours of deliberation and the lowering of a number of small boats to help get people to shore, we decided that it had been intentional and the noise we'd heard was the ship dropping anchor. This theory was later confirmed by some people by the shore. - We had left this day open and unplanned intentionally so we could decide what to do that morning. My family wanted to drive up to Cadillac Mountain in Acadia to look at the view, but I was so exhausted from my cumulative sleep loss and a rough night the night before that I decided to stay around the hotel that day. We all ate breakfast together, and then they left, leaving me to my own devices. Since I knew the maid had to clean the room at some point, I took a book (David Sedaris' new book, as a matter of fact) and headed down to the lawn just between the hotel and the edge of the water. There were a few comfortable chairs set up there, and I claimed the one underneath a tree and read. I must have been there at least a couple hours alternately reading and napping because when I headed back to the room I ran into my returned family. Apparently I hadn't missed too much, since the view was very similar to the one we'd gotten the day before. Still, they seemed to have enjoyed themselves, and I certainly enjoyed myself, so everything worked out. - For lunch, we snacked on more leftovers from the day before. Unfortunately, we had run out of bread and crackers but still had most of a piece of brie and some of this cheese-with-port stuff left. We therefore resorted to things like brie sandwiches with pickle and salami with a side of brie. It was luxurious, but a little gross. We relaxed for another little while and watched a second movie. - In the afternoon, my sister was getting a little antsy, so I took her down to town and we got an ice cream and walked around a little. It was fun wandering into all the little touristy shops in town, all the while making fun of everything and nibbling on our ice cream. It was very nice. - For dinner, we wanted our last night in Maine to be special, so we ate at a restaurant built on top of a dock right on the water. The food was very average - even bad - but the view was lovely, so it didn't matter much. We walked around some more before going up to our last night in Bar Harbor. - I thought for a while about setting up out on the porch that night since I'd made one chair very comfortable with the addition of a blanket and pillow, but decided that I would probably freeze, and since we were keeping the screen door open it wouldn't much help the snoring problem. I stayed in the room, but slept very well. I think at that point I was so exhausted that no noise, not even my sister snoring in my ear, could disturb me. Tuesday - Our last day of vacation may have indeed been the most exciting and turbulent. We woke up very early and quickly got dressed. We did lounge in the breakfast area for a little while, soaking in the last of the view, but we soon got in the car to drive to the airport in Bangor. It was a two hour drive, and we didn't know the road. - About half an hour away from the airport, we saw a big slow-down on the highway ahead of us. We weren't sure what was going on, but we saw some cars turning around up ahead and knew things couldn't be good. When we finally got to the front, a policeman was turing cars back around. We asked him the quickest way to get to the airport, and he gave us a complicated set of directions involving lots of back ways and small roads. Pulling away from the one (very nice) cop trying to control the whole situation, I couldn't help but be reminded of this one comedian I saw who used to be a police officer in Maine. "My patrol area was about 800 square miles," he said. "My backup was a day and a half away." - As we all suspected the case would be, we got lost and had to pull over for directions at least three times. However, we were getting closer and closer each time, and we had allowed time for something like this so we didn't worry too much. The last time my dad asked someone where the airport was, they told him where to go, and then said, "It's on North Street." We all did double takes. "Wait, you mean the airport is on a street ?" "Yeah," he said. "North Street." Shocked, we drove on. Sure enough, right there on North Street just barely past a collection of shops was Bangor International Airport. It was crazy. - While my dad went to drop off the rental car (as it turns out, it was about two feet away from the airport entrance) the three of us ladies went to check in. Everyone was very friendly, even the security guy checking our luggage. We quickly got through all the registration stuff and headed up towards the gates. We looked at one of (really the only) screen monitors to check our gate. We were at Gate 1, but that was as opposed to Gate 2 or 3. No kidding: there were three gates in the whole airport. And not only that, but there were three security checkpoints, one for each gate. You weren't technically supposed to go through the security thing until your flight was within an hour or so of taking off, so we waited out in the "main" area. We had unwittingly allowed way too much time, even with our getting-lost-time in there, so we had about two hours to sit and wait. There were some children's toys in one little area, so Chloe and I amused ourselves with the Legos until some real kids wanted to play with them and we left. - They called our flight on the intercom (really, they should have just yelled at us) and we went through security and headed towards the gate. While we were waiting in line, my mom overheard someone mention that our connecting flight from Boston to Raleigh was canceled, so she and my dad went up to check out the situation. My sister and I followed in curiosity. The guy typed in our ticket number and said, "Oh, uh, yeah, there's a message on your ticket, too." (Which brings up the question: when were they planning on telling us this? Not when we were boarding the plane - they weren't scanning tickets. Stupid people.) Anyway, everyone else had boarded the plane and the four of us and this other couple also traveling to Raleigh were waiting to have them rebook us. The couple, as it turns out, had a son who my dad operated on and were also staying in Bar Harbor while we were there. Small world, eh? The couple eventually got rebooked on another flight going through a different city with a connecting flight that left five minutes after their first one landed. Since there were only two more spots on that flight, they took those and the people working there kept searching for something for us. The best thing they could get was leaving three hours later and had a long layover, and the way things were going could end up being a three-legged flight. Since my dad had work the next day and this new flight thing would make us get home really late, he asked if there was anything else. The guy said there was this other flight on another airline, but that he couldn't tell whether there were seats on it or anything. We were all starting to get confused, so my dad called the airline and asked what the deal was. First the person there said our flight wasn't canceled (what?!?) but then said it was and was trying to get us booked on all these stupid things... it was nuts. Meanwhile, my dad walked down to the other airline's ticket counter and was talking to two people at once trying to get something worked out. He was being, as he later described himself, what they call a "royal pain in the ass," but we really did need to get home soon. This other airline offered us a flight to LaGuardia with continuing service to Raleigh. Perfect! We took the tickets and ran to the other security checkpoint to catch the plane that was about to take off. - Once we got on the plane - we were the last people to do so - things went pretty smoothly. We only had to wait in the connecting airport for a few minutes because technically it was a "continuing flight" and not really a connection. One of our main worries about changing our flights the way we did was that our luggage would get crazily and mind-bogglingly lost, so when we walked to the baggage claim after we landed all of us had our fingers crossed. But lo and behold, our luggage was not only there, but it was the first to come out! Hooray! My dad went to get the car, we all piled in, and drove home. We were scarcely two hours later than we would have been had all our flights worked out. It was a pleasant surprise. If you read that entire thing, give yourself a cookie. You deserve it.

 I am currently at work writing a vacation "summary." It may be a day or two, so if you're that eager to know the intimate details of my travel life, you'll have to wait just a bit. With any luck I'll get it finished this evening and will publish then, but if not, remember that patience is a virtue.

 It's a long story, and most definitely one for another day. G'night.

 This morning, while cleaning the kitchen, I slammed the same part of my head into yet another painful surface. This time it was the corner of the kitchen cabinet, and believe me when I say that it hurt just as bad if not worse than the first time. Consequently, I have a bump on my head and I'm having problems seeing clearly. Ow. I'm also packing for our trip that begins tomorrow. We're going to Boston for a few days, then to Portland (Maine, of course), and finally to Bar Harbor and Acadia National Park. I should be way more excited than this, but like I say, I have a huge bump on my head and I can't see straight. Things are feeling a little off. I think I'm going to go take a nap.

 I hate finding typos in my old posts. And I just did. I fixed it, but I'm still upset. I feel like banging my head on a table, but I've been through this once already today.

 Went to a wedding. Took pictures, but discovered after shooting an entire roll that my camera had once again broken and failed to advance the film. Consequently, all my pictures of the pre-ceremony and of the ceremony itself were gone. If I hadn't already been teary-eyed because of the wedding I'm sure I would have burst into tears. Not only did I feel really bad (I promised the bride, a friend of ours, that I would print the pictures for her) but I was damn proud of some of them. Oh well. That's how it goes, I guess. Slammed my head in the car door. That wasn't fun. I had another awful headache afterwards and everything was kind of blurry for a couple hours. I am now feeling better, in case anyone was wondering. So now I'm sitting here, with no pictures and a large bump on my head, waiting until tomorrow when I get to go through the pre-traveling fiasco that happens every time my mother travels. I'm not looking forward to it. In case you hadn't gathered, I'm in a rotten mood.

 I went with Sarah today to see David Sedaris, one of my favorite author-slash-comedians ever. Even though I am paying for that incredible time with a nearly unbearable headache at the moment, I cannot help but feel it was all worth it. For those of you who don't know (and shame on you!), David Sedaris is a man from the area who has written a number of books - collections of essays - about his family, growing up, and being a gay man in France. His books are phenomenally funny, but nothing compares to hearing his voice on the radio or, even better, in person. He often appears on "This American Life" on NPR, and if you ever get the chance to listen to him, I highly recommend it. He has the most unique voice I've ever heard, and in my personal opinion his stories are nothing without his voice behind them. One of my favorite episodes of "This American Life" can be found urlLink here by clicking the icons on the left. His bit is the first after the prologue. Anyway, Sarah had heard he was coming into town on a book tour and invited me to come with her. The woman at the store said we should get there at least an hour early if we even wanted to be in the room, and an hour and a half early if we wanted to be able to see him. Being good and eager fans we got there a solid hour and a half early, and were dismayed to find there was hardly room to stand, even in the back. Being my aggressive self in these kinds of situations, I forced her to come with me and scout out the area for sitting room. We ended up directly behind him, but I was upset that we wouldn't be able to see his face. (The last time he came to that store my parents went to see him and also ended up behind him. This was a situation I did not care to repeat.) I therefore scooted my head around the other side of the podium only to find just enough room for two people to squeeze directly in front of the chairs reserved for the Sedaris family. After some debate as to whether we really wanted to sit two feet away from the podium and right next to the rather large speaker, we decided to go for the seats. Uncomfortable as they were, we knew we probably had some of the best seats in the house, especially compared to the poor suckers who immediately leapt upon our old spot behind the bookcases. About an hour later, the Sedaris family started filing into the three or so rows of seats reserved for them. I briefly cast a glance, fascinated that these were the real-life people I'd read so many stories about. Then, suddenly, I stopped. There was a very pretty blonde woman sitting in the front row, and she looked almost familiar. Then I realized who it was, but just to be sure I asked the woman sitting next to me, "Is that Amy Sedaris?" She nodded yes. " The Amy Sedaris?" I asked. The woman nodded again. For those of you who don't know her either, she's also an acclaimed comedienne, well-known for her interesting hobby of making herself as ugly as possible. Having purchased a book to have David sign after the reading, I asked politely if she would mind signing it as well. Unfortunately, she said she didn't want to sign until David did (an appropriate move, I think), and I was unable to find her after the reading. Presumably she took off - no one wanted to be in that hot, crowded room any more than they had to. I just thought it was the coolest thing to be sitting almost at Amy Sedaris' feet while listening to David Sedaris talk. As the starting time grew nearer, the people running the show decided to start early, citing that they couldn't get any more people in the building even if they wanted to - a statement which I'm sure was absolutely true. The room was sweltering: many people had taken their books or spare pieces of paper and were fanning themselves. A worker at the store came up and gave a brief introduction, and then David himself stood up and came to the podium. The applause was incredible. Although I had heard his voice many times before, I had never seen him in person. At first I was a little startled - he somehow didn't look how I'd pictured him. But once he began to talk, I realized the voice really did fit the face and I suddenly wondered how I'd managed to miss what he looked like. He wasted little time before diving right into the reading, which consisted of a story from the book and several diary entries, followed by a brief question-and-answer session. I won't defame what he said by trying to repeat each story he told, but suffice to say I have rarely laughed harder, or heard so many other people doing the same, in my life. He was fantastic. If you desire to hear more from me about what he said, feel free to ask, but I have told the stories so many times today I have no more energy to repeat them, especially in writing. Believe me when I say he was fantastic. After the reading, people lined up to get signatures in order of the letters they had on cards they gave out when you purchased a book. Neither I nor Sarah was for a while (we were K and H, respectively, I believe) and were both so tired and hot that we wanted to run over to Wellspring to grab a drink. While discussing our plans, a woman came up to me and said, "Here, someone just gave me an A card - do you want this C?" We immediately leapt at the opportunity, and darted over to the grocery store to grab drinks before coming immediately back and getting in line. We couldn't have waited more than 20 or 30 minutes (which, trust me, was amazing - people were waiting for hours on end) before I got up to the table where he was chain smoking and signing books. They had asked us to write our names on a post-it note before we got to the signing table in order to eliminate confusion about spelling and things like that. So when I got there, he smiled at me and said, "Are you Hannah?" "Yes," I said. He smiled. "Are you a teenager?" "Yes," I said. "How old are you?" "Sixteen." He got this excited look on his face and darted into a bag at his side. "I love when teenagers come to my shows. Keeps the audience young, you know? And I love having something to give them. " I smiled while he kept rummaging through his bag. "There's a story in the book about a rubber hand," he said, "so here you go!" and he handed me this tiny little rubber hand. He then wrote in my book: "To Hannah, it was rubber. David Sedaris." I shall treasure both the hand and the signature for a long time to come. He did something very similar with Sarah, who came right after me, except with a story about amputees that he'd told and a little rubber foot. Both the extremities provided much entertainment while we were standing together waiting for my ride after the reading. I honestly cannot remember when I've had a better time, even though as I say I am now paying for sitting right next to that huge speaker with a headache. Trust me, it was all worth it.

 Once again, am at The Most Boring Job on the Planet. I'm currently on my lunch break, but soon enough I'll have to get back to plugging in more fun numbers and struggling through messy dictations. However, I must confess that although my head has nearly exploded from the monotony a number of times, I have come to several conclusions as a result of being here at TMBJotP. 1. Smart people do really silly things sometimes. Like doctors (smart people) more often than not forget to reference carbon copies to other people (silly thing). As this causes me difficulty and more work, I do not appreciate it much. 2. Dictation offices are strange strange places. Looking at the transcripts they send back on the computer, there are several in which the fonts and formats spontaneously change. There are also a few that jump into hot pink and underlined text. As this causes me eye strain and general annoyance, I do not appreciate it much. 3. Macs are way cooler than PCs. Sorry if you like PCs, but that's just the way it is. I'm working on this computer which, although I'm sure is very nice, is not organized the way I'd like and does not have the keyboard shortcuts I have come to know and love on the Mac. As this makes my work longer and more tedious, I do not appreciate it much. 4. Because of all these annoyances that come with having TMBJotP, I am getting paid more. Since I am paid by the hour, the longer it takes me to do menial tasks, the more money they give me. So, I must conclude, that I do appreciate all the little roadblocks this job has put in my way. Except maybe for the uncomfortable chair that won't go any lower so my feet barely touch the ground. That's just irritating.

 - It's summer! - Found my knitting needles! - New pink shirt! - Harry Potter! - Elliptical trainer arrives today! - Signed up for another class at Ornamentea! - Leave for Boston/Maine on Tuesday! - It's almost 11:00 and still in my pajamas! - Bought a new song on iTunes! - Books are happy! - Had an awesome dream last night! - Ferris Palooza! YAY!

 If I were voting this election year (grr...), this is urlLink exactly the dilemma I would have . Although I know how I would ultimately make up my mind, it's so hard to vote for someone that damn irritating.

 At work. Bored to tears. The work I'm doing is literal number crunching - I take numbers I get from patient charts and put them in pretty Excel documents. Some doctors are nice and do coherent, ordered dictations. Most of them, however, are haphazard, long, and difficult to get through. I'm almost to the halfway point of this incredibly huge stack of papers with lots of numbers on them, and when I finish that I get to go out to Garner and look at more patient charts. Woo hoo! Remind me to never ever get a job in an office.

 They've taken one of my favorite books of all time: "Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West" and made it into a urlLink musical ? How? Who? And perhaps most importantly why? "Wicked" is not the kind of book that lends itself to being a musical production. It's dark, scary, and occasionally philosophical. Like I say, not really musical material. I don't understand. Although I somehow doubt the credibility of the musical, the urlLink book is most definitely worth reading. Pick it up sometime. It's great. Don't try any of the other sequels, though - awful to the core.

 It's been a lovely lovely morning-into-afternoon. I woke up early for no apparent reason and spent a good couple hours reading "A History of God." I'm taking it really slow, as it's pretty dense and I find it really interesting. No need to rush. My mind was completely blown when post-modernist ideas started showing up in early Jewish mysticism - like before Christ early. Who knew? I've gotten through the establishment of monotheism and most of the development of Judaism and have now moved on to early Christianity. Although I can't figure out exactly why I find the early Christians so incredibly irritating (maybe I haven't gotten into that part enough yet), I am loving watching the evolution of religion as it evolves with the politics of the time and human consciousness in general. Religious history, I

 Hannah, you're a Bernese Mountain Dog! No bones about it, you're a good-hearted, people-loving Bernese Mountain Dog. Down-to-earth and loyal, no one works or plays harder than you do. You put your nose to the grindstone when it really counts, but you never neglect your social calendar. Simultaneously strong and sweet, you're very tuned-in to the feelings and needs of the other dogs you run with. Without having to be asked, you always have a helping paw to lend and a sympathetic shoulder to lean on. "Communication" is your middle name, and when that's paired with your unswerving devotion, you get a breed that everyone respects and trusts. Woof! 73% of Bernese Mountain Dogs party in jeans and a t-shirt; 11% party in leather. urlLink What breed of dog are you? Hmm, somehow I think this test may have missed my personality just a little. Work hard and play hard? People-loving? Not really, no. But the last part is, I'd like to think, decently accurate. Link from urlLink McCall .

 We rented the classic "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" tonight. Although we've only watched it one and a half times so far, my dad issued the challenge to watch it 25 times this week. Is it possible - or sane? Probably neither. But hell, it's fun. Also: We saw "Big Fish" the other night. I'll try to write more about it later, but suffice to say it's great and if you haven't seen it I would highly recommend it.

 And you didn't notice the new links on the post before last, I added some pictures on the urlLink photo blog . They're fun. Oh, and there are also comment links on the photo blog. Drop me a note sometime.

 He didn't win. And I am sad.

 It's been an eventful past couple days. 1. My sister "graduated" middle school on Friday. She's very happy about that. Now we'll both be at Raleigh Charter. Way less driving and way less hassle. We're both excited. 2. I've been urlLink ROC-ified! I got a job at my dad's office doing some research work, and Friday afternoon I went in for my orientation. Even though I'm really only doing temporary independent project-type work, they still had to put me through the whole orientation process that all employees do. Having never worked in an office before, I always thought the orientation scenes in movies were exaggerated. Now I know better. Take my word for it - it's exactly like the movies. There's a dark room with too many chairs for so few people; the walls are grey; there are no windows; and, of course, there are the stupid orientation films. I and the one other guy in there with me (he smoked like a fiend and I could smell him from across the room) had to watch two: one on blood transmuted pathogens, which didn't apply to either of us because we're not clinical workers, and one on office ergonomics. I'm not kidding. There was really a fifteen minute movie on how to sit properly and arrange your workstation to suit your needs. My mind was blown. We then had to go through all kinds of insurance things and sign lots of fun forms. Three hours later, I emerged with a name tag, a pamphlet with all the doctors' pictures and backgrounds (tee hee), and a freaking huge notebook with all kinds of procedures they expect me to read and become familiar with over the weekend. If my mind wasn't already made up before, I would now be convinced that a professorship has got to be better than an office job. 3. My sister and I took a beading class this morning at Ornamentea. We made urlLink a nice double-stranded necklace that, although it isn't the prettiest thing, taught us the basics of crimping and stringing. By the time the two of us got there all the pretty color kits had been taken (I really wanted the one with pink, white, and silver) so I got black and champagne, and my sister got white, teal, and black. At least we know how to do it now, and I am itching to go back, take some more classes, and learn how to make really cool stuff. UPDATE: I added picture links to the above.

 A small word of advice - don't tell someone, especially a newspaper, that watching your wife give birth to sextuplets all within sixty seconds is like watching a urlLink "popcorn popper." That's just gross.

 urlLink This may very well be the strangest woman, as far as her relationships with other people go. I can't even begin to summarize - read the story yourself. Prepare to have your mind blown.

 Today: - Went with my mom to get, at long long last, an elliptical trainer. Yay! It's going to be delivered sometime next week. My dad had lots of fun coaching my mom in how to wheel and deal with the guys there trying to get a good price (which we did). What can I say? Sometimes the Jewish stereotypes are true. - Bought a wedding present for a friend whose wedding is next weekend. We'd been searching for something for a long time and happened upon it today in the mall. It's a lovely platter at one of my favorite stores in the universe - urlLink Williams Sonoma . I can't wait to get married so I can go to that store and register every single last thing. Mmm, yuppy kitchens with pretty equipment make my heart go pitter patter. - Also went into urlLink Crate & Barrel (the other store that makes me want to get married) and got my grandmother a gift - a Cuisinart stick blender. It's the same one I bought for my mom's birthday, and she loves it so much she wanted to get one for my grandma. - Played on iTunes long enough to find a lovely new song: Toby Lightman, "Devils and Angels." Is a new CD purchase in my not-too-distant future? Perhaps as soon as my job is solidified.

 The new Harry Potter movie - which, as I'm sure everyone knows, is coming out this Friday - urlLink looks good . The third book was probably my favorite, so I'm rather excited. Although I agree with urlLink Will that the splendor and excitement of Lord of the Rings far overwhelms anything the Harry Potter films could produce, it doesn't stop them from being delightfully sweet films, much like their book counterparts. I plan on rereading The Prisoner of Azkaban in the next few days just to refresh my memory, in between urlLink A History of God by Karen Armstrong, which I started this morning and am enjoying immensely.

 I have all these emotions and absolutely no idea what to do with them. It hurts. It really does. I really wish I knew what was going on sometimes.

 I posted them on the urlLink LJ , mostly because I felt like it. (I think I may like it better. Shh, don't tell the blog. Don't want to hurt its feelings.) In any case they're there if you want to take a gander. Enjoy. P.S. I'm having a bit of a tiff with my mother. My mood is not the best.

 And earlier than I thought we'd be, too. Awesome. There's a more legitimate update on the urlLink LiveJournal , but I thought I'd say hello here as well. Guess what time I slept in to this morning? Seriously, guess. I'll reveal the secret later. Pictures and stories are coming soon. I promise. Oh, and I got my AP scores. They are happy, I am happy - everything is happy! Later.

 So. On vacation. On my uncle's laptop that's on the verge of falling apart, so I'll make this quick. Things are going well. We've spent the past few days in Bellingham playing around and doing various other fun things. This morning we went kayaking in the bay - it was gorgeous and very fun. Tomorrow we're taking off and driving somewhere around here (I forget where). Eventually we're supposed to end up in the Olympics and Port Angeles, but I don't think that's for a couple days. We shall see. My uncle Daniel is with us now, and he's an absolute riot and is making things much more fun. I want my AP scores soooooo bad. It hurts. COMING SOON: Pictures.

 I wanted to take pictures of the lovely lovely pairs of earring I made this morning at Ornamentea, but alas, there are no batteries in the digital camera. Blast. I made four pairs all together: three in the class and one afterwards while I was waiting for my ride. Of the pairs from the class, two of them are silver filigree with pink and crystal beads, and the other is a vintage strand with a green bead in the center. The one I made myself is a chandelier-style earring with five pink beads dangling on the bottom and a white pearl in the center. They are all quite cool, if I do say so myself. Tomorrow I fly out to Bellingham, where I will be for the next week-and-some. Unfortunately, I will not be bringing my laptop on the trip, so updates are likely to be few and far between. I will, however, try to seek out some form of internet access to keep this updated, so don't stop visiting me here. (While you're at it, take some time to fill out the questionnaire below. I've been thoroughly enjoying reading the responses, although I had no idea so many people had things they wanted to tell me and didn't.) And in reference to the title, I had a dream last night where everyone was speaking in iambic pentameter, spewing romantic poems to everyone in sight. (I, unfortunately, was not the recipient of any of those poems. Alas.) It's also an increasing realization that we are who we make ourselves and nothing more or less than that. A sweeping general philosophical statement, indeed, but one I've been finding very true lately. We are such stuff As dreams are made on, and our little life Is rounded with a sleep.

 If I get into urlLink UNC's honor program , I'm going. It's cheap, close to home, an awesome education, and I get money to travel. Sweet deal. Their classics and philosophy programs are pretty well-known, which is always comforting, and the history isn't bad either. On another college-related note, my parents are actually going to let me apply to urlLink Cambridge and urlLink Oxford . In England. Turns out that going there is actually cheaper than going to a private college here, or sometimes even an out-of-state university. Crazy. Also, there are urlLink new pictures . I got bored. Sue me. And hey, did Blogger go and change on me again? I really liked that "preview" thing and now it's gone. Alas.

 I was a good citizen this morning and wrote letters to a handful of Senators about urlLink a bill that just passed the House which would start school later and eliminate teacher workdays, among other things. For anyone who's taken an AP test, you know it's not fun to have practically a month less to prepare. It may be too late, but I thought I'd write in just the same. Anywho, the rest of my day will be filled with French and vacuums. Good times in the neighborhood.

 Jon Stewart's wife had her baby. He's going to make a good daddy, I think.

 Tuesday: Work Wednesday: Work Friday: Packing (part I) Saturday: Class at Ornamentea, packing (part II) Sunday: Jet-setting to Bellingham Oh, I also went to see King Arthur today. It was OK, considering it didn't follow the story at all . I was very upset. Parts of it were tolerable, though. If you're really bored and have already seen Spider-Man 2 and Harry Potter and have money to burn, go for it. Otherwise, sit this one out. Unless, of course, you don't give a damn about the actual myth and just want to see the movie for what it is and not what it's supposed to be. (Grr.) I cleaned my room today. Mmm, clear surfaces. The only summer work I have left is my French (which, conveniently enough I haven't even started). It's daunting, but my goal is to get it all done before I leave on vacation again. Wish me luck.

 At long last, it's urlLink mine ! I'm so very excited. I've been playing with it ever since we got home and have come to the conclusion that this iPod thing is way too much fun. I've been dancing all around the house to music no one else can hear. It's great. Work finally paid off.

 I got this new book the other day. It's called "The Solitaire Mystery" and is by Jostein Gaarder - the same guy who wrote one of my favorite books ever: "Sophie's World." I read the first bit in the store but haven't read any more since because I want to wait until I get on the plane to finish it. It has a similar tone to "Sophie's World" - that same kind of philosophical roundabout feel with the occasional history/philosophy lesson stuck in. It's very exciting, and I can't wait to get on the plane so I can start it again. On another totally random note, I think there's an Australian philosophy class reading this blog. Hey there, cool Australian kids! I'll be the first to admit that Australian high school students are probably way cooler than American high school students. Their accents are cooler, they look at maps upside down... it's just better all around. (Woah. I just realized I'm listening to Australian music. Scary.) The light bulb in my room just exploded. Wahoo! I only jumped about three feet in the air this time. Tomorrow will be an exciting and momentous day. I go to Southpoint to (at last) get my iPod! Hallelujah! I'm way psyched. Unfortunately, I found out the totally awesome guy who worked at the Apple store urlLink when we bought our computer and my laptop - Casey - isn't there any more. He moved to the other store in Charlotte. Alas! With any luck everything should still go well. We're also going to find out how to connect this thing to a DSL port they have in the hotel room in Bellingham, so I just might get to update during our vacation. I think I'd better go replace that light bulb.

 urlLink This is what happens when Hannah has to wait one more day to get her iPod. She has to play with an electronic toy of some kind, and the camera ends up becoming her next victim.

 I had a dream last night. I don't remember the whole thing, but there are some parts that stand out very vividly in my mind. - There were pirate ships. I was on one and there was another one filled with bad people. There was also an island where people would occasionally go and run around on the trains. - Our pirate ship had something very valuable: an ancient something or other having to do with a nuclear thingamagig (it made sense in the dream). The other ship wanted it, and some sneaky people from their ship snuck onto ours and found out the secret way to activate it. We had to stop them from invading the ship and taking our nuclear thingamagig. - A few people from our ship went on the island to find this plate that could stop the people on the other ship. Meanwhile, the rest of us were trying to rig up some plan to prevent the other people from getting to the part of the ship with the nuclear thing. - We must have developed an obstacle course or something very similar, because I remember later in the dream having to go through one while being followed by people from the other ship. It was hard as hell. - Dr. Humble was the captain of our ship, and also the director/producer of the reality show we were all starring on. - All the bathrooms had white doors with orange ribbons on the doorknobs. Does this compete with my urlLink iPods and titrations dream for weirdness? I certainly think so.

 Sometimes I feel like this thing causes more grief than it's worth. It's nothing in particular, really, but a collection of things. Why do I feel this compulsive need to share my feelings on the internet? It's more than a little perverse when you really think about it. Somehow my jealousy, sadness, desire, personality defects, abnormalities, and general incompetence are justified when the rest of the world could theoretically see them. It makes me sad that I am that dependent on other people (even those I don't know personally) feeling sorry for me to make myself feel better. Then I think, Well, if it's that bad I should just stop. But I can't bring myself to take that step and hit the delete button. No matter how sick it seems, there is something ultimately very comforting about knowing that someone else out there can commiserate with me in my misery or celebrate with me in my happiness. That when something good happens I can tell the world, and when someone or something is driving me crazy I can have an invisible and possibly world-wide shoulder to cry on. Posting on a blog is so much more satisfying than writing in a journal for the very reason that other people get to watch me develop or occasionally fall. On a similar note, I can't stop reading other people's blogs. Is it voyeuristic to want to read someone else's life and to then get frustrated when they don't update to tell me what's going on? I think maybe I need to give the whole thing up for a while just to have a break from it all, but I simply can't bring myself to do it. I just can't. But maybe I will... I don't know. I think I'm just having an identity crisis and having this piece of the internet linked to me is part of it. Do I want it? Do I really want the records - often personal - of the past year and some months published for the world to see? I don't think so, but it feels so good knowing I can post something to let people know I'm sad, or that something really wonderful just happened and I have to tell someone. I think every blogger must go through this at some point or another - it just hasn't happened to me until now. I hate this feeling. Indecisiveness: one of my major personality flaws and yet another one that everyone now gets to see.

 That's me right now. Sorry. I just had a lovely evening out. I want to do that again sometime soon. It was nice to get out of the house. ... Good God, I need a vacation.

 More work today. This time I got to do odd jobs at the office since they didn't have time to pull the hundreds of charts I needed for my study (go figure). I read through stacks of insurance claims, fiddled around with some data I'd already gathered, and spent about five hours doing backbends and Stair Master-type steps whilst trying to file some loose papers back into their charts. There's this gigantic room filled to the brim with charts in bookcases that go all the way to the ceiling. It's pretty impressive. The problem is they're not organized in ascending order by number. Instead, there's this complicated bar coding system which unfortunately mixes them all up, but if you know where to look you can usually find what you need. My difficulty was not so much in finding the charts (although that wasn't the easiest job I've ever had) but in reaching them. The stacks were so tall I had to get a ladder, and since the logistics prevented me from taking the papers up with me, I had to climb up the ladder, look for the chart, climb down, make sure I got the right number, realize I didn't and then climb back up, find the right chart, climb down, bend down, get the papers I needed, put them in the chart, climb back up the ladder, put the chart back, come down, realize I missed a page, climb up, get the chart, climb down, put the rest of the pages back in and check to make sure there aren't any more, climb up, put the chart back, come back down and start the whole thing over. My back kills right now. Fortunately, I get paid. Awesome. I am currently only a few dollars away from my dream: Mmmm... mine.

 The Maroon 5 song mentioned in the previous post - "Woman" from the Spider-Man 2 soundtrack - may very well be the Sexiest Song Alive. (Yes, it is alive.) Don't believe me? Listen to it and then look up the lyrics. Mmmmmmmmmm... so good.

 I need a vacation. The family is starting to crowd in on my alone time. I just need to get out of the house for a few days. Thus, the countdown begins: I leave again on July 18 for Bellingham, Washington. Excitement! Also, the new favorite song is Jet, "Hold On" from the Spider-Man 2 soundtrack. For those who have seen the movie, it's the song playing while Peter is getting dressed to see Mary Jane's show. It's sweet, romantic, and gives me warm fuzzies every time I hear it. The Maroon 5 song, "Woman," is also quite nice. I'm currently listening to the soundtrack, and I very much hope to be as delighted by the rest of it as I am with the few tracks I have already listened to.

 We lit up some "fireworks" in celebration of the big event. In truth, they were more like sputtering retarded blue flames that sparked every once in a while at the end of our driveway, but they were fun nonetheless. (And just a little reflective of the way my family likes to do holidays, I think.) We also went to see Spider-Man. I saw it for the first time yesterday and gave such rave reviews of it that everyone wanted to see it. Although I got a little bored in the first part - it's a little slow anyway and I already knew everything that was going on - I must confess I found it very delightful overall. My mom mentioned afterwards that she looked over at me during the movie and said I smiled the most when Peter was sitting in his room doing his homework. I thought this was a little sad on my part, but I'm willing to bet that it's probably the truth. As a well-trusted critic and friend said, I give it three out of four stars. From my room I can hear, but not see, the fireworks at the fairgrounds. They sound nice. Curse them.

 So I stole - borrowed - the "recommendations" thing from urlLink Bethany and urlLink McCall . I am enjoying it immensely. That is all.

 Having recently discovered urlLink J.K. Rowling's website , I spent a good while playing around on it today. Not only are there some interesting tidbits of information hidden within, but if you are especially clever you can find some really fun things. My personal favorite? The title of the sixth book of course! It can be found through a portkey in the middle of the page, and from there you will find some interesting bricks... If you absolutely cannot figure it out, I am willing to share the secret with you on your request. Leave an email address in a comment (if I know you well you obviously don't need to leave an address) and I'll tell you. I spent at least half an hour trying to figure it out, and in the end it was really just sheer luck. In addition to the book title, there are a few other good scraps to be found - I think I've got all of them, but I cannot be sure. Let me know what you find; it would be fantastic to find something new. Happy hunting, and good luck!

 We've had lots of fun times together, but I must leave you now. See you next year. Also: Happy birthday, sister!

 I played dress-up this afternoon in tribute to years ago during rainy summer days. I wish I'd taken pictures. I can't tell if I want summer to be over or not. I'm excited to go back - classes are going to rock like never before - but on the other hand I love so much the relaxation and lack of stress that summer brings. I feel like I should say something philosophical here about childhood and growing up, but I'm way too sleepy. By the way, I've been posting a little more frequently on the urlLink LiveJournal than here recently. It's really just the thrill of something new, I think. You might check there if you've been feeling lonely here. But never fear! I am not about to let my internet friend of a year and some go right now. This piece of internet will remain for now, so keep visiting.
