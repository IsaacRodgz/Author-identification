 Dear Friends: Please read the second articlebelow for some good news around immigration processing (more immigration processing staff coming to Memphis and Nashville!). If you areconcerned about theissue of immigration backlogs, please attend the press conference today at noon! This event will be held at the Somali Community Center, on 201 Thompson lane, Suite 202 in Nashville.Thank you! - David Lubell TIRRC http://tennessean.com/local/archives/04/02/47583283.shtml?Element_ID=47583283 By ANITA WADHWANI Staff Writer On today's one-year anniversary of the creation of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, immigrant groups in Nashville and across the country are asking that the agency's ''major flaws'' be corrected. The mammoth department created last year, with 180,000 on its payroll, absorbed the former Immigration and Naturalization Service along with new post-Sept. 11, 2001, national security operations. ''The complaints we've heard about immigration processing have only gone up since the creation of USCIS,'' said David Lubell of the Tennessee Immigrant and Refuge Rights Coalition. Lubell was referring to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service, the arm of Homeland Security that is devoted to immigrants seeking benefits such as citizenship or legal permanent residence. Lubell said the USCIS had inherited many of its problems from the former INS and has made them worse. The problems include longer waits for processing citizenship requests and plans to increase fees for services, Lubell said. Related story. Not everyone is upset over the changes, however. The backlog in applications are ''good indicators right here that we're taking in more legal immigrants than we can possibly keep up with,'' said Donna Locke of Tennesseans for Immigration Control and Reform. The number of applications waiting for approval by the USCIS have jumped about 60% in the past year, according to a report by the General Accounting Office released last month. There were 6.2 million applications for people wanting to become citizens, permanent residents, or seeking some other immigration status by the end of September, compared with 3.9 million two years earlier, according to the report. In addition, the agency has proposed increasing application fees for immigration paperwork by about $55 per application. Immigrant advocates in at least nine other cities are planning events to highlight the Department of Homeland Security anniversary, Lubell said.

Jim Cooper's office. At least four new ''citizenship interviewers'' will begin working out of Nashville, said Greg Hinote, Cooper's chief of staff. At least four others will beef up the staff in the Memphis office, the only existing immigration service office in the state. The effort to establish a federal immigration office in Nashville has been going on for more than a decade, according to congressional staff members and immigration lawyers. The Nashville area is home to more immigrants than any other part of the state. Currently immigrants living in Nashville or anywhere else in the state drive to Memphis to do business with the U.S. Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services. The Memphis service is understaffed and overwhelmed by the number of people it has to work with every day, immigrant advocates say. Cooper, along with Sens. Lamar Alexander and Bill Frist, have met with USCIS officials for several months to negotiate for the new personnel, Hinote said. Anita Wadhwani

 urlLink Monthly Review January 1998 Frances Fox Piven and Richard A. Cloward Coauthor of "Regulating the Poor" and "The Breaking of the American Social Compact" and a distinguished professor at the Graduate Center of CUNY, Piven said today: "Tax cuts were supposed to spur recovery, but jobs are not recovering, the unemployment rate remains high, and more and more people appear to be dropping out of the labor market. Meanwhile, the programs created over the course of the 20th century to shield people from labor market instabilities are being whittled away. The Republican majority in the Congress stalls on the extension of long-term unemployment insurance, the president proposes to make welfare (which has always been the unemployment insurance program for less regular workers) harder to get, and harder to keep, and housing subsidies and even earned income tax credits are slashed. This is not a compassionate conservative regime; it is a hard right regime."

 urlLink Center for Economic and Policy Research Co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, Weisbrot said today: "The newly released record trade deficit numbers underline the fact that the United States cannot go on borrowing more than 5 percent of GDP each year, indefinitely, from the rest of the world. This current account (mostly trade) deficit has gotten very little attention as compared to the federal budget deficit, although it is at least as important. Some implications: (1) developing countries that are offering costly concessions (in such proposed agreements as the FTAA or CAFTA) in exchange for access to the U.S. market will find this market unavailable for them as the dollar falls and our trade gap narrows over the coming decade; (2) the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates even in a weak economy, in order to counteract the inflation that results from the dollar's inevitable decline."

 I received this from someone concerned about our inclusion of pro palestinian position at the peace rally. I include their email and my response. What do you think? Do you think I am off base? Would you have stated it differently? (looking forward to our rally Sat. Remember poster making tonight 7:00 at the center. We have received a lot of interest from people all over the county ( not just you usual protest goers) For example the Germantown Democratic Club. Deb Gibson has been great at reaching out to new groups. Good Job Deb. ) Email from Concerned Citizen.... I would be glad to discuss the merits of your position with you at any time. I would point out that the Jewish side to this issue has accepted a 2 state solution sice the Pell Report in the 1930's. That solution has been available to the Arabs side for about 70 years. As a life-long liberal, I have been dismayed at the romance of members of the Left with the Palestinians. The speakers listed on your program certainly would seem to represent only one side's viewpoint. But that is not the issue here. My concern is the mixing of this with an anti-Iraq war rally. Why mix the two? They are two very separate issues at their core. There are plenty of anti-Bush, pro-Israel people out there. Heck, I am an ardent supportor of Israel and I think Bush's policies in the Arab-Israeli conflict (and just about everything else) have been a disaster from day one. But you sure have me upset aboout this rally. And by giving voice to the idea, expressed by many on the Palestinian side, that somehow the supposed aggression of the Israelis gives some credence to the actions of Hamas or Hezbollah or OBL & his crew, you partially legitimize or rationalize horrific acts and a strategy that has only brought misery & poverty to the Palestinian Arabs. Can't anybody read Gandhi over there? My Response: I think this is an excellent topic for discussion. (maybe we can arrange for it in the near future. the ignorance in the US about the range of views within the Israeli peace movement and the general population in Israel is a major obstacle to overcome- for both those within the US peace movement and within the jewish community in America) I really understand your anger on this issue. The collection of activists that make of the Midsouth peace and justice center are(*see below) utterly opposed to those within the peace movement (like ANSWER) that we feel are not sufficiently anti Palestinian violence and totally Anti the state of Israel. They mistakenly embrace anything that is anti US empire as their friend. There is no one locally that reflects this reactionary wing of the peace movement. *I can't use the singular verb because we are truly quite diverse. But this is why it is important to raise and not ignore the problem of Israel. we are proposing a radically new foreign policy that places all countries and sub populations on equal footing. Our country is proposing a world empire with foreign countries serving US interests by suppressing human freedom of their own people. This has to be opposed in no uncertain terms. To remain silent is to allow the carnage and oppression to continue and expand. We stand with the Israeli (and palestinian) peace movements. We stand with the people that want what all humans want. We stand against governments that act against the interests of their own people. We are PRO Israeli and Pro Palestinians as well as pro american. We refuse to remain silent when political leaders act in ways that harm the interests of their people. The rally is about a single vision of human equality, freedom and empowerment. All people whether male, female, gay or straight, jew or Muslim, iraqi or american deserve the same existence. Our Government is set on dividing us into subgroups and pitting us against each other. We say the Empire building has both domestic and international ramifications. So we are equally against the patriot act as well as US support for Israeli settlements on Palestinian land. We see the Iraqi war as a single act in web of relations that seeks to place the US in control over the world's economic resources. To ignore the US role in supporting oppression in the middle east (iraq, saudi Arabia, and Israel) is to ignore an important tool for the Creation of the American Empire. Ghandi would not make distinctions between governments. All governments must be held to the same standards of justice and peace. To remain silent in the face of human pain is not an option. allan Please let me know if you are interested in helping creating a forum on the range of views around peace within Isreal.

 A Reflection following the poor person prayer from Tikkun Olam (Repairing the World) Midrash on the Haggadah By Rabbi David Seidenberg "How do we raise our own voices? By protesting poverty and injustice. How do we do teshuvah? By responding to the voices that call out to us, by changing how we live. Only when we answer each other's needs do our own prayers become precious. Only then does our bread become "lechem oni/the bread of answering." My reaction... What I really like about this time of of the jewish year is the Seder dinner. Its focus on justice and liberation is empowering. The needs of the poor are questions to be answered by us. We can do Teshuvah or repentance by changing our local ordances to allow more of our community members to join the ranks of living sustaninable wages. It is a first step in creating a memphis where all people who work receive a living wage. allan

He said today: "Many of the most important issues facing us -- climate change, international debt, nuclear proliferation, war, the balance of trade between nations -- can be resolved only at the global or the international level.... Our task is not to overthrow globalization, but to capture it, and to use it as a vehicle for humanity's first global democratic revolution. "There is already a global governance system in place, dominated by the rich and the powerful. We need a new kind of global governance based on global democratic principles and moral authority. I propose establishing new institutions and making sweeping reforms in salvageable existing institutions. "Simply scrapping existing institutions would not be enough. The near collapse of the reviled World Trade Organization has not prevented injustice as the European Union and the U.S. have discovered that they are in fact better off without the WTO -- they have now struck bilateral deals with most of the weaker nations, which are even more oppressive." * "In principle, the United Nations is a good idea but in practice, it helps the strong to bully the weak, for three reasons: The permanent members of the Security Council have been granted absolute power; tiny nations have the same vote as the very large ones; dictatorships have the same voting rights as the democracies, and none of the attendant governments have any obligation to refer to their people before voting. The first steps in democratizing the UN could involve scrapping the Security Council and vesting its powers in the UN General Assembly, weighting the votes of the member states according to their country's size and their degree of democratization." * "While the UN is, in theory, reformable, the IMF and the World Bank are not.... When they were established in 1944, a much better idea had already been proposed by John Maynard Keynes: an International Clearing Union, a bank operating at the international level, in which nations held their trade accounts. They would be charged interest not only on their trade deficits, but also on their trade surpluses and therefore have a powerful incentive to 'clear' their accounts -- in other words, to end up with neither a deficit nor a surplus...." * "We also need some kind of a global trading body, if the weaker nations are to have any possibility of collective bargaining. The nations which are poor today would be permitted to follow the routes to development taken by the nations which are rich today: protecting their new industries from foreign competition until they are big enough to stand on their own feet, and making free use of other countries' intellectual property, for trade within their own borders and with other poor nations. It is unfortunate that many progressives from rich nations, such as presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich, portray attempts to curb back subsidies in rich nations, such as the recent WTO ruling against agribusiness cotton subsidies in the U.S., as a negative development. Such subsidies enrich large corporations while devastating millions of poor farmers around the world." For more information, contact at the Institute for Public Accuracy Sam Husseini, (202) 347-0020

Now at the United Nations, where governments are meeting about the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), the United States is claiming that 'the NPT does not prohibit the nuclear weapons states from modernizing their nuclear forces while they possess nuclear weapons.... It would be a novel interpretation of the NPT to assert that conceptual work on a "Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator" or other new weapons designs is problematic under the NPT.' But the treaty requires 'negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date.' More than 30 years after the NPT became law, and 15 years after the Berlin Wall came down, the U.S. position exemplifies bad faith, and is seen that way by most of the world. This does not bode well for the viability of the nonproliferation regime."

 urlLink PIPA - What's New You have heard the news now read the report...the key finding is that if this perception could change, the presidency will fall... STEVEN KULL, skull@pipa.org, http://www.pipa.org Kull is director of the Program on International Policy Attitudes which has recently released two studies: "U.S. Public Beliefs on Iraq and the Presidential Election" and "Americans on WMD Proliferation." He said today: "Sixty percent of Americans believe that just before the war Iraq either had weapons of mass destruction or a major program for developing them. Few Americans perceive most experts as saying the contrary. Perceptions of what the experts are saying are highly correlated with intentions to vote for the president in the upcoming election. Among those who perceived experts as saying that Iraq had WMDs, 72 percent said they would vote for Bush. Despite polling showing that the majority of world public opinion is opposed to the U.S. war with Iraq, only 41 percent were aware that this is the case. Among those who knew that world public opinion opposed the U.S. going to war with Iraq, only 25 percent thought that going to war was the right decision.... Asked how many nuclear weapons the U.S. has, the median estimate was 200 ... the actual number of U.S. nuclear warheads is 6,000. A majority is not aware that the U.S. made a commitment to seek the ultimate elimination of nuclear weapons as part of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. However [when informed] a very large majority (84 percent) thinks doing so was a good idea and that the U.S. should make greater efforts toward that goal. A very large majority supports giving international inspectors the power to examine biological research labs in all countries, including the U.S., to determine if they are abiding by the biological weapons treaty. Three-quarters incorrectly believe that the U.S. government supports such an inspection regime. Americans show a strong preference for multilateral arms control over the use of military threats."

 TFTC Stop CAFTA Update By glencanyon@comcast.net - In this message: 1. Press Release calling on Congress to vote NO on CAFTA **************************** FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE May 28, 2004 Contact: Lesley Ramsey, (512) 507-4185 Coalition calls on Texas Congressional delegation to vote NO on CAFTA (AUSTIN) Today, as President Bush signs the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) in Washington D.C., a statewide coalition of fair trade advocates in Texas is calling on members of Congress to commit now to voting NO on the agreement. CAFTA is a regional agreement between the U.S. and five Central American countries: Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica, the negotiations for the terms of which concluded in December 2003. The Dominican Republic was also "docked" onto the agreement. First and foremost, we see CAFTA as a referendum on NAFTA, said Lesley Ramsey, director of the Texas Fair Trade Coalition. After 10 years of NAFTA, we know firsthand the devastating effects of this policy on working people everywhere. We will NOT support its expansion. Second, CAFTA fails to meet any of the baseline requirements for a FAIR trade agreement: It does NOT include adequate enforcement for violations of internationally recognized labor and environmental standards; It allows foreign corporations to bring actions against governments that pass labor, public health or environmental laws that reduce corporate profits, as they are allowed to do under NAFTA Chapter 11; and It includes rules that promote privatization and deregulation of services including education, health care, postal service, construction, transportation and water supply. Finally, CAFTA is a crucial step toward the even more dangerous Free Trade Area of the Americas--which the Bush administration hopes to finish negotiating this year. Based on the NAFTA model, CAFTA would push ahead the corporate globalization agenda that has caused a "race to the bottom" in labor and environmental standards in the U.S. and Central America. CAFTA would also include services provisions promoting the privatization and deregulation of fundamental public services. In addition, CAFTA would remove all tariff barriers in the five Central American countries on imported agricultural products. This would allow cheaply grown and heavily subsidized U.S. corn and other basic grains to flood local markets (subsidies that almost exclusively benefit giant agribusiness in the U.S.). Small farmers in Central America, already devastated by the importation of cheaply grown agribusiness U.S. grains, years of drought, and the massive fall of coffee prices on the world market, would face the extinction of their livelihoods. CAFTA would likely force a massive migration of erstwhile farmers to large urban areas to work in the informal sector or maquilas (sweatshops), or to risk a dangerous journey to seek work in the U.S. The Administration's push to implement CAFTA is part of a strategy for an expanded and equally flawed trade agreement, the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) which would cover all of North, Central, and South America except Cuba. The Texas Fair Trade Coalition is a statewide coalition of labor, environmental organizations, family farmers, religious groups and other social justice organizations working together for economic fairness in trade policy.

 While Republicans seeking the 65-million-strong Catholic vote want bishops to consider only abortion, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., provides a more balanced view of Catholic senators' attitudes toward Catholic teaching with his ranking of Senate votes on pro-life, domestic policy and foreign policy issues. Using the stated legislative priorities of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), Durbin ranked the 24 senators on Catholic positions in 48 votes, from the minimum wage to the right to unionize on the domestic front to the Iraq war resolution and Global AIDS funding on the international side as well as pro-life issues. Nathan Newman, at nathannewman.com, noted that, unsurprisingly, Democratic senators do poorly on pro-life ratings, except for the death penalty, but some Catholic Republicans are way off on other legislative priorities. John Sununu, R-N.H., and Rick Santorum, R-Pa., received the lowest domestic ratings (23%) with Jim Bunning, R-Ky., and Santorum tied with the lowest ratings in foreign policy (6%). Other Catholic GOPers with notably low ratings were Pete Domenici, N.M. (27% Domestic, 12% International) and Lisa Murkowski, Alaska (33% Domestic, 7% International). John Kerry had the highest domestic rating of any Catholic senator (95%) and had the highest overall ranking of 60.9%, followed by Durbin (60.5%) and Kennedy (60.4). "Unfortunately, recent media attention has focused on one or two priorities of the Catholic Church, while obscuring others. This has made it more difficult for Catholic voters to understand the full range of issues that have been identified by the USCCB as priorities for public life," said Durbin. "What we have done today is to use the criteria established by the US Catholic Bishops to give voters an insight into the voting records of Catholic senators." Steven Thomma of Knight Ridder Newspapers noted that US Catholic registered voters prefer Bush over Kerry by 48% to 41%, according to a national survey by Quinnipiac University in Connecticut. In Ohio, a key battleground, Catholics prefer Bush over Kerry by 42.5% to 41.4%, according to a recent survey by Mason-Dixon. By comparison, Protestants prefer Bush by nearly 2-1, while Jews and voters of other religions prefer Kerry by 2-1. Ruy Teixera, examining the 2004 National Survey on Religion and Politics in his June 2 Public Opinion Watch at www.tcf.org, found that evangelical Christians are not as solidly Republican as conventional wisdom has it. In at least one group, the "modernist" evangelicals, about one-sixth of the total, supported Kerry over Bush by 9 points (46% to 37%). And while "traditional" Catholics support Bush 60-30, they are only 27% of the total. Of the rest, centrists support Kerry 45-51 and modernists by a lopsided 61-33. And the polling data suggest strongly that those Catholics are far more concerned about issues, such as the economy, education and health care than abortion and gay marriage.

He began his life as a labor and community activist, creating the Highlander center as a place where activists from all over the country could come together and teach each other about creating social change. The Highlander center changed over the years, shifting to civil rights in the late forties (as the left activists were kicked out of organized labor) through the sixties. Then taking on issues of environmental justice, community reinvestment as well as anti racist mobilization. What remains is a commitment to cooperative egalitarian knowledge transfer with the goal of social change. What are your non-violent patriots?

Givent that:: Almost no one is talking about what happens after Kerry is elected. Therefore: : Small Progressive nonprofits who cannot participate in the election anyway, can fill the void by reminding people that long term social change does not happen by enlightened political leaders, but by grassroots mobilization of large numbers of people. Lets create a movement for a social just economy in the world free of the dependency of an oil economy and military intervention to support that dependency. Domestically we need a new aboltionism that will abolish the culture of fear that supports the patriot acts. By disinvesting in the petro-chemical industry and military, we have billions free to invest in sustainable energy, sustainable jobs, and sustainable communities. As long as there is no masses or organized people, both parties will continue to ignore the interests and needs of workers and majority of the worlds population and serve the interests of corporations. There is much to done After Kerry is elected.

 Bad news from New mexico on their living wage law... Tuesday, June 29, 2004 Coke Co. To Take 'Wage' to Court By John T. Huddy Journal Staff Writer A lawyer for Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Santa Fe said Monday he planned to seek an injunction in federal court to stop Santa Fe's "living wage" law until a federal case against the measure is decided. "When (the motion for an injunction will be filed) ... I just can't answer that," said attorney Paul Kennedy of Albuquerque. Kennedy confirmed he has talked to Coca-Cola and plans to file for a temporary injunction, "probably sometime in the next month." Affected businesses are getting their payrolls ready for increased wages and city leaders have been gearing up to enforce the law if necessary. A federal injunction would supersede state First District Judge Daniel Sanchez's decision Thursday to uphold the measure. It requires Santa Fe businesses with 25 employees or more to pay an $8.50-an-hour minimum wage. An injunction could be narrow in scope, said Morty Simon, a local labor attorney and founder of the Santa Fe Living Wage Network. That is, it could stay enforcement of the law at all businesses in Santa Fe or only at Coca-Cola. "Another issue is, ultimately, if we (living-wage supporters and the city) win the litigation, will it be retroactive," meaning, will businesses that haven't conformed to the law have to pay back wages, Simon questioned. The Santa Fe minimum-wage law was supposed to take effect in January, but Sanchez, anticipating a trial, delayed it. He ruled the law was not retroactive in last week's ruling. Local business owners and managers in state court challenged the state and federal constitutionality of the law. A group of business owners that opposed the law said it plans to appeal Sanchez's decision. No appeal had been filed as of Monday. Meanwhile, Coca-Cola contends in its lawsuit that Santa Fe's measure will cause irreparable harm to affected businesses, among other arguments. "I guess I'll have to increase the wages of my dishwashers. ... They were the only ones making less than $8.50," said Joe Hoback, owner of the Pink Adobe restaurant in Santa Fe. Hoback said that if a federal injunction halted the law, "then I would probably go back to paying them the original wage." City Attorney Bruce Thompson and City Manager Jim Romero were not available for comment Monday. City Councilor David Pfeffer, the lone dissenting council vote when the minimum-wage law passed in February 2002, said he had "a hunch that many, many businesses will just go ahead and bump their employees up to the $8.50 wage, who aren't making it now," despite a potential injunction. Hoback and other local business leaders agreed that they're not that worried about the increase to $8.50 per hour. At most local restaurants, waiters and waitresses already make above the $8.50 wage if tips are included, which the law allows in computing the wage equation. It's the increase to $9.50 an hour in January 2006, then $10.50 an hour in January 2008 that concerns business owners and managers such as Hoback. Coca-Cola human resources manager Kathy Medina said Friday that the company was updating its payroll to bump 13 of its 94 employees up to $8.50. Medina said paying $8.50 wage to the 13, who were making an average of about $7.95 an hour, would likely not "hit us that hard" economically, she said. She said increasing the wages further will. Hoback agreed. "And we also have to take into consideration compaction," he said. That is, paying more to an employee who made $8.50 an hour because of the increase of lower-paid employees' wages. Monday, city attorneys and officials met to discuss the city's enforcement actions. Under the city wage law, employees who feel they are not being paid the living wage can file complaints with the city manager. Investigation of those grievances will be handled by Romero's living-wage designee, Carlos Martinez. The law holds that employees cannot be terminated because they filed a complaint with the city, under the code's retribution clause.

 urlLink Newsblog ? %u201CFailed Conservative Policies%u201D: The Elephant in the Room When will progressives join this bandwaggon. We need to repeat it over and over again. Till everyone believes it....

 To Nader or Not to Nader... The hotest debate within the progressive/left community is how to handle the greens/Nader during this elecction. For some this is herasy either way... To vote for Nader is to asure 4 more years of bush (Tom Harmann)...To others is delusional to think "vote for Iraq War presidential authority Kerry" will be progressive on any thing of substance (Greens (both Cobb & Comeao). I take a middle stance. I think from an individual point of view, to vote for kerry in a winner take all political system is very understandable, even logical and defendable from a progressive point of view. Tom hartmann is correct, given our present system to think that a vote for a progressive third party candidate in a race with two leading candidates evenly divided is a vote for the less progressive alternative of the two leading choices. But on the other hand, should progressive organizations through their support for a clearly nonprogressive candidate. This is where I think we in the Peace and Justice community need to hold back. Should we spend our hard earned resources to support a candidate who will push nafta like legilation and increase military spending not decrease it. I think as progressive organizations (like mid south Peace and Justice) should stand back from using our meager resources to promote a nonprogressive candidate. So where does that leave us. We as organizatioons should not work for any of the presidential candidates. are we on the sideliness...no...We need to keep building a movement that will force whoever wins to respond to our progressive agenda. We shall work to change the election laws to have instant runoff voting ( see greens usa material on subject). We shall educate the population on the true mechinism for social change: an organized populace, not an election. Never has social change happend because some new person is elected to the senate or the white house. Social change happened because masses of people made it happen. in solidarity, red al > > Posted by AL to Red Al's Musings at 6/30/2004 08:19:18 PM allan lummus, Board Member, Mid-South Peace and Justice 901-722-9545 (phone) 901-355-0584 (cell) home email: allanclummus@earthlink.net MSPJ webpage: http://midsouthpeace.org MSPJ weblog: http://midsouthpeace.blogspot.com

 urlLink Scrooge & Marley, Inc. -- The True Conservative Agenda There is nothing "normal" about a nation having a middle class, even though it is vital to the survival of democracy. As twenty-three years of conservative economic policies have now shown millions of un- and underemployed Americans, what's "normal" in a "free and unfettered" economy is the rapid evolution of a small but fabulously wealthy ownership class, and a large but poor working class. In the entire history of civilization, outside of a small mercantilist class and the very few skilled tradesmen who'd managed to organize in guilds (the earliest unions) like the ancient Masons, the middle class was an aberration. If a nation wants a middle class, it must define it, desire it, and work to both create and keep it. urlLink more

But what I found is more troubling, more upsetting and more critical to democracy: Fox News is a Republican news network. It takes a Republican line, which is different from a conservative line. There are many well-meaning, thoughtful conservatives who disagree with the Bush administration about the war, about the tax cuts, about the economy, about [ex-White House terrorism advisor] Richard Clarke ... None of that is ever seen on Fox News because they consistently support the political line that the Republican party will take at any given time, which is different from a conservative philosophy or approach. urlLink for more

Equally debilitating, however significantly less well reported upon, is the continued political and economic occupation by the Bush administration and its corporate allies
