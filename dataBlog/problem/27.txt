 Shep just mentioned that he's not going to the Yankee/Red Sox game tonight because"Leventhal" is having a party. Where's my invitation????

 Possible Rick Alert! Rick was on Fox & Friends this morning reporting on the ferry crash and could be making more reports today, so keep an eye out. Natalie - I'm sorry that you missed some hottie sightings. (We may have seen the last of Jeff until he gets a new story to report on.) I was surprised to see Todd show up in a live report on H & C. Of course, this had to be followed by an appearance from Geraldo discussing the accident.

 Hey gals.... Aw crap- I didn't check the blog last night and assumed that the hotties (save for Jeff) were absent yesterday so I'm taping over yesterday's stuff.....*sigh* Oh well- it's par for the course for this week and there's nothing I can do about it now. They'll be on again! :-P I sacrifieced H & C for the Cubs/Marlins game. I guess I should have watched H & C knowing the turnout now of the game. You know what's scary about that ferry accident is that I can also choose to take the ferry from San Rafael to SF (esp. now since I've found out this week that the bus I normally take to the City when Kevin's off has more or less been axed). I already know of one thing that can happen as it's happened to us: a mechanic working on it before we brought it up from San Diego accidentally dropped a bolt in the engine area. Well, that little bolt caused the shifter (I think) to jam and Kevin couldn't stop the boat & the bowsprit ended up on the dock (in San Diego). It was deemed safe so they started out. Had to pull into Santa Barbara because the bowsprit was busted- they could have lost a lot of rigging, not to mention their lives (as the weather was being difficult on top of all that). I went to work tallying up all the reasons to back up a $35,000 insurance claim (which was settled) to pay us back for the docking fees in Santa Barbara, the empty dock fees we were paying in San Rafael, the rent of our house that we wouldn't of had to keep renting, and the repairing of the bowsprit. So, who knows what the Ferry accident was due to- could be sleep deprivation, alcohol, drugs, or a mechanical error. I saw that and the first thing I thought of was what happened to Kevin. AAAAARRRRRRRGGGHHHH I'm so frustrated this week with people at work. I'm seriously holding myself back from throttling someone. People who think they are God's gift to *whatever* drive me crazy. Oh yes, and she never admits she's wrong- when she is quite often. Thank God Friday is tomorrow. Anyway, a particular someone is already climbing down my throat so I need to get to work. I'll check in at lunch, if I get one.

 Todd Connor Alert! Todd is on Hannity & Colmes right now reporting on the Staten Island ferry accident.

 Rick was on today's Fox Report doing a story on a weird art project in NYC. If any of you have it on tape, notice Rick's hair in the front. It's sort of falling down over his forehead a bit. I like it. For those who missed Rick, he's wearing a brown suit (coat unbuttoned) and an orange tie. (Yes, orange!) It looks good with the suit, though, and I'm noticing once again how broad his shoulders are. I thought that he would be covering the Staten Island Ferry crash today, but he must have been unavailable. Todd Connor was also on Studio B, reporting on a newspaper that's being given away in NYC. Todd was wearing a brown sweater and a leather jacket. His hair was too slicked back for my taste. Someone will have to volunteer to go run her fingers through his hair before his next appearance. Lol! Jeff was also on Studio B and has been on quite a bit today. Natalie - I'm sorry that things have been so stressful at work, and I certainly hope that conditions will improve. The Cosmo comments: If Greg K. really did make those comments, his "bad boy" side doesn't make me like him any the less. It's reasonable to assume that plenty of women (some of questionable virtue, no doubt. Hee!)come on to him, so what does anyone expect a young, single, red-blooded male to do? Lest we forget, he's also a Marine. Program Reminder: Bill O'Reilly will be on the Tonight Show tonight.

 Hey gals! I finally have a few minutes to post! I think I've given all I can give in the last few days. I think I lost myself along the line somewhere, so if anyone finds me, PLEASE let me know. ;-P I thought I really had a chance of seriously maiming people yesterday- thisclose. I think I'm past 'tying my shoes'- I've moved to the next step. Blunt & sarcastic, taking no prisoners. I'm at that point that I know I'm going to PO someone, so it doesn't matter whose apps, changes, etc sit- I can't do them all at once. But, I'm also at that point where I'm really frustrated because all I've heard is you aren't doing this, this isn't right, this shouldn't have been held so long, etc. I *know* that probably 70% is out of my control, so I try to let it roll off. It just makes one feel so downgraded and insulted, I guess. Well, if they don't like it they can take a hike; I'm out of answers- deal with it. ;-) Geez, has it really been since *Sunday* that I've posted??? That's a record for me. Even though I subscribe to Cosmo, I broke down & bought the newsstand copy 'cause I was so curious (and heaven forbid if the USPS loses the Nov. issue....). It was....interesting. Not what I would've expected Greg to say. AH- Isn't his birthday in December?? I can't remember- I thought I saw that somewhere, but forget where now. I thought he was a year younger than me (I'll be 35 in November). Jayel- LOL- you said it well about Greg's comments in the article! It's good to know he has a fun side. Figured it had to be in him somewhere. Other than Jeff G., it's been a slow hottie week. I saw the repeat of the Cavuto show with the psychiatrist- what a lame brain & YAY for Neil for standing up to her. The woman was a true idiot. I like that idea of a Shep & Rick spot (ala Dennis Miller) once a week. Nan- I second you on Sherry's success- she's a great inspiration! :-) LOL- guys and their movies! We have our "chick flicks" guys have their "guy flicks" I guess, huh! Don't feel guilty about my organizing- I still have five-fold the amount that I actually got done this weekend, LOL! I have more in store this weekend...and next....and next. ;-P Sherry- CONGRATS ON THE WT. LOSS!! :-) Excellent! You ARE an inspiration. I think I'm stuck on a plateau or not paying enough attn to what I'm eating. I am journaling again though, and that always helps me stay more on track. Doesn't it always seem to be the case when they let you take one page of notes that you end up feeling like it didn't help at all? I don't think that ever worked too well- I think it's a professor conspiracy ;-P Good Luck on your exam tomorrow! Yep- alcohol is a perfect example of empty calories. I make myself choose between the wine & dessert (at least with ice cream I get the calcium benefit, lol!). Keep motivated and if you ever need that boost, email away! Teri- Hey girlie! I sent you a large envelope today with some pix & a 'pithy' *not* letter! ;-P Gotta go- running late as usual. I'll check in later- have a good one!

 Hottie Alert! Jeff Goldblatt was on Fox a few minutes ago reporting on the Cubs. He was wearing a light blue shirt and a leather jacket and looking yummy! It sounds as though he may be making more reports today.

 Hello everyone! I hope you all had a fun Columbus day week end! Jan- I live on Ft. Ord. Next to Montery.Ca. You would think that CA would have better cable! I agree with the other comment that, Fox is no 1 and brings in more money than CNN. So get Fox! Whatever. Thank the good lord for radio and Sean! Took my daughter to the dentist. Good check-up! I'm the only problem child...2 cavaties after 30 years!Alas... Take care and slan leat!

 Fox Hottie Alert!! Jeff G was just on Fox News Live (11:53 est for those who tape) and he is covering the Cubs. And he looks hot if I must say so.

 Good Morning Ladies!! I forgot to post my Weight Watchers update yesterday but I lost another 2.6 pounds for a total of 13.4 my first 3 weeks. I was pretty excited. I'm hoping to hit 15 pounds next week. Took my Accounting exam this morning and it wasn't that bad but not really sure how I did. He did let us take one page of notes to the class so that helped but of course there seemed to be more questions that I didn't have notes on. Ugh!! I have another exam on Thursday and then I'm done mid-terms. Yeah. Which means I should be studying and not spending time on the internet but right now I'm too tired to study. Where are all the hotties?? I'm going through major withdrawal here. Of course I haven't had much time to watch so they may have been on and I missed it. I at least try to catch Studio B and The Fox Report. Nat - Yes beer is only 2 points and I'm not sure about wine because I'm allergic so I don't drink it. I try not to drink too much because it is just empty calories and I would rather spend them on food but once in awhile it is nice to have a beer. I can't belive my willpower. I usually would have quit by now but I'm feeling really motivated. Hopefully I can stay that way. Nan - I don't know where this discipline is coming from. Normally I don't have any but I'm hoping it lasts. Jan - Your girls weekend sounds fun. AH - Thanks for posting the article. Saved me from having to type it. Jayel - I agree that I think Rush will come back as strong as ever if he can beat his addiction. Well gotta go, talk to you later.

 Sherry - I just caught Jeff. He's wearing a jacket and looking really cute. For those of you who didn't see it, Jeff was standing outside and was under a roof of some kind, but it was raining in the background. It's not quite the same as a wet Jeff, but as close as it gets. Lol!

 Hi LevenGals! Jan - A girls weekend!! Sounds like you had a great time. I don't have any sisters or daughters so I'm holding out hope for a 'LevenGal Weekend". Give me a holler next time you're on AIM. Been a little busy at work the last few days but it should settle down later in the week. Sherry - You're diet disciple is inspiring me. Keep it up!!! Leslie - No, it's not you - Shep does seem to have a hard time reporting the more delicate details in the Kobe case. As for hubby's "rest of his life" if the Red Sox win - not sure - there's something almost noble in his suffering all these years. LOL After watching "The Ring", are you ready to return to the safe world of Pooh Bear? Hubby and son went to watch "Kill Bill" (for the second time) tonight - not me, too bloody and gory. Holding out for "Runaway Jury". Jayel - That is too funny about the billboard. Gotta love FNC's sense of humor. Nat - You're making me feel guilty with all the organizing. LOL A H - Thanks for posting the article about Greg. Surprised by some of his comments. Jen - Hope that doctor of you figures out what's wrong and soon!!!

 a h - Thanks for posting the Greg article. I think that we should email Fox and ask them why they've said nothing about this article on Fox & Friends, Studio B or Fox Report. It's favorable publicity for one of their reporters, even though I'm not sure that Greg made all of the comments attributed to him. Although the comments about women seem at odds with his general demeanor, if he did make them, it at least shows that he's a normal, red-blooded male who enjoys women. We certainly wouldn't want the alternative! I don't think a single hottie has been on today (not including Shep since he's on every day), but I am relieved that none of our favorite guys are covering the Kobe Bryant trial. Some of the stuff being discussed is embarrassingly graphic and not meant for our guys' delicate ears. (Rushing around and clapping my hands over the ears of Rick, Jeff, Greg, Adam, Todd and Dan) Lol! I'm hoping that Shep and "Tricky" will be back for more baseball conversations. It's such fun to hear them discussing a non-serious topic like baseball, even though I'm not a baseball fan. I'm SURE that you all have been anxious to hear more about the new Al Gore TV liberal news channel that's being developed to combat Fox News. Bad news for battery operated Al! He's been advised that viewers won't go for a liberal news channel, so now the idea is to develop a hip, youth oriented news channel that will be a cross between CNN and MTV. Well, we'll see how it goes. Natalie - I don't usually see Neal Cavuto's show, but he was discussing Rush today with a woman psychiatrist, who was obviously biased against Rush. He kept saying, "You don't like Rush, do you," and did a great job of bringing out her bias. Yea for Neal! If Rush can beat his drug dependency, I think that he'll come back as strong as ever. Wouldn't it be great if we could have a live Shep and Rick segment every week the way that Hannity & Colmes has a taped segment with Dennis Miller each week? I'll bet that this idea has never even crossed the minds of Fox execs. Sigh! With such a total lack of hotties today, let's hope that means that they will show up later this week.

 Hi all! Sherry already talked about this, but I thought I would post this amusing article on the blog. Think he's kidding about some of the answers and trying to be cheeky! They got his age wrong though--he won't be 34 until a few more months right? Anyway, enjoy! I can't post the pic that came with the article for some reason. Jen, did you get my email? Cosmo men Hunks across America Southeast Bachelors Photo: Eric McNatt Georgia Greg Kelly Atlanta, reporter for Fox News Channel Email Greg Age: 34 Why he loves his work: "I've always been interested in current events. Journalism appealed to me because I like seeing the action firsthand." Ideal date: "Curled up on the couch, watching a Simpsons DVD marathon." Perplexing femme fetish: "I'll never understand why women are so into shoes." Hottest way he's been hit on: "A woman came up behind me at a party and said, 'You're under arrest.' We left and had our own private party." Wow him by wearing: "I'm a huge soccer fan, so cleats and nothing else."

 Hey gals! I'm finally getting around to posting this weekend- this is actually the first time I've turned on the computer this weekend. I went through and boxed up some books for storage and reorganized some stuff. I feel like I only got 1/4 of the way done; I have so much left to do but I got 4 boxes of books (these are like paper boxes) and two boxes of latch hook and other needlework crafts that I will work on later. He's lucky enough to get the day off tomorrow (Columbus Day) so he's going to take them over to the storage unit tomorrow. I watched 2 out of 3 of my tapes from the week; Rick & Shep were so funny on Studio B on Friday! The Cubs lost today :-( Better luck Tuesday, I guess. It's official: I'm super sick & tired of hearing about the Kobe case. Teri- Actually you could only see the upper pocket area of Rick's jeans- not a full shot. They've had other segments though where he's wearing jeans though.....I'm tellin' ya, satellite's the way to go! ;-) Jayel- You're welcome for the Rick alert! ;-) It looks like he made a few appearances that day- now watch it'll probably be another week before we see him again. LOL, I saw that billboard segment on Fox & Friends- that was just too funny. I hope Rush is able to break his dependency too. Like my hubby said, the libs will probably make a big deal out of it just because he's a conservative. Like *they've* never had people with dependencies....it's really a shame that they just can't leave him alone. Now that you mention it, I was wondering about the whole "boss" comment too. When I heard it, I thought he was just joking around, maybe some inside joke between them. That was such a good segment- had to rewind and rewatch a couple of times. I agree with what you said about Jeff Goldblatt. Maybe they'll give more to him to cover as well. Nan- I *love* having cereal for dinner- even if my hubby thinks I'm crazy for it. I think I ate half a box of Lucky Charms once as a sort of 'comfort food'. My all time favorite comfort cereal though is cream of wheat with brown sugar. I'd love to have the Cubs & the Red Sox in there, but I'm not sure how likely that is. Wow, sounds like Amber & I were there at SFSU about the same time- I started in Spring 1996, but didn't change my major to English/Creative Writing until Fall 1997. She probably has Pete Wilson's stamped signature on her diploma; I'm pretty sure Davis came to office in 1998. That's cool that your son will have Ahnold's on his! ;-) I agree- Rush will be in our prayers too. Sherry- Congrats on sticking to your diet & Curves! :-) LOL- girl, you read my mind on that jeans camera shot....I was like, "keep going! what's wrong with you?!? Keep going!!" LOL! I kept rewinding to see if I missed something....I didn't but the camera man did, LOL! Good luck on the midterms- I'm sure you'll do great! OMG- Greg's in the Nov. Cosmo?? I haven't rec'd my issue in the mail yet- should be anytime soon. I just went through October's I think....when I saw your post I had a slightly anxious thought that I went through November's and completely missed it. **whew** Glad that wasn't the case. That's so cool that he got picked! Good for you that you didn't eat anything! If I remember correctly, lite beer is less points than red wine. Unfortunately I just don't like beer- I've tried it time and again, but it doesn't take. You *should* feel good about being 'good' at the party! That's willpower! Jan- The "Girls Weekend" sounded fun- that's a great idea and tradition. Glad you had a great time! I think most of my blood related family members are girls too, now that I think about it. The pocket thing was on Fox Report on Thursday- he was talking about the "curse of the Bambino" & reached into his pocket for 27 cents to put on Babe's grave. I'm pulling for the Cubbies too- I take it you saw that game yesterday (Saturday)? Wow, what a game. I was so disappointed with how they did today, but will keep my fingers crossed for Tuesday. You know, I was thinking the other day how approachable Rick has been, and as you said "so eager to please us LevenGals"- that's so true! Sometimes I think he's surprised that he has fans, LOL. Leslie- I survived, but wow.....Friday was great (even if I just saw the coverage today). Where *is* Melissa??? I hope things get better with Roy's job; that's scary when it gets to that point. I always find that somehow we land on our feet too. Hang in there, we're all thinking & praying for you. That was so funny when Shep was talking about what Red Sox fans would be miserable about for the rest of their lives if they won. I'm pulling for them though- even though our Fox guys are rooting for the Yankees. Dry cereal could be good to snack on.....but it's not the same without milk. ;-) LOL, LevenHussy! Where do I sign up?? Any room for ToddHussies too? Or would that be ConnorHussies? Swooning definately sounds better than hyperventilating. Good analogy. Jen- I hope your inept MD figures out what's going on & soon! Is it too late to get a 2nd opinion? Do you have to stay with this same MD? They should be able to tell you or help you as to why you can't eat w/o becoming ill afterwards. I wish there was something we could do to make you better! You've been in my prayers, and prayer is powerful stuff. I haven't checked my email yet (since Friday), so maybe you've explained the dream more- but girlie you have my curiosity up now! LOL! Was Todd or Rick the Fox reporter? ;-P Don't worry about leaving an away message on Friday! I wish I wasn't "away" on Friday- it wasn't planned that way. Friday was more like a Monday to me- rushing around & stuff. I kept thinking, "aren't Fridays supposed to be more calm than this?" My manager *did* buy an ice cream cake for us (just for fun) though- and despite the temporary insanity (throwing the diet out the window), it hit the spot. Well, I gotta check email yet & also the status on the mis-zipcoded order. I guess I'm going to have to try to beg & plead with UPS to deliver to the 94111 zip code instead. :-/ Ya'll have a good one!

 Hi Gals, I spent the weekend in Wisconsin Dells with the other female members of my family. For the last 8 or 9 years we have had a 'Girls Weekend'. Most of my blood-related family members are girls so it works out great. We rent a cabin and celebrate milestones (this year my aunt turned 50, and my grandma turned 80), eat, sleep, play with my 8 year old cousin and just generally gel out. We had wonderful weather this year, and the leaves were just about at their peak. It was a great weekend! I see I missed a crucial 'talking point' as I left on Friday at noon. Did it look like Rick was reaching for something.......or just casually putting his hand in his pocket???? I would have 'swooned' too, but I missed it :-( We actually watched a lot of sports for a 'girls' weekend, but we have to keep an eye on the Cubs, this could signal something more sinister if they actually win.....I agree on the Sox-Cubs series, I'm sorry Shep, but you gotta share the wealth..... Jen, good to see you posting again, I haven't been on AIM yet, I just get too lazy, I will get my butt on there soon, I promise. You take care of yourself...... Nat, I know how low those Blue Angels fly, they were here a few years ago and they are amazing to watch..... Sherry, what does the article on Greg say? It's amazing he made that list, not because he made it, but because they recognize that he is such a popular guy.....You should send Rick another email, he is so eager to please us LevenGals....:-) Teri, what backwoods hole do you live in that doesn't get Fox??? Even my parent's backwoods hole of a town gets it, and they don't allow parking on the street overnight so the whole town parks their cars in the front yards....no joke. At least Rick emailed you, that's cool! Leslie, I'd like to order a loaf of that pumpkin bread, do you take debit cards??? Or, I'll just send an R movie your way, any preferences? Nan, don't even mention Jesse Jackson in the same paragraph with "Tricky", Rick soo deserves better...

 Hello Levengals!! Hope every is having a great weekend. Thought I would take a break from studying to do a quick post. Got my Cosmo magazine and it is their Hot Guys Issue (Nov) and they have a section where they pick a hot bachelor from every state. Well Greg Kelly got picked for Georgia. If anyone wants me to share what the little piece says let me know and I will post. Well my best friends little boy that I babysit for turned a year yesterday and I went to his birthday party. It was fun and I didn't eat anything at the party (I did have one Lite beer though - but counted the points). I had lunch before I went so I wouldn't be hungary when I got there. They had chips, cake, cheese and all that other good stuff but I resisted. I felt pretty good about myself. Well I gotta get back to the books. I'll post more tommorow. Oh and by the way I'm going through Adam withdrawals already - haven't seen him since Thursday but at least we got to see Rick a couple times. That was nice for a change.

 Hey everyone Well I think this is the first weekend in about 3-4 weekends that I *haven't* been in a doctor's office/ER/Hospital so I figured I'd sortta celebrate and post. So the ineptitude (SP?) of my own doctor continues to wonder and frustrate me -- I could go on forever about him but I won't because I'm trying to have a somewhat good day after a pretty sucky night :-( well I had an endoscopy last weekend - nothing, Thursday I had a nuclear study that knocked me out for the rest of the day - results still pending. No one says I can't eat and even I don't say I can't eat - I can eat, but I just become violently ill afterwards, I am really afraid it's some sort of undiscovered cancer that will be found in me because everyone *everyone* in my family dies from some sort of cancer -- the last person to die of just good ol' natural ol' age in my family occured back in 1982 - everyone else since then has died of some sort of cancer, my doctor told me I'm too young for it to be stomach cancer but then again it is *my* doctor who said it and I have no faith in him. So much blood work, I've gotten blood drawn just about 2 times per week this last month and if it's not blood it's IV's and my hands are bruised and sore :-( did I mention mid-terms are next week yet? Leslie: I thought about you most of the night, I hope that Roy feels a little better by the call-in tonight or at least can hold out a little while longer -- you know, I had no batting practice dreams like you did but it was weird, I had some sort of funky cross-over dream with you, a Fox reporter, me, my trainer and Natalie.. Melissa: Yay yay so good to talk to you yesterday :-)) you *must* come to the blog more often but I can't exactly tell you what to do w/ the blog I mean look at how I am sometimes ;-p I never got to ask you but were you intrested in joining me and Natalie's fact finding quest?! Natalie: My fellow plane chicken no. 1 girl ;-) I saw your away message yesterday but didn't get a chance to leave you a sassy lil' away message or e-mail :-( I shall make it up to you though this weekend :-) Alright that's it for me again for a while - everyone take care until I get back.

 Leslie - I can understand that you're concerned about your husband quitting his job. Without knowing any of the specifics, all I can advise is that it's best to have another job firmly lined up before quitting and that most people who quit a job are ineligible to draw unemployment. The Fox & Friends crew didn't mention who came up with the billboard. The billboard does put the screws to CNN, but if the positions of CNN and Fox were reversed, I'm sure that CNN would do the same sort of thing. Tony Snow was in on the discussion about the billboard and mentioned that Fox was a friendly, happy place to work and that no one was sticking a knife into anyone else's back. He joked that at CNN everyone was supplied with boxes (for packing) because people keep getting fired from there. Sherry - Rick and Shep were cute together. There's no way to miss the kind of ease they have in talking with each other, and they both have so much personality. (It's curious how some reporters or anchors are so successful in giving glimpses of their personalities, while others seem almost robotic.) Does anyone have any ideas as to why Shep referred to Rick as "Boss" at the end of their segment? I've never heard Shep say that before. It was so nice to see several Rick appearances yesterday. Jeff Goldblatt was also on Fox Report yesterday. His report was short, unfortunately, but he did look delectable in a long-sleeved shirt. I wish that he could get another big story to cover. He's one of those reporters with personality plus, as he demonstrated while covering Hurricane Isabel. BTW, ladies, this is something to consider in regard to emailing Fox about our favorites: I read someplace that TPTB in television consider that every opinion expressed represents 1000 other people with similar views, but who don't bother to contact anyone to express their views. Nan - I sent you an email. Melissa - Please come back and join us. Real life can wait. Lol!

 Well, thank goodness, three of the LevenGals survived LevenJeans '03. Boy I miss Melissa. Girl, hope you're doing okay. Spent last night tossing and turning and worrying. Roy's an eyelash away from quitting. Not a good thing in today's job market, but we always manage to land on our feet. It's just us girls this weekend. Going to get the pie pumpkins packed, and make some pumpkin bread. It's cool and windy here, reminds me of the Blustery Day in Hundred Acre Woods. Somebody please send me an R-rated movie. Please. Sherry - shame on you, you LevenHussy. I think we should start using "Leven" like McDonald's uses "Mc". Good luck on the mid-terms. Been there, done that, looks like I'm going to be there again soon. Nan - I'm so glad you're recovering. But I know since you are also a ShepHerder, you'll probably recover sooner. I haven't seen that Gap commercial, but my imagination is casting Shep in the role. Is it me, or does he look a little embarrassed when talking about the Kobe Bryant details? Ask your husband what he would do with the rest of his life if the Red Sox actually win the Series? I've always wondered if there was life beyond the curse. When I said dry cereal, I meant really dry. We had no milk. Jayel - How funny! I wonder who masterminded the billboard? It's nothing more than CNN deserves, bunch of snooty, uptight, self-important bozos. Teri - Maybe we should send your cable company the ratings that Jayel posts. Draw them a picture. "See? More people watch FNC than CNN? Understand? More people, more advertising money?? SEE?!" Nat - I'm sorry I brought tears to your eyes in front of your co-workers. At least it wasn't a bladder control issue. My first reaction when I saw how his jeans fit wasn't "Hmmm, nice." It was "OMG, someone better catch the LevenGals on the way down." I was torn between swooning and hyperventilating; chose swooning because it's more romantic and nobody looks good gasping for air like a tuna on a boat deck. The girls don't have school Monday so we may have to sneak off to the movies or something. Ya'll have a good weekend.

 Wow the board was hopping yesterday, it must of been those Rick sightings. LOL!! Well I had a really good week on my diet and even made it to Curves 4 days. Hopefully the scale will show it on Monday. I have midterms next week in two of my classes so I'm busy studying with those. Nothing else really happening. Looks like rain today on the east coast. It is definitely a fall day. Leslie - LMAO, when they showed Rick and I realized he was in jeans I was hoping the camera would keep going lower and lower but no luck. Jayel - I saw Rick on Studio B and how cute where the two of them. Nat - Well hopefully they will get your order to the right place. Well gotta go and get ready for a birthday party. I'll talk to you ladies later.

 Hey LevenGals! Leslie - The doctor tells me my consussion is healing nicely and the headaches should go away in a few days. As for my heart rate, that probably won't settle down until the weekend when Shep takes a few days off, but then again if I happen to see that Gap commercial with the guy getting in and out of bed in the relaxed jeans it's doubtful my heart rate will come close to normal any time soon. LOL I too am having a hard time rooting against Sheppie's Yankees, but hubby is a life-long Red Sox fan so it would be nice for him to get out from underneath that curse. What's wrong with dry cereal for dinner? Dry Crispex is my favorite. Nat - Amber graduated with her BA (English-Literature) from SFSU in 1997 and she'll graduate with her MA (Physcology) in December from Golden Gate College. Hopefully she'll finally be able to earn a half-way decent living in the city. Didn't notice the stamped governor signature on her dipolma but it probably was Davis, but my son, Brendon is graduating in May which means he'll have Ahnold's stamp on his. Wonder how much it will be worth to autograph collectors? Jayel - My son wants me to go shopping with him tomorrow. Hmm probably wanting to go shopping with my wallet is more accurate. LOL Anyway, I'll ask him how to fix the problem of not being able to able to receive that video. Ditto on your sentiments on Rush. I heard his radio show today and I almost started crying when he admitted his addiction. He will definitely be in my prayers in the coming days. EDIT - checked with sarcastic son - he said it's probably because the video clip is a larger file than hotmail allows - soooo if you're up for it let's try my other email address: rappn@taxationpros.com

 Natalie - Thanks a bunch for the Rick alert. I managed to catch him today. When he was on with Uma (won't attempt her last name), he made some funny faces at the end of his report. He reminds me of a big, huggable teddy bear. I'm hoping that Rick will be on Studio B with Shep today, but you never know how these things will go. Nan - I sent the Greg K. video to you again several hours ago, as I am determined, DETERMINED, I say, that you shall have the pleasure of seeing the delightful Greg displaying his acting talents. I sent the video twice this morning and would have sent it a dozen times in succession to try to get it through to you at least once, but it takes about 17 minutes for it to scan Norton anti-virus when it's sent. Neither message has bounced back yet, but this particular message has taken hours to bounce back to me before. If you don't get the video this time, perhaps your computer programmer son can solve the mystery of what's blocking the video. I didn't get to hear Shep call Rick "Tricky Ricky" yesterday. Drat the luck! I love these little nuances and it's so frustrating to miss one. Edit: Oh, Shep did just call Rick "Tricky Ricky" on Studio B! Happy Day! And they had a rather long conversation with lots of smiles from Rick. I hope that all of you LevenGals who weren't watching live had your VCR's set. I think that you're right about the reason for Shep's ratings not being higher. I simply don't believe that most Fox viewers like Greta better than Shep. In connection with the wording on messages from our favorite Fox guys, neither Greg, Jeff nor Todd said anything about "Thanks for watching Fox News" or something similar, so there is variation as to how our faves respond. On Fox & Friends this morning, they showed a huge billboard opposite CNN in Atlanta. It said, "Come back Connie. CNN needs you," and underneath credited Fox News with the message. Close to this billboard was another one advertising Fox & Friends. How do you suppose that CNN feels about looking at that each day? Brian Kilmeade and Steve Doocy also spoke with some Hooters girls about a Hooters calendar that's out featuring the girls. Why does Hooters have the smarts to put out a calendar and Fox News doesn't? Grrrr! Shep just broke the news concerning Rush Limbaugh announcing that he has been addicted to pain killers for years and is going into rehab. I so hope that Rush is able to break his dependency. If it weren't for Rush paving the way for conservatives, I really don't think that we would even have a Fox News Channel, so both the Fox News personnel and the Fox viewers owe Rush a big debt, IMO.

 Damn! why can't I get fox!!!!Rick in jeans! I want to see that! Stupid cable company with stupid CNN!!!!!! My husband is home today for a 4-day week-end. We're gonna stay home. they repaved the road so we're stuck until 5pm. That's ok, maybe I can get my hubby to weed-eat the yard!LOL! That would be a miracle! Anyway, I'm glad the library is walking distance. Well, everyone have a nice Columbas day week-end. I'll try and post on Tues (the library is closed from Sat-Mon). Nat- thanks for the happy dance! Slan leat!

 Leslie- OMG- I'm absolutely ROFLMAO with tears in my eyes!! (And yes, people are looking at me very oddly....) "slid his hand into his jeans pocket.....this very loud thud.....LevenGals swooning and hitting the ground simultaneously" LMAO!!! What a hysterical image! (And probably some grain of truth to it!) So he *was* wearing jeans then.....I thought so but *gasp :-O* couldn't remember. Girl, you and me both- the last few baseball seasons I've been watching more than I ever thought I would. My mom used to really like baseball, but now she never watches. I used to make her mad (not intentionally, really!) by saying that I wanted the "blue team" (Dodgers) to win when they were playing her beloved Reds. Hey, I liked blue better than red, I was in first grade, what can I say? ;-P I would ABSOLUTELY LOVE to see a WS with the Cubs & the Red Sox. That's what I was telling Kevin last night, is that it would be a great series to have them play. No offense to Yankee fans (and Shep, Rick, etc.), but they've been there a lot it seems. I agree- a Boston-Chicago matchup is a better one.

 Hey girls! The Blue Angels were practicing as we were driving home- it was so cool, to say the least. Good thing Kevin was driving, 'cause I was looking in all angles out the windows. We were on the way to the bridge, which gave a perfect view of the Bay and the Angels flying over. The *best* though was when we were just about at the bridge (there's a curve and then you're looking dead-on to the bridge) and all of a sudden, all of them flew over the toll area of the bridge- they were so low! It was great! There are trees on either side of the roadway, and the bridge was straight ahead- the trees gave a perfect frame for the Angels, not to mention it caught us offguard even more. Both Kevin & I said "Whoa, did you see that?!" I had the VCR going yesterday, but as luck would have it they repeated Fox Report at 10:00 and was able to catch Rick's story just before crashing. We spared ourselves the torment of Target yesterday & just did the Costco thing. I really like Target, but as we were nearing the end of our Costco run, I remembered how short on patience I was. I longingly looked at a new Compaq laptop over there- I was really surprised to see that it had nearly the same specs (the basics were exactly the same) as a desktop model. It's very tempting. Weight Watchers, I have sinned- I had 3 pieces of pizza last night- but enjoyed every bite. I'll be better today. It's my one fall from (food) grace that I've had this week, so that's OK- guess I used my flex points on the pizza! ;-) I goofed yesterday- let's just say it was kind of one of those 'off' days we all get every once in awhile. Remember before, when I'd asked Rick for the photo, and thought it got lost in the mail so I had him re-send to my work address & I gave the PO zip instead of my work zip?? I did the same thing yesterday when I placed an online order through Kohl's. I saw after I'd gotten the confirmation email and immediately tried calling them- she said she'd see that the shipping dept got the correct zip and would call to confirm. I don't have any messages, so I may have to try again today. Dangit, I hate when I do stupid stupid stuff like that. Sherry- You're welcome! If I find other websites I'll let you know- a lot of times the places I'm looking for latch hook kits also have other craft related items. Rick looked great on there- it's funny, I guess it *has* been awhile since he's been reporting, huh! Time flies, especially at this time of year. Nan- I thought that's what Shep said, "Tricky Ricky" LOL! I had the TV down as Kevin was already asleep. I agree, he did look very relaxed. It's funny that you say that your step-daughter moved to SF to go to SFSU and never left. That's part of the reason I came up here too. I really liked the campus but didn't realize just really how liberal it was. Plus....in my 'younger days' I thought I was 'liberal'. *eek!* It hurt to type that. I think I was always conservative, but just didn't know it- my views were but no one ever bothered to tell me that till Kevin did about 7 years ago. I really liked the campus there at SFSU though and despite the liberal agenda that was constantly attempted to be shoved down my throat, I have no regrets. My only regret was that Nancy Pelosi spoke at my graduation and I have Davis's stamped signature on my diploma. Can I get a recall? LOL!! I want Arnold's stamped signature on my diploma! I guess all us grads can say, "hey, we have the recalled governor's signature on our diplomas!" Um...OK. So maybe that's not a really good claim to fame or whatever one wants to call it. It *is* funny, though. When did your step-daughter graduate? Off to work! I'll try to be on AIM today- I have something that I have to work with my supervisor on with during today, so I may be away for a bit. I'll try to remember to put my away message up if I'm going to be away. Have a great FRIDAY everyone!! :-)

 Hey ladies! I was watching Fox Report last night when Rick Leventhal began reporting on the Curse of the Bambino. As he slid his hand into his jeans pocket, I was startled by this very loud thud. Sounded very much like all the LevenGals swooning and hitting the ground simultaneously. Just had to check in and make sure everyone is okay. No concussions? No broken bones? Everyone's heart rate settled back to normal? Good deal. Glad to hear we didn't lose anyone. I've been watching more baseball in the last three weeks than I ever have in my life. While the ShepHerder in me is loathe to root against his beloved Yankees, I've got to admit that I wouldn't mind a Boston-Chicago hook-up. I think it would be a closer matchup than a Yankee-Chicago series. I've got to get off here and go get some groceries, otherwise it's dry cereal for dinner. Ya'll have a good day.

 Hey all! Jen, the audio post is cool! Hope you're feeling much better! I just emailed you. Sherry, yep, exams and papers, know about that! Greg alert - he has been on all evening looking very serious.

 Hello Levengals!!! Hope everyone had a wonderful Thanksgiving. I did and I managed to not pig out too bad and stick to my diet somewhat. I don't know that I will lose anything this week but if I stay the same I will be just as happy. Jen - That audio post is cool. I saw on the blog home page they have a free trial. I might have to try it. Hopefully now that you have had your surgery you will start feeling better soon. Things hopefully will start looking up for you from now on. Nat - I know you are coming back from vacation and I hope you had a good one. Hopefully work won't be to bad when you go back. Make sure you post and tell us all about your vacation. Well gotta go for now but will post more on Monday. Got exams the next two weeks so things are going to be crazy.

 I'm here for a brief hello! My hubby is letting me use the work computer. My Thanksgiving consisted of the start of the flu and period(both hit me today so I'm out of it).But the dinner was good and yesterday I got the Christmas stuff up before my demise.LOL! Take care all and I'll try to post Monday! Slan leat!

 Hi all! How was everyone's Thanksgiving? Greg K. worked on Thanksgiving! Rick L. appeared too. They both had to work without being able to be with their families. Films..."The Last Samurai" looks quite good.

 Hey, LevenGals, for those of you who missed it, Rick was on again and referred to Bob Sellers as "Pete," (for Peter Sellers.) Hee! Hee! Bob got it. Now Jennifer Griffin has replaced Rick in reporting from Israel. Bleh! She's a good reporter, but.... Ellen - I looked very closely to see if I could spot any chest hair on Rick, but I couldn't detect any. The T-shirt that he was wearing underneath his other shirt made it hard to know for sure. Thus, Greg K. remains the only Fox hottie who knows the proper way to wear a shirt. Lol! There are a few other Fox reporters who know how to properly wear a shirt (Simon Marks and David Piper, for instance), but they aren't hotties, so the effort is wasted. At least, it's nice to see Rick once again and to get a sample of Rick humor. Sherry - The continued weight loss is great! Teri - Get back with us as soon as you can. I hope that all of the LevenGals have a wonderful Thanksgiving and feel inspired to start posting again when the hotties return in force.

 Hi everyone! Jayel- nothing beats CNN for hotties like Larry King! It doesn't get better than that! Gag! I'm gonna puke! I wish I had fox! Iwas listening to inside politics and they were discussing my man Arnold " the gov." S.. Well, Arnold got rid of the triple car tax (of course CNN brought up the point of his SUV and neglected to mention all the poor folks(including hispanics) who couldn't afford the tax period! Who cares what they drive.) Then they harped on the fact that Arnold will do away with illegal's getting driver's liscences. Here's how the dumb bitch put it "...immagrants won't be able to get liscences in Calif"...HELLO! Their illegal! Anyway... Well, the library will be closed until Monday and I have to work on that day so. I'll be back as soon as able! Have a happy turkey day Levengals, one and all!

 Good Morning Levengals. I'm finally getting around to posting. Saw Rick this morning and again a few minutes ago. He looked great. I don't think I have seen him since when he was reporting on the World Series. I guess he had to go overseas to get any kind of story. Well I forgot to post my Weight Watchers update this week. I lost another 2.6 pounds for 28.4 pounds in 9 weeks. I can't believe I"m still going strong. I also measured at Curves for my 2nd time and I have lost a total of 15.25 inches since I started in September. Well exams start next week for 2 weeks so things are going to be crazy for me but I just can't wait until they are over and then I don't have to think about classes for 6 weeks. Melissa - It is great to see you posting. We thought we were going to have to send Duane "Dog" Chapman out to find you. Hopefully you are watching today because I have seen Rick at least twice but he may have been on more. I don't watch Days but I watch Y&R,, As The World Turns and General Hospital. I'm a soap addict. I know Days is having some big murder mystery. I used to watch off and on but haven't watched in about a year. Jayel - Thanks for the ratings. I know I haven't been watching the news much because I'm just sick of hearing about the same stories all the time. I know it is news but some days I go crazy listening to it over and over again. Thank god that Scott Petersen preliminary trial is over because I couldn't take it anymore. Of course now it is Michael Jackson all over the place. AH - Thanks for sharing the website. I'll have to go check it out. Nan - Hope you had a great time in Las Vegas. Hopefully you will win some money. LOL!! Well gotta go since I"m having my hubby's family over for dinner tonight and then tomorrow I'm off to PA to spend it with my parents. Hubby has to work on Thanksgiving so I'm going by myself. Hope everyone has a safe and Happy Thanksgiving!!

 hey jayel! something told me to turn on fox this morning...is it my imagination or were there a couple of chest hairs poking out?? it was really good to see him again...guess i won't be buying an osama doll for my dog this year :( i caught the fulbaum mistake- i was like 'hey Bob, i know he doesn't work much (on air) but at least get his name right!'

 Rick Alert! Rick was just on reporting from Israel on an Iraqi baby being treated by Israeli doctors for an unusual heart condition. (Try to imagine an Israeli baby being treated by Arab doctors.) Rick also showed a video of Osama and Saddam dancing dolls which have been withdrawn from the market. Rick cracked that shoppers would have to now adjust their shopping list. Bob Sellers referred to Rick as Rick Fulbaum and didn't catch his mistake. Rick was wearing a white shirt, unbuttoned at the neck.

 Teri - I'm going to start watching CNN more often to see if they offer a real alternative to Fox's pop culture obsession. I can't stand the ultra-liberal Judy Woodruff and Andrea Koppel (more liberal than her father Ted Koppel), so I don't know how long I'll be able to stick with it. I am assured that Larry King is a real hottie, though. Lol! a h - Wouldn't you know that I would miss seeing Rick. Thanks for the info on what he was wearing. Welcome back, Melissa! Bounty hunter "Dog" Chapman must have finally tracked you down. I hope that your reappearance is a good omen for more Rick sightings. With this being a holiday week, I don't expect to see much of our hotties. Do our spoiled hotties really need seven days off to celebrate Thanksgiving? I have a feeling that we're going to have to settle for some "turkeys" this week.

 Hello all! Jayel-I watch CNN, only because I don't get Fox. CNN doesn't usually harp on a story until you throw up e.g. The Lacy Peterson thing, The basketball player(?) rape thing, yada yada. They do tend to cover a range of news. I still would rather have Fox, but beggars can't be choosers... I hope everyone has a good day! Slan leat!

 Hi all! Melissa, welcome back! Rick L. is in Jerusalem! He was on this morning with David Asman. I guess he's going to be there during Thanksgiving! Think he was wearing a black polo.

 Hey gals!!!!!!!!!!!! God I'm so sorry for not being around lately! It's been mad crazy around my house, but not in a bad way thank goodness! I think my computer has a virus. :( It keeps freezing up on me, and then just sporadically doing things. *shrugs* You know how LONG it's been since I've seen Rick on the TV??? Oh, I'd say a good 2, maybe 3 months! I'm in serious witdrawl. I try to check out Studio B on Wensdays when I'm usually home, but I've not seen him for a while. I am addicted to "Days of Our Lives" right now, since that's what my mom and I watch at lunch. I used to hate soaps too. *grin* I don't know if any of you watch it, but if you do, I have to say how HOT the Sami/Lucas stuff has been lately. And it's driving me NUTS not knowing who the killer is. hehe If none of you watch it, then just ignore me. LOL I hope everyone is doing great, and I'll try to pop in this weekend! XOXOXOXOXO I missed you gals so much!!!

 Cable News Ratings for Friday, Nov. 21: O'Reilly: 1.4 Hannity & Colmes: 1.4 Brit: 1.1 Shep: 1.1 Greta: 1.0 Larry King: 1.3 Aaron Brown: 0.9 Paula Zahn: 0.6 Dan Abrams: 0.5 Joe Scarborough: 0.4 CNN appears to be gaining on Fox. Has anyone been watching CNN enough lately to speculate on a reason for this? Funny moment today on Fox: Bob Sellers was interviewing a young man who had spent time at Michael Jackson's ranch when he was a child. Defensively, the young man asked Bob if he had ever participated in sleepovers when he was growing up. "Yes," said Bob, "But not with 45 year old men. Lol!

 Hello all! Another glorious day in Neverland!LOL! OK, sick joke I know. Jayel- I love your story! I have to give credit where it's due...Cnn doesn't shove the Peterson trial down our throat's or the other two. We do get to see the democratic runners ad nausium and Bush bashing up the bum though. So...be greatful you get fox!LOL! Nan- Bad news girlfriend. Did I mention my title, Special Agent Teri with the FBI. That will be 15.00 of your 20.00 for gambeling tax, please! well, I hope everyone has a great day! Slan Leat!

 Hi guys. Here is the link to the article on Greg K's speech at Seton Hall. There's even a little pic of him talking. http://domapp01.shu.edu/depts/affairs/Setonian.nsf/(WebDisplayView)/1579E84BCF84124285256DE4007FFE7E?OpenDocument Now, does Greg K only work Fri-Sun.? Jayel, Bernard Goldberg's book sounds very fascinating. I find Katie Couric's 60million dollar salary an outrage!

 a h - I missed Greg's webcast, too. Greg has been on again today reporting on Democrats running for president, but the rest of the hotties must have the day off. I'm not crazy about what Greg is wearing today, but no matter, he always looks yummy. I definitely think that you and everyone else would find Bernard Goldberg's "Arrogance" fascinating. He names biased reporters such as Diane Sawyer, Katie Couric, Dan Rather, etc. and lists some of their quotes. Although it's a small point in the book, there is mention of network journalists "selling serious journalism down the river" through an endless succession of celebrity interviews with the likes of Justin Timberlake, J. Lo and similar pop culture personalities. In selling out serious journalism, the networks aren't alone. A media official has been quoted as saying, "The 24-hour news channels are unrepentant scandal junkies and Michael Jackson is ratings crack." Well said, I think, and the executives who run all of the news channels should consider the damage being done to their journalists by forcing them to become scandal mongers and celebrity hounds. Arrogance is unhappily not limited to the networks. Try sending a critical e-mail to Studio B, and if you get a response (not from Shep, but from one of his juvenile assistants), you'll see what I mean. Hey, I know that Geraldo isn't one of our favorites, but to be fair, I have to give him credit for going to a very dangerous place like Afghanistan to cover the action there. I don't blame any reporter who opts out of going to Iraq or Afghanistan. There's a very real danger of reporters getting killed in either of these places.

 Hi all! Don't know if this was posted on the blog but Greg K spoke at Seton Hall University on Nov. 19 about his embedded experiences, along with a panel of other journos and politicos. Apparently, there was a webcast of this, which I missed of course. Anyway, Greg K's "boss" at fox joked that he wouldn't be giving Greg's phone number out to the audience! Jayel, Bernard Goldberg's book does sound fascinating. I've been wanting to read it. Not much activity on the blog these days! Where is everyone?

 Nan - It sounds as though you have a very nice trip planned. Enjoy, but don't let all of the pampering spoil you. Lol! In regard to Shep's prediction about the Michael Jackson story bringing higher ratings, that may well be the case, but I found an article posted at Electronic Media that stated that on Wednesday night, Larry King scored a higher rating than Hannity & Colmes. The Larry King show that night was a birthday tribute and wasn't about Michael Jackson. Larry King drew 1.8 million viewers to Hannity & Colmes 1.6 million viewers. The article also mentioned that this was the second time in recent weeks that Larry King had outdrawn Hannity & Colmes. I don't think that we can draw any conclusions at this point, but the ratings gap between Fox & CNN could be narrowing. We'll have to wait and see how the ratings continue to shape up. I want to give my highest recommendation for a book that I think all of the LevenGals would enjoy. The book is "Arrogance" by Bernard Goldberg. It deals with the arrogance of the network news media. The overall theme won't be a surprise to anyone who ever watches ABC, NBC or CBS, but the depth of news media arrogance, bias and political agendas may be a revelation. One point of interest is the documentation of how the networks deliberately leave vital bits of information out of their reports, thereby changing viewer perception of the facts. The liberal media isn't cut any slack in this book. From what little I've seen, the only hottie to show up today is Greg. (Has anyone ever noticed Greg's mannerism of licking his lips? I can't even remember if Rick has any mannerisms. He's not on often enough to notice.) The only consolation for the hottie absence is that at least they haven't been on reporting on Michael Jackson, although a couple of the hotties likely will get stuck with more Jackson coverage.

 Hey LevenGals!!!! Jayel - Kobe Bryant probably sent Michael Jackson a huge fruit (pun intended) basket for knocking him off the front pages for a while. Shep made a comment yesterday regarding the overload of Michael Jackson coverage that he knows there are other stories to report on, but when the next ratings are released for Studio B, the highest ratings will be for the day of Jacko's arrest. He then promised that the Fox Report would cover all of the days news (which it did). Just when you think Kalleeforneea will quietly fade into the background, someone from LaLa Land plunks us right back into the forefront. Sorry ): LOL at your examples. Teri - Call off the FBI please!!!!! I'm leaving for Las Vegas on Sunday and I don't want to have to report my $20 in winnings as income on my tax return. It always amuses me how those protesting SUV's as gas guzzlers drive to the protest in a 1974 Chevy Van that gets about 10 miles to the gallon and still uses regular fuel instead of unleaded, or those protesting logging use wood stakes to hold up their signs. Ellen - I missed all of the Rick sightings too. Since hubby's been home all I get to see is Studio B and the Fox Report. I put a Laurie Dhue background on his laptop so he lets me get my weekday Shep fix. LOL As mentioned above, we're going to Vegas for a few days, be home just in time for Thanksgiving. We're staying at the Paris, so I'm looking forwarded to a whole lot of pampering. An afternoon or two at the spa, a massage, a few margaritas delivered by a gorgeous pool boy etc.... Hope everyone has a great Turkey Day and that the year has brought lots to be thankful for.

 Ellen - What Rick looks like is mostly invisible! Until he showed up yesterday, I was beginning to wonder if he still worked for Fox. BTW, I think that James Rosen has been missing even longer than Rick. Teri - The blog has been dead. Rick's frequent absences are part of it, but part of the reason may be because of the heavy emphasis by Fox on legal issue stories, to which our hotties aren't usually assigned, although Fox did pull in Adam and Dan (looking good in casual clothes) to report some on the Michael Jackson case. I'm considering (no joking) abandoning all of the news channels until and unless they quit going bonkers over Scott Peterson, Kobe Bryant and Michael Jackson. Tongue-in-cheek examples: News anchor to Adam Housley: Adam, what going on there at the Neverland Ranch? Adam: Well, there's no sign of Michael Jackson, but as can see, the grass here on the Neverland Ranch is really growing well. News anchor to Dan Springer: Dan, is that Michael Jackson's plane behind you? Dan: Actually, no, but it certainly looks like it could be Michael Jackson's plane, doesn't it? Grrrr! What a waste of reporters! What a waste of the viewers' time! The news channels (not just Fox) have lost all sense of perspective, although the hits on the Baghdad Sheraton and on the Palestine Hotel, which could have killed reporters, may have enough of a sobering effect to make Fox, CNN and MSNBC re-evaluate the importance of tabloid journalism. By no means am I counting on this, though. For now, silly sitcoms and gross crime shows are looking more appealing to me than they have in a long time. I haven't seen any cable news channel ratings lately. Hmmm... I don't know how to interpret the lack of ratings info. Melissa: Please reassure us that you haven't abandoned the blog.

 I can't believe how dead the blog is! Where is everyone. Don't tell me they got kidnapped by spies from CNN! Melissa where are you! Send out the FBI! Find our missing Levengal's! Now that I got that out of my system. Protesters, gotta love 'em! Them people need jobs, a life, something. We get them here on the left coast! Spend a Sat. protesting by the beach. Get a life people-go to the beach and play in the water! if you can't comprehend that then drown! I hate protester's with signs.What a waste of a tree to make said signs.... I'm on a roll today...well, everyone have a good day! Slan leat!

 i can't believe it! i missed seeing rick, both this past weekend in vegas and now today.......... oh, sad face... i was shopping most of today - missing studio B. i did see the fox report w/shep, but no rick unless he was on in the last half hour... could someone remind me what does rick look like?

 Rick Alert! Rick is in Miami reporting on demonstrations going on there today.

 hello all! I'm finally getting around to posting.I've been busy(who hasn't!). I hope all is well with everyone. Nat-I never heard of loreena M. before. I love her music. I picked up a couple of her CD's today. One you did for me and the other was Christmas songs. I went on your web site and am still not a member.^.(what an awful sad face.LOL!). Not much happening in the central coast,except now Gov. Terminator not Mr. YAAAAAAAAA! Slan Leat!

 Hey guys -- stopping by to tell you a "funny" little story - so funny thing that happened to me inbetween being "out" and finally getting some gall bladder relief - the ol' heart started 'tacking' while I was on the OR table - twice. The only way I could describe it was on the border for having a heart attack, so why? The Cardiologist (SP?) says it was one of four things that lead to it 1 - Some sort of reaction to the medicine the doctors gave me 2 - Anxiety about the surgery 3 - a lack of potassium (SP) 4 - the high amount of stress in my life the past 3 weeks -- me I'm thinking that it's 2 -4 and not so much '1' anyway sooner or later I'll go back to finally get the surgery but until then I'm taking beta blockers to keep my heart rate down and potassium pills for the ol' heart -- so until later, later.

 Hello Levengals!!! Well I finally got to see Adam yesterday and Saturday. I think that is the first time in weeks. Of course I missed all the Rick sightings. It has been so busy. I was a little surprised that Adam wasn't covering the governor thing today but Trace was. Also heard Greg say yesterday that he will probably be heading back to Iraq soon. Well here is my Weight Watchers update. I lost another 2.6 pounds this week for a total of 25.8. I was excited. Thanks to everyone for their congrats from last week. It helps keep me motivated. Jayel - Thanks for keeping us posted when the hotties appear. I like knowing they are on that day then I can leave the tv on while I do other stuff. Nat - I guess you are off on vacation. Hope all goes well and you have a well rested time. I'm thinking of coloring my hair for the first time and I'm scared to death but I have got to do something about this gray. I was thinking about getting one of those ones that only last like 30 washings and then if I don't do it right it won't be permanent. I'm not going to change the color just use the same color. I'm dark brown. It is hard to decide what color to get. Anyone have any suggestions on which brand is best?? Well hope everything is good with the missing Levengals.

 Ladies, Tony Snow repeated Rick's report that had been shown on Fox Report yesterday, so I hope that more of you got to see Rick. In one of the shots from today's repeat, it showed Rick standing in the street and he was wearing JEANS! The shot was very brief, though, and wasn't close up. On Fox Report, the jeans were covered up by writing at the bottom of the screen. Some of the people at Fox obviously just don't get the importance of emphasizing the jeans in jeans shots. Sigh! Adam and Greg have also been on today. Adam was reporting on Scott Peterson, which to my mind, is the journalistic equivalent of stepping in something highly unpleasant. Lol! Poor Adam. I suppose that he has no choice in the matter. Greg was reporting on the situation in Iraq. Greg seems to be working almost seven days per week, which makes it nice for us Greg fans, but I don't know how he feels about such a schedule. Natalie - Re your hair -- Are you trying to tell us that you aren't a natural Malaysian Cherry? I'm a natural Dark Ash Blonde. Gray? What gray? Lol! Check back in as often as you can. You're essential to the LevenGals. I have a feeling that Rick may be back next week, girls, so maybe we'll all have more to talk about. Oh, for all of you have lost a post, this happened to me again the other day, but I hit the back button once or twice, then hit "Refresh" a couple of times, and the post showed up on the blog. Stupid Blogger!

 Hey Gals! I thought I'd do one last post before I pack up the computer and try to call it a night and get some sleep. I caught Rick's report today- one out of two ain't bad! I was hoping for a Todd report, but with the one I caught Thurs. & then Rick's today, I can't complain. The bit that was on FR today was really good- like Jayel said, it repeats at 2 CST. I'm going to miss the repeat at mignight- unless I'm awake ;-P I didn't set the vcr yesterday so I missed Todd's report. Greg K & Adam were on earlier today; Greg more than Adam, I think. I finally have everything done (I think!) and I think we're all set to go tomorrow. Hubby did my hair tonight (Clairol Natual Instincts exotics- Malaysian Cherry)- he did a great job as usual. I'm fighting those grays tooth & nail- I'm just not ready for those yet. Anyway.....I wish ya'll a great Thanksgiving (I know it's over a week away, but just in case I can't check back in before then.....)! Keep me updated via the blog on all the sightings & what they reported on, etc, etc......Good Lord, Teri- I will be getting a taste of what it's like to be Fox-less! I sure hope your cable co. gets it figured out SOON that they MUST have Fox in their channel line up! Everyone take care & be good while I'm gone!! ;-P

 Rick Alert! Rick was on Fox Report this evening reporting on some of the Marines that he was embedded with in Iraq. Rick was in Ca. and Las Vegas and attended a Marine ball dressed in a tuxedo! I think that Rick F. said that Rick L's photographer in Iraq, Christian, was with him when this report was filmed. If you missed this, Fox Report repeats again at 2:00 AM (Central Time).

 Hottie Alert! Todd Connor was on this morning approx. 11:20 - 11:25 CST. Todd was discussing the case of an elderly woman who almost lost the family farm. The story has a happy ending, and Todd seemed genuinely pleased at the way that things turned out. Natalie, I think that this may have been the first report on the story so Todd may be back on again today. He was shown both in the studio and walking around on the farm. I did finally get up the nerve to e-mail Rick this week. I never assume that I'll get a response from any of the Fox reporters, but I haven't heard anything back. Since he's missing from TV, I assume that Rick has had some time off. Greg K. has also been on TV this morning, including being on Fox & Friends. He was doing more coverage on the Senate talkathon. Since many of us would be distraught if 24 hours went by without an appearance from Geraldo, he was also on F&F today discussing Princess Diana and the British royal family. Is there anything that Geraldo doesn't know about? I'm in total awe!

 Hey LevenGirlies! First of all, thanks for all the e-cards & birthday wishes! They really made my day. 3 of the office girls took me to Chevy's yesterday, it was fun. Samantha, and two others gave me a French Lavender bath gift bag and a really nice wine-colored top from Banana Republic. It feels nice to know that people really care (not that I didn't think they did before, but I think ya'll know what I mean). I think we all need reinforcement of that sometimes. Ha! And like it should even surprise me, the negative vibes chick that I've mentioned here before never *once* said happy birthday to me, even though it was totally obvious that it was my b-day. Fine with me- if she never said a single thing to me again, I'd be fine with that. I just thought it was so funny. I think you gals would have to know her to completely understand what we're dealing with here, LOL. She's totally uninvolved with unit activities- she's only involved with her little click (sp?). The thing that works for those of us who suffer, is that many feel the same way as we do- we just pretty much put up with it, although I've 'spouted off' to my supervisor before, and she's seen this girl in action so there's no denying it. One thing I found in a magazine about work mantras that I thought was hysterically funny, and I know it's been said before: "It could be worse; I could be related to these people". ROFLMAO Like I said, you'd have to know some of them to know why I find that SO funny; but I think everyone works with people like this in their lifetimes. My b-day resolution for the upcoming year: Laugh More. Hubby gave me a Zygocactus, which should do fine at work. I think I had one of these before, but unintentionally killed it. :-( I don't have much of a green thumb, I'm afraid..... I got home just in time yesterday to see Hot Toddie on Fox Report- he was reporting about the whole NPR thing and how they got that million (billion?) dollar donation and if they should have to pay taxes on it, I believe. I agree- we're in the midst of a serious hottie drought. Nan- I'm definitely making headway (knock on wood). It's been so nice to get things that have been festering finally settled. I have a couple of uglies to handle today before I go, but hopefully I should be able to do that with time to spare. I think this will be the first time before I've gone on vacation that I haven't had my desk covered with stuff and stressing out to get it done; but that, I think, is due to just pushing pushing pushing it through and working through lunches and breaks. I've paid for it this week, though- 3 nights this week I've been out like a light by 8:00. It *is* a huge relief though! Ah, ok- the *back* allergy test- I've heard of that before. I may be in for that myself one of these days. Kevin keeps telling me I should go in for a more extensive test. That would be great to have a list of the allergens though. To me it would be *so* worth it. (I think, anyway....) Food allergies would be the pits. Jan- Thanks for the happy b-day! You know, I think that it's really only on that one day of the year that I really focus on it- the rest of the time I don't pay much attention. A lot of the time I still feel like 27-ish- don't know why, but I'm fixated on that age. It's just when huge decisions like having kids come to mind that I'm reminded of the reality of my age. Going to have to mull that one over some more....LOL! LOL about Firth! You're so funny! I'm glad he'll be in the next Bridget Jones movie- I need to see him some more to make an assessment. ;-) I'm horrible with dusting too- at home & at work. Hmm....could be why I have so many allergy problems sometimes? Nah, can't be it... ;-P ROFLMAO- the "LevenWho"- HAHAHAHAHA!! Don't tempt me to email Rick- I may just do that! I'm feeling uncannily brave today (or is it that he's just easy to email?). Ellen- Sorry for the alias confusion! ;-) Thank you too for the happy b-day! I'm going to give the emailing to Todd another try when he has a story that I can easily comment about. I need some fodder to get me started.... The more I see him w/o the goatee, the more I like him with it. I *love* Paulina Stuckey's website- her artwork is so beautiful. I really like the fairy that I put on there. There's others by other artists too that I've seen that are really nice, but I don't recall who the artists are. Is Jaime getting a kick out of all us LevenGals? ;-) We're a fun bunch, aren't we! Even when I don't get to post every day, I make it a point to check in to see what everyone's up to- ya'll always make me smile and laugh. Jayel- I think you should email Rick! I'll bet he's in the office waiting for something to happen, or he could be working on something. You know what will probably happen.....they'll all be on a lot in the upcoming 2 weeks when I can't watch or tape Fox. Murphy's Law. Or should that be Hotties Law? Ya'll will have to keep us Fox-less gals posted of any hottie sightings. Yep - the age thing is correct- I don't think there really is any blissful age to be- we always seem to look back and *think* a certain age was blissful, but we're remembering the good stuff and not so much of the bad and how bad those bad things were I think. I always liked what Kevin's dad says, that we should live life in reverse. LOL! Thanks for the Rick tidbits- and it does seem odd that they'd have a chapter with Maya Zumwalt instead of Greg or Ollie. Maybe they figured they'd do better with getting a "female perspective". Rick's definitely been missing for at least two weeks- I don't even remember when the last time was that I saw him on there. LMAO about the celebrity lines of underwear and then going over to Greg- that must've really been a classic! I think I heard about the Steve Harrigan/goat thing- I heard the blurb for it but missed the actual story. LOL, Kid Harrigan! Keep those hottie alerts coming- I always appreciate those! ;-) Sherry- Probably a really good thing that you got the flu shot- from what I've been hearing it sounds like a potentially really nasty flu season coming up. Congrats on the temporary job! That's great that it's so close to home- you could actually go home for lunch! I had a job like that for awhile- it's really nice. That's great that you can work the WW mtgs & the Curves around it too! I agree- mornings seem better to exercise than afternoons. I just don't think that I can get up at 4 AM to exercise- LOL!! Afternoons can be tough- you get home & just want to crash- the total antithesis of exercise. CONGRATS on all the weight loss too!! I'm going to try to be 'good' while I'm on vacation, but I'm not going to punish myself eitehr. I'm going to go full throttle when I get back, though; exercise and stick to my points. Clothes are always the best guage as to how the weight loss is going. Scales are nice; the way clothes fit, even better. Thanks for the wishes! I think you hit the nail on the head- 35 is that halfway point to 40. Maybe that's why I have problems with the 'halves'. We're leaving on Sunday; I'll be sure to post before I go. I may try to check in, but it will be very brief as I will be checking from my dad's or mom's. Teri!- Got your voicemail- work's been crazy (and like above, trying to get last minute stuff done before I go). I'll have to check out the Avalon site later on today- did you have trouble signing up? (In case ya'll are scratching your heads thinking, *HUH?* I started up a MSN site to post photos & stuff- more below). I'm glad you liked Loreena McKennitt- have you heard her stuff before now? She has about 5 other cds I think- I'll make some more when I get back. Thanks for the b-day wishes! I'm going to be waiting by the front desk for that Fed-Ex package!! ;-) LOL- that's so funny that you saw Bret on CNN during that conference! I think you need to get more specific with your pleas- "I WANT FOX NEWS CHANNEL- *ALL* OF FOX NEWS CHANNEL" LOL. I've learned you have to be very specific with what you wish for.... OK- about the site. I had the webpage on Geocities, but that was just too hard to manage and I didn't have a whole lot of space to work with. The page is still there, but I haven't done anything with it in months. I did some poking around and found that the MSN pages are much easier to format & work with, so I started a site/page of sorts there. I've mainly just posted pics of stuff- artwork, family, friends, Fox hotties, and the boat. (Hehehe- like I work Fox Hotties in there?). You can see it here: urlLink Myst of Avalon . I *think* you can post messages there, but I'm not sure. So if you want to leave me a message, feel free to do so and let me know if you have any logistic problems. I've had it up for a few months but kept forgetting to mention it, LOL! OK- gotta get to work, I'll chat with ya'll later!

 Girls, the hottie shortage is getting serious. I've only seen Greg and Jeff on this week, and the week is almost over. If I'm remembering correctly, Rick has been missing for two weeks! Time for more nagging, pleading, whining e-mails to Fox to let them know that we miss our guys. For those of you who missed it, Greg was on Fox&Friends this morning reporting on the talkathon in the Senate. When he made his first report, Greg appeared to be chewing gum, and he gave me the impression of being very pleased with being assigned to cover the Washington scene. (Needless to say, he was looking gorgeous and was wearing a medium gray suit, white shirt and dark blue tie.) Juliet Huddy gets a little giddy, I think, when talking with Greg. Lol! She was mentioning the cots brought in for Senate members to sleep on and said something that didn't come out exactly right about the Senators and their aides sleeping together on the cots. Greg was obviously amused by her faux pas and refused to make a follow-up comment. I read somewhere that the talkathon was supposed to last for 30 hours, so Greg may make more reports tonight or on tomorrow's F&F. The show also did a segment on celebrities coming out with lines of underwear and went right to Greg after that. Yes, girls, it would have been the perfect opening for the boxers or briefs question, but F&F fumbled the opportunity. Steve Harrigan was also on F&F, and they showed him a photo of a woman with a goat that she had named Harrigan because Steve was her favorite reporter. Steve seemed less than overwhelmed by having a goat named after him, but grinned and referred to the goat as "Kid Harrigan." Ellen - I have seen Bill Hemmer on CNN. He's cute and might be a nice addition to our Fox hotties. Sherry - I'm really impressed by your weight loss. Keep it up and congrats on the new job. If I really were "buddies" with Greg, I would tell him to find Rick and drag him back to the Fox studios, then go after the other missing hotties. Natalie - Wish that I could send you your favorite hotties for a birthday present, but the best that I can manage is a hottie alert when Fox finally decides to give us a break and put them on camera.

 Hi everyone! I was so busy farting around on the web I almost forgot to post!oooopppppssss! Nat- found your web site and signed up to join. I'm using Terez Majere 1 as my sign up name (would you believe i'm known as the Dragon Lance lady at Waldons!). Anyway... got your CD's yesterday and I love Loreena(?)! If you have more and are bored please send me copies! Also happy birthday. For your big day (35! give me a break! try 43!!!!!) I'm fed-Xing Rick to you. Enjoy!LOL! I hope today...oh, I was watching CNN (I don't get Fox) and they did a press conference with the General and I saw Brett Baer! A fox reporter! I almost cried! I miss Fox! To thoes who know not the story, my cable company is shotty and doesn't have fox and I don't want to go dish..Yada yada.. well, slan leat you all!

 Jayel- thanks for the info! where o where is our ricky? Sherry- hope the job goes well, even though its a temp...internet classes? my friend jaime's taking some too, isn't it cool to not have to go to class? where on the east coast are you? hooray for the pounds slip-sliding away! anyone checked out bill hemmer on cnn in the morning?? no rick or todd, but pleasant on the eyes!

 Hey Levengals!! I'm finally getting around to posting. It has been busy. Went to my hubby's work today and got my free flu shot. They give all the employees free shots and if they have extras they let us go in and get them. I hate needles but I was a very brave soul and got my shot. I didn't even need him to hold my hand. LOL!! Well it has been a busy week. I got a job, well a temporary job. It is for a CPA firm and it is from January - April 30th. They are going to start training me a couple hours here and there until the end of the year. Im excited. The great thing is the job is right around the corner from my house less a mile away. That will be great for winter since I won't have far to drive. The hours are like two days from 12-8 and two days 9-7 and then some Firday's and Saturday's. At first I didn't think I would like the 12-8 but then I thought about it and it will be nice because those mornings I can go to my Weight Watchers meetings and to Curves to work out. I'm more likely to exercise if I can do it in the morning. I'm only going to take 2 classes in the spring so this will work out good. Both my classes will be internet classes so I will be able to work them on my days off. Oh yeah I haven't given my Weight Watchers update. I lost 1.8 pounds this week for a total of 23.2 pounds in 7 weeks. I'm hoping to reach 25 pounds next week. I am starting to really tell in my clothes and I feel so much better now that I'm exercising like 5 times a week. Okay enough about me now I must respond to all the posts. Nat - Happy Birthday!!! A day early but I didn't want to forget to post tomorrow. I know what you man about 35. I will be there at the end of March and I don't know how I'm feeling about it either. 30 went surprisingly better than expected. I keep thinking that at 35 I will be working closer to 40 which scares me a little. Well I know I'm not much for encouragement since I'm in the same boat as you but have a great day. Only a couple days before your vacation. What day are you leaving?? Jayel - Happy Belated Birthday! Hope all is well with your mom. You are not kidding when you say "Rick who??" Haven't seen him in ages. Now you have me picturing Adam in a tuxedo and I like it. LOL!! You brought a smile to my face which I need today because it is a dreary rainy day.' Sounds like you and Greg are best buddies now?? You go girl.!!! Ellen - Glad you are enjoying your new laptop. I can't wait to get mine. I got a new desktop in August but I really want something with more portability. I'm going to look around Christmas but may wait until next year. Glad you have someone to help you out. Nan - I sure hope Adam appears this week. I will try to be watching for that Jan - I will definitely take him to see that movie if he ever gets a day off. LOL!! Jen - Hope things are going better for you. Melissa and Denise - HOpe all is well for you. Well gotta go talk to you ladies later.!!

 Hi, ladies! Thanks to all of you that I haven't already thanked for both the concern expressed for my mother and for the birthday wishes. Ellen - I'm so glad to see you posting again. A couple of us have user names and that's why you see two different names for Natalie and me. Messages are posted instantly for blog members to read, but there is a delay (Don't know why) in reading the messages for non-blog members. Rick who? Lol! I am going to e-mail our missing Rick and possibly quite soon. Jan - It was sweet of Greg K. to apologize for failing to answer the questionnaire, even though the questionnaire wasn't from me. There are a number of questions that I'd like to ask him, but I'm leery of turning him off with a series of questions. I might never hear from him again! Greg seems to have disappeared this week, along with Rick and the rest of the hotties. Jeff Goldblatt did show up today on Studio B, however, reporting on camera phones, so maybe the rest of the hotties will turn up before the end of the week. (Not that I have anything against them, but Fox's female reporters are wearing out their welcome.) Nan - I presume that there will be nothing remotely resembling an inaugural ball for Arnold. In view of California's financial crisis, that's only sensible, but wouldn't it have been fun to see Adam in a tuxedo covering the event? In regard to reporters getting face time on TV, whenever a big story requires them to spend more time than usual on camera, it's a little amusing to hear the anchors sympathizing with these "poor babies" as though they had been working extra shifts in a sweatshop or toiling in the salt mines. Natalie - I sent you an e-mail re Todd. I received two replies from Greg, including the totally unexpected question about where I was writing from. Happy birthday, and don't worry about turning 35. If you stop and think about it, every age has its advantages and disadvantages. There's no perfectly blissful age to be, so just enjoy the good things that are in your life now. Yesterday, I received some books from Amazon including "Embedded." I haven't read anything in "Embedded," except for the chapter in which Rick was interviewed for his thoughts. It's a good chapter, and he mentions that his ex-wife didn't tell his younger daughter too much about what he was doing, but his older daughter was more aware and was worried about him. He also says that his mother and sister were very concerned about him. Rick mentions that he has a brother, but the brother and Rick's father presumably kept a stiff upper lip about the danger that Rick was in, while the Leventhal women were rather freaked out. (The girlfriend isn't mentioned.) Rick also says that the Marines that he was with all seemed to love Fox, but spoke disparagingly about the networks. Hee! There's a chapter in the book with Maya Zumwalt, the Fox producer turned intrepid reporter, that we all may remember fondly or not so fondly. Why the book's author chose to do an interview with her, rather than with Greg or Ollie North, I don't know.

 i don't get this guys... if i look on the levengals blog the last post is Nan's. but, then when i come in here to post, the last post is Jan's? why is that? also, does Guinnevere show up as Natalie on the blogger post and Jayel's is Janice? this is all new to me (on webtv i only got a big empty space, this is much more complicated but loads more fun...) Nan- i hope kim's surgery went fine. actually, i grew up in minnesota for 25 years then moved to san diego for 22 years, then came back up here 3 years ago to be around family..you can't beat the weather out in southern california! thanks for your ideas on posting! btw- where do you live? Guinnevere (or should i say Natalie?)- i'm going to say happy birthday now 'cuz i don't know if i'll post before thursday..enjoy being 35! it's a fun age! i wish i had the guts to write to todd for you. but, but, but...i can't decide if i like him better with or without the goatee ( but there sure is a difference) i checked out your website, (and stole your fairy) i've looked at paulina stuckey's website...its beautiful! i collect fairies... Jayel- i'm glad to hear you're corresponding with greg kelly, but when are you gonna email rick? you do remember rick don't you? :) i think the reporters want to get as much air time as they can get, but then there's always slackers in every industry...i sure hope your mom's okay... Jan- minnesota is beautiful, but its BUGGY! you're right, winter for 10 months is no fun..but now that i have this laptop this winter may go by faster, as i hate going out in the cold..i kinda forgot how cold it got while living out in san diego, culture shock to say the least (and i grew up here!) sherri- i've been playing with this new laptop until 2am most days, i'm catching on but i have lots to learn (thank God for jaime) she's typing this for me right now as it would take me all day.. and i know theres a teri, lesie, denise, a, and melissa i'm probably leaving somebody out..i'll get better at this haven't seen rick yet today, but then again i haven't watched fox yet today, i think the jessica lynch interview tonight w/diane sawyer will be interesting... hope all is well in leven-land...here's to a good sighting!

 Hi Gals, Sherry, do try to get your husband to the movie, if he already likes Will Ferrell, the movie is a no-brainer.....He just plays that part so innocently that it's actually believable.....We got cold fast too, one day it's fall, the next it's winter.... Natalie, Happy Birthday, I really didn't have a problem with turning 35, but when you live life as a 12 year old, age just doesn't matter :-P I just happen to know that Colin will be in the next Bridget Jones' Diary installment, and he gets to fight Hugh Grant again....(I just love a guy who wears reindeer sweaters and fights like a girl).....any other Firth related questions?? I'm getting pretty knowledgeable about him ;-) (that sounds better than obsessed)...The x-raying was a bit overdone in DC, but on the upside, I can read at night without a light on...:-) Jayel, Happy Belated Birthday! I'm glad to hear your mom is doing well, my best to her.....I love hearing the nasty emails, they are so much more entertaining than the gushy ones, and IMHO it shows that the guys who read them are not as stuffy as others would have you believe...Tell Greg I said 'hi'....lol, but you should have run with the questionnaire opening, you might have recieved a lot more info on him... Nan, I'm sure glad I don't have allergies like that, mine are just seasonal....If I were allergic to dust I would be dead by now as my idea of dusting is waving a blow dryer around once in a while.... Hope hubby is still doing great....Colin and I thank you for agreeing to give him another chance, but even if you still fail to see the true hottie within, I hope we can still be friends ;-) Jen, I'm not privvy to what's been happening with you, but I sure hope it gets better, and soon! I'll try to get on AIM.... I really think someone needs to email Rick to be sure he is still working at Fox, we may need to rename the blog the "LevenWho?"

 Hi All! Jan - I've seen Bridget Jones' Diary, but I was wrapping Christmas presents at the time so unable to concentrate of the "hottie" factor of Colin Firth. I will have to re-watch when able to devote my complete attention and thus be able "to get the full picture of how hot he is". LOL Now that hubby is home recuperating, I'm usually on AIM during the day at work (provided I'm not swamped), check in and chat if you get the chance. Sherry - Hopefully Adam will be on covering the Governator's swearing-in, it's the end of this week (I think). Your weather sounds like ours, it was even a little foggy this morning. Nat - Hang in there at work, sounds like you're making headway. Don't fret, turning 35 was a whole lot easier than 25 (at least for me). For my allergy test they poked me all over my back and I'm stupid enough to go back for more this week. They'll give me a list of everything I'm allergic too. Unfortunately, at this point I didn't have any real food allergies. Too bad, could have been another great weight loss tool. Jayel - Chatting with Greg via anything is sooo awesome!!! Glad to hear he's approachable. Sounds like he's settling in his new DC assignment. I agree with you that the reporters/anchors are upset if there "face time" gets shifted to someone else. I'm sure they didn't get into TV journalism to sit around the office to watch others report the news regardless of the long hours. Glad to hear your mom is doing well. Jen - Hang in there girl. I know I've said this before, but things WILL get better. I'm always here when you need to talk.

 Hey girlies! Thought I'd take a quick break & check in.....I know you guys have no idea what I'm really talking about when I say, "14 VRPs down, 4 to go!" - but *BELIEVE* me, it's a *HUGE* relief. A huge relief that is, *if* I did them right. I'm doing what they told us to do, anyway. OK gals, my birthday is Thursday the 13th, and while I know there are worse birthdays to have, it's sort of a landmark one for me- 35. 25 was tough, and I'm not sure why. I have a feeling that 35 is going to be a bit humbling as well. You know what I really want? That signed photo of Todd! ;-) Any takers on a TRIPLE DOG DARE to send him an email? LOL! Teri- I got the pkg out in the mail to you today- should have it by Weds. or Thurs. And I was wrong.... (you'll understand this when you read my letter)- "Prologue" was not in Mists of Avalon- it was "The Mystic's Dream"- sorry about that....I didn't do the CD that "the Mystic's Dream" is on. Um.....I think I will blame that on my neurotic job, LOL! Jen- I got your email- hang in there, girl! Things have *GOT* to get better for you soon!! :-) You'll be on my prayer list. You know we'll always be there for you when possible, even if it's only by email in my case. *ONE* of these days (and hopefully more than that) I'll be able to get on AIM & chat with ya. Don't worry about your email! You know you have a shoulder anytime you need one. Jayel- Wow, how many replies did you get from Greg? I think you should take me up on my triple dog dare to send Todd an email to request a photo for me. ;-) LOL! You must really have a way with words; that's great, though! You really should try to email Rick- I'm sure you'd get a reply. He actually seems pretty approachable, and even the times I thought I wouldn't get a reply, I did. I think there is definitely competition between the reporters and some that get bent out of shape if they're not getting their due (not to mention us gals who do when "story userpers" attack....I won't mention any (reporters) names.... Well, time to go home!! :-) I'll chat with ya'll later.

 Hi everyone Um well I really don't know why I'm posting right now - I'm not really one to talk to personally about myself but my psuedo break from the blog might be longer than normal. Some of you may know, some not but anyway I've had a really bad run of late just pretty much every bad thing that could happen in every situation I've been in has happened - To be honest I feel like I'm someone's whipping post right now and it's been hard to take, and some of you will probably be laughing your butts off it's okay but I really feel like I'm being punished - I've got my gall bladder and now I've got a dislocated knee and then there's just everything else that's really not fit for this. So all my buddies, all my AIM buddies I really am glad you guys are my AIM buddies and it might sound corny but I really don't know what I'd do without you guys and you guys are great to me and I will for sure keep in touch (e-mail, IM, etc) It's just right now nothing going on with me should be public like this on a blog so until things get better I really don't have anything to talk about Natalie: Natalie I'm so sorry about my e-mail, I know it's not the super-happy e-mail that I send on Sunday and I apologize Jayel: I also sent you an e-mail, I hope you get it and whatever you choose to do is fine - I know we don't know each other like I know Nan or Natalie or Melissa or Leslie or Jan so you might not want to do me that favor and I understand that but if you choose to do it - I thank you in advance Okay I'm outta here for a while.

 Ladies! I (yes, little old me) have been chatting a bit with Greg K. via e-mail. I sent him an e-mail yesterday evening, basically telling him that I thought that he was doing a good job with his new Washington assignment. Yesterday, he stumbled over a few words and even appeared to lose his place at one point, and I was afraid that he might be a little nervous about trying to do well and needed a verbal pat on the back. He responded last night when I wasn't home, thanking me and asking if I was the one who had sent him a questionnaire while he was in Iraq. He apologized and said that he had been busy and wasn't able to get back with the questionnaire. When I responded earlier this afternoon, I told Greg that I wasn't the one who had sent the questionnaire. To my surprise, he wrote back and asked where I was writing from. (Greg is much more approachable than I imagined.) I told him that I lived in Alabama. (and gave him directions to my house. No, not really. Lol!) Not too long after that, Greg showed up on TV, so I don't know if I'll hear anything more from him. I thought that he might have Sunday off, since he was on yesterday, but apparently he may be doing more reporting this afternoon or tonight. I've wondered about how reporters/anchors feel about getting time on camera vs. time off. It isn't the same as people who have humdrum, unglamorous jobs and are eager to be off as frequently as possible. Sometimes, reporters/anchors will moan and complain about working long hours. Yet, I think that many of them would be upset if their time on camera got shifted to someone else too often. What do the rest of you girls think? Jan and Nan - Are you twins? Lol! The illness involved my mother, who had a very light stroke, but she's doing well. Thanks so much for your concern. Jan - While channel surfing, I have caught brief glimpses of a couple of hotties on CNN, but I didn't get their names and doubt that they're on very often. I mean, when CNN has Wolf Blitzer, why would they want anything more? Lol! BTW, Tony Snow read a rather strange e-mail from someone today who said that he/she had gone to school with Wolf Blitzer and was going back to watching CNN. I'm always curious as to the nasty e-mails that are sometimes read on Fox, including the ones that want to argue that Fox isn't fair and balanced. If such people actually feel that way, why are they watching in the first place! Nan - Poor you and all those allergies and needles! I hope that you can find some relief. I'll be praying that your dad's chemo is working for him. There do seem to have been a lot of the female (yawn) reporters on this past week. Next week, it's the boys' turn. That's my idea of "fair and balanced."

 Hey gals! I have a quick moment to check in- work has been keeping me hostage these last few weeks as I'm sure it will this week too- yet another project. I'm trying to get caught up and keep getting this last minute projects thrown at me (the others are getting them too). It's been bad- barely a break for lunch- I know it's my own fault though. I've been dreaming of work and having mini panic attacks about getting everything done at work and at home and trying to keep hubby & everyone else happy- it's been a bit of a struggle. I'd like to think there's an end in sight thought, that there's a light at the end of the tunnel (and that it's *not* the on-coming train). Anyway.....it looks like it's been a slow hottie week, other than Greg. He seems to be on fairly regularly now. Jan- We definitely have missed you! Don't be such a stranger! ;-) Glad you had a good trip to DC- the x-raying sounds like a pain. How was the concert?? Yeah, the blog's been kinda vacant this week- I haven't posted since last Sunday & it's not taking me long to catch up. Where *are* ya'll?? We need a great Rick sighting this week. It does sound strange they would say "Shep" instead of "Shepard" on the radio ad. Stay safe driving on that ice! I've noticed it's been really really cold in the midwest in the last week. I should re-watch Bridget Jones' Diary, LOL! I can't wait for the Beyond the Edge of Reason one. Is Colin Firth in that one too, I wonder? Ellen- The fires were definitely a sad sight; I'm glad your friend's house was saved. Jayel- First off, Happy (belated) Birthday! I hope you had a great one! I'd be proud to represent the LevenGals as the Official Hottie Consultant! :-D I've been constantly praying for our guys & gals overseas- it's been so horrible lately with all the casualties. I hope that your family member is doing better. I didn't set the vcr all week, so I missed the "Hottie Toddie" comment- that *is* funny, though! I would totally be ROFLMAO if he *did* mean Todd Connor! Nan- I'm glad Kim's knee is doing well after surgery! Allergy tests *do* hurt- especially for the things that you're allergic to. My big ones were grass, mold & dust(mites). It sounds like you got a more 'deluxe' edition of the test than what I got from Kaiser, though. Mine was done on my arm- about 10 different things that they injected somehow (I forget now- I just remember the reaction). How did they do yours? Kevin said I should go back for a more detailed one. LOL, I think I could use a bit of the "taming of the tongue" as well too.....I'm getting better, but still a ways to go.... My thoughts & prayers will be with you for a positive result of your Dad's CAT scan. Sherry- I go on vacation a week from today ;-) I can't wait, but at the same time I get anxious about leaving home (you know, you just hope everything is OK while you're gone- esp. pets...). It will be *so* nice to get away from work- I really need to before I say something there that I may regret, lol! My birthday is this upcoming Thursday (13th). LOL, it's funny- I handle my craft projects the way I handle reading books- at least 3 going at the same time. Must be that multitasking habit I've been forced into by today's society.....have ya'll thought before how bad this whole 'multitasking' concept has been on us as a whole? That's the real reason that we're so stressed out. We're all trying to do too much in too little time. Teri- I've finally finished the CDs! :-) Now I just need to print out all the labels, LOL. I should be mailing by Monday or Tuesday (IF work lets me out of the office at all- d'oh! Tuesday's a holiday- so I guess it *will* have to be tomorrow!). You know, there's a cure for the Geraldo disease....(OK- I'm too mentally wiped out right now to really come up with something good for the cure, but I know there's one out there, LOL!). I got your letter last week- thanks!! ;-) Jen- Girlie, I hope things are going better for you; here's sending good healthy vibes your way!! I hope you'll be able to get the surgery soon so that way it can all get fixed once & for all and you can eat again without so much pain. You've got a lot of stamina (or will?), that's for sure. You're going to have to drag Melissa back to the blog- we miss her here! ;*( OK- I gotta get off here & get the rest of my stuff done- I'm running out of time (what else is new?). I hope ya'll are doing well and wish ya'll a great upcoming week! I'll try to check in more this week- promise.

 Hey Levngals!! How is everyone doing?? I'm finally getting around to posting. Things here are okay but it is offically cold now. We had 80 degree weather this past week and now it is in the 40's. Ugh!! What a shock. Jan - Thanks for the movie review. I will have to go get hubby to see it. He likes Will Ferrell. It looks pretty funny. Nan - Glad Kim is doing good and sorry to hear about all your allergies. That is a lot of them. I agree that Catherine H gets a lot of stories. I don't think I have seen Rick in a couple of weeks. Adam is also now missing too. Jayel - LMAO that our hotties have been captured by evil CNN operative. They have been missing. I have seen Dan and Greg this week but that is all. Well hope everyone is doing well. Talk to you ladies later

 Hi Gals, Oh Nan....while Colin Firth is pretty good in What a Girl Wants, you totally have to see Bridget Jones' Diary to get the full picture of how hot he is :-P IMHO he is completely in Shep and Rick's league, but I'm obsessed, therefore I cannot be completely unbiased...... I went to see Elf today, the other movie apparently doesn't come out for another week, and it was really cute. There were hilarious moments and Will Ferrell definately gets kudos for walking around in his green suit practically the whole time. I would give it three stars (out of four) for humor and likeability. I especially liked the scene where he tests the "jack-in-the-box" toys because that is the exact reaction I get when doing those stupid things....I KNOW they are going to pop up, but it still freaks me out..... Jayel, I hope the family illness wasn't severe. Don't EVEN joke about CNN getting the hotties...that would provide an interesting dilemma---to watch or not to watch??? I tried to sign on to AIM tonight, and it was a no go, I'm not sure if it's just me or the whole AIM network....anyway, I'll try again before I call it a night...Hope all is well.

 Hi LevenGals! Kim had his knee surgery Monday and he's doing pretty good, all things considered. It seems to have gone better than the one on his other knee in February. Went to the allergist on Wednesday and had an allergy test done. Ouch!!! Poked me 90 times, if I'd known that's what the test entailed beforehand, I would have told them what they could do with all those little needles. LOL Turns out I'm pretty much allergic to everything, more than 60 allergies anyway. Not sure how knowing this changes anything except increase my resolve to get out of this valley as soon as possible. Teri You must be studying the book of James. Did a study on that book not too long ago. By the time I was done, Chapter 3 (Taming the Tongue) was totally highlighted as this tends to be a problem area for me. LOL In head out mouth, that's me. Btw Thanks for sending the rain my way keep up the good work. I'll look for that book you mentioned about the embeds, sounds like it might be interesting. Still wish Fox News would publish one. Jan Sounds like you had a great time in DC. Know what you mean about the high school age trick-or-treaters. They come in droves here too. Who is this Rick you're referring to, name sounds familiar, just can't seem to put a face with it. LOL I heard that commercial referring to Shep Smith too. Didn't quite have the right ring to it. Watched What a Girl Wants a few days ago. See what you mean about Colin Firth.. Not quite in Shep's league but sure is easy on the eyes. Jayel Must of missed Shep's Hottie Toddie remark, saw him discussing football with Jane, but I didn't catch that. Hope all is well with your family now. Dad's having a CAT scan next week to determine if the chemo is having the desired effect. Ellen Moving to MN from San Diego must have been quite a weather shock. The San Diego area is on our short list of places to move to in a few years. It's such a pain to lose a post. Whenever I feel in a long-winded mood, I type my post in an OpenOffice or a Word document then copy and paste it in the blog. Haven't lost a single post since I started doing it that way. Ever since you mentioned Shep's lower lip, I can't stop staring at his picture and then falling into a daze with a silly smile on my face. Hope all our hotties are present a accounted for in the coming week. We might want to consider sicking the Dog after Catherine Herridge so that Rick will get the opportunity to cover more stories in the NY area for our viewing pleasure. Lol.

 Hi, LevenGals! Back after an interruption due to family illness, and I've missed you all. "Pretty" Greg K. was on a little while ago discussing security matters. How I wish that I could report that Rick was also on, but he's been missing for what seems like forever. I'm beginning to think (paranoia setting in) that he and the other missing hotties have been captured by evil CNN operatives. Don't tell me that Larry King doesn't have a dark side. Lol! Hopefully, Rick, Jeff, Todd and Adam will be back next week to join Greg and Dan, and we'll all have something to talk about. I did catch Studio B on Friday when Shep was discussing college football. He made a reference to "Hottie Toddie," which I didn't get, but I immediately thought of Todd Connor. (No, I don't think that Shep had Todd in mind.) Lol!

 Hi Gals...Wow, take Rick away for a few days and look what happens to the blog....If nothing else, we need Rick to keep us in touch.... Just a random thought---I heard a radio commercial today for the "New face of the news, and his name is Shep Smith"...That hit me as odd, that the announcer would refer to him as Shep instead of Shepard. I know that people who are familiar with him call him Shep, but to do a promo to people who may not know him, it seems weird...even FNC refers to the show as "Fox Report with Shepard Smith".....maybe I'm just weird, I've heard that before.... Jen, you my friend are keeping the Dr's in vacations for years!!! I do hope the surgery goes very smooth and you are back to your sassy self shortly! Take care of yourself... Ellen, I would love to live in MN, except for the fact that it has winter 10 months a year! I have family there, outside the Twin Cities, and I do enjoy going there to visit. It is beautiful. Welcome to winter....we dropped 34 degrees in one day this week. Tuesday it was in the 70's, and Wednesday it barely made it to 40's....winter sucks, especially here where we don't get a lot of snow, but ice instead. Driving on snow is bad enough, but ice is horrible. This cold weather is a good excuse for me to go to the movies on Saturday...I've been waiting to see "Love Actually"....(Colin Firth is in it!) I'd also like to see "Elf" which surprises me because I usually don't go for that kind of humor, but I really like Will Ferrell.... A--I also saw Greg on with Tony Snow, and he was on FR tonight. He looks good in a suit, but I'm gonna miss Jen's sage green shirt.... Teri, Natalie, Sherry, Denise, Leslie, Jayel, Nan, I hope you are all well...Sorry if I missed any of the 'regulars'

 Hi all! The blog is quite quiet. Where is everyone? Greg K was on the air with Brit Hume today, but it will air again at 12:00 a.m. - was wondering where he was cause he wasn't on since Sunday I think. Jen, hope everything is going okay for you. Will Melissa return to the blog?

 Well guys - no need to send out that Dog fellow for Melissa -- I'm IM'ing away with her right now -- her away message before we talked was something to effect of having to clean her room so maybe she got lost in her room - Lord knows I have some time Another thing - surgery for me: rescheduled -- things are just a little too crazy for me right now to go into surgery so as much as I *need* *want* this done ASAP - I just can't so um I guess I'll post later when I can.

 My second post from yesterday didn't go up. wierd. Anyway, to repeat myself..... RICK IN PRINT ALERT! I stand corrected! The book "Embedded, the media at the war in Iraq" does have a chapter by Rick Leventhal "They Fight. We Report. You Decide.". ( my husband got me the book for our anniversary). Anyway, it's 25.00 or 18.00 in wal-mart or the army PX ( where I got it). No pictures though (damn!) How is everyone today? I just got out of my ladies Bible study. It's a good study we're on this time. How to control our tongues (a good study for any gal whether she be Christian or not). I know I have a big mouth at times....anyway... I hope everyone has a great day and Nat- I'll be mailing you a surprise in the next day or so... Slan leat!

 Hi all. Hmm, no one mentioned Greg K's appearance with Tony Snow on Sunday. He was in the studio talking about Iraq and how his friends from the Marines are working in the Pentagon. It was great to have Greg K sitting in the studio as a commentator rather than as a reporter on the scene. Jen, hope everyone goes well and hang in there. Where has Melissa gone these days?

 Hey everyone Well I'm writing this post a little blind - blind in the fact I haven't read the blog so if there are any comments addressed to me - um sorry. Just a quick post to let you guys know the old surgeon didn't isolate me in the infected ward today - in fact *hey now* he "dumped" me off to oww hottie surgeon - who took me out for coffee and even though I drink tea anyway hottie surgeon told me my gall bladder needs to come out "and while I'm in there I wanna have a look at your liver too" so the surgery is Wednesday and I'll be in the hospital for 4 days and then home for about a week or so and it's really sad but the coffee to lessen the blow of being told I needed surgery - was the first real affection I have gotten from a member of the opposite sex in just under a week oh well if you gotta get it from somewhere right? So I guess um I'll just have to talk to you guys sometime next week if they ever let me out of the hospital.

 Rick In Print Alert! I stand corrected!The new book Enbedded Media in the war(I think the title) has a chapter where Rick put's in his say! I glanced at it and it looks good. I should have read the table of contents instead of the back of the book last time! A brain fart!LOL! anyway...I'm not sure if i'll get it. I may wait for the quality paperback. Slan leat!

 Well I'm a happy girl today. I got to see Adam a couple times looking very handsoe in his tan coat. My hubby has a coat just like that. No other hottie sightings though. It is very quiet in here today. Well gotta run. Talk to you ladies later.

 Hello everyone from the now 70% fire contained state!LOL! Earthquakes my bum! Ca. will burn to death before we fall into the ocean.Or maybe we'll be enviornmentally regulated to death.Either way... Nat- glad you got the the care package! I hope you like the tapes. Let me know! I'm at the vet clinic today. I'm waiting for my husband to return so we can go to lunch and figured what the hell, I'll post on my second home!LOL! OK! What's wrong with Geraldo! He's sooo hot I"m thinking of stating a blogspot for him. What a hottie...Oh.....OK.... that was my nurse, time for my medication......(disreguard last paragraph!The author wrote it prior to her meds.)LOL! And with that...oh to the other CA gals,we got more rain this morning and more on the way wed. Slan leat!

 Hello Levengals!!! The weather is just crazy here on the east coast. It is Nov 2 and it was 80 degrees today. This is like the 4th day that it has been like this and they are saying we have a couple more. I guess we are getting a late Indian Summer. It is great but they are saying we are going to have another bad winter. Went away to my parents for a couple days and have been busy with life but finally getting around to checking in. I survived Halloween on my diet. I went away so I didn't do trick or treating so I didn't have to buy candy and they don't have it at my parents either. Jan - I'm glad you had fun in DC. There is just so much to see there. I think we take it for granted since we live like 40 minutes away and can go whenever we want but I have lived here all my life and i still don't think I've seen everything. Ellen - Glad you are joining in. Good luck learning your new computer. Now you can join in with all of us crazy ladies. The split screen makes all the difference. I usually have it but there has been a time or two that it goes missing and it drives me crazy since I can't reply to everyone's posts. Nat - So when do you leave on vacation I know you just can't wait. Don't you have a birthday coming up soon too. Even though I have like 50 craft projects already started and have no time to work on them I have decided to take a sewing and crocheting class at JoAnn Fabrics. Suddenly I want to sew (I want to make some curtains and pillows for my house since I can't find what I want). I don't know what I was thinking but we will see. I don't have a sewign machine yet but found one at Walmart for like $100 if I decide I like to sew. I knew you would appreciate this since you are crafty like me. Jayel - That is awful about the casualties in Iraq today. They said they were going on leave. I have said some prayers today for them and their familes. Nan - I saw that shooting on tv. I couldn't believe it was happening. Jen - Babies are just too cute. You can't help fall for them. I like the name Jayden. Teri - I was asking myself the same thing. Why the hell is Geraldo in CA?? Leslie - I know what you mean about the weather. It is short wearing weather on the east coast. I also remember always having to bundle up on Halloween and then you were mad because it hid the costume. LOL!! Okay while I love Jazzy Jeff if I have to see that story he did on the Canadian RX thing one more time I'm going to shoot my tv. I think I have seen that at least 20 times in the last week. And then there is Rita and Greta who can't talk about anything but the Peterson trial. There has got to be other things to talk about (I know I should be happy they are not talking about Kobe - LOL) Okay I'm done venting. Well gotta go. Talk to you ladies later.

 Hi, LevenGals! As I'm sure you all have heard by now, we had a large number of casualties today in Iraq, so please everyone pray for our soldiers and their families. Also please pray for our Fox reporters in Iraq. They're in a dangerous situation also. It may be that only Dana Lewis and Steve Harrigan are over there now. I haven't seen Simon Marks in about a week, although he could be on a special assignment. If anyone wants to make a donation to help our soldiers, the USO and OperationAC have web sites with all the required info. Jen and Jan - It's nice to see you both back with us. Don't stay away so long. Natalie - I don't know why ratings for Brit and Shep weren't posted last week, but I assume that the information just didn't come in for some reason. It appears that Larry King's ratings go up and down depending upon the choice of guest. Yes, Fox should definitely hire you. You could be the official Hottie Consultant and get TPTB straightened out on some things. Who wants to apply for Fox News Wardrobe Supervisor? This is strenuous duty requiring um, jeans assessments. Lol! Jan - We certainly did notice your absence. You have no idea how close you came to having Dog Chapman sent out after you. Although I was familiar with Dana Lewis, I never paid him any special attention until he came to work for Fox. He's doing a good job in Iraq, and I notice that he unbuttons his shirts. That now makes a grand total of TWO Fox reporters who know how to wear casual shirts. I don't consider him a hottie (Not everyone can meet the rigorous requirements. Lol!), but he's not bad. Greg K. has been on today and has been asked for his insights into Iraq, helicopters, etc. He doesn't seem to be assigned to any particular department in Washington, but roams around wherever needed. If that's the case, it should provide him with different types of stories to report on. Am I the only one who feels as though Rick has been away for a couple of weeks? His adorable personality is much missed. I hope that all of you LevenGals will be around for more conversation next week.

 How is everyone? Well I hope everyone had a good, happy, productive weekend -- the jury is still out on mine but let's just say there have been times this weekend when I would have to get better to die and that's no joke, my honey asked me why his life has to *cutting out the naughty words he used* "be like some darn Greek Tragedy all the time?" I had no answer but I'm slowly starting to think that I might have something to do with it but we'll see, maybe I'm just imaging things. Paid a visit to my ol' homestead to see my mom and then got dragged half way back to where I live now to see my new little cousin/godson Jayden Christopher who will be 2 weeks old tomorrow - 6lbs and 9 1/2 oz and even though I didn't want to admit because kids and I *DON'T* get along at all - he's 100% adorable as most 2 week olds are -- the real trouble I think is when they get old enough to run and knock you right down in a toy store or they're in front or behind in you line somewhere and start throwing fits and the parents do *NOTHING* to stop them -- that's when kids and I don't get along. Well I'm off to see if I can start dinner w/o losing it - or drink a Red Bull w/o losing it -- so if the surgeon man doesn't isolate me in the hospital on Monday I shall check in again when I can -- until then, everyone take care and Jan - I just realized last night that you were in Washington last week *d'oh* I felt so bad I didn't say something to you before you came -- glad you had fun.

 just a quick short post as i am very tired. nan - i am living back in my home state of minnesota. i spent 22 yrs in san diego, ca and it's so sad to watch the fires out there. my friend mike lives in scripps ranch, which was hit hard. just 3 weeks ago he had a tile roof put on his house. they all had to evacuate their homes. his house was saved but the house directly across the street was burned to the ground, as were many more around him. he credits the new roof as the reason his house was spared. i feel so bad for all the people that lost their houses and possessions. i finally saw greg kelly today on fox news but i missed todd. good nite all.

 Hey Gals! I've been checking in here & there but haven't posted for a few days. I'm burning some cd's now for my mom so I thought I'd pop in. I guess it's been since Tuesday since I've written- wow. Anyway, I got through that "rush project" at work, but I found out that I have another one waiting for me most likely this upcoming week and the following.....just in time to throw off my trying-to-catch-up-before-vacation strategy. I *think* I'll make it, but I really don't like the next project- it's similar to one I had to do around July, I think. What makes me not like it (and really the only thing) is that I don't have the adequate training to do it, and very few others do either. The one person who knows them well is difficult to approach (Ms. Negative Attitude)...so....we're supposed to get 'training' but we'll see. I'm so lost on those types of policies that it's not even funny. I've got about 18 of them, so I *guess* it's not bad- there's about 200 all told, I think. I got my scanner installed to my new laptop today- I found out though, that it wasn't compatible with Windows XP- but I think it will still work ok until I eventually get a new one. It's finally cooled off here- in fact, I don't know if ya'll caught Fox Report today, but they were showing hail in Marin City and mentioned 'near the Golden Gate Bridge'. Marin City is on the other side of 101 from Sausalito for those of you gals who are familiar with the area. It was really weird because they showed the tunnel we drive through every day, it's just north of the Golden Gate. It looked like it snowed- it was so odd. That was obviously after we'd gone through there on Friday (we leave early-like 6 AM to go to work). I saw Greg and Todd on today- it's nice to see Greg on again; my faves are still 'Tricky' and Hot Toddie though. Jayel- No ratings for Shep or Brit?!? That can't be good. And what's with Larry King gaining on O'Reilly? Hopefully it's just a minor setback. Missed the Rick & Shep bit on Studio B this week- I didn't set the VCR all week now that I think about it... Thanks for sharing the Roger Ailes and B & C interview, I found that really interesting! I think we need him at our company; our turnover has been extremely high this past year. Let's just say that for a long time, there weren't too many employee ID numbers above mine (mine's 300); now there are nearly 40 higher than that. Out of the 5 people that interviewed me for the job in 12/2000, only one is still there. I'd *love* to work for a high morale and low turnover rate place.....is Fox hiring?? LOL, just kidding! LOL at the 'mistakes'- yep, those would be doosies (sp?). Leslie- LOL, you know the sad thing is that our systems (the computers) are practically brand new- but whomever made the choice for the data system we're using ought to be fired (assuming they haven't already left the company). I can only imagine how much life insurance that guy (Geraldo) has- with all the places they send him. Ironically enough I used to work in the life ins. industry before going to med. mal. ins. And before that....don't ask, lol! On a more serious note, I haven't heard from Jen lately and we were emailing back & forth for the last couple of weeks. I'm worried about her; I sent an email earlier or middle of this past week and haven't heard back. I hope that she's hanging in there, and she'll definitely be in my prayers too. Your weather sounds like ours- we went from 90 on Sunday/Monday to 50s & 60s by Weds. When's your birthday? From what you said, you must have one coming up too (mine's in a couple of weeks & Jayel's is next week if I'm not mistaken). The more I think about it, the more I think our parents were crazy for letting us go out at night trick or treating. I can't say that I'd let my kids go out alone- even when they're 12 or 13. Where *is* Jan??? She hasn't posted in ages- about as long as it's been for Melissa! Time to send out Dog after them! ;-) LMAO about the Garfield t-shirt- I think I had that mini poster! I always liked the "have a nice day" one where he has half of the smiley face in his mouth, ears laid back, and the other half of the smiley on the ground, LOL. Girlie, what have you been *up* to anyway?? Getting kicked off websites and what was in your E-mailbox?? We've gotta chat one of these days on AIM! ;-) Teri- Girl, I think you outposted me this week, LOL! I'm still holding out for a book about the Fox News embed experience. There's *got* to be one one of these days, right? Got the care package! : ) I'm working on the cds tonight- I think there'll be about 4. Let me know how you like 'em and I can always do some others. Hope the cats survived the 'putting up of the feet', LOL! ;-P Amen to what you said about the environmentalists not wanting to thin out the forests.....that was the problem last year in AZ too when they had that huge fire. Clearing out has to be done- if we don't, nature will. And as we know...mother nature is not so nice sometimes. You got rain?? I'm jealous! LOL!! Denise- Isn't it nice to be ahead of the game?? I'm *almost* there....so close I can smell it. I just hope that I *do* get there, but I also know things eventually work out in the end so I try to keep that in mind too. Brokers are the absolute pits. I hear ya loud & clear on *that* one....don't let them get you down. God knows they aren't the most patient people in the world. I'm *still* feeling the time change, lol! Hope your team won the decorating contest! ;-) Sherry- I'd definitely say that the others have to get frustrated with Geraldo ahem....butting in (to put it nicely, I guess, huh!). Yep- the getting dark early throws me off- it's like I'm getting short changed on the day, but it also tells me autumn is here and winter's around the corner- my favorite times of the year. Nan- It sounds like the fires may be bothering your asthma and/or allergies a bit? I would think it would be. Anytime there's a fire around here it always seems to affect my asthma. They were saying that the smoke is all the way in El Paso now- that people are needing to drive with their headlights on. I like the 'underheight' idea- I'm 5'3". The inhaler has cut your appetite? Which inhaler is it? I'm just curious. I have an albuterol one but they had given me a different one to use alternately with the albuterol when I had that nasty chest infection in '01. I forget now what that one was. Ouch- knee surgery- hope Kim has a speedy recovery! That's good that at least you know what to expect with the right knee. I think what gets on my nerves with Geraldo is that he is just too overdramatic sometimes. There's putting feeling into the story, but when he does too much it kills all the emotion of it for me. Our prayers are with you too! :-) What happened with the lawyer & the client was just *too* strange. *happy dance for sweater weather* YAY! I know what you mean! LOL- "equal opportunity hottie watcher"- I love it! ;-) Ellen- Unfortunately I think we've all lost our posts- it's such a bad feeling. I'm sorry you experienced that too! :-( Congrats on getting the new laptop! Have fun learning- as the saying goes (uh, I think it goes...) the journey is half the fun. Jamie sounds like a great help and friend. :-) We're happy to see you posting again- the split screen is *wonderful*- especially when you haven't had it before. Makes it a lot easier to respond to posts. Your faves are the same as mine- Rick & Todd :-) Hopefully we'll see more of them; they had me spoiled last weekend, LOL! I *think* that catches me up. Hope ya'll are having great weekends! Jen, Jan, Melissa, & any others I've unintentionally left out- I hope you're doing OK- drop us a line here so we know you are & what you've been up to.

 Hey Gals, didja miss me??? Did you even realize I was gone??? I have no excuse other than pure laziness, Rick hasn't been on too much, and I'm still "Firthing" over my other obsession...:-) We had a great trip to Washington DC, although I've never been x-rayed so much in my life....even some of the monuments and museums...it's almost ludicris! The train ride was great, got a lot of reading done, we did so much walking in DC that my legs are still sore! We saw so much, but were gone by the time the aide walked into the House of Representatives with the toy gun....If you've never been, it's a really cool place to visit. For as much as we got to see, there is twice that amount that we didn't have time for. I'm kind of a Halloween grinch...I had to work so there was no trick-or-treating at my house this year. I also get sick of the high school kids holding pillowcases and asking "Can I get another one for my sister/brother who's home sick?" No kidding, they come in vans and all pile out. I haven't seen too much Fox lately, I'm missing Shep. Hopefully next week I'll get back in to a routine. I'd miss Rick if he were ever on.....I see they picked up Dana Lewis, I always liked him. I saw the comments on the stiff jaw, and you guys are right, but he wore a helmet for so long, maybe the chin strap was too tight.....I've always liked him though. Well, sorry it's been so long, and with proper apologies to Rick and Shep, I'm glad the Marlins won. Tomorrow I'm going to a "Barenaked Ladies" concert in Indy... the tour is called "Peep Show", I'm not sure what I'm getting in to.....wish me luck.

 Hi LevenGals! Lots of trick-or-treaters last night, but still way too much candy leftover. Asthma medicine still working as a great appetite killer though marginal on the asthma. Haven't seen any Fox today. Lots of errands this morning and then Brendon and his girlfriend came for a visit. We had snow down to 4500 ft level in the hills above our house yesterday. The temperature dropped about 30 degrees from Wednesday to Friday. Ellen - Welcome and congrats on the new laptop. That's great you have Jamie to help out. What part of the U.S. are you from? Though Shep is my absolute favorite, I'm an equal opportunity "hottie" watcher. LOL Jayel - "Mistakes that count" - LOL Calling all missing LevenGals! Hope everyone is having a great weekend and y'all come back soon, ya here!

 Hottie Alert! Greg K. was on about 20-25 minutes ago reporting on the incident that occurred on Pres. Bush's trip. Greg looks gorgeous today. As best I can remember, he's wearing a gray suit, white shirt and dark blue tie. Correction on Dan Springer's jacket. I think that it's black instead of brown. Geraldo is back talking about the Petersen case, so I don't know if we'll see Dan again today.

 Ellen - Please do get more involved since you now have a laptop. It's great that you have Jamie to help you. Nothing beats hands-on help when it comes to learning about computers. Don't worry about making mistakes. The only mistakes that count are these: Recommending that the Fox News Channel rename itself as the Geraldo News Channel. Starting a fan club for Brooke Alexander, Rita Cosby or Brigitte Quinn. Turning a thumbs down on hotties in jeans and unbuttoned shirts. Asking why Fox News hasn't hired Peter Arnett. Insisting that the hotties are on far too much and preferring that Fox hire more female reporters instead. Lol! Dan Springer just showed up a few minutes ago (first hottie spotted today) reporting on Scott Petersen. Dan is looking very good in a brown jacket, which may be leather. I couldn't quite decide.

 Happy New Year Levengals!!! I know I'm a little early but I wanted to post in case I wasn't around later. Hubby is working tonight so I'm going to hang out at one of my best friends house. Nothing exciting. Melissa - Glad you got a computer and we hope to see you around here more. That monitor sounds cool. I know they have those split tv screens but didn't know you could do it on the computer. I haven't seen Rick since last week sometime but he has been on a lot more this past month. Of course he has to go overseas to be on. Nan - Welcome back. Sounds like you had a good Christmas. Shining Things from your hubby is very good. Thanks for the congrats on the weight loss. I just can't wait for all this holiday stuff to be over so I can get back on track. I have a dinner to go to tomorrow and that is it. Back to being good plus I haven't had a lot of time to work out and I miss it. Jayel - Yep I fixed the blog. I know I was causing all kinds of stress. I couldn't figure out what the heck was going on but I was jumping to 2004 before it was time. Well hope everyone has a fun and safe evening. I'll be talking to you later. Bye!!

 Happy New Year to all of you wonderful LevenGals! Blogger has been down part of today (And Sherry had nothing to do with it. LOL!) or I would have posted an alert earlier, but Todd, Adam and Jeff have been on today. Todd has been in NYC reporting on preparations for New Year's Eve, so he could be back again unless someone else replaces him for the evening shift. Todd was looking quite handsome in a sweater of either pale blue or pale gray (couldn't tell which) and a black jacket. Adam was reporting on Michael Jackson and still managed to keep smiling. Jeff was also on at least once today and was reporting on obesity. This was ironic since Jeff is so scrawny. (Scrawny, but cute!) Both Adam and Jeff were wearing suits and ties instead of more interesting casual gear. How does Todd manage to escape the boring suit and tie uniform? I'm not sure that I've ever seen him in a suit and tie. No Greg K. appearances so far today. Ray Kelly has been on, but it's um, not exactly the same. Hey, did anyone catch James Rosen on Fox&Friends yesterday? James has been getting some teasing from Fox anchors about his hair, including a suggestion that he needed a hair cut, although his hair looks fine to me. James was reporting from Crawford and one of the F&F crew was ribbing him about his hair. F&F cut away back to the anchors and when they returned to James, he was holding a can of hair spray and was madly spraying his hair. He's a really funny character. Melissa - Congrats on the new computer! I hope that this means that we'll hear from you more often? I read an article that said that Fox News was among the top ten most watched cable channels for 2003. CNN barely missed out on making the top ten. Looking forward to (hopefully) seeing more of Rick and the other hotties once the holidays are over and things return to normal on Fox.

 Hey girls! Guess what??? I got my very own computer for x-mas!!! I've been trying to set it up for internet to be shared between computers, but I ran into some complications. :) I hope everyone had great holidays, and will have a happy and safe new years!! I'll DEFINATELY pop in tomorrow since I'm off work and catch up with everyone Teri - Thanks SO SO SO MUCH for your Christmas card!!! :) Jen - I'll get back w/ you tomorrow. I'm having internet/email probs, but hopefully soon I'll be able to chat w/ ya on AIM!! :) Everyone else! Have a great day! Oh.....and one more cool bit of info. My dad got a new monitor for his computer (so I could have the old one) and on his new one you can watch TV in the corner of the monitor while you're surfing online, it's THE coolest thing! I still haven't been able to catch Rick on in a while. Saw Rick F, but not THE Rick. :( BUT with my computer now being in my room I can watch TV while surfing the net. Hopefully I'll be doing more of that now. I think I'm gonna take a semester off of school and earn some extra $$$ Anyway I'll see you guys tomorrow! :)

 Hi LevenGals!!! Hope everyone had a great Christmas! I sure did, though I must admit I'm glad it's over. Had lots of people over Christmas and then the day after also. I'm a little tired of cooking and cleaning the kitchen but it was well worth the effort to spend the holidays with family and friends. Got some "shining things" from hubby for Christmas, I must have been very good this year. LOL! Got to see Tricky Ricky on Christmas Eve while baking. Hubba hubba. It had been so long since I had seen him I had almost forgotten that he was such a hottie. LOL Also saw Adam today. Can't remember the story he was covering, his cute smiling face sucked all rational thoughts from my brain. LOL Almost made up for being Shep-less the last week. Sherry - Congrats on the weight loss!!!!! I haven't gained any weight in quite awhile, but I seem to be at a plateau that's keeping me from losing. Drats - well, guess I'll just have to give up food as a New Year's resolution. Nat - Ohhh, a new couch and TV, that's great!! Logan was in Fresno staying with Brendon on the day of the earthquake, he felt it but Brendon didn't. Go figure! Guess some people are more intuned to mother nature than others. Haven't felt any of the aftershocks though. Congrats to your stepson - Hope she said "yes"!!!

 Yea! Sherry fixed the date on her post, and now the posts are back in proper order. Thanks, Sherry, and congratulations on keeping your weight down and on getting to see Adam.

 Hey, girls! I hope that all of you had a nice Christmas and that 2004 will bring lots of good things your way. I see that Sherry's post of 12-23 is still at the top of the list. How did Blogger manage to get the posts out of date order? Melissa, help! Natalie - I did catch the Iraq war footage of Rick and Greg from Sunday Best. It was great to see Rick in his boonie hat again. He'll probably never again look as sexy as he did in his desert camouflage. In the footage, someone was yelling at Rick and Christian to get into their vehicle, which must have been when their unit came under attack. I didn't remember that from the live coverage. How mindboggling that Fox execs failed to learn anything from what made their war coverage so successful and didn't bother to capitalize on it, other than by giving Greg K. a much more prominent role. (I have to wonder how long it took to dawn on TPTB that Greg had become a star.) BTW, it looks as though Steve Harrigan has now replaced Rick in Israel. Speaking of Greg K., he was asked by Fox&Friends if he was now living in Washington. He replied that he was "bouncing around." I assumed that he was more or less assigned now to Washington, but Greg sounded as though his situation is fluid. It's impossible to predict what Fox will do, but they could take a look back at more war footage this week, so be on the alert just in case, especially on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day.

 Hello Levengals!! Well I finally figured out why my stupid post kept showing up first and wasn't on the other blogger page. I must have put the year as 2004 so it was showing it ahead of all the others. I went in and edited and it has moved. Wow I weighed in on my diet this morning and I actually stayed the same. I was so excited because believe me I ate some food this week. I did exercise so maybe that helped. I have been so down in the dumps the last couple days I was hitting the chocolate. I don't know what my problem is but I cry at a drop of a hat. Got to see Adam yesterday all day and today which helped put a little smile on my face. Nat - I saw Sunday's Best and was going to post but you beat me too it. It was great to watch all those old times. I might have to find my copies of my war tapes and put them in the VCR and catch some of the old footage. Sounds like you had a great Christmas and got some good stuff. What is the results of the proposal?? Hopefully yes. AH - I saw Rick and Greg on Christmas too. It is ashame that Rick has to go to another country for us to even see him. We are all getting spoiled a little bit seeing him all the time. Jayel - I didn't get to watch F&F too much but I like Mike and James. They are too funny. They are always great for a laugh. Well gotta go for now. Hope all the Levengals had a great Chirstmas. It is almost 2004 can you believe it?

 Hey girls! I don't know if ya'll caught Sunday Best, but they had some 'flashbacks' of Rick & Greg (& others) in Iraq. They're having a best of 2003 thing on there. The segment appeared about 10-15 minutes in. Also- Fox Magazine is doing a similar program- a best of. They will probably be on there too, but I'll most likely miss it (due to the time it's on- during our primetime here- I get to watch Sunday Best, but with Geraldo in between that & Fox Magazine, it makes it hard for me to see both....). Anyway....both shows repeat tonight/early tomorrow morning in case you missed them when they're first on. Hope all are well! :-)

 Hey gals!! Hope everyone had a great Christmas!! I think I've gotten another cold (it's fairly mild) so I'm just kicking back & taking it easy. We got a new sofa, 20" flat screen tv, and sconce lights for the main salon area of the boat, so we're actually living out here now too for a change- we used to spend most of our time in the back cabin. Yesterday we moved the computer stuff (printer, modem) in here & it's much easier & more comfy now to get on the computer. I'm using a bed tray in the recliner right now. I would have probably made a chiropractor pass out with the way I was sitting before, LOL. I got to catch Rick on Fox Report on Christmas Eve - I actually got home in time to see the *entire* FR program! I also caught him Christmas day & yesterday...I believe. Greg was reporting today about the mad cow disease in WA. Jayel- I believe I missed the sculpture story Rick had, but the sculpture sounds really moving. I think I caught Todd that day (Dec. 18) on FR- he did look good. I missed the Lou Dobbs report about the illegals. I would have to say "it figures" about what you said about the UCLA study & how they recommended that non-citizens be allowed to vote in CA. Argh. It just figures they would suggest that. I say, "fine- then UCLA can host these people in *their* homes and pay for all their kids & healthcare, etc." LMAO- I saw the bit about James Rosen on F&F that day- about his mother & all. He *is* really funny. You know what? Blogger was *really* super odd that day (the 24th). Your post actually showed up twice- I thought mine wasn't there, so I kept retyping and then did a "copy" & paste, and posted again. And again. And again. When I finally scrolled down, I noticed that I had like 8 posts below Sherry's. I have *no* idea why it's posting that way but I wish it'd stop, LOL! Denise- Girl, I meant to reply to your post before- I've been so busy the last week or so at work. I wanted to send an e-card too. That would've been nice to send a general holiday card 'signed' by all of us to Rick and whomever else we wanted to. Sherry- About the Survivor winner, I was sort of surprised- I was more hopeful that Sandra would win- and was a little surprised that Lil didn't get it for the sympathy factor. LOL, OK- what did you do to blogger? Why is your post from the 23rd at the top? It was funny, 'cause on the 24th, I didn't think anyone had posted yet & then I thought I was losing my posts- they were all below yours- LOL! I hope you had a great time at your parents house! I can't believe your hubby has to work on Christmas Day! :-( Congrats on the "A's" for your classes! That's great! AND congrats on the 30.6 lb total weight loss! :-) I *will* get back down to my maintenance weight- that's my New Year's resolution. Once I get over this cold, I'm going to excercise and NOTHING- not even Krispy Kremes will sway me from budging from my plan! :-) I'm sorry to hear that your temp job boss is a jerk. That's so mean and uncool to reprimand people like that- in front of everyone and not even giving people a chance. I guess he thinks he's perfect.... hang in there! Hopefully (and would like to think "fortunately") that type of boss is rare- he sounds like he's on the extreme. LOL about thinking of me when you saw Todd on last weekend- I *think* I caught that- but I'm not sure- this last week's been a blur. We were more busy than usual last weekend (with getting the sofa & lights & stuff). He sure has been missing in action. Teri- I'm sorry you missed the quake, but glad you're OK! :-) I think I was sitting at my desk at work- but didn't feel it. You probably just thought you hit a pothole, LOL! Glad your kids were ok & did what they were told. I've always heard that animals act oddly before an earthquake....but what if your pet is just odd all of the time? ;-p The candlelight service sounds like it will be (was) beautiful! Jen- Of course we noticed that it's been awhile since you've posted! Girl, you need to post more often! :-) Sonoma & Napa are considered wine country- but maybe Napa is more notable? They had reports that people in Sacramento (northeast of Sonoma) felt it, but I don't know. I suppose it just depends on the type of land you're on. They have lots of minor earthquakes around the towns of Clearlake and Humboldt. He probably knows where those towns are. Sonoma isn't too far from where we are- maybe 30 miles? What kind of dog do you have? I meant to ask you that before, but keep forgetting.... the "Santa tale" was cute- LOL, I think I would've been like "I'm not *your* little girl, Santa!" LOL. That would actually be kinda creepy to me. It sounded like fun though- good answer in the end! :-) Nan-Wow, I'm just amazed that you felt that quake so much being 300 miles away. Never underestimate the power of mother nature! I don't think anyone felt it in our office- no one's commented on it at all. Of course, our family duly called us that night to "make sure we were ok", LOL! I have to laugh because neither of us felt it. I know they worry, though. They hear "earthquake in CA" and it's like Pavlov's Response- they call to make sure we're OK. Kevin's son didn't feel it in Fresno, but then again, maybe he wasn't really paying attention- LOL! Anyway.....so I hope ya'll are having a good after-Christmas weekend! I had a long weekend (4 day) and have another next week- our company was super generous this year and gave us TWO four day weekends in a row! Not sure if that will ever happen again while I'm there, so I'm soaking it up for all it's worth. Oh yeah- my stepson is supposed to be proposing to his girlfriend tonight- I'll let ya'll know what happens. They won't get married till he's done with school (another 4 years)- which is a smart decision considering everything that they need to work out/work on in that time. Later!!

 Hi guys. Hope you all had a nice Christmas! Wow - both Greg K and Rick L worked on Christmas!

 Just another quick postie! (disclaimer before I start writing away)- the vp of our underwriting dept opened up a couple of bottles of wine (white) for a little celebration....I've had about 2....working on three. MIND you though, these are SMALL cups. I'm not a white wine person- I prefer red, but this was pretty good. And I'm feeling pretty good- perhaps the *BEST* I've ever felt at work! ;-) LOL! Hmm....Rick in a leather jacket- sounds like a mighty fine sight! Doubt that I'll get home in time for FR though & I didn't set the vcr. There's always tomorrow or Friday though. I can't think of anyone that a leather jacket *doesn't* look good on. Anyway.....gotta eat my sandwich and get back to work!

 Merry Christmas Levengals! I hope everyone has a great day tomorrow and to sit down with your eggnog and remember "the reason for the season!"! I'm going to the chapels candle light service tonight. I can't wait. I haven't been to one of thoes in years (my old church didn't do that).These services tend to be beautiful, everyone holds a candle and that's the only light in the place...OK I'm droning on and on... Since the library is close for the next 4 days i'll try to post from my hubby's job.In the mean time Merry Christmas and don't over indulge on the spiked eggnog!LOL! Slan leat!

 Drat it! I just lost my post! Blogger is the Christmas Grinch. Rick has been on this morning reporting from Bethlehem and looking good in a black leather jacket and blue shirt. Greg K. has also been on reporting on the terror alert. Greg is wearing a gray suit, white shirt and blue tie and looking pretty enough to be adorned with a red bow and placed under a Christmas tree. Lol! Dan Springer, looking hot in casual clothes, and Jeff Goldblatt, not looking so hot in a boring suit and tie, have also been on this morning reporting on the mad cow story, so it's been a good day so far for the hotties. Perhaps Adam and Todd will also show up today. I'm very relieved that the Ca. girls are safe following the earthquake. Nan, Natalie and Teri, I immediately thought about you all when the earthquake story broke. For those of you who have missed Fox&Friends this week, Mike Jerrick and James Rosen have been hilarious. F&F showed photos from the White House Christmas party, including a photo of James' mother, who is quite an attractive lady. This prompted Mike to start ribbing James about his mother, including pretending to be on the phone with her, having a flirtatious conversation while James was making a report. James reacted with feigned indignation. These are two very funny guys, and the more that I see of them, the more that I like them. I hope that all of the LevenGals will have a Very Merry Christmas and that the New Year will bring more appearances by our favorite hotties.

 A Christmas present for the LevenGals -- Rick showed up this morning reporting from Bethlehem. Rick was looking good in a black leather jacket and a blue shirt and was reporting on Christmas in Bethlehem. Greg K. has also been on this morning reporting on the terror alert. Greg is wearing a gray suit that's new I think, a white shirt and blue tie and is looking pretty enough to be tied up with a red ribbon and placed under a Christmas tree. Lol! Dan Springer has also been on reporting on mad cow disease and Jeff Goldblatt has made a report on the economic fallout from mad cow. Dan looks hot in casual clothes, but Jeff is in a studio and wearing a suit and tie. Jeff looks so much better in the outdoors, wearing casual clothes with the wind blowing through his hair. This is turning out to be a very good day for the hotties. Now if only Adam and Todd will show up. Aside from this morning, I haven't seen much on Fox this week, but have been watching Fox&Friends tapes this week. Mike Jerrick and James Rosen have been hilarious on F&F. James took his mother to the White House Christmas party, and Mike has been ribbing James about his very attractive mother, including pretending to be talking to James' mother on the phone while James was making his report. James has reacted with feigned indignation. These are two very funny guys and the more that I see of them, the more that I like them. Nan, Natalie and Teri - When I heard about the Ca. earthquake, the first thing that I thought about was the three of you. I'm very relieved that you're all safe and sound. I want to wish all of the LevenGals a Very Merry Christmas.

 Hey girlies! Just a quick post to say HAPPY CHRISTMAS EVE!! I'm at work.....ick. Anyway, I wanted to send each of you e-cards but only have some of your email addresses here at work. I have Sherry's, Melissa's, Jen's, Leslie's, and Jan's- if you other girls check in, please email me at knoneill@pacbell.net- I don't want to leave anyone out! I can check my home email from here, but unfortunately I didn't import my address book from the old computer to the new one yet & I didn't import the old addy book to the sbc/yahoo email. So...... If all else fails, EVERYONE HAVE A VERY MERRY AND SAFE CHRISTMAS!! ;-)

 Good Morning Levengals!! I just wanted to do a quick post before I head out of town for a couple days. We are going to my parents today and tomorrow since my hubby is off. He has to work on Christmas Days!! I hope all the CA Levengals are okay. I hear you all had a little shake rattle and roll out there. Well I turned on H&C last night and who was on there at the top of the hour but my Adam. It was great to see his face. It has been so long I almost forgot what he looked like. Sweet Dreams for me NAN - Thanks for finally returning Adam - we all know you had him - LOL Good news - I got A's in all three of my classes. I was so excited. It is so great to have a break and not have school. It doesn't start up again until Jan 26th so that is a nice break. Also I haven't done a Weight update in a while. Well the week after Thanksgiving I lost .8 pounds and then the next week I gained .4 pounds and last week I didn't weigh in because I had gone to New York. Well this week I lost 1.8 pounds and I finally got to 30.6 pounds lost. Merry Christmas too me. Of course the next 3 days are going to be my big challenge but I'm going to enjoy myself and get right back on program after Thursday. I'm also going to try to keep up my exercising so I can Bad news - I know I told you all I got that temp job that runs until April 30th. Well I have been going in a couple days here and there for training and the job is not bad and I like the Office Manager but the owner/boss is a real jerk and I don't think I like him very much. I'm trying to give it a chance but don't know if it is going to work out. He is the type of boss that will yell at you in front of everyone if you did something wrong and he talks down to you. I 'm new and still obviously learning and he just seems like I should know everything. I'm looking elsewhere for something and might have to quit there if I find something else. I just hate people that disrepect their employees and treat them that way. I was a supervisor for many years and I never did that. Oh well, I'll keep you posted on how it goes. Nat - I did get to see your Todd last weekend. Haven't seen him in ages and I instantly thought of you. Well gotta go. Hitting the road soon and gotta pack the car. If I don't post again before Thursday I hope everyone has a VERY MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!!

 My first earthquake in years and I missed it! My hubby and I were in the car when it hit. The kids were at home and felt it. When they figured out what was happening they each grabbed a cat and stood in a door frame (as I taught them). They weren't scared either. I hope everyone is well and the blog will liven up! Slan Leat!

 Hey guys *gasp* 2 posts in a week from me! I'll give you guys all a chance to recover haha... All my California chickies I hope you guys are all okay and stayed away from windows and what? stayed in hallways? (I'm so like not educated about earthquakes) my boyfriend's family live in Sonoma (is that wine country or is Napa wine country) was Sonoma near the Earthquake? You know my boyfriend works a lot when I hear about things before him, he was like "there was an earthquake?" So tonight my old man :-p and I went around his development to look at houses, we started out walking but it's so big we finished it by driving and uh *wow* some of those people have either a lot of money or a lot of time on their hands (prob both) I mean there were some houses with *FOUR* X-mas trees, they had lights and images and such superimposed (SP?) on the garage doors, gateways, balcony's - I saw some light displays that were bigger than my room...as if I wasn't already a Grinch these houses really brought it home, my mom and I just don't get into the whole Christmas decorating deal, maybe b/c we're renters but we don't have a tree or lights or anything and my boyfriend...well he's working on Christmas so I guess he figures 'no need' - I did get him a new tie and gift card to the Sharper Image - me? Well I have to wait until the day after for my gift :-( oh well if I don't like it at least the mall will be open to return it :-p just joking of course. Oh! I didn't say this in Sunday's post, but last week my super spoiled dog (who's king) got to go to PetsMart and get his picture taken with Santa - he's (my dog) 'mommy's' fat baby and after two attempts Santa had to help me get my fat baby on his lap and then he tried to get down and wouldn't stay put unless I squatted next to him to keep him calm :-p so anyway having said that - this weekend my boyfriend and I were shopping in between Christmas parties and *I* got to visit Santa, I got to sit on his lap and have him give me a 'ho ho ho' and 'have you been a good girl this year?' and 'what do you want for Christmas little girl' (I think Santa liked saying 'little girl' to me a little too much) I was like "hmm should I ask him for the Victoria's Secret items on my wish list? Various Fox reporters on my doorstep? Heck my own boyfriend on my doorstep?" but I told Santa I was a good girl (I could hear my boyfriend laughing) and just told him I wanted everything I had on my Christmas list - got a picture taken with him and called it a day. Well that sums up my day and Santa tales, like I said in my post on Sunday I hope everyone takes care and has safe and happy holidays - any of you gals cooking good luck if you need it! I know I'll need it! :-D

 Hi LevenGals!!! We are a rockin' and a rollin' here in CA again. My heart and prayers go out to the people seriously effected by the earthquake. So far only 1 death reported. Most of the damage seems to be superficial, except for a few isolated buildings collapsing. If you're interested in seeing where the earthquake and aftershocks are located and their size, you can check out the following website: http://www.data.scec.org:3128/recenteqs/Maps/121-35.html Nat - We definitely felt the earthquake. The epicenter is about 300 miles due west of us. It's actually in the part of the coast we go to for vacation all the time. My desk was rolling and the blinds in my office were shaking. Hubby said the water in the pool was splashing out at home. Definitely knew we were experiencing an earthquake. Teri - Hope all is well with you.

 Hey Teri! Did you feel the earthquakes??? It looks like there were 5 earthquakes around your area between 11:15 and 11:45! It looks like the biggest was 6.4 at 11:15 & all the others are aftershocks between 3.3 & 4.0- that's the largest I've seen in awhile around here in CA! Be careful what you wish for- now look what you've done! Just kidding! But *seriously*, I hope you're all OK. Nan- did you feel it?? I'm thinking you may be too far south & west to have felt it.....there's been reports that people here felt it (at the SF Federal bldg), but I know I didn't feel it myself. I'll post more later..... EDIT: There's been even *more* aftershocks reported- I get earthquake emails for 3.0's & above- I've gotten 15 so far..... and those aren't even including the minor minor aftershocks. I'll bet there's been hundreds of those (like 1.0 to 2.9).

 Hey everyone well long time no post or did you guys just not notice me gone? Anyway just thought I'd see if everyone was smart and got their shopping done early or waited like me and went into the abyss this weekend or next week Okay so to the *really* good news - today I got the BEST early x-mas gift I mean this is better than *any* Fox reporter doing anything for me - my best friend, my best guy friend from since I was like 7 or 8..I saw him today! I haven't seen him in like two years, he's an army pilot he had been over in Iraq and the middle east and came home early b/c he just went through so much (not that no one else went through and saw things that were horrible) but my friend Edward really went through somethin' so he got out early and he's transfering to I think a training division

 Hi all. Greg is reporting from the Pentagon today on a Shepard-less Studio B.

 Hi, ladies! I managed to catch Rick on with Linda Vester today and also saw him on Studio B. Rick looked good, despite the fact that he was wearing the black sweater again. Lol! We may not get to see any more Rick-Shep moments until after Christmas, as Shep mentioned taking some time off. Todd Connor was also on Studio B and may be shown again on Fox Report. Todd was reporting on charges that some juvenile offenders had been abused and was wearing a black leather jacket and a black (I think) shirt underneath. He looked good, also. Tidbits: It was mentioned on Studio B that some Fox people had been invited to a party at the White House tonight. On Fox&Friends today, it was revealed that Bret Baier became engaged the night before Thanksgiving. The bride-to-be is named Amy and lives in Chicago. Also on F&F this week, James Rosen mentioned that he had been on a leave of absence in order to work on his "masterpiece." Sunday's coverage of Saddam's capture resulted in Fox News being ranked Number 11 in cable ratings for the week ending Dec. 14. (This includes all of the entertainment and sports channels.) Although reluctant to mention that "other" news channel favorably, I have to recommend that those of you interested in the immigration issue should watch Lou Dobbs on CNN. He's doing a series called "Broken Borders" and is astonishingly blunt in discussing immigration, far more so than either Fox or MSNBC. He scolded a CNN reporter about referrring to illegal aliens as "immigrants" and told an immigration proponent who said that "Only citizens should be allowed to vote, BUT..." that "but" shouldn't even be a part of the sentence. BTW, did any of you know that a UCLA study has recommended that non-citizens should be allowed to vote in Ca.? In my area, Lou Dobbs' show is shown in the early evening and repeated later at night, so you wouldn't necessarily have to choose between watching his show and watching Fox programming.

 Hi all. Greg K. surprisingly appeared on Greta Van Sustern's show last night. Didn't expect it. Rick L. appeared on Linda Vester's show. Forgot to add - When David Asman interviewed the twin Army captains who were honored for their bravery, he mentioned Greg K.

 Hello everyone! Nat- I'm glad you got the goods ok. Mail is slow this time of year. HAPPY CHANNUKA to our Jewish bloggers! Nat your neglecting your group page. Jen(i hope that's the correct name-i'm horrible with names, i apologize!) and I are going to rename it Our Page!LOL! Did you all hear! JOhnnie Cocklin(of OJ fame) is going to represent Wacko Jacko! Can you say "just release the child molester and be done with it". What a joke. Well, take care all until next time! Slan leat!

 Good Evening Levengals!! It sure was great seeing Rick on alot this morning. I assume he will probably be over there a couple weeks. Now if I could just see my Adam then I would be happy. Jayel - I caught Dan's reports too about the prison workers. I haven't seen Greg K. today either but I think I read somewhere that today is his birthday. He usually appears on Thursday through Sunday lately. I guess being the new guy in DC he gets the weekend shifts. I saw James Rosen for the first time the other day in what seemed like months. I used to see him every morning but lately he wasn't on much. Nat - I read the article and that was great that he kept in touch with those guys. Ellen and Nat - I missed Survivor - completely forgot it was on but got the scoop from my mom. I missed a lot of it this time because I had class on Thursday nights so I would catch it here and there. Were you all surprised by the winner?? Denise - I agree it was great to wake up to Rick this morning. NYC was hopping and very beautiful for the holidays. I think next year we are going to go around May when it is warmer and less busy maybe. I don't know if NYC is ever not busy but the holidays are really bad. It is only a 4 hour drive from my house so it is an easy weekend trip. I know it was snowing again today. It didn't amount to anything. Well gonna go watch That 70's Show and The OC. Have a great night everyone.

 Hi girls. Caught Rick on F&F today. I love to wake up that way, seeing his reports first thing in the morning, kinda sets the mood for the day! I think since this is the first Christmas that the Levengals have existed as one, we should send a Christmas card or something, I know he is out of the country but I think it would make him smile. Then again you guys probably already discussed this idea while I was away.... I getting getting ready to leave work and sit in traffic and watch the snow flurries so I'll check in later!

 Sherry - Rick has been on TV several times this morning beginning with Fox&Friends. In one of his reports, he was wearing a good-looking beige jacket with an olive green collar over his sweater and T-shirt. It's so nice to count on seeing Rick on a regular basis, and he does have interesting things on which to report. It looks as if Rick may be in Iraq for Christmas. If any of you missed Rick's reports yesterday on the sculpture created by an Iraqi artist, this is a beautiful and touching sculpture. It shows a kneeling American soldier, grieving over a fallen comrade and being comforted by a little Iraqi girl. The sculpture was made from a melted down Saddam statue and will eventually be put on display at Fort Hood. Greg K. hasn't shown up for the third day in a row, so I wonder where he could be. Dan Springer has been reporting on convict labor, but he and Rick are the only hotties that I've spotted today. I've come across several articles reporting that Roger Ailes has signed a contract to continue running Fox News. The contract is believed to be for three years, and is said to involved a raise on the 8.6 million that he made last year. Advertising profits rose more than 30% for Fox News in the most recent quarter.

 FOX HOTTIE ALERT!! Rick was just on F&F this morning about 7:00 est time. He is wearing a tan ribbed sweater today. Well I'll post more later. I got to get moving early this morning and hit the stores and try to get my last few gifts I need.

 Hey gals! Dang- I *knew* I should have set the VCR- just ran out of time. I set it yesterday, but didn't watch. Oh well! Tomorrow I'll set it. Good thing is, that Cavuto repeats at 10 PM my time :-) Looks like he was on in the first 20 minutes, which is even better- I think I can make it up to 10:20 (I hope!!). Green sweater AND green shirt, huh?? That is really.....weird- I mention it yesterday & lo and behold.....maybe he's checking out the old blog, LOL! J/K! Jayel- Thanks for the Rick sighting & ratings! Fox is still kicking butt- YAY! ;-) I agree- it'd be nice to see him with the troops again, but then it can be very dangerous. I hope they all stay safe! You know, I was thinking the same thing- that it would have been great if Rick had been the one to do the rat hole thing- but still, it was interesting to see that video. Gave a great perspective to the whole situation of how they got Saddam. Thanks for the compliments on the cross- it really does look very impressive in person. I can look up through the back 'window' or hatch and see it at night. Reminds me of more of the true meaning of Christmas. AH- Thanks for the Rick update too! :-) Teri- I got the package yesterday- finally! Only took one week to go from the Monterey area to the SF Bay area- I could have done the whole trip on foot in that time, LOL! Oh well, it *IS* a busy mail season..... OK- need to get back to work! Hopefully I'll get home in time to catch one of Rick's reports on Fox Report or one of the later shows......Later!

 a h - Thanks for the word on Rick in Tikrit. I taped some of Fox's coverage this morning, but I never tape Linda Vester. I like her, but I don't like audience participation shows. Drat the luck! Anyway, at least we know that we can expect to see more of Rick in Iraq, and there's the chance that Greg will join him. Yea! I just saw Rick on with Neal Cavuto, and he's wearing a GREEN sweater (and a green T-shirt) and looking very good in it! Natalie, Rick must have either read your suggestion on getting a green sweater, or else you're communicating with him by mental telepathy. Good work, Nat! Cable News Ratings for Monday, 12-15: O'Reilly: 2.7 Hannity & Colmes: 1.7 Shep: 1.8 Greta: 1.6 Brit: 1.6 Larry King: 1.3 Paula Zahn: 1.1 Aaron Brown: 0.8 MSNBC: 0.4 across the board I hope that Rick gets to spend lots of time with the soldiers, but that can be dangerous. The two journalists who were injured recently in Iraq were traveling in a humvee with soldiers on patrol. Someone threw a grenade into the vehicle, and one of the journalists picked it up and threw it out of the vehicle. When it exploded, it blew off his hand and he also had other injuries.

 Hi guys. Rick is in Tikrit! He's been reporting there all morning-midday. He was just on with Linda Vester. He was interviewing a female soldier and he was standing very close to her face. Also, before that, he showed a really neat sculpture of an American soldier. Now, where's Greg? Yes, it would have great if Greg K. had been doing what Greg P. got to do, but it didn't work out that way. Greg K. went back to Iraq 3 times (?) after the initial war, and it would have been very exciting if Greg K. got to cover the capture first hand.

 Hey, LevenGals, David Lee Miller is now in Jerusalem, so Rick may be gone from the area. Who do ya suppose will be assigned to Iraq during Christmas? a h - I was watching Greg P. climbing in and out of Saddam's rat hole today and thinking that it would have been great if Greg K. had been doing that and Rick had been talking to the troops who found Saddam, but that's not the way it went. Assuming that Osama is still alive, maybe Rick or Greg K. will be on the scene when he's found. Natalie - The cross on your boat looks beautiful. Yes, I think that a forest green sweater would be a good choice for Rick. In addition to Rick's always present (black? charcoal gray?) sweater, I'm beginning to think that someone must have stolen all of Greg K.'s suits, except for the pin-striped one that he's been wearing all the time recently. Hmmm... I guess that shopping isn't one of the favorite activities for a couple of our hottie guys. Denise - I think that the book that you saw in Barnes & Noble was "Embedded: The Media At War In Iraq." I ordered the book from Amazon and I'm almost through reading it. Anyone who was riveted by the war coverage would likely enjoy this book. I had thought that there might be a lot of similarity in the various interviews, but the distinctly individual personalities of the reporters make all of the interviews different and interesting. Greg K. was mentioned in the book, but wasn't interviewed.

 Nat- it was Parelle Dreams. After Christmas I want to order the other two! I was listening to Rush this morning and it was funny! He was telling the dems reply to Sadams capture etc. it was great! I also watched the Pres. speech. That poor man has to answer the dumbest q's from idiot reporters. You could see the look of fustration and discust on his face. Anyway, have a great day!

 Hi all. What an exciting news day yesterday! Great news for America! (It would have been a little more fantastic if Rick or Greg covered the capture first hand.)

 Hey Gals! Nothing like Saddam's capture to get everyone to come out of the woodwork! ;-) It is *truly* a wonderful day! OK- I've posted some pix of our boat with the lights (and the giant cross). You should be able to click here urlLink lights . There's only 5 pix up of the boat- they're the last two. If that doesn't work, go here urlLink Myst of Avalon , click on 'pictures' and then 'Excalibur'. Jayel- I think I woke up too late to see Rick ;-P Oh well! I thought it's great that he's keeping in contact with the soldiers too- those will be priceless contacts that will last a lifetime. I agree- he needs more sweater choices, lol! How about a nice forest green? ;-) I agree- the capture is going to drive some people absolutely crazy. Sherry- Glad you had a lot of fun in NY- sorry you had to cut it short! Ground Zero must have been tremendously moving (in a bad way); I'll bet it was very sad to see. Christmas Story! One of my favorite holiday movies ;-). I've heard the DC metro is *much* better than the NY subway. I'm with you- it's an *awesome* day to be an American and I'm *so proud* to be! :-) Teri- Hopefully the package will be here tomorrow- I'll keep you posted (lol, literally!). I told my hubby- he's very proud of his light job! ;-) Sounds like you may have gotten "Elemental" or "Parallel Dreams"- McKennitt's earlier cd's - they're all pretty good, but I tend to listen to the Visit, Mask & the Mirror, and the Book of Secrets the most. Ellen!- So good to see you posting- don't be a stranger! :-) I'm counting down the minutes to Survivor - 3 left! I know not all dems will be disappointed that Saddam was found, but I know there are some out there who will find a way to turn it against Bush. I'm glad that you see it as a good thing- and I'm sure there are many many others who see it good too. Although I'm a conservative, I have to applaud Lieberman for much of what he said today about the find. OK- Survivor's on, hubby took more pix for me to download, and get the laundry out. Later!

 What a great day. The ace of spades is captured. I aso happy for m glad that he was captured alive, this way the world will get to see the horrid things he did and his cowardly response to them. How can the rest of the world deny that this is a good thing to see the Iraqi people jubilant in the streets, I can't even imagine being that happy about anything, I've been free my whole life. I am so happy to see their joy! Sherry Your trip to NYC sounds very interesting, I bet the city is really alive uring the holidays, how neat! I woke up this morning to see about an inch of snow on my car and by his evening it is frozen on my windshield UGH! I was hoping that the winter weather would hold out for awhile. Melissa I haven't seen you posting in awhile then again look who's talking, I've been MIA for a little while. How have you been girl? Still photographing the world? Janice I was thinking the same thing about the anti Bush Hollywood left. What are they going to say now? that it was wrong to have gone after him? I wonder what is going to come out of their mouths in the next few days....I saw Greg's haircut, what an easy way to style hair just shave it every few months! He still looks adorable though! Nat I haven't gotten a chance to read the article yet, but I will read it as soon as I am done posting. I forgot to mention this to you guys, maybe you have seen it, but I was in Barnes and Nobles the other day and wandered to the poltical section, I noticed a book that was a colaboration of reporters and they had several embeds write some stuff from magazines, tv, newspapers, etc and Rick has a chapter (although a short one) It was interseting (no Greg though), I thought I wrote down the name of it but I can't find it, but I'm sure if you look in that section...your article may be from that book I haven't read it yet. Ok I am going to go read the article. Later girls!

 just a quick post b 4 survivor comes on. yeah, they got saddam, with no struggle. i am one democrat who is very happy for the capture of saddam, and i doubt i'm the only one. i did not vote for bush, nor did i want to go to war, but i truely supported our troops over there. oh what a great day it is. thanks, natalie, for the rick link.

 Well I'm finally getting around to posting again. I had to tear myself away from the tv. What a great day today is. Well New York was a lot of fun but cold and of course we had to come home a day early because of the weather. I got to go by the Fox News studio and take some pictures outside. Fox and Friends was already over on Friday when we got there but I saw Julian and Juliet through the windows still sitting in their chairs so that was cool. Went to Ground Zero and it is really sad to look at that. They have all the names of the people that died up on a sign and they have other pictures up of before and after. Went up the Empire State Building (after waiting in line for an hour) and got to see the whole city at night from up there. Went to Macy's and their windows were awesome. They used the Christmas Story as their theme and had all the windows done in a different scene from the movie. I actually got the subway down after riding a couple times. I'm used to the DC Metro which is much nicer and easier to ride. Jayel - That is so funny what you said about the Dems. I said the same thing to my husband and he actually wrote a letter to our editor about Saddam being captured and how he is sure the liberals will find a way to say that when Bush speaks to the nation that he will some how be grandstanding. Melissa - Glad to see you posting. Welcome back. Nat - Thanks for sharing the article, I'm going there to read it now. Well we actually only got about 4 inches of snow here in Maryland but we did get a little sleet too but it is supposed to be int he 40's the next two days so that will keep everything from freezing. We got off easier than expected. Well I gotta go. Today is such a great day and I'm so proud to be an American and now hopefully the Iraqi people can truly feel free from the horrible life they have had to live. God bless our troops and hopefully they will stay safe.

 I found out about Saddam at church. What a catch! Now if it was Clinton...he would have released him (remember, he had a chance with Bin Ladan was it 3 or 5 times and let him go). Anyway, I took down my "wanted" picture (remember that one? it had saddam and his worthless sons with the reward posted?) today after marking yesterdays date. Melissa-it's good to see you post! Your such a spectre(right word for spirit?) here lately! Nat-no package yet! That sucks. I like the cross idea! Tell your hubby from me "you go boy!" I got 2 more McKennit CD's. The Visit and I forgot the title of the other one.She's by a harp (that describes 3 of her's) and it has a song about the Orkney isles? Well, everyone have a great day!

 OMG you guys I JUST got up! This is the best news in the whole world! When I switched it to FOX I nearly flipped a lid! OMG......I just can't believe it. This gives me so much hope! We got a new computer, a Dell, on Friday. Our old computer shot craps and died on us. So it's nice to be back online. I'm gonna go watch the new, and then I'll be back later. I still can't believe the great new! I just hope I'm not still asleep dreaming or something. LOL

 What a great day! What wonderful military people that we have! Like everyone else, I'm hopeful that Saddam's capture will cut down drastically on our soldiers being injured and killed. Natalie - Thanks for the link to Rick's article. I saw Rick on TV this morning mentioning by name some of the soldiers that he had been embedded with and saying that he had called them with the news of Saddam's capture. It's nice to know that Rick is keeping in touch with soldiers that he became friends with in Iraq. Rick was (again) wearing the ribbed knit sweater that does nothing for him. I guess that I'm gonna have to run over to Israel and trash the sweater so that he'll have to get something more attractive to wear. Lol! There are so many ramifications involving Saddam's capture, but I immediately thought of how unhappy (despite their trying to pretend otherwise) that the Dems and other Bush haters must be. The Hollywood Left, CBS, ABC, and CNN (NBC seems to be more neutral) have to regard the capture as an enormous setback to their anti-Bush agenda. In regard to our hotties, I don't know if they'll be spending much time in Iraq in the future. There has been talk on Fox today that military action may soon shift back to Afghanistan, so they could go there as the story in Iraq winds down. Natalie again - It did look as if Greg K. had gotten a haircut and a too short cut at that. You girls with all of the snow, I envy you. I know that it would be horrible to drive in, but it's so beautiful. We hardly ever get even one inch of snow in S. Al. All we ever get is rain. Bah! Humbug!

 Hey gals, I keep checking the Fox site- I've got FNC on & keep hitting refresh to get all the stories- I just can't get enough over this- OH HAPPY HAPPY DAY!!! One of the new stories they put up was "Reporter's Notebook: Troops Vindicated" written by Rick. Here's the link (you shouldn't need to be signed in to read this- it's on the opening Fox site page). urlLink Reporter's Notebook: Troops Vindicated .

 YAY!!! THEY GOT HIM!!!! I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the tv this morning! Kevin wanted to put it on the music station -figured it'd be better for the ongoing sinus headache than the news- but I insisted on Fox!;-) I just can't believe it- I'm so overjoyed right now. I'm really hoping & praying that this event will stop all the horrible ambushes and such going on over there. God bless our troops!!

 OMG WE GOT SADDAM!!! I couldn't believe it when I turned on the news. They are doing the news conference now. I'll post more later. I came back from NY a day earlier because we are getting a nasty storm here in Maryland again.

 Hi Gals, "Let it stop, let it stop, let it stop" Natalie, I'd much rather keep Christmas in Christmas and take out the freakin' winter thing!!! Our 'snow flurries' turned into about 5 inches, and it's still going. I would think it's beautiful and all that except that I have to work this weekend and that means driving in it. It took me 30 minutes to get to the hospital today and opposed to the usual 10. Cars in the ditches everywhere, you'd think they'd never driven in winter before---HELLO---it comes once a year!!! Now that I have that out of my system, I did take the dog out in the snow and he just loves it. Now that I'm safely home, it IS rather pretty. My cats are thoroughly loving the tree, it makes a great hiding place, and it is extremely fun to jump from the tree to the chair....I didn't even put up the 'good' ornaments because I had a suspicion that it might be like this. I really don't have much to add, but I wanted to stop by and blog before everyone forgot me :-)

 Hey Gals! Just lost my post, so I'm starting over..... Well, it's official: I work with the Grinch. My manager & another co-worker were going gung ho putting up lights & stuff early yesterday morning. My manager went to Walgreen's & got more garland & a few extension cords. I have swag lights around the outside of my cubicle and garland & lights on top of my cabinets :-) My manager & another manager put garland around the hallway areas (which would be on the outside of the miserable coworker that sits behind me). So, a bit later, I hear the bad-attitude-miserable-co-worker tell one of her buddies, "I don't know who put that up there, but I'm going to find out and take it down." While I bristled at her comment, I wryly smiled to myself since I knew who it was- our manager. So now there's a decorating contest between the 5 units in underwriting and my manager really wants to win (I do too). I told her about what the other girl had said and she said, "whatEVER"- LOL!! It was so funny. People there just know what a poor attitude this girl has- it's no secret. So now I have the decorating bug & got a 1 ft fake tree & mini ornaments at Walgreen's for home (which my cat duly knocked down and scattered the ornaments everywhere while we were out). Kevin put up an 18 x 10 ft cross of lights up on our mast- because of the meaning of Christmas; but we also came up with the idea when we heard about these far left libs who want to take the real meaning out of Christmas (you know, the whole changing "Christmas" to "winter" thing). So we're going to have a cross up on the mast & icicle lights going around the bow of the boat. Our marina has a deal this month where if you put up lights,they pay for your December electric bill- I didn't know about that till today. I'll take some photos & put them up on my site (I'll post the link here). Although a *small* portion of me wonders what could happen by having it up there..... you know how people can be. Jayel- It's been raining here quite a bit this last week or so. Unfortunately it's playing havoc with my sinuses- I've basically had varying degrees of sinus headaches the last week or so. Not bad unless I'm moving around a lot & bending down a lot (as was with today since I was cleaning & putting up decorations, etc). I got to see Rick a couple of times today- that's always a treat when I can catch him on there. Greg's been on a few times today too- is it just me, or does he look like he's gotten a haircut in the last couple of days? Thanks for the ratings- Larry King didn't even make it, huh? I checked out the site that you posted (www.numbersusa.com) and signed up for the email newsletters. I haven't sent the fax yet but I plan to. I checked out the report cards, though- pretty bad for a lot of them! Teri- Girl, as of yesterday I still haven't gotten the package yet :-( I think my post office is horribly hopelessly behind. I asked them Thursday & they said they didn't have anything for me- maybe Monday?? Our box has been very empty this week- more so than usual. I suspect a hang-up somewhere along the line. It's weird- they're saying that Arnold took away the DLs to illegals, but then when Sean Hannity interviewed him (they had it on H & C last week) he sidestepped the question when Hannity asked him about it. Savage was talking about it on his radio show & said that Arnold didn't completely take it away- it seems to me that there's going to be some amending to it. I know...it's so frustrating. I found out something this week- one of my co-workers is in the CA National Guard and is most likely going to Iraq pretty soon. It's weird- I know ya'll may have known someone who's been sent somewhere, but this is the first for me. I don't know him really at all, but he seems like such a good natured guy & it's kinda sad to hear that he will have to go. He seemed to take it in stride though- as I said he's a good natured kind of person. My supervisor said that he told her that he'd be gone for 18 months. I told him that our prayers will be with him and with all the others over there too. Anyway.... need to take the contacts out & check on the laundry. I'll check in with ya'll tomorrow!

 It's raining like crazy here today, but Rick was on a little while ago to brighten things up a bit. Rick is still in Israel and was wearing an olive green T-shirt and a ribbed knit black sweater that must be one of his favorites. Methinks that our Rick needs some new sweaters, and it would be nice to see him in a red or blue sweater.

 Cable News Ratings for 12/10: O'Reilly: 1.8 Hannity & Colmes: 1.3 Shep: 1.1 Brit: 1.0 Greta: 0.9 Aaron Brown: 0.7 Paula Zahn: 0.6 MSNBC''s highest rating: 0.3 This is another instance in which Shep has had a higher rating than Greta. There's probably more than one reason for this, but perhaps the viewers are tired of the legal issues that usually dominate Greta's show.

 Hi, LevenGals! For those of you who think that Carl Cameron is a hottie, this has been a week to make your hearts beat faster. Lol! All in all, this is turning out to be a fairly good (could be better) week for the hotties. I caught a couple of Rick's reports today and was a little surprised to see him still in Israel. Greg K. was on a little while ago, standing outside with the wind ruffling his hair and looking chilly, and Dan Springer was also on today. Jeff Goldblatt seems to have disappeared as have Adam and Todd. Natalie and the rest of you concerned about immigration - There is a very informative web site which will send free faxes for you to public officials on immigration issues. Once you fill out the registration, they will keep you updated on the latest news about immigration and will provide a pre-written choice of texts to be used on faxes. (You can add your own P.S. messages to the faxes, if you wish.) The web site is found at www.numbersusa.com. They currently have faxes up on the subject of Tom Ridge's recent statement advocating amnesty for millions of illegal aliens. I agree with you, Natalie. The guys have a special appeal when they're rumpled. I would love to see some of the hotties reporting from Iraq and wearing something other than suits and ties, except for the fact that it's so dangerous there. Shep reported today on a couple of journalists who had gotten injured in Iraq. I can't remember who they worked for, but they weren't Fox people. Denise - Be cautious when you're out riding around.

 Hi folks! I hate not having Fox! I missed Rick,Aw hell, I've been missing Rick. At least I have "The Picture" slobber slobber, drool drool!LOL! Nat- I didn't hear about the CA DL being legal to Illegals. Why don't we just roll out the red carpet on a talmac(right word?) of any and all major airports in the US and say "commy, commy terrorists, help your-selves to a plane!" I have to wonder if Nat'l Security isn't one big joke. It saddens me to say that...OK Nat-(again) I was gonna put in a plug for your web site. It's a good site!There, my plug. I'm a member! Well, I hope all you Levengals have a great day! Slan Leat!

 Hey Gals! It's been very quiet here this week! 'Course, who am I to talk? It's been almost a week since I've left a post...;-P Anyway.....OOH~ I *did* get to see Rick this morning on Fox & Friends. I missed the beginning; it was the voice I recognized, which I thought was funny~ I think because it was so early in the AM, and I was trying to figure out what to wear, and then all of a sudden it hit me: hey, that's Rick's voice! LOL (well OK, maybe you had to be there). I think I caught him around 5:05 PST, and then again at 6 (PST). What sucked about the 6:00 one was that I was trying to get my left contact lens in and it was burning and then hubby was standing in front of the TV. I saw the last minute or so and that was it- but hey, can't complain! Ah, the simple pleasures in life! I'm really surprised he's still over there- it's been what, 3 weeks? I was just wondering if they'd sent him back to NY since he hadn't been on for awhile. The dinner dance was nice- I liked last year's location better, though. Fortunately I wasn't really hungry (there's a new one) and I didn't even *touch* the desserts which is a miracle for me. Especially when they had 3 kinds of cake and a whole host of other goodies. **stepping onto soapbox** I *knew* this was going to happen- the CA drivers license for illegals sounds like it's just going to be tweaked a little instead of totally taken off the board altogether (as Ahnold said he was going to do). Now it sounds like they're talking of making it so illegals can get insurance which of *course* makes the illegals getting CA DLs *OK fine & dandy* now. NOT. Then there's Ashcroft who is saying oh, gee, let's just make the illegals here now LEGAL. WHAT????? People are going insane and trying to drag me with them.... **stepping off soapbox now** Jayel- Thanks for sharing the Ray Kelly poll- that's really cool that he has the highest approval rating of any official in NYC. I caught Rick on Saturday AM but not on Sunday- I woke up about 5 minutes after he was on (or at least I think, judging from your post). Sherry Have fun on your trip! Let us know how it was when you get back! LOL about sending a LevenGal to Jeff to warm him up! It's nice seeing him report more too. I caught just a glimpse of Adam when I got in last night. Jan- Girl, I hear ya! I was just telling my hubby the other night that I really like Christmas but people suck- especially mean and rude people. Don't work too much! And don't be a stranger here- we miss your posts. And that goes for Ellen, Leslie, Melissa, and any other missing LevenGals I might be leaving out. Where are ya'll?? Hmmm.... what is it about us liking our guys more ruffled up? I was thinking that this morning when I saw Rick- his hair looks super short and too....neat. I miss the skanky boonie hat & the rumpled up Rick, LOL! I've heard that Love Actually is really a good movie- I want to see it, but will probably wait for it to come out on DVD. It has a lot of good people in it- I love Hugh Grant & Liam Neeson. Denise! Of course we haven't forgotten about you! Been wondering what you've been up to, though! I hope you're having a great holiday season too! How sweet about your best friend's baby- think of the stories you both will tell her when she's older about things you guys used to do. BE SAFE there in Columbus! I hope they get whomever's doing that soon- how scary. The incident with your co-worker is definitely a little too close to home! Teri- It was good talking to you the other day! I'm *definitely* a Camelot fan (and for the record, I mean the *old* Camelot- not the "Kennedy Camelot"!)- actually any of the Arthurian legend stuff I *love*. Ok- anything Celtic, Irish, etc..... My post office is lame this week. I still haven't gotten the package- it *better* be here today- as a matter of fact, I've only gotten one piece of mail- a credit card offer no less, since Monday. I'd say someone's sleeping on the job there, LOL! I'll let you know when it gets here. For those of you who may be wondering what the heck "Mysts of Avalon" is, it's the group I set up on MSN so that I can post pix easily. I've also made it so you can leave messages if you want- one caveat to it though- you have to be a member. I thought I set it up differently, but I guess not! So, if you want to be a member on there too, just leave me a message to join. But PLEASE don't stop posting here- I *LOVE* this blog to death and love the company. This is just an invitation for anyone who wants to check it out. Also, you can post pix on there too by setting up your own photo album (let me know if you have trouble & I'll check the settings). For those of you who know the FNCC MSN site, they have a similar set up- anyone can set up their own photo albums on there. I think it makes it nice & easy to share pix with everyone. Anyway, the site is here: urlLink Myst of Avalon . REALLY need to get to work.....chat with ya'll later!

 HOTTIE ALERT!!! Rick was just on Fox and Friends about 7:05 est time. He is still in Israel and will probably be on more this morning since there is news going on over there. Well ladies I'm off to New York this morning. I will be back on Sunday so I'll post about my trip then. I'll have pictures to show everyone next week. Everybody have a great weekend.

 Hi ladies! Did you forget about me? I have been extremely busy, I know its a little late but I hope everyone had a wonderful Thanksgiving, and a good holiday season so far! I thought about everyone, but was unable to post at the time. My best friend had a baby, and I got to be in the delivery room, what an amazing thing to see her little girl. It has been a little tense here in Columbus, as the sniper is still at large. I drive that route frequently and I know several people that live in the area of the shootings. I was a little shaken up today as a girl that works on my floor was on her way to work this morning and had a gun pulled on her on that section of highway, she got to the gas station as she was talking to police. That is hitting a little too close to home for me. I had lunch in that neighborhood on Sat. Everytime I drive on the highway in this city I look around, anyone could hide and start shooting, there are any number of places in which to hide. I have been unable to catch Rick, has he been around. The only shows I can catch are Shep's and O'reilly, I saw Greg do a report on the other day, and Adam is starting to grow on me, he sems to possess that cool sense of humor. I have to go back to work, I will try to post tonight . Bye ladies!

 I got to see Adam today several times. I also saw Jeff but no other hotties. They seem to be missing again.

 Hottie Alert! Adam Housley has returned and will be reporting on a football story. I don't know whether or not this is Adam's first appearance of the day. Jeff Goldblatt is the only other hottie that I've seen today.

 Where is everyone? Nat- My husband is mailing a package to you from me today.More newspapers and three tapes. Enjoy. Also, where are you in Mysts of Avalon! You have two members now and your ignoring us! Don't make us take up Geraldo and Greg Kelly again!LOL! I hope everyone is doing well on this Monday! Slan leat!

 Hello everyone! Thanks for the well wishes!The Christmas concert went well and I was able to hit the saprano notes! I'm glad thats over. I'm still achey but will live!LOL! I talked to a friend in Maryland. SNOW! I'm so glad I don't have to shovel that again(We left MD in May).We're getting rain here in Monterey. I can handle rain. Nat-Your a bloody Camalot fan arn't you? My fave character is Merlin. Something about Druids... I read in a recent Newsmax on why Davis lost the recall election. Guess where part of the blame went. Clinton(theres a big surprise). Davis was using Clinton as his adviser during the recall. The article also pointed out how someone else used Clintons help and lost. Then it ended with just look what happened to Gore!It was heart warming and gives me hope in case Hillary runs( God help us all). Everyone have a great day! Until tomorrow! Slan leat!

 Hi Gals, I hope the east-coasters are doing ok with all that snow. I actually wouldn't mind a good storm if I didn't have 47 things to do at once.... 'Tis the season and all that crap.....I really enjoy Christmas, but really hate people :-P Retail will do that to a person...We have been bearing down the last couple of weeks, besides, I took on an extra night at the hospital, I'm either really poor, or really insane...it's a toss up. Because of the above paragraph, I have been unintentionally absent from my blogging duties, I heartily apologize, but I also see that aside from a few glimpses, I haven't missed too many sightings...I'm feeling bad because I don't really have time for Sheppo either..... I did have a fun day today, (I'm not always a Scrooge), my mom, sister, friend and I went to St Louis to see the play Thoroughly Modern Millie, we had seen it on Broadway when we went to NYC last year, and it was really good, we wanted my mom to see it. If anyone gets a chance, it is a great way to spend a few hours, very entertaining. The acting was just as good, and in some cases better, than the NY show. Sherry, you might check it out if you have time while on vacation. I DID catch Greg K on today talking about the murdered prosecutor....he looks cute in a tie, but I prefer the scruffy look of unbuttoned shirts and rumpled hair.... Just in case anyone is interested....I saw Love Actually the other evening (Colin Firth's new movie) and it was pretty good, I'd say Colin Firth's story was very good (of course), but honestly the best story line belonged to Hugh Grant, he plays Britain's Prime Minister. The premise is of about 10 different but loosely connected couples, and the various aspects of love...I wasn't too fond of the "porn couple stand in" story line, but I could be considered a bit prudish, there were a few other stories that didn't really do it for me, but the ones mentioned above, plus Liam Neeson's story and Emma Thompson's story were the best, also the aging rocker (Bill Nighy) who is trying to stage a comeback with a revamped Christmas song is pretty funny, all in all, I'd give it 3 1/2 out of five. Hope all is well and shoveled out, or at least snuggled under a blanket with a loved one..... I hope to check in again soon, but if I don't, please don't send the "Dog" after me, I'm ankle deep in rings or drugs....(and not in a good way!)

 Rick Alert! Rick was on from Jerusalem a few minutes ago and wearing a leather jacket. He reported on various events involving Israel and could be on again today. Jeff Goldblatt (minus the knit cap) was also on Fox & Friends this morning. I don't think that any other hotties have been on today, but Greg K. could show up later. Where in the world are Adam, Todd and Dan?

 Hello Levengals!! Well it is a winter wonder land here in Maryland. We got about 6 inches at my house this morning but it is snowing again and we are expecting another 6-10 inches tonight. Got my butt out there this mornign and shoveled what was already there so tomorrow I won't have as much to do. Hubby has to work tonight and he will probably get stuck at work and I'll have to shovel tomorrow. I need the exercise and that is good exercise. Then I can come in and drink hot chocolate and take a warm bath. Jayel - I saw Jeff today and he is too adorable. He looks like he needs us Levengals to come up there and warm him up. Missed Greg on The Big Story but maybe he will be on H&C or Greta tonight. He seems to work more at night sometimes. Nan - You give Adam back now. LOL. Just kidding!! I miss seeing his happy face on my TV. Glad you had a good time in Vegas. I went about 6 years ago and want to go back sometime. Happy Belated Birthday. Still have a ways to go on my weight loss goal. I wish it came off as quick as it came on. Teri - I hope you are feeling better for your concert. Hang in there. Nat - Have fun at the dinner dance part you are going too. I will take some pictures at the Fox Studios (at least of me outside) and I will post them so everyone can see. Hopefully I'll get lucky and maybe see one person. It looks like this weather will be all cleared out by then so that is good news. I hope all is well with all the missing Levengals.

 Greg Alert! Greg just appeared on Big Story with John Gibson and was reporting on the prosecutor murder case. Like Jeff earlier, Greg looked cold and was wearing a black coat, opened to show its blue lining, over his suit and tie. Greg looked good as usual, but I wish that he had been dressed in casual gear (knit cap optional) like Jeff. The prosecutor murder could turn out to be a big case and something a little different from what we usually see Greg report on. Natalie - I agree with you that the story that Jeff is covering doesn't look good for the poor missing girl. This case has the potential for the media to turn it into the successor to Laci Peterson. Since crime stories are all the rage among the news channels, I think that we're going to have to blame Ray Kelly (Lol!) for the lack of stories in NYC for Rick to cover. I read a report recently about how crime continues to be down in NYC, and a poll revealed that Commissioner Kelly had the highest approval rating (69%) of any official in NYC.

 Hey gals! I was starting to wonder where everyone was! Although there are still quite a few still missing.....where are ya'll? I hope the missing gals are doing great and are only missing due to hectic holiday preparations.....check in soon - we miss ya'll! I am completely utterly uninspired and unmotivated here at work today. Must be the cloudy weather & the fact that it's Friday, LOL! Hehehe- actually, I'm *very* caught up (comparatively)- the most I've been since over a year ago. It's nice, but I'm also wise enough to know that it's only a temporary state. I'm just soaking it in for all it's worth right now. No better day to feel that way than on a Friday! ;-) Ya'll are welcome for the link to the "Thanks" thing- I just did a Rick search in the Fox site & that came up. I got to see Todd on FR last night- got home in the nick of time- about 10 min. before he came on with his story. I can't believe (well, ok, maybe I *can*) that the UN wants some control over the internet. How lame is that. Teri- I hope you're feeling better!! Did you try zinc tablets? LOL, you know, after I fell, one of the first things I said (once I could breathe again) was, "Dang- my grandma does stuff like this- I'm not supposed to!". I'm tellin' ya though- I'm a lot more wary about going down stairs now than I used to be. It's almost like I'm afraid of falling- even when there's plenty of light. Today's much better though- a little quicker. Merlin was great- I bought the books too, lol! ah- Thanks for the Rick report! :-) Jayel- Thanks to you too for the Rick alert! :-) I haven't set my VCR since I've been back- may start again next week. I was wondering if Rick would end up in Iraq too....guess we'll have to wait & see. It's nice to see more of Jeff Goldblatt, even though that story is soooo sad. I hate to think & say it, but it's not looking good. Poor girl. I saw him in the knit cap this morning too and thought the same thing- not very flattering, but somewhat better on him than others. Sherry- How exciting to be going to NYC! How cool would that be to see one of the FNC people when you went by the studio? So that's less than a week away, then- I'll bet you can't wait. Nan- Happy belated birthday!! We need to get a birthday page or something so we can all know when to send b-day greetings. I'm horrible at times with trying to remember who's is when- and that's just with my family, LOL. I invariably end up missing one or two during the year. I'm about done with shopping- there's a couple of things that I decided my sister could use & then we need to get something for Kevin's sons and his parents. That's the toughie- we're thinking a Safeway/Randall's giftcard since she has everything under the sun anyway. Not very exciting, but useful. Know what ya'll mean about the libs & Bush- never seems to matter. And YET, they always say *we're* worse when it comes to playing the blame game. HUH? Did I miss something? Did ya'll catch H & C last night with the people that put out that lame calendar of bimbos (oops! I *meant* women) against Bush? I was so irritated and yelled at the TV, Kevin just laughed- he said they just proved how ignorant they are. True....but still. We could do very well without these kind of people. Ankle's doing better- still a little sore, but not anywhere like it was. Kaiser (for those who don't know who Kaiser is, it's one of our main HMOs here in CA) said that it could be 4-6 weeks before it's completely healed. Well, I ended up deciding to go to the "dinner dance" holiday party at work this year after all- it's tomorrow. They had it at the Ritz Carlton the last few years, but this year they're having it at the SFMOMA (San Fran. Museum of Modern Art), which I'm not crazy about because I really don't get into modern art. Samantha was so sweet- she brought in shoes & a wrap for me since I didn't really have anything to wear (last year's & prior year's stuff is too small now....maybe next year!), and she helped me come up with some ideas. I'll take a pic & put it up on my msn groups page so ya'll can see if you want. I haven't been wearing any makeup due to the whole contacts thing, so it's been awhile. Hopefully I won't look like a pre-teen trying on mom's makeup, LOL!! ;-p

 Hey LevenGals! Had a great vacation last week. Las Vegas was fun, didn't win, but didn't lose either. Saw a couple of shows, one really good and one just ok. All in all it was a very relaxing time. Spent most of one day in the spa at the Paris. Worked out, had a massage, relaxed in the jacuzzi and steam room. Just love being pampered in luxury. We even did a lot of our Christmas shopping on the way home. Had a good Thanksgiving (and birthday) with family over the weekend. Kim put up the Christmas lights on the house and I decorated the house and tree. Hoping to finish the shopping this weekend, but I'm sure that's wishful thinking. Sherry - Regarding your question if I have possession of Adam, I refuse to answer on the grounds it might incriminate me. LOL He does seem to have gone missing - as have a lot of the other foxy hotties. Congrats on the continued weight loss. How close are you to your goal. Keep us posted. If you get any pictures of our foxy guys while visiting NYC, be sure to post them so we can all share the wealth. Teri - Glad you're still alive! Hope your voice is better by Sunday. Good luck with your Christmas Choir. I too thought it was great that President Bush went to see the troops on Thanksgiving. No matter what he does, the ultra-liberals will complain. They're just jealous that the troops were actually glad to see him, unlike when President Clinton would visit them. Nat - That was fun to read the things the Fox group were thankful for. Glad you had such a great time on your vacation, too bad about your ankle. Hope it's healing up quickly. That is so sweet about the memory album your mom did for you. I know what you mean about how difficult it is sometimes to convey how much something means. Especially to someone with whom the relationship is strained at times. Jayel - Can't believe I've missed Rick the few times he's been on the last few months. Now the hubby is home, my Fox viewing is restricted to Studio B and Fox Report. I did catch Hottie Toddie though last night. Jen - Your audio post was so cool. Hope your recovery continues to go well. We'll chat on AIM soon I'm sure. Ellen, Jan, Leslie and all the other missing LevenGals, hope all is well and check in and let us know how you're doing.

 Hi LevenGals! Have you all seen Jeff Goldblatt in his knit cap today? Knit caps aren't very flattering, but I think that he's cute as can be in his. (I keep waiting for Geraldo and Rita to come running in to snatch Jeff's story away from him.) Has our Rick fallen into the mysterious abyss that the Fox hotties are prone to disappearing into? He must have company there given that so many of our hotties are missing. Natalie - It was interesting to read what some of the Fox people had to say about being grateful. Thanks for bringing it to our attention. Sherry - Lucky you to be going to NYC. I hope that you get to go by the Fox studios and peek in while Fox & Friends is on. Ever think about making a sign for the Fox hotties and holding it up in the window? You girls in the area for the snowstorm that's developing, take care.

 Thanks for sharing the link Nat. That was nice to read what everyone was thankful for.

 Hello everyone! I'm still alive. My voice is slowing coming back, which is good. Our choir Christmas thing is sunday and I'm one of two sopranos.I can hear me squeek now!LOL! Nat- your site is on my groups column. I posted a message on your site! My husband left today for out of town...again. This job is a pain in my butt. It seems like he's gone alot at times. Oh well, at least he doesn't have to commute to work like when we were back east. That sucked! I get the car more now!HaHa. Well everyone take care!

 Hey Grrrls!! I don't know if you've come across this on the Fox site, but thought I'd share. urlLink Giving Thanks . Adam's and Rick's thanks were cute and funny. Haven't had a chance to check out all of them, I just skimmed through. I'll have to write more later- but wanted to share the above.

 Hello Levengals!!! Okay whoever has my Adam needs to return him right now. I haven't seen him in awhile. I haven't seen where anyone else has mentioned seeing him either. At least I have got to see Rick and Jeff. That will hold me over until Adam returns. Nan - Do you have Adam?? LMAO!!! Jayel - Thanks for the hottie alerts. I saw Jeff today. It looked really cold there. Teri - I hope you are feeling better. I also agree that it was great to see our President visit the troops. You could tell how excited they all were for him to be there. Nat - Welcome back. How is the ankle?? Okay ladies guess where I'm going on the 11th-14th. New York City. I'm so excited. We are staying in New Jersey but our hotel has a shuttle that takes us to time square. It was about $100 a night cheaper to stay there then to stay in the city. I"m going to go by the Fox studio and at least take some pictures of me there. I might try to go on Saturday while Fox and Friends is on and maybe I can look in the window. I know in the summer they do a lot outside but I guess they won't be doing that in December. Maybe I'll see someone coming and going. Well gotta go. Talk to you ladies later.

 Another hottie showed up, LevenGals. Jeff Goldblatt was on reporting on the disappearance of Dru Sjodin. Jeff was outdoors and wearing a dark green jacket. If he continues to cover this story, we should see more of Jeff.

 Hi guys! Rick L. appeared just a little while ago from Jerusalem, Bridget Quinn asked him some questions. No Greg K sightings. Rick L. and Greg K. both possibly heading back to Iraq?

 Rick Alert! Rick was just on. He's still in Israel, but wasn't reporting on anything happening there. Instead, he was part of a discussion involving the recent action in Samarra. Greg K. and Oliver North are frequently asked to comment on the situation in Iraq, but Rick is never asked about Iraq, so it was nice to see him giving his viewpoint. Could this be a hint that Rick may be going back to Iraq? I guess that we'll just have to wait and see about that. Rick was wearing a blue shirt, which is a good color for him. (Okay, now where are all of the other hotties? We LevenGals are a greedy bunch. One hottie is never enough!) Greg Palkott has also been on Fox & Friends this morning reporting from Iraq and looking better than I've ever seen him. His hair is combed down over his forehead in a kind of gladiator style and he was smiling broadly. No Valium today for Greg P. Lol!

 Rick L. alert, still in Jerusalem. He was on with David Asman. A beige colored polo.

 I'm still sick as a dog (speaking of dogs, one tried to attack me on my walk here-never mess with me when I'm sick! I do not control my Hungarian temper very well!LOL!-I stopped looked the mutt in the eye and yelled(in my squeeky voice) SIT! He didn't know what to do. I kept walking). Anyway, I'm a dedicated Levengal so here I am to post (after laeving my death bed!). How bout our Pres.! What a guy! To visit the troops on Thanksgiving in a war zone! That is a man who cares, I don't care what the f*cked-up liberals say! Nat- welcome back, twisted ankle and all! You remind me of me! A clutz!LOL! I do that on stairs all the time. I love Snow! It's a beautiful song. Oh get this MO. issue of Renissance Magazine. It's on the ladies of Camalot(I believe). It has some great pencil sketches in it. Well, let me close and drag my sick butt home and back to bed. I may watch Merlin again ( the movie with Sam Neil in it, he still looks good!). Slan leat (cough-cough)

 Hey Gals! Well, I'm back. Hope ya'll had a great Thanksgiving! :-) I have to say it's been a good, albeit surreal vacation- not at all how I thought it would be. It's really nice to be home, but can't help but feel a little depressed that it's over. It's always very hard for us to leave family, especially when we only go back once a year and we never know now how much longer our elderly relatives will be around. It's always really hard for me to leave, but after the first week back, it subsides. It was made especially harder this time due to things going on on my side of the family. Kevin had a cold before we left & I caught it on the first Tuesday after we left (which meant I had it for most of our time away- I'm at the tail end now). Fortunately it was a managable one, no bedrest needed. Just *a lot* of kleenex! ;-P A week ago Friday while we were at my in-laws, I was coming down the spiral staircase they have (aka "the death stairs"). I turned out the light upstairs and started down. tt was darker than usual, but as I was more than halfway down, I didn't bother going back up to turn on the light. So....when I was on the 2nd step from the bottom, I was *sure* I was at the bottom and.....hit air and then the floor. On my ankle. The very same one I sprained almost 20 years ago. I called out to Kevin & he had to carry me to the couch since I couldn't get up; it hurt soooo bad. If I hadn't have been able to bend my toes I would have been certain that my foot was broken. We iced it down immediately and I think that helped, although a week later it's still swollen, so I'll probably be making a trip to the Dr. tomorrow. The real thing though that was really surreal was about my sister which explains *A LOT* of what had been a mystery for some time. I can't really talk about it here, but if I'm able to ever get on AIM and see ya'll, I'll fill you in. I'm still reeling from it; I'd never in my wildest nightmares would think that this could happen. The good news is that she is doing better and that so far she is on the right path. Onto lighter subjects, we had a good Thanksgiving (despite everything going on), and I'm sure I gained 10 lbs from this vacation. I'm going to fiercely start and hold to my Weight Watchers diet starting now. It was warm in both places- 80's (which is warm considering it's Nov.). TX was nice (Leslie, I waved North to you!)- it was quiet and relaxing. We're starting to think more about what we'll need to do when we retire there. I caught Rick on Thursday morning, I believe. I was surprised to see him in Jerusalem again, especially during the holidays but world events don't recognize holidays and being with family. I got to see snippets of Fox here & there when we were at my dad's & then last week at my mom's. Well, my replies will probably pithy, but will try to check in more this week. Sherry- congrats on the weight loss!! :-) I usually use the Clairol Natural Instincts- the Nutmeg one is good for dark brown. That's normally my color of choice, and it only lasts for about 27 shampoos. Good luck on the exams! :-) Hehehe- funny you should mention work- I've been bad: I checked my work email from home tonight- I think I had 120 new emails- I got it down to 25. Not bad.... now I'll just have to keep my fingers crossed regarding my in box at work...ick. My mom made me two large "memory" albums- it completely blew my mind- I was very emotionally moved internally (I say internally as I didn't break down outwardly as I could have). I'm sure my facial expression showed the surprise and gratitude though, and I certainly told her how very much I appreciated it. Jen- Good Lord, girl- I hope you're doing OK now after that scare in the OR! I'll have to listen to your audiopost! How cool is that?! It sounds though, from Sherry's post that you had the surgery done; I hope you're on your way to a speedy recovery! Teri- Loreena M's Christmas one is really good. One of my favorites on there is "Snow". I'm gonna have to go to my site & see what the deal is....I'm a newbie to the MSN groups thing. I'll check it out & let you know. Yep- illegals are just that: ILLEGALS. Like *I* could get a license in another country? I think not. The line *has* definitely got to be drawn *somewhere* and these folks just don't get it. Frustrating, isn't it. Hope you're feeling better!! Jayel- Rick in MIAMI??? Wow, usually Orlando Salinas (sp?) covers that area. How surprising! I've heard the book "Arrogance" by Bernard Goldberg- I know they've had him on here & there on FNC, but I think our morning talk show folks had him on too. It definitely sounds interesting! Sounds like the Rick sightings on Weds. (26th) were good ones. I was at my mom's then and was *itching* to turn the channel to Fox (she had on a local news show). No Todd these last two weeks? Nan- LOL @ the Laurie Dhue background- I always tell Kevin his "girlfriend" is on- I kid him and tell him that I know he has a secret crush on her, LOL. MELISSA!! Yay! I'm so glad to see you posting! :-) We missed ya around here- don't be a stranger! OK- I need to get ready for bed....it really is nice to be home again, and my kitty is very happy to see us again. *sigh*- I guess the perfect song to summarize the way I feel is "Gold Dust" by Tori Amos. If anyone's heard it, you'll know what I mean. I just can't believe that 2 weeks have flown by this fast. I've experienced so much raw emotion in these past two weeks so forgive me if I sound a bit out of sorts at times. I'm sure I'll think of other things that happened during the vacation- I'll share as I remember. Hope ya'll are doing well - forgive me if I overlooked anyone.

 Hi, girls! Real life must be keeping all of us busy. Rick has been on this morning making more reports from Iraq. Has Fox put us on a diet of only one hottie? These are the cable news ratings for Monday, 1/26: O'Reilly: 2.1 Hannity & Colmes: 1.6 Brit: 1.1 Shep: 1.0 Greta: 1.0 Larry King: 1.3 Paula Zahn: 0.8 Aaron Brown: 0.7 Dennis Miller (CNBC) 0.6 MSNBC's highest rating: 0.4 for Hardball

 hi levengals! RICK IS ON... RICK IS IN IRAQ : )

 Rick Alert! Rick has a report coming up on Iraq.

 FOX HOTTIE ALERT!!! Rick was just on Greta and looking good. He was wearing a black leather jack. It is great to see him again. I don't think I have seen him since Christmas. I'll post more over the weekend.

 Whee! Rick's back! Rick was on Dayside, reporting from Baghdad. Rick was wearing several layers of clothes, including a black, leather jacket, so it must be cold there now. I don't know if this is his first appearance of the day, so I don't know if he'll be on again this afternoon. At least, we can look forward to seeing him again for a while. It doesn't look like we'll ever have a chance to see two or three hotties together over in Iraq. This would be a good chance for Fox to do this, since the hotties aren't involved in covering the politicians. I caught Jeff Goldblatt on today, reporting on training for the military. These are the only two hotties that I've spotted today, but possibly more will show up. Jan - I'm also sick of the boring politicians. Just think, we'll have to endure months more of this torture. If it wasn't the pols, it would be Michael Jackson, Scott Peterson and Kobe Bryant. Horrible! All horrible! Your skiing trip sounds like fun. I notice that Fox has a new female anchor - Martha something or other. She's blonde and very pretty, so Fox continues to add personalities to keep the men in the audience happy. What about us? There's nobody at Fox who seems to care about keeping women viewers happy. Complaining e-mails to Fox, anyone? All of you LevenGals, check in more often since Rick is now back on our TV screens.

 Hi Gals! Has anyone written to Rick L to see if he is ok??? I'm starting to worry, I haven't had a chance to watch Fox lately, but I also haven't noticed any posts that he has been spotted. What if he's working for that other (shhh) channel??? I surely hope not. I had one of the best weekends last weekend.....I went skiing for the first time and it was great. We had a group of five and started out with the lessons and before long we mastered the bunny hill, so we got cocky and upgraded to the lift pass and all wiped out on the intermediate hill. IT WAS GREAT!!! I can't wait to go again, I want to BEAT that hill. I am so sick of the politicians already, only what......17 more months of this??? It sure feels like it. Being that we neighbor Iowa, all our local news is of the primaries also...is there no escape???? Why don't they 'embed' some of the more interesting reporters? At least then, I'd watch some of it. I'm also sick of Michael Jackson, Martha Stewert, Kobe Bryant and Scott Petersen.....can't they find other stories??? My workload in both jobs has slowed to a better controlled chaos, at least there's that....It's starting to stay light later, and I feel like I'm waking up again....that Christmas season gets longer and harder every year..... That questionaire was fun, if anyone didn't get one and wants me to forward it to them, just email me at Jlrymedic15@msn.com - it's not an intrusive interview, just a fun way to get to know people better.......

 Hello everyone! I'm still alive.I've been fairly buisy so haven't logged on alot. So how is everyone? Still alive?LOL! Have a great day all!

 Hey guys! Greg alert - he was on just a few seconds ago. He's been on quite a few times today. Looks like he's in a jolly mood today, smiling frequently. Did anyone watch Greg's other report about the marines in Djibouti yesterday? I guess he taped a few reports when he was there.

 a h - I saw Greg. Usually, I miss all of the unexpected good stuff on Fox Report. It was a short segment, filmed in Djibouti. It would have been nice to have had some full length shots of Greg in his wet suit, but they didn't show this, other than when he was underwater. Greg's wet suit was black and a faded shade of red. Not very eye-catching. Fox obviously doesn't know how to dress our guys. Lol! This is a dangerous area for Westerners, so I doubt that Fox would have chosen to go there just for a short feature on sharks, and it would also be a long way to go. Djibouti is Muslim and very close to Yemen and Somalia. My guess is that this may have been filmed while Greg was doing Reserve duty. Greg said that the type of sharks he was swimming with weren't dangerous, just big. As you all know, politicians are all over the TV screen, and our hotties have largely disappeared. I hope that this dismal situation isn't going to continue all the way until Election Day.

 Melissa:!!!!OMG I'm glad SWAT (minus Collin Ferrell, who I keep in a closet just for me) found you and I guess, apparently found me too - you know I was checking that blog we made when AIM was having a seizure and our last post was like 9/11 back in the days when I was fond of Greg Kelly -- you HAVE to check it!! I'm writing another post there tonight *just for you* so check it and get back to me! Someone else at Fox is hotter than Greg Kelly (at least to me, but that's only b/c he talks to me and Greg, to date, has not) anyway check out the blog girlie :-) and e-mail me back: GMUSportykellyfan@yahoo.com

 Hi guys! Apparently Fox Report had a segment with Greg K. in a wet suit and swimming with sharks! Anyone view this?!

 Hey gals! Just a quick post & then I have to finish packing for our trip- we're going to OR tomorrow for a week. I meant to do this earlier.....but as part of the saying goes- best laid plans of mice & men.... I hope ya'll have a great week & I'll catch up when we get back. Now just watch- Rick & Todd will turn up this week in abundance. If they do- enjoy for me! No FNC where we're going....there's cable, but alas, no FNC- just CNN. *blech* Have a great week everyone! :-)

 Hey Jen, SWAT found me!! :) Hey guys, I've been out and about, but not done a darn thing :( I've been having computer problems with the internet not working on both computers :( And my dad likes to be online as much as I do, so it doesn't work out very well. And now I'm having problems w/ my website...some stupid "Internal 500 Error" *shrugs* I'm waiting for tech support to get back to me... I hope you all in the NE are staying warm! Maybe I'm actually happy that my K.C. Cheifs don't have to play up there....but really I'm so sad that they lost last weekend....we were SOOOOO close!!! :( I'll be back soon. I know I always say that, but I'm bound and determined to figure out what's wrong w/ this stupid interent if it's the last thing I do! Hehe!! Talk to ya later!! :)

 Hey guys So it's been like a month in between posts for me - you know I went and typed in the site on my computer and it had been so long that I couldn't type in the usual short-hand way when I would post every 2 1/2 hours - lol I miss everyone on the blog, I was kinda speed reading through it and saw Jan's name - Jan I miss you! I must e-mail you, I've been bad w/ the e-mails to some of you guys -- anyone sent out SWAT for Melissa yet?! You know living around D.C. in the No. Va area and now close to the Pentagon you guys would *think* I'd be excited b/c I could run into that much talked about reporter Greg Kelly but I'm not, no you guys have "missed the boat" so to speak on the *real* D.C. based Fox hottie! He's cute and he's chatty (soo oo chatty) he's gone up to no. 1 *past* Collin Ferrell on my personal list of 'hottie's' LOL, as some one told me "cuteness is 90% Personality" and this has personality written all over him ... He's -- well the only guy at Fox that has made me say 'Greg? Greg who?' ;-)

 Good Evening Everyone!!! Can it get any colder. I don't think so. I'm so sick of the cold. Okay enough complaining. I just saw Adam on The Fox Report so that made me feel much better. I haven't seen him in like two weeks so was happy when he popped up. Ellen - I missed Rick yesterday. I would have loved to seen him in his ear muffs. Well it is still cole here on the east coast so maybe he will show up again soon. Jayel - I saw Greg yesterday morning also. He must have been on a little vacation. He seems to appear mostly on the weekends so he will probably be on a bunch the next couple of days. Well gotta go. Hope to hear from the rest of the Levengals soon or I might have to call "The Dog" up to find you all.

 Ellen - Aw, I missed seeing Rick reporting on the weather. It's still very cold in NYC today, so why couldn't we have had another report? I'll settle for Rick as weatherman if that's the only way that we can see him more often. Yep, Todd would've looked good in desert camo. With so much of the news now focused on politics, I'm afraid that our favorites aren't going to be seen much since the political scene isn't what they usually report on, although Greg K. does occasionally. Adam was on today reporting on the Mars Rover. This isn't a particularly logical assignment for Adam, but Ca. news must have been slow. a h - Sorry that you missed seeing Greg, especially since I don't think that he's been on at all today. (Fox is back to tight rationing of the hotties.) Greg's hair has grown out to its normal length. I hope that he never goes back to the person who almost scalped him the last time that his hair was cut. We LevenGals must not tolerate bad hair stylists who attack our hotties!

 hi levengals, it was great to see rick back in nyc yesterday! he was reporting on the weather, with ear muffs on. what a cutie! now i'm hoping todd will pop up soon as he ranks right up there with rick in my hottie scope. i can just imagine what he would have looked like if he were one of the embedded journalist in iraq. with his casual dress code... and maybe goatee too. - sigh - i'm hoping this is a hottie thursday.

 Hi all! It's great that Greg is finally back! I didn't get to view it of course! Sherry, thanks! New Years Eve in NY was fabulous this year! Jayel, is Greg's hair short?

 Program Note: Victor Davis Hanson, author of "Mexifornia" is going to be a guest on "Lou Dobbs Tonight" on CNN. (Wish that he were appearing on Fox, but that's how it is.)

 Cable News Ratings for 1/12 (Monday): O'Reilly: 2.1 Shep: 1.6 Hannity & Colmes: 1.5 Greta: 1.1 Brit: 1.1 Larry King: 1.3 Aaron Brown: 0.7 Paula Zahn: 0.6 Hardball: 0.5 Joe Scarbrough: 0.4 (The two highest MSNBC ratings) Shep has been receiving higher ratings (in some cases, considerably higher) than Greta long enough that it can no longer be dismissed as a temporary blip. Greta signed a three year contract with Fox, and I think that she has roughly one year left on the contract. Until then, I don't know if we'll see any changes in Fox's programming to reflect Shep's ratings vs. Greta's ratings. As we have all seen, Fox is inexplicably slow to pick up on making the most of some of their personalities. Greg K. is back! He was on Fox&Friends this morning, reporting from Washington and looking "lovely" in a gray suit, light blue shirt and blue striped tie. I saw Todd once yesterday, but haven't spotted any of the other guys, including Rick. Why do the women reporters never seem to disappear like our hotties? Or maybe they do, and I just don't notice that they're gone. Lol! Sherry - It's great that you're continuing to lose weight. I can't imagine experiencing the degree of cold that you've been having in your area. How do you stand to go outside even for a short period of time? Actually, I'm one of those freaky people who enjoys bad weather -- cold, howling winds, thunder, heavy rain -- but not when it's TOO severe. I would love to have snow, but not if I had to drive in it. The rest of you LevenGals, check in so that we can know that you're still out there somewhere.

 Hey Levengals!!! Well I'm finally gettting around to posting. Things have been crazy around here. I'm sick with a cold right now and it has really got me down. My husband had it last week and now he was nice enough to give it to me. I have also been working at my temp job since the first of the year. I hate my boss but like the work. I just try to blow him off but he stresses me out. When he is not in the office things are great but as soon as he gets around I get all stressed out. Thank god it is only a temp job and I only have to stay there until April 30th. I'm already counting down the weeks. Only 16 more to go. Yeah!! Still been managing to diet and exercise. Lost another pound so I have lost 31.6 pounds. Teri - I feel your pain, my hot water heater busted last week and had to have that replaced. I swear it is always something when you have a house. Just when you think you have a little money then something breaks and it can never be like a $30 something it always has to be a $500 something. Especially right after Christmas. Jayel - I'm missing the hotties too. Don't even remember the last time I saw Adam, Greg K or Rick. I do see Jeff, Dan and Todd occasionally. I'm all for those hotties returning soon. Nat - Good luck with the dieting. Thanks for the congrats. You can get that 10 pounds off in no time. Your work sounds so crazy. My old work was like that and I'm so glad to be out of there. Hopefully they will get you a new desk soon. I missed Hottie Toddie on Saturday but I like when he wears that leather jacket. Are you the one that was watching Keen Eddie?? Well if so Bravo is going to show all the episodes starting next week even the 3 or 4 that didn't air. I wasn't sure if it was you or someone else. I saw a few of them but then they kept switching nights on me. Well if it wasn't you everyone else on the board will se it and they can watch. AH - I think Greg might have gotten a vacation. I guess we can allow that since he did have to work Thanksgiving and Christmas. LOL!! Glad you had a great New Years Eve in NY. Jan - Sorry things have been so crazy for you lately. Sounds like you had fun on New Year's Eve. Congrats on the new computer. I guess you are really zipping through the net now. Okay it is so cold on the east coast I just want to die. It was like 10 below on Saturday with the wind chill. Today it actually got in the 30's but tomorrow it is going to be like 22 but with the wind chill it is much colder than that. And I think we are getting snow. I have lived in Maryland all my life and I don't know how much longer I can stand the winters. I'm dreaming of the day that my hubby and I can move away. Well gotta go. Hope everyone is doing good.

 It has been dead. I haven't posted in a while and theres no big gap betwix posts! Well, death was bound to happen. It came as no great shock to us. Mr. Washing machine has kicked the bucket! So tonight we go machine hunting.So much for paying the bills off,we'll need to card this purchase.Isn't life grand!LOL! Everyone take care! Teri

 Hi, girls! It looks as if we need to start nagging Fox again about the shortage of hotties. There's no shortage of women on Fox, though, and I can't decide if there's a male exec behind this or if a feminazi exec is running wild. Either way, it sucks. Natalie - I didn't see Todd on Saturday, but I'm picturing the red shirt and leather jacket. Adam and Jeff show up occasionally, but it seems like forever since we've seen Rick or Greg K. Greg may have been on vacation, and he certainly deserves time off, but doesn't it seem like the Fox personalities get summer vacations, winter vacations, spring vacations and fall vacations? It's a tough life. Lol! I won't get Michael Savage's book from Amazon until early in Feb., as another book included in the order won't be available until then. If you finish reading it before I do, tell us what you think of it. Savage has been on fire about immigation lately, and his radio show is worth a listen for those who have a chance to hear him. I'm about 3/4 through "Mexifornia." This is a book that everyone should read. It's not just for Californians. Here are a few quotes from the book: "And if you become puzzled later over how to deal with the consequent problems of assimilation, you will also look to California and follow what we have done, slowing walking the path that leads to Mexisota, Utexico, Mexizona or even Mexichusetts -- a place that is not quite Mexico and not quite America either." (Referring to the matter of driver's licenses for illegal aliens) "But if no such documentation (birth certificate) is required of aliens, will we then allow *all* Californians to obtain licenses, the foundation of our security and identification, without proof of their birth and age? Or shall we insist on birth certificates only for legal California residents, and not for illegal aliens?" "As a Mexican friend admitted to me in a moment of candor, 'If you let us make California into Mexico, we will just go to Oregon. If we turn Oregon into Mexico, we'll stampede our way into Washington. If we turn Washington into Mexico, we'll sneak into Canada.'" I agree with you, Natalie, about the 2004 election. I've soured on Bush due to his immigration stance, but the Democrats are even worse. Judging from a portion of the Democrat debate that I heard, the Dems are in a race with each other to see who can give away the country first. I really don't know what American citizens are going to do when everyone running for office is willing to destroy America in order to get elected. What goes on in your office, Natalie, sounds almost like a sitcom, except that I'm sure that it isn't funny to you. Bill O'Reilly will be discussing the Bush-Vicente Fox meeting on tonight's show and I think that Fox Report will also be discussing the meeting. If you all have any comments on immigration, this will provide an opportunity to send Fox your thoughts Here's hoping that our hotties return sometime this week, so that the LevenGals will have something to be upbeat about.

 Hey Gals! Wow, it's been so *quiet* around here! :-( I haven't been doing much except working and trying to get things cleaned up at home. Some more work excitement but not the kind I like- to say the least. Let's just say it's *BAD* and involves an adult that was having sex with a minor AND the adult is HIV+. And I *work* with this adult individual. AND they put where he works (i.e., our company name) in the paper.....AND mgmt is choosing not to discuss it with all of us here....this place is twisted- all of it- where I work, CA.....I'm ready to head east. Not that it's any better (you know, the old "grass is always greener" thing), but I've just had it with CA. Anyway.....oh yeah, and someone took some dried mini roses (yellow) that I've had in a vase on my desk for the last year- they were from my hubby for my b-day in 2002. The only way I knew what happened, is that my computer speaker was turned sideways & in front of my monitor instead of its usual spot. Naturally my eyes were led behind there to see what was missing, and sure enough, some idiot took my roses and left the vase. My suprvsr thought it was the cleaning people, that they thought they were to be thrown out. Uh, HELLO, they were practically *behind* my monitor, AND they didn't look like dead plant leaves (which I *did* have on another part of my desk, but they didn't do anything with those....). I'd say it was yet *another* twisted individual here, or someone did it out of spite. I've since become quite demanding to move to another desk. They're working on it. :-) Onto much more pleasant news..... Rick's been absent, but Hot Toddie was on Saturday's FR- he looks *so good* in the red shirts & leather jacket! ;-) It was great to see Rick in the "skanky boonie hat" again. Wow, that's great stuff! Niall (my stepson) proposed to his girlfriend & she said yes- we figured she would. They're going to wait until Niall's done with school before they get married (to our relief!). The WW diet is back on- although I still have one leg on & one off the wagon. I have 10 lbs to lose. Here's a humorous pointer for you other gals in the struggle for weight loss: *never* weigh yourself with the scale on a rug. It *will* add at least 15 lbs. to your weight. ;-p I tell ya'll, I nearly fainted when I saw the initial number. I'm sure a bloodcurdling scream of "NO!" made it to the east coast. Then I tried the hardwood floor- *WHEW*. :-) So, yeah, I have 10 to lose, so not bad, considering what I've eaten in the last year. I've kinda half-assed my WW diet the last year, so I'm considering myself lucky. I bought Savage's new book, but haven't read it yet. I also got the "Mexifornia, A State of Becoming"- I believe it's by Victor Davis Hansen (I always seem to mess up one part of his name, and I'm too tired & lazy this AM to look it up :-/ ). Haven't started that one yet either. I figured it was good time to start, with all the talk of Bush's referendum that he wants to pass to let even *MORE* illegals into the country AND legalize the ones that are already here. At this point, he's lost our vote for 2004. I feel betrayed by this- this isn't what a conservative president is supposed to do, but then again, Bush is a little left of conservative. Sherry- congrats on the wt. loss & for keeping up so well!! :-D Nan- had to laugh at the "hubba hubba" when you were talking about Rick. :-D LOL, it's exactly the same thing I think when I see Rick or Todd on. Especially after *such* a long absence. Where *is* that boy??? Isn't it funny, that when you see one of your favorite hotties on, that you forget what they were reporting on? Glad I'm not the only one that has that problem occasionally! "....cute smiling face sucked all rational thoughts from my brain..."- Yep- that's the feeling! :-D Melissa- Congrats on the new computer! Don't be a stranger (that goes for all you other missing LevenGals as well!) ;-) Janice- I caught Todd on New Year's Eve morning, but wished I'd taped that day. It sounded like there was a humorous exchange about the "naked cowboy" and then the anchor (Mike Jerrick maybe??) suggested that they should have a "naked reporter"- it sounds like Todd got a little embarassed, heheheh. LOL- I think you're right- I think Todd is not fond of ties- I don't remember the last time I saw him wearing one. I think for some guys, ties are to them what pantyhose is to women (or at least me! LOL!). I agree- "Bad Santa" needs to bring our hotties back. I've sent emails to shows but haven't gotten a reply. I've only sent about three though, LOL! Teri- got your letter on Friday! Will try to reply before we go to OR. I think I kept getting that error message too with blogger on NYE, and maybe NY Day? Jan- hope things are slowing down a bit for ya- I see that you had the dual post-Christmas jewelry adjustments & flu season strike at the same time- ick. I was thinking the same thing about Rick being in Jerusalem on Christmas Eve. Well, this post was scattered at best. I wanted to get in this week as we will be going up to OR this weekend for a week. I apologize if I missed anyone's posts! Gotta get to work- talk to ya later! :-)

 Hi all! Yes, where in the world is Greg K. and Rick L.?! Greg K. hasn't been on for quite a long time. Any guesses? There's a new newswoman on fox named Martha something. Not sure about her though.

 Hi everyone! I hope all is well in Levengal world!Now that the holidays are over we can all get back to *normal*! I saw the Savage book at the bookstore. I've never read him and only listened to a few of his radio shows when we treked from MD to CA..Is it any good? Well, you all have a good day! Slan leat!

 Hey, girls! Jeff and Adam showed up today, but where are Rick, Greg K. and the rest of our favorites? I prefer Jeff wet and windblown, but it was still nice to see him. Eric Shawn has apparently been trying to fill in the hottie gap, but, um, it's not exactly working. Do any of you ever e-mail any of the Fox shows commenting on the issues covered? Today, I e-mailed "Dayside" commenting on the guest appearance of my hero, Rep. Tom Tancredo. Unexpectedly, I received a response (standard, I'm sure) graciously thanking me for watching the show. The only other Fox show that I've ever received a response from was Studio B, but that response was snarky, so I'll not be e-mailing them again. Has anyone e-mailed any of our hotties lately? I e-mailed Rick several weeks ago, but received no acknowledgement and e-mailed Dana Lewis just to thank him as one of the reporters spending Christmas in Iraq. No response from him either, so responses from Fox personalities are evidently quite unpredictable. Natalie - I taped Fox&Friends and saw Michael Savage on there. It would have been nice if he'd been given more time to cover some of points in his new book "The Enemy Within." I've ordered the book. I wish that Fox had someone who was covering the immigration issue and the outsourcing of American jobs the way that Lou Dobbs is doing on CNN. His show is the only one that I watch on CNN, but he's absolutely great in the way that he doesn't mince words in reporting on these issues. Occasionally, I catch a glimpse of Bill Hemmer, but I think that he's usually on opposite Fox&Friends, so I've seen him only enough to know that he is a cutie. Think that we could persuade Fox to trade Geraldo for him? Lol!

 Just a quick post to tag onto Jayel's post- Michael Savage is also supposed to be on Fox & Friends tomorrow too. Gives me a good reason to tell hubby why I'm taping, LOL! "Oh, I taped it so you could see it too!" (It'll work- he would want to see the part that Savage is on....) Now I just have to hope that ONE of the hotties shows up on F&F tomorrow AM....... More later- uh......Jen- I think it's time to send the SWAT in to rescue my work hostaged butt! ;-P

 Hi, ladies! I think that "Bad Santa" must have taken all of our hotties and left female Fox reporters under our Christmas tree! Jan - Congrats on the new computer. Program Note: Michael Savage is scheduled to be on with Bill O'Reilly tonight. It could be interesting.

 Hi Gals, I'm sorry to have been absent for so long, but my Christmas isn't over just yet...it seems just about everyone buys jewelry for gifts and then bring it back to be altered---sized, shortened, soldered together, etc. We have been averaging about 60-70 jobs a day and my fingers are literally bloody. The hospital has been unusually busy too, I just can't catch a break......such is life I did get to spend New Year's Eve at my parents cabin with a few friends, a dvd player, a stack of movies and a ton of food...it was a great getaway. Our weather lately has been nuts...it was 61 degrees on Friday and tonight the wind chill is supposed to hit 17 below. I got to see Rick in Bethlehem on Christmas Eve, that would be a neat place to see, (even better with him there) but too scary right now....I like Fox's mentality...send a Jewish guy to cover the Christian's biggest night ;-) I must have been really good this year, I got a new computer, guess what brand DUDE...It's great, it is so much better than my old 8 year old one. I wish you all a happy and prosperous new year, and I hope to be back to a regular schedule here shortly....

 Hi guys! New Year's Eve in New York was fabulous! No Rick L. or Greg K. sightings so far...

 Hi everyone and happy new year! I tried to post Wed. but the computer kept saying "can't find site",whatever! I was watching Mad TV last night and they did a thing on Bill O'Reilly.It was on hollywood. It was soooo funny and they made bill and fox look good and hollywood look...well...liberal.I was impressed. I hope everyone's new year was, is, and will be great! Till next time... Slan leat!

 Hottie Alert! Todd and Adam have been on this morning. Todd was reporting on Homeland Security and Adam was reporting on a hiring controversy. Both were in studio. Todd was dressed just a bit more formally than is usual for him, but still no tie. (This man must absolutely hate ties.) I missed most of Adam's report, but he was looking happy and smiling in what I did see.

 hi everyone! nan, that's great that you got to meet s. hannity! how did he look? was he friendly? jayel, it was nice to see greg k. outside for a change. he looks great without the tie. sherry, greg k. reported on 3 different stories on friday, quite the busy man. nat, you will do better on the next exam! can't wait to view 'the passion'!

 Nan - It's so good to have you back and to hear encouraging news about your husband and father. How lucky can Sean Hannity get? Meeting a LevenGal in the flesh! Lol! I haven't read Sean's book, but I'm finally getting started on Michael Savage's book, "The Enemy Within." I think that all of the LevenGals would enjoy Savage's book and recommend it. Among other things, he explains what turned him from a liberal into a conservative. Girls, I think that Rick may now be gone from Iraq. I can't remember seeing him this past week. Todd Connor is looking dashing, but I still prefer him minus the facial fuzz. Greg K. was on today, standing outdoors in a light blue shirt with the top buttons undone. Yes, the chest hair is still there. Needless to say, Greg was hot! How about Steve Harrigan in Haiti! While he's no hottie, he certainly has plenty of guts to go into so many dangerous hotspots to cover a story. It was mentioned on Fox today that Steve is six feet, eight inches tall. Wow! Major Bob (can't spell the last name, but you all know the one) had some scary things to relate regarding Haitian violence. If Rick is out of Iraq, it should be another week or so before we see him again, so we'll have to console ourselves with the other hotties.

 Hi LevenGals!!! Sorry I've been MIA for so long. I do lurk and read the blog to keep up on everyone a couple times a week. Hubby's knee surgery (went well and he's fully recovered) But now work (tax season) is in full swing. Should get better in a few weeks. My son and I met Sean Hannity last night. We attended one of his book signing events. It was fun - he spoke first then signed books and then stood for pictures with those who wanted one. My dad is doing really well. He had surgery in January (another reason I've been MIA). They removed about 45% of his liver (the cancerous part). It only takes 2 months for the liver to regenerate. Amazing. Thanks to all for your prayers. They really helped and were answered. Sherry - Golfing! My husband recently started playing. Not sure I need something else in my life that will just cause me frustration. LOL Glad to hear the weather is getting better for you and you can finally get outside. Jayel - I saw Rick's report at the racetrack. I really liked his report from the Pepsi bottling place. I like how he reports on stories other than the bad stuff that happens in Iraq. Nat - Good luck on your upcoming test. I know you'll do great and pass with flying colors. San Francisco has lost all contact with the home planet. They seem to be using their gravity pull and gathering other loony cities to join them. LOL We shouldn't be surprised, how many laws have the voters of CA passed only to be set aside by a judge. This will probably be another one. Teri - Hope you're feeling better. Hubby and I are going to see "The Passion" next weekend. We decided to wait until the crowds die down a little. Jan - I love snow skiing - hope you had a good time. Gotta go - Hope to post again soon.

 Hey Levengals!!! Finally getting around to posting. I miss talking with everyone, it is just life has been so crazy lately with work and school. I haven't been feeling that great this week either. Got a sore throat so that usually means a cold is coming. UGH!!! I'm excited about the weekend because it is supposed to be almost 60 here in Maryland on Sunday and Monday. Yeah!! I can't wait for winter to be over. I might have to get the golf clubs out this weekend and go to the driving range for some practice. I will surely be rusty since I only got to play golf once last year since it rained for like 4 months straight. Hopefully this spring will be nicer. Well I don't know about anyone else but I'm sick of seeing Geraldo on my tv everytime I turn it on. I did see Todd today and he was looking great as always. Glad he is growing the goatee back. Jayel - I have hardly ever seen Rick since he went to Iraq. It is funny it always seems to be someone else when I'm watching. I have seen him once or twice though. Nat - Sorry about your test but at least it was practice. When do you take the real one?? I'm sure you posted the date but I'm way behind on all the post so I thought I would ask again. LOL!! I saw Todd yesterday and he was looking great no Rick though. I looked at your ebay item and there were no bids. I was almost sure you would bid on that item - NOT!! AH - I would like to see Greg go back to Iraq again. He just seems to fit there. I missed his report on the air marshals. I usually see him more because he is on the weekends. Jan - I saw him in the black sweater too and was thinking that he sure likes that sweater. I agree he would look great in blue or hunter green. Good luck on the sking and let us know how it was. I have been wanting to go but I'm a little scared I'll fall and break my leg or something. LOL!!! Teri - Hope you are feeling better but now I have your sore throat. I feel awful and I'm sure I will be getting a cold next. Well gotta go for now but will check in again over the weekend.!!

 Natalie - I'm glad to see that you're checking in, but it looks like some of the other LevenGals have dropped out of the blog. I'm not sure that there enough of us left to keep the blog going. Good luck on the real test of the agent/broker license. I've seen Rick and Todd this week, but I can't remember on what day. I can tell you that I've seen waaay too much of Geraldo. a h - I would think that Fox would have wanted Greg K., Rick and Oliver North to go back to Iraq to coincide with the anniversary of the war, but it looks as if they sent Rick back at the wrong time for that to work out. The usual length of an overseas assignment is two - six weeks, I believe. Rick has already been in Iraq for three or four weeks? Greg appears to me to be very happy with his D.C. assignment, so I don't know how he would feel about having to go back to Iraq. The temperatures right now in Iraq are about as comfortable as it gets there, but it won't be very long before the extreme heat sets in. Jan - Rick wasn't riding a horse. (At least, not on camera.) He was at the racetrack watching horse races and betting on the horses. I fully agree that Rick's wardrobe needs to be more colorful. If you missing LevenGals are still around, please let us know that you're there, even if you don't have time to contribute to the discussion until later.

 Hey gals! Wow, this is a record for me as of late! ;-p This makes FOUR posts in the last week, LOL! Anyway- on the practice agent/broker license exam, I...uh...FAILED. BUT at *least* that's the *practice* one and not the real deal. You can only miss 45/150 and I missed 59/150 ;-p The instructor was *really* good though and he gave us some more practice tests which will help a lot I think. I guess I didn't do too bad since I didn't study much (OK- not at *all*) really for it. I know what I need to look at now. Teri- Glad you're feeling better! :-) Yeah- I agree with you on CNN (Commie News Network as I've heard them called). I think people are making a big deal out of it *before* they even see it. We're *DEFINITELY* going to see it. I was very happy to learn (can't remember when- sometime in the last couple of years) that Mel Gibson was conservative- YAY! Has anyone seen Rick or Todd on there in the last couple of days??? They both seemed to have vanished from the radar- or I've just not been around at the right time & place to catch them. I *think* I last saw them on Monday, maybe? Jan- I agree- Rick needs to add more color to his repertoire- I'm all for hunter green! :-) Navy would be nice too- hard to go wrong with navy. Have a fun and SAFE time skiing! I tried it, but never graduated from the bunnyhill to the slopes... OK- need to get to work & play catch-up with all the stuff that's been backing up. Sot some done last night (Kevin had a union meeting so I stayed at work till around 8:30.....and here I am less than 11 hours later- sad, huh!). Later!

 hi guys! Greg K reported on air marshals today during studio b. On Geraldo, Greg said that he "might" be heading to Iraq, but I think he'll be staying stateside.

 Teri, I love how you transition from "commie pinko fags" to choir practice.....LOL Jayel, I'm sorry I missed Rick on horseback, did he look like he knew what he was doing? I did get to see him from Baghdad, wearing that black sweater, maybe we need to pool our resources and get him a new one in a different color....I'd like to see him in a hunter green, or a navy blue. It seems to me a lot of guys look good in blue. Natalie, good luck on the broker/agent training.....I bet you ace the test! Wish me luck----I'm going skiing again this weekend, if any of you have never tried it.....it is so fun!

 Hey gals! Just a quick post before I go to the last day of the broker/agent training.....ROFLMAO- look what I found on Ebay: urlLink press pass on Ebay Anyway.....too bad it's not Rick's! :-p OK- gotta go- where's the rest of you gals??

 Hi everyone! I'm glad blogger finally put up all the posts. The last time I checked it was still on 2 sundays ago...I do like this new format though. Nat- I'm felling better although my throat is still sore.I'll live I think!LOL! Savage is ok. I don't listen to him every night because night time I like to listen to my music and cool out. Plus the station is in San Diego so it doesn't stay steady,it fades in and out...very annoying! Jayel-I forgot what Greg was talking about. I was so happy to hear a Fox correspondant, he could have been talking trash and I wouldn't have known nor cared! Just say" this is ... reporting for Fox news".... I'm so pathetic. Jan- I'll take your Fox news! I was gagging thru Cnn as they trashed Mel Gibsons movie (commie pinko fags) by talking to a so called "religious expert" who wouldn't know a Bible if it hit him across his pea-little liberal head! Anyway... You all keep me up to date! Well, it's time for choir practice so good night all...

 Hey gals! We've been blessed with Rick & Todd's presences today! :-D Rick was on twice (I think) on Weekend Live & Todd nearly every hour on the hour after that. And yes, they *both* looked great- and it's nice to see Todd growing the goatee back. :-{)> I missed Special Report.....but I think I'm going to start taping it. I'm watching Geraldo's show right now and both Todd & Rick have made appearances- Rick in a pretaped segment....and IN JEANS! :-D Jayel- I agree with you about seeing our country crumbling before our eyes. I think you listen to Savage, right? I know Savage has likened current times to ancient Rome just before it fell....which really makes you think. He's quoted from one of the Roman philosopher something (I *wish* I could remember who & what.....) that you could really liken to the situation here today- it was actually a bit frightening. I agree with you - SF is only the beginning and we "ain't seen nuthin' yet". My hubby says that he tries not to think of it too much because he knows he could easily/quickly get depressed about it if he lets it get to him too much (did that make sense?). I, on the other hand probably let it get to me too much. We've (I've) emailed many powers that be, so I guess we're doing something, but when you don't see anything changing except for the worse, it's hard to believe that emailing or even voting helps. We just completed our absentee ballots for the March 2 primary & local bond measures.....I will probably always vote even though I'm not sure of the good it does. Hope everyone's doing well- hopefully tomorrow will be another Rick & Todd filled day! :-D

 Hey, girls! Did you all see Rick on Special Report? He was reporting on horse racing in Iraq. It was rather amusing. Rick lost! On a report from a while back, one of the Fox reporters mentioned that women are never seen at the race track. I have no idea why Muslim women are presumably forbidden to attend horse races. Natalie - The gay marriage thing is so depressing that I don't even want to get into it too much. I feel as though I'm watching my country crumble right before my eyes, and I wonder if the citizens of ancient Rome had the same feeling as the Roman Empire began to totter. Bill O'Reilly has called what's going on in San Francisco "anarchy," but I think that we "ain't seen nuthin' yet." Extremely discouraging.

 Jayel- You posted since I last refreshed the screen. :-) You made me smile with the Todd comments- yeah, I'm one of those who prefers the facial hair! :-D It would be *SO* good to see Rick & Todd report together- it'd be HEAVEN. Pure & simple. Hmmm...I didn't notice the mark on Geraldo's hands- LOL, I was too busy looking at Rick! ;-D Savage is really up in arms about the gay marriage issue- as many conservatives (and I've heard some liberals too) are in this area. I have to admit that some of the bloom is off the rose now when we go over the Golden Gate every morning. Instead of "City by the Bay" it's the "City of Gay Marriages". Bah humbug! LMAO about Kerry & a bloodhound! You know what's funny is that last week, Mancow likened Kerry to Hamilton's picture on the $20 bill. EDIT: uh....that should be *JACKSON* on the $20......I couldn't verify at the time *who* it was (& I couldn't remember) since I only had two bucks on me.....*turns red* sorry about that! I'd *definitely* say that Kerry's had botox. It was just so obvious to even me (who sometimes takes awhile to notice such things). OMG! I saw the little boy on Fox & Friends this morning too!! Was he just *so* ADORABLE or what??? I thought that was such a sweet/cute bit- and we could really use those right now to make us smile. So CUTE! Thx for the stats- it's a wonder that MSNBC is surviving when looking at those numbers- Fox News has them beat more than 3 times over. OK- I'm OUT

 Hey Gals! How's everyone doing?? Well I hope! Hopefully all of you sick LevenGals will be on your feet & feeling 100% better in no time. I'm so bummed that I missed Rick 'n' Todd on Weds- Todd growing the goatee back **melts** I've *got* to catch him this weekend- provided he's on. Then I have to hope that hubby will be working outside so I can have Fox on the whole live-long day! ;-) I was able to catch Rick this morning (around 5:00 PST) on Fox & Friends. Oh! They said this morning that ED had her baby this morning! :-) I have to tell ya'll that I *really really REALLY* do *not* like this whole gay marriage thing that's going on here. Patience has left the building (hmmm....as well as Schwartzenegger and Bush....both seemed 'concerned' by it... but NEITHER has done anything about it yet). I feel really let down by this fact & that things are changing beyond my control. I have emailed, and yada yada yada.....*sigh*. What gets me (and prolly you other CA gals- Nan & Teri)- is that IF this all goes through (i.e., SF wins the suit over CA and gay marriage DOES become legal), I'm sure they will find a way out of the marriage tax that we marrieds have to pay. We paid so much last year, and it's just not fair. Have you gals heard anyone (O'Reilly, Savage, Hannity, Rush, etc) bring up this point? 'Cause I haven't heard anything to date. ARGH!! I'm just *SO* ready to move out of here. It's like, if you don't like the law, just, oh, go ahead & change it- no one will care. Yeah, RIGHT. I mean, what other issues is this going to open up?? Right now I apologize to all of you non-CA gals for what CA (specifically San Francisco) is doing to the country. I'm not sorry I moved here, but I'm looking forward to getting out (in another 4 years & 10 months....). *stephs off soapbox* Anywho....OH! I almost forgot! I emailed Rick last Sunday regarding the big explosion at the Army Headquarters (recruiting center?) in Iraq the week before and he wrote back within a couple of hours. He's the best when it comes to writing back; I think it's so sweet. Like Janice said, he still doesn't use the shift key. The reply was short, but I know he's awfully busy reporting & staying safe there. It's been really nice to see him so much more- I think he's in his element there. Did ya'll happen to catch him on Geraldo's show last week (Sunday, I think?)- they actually interact pretty well- I guess I never noticed it before (but then again, I'm a slow notice-er sometimes....). Also, I think he's lost some weight since he's been there- his face looks leaner than it did a couple of months ago. Melissa!! Congrats on getting your computers networked! :-) THX for the videos!! You *go* girl!! :-) I'm going to check them out this weekend. Hey- what happenend to the www.rick-leventhal.com site? When I go there, it says "page not found"? Just curious! Jayel- Thanks for the well wishes with the agent/broker licensing stuff. It's gone well; I complete it next week & will hopefully take the test not too long after that (before I forget everything ;-p !) Thanks for letting us know what Rick said in his reply to you- I remember that report and I was just hopping mad when I heard him say that some of the people were laughing & dancing around. It just made me sick at heart. Those poor soldiers & their families......I can't even imagine. Sherry- WOW!!!! *CONGRATS* to you for the weight loss!! I'm now 15 lbs from my goal....but I'm getting better. LOL, I know I keep saying that....but geez- this 2nd time around has just been so hard to do compared to the initial weight loss. I kept it off for a year, but it's been creeping back since mid last year. Teri- I got your letter! I hope you're feeling better!! What do you think of Savage? Girl, you *must* be desperate if you're listening to Alan's show, LOL! J/K!!! :-) I'm glad you at least got to hear Greg. It was funny- we were on our way home and listening to the newsbreak before Savage Nation started. The station is primarily a conservative station- they have O'Reilly on there earlier in the day- but their news is done by CNN Radio news. Here's the kicker- they often use Fox News bits for their briefs and one day- it was Rick! I tell ya, it was hard to keep a straight face when I heard that voice, LOL!!! So now every day when we hear the news brief before Savage, I'm always thinking, "oh please, oh please, oh please...." LOL! Ellen- Thanks for the hottie alert! The funny thing was, I noticed that Rick's been on Special Report the last few days & thought that I should tape again.....should have listened to my intuition! :-p So it's true! Todd's growing the goatee back! YAY!! Hubba hubba! Rick will have some tough competition in that case! ;-) Let's hope that the Fox gods bless us with plenty of hottie sightings this weekend. Jan- Sorry to read that you were sick- hope all is better now and that you're surviving the lingering Valentines day mania. OK- gotta get back to work, but just wanted to pop in since it's been a little bit. Hope all of you missing gals are doing great! Where are you Nan, Leslie, Denise....& anyone else I've left out????

 Hi, girls! I wish that all of the LevenGals who haven't checked in lately would so do just so that we know that you're all still with us. It's great to have Melissa back. Jan - I hope that you will enjoy your visit to Dauphin Island. Winter in S. Alabama lasts about 36 hours all told (only a slight exaggeration), and winter is basically over by the middle of Feb. May is the last comfortable month here before summer arrives, and the heat and humidity feel like being wrapped in a thick blanket that's been drenched in hot water. On the other hand, for those who hate cold winters, the winters here are quite comfortable and pleasant with brief periods of chilly temperatures. Ellen - I'm happy to see that Todd is in Iraq, although I'm always concerned for all of the reporters in this very dangerous place. Todd is probably delighted that there's no chance that anyone at Fox will try to make him wear a suit and tie. Lol! I suspect that I'm in the minority in preferring Todd without facial hair, but he does look extremely good with or without. Wouldn't it be nice to see Rick and Todd making some reports together the way that Rick and Geraldo did? What is the mark that Geraldo has on one of his hands? Does anyone have any idea? Rick was on this morning and looking very good. Teri - Poor you! Still no Fox News on your cable system. Do you suppose that if you got up a petition to add Fox News that it would do any good? What did Greg K. talk about when he was on Alan Colmes' radio show? I didn't even know that Alan had a radio show. The only talk radio that I ever hear is Rush, Michael Savage and Michael Reagan, although more conservative talk shows may be available in my area. The John Kerry rumored affair is curious in its lack of coverage, but I suspect that most people just don't care. Clinton lowered the bar so much in regard to expectations of sexual morality among politicians that I doubt if people would much care if Kerry had a dozen such affairs. Am I the only one who thinks that Kerry bears some resemblence to a bloodhound? For those of you who missed Fox&Friends today, E.D. had her baby. It's a boy named Wolf. (No, not named for Wolf Blitzer according to E.D.) There was also an adorable 2 1/2 year old boy on F&F who watches Fox so much that he can identify photos of the Fox personalities, including my favorite Fox military guy, Col. Dave Hunt. The tot's mother said that he was learning to read by watching Fox News. Kiran Chitrey said that was how some of the Fox anchors had learned to read. Lol! A bit of ratings news: For 2004, Fox News is averaging 1.6 million viewers, CNN is averaging 927,000 viewers and MSNBC is averaging 373,000 viewers.

 Hi all, We had our first 50 plus degree day of the year today, and let me tell you it sure makes you feel reborn! There is hope for spring after all. I had the flu (the nasty kind) last week, and I'm really ticked because I suffered the shot so I wouldn't have to worship the toilet, if it hadn't been free, I would demand my money back! I'm pretty much back to my old self, for better or for worse, you decide...... I haven't had much time to watch Fox lately, and my other obsession is still with me (and easier to follow). I see Rick has been sighted from time to time, and I'm glad to know he is still with us. Valentine's weekend was nuts, we broke all kinds of sales records at the store, which means I've been pretty busy this past week sizing all the rings...I guess it's a good thing, kind of a job security, but I'd prefer it not so hectic..... So Todd and Rick in Baghdad together? Have you bought your ticket yet Ellen? I think you can get a good rate if you connect through Syria... :-P Jayel, in May I am headed down your way big time----VACAY on Dauphin Island, can't wait! We are headed down the 22-29, New Orleans first, then over to the quiet island with nothing to do.....aaahhhh, warm, relaxing, water, sand, sun...... Sherry- you are such a loser :-) Congrats!!! Teri-sorry you still can't get Fox, I'd loan you mine since it's been a while since I've had time to watch it... Melissa, glad to see you're back also..... Jen, sorry, my A-O-L went O-U-T....I had to log on to MSN to blog.....I hope you get to feeling better, and email whenever you want!!! Natalie, Nan, Denise, A H, Leslie, I hope you are all well, and looking forward to a great spring.....sorry if I missed anyone, it was not intentional....

 HOTTIE ALERT!! Todd Connor is in Baghdad..Rick was on all day yesterday, from Baghdad..so it looks like these two hotties might be there together. Looks like Todd is even growing back his goatee! Happy Dance around the TV as these two are my fav reporters from FOX News :)

 Hi all from the state of gay marriages! I found out I was able to get a talk radio station from San Diego!I live in Monterey. Anyway, I can hear Savage Nation and the Allen Combes show. On Allen on friday he had Greg Kelly on, plus Fox commercials! I cried(I miss fox).To all you newbies, Ft. Ord does not get FNC on it's suckassed cable system. But I do get two stations of CNN!Anyway... How about Kerry and the intern! Haven't seen much of that on the mainstream media, but Rush and Sean have been keeping me up to date.( thank the radio god for Talk Radio). I hope everyone has a great day and to quote Sean (and the book of John) Let not your hearts be troubled! Slan leat !

 Hey Levengals!! I know I have been missing in action for awhile but things have been crazy with work and school. I only have a few minutes now and wanted to post and let everyone know that things are going okay and I'm still alive here on the east coast. Just saw Rick on the Fox Report and I think this is only the 2nd time I've seen him since he went to Iraq. He was looking great as always. The diet is still going great. I have lost 41.6 pounds. Still trying to fit in my workouts at least 3 times a week but some weeks are too crazy or the weather doesn't cooperate. Well gotta go for now but will hopefully post more later. Hope all is well with all the Levengals I see the board has been very queit. I'll post more later.

 Happy Valentines Day Gals!!! I come bearing gifts!! :) Well, good news, I FINALLY got my comp and my dads comp networked, and now we share internet access 24/7. Also, I got a video capture thing for my computer, and I found one of my tapes of Fox News featuring the "Special Report" Brit Hume did w/ the embeds not too long after they got back. Plus the memorial day special they did "Eyewitness to War" featuring the embeds and their crew. And the report Rick did during Fleet Week. And I made videos for you all!!! I uploaded them in ZIP files, so you'll need WinZip ( urlLink you can get the free version here ), or some other sort of zip file extractor to get the files. Also, the videos are in WMV format, so you'll need a current edition of Windows Media Player to view them properly. I hope you all enjoy them!! Guess I need to start recording again so now I can share with anyone who missed it! :) urlLink Fleet Week Video (aprox. 4 MB and 3 min long) urlLink Special Report Video (aprox. 42 MB and 40 min long) urlLink Eyewitness to War Video (aprox 45 MB and 40 min long) I see it's been kinda dead lately. I hope everyone is doing good! :) I'll check in later.

 Ladies, I heard from Rick today. I e-mailed him concerning his report on a soldier being killed in an explosion and the reaction to the soldier's death from some of the Iraqi bystanders. I could tell when he made his first report that he was upset when he said that some of the Iraqis were laughing at the soldier being killed. When he made a subsequent report, he didn't mention the Iraqis laughing, so that's what I asked him about. When he responded he said that he was trying not to repeat himself and that he also "didn't want to give too much attention to a small group of despicable individuals who don't deserve the air time." I think that he was still upset, which is perfectly understandable. I was outraged at such callousness. To be fair to the Iraqis, Rick did say that there were Iraqis present who (according to Rick's interpreter) reprimanded the laughing Iraqis for their reaction. I couldn't help but think about the family of the soldier killed. It would be heartbreaking enough to have him die, but to have people (more like fiends) laughing at his being killed is piling on additional pain. Rick also remarked on the strong anti-American feeling and said that he was trying to be as careful as possible. Let's please pray for him and for the others in Iraq. (And, yes, he still doesn't use the shift key) Lol! Natalie - This has been a great day for the hotties. Why can't everyday be like this? It might be a good idea to send Fox an e-mail telling them how much we appreciate seeing so many of the hotties. It was nice seeing Jeff outside with his hair blowing in the wind, even though it was obviously cold. I know, Natalie, that you'll do fine in your agent/broker licensing class. After all, you are a LevenGal, and that means that you're a cut above all of the gals who are, um, just gals. Lol!

 Hottie Alert!!! Fox Report- and get this: They have the 4 live shots showing, 3 of whom are: Greg, Todd, & Rick. Girls, it doesn't get any better than this! Catch the repeat later if you missed it! They're on at the top of the hour- the very beginning. There's a slight delay though between Greg & the other's coverages.

 Hey Gals! It *has* been terribly quiet here! Say it isn't so- that there's been lost interest? I got on later today since I have an Ebay auction to win at 6:00. I've, uh, been a little under the weather today- the Aunt Flo kind, and they're *bad* this time. Poor old heating pad hasn't been off once today since 5:00 AM. I've just *got* to get rid of 'em today, I start the dreaded agent/broker licensing class tomorrow, and there's no room for cramps in there. I've kinda been stuck to wearing the glasses for the next two or three weeks till my new contacts get in. The ones I currently have are too tight according to the latest eye doctor I saw. If I must wear them, it's only to be for a couple of hours. At least I know why I've been having so many problems, though. **Happy Dance** I hit the jackpot today with seeing Rick, Todd, & Jeff today- they've been on a few times- Todd was just on about a half an hour ago. :-D It's always nice to see them when you feel like *poop*- always brings a smile to my face! OK- so where *is* everyone? LOL, poor Rick is probably saying, "where did all my fans go?" J/k- I'm sure he's got a lot of other more important things on his mind. Anyway.....ya'll take care. I'll probably pop in to read but won't be able to write again here till Thursday unless I get on during the week at home. I'm *sure* I'll have a *lot* of reading to do. This broker/agent licensing training book is over 300 pages- I'll find out tomorrow just how much of that 300 pages I actually have to read. Take care everyone!

 Hey, girls! Are we interested in continuing to converse on this blog or have we lost interest? Rick, Greg K., Todd and Jeff have been on today, but no one has commented. Have we already said all that we have to say?

 Hi folks! Long time for me too! All is well in liberal land aka California. The land of fruits and nuts and illegal's, yada yada! Nat- glad you got the care package. I was able to get all the Loreena Mckinnet except the Christmas,I have that on order and hopefully they'll be able to get it!!!! I hope everyone has a great day! Slan leat!

 Hi Gals! Holy cow! Has it *really* been over 2 weeks since I last left my mark here?!? Sorry about that- it's been crazy at work and then we were on vacation the week before last.....kept meaning to get in, but things kept getting in the way- I'm sure ya'll know how that goes. The vacation was great (but short!) and I'm back to my cell at work. To which- when I came back and went to my desk, several things were amiss. All in a matter of seconds, I noticed that my phone had the new AU's name displayed and Samantha's stuff was on the next desk over....I *FINALLY* GOT MOVED TO ANOTHER DESK!!! **HAPPY DANCE FOR ME!!!** Ya'll have *no* idea how much better it is for me now. I was *so* excited that I was pretty well stunned the whole day. It's so quiet, and I'm faaaaar away from "you-know-who"- I can't even possibly begin to describe. It's like being in a dreamworld. (And, yes, I really probably need a life!). I've already set up my home there, and it's just wonderful. I got to catch Rick a couple of times here & there the last week or so. I don't know if he's already left Baghdad though; Steve Harrigan & David Lee Miller have been reporting from there this weekend. Guess we'll have to see! UPDATE: Rick was on at the beginning of Greta's show last night- complete with black leather jacket..... Hey- here's something to ponder- I see that in the Fox Fan section of the FNC site that they have new wallpaper.....but nothing with the MALE reporters. I think it's time to email some suggestions..... Check this out- all of us in underwriting have to get broker/agent licenses! This involves an inch-thick book, six 8 hour days of training and money to pay for the test & license (all to be pd by the company- or at least it better be!). It's kinda exciting though. The only thing I've been licensed to do is drive! ;-) Have ya'll seen Dennis Miller's show on CNBC? We watched it here & there one night last week. It was OK- but I think his short commentaries on Friday's H & C show last year were better. Jayel- My office truly *is* like a sitcom.....some of the things that go on there are unreal. I laugh even more about it now since I've been moved though! :-) God only knows what we'll do about the 2004 election- I think we'll sit tight and see what happens in the next few months. I agree- Bush is the lesser of two evils. Teri- Got your care package - thanks!! Hope the new washing machine is working great! I know, I know.....nothing new at my site yet- one of these days! Jayel- I love that kind of weather too- the thunder, lightning, heavy rain- but I agree- not TOO severe! Just something to add a little excitement. I rarely hear thunder here in the Bay Area- I miss (some of) those AZ summer 'monsoon' storms that bring all that good stuff. Yep- I've about had enough with all the election coverage. I kind of tune it out right now; I'm sure as it gets closer I'll pay more attention. It's strange, in a way- unless something happens (explosions and such) in Iraq, we don't see much about it. Or maybe it's just the times I'm watching Fox.....Anyway- it *is* funny to watch the candidates turn their attention away from Bush to pick on each other. I missed Rick on the 23rd- we were in Oregon, stuck with CNN. Besides, I probably shouldn't go on vacation to watch TV- even if it's Fox. ;-p Jan- Don't say things like that (Rick going to another channel)! Hehehe- you'll scare us! I hear ya- we need some juicy (or at least *new*) stories with some Fox hotties covering them. I had a lot of fun withe the questionnaire. Sherry- Hope you're feeling better (which, considering your sick post was back in January and it's now February, I assume you are). It is so hard this time around to get that last 10 lbs off; I keep giving in to temptation. I'm back on track now though. Thanks for the Keen Eddie update- we've been catching it here & there on Bravo in the last couple of weeks. Ellen- Missed Rick reporting the weather back in January too :-( Ear muffs, huh? Must've looked adorable! ;-) I haven't seen Todd for awhile.....I *do* like the image you suggested of if Todd was one of the embedded journalists. Every hottie needs a skanky boonie hat! :-) He *definitely* needs the goatee back. Melissa- Hope your internet problems are diminishing! :-) AH- I remember seeing the Greg swimming with the sharks- but that's all I remember. I think I was frantically packing & getting things done at the time. I'm impressed, though- I would *never* do that! OK- lunch is almost over- need to get back to work. I'm working on another trip to the PO (post office) in there today too; even if there's no mail, it's exercise. The air feels really heavy here today- it rained yesterday & today, but I've rarely had any problems with breathing. Earlier when I got back from the PO, I felt really lightheaded and almost like I couldn't breathe deeply. It's better now (post Sudafed & Albuterol), but it's just so weird. It was like it took everything out of me just to go three (short) blocks (or six round trip). Anyway, I digress.... ya'll have a great one- I hope you missing LevenGals, ShepHerders, Kellyfans, etc. are doing great and don't be strangers! (Ha! Like I'm one to talk!)

 Sherry - sorry to hear of your grandmother's transition. i'm glad you got to see and be with her before she passed away. i was really close to my grandma as we both were in wheelchairs. she passed away in 2001 and i still miss her. but i love the time we had together. even when i moved to san diego we kept in touch by phone and monthly letters to each other. congrats on the weight loss. i watch american idol. there's a few girls that, imo, are very good but i'm bad on names. i'm a survivor junkie...my favs are boston rob and rupert. Teri - i am a lib and i don't feel i am stupid.... i am not a palastian but i am in a wheelchair. i had a bad day today and when i checked this blog tonight i found myself getting pissed off with your rudeness. i like the foxnews hotties, rick being numero uno. i love the way shep delivers the news. i was happy to find this blog, but i like cnn too, esp- anderson cooper but he's on when shep is so shep usually wins. i don't usually get upset when some of you put liberals down. you have the right to speak your mind, it's just sometimes you can be down right rude. i do hope your cable company gets foxnews soon, so you won't have to put up with cnn. peace

 Hi everyone!! I coulnd't let the month pass without getting another post in. Sorry have have benn MIA lately but things have been crazy and sad. My grandmother passed away on March 19th so I have had to deal with that the last two weeks and it has been hard. We were really close and I still can't believe she is gone. She was 87 and at least she didn't suffer. She had a heartattack on Thursday afternoon the 18th and passed away the next morning. She was awake and we were all allowed to see her before she passed which I was grateful for. I"m still taking classes and they are not doing good. I just haven't been into studying and I'm having a hard time focusing on school. Some good news is that I have lost 53 pounds and I'm still managing to workout and keep it off. Anyone watching American Idol?? Just wondering what everyone thought of the contestants this time. Nat - Congrats on passing your test. I know that is old news but didn't get a chance to congratulate you before. I miss chatting with everyone but things are always so crazy. I hope work gets better for you soon. Where is Todd?? I don't think I have seen him in awhile. I think of you whenever he appears. Jayel - I always miss Rick when he is on but did see him on Fox and Friends when he got back from Iraq. They also had him on last Thursday or Friday with Greg and Brett talking about Iraq today. He is too adorable for words Nan - I haven't watched the news much lately but I havn't seen Adam in awhile. Do you have him hidden in your closet. I'm going through withdrawals. LOL!! Ellen - This is old news but that is cool that you got an email from Rick. He is such a great guy and is so good about resonding to emails. I know how excited I was when I saw his name and Adam's in my mail box. Teri - I feel bad for you that you only get CNN that must be hard. Hang in there and hopefully your cable people will get it together soon. Well hope all the other missing Levengals are doing okay. I'll try to post more and keep everyone updated on my comings and goings. Bye!!

 Hi all! I'm still alive!!!!! I can't believe the predictions on this pres. race being close! Holy Poopy! Kerry is the biggest flip flop ass that ever was. He makes Clinton look like a saint (Saint Bill?...maybe not saint....LOL). Anyway, to thoes of you of age who haven't regestered to vote, DO SO NOW! OK, I'm off my soap box now. Did you all hear about "the poor crippled palastian, in a wheelchair to boot, who got assassinated by thoes mean evil Jews" last week.( remember folks, I only get CNN (C(K)erry news network). All I have to say on the matter is YOU GO BOY'S and it's about time! Anyway,how about them Spaniards.Shame on the weinnies!And they use to be such a proud warrior race. Did I say I was off my soap box?LOL! You all take care and remember..Libs are stupid! Slan leat!

 Hey gals! Thought I'd get my 'weekly' post in while I still have my sanity & a bit of free time. Work has been *very* crazy- I can't wait for these renewals to over & done with; I'm tired of getting pummeled and still not getting anywhere- BUT I also know I can only do so much and just try to do a good job and focus on that fact. Thanks for all the congrats on passing my test! :-) I think I was still wiped out by that too in the last couple of weeks. It's just been a l-o-n-g March. I ended up not going to Fresno last weekend- I thought I'd be better off staying home and relaxing, so I did. It was actually the first time in nearly 4 years that my hubby & I have been apart for a day- I know that sounds really strange, but it's true. It was nice to have time to myself, and even though I could have taken up the entire bunk, I noticed that I slept in my normal spot- LOL! Anyway..... Teri- You're welcome for hooking you up to KNEW- glad you can get that one good! :-) Jayel- I'm going to try to post more, but will still probably be here & there till I get through the dreaded Clinic policy renewals. Things should settle down by May. OH! I *did* get to see Rick on the H &C on Friday- that was a nice treat to a long week! :-) I missed the Fox & Friends spot- I figure it was on before I got up or he was on when I was away from the TV (i.e., shower). Thanks for the tidbit about the 18 lbs though- how funny! "All muscle"- good answer! :-) I think that the Richard Clarke book is going to backfire in the end- today they were saying that families of 9/11 victims were offended that he'd come out with his book just before the hearings. And I agree that Jim Angle's interview with Clarke is driving the others (CNN, et al) crazy- I'm sure Fox is really a thorn in their side now! ;-) I caught Rick's report on Fox Report on Thursday (same day, I'm pretty sure) about the Iraq Oil For Food Program. LOL, I would have thought I'd have picked up on the purple/lavender tie since those are some of my favorite colors- I guess that just goes to show how 'slow' I am as of late. :-p It sure is good to see him on there. I'm thinking Todd's back in the States since he hasn't been reporting from Iraq. It looks like they have another 'crew' there now. Jan- The "say what" clip about the sleeping bag was hilarious! OK- gotta get some stuff done around here before I become a sloth for the rest of the day. :-) It's part of my 'preparing for Monday' ritual, lol! Hope everyone is doing great & had a great weekend!

 Rick was just on reporting on the Iraq Oil For Food Program. I can't tell whether or not this is the kind of story that will result in more Rick reports today. Rick was wearing a nice looking tie, either a purple or lavender plaid. The annoying banner at the bottom of the screen was in the way of getting a good look at the tie. Greg K. was also on this morning. It's so nice to see at least two of the hotties in one day. I suppose that all of you LevenGals heard about Fox News being attacked yesterday during the 9-11 hearings. The attack was gratifying to me because such attacks demonstrate how worried Fox's enemies are about Fox's influence. Fox's continued success must drive them crazy. Hee! Hee!

 Jan - yes, i must admit it is nice to see ricks name in the e-mail in-box. i'd love to be invisible for a day so i could follow him around, checking out how he acts around others, to see if he's as ( i'm trying to think of some big fancy word, but ...) nice as he comes across the tube.... oh, i'm so tired i'm loosing my chain of thought. i think Nat mentioned the live webcam on the fox webpage. i couldn't get it till i hooked up with cable high-speed internet. then i was able to bring up the live feed from baghdad. videos are much sharper on cable. to bed i go...

 Oh man, I miss all the good stuff! I'm never up early enough to watch tv before scrambling to get out the door to work. So, Rick's added 18 lbs of muscle has he? LOL I sure miss that hat, but he does still look good (the few times I get to see him). Ellen, I was thinking what you wrote about Rick capitalizing, I can't believe he'd start now.....I'm not familiar with the BlackBerry, but I'm sure it has a program, and not Rick being concerned about punctuation.....Isn't it really cool to see his name in the email heading??? I bet your heart skipped a beat!! On Fox Fan Central there are several clips of "Say What", or something to that effect, one of them is Rick and Shep talking about the bear attack and Shep saying he always keeps food in his sleeping bag, to which Rick adds "among other things", if you missed that one, go and watch, it's great.... Hope all you gals are fine.....

 Hi, LevenGals! Rick was on Fox&Friends this morning, talking with Steve and Brian about Iraq. The guys were mostly serious, but Rick was asked if he had gained back the 18 pounds that he had lost during the war. Rick admitted that he had gained some of it back, but claimed that the gain was all muscle and smiled. Rick was in a suit and tie, instead of jeans (unfortunately), but looked very nice.

 Hi guys! Guinnevere, congrats on passing your exam. Jayel, Greg K. was on today discussing his embedded experience again. Teri and Jayel, it was disappointing to hear Mel sort of criticizing the wmds being not found, but he did say to Hannity that he did admire Bush for a lot of things he has accomplished too. Overall, I hope he supports Bush for reelection despite his thoughts on the wmds. Also Mel did say unfavorable things about kerry, so hopefully Mel doesn't support kerry, and I don't think he does support kerry. Ellen, that's great that Rick L. wrote you back.

 Jayel - thanks for the info that rick and greg were going to be on H&C. i caught the repeat. i believe the reason 'lowercase leventhal' used caps on my return e-mail may be because he replied via his wireless handheld thing-a-ma-jig, that, like some word processors, automatically caps certian words. So, it's been a whole year since the war in iraq began... what will it be like over there a year from now? will foxnews still have journalist over there reporting daily? i guess time will tell...

 Hey, girls! Rick is going to be on Hannity & Colmes tonight, along with Greg K., to discuss the war in Iraq.

 Natalie - Congratulations, girl, on passing your broker/agent licensing exam. Now that the exam is over with, I hope that you'll have time to post more often. Teri - It's great to see you back, too. I didn't hear the Mel Gibson remarks about Pres. Bush and Iraq, but his family background may be a big influence on his views. I remember reading that during the Viet Nam war, Mel's father moved the family from the U.S. to Australia because he didn't want Mel's older brothers to get drafted. I think that Mel was about ten or eleven at the time, so he probably grew up in an anti-war atmosphere.

 Hi all! I too am guilty of not posting for a while! Nat_ thanks for hooking me up to KNEW 610. I listen to savage now and during the day I catch O'Reilly and that lady who comes on after him with Rapid Fire. I get the station real good now. Glad you finally got that care package! I realize it's a long haul from Monterey to S.F.!Jez!!!!!! My two cents. I won't see the passion.My reason is that Mel had to open his big mouth and say something negative about Bush and the war. I heard it on Savage Nation. Shame on you Gibson!!!!! Kids on spring break and so we did our spring cleaning and my kids now have clean, organized rooms. IT HAD BETTER LAST TOO! With that i'll say Slan leat!

 Hey Gals! I thought I should check in since it seems like it's been awhile....yep- it looks like it's been a little over two weeks! I passed my broker/agent licensing exam- and I'm soooo relieved! I was studying night after night for that thing, and had serious doubts of passing (since I failed all but one of the practice tests! ;-p). That whole thing just kinda wiped me out for awhile. Last weekend we cleaned & took more stuff to storage & spent Sunday reorganizing the storage unit. We pulled his son's stuff out & we're driving it down to him in Fresno tomorrow. I'll be on the ex wife's turf then....lol! Hmmm.....what else....oh yeah, work has me held hostage again. It's renewal time for a big bread-winning group of policies (which are brokered by a preferred broker, meaning that they are just a *little* important). Here's the thing: they're all manual processing (I'm working off of 4 different programs) which means it takes a lot of time just to do ONE renewal quote, and I have 53 of them to do still (I've only gotten about 20 done this week- most is 7 in one day). Here's the kicker: there are four of us that are responsible right now. The underwriter went on maternity leave, my supervisor has been out twice this week (incl. today), and my manager was out all week. So....that leaves me to deal with the 100+ manual 4/1 renewals. Needless to say I'm a bit peeved which is why I'm doing this right now instead of working on the renewals ;-) This broker has talked about service issues with my manager, but when I've been given this book of business, PLUS all of Riverside, San Diego, Ventura & Orange, plus another preferred broker....gee, I wonder where all my time goes?? OK- enough of that.**steps off from soapbox** I've caught Todd a few times this week in the AM before I go to work. Fox decided to throw a curve ball & repeat Fox Report instead of Cavuto (only I didn't catch it until it was almost half over- which is about what I saw yesterday when we got home from work). BUT.....I *did* get to see Rick's report about the speed detector things. It was good to see him on again, it's been awhile. I haven't been able to catch him all this week and I don't know what tapes have what on them anymore so I haven't set the VCR. I think I have some shows from January that I still need to watch yet (from when we were on vacation). LOL, pathetic, huh? ;-) Anyway....I didn't set it today, and I'm sure he'll be on a lot today with the anniversary of the start of the war in Iraq & all. I'm bummed I haven't caught him so much (since he's been on while I'm at work!) but at the same time I'm too pooped to give it too much worry. I *am* thinking I picked a bad weekend to go to Fresno, though.....I'll be there's going to be a lot of coverage & past footage highlighted from last year. You gals will have to post about it and that way I can experience it even if vicariously. I wrote Rick an email some time ago- oh!- it must have been on last time I posted- 3/2, 'cause I know it was the day he was on Fox & Friends. I'm sure he got a ton of email and probably had to read & (do whatever) with it instead of replying. He's one of the best though with replies, but I've heard Mike Emmanuel is also very gracious with replies. It sounds like Studio B was really good yesterday! Teri! At long last the care package got here (yesterday)! :-) Thanks much! Ellen- I think I tried checking out the Baghdad Cam a couple of times but it wasn't working for me. Keep meaning to go back & naturally, keep forgetting to.... You can lurk sometimes! :-) God knows I've done that more & more lately. I haven't forgotten about ya'll, it's just been hectic & sometimes I'm just lucky enough to be able to get in & read what's happening. Give my congrats to Jamie on her new baby! I like the name she chose and he sounds cute! Congrats on the Rick reply! I agree, I rather like the 'lowercase leventhal' nickname- it's just not the same with the caps in the right places, lol! ;-) I think it's so nice that he takes the time to reply as he does. Jan- Hmmm...now that you mention it, maybe I've been lazy as well as busy. I think busy just ends up making you lazy at some point- or at least that's my theory. Jayel- As always- thanks for the ratings info! Fox is *still* on top! :-D It always feels good to know how Fox is doing in comparison to the 'others'. It sounds like Rick probably took a well deserved 2 weeks off after he got back from Iraq. Can you imagine how much it takes for anyone over there (our troops, reporters, etc) to decompress when they come back? That reminds me, they had Rich Galen on the morning radio talk show yesterday that we listen to on the way in to SF. He's over in Iraq doing something with the State Dept. I *think* (my memory isn't so great these days)- he's been there awhile and took a break home & went back again. He said that you learn to look for things out of the norm- unattended suitcases on the street, even a Tide box is suspicious. He said that as they were driving, his son told him that he doesn't need to look up at the overpasses, that no one was going to do anything. He never even noticed that he was doing that until his son told him. I'm sure being there for a time & coming back here makes you look at things a *lot* differently. Rich Galen was there when that 1000 lb bomb went off, but he said his hotel was about two miles away. I was hoping he'd make an appearance on Hannity & Colmes (as he has done in the past)- he knows his stuff. I LMAO about the thought of Rick baking- not in a *bad* way, it's just that the image doesn't quite fit. It was ironic that you mentioned Geraldo talking about the news in Pakistan- he *did* show up on Hannity & Colmes last night talking about it. I know Geraldo's intelligent & risk taking, but I just wish some of the other Fox guys (ahem, Rick, Todd, etc) would get a chance to discuss these things too. I'm sure there's extenuating circumstances as to why Geraldo seems to get the stories- it could be that the other guys have other stories going on or stuff in their personal lives and may not be able to just take off at minutes notice. He also has a lot of seniority- not that I'm becoming a Geraldo fan, but just giving some reasoning (benefit of the doubt). It's been nice to see that Todd has been able to cover the Iraq situation. I would imagine that he'll be coming back Stateside before too much longer. ah- I haven't seen The Passion yet, but it definitely sounds like it touched everyone who has seen it. Nan- It sounds like we're going through hostage situations- I think we need to be liberated. Bring on the Fox guys! (Namely Rick, Todd, Shep -for you!). :-D It's funny, every job seems to have its "hell time". For you it's tax time and for me it's the end of the year & March/April, but not for tax reasons- massive renewals. I *think* I'll be passing near your area (I'm ashamed to admit that I can't recall where you live :-s) BUT, I *will* wave hello to you in the general area! I haven't been in Fresno for 10 years- and that was just passing through it. That's great that you got to meet Sean, if he was closer to SF, I would have gone. Since he was in San Jose, it was just too far to go. I think it's great that he's been able to do the book tour and to meet his fans. OK- *really* need to get to work. I'll try not to be so much a stranger, but know that I will at least get to check in & read if nothing else. ;-p Take care, everyone!!

 Got to see Rick and Greg on Studio B today and have to say that Rick was looking especially great in his tan suit. It was nice to see him again and that smile. Hope the Levngals all got to see.

 Sherry - It was terrific to see Shep, Rick, Greg and Bret conversing. It sort of reminded me of the late night conversations that they all had during the Iraq war. I noticed that Shep said that Rick, Greg and Bret were three of the greatest guys that he knew. Greg seems to be increasingly chummy with his Fox colleagues. I don't suppose that Jane Skinner is worried that Rick will take her place on Studio B. Rick probably can't bake goodies like Jane. Lol! Ellen - How nice that you heard from Rick. I wonder why he started using caps. "lower case" Leventhal is rather endearing. Tonight could be a big news night depending on what happens in Pakistan. If something important happens, it will be interesting to see the cable news ratings. (And if Geraldo, rather than one of the hotties or even a not so hottie, is on his way to cover events in Pakistan, I will not be pleased.)

 Hottie Alert! Shep just announced that Rick and Greg K. are going to be on a "Special Edition" of Studio B today. I think that this may be related to what's going on today in Pakistan.

 hi levengals, i e-mailed rick last night and he e-mailed back this a.m. i was curious as to where the live foxnews webcam was in comparison to their live feeds. he said it was on a balcony a couple of rooms down from their live position at the Sheraton Ishtar in baghdad. and then he went on about the sleeping arrangements. he said on a regular basis they would be awakened by a car bomb or some other explosion. : ( one thing that was different in his reply was that i can't call him 'lowercase leventhal' as he used the caps in all the right places. on the bottom of the e-mail it said Sent from my BlackBerry Wireless Handheld. i really looked forward to ricks embedded reports a year ago. there was just something special about him. i'm glad i came across this blog with other rick fans to share news and hottie alerts. and even though i'm a liberal, i love foxnews, but i like cnn too... and i listen to msnbc in the a.m. to catch Imus in the morning. jayel - it looks like O'Rielly really has great ratings! todd was on lots today with that bombing story - very sad Happy St. Patrick's Day levengals

 Cable News Ratings for Monday, 3/15: O'Reilly: 2.7 Hannity & Colmes: 2.2 Greta: 1.6 Shep: 1.6 Brit: 1.0 Larry King: 1.4 Aaron Brown: 0.8 Paula Zahn: 0.8 Hardball: 0.5 (MSNBC's highest rated show) As you can see, Fox is still beating CNN quite handily. Happy to see Nan and ah back. Wish that I could say the same for ALL of the hotties. At least Todd, Jeff and Dan have been on today.

 Hi LevenGals!! Tax season is holding me hostage!!! April 16th can't come fast enough. LOL a h - Haven't seen The Passion yet, hoping to this weekend. Our pastor is even recommending that we see it. Jayel - Here I am!!! LOL! It was great seeing Rick today - Though I TiVo Studio B because I'm a dyed-in-the-wool Shepherder, it's always a wonderful "extra" to snare other hotties too. For those that asked (it's been so long can't remember who), Sean Hannity was REALLY nice. He signed books for everyone there and took pictures with anyone who wanted one (and brought a camera). It was late by the time he was done and he still had to fly to Oregon that night for an event the next day.

 Hi guys! I viewed The Passion this weekend, and it's got to be the most amazing film ever! It was so powerful and dramatic, praise to Mel Gibson and James Caviezel. Stunning, stunning effort! I recommend everyone to see it!

 Rick is back! Rick was just on Studio B reporting on a shoot out in Georgia. Rick wasn't in Ga., but was in the studio in NYC. There weren't many details on the shooting, so Rick may be making more reports later when other details come in. Police are looking for the men involved and have a description of their vehicles. News is so slow in NYC, that Rick has to report on news in Georgia??? I don't really care where the news is taking place. It's just so nice to have Rick back and looking so good. Nan, Natalie, Leslie, Denise and the rest of you LevenGals, where are you? Sherry - It looks as though Adam has a story that will be around for a while. It's been nice to see Todd in Iraq, but that's still such a dangerous place. There has been a report today of American civilians being killed and wounded there. I hope that Todd, William and Steve C. have a military escort when they go out, although that's no guarantee of safety.

 Fox Hottie Alert!! Todd and Adam were just on Dayside and they were both looking great!! I'll try to post more later tonight since I haven't in so long.

 Hi all, I see it's been pretty slow here lately, I guess that means no Rick. Ellen, great to see you posting, congrats to Jamie on her new son, I'll bet it's fun to have a little one around. I hope you're right about Rick being back this week!! I missed seeing Rick in jeans, but it seems I miss about everything lately, I can't decide if it's because I'm too busy, or too lazy. Natalie, how'd that exam go? I hope you aced it. Not much happening right now, I had a wonderfully lazy weekend, I think I caught up on most of my sleep, I swear I used to be a cat.............

 hi levengals, i've seen greg a few times today but no rick or todd. has anyone checked out the live feed of baghdad on the fox news site? the camera is facing where they took down saddam's statue. i just got hooked up with high-speed internet. i love it. video feeds are much sharper. every time i come on the internet i first check this blog to see if anything is happening with the levengals and to see if there are any hottie alerts. i don't usually have much to say. i'm more a lurker and that's ok, but i do have a bit of news to share - my aide, jamie, gave birth to a beautiful baby boy on feb.2nd, owen william. she's already back here working with me! and she brings owen with her. he's precious. he makes so many different faces... he's a good little guy. that's all for now... rick should be back next week.

 hi everyone! Hope everyone had a good weekend. Greg alert - he was wearing a turtleneck, reporting from Maryland. Tommorrow, he's supposedly doing his reserve duty.

 Hey, LevenGals! I think that we're having a hottie shortage again. Greg K. was on Fox&Friends this morning being teased about his too short haircut that he got for his upcoming Reserve duty next week, but we likely won't see Rick again until possibly next week. The other hotties have been pushed off the screen by all the politicians, the political pundits and Martha Stewart. These are the cable news ratings for Wed., 3/3: O'Reilly: 2.1 Hannity & Colmes: 1.6 Shep: 1.3 Greta: 1.1 Brit: 1.0 Larry King: 1.3 Aaron Brown: 0.8 Paula Zahn: 0.5 MSNBC's highest rating was for Hardball: 0.4 For the month of February, Fox had 10 out of the top 11 shows on cable news. Teri - It just doesn't make sense that you can't get Fox when they're beating CNN week after week.

 Hi everyone! Thanks for the concern! I am much better except for a nagging cough. I think alot of my problems is allergies. I am soooo envious! Rick in jeans...I'd take him in a suit at this point! Every time I turn on CNN I want to throw something at the TV! That network doesn't even pretend to be fair, It leans so left you have to tilt your head to see everyone!!!!! Nat-I'll let you know about the Savage books when I get them. I do try to listen to him. Unfortuantlly I get the san diego station at 6pm so I get only the last hour. What station do you get him on (give me the numbers on the dial). Maybe I can pick up SF easier...you'd think anyway...LOL! Well, everyone have a great day! Slan leat!

 I too missed seeing Rick on Fox and Friends in JEANS!!! Big time sad face.

 Aw, I missed seeing Rick in jeans on Fox&Friends this morning. Okay, LevenGals, this settles it! Fox is going to have to start having JEANS Alerts in advance. It should go something like this: "Attention, all female Fox News fans, hottie reporter (fill in the blank) will be appearing tomorrow on (fill in the blank) show in JEANS! I found an article which had this to report about Fox News: "In the 2004 election year, Fox News Channel continued to pound CNN as its viewership advantage over its closest competitor increased to 70% in Prime Time and 78% in Total Day, both up 14% from its 2003 advantages, according to Nielsen Media Research. For the first two months of 2004, FNC averaged 1,352,000 total viewers in Prime Time vs. CNN's 796,000 viewers. In Total Day, FNC averaged 799,000 viewers vs. CNN's 450,000 viewers." This is excellent, but if Fox had JEANS ALERTS, just think what the figures might be! Lol!

 OMG - Did you all see Rick on Fox and Friends this morning. He was talking to Juliet and Brian about Iraq and the changes that went on. He was wearing jeans and looking very very hot. Hope you ladies got to see it.

 Hey Gals!!! Hey Sherry! Oh....yeah.....I saw Rick on F&F this morning & he looked.....**GOOD**! Weren't the jeans something? ;-) I was very taken aback-didn't expect to see him on. It was funny, cause I heard his name but hadn't turned around to look at the tv yet & expected him to still be in Iraq- so, imagine the surprised when I heard "in the studio back from Iraq" and turning around at the same time! :-D Anyway, yeah, it was a sorely needed eye treat! :-D Jan- you're so funny, lol! Isn't it funny how we sometimes forget what they were even talking about? Glad I'm not the only one who has that problem! :-) Glad you had a great time skiing. Hmmm....I kinda like that idea you have for CA- just make sure they *do* let us "sane" ones know well enough ahead of time! ;-) You completely made sense on the people getting tortured thing- I think we *may* try to see it in the theatre, it's just that we're more "DVD people" than "theatre people"- you don't have to be annoyed by the guy behind you that doesn't shut up or the insensitive person that keeps kicking the back of your seat. I guess I'm just a homebody! ;-p I've heard that The Passion is *excellent* though- my stepson's fiance's parents have seen it twice already & were talking of going a third time this past weekend. ah- Thanks for the good exam wishes! Jayel- Hey- you were right about Rick since he showed up on F&F this morning! I remembered seeing a report of his on Sunday's Fox Report. In fact, he had a segment & then Todd did (or maybe the other way around). THAT was an eye-opener- he was talking about how much ammo the troops have confiscated in Iraq. I was so amazed at just HOW MUCH it was. I had *no* idea that Steve Harrigan was so tall! Six foot eight?? I was thinking more FIVE foot eight, lol! ;-p . About the whole Haiti thing- I just can't (well, ok, maybe I *can*) believe that they're trying to pin this all on us (that we 'kidnapped' Aristide)- first we aren't helping now we've kidnapped him. Some people are & will never *be* happy with anything we (the US) do. Thank you too for the exam well wishes! Nan- GREAT to see you posting again!! :-D Glad your hubby's knee surgery went well & that he's up & about again. That's so great that you got to meet Hannity! I noticed that he's in AZ this Friday- at what could have been my alma mater, ASU. I don't think he's made it up this way as of yet; we'll see what happens. I think he did last time though. That's such GREAT news about your dad!! I remember hearing about the liver regenerating on its own before, but had forgotten. I think that's so amazing. We'll be continuing to pray for his health and continued healing. Thanks for the well wishes for the exam! I *really* need to start studying- I have a week and 3 days to study. I agree that SF has lost all contact with the home planet, and that phrase made me laugh! But then I had to cry 'cause it's *so* true..... Yep- too many laws that are voter approved seem to fail in 'certain' courts....what happened to the majority vote? Teri, how did you manage to get sick again?? Girl, you gotta take better care of yourself & lock the kids up when they're sick, lol! J/K!! I hope you feel better soon! Let us know what you think of Savage's books once you've read them- I still need to read the newest. Sherry- Hope you're doing better too! I think I had a faker cold last week- it seemed like it was starting up- scratchy throat, tired, achy....but never really progressed. It also could have been allergies for all I know- there's a LOT of pollen coming off the trees out front of our bldg. Dang! 60 in MD?? in February?? Mmmm Todd's goatee- say no more! :-D I'm glad he's growing it back too- is it just me, or does it seem a little more gray this time around? (Not that there's anything wrong with that- just an observation). I take the real deal test on 3/12. I scheduled it for the morning since I tend to be more brain dead in the afternoon. Plus I'm going to leave work early that day, so it worked out perfectly. LOL!! NO ONE bought the Geraldo media pass! I'll just betcha though that if it were Rick's it'd be GONE. Of course, it'd probably a battle of the LevenGals for it! ;-p OK- gotta get to work. I'll chat with ya'll later!

 Hi Gals, I saw Rick on.....um....one day last weekend I think, all my days are running together, I think it's a sign of old age, anyway he was doing a story on something interesting (memory goes too), but I DO remember he was wearing a khaki shirt and he looked REALLY GOOD!!! It looked sort of like a uniform, but it wasn't, and I got to thinking of how he would look in a uniform and my knees went numb! Did I mention he looked REALLY GOOD? Gotta love a guy in uniform! I had a blast skiing again, this time in Wisconsin. The ski place had a whole beginner ski area with three hills and three ski lifts so we were able to learn with other beginners and not get thrown into the middle of the advanced people. I only fell twice (coming off the ski lift both times) and I think I learned better to control my speed. Sherry, you should try it, it is a lot of fun and I haven't broken anything yet. My sister had the best day----she sat too soon, missed the chair, fell on the ground and shut down the lift for about 4 minutes while they helped her up. She wasn't hurt at all, and I'm just sorry I didn't witness it :-) Nan, I am so glad about your husband and father, prayers really do work! We know a family whose daughter donated about 60% of her liver to her father and we learned then how it regenerates, that is so interesting to me. I'm curious how SH was also....nice? My theory on California: we should continue to support all the crazy things those liberals approve, let all the crazy people into the state, have all the sane ones move out, then when the big one hits, all our troubles will slide off into the Pacific! Teri, I hope you get to feeling better soon. I can handle a lot of things, but a sore throat is one that is hard to take. I know I should go see the movie The Passion, but I don't think I will see it in a theatre. I'll wait until it comes out on dvd, I hear it is so gory that you actually see chunks of flesh being ripped off. While I do believe it really was that bad, I'm not sure I want to see that much of it. For similar reasons, I still haven't watched Schindler's List, I hate watching people get tortured.....if it were all fiction, I'd be ok, but knowing they both really happened is worse. (I'm not sure that made sense...) I saw Lost in Translation last night and I really enjoyed it. Bill Murray was great! I'm not even a huge fan of his, but he was wonderful in that movie. He even came across as kind of cute, and I've NEVER thought of him that way before. My sister thought it was strange though..... Hi to all the LevenGals, hope you all had a good weekend!!!

 I'm still alive but my throat is killing me. This is the bug from hell! Hubby left again today for a week. Not as much fun this time (poor baby.LOL!). I ordered the two Savage books today from one of my book clubs. I'm curious to read them. Take care all!

 hi levengals, oh what a day... the good part being that i saw rick 2 times today, both w/shep. i started to post a hottie alert, but got side tracked. the bad part of the day was seeing that about 10 more of our troops died in iraq... some of them were suppose to have gone home a week ago but were told they would have to stay.... gosh, it's just so sad and, imo, a bit scary. what's next? it sounds like there is some communication going on in fallujah between our marines and the thugs there. oh, enough of that. i just didn't realize before 9/11 just how much we are hated throughout the world. teri - i'm happy to see that your computer is up and working! now we just need to hassle your cable co. into airing the foxnews channel. melissa - glad to see you post and thanks for the rick video, as i had missed that sighting. rick just seems to be an all around NICE guy... and cute, cute, cute! nat - i like rupert too (survivor), but there's something about boston rob that i like, thou there's no way he'd ever win. i'm not a lex fan at all but i wish kathy was still in the GAME. as far as the apprentice goes, i think omarosa is a pathalogical liar, imo. thanks for responding to my "what makes one believe so strongly one way or another" question. i think personal experience is a big part of it too. i lived in san diego for 22 yrs and i have issues on the illegals but i bet they're not the same as yours - but i don't think there's only one correct way to deal w/the illegals.... enough said and i've got to go for now ---> and yes, just where are the other fox hotties.... esp. todd? i did see where he shaved his goatee. darn

 Hi Melissa! Well I'm glad your back and I'm also glad to be typing on my very own computer!YAAAAAAAAA! To everyone-hay the computer works out and I can type from home. What a luxory! I feel like a queen. Mancows book came out on my bargain catalog for 5.00. I ordered it. I hope it's good. Slan leat!

 Hey girls, I know it's been FOREVER. I'm so bad about this! Feel free to smack some sense into me. LOL I've been working at another property right now and don't get to watch TV at ALL over there. :( BUT I am home today since my car is getting fixed and I got a chance to catch Studio B, and none other than our Rick was on! *grin* And I just happened to be watching the TV on my computer and recorded his segment for you. You can download the vid here, it's only 3MB and not great quality, but it's better than nothing. :) urlLink http://wand3rlust.com/Apr26StudioB.zip Anyway hope to catch you gals around later! -Melissa

 Nat - I was just going to post about that commercial. It is Rick with Wendall and Catherine. There is also one that has Greg in it. It shows a nice full body shot of Rick in his suit. Looking good. Teri - Hope the computer works out for you and you can get that internet access. Also Jeff Goldblatt is in Baghdad and he is looking very good!! Well gotta go for now but will post more later. Bye!!

 hi levengals, i caught a glance of rick l. yesterday. don't know what he was talking about, just recognized his voice and by the time i turned around he was signing off. sigh... teri - good luck w/the computer. nat - i haven't seen the new commercial yet, but i tend to ignore them, so i'll have to check it out. i'll do just about anything to see our foxnews hotties.... well.. almost anything...

 Hello all! I have been so busy here lately that it's driving me crazy!!!!!Last Monday I totally enjoyed,I was actually bored!LOL! Anyway, things have slowed down so I can get back to a decent routine. Last Sunday we strolled Cannery Row here in Monterey (yes Nat, we've enjoyed the nice weather!) and I found the perfect "me" T-shirt(It's my humour).Its black(of course) with Arnold S. on it and it says "The Govenator" than under that Arnolds face and under that "California". It's great! We may be getting a computer! A couple here are moving and asked me if I wanted it.Sure!!!!! Anyway,I'm suppose to get it tomorrow. If it does happen, and when we figure out how to put it together, than we'll discuss internet. We being my husband and I. well, everyone have a great day! Slan leat!

 Hey Gals! Where *is* everyone??? Rick was on Fox News Live this morning (6 AM PST) reporting in the studio about the Iraq situation with al-Sadr (sp?)- I was just about out the door, so unfortunately I don't remember much else- he looked great as usual, though!

 Hey Gals- Have any of you seen one of the new FNC short commercials? I just saw one and I *think* Rick may have been in it, but I'm not sure. I was absentmindedly looking at the TV and from a distance- but I think it was him. LOL, it happened so quick that I don't even remember what else they showed. There were three different people- I think one was Wendell Goler, & the other was Catherine Herridge. Anyone else seen this short ad?

 Hey Girls! It's been *quiet* here lately! I know I've been guilty myself of not writing in....let's just say that I can't wait till June (er...maybe July). It's been a rough spring at work- my underwriter that I work with went on maternity leave a month ago (just before the 4/1 renewals on 140 policies- doesn't sound like much but *everything* with these policies is *manual*. So that with the other counties I handle has just been a bit much. I've spent many a day "tying my shoelaces" in the last month. Fortunately, we're also having to keep a spreadsheet of what work we have outstanding and I've got about 170 items on mine- my so-called-overworked-complaining-coworker has, um...*7*. Now, either she didn't list everything, or she really *doesn't* have very much (which would explain the 4 smoke breaks PLUS lunch that she takes on a daily basis). So the good news is that it looks better for me since I have so many things listed, and even then, I'm sure I forgot to put some things on there. I *think* it's looking to my favor. If I could just get rid of half the counties I handle in addition to this large brokered acct, then that would be nice. Ah, work politics, don't you just *love* it? :-p I'm about halfway through these renewals now- I'm trying to take it one day at a time, but I tend to forget that sometimes. OH! The underwriter I work with (who's on mat. leave) had her baby on Thursday- tax day of all days- a girl, 8.4 lbs! She found out before that she was having a girl, and it's a good thing too since she got all these girlie things for her shower! ;) Otherwise.....I haven't seen Rick or Todd for *AGES*. What do they look like again? ;-p Has anyone else seen them? I just heard the news alert that they found Dru Sjodin- it's so sad. When they said "she's home" I really wanted to think *alive* but I figured otherwise. I'm trying to work on an essay to submit for an essay contest in Glamour (yeah, I read that stuff- I need some light reading sometimes, and that seems to fit the bill). I'm seriously lacking *humor*, which it will be partially judged on. It has to be about something that's happened in your life; I have a lot of stories I did for my personal experience writing class, but as I'm looking through it, it just doesn't seem very humorous. It's hard for me to find humor right now- not that I can't find stuff to laugh at, but I just can't find it in my own personal life and I'm lacking the ability to turn something humorous in my life. I'm sure it's there somewhere, but with work and family matters right now, it's been hard to find. Sherry- I'm *so sorry* to hear about your grandmother- I send my deepest sympathies to you and yours. Remember that she will *always* be with you in spirit. Congrats on your weight loss! I'm still struggling to get back to my maintenance weight. I need to exercise- I know it's good for the body, mind & soul, but just haven't been able to get into it thus far, but I'm *not* giving up- that I know for sure. Keep up the great work! Thanks for the congrats on the test- everyone that's taken it since has said the same thing- they were completely wiped out by it (which makes me think, "thank God that it wasn't just me", LOL!). I think everyone's passed so far. Elllen- I'm also a Survivor fan (and the Apprentice as well)- I'm rooting for Rupert (lol, I always want to call him Rufus!). I think Big Tom will possibly be voted off soon- but I think that Amber or Rob will be first. I think that people are going to feel threatened by them if they aren't already. I think Bill was a good choice for the Apprentice- Omarosa just really ruined it for Kwame. I *never* would have chosen her. She reminds me of the bad people at work- bold faced lying and somewhat getting away with it. Even my manager didn't like her style- she said, "she's just *mean*!". When you mentioned that you wondered "what makes one believe so strongly one way or the other"- I had to think about it. I guess for me, it would be personal experience. I have some Democrats in my family, but I think they're more mainstream, with the exception of my sister (with whom I don't discuss politics with). I have a *HUGE* issue with illegals because of where I was born & lived for so long (Arizona). When I came to CA, I thought I was more of a Democrat and *hangs head* voted for Clinton- not once, but *twice*.....I'm surprised my hubby still married me, LOL! Ten years ago, I don't think I really looked at all the issues and how I felt about them and how that made me one way or the other. Like many young people do, I went with the "popular vote". When I see the nonsense that goes on in the Bay Area (for example the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals), it kind of gets my 'Irish' up. Maybe I used to be more middle of the road/liberal, but then became more conservative? I don't know.....but then I know that the SF Bay Area has its own type of liberalism- in my opinion bordering on socialism, if not out and out socialism- LOL- SF almost had a Green party mayor. I try to grin and bear it, and I know not all liberals are bad people- but some of them here in CA haven't done me any favors. I suppose that's part of what makes me form the current opinions I have. I think that was a thought provoking question; one that I've maybe subconsciously thought about but never answered. Good question! :-) And where ARE those MIA Fox Hotties?!? Jan- GO RUPERT!! :-D Yep- Jerri got on my nerves too- somehow she wasn't as bad this time around as the first time, *but*.... Ick, yeah, it takes me a week too to get used to the time change. It's funny 'cause we never had to do that in AZ (we were one of the very very few who doesn't change time twice a year)- so I've only done this for 10 years now. I *love* gaining the extra hour in the fall, but the spring just sucks....I *miss* that hour! :-p Jayel- Thanks for posting the sites! I've heard of most of them, mainly from the morning talk show we listen to. The only one that doesn't sound familiar is www.steinreport.com. I have to say that with all the kidnappings and such going on in Iraq now, I really hope and pray that our troops stay safe and that the Fox people are taking extra precautions to remain safe. It saddens me to hear about the further killings and kidnappings. I feel sad for their families. It seems to make it more real when we see film or pictures of the people who have been kidnapped- there's a face to put with the name. I agree that we could keep the blog to discuss the Fox hotties & shows & stuff- I know the FNCC site has areas to discuss political issues- I'm not sure of how many here are members there. Thanks for the ratings! Glad to see that Fox is still kicking butt! Teri- Hope you're having the great weather we're having!! OK- I *really* need to get back to laundry & other things of which I'm sure I'm forgetting.... I hope ya'll are having a great weekend- it's sunny but cool here- just the way I like it. We have big puffy clouds that remind me of the clouds I used to see in AZ & TX- not common for here. Take care everyone!!

 Cable News Ratings for Monday, 4/5: O'Reilly: 1.9 Hannity & Colmes: 1.4 Shep: 1.4 Brit: 1.3 Greta: 0.9 Larry King: 0.9 Aaron Brown: 0.7 Paula Zahn: 0.4 Hardball was MSNBC's highest rated show at 0.5. This has been an eventful and bad day in Iraq. I wish that Rick and Greg K. were around to share their views with us.

 Ellen- I Agree. Hay, friends? I don't get Fox, but I know I do have problems with some of the people. E.g. O'reilly.I get him on the radio.Anyway, CNN does have some good reporting at times (I concur) and that Nick R. is a hottie...enough said.LOL! Hi to everyone else! Where is everyone else? Slan leat!

 Jayel - i like the idea of sticking to the hotties..etc. but then again, that can be hard cuz if you're a news junkie (like me) you want to comment on an event and ....... i guess what i'm trying to say is, i don't usually mind the liberal put downs. there really isn't too much of it on this blog. foxnews is a fairly conservative group but they do try (?) to be 'fair and balanced'. : ) but then i feel cnn is fair and balanced too. i listen to the news lots. i often wonder what makes one believe so strongly one way or the other? my arm is giving out and this thread is not on our fox hotties, who are mia! so i'll call it quits for tonight. except to say Fallujah really sickened me too. what's next? Teri - i thought cnn did state that the 'dude' wasn't no angel, they just used different wording. but i may be wrong as i channel surf foxnews, cnn, msnbc and cnbc and the regular station, so i can't pinpoint anything for certain. i'm really an easy going person, the wheelchair bit didn't bug me as much as the lib- stupid thing did. there'll always be 2 sides to everything and it's possible, i believe, for both of them being right sometimes. i have been watching a beautiful sunrise over baghdadwith the foxnews live webcam. it's just soo sad that there is still so much hatred for our troops. this next question does not belong in this blog if we stick to jayel's thoughts about not getting too political, but i've asked many people it and got just as many different answers. but really what is the one true reason we needed to have war with iraq? i'm not saying we shouldn't have gone in, i'm confused on the urgency of it all.

 Hi, LevenGals! I'm going to throw out a suggestion here for everyone's consideration. As best I can tell, all of us, except Ellen, are conservatives. This blog has always been a friendly, pleasant and fun place to visit, but if we get into political discussions, some feelings are going to get unintentionally ruffled. What do the rest of you think about basically avoiding political topics and sticking to comments about Rick and the rest of the hotties, Fox News in general, personal news that we wish to share and occasional recommendations for movies, TV shows or books? That being said, I know that probably all of us have strong feelings about political issues or else we wouldn't be regular news channel viewers. (The incident in Fallujah enraged and sickened me so much that I couldn't even talk about it for a couple of days.) I do have the names of some good web sites for news. All of the sites listed are conservative. I'm sure that there must be similar sites for liberals, but I don't know where they are. Below are the names of the sites and my take on them. If you're not familiar with any of these, you can visit them and decide whether or not they're for you. freerepublic.com: This one gets my highest recommendation. The site allows members to post articles and readers can then comment on the articles. The comments stay on topic, are often witty and are sensible for the most part. Articles are posted virtually around the clock, seven days per week, as there's always something new to read no matter what the hour. There is literally more information here than anyone could ever keep up with and the articles come from everywhere. If you only have time to visit one news discussion site, this is the one to choose. The site is moderated, which helps to keep the trolls at bay and foul language isn't permitted. lucianne.com: Similar to freerepublic, but not as many articles or comments. This one is also moderated. As is the case with freerepublic, liberals occasionally crash the party, but aren't made to feel welcome. frontpagemag.com: Members cannot post articles, but can make comments. Articles lean towards the subjects of Israel and left-wing influence on college campuses, but do include other subjects. Articles are posted on a Monday - Friday basis. Comments apparently aren't moderated, language can be vulgar and comments are often not even on topic. The comments tend to quickly degenerate into insults and name-calling, so I would recommend this site only for the articles. www.steinreport.com: This is an immigration news only site, and summaries of immigration articles are posted, along with links to the articles. Postings are made Monday - Friday. There is no forum for reader comments. With all of the action going on in Iraq, I would have thought that Rick might have been on giving his take on what's going on there, but I haven't seen him. I haven't seen any of the hotties today, other than Adam, who was reporting on the Border Patrol trying to stop illegal aliens (Chinese, I think he said) coming in by boat. I have to say that I'm relieved that Rick and Greg K. aren't in Iraq, but I'm very concerned for the Fox reporters who are there. What happened to the American contractors in Fallujah could happen to any Americans who venture out on their own. I hope that the Fox reporters have a military escort when they go out on a story and otherwise stick close to their hotel.

 Ellen- I'm sorry if the wheelchair comment upset you. I did not mean to put down folks in wheelchairs. What upset me was no mention was made that the dude was a terrorist leader who instigated the homicide bombings of jewish civilians. Nor was pity given (or mention of) the jewish dude in a wheelchair who was thrown overboard a cruise ship awhile back.I'm tired of the double standard that is played on Cnn. As for the lib statement, there are a few (and you are one) who do listen to reason.My Aunt on the other hand is not....To be fair there are also a few stupid concervatives also.Again, I'm sorry.

 Hi all, It's finally acting like spring here, the flowers are all popping up and the grass is almost to the point where it needs to be mowed. Sherry, I'm very sorry to hear about your grandmother, I hope each day gets better.....You are doing fantastic on the weight loss, I'm still going to Curves too, trying to make it at least 3 times a week, but with two jobs, it gets a little rough. Ellen, I am a total Survivor junkie too! Except I'm not too fond of Boston Rob....I do like Rupert though. My favorite was Ethan, such a cutie, but now he's gone....I guess of the ones left, I'd vote for Rupert to win.....I was SO glad they got rid of Jeri.....I'm wondering what other little devilish twists the producers will come up with, maybe they will bring ALL the All-Star Survivors back to vote on the winner???? Just a thought. I still haven't been able to catch Rick....I think with all the same old stories....Martha, Kobe, MJ, presidential election, etc, I'm having a hard time watching any news channels....I DID see where the college student who was supposedly abducted made the whole thing up.....If I EVER did anything like that, I would have to stay gone because my family would KILL me!!!! (Don't forget to set the clocks back, I hate that! I get jet-lagged for a week!)

 NOOOOOOOOOO! I want to see that! Damn my cable company to tha abyss! Now that that is out of my system, all is well here. Been busy volunteering at end of the school year events.Next week is the last week of school for the kids.This year went fast! Take care all!

 hi levengals, wow, everything's changed with this blog... what's that saying?... "the one thing constant in life is change". thanks Nat for the info on the iraqi embedded thing w/our rick. i've been hoping they'd do more with their embedded reporters. i'm watching the la lakers and minnesota timberwolves basketball play-off game. i'm for the Twolves as i was born in mn. and they just won 98 - 96. i spent 22yrs in california but a few yrs ago i moved back to mn to be around family. i come from a big family - 6 girls, 2 boys. it's good to seen melissa posting again, but it looks like people are loosing interest in this blog. i don't post much, i'm mainly a lurker. i discovered foxnews during the beginning of the iraqi war, esp. cuz of their embedded reporters. i guess i thought rick l. would be on more... oh well... and then there's hottie todd connor. does anyone know how old todd is? that's it for me

 Hi Gals! I just have time for a quick post. I have a CE (continuing education) class for my broker license this morning....4 hours- wish me luck to stay awake & alert :p GUESS what I saw on Fox last night??? I had to really contain my excitement, otherwise Kevin would've wondered what I was jumping for joy about, LOL! (Teri- you may want to zip past this part- it's going to make you cry!) Shep's going to host "Breaking Point: Baghdad Diary" on Sunday- it's all Rick & Christian! :)) I was so tired last night when I saw that, that I thought I had misheard (I was up forward in the boat and had just turned around to see the last bit of the promo). I saw it again this morning though. It will be on at 9pm (EST) and again at midnight (EST). I'm going to have to stealthfully set the vcr or tivo for this one.... ;-) OK- more later, I promise. I gotta get a few things done in less than an hour, so I better get busy. Take care everyone!

 I just checked out the old blogs from last year when I first joined! What a trip thru memory lane! I was in tears laughing!!!! Now I'm in tears because this blog is dieing! Come on girls! We don't have to talk about Rick! We can just share our lives!!!!! We're a family for Brigids (Celtic goddess, later saint) sake! O.K. So liven up! Talk about anything!-Except polatics (jez I can't spell...damn CA education!) Slan leat to all and please come back!!!!!!

 Melissa-congrats! You're a legal drunk!lol! Hay girl, not much to catch up on. I sware, I get a computer and everyone leaves! Fox dot com is so cool! I just watched O'Reilly and Cavuto's comments and the update with sheperd smith! I get my fox news via clips! I also have the ticker on my computer.Yes! Happy B-day again Melissa and to all a good night! Ho Ho Ho !

 Hey guys! Hope you're all doing great! I celebrated my 21st birthday on Monday and got drunk off my ass! LOL It's the first time I've ever drank that much. Luckily I still remember everything, so that's always good LOL! And I had some VERY bizarre dreams that night.... talking animals telling me they don't like me because they think I'm "shifty" LMAO, snakes and ostriches (sp?) chasing me, and men speaking to me in spanish... see told you they were ODD. I have come to the decision that I absolutely HATE cars! My POS broke down a while back and I had it fixed about a month ago, and then something else broke on it a couple weeks ago, and it had an oil leak (which luckily is covered under the inital warranty) then Monday I took the car in for an oil change and they said there was an engine oil leak so back to the shop it went. Now I gotta call and harass the mechanic... I swear if I have to take that car back there one more time for something petty like this I'm going to scream. *grrr* Anyway, I hope you guys are doing good, I'll have to try and stop by this weekend and read the posts to catch up with you guys, but for now it's back to the daily grind.

 Nan! another voice! I hope more folks come back! I'm hanging in there. Hopefully all will be back to normal on Sat. New computers are nice, but this one came with a name...debt!lol! yup, gotta pay for it. I was looking thru Fox on the net and was able to listen to reports on the audio. I need to figure a way to see them also. That way I can catch Rick! Also made Fox my home page! Bye-bye liberal old page! Take care everyone and lets hear more voices!!!!! Slan leat!

 Hi All!!!! Long time no post - looks like I'm not the only one who's been neglecting the blog lately. It's been great seeing Rick reporting on the 9/11 hearings and also Jeff Goldblatt now in Iraq. Hope he stays safe. I've finally recovered from tax season - now just have to get through graduations. Brendon (oldest son) graduates from college Friday and Logan (younger son) graduates from high school in two weeks. We're taking #1 son to the beach (Pismo Beach and all the clams that we can eat) next week to celebrate his graduation and hubby's 50th birthday. Logan has to stay home for finals. It will be nice to spend alone time with Brendon though - he hasn't been able to vacation with us in more than 2 years because of school. Teri - Levengals are nothing if not strong - hope will all works out great for you. Ooohh - a Mancow book - I'll have to lool for it - He always makes me laugh and think. A new computer, I'm so jealous - all I ever get are hand-me-downs. LOL Nat - Sinus yucky!!! Poor thing - hope you're right as rain ASAP. We'll be in your neck of CA in late June - we're going to a SF Giant game with my brother and then on to Reno for a family reunion. Pac Bell Park is so beautiful - I'm not really a Giant fan, but the park is well worth attending a game for. Time to slave over dinner (call in Chinese take-out) LOL Chat with you later (I promise)!!!

 Nat- we're gonna rename this the Nat & Teri blog! WHERE IS EVERYONE! Oh I'm sening some articals to you. I'll mail the 5 by 7 tomorrow. I'll do better after friday. I wrote a condensed version of my weeks to you in a letter. I've been busy with my new toy (Dell). Surfing the web, fixing stuck log-ins. All this and I have no idea what I'm doing!!!!!LOL! I hope to hear/read blogs from the rest of the Levengals soon! Slan leat!

 Hey gals! It's so *quiet* here! I hope everyone's ok & are having fun at least! What's everyone been up to? Where are ya'll?? Teri- I hope you're okay!! It sounds like you had a bit of excitement- and *not* the good kind! Not much else to say- Rick's been on reporting about the 9/11 hearings yesterday & today. By the grace of Tivo, I was able to catch his report yesterday on Fox Report- I simply 'rewound' it to the beginning of FR since I missed the first 20 minutes or so. He was on this morning too- so if you tune in today, I'm sure he'll turn up during the day. Take care, everyone! :-)

 Hello all and what a week! I'm a nervous wreck! Can't get into details but let's just say it pays to be a strong person. I have one more week to go of "stuff" and hopefully things will get normal! Nat-I got mancow for 4.95 from "edward r. hamilton booksellers".You can view their books at www.EdwardRHamilton.com or request a catalog.I've been ordering from them since 1980. So as the political "bovine fecal matter" continues to roll on I will leave everyone today with the words of sean hanity "let not your hearts be troubled"( also happens to appear in the book of Matthew). Slan leat until next time!

 Hey Gals! This new blogger is *definitely* throwing me for a loop- I can't see the posts as easily as before, but at least I can flip back & forth from the blog to my post-in-progress. It feels like *ages* since I've written anything.....er, I guess it *has* been- 3 weeks! I hope everyone is doing well. I'm back in the Weight Watcher's game again- we've finally got another "at work" program, and we're on our 3rd week come Monday. *That's* the only bad thing- our meetings are at Monday, so I can't be bad anymore on the weekend; on the other hand, it *does* give me incentive to be good! :) I'm at war with my allergies (once again) and asthma decided to make a suprise appearance. I will probably need to go back tomorrow to the Dr. 'cause what they told me to do isn't working, and they said to see how the week goes & to come back if need be the next weekend. I have that "I've smoked 2 packs a day for 20 years" cough, and yet, ironically enough I've never smoked *anything* in my life. It was kinda funny last weekend & earlier this week- my voice had a real husky sound to it, LOL! :p Rupert won the additional 1 Mil!!! **happy dance** I'm so glad he won, I think he was deserving of it. If Rob had won it, I'd have screamed till I had no voice- it just wouldn't be fair since Amber won the first mil., and they're engaged & all.... On a more somber note, I just really cannot believe the whole Nick Berg thing- that these cowardly barbarians did that. I was listening to Savage on the way home the other day and heard *that* part of the tape. Let me just say that I can *still* hear it. NO WAY could I ever watch it- I know where I can find it, but I just can't. I have never *ever* heard a dying scream and I hope I never do again. It's just awful. Even more unbelievable is that they are saying on H&C that two schools in San Diego played the full video on the internet in class and said "this is what happens to you when you get into a war that you don't belong in". UNbelievable. I would be supremely ticked if I found out my child's teacher did that (which is why I'm for home schooling....but that's another topic)- if my child wanted to see it, then that's one thing- but for a teacher to make that choice for a child, is just sooooo WRONG. What can I say. *sigh* Anyway, it's just so shocking- I don't think I've had images (or in this case, sounds) go through my head so much since 9/11 until this happened. Melissa- Happy dance to see you posting!! Thanks for the Rick segments! Don't you have a birthday coming up?? I love the layouts the new blogger has- I'm going to have to play with my blog and do some re-designing. I'm still trying to figure out that whole FTP thing though. One of these days (when I have more time....) Teri- Let me know how Mancow's book is- I've been curious about it, but haven't had a chance to peruse it at the bookstore. OK- I gotta go find something healthy for dinner. It's a girls night until 11:30 or so tonight (me & the cat, LOL!) I'm thinking 94% fat free kettle corn and some skinny cow ice cream (hey, I had my veggies & fruits at lunch today!)- or maybe cereal. I'm not sure....I have 8 pts I can use. Hope everyone's doing great!

 O.K., this is gonna take some getting use to.But I like it. So what does everyone think of the prisoner photo's? I find it rather strange that they appeared now. I have to wonder on the whole thing.Anyway... Now that I'm in cyberworld I can access my fave conservative sites!Including fox news. It's better than nothing and I'm tired of watching the TV news stations... Well, hope more folks will blog now! Slan leat!

 Hey girls! Got another clip for you!! Rick was on The Fox Report tonight talking about that awful video that was aired online..... it's so tragic and absolutely outrageous... urlLink http://wand3rlust.com/11May04.zip Not much is new. This new version of Blogger is WEIRD, I'm gonna have to get used to it. I couldn't log into it for a few days for some reason, it wasn't accepting my password. I was worried someone had hacked into my account. :( Like the new layout though!??? The templates in this version of Blogger are SOOO much nicer looking! Dude! I got a Dell too Teri!! :P Alisha, sorry about not removing you. Your e-mail must've got sent to my junk mail folder or something. I'll take ya off just as soon as I hit send. Well I gotta head to bed, I gotta get up bright and early for work. *frown* The property I'm helping out at right now has had me there for THREE MONTHS, it's crazy, they seriously need to hire someone! Well TTYL Gals!

 I sent a private request to Melissa about a month ago, but I never got a response. I apologize for posting this to the whole group, but I don't know who's handling things these days. Would whoever is handling the Levengals Blog these days please remove me as a member? Thanks.

 Hi everyone! Well, we got a computer and internet and so as the sad story goes...the motim went out and I was upset.My hubby, bless his soul said "we're getting a Dell!" So I type to you from my new Dell computer.The "freebie" computer is in my sons room. It can still be used for typing homework and other stuff. Yes Ellen, I agree! Now I need Fox! At least I can access it via the web page!lol! So, where is everyone! I had to fight my way thru cobwebs to find any posts! Well, everyone have a happy Sat. Slan leat!

 Hello all! Nat- Larry Elder is "the sage from south central".He's a black guy who claims to be liberatarian but sounds republican to me. He has a radio show and a web site www.larryelder.com. I like him and my husband thinks he's great! You know, only in Calif.! I never saw protesters until I moved out here! Don't these people have a frickin life! It was a beautiful day in the central coast(which doesn't happen often) and instead of enjoying it they had their "hate Bush" signs waving in the wind! Me and mine, we enjoyed the 17-mile drive and saw pebble beach! A member of my Church, who happens to be a war veteran, remarked on how a few veterans were protesting with flags hung upside down. I saw that today and my 11-yr-old commmented on how that is treason. I said, yes son and men and women died for their right to be treasonious... May God have mrecy on our country! Beannachd agus slainte! blessings and health!

 Hey Gals! It's been awhile....hope ya'll are doing great! I'm typing blind, so please forgive any misspellings. I'm *still* battling my contacts- it was going well for awhile and now I feel like I'm back at square one- or maybe square 12. So.... Wow, I guess I completely missed the Rick appearances earlier last week. I didn't see much of Fox Report since I had to take the bus home & usually got home at the beginning of O'Reilly (and I forgot to set the Tivo). Wow- Colorado, huh? I guess everyone missed it, but when I turned on Fox News Live last Sunday (the 20th), Rick was on talking to Sgt. Nguyen about getting his citizenship. I turned on the tv at around 8:50 PST and there he was. After the segment, it dawned on me that he might have been *hosting* during that time that Eric Shawn is usually on (which is why I didn't hurry to turn it on - I always watch Weekend Live, but I don't know- Eric Shawn kinda gets on my nerves a little- not sure why. I slapped myself up the side of the head when I saw that Rick was on though. I didn't see anyone comment on it here or on the other site, so I went directly to the source & emailed Rick- sure enough, he covered from 7:30 to 9:00 PST. It was nice to see him doing something in the studio (what little I *did* see anyway). Glad to see more posts! Sherry- congrats on all the weight loss! I have to admit this 3rd time around is a lot harter than I thought it was going to be. I *really* need to exercise more. I just did something to my my back & shoulders, so I guess it's just walking for me right now. I'm trying to be good & do that, but it's just so hard to get out and just do it. I agree- the more you excercise, the more energy you end up having, which I'm sure is the reason why my energy seems so low. We missed you around here too! I second Teri- Ellen, you're our favorite liberal! :-) Glad to see you posting more too! Teri- hope you're having fun with your best friend! I've been getting sucked into the summer reality shows Last Comic Standing, For Love or Money, and Who wants to Marry my Dad. I think it's the work stress that makes me enjoy these shows so much- I think I need something silly to take my mind off of things. Haven't checked out Big Brother before- it may be on opposite one of the others we're watching. Ugh, all these hostages these mindless idiots keep taking over there is just sickening to me. Now there's word that they've taken a Marine hostage in Iraq. I know of a solution, but it's not likely to happen, nor would everyone agree with it. My prayers are with all of the hostages we know of and *don't* know of and their families and all our guys and gals over there. It's taking me some time to get used to the new Fox News homepage- it looks better though! Ha ha, Ellen- I'll share Todd with ya! :-) It's a toss up now as to who's my favorite- Rick or Todd. Rick's been winning as of late since I've seen more (in comparison) than Todd. I *do* love Todd's casual look too. "i'm a people watcher and enjoy seeing the different ways people communicate and deal with each other under pressure" Teri- Larry Elder sounds familiar, but I don't know if we've heard him or not. I'll have to check out his site. OK- I need to get some stuff done- I'll check back during the week. Take care everyone!

 Hello all! Ellen- since Guin. is so quiet, I quess this is your chance to steal Conner! You go girl!LOL! My husband and I were listening to Larry Elder today and he was going off on the LA Cop thing. He was pissed because the police commihoner was apologizing etc. w/o even investigating the case. Yada yada... To thoes who don't know; Larry Elder is a black who is libertarian (one tends to think conservative) and has a radio show in LA.. He gave up a lucrative law job to do radio. He has a web site at www.larryelder.com. it's worth looking up. Anyway,as a native Californian I'm sick to death of thoes who think they can get their way by rioting! It's pathetic... OK, I'm off my high horse. Slainte (cheers)

 hi all, i noticed a couple of weeks ago they changed foxnews home page. i like the new look. i thought they had discontinued their live webcam feed, but i finally found it. thanks teri for the mention of the video clips on foxnews.com. it gave me something else to check out and maybe see a little more of rick. i also find myself looking for anything on hottie todd connor. i like his more casual look, hardly ever wearing a tie :). i believe guinnevere may have first dibs on him. sherry - congrats on the B's for school and the continuing weight loss! do try and watch the amazing race. these couples have to act fast on making decisions in order to stay ahead. i'm a people watcher and enjoy seeing the different ways people communicate and deal with each other under pressure. alison, from last years big brother 4, is one of the couples competing in this years amazing race - with her boyfriend donny. not really happy about that, didn't care for her on bb4, but oh well... life goes on...... it started lightning here in minnesota, so i better call it quits. later......

 Fox Hottie Alert!! Rick was just on again reporting from Colorado. It was nice to finally see him covering a story. Teri - Thanks for the congrats on my weight loss. It is a constant struggle and really hard with summer. Ellen - I have never watched the amazing race but I might have to watch it. I do watch Big Brother though and enjoy that. I keep seeing the commercials and can't wait to see what the big twist is. Last year was good with putting the exes in the house. Hopefully we will hear from the rest of the Levengals soon. That is all for now.

 More posts!Cool! Come on girls keep coming back! Sherry- congrats on the weight loss ;-)! I plan to start walking when the kids go back to school. I need it Ye ol' middle age spread is spreading!!!! Ellen-and your our favorite liberal too! welcome back! Nope, still no Fox, but they keep promising an upgrade. I did watch Rick on a video clip on foxnews.com. I drooled(what a mess!). Not much going on here. I have company for a few days. My best friend from San Diego whom I've known since1966. We're going to check out tide pools today.Should be fun. Well Levengals, take care and keep the posts coming! Sla'inte!(cheers) Teri

 Hey Levengals!! I'm back finally. I have a good excuse for being gone so long, I couldn't post in the blog. Once it changed to the new format I tried to get in to post but couldn't. Well I was fed up today with it so I thought I would go in through Interent Explorer (I have Compuserve which doesn't use Internet Explorer) and I finally got in and was able to post. I missed everyone. Just saw Rick reporting from Colorado on the Kobe case. The other reporters must he on vacation. He was looking great as always. Things here are good. I'm out of school for the summer which is awesome. I was so ready for a break. I did manage to get B's in both my classes. I got a new job in May working for a home inspection company and love it. It is just part time for now but he expects it to turn into full time in the next 6-8 months. The nice thing is that the office is in his house which is right around the corner from me and I get to work at home some. I guess I need to give a Weight Watchers update also since it has been like 2 months since I posted. I have lost 65 pounds and feel great. Been exercising alot and have so much more energy. It was miserably hot here in Maryland last week but made up for it on the weekend when we had beautiful weather. I'm leaving for the beach Friday so I'm hoping for some pretty weather. Well gotta go for now but hopefully you Levengals will check in and update us on what has been happening. I don't like that I can't see what everyone has written while you are typing. Is there a way to do that on this now.

 rick alert! just saw rick on fox. he's in eagle co. so hopefully he'll be on often : )

 hi levengals, i tend to think the lack of posts is somewhat caused by the infrequent appearance of our own ricky. where is he? i have to admit i've been watching more cnn ( i'm the lone liberal, i think). i enjoy anderson cooper. i hate it that he's up oppisite shep! i also like bill hemmer in the a.m. and depending on his guests i must admit i tune into larry king. i didn't really know about foxnews till this iraqi war and their embedded reporters. i never thought of a station being more liberal or conservative till i latched onto this blog. in july the amazing race 5 begins. it's my favorite game show. big brother 5 also starts and i do intend to watch the internet live feed. in the past i only had webtv so i was not able to watch any videos on the internet. now i have my laptop and i just got wireless high-speed instead of dial-up, which is sooo much faster, so i am ready for my so called 'reality' shows. ( the pistons just beat the lakers, jeah!) i miss jayel's stats of the cable news channels. and i keep waiting for teri to announce that her cable company finally added foxnews to their listings. i often wonder if leslie ever ran for mayor (i think it was mayor) anyway, i miss them all. levengals is the first web page i check when i come online. i just usually don't have much to say........... that's it for now. time for some zzz's

 Say it ain't so!! Where *is* everyone???? Do we need to reinvent ourselves? C'mon gals, come back! I miss all the fun posts! :*( I hope all are well - seriously- come back & post.

 This is a headstone for the Levengals blog- It started out fresh, it started out wild, Busy it was, lively too! But sad to say, it died a slow and painful death! RIP Levengal blog

 Hi all, It is sad about Pres. Regan, but he did live a long life! 93! That's something to be greatful for. What a great man and may God rest his soul! Slan leat!

 Hey Gals- EDIT: It's a sad day- Ronald Reagan died today. I know he was old (93), but even so, and whether you're a democrat/liberal or republican/conservative, I think a sadness exists over his passing. I suppose that there is an upside- as with everyone who dies in pain, he is in a place where there is no pain- only happiness. To me, it's sad- it's the end of an era, and he was also part of the "great generation" of people- those who are dying by the thousands every day. Rick's been on Fox News Live this morning covering the D-Day memorial at Omaha Beach in Normandy. I suspect he'll be on throughout the day and also tomorrow. I was hoping Todd would be covering the Belmont Stakes (as he did last year), but they have someone else there (I forget now who it was, but it was a woman). I think the older I get the more I appreciate and miss my grandfathers. Both were in WWII- paternal granfather in the Pacific and maternal grandfather in North Africa. There are so many questions I would ask. My paternal grandfather died 29 years ago- I was only 6 when he died. My dad's been reading up and making contact with guys he served with (in the Aleutians and on Tinian) over the years to find out more. My maternal grandfather was stationed and fought in North Africa and also bombed the oil fields in Italy, I believe. It's additionally a sad day for me because today he would have been 84 years old. He died when he was 64- 20 years ago this coming August 10th. So on this somber note....I think I'm going to go and finish cleaning up the kitchen, doing the laundry & go for a walk to work off the waffles of this morning and the sadness I feel right now. Take care everyone.

 Hi Gals, I'm back, finally, after my annual vacation to Alabama, we had great weather and a great time... Ellen-I was hoping the T-Wolves could beat the Lakers too,(I have family in MN, and my cousin went on vacation with us, so she got me hooked on watching the games) they(Lakers)are just like the Yankees---best team money can buy...I was glad that Rupert got the million the people voted on, he is by far the best liked person on any Survivor show, in my opinion... I know we are supposed to be skirting the politics issues, but I just have to tell you that while on vacation I saw G.W.Bush's motorcade...we were heading in to New Orleans and he was headed out, they closed the other side of the interstate we were on, and we saw the whole motocade speed past us...my sister threatened (jokingly) to moon him. We had an interesting group of people on vacation with us, some absolutely hate Bush, and some absolutely love him...I just have to say I am not too politically minded, I just hooked up with this bunch because we all have the sense enough to like the same journalists... I accidently happened upon that special, and it was great to see the skanky boonie one more time...I was wishing that Rick did the narrating, but Christian was good. I really liked seeing the stuff that wasn't aired previously, I think they would STILL have great footage to make a DVD, there is so much more going on over there that we should know about, I think that no matter our beliefs in politics, we could all agree on that. I hope everyone had a great Memorial Day Weekend, and, in their own way, everyone remembered the folks in uniform, past and present, who served our country and ensured our freedom... I'll try to check back more often, I hope you guys realize that just because I don't post very often doesn't mean that I've forgotten about you, I think of you guys a lot...

 Wow! Now we have color!Whoo Hoo! Yep, it looks like it's the Nat, Ellen, and Teri blog! So girls, how are you? I'm doing OK.Trying to get everyone ready for school.Searched the whole of Montery for sweat pants for my son...how come the girls sections have tons of sweats but the boys have none! Don't boys sweat? Or get cold in winter? Oy! Anyway,found a pair at Macy's for 12.00 (on sale!). Yep, My son will have a hole in them puppies in no time. I was hoping for 5.00 hanes...hump! Have a great night all! Teri

 Hey Gals! I just *love* the new tools!!&nbsp; It's about *time*!!&nbsp; I changed my 'name' on the blog- from Guinnevere to Nathalie- here's the story.&nbsp; The last couple of times I've gone to Starbucks, they've written Nathalie on my cup, and I've frankly forgotten how much I like that spelling better than my own (Natalie).&nbsp; I had a German exchange student *years* ago that spelled my name that way and it really grew on me.&nbsp; I remembered actually kinda using that spelling in HS when allowable.&nbsp; So....for a bit of nostalgia, I thought I'd use it again. I was actually giddy with the thought (yeah yeah yeah- I know.....I need a life) of changing my name on the blogs! =))&nbsp; Anyway- missed Rick on Shep's show, but saw him on the F&F Saturday a couple of weeks ago, and yep- still same great looking guy.&nbsp; OK- I really need to eat, I'm finally ready for dinner, which tonight will be......CEREAL!!&nbsp; Mmmmmm comfort food!&nbsp; =))&nbsp;

 hi levengals.... the few that are left... i saw rick on shep's show yesterday.&nbsp; he still looks good.&nbsp; i have to admit i haven't been watching much foxnews lately as i've been checking out anderson cooper on cnn.&nbsp; he use to do 'The Mole' (game/reality show). i got the live feed for the big brother 5 show this year.&nbsp; i love it.&nbsp; putting 13 people, from different life styles, in a house for 3 mths can lead to some interesting drama.&nbsp; it also can be boring&nbsp;as heck!&nbsp; no music, no books except the bible, no tv... they do have a chess board.&nbsp; anyhow that's where i've been hanging out. so teri and nat, it does look like it's only us 3 left.&nbsp; i still check this blog out 1st when i come on the internet.&nbsp; i'm just too lazy to post anything. oops.. gotta go... my friend just stopped in. later

 Oh face it nat! your not happy with one picture, you want two!!!!! &nbsp; It is quieter here. Come on girls let's just talk about anything! Feminine protection, Emzine, get this thing going! &nbsp; Beannachd agus slainte! &nbsp; Teri

 Hey Gals! Dang, it's getting quieter and quieter here! Is it truly down to three of us now? What's up with that? I only have a couple of minutes to post- I have a couple of infernos and forest fires to put out here (i.e., bigger than your normal 'fires' that come up) and that I have to get to this morning and no later. *STILL* going through contact hell- I'm hoping *fingers crossed- both hands* that my new ones get in today, 'cause this is driving me to insanity. *FYI* - A 'little bird' told me that Rick was going to be anchoring on F&F this Saturday morning. Here's a funny story for ya'll: I went to my PO box on Monday, took out the usual bills & junk mail when lo & behold there was a larger envelope on the bottom with "photo please do not bend" on it...from guess who. Rick! So, needless to say, I was very perplexed and very surprised and the look on my face must've been a classic. Talk about making a Monday AWESOME for me! This one says the same as the other- "Thanks for watching, Rick Leventhal, Fox News". It took me a couple of days to send an email of thanks and mention how I had gotten one last summer (after the whole "I-think-my-post-office-lost-it-can-you-send-to-my-work-address" thing). I kept thinking another would show up eventually, but not this much later. It was pretty funny, actually! I got a reply, which is how I know about F&F this Saturday. I'm suprised more than anything- I definitely wasn't expecting it. At first I thought it was because I'd sent an email a couple of weeks ago and got a reply, but then I thought, how would he have my mailing address? Like many things on my plate, it got set aside and he ended up sending the other one last summer in the meantime. I could *totally* relate. Anyway- gotta get in gear and get down to business. (the key part of that word (albeit a different spelling)--->BUSY. HOpe everyone is doing great! C'mon all you missing LevenGals- POST!!

 Hi Ellen! This site is too quiet! :-( Just got done watching 3 mini video's on Fox news.com. I like "Talking points" and "common sence", also watched the short news update. I hope everyone has a great 4th! We plan to stay put. Beannachd agus slainte!(blessings and health) Teri

 hi levengals, i just finished reading 'The Da Vinci Code'... a great read, i couldn't put it down. it's fiction but it makes you think... but putting the religion issues aside this author, dan brown, is a great storyteller, imo. shep is off this week but i noticed last week that his hair seemed to have gotten darker... or is it just my tv? nat - rick hosting weekend live last week? and i missed it? BIG TIME SAD FACE. thanks for sharing todd... i, too, can't decide which i favor more. with all that's been happening in iraq this past week, for the first time since this war started i feel more positive about the outcome. seeing saddam in front of that judge was interesting. want to say more but gotta go... 4 more days b4 big brother 5 and the amazing race starts. :) happy 4th of july

 Heya girlies!! Sorry for my absence yet again. I SERIOUSLY have got to stop not posting here.... but I don't hardly even post on my own blog, so I don't log into blogger too often, therefore I forget to post here. Urgh... sorry... you didn't need to know all that LOL. Well not much is new. I'm going to Ozzfest on Tuesday. And classes start August 16th. Other than that I've just been keeping busy with work. And my new obsession which is making fan music videos and fanart/wallpapers. I'm opening a new site soon ( urlLink euphonies.com ) for all that crap I've been working on. Still doing photography too, but I'm way too lazy to organize a photography site. ONE of these days I'll get around to it. heh heh LOL Nat! You *finally* changed your name. I went to NYC a couple weeks ago. I didn't see Rick *frown* AND I fell off a horse in Brooklyn and hurt my back. *ouch* I was in some serious pain for about a week. Thank GOD this weekend it has lessened considerably. I don't even notice it anymore unless I make a sudden movement or something, so at least it's healing. I was upset for a couple days because I couldn't even put on my own freakin socks... and it's seriously depressing to feel helpless. Anyway, I'm rambling. But I'm going to make it a goal to try and come in here more often.... like once a week or so. :) I haven't really had much of a chance to catch Fox News lately (except for the occational H&C) but I'm hoping with things calming down at work and classes starting that I'll have more time to veg in front of the TV. Talk to you gals later!!! MISS YA!!!
