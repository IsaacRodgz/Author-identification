 the past is always influencing the present. we cannot change the past but only to understand it. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ People come into our life for a reason, a season or a lifetime. When you figure out which one it is, you will know what to do for each person. When someone is in your life for a REASON. . . It is usually to meet a need you have expressed. They have come to assist you through a difficulty, to provide you with guidance and support, to aid you physically,emotionally, or spiritually. They may seem like a godsend, and they are! They are there for the reason you need them to be. Then, without any wrongdoing on your part, or at an inconvenient time, this person will say or do something to bring the relationship to an end. Sometimes they die. Sometimes they walk away. Sometimes they act up and force you to take a stand. What we must realize is that our need has been met, our desire fulfilled, their work is done. The prayer you sent up has been answered. And now it is time to move on! Then people come into your life for a SEASON. Because your turn has come to share, grow, or learn. They bring you an experience of peace, or make you laugh. They may teach you something you have never done. They usually give you an unbelievable amount of joy. Believe it! It is real! But, only for a season. LIFETIME relationships teach you lifetime lessons: things you must build upon in order to have a solid emotional foundation. Your job is to accept the lesson, love the person, and put what you have learned to use in all other relationships and areas of your life. It is said that love is blind but friendship is clairvoyant. Thank you for being a part of my life. Work, like you don't need the money. Love, like you've never been hurt. And dance, like no one is watching. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The greatest regrets in our lives are the risks we did not take. If you think something will make you happy, Go for it Remember that we pass this way only once. Time Doesn't wait.... ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Butter vs. Margarine DID YOU KNOW? Both have the same amount of calories. Butter is slightly higher in saturated fats at 8 grams compared to 5 grams Eating margarine can increase heart disease in women by 53% over eating the same amount of butter according to a recent Harvard Medical Study Eating butter increases the absorption of many other nutrients Butter has many nutritional benefits where margarine has a few only because they are added. Butter tastes much better than margarine and it can enhance the flavors of other foods. Butter has been around for centuries where margarine has been around for less then 100 years. Now for Margarine... It is very high in Trans Fatty Acids. Triple risk of Coronary Heart Disease Increases total LDL (this is the bad cholesterol). Lowers HDL cholesterol and this is the good one. Increases the risk of cancers by up to five fold. Lowers quality of breast milk. Decreases immune response. Decreases insulin response. And here is the most disturbing fact.... Margarine is but ONE MOLECULE from being PLASTIC! (This fact alone should be enough reason to avoid margarine for life and anything else that is hydrogenated. This means hydrogen is added changing the molecular structure of the food) YOU can try this yourself. Purchase a tub of margarine and leave it in your garage or a shaded area. Within a couple of days you will note a couple of things. No flies, not even those pesky fruit flies will go near it. It has no nutritional value, nothing will grow on it, even those teeny weenie microorganisms will not a find a home to grow...Why? Because it is nearly plastic. Would you melt your Tupperware and spread that on your toast? Ann E.

 --------------------------------------- A woman called the Canon help desk with a problem with her printer. The tech asked her if she was "running it under Windows." The woman then responded, "No, my desk is next to the door. But that is a good point. The man sitting in the cubicle next to me is under a window, and his is working fine." --------------------------------------- Tech Support: "How much free space do you have on your hard drive?" Customer: "Well, my wife likes to get up there on that Internet, and she downloaded ten hours of free space. Is that enough?" --------------------------------------- Overheard in a computer shop: Customer: "I'd like a mouse mat, please." Salesperson: "Certainly sir, we've got a large variety." Customer: "But will they be compatible with my computer?" --------------------------------------- I once received a fax with a note on the bottom to fax the document back to the sender when I was finished with it, because he needed to keep it. --------------------------------------- Customer: "Can you copy the Internet for me on this diskette?" --------------------------------------- I work for a local ISP. Frequently we receive phone calls that go something like this: Customer: "Hi. Is this the Internet?" --------------------------------------- Some people pay for their on-line services with checks made payable to "The Internet." --------------------------------------- Customer: "So that'll get me connected to the Internet, right?" Tech Support: "Yeah." Customer: "And that's the latest version of the Internet, right?" Tech Support: "Uhh...uh...uh...yeah." --------------------------------------- Tech Support: "Ok Bob, let's press the control and escape keys at thesame time. That brings up a task list in the middle of the screen.Now type the letter 'P' to bring up the Program Manager." Customer: "I don't have a 'P'." Tech Support: "On your keyboard, Bob." Customer: "What do you mean?" Tech Support: "'P' on your keyboard, Bob." Customer: "I'm not going to do that!" --------------------------------------- Customer: "My computer crashed!" Tech Support: "It crashed?" Customer: "Yeah, it won't let me play my game." Tech Support: "All right, hit Control-Alt-Delete to reboot." Customer: "No, it didn't crash-it crashed." Tech Support: "Huh?" Customer: "I crashed my game. That's what I said before. Now it doesn't work." Turned out, the user was playing Lunar Lander and crashed his spaceship. Tech Support: "Click on 'File, ' then 'New Game.'" Customer: [pause] "Wow! How'd you learn how to do that?" --------------------------------------- There was once a young man who, in his youth, professed his desire to become a great writer. When asked to define "great" he said, "I want to write stuff that the whole world will read, stuff that people will react to on a truly emotional level, stuff that will make them scream, cry, howl in pain and anger!" He now works for Microsoft, writing error messages. --------------------------------------- Computer science student is studying under a tree and another one pulls up on a flashy new bike The student under the tree asks, "Where'd you get that?!?" The student on the bike replies, "While I was studying outside, this girl pulls up on her bike... She takes off all her clothes and says to me, 'You can have anything you want'." The other student responds, "Good choice! -- her clothes probably wouldn't have fit you." --------------------------------------- A teacher asked one of her pupils, 'What's the nation's capital?' The reply was, 'Washington DC' On being asked what the 'DC' stood for, the pupil added, 'Dot com!' --------------------------------------- There are three engineers in a car; an electrical engineer, a chemical engineer and a Microsoft engineer. Suddenly the car just stops by the side of the road, and the three engineers look at each other wondering what could be wrong. The electrical engineer suggests stripping down the electronics of the car and trying to trace where a fault might have occurred. The chemical engineer, not knowing much about cars, suggests that maybe the fuel is becoming emulsified and getting blocked somewhere. Then, the Microsoft engineer, not knowing much about anything, comes up with a suggestion, 'Why don't we close all the windows, get out, get back in, open the windows again, and maybe it'll work !?' ---------------------------------------

 Three men: a philosopher, a mathematician and an idiot, were out riding in the car when it crashed into a tree. Before anyone knew, the three men found themselves standing before the pearly gates of Heaven, where St. Peter and the Devil were standing nearby. "Gentlemen," the Devil started, "due to the fact that Heaven is now overcrowded, St Peter has agreed to limit the number of people entering Heaven. If anyone of you can ask me a question which I don't know or cannot answer, then you're worthy enough to go to Heaven; If not, then you'll come with me to Hell." The philosopher then stepped up and said, "OK, give me the most comprehensive report on Socrates' teachings". With a snap of his finger, a stack of paper appeared next to the Devil. The philosopher read it and concluded it was correct. "Then, go to Hell!" With another snap of his finger, the philosopher disappeared. The mathematician then asked, "Give me the most complicated formula you can ever think of!" With a snap of his finger, another stack of paper appeared. The mathematician read it and reluctantly agreed it was correct. "Then, go to Hell!" With another snap of his finger, the mathematician disappeared too. The idiot then stepped forward and said, "Bring me a chair!" The Devil brought forward a chair. "Drill 7 holes on the seat." The Devil did just that. The idiot then sat on the chair and let out a very loud fart. Standing up, he asked, "Which hole did my fart come out from?" The Devil inspected the seat and said, "The third hole from the right." "Wrong," said the idiot, "it's from my asshole." The idiot went to Heaven.

 If I would Knew If I knew it would be the last time that I'd see you fall asleep, I would tuck you in more tightly and pray the Lord, your soul to keep. If I knew it would be the last time that I see you walk out the door, I would give you a hug and kiss and call you back for one more. If I knew it would be the last time I'd hear your voice lifted up in praise, I would video tape each action and word, so I could play them back day after day. If I knew it would be the last time, I could spare an extra minute to stop and say "I love you," instead of assuming you would KNOW I do. If I knew it would be the last time I would be there to share your day, Well I'm sure you'll have so many more, so I can let just this one slip away. For surely there's always tomorrow to make up for an oversight, and we always get a second chance to make everything just right. There will always be another day to say "I love you," And certainly there's another chance to say our "Anything I can do?" But just in case I might be wrong, and today is all I get, I'd like to say how much I love you and I hope we never forget. Tomorrow is not promised to anyone, young or old alike, and today may be the last chance you get to hold your loved one tight. So if you're waiting for tomorrow, why not do it today? For if tomorrow never comes, you'll surely regret the day, That you didn't take that extra time for a smile, a hug, or a kiss and you were too busy to grant someone, what turned out to be their one last wish. So hold your loved ones close today, and whisper in their ear, tell them how much you love them and that you'll always hold them dear Take time to say "I'm sorry," "Please forgive me", "Thank you," or "It's okay." And if tomorrow never comes, you'll have no regrets about today.

 TRUE ... mostly quite true... lol Rules From Men We always hear "the rules" from the female side. Now here are the rules from the male side. These are our rules! Please note... these are all numbered "1" ON PURPOSE! 1. Learn to work the toilet seat. You're a big girl. If it's up, put it down. We need it up, you need it down. You don't hear us complaining about you leaving it down. 1. Sunday = sports. It's like the full moon or the changing of the tides. Let it be. 1. Shopping is NOT a sport. And no, we are never going to think of it that way. 1. Crying is blackmail. 1. Ask for what you want. Let us be clear on this one: Subtle hints do not work! Strong hints do not work! Obvious hints do not work! Just say it! 1. Yes and No are perfectly acceptable answers to almost every question. 1. Come to us with a problem only if you want help solving it. That's what we do. Sympathy is what your girlfriends are for. 1. A headache that lasts for 17 months is a problem. See a doctor. 1. Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an argument. In fact, all comments become null and void after 7 days. 1. If you won't dress like the Victoria's Secret girls, don't expect us to act like soap opera guys. 1. If you think you're fat, you probably are. Don't ask us. 1. If something we said can be interpreted two ways, and one of the ways makes you sad or angry, we meant the other one. 1. You can either ask us to do something or tell us how you want it done. Not both. If you already know best how to do it, just do it yourself. 1. Whenever possible, please say whatever you have to say during commercials. 1. Christopher Columbus did not need directions and neither do we. 1. ALL men see in only 16 colors, like Windows default settings. Peach, for example, is a fruit, not a color. Pumpkin is also a fruit. We have no idea what mauve is. 1. If it itches, it will be scratched. We do that. 1. If we ask what is wrong and you say "nothing," we will act like nothing's wrong. We know you are lying, but it is just not worth the hassle. 1. If you ask a question you don't want an answer to, expect an answer you don't want to hear. 1. When we have to go somewhere, absolutely anything you wear is fine... Really. 1. Don't ask us what we're thinking about unless you are prepared to discuss such topics as baseball, the shotgun formation, or monster trucks. 1. You have enough clothes. 1. You have too many shoes. 1. I am in shape. Round is a shape. 1. Thank you for reading this; Yes, I know, I have to sleep on the couch tonight, but did you know men really don't mind that, it's like camping.

 First flush of love not emotional 14:57 12 November 03 NewScientist.com news service When you first fall in love, you are not experiencing an emotion, but a motivation or drive, new brain scanning studies have shown. The early stages of a romantic relationship spark activity in dopamine-rich brain regions associated with motivation and reward. The more intense the relationship is, the greater the activity. The regions associated with emotion, such as the insular cortex and parts of the anterior cingulate cortex, are not activated until the more mature phases of a relationship, says Helen Fisher, an anthropologist from Rutgers University in New Jersey. Fisher and colleagues recruited seven male and 10 female volunteers who claimed to be madly in love. They asked them to look at pictures of either their loved one or another familiar person while inside a functional MRI scanner. Eating chocolate Early on in a relationship, the images showed that the brain seems to be very focused on planning and pursuit of pleasurable reward, says Fisher, mediated by regions called the right caudate nucleus and right ventral tegmentum. The same regions become active when a person enjoys the pleasure of eating chocolate, she adds. There are also patterns that resemble aspects of obsessive compulsive disorder. "Activity in one particular area of the anterior cingulate cortex is in common," says Lucy Brown, a neuroscientist from Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, who was part of the research team. "The activity is correlated with the length of a relationship, lasting just into the emotional stage." There are some differences between love-struck men and women, says Fisher. Women in love show more emotional activity earlier on in a relationship. They also seem to quiz their memory regions as they look at pictures of their partner, perhaps paying more attention to their past experience with them. For men, perhaps unsurprisingly, love looks a little more like lust, with extra activity in visual areas that mediate sexual arousal. The team has since moved on to examining the final phase of romance. "We are now looking at people who have just been rejected," says Fisher. The research was presented at the Society for Neuroscience's meeting in New Orleans on Tuesday.

 The difference between margarine and butter... Both have the same amount of calories. Butter is slightly higher in saturated fats at 8 grams compared to 5 grams. Eating margarine can increase heart disease in women by 53% over eating the same amount of butter according to a recent Harvard Medical Study. Eating butter increases the absorption of many other nutrients in other foods. Butter has many nutritional benefits where margarine has a few only because they are added! Butter tastes much better than margarine and it can enhance the flavors of other foods. Butter has been around for centuries where margarine has been around for less than 100 years. Now for Margarine... -Very high in Trans Fatty Acids. Triple risk of Coronary Heart Disease. -Increases total cholesterol and ! LDL (this is the bad cholesterol) -Lowers HDL cholesterol, (the good cholesterol) -Increases the risk of cancers by up to five fold. -Lowers quality of breast milk. -Decreases immune response. -Decreases insulin response. And here is the most disturbing fact..i.e the most interesting part!! Margarine is but ONE MOLECULE away from being PLASTIC...This fact alone was enough to have me avoiding margarine for life and anything else that is hydrogenated (this means hydrogen is added, changing the molecular structure of the substance). YOU can try this yourself: purchase a tub of margarine and leave it in your garage or shaded area. Within a couple of days you will note a couple of things: No flies, not even those pesky fruit flies will go near it (that should tell you something). It does not rot or smell differently, because it has no nutritional value, nothing will grow on it even those teeny weeny microorganisms will! not a find a home to grow. Why? Because it is nearly plastic.... Would you melt your Tupperware and spread that on your toast??

 A young girl missed her period for two months. Very worried, the mother goes to the drugstore and buys a pregnancy kit. The test result shows that the girl is pregnant. Shouting, cursing, crying, the mother says,"Who was the pig that did this to you? I want to know!" The girl picks up the phone and makes a call. Half an hour later a Ferrari stops in front of their house; a mature and distinguished man with gray hair and impeccably dressed in a very expensive suit steps out of it and enters the house. He sits in the living room with the father, the mother and the girl, and tells them, "Good morning, your daughter has informed me of the problem. However, I can't marry her because of my personal family situation; but I'll take charge. If a girl is born, I will bequeath her 2 retail stores, a townhouse, A beach villa and a $1,000,000 bank account. If a boy is born, my legacy will be a couple of factories and a $2,000,000 bank account. If she has a miscarriage, what do you suggest I do?" At this point, the father, who had remained silent, places a hand on the man's shoulder and tells him, "Then you screw her again!"

 In Shakespeare's time, mattresses were secured on bed frames by ropes. When you pulled on the ropes the mattress tightened, making the bed firmer to sleep on. That's where the phrase, "goodnight, sleep tight" came from! The "rule of the thumb" is derived from an old English law that stated that you couldn't beat your wife with anything wider than your thumb. It was the accepted practice in Babylon 4000 years ago that for a month after the wedding, the bride's father would supply his son-in-law with all the mead he could drink. Mead is a honey beer, and because their calendar was lunar based, this period was called the "honeymoon." In ancient England a person could not have sex unless you had the consent of the King(unless you were in the Royal Family). When anyone wanted to have a baby, they got consent of the King & he gave them a placard that they hung on their door while they were having sex. The placard had F.U.C.K. ( urlLink Fornication Under Consent of King) on it. Now you know where that came from. -~-~-~-~-~-~- urlLink Fornication Sexual intercourse between partners who are not married to each other. Word History: The word fornication had a lowly beginning suitable to what has long been the low moral status of the act to which it refers. The Latin word fornix, the ancestor of fornication, is derived, meant a vault, an arch. The term also referred to a vaulted cellar or similar place where prostitutes plied their trade. This sense of fornix in Late Latin yielded the verb fornicr, to commit fornication, whoredom, fornication. Our word is first recorded in Middle English about 1303. 1. Unlawful sexual intercourse on the part of an unmarried person; the act of such illicit sexual intercourse between a man and a woman as does not by law amount to adultery. Note: In England, the offense, though cognizable in the ecclesiastical courts, was not at common law subject to secular prosecution. In the United States it is indictable in some States at common law, in others only by statute. --Whartyon. 2. (Script.) (a) Adultery. (b) Incest. (c) Idolatry. voluntary sexual intercourse between persons not married to each other 2: extramarital sex that willfully and maliciously interferes with marriage relations; "adultery is often cited as grounds for divorce" in every form of it was sternly condemned by the Mosaic law (Lev. 21:9; 19:29; Deut. 22:20, 21, 23-29; 23:18; Ex. 22:16). (See ADULTERY.) But this word is more frequently used in a symbolical than in its ordinary sense. It frequently means a forsaking of God or a following after idols (Isa. 1:2; Jer. 2:20; Ezek. 16; Hos. 1:2; 2:1-5; Jer. 3:8,9).

 read this email The Hardworking Ant and the Lazy Grasshopper (Thoughts to ponder upon) Once upon a time,there lived an ant and a grasshopper. The grasshopper does nothing else but jump around and play. On the other hand, the ant is so hardworking, looking for food all day long and store them in it's nest. Looking at his hardworking friend working so hard, the grasshopper ask, "Hey, Ant! U dun have to relax ah? Always busy one. Come and play with me lah." To which the ant replied, "I can't lah i have to store all these food." "Haiyah! Relax lah. Why u bother storing all these food? When u hungry den go find lah." the grasshopper told the ant again. "Eh,cannot lah. I have to standby for the coming winter season.Then I no need to panick mah. I think u oso must standby u know." the ant telling his friend. "Where got time...I go play better. U wanna store food u go ahead lah. I continue playing ok.. bye!" And hop goes the grasshopper. The Ant is a hardworking guy... oops i mean insect. Not like the grasshopper who is so lazy. And so as days, weeks, months go by,the winter still has not come yet but the ant is still seen searching and storing food. The two friends happen to meet again. "Hey Ant! U stil haven't finished storing food ah? Last time all the food all go where? So fast finish ah?" asked grasshopper. "I got keep but all overdue liao. So cannot eat anymore. All because winter not here yet. Now i have to go and look for new food." sighed the ant. "But ant ah.. U dun mind i ask ah.. Did u ever have a thought that Singapore where got winter?" ask the grasshopper again. "AHHHH????!!!!!" the ant was shocked! THE END. The moral of the story is whatever u do better think properly 1st. Dun anyhow hantam only... :) Sometimes we go too busy in life and following our routine too tightly but most importantly, work towards where you wanna go in your life, what is it that you want, what isit that you REALLY want, what's your dream, is what you are doing now moving towards your dream ? If it's not, dun just keep on working hard n keep on hantam only just because someone in your life told you that this is the way and just because everyone is doing it!! Dun keep on working hard with no direction ....... Focus in the direction of your life not your work but your life.

 urlLink Love Test - Animal Test 1. You are attracted to those who have split personality, like cold as ice on the outside, but hot as fire in the heart. 2. In the process of courtship, the approach that would make you feel irresistable is moods-swing, blow hot and cold in love, vacillate. 3. The impression you would like to give to your lover is stylish. 4. You don't like it when your partner is insecure. 5. The kind of relationship you would like to build with your partner is one which make you feel warmth and in-love always. 6. You can't resist desire and lust; most probably you'll commit adultery. 7. You think of marriage as a precious thing. Once you get married, you'll treasure it and your partner very much. 8. At this moment, you are quite self-centered; you think of love as something you can get and trash anytime you want.

 urlLink Love Test - A Visit to Your SO's Place 1. The road represents your attitude towards falling in love. You chose the short road--you fall in love quickly and easily. 2. The number of red roses represents how much you give in a relationship, while the number of white represents what you expect in return. You give 90% and expect 10% in return. 3. This question represents your attitude towards handling relationship problems. You like to get the person yourself--you are a more direct person and like to work out problems immediately. 4. The placement of the roses determines how much you like to see your boy/girlfriend. You want to place the roses on the bed--you like to see him/her a lot. 5. This represents your attitude towards his/her personality. You prefer the person to be asleep--you love the person as the way s/he is. 6. The road to home tells how long you stay in love with someone. You chose the short road--you fall out of love easily.

 Between Love and Madness... A long time ago, before the world was created and humans set foot on it for the first time, virtues and vices floated around and were bored, not knowing what to do. One day, all the vices and virtues were gathered together and were more bored than ever. Suddenly, Ingenious came up with an idea: "Let's play hide and seek!" All of them liked the idea and immediately Madness shouted: "I want to count, I want to count!" And since nobody was crazy enough to want to seek Madness, all the others agreed. Madness leaned against a tree and started to count: "One, two, three..." As Madness counted, the vices and virtues went hiding. Tenderness hung itself on the horn of the moon, Treason hid in a pile of garbage. Fondness curled up between the clouds and Passion went to the centre of the earth. Lie said that it would hide under a stone, but hid at the bottom of the lake, whilst Avarice entered a sack that he ended up breaking. And Madness continued to count: "...seventy nine, eighty, eighty one..." By this time, all the vices and virtues were already hidden - except Love. For undecided as Love is, he could not decide where to hide. And this should not surprise us, because we all know how difficult it is to hide Love. Madness: "...ninety five, ninety six, ninety seven..." Just when Madness got to one hundred, Love jumped into a rose bush where he hid. And Madness turned around and shouted: "I'm coming, I'm coming!" As Madness turned around, Laziness was the first to be found, because Laziness had no energy to hide. Then he spotted Tenderness in the horn of the moon, Lie at the bottom of the lake and Passion at the centre of the earth. One by one, Madness found them all - except Love. Madness was getting desperate, unable to find Love. Envious of Love, Envy whispered to Madness: "You only need to find Love, and Love is hiding in the rose bush." Madness grabbed a wooden pitch fork and stabbed wildly at the rose bush. Madness stabbed and stabbed until a heartbreaking cry made him stop. Love appeared from the rose bush, covering his face with his hands. Between his fingers ran two trickles of blood from his eyes. Madness, so anxious to find Love, had stabbed out Love's eyes with a pitch fork. "What have I done! What have I done!" Madness shouted. "I have left you blind! How can I repair it?" And Love answered: "You cannot repair my eyes. But if you want to do something for me, you can be my guide." And so it came about that from that day on, Love is blind and is always accompanied by Madness.

 He met her on a party. She was so outstanding, many guys chasing after her, while he was so normal,nobody paid attention to him. At the end of the party, he invited her to have coffeewith him, she was surprised, but due to being polite,she promised. They sat in a nice coffee shop, he was too nervous to say anything,she felt uncomfortable, she thought,'please, let me go home..' Suddenly he asked the waiter: "would you please give me some salt? I'd like to put it in my coffee." Everybody stared at him, so strange! His face turned red, but,still, he put the salt in his coffee and drank it. She asked him curiously: why you have this hobby? He replied: "when I was a little boy, I was living near the sea, I liked playing in the sea, I could feel the taste of the sea, just like the taste of the salty coffee. Now every time I have the salty coffee, I always think of my childhood, think of my hometown, I miss my hometown so much, I miss my parents who are still living there". While saying that tears filled his eyes. She was deeply touched. That's his true feeling, from the bottom of his heart. A man who can tell out his homesickness, he must be a man who loves home, cares about home, has responsibility of home.. Then she also started to speak, spoke about her faraway hometown, her childhood, her family. That was a really nice talk, also a beautiful beginning of their story. They continued to date. She found that actually he was a man who meets all her demands; he had tolerance, was kind hearted, warm, careful. He was such a good person but she almost missed him! Thanks to his salty coffee! Then the story was just like every beautiful love story, the princess married to the prince, then they were living the happy life... And, every time she made coffee for him, she put some salt in the coffee, as she knew that's the way he liked it. After 40 years, he passed away, left her a letter which said: "My dearest, please forgive me, forgive my whole life lie. This was the only lie I said to you--- the salty coffee.Remember the first time we dated? I was so nervous at that time, actually I wanted some sugar, but I said salt It was hard for me to change so I just went ahead. I never thought that could be the start of our communication! I tried to tell you the truth many times in my life, but I was too afraid to do that, as I have promised not to lie to you for anything.. Now I'm dying, I afraid of nothing so I tell you the truth: I don't like the salty coffee, what a strange bad taste.. But I have had the salty coffee for my whole life! Since I knew you, I never feel sorry for anything I do for you. Having you with me is my biggest happiness for my whole life. If I can live for the second time, still want to know you and have you for my whole life, even though I have to drink the salty coffee again". Her tears made the letter totally wet. Someday, someone asked her: what's the taste of salty coffee? It's sweet. She replied. Love is not to forget but to forgive not to see but understand not to hear but to listen not to let go but HOLD ON !!!! Love begins with a smile, grows with a kiss and ends with a tear... i din write this shit i read it

 You're Pills: Pills represent you because they're the clean type of hurt. You dont like the idea of pain, so you take the easy way out. You slowly kill yourself off mind and body without causing outer pain. This way nobody knows what you're feeling. People hurt you a lot of the times, by the way they act towards you, the things the say.. Sometimes not noticing you. But you cant help feeling mercy for them. Youd rather sacrifice another piece of yourself for them. urlLink what type of hurt are you ? brought to you by urlLink Quizilla

 Good or Bad hard to say Once upon a time, there was a king. The king liked one of his followers very much because he was very wise and always gave very useful advice. Therefore the king took him along wherever he went. One day, a dog bit the king, the finger was injured and the wound was getting worse. He asked the follower if that was a bad sign. The follower said, Good or bad, hard to say'. In the end, the finger of the king was too bad that had to be cut. The king asked the follower again if that was a bad sign. Again, the follower gave the same answer, 'Good or bad, hard to say'. The king became very angry and sent the follower to prison. One day, the king went hunting in the jungle. He got excited when he was on the chase of a deer. Deeper and deeper he went inside the jungle. In the end he found himself lost in the jungle. To make thing worse, he got captured by the native people lived inside the jungle. They wanted to sacrifice him to their god. But when they noticed that the king had one finger short, they released him immediately as he was not a perfect man anymore and not suitable for sacrifice. The king managed to get back to his palace after all. And he finally understood the follower's wise quote, 'Good or bad, hard to say'. If he hadn't lost one finger, he could have been killed by the native people. He ordered to release the follower, and apologized to him. But to the king amaze, the follower was not mad at him at all. Instead, the follower said, 'It wasn't a bad thing that you locked me up.' Why? Because if the king hadn't locked the follower up, he would have brought the follower along to the jungle. If the native found that the king was not suitable, they would have used the follower. Again, the quote 'Good or bad, hard to say' stands. The moral of the story Everything that happens in this world, there is no absolute good or bad. Sometimes good things turned out to be bad things eventually, while bad things become a gain. Whatever good things happen to you, enjoys it, but don't have to hold too tight to it, treat it as a surprise in your life. Whatever bad things happen to you, don't have to feel too sad or despair, in the end, it might not be a total bad thing after all. If one can understand this, he or she will find life much easier.

 [title] Sex makes you smart [date] Today, Tuesday, March 30, 2004 [content] Sex stimulates the brain and makes people more intelligent, according to a top German researcher. Mr Werner Habermehl, from the Hamburg Medical Research Institute, says that regular sexual intercourse promotes intelligence, reported Anonova . He said that lovemaking not only excited the body but also the brain and increased amount of adrenaline and cortisol hormones that are produced stimulates the grey matter, reported magazine Unicum Campus . ?Sex makes you more intelligent in that experiences are collected that can be used later on in areas of life not linked to sex,? said Mr Habermehl. He added that the added injection of endorphins and serotonin that resulted from an orgasm strengthened self-confidence ? giving the body a mental as well as physical work-out.

 A mother and her son were flying Qantas from Perth to Sydney. The son, who had been looking out the window, turned to his mother and said,"Why don't big planes have baby planes?" The mother, who couldn't think of an answer, told her son to ask the flight attendant. So, the little boy asked the flight attendant, "If big dogs have baby dogs and big cats have baby cats, why don't big planes have baby planes?" The flight attendant asked, "Did your mother tell you to ask me that?" The boy said that she had. With a clever grin, the flight attendant said, "Tell your mother it's because Qantas always pulls out on time."

 1. Gahmen told me last time to stop at 2, so I thought better be kiasu and stop at zero. 2. Sex is cheaper overseas, like in Batam or Hat Yai, so I thought Id have sex there instead. 3. Im too scared that Ill accidentally call out my maids name during sex. 4. I am having sex. Its just that its all oral at the moment. 5. Romancing Singapore campaign is too subtle. We need a Lets Shag, Singapore! Campaign. 6. If I have kids, that means Ill have to start watching weird shit on TV like Teletubbies or Barney, and Id rather die. 7. I dowan to mess up my hair. Do you know how much hairdressing costs nowadays? 8. If I have chewren, wait they take all my Hello Kitty dolls, then how? 9. I cant do it with my parents in the next room, I dont have a car, and I cant afford hotel rooms. 10. Are you kidding? I dowan to have the same kind of fucked-up children like my parents did. 11. During NS, my sergeant told me to fuck off, so being the obedient type, Im now completely off fucking. 12. If Ministers want us to have kids, give us some of their salary and maybe I can afford it. 13. Wah lau, I everyday kena screw at work, you want me to go home and screw some more? 14. Which sadist would bring a child into this world to go through our education system? 15. Too scared. During horror movies, the ones who always kena killed first by the psycho serial killer are the ones having sex. 16. During sexuality education in school, they kept teaching us to abstain from sex. I guess Im just a very good student. 17. Im just too shacked out from masturbating to Internet porn. 18. How do you know Singaporeans arent having enough sex? Its just being exported. Singapore women only want to have sex with foreigners so they can cabut the country, while Singapore men are having sex in foreign countries like China, Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, etc. 19. I wont believe the Gahmen seriously wants me to have sex until MediaCorp starts producing porn. (Note: please, not starring Moses Lim or Lydia Sum.) 20. Every time I have sex, I recall that the Gahmen wants me to have sex, and frankly, thinking of the Gahmen when having sex totally kills my mood.

 Guys drink to forget about the girl... Girls drink to think back about the guy... When guys are in love, they become poor. When girls are in love, they become pretty... Guys can forget, but cannot forgive... Girls can forgive, but cannot forget.. Guys care the most about the quantity of love... Girls care the most about the quality of love.. Guys break-up when they feel love from another Girl... Girls break-up when they feel the feeling of Separation from her man... Guys feel curiosity towards all girls... Girls feel curiosity towards guys who are Interested in her.. When guys are heartbroken, they try to forget About the girl by going out with another girl... When girls are heartbroken, they try to find his Characteristics from another guy... Guys wish to be her first love.... Girls wish to be his last love...

 "cite" this meaningful story from namida's webbie There once was a little boy who had a bad temper. His Father gave him a bag of nails and told him that every time he lost his temper, he must hammer a nail into the back of the fence. The first day the boy had driven 37 nails into the fence. Over the next few weeks, as he learned to control his anger, the number of nails hammered daily gradually dwindled down. He discovered it was easier to hold his temper than to drive those nails ! into the fence. Finally the day came when the boy didn't lose his temper at all. He told his father about it and the father suggested that the boy now pull out one nail for each day that he was able to hold his temper. The days passed and the young boy was finally able to tell his father that all the nails were gone. The father took his son by the hand and led him to the fence. He said, "You have done well, my son, but look at the holes in the fence. The fence will never be the same. When you say things in anger, they leave a scar just like this one. You can put a knife in a man and draw it out. It won't matter how many times you say I'm sorry, the wound is still there. " A verbal wound is as bad as a physical one. Friends are very rare jewels, indeed. They make you smile and encourage you to succeed. They lend an ear, they share words of praise and they always want to open their hearts to us."

 1. Tests have shown that women rate 3% higher in general intelligence than men although their brain size is smaller. Most women act dumb to make their mates look good. 2. Women are walking radar detectors, that is why men have difficulty lying to women. Their brains have the ability to integrate and decipher verbal, visual and other signals of body language. 3. Women want lots of sex with the man she loves. Men just want lots of sex. 4. When men flirt, they will lower their pitch of voice. Women will raise theirs. 5. Women talk and think aloud while men do them silently. As a result, men think women talk too much and are nags. 6. Women talk about their problems as a way of relieving stress. She wants to be heard, not fixed by being offered advice and solutions. 7. Speech and words are not a specific brain skill for men. They find it hard to express themselves. That's why they often choose greeting cards with plenty of words inside. That way, there's less space for them to write. 8. Women leave men, not because they are unhappy with what he can provide, but because they are emotionally unfulfilled. 9. Women ! uses an average of 20,000 communication words, sounds, and gestures a day. Men only use about 7,000. 10. So if a woman is talking to you a lot, she likes you. But if she's not talking, you're in trouble. 11. Men are more thick-skined than women. Literally. Which explains why women have more wrinkles than men. Boys lose their sensitivity to touch by the time they reach puberty. So where does all that sensitivity go? It all goes to just one area. 12. If a woman is unhappy in her relationship, she can't concentrate on her work. If a man is unhappy at work, he can't focus on his relationship. 13. Men can only do one thing at a time. When they stop their car to read a street directory, they have to turn down the radio. Women's brains are configured for multi-tasking performance. They can talk on the phone, watch the TV and cook at the same time. 14. Most men get a brain hemorrhage after 20 minutes of clothes shopping. 15. When it comes to sex, women need a reason; men need a place. 16. 15% to 20% of men have feminised brains. About 10% of women have masculinised brains. So there are more gays than lesbians in the world.

 A long time ago, there was an Emperor who told his horseman that if he could ride on his horse and cover as much land area as he likes, then the Emperor would give him the area of land he has covered. Sure enough, the horseman quickly jumped onto his horse and rode as fast as possible to cover as much land area as he could. He kept on riding and riding, whipping the horse to go as fast as possible. When he was hungry or tired, he did not stop because he wanted to cover as much area as possible. It came to a point when he had covered a substantial area and he was exhausted and was dying. Then he asked himself, "Why did I pushed myself so hard to cover so much land area? Now I am dying and I only need a very small area to bury myself." The above story is similar with the journey of our Life. We push very hard everyday to make more money, to gain more power and more recognition. We neglect our health, time with our family and to appreciate the surrounding beauty and the hobbies we enjoy. One day when we look back, we will realize that we don't really need that much, but then we cannot turn back time for what we have missed. Life is not just about making money, acquiring power or recognition. Life is definitely not about work! Work is only necessary to earn a living so that we can enjoy the convenience and pleasures of life. Life is a balance of Work and Play, Family and Personal time. You have to decide how you want to balance your Life. Define your priorities, realize what you are able to compromise but always let some of your decisions be based on your instincts. Happiness is the meaning and the purpose of Life, the whole aim of human existence. So, take it easy, do what you want to do and appreciate nature. Life is fragile, Life is short. Do not take Life for granted. Live a balanced lifestyle. Enjoy Life! Watch your thoughts; they become words. Watch your words; they become actions. Watch your actions; they become habits. Watch your habits; they become character. Watch your character; it becomes your destiny

Scary!! => urlLink Worm cuts off antivirus programs A new worm can shut down antivirus applications, according to security firm F-Secure A new worm variant that can terminate antivirus applications was discovered last Friday, prompting Internet security vendor F-Secure to issue a level two warning. The variant, called Zafi.B, is spread through email attachments in PIF., EXE. or Com attachments, and according to F-Secure, the worm "terminates all applications that have 'firewall' or 'virus' in their file-name". The worm is capable of transmitting in several languages, including English, Italian, Spanish, Russian, Swedish, German or Finnish, said F-Secure, and spreads itself by collecting email addresses from the recipient's address book. Zafi.B copies itself to the Windows System Directory when activated, and replicates itself as either "winamp 7.0 full_install.exe" or "Total Commander 7.0 full_install.exe" files in folders that contain "share" or "upload" in their names, according to F-Secure. Manager for F-Secure, Mikael Albrecht, says the worm is particularly complicated as it has the capacity to penetrate firewalls and antivirus applications in order to "help itself spread further". "Another interesting thing about this worm is that the infected messages come in many different languages. As most of the widely spread worms use only English, this feature may confuse the user to open the message - and the worm spreads on", he said. However, Internet security firm Symantec has listed the virus as having an "easy" threat-containment rating and a "low" geographical distribution area. A Symantec spokesman maintained that the worm is still "nothing significant". "The worm tries to disable the security processes on the machine to make it more vulnerable to other attacks," said the spokesman. He said that users who notice unusual messages regarding system vulnerability may be infected and should scan their computers to guard against further infection. NO Comments.. juz scary!

 gone to the new jurong library yesterday it's see-through.. kinda sucky design of the whole building i hate the concept; would prefer woodlands library the see-through effect only allows library users to look out to the road and some of the surroundings... nothing impressive or soothing.. kids passingby outside can disturb the users' peace by knocking or banging on the glass... the library is big n spacious n i aint famaliar wif the place. after the less-than-an-hour futile library trip, went to jp to fetch dear home slacking at home for the pass few days after the pc show missed the hitler n stalin biography on monday nite though :( pc show at expo from 3rd till 6th june it was real packed n bz there seems much more sales than the it fair though my company sales was not so good compared to then on 2nd day after rdshow, i had the worst scariest experience ever in my life in the clementi mrt toilet! betta not too much details images of tat day still run thru my head once a while!

 currently still figuring out how to write resume, cover letter & CV. but at least finally know their difference liaoz

 Once upon a time, there was a teacher and his student lying down under a big tree near a big grass area. Then, suddenly, the student asked the teacher, Student : Teacher, I'm confused, how can we find our soul-mate? Can you please help me? Teacher : (Silent for few second, than he answer) Well, it's a pretty hard and easy question. Student : (Thinking hard) Huh??? Teacher : Look on that way, there are a lot of grass there, why don't you walk there but please never walk backward, just walk straight ahead. On your way, try to find a beautiful grass and pick it up then give it to me. But just one. Student : Well, ok then... wait for me... (walked straight ahead to the grass field). A few minutes later... Student : I'm back. Teacher : Em, well I don't see any beautiful grass on your hand. Student : On my journey, I found few beautiful grass, but I thought that I would find a better one, so I didn't pick it up. But I didn't realize that I'm at the end of the field, and I hadn't picked up any. Cause you told me not to go back, so I didn't go back. Teacher : That's what happened in real life. What is the message of this story? * Grass - is people around you * Beautiful Grass - is people that attract you * Grass Field - is time * In looking for your soulmate, please don't always compare and hope that there will be a better one. By doing that, you'll waste your lifetime, cause remember "Time Never Goes Back". It applies the same in finding your ideal life partner, your suitable career or business, therefore the morale is LOVE & grab hold of the opportunity that you have now, don't waste time! ** There Can Be Only One **

 This is a forwarded message Subject: softdrinks ===8 For those of you who likes soft drinks, think twice ! drink beer Please read this. An interesting piece of information....... Have a look at the wrapper on a *oca-*ola 1.5 liter bottle and in the ingredients label you will find phosphoric acid in it. Minute quantities of ethylene glycol are also used (which is acknowledged in the soft drink world for making it really chill). This is popularly known as anti-freeze which prevents water from freezing at 0 deg C and instead drops it 4-5 degrees with minute quantities. This chemical is a known slow poison in the caliber of arsenic. So, if you manage to drink about 4 liters of *oke within an hour or so, you can die. Read along and give up these dangerous things. Be natural; have flavored milks, tender coconuts, buttermilk, lassi and plain water instead of these "soft" drinks. Guess what's the pH for soft drinks, e.g. *oke? pH 3.4! This acidity is strong enough to dissolve teeth and bones! Our human body stops building bones at the age of about 30. Soft drinks do have any nutrition value (in terms of vitamins & minerals). It is high in sugar content, carbonic acid, chemicals i.e. colorings etc. Some like to take cold soft drinks after each meal. Guess what's the impact? Our body needs an optimum temperature of 37 degrees Celsius for digestive enzyme functioning. The temperature of cold soft drinks is very much below 37 degrees or even close to 0 degrees Celsius. This will dilute the enzymes & stress the digestive system. The food taken will not be digested. In fact it will be fermented! The fermented food produces gases, decays and becomes toxin, gets absorbed by the intestine, circulates in the blood stream and is carried to the whole body. Hence toxin is cumulated in other parts of the body, developing into various diseases. Think before you drink *oke/*epsi (or any soft drink) again. Have you ever thought what you drink when you drink an aerated drink? You gulp down carbon dioxide, when nobody in the world would advise you to drink CO2. Two months back, there was a competition at Delhi University "Who could drink the most *oke?" The winner drank 8 bottles and fainted on the spot-too much CO2 in the blood. Thereafter, the principal banned all soft drinks from the college canteen! While this might have been an extreme measure, their results do provide some food for thought. Did you know that soft drinks use chemicals in them that cause immense harm to you. Someone put a broken tooth in a bottle of *epsi and in 10 days it DISSOLVED! Can you believe it? Teeth and bones are the only human parts that stay intact for years after death. Imagine what the drink must be doing to your soft intestines and stomach lining! ===8
