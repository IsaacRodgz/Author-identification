 Dreams, unemployment, car accidents and DND I tried to start to be part of a D&D game last night. We made characters and are meeting next monday to start the quest. Then... I had a dream last night. I was having dinner with a bunch of friends. Karla and a boyfriend of hers that I had never seen were also eating with us. Karla was on the table next to us and he was sitting across from me. I was on the bench side and we had two 4-person tables tables pulled together for the gathering. Over the course of the meal, whenever I turned to talk to the table where karla and the friends were sitting, her boyfriend would put stuff in my drink. One time it was a lemon, One time it was fish bones. The second time, I yelled at him to stop messing with my drink. Karla asked me why I was freaking out, and I just yelled that she was trying to poison me. She tried to explain that it was a joke, but I just kept yelling "You're trying to poison me". She started crying and I woke up. After waking up, I recalled every time I have ever let my mother down and then I felt horrible inside. I've decided that my dream and the D&D are somehow connected and I will not be playing anymore. I woke up at 7am this morning, for I had a meeting with the unemployment peeps. Just a "Getting a job" class, but I read, so that was fun. I'm finishing up the "Children of the Mind" by Orson Scott Card, book 4 of the ender's series. Driving back from hanging out with Cliff today, there was a car accident in front of my house. I don't know how it happened. I was thinking about blogging, then I look and see 2 cars spinning in unison in front of me. It was so weird. Tonight we celebrate cahlens birthday. YAY!!! I got a 160GB HD for my birthday, so that's fun:) Well, I'm going to go practice the piano now. Peace-

 piano lessons today I have my wonderful piano lessons. Thanks for listening to me rant and rave last night. Sometimes I just need to go off on my achilles heel. Subway for lunch maybe? :) Peace-

 Achilles Heel I'd have to say that my one social problem (achilles heel) would have to be my voice. In everything I attempt to do, my voice is there. My lisp is there. My "funny talking" is there. I think it makes me come across as stupid. I think it causes some people to take pitty on me, while on others it makes them pissed off if I'm put into a leadership role ahead of them. Other people tend to think that I not know what I'm getting myself into, as if I couldn't understand it. Sometimes I wonder if I sound like a down syndrome person. I know that women find me completely harmless, not that I mind. I would like a mutual attraction. No matter where I go I take my achilles heel with me. It is a constant reminder that no matter how hard I try at something, certain people will never take me seriously, and certain people will hate me. Certain people will try with all their might to protect me, as if I can't deal with something myself. Do I look in the mirror and see a down syndrome baby? I hate my speech impediment. Of course it helps when I look up speech impediment on google and it come up with: urlLink 'Speech impediments may manifest as stutters or lisps or may be more severe. Severe speech impediments are relatively more common among people with cerebral palsy and can be associated with other physical disabilities or deafness. Relatively minor speech impediments may have a basis in a psychological disability or mental illness, but this should not be assumed.' I guess this should mean that I'm more employable? Anyway, I should go. I have the piano to practice. Peace-

 diary Sometimes I wonder if this online diary is doing more damage than any good that may come from it. Maybe I should give it up for a while. I don't know. Am I in love? Could I be? What is relationship? Trust? commitment? I don't know... I know I appreciate all my friendships and will continue them till my friends have an intervention.... Well, my alarm is going off, I should practice piano for my last 2 hours before piano lessons. Peace-

 mmm... fish Sometimes I ask myself "What should I be doing?" Most of the time I just go with the flow though. So, when I do ponder the "what" question, it usually has something to be doing with my real life at the moment. I've been thinking about the situation that I'm in and about hurting people. I found out that I'm not hurting someone I thought I was and so that gives me some relief. I know that through no conscience act I've gotten to the point that I can hurt people by not doing anything wrong. Some say that I am the victim and that I'm being preyed upon. That is bullshit. If I'm hurting anyone, or am going to be hurt, I have done so with both eyes open, neither fearing nor blindly following. I have seen what I want. I know what I think I want. Blogs... Have I been to honest with you? Will my friends hate me? Will I destroy friendships? Will I leave and not look back? Will I find a happy medium of telling my blog only certain things and then keeping myself hidden? I once told a girl that I would not ask her out for a number of reasons and she asked me why, and I told her. This of course would be after she had just told me that she was not interested in a dating relationship. After telling her my reasons for doubts, she would not tell me why she would not date me. She told me it would hurt me too much. I felt betrayed and pissed off. I wondered how I could possibly work on traits that she found to be undate-able, if she would not tell me. I often wonder, if she knew that she pissed me off and that I would rather know, than not know. Or maybe it was that she was shallow? Could it be that she didn't find me attractive? in a physical sense? Enough philosophy... Updates: Party went well yesterday. i think everyone had a good time, except maybe Dan who was trying to sleep. I went and found Cindy an apartment today. She's moving to Ballard in December. Dinner was at anthonys. I had some salmon and halibut. It was SO delicious. Anyway, I need to practice my piano before I screw up royally tomorrow. I'll catch you later-

 Humoungously busy So... I hate the feeling that you're letting EVERYONE down. Today, I was too impatient with Dan and I didn't set aside enough time for Peter. These two things were at perpendicular to each other, and were unavoidable. I was supposed to play football with Peter, Dan said that Peter wasn't going to be home till 4, so I should go to lunch with him. Well, since Peter would be gone till 4pm I did go to lunch. But then he wanted to go to Target for a quick shop. Long story short, we get home at 3pm. Nate is coming over for beer at Teddys and to go to best buy. Lunch was at 11:30, I should have been fine, even when peter came home at 1, I should have been fine, but that DAMN target trip. Dan's pissed at me for being impatient, I'm pissed at Dan for making me miss time with Peter, and Peter's pissed because I didn't make him the priority. This IS a GREAT party atmosphere. I think I've fucked up another friendship and I feel like I'm about as comforting as a hurricane. I try and be the best man I can be, and I think people are still getting hurt. And now I think I may have found some work. We'll see. Anyway, Master and Commander was great, and City of Lost children was awesome in that way that Amelie was awesome. Hopefully, I'll see you all tomorrow. Peace-

 ugh Life is beautiful. It's pay day today. So that's exciting. I came to a realization last night. I've been creating a computer for about the last 6 months. I've gotten hard drives, a sound card, a DVD+-RW, and a case. All that's left is Mobo, CPU, RAM and a video card. I can't pull the trigger, and I don't really care right now. I'd much rather spend the 500 bucks on friends and good times than on a computer I don't need. I was playing games last night and realized that I was enjoying myself. If I can enjoy my games without upgrading and spending the extra dough, then why should I? So I'll be upgrading my fashion sense instead. I have never spent much money on the packaging of Tim. I will now be buying a new wardrobe to go with the new slender Tim. Well, I need to go deposit the paycheck. Catch you later-

 happy day after my birthday I don't know why I get so moody sometimes. I think it must be that time of the month for me. I'm sleepy. Say hello to moody tim. Seriously, I'm not usually this crabby. I don't know whats up. I don't have the words right now. I need to go hide. Check you later-

 damn blogger and office So I had this blog all written out and went to check on something in office. Anyway, office sent me to a website and killed my blog. I was just thinking about how we are unable to go through life without hurting someone. I have never purposefully tried to hurt someone and I think I may have gotten into a situation where someone is going to get hurt. I wish I could find a way out where everyone involved could happy and not hurt. But I can't see the way. I'm trying to get to a much more flexible life, where I'm not planning things out 2 - 3 weeks in advance, but things keep on filling up. It's my birthday. Today we're going to ballard bar and grill. The matrix. and Tony Romas. Tomorrow is dinner and anime with Jarred. Thursday is dinner with Cindy. Saturday is party at my hizouse for Cahlen, karla and my birthdays. Should be a good time. OK, I'm going to burgers now. Check yous later-

 Life and something like it And I'm back... with a vengence:) How is everyone doing? Did you miss me? Were there any emergencies you needed me to take care of? No? OK So I updated my friendster profile. I don't know how to show you, so you'll just have to sign up to friendster and read about it. Anyway, I arrived with my MS software having shown up. So that was rather AWESOME. OK, I'm going to go for now. I'll check you later-

 women 2.0 as you all know, generalizations do not hold true to every person. If you happen to be a woman reading this blog and it doesn't pertain to you. Then know that you are unique, at least in what I've come to understand women. And if we are friends then it is probably true that you do not date mostly jerks as I don't like to associate myself with such women, nor do I have friends that are jerks, so they tend not to attract said women. I'm leaving for idaho in 7.5 hours. I'll catch you guys later. Peace-

 what we really want I was thinking about wants today. Thinking about the feeling of wanting to be accepted and how different people play that out as different roles. Sometimes I wish I had it all figured out. What I really want, what would fulfill my life and make me the man I want to be. But then I realize that's what everyone wants. A clear path where all the choice were already made and you just had to follow the steps correctly. But then there would be no fun. Well, I need to pack. I'm headed to idaho to bring Cindy back to Seattle tomorrow and am waking at 5am so I can get there in 1 day. Peace-

 freezing Here's what an interesting little quiz told me I was- Protector urlLink The ULTIMATE personality test brought to you by urlLink Quizilla Also it is freezing in seattle. Literally, and my single-pane windows aren't cutting the chill at all. But it's nothing a warm body couldn't cure:) Peace-

 commenting So I found a free commenter thingy, in case you didn't notice. Piano lessons were wonderful today. Unfortunately Jewel's book of music is a little too advanced for me right now. So I have Bach, minuet in G that I'm practicing for my piece right now. Tonight I'm going to costco to find a new piano with weighted keys. Hopefully it won't be too expensive. Well, I need to get back to Xenocide. Check ya later-

 what I've learned about women This is something I've been thinking about, and which I may be totally wrong, but I wanted to share it with you. From what I can tell, women want power and comfort. They often tell me that they want a man that will hold them and cuddle, but often end up with jerks. I've often considered this very ironic and have been perplexed by my other sensitive brothers. We have often commented that the girls always go for the jerks and I think I have a theory why. I think that they see these men as the future leaders of our society at least subconsciencely. Women are drawn to ambitious men. I've often heard them say that they would be with a man who knows what he wants. I tell you that any man worth reproducing with, will not be so closed minded as only seeing a single future within his life. He will not expect to be the next president of the united states. He will not put down his fellow man in order for his own gain. The women see that the jerk is a jerk from the get out. But they don't see a jerk. They see a man with ambition. A man that won't let another man get in his way, and he wants to be with her. Well why shouldn't she be with him. If he becomes rich and powerful, why not be there with him. I've often been perplexed by young girls dreams of being a princess or a long lost relative of some rich and powerful person. I've never understood why they would want to give up their family for the power of a title. I think it has to do with society placing beauty before wisdom. Women see the princess as always getting her way, their way. Sometimes I wish this were a discussion instead of a "post", or that I'd at least be able to communicate with you. I'm going to try and get a comments board up, but am having trouble finding one. Peace out-

 Mortality I've been reading Xenocide, by Orson Scott Card, tonight. I was planning on going to bed around 10ish. Well, that didn't seem to work:) Some of the ideas and characters presented in these books are very emotionally straining on me for some reason. I often wonder how I can tear up at a stupid story. I've always been impressed by peoples abilities to pull on heart strings through meer words and stories. I am continually being challenged by my own mortality. I was thinking about how I'm turning 26 in one week. I often ponder who I may have affected in the first 26 years of my life that would care if I were here or not. Of course, then I start to think of the people that I love. The people that have affected me in such a way that I would truly mourn their passing into whatever may be after death. (Don't even get me started on life after death as this has become a serious question of my faith recently) How is it that we get to be where we are and not continually try to be with the ones we love. I have such emotional controll over my life that I can sit here now and talk about these things with you, that I may never have to bring them up with the people that I trully care about. Sometimes I wish I were more in touch with my feelings that I could just do stuff without thinking of consequences. Or maybe I don't think of consequences correctly and so I don't allow my emotional to help me decide things. Overall I think I have a rather boring life. Won't someone help me? Sometimes I wish I could not have self doubt and/or fear of rejection. I often wonder if I could live by some of the advice I give or if it's all just a lie. A man described me as a punk thinker last night. i.e. punk because of my blue hair, and thinker because of my glasses. I think that maybe I'm just trying to get new experiences. Do I not shave my beard because I think it might make me more attractive to the women I want to meet? or do I not shave my beard because I'm lazy? What do I want? I know that I need to find someone who won't judge me for my online journal. I am looking for what everyone is looking for. Someone who can accept me for who I am, even when I'm trying to be cute and humorous and it comes out as disgusting and inappropriate. Someone who I don't have sexually repulsive:) All other points can be discussed-

 Life or something like it... and part of me I have fully regressed to quiet introspective Tim. At times I will be outrageous party Tim, and at other times I'll be quiet introspective Tim. It's a cycle. Ups and downs. I first heard the idea of our selfs as cycles in Highschool, from a man I trully respect and value the opinion of. So I'm introspective Tim today. Unfortunately I have the little motivation to leave the hizouse these days. Which means my friends are missing me:( Piano lessons are going great. I'm going to get my book of jewels songs on piano. So that's exciting. I'm going to idaho on wednesday to drive Cindy and bubba fett back to seattle. So that's something. I got the new outkast, ludacris, and Meat loaf on CD from bestbuy today. Went to the JCPenny and got flannel sheets. It is officially freezing in washington. It snowed this morning around 8am for about half an hour. I was asleep, of course, but I heard about it. There was a birthday party last night. I didn't bring a present:( and I didn't give a present. I did promote our party on the 15th, but that's not saying much. I need a piano or at least a weighted keyboard to practice on:( so much to spend my money on. So little money. Part of me wants to be a contributing part of society, part of me just wants to sit back and make snide remarks. Part of me wants a girlfriend so bad. Part of me wants someone to fuck. Part of me cares so much. Part of me doesn't care at all. Part of me wants a "nice" girl. Part of me wants a girl to tell me how to please her. Part of me wants to be good with the ladies. Part of me wants the ladies to see what's good in me and want to have that. Part of me feels like Charlie Kaufman in Adaptation. Part of me feels like Barry Egan in Punch-drunk love. That is enough for now... Back to Xenocide by Orson Scott Card. Peace-

 Revolutions Can it be that I am not fired up or passionate about any discrepancies that I see? Should I drop everything and change my life? Move away and become a hard worker that has a passion for life? Am I merely asleep at the wheel? Am I dead? Sometimes I wish I had a revolution I could be taking part in. Maybe there is an evil tyrannical man oppressing people somewhere that I could be fighting against. Is there a way I can divert my energy to help people? Instead of sleeping my days away in tired America? Am I too fearful to be passionate? Am I too drowned in debt to try?

 New Years Resolution 3.0 Rev 1 Save 1 night a month for alone time Time will be spent alone in room w/o computer OR Time will be spent alone outside of the house It's almost christmas time and I'm heading to Oregon. I hope everyone has a nice christmas and I'll catch you later. Peace-

 what's going on mikon? So another day, another drachma, Christmas shopping is done, it's so nice to be able to buy presents again this year. New years resolution 1.0: Pay off 1 credit card New years resolution 2.0: Go on at least 1 date every month New years resolution 3.0: Save 1 night a month for housemates/alone time New years resolution 4.0: Read 1 book a month I think that's good for now. I'm going to go check out what's going on downstairs now. Check you later. Peace-

 Party 2nite sorry for freaking out all over you like that. I am a somabitch:) Trogdor was a man, err... maybe he was a dragon man, well, actually he was a DRAGON!!! But he was still TROGDOR!!!! urlLink TROGDOR I hope you all have a nice friday, I really need to go back to work:) Peace- Tim

 true obsession do you know that feeling?... Should I call? Does she like me? Do I like her? Am I playing the game forrectly? Am I suffocating her? Am I enough for her? Am I doing the right thing? Am I just fooling myself until she finds out she doesn't want me? Do I want her? Should I ask her out? Will she say yes? Do I want her to say yes? Should I continue looking? Do I want/need to continue looking? Is there such a thing as a good ending? Who am I? Where am I? What should I be doing? What do I want to do? Inner strugglings... peace- Tim

 Life is beautiful and so are you Well, it's been a while. I decided against remaining in the D&D game. Life is good. Christmas is almost here. I've decided I'm going back to Oregon on tuesday and will be back up here on friday. I just finished "The Tao of Pooh" which talks about Tao-ism and how the characters in Winnie the pooh relate to Taoism. It was very enlightening. Tao-ism seems to be a very go with the flow of life idea, which is what I like about it. Anyway, I went to Trillogy tuesday (all the Lord of the rings shows on tuesday december 16th.) It was pretty good, and I feel like i got my nerd-ness fill for the rest of the year:) Well, gotta run, Peace- Tim

 Nothing to say? So I have 3 days of vacation left. I'm falling behind on my piano work. I want to be an excellent piano player, but it's hard to find the time sometimes. (also hard to make it a priority when you're trying to get through a difficult piece) Anyway, the problem with match.com is that you have to pay to use it. You don't have to pay to put up a profile you just have to pay to email. Of course I'm not sure I'm in a get to know new people part of my life yet. But there's never time like the present. While I'm writing this, I'm listening to urlLink Brak tell it like it is . Work starts in 3 days. So much to do, so little time. should I shave before I go back? Should I pay for match.com or move on to a different service? Should I go into hibernation while I work for a while? Maybe I should just listen to some nice tunes and smoke a bowl:) Peace-

 The "am I a good person?" question I had a friend ask me if I thought they were a good person. Of course I said yes, but couldn't offer any substantial proof. I think the question is more relative than anything. Am I good compared to the next person? Or am I good compared to Charles Manson? Or am I good compared to Jesus Christ of Nazareth? I think before you ask if you're a good person, you need to decide what you're shooting for. Am I good compared to ghandi? Probably not? Being a good person is a daily struggle. You take 1 thing that makes you a good person and I could maybe point out 1 thing that makes you a bad person. There are no good/bad people. There are just people. If you aren't a child molester/rapist/alcoholic/non-motivated/drug addict/constant complainer/murderer/stealing candy from babies person then you're pretty damn good in my book. If people aren't constantly leaving the room when you enter, then you probably have friends somewhere:) Be content to know that you are loved beyond your ability to comprehend. And love your neighbor as yourself.

 What's up? So I have 5 days of freedom left. Not that I'm going to mind work at all. It'll be nice to have something take up my day time hours. Although I may miss the freedom to fo whatever I want I thrive in a work environment, and I really like to thrive. Well, I need to go shower. Peace-

 piano & competition I think that on some level all people want to have a boyfriend/girlfriend that is sought after by others. At least I think attraction partially works due to outside influence. I saw a movie, Iris, where the heroine chose the nerdy guy, I think as a safe bet, partially because she had already had the wild lifestyle she wanted. So that movie actually goes against what I just said, but I think that it is due to the fact that having a greatly desired mate by others is not the only reason people hook up. I think sometimes people get together because they are lonely awnd find someone they can connect with on a deeply spiritual and emotional level, and mutual attraction helps. I blog and match.com, and take my female friends out to coffee. Not such a bad way to live. Well, I need to get ready for my piano lesson. I'll check you guys on the flip side, Peace-

 I slip on it everytime Here I am. I have 10 days of freedom before going back to "the daily grind" which isn't really a grind at all, but it's still work. So I signed up on match.com the other day. My profile is shyguy1177. In case anyone was interested in looking at it. When I was testing out some of the features I accidentally sent a "wink" which says that you're interested in meeting someone. It was just the person at the top of my list. Turns out she has kids living at home. It was a little awkward, me telling some total stranger mom that I liked her. I think if I were testing match.com, I'd have them put in a confirmation or something. Well, I'm off to see the dr. today. Evidentally diabetics' eyes have a tendency to go bad, so I need to go see an eye dr. I hope my new glucometer comes soon. Anyway, enough of my randomness. I'm going to go shower now. Peace-

 personalities I will never know some people. I will never understand other people. I had a friend, Justin. His personality was semi-cruel. I think that's part of it. I don't understand cruel people. But the real question, I guess, is "Do I understand myself?" I have been given a disease that will eventually destroy my body. I've inherited it from my father. I will pass it on to my children. My base root self needs to procreate and I would like to have an heir. I've watched my father disintegrate before my eyes. He will die like Johnny Cash, but hopefully not to soon. I wish I had a love of my life. I am a HOPELESS romantic. I know I could be a good lover. Now all I need to do, is invest a little more time in a lady's life. Well, I'm off to Oregon, Peace-

 vivacity Am I living in teenage angst? Who am I? Have I managed to live myself into a hole? Am I the only one who can find my way out? I met this girl. She's really cute, and awesome to be around. Unfortunately, she has to go away. She inspires me to be more than I am. When I think about her, it makes me want to be a better man. It makes me feel like I've been floating with the current and nothing has challenged me in a long time, nor have I challenged myself. What do all people want? To fall in love with someone, and have that person fall in love with them. Unfortunately then the inevitable happens. Life doesn't end or stand still, it just gets annoying. You never see the "13 years later" in the movies. He's devoted himself to a job that he hates because they have a house they can't afford and she's banging the milk man, since he's at the house more often than her husband. I believe the reason that Romeo & Juliet is such a great love story is because they don't live long enough to fall out of love. My ideal candidate for girlfriend: able to travel up for anything cute not hampered by prejudice not hampered by fear Am I cynical, a realist, or a dreamer? I think a bit of all of these things rolled into a complex little mammal that wishes to procreate:) Today I write to the blackhole of the internet, not knowing if anyone is reading... If you're out there and you're reading this, please email me and tell me hi... peace-

 How YOU doin? I am officially invited back to work:) YAY!!! (*sense of relief washes over Tim*) How about them mariners anyway!!! Details to follow. Peace-

 Scorpios and the like I wish I didn't have to turn off my heart. I wish I could be loving and supportive and not jealous. I wish I was on a similar life journey. I wish I weren't just starting out. I wish I could trust myself to not have an irrational jealousy. I wish I could say, goodluck, I want to hear all the details. I want you to be happy no matter what. I wish I could say, Oh he sounds like quite a catch and not hate him with every fiber of my being. I wish I could stay close intimate friends. I know that my love lasts forever. At least I know it's lasted since 13, and I am prepared to carry love in my heart for another 100 + years of my life. I'd be lying if I said I didn't miss my friends deeply. We are spread out by jealousy and a few oceans. I was asked what I would do if I can do anything I was tonight, no penalties, no reprisals, and the cost is unimportant. What would I do? My answer was the I would call ALL my friends (past & present) and schedule a party at a local restaurant. We would have dinner and chat. I would make sure they knew they could bring their friends and I would make new friends and be able to catch up with all my old friends. Trully, that is what I dream that heaven would be like. Hanging with all the people I've been friends with and just talking and telling stories. Course my life goal is to have people say that I was a good man and a good friend, a good father and an excellent husband. But maybe I'll never know about that. All I can do is be the best man I know how to be, and that means hurting sometimes. Well, I should go to bed and/or practice the piano. Oh, and I got new glasses. Peace-

 all about me So I've been reading through my posts and I began to think what a pathetic guy I must seem like. I can't even handle being alone with myself. It seems to me, I need to spend some time alone. Or at most, just hanging out with guys not even thinking about girls. That would seem like the only logical thing to do, especially if I don't want a rebound relationship. I think it would be best to heal. I mean honestly, I feel as though I should be alone for a while. I don't want to be one of those people that NEEDS to be in a relationship. I want to be the kind of person that if a relationship comes along I can be like, sure, but not strangle it. It's like I would really like to be in love with somebody, but I don't want to just be in love with anybody. Does that make any sense? AKA, I would like to have someone to love, but it DOES make a difference on who that person is. I'm not just going to want to be in a relationship with any ol' girl. I think the healing process requires lots of piano and video games. Maybe even throwing myself into my work for a while. Well, I'm off to practice the piano. Peace-

 good morning I woke up on my own this morning. 7:20am without an alarm and after staying up till 1am.... Well, my tester is officially lost, but I called and ordered a replacement this morning. YAY. Practiced piano last night. I love the piano, it's so fun to just sit there and create music. Well, it's time to work. Peace-

 overall I'm glad to have been in the relationship. She is someone I will forever cherish. Now I need to figure out a way to move it to a friendship. I need to not freak out and not be in love and not rebound.Is there a genie out there that can give me a "no feeling" pill? or a "stop liking that way" pill? Well, it looks like I need to order another test kit from the insurance company. I'm going to bed. Peace-

 meanings I never meant to hurt anyone. I never meant to be hurt. I don't want anyone to be sad, and I don't want to be sad. I want to fulfill and be fulfilled.I want to love and be loved. I want to heal and be healed. I want to take the pain of the world on my shoulders and have no one hurt anymore. I wish I didn't hurt you... OK, enough of the dark ranting. The next time you see me, I'll be a happy camper. well, maybe. peace-

 My last sisterly update unless something terrible happens My step sister seems to be doing much better. Her short term memory is having problems, but she is making great progress considering how close to death she was last week. I'll update you if she worsens :( PEace-

 *sigh* I need to stop. I need to slow down, enjoy the flowers, take moonlit walks, go see a play. I need to get out of the house. I need to move on. I need to not care. I need to tear a little bit. I need to live. I need to breathe. I need to move on. I need to not obsess. I need to let go. I need to go away. I need to cry. I need to hold out. I need to not rebound. I need to sleep. I need to interact. I need to read. I need to engross myself. I need to find passion. I need to be cool. I need to be strong. I need to not cry. I need to be me. I need to grow. I need to be me. I need to find me. I need to not sigh. Torn-

 updates My step-sister is doing better. She is answering questions and can hold conversations ok. When she's not drifting in and out of sleep. I'm doing better. I learning to let go and that's something that is good for me to learn. I hope you all have a beautiful day. Peace-

 on relationships and women So here I am basically coming out of my first serious relationship ever. Overall, I'm glad I had it and am still great friends with the girl. Turning off love is hard though. As a Scorpio, I often get jealous over future boyfriends which is ridiculous. I think mostly I am sad that I cannot be with her anymore. I won't be able to enjoy the journey anymore. I feel like I'm getting left behind. But even as I write that, I think of how I have my own journey to take up. I'm a bit torn. I don't want to give her up, but I also want to move on and start up the next relationship. Mainly I want to fill up the hole in my heart. But I don't want to just have a girlfriend that is a patch. No rebounds. I don't want a rebound. I just want an open honest relationship with no baggage. Then there's the point of, is she easily replaceable? Hell NO! But is there a salve that won't hurt anyone? No. There's the life of the monk, but then she'll feel guilty. There's the life of the party-er, but then I and she will only despise me as a slut. (*would it be easier if I were secretly a jerk that only cared about 1 thing?*) Anyway, I wish God hadn't made women so irresistible :) But I'm glad he did. I'm going to leave you on an up note today, while I try and sleep earlier tonight. So check out this link which is a hilarious account of the urlLink End of the world . (*warning will take a long time to open*) Music: Guster Peace-

 updates My Step sister is doing better. She's been doing some talking and can remember all her children except the one that was born 4 days before her first stroke. She remembers her husband but not the fact that he has been to visit her. Did I mention that I'm back on the market? Well, I guess I am. So, lookout! Peace-

 Life Well the 'rents are in town. So today was VERY filling. Claim Jumper, Sopranoes. It was all yummy. Even made it to archie Mcphees. Anyway, no updates on the step sister as my updates come from my parents and they're up here. So I'm going to go to bed and wake up soon, so I'll catch you later. Peace-

 Sisterly update My mom is on her way up here, but the update goes like this: "Heather responded to the ICU nurse this morning. They did a CAT scan early this morning and found that the original bleeding point in Heather's brain was shrinking down to normal size. The latest bleeding point is still large but the doctor is truly amazed that Heather has responded to the heprin so quickly and the results are better than he could have hoped. Heather remains in ICU and treatment continues." Thank you for your continued prayers and support. Peace-

 what a week Well, it's friday. I left my phone at home. So if you need to get ahold of me today, you need to email. It's just 1 more thing on a list of things that have happened on an ultimately frustrating week. Now I find out I get to have the house to myself pretty much this weekend. Not really looking forward to that. C'est la vie. If you're reading this, email me and say "hi". I can always use a little mid day pick me up. urlLink EMAIL Peace-

 Emotional Rollercoaster of nothingness Well, the latest news being that... "The doctors ordered an angiogram of my stepsister's brain and it revealed several clots. They are starting a regime of heprin (an anticoagulant) and will continue for the next 6 weeks if she continues to live. If things are still working out at the end of that time, they will continue the anticoagulant for another 6 months and, hopefully, the clots will dissolve." That being said, I'm on a bit of an emotional roller coaster right now. I don't know how I feel about my step-sister, except I know I don't want her to die. It's been an emotional week besides that, I've had to give up one of my closest friends and that hurt. Work is work, and it does a good job of distracting me during the day. I hope all is well in your life-

 mortality My mom called to fill me in on the newest member of our family today. It seems my married step sister had her baby last thursday. But that wasn't the news. The news is that my step sister is trying to survive the night. It seems she keeps having strokes (bleeding in the brain). Needless to say, this has put a damper on my day. Maybe I'll throw myself into my work for a while. Peace-

 Personalities, one more time So it seems to me that I appear to be an urlLink INFJ or Introverted INtuitive Feeling Judging personality . It seems to be that I am that person. I feel and judge and seem cold and uncaring. "Indeed, because of their strong ability to take into themselves the feelings of others, Counselors can be hurt rather easily by those around them, which, perhaps, is one reason why they tend to be private people, mutely withdrawing from human contact" Sometimes, I get overwhelmed by the beauty of the world and I retreat. Please forgive me. In other news, I love my job. Peace-

 relationships that last forever So, I have some friend leaving for Vancouver in August. I was recently asked if I'd miss them, and at the moment I was a bit indifferent. Not that I won't miss them horribly, but we're only a phone call or an instant message or email away. In a society of instant messages, cell phones, and email, it's difficult to feel that someone has moved away. I will never turn down a friend. NEVER. I'm not the type of person that would let down a friend. If something is within my ability to do for a friend I will do it. On another note, There's a FUCKIN FLY IN MY ROOM!!! It's like 50 degrees out, and there's a fly in my room! WTF!!!! Anyway, my heart is big enough for all of you. Let me in, let me care and you will never need to wonder if I care. I do, I will, I am. I cannot change who I am, or can I? Time for bed, Time for work, Peace-

 A brief stop in... and then I'm off again. I hope everyone is having a good life. I think I am. I'm getting away for the weekend which will be nice. My job is going wonderfully. I am going in early tomorrow so I can take off early for my weekend away. I wonder if it's time for something new. I'm a wee bit tired, so I'm going to go to bed soon. Thus my scatter brain post. Anyway, I just wanted to make a note that we all wanted to see janet jacksons boobs and fuck those prude assholes for suing everyone. It's a fuckin boob. Half the population has em. Anyway, we're looking for a roommate. Karla has to move out. If you're reading this and want to be an active participant you can email me and we'll see about getting you a room here :P Peace out, my ever loving public-

 You can't handle the truth Here it is, approx. 11 hours before I start my new job and I'm kinda nervous, kinda excited, kinda confused, kinda feel like I should have practiced my piano more this week. Here's a question... how long before you know someone, do you tell them about your blog? I mean obviously there are people you can never tell. (*mothers/pastors/children*) Should you let your friends know your personal thoughts? You online diary? Should you hide it and not let anyone else know? Should you be up front about it, and let them decide if you are worthy of being a good friend by giving them a full picture? Or do you let them only see who you are now? People change. Obviously. But I AM still the man who thinks that cahlen should have said urlLink fuck Wow, my history in a nutshell... put on display for the whole world to read. My friends don't write here anymore. But, I'm not really surprised. We've all moved on, basically. I'm living in an entirely new house, but Cahlen is living downstairs now. Some people that have blogged here, I don't even know anymore. I'm sure as my life moves on... this, too, shall pass. Perhaps I will fall madly in love with someone. Maybe falling madly in love only happens in the movies. :) We'll see, I'll try and keep you posted as the adventure continues... Peace-

 'in love' vs 'love' Trying to move from 'in love' to 'love' is always an interesting experience. Trying to kill the jealous scorpio is tough too. A friend described someone as an emotional basketcase, was/is that me? Is that a valid description of me. Growing and learning to move from 'in love' to 'love'. I need to be able to love a person that I was in love with, without being hurt. I need to not harden my heart. I need to remain emotionally vulnerable and allow myself to grow. A work in progress- Tim

 changing Looking at the last weeks worth of entries, it's very interesting to see who I am now, to the person I was 1 week ago tonight. I definitely seem more emotionally stable right now. Meeting new people helps. Going out at night helps too. Throwing myself into my work helps. Dealing with my feelings helps too. Well, I need to sleep... Peace- Tim

 lookin to chill Hey all- Is it so hard to just chill? I'm looking for someone to just chill and relax with. It seems that most people I know are just looking for the next thing, they don't want to slow down and enjoy the ride. I'm looking to get out of the house, but I want some people that want to get out of the house too. Life's too short to watch TV:) If you're free give me a call and we'll chill... Peace- Tim

 Life as an MMORPG The idea being that you are who you represent you are. You can represent yourself as anything. You can fool anyone into believing whatever you want them to believe, because it's all not real. You are the only one who knows the real you, and you can hide that information forever. You can bluff anything. You can't know anything. We play videogames, but we do seem to be just our brains, and they're just playing who we are as people./ It's not a world I want to live in. I want to be who I am and present myself as me. I don't want to have to fake who I am. I don't want to appear to change me to better represent a compatible person. I do want to be the best me I can be and present that in the most honest person that I am. Just some thoughts on me- Tim

 growing pains So I am standing on my feet now. Walking away from the relationship. "Growing up", if you will. I don't know why I became so needy at the end and I would like to think that I've grown. It seems right now that I will always love you, but I'm sure that is changing right now, even as I write this. I am not looking to get back into a relationship right now, but I am looking for some new people to hang out with. I hope that we can remain friends after this, but I know right now that I don't want to be without you, so that is what I must do. Peace, Tim

 no seriously Moving on sucks. It's like I want to be able to say, you can't hurt me any more. But I also want to try to stay caring and there for when she might need you. Anyway, time to get a jump start on moving on...

 the walled up side There is me as my asshole self. The one that wants to be in this state of uncaring. The one that just wants to say, "FUCK YOU" and run away. Both of me exist in this one body. Now to move on to not caring. Fuck allowing myself to be constantly hurt. Time to move on. Time to hide the caring sensitive side and present the uncaring asshole that protects me.

 Who am I, Who I am... I am an INFJ to the deepest meaning of the word it seems. I will keep you all at arms length. Will you know who I am, besides who I show you? Will I let you see the little boy that will do anything to protect himself from being hurt? No, probably not. There are a million walls to my heart and I can only show you part of it at any one time. Love to me is letting her in. Caring to the point of being utterly destroyed when she dies. Finding a life worth loving and doing everything within my power to love that woman. I will let her see who I am and hope that she can love me for that and will trust her completely to be gentle. Finding a life worth loving and doing everything imaginable to maintain that love. Moving back from love is where I exist in daily life. There are the walls and the disappointment when the person dies, but no personal suffering. Protection from the caring. Protection from the guilt of not being able to give people money to get back on their feet. Protection from the guilt of not being able to care for the most basic of human needs of those in need. Numbness in all that is my life. Approaching on the ability to feel nothing, thus destroying any happiness and any pain. Removing people from my heart is ALWAYS painful. I have found only 1 way. Remove them from my life. Move the walls back in place in my heart. It doesn't work though. I can think of no girl that actually found my love that I have truly been able to remove. My being longs for them to say they love me. To come to me and see the man I will be and love me for that. I long for acceptance with all my being and have never removed a girl from my heart that I have loved. Unfortunately, to date, that means that every girl I have ever loved has been removed from my life, indefinitely. If we hang out, it is never in the capacity that I will allow myself to be seen, not in the capacity that they have known me. I hide behind the walls, because I am truly a little boy that cares beyond my ability and am hurt immeasurably by the smallest pin prick. I'm sensitive, be careful with me, because I'd like to stay that way. I know it makes me a pussy and undesirable by any woman looking for strong offspring, but it is who I am with all my flaws, and it may be the only Tim that I will ever be. Understandably heartbroken- Tim Currently listening to "Mad World" by Gary Jules Currently discussing political issues on " urlLink An Idea Exchange "

 Unsatisfied Good afternoon... I am feeling a little underused, underappreciated, and undersatisfied right now. I should request a meeting to make sure that I'm doing what I should be doing and making sure I am doing an ok job at work. I should have a lobotomy so I can quit desiring, so I can be fully satisfied all the time. Anyway, gotta run, Tim

 In case you were wondering I did get paid. I am going to have buco parties this weekend and I'll see you on the other side. Peace- T-dog

 another day, another drachma Good morning everyone- Well, the countdown continues... will I get paid today? We didn't receive our mail saying our time was approved, but the website says we are. If I don't have my money by noon today, I'll be making some phone calls ;) Anyway, I hope the world is a better place today. I went out and shot pool with Joe last night and today I'm doing a weird work schedule so I can get our of here early. I almost made a live internet video at this urlLink link here . In one scene that looks like it is at night, that is the one in the room I work in. Which brings up the point of, How much light does a human being need? Well, need to look busy, Peace- Tim

 New discussion blog up and running You can get to the new blog urlLink here Hopefully everyone can join and have the fun discussions of today... *hint hint* Peace- Tim

 life and something like it I'm thinking I may starting a new group blog. I would love some help if there's anyone that reads this and would consider doing a group blog with me, let me know and we can start some discussions. No subject will ever be taboo, except of course the issue that was just under discussion. The price you pay for bringing up either my chinese or american heritage as a negative is, I collect your f*ckin head. Just like this f*cker here. Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, NOW'S THE F*CKIN TIME!!! ok, what? Oh sorry a little Oren Ishii quote for you, but please, let's discuss, I have a variety of friends, I'm sure we got some discussing to do. Let me know- Tim

 much better Here I am sunday night. It surprises me the affect that a good conversation can have. I am chipper and am looking forward to the week almost. I have an upbeatness that can last for a while longer as far as I am concerned. I enjoy being in a good to complacent mood so much more than I like being in a depressed state. Well, gotta run. I hope you all are doing better tonight too...

 a bit better I was just wondering how you could know for certain... I don't know if we're supposed to be together, but I do know I want to be together I enjoy your company, you make my life fun, even when I have to work 50+ hours a week Maybe I should move on, get a life, do whatever... I don't know about that stuff, I know that I love you- me

 I'm hurting I hurt... I want to stop feeling... I scream and yell and try with all that is within me for you to hear, but it comes out as a little whisper...

 Some Funny Stuff urlLink Big Store cartoon urlLink Weapon of Choice cartoon

 what is love? It is a feeling. It is a touch. It is trust. It is knowing someone well enough that you should walk away in disgust, but don't. Is it something you grow into? Or something that has to just happen... Can you turn love on and off? Is there a switch that says I could love this person or no? What about growing pains? Are there things to learn from the growing pains? Is there a magic key for becoming the right person? Or are all relationships a work in progress, a commitment to find equal ground? When love fails what is left? A friend, a past love? Do you press on or call it quits? Is there a silver lining? I'm going to bed, I have work tomorrow, Peace- Tim

 OT and the life that's passing by Here I am. Working 11 hour days, well at least one. I want no personal debt to speak of, but I have it in large quantities. So now I must work the mad hours and pay it down. Goal: remove credit cards from my life, be able to go where I want, when I want. So how are you today? I am a bit sleepy, but woke up at 7am almost on the dot. Of course I woke up because I was horny as all hell, but what can you do? Good dreams though. Here I am again, blogging, writing my diary for the world to see. Peter and I, and whoever else at the house that wants to, are going to the new restaurant/bar 1.5 blocks from the house tonight. So that should be fun. Well, off to play some video games... err... TEST some video games... yeah, honestly I can't complain, Peace out- Tim

 jealousy I am so jealous of one of my friends. She has no personal debt to speak of and has a job that she can take vacation days from. I work in an industry that promotes personal debt and punishes for sick days. Things Tim needs to do: 1) Expand my circle of friends. I need a support network in place for life's little tragedys. I have a good circle right now, I just need to diversify 2) Get out of personal debt. From now till my credit cards are paid off, I will buy no more video games, TVs, DVD players, sound systems. I will spend all my extra money trying to pay off my credit cards. I can go see 1 movie in the theater a week, but that is it. 3) give my old clothes to good will or another thrift shop. Time for some spring cleaning. Question: Is it childish to love someone that doesn't love you back? Do you just delay the pain and/or prolong it? Peace-

 up too early? or late? I woke up at 1:30 and haven't been able to get back to sleep. I hope the rest of the world has been sleeping good. Peace-

 frustrated I wish I had someone else to talk to.... I wish I had someone like you that loved me.

 doing better Note to self: research movies before watching trailers. Especially at work. How is everyone doing? Good I hope. So I was reading Craig's list this morning. That is a weird site. Woke up at the crack of 6:48 with my biological clock a ringin'. Silly body, waking up early is for people that work early. Not the rest of us who have to be at work by 9:30. Anyway, it's 9:30 so I'm werkin- Peace

 missing her inside there is a hole where you used to rest, I would long for you and you would come and fill the hole, but now I long and you do not come, you can't come close so the hole can close, and my mind tell's me it's for the best, but my heart still hurts and it wants you, it says she'll fit perfectly, she'll take you away, she'll stop the pain, but it can't be, and i can't tell my heart that it'll be better, it won't hear it, my heart wants you and hurts me that I'm letting go, It says remember her and don't let her go, fight, tell her how much it hurts, but i can't convey that, i don't want to hurt you, i just want you back, but since i can't have that, i want you to be happy, in my cowardly way, I post this to the internet, and those who know can read it, and hopefully it can heal, but sometimes I wonder if it won't just hurt people, I am so sorry, my heart hurts and I need to write it down before i can let it go, I am sorry tearfully-

 So what now? Hey Everybody, ok, I only have 1 confirmed reader, but still I like to include everyone, just in case someone stumbles upon my site by accident. (It happened 1 time, it could happen again) Props to Racheal for finding it:) My life has been changing and staying the same all together. My Piano lessons are going great. I am proving to be a record breaking student. Everything except my project piece is coming along. The project piece should be done by next week. So that's cool. I'm still torn by my love for my ex girlfriend and wanting to move on. Maybe this is one of those growing pains they were talking about. Maybe this is throwing yourself at something so you don't have to deal with the emotional side of things? Maybe this is I have extra money now, so I should buy myself something nice that will help make me feel something? Well, thus ends another uplifting post to the blog... Peace-

 Mama said there'd be days like this So it hits me like a ton of bricks. I am single again. I need to get out of this house and meet some people. I need more friends that I can call up after 9:45 and say, hey, let's go down to the bar and play some pool. I need some buddies that have the same schedule as I are not at home 24/7. I need more single friends:) Well, I need to go to sleep, cause I don't have anyone to party with ;) Peace- Tim

 Sleepy Hey, I can't communicate with you, and so I'm cheating. I'm using a technology that I've known that you check to say that I miss you and hope things are going great for you. I am keeping busy and trying not to thing of how I wish things were different than they are, but I am growing, and that's something that I get to keep from this relationship. My search to be a better man has become partially lit by an amazing woman. Thank you for that. Love- Me

 The stuff that sucks Losing a loved one, via relocation or death. Losing a friend over a disagreement. Losing a friend due to personal feelings. Losing a love due to circumstances beyond your control. Moving to a new city. Removing yourself from a situation that makes you hurt because you care about someone. Becoming strangers. The new make over show, the swan. Stuff that is good Rekindling a friendship lost in time. Moving to a new city. Rekindling a love that was lost, but is now found. Meeting new friends. Dining out. Walks around greenlake. Having my health and beauty. Singing in the shower. Whistling a happy tune. Learning to play the piano. Going out with friends. kissing. cuddling. peace out- Timatao

 The long and short of it Here it is on thursday. There are world events that include hostages, and deaths, and all sorts of bullshit. It seems like I should take an interest in the world around me. For some odd reason I can't see past my circle of friends. I can't help pondering what kind of man I will be. I am back together with my ex *smiles broadly* I need to go. Peace- Tim

 satisfaction So here it is monday morning. I don't know if I'm doing the right thing. But right now I don't care if I'm doing the right thing. I'm just one man doing what feels right. I love and live and learn. God bless- A sinner

 Passion I wish I were more passionate about things in my life. It seems that people are often upset by something they are passionate about and can influence others to become passionate about it as well. I have some empathy, but I think that when it comes to ideas that don't really affect me, I can't really become passionate about it. I think I am an apathetic person living in an apethetic society. I want to feel, to hunger, to thirst, to become enraged, to boil over. I made it to Oregon and I even remembered to blog :) Tim

 Seattle and Oregon I hate Oregon. I hate that it takes me 3 hours to drive there. I hate that I don't have a carpool buddy to get down there with. I hate that I don't have someone to stay home and cuddle with. I hate that Seattle traffic SUCKS. I hate that fandango just broke. Well at least I'm going to go see Hellboy tonight:) Well enough of my ranting... Time for work ;) Tim

 You are my sunshine, my only sunshine, you make me happy, when skies are grey, you'll never know dear, how much I love you, oh please don't take my sunshine away

 I got a phone call from the east coast today. I think it may be for a job I applied for over there. I have a date with a Taurus tomorrow night. From what I've read, she'll be very rooted. This is about as polar opposite from my ex as you can get. I'm not sure where this is going, but I'm reading the Te of Piglet and trying to live each day as it comes. Terminally lost in confusion- Tim

 I just wanted to say thanks to all the beautiful people in my life. I don't often recognize my friends as how cool and special they are. I am truly blessed to know you. Thanks- Tim

 I know I tend to overthink almost everything in my life. Today I was thinking about which is better, to underthink or to overthink everything. As an overthinker, I tend to think that is good, but there's also a point when you need to stop thinking and start doing. However, I do like to live spontaneously, whenever possible, and try not o read too much into anything. Also, sometimes I prefer NOT to overthink something. Thinking can become tiresome. Anyway, here's a cute rant about urlLink 10 aphrodesiacs Peace- Tim

 Someone showed me this last year on Craigslist. It's one of the nerdiest, funniest things ever. You gotta love cyber-sex :P urlLink Tasty

 I try to understand, to contemplate, to see through the darkness, to see the light, to see the fright, I want to see what is to come, to know who to be, to know where to go, to live life like there's no tomorrow, to see what cannot be seen, to touch that which is withheld, to see potential in everyone, to know the people of my life. I am here, lost in my sea of uncertainty, no knowing left from right or up from down. Everywhere I look I see gray where there was once black, I see gray where there was once white. I know there are things to do for free, but this is where my muse leaves and takes the ideas with her... So I ask my friends, there are some good ideas, the problem mostly being that everything costs money. There is ALWAYS gas involved, and gas costs money. Sometimes there is beer involved, and beer costs money. How do you start seeing someone else when you still have feelings for another? I've heard that feelings for the other will never really leave though... Well, I'm off- Tim

 So I've been following the rants of raves section today. So far the main subjects have been, grocery cards, God and natives vs. transplants. urlLink rants & raves in seattle / tacoma It's just funny to me, how much of my day that I spend at craigslist, and how sad it is that everyone gets so worked up over these things. urlLink Best of craigslist is pretty good!

 I've often wondered why more people don't blog. and have had this answered in many a different way. I think my job/personality are in a unique place where I have time to blog and it fulfills part of my need to socialize. Blogging gives me a way to get my random thoughts of Tim out of my head and onto the internet. I use my blog as a way to socialize with my friends, especially when the job takes up more than it's fair share of my time. I think if I went out more and wasn't sitting in front of a computer for 8+ hours a day, then I probably would not blog as much. I don't know. Sometimes I feel like a blogger, sometimes I don't. Maybe this was that muse I was talking about? Peace- T

 don't see "Head of state" Seriously, I was trying to think of a worse movie, and I couldn't. Anyway, I'm exhausted, so I'll talk to you later today Peace- T

 It's too bad we only have but one life to live. It seems that it would be nice to experience life at all the different "beautiful" levels. I mean they all suck in their own little ways: Beautiful people are always being hit upon by everyone. So they become more and more jaded by the people they know, especially if they date other very attractive people. It seems that most un-attractive people would date attractive people and love them, but an attractive person would become attracted to someone that is not attracted to them, thus creating an interest in why that person isn't interested in them. The attractive people will often find themselves in unhealthy relationships due to their constantly falling in love with people that aren't attracted to them. For un-attractive people, or even socially challenged people there's can be a more worthwhile struggle: Instead of having to fend off suitors, they must deal with the constant barrage of rejection. They must constantly bring themselves back from the rejection and try and try again. They more easily learn that beauty is in the eye of the beholder and that they ust be willing to compromise for love. They struggle everyday with either trying to find love, or maybe giving up and trying to find other things to fill that void. (See video games) The cute people I think have the best and worst of both worlds. The arrogant beautiful people not giving them the time of day, and rejecting them. The non-attractive psychos stalking them. And their want to find someone attracted to them, that they too are attracted to. In the Te of Piglet, I read that a man had 2 wives, a plain one and a beautiful one. The story goes that a traveller came and stayed with the man and by the next day came to realize that the beautiful wife was left ignored, while the plain one was treated with honor and affection. When the traveller asked the boy of the household why. He replied "The beautiful one knows that she is beautiful; the plain one knows that she is plain." The moral being to put away your pride and act upon your Virtue. I don't know if I'm explaining this very well as I'm trying to form my opinions based off what I'm reading right now, but I think the gist is explained. And in case you were wondering, yes, I am cute :) Lost but in peace- Tim

 Enjoy'd this article, thought I'd share it: urlLink Men online: why we are the way we are

 I went out to an puget sound waterfront house on saturday night. We drank and ate and played scattergories. Sunday was spent lounging at Seattle Center watching the kids run around in the fountain. It was a really nice and relaxing time. I wrote some in my journal but basically chilled with new and old friends all weekend. It was suprisingly relaxing and easy going. I was supposed to see "Super size me" yesterday, but I wanted to hang at the seattle center instead. I'll see it someday, in the mean time, I'll keep eating at McDonalds :) Peace- T

 I'm at work this week. I don't know what I feel anymore. I can't tell who I am, or who I want to be. I know that I am ok with that. I know that I will be fine and don't need to know anything. I met some really cool people this weekend. So that's nice. floating- Tim

 I think that I would not like to be a woman. I mean, it seems to me, that women, at least the ones I know, always have ex-boyfriends that won't fall out of love with them. I've always thought that women would be the ones that would fall in love more often, but it seems that my circle of friends is the exactly opposite. I've found that it's mostly girls that would rather not be under the commitments of a relationship.=, where most men I know would rather be in a committed relationship than a string of one night stands. It seems that I read a book recently, Tao of Pooh or Te of piglet? Where the author was explaining how women are no longer treated like ladies because the womens rights movement sought to do away with any mistreatment of women. I don't know why I mention it, but it seems that women are more like the men of yesteryear, and men are the sensitive guys that women always said they wanted, but didn't really. I'm sitting here lost in a sea of uncertainty- Tim

 I HAVE been trying to not have these feelings for my ex. I know that I need to move on. It's not like I can choose to fall out of love, just as much as she can choose to fall in love. But I AM trying. I know sometimes it seems like we're back at square 1. Sometimes I think I have left my feelings for her in the past. I do want to find someone who will fall in love with me, but I'm having trouble. I think I don't have time for a relationship right now. I just need to make my priorities. Anyway, I wanted to let everyone know that I AM trying. Peace- T

 urlLink this is me&nbsp; urlLink

 I just found out that I'm a snake. Well that I was born in the year of the snake. So that's fun:) Check it out: urlLink The Year Of The Snake Peace- Tim

 So I'm really enjoying reading documentation today. It's good to stay caught up on what all is going on in the product I'm testing. Things are slow... things are good... the beer fridge is moved back by me:) Peace- Tim

 So I just had this thought. Maybe the Puritans were all scorpios that were all just jealous of being scorned, so they decided sex was bad. I think I lucked out by being more liberal even though I AM a scorpio. I dunno, I could see how people that were really jealous, could just make a blanket statement that nudity is bad. I have no idea what I'm talking about. Peace- T

 maybe I was wrong Maybe I don't know anything about love. Maybe it is all an illusion. No hay banda, there is NO band. Maybe all anyone can ever know is the feelings they have. Maybe they're right, you can only find love once you stop looking. Maybe they're the people that think I'm a "nice" person, but not the "date"-able type. About as exciting as a wet sponge? At least I try. I have THAT going for me. I know a lot of people that don't even do that. My pomade smells good. Peace- T

 a bit of history I found urlLink this rant by accident today. It's an interesting look at my sexual frustration from 2002 and where I was at, as a human being. Peace- T

 scorpio love patterns I found this to be interesting. It's basically what signs the scorpio find compatible and what not: "You have an all-or-nothing approach to relationships, therefore you do not match up to all the signs. Here's a look at how you do interact with others. SCORPIO & ARIES: - You make a hot combination in bed. Highly aggressive sex that could be described as implied violence. Lustful but not lasting due to your jealous nature. SCORPIO & TAURUS: - Polar opposites that actually do quite well together. The Bull is stable and loyal enough to satisfy your intense nature. You both value long-term unions and are willing to work at them together. SCORPIO & GEMINI: - This is not a likely match, the Illusive, fickle Gemini will drive you to distraction, which in turn could bring out your vengeful side. SCORPIO & CANCER: - This is one of your best connections. The Crab is a loyal mate who is usually willing to stand behind you. Cancers are attracted to your strong, demanding ways. SCORPIO & LEO: - This connection can lead to crimes of passion. Although you are strongly attracted to the Lion, Leo's flamboyant, flirtatious nature will cause anger that could erupt into murder-suicide. SCORPIO & VIRGO: - The Virgoan has difficulties with your sexual leanings. You will bore easily and move on to more passionate partners. SCORPIO & LIBRA: - This is not the best match. Libra is far too good looking and easy going for your jealous nature. You would likely end up spying on this social butterfly. SCORPIO & SCORPIO: - Sexually you are truly compatible, however out of the bedroom you are far too much alike -- creating problems and mind games. You will always think that the other is having an affair. SCORPIO & SAGITTARIUS: - This alliance is a waste of time for both parties. You are a homebody and the Archer is a travel nut. This is not a likely attraction. SCORPIO & CAPRICORN: - This is a wonderful partnership. You both have the same values and cherish your home environment. Mentally and physically you match up well, easily satisfying one anothers needs. SCORPIO & AQUARIUS: - Why bother. This will never work due to the Aquarian's need for freedom and your need to possess. Your values, ethics and approach to life are just too different. SCORPIO & PISCES: - This is not bad. Probably the most erotic sexual combination. The Fish is willing to be a part of your whims and desires, and that makes for a lasting union. "

 Looking to be bad I feel like being bad. Drinkin' and smokin'. Who wants to come?

 The Honeymoon period I am confused by this statement. What does it mean to be in a honeymoon period? I understand the whole, in love with someone that you don't really get along with. But I have seen people that I thought would never be together in the long run, continue to make choices to stay together. They're obviously no longer in the honeymoon stage. It's just weird, maybe I haven't had a honeymoon stage, or maybe it's that I self protect. I dunno if any of this makes any sense. I need to work. Peace- T

 Frustration So it turns out that I hadn't actually applied for the job at bioware, Alberta, BC. It seems as though my outlook was waiting for me to sign in again so it could send the application. I signed in last night, 3 days after the deadline for the job. Anyway, I'm really frustrated by that, as I think it would at least have been a good interview opportunity. C'est la vie. Another day, another 42.50. Peace- T

 On Oregon, homes, and Desire I often find that when I am at home, I have too much time to think. It is actually that I have time to reflect on what is important in my life as all of my distractions/problems are in Seattle. My home My parents want me in Oregon. They say that the job market is better, that rent is cheaper. They say that even if I move home I won't have to see them very much. They don't understand that it's not that I don't want to see them. It's that I don't want to live in Oregon! It's something of a love/hate relationship I have with the place. I sometimes love to visit there, but for the most part I LOVE living in seattle, or maybe it's just that most of my friends are up there? Maybe there is some sort of defeatist attitude I have about moving back home to the parents. *sigh* My muse My muse is back. I haven't missed her one bit. It seems that she only comes to me when I am heartbroken or in some sort of emotional dilemma. At least this muse is like that. I had another muse that taught me cool things like expanding my mind and learning to knit, but this muse is the old faithful "bad poetry" muse! This muse likes to torment me into writing from the longings of my soul and betrays my trust at every step of the way. She'll have me show these works of "poetry" to people I barely know and they may, for a moment or two, understand me. Desire I've come to the point in my life where I can be honest with myself and realize that I have desires. I want to be respected. I want to be loved. I want to love unabashedly. I want to quench the thirst of love in another, and have my thirst quenched in return. I desire the fruit of a woman. I long for sleeping in. I wish to be held. I long for cuddling. I desire to be known. I seek the human condition in all it's forms. I want the human experience. I long for understanding. I seek the treasure of our human experience. I hope to reprioritize my life, to make important all that is important and to disregard that which is not. Priorities, lies, and the news I have been reading the Te of Piglet and have at least mildly learned some of it's truths, which I have lived in understanding with for a long time, but have not practiced! The real hypocracy is that my senior year of college I wrote about the importance of non materialistic endevours, but knew full well I was pursuing a career that celebrate commercialism! Anyway, I know that I cannot buy happiness, no matter what the media tells you. In fact that whole idea of marketing is a lie! The idea that you NEED something, simply by running an ad on TV you can almost guarantee, no matter how worthless your product, someone will buy it! I want to give up TV. I know it wouldn't be hard. I hardly ever watch it as it is. I noticed on the news tonight, (Staying with Parents) that the news is actually just a stressor that we've added to our lives. It has no GOOD quality what-so-ever! It mostly just brought news of murder, rape and theivery, that I personally could do nothing about! How is that an important thing to me? I missed Seattle's volunteer day. I had to go to oregon. I want to give back to society to feel like I am an active member of our society and I'm having trouble finding ways in. Well, it's 12:30, I need to sleep, Peace- Tim

 Of Mice and men Did you ever read the book or see the movie? Sometimes I feel like the retarded guy. Lenny? It seems that whenever I find something soft and beautiful, through no fault of my own, I strangle it. Most of my relationships often end because I don't give enough space. I am reading the Te of Piglet and see a bit of overanalysis in my life. Can you see it too? Peace- T

 Luv I just got finished watching "Something's gotta give" for the second time. I thought it made an interesting point about love. The point being that without opening yourself up to being hurt, you never experience love in it's most pure/best form. Looking back on my relationships I wonder how much I may have held back or had held back from me. Good times can be fun, but I'm looking for love. I want the emotional side. I want a girl that I can say, "Have you met my girlfriend?" about. I want to be able to trust someone and be open with them. I want to be her desire. I don't want to be scared of opening up and having it thrown back in my face. I know that I can be anyone and do anything with my life. I know that I AM comfortable with who I am. I also know that I get bored at night when I don't have anyone to do anything with. I'm damn responsible, and I'm fun to hang with. One thing I've always felt about love is, that you can only give love and hope that it is returned. You cannot buy love or force someone to love you. Part of who I am is based on this notion of love. When I love someone, I try to make myself available to them whenever they may need me. Which often means that I fall for people who are a little sad, because I can help them be happy. I think that maybe I see myself as only useful for when people are going through tough times, so when times are flying high, I feel awkward. I'm not sure how much of this last paragragh is true, but they are thoughts that I'm having, so I'll leave them for the people of the web to read. I'm in a blogging mood, thanks be to Oregon, Peace- Tim

 Too hot to handle Here I am in sunny Oregon, and we're going to be watching movies. I don't want this to happen to me. When does the relationship change from active to passive? Was there ever any active relationship? How does one get to the point where the TV and movies have replaced the "go out and do things together"-ness of america? I recall at one point being the slave to the TV. I don't want to be there again. I want to live through my active relationships. I want to be known as the guy that didn't just sit down and watch life go by. He was the guy who was always out doing stuff. Hello, future life, can I have you today? Peace- T

 Oregon blogging So I'm in Oregon, and since I have the time to think while I drive down and up, that usually means it's time to blog! I'm thinking of selling my car and surviving on the kindness of strangers and our metro system. When will my mere words become action? When will piglet come forth and grow? Is there a God? This is the Tim of Oregon, signing off. Peace.

 Thank God for moms So I'm at this weird 'what to do with my life?' point of my life. I applied for a job at urlLink Bioware in alberta canada. I think I would like the change of pace that alberta would give me, although I would miss my friends. I woke at 4:45 this morning with a panic attack and called my mom who talked to me till about 6:30. I'm sleepy now. I have tomorrow and friday off and am looking forward to a much needed vacation. I hope that everyone is doing well. Catch you on the flip side- T

 one pint, two pint, all my problems gone 0 pints: worries about: girlfriend job car father 1 pints: worries about: father car 2 pints: worries about: will I win this game of pool? it's 1:42 signing off after 2 pints, Peace- T

 Hey Everyone- I'm working on my C# skills now. I have hope again of becoming an SDET and maybe even a full on SDE someday, but for now, I'm working on my C# skills. I'm kind of stoked about it. I'm still running every other day and am losing weight, so that is good. I'm still looking for a place to live, but my schedule at work has been throwing wrenches into the housing search. I wish I had time to program at work, but for now, I'm going to run some more automation stuff. Peace- Tim

 As I walk up to you, I start to think of rivers, I think of waterfalls and places with brooks and forests, I look down to make sure everything is pointed in the right direction, I avoid eye contact to the man on my right, I'm nervous, you are reluctant, Then relief, my body sighs, I am empty I retreat to wash my hands. Peace- T

 OH sun, how do I miss thee, let me count the ways, I miss thee in the morning, while I'm at my desk regressing, I miss thee at the lunchtime, when the cafeteria is loud, I miss thee mostly in the evenings, when I'm back in the room of no windows, I miss thee because my job is to stay indoows while you are out. Missing the sun, and rain, and all things that are natural. From my dark manufactured office where I spend 14 hours a day. Peace- T

 So I was thinking about how our parents love us. We can never fully reciprocate that love as we will never feel the same hope for a future as our parents see in us. Your parents put all their love and hope in you, which becomes suffocating. You have to flee the nest and they hope that you make them proud. When love is not a 2-way street it becomes burdensome and irritating. Well, time to work. Peace- T

 I'm going to pick up Cliff from the airport tonight. I don't know if I should tell him that I went running this morning. I feel like I cheated on him a little ;) Well, I woke at 6:00am this morning, as well as numerous other times of the night. My alarm was set for 6:45. So I ran around greenlake and got home by 7:30ish. Not a bad way to start the day :) I spent 9 hours here yesterday. That was "nice" and I may be doing OT again next weekend. We'll have to see. Peace- T

 It's 1am, and evidentally I don't need sleep. Although I am exhausted, I can't seem to fall asleep. It could be do to the sweltering heat, or the fact that I just got home from a rowdy night of board games. I need to figure out what I'm doing in my life. I know I am a hard worker, and can excell at any given task, it's just I need to decide what that task will be. Also, I need to decide if I want to sell my car. Well, now is not the time to decide these things. I'm going to bed. Peace- T

 Here I sit in my safe little house. Far from Terrorist threat. Far from any danger really. I mean, I'm a 26 yr old man that lives in a fairly safe residential area of Seattle. There aren't many people that would come attack me or go on a killing spree in my neighborhood. At least I don't think so. Anyway, this world is pretty messed up. I mean, I live in a world of car accidents and dentistry, when half way around the world, they're beheading people to try and get other murderers out of prison. How is it that you think kidnapping people will get your leaders to be released? I mean, I guess terrorist is a good name. You think that using the terror of what you'll do will cause people to do what you want? Or are you even trying to get people to convert to your religion? Or is it merely a reason to kill? I realize that I don't understand you. Sometimes I wish I could talk to you and make you understand love. Peace, from a man in turmoil- T

 So it was the same temperature in my room this morning as when I went to bed last night. Which means I slept with no covers on all night and didn't get cold at all. I am SO looking forward to moving to a cooler room. OK, well I need to go work now. Peace- T

 My friend recently told me about a friend of hers who is getting married. It seems that the guy wanted to marry her after the 3rd date, but that freaked her out. So he cooled things off and she eventually came around. Things like that make me wonder if I should give up or go down fighting, especially if a girl is like, "I don't know". I often will disappear for a time and then come back and see what's up, but that NEVER works out. When you cut off communication it's a lot easier to get over someone. You quit thinking about them and caring as much. Anyway, I think it's funny that he was ready to get married way before she was, and that she was able to be won over. Or maybe she just got freaked because she thought it should take longer. Or maybe because she wasn't ready to settle down yet. Or maybe because she thought he wasn't the ONE. Or maybe because she felt something better might come along. I have no idea why she didn't want to get married, but now she does. She may be tohe only person that knows the true feelings. But it's kind of romantic. Anyway, I need to work on writing my short story/autobiography of the early years. Peace- T

 If there is a God, then I think the religions may have it all wrong. I think that God must have created woman first. I think they(God, genderless plural) must have taken the bottle of beauty and the bottle of Grace and poured almost the entire contents into woman. Then when they saw what a great job they'd done, they decided to make man. But they didn't have as much beauty or grace to use on the second model. So they made up for it with fat and muscle and clumsiness. This ended up with the male model so prevalent in today's society. Anyway, I was thinking about that as I was walking home from the park tonight and thinking about out more fair, pleasant looking sex. I think that's all I have to say about that. Peace- T

 So I didn't go running this morning. I'm moving xboxes around all day and will need my strength for lifting and walking. I just found out my step sister is pregnant again. This'll be her 5th, but now my other stepsister won't be able to catch up (since she had the whole blood clot thing last birth). DRAMA!!! Well, nothin much new in my life. Just busy with work and reading and writing. Peace- T

 OH my GOD!!! It hurts to walk, and it hurts to breathe. So I'm just going to sit here and not breathe. If that doesn't work, I'll just 'walk it off' as coach used to say. Day 2 of running around greenlake has proven to me that I should have never stopped running as I am completely sore after today's 2.8 jog. Well, 3 more days and then I'll take the weekend off. I started eating salads for lunch. Yesterday's rang up at 1.95 and it was totally yummy. We'll see how today's goes. Peace- T

 So my whole buy shoes plan failed miserably today. But I have made some plans. I'm going to start running with Cliff in the mornings and try to stick to a salad lunch plan. I bought atkins bars for my snacks today. So I should be able to survive on the salad lunch, until dinner. But I need to go to sleep now as I have to get up at 6:45 :P I hope everyone is doing good and I'll try and write soon. Peace- T

 So I'm hopefully going to be getting new shoes tomorrow. I would very much like to get new shoes as the ones I have right now have holes in the soles. I've had some insights recently that I've been wanting to share with my general public but I've been busy, so here it goes. Insight #1: Most jerk men aren't jerks to the women they're courting. In fact, some jerks will not be jerks to the women in their lives, just to other men. However, for some it will eventually shine through to all their relationships, no matter how much they care about others. Insight #2: Some people don't care about anyone outside of themselves. This goes for most people, I presume, but it is still a bit surprising for me. Insight #3: Birth and Death are all relative (and death is much more lonely than birth). Today I had dinner with 2 pregnant women and 1 woman knocking on death's door. The woman that is close to death was scary to look at and see what the future held for us all. I don't know what I'm trying to say, except that it was a very interesting lunch with an interesting crowd. Insight #4: to get rid of skid marks, a man must shave his ass. (I actually found this out by reading craigslist a long while ago, but have yet to test it) OK, I'm going to go to sleep- Peace- Tim

 I just wanted to give a shout out to all my adoring fans. I've been busy working this week, so my updates have been few and far between. For that, I apologize.... I have been taking the bus home, while I still have my bus pass. The powers that be have decided that contractors who have always gotten the bus pass privilege will now be denied. Another way to keep the separation of FTEs and CS. Sometimes I just want to run through the halls yelling, "CS are people too!!!" But I'm sure that would get me fired. We're hoping that Mike's kid doesn't come tonight, we're getting him the hunger team aqua force season 1 DVD. Well, I'm sleepy, catch ya later- T

 I keep getting spammed with all these "Find your true love here" emails in my junk mail folder. I think that there's probably a lot of money out there to be made off singles that are so socially awkward they're paying a website to help them find a match. (OK, OK, I have done the eharmony stuff in the past) I don't know what I'm saying, maybe that there's lots of single folks out there and if they were out having fun, they might meet each other, instead of sitting at home in front of their computers... But really I'm just full of shit... Peace- T

 For some reason I am not tired this morning. I had some weird dreams last night. I dreamt that I emailed Cassie and they were like, Tim I'm sorry, but I've been dating someone for the past month or so. It was so weird cause the email was just like, hey how's it going? Anyway, I went to bed at 11:45 last night and today I'm surprising refreshed. Although I did wake up several times last night from bad dreams. The one above and another one. Anyway, I need to get to work. Peace- T

 I've killed the ponderingpool.blogspot.com I think everyone was tired of writing, and it didn't blossom into anything beautiful, so I had to put it down. I don't think I'm getting enough sleep at night. I know I'm exhausted right now, and should sleep, but my room is SO hot!!! :P Anyway, I had some more to rant about, but I forget. Too hot, too tired. Peace- T

 Well here it is, monday morning. I'm sleepy. My weekend was very busy. The Harry Potter movie was good. I'm starting to read my next book, "Lightning" by Dean Koontz. Interesting quote in the book, "Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength; wile loving someone deeply gives you courage." - Lao Tzu Anyway, I should get back to work, sleepily- tim

 Love can give you the ability to do the things you never thought you could. Love is able to have you take chances and give flight to new ideas more readily than any other form of hypnotics or drug. Love makes you want to be someone that is an image of what the person you love wants. Love can inspire you to learn a foreign language or take up scuba diving. Love can take your fears and throw them out the window. Love is such an awesome thing.

 I met my friends nate and kara and Dave G for dinner tonight. I haven't seen Nate & Kara for about half a year. This is something I am working on reversing. Anyway, I started putting my "new" computer together last night. So that was exciting. My parents are coming into town tomorrow and then I'm going paintballing on saturday with Jarred. I've been able to keep my life pretty busy. I think part of it may have to do with the fact that I'm trying not to slow down and feel too much. A friend recently told me that scorpios are moody and/or have mood swings. I could see that. Anyway, I'm sleeping- T

 So here I am writing again. I don't know what's going on in me. I have been here before, or have I? I have a strange sense of wandering again, but also of soul searching and longing. I recognize myself and think of who I want to be and who I want to help. I am re-arranging myself to be financially more stable. All this thinking is fun, but I think I should start reading again. I've started walking home from my boss' house everynight, so that is good exercise. (30+ blocks or so) I want to get in better shape, but I think I need to find someone to inspire me to get out a little more often, and maybe take up jogging with me. We'll see. Anyway, I'm sleepy, catch you later- T

 I am currently looking for a playmate to help get me out of the house. I would like to find a friend that is willing to go out, even late at night. Someone that I could call whenever I felt like it and she wouldn't feel perturbed. Preferably someone that is cute. Someone that can keep up an intelligent conversation and will call me on my bullshit. Help me expand my horizons and teach me a thing or two. I'm audi 5000- T

 Another Craigslist best of. I really enjoyed the Truths this article revels in. urlLink The Truth about Blind Dates

 I had a spectacular weekend. I think I did everything new under the sun. I went to folklife and watched belly dancing. I went to a concert and had some black russians. I went to Golden Gardens and walked around. I went to a dog park and watched the dogs play. I saw a movie, Supersize Me. I ate some pho and some Mr. Lee's Asian Restaurant. I went to Alki Beach and walked to boardwalk. I took multiple photos. I talked to Jay about a short film entitled "rejected". My friend left for Hawaii today. She is going to see her sister and was going for the birth of her neice which happened a month early, yesterday. I think that would be frustrating. Well, I'm sure she'll have fun and now I have to work again. Lost in my sea of uncertainty- Tim

 I'm talking to a friend about types. She dated someone who prefered a 'type' that is complacent and would believe everything he said. I can't figure any man that is threatened by a woman who thinks for herself?!?! Why would you want that? I don't understand wanting to mind fuck someone or just not be challenged when you're making a dumbass move. Why would you not want to consistently improve yourself? Anyway, I think I need to go catch up on some sleep. (Work: 10 hours today, 9 hours tomorrow) Goodnight- T

 I just wanted to say hi. I am going to sleep as I have to wake up at 6:30 for running and I want to get at least 1 more hour of sleep than last night. But I wanted to share urlLink this link to a pretty awesome website, so you can all enjoy. Catch you on the flip side of the work monster... T

 I'm back at work, only 8.5 hours after I left!!! I did get 5.5 hours of sleep last night, so that is good. I actually AM feeling refreshed! How weird is that? Anyway, I haven't been good with the emails recently, so if you've written and I haven't written back, please be patient. (I swear this work thing won't last forever!) Peace out- T

 I love that I get to meet people from all over the world on here. I just wanted to let you all know that. Also, what's up with Uberskinny peope being hot. I'm sorry, but if you're all bones, that is no good. There should be some meat on the package. Also, I'm exhausted and need to go to bed. Also, I'm still horny :( Peace- T

 I think it's humorous the cycles people can get in. But the question isn't whether people get in cycles, the question is, Can people change the cycles they're in, once they recognize them? I know my step sister has a tendency to get pregnant everyother year, and that after she becomes pregnant, she ditches the father and goes back to church. Once the baby comes, she wants hardly anything to do with her other children... and starts sleeping with men again to become pregnant. Repeat My question is, Do I sabotage my own relationships by opening up too little/opening up too much/opening up too quickly? Do I sabotage my relationships by wanting too much? Trusting too much? Trusting too little? Do I over analyze everything? I know I should just enjoy life and not think anything about my relationship, go with the flow (go with aunt flo?) online peeps I think it would be silly for me to try and hide who I am on my blog.&nbsp; I&nbsp;try to be as open an honest here as I should be in the real world. I often wonder if I am too blunt, or too raw. Part of the problem with knowing people read the blog is I may want to cover some feelings up, or censor my blog. I can't do that. I don't have the energy to hide myself from the blogging community, so please be patient with me, as I do have some prickly edges... Time for sleep, Peace- T

 Hey all- I am exhausted and in a place that I don't sleep very well (my bedroom == HOT). Anyway, I just heard from my friend Adam who just got back from Iraq and may be making his way back up to Seattle this weekend to visit!!! YAY for alive friends!!! I hope this message finds you all well and having too much fun... Peace- T The "Tired and going running in 7 hours" Man

 Well, my body decided to wake up at 6:00 this morning :P For those of you in the know, that means I got almost 6 hours of sleep last night. I've been thinking about relationships recently. It seems like I'm fairly good at destroying them, even when I think that it's where I want to be. (see pushing away) Along with relationships comes the idea of how people meet. In college I fell in love with 1 girl because she shared her poetry with me, when she would show it to no one else. I totally fucked up that relationship :P What about the blogs? Are they a good way to meet people? You deal with peoples inner most thoughts on here, maybe something they never tell anyone in RL. They could be completely socially dipolar, but you may never know. They could be the best thing since sliced bread. Trust is a funny thing. Am I being cynical? I don't know. I should go back to bed... Peace- T

 So a bit of randomness... Cable internet got installed yesterday. It kicks DSL's ass up and down the street. I worked 13 hours today. So I'm a big loopy. I wish there was another reason I was loopy, but it just seems to be sleep related :) I find it interesting that it's about 70 degrees outside and can remain 80+ degrees in my room. I want to save money, but I get this overwhelming sense that I should spend it too. No shopping therapy for this boy. I am going to save it for my rainy days ahead. I want to run tomorrow, but my running buddy is away, and I need to sleep after today's long hours. Meeting new peeps is fun. Being a dick at work is not. Exhaustedly yours- Tim

 It seems to me that people either blog, or they don't blog. Those that don't blog often have a tendency to see blogging, not as a social forum or peoples random opinions,&nbsp;as something that is time consuming that has little to no reward in the here and now world of the day to day. I have often become a non blogger for months at a time, but I have always kept this site up. Occasionally I update it, but only when I have no/little social opportunities with my friends. I reach out to my blog and post in the realization that no one is reading it. Until they got the profiles where you can search for people with blogs with similar interests. I've now had 3 people leave messages in the past 4 weeks. It's an odd feeling to be found on the internet. Besides my friends, I'm sure no one had really read it until a few months ago. It seems maybe that I should filter it and look through and delete any posts that I have grown through or out of, but that would be faking my past. I would hate that. Anyway, here's to random people stopping by my website and new friends. I hope you like what you see! Peace- T

 I love free soda. I get the hankering and I just have to walk down the hall to my friendly kitchen and grab me some nutrasweet loving. Time for work, peace- T

 It's amazing how we can get caught up with who we want to be with, before deciding who we are. I think that you can not change who you are so much than to grow to be someone else. The point being that being comfortable with who you are, and respecting yourself will make you attractive to others(love wise anyway) Sometimes I think I am a total asshole that nobody would like (work has a way of turning you into the enemy when you'd just as happily surf the internet like your compatriots) or a "nice" guy that nobody wants to sleep with. I know that I'm a nice guy, but I have a tendency to at least try to hit rock bottom as Chuck would say. I'm torn between the slacker that I could be and the responsible man/boy that I am. I know that I'm cute, but I never come off as overly confident when talking to women, which I KNOW is not a turn on. It's the great mystery. Wanting sex, but playing at that you don't want it. I do miss sex. Masturbation just isn't the same as getting it on. I know that not all of you might realize this, but I have lost that sacred virginity thing a while ago :O Anyway, it's not like I'm looking at just wanting sex. It's the whole relationship that would be nice. I want to be desired and fulfill that desire in someone else. Please note: In case you can't tell I'm still working 70/hr work weeks and have NO time to pursue a full on relationship. As I thought of it tonight, my life is a big canvas of grey, where I have no need to leave work, but I see the rainbow at the end of the tunnel and long for that day when I'll have my accrued earnings and no job:) Here's to new friends and old enemies- Peace- The T

 Is it ok to NOT use your talents? Should you always use the talent that you have in for a job if you can? I think the subway guy might want to hire me, and I think I would have a lot less stress in that sort of job, but I wouldn't be using any of my 1337 h4X0r skills like I use here? I think part of the dilemma would be that I'm not full time here, but subway isn't quite a career type workplace. I don't know, I'm going back to work. Peace- T

 I'm going running and it seems like just 6 hours ago I was crawling into bed all sleepy like. Damn you HOT room and damn you lack of sleep. I'm going running! Ha body, that'll show you! Peace- T

 So I just showered and&nbsp;my ass is urlLink clean Just thought you all might want to know ;) G'night- T

 When you have a subject for blogging and then you forget it right when you're about to start. I think I was going to mention about how I found this website: urlLink Being friends And how it has a fairly easy (step by step) from going from lover to friend. So I was thinking of trying to follow those hints... There was also this website: urlLink Love handles Which has to do with strengthening the love handles. So I was thinking of trying out that as well. I think it's interesting that both articles are mostly talking to women. Is it that I'm so feminine or that I have my sensitive male side thing going on. (metrosexual? Am I a crab person?) Anyway, I'm running at 7 am tomorrow, I need to sleep. Peace- T

 urlLink I should go blue again&nbsp; urlLink

 urlLink At work! I'm SUCH a nerd :P&nbsp; urlLink

 I was eavesdropping on my housemates friend tonight. She's going through a breakup (went through?) and it was sad to hear my words coming out of her mouth. The "What do you mean right now? Does that mean later?" questions, and the "overall acceptance that nothing may ever change so I should move on" talk. It made me sad to know that's what I sound like when I talk to my friends. And it made me sad to know that I need to give up loving "her". I've been thinking about the roles "loved" vs "lover". I think it is harder to be the lover than it is to be the loved. As a friend was saying, The father, no matter how traumatized his psyche was by the child birth, will never feel the pain that the mother felt. So it is for the loved and the lover. The lover will always feel more pain from rejected love, than the loved will feel from rejecting the love. At least that's the way it seems to work. I got off early tonight, but I had nothing planned, so I watched my roommates play video games, and tried to fix my old computer. (Bad Hard drive, won't reformat :P ) Now it's 11 and I NEED to sleep. Talk to you all soon, Peace- T

 I would like a tattoo because I would like to have some art to look at while I'm in the shower. Or have a piece of art that I can have always to have some fun with. I think that a tattoo would be nice for conversation starting and allow me to have a unique way of expressing myself. At this point, I am in decent enough shape that my tattoo shouldn't have too much misshaping over the next few years. I may go with something like a musical note or maybe a dog. I don't know, I need to think about this... :S Peace- T

 Also, I want to get a tattoo or piercing, but I need ideas. Leave a comment and let me know what you think I should get:) &nbsp; I'm thinking either urlLink Trogdor or a gold star which I could push to make myself invinsible for 6 seconds like Mario. Peace- T

 I skipped running today:( C'est la vie, I'm doing it tomorrow morning. 6:30 am is only 6 hours away :( &nbsp; I'm going to sleep, Peace world- T

 Here I am. My last blog hasn't even dried and I am posting again :P &nbsp; Anyway, I saw Farenheit 911 today and wanted to recommend it. This movie is a thinker that I think everyone should see. It REALLY brought to the forefront what war is like. &nbsp; Really going to sleep this time- T

 I'm thinking of doing the monk thing for a while. I kind of became frustrated with my lack of sex today and had to have another DTR with the ex.&nbsp; &nbsp; So, here I am, if I give up on the fact of having the sex again within the next 10+ weeks, I think I can become a game testing GOD! Or at least secure me a blue badge position? I don't know but I think I SHOULD use my amazing computer abilities for good, but sometimes it's so easy to be evil :) &nbsp; So, I ended up only working 15.8 hours this weekend:) Gotta love the OT. I hate that I cancelled my 7am run, but am glad that I'll still have a run tomorrow night. &nbsp; I'm lost in a sea of wondering and hate the fact that I have heartache. I want to have it removed, but I don't know how. &nbsp; Peace from the sleepy- Tim

 OH MY GOD!!! &nbsp; I went to bed like 2 hours ago. I am about to go take a shower to cool off. I HATE this HEAT!!! &nbsp; Damn you heat!!!! &nbsp; Peace- T

 OK, so it's like a BILLION degrees in my room right now. I could sleep until Sunday, but I'm at work from 10 - 8&nbsp; tomorrow :P &nbsp; Anyway, I was thinking about drugs the other day. I think sometimes there is a time and a place for drugs. and then there is also a time and a place to be drug free. For me, being drug free is key right now. I'm trying to stay at the top of my game, and I'm a bit tired now, w/o any drugs. I don't know where I'm going with this, so I'm just going to stop. &nbsp; Well, I have too many things to do. Including pay my bills and sleep, so I'll try and remember what I wanted to talk to my bloggy neighbors about, and will get back to you. &nbsp; Peace- T

 My life for the past few years has been the life of the contractor. I thought I might share some tidbits into this most bizarre existence that we have created. The goal of a contractor is to become a real employee (goal #1). Everything we do is a hope to someday attain the reliable check of a full time employee. At least that is the way it is for at least 95% of us. Every 9 - 12 months I am forced to take a 100-day non-paid leave. This can put the hurt on, as most of the time this happens from November - February. One goal many of us have is to be able to contract again after this 100-day break (goal #2). If no employer is willing to rehire you, then you will have a pain in the ass trying to get back in. Key points to maintain while you ARE a contractor. 1) ALWAYS be available for overtime - this is key, especially when you have low finances, missing 1 OT session could mean your slot is no longer available for a few weeks. (also, OT is considered a perk that may not last much longer, if you are given the opportunity you should seize it, as full-time employees don't get time and a half) 2) Don't hound about become a full time employee - first impress your boss by ALWAYS being available for OT, then be ready to answer off hand remarks about future job positions 3) Know how to be a hard worker (This is key because you're trying to shine above the rest of your cohorts, some of which the full times have pet names for, i.e. Crazy legs) 4) Know how to get shit done (When your boss comes and asks you to do something, the first time you may ask questions, after that you should KNOW how to do it. If given a task by your boss, you should complete your tasks and have a short 1 - 2 sentence response with your results. Having written results in an email can also be a great way for your boss to know the info, without you having to interrupt his work day) 5) If your boss enters the room, be the first person to ask if they need any help. They will begin to look to you as a person that can get shit done. This will help in both goal #1 and goal #2. That's really about all you can do while you're a contractor. If you impress your boss enough, he may decide you are a valuable asset which should be hired full-time, but it takes a LOT of work to get to this point. Hang in there and you may make it. But usually people will either not be hired back (black listed) or get "real" jobs elsewhere. That's about all I have to say about that. It's interesting to think about the parallels that appear in my life to this particular segment. Peace- Tim

 I was going to run with Cliff last night. But he bailed. So I ran around greenlake by myself this morning. It was refreshing, but I think I push myself harder when Cliff isn't around. Well, it's time for working hard, so I should go. Peace- T

 I AM working today. I lied about not working, although technically it wasn't a lie, because at the time, I thought I wasn't. C'est la vie. I dreamt last night. I dreamt I woke to check my email and had 2. One was from my ex and another from work. Before I could answer either, a coworker came into my bedroom and started asking me about a bug they had found while I was sleeping and whether or not it was a known issue. I followed him over to where Peter's room is and our computer lab was all setup and running with my boss asking me if it was a known issue. I told him I didn't know and would have to see the bug to know if others had seen it. I woke shortly after looking at the problem and telling my coworker that we didn't have it recorded and he should write up the bug. The past couple of nights I've been thinking about Faith and religion. I KNOW I could never vote for Bush, but have I strayed so far from the Christian faith? Do I believe that all religions are a crutch? Do I think that faith in a religion is only for those who have given up thinking for themselves or do I still believe? Do I want there to be someone/something/(an all loving God) out there that wants to see me succeed? Is there a plan for my life and am I on the right path? Should I worship at the church of Microsoft and bow to the almighty dollar? Of religion, I can say for certain, they do re-emphasis the spirit as the most important thing. People are the reason I was put on this earth. Without friends and family, without new acquaintenances, without people, life would be ever so dull. I'm just not sure "saving" the soul is what is needed. Well, I need to get ready for work. Peace- T

 Holy Sh*t!!! I gots the weekend off!!! Woohoo!!! Now... what to do? Peace- T

 So I had random post at 5:30 this morning, which meant I woke up at 5:30 and wrote a post, then tried to sleep until 7am when I got up to go running with Cliff. That didn't really happen. Fortunately, I was able to sap enough restfulness out of that hour and a half to be affective today :) Running is good. It makes me feel awake and healthy. Anyway, it seems like I may get off this weekend so I'll have time to run errands!!! YAY!!! I've also been remembering this movie I saw like 2 years ago with Jarred. It's called "Intacto" and is a spanish film about luck. It was really great and if you love foreign films I highly recommend this one. Anyway, I've got some Localization peeps to manage. Peace- T

 I often wonder what makes me want to be so responsible. It seems that if I wanted I COULD get away with not working for long periods of time and maybe just live off the state for a while (see step-sister) But instead, I want to succeed in a career. I want to be praised by my coworkers and stand out in the minds of my bosses. I want to be desired for full time employment at the risk of sabotaging personal friendships at work. I don't understand who I am, nor why I have an overwhelming sense of responsibility for a job that I could just as easily lose next week.

 It's true. I miss having even a pseudo girlfriend. Now it's the 4th of July and I have to be at work in 11.5 hours and the F*CKING neighbors won't stop letting off fireworks!!! I have my run in the morning, but my friend Cliff (see running buddy) is moving to Lake Samamish(sp?) plateau. That means my current running buddy (see best friend) will be 45 minutes away on a good commute day :( I am trying to get C# under my belt like no tomorrow. I have gotten my program to a point where I can download a webpage and extract all the img file locations and links. Next I need to work on erraticating duplicate links and links to other websites. Then I need to download each new webpage and rinse lather and repeat. It's really fun to problem solve and get this all figured out, but I'm scared that it won't be enough to land me a job :( Anyway,I'm exhausted and horny and lonely, so I'm going to sleep. To all those out there celebrating the 4th. Happy independence day and I'll see you on the 5th. Peace- T

 It's true. I found out today that I am officially exhausted. I imagine I'll have 1 more day off this summer. Sunday, and then it's working everyday until we ship. Props to heather for finding me and leaving the comments. I think a love of Guster is good, but finding a needle(Tim) in a haystack(The internet) is even more amazing :) I'll check you guys later. A total exhausted Tim.

 Hey Everyone- I just found out that July 2nd is the world wide (national?) 'I forgot' day. That means that today you can make up for anything you've forgotten about in the last year. W00T. Anyway, yesterday was 'Canada' day. So for all you Canadians out there. Happy Canada day! (It's I forgot day, and since I forgot Canada day, does that make it ok to mention it?) and in case I don't get out of this working coma, Happy Independence Day!!! Let the fireworks begin!!! W00T Peace out- T

 He follows you around, He thinks you're so cool, He wants to be just like you, You friends are getting annoyed by your little tagalong, it's becoming quite the nuisance He needs to get his own life, quit sucking his life from you, He used to be cute and endearing, but now he's just a pain.

 So I think the loneliness is beginning to get to me. I haven't had a good talk with anyone for a long time. I would count the days, but they all start to jumble in my mind. I think I've been burning the candle at both ends for too long and it's finally catching up with me. I need some relax and chill time with people, if only just to talk about my feelings. OR maybe I just need a good nights sleep and then I won't have these lonely feelings anymore. Who knows? Peace out- Tim

 It's crunch mode in t-minus , oh wait, we're in the middle of it. Another day and we've got Strep throat in the office. I am praying that I don't get it, and neither do my testers. I guess time will tell. I got a package from a friend today. I need to start reading again, and filling my head with fun ideas. Anyway, I need to sleep. Running in t-minus 7.3 hours. Peace- T

 So, I'm having trouble sleeping. It's one of those toss and turn nights.... So I popped in a little Fight club:) I love that movie. It got me thinking about some things... If I wake up too exhausted too many days in a row, Do I wake up as another person? Am I actually 2 people living my life? I feel as though my life could be pulling in 2 different directions. My reponsible side wants to get full-time employment with MS, while my playful side wants to say F*ck it all, I'm going to work at subway! Anyway,I used to think I had a lot of posts on here "566"... but now I realize that all those months that I took off from blogging were months where other people were at least blogging once or twice a week :) Good thing this isn't a competition, otherwise I would have lost:P Note to self: Must update blogger profile to include mulholland drive... also, must sleep, we wouldn't want to wake up tyler:)

 So I am basically managing 14 people now. I am Mr. "go-to-guy" in the department. I know that some of my coworkers despise me for this, but I won't apologize for it. I do make myself known to be available for the developers and I do make myself available to the higher ups. If you want to despise me for doing a good job, then so be it, but don't downright undermine me. I don't know, it seems like people would rather argue with me, since I sincerely have no power over them, than to try to help me with something that a developer might need. Anyway, I digress... I wanted to write about the things one deals with when "managing" 14 people, or something like that. I forget. Anyway, I should start programming again and maybe I'll be able to get a really real job!! Now if I only knew where that quote came from... dammit! Goodnight- T

 I'm going to bed, but I wanted to write you all and wish you a happy sleep and peace in this world. Remember... You are beautiful :) Peace- T

 So my friend just sent me a link to urlLink Team America Which looks hella good and I wanted to share it with you all. So THERE! Peace out- T

 I'm listening to Guster right now. It's good therapy music. Some of the songs are good for being alone. Some are good for heartbreak. Some are good for starting over. Some are good for finding someone new. I'm confused as to who I am right now, or what music I need. I know that I'm a good person that will continually try to do the right thing. If that's not a desirable attribute, then I guess I won't be desirable. Everything in me wants to help others succeed. But even as I write that, I know it's not true. I know that I don't want people that talk down to me to succeed faster than me. I know that there are people that drive me nuts and whom I probably dislike enough to not want them working where I work. I'm always analyzing peoples skills and where they might fit best (at work anyway) I categorize my friends. I hide my feelings, in order to self protect, as almost everyone I know will leave sooner or later. I think I talk better in person or on the phone than I do in email, but I don't know if that's true. I know I can charm, but I don't know how I do it. Someone once told me to stop manipulating them, but I didn't know how or if I was actually doing it. I don't have a conscience malisciousness, but maybe there is something darker inside? I want to trust new friends, but I also don't want to get burned. It's a fine line. Trust is a good thing. I'm running in 8.5 hours, I'm going to bed. Peace- T
