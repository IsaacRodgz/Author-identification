 RickE getting off the chairlift...

 me grabbing some air of one of the many jumps that they made just for snowboarders. They also had many handrails (one at the base of this jump) that you could grind/railslide on. F'n sweet!

 Back bowls of vail on Thursday. Me cheering!

 this was taken at a friend's house during the football playoffs. classic !

 I'm back, na-na-na-na-naanana. Vail was most excellent. There was a dumping of about 6 inches of fresh powder, which made thursday the best snowboarding day i've ever had. I was wishing you cats could come out and join me. I met a lot of cool peeps out there, as people are more chill in that kinda place. For some reason I kept hearing Pearl Jam being played. I'll have some photos from the trip soon. Don't forget that this Friday is supposed to be Dara in Reston... If I do go, I know it's going to be hella crowded. Laterz.

 I know, this picture is stupid, but he has become another object of obsession

 ill give it one more try ... 2 times and i tried to blarg and blogger wasnt working so i lost what i wrote. if you look on the left there. yes its my FIRST time getting my car towed !!! way to go tm1nor !!! anyway that day i went to get my front brakes done (thanks PK) and that was hella cheap because my friend PK, did it for FREE which would cost me like $60-$100 bucks to do at a autobody shop...so im thinking im saving a lot of money but then that SHIT happens. my car gets towed and from that fucker, that everyone hates. Henrys. they will pay , trust me they will . They tried to give me shit , that they needed proof i owned the car and etc. just a bunch of bullshit that i wasnt happy to hear while trying to get my car out. I know Simon, had his car stolen back twice and thanks to a ex friend / ex girlfriend. heh....but looks like Henry's moved to van dorn street with bright white lights and of course. a wooden metal fence it seems. So there was NO way i could ( i would ) steal my car back. damn fuckers. oh well next time. where thes the paintball gun when you need one. I know a few friends of mine that has been towed numerous times and seems like Henrys did most of the towing .... other news. tomorrow is WED!!!! which means......2 more work days til the weekend. 2 great football playoffs ..... urlLink lets bet simon ! ...and just chilling ( i havent gone to a bar /club in a few weeks now....amazing huh....lil taquito needs a break....plus im moving out soon. congrats and happy belated birthday to my friend (known him since hs days) , SJ and he has baby twins .

 whatever dear you can have your girl hold on to you so it doesnt matter you can still shake that bootie hehe *~*

PRESIDENT BUSH WANKER hes at this national capital flag back behind my work and there is like a million cops and secret service people and guess even what... 3 snipers ON top of the damn building should i run around in circles? and see if they shoot me?

 site of the day goes out to you guys! urlLink for you guys

 I second that, dude what were you smoking? Didn't we tell you to lay off the weed Squirrels are evil, did you ever see that Geico commercial where they cause the driver to crash into the tree and were giving each other high fives at the end? (Funny ass commercial)... But seriously, you need to cut back to once a day. I wonder if they make patches for heavy weed smokers, hmmmm?

 wow... that's deep.... were you high?

 Poor squirrel. The ordeal had to be terrifying. It probably struggled for as long as it could until it was exhausted. Maybe it even gave up at some point knowing that this was where his/her life would end. I wonder if he/she left behind any loved ones? Perhaps theres a widow somewhere wondering when her hubbie is gonna return with the grub. And you know, shit like this probably happens thousands of times a day all over the world. I wonder, if we were to add the number of living things that have died agonizing deaths (like being tortured or eaten alive by some predator) since the history of living things, we'd probably come up with an unimaginable number of existences ending in misery. Anyway, the picture of the squirrel is really depressing. I can't wait until the summer when the days are long.

 my friend anita told me about this ----- found a squirrel stuck in the lid of our trashcan, it chewed its way through the top (plastic trashcan) and then ate a bunch of the food in the trash can and tried to get out but got stuck, so it's frozen in the lid of our trashcan! heres the pic !

 i realized on sunday night...a small pain on my lower wisdom teeth ......growing in...hopefully straight and the pain will go away. but for now, i called in sick today to get it check up on and hopefully it will be ok. i dont want to get my wisdom teeth pulled unless they knock my ass off then ill be fine..... whos picking who falcons vs eagles sucky ass 49ers vs tampa bay notice the bold, which means who i want to win! ----------------- who wants to bet with me?

 You have to admit, Owens is pretty good though. Right Thy? double or nothing vs bucs?

 shit . both of my teams lost today. boo hoo two great games. all last minute games too. i hope owens (# 81) get a big ass whooping next week vs Bucs.....

 damn simon can be a DICK sometimes , randall. sorry about that. you should have said something ...because i didnt hear you and you look soooooooo HIGH. but thanks for jb and bob for throwing the lil shin dig ...i had a great time....

 I'd be interested to know how the party was. The one you guys went to after leaving bob's room. I tried to go with you guys also but I was too high to really say anything intelligable. I was trying to tell Simon to stop but all I remember was the back of his head and then the door shut behind him. What a bastard. Charo wouldn't wake up quick enough either. Had a great time though, might've smoked a little too much. I couldn't help it though, there was so much smoke being passed around. Big thanks to Bob who hooked me up with some leftovers, and let us chill in his room for quite a while. J.B. too. It was a good time.

 HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYONE! what a crazy night. something else blog it. me so tired

About the girl running around in the subway to get a pretzel and to go back to the subway train at the same time. well thats what i was .....attempting to but.....to give my my boss his ringing cell phone ....he was upstairs, i was downstairs. so i heard it......told my co-worker, josh .....

 pic of the day.. An Albanian man smokes a cigarette as his wife carries hay alongside the national road in near Elbasan, near the capital of Tirana February 24, 2003. In rural Albania, tradition dictates that women to do all the house chores with men never helping as this is seen to be a sign of weakness how FUCK up is that? shit. i bet all my male guy friends wont mind me doing all the COOKING , for that part. hahah

 hey kids. how ya doing?? i wil be coming in town this weekend. that whole record/mp3 dl is fokin bs! oh hey guess what i found... i was reading an article about pvd and it said [ Mezz: Do you like dancing personally? Paul Van Dyk: Yes, but Im more like a jumper. Im a jumping person. ] haha.... pvd jumps like me. hehe. ok see ya soon. (=

 aahh me so urlLink tired ....... these past few days , ive been so lazy. knowing that may is just a few months ago. its kinda " unreal " at the same time.....oh i cant wait. or can i =)..... lets see this past weekend i went urlLink boarding ...(i know im a little late on blarging)....and it was a great time. i did a lot better this time than the last time. fellow blogger , 2k and i found some spots to hit (little ones) and 2k was hitting them and jumping on them...unlucky, my friend from highschool Toby, lost his cd player when he fell on a blue slope. sucks. we couldnt find that but we found a lighter.....it was quite cold out for our last run , we got stuck for about 10 minutes on the chairlift (some stupid reason) and ppl were moving the chairs, up ' n ' down...and that was scary... but i was too cold to get scared. we are planning another trip in a few weeks so anyone down? simon, i think you can go ONE more time. eh? or no? you have to workout 984938439 hours now to catch up on that gut, phatty =) sorry to says guy, but our trip to NYC in march, i cant make it. yesterday, i bought my plane ticket to chicago for that week....im off to the windy city that weekend, you can come there. buzz is there =) (i dont think ill be there during that night) so you guys can do NYC, or we can do it some other time.

 Not sure if any of you are aware of the battle going on right now, but I found a pretty good article that lays out AOL's interesting urlLink predicament . For anyone not aware, a brief synopsis: A Verizon customer was found to have 666 music files on his computer by an RIAA analyst. The RIAA subpoenaed Verizon to get this customer's name and address, citing section 512h of the DMCA. Verizon refused, and the matter was taken to court. Judge Bates ruled in favor of the RIAA, and Verizon plans to appeal. Now, the final outcome of this battle has very serious implications. If the RIAA wins, they'll be able to issue as many subpoenas as they want without going through a judge or providing evidence that a supoena is warranted, and any ISP will have to hand over their subscriber's personal information. AOL, who so far has been silent about the whole matter, is in a very interesting position, given the fact that it's the largest ISP as well as the largest copyright holder. It's also a member of the RIAA, and a member of the U.S. Internet Service Provider Association, which has filed a legal brief siding with Verizon. There's a lot more to all this but that's the basic breakdown. There's obviously a LOT at stake here. Sucks that we're basically powerless. I figured some of you civil rights advocates out there might be interested to know... =) It's actually something that probably all of us might want to be aware of.

 Came across this funny flash site I thougth you guys might enjoy, slap the biatch and become a SUPER PIMP!!!

 one word to describe michael jackson --------> WOW besides that, hes sold millions of records....known as the KING of pop.....but wow....while watching this 2 hour special on abc has been great and so funny here are my notes i wrote down : ( i didnt write them down, really i didnt ! ) 1) my favorite quote has to be , he loves trees and he climbs on one tree.....and so hes climbing and tells the reporter to come up mj - " havent you ever climb up a tree ? " reporter - "nope" mj - looking so happy " awe, youre missing out " , while hes on the tree....WACKO actually its funnier if you saw the bit but it was classic (luke agrees) 2) germany LOVESS him . crying fans, while here if you saw a 17 yr old girl , she wouldnt be crying and wanting a hug (except for one guy i know, fellow blogger randall loves him , i hear hahah) 3) he went to vegas, and he rented out 7 suites in the hotel ! , he has everything in his freaking hotel room, games, a mobile cart, he rides down the halls in the middle of the night (when hes bored) 4) he DENIES having plastic surgery.man, brother, stop lying ! 5) his fingernails are odd looking 6) in vegas (again) he buys JUNK...he went to one store and spent $1 million dollars 7) hes worth a billion.....rightttttt found out hes only worth 200-300 million ( a lot still )

 gnocchi is what i want ! ive been craving something i havent even had yet ! since watching joe millionaire, they were at this 5 star place and they were eating these potato pasta rolls. they dont have meat ( you can add ) but its just pasta dough (mixed with potatoes) and just whatever sauce you want. i did some research on some recipes.....that will be on my list to make when we are in our house....

 WASHINGTON -- Jaromir Jagr acknowledged Wednesday that he made mistakes when he lost $500,000 betting through an Internet gambling site, but he insisted he paid the debt four years ago and did nothing illegal. "It was 1998, and I made mistakes,'' Jagr told reporters after the Washington Capitals' practice. "I just wasn't smart. It was stupid. It wasn't illegal, and it was five years ago. Everything was taken care of in 1999. That's all I can tell you.'' Jagr owed the money to William Caesar, owner of the gambling Web site CaribSports, based in Belize. Sports Illustrated reported that Jagr agreed to pay $450,000, split into monthly payments, to settle the debt -- and that Caesar leaked the story to the press after Jagr stopped making the payments. Jagr disputed that part of the magazine's story, reiterating that the debt was settled in 1999, and that he didn't know why the story was coming out now. There was no allegation that Jagr bet on NHL games, which would be violation of league rules. Caesar told the magazine he had technicians configure Jagr's betting page so the hockey star could not bet on the NHL. "We did that for our own protection, not just his,'' Caesar said. "That would destroy us, if he destroyed the game.''

 thanks to nathan....he sent this email.... When I was a kid When I was a kid adults used to bore me to tears with their tedious diatribes about how hard things were when they were growing up; what with walking twenty-five miles to school every morning uphill both ways through year 'round blizzards carrying their younger siblings on their backs to their one-room schoolhouse where they maintained a straight-A average despite their full-time after-school job at the local textile mill where they worked for 35 cents an hour just to help keep their family from starving to death! And I remember promising myself that when I grew up there was no way in hell I was going to lay a bunch of crap like that on kids about how hard I had it and how easy they've got it! But... Now that I've reached the ripe old age of thirty-one, I can't help but look around and notice the youth of today. You've got it so damn easy! I mean, compared to my childhood, you live in a Utopia! And I hate to say it but you kids today you don't know how good you've got it! I mean, when I was a kid we didn't have The Internet--we wanted to know something, we had to go to the library and look it up ourselves! And there was no email! We had to actually write somebody a letter--with a pen--and then you had to walk all the way across the street and put it in the mailbox and it would take like a week to get there! And there were no MP3s or Napster! You wanted to steal music, you had to go to the record store and shoplift it yourself! Or we had to wait around all day to tape it off the radio and the DJ would usually talk over the beginning and screw it all up! You want to hear about hardship? You couldn't just download porn! You had to bribe some homeless dude to buy you a copy of "Hustler" at the 7-11! Those were your options! We didn't have fancy stuff like Call Waiting! If you were on the phone and somebody else called they got a busy signal! You had the option of an "Emergency Breakthrough" but after a few months of the "Emergency Breakthrough fever," you could tell the operator started hating your very existence. And we didn't have fancy Caller ID boxes either! When the phone rang, you had no idea who it was it could be your boss, your Mom, a collections agent--you didn't know!!! You just had to pick it up and take your chances, mister! And we didn't have any fancy Sony Playstation videogames with high-resolution 3-D graphics! We had the Atari 2600! With games like "Space Invaders" and ! "Asteroids" -- the graphics sucked! Your guy was a little square! You had to use your imagination! And there were no multiple levels or screens, it was just one screen--- forever! And you could never win, the game just kept getting harder and faster until you died! Just like LIFE! When you went to the movie theater there no such thing as stadium seating! All the seats were the same height! A tall guy sat in front of you, you were screwed! And sure, we had cable television, but back then that was only like 20 channels and there was no onscreen menu! You had to use a little book called a TV Guide to find out what was on! Or worse yet, you had to actually look in the newspaper. And there was no Cartoon Network! You could only get cartoons on Saturday morning... ...D'ya hear what the hell I'm saying!?! We had to wait ALL WEEK, you spoiled little brats! That's exactly what I'm talking about! You kids today have got it too easy. You're spoiled, You guys wouldn't last five minutes back in 1984

 Yea. Good times. Thanks for coming out Y'all, it was a hoot. I still have lots of booze left. There are about 3-4 bottles of good rum to kill, so i'm thinking in the near future to have a movie night, maybe hot tub thing with about 6 people, make daquries and pina coladas, and hitting 3rd degree which is the Reston Drum and bass party that I keep telling you about. I'll keep you posted. Meanwhile matt has posted a lot of pics from the night on his web site. urlLink 7 deadly sins party ! Kyle even did a shot of the (translated from Latin) "cock of satan" pepper vodka, which is really really hot because it's got habinero peppers in it. It's a lot more crazy than the Absolute Pepper vodka that Kurt accidentally put in his Red Bull and Vodka (yuck). Classic moment, when kyle and matt attempt to break dance and end up falling over trying to do one-handed handstands. As matt picked himself off the floor I took a shot that makes him look like a monkey walking around with the aid of his knuckles. You'll see it on the link. Laterz Crew, it was good to see you again. -Rick

 in the past few weeks , all the weather we've been having is RAIN . I miss the last year's summer when it was so fucking hot I wanted winter to come by really quick. Luckily last night, it was a nice night that ended up having simon drooling in sam's car and him yelling out " hollar " to like 15 chicks in ONE taxi cab, and having them flicking him off. good work simon! We went to see Scott Henry (ole buzz resident) to spin for 1 hour = 10 bucks admission (sucks)...and left to go get some pizza mart pizza. yummmmmmy. im gonna end the story here now im tired.......

 whew luckily no new battery for me. all it was was just new terminals for my battery. which cost me .99 cents , i wasnt looking fwd to be spending $60 + for a battery but i rather just wait for a new car ( keep on wishing ). The 3rd season of urlLink amazing race is on and i sooooooooooo want to do it. who wants to be my partner and im serious, wouldnt you want to travel around the world and race it with 11 other couples. on this season there are these two cuties, guys that are, and they are married. interesting...tomorrow is friday and im looking for to that, having dinner with another couple, go figure.

 help my car needs a new battery ..... and new terminal thingys (what are they called ???)

 ok im back to blogging. ive gotten a few emails of people wondering what the hell ive been up to and now that lukas is here. i dont have any time for anyone. ok maybe lucky you . but tonight while during commerical breaks, playing snake 2 on my cell phone (my high score is 500 something, crap score, simon / sanh has high ranking scores). I always love watching dateline or 20/20 stuff on things they do, like take it tonight, it was about " reality dating " and it remind me of some of my single friends (yes you know you are out there). On dateline they were talking about this bar place, in NYC called urlLink Remote Lounge Here's what it is ---> a revolutionary new concept in nightlife entertainment: >> live video feeds >> controllable cameras >> interactive digital art >> tasty cocktails and snacks even better, tuesday nights plays drum n' bass / breaks ! . Ok we are def making a nyc trip this summer for this. the concept of this bar is like 70 mini cameras all over the bar, and you can call the person you see on screen, and they see you. Of course, they might not like you (HIDE) or they might actually like you. I thought it was cool, makes it easier for the shy guys out there ( YES YOU ). but click on the site and its pretty cool. All I can do in that bar is help the guys find girls. Trip # 2 to NYC here we come....

 in less than 14 hours ...i think my life is gonna change...and im happy about it. wish me luck guys :) p.s. ill start writing back when im BACK from dewey beach , are you guys ready ???

 ahem.... i would like to say CONGRATS to my baby, he found another job!!! he found something hes sooooo happy about (IT staff auditor) and better than his job now (Accounts Payable). Good thing, we can have lunch, hes working in Old Towne, but its a govt contracting, so well see what happens. Psymon, hes so happy, like you told me, " youre self made there ". and he is, and hes happy he found that job all by himself. congrats baby. love you.

 note to self : stop having dreams with your friends in it its been like 3 days in a row i keep having dreams about psymon and samus. odd heh always you two together. hmm maybe you guys are a gay couple in my dream . haha

 i think some of you guys have met SJ (scott) , hes my friend since highschool but hes picky who he hangouts with haha. hes loaded girls. haha joking. he is the one with 2 bikes and a 350z. but hes a daddy now so he never hangouts now. but i am getting my E (thats what the drivers call it) end of the year. i need a new car and i want that. plus its good when i have kids (yikes) to update: "he called and said " sorry " " . thought so bitch. hah

 tonight is the night......yes. we're getting a group to go to atlantic city tonight for some gambling and free drinks (more so on the drinks, i doubt about winning). Last night we headed out to Adams Morgan for some bar hopping, I only had one drink (go figure) because I had drinks @ the house (a lot cheaper). and out of 8-9 people, i think everyone was drunk (except for the drivers). Please note, dont let Psymon sleep on your bed because why? He will SLEEP there forever. It was about 4am, and he slept on the bed, and wouldnt get off. Even by saying " hey simon, im going to bed, can you get off " . He would say " whhyyyyyyyy " then go back to bed, so Atalie had to remove him off the bed, by dragging. thanks. and we tried to tie his laces together but he knew what was up. damn. Another rainy day, Another crappy day. Another road trip. whats your fave numbers?

 man, i had a terrible dream last night , and woke up feeling like it was so REAL... plus in my dream (besides the nightmare), i was wearing my mom's clothes, from vietnam. odd heh? its been a busy week for me at work but im out early today, should i hit the gym? tomorrow i promise. my friend PK, is leaving for Fort Polk, so we're saying good bye to him all this weekend, miss ya babe. yah, its FRIDAY, yah, (like the kid from crank yankers) YAH!

 i went to see a distance uncle/aunt this weekend and found out my cousin is a dating a awesome artist(she works for the people that make half life / counterstrike), check her urlLink out check out the " portfolio / sketchbook / tutorials " talk about talent there! my fave is " geisha " im out

 so i havent posted pictures in a long time, and i was looking at old pictures of me , being, what else = DRUNK. those were the days. every fucking weekend, i would just get drunk and wasted and do it over again the following weekend. Counting the days at work and dreading each hour til it was friday, and its kinda funny to look at this one, just look at my expression. dinner tomm at jordans, woo hoo, finally the famous " crab soup " that ive heard from many people, great stories, it better be good sam. note i had a few shots and beers in me at that time, but yet that time was early, like a hour into the party. ahhh memories...i was dying that night, praying to god, but wait, i dont believe in god.

 1 week turns to 2 weeks , 2 weeks turn to 4 weeks... so its been the 1st week that luke has been gone, ok maybe mid-week now. He's in chicago right now, comes back for next week, then hes off to minnesota for a week, comes back for the weekend and then gone for another 2 weeks straight . Its kinda good though, for us to save money during the weekdays because we love to spend $. Also, for me to focus on looking for a place for us. I have exactly a month so wish me luck guys. Another side note, my friend Scott is also looking for a place and if he cant find a place, hes heading to NYC or CA. I wish i could do that, just leave like him, but wait , I have luke. Whatever choice you make, I'll be behind you. Def, throw you a party. Mikey is leaving for NYC in the matter of weeks. Found another band, Brand New , #5 of their album is a good song, found it through mtv. MAE is also good, from va beach. I def need to get a dig cam (ive had too many and sold too manY) and post some pics...

 attention... to all you matrix fans. check out urlLink japanese ping pong matrix ......

 shopping.... @ tysons, i saw the saddest thing. luke always makes these " inside jokes " with me, when he sees a asian girl with a mechang guy...and be like " look Thy, its us " , and i just laugh at him. well i saw this couple. Older asian lady, with this young white guy, and im thinking, luke hasnt said a thing to me about it...then i look behind the lady, and shes like in handcuffs (hecths), and her daughter (she look like 15 years old) was in handcuffs too. And I heard from the cop/security guy (which was undercover, very well, he look like a bum), asking " I cant believe you are stealing with your daughther, thats just sad "...... people are nuts to do that, steal with their kids. i wasnt too happy with it and i felt bad for the lady b/c of course she was asian, older lady too, and shes helping stealing with her daughter. just sad ill say. but she deserves it, teach them a lesson. i know stealing at malls is a harder crime now, thats just embrassing too to watch.

 12am - midnight - 0:00 hours (army time) thats when we all leave for the weekend, yah, this trip was def. last minute and we were very very lucky to find hotels (props to psymon) in a good distance between Atlantic City and Philly. i wish samus got to go, he always misses everything !

 entertainment for everyone....go ahead and laugh... so i was throwing shit away and saw some of my highschool memories...ah highschool, i remember one time, my senior year @ Edison HS. I almost didnt graduate, well or so, i was stressing out that I wasn't going to graduate. Why you ask? Well maybe because I skipped so many times in my world history class, that I got a F for one of the semesters. It was bad. No one can see me " skip " class, but I did it so much I got a fucking F for it and I got Saturday detention. I know I can laugh now but I was so stressing out that I wouldnt' graduate because of that stupid class that I always took naps in. ALWAYS. When the teacher would play a movie about history, etc. I would just sleep through the whole thing. Ah, highschool. I miss it. This was ME. 10th grader ! CLASS of 97 BABY. our slogan " thank heaven its 97 !! "

 to goes out to mainly to one person. i wont tell who you are haha Spearheading the emo brigade, Dashboard Confessional tackle such themes as relationships and love, thanks to singer/songwriter Chris Carrabba's poignant tunes. A Mark, A Mission, A Brand, A Scar is the sound of a young artist coming into his own. The record begins with "Hands Down," a breathless sprint through the moonlit memories of young love. As the album progresses, Carrabba's storytelling ability shines and the rest is surprising in its diversity. "I wrote my last album in two weeks when I was in a dark place," he says, "I wrote this one over a year and a half. I guess some people are always going to brand me as 'the sad guy,' but that's just not me. Everyone has bad periods in their lives. This record is about where I've been, certainly, but it's also about where I'm going and what I'm becoming." Stream the entire album a week before it hits stores with The Leak and join the emo club, if the spirit moves you. yes, urlLink dashboard's new cd is coming out and we can listen to their WHOLE album, yes whole...before it comes out in about 2 weeks. 8/4 is when we can at urlLink here just to let you know and again you know who you are

The Postal Service . The funny thing is that I even downloaded most of the album on the net too. Maybe I thought I needed to buy their cd, just because I became a fan. I've been on this " indie" music kick lately....I'm sick of listening to the radio (even though i have to @ work). Music Media sucks. Just trying to make that dolla bill. im out.

"
