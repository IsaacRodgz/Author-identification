 A Story about Onsites! One fine day, Vivek's PL Bhatia asks him whether he has any time for a small meeting. Vivek obviously has time and so the two go to a conference room. Bhatia then clears his throat and says "Vivek, there is an on-site requirement. It is in Covina, Los Angeles. It is for six months. I can suggest your name. Do you have any problems?" Vivek cannot believe his ears. Of course why should any one have problems going to the Sam land. "Of course no Bhatia.. I have no problems." he says. Bhatia looks at him very kindly and says "You better draw up your personal plans with your wife and let me know in a day or two" That's when Vivek remembers that he has a wife. Then it strikes him that there is a himalayan problem in front of him. Shobana is working. She is in the middle of a project in which she is a moduleleader. She cannot leave it all and come to Covina with Vivek. On the otherhand it will be cruel on Vivek's part to leave her here and go to Covina for more than half a year. Moreover, they have just been married. Vivek can stay back. But one day he has to go.. He cannot stay back in India indefinitely. Project requirements are too demanding. Shobana can resign and accompany Vivek. But what is the guarantee that she would find such a nice job in such a nice company after they come back from Covina? So Shobana and Vivek discuss this issue. They reluctantly agree to get separated for six months. Vivek hugs Shobana in the airport and says "I will be BACK" in a typical Arnold Scharzegger tone and then boards Delta Airways leaving Shobana in tears. In Covina Vivek gets lots of work and his stay gets extended by two more months. The days and months move very slowly. Vivek starts counting even minutes. During this period, Shobana's PL Ashish Mehta calls her one day and asks her whether she has any time for a small meeting. Shobana wonders what that meeting is.. They go to the conference room and Mehta tells her about a great on-site requirement in Berlin, Germany for their customer. "It is for six months and you are most suited person for this. I am going to suggest your name. Do you have any problems?" Mehta asks her. Shobana gets excited.. Berlin! She has never been out of India. So she instantly nods her head. Mehta then smiles and says "Okay discuss with your hubby and let me know in a day or two" That's when Shobana gets the gravity of the situation. It will be two months before Vivek can come home..... By the time Shobana will have left to Berlin for six months. Shobana cannot decline this as this is an important assignment. That night Vivek spends hundred dollars on telephone to discuss this matter with Shobana. Finally they decide to go ahead. Shobana breaks down in the phone and Vivek breaks down thinking about his phone bill. And then Shobana leaves to Berlin. One month after that,Vivek comes back to India. Then Shobana calls him almost everyday and they discuss about all petty things on the phone. Shobana applies for a loan to clear her telephone bills. Vivek gets into a new project which is not yet started. His PL Prateek Ray calls him one day and says that he has to go to Toledo Ohio for the requirement analysis of that project. Vivek frantically says no. Shobana is arriving next month. He doesn't want to miss her. But Ray assures him that the work is only for one month and that he would be back before Shobana comes to India. Thus Vivek flies to Toledo Ohio and gets into the requirement analysis of the new project. That's when he comes to know how difficult it is to retrieve information from the users. You can design a system the user wants only when the user knows what he wants. Vivek gets baffled by the questions his users put.. "Do you think I need those fields "GMG_TYPE_HJHJ_TW" and "Auto_level_ind"? What are they by the way?" The requirements analysis stage continues for three full months at this pace. Shobana comes to India one month after that. And she tells her PL that she doesn't want anymore on-site assignments. "I understand" says Mehta and she desperately waits for Vivek to come back to India. It has already been two months over a year since they last met. Vivek then gets the role of an on-site co-ordinator for this customer. He calls Shobana that night and they really don't know what to do. Shobana offers to resign her job and join him in Toledo. But she is getting 21 grand per month in India and Vivek doesn't want to lose that. "Two more months Shobana and I promise I will be back" Shobana retorts back, "There is no solution for this problem." Vivek gets surprised. "What are you talking about?" he asks her.Shobana fights back her tears. "As long as I am in this co. I will be getting a lot of on-site opportunities. Even if I decline all of them, what about you? You also work for a software company and there you need to go abroad almost once every quarter. I cannot accompany you as you don't want me to resign my job here. Does that mean we have to stay like this forever? Vivek! I love you and I don't know how I spent fifteen months without even seeing you once. I may not recognize you also if you come in front of me now... Tell me Vivek, is there a solution for this problem?" Vivek doesn't speak anything for a moment. He then realizes the truth in her sentences. It is a neverending problem. But what about the 20 grand she is getting per month? "Vivek, is money everything? Can't we comfortably live with what you are getting? Please Vivek, try to understand the situation" Shobana breaks down. Vivek is still undecided. He married a software engineer with a hope that with two incomes he would have a good deal of money to plan their future. "Let us face the reality, Vivek" Shobana says, "How much are you paying for the phone calls now? More than 20 grand per month. If I am with you there will your phone bill be so astronomical? Just tell me one thing. Won't you be happy having me there with you?" Shobana slowly turns hysterical. Vivek gets into the crux of the situation. It is true. He has been spending around 600 to 700 dollars per month on India calls... that is far more than what Shobana is getting then. He thinks and thinks.. for two days he does nothing else but thinking. Finally he decides that he should have Shobana with him all the time from then onwards at any cost. Shobana gladly prepares the resignation letter and submits it. Her PL smiles and says "You've made the right decision Shobana.. Congratulations for the bold step. I understand your problems. Anyway! you have a three months notice period here, right? We have a one month assignment in Singapore..." Heard that this is a true story!

 Nice to hear from Sindhu after a long time, by way when r u coming back... Yeah, Rini is on leave today, Jax Pl. do remove Azim's letter posted by Rini, its strictly confidential, I have already spoke to her regarding this... by way, Rini is also plng. for only pongal towards Madurai. myself, will be here only, have 2-3 ideas not yet finalised, anyone can step over here for holiday season... Cheers

 Good Morning ! "Kombumela poova suthi, nethiyila pottu vachi, kanni ponnu kai valatha kaalamaade...." Ilayaraaja the ultimate man....enthusiastic music in Kamal's "Virumaandi" (Sandiyar)... All songs are good...of all the songs, this one "Kombumela poova suthi..." Nice to hear a mix of great beat and rhythmic lyric...let us wait to see the film... Imm sindhu after a short while... what about others...ganesh, valli, rajesh, vijay....

 Hi Sindu, Seems you are visiting us after a very long time. I think the only job you can get during the Christmas season is "Pottallam Madikirathu". Go to any shop and apply for a shop assistant work. It's going to be a lot more fun till January. As the Christmas season extend till the 12th day after Christmas. Though I have not given any gifts to others till now, I am always ready to accept gifts. Please send your gifts to my home address. You can get it from Yahoo Groups!. Since a few of you might not be available at Bangalore, I guess it's Madurai for this Christmas. Don;t know whether to take a holiday on 24th or 26th. Have to decide. What about you Rini,, Coming Home? BTW, Could someone call up Kurinji and convey him my Birthday wishes today. Valli, hello, where are you? When will you be in India? Bye for now.

 Hi Looks like Xavier is getting the international attention..and the credit going to 'ha ha ha' Mahendran! I too would recommend Rini's suggestion. I think we should also be wary of publishing any information that is internal to a company. Azim's letter is purely internal and confidential. There is not much progress in my job hunting process..have too many restrictions in terms of location and commutation. Adding to it is the winter weather and peak christmas season. Everyone busy in shopping and fetching gifts for their loved ones. I am just gearing up for the long weekend. Xavier do you give any christmas gifts? Hey Ram and Rini....congrats...mariyadaiya nan India varrappa treat vattiyoda kuduthudunga!

 Chirstmas should never be dull... Ram has not shown any plans of moving from Blore.. not sure about others... But I'm going home as one would expect... after a pretty long interval by my standards... and I'll enjoy a christmas treat from my friend who was my roomie in Mangalore at the time of my infy training...!! And to top the icing, we have holiday on Dec 26th to enjoy a long weekend and will be compensating that by working this saturday...

 This Christmas seems to be a bit dull. I'm missing the excitement and the joy associated with the season. I'm thinking of spending it outside Coimbatore. One choice is Madurai. But even there I feel that I cannot really enjoy it. Chennai seems another place, But I don't know what I can do in Chennai for two days. Bangalore is another option. Lots of places to see. Hey you Bangaloreans, Anyone working on Christmas?

 Hi all, wrt the copyright issue... I read that poem in the Living with Honour book and I felt impressed with that and I reproduced the same without any alteration to a single word of it except the title... Thats all... and Jax I leave the ball in ur court and u can delete or place a link or do what so ever to freeze it up... rini, coming to the girl in my dream, there is an inspiration which made me write this small (poem like one...ha ha). When we were in the hostel, we (me, rajesh, sandil, ram and others) used to write kavithais in english translating the tamil songs...you might be remembering the one kavithai..."I had a girl friend...I had a girl friend..." ( A translation of the "enakkoru snehidhi..." song in priyamaanavale film...) It was a fun time to read all those and yesterday i was hearing the same song in my system and thought of all those that happenend in hostel... Just thought of doing the same...but somehow a gal who inspired me came in the picture...(whose face yet to be seen by me...ha ha)... That resulted in this outcome of my thoughts...but for that, I have to find my girl who came in my dream...ha ha.

 Good to see that everyone understands copyright issues. Kicha made a valid point in saying that "It takes to be the owner of an IPR to feel the pain when someone infringes that." Really, I would be annoyed to read a story that I had written attributed to someone else or if it has been modified. This has been a reason why I had said we could not simply copy and paste from a website. I know sometimes, you may feel that you want the article to be present so that we can understand it more. But if an article can be found on the net, it would be better if you can just provide a link to it. The least thing we can do is atleast acknowledge the rights the author has. Kicha had rightly pointed out that we often take IPRs for granted. That time has ended. Companies have started /starting to have IPR policies in place. Clients too have started to understand the importance and are now demanding the same. As most of us work for s/w companies, our understanding of Intellectual Property has to be higher than when we were just students. Though it is not enforced properly in our country, plaigarism in college can get you suspended. All universities abroad view plaigarism as a serious crime. This doesn't mean that you cannot quote anybody without permissions. It means that if you can explain an article in your own words, you can do so and provide a link to the original article quoting its source. For example, The Hindustan Times today reported that Infosys has acquired an Australian IT firm, Enterprise Information Services for 23 million USD. Read the urlLink article on Hindustan Times... Here I am not breaking any copyright laws, I am just linking to an article in a newspaper that is available freely to all netizens. The trouble is when we get articles through mails like Daddy's Day , we do not know who the author was (till now). It is a good idea that Cheryl suggested, Type a few lines of the poem in Google within quotes, you'll get results (with a little patience). It is better to spend a few more minutes online than be stuck with a copyright infringemetn case. BTW, I had mentioned this quite some long time ago about using images. It is also not an ethical practice. When you display an image in a webpage, every time that page gets loaded, the browser tries to display the image from its original location, which might on somebody's server. This uses up the bandwidth of that person. So someone else has to pay for displaying the image in your webpage. It is a bad practice. So when ever you want to display an image, you can link to the picture through text links. There is a wonderful way available on the Internet to share content. It is called urlLink Creative Commons . Have a look at this site and the ideas they wanted to share. Update : Before I could post, Kicha had posted the news suing the same method I was about to explain. Meanwhile, Manny, it is your call. Shall we credit the author of the poem (Daddy's Day) properly or remove it and give a link nstead (Rini's suggestion)? You can also put your name under the poem you posted, so that you can slam a copyright infringement case on some poor soul. BTW: Please close the HTML tags you use properly. Now someone has forgot to close an italics tag. Everything is in italics now.

 Really saying, I have lots and lots of thoughts going in my mind which I have to jot it down, But no time, what to do ma??? By way, ur words are fine, but what I think about those words is both of them r busy doing nothing... ha ha ha ha coming to copyright, yeah better give a link, 1 more think, whether Azim's letter is confidential for those mentioned in the address list or not... Rini, pl. confirm from Sreeni. Manny, gud keep going, let me c, which suits me: urs or jax's... hehehehehe. Cheers

 yaarukko kavithai aruvi maathiri kotra maathiri irukku? Chennaila thanni panjam theendumnu ninaikiren, BTW did u meet ur dream girl or is she only in dreams? Think chances are increasing for next get together ..........

 yes...It was from the book Living with Honour and I suggest blog father to do the needful to fix this issue... BTW here is some which will not bring any copyright issues for sure...'coz this was written by me....he he he..." ok then c u all in my next blog... It's between a dawn and a dusk, My head on my desk, Dead are my mind, But the work I should mind... Though I tend to work, My lids tend to sleep. A girl in my dream, One from the cream. A dream that's so rare, which wasn't a nightmare. She passed by me, And made my self freeze, Had no doubt in me, She was a passing breeze. She looked at me, I looked at her, Stunned at once, seeing each other. Its that moment, when she passed by me, Its her face That went into my heart's base. With a will in my day, I walked through the bend On her way till the bay, to see a face... that's filled with gay. As I rushed so fast, I left her go my past. In a dream not so bright, Amidst the dim dull light, When I turned to my right, It was the same face so bright. The moment I cherished, When my dream now got perished. In my damn dumb terminal, Again a day full of work. Let me wait for a dusk, till my head is again on my desk.... to see that girl in my dream who's one from the cream... Mahendran Jayavel

 The mail from Cheryl does give us all a knock on our heads. I suggest, we add the required information and retain just "a link" to that beautiful poem, with due credits to the author. I do want to bring upon another vital point. Very often, we do things so unkowingly that we may be doing a grave legal mistake... We frequently need to get content from google for a lot of our personal/official purposes, but how often have we worried about IPRs... It takes to be the owner of an IPR to feel the pain when someone infringes that... As "friends" we do have the habit of sharing some information from/about our organizations without giving a second thought to the IPRs and piracy. So, please take some time to learn about these aspects. Googling would surely aid u in this... Let me tell u some facts I'm aware of. .. 1. Can the material available on the Internet be copied? Free content available on the Internet can be copied for "personal use" only... This means, if you want to share some information available on the Internet, then you can only give a link to the place where it actually exists... You are not allowed to copy it and transmit it to any group of people... 2. Can the material available on the Internet (or other publications) be used as a reference material ? Borrowing segments of content from a source as is does constitute a violation in most cases... though many websites permit this form of "violation" as long as two conditions are fulfilled: The user indicates the source of the original content along with the terms and conditions of use as prescribed by the original creator and No modifications are made on the borrowed content... For more on this, visit the urlLink Indian IPR Law . Please make sure you follow the IPR guidelines at every possible instance.

 anyway it wont cost us much to do the changes he had suggested. So i dont find any difficulty in doing that, but then if some one else claims to be like what cheryl demands now, then it surely becomes a problem. Lets try to adopt what he says in our forth coming blogs and as such, lets remove the poem (since its read by everyone) and instead lets provide a link to the original poem in that place!. I dont think, we will be infringing any copy rights if we provide a link to the poem.. BTW ram, y rnt you making much updates to your mentations? The latest blog which u had posted cliked some words in me, which i recalled today, " If you are busy thinking what others are thinking about you, they are busy thinking, what you are thinking about them". What do you think about these words ya? In blogrolling section jax, why dont u provide a link to ROASM too, which will help us to navigate quickly b/w blogs.

 Hi everyone, I got a mail today for copyright infringement. I am reproducing the mail below for your understanding. Someone has illegally altered my copyrighted and published poem "Daddy's Day" which you are displaying on your site at: urlLink http://dayswork.blogspot.com/2003_11_23_dayswork_archive.html You have the title as "On a Daddy's Day". "Daddy's Day" was first published in the year 2000 in the book "Chicken Soup for the Parent's Soul". It was later published in the earlier part of 2001 in the book "Stories for a Teen's Heart 2". Because of those publications my poem ended up on the Internet and due to so many sites either displaying or circulating my poem without including my name, several have either plagiarized my poem or altered it, either by changing the title or adding lines pertaining to 9/11. As you'll note by the 2000 publication and copyright date of my poem, it was published before the 9/11, 2001 tragedy. The lines You see he was a fireman and died just this past year when airplanes hit the towers and made the meaning of freedom very clear do not belong in my poem. Someone took a national tragedy to infringe upon my copyright and in turn to break the law. A tell/tell sign that you are displaying the altered version of "Daddy's Day" usually starts with the first line. The line should read Her hair up in a ponytail and not Her hair was up in a ponytail. The word "was" does not belong in my poem. You are more than welcome to continue displaying my poem, but only if you do the following . . . use the correct title, which is "Daddy's Day", as well as the correct version, which would exclude the 9/11 lines and the word "was" in the opening line. Include the copyright date, which is 2000, add my name, Cheryl Costello-Forshey as the author. Also, you need to include the line, Cannot be copied or reproduced in any form without the written consent of the author. Furthermore, I ask that you mention that "Daddy's Day" has been published in the books "Chicken Soup for the Parent's Soul" and "Stories for a Teen's Heart 2". I realize that it seems like a lot to ask, but I'm sure you can understand why I'm asking. If you don't wish to do as I've requested then you will need to remove my poem from your site, otherwise, you are infringing on my copyright. By law, a person must exhaust all efforts (and prove that they have) in order to find the author of something before they can legally use it in any manner, otherwise, they are infringing upon that writer's copyright, which is against the law. Most people are not aware of that. As a personal favor I'd like to ask that you never display or circulate any material without knowing and including the author's name. So many writers are having their copyright infringed upon due to the Internet. There is a simple solution to finding the author of any material that you are hoping to display their work. Simply type a line, any line, from the story/poem within quotation marks into the google.com search engine and within seconds you should be able to find the author's name. Of course it may take a little bit more work than that, but in my case you would have found me within four seconds. If you don't know the author's name, please do not display the work because it leaves the door wide open to plagiarists. It's better to be a part of the solution for writers rather than part of the problem. Please contact me once you've made the changes. The longer my poem remains on your site without making those changes, the more damage that is caused for me. Warmly, Cheryl So what do we do? I feel we should respect the copyright and do either one of the two options available: Use the correct poem with due attributions and changes Remove it completely I am awaiting your thoughts on this. I particularly liked the penultimate paragraph in the mail where it speaks about avoiding copyright infringement. BTW, Vijay how was yesterday? My belated wishes to you, da. NO posts from you. Mumbai girsl keeping you busy?

 Nice to go thru the article... Thanks Rini, It may look like way beyond the goal... but persistent effort surely will fetch u the results. Cheers Ram

 Removed to avoid Copyright Infringement.

 Looking back at India's victory, it really feels good to win a test match abroad. Watching Dravid score the winning runs broughts out hurrahs from everyone watching. But it is still a paradox that we have to consider. We can go about boasting that we have won a test match in Australia. But we have to remmeber that they had won in India too the last time we met. Except for the heroics of Laxman and Dravid, we would have lost the series too. I expect Australia to come back with vengenace. I know they will. But as Kicha had said, they may have a minor worry of the loss rankling in thier mind. But with Brett Lee coming back to third test and McGrath for the final test, I feel that we might have to raise our levels much higher. And I have seen no other teamin the world that has raised the bars of performance higher thatn Australia. The last World Cup was a small example. After trying hard to reach the performance levels of the Aussies, we had managed to claw back into the final, but they had raised thier game to a much higher level on the day it mattered. With almost ten days before the two teams met again, it is to be seen how we put back the victory behind us and look at the games ahead us. Incidentally, we have nothing to lose. Even if we manage to draw the remaining matches, it will be termed a success by all. But I would call it a success only when we manage to win the tri-series after the test matches. They will be a very big challenge for our players, both physically and mentally. The true champion would be the team that manages to stay on its feet at the end. I believe the Americans term it "the last man standing". Will it be us?

 As we celebrate a hundred years of flight today, I wish to share my experience. I can hear a plane preparing to deposit its load of passengers and take to the skies again. Mankind has always been satisfied about flying. It must be because we have no way to lift our bodies off the ground. This deepest desire to take to the skies is well reflected in all mythologies. Almost every religion on earth has a figure who could fly. You can find that almost all superheroes in modern day fiction have an ability to fly, either on ther own or through devices. I don't know about girls, but I know every boy's fondest ambition in his childhood would have been to be a pilot. I had it too. Fascinated by planes, I recall reading a lot of books on flying and planes. I used to tear off pages from notebooks to make planes. I would then go to the top floor and let go of these paper machines. As our house lay adjoining a cemetery, it was pretty much an open space. I was so much into planes that I did not use written and used paper. All my planes were of the purest paper, cut with precision and folded with care. I had drawings of various paper plane models. I learnt the laws of aerodynamics, thermal drifts and properties of paper in my quest to make the perfect paper plane. People say try and try again. I did, meeting failure on several occasions and learning from them. I now can make the perfect paper plane. But it will not fly. The course of my various experimentations has allowed me to understand the laws of physics well. I knew what goes up must come down. The trick was to slow down that law of Newton. I learnt about ballasts. I designed planes that could fly for a few metres in a straight line and then plummet down to the ground head first. I called them missiles or suicide bombers. I learnt about aerodynamics. I then made planes that would land gracefully like a swan. Modelled on the now grounded Concorde, these planes could land perfectly. Fighter aircraft are a complex piece of machinery, but extremely maneouverable. I wanted to make a plane that would be as maneouverable as a fighter jet. Trials after trials, reams and reams of wasted paper finally gave birth to a plane that could fly and turn as smooth as a fighter planes. I realized that a simple cuts in paper could be folded and they could act as rudders or aerofoils. I could make a plane move in what ever way I wanted by simply adjusting these small flaps. I could make it glide in circles in both clockwise and anticlockwise directions. I could make them rise high and swoop down like an eagle in pursuit of its prey. Aileron rolls were a breeze. 180 degree turns were hard, but after innumberable tries I got it right. After all these years, I still wonder why I didn't pursue it as a career. Maybe some things were just meant not to be.

 This is how google looks today.. See Google's logo for the centenanary of flight urlLink here . PS: This may not appear properly if u r not looking on the posted date... (But not sure of this...)

 This is yet another easy question to answer kishore. So, as long as yo have time to answer, the answer exists....Even if no answer exists, "No Answer" turns to be the answer (from the answering person's point of view)...he he he he...

 Is there a distinction between... 1. Easy questions to answer and, 2. Questions easy to answer

 Dravid the formidable wall, send each ball of the Kangroos to the wall(Fence) Agarkar cared on the Aussies through this bowling Finally 1 question, Greg Chappel says " In Adelaide no one crosses 200 by batting second" "Hey, My prince's team will do it man " says Geoffrey Boycott In the end, Greg Chappel was not in the Commentary Box. Ravi Shastri, Harsha Bhogle searched him Finally, Chappel returned with the injured Mcgrath and Lee and Says " Indian Team Beware" Sourav, Why can't u turn these aussies history Upside Down! We are with you.

 Oops, i thought let me post a word about the match but then before me, there is a flurry of posts. so let me stop it! And ya Kicha, these days, ur style is good. I enjoyed reading ur blog on this match! Keep it up........

 India had traditionally been known to be vulnerable away from home, with a bowling which lacked enough punch to take 20 wickets in a test and batsmen who awkwardly revolved around repeated gutsy knocks by Tendulkar and played second fiddle to him... When India toured Australia in 1999-2000, the commentators at Channel Nine (Bill Lawry, Tony Greig et. al.) named the Indian team "Tendulkar Ganguly"... as these were the only 2 players who withstood the ravaging pigeon called McGrath and the wizardry of Warne... Come 2003, and things seemed hardly changed. This was despite a team which showed its class with a record breaking win against England in the Natwest Series, followed that up with Test victories against West Indies, Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe and England away from home, and reaching the finals of cricket's biggest event... and helping such onlookers was India's below par performance at home against New Zealand and Australia earlier this year. They were written off even before the series started... and the warm-up games didn't help their cause either... After all, what could a bunch of men who thrived on slow low tracks at home have done to the might of the Aussies at their own backyard... But for once, the answer was different. Rahul Dravid did what the flamboyant Laras and meticulous Kallis'es could not do... A puny Agarkar accomplished what the prodigious Wasim Akrams and the giant Donalds could not accomplish.. After Melbourne, February 1981, the newspapers would again read a similar headline.. only that, this time its Adelaide. When the world least expected, India handed over the Aussies the unique distinction of being the first side in 110 years to lose a Test match after scoring 500+ in the first innings... Hats off to John Wright, who started his coaching career with a sedate test series against Sri Lanka and went on to stop Australia's 17-test winning streak in India and has peaked by questioning the Aussie domination at their own backyward. Saurav Ganguly, deserves praise for the way he has handled this team after taking over the mantle from Tendulkar. His courage and leadership qualities make him stand-out as one of India's finest captains. One could perceive an over-confident arrogance in the Aussie camp when they came out to start every inning. But looking back, they would only be licking their wounds hoping to salvage some of the lost pride at home... India may not go on to win the next 2 matches, but this victory is enough to give the Aussies a few sleepless nights lamenting on what could have been... and reinstate the rightful place of this Indian team in world cricket...!!

 Being sick isn't fun. And working while sick isn't much joy either. I was and still am sick for the past couple of days. I guess it is just my body fighting back for the rest it badly requires. No time for rest also. Reading through the blogs over the past week has brought joy to see atleast one discussion going on, though frankly I didn't understand a single word of it or why I should rejoice or wince at the appearance of my name as an example in the discussion. At the end of it can some one tell me whether I am a multimillionaire or not. I would like to donate a few millions to the upkepp of Bala in a special institution. Since he is worn out by his struggles to make other millionaires. As our recent political dramas have revealed, he again need not worry over Rajesh's political fortunes. He can make money in a political party without being its leader. As I had said, I am going home now to take some rest / read. See you all tomorrow. It was good to see India win comphrehensively, though there were moments towards the end when a couple of wickets went in quick succession. Got to see how the next test on Boxing Day will turn out to be. Sri, If possible, I'll deliver your book in the evening.

 Kudos to our men in Ausi... Broke the 22 years history by beating Ausi in their home land...

 Roses are red Violets are blue, Next to Spinach I Love you. -- Popeye the sailor The story of the violet was a good one. But... again, need to use our discretion in viewing the violet's point... some things in life are highly driven by the circumstance that a similar decision that was a decisive turnaround at one time, could turn out grave at another time...!!

 We have to forgo something to have some other thing.... Whatever it may be Inter DC meet, or Sathyavan Savithri play... By way "I had to accompany my childhood friends during their visit for an Interview all the way from native that too just 2 days trip........." Gud Rini, nice observation, Really gr8 bala... I like it... and how come u r right in taking the 2nd strategy xclusively for me...tnx.... coming to my infy transition from hss.... still the script is in my mind not yet written. will do soon, yeah, I am in project training (knowledge transfer), deputed in n/w mgt. product. Kicha, nice analysis..... Cheers Ram

 That was an etymologically challenging article by Bala. As I think on the crux of the issue, it seems to be either going for "more produce - less quality - less price - more consumers" or "less produce - more quality - high price - less consumers" I guess, there is not too much to choose between the two at first-shot. There are a lot of market driven forces that need to be taken into account as well... Xavier starts to sell the t-shirt for INR 50, without much investment in marketing and brand building, but I have a few more questions to ask. 1. Is he the first one in the business..? If so, well and good... but probably there are roughly atleast 5 other vendors who might price t-shirts as much as Xavier and are thinking of similar strategies as him. And some vendor's additional cash reserves might enable him to invest in building a brand even though it may be a small investment, and it might have the capability to impact xavier's sales. 2. How many direct competitors are there for the product in the region where xavier is concentrating and how many of the "strategy-2" kind of businesses are looking at expanding with a "strategy-1" range of t-shirts. If Xavier is beginning his business with some entries in this scenario, the entire outlook of the business changes. 3. Given the segment and pricing, how long and sustaining could a product be in the absence of investment in designing/R&D/branding etc., over a significant period of time. Once Xavier starts a business, and Ram begins to concentrate on "strategy-2", Bala might get some commission for all his consulting work that he did for them, and build up considerable cash reserves and then start a business of his own choosing a via-media between his two strategies... by going for a larger produce than Xavier, but lesser quality than ramgopal, and priced in between his two counterparts and use his cash reserves in some brand building efforts. And he might showcase his product as "almost as good as Ram's with lesser price" and "much better than Xavier's with a little higher cost". So that he could cater to multiple income groups at one-shot.. and unless Xavier and Ram act quickly Bala is going to suffocate their business... after all, he knows their tricks...

 Hi all, I guess I haven't posted much over the past two weeks. It has been due to some heavy work loads. Rini, that was a wonderful story indeed, I'll let you my thoughts on it later. Meanwhile everyone can have a look at urlLink ROASM . I have been updating it daily and will continue to do so.

 hi friends, though i said i will get back to u all with the story of Satyavan Savitri, i couldnot now, so here is one story which all of u would like reading..... &#39; urlLink The Ambitious Violet &#39; Happy reading! FYI: Violets are flowers, though i exactly dont know how they look like !

 By the way chottu..... Price and quality are directly proportional i believe. I mean they are not two sides of a see-saw. I think its quantity and not quality which should be talked about here.(i mean if u are taking two sides of see-saw). I mean quantity (mass production)against low cost, or quantity (Customised prodn.) against high cost can be two sides of see saw. Is my understanding correct? If its quality, then as far my knowledge goes, Price increases with increase in quality and decreases with decrease in quality. So i opine that they cant be two sides of see-saw (since both sides can't be high or low at the same time except at the equilibrium position which u have said has got nothing to do with the business we are talking about) except for some exceptions.... So bala make me more clear if i go wrong in my words and thoughts. good that u did give us some inputs reg. mktg... too !Good marketing! unlike sri 's glossary..... Btw Sri it can be just a mail from AJK to show that she too is there in the group. Nee pathu pakkathukku adicha glossary vida andha mail evalavo mel. Jax i have replied to ur mail ... Oh kicha, had a nice time at ur Inter DC meet....... So no wonder u dint attend that play. By the way friends, i had been to watch a play &#34;In the Hour of God&#34; which is based on Sri Aurobindo's epic poem &#34; urlLink Savitri &#34; for those who dont know the story of Satyavan savitri, wait for the jist of the story in my next blog..... The play was really very good with all the actors performing so well and excellent accoustics, BGM, good story line and concepts explained in simple words thought it might mean different to different persons based on their level of understanding. Except for few flaws in the framing of some characters and dialogues, the play was almost like a movie. Since its not directly based on the original version of Savitri, but on a reproduced version, virtue of some characters were diluted to suite current day needs which i felt is not needed for such themes. but then, i enjoyed the play like anything, esp. the character of savitri is such a strong character and the actress was damn good in performing, by giving herself to give the character a real soul. Splendid were her expressions as her words spoke of her emotions, and strength of her inner self. Oh kicha and ram, u missed it ya. Ok then will blog u all later till then bye for now!

 Dear Rini, I have sent a mail to your Yahoo id. I forgot your office id. Please reply asap. More later.

 Like Kavi had mentioned there was an inter-DC (Development Center) meet in Bangalore on friday and saturday.. but unlike Kavi had mentioned only Kishore enjoyed it, Ram didn't come... Samavesh means "encompassing".. true to its name, participants from all the development centers had come here... it was one of the best events I've ever witnessed... it had virtually everything u could hope for... the span of events were spread across sports (volleyball, throwball, football, TT etc) to the usual stuff of Antakshari, Dumb C, JAM, Ad Mad etc... Friday evening show was the dance. It was unbelievable to see a bunch of software engineers dance like true professionals.. it was not just a shake of hips... every team had chose a theme for the dance... and presented them very meticulously... Saturday, there was even more in store.. the antakshari made everyone remain on their toes... How in the world do they remember so much songs..!! The quiz was both informative and interesting... there were lots of animated moments that only a "live" audience could ever enjoy... We (people like me) did our part too.. even though we were not taking part in any event, we were the ones who added color to the show with our "cheering-up"... shouting at the top of our voices.. The team from Chennai had brought in drums and a huge flag... it was more like sitting among a crowd watching cricket match... Nandan was in the middle for sometime during quiz... as he kept his first step on the stage.. the drums began to roll... and we were not far behind... we got empty Kinley bottles and started banging on the tables and chairs... and of course, our voices were at their largest decibels... Nandan was quick to remark with a smile "I never got such a 'lively' welcome in my life...!!" He sure was spot on...!! Saturday evening, as prizes were distributed there was a crackers display.. The sky was lit with color... the darkness could be realised only if someone reminded that it was late evening... night seems to have meekly handed over the baton to the day... it was so colourful that the gifted eyes which were fortunate to witness it were saturated with delight... it was around 9.30PM when everything got over... as the people from other DCs slowly and tiredly walked to their respective buses. They were truely, days to cherish...

 Hi all, Every F5 in our blog screen makes my eyebrow touch my fore hair. Astonishing to see the quantity and the quality of the words. Excellent. Ok me let get in to the stuff before you yawn. I am left at the back seat when I see technological blogs in a sequel. There is no body to advocate on Marketing. Let me lend a hand for Marketing, which is giving me both hands and lifting me up. To my understanding there are not more than two strategies for an upcoming business unit. 1.Manufacture more with low quality, price it less and find more customers. 2.Track down end consumers, manufacture less with higher quality, and price it high. If Kicha puts me a query “ why not manufacture more with good quality and find more customers?” I will reply “ yes da but in this competitive world a penny expended should get 5 in reverse hence being meticulous in every thing we will end up in a mess”. Price and quality are either side of ‘see saw’ if one goes up naturally the other gets down. If Sriprasath argues “why not place equal weights on both sides and keep it stable” I would say “that is not for See saws are made da”. So by now hope you would agree to my two points. That is fantastic. Then, I must proceed to the pro’s and con’s of being one among the two. Now that Xavier has agreed to follow strategy one for his textile business (Coimbatore) I must also convince him that why should he be a part of strategy one. It is because we at India associate value with money and not quality (we means majority) hence xavier can anticipate more customers. Mahendran, his partner might ask me “so what”. He knows that I will convince him by highlighting the following points 1.Marketing expenses will be the lesser in your balance sheet(xavi sells a t- shirt for INR 50 hence people will go for it). 2.There are people to try your new product released in future (he might release a cargo for INJR175). 3.Investment in Brand building isn’t necessary. 4.Rub your huge advertisement costs; it is not necessary (one advt in “dina malar” as T-Shirts at Rs.50 for sale ). 5.Packaging, designing R&D- what do they mean in dictionary? 6.Ambassadors costing crores are out of our game. **( I will give u my call sheets da) So why is Ramgopal pinching my hip on the other side. Oh sorry da I have promised you that the second strategy is the best. This idiot Xavier has told Ram what I have told him. Don’t cry Ram I will justify my stand. We will follow second strategy and soon overtake Xavi’s revenue. Now that we have spent a bit in understanding the Indian customer need We are to manufacture T-Shirts designed in Germany. We will also give them the power of being exclusive. We are creating an excellent advt with Judev as the ambassador. Valli was surprised to see our advt telecasted during India Pak cricket match. So at last Ram has bought me a BMW for being his strategist. Now that I am supposed to address his executives about how we succeeded I am putting the following in my ppt presentation 1.We had priced our product in the skies which balanced all our expenses. 2.We have our showrooms present in all the metropolis hence we have the cream. 3.We have built loyal customers, who are lavish spenders. 4.We concentrate on every single customer, deliver delight and compel him for repeated purchase. 5.We had a “tour urope” scheme for family day in April, carrying them in the “cruise queen” 20 yards lengthier than Titanic. 6.We bagged best design awards from BW. (Oh God now Ram goes multi national).** Being worn out after working for years, making Xavi and Ram the multi millionaires I am unable to help Rajesh for his upcoming Political party. Give me a desk and a chair I need to pen my first book “ who cannot loose”. ** please call toll full number91-98433-36512 for more valid points

 Ram Ram...!!! Get Loans from Ram Ram bank... Its interesting to urlLink read .

 Thank you for visiting urlLink ROASM . And thank for your comments too. As Kicha requested, I've set up a comments module there. You can leave your comments there. Just to clear Rini's doubts, It is not a song, not any translation nor from a book. Please do not ask me any questions on its origins; and I'll tell you no lies. The theme of ROASM is just what its description and title says. Valli, it is quite interesting that you are being kept on your toes.

 Yeah, I forgot this interesting issue......A week back, I was in my school, working in the Lab..... there was pin drop silence...When suddenly, the Lab assisstant, stood up & shouted loudly, "there's a bomb threat & i request everybody to move out of the building immediately".....We started moving, & the fire alarm in all the buildings were turned on.....It was very cold outside, & there was no place to go.......we were asked to go further beyond the parking lots too......Cops were rushing in, Bomb squads with all thier outfits poured in, fire engines were called, everybody was nervous.......In this scenario, we were waiting out, for like one hr....I literally froze, could'nt feel my toes...After one hr, there was an announcement, that it was only a threat & we were all allowed in.....ooooohhhhhh!!! finally could get some warmth....The next day, i got fever & eventually cold & suffered a lot......But, it was an experience....Witnessing those cinematic scenes, in real life......

 Rini, Congrats!!......orae kondattam dhaana?....... Kavi, happy to see more blogs from you & directly from you....ha ha ha...... Ram, mariyaadhaya, Infy experience pathi seekarama blog pannu.......Do you guys meet each other?...You & Kicha?.....Guess, You should be under training now....... Sriprasath, I don't know if that It news is your own research on different issues or just a replica from a magazine. But I can say you, that AOL is worth for its $23.95, when compared to wal-mart's dial-up service. I've had both the providers, in the past (Wal mart's was just for a week, I was really frustrated)....There is a BIG difference in quality, i would say......BTW, Why have you given the same news twice?....If you've missed something, you have the edit option, to add it on, to your previous blog itself...... I was a bit busy with my final exams & the 11th hr assignment submissions.....Yet to be relieved....My exams are over next week...I thought I would'nt be able to blog till then..... But when I read Xavier's "Ranting" , could'nt resist blogging......Who's the gal man?.......I could infer one thing... Of all those, who've read Xavier's other blog, Ram seems to be the one, who's most affected.....Whoz your gal Ram???? Others who have'nt noted this, I would recommend to back to Ram's last blog..... will post my views on "She hated losing. That was the last time I played chess." , in my next blog

 I currently read an article in a magazine that Online Hackers are making serious threats to Online gaming, gambling websites. Recently an online gaming site in US was threatened to pay a sum $50,000 for not bringing the site down. The Company discontented to the request. The site was brought down. Even the Department of IT security services is not able to trace out who is the root cause for the problem. Microsoft has announced a Bonanza price of $5 Million to encourage King of hackers. Currently, Microsoft has planned to prize the hacker with $1 million who traces out the culprit who is responsible for m32.redhot.hack virus in the coming 6 months.(I am happy the software giant can't able to trace out the same). AOL is losing its customers day by day. It has lost most of its customers to cheap dial-up providers. AOL is losing the battle on price. When you have Wal-Mart offering service for $9.94 a month, AOL has a hurdle to clear at $23.95 a month.

 Most of u might know where the Headquarters of Infosys is located. But what you may not know is the long stretch of virtually fatal corridor through which people travel everyday to reach there... I’m talking about the NH – Hosur Road stretch, that connects the "Electronics city" which houses a large number of corporates with the mainland and is fast becoming a leading contender for "the most fatal road" award.. especially for people traveling in 2-wheelers... let alone pedestrians. Three infoscions have met with fatal accidents in that road over the past 1 month. And god knows how many more of other friends... Despite hues by corporate heads including Azim Premji, the Govt responded with hardly a benign reply... It seems to be every man for himself on that NH... As a step to stem this rising menace, we at Infosys have launched a scheme. We call it the Car Pooling ... The number of employees commuting in cars is much of a 3-digit figure with almost as many number of cars. Car Pooling is all about every willing person who has some seats vacant when he drives out, announcing that he has N vacant seats to accommodate that many people... and he goes to place X via place Y at time T... and interested persons can contact him directly and join him to their destination and reach safely to their home. A tyical post would be... Subject: 3 seats available To: Koramangala 3rd Block, Raheja Residency - via: Silk Board, Fern Hills, IGate Contact Person - Sriram (extn. 59121 / mob. 98451-81367) My Car - Light Green Santro Xing, KA-01-A-1672 Location - Parked between Building 20 and 23. Leaving around 8 PM. This "announcing" is enabled by having a new folder specifically for Car Pooling in the Bulletin board, where willing persons can post their willingness or people who want a ride can post their requirements... Now, what does this solve... 1. The number of people taking to 2-wheelers can be reduced this way by optimum use of available vacant seats in cars and thereby reducing traffic risks in the NH. 2. Reduces the internal traffic within the Infosys campus by reducing the number of 2 wheelers getting parked and moved around. 3. Enables people traveling to places not well connected by buses. 4. Facilitates people who may have to travel at an "untimely" time. Today is the first day of its launch and the folder is already brimming with activity... People posting their willingness to take others and also others posting their needs of a ride to some place... There is also an initiative to launch an application in the intranet that will channelise and better organize this entire procedure. Hope, friends in other corporates around this place too start to follow some such means.

 " She hated losing. That was the last time I played chess. " But why..?? I understand, she is everything a woman ought to be.. but why do I need to stop playing chess if she hated losing. If I'm so serious about having a companion for life, the smallest expection I could have from her is, she comforts my sorrows and enjoys my victories as hers, and that I do the same thing with respect to her... Why does it have to be a one-way "giving in"...?? And its obvious that such one-way giving ins are soon going to evaporate as life moves on and responsibilities take the better of the "trying to please her" phase... She might be the most precious jewel I would ever have wanted in my life... but jewels too need polish... (and this holds for the "He" too)... PS: jax, u don't have a comments section (atleast, I could not find), so I've posted my comments about ur urlLink ranting here... -------------------------- Pretty woman, don't make me cry Pretty woman, don't walk away, If that's the way it must be, o.k. I guess I'll go on home, it's late ...but wait What do I see, is she walking back to me? Yeah, she's walking back to me Oh, oh, pretty woman -- From the song "Pretty Woman" by Roy Orbison

 Who is that? Aana ithu thaan saakunnu....unnai neeye Barbarians, Romans'oda ellam compare panniiriye da...hehehehehhe!!! imm...athayum padikkiromla...engala sollanum!!!!! But for that its a nice narration....jax

 Jax kalazita da... well done, ennalla ezhutha mudiyalla, but unara mudiyuthu.... gud, nice one I like it... although time, place, situation differs... it looks simply gr8. Yeah, Rini, bloging will take time, (i have to prepare around 5KB txt, and has to post it... ha ha ha hahahah will try a sat / sun...) Cheers

 The theme of rantings blog is good but then are the articles posted real and is it by u only or .......... pls dont say its a song or any traslation or from a book ok.........

 Hi friends, Ippo thaan naan ram gopallukku sound vidalamnu nenachen, but then adhukkulla avan mail pannittan. So hope to see more blogs from u ram, esp. of ur initial days at infy. And both urlLink Flowers and urlLink Elite Essays blog has been updated. Have a look when time permits. Thanx for ur wishes and bye for now

 As I had quipped earlier, it really thrills me to hear that everyone is going ahead in their careers at full steam. urlLink Rantings of a sane mind has been relaunched with a new theme and look, as I had promised. Have a look at it and tell me your thoughts on it. As we are having a full day meeting at our office, I may not be able to post much. So have a nice day.

 Rini, Congrats!! Really it's nice to hear all the good news from all our friends for the last few months....

 You may have already read this.. but still... this is quite thought provoking enough to repeat... A mechanic was removing a cylinder head from the motor of a Harley, when he spotted a world-famous heart surgeon in his shop. The heart surgeon was waiting for the service manager to come take a look at his bike. The mechanic shouted across the garage, 'Hey Doc can I ask you a question?' The famous surgeon, a bit surprised, walked over to the mechanic working on the motorcycle. The mechanic straightened up, wiped his hands on a rag and asked, 'So Doc, look at this engine. I also can open hearts, take valves out, fix'em, put in new parts and when I finish this will work just like a new one. So how come I get a pittance and you get the real big money, when you and I are doing basically the same work?' The surgeon paused, smiled and leaned over, and whispered to the mechanic..... 'Try doing it with the engine running'. Good one, ain't it... I thought a little more starting from this... will say more about that tomorrow... I'm beside myself today...

 Hi all, Every time we go to a hotel why do we search for a table with unoccupied seats? Chottu

 bye i m leaving da. if possible just inform in the blog that i m going to sivakasi for 1 week. Its possible..!!

 hi friends, i have tried to give a new look to my flowers blog and i was silent for a while in posting to that too.But now i have come up with few posts..... Have a look at all those urlLink flowers . Do comment about it too.

 So.. we have one more.. rini continues to warm herself up bathing in bucketloads of music.. what about others...

 Hei, i was occupied with my Rational training last week and so couldnt blog. But then i will not leave u all without sharing what i did for the past two weeks. first and foremost, i went to a concert. Yes, Pandit Jasraj and L. Subramaniam's concert. I struck with one beautiful feeling. Have u people heard an instrument singing a song, or have u heard anybody's voice echoing like an instrument? Yes, i did. L.subramaniam is a renowned violinist and in his play of bow, u can hear the song just as its being sung. To be frank, i dint even know the verses, but i was carried over by the first Melancholy of his performance. His work was getting improved as it usually happens in any concert in the most unusual manner. Pandit JAsraj's voice toh, was so beautifully orchestrating with the thugs and thumps of Tabela and other instruments and at one point, they both merged and made me feel the oneness too. Both are stalwarts in their domain, Jasraj in hindustani vocal and L.Subramaniam an international violinist. The whole concert was divided into 3 sections where in first panditji perfromed, then L. Subramaniam and then their most awaited "JugalBandhi". JugalBandhi is nothing but, two different artists performing together simultaneously but in sync. I am already mesmerised by Pandit's voice. First I happened to listen to Panditji's voice in his Mandukya Upanishad casette. It was the first avenue for me in Hindustani music and i was spell bound when i listened to his voice. It is liquid gold glowing all the way it goes. I was infact happy to have made acquainted myself to Devotional music thru' such a rich voice, rendition and hymns. There are some voices which sound different in different medias, esp it differs between live and recorded one. but great people's voices are always alike and i experienced it live there in that concert. He was fully vibrating with life of music and though he was turning 75 years, his voice is still the same without any haircrack. They way both were enjoying themselves made the audience to enjoy them also along with music. Panditji has got a smiling face and so he was in full smile after every line..... And so after every play of bow, L.S. also, though looks resolute, gave a mild smile unique but marvellous by its own. When the show was over, audiences couldnot resist themselves and they gave a standing ovation and cried for once more. Never have i seen such a response from audience. Infact when they were carried away by the artists and they lauded it with claps, even it was musical. And to our surprise, after sometime, it was S.M.Krishna who was amongst us enjoying the show. Hei i dint tell u where we sat na... When we went to the concert, the tickets were sold out and so we dint know what to do. So we waited to know any means to get inside. The concert which was about to start at 6 o clock started at 7. There were so many musical enthusiasts like us waiting outside. So the manager, made some arrangement. Yes, we were allowed to sit on the dias, just few foot away from the artists. No ticket fare too. I was amazed, since we were the first on the dias and were placed perfectly. God, All the performers and CM of the state were standing just a foot away, but since music seemed to occupy my mind , it dint strike me much at that moment. Only aftersometime, i felt how lucky we had been. good was that evening! Rest of the events i will blog later Ranjini

 The coconut oil which was frozen when I left for Madurai last week is liquified now... Bangalore is warming up... and so are some of our people... to face the higher challenges in life and career... Jax, is commencing his MCJ course, Bala is looking forward to Brand Management... Bala, I had a look at the ICFAI site about the course.. seems impressive as far as the course structure goes... so its just the decision of spending that u need to consider... if u feel u can eke out the required fee and also confident of doing full justice to studying the course amid ur work right at this moment, then u can go ahead applying for the forthcoming academic year itself... Myself and Kavi will be starting our MCAD preparation soon... But I don't have an option of thinking if I can do it now or later.. its been made mandatory for me... and I have registered for my first (of three) papers for April... so I have 2 months in between to prepare whatever I can, and then need to finish the next 2 papers within 3 months after clearing the 1st paper... otherwise we won't get the fee reimbursed... Kavi too will be beginning soon... So.. anyone else looking to warm yourself up this summer...

 Hello chaps & lasses, Captivated by Brand management I am hunting for a distance course from a recognized university. ICFAI has a course on the same for Rs.25k but is it worth doing? or is there anyother option? Bala

 As I had said, earlier, all my book reviews will be available at urlLink QSS . I have posted a review of a book, "Blue Horizon" by Wilbur Smith there. I sat up till 3:30 am to finish the book. Update : I have posted the review of "Last Reveille" by David Morrell. I finished it yesterday afternoon.

 Hi all, Thanks for your inputs regarding the resume. Also there seems to be a lot of TW opportunities available for the taking. Rini, I visited the link you specified. they don't seem to have a requirement in their opportunity list. As for today's Hindu, could someone send the details to me. The versions and opportunity listings differ from city to city. Could someone also check urlLink this company . Looks good, still better to be safe. Rini, I don't remember the name of the school. But I think it was not the school you had mentioned. I'll try to recollect if possible. Bala, the format of the resume is to mimic the XML format. It is not XML , da. It is pure XHTML . Putting it in XML sounds good. Let me see if that is possible.

 It is not for HRs to check and entreat me to join thier comapny. For them, I'll be adding a proper word and pdf resume for download. This is just a format I saw somewhere and liked. This is just for fun. you might see it vary over the days to come.

 i think jax in ur previous post about IIT u had talked about urlLink this school. Its by one of the prominent writer J.Krishna murthy. I was also happy to read an article about it some time back in one journal, when they had described the way the school functions. Yes, minimum peer pressure and equipping the students with kinds of skills necessary for leading a better life. wish i too had studied there.

 Starting from colors, till the content....... all are good and impressive, though i dint read it word by word. But first impression was really good ya. Keep it up. Looks very decent and pleasant, but then how far it will be legible to the HR's who are the ones who will receive ur resume is a small question which popped in my mind and so think about it too. If he happens to be a techie guy with a little sweep on mark up langauages, then he will surely be happy to have u, but other way?

 urlLink www.intotoinc.com checkout this site, Techwriter 1 year exp. they have asked. Or check out today's hindu opportunities for more info.

 Jax I could find XML tags also when I go the resume link. Anyway good work. Balachander

 Blog is proceeding towards a peculiar direction after recent deviation in the discussion Posts...........

 Hope you received my mail to xavierroyATtechnicalwriting.com By way the job u referred in the urlLink link is not available in the emp. ref. scheme.

 Ram, Kindly check this urlLink link and tell me if this job is listed out in Infy's intranet, for employee referral.

 Dear all, I will not be able to access my postmark account today. So send your mails to xavierroyATtechnicalwriting.com. Ram, could you send me a mail there. There is something Kicha wanted you to do for me. BTW, I have added two new pages to QSS. One is an urlLink about page and the other is a urlLink resume . Check it out. Both pages are still works-in-progress. Tell me how it looks in your machines.

 urlLink Kerala village plans unique protest against Coke urlLink Soft drinks, hard truths Hi all, This is not a cry from the conservatives. Just think mates. Instead of spending 10 rupees on a coke or pepsi we could opt for a tender coconut or some fresh juices that is not only good for our health but also adds value to our urge to make up an eco friendly living... Just think a moment I have made up a resolution and have said a no to soft drinks and in particular coke and pepsi. Bye for now. "A change starts from within"

 Today, got my id card for my MCJ Course. It sure feels kinda funny, playing the role of a student again.



 The number of IIT s have increased. Good to hear that. The number of colleges and universities (including deemed univs) have increased. Nice. The UGC has mae it compulsory for faculties to pass either SLET / NET . Wonderful. But where are those bright graduates, the future architects of India? I can agree with the later part of the article - IITs being the only advanced educational model. There may be other models, like CEDs for example. But I feel that the refinement of the education model has to be from the grassroot level. There is no use trying to improve only the creme de la creme . We have been following a mish-mash of education patterns, some practices handed down by tradition and some copied from other influences. The education system should be more life-oriented, i.e. more education that would be useful practically need to be taught. I am not advocating total westernisation of education, but instead a ecletic adoption of best educational practices . I believe there is one such school somewhere in Chennai. I don't know its name. But the education system followed sounded good. Students studying there might not go on to be engineers or doctors, but they can handle the challenges of life more comfortably than thier peers in professional streams. BTW, western institutions have become great institutions over the years because the sense of 'alma mater' was high among the students. The students did thier best to build up the institution that had taught them, through whatever means they could, from monetary funds to physical labour. Somehow, I find that sense of giving back is mostly missing in our country. That could be a reason why the IITs (no, the entire education sector) looks hoary.The final words, "educators and lay people would consider India's future educational needs", is the point that one should ponder upon from the article. All said and done, it is interesting why this issue has come up with the elections just round the corner? Maybe this speech by Joshi is slated to appear in the election agenda? Maybe someone really cares... Maybe... Kicha, Thanks for sending the article by mail.

 The Laws of Explanation are simple. I guess everyone can guage thier meaning. The person who gave the Laws is Tim Bray, the founder of XML . He had postulated the two laws when he faced a particular problem understanding how a software worked. Here is the explanation he gave for the first Law. When you’re explaining something to somebody and they don’t get it, that’s not their problem, it’s your problem. The practical take-away from this law is that for anything that’s deep enough to matter, you’re going to have to do a lot of explaining, and you absolutely totally can’t afford to get impatient or irritated when it isn’t going fast enough, you just have to explain better. This is difficult, but not all that difficult. People who can’t get their message across usually don’t get too far in this world, so anyone who’s making an impact almost by necessity combines the articulateness and patience to (eventually) get the job done. The Second Law is When someone’s explaining something to you and you’re not getting it, it’s not your problem, it’s their problem. The practical take-away is that you have to be totally courageous and truthful in saying “I don’t understand; please explain again.” Otherwise you won’t get the message and you’ll be the loser. As far as I know, I felt that these two laws were somehow related to everything we do. Additionally, I thought that it perfectly matched what we had been discussing arguing discussing earlier. As for the Delta Law, I had given a small description about the Law below the law itself. So I don't think I should repeat myself. Hope you remember what " po " means. The Delta law was just another form of that po . I find this law very useful when I come up against a wall in my mind. This is more related to problem solving and creativity. The above two postings did not have any significance with the recent events. But Bharucha's Law was a quote I posted. I can't explain why. But maybe later. Manny, they are not about, 'unseen words'. It is about understanding the context in which the message is conveyed. A somewhat complex repostulation of the Theory of Communication (Claude Shannon/ Networks). Here is one more law I guess that might need no explanation. Anything that can be misunderstood will be. - urlLink David G. Myers BTW, could someone mail (postmark id) me a copy of the rediff article, not the link but the entire article? I cannot access Rediff at office. That was a good point on CED. I don't know about the quality of the course right now. But it definitely could not have got much better than ours. BTW, here is the link to urlLink Brahmos website. I had a couple of book reviews written down. But I decided to post it to urlLink QSS as it offers a category-wise listing. Here onwards, please find my book reviews urlLink here .

 ...all said and done, there is a thing which still makes the difference. As I said we could have had 1000 CEDs for one IIT. But the difference would have been, as we had one IIT, it lasted for few decades and still there alive and on the other hand probably if we have had 1000 CEDs then none would have lasted longer as it happened with our CED. mrchhhhh!!!!

 I was just reading the article in rediff.com about this IIT brand and its there now in our blog. Of course one cannot deny that IITs are really worthy feathers in India’s cap. But the irony is that all the birds of the same feather flocks together not for the goodness of our community but rather the IIT brains are patented almost by someone who can afford to it. And Its my opinion that instead of having one IIT we could have had 1000 CEDs. It was rightly put by Murali Manohar Joshi that the huge amounts spent on IITs did not yield the expected ROI. Reason being the product we produced was not realized for our benefits. I often wonder why the kind of bullet trains that was there in Japan was not here in India. It is not the lack of ability for such a country like India, which was able to produce supersonic BrahMos Missiles, to implement the bullet trains. Rather, the bullet trains may not be a viable means for today’s Indian Mass. The same is the case with IITs. Its not that we were not able to afford to employ an IIT product but rather the IIT product itself was not a need for today’s (or probably the near past) Indian mass. Of course it was the power of knowledge that makes what you see as today’s India. But as you see these developments was not because of the knowledge produced by the IITs. Rather it was due to the rest of IITs, which has the lion’s share for this upsurge in our development. I have seen people doing research in big heads like IITs and IGIDR still researching the Great Depression of 1930s and getting a hefty monthly grant for what they do like a conventional report generation. On a personal note, I feel that, for such huge investments and grants on IITs and other such premier institutes, The ROI should have been even more and who knows…had IITs been with a private professional hand, the output would have been different.

 A very different view about our famed IIT... read urlLink full-story ... What do u feel about this... But is the IIT model the only, and best, model for advanced education? Probably not. This is why I say the IIT model is aging. It is a fact that the IITs have not really kept up with the times........ ...........But as far as I know, not a single IIT has a well regarded program in any of the great new frontiers of technology, in particular in biotechnology. Nor in nanotechnology, in new power technologies such as hydrogen fuel cells, in any cutting edge area, really. Why is this? One reason is that they are insulated from the market, as they are guaranteed a Rs 75 crore grant from the government every year.

 Laws of Explanation works urlLink Now Kicha u had the courage to say "I cant understand, Please Explain" Now its explanator's turn....Le'me wait :)

 Why is there an avalanche of laws and theorems suddenly propping up in our blog... is it just a spontaneous flow or is there anything specific that needs to be understood (apart from their literal meaning) from these laws... If there is none, then just ignore my thoughts.. if there is anything, then please do convey.. Because I'm not understanding that...

 "To understand what people are thinking and feeling, look beyond what they say." Does this sounds like seeing the unseen words jax...?

 To understand what people are thinking and feeling, look beyond what they say. Language does not capture the full range and grain of thought and experience, and its unique power enables us as easily to mask our thoughts and feelings as it does to express them. - urlLink Jamshed Bharucha In case you didn't know, this blog now has an Atom urlLink feed . IF you don't know what Atom is, read about it urlLink here .

 Interesting point by Bala.. In this context, macroscopic thinking is not what is aimed at.. but the attitude of a customer and how a salesperson could prevail over him... Even in our daily routines our efforts are more at proving others wrong rather than substantiating why I could be right... Its simple human psychology... We always tend to feel we know just that little bit more than others and in our enthusiasm to demonstrate our efficacy we forget our good points and start targetting the other person's points should we feel them conflicting... But the ideal way to deal with the situation is to render enough leeway to the other person's ideas too and extrapolate it with our own points and refine an inference... Its never going to be easy to change what could already have been a "well-thought-out" decision by a customer... It pays to dispense with some of our ego and go down to the lees in making more sense of our points rather than offending his ego by snubbing his views... It does take more effort, time and patience to bring the subject under our sway, but its far more effective than the "blind denial" method...

 As you said the salesman might lose the customer. He might just move off to the next shop to buy Timex. If you looking at it from just the viewpoint of the cutomer and a sales person, it is the customer who wins. Maybe by following your approach, the salesman may gain a customer. But if you look at it from a macroscopic POV, the Tata Group wins both ways. As Timex and Titan are part of the same Tata Group. Was the usage of both brands done intentionally or a wrong choice of watch brands? If you purposely used Timex and Titan brands, what I said above holds true. If it was unintentional, just ignore the previous para and brush up on company information (just an advice). So it depends on what you see and where you see yourself. That is what I see from your post. BTW: Ranjini didn't you feel that the movie storyline was very similar to 'Dhalapathy'. You noted tinges of Mahabharatha. I noticed tinges of "Ronin". A Google search would allow you to note the allegories of the film with the story of 47 Ronin. What happened to "Virumaandi"? I expected at least a couple of reviews. As I was sick, I was unable to complete my review. It might be ready by tomorrow mostly. As for my banglore trip details, they are not ready yet. But on my train journey to Bangalore, I had a lot of spare time to write. I chose an hour's journey. It is just a description of an hour's journey. I started writing at 4:45 pm and stopped at 5:55pm. You can read it urlLink here . A funeral procession I saw while journeying, inspired me to write urlLink this . I still have got a few more of my writings I did on the train. I'll have to type them in first. I am a very slow typist.

 Hi all, Our current crush made to re examine what we have done and that throwed light upon few of the blues. When two persons have different views and they talk to each other. We are more interested in proving the others point wrong rather than proving why we are right? (including me)This gives me an excellent overview of a sales call. Imagine a guy walks to a watch show room and asks for a Timex watch. Sad that the shop does hold Titan pieces alone. How do u think the discussion proceed? The sales person would criticise his decision to buy a Timex. He thinks that when u prove that his decision is wrong he might sell his Titan to him. But when u put your legs on the customer shoes. He will have his legs burried to Timex. we must understand that before the customer has decided to buy a Timex there would have been a process strating from Should I buy? what to buy? Which to buy? How do I buy? Where do I buy? How much do I buy? After having analysed he himself confines to Timex. When we try to prove him wrong it disturbs his ego and thus we end up losing a customer. But understand he can be convinced at any point of time to have a deviation from what he has decided. This is where the role of the Sales Man comes in. Imagine if the Sales person convinces the customer by putting "sir though Timex is good Titan would be a better option because...' Do u think we will not make a Sale here????? Balachander

 Rini, Just now I watched the movie last night. I thought I may be able to give a review by tomorrow. But you beat me to it. Ram, should your post title be related to the laws rather than to Delta. I expected a better answer to the question. Try again, Who is Tim Bray?

 Those who explain can’t afford to get impatient or irritated when it isn’t going fast enough, they just have to explain better. So anyone who’s making an impact almost by necessity combines the articulateness and patience to (eventually) get the job done. Those who can't understand should have the courage to say, “I don’t understand; please explain again.” Tim Bray is not a lawyer, but have enough exposure to the field of Intellectual Property to have developed immense respect for its complexity and subtleties.

 Tomorrow I'm going for a project party... Yippeee...!! This will be my first project party in over 14 months of infy life... we don't have any project parties in my department (SETLabs) as we don't do projects in its literal sense and so there is no budgetary allocation for such parties... The current project I'm supporting will finally be giving me a taste of it... Kavitha has gone for atleast 3 parties in 9 months at infy and ram went for a party in his very first week... so this becomes very significant for me...!!

 Zwick(Director) explores an interesting idea of an American Civil War veteran who is finding it difficult to shake off his own battlefield demons, drawn into yet another civil war.We first see Capt Woodrow Algren (Tom Cruise) punishing himself with too much alcohol and self-pity. He is performing a one-man show in San Francisco to sell Winchester rifles. We slowly understand that he has been traumatised by the massacre of an Indian village carried out under the command of Col Bagley (Tony Goldwyn).Yet Bagley is not out of Algren's life. He and another army officer Zebulon Gant (Billy Connolly) persuade Algren to train the conscript army of the Japanese emperor who wants to modernise his country.Algren realises quickly he is against formidable odds. One of them is posed by a band of samurai lead by Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe). Early in the movie, Algren is wounded and captured by the samurai. When Katsumoto spares Algren's life despite the harm he has inflicted on Katsumoto's men, the film begins to take a predictable turn. We now suspect the two foes are going to change their hearts towards each other. In one of the film's unbelievable sequences, Katsumoto even lodges Algren with his sister, Taka (Koyuki), the widow of the samurai the American had killed. Even then, things are not going to be easy for Algren. For he has to take a lot of beatings from one of his bitter foes among the samurai, Ujio (Hiroyuki Sanada). Soon Algren goes with Katsumoto to Tokyo for a political showdown with the emperor (Shichinosuke Nakamura) and businessman Omura (Masato Harada), who wants to modernise Japan. But Algren suspects he is doing it for his own personal gains.In Tokyo, Katsumoto is arrested and offered the choice of taking his own life. Algren and the other samurais free Katsumoto and they flee from the imperial army. But they know they will have to confront the emperor's large and comparatively modern army. A big challenge to the two men is how to neutralise the big guns so the Samurai can have an advantage in hand-to-hand combat.

 Guyes, better we would hav gone for this movie! Watch "The last samurai" . Classic movie talking about Japanese warriors -samurai. Beautiful movie, with good music and good acting and on top of all, excellent theme. The core is similar to what happens in Mahabharatha. Yes, When the japanes king decides to modernise his army, the warriors riot against it (not just like that, but since he employs modernisation in a way against their core values). The samurai leader, though the teacher of the king, cannot correct the king when his student(the king) takes a wrong decision. This is similar to all those great stalwarts in the Hastinapur, who were unable to educate dhuriyodhana when he decides to fight against pandavas. Ultimately, the samurai leader gives his life for his cause and only then the king realises his state. But by then, they had lost the entire set of legendary warriors. Excellent are the dialogues, though u need to have an idea of the subject dealt. If u see, superficially, u might think, y these samurai's are fighting against the king, but they do, coz, he does so without understanding the age old tradition of fighting and he takes up the words of those who work for their own welfare rather than the nation. Samurai forces were built to protect the nation and there lies the entire interest. But the king is interested in just modernising and strengthening the army with more arms and ammunitions and training them. so there comes a conflict in his motive of modernising and doing it at the cost of losing the tradition. But what is their tradition, that u will have to grasp from the movie! So do film it and view it ya. Hei u know what guys............. yesterday i went to a concert ya. To Pandit Jasraj and L. Subramniam's concert. Both are stalwarts, the former in Hindustani Vocal and the later an international Violinist. We dint get tickets, but then we waited and atlast succeeded in getting seated on the dias. Excellent was the concert! Simply amazing were both performers and i was filled with ecstacy!will share about my experience in my next blog. My training in RUP(Rational Unified Process) started today and will go on for the next two weeks. Ok then meet u all later Ranjini

 I already have Framemaker. I am about to start downloading Robohelp. Don't worry. I am at iway. The speeds are amazingly fast as I had said to you earlier. You said you had some documentation on FM. How big is it? I am in Yahoo Messenger now. I'll be online probably for the next hour or so fiddling with the templates.

 Jax, I have got that Robohelp and Adobe Framemaker software with me... I downloaded the trial version from the sites and having it in a CD. I dont know how could I send those files to you as they both combined comes to around 470 MB. Ok. If you have got any idea tell me so that I can send it to you.

 I am officially on leave today. I am typing this after a visit to the doctor. Interestingly, checking my mail, I came across a quote that was sent to me. It goes like: Delta's Law There are three sides to every story. The Greek letter delta is a symbol for change in formulas. This triangle can be taken personally to create a philosophy that can be used as laws. For example, the 3 points of a triangle create a possibility space for change. Two points in a debate provide nothing more than a tyranny of dichotomies, whereas adding a third possibility is always more interesting, and closer to the true complexity of life. Does anyone have any opposing views that this law isn't valid?

 The First Law : When you’re explaining something to somebody and they don’t get it, that’s not their problem, it’s your problem. The Second Law : When someone’s explaining something to you and you’re not getting it, it’s not your problem, it’s their problem. So I guess it must be my problem on both counts. So much for playing advocatus diaboli . Since you guys wanted something interesting, the above two laws are from Tim Bray. Any guesses on who he is?

 There is a difference between arguing and discussing. I am interested in discussing. Who else is?

 This blog is not the only source from which one can know things nor this is the only gateway to the outside world… rather the purpose of this blog itself is not to know all the things in its entirety… coz one couldn't... ofcourse getting views from others enrich one's knowledge... but also "Sometimes missing things leads to fortune actions..." see...others are peaceful "as others have missed to participate in this silly issue" My request is to remove all these from the blog and from archives as I want all others to miss all these nonsense... Bye bye Manny

 ... I should be going to a girl I had never even laid my eyes on before in my life and say 'I love you' to her. I don't know about you. But I have never believed in love at first sight. Maybe you were talking about some other form of love here. I guess you might be speaking from experience regarding unseen words. Manny, I am glad that you know what a team means. As for the part about reaching out to the world, As you had said, I could have done anything with this blog. But I am interested in getting everyone's views before that, not two or three. Anyway for your information, neither Rini nor Srini was interested in enrolling Srini as a member. It was I who requested if we can have him. Since you asked why I haven't added anyone who had asked me to join this blog, I'll tell you the reason. What happened in the past few days is why. I had this plan for sometime as I had explained earlier. I was just wondering if I should tell everyone as a responsible person or just add them and then let you know. I guess now after reading the posts for the past few days, I wouldn't surprised if they decide not to accept the invitations. Surely I wouldn't after all this hullaboo. As I said in my post, you never knew what you are missing.

 i am not interested in knowing what a team is all about from u jax... U said... I have been getting mails from several people asking me to enroll them in the blog. These people were not from msitmmb. I have had requests from U.K., U.S., even one from South Africa and Australia, other than India. The people seem to be interested in joining the blog and participating. Its as simple as that... why is that u did not have the time to add those to the team...? You cud have reached out to the world by then...ha ha ha ha ha ha... Then coming to the unseen words... Jax try saying "I Love You" to a girl ( cute pretty girl) whom you dont know and see what happens... Of course "I love You" is not an offensive phrase as such and could convey a number of meaning... But when said to a girl what wud be the predominant message conveyed....? ha ha...The slap in your cheek could say u the meaning... I can go on substantiating futher and i can address ur questions...but later...bye bye. I am retiring...

 Manny, what does a team mean? "A group of people working towards a common goal". Is that right or do you have any other connotations for a team? As per my earlier post, the description suits the blog aptly. So I am not changing it. BTW, I noticed the lack of the word, 'msitmmb' in the blog description. I cannot see it. Can you? If people want to read unseen words and meanings, it is not going to be the writer's responsibility. Yeah, it was me who ' urlLink presumed ' that everyone could belong in a group. Maybe I was wrong in that. Going by your " urlLink Ennamo ponga " post, I suppose I am not allowed to discuss anything about the blog with anyone else. Am I seeing a sort of NDA here? I cannot post what, say my girlfriend or parent feels about a particular issue, just because it is someone else's thoughts. Isn't that what you were trying to say? Coming to the point of one's views, what do you mean by 'one's view'? If you say, it is your point of view. I have a question, Is that an original thought? Did you think about it, all by yourself, without being influenced by others? (I mean by another person's views through any communication media.) If it was influenced by some other person, it never was your thought at all. I am going too philosophical here, I guess. As for the rest of my post, I feel it is relevant to the blog in terms of ideas, influences, and quite a lot of things. As you said it has been precipated by the recent issue, but this has been on my mind for quite some time. That was why I took two days to respond. But before that, I would like to hear from everyone.

 I am not afraid and so do all I hope... But Jax please change the blog description and make the blog public... It wud be apt as per ur previous post goes... This blog description below wud have made me and some others feel the way they are now... "just a team weblog about our work, lives, hopes, dreams, disappointments, disasters, and any other issues that we get time to discuss on." For the rest that u have discussed....I hope its irrelevant to the present issue and its neither ranjini nor the others who wanted srini to be included in the blog but its u who presumed that he cud be in our group...It is not a no to srini but in generic terms this means something in general though the reason for this issue cud be out of srini... ok Bye bye

 No wonder Sriprasath left this group...!! ~~~~~~~~~~ The way to become boring is to say everything. -- Voltaire

 I want this blog to be closed for non MSITMians. Hey wait a minute. Who said something about this blog being only for msitmmbians? I never mentioned it when the blog was started. Did anyone else specifically mention that this was only for msitmmbians? I don't think so. I just checked the archives. I found no body saying that this is a limited membership blog. I am not participating just because the topic is interesting and the discussion is good. But because it is we discussing good topics. Bala, if this is the core reason for your objection, I guess you might have selective amnesia. We have a group called urlLink msitmmb for discussing. We have had discussions in them in the past. So why don't we continue using it. The members are limited to only those who had studied M.S. (IT&M) between 2000 and 2002 at Madurai Kamaraj University. It is everything you want except of course the participation part . Why do you need a blog when you have a group? The raison d'etre for this blog is to be a medium where everyone can post thier views and be subjected to criticism/praises. Since a blog is put onto the Internet, everyone has the right to praise or criticise it. I hope you understand what I am speaking about. It works quite wonderfully. Let me give an example. A few months ago, I posted a link to a urlLink CSS House . The designer had mailed me saying that I had projected misleading information. I said that I may be right and sent him a few screenshots. Accordingly, he used the screenshots to improve his design. That is what the web is about - improving people and lives. I recall having telling a few of you that I have been getting mails from several people asking me to enroll them in the blog. These people were not from msitmmb. I have had requests from U.K., U.S., even one from South Africa and Australia, other than India. The people seem to be interested in joining the blog and participating. At first, I had my doubts about them. But on frequent correspondence with them over a period of time, I found that the blog would do great with them participating. I recall a mail I had sent to the 'msitmmb' group. I used the following words (with special emphasis): "If you want to become a member, the only requisite is 'active' participation. The blogger group is not a form of elite group where only a few are welcome ." Everyone agreed to it, if I remember. Now what happened to you? Selective Amnesia? If we had no faults, we should not take such pleasure in calling attention to other people’s . - Francois La Rochefoucauld Incidentally, reading of what a few of you had to say about Rini posting a few of Srini's comments. I feel that what you say is not appropriate. I had posted quite a few citations and quotations like the one above. So do you object saying that I am using someone's observations, instead of my own? Can someone clarify this point? So let me be clear on a few points. The blog was never meant to be only for msitmmbians. Those who want to cater to only a select few like your classmates, please use the msitmmb or mail them individually. Do not post it here. Since the blog is on the Internet, I feel anyone has the right to complain/congratulate anything being said on the blog. If you cannot stomach that thought, it is your problem, not some one else's. Everyone has the right to substantiate what they say. The sources can be from anywhere ,from websites, books, other people (both living and dead), as long as they cite the source and do not alter it to suit thier purpose. Since I brought up this issue in the first place, I did it in the hope of improving everyone. I never thought a few had this idea of the blog being a elite group. They may not know what they are missing out. because there are things you never knew you never knew . I don't know if the blog has helped anyone else. But it surely helped me in understanding quite a lot of things. I expect it to do so in the future too. I don't want to enclose myself within a small limited circle. I want to reach out to the world. A blog is a wonderful tool to do so. That was one of the reasons why I started " urlLink Quod scripsi scripsi ". I am not afraid of being criticised for my thoughts, my ideas. I can accept it from anyone. That is why I have enabled comments in that blog. The question is " Are You Afraid? "

 Lines from Novel Anna Karenina All splendid if only the work had been done for themselves, or for themselves and comrades --people in sympathy with them. - Leo Tolstoy But are we working the way its described here? And will it be splendid only if its worked as said above? The above lines are spoken by a peasant to the landlord who struggles to manage his farm and his labourers and sets out to find a new method to do the management.

 There is nothing wrong in presenting ones views as long as he is a member of this blog. If I go on and present the views of the non-bloggers with whom I have my contacts, then it would be like taking our parliamentary affairs to the United Nations Security Council!!!!!!! This is a simple matter…but still a matter of privileges… Hope you people should be remembering a day when our Chitra Mam wanted to be a member of our msitmmb group during the end of our course. We said “NO” to include her in the group, though she wanted to come in our group in order to keep in touch with us…isn’t it… Bye bye then guys and gals…

 I take an opposite stand in this regard. I am not participating just because the topic is interesting and the discussion is good. But because it is we discussing good topics. The sense of being among professionals backed by the synergy we had created for years is what which keeps me ticking in the blog. If suppose it was an X blog with unknown members and the same kind of discussion prolongs for sure I would not be so interested... I cannot go to US for their economy is growing good and feel happy. Rather I am appreciating the growth of India being in India. did I make sense?

 Friends, i am not much interested in if the blog is to be open or close. I will be interested in discussing things if the topic is of my interest. And so wont i, if i feel its not in my domain. Rather than who speaks, what he speaks matters more for me, so make it open or close, i am not much worried.

 Bala, I guess you can post a list of reasons why this blog should be open to only msitmmbians? Others can post thier views as well ( Should the blog be open to only msitmmbians or to everyone? ). It would be better if we can list the reasons down. It would be easier to discuss them point by point and also we would not be reiterating the same again and again. I'll post mine soon, mostly by today.

 Hope they are OK now.

 Hi jax, the links are not that visible until u move the cursor on it. I was really fooled i can say, coz i thought those 4 lines itself was an essay and only when u people were discussing on Saturday, i came to know that u had provided a link there. So make it more legible.

 Hi all, Jax I am not interested in having Srini in our member list. Not that because it is Srini but anyone who is !M.S(It&M) I will have a no entry board. Sorry Ranjini , as because I thought he is unnoticed I welcomed him. But if u ask me can he be here I will definitely have a BIG NO. I want this blog to be closed for non MSITMians. Hope Ranjini doesnt mind. comments welcome. Balachander

 Sorry to disturb the discussion in the middle. A long time dream of mine has finally come true. A urlLink Movable Type blog. I had been waiting to try it out for a long, long tiem, well almst a year to get my hands on a blog running on MT. After a couple of tries, I finally got a free hosting at urlLink Weblogs.us . Pongal seems to be a start of a good month. Initally, I am transporting my " urlLink Quod scripsi, scripsi " blog from urlLink Blogger to urlLink jaxsays.weblogs.us . I have not transferred the entries there completely. Just to keep you informed, I have posted a poem there. Hope you like it. Please update your bookmarks to the new site. Bye and have a happy Pongal. Jax.

 Where did I come from..? Why am I here..? Where am I going from here..? Why does the Universe exist..? These are hardly the tip of an ice berg... submerged deep inside is the rejoinder to these imposing questions... and every attempt to reveal the concealed always leave us with another new vaccuum to encounter... Over the centuries, the human mind has been so much impounded with presumptuous attitudes that the closer we try to move to an answer the farther it gets... Questions keep cropping up about the most fundamental pillars of our belief systems and how they have affected us and continue to affect... The basis of any human's belief system - be it an atheist, agnostic or a believer - is just his/her contemplation of what constitues a "better" living... and this contemplation is in turn ruled by all the presemptuous attitudes I mentioned earlier... The resultant is a menacingly assorted ideology of what could make his/her life to be "perfect"... and again, "perfect" is a relative word... its an iterative progression between what he/she feels is needed for a "perfect" living and where the presemptuous contemplations of the forerunners have left the person standing. A difficult phrase to comprehend..!! Lost amid this mystification of life, the human psyche craves to move towards a calmer, more compassionate, more tolerant and more patient humankind, in search of a logical assessment and approach to our limited understanding of Divinity and Reality... The search may lead some to a logical conclusion, which may not be scientific.. some may never ever reach a convincing conclusion... some may choose to just adopt other's conclusion... and such conclusions compose their belief system - the system they exercise on, to try to unravel the mystification in ways that every unique individual may be most comfortable with... Its not in figuring out where one belongs among this three.. or where one should ideally belong... but in living true to their "conclusion" and appreciate the "conclusion" of others... After all, irrespective of someone feeling good or bad about others "conclusion" the ever-concealed truth of where we came from, where we are going et. al. are never going to change...!! Hopefully.. the after-life (if there is one) may answer it all...!!

 Do you have any opinions that you would be reluctant to express in front of a group of your peers? If the answer is no, you might want to stop and think about that. If everything you believe is something you're supposed to believe, could that possibly be a coincidence? Odds are it isn't. Odds are you just think whatever you're told. Thought this urlLink essay would be a little useful to everyone involved in the current discussion. Rini, If Srini is willing, You or me can add his name to the members list. Hope it's ok with everyone.

 Dear Bala/Jax, i need ur contact numbers at cbe. urgent. buzz me when u come online...I will be online till 6.00 PM. Mahendran

 sometimes, it so happens that he(srini) too gets involved in issues revolving in our circle. So sometimes we discuss or he mails me about it and i post it without fail. This is one such issue which interested him i believe and since i could not reply to kicha, he has made an entry. So from now on, watch out for the original poster at the end of the post.

 its a letter man "S" in front of "Rini"... ofcourse Kicha knew that... u have missed a letter while reading betn lines. Cheers... will come to your issues soon.

 Ooops ! We've missed a word which has made a difference...and that is -Srini Kicha it is not Rini da but Srini. On behalf of our team I offer a warm welcome to our most fun prevailing place in the world. Rini atleast u must have made a note on his entry. The topic has become so hot that we are reading between lines. -chottu

 “Thatz it” I would yell like that when I come across such lively topics. Let me get in to biz.. To my understanding whoever puts up his views about God and spirituality puts God on one side and alms on the other side of a balance scale. Investing for God is poles apart from providing alms. A devotee who spends crores in God can also be helping poor and the vice versa. Why is that we always advocate that “instead of spending Rs.5 for God I would spend Rs.2 for a poor or the disabled”. Why not do both? Why is that we have either of two and not both of two? Hence I hope the point to be mulled over is whether decorating God with costly ornaments is necessary or not? To your surprise I would reply “yes that seems necessary”. To elucidate, normally God’s and Goddess are perceived as another ‘human’ super power and not as super power alone(why is that people don’t call Murugan as Mr.Murugan or add ‘inga’ at the tail) it is clear that They observe Gods as living being They assume themselves to be acquaintance for God. Hope u would abide… So what? It is as simple as buying a necklace to your mom or a bangle to your wife. People want to give the best for the best and they are happy doing it. Why do we quarrel? . To conclude ‘people are not offering ornaments thinking that they are doing good thing, it is not understood as an alternative to alms’. There is selfishness alone. It is like sharing your profit with your partner. He is offering a minor share to God because he thinks it is God who gave him that and not because he wanted to do something good. To add few more points(forgive those who have faith). I would rather compare believers of God as Piggy backers. Yes people have two reasons to pray God 1.Thanks to good things 2. Rescue from bad things. To my belief he himself is the cause for both. People say I get peace when I pray God. Of course when you shed your responsibility to some other person, you get peace of mind. So when I believe that it is because of me and I am the one to face it and set it right, so when I believe , my success is due to me; then why should I thank God who has done nothing. I have the courage to confront issues. I am responsible for what has occurred to me. Only people who don’t accept this will accept God and that is what I call it as piggy backing. Ranjini advocated that spirituality has awarded this society with good things. Please tell me one at the least.. The sense of God has made man irresponsible. The first thing we do when something goes wrong is to find a person to blame or to find a reason to say ‘I am not the cause’. Except mother nature I wouldn’t accept anything can be a cause other than us. Don’t argue now with a valid point ’aren’t you piggy backing on nature’ certainly no. I am talking about floods, sunlight..etc Please do not also argue that nature is created by God..etc I am interested in asking you why do we need GOD? Rather than asking you is there a God?

 " if the poet "earns" millions with his poetry, what does he do with that.. does he admire the beauty of a million with costly furnishing of his house or does he also "intend" to utilise a portion of it for social activies..." I don't know about the poets who earn millions with their poetry.. But most of the true creators that i know were never after money and as a rule mostly they're indifferent towards "millions"..they seem to know the true function of money in human life and even if they care to take hold of money it has always been disowned by them in an act of generosity as against the planned spending of a Philanthropist towards feeding poor...! It' rare that a Poet who is sensitive to Life will ever try to become a dry Philanthropist.. In the same lines, what does the religionist/spiritualist do apart from his material manifestation of his inward vision... what steps does he take to help lesser fortunate ones also enjoy such a spectacle... shouldn't they enjoy too..?? In manifesting his inward vision, a true religionist/spiritualist gives Himself entirely(what else we can expect ) to the Highest which is the goal of humanity and he knows that the Problem of hunger and strife cannot be solved by Philanthrophy until humanity changes itself radically..and works in colloboration with the Divine Will in uplifting humanity from it's present animal moulds to the next levels..and his way of working is itself a living art and to appreciate any true art requires discipline and training..and this natural discipline can be accessed by all who're in touch with Indian spiritual tradition... And... just a curious question... What is the purpose of God...?? That depends what's understood by God..? One has to go thru' different conceptions and notions of God before one can truly know what it is.. - Srini

 Whatever it may be, The person who earns millions due to his efforts (poems, films, science whichever way it shall be) can't be compelled to utilise his money for the social uplift. Its up to him to spend his money appropriately for the personal/human welfare coz its obvious that he cannot carry to his funeral. Kishore, do you think those persons who donated thousands for the Ekadasi festival will provide the same to a NGO activity??? Certainly not... But those who have collected in the name of Ekadasi, Can spent the entire amount for NGO activity?... it also cant be, coz they have their own liabilities / willingness... so they have to be spend towards what its meant (What they mean) for... Even by spending in decorations also; they have given oppors to hundreds of people's time / work. If we keep on questioning there is no end for it. Its upto you in deciding how u spend your money. Note: Millions stands for more than your basic need... But for some, basic need may be "Mercedes E-Class" No body cant question the same!!, unless he goes against from law for earning such an amount.

 I think I have tailed off the scope of my points.. let me make it clear... Starting on a lighter note.. rini, my title was not "the hunger for beauty" but it was "The hunger of Beauty".. whatever it meant... jax and ram, I meant to use "hunger" as a metaphor for any strife - which could be anything from a handicap to old age to anything under the sun... so there is no question of "motivating" beggars... What practical purpose does the toil of a Poet / Author ..to bring a piece of good poetry really serve? Very valid...!! But the question just begins at this place... if the poet "earns" millions with his poetry, what does he do with that.. does he admire the beauty of a million with costly furnishing of his house or does he also "intend" to utilise a portion of it for social activies... In the same lines, what does the religionist/spiritualist do apart from his material manifestation of his inward vision ... what steps does he take to help lesser fortunate ones also enjoy such a spectacle... shouldn't they enjoy too..?? What practical purpose does our Living really serve? How does it helps to feed the hunger of the poor? I may not be able to tell anything on the purpose of "our" living.. but atleast "my" living would certainly bring a satiating smile to as many faces that I can manage (not forgetting my family responsibilities)... that would be the purpose of "my" living... And... just a curious question... What is the purpose of God ...??

 I have mixed up a concotation of Javascript to solve Ranjini's suggestion. Now if you hover over the links in the recent posts section, the alternate title will display the nickname of the poster. Take a look at Quod scripsi, scripsi. GO to any month in the archives. What abou the calendar present there. Can we use it here? Your ideas are welcome.

 First few Questions: 1. What practical purpose does the toil of a Poet / Author ..to bring a piece of good poetry really serve? 2. What practical purpose does the grandiose theory/discovery of a scientist really serve? It seems we have answers for the above questions...and it's quite right also. But we're not becoming critical on a poet or a scientist...for the reason that we believe in their roles and the service they've done to the humanity. The religionist/spiritualist is trying to manifest materially what he saw/arrived inwardly as much as the poet tries to manifest mentally what he saw/arrived inwardly..In a certain sense, the work of art by a spiritualist is more practical and real than that of any poet/scientist... It appears to me that the religion/spirituality evolved by Indian Tradition seems to have performed more powerful role/function in uplifting humanity than anything we know so far on this earth..Only that it works from different outlook than that of the modern..and missing which we raise doubts based on the premise that 'it should function the way we (the modern) expect it to function?' Before this grandiose outlook, all our fleeting doubts are not annihilated but enlightened and illumined..only if we care to embrace it! To become more sincere in our questioning we can ask such questions to ourselves, because we know ourselves better than our tradition..and starting from oursleves may not be a bad idea. 1.What practical purpose does our Living really serve? How does it helps to feed the hunger of the poor? - Srini

 Hi, 25th post in the 13th day of the New year 2k4 from RamG... First Sriprasath volunteered himself out of the blog group... All the best for his future endeavours... Second Colin made himself into the Infy BandWangon... All the best for his forecoming challenges... This blog is regarding my mail accessibility... As I am in Cisco project our network is separated from infy's, so rarely I do check my infy mails during office hours... So pl. dont expect quick reply for those mails... S, its an apt quote, quoted especially for people like us reg. commn..... Coming to "The hunger of Beauty", I also do agree that instead of spending crores in decorations and functions we can spend towards hunger, but it should remove poverty ultimately instead of motivating beggars to be lethargic coz nyway there is someone to give food... Got lots of work... will come later Cheers

 So Kicha, you say that free access alone would not bring communication, but instead it is up to the individual. Maybe the factor is willingness to participate . I feel that communication can take place only when people are willing to tell something akin to thinking out loud. If they wish that they want others to know something about thier life they will communicate. The 'something' I speak about could be anything: personal anecdotes, work-related, hobbies, in fact anything they wish to. Amazingly I see extremes in communication. I find people who never speak at all in public are vehemont communicators in private. People you wish would close thier mouths for a few minutes never speak at all in an electronic conversation. Seems to be good topic for a research paper. Why does this anomaly occur? Relating to the group/blog, a few point that Kicha made echoes my thoughts. Now, consider in real life, a group of five are discussing. When after a time period, some one begins participating less and less in the discussion. The others try a couple of times to involve the person, but to no avail. Then they start ignoring the person. Has anyone seen an example of this in an electronic discussion? More later, P.S. I am unable to access my postmark id from today morning. So I may not be able to mail anyone. If it starts working again, I'll resume the communications. Those in the know about Lifetree, I will mail you all later.

 Very thought-provoking quote... It does seem so true with respect to our blog and our group... But in this case the factors are not restricted to the access to communication medium alone... I can give quite a few names who do have unrestricted access to the medium but still are reluctant to participate... Equal access to communication medium is a vital factor.. but not THE factor... a lot depends on the attitude of the person as well.. does he/she really want to get it going... if they do, they would try to eke out some time somewhere and participate even though they may not be as active as a few others.. but if they don't want to.. then give them months of unrestrcited access to hundreds of equivalent media and still u r not going to extract a word out of their mouth...

 The title has been adjusted/resized and padding added Recent titles lists all post titles. But it is hard to identify the author. Currently, I am playing around Javascript to work out a method. Padding added to the post, so that it does not touch the borders Archives have ben changed to monthly. But I guess they may take some time to download, due to a large number of posts Anyone else having any ideas, blog your suggestions. More changes are just round the corner.

 Just came across this quote. The quote is known as " urlLink Rushkoff 's Law of Media". True communication can only occur between people with equal access to the medium in which the communication is taking place. It set me thinking. I wonder how far this law or its implications can be true with respect to our blog and our group.

 A very good question. One I have pondered upon quite many times. I find it easy to drop money to a poor person than to drop in the church. At the same time, I wonder if I am doing right or wrong. Giving them money so that they can eat or allowing them to remain in drudgery. There is a Chinese proverb: Give a man a fish to eat; he'll not be hungry for a day. But teach him to fish, he'll never be hungry in his life This has always been a problem when I think of giving alms. So I usually avoid giving money. Instead, I try to give them clothes or other materials, rather than money. I am waiting to hear of anyone has faced such a dilemma.

 From rini's post.. The whole entrance was painted in gold... This brings to my mind one more aspect of life and living that I often ponder... Its been a part of the Indian tradition (I'm not very aware of other ones), to have the idols of gods to be embossed with gold and jewellery costing to a few good deal of rupees... I truely wonder what big significance they might be having... a decoration is needed and a costly decoration might also be.. But why can't some portion of these be channelled towards the needy... The idols do look awesome and do give a serene feeling for all the spiritual hearts.. but I would prefer bread for a person on the steet rather than personal serenity... A lot of temples and trusts taking care of such temples do have the practice of providing food and rendering a helping hand to a lot of people.. but still a very huge amount seems to be spent on the beautification of the temples and the idols which beyond a limit seems to serve no practical purpose... Lord Venkateshwara in Tirupathi, wearing a diamond studded crown worth 50 lakh rupees sure looks wonderful and does give a refreshing feeling to all the thousands of people craving to have a peek at Him... But how does it help my hunger...

 My new year ! really good it was though with not much of hungama! Yes, i wanted to take srini by surprise that night and so planned on 31st Dec afternoon to get some gifts for him. ya, dint know what to buy as usual and so, planned to pay a visit to Gangarams book shop. Actually Srini wanted to read Bharathiyar Kavithaigal and so i thought it would be better to gift him a book he had loved to read once. But to my dismay, they said there wont be any Tamil books at Gangarams. My friend was supposed to join me over there for shopping. So while waiting there, slowly i browsed thru' the greeting card section of theirs. In the front panel i searched and searched and could not find even a single new year card for husband. i was getting still more irritated. But then suddenly when i was onlooking some post cards, i found some beautiful and exquisite post card pictures of Indian sculptures and temples. yes they were awesome and i was so impressed. Then i remembered that Srini wanted to make an album of such things. So stat, i bought some postcards and picked a beautiful album too for that. Decided, let me gift this album of cards for him! Then when i went inside to other panels i could see so many new year cards, but dint buy any, coz i thought one of the post card was much better than those cards! So planned to convey my wish thru' that simple postcard! Then my friend, she came and took me to higginbothams and to my joy, there i found the book i had wanted to gift to Srini! Yes, now i got book and an album for him. To add sweetness to the day, i bought some rosagullas @ K.C. Das When i came home after shopping, i found Srini sitting at home hungry and angry?! since i dint inform where i had gone. Then i told i had been out for shopping. then we were chatting and rang to almost all his acquaintances and wished them. At dawn of new year, at 12 MN, we went upstairs to see the splendid crackers display in shivering cold weather at Leela Palace and gifted him my presents. Think he liked! both book and album! Next day got his blessings and as usual went to office and in the evening went to Domlur Perumal temple and wished for his blessings! Good did the first day of the year end. I planned to take 2 resolutions, one was to practice dance and music daily for sometime in the morning which i am not able to do till date. The other one is to improve my reading habits, which i think i am doing regulalry. On Saturday we went to ISKCON temple. Its was Ekadasi. In the entrance they had put a beautiful swing decorated with flowers and had laid the Ananda Sayanam(sleeping pose) of Lord vishnu with his mistress besides. The whole entrance was painted in gold and it was so splendid and serene to go under the foot of Lord at the entrance. Spent almost a day there, since it was fully packed. But then since, they had very well organised, we dint feel the pain of waiting. Then in the evening went to Leela Palace, did little bit of bowling, but to my dismay i could not even touch even a single pin how so ever i bowl. So did the first week of the year end with pleasant events and happenings. This how was my new year!

 A decade old dream was about to come true, A four year craving about to be satisfied. I shifted my weight to position my body better in the chair. The room was dark. As the screen began to clear from black, I was high. The music, haunting yet uplifting filled my ears. The next three hours was the ride of my life, my emotions riding a rollercoaster. At the end, I felt as if I had lost a good companion. ' The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King ' - Seems to be a lofty pompous name for the title of a movie. The book was a wonderfully scripted work of art. The movie went one better. It brought the book to life. There are critics who say that Peter Jackson has taken some liberties with the book in the movie. They always say that. Even personally, I was disappointed by the absence of Christopher Lee as Saruman . Setting those things apart, LOTR:ROTK was a rich feast. A feast for everyone. There was quite a lot of technical wizardry behind each frame in the movie. The locations were a treat to watch. It is difficult to believe that places like these really exist. The extensive sets, especially Minas Tirith was breathtaking. The characterisation were so beautiful. The transformation of Smegol into Gollum, which formed the introduction, was just a prelude to what was to come. The beautiful picturisation of the The battle sequences, Osilogarth and the siege of Minas Tirith were not as long as the battle of Helm's Deep in TTW . Yet they were a showcase of amazing battle scenes. The yearning of Eowyn for Aragorn was subdued in the movie, but Tolkien's strongest woman character was just reduced to mouthing insipid dialogues and brandishing a pretty little sword. The funnny thing about the movie was that the bad guys were not given any importance. They just came and left without much ado. The scene where Faramir goes to battle against all odds was touching, but the sub-plot was jarring. The music score by James Horner was totally amazing. Must try to get the soundtrack of the movie. This movie is definitely worth watching more than a couple of times. Totally I was satisfied with the trilogy, not like the Matrix trilogy. The movies were enhanced by technology, not dependent on it like the Matrix trilogy. I have planned on taking a day off and watching the LOTR trilogy back to back. Go and see it. I wonder what Tolkien would have said if he could see his beloved Middle Earth come to life in the movies.

 yes, it occurs only in the recent posts section and not in the blog content area. so it really confuses who has posted what, the top one or bottom one. do check it out.

 jax, I too think the positioning of the name of the author doesn't look appealing despite its logically correct placing... may be, the "by jax" could be aligned with the title and time of post appearing a little below it or below the post... The font also could have been smaller by design rather than requiring adjustments to IE Text options.. may be some other standard font like arial with a lesser size might be handy.. check on that...

 The title of the post and the post info ( by XXX and posted on YYYY) are perfectly aligned with the title on the left and the post info on the right. The case of the post info hanging in the middle may occur only when someone forgets to give a title to thier post. Keep your comments coming in...

 Over the past three days, I watched the following movies. Here are my reviews of the movies. urlLink The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King I guess I need not give a gist of the story. The movie warrants a detailed post. I'll put it later. urlLink The Hunted In the green woods of Silver Falls, Oregon, Aaron Hallam, a trained assassin AWOL from the Special Forces, keeps his own brand of wildlife vigil. After brutally slaying four deer hunters in the area, FBI Special Agent Abby Durrell turns to L.T. Bonham-- the one man who may be able to stop him. At first L.T. resists the mission. Snug in retirement, he's closed off to his past, the years he spent in the Special Forces training soldiers to become skilled murderers. But when he realizes that these recent slayings are the work of a man he trained, he feels obligated to stop him. Accepting the assignment under the condition that he works alone, L.T. enters the woods, unarmed--plagued by memories of his best student and riddled with guilt for not responding to Aaron's tortured letters to him as he began to slip over the edge of sanity. Furious as he is with his former mentor for ignoring his pleas for help, Aaron knows that he and L.T. share a tragic bond that is unbreakable. And, even as they go into their final combat against each other, neither can say with certainty who is the hunted and who is the hunter. My comments : It was wonderful. Can watch it more than once. This movie reminds me of David Morrell's works. It was ironic, reading a novel and watching a movie that were so similar. urlLink Confidence : A con man gets into big trouble when unknowingly tries to scam an accountant that works for a mafia kingpin. Now, he has to pull off yet another scam to pay the mafia off before they get tired and decide to "collect their losses." Confidence is one of those heist films with plenty of twists, a lot of characters who are guaranteed to back stab at least once and flashy direction to put everything together. It is quite clear that by the end of the movie. My comments : It was interesting, humorous and twisting. Can watch it once or twice (if you like the dialogues). urlLink The Identity : Caught in a savage rainstorm, ten travelers are forced to seek refuge at a strange desert motel. They soon realize they've found anything but shelter. There is a killer among them and, one by one, they are murdered. As the storm rages on and the dead begin to outnumber the living, one thing becomes clear: Each of them was drawn to the motel, not by accident or circumstance, but by forces beyond imagination, forces that promise anyone who survives a mind-bending and terrifying destiny... My comments : It was a nice thrilling horror movie. Can watch it once. Ennaku 20 Unnakku 18 : I guess this film does not need any story line. My comments : Yet another copy of Serendipity. The only best thing about the movie was the music. There were mistakes galore in the movie as expected from a Tamil film. Janasheen : The newspapers seemd to say the movie was good. So this was my first Hindi movie for quite sometime. I don't know what the title means. Maybe someone can elucidate on it. My comments : It was a typical Hindi masala film. The usual baddies, songs in foreign locations, fights ad romances and infuriating makeup and dresses. THe one thing I liked in the movie was the bike race. It was filmed beautifully. I don't know if it was an archived footage or it was shot for the movie.

 i just noticed it now, when u r in the middle of the page, then the posted by X at the top of the blog confuses, since there is no proper demarcation to tell where the blog ends, its hard to define whether it belongs to the next post or to the previous post. so cant we have a single line to end the blog? About fonts, ofcourse its good to use normally used fonts but then i say its not fitting properly and each font look unique in its own way and not setting into the blog whole heartedly. so fit them jax. And yes, i think everybody would have noticed the layout change, but then not much interested, since they are more contented with content i believe. There is an article about Anna Karenina in urlLink Elite-essays blog. Those who are interested can have a look to know about the novel which i am reading now. Apart from jax and kicha, y rnt u people talking about new year celebrations, resolutions, predictions? i will join the bandwagon soon, probably next week! till then little bit busy!

 The CROSS A young man was at the end of his hope, seeing no way out, he dropped to his knees in prayer &#34;Lord, I can&#39;t go on,&#34; he said. &#34;I have too heavy a cross to bear&#34; The Lord replied, &#39;My son, if you can't bear its weight, just place your cross inside this room. Then, open that other door and pick out any cross you wish.&#39; The man was filled with relief and said, &#39;Thank you Lord,&#39; and he did as he was told. Upon entering the other room, he saw many crosses; some so large the tops were not visible. Then, he spotted a tiny cross leaning against a far wall. &#34;I'd like that one, Lord,&#34; he whispered. The Lord replied, &#34;My son, that is the cross you just brought in.&#34;

 After eight days, someone has noticed that the layout has changed. Coming to Ranjini's points: Font Sizes : I feel an explanation for the font size is required. I have used 'em' as a font size measurement. An 'em' is the size that a capital em, 'M' occupies on your screen. This is a relative unit of measurement. If you resize your text size, using the "View > Text Size" option in IE or "Control + or Control -" in Mozilla browsers, the text size reduces or enlarges. This is not possible when a fixed measurement unit like pixels are used. I'll reduce them as requested. Font Style : Different fonts were used only to distuinguish between items like Dates, Titles and Posts. A serif font like Times New Roman or Georgia is used for the Date. Sans-serif fonts like Verdana, Arial, Trebuchet are used for the rest of the items. Since the fonts installed in a system may differ from user to user, I have used only the common fonts. Style Switcher : The Style Switcher is ready. But I didn't want to put it up till I got this stylesheet ready. Since any changes made in this will be reflected there, I decided to wait a little bit. Archives : Since I was using an unordered list, they appear as a really long list. Monthly archives seems to be a good idea as you had suggested. Will try and see how that works. I had an idea of using a archive section just like the one you see when you login into blogger. But it would take some little programming work in Javascript. If any of our prog. geniuses can help me out, it would be really wonderful. Blogrolling : Actually, I was thinking of eliminating it. The current blogrolling section is an external script called from urlLink Blogrolling . Since Javascript slows down the page a little bit, I was thinking of transferring everything to a manually maintained link. This would also allow everyone to have a list of favorite links/bookmarks. Need to discuss about this in detail. Other minor corrections are in place. This is a work in progress as I had mentioned in my post. So WYSTMNBWYST .

 sorry this oops has got nothin to do with Object orientation, but about my earlier blog on layout. ye, the blog rolling is there and it was a refreshing problem i believe which dint make a proper display of all the links.! so, good that u still hold the good old blog rolling!

 No, its not as good as the old one. this is what i said when we switched from b/w to colors right! so though i say this now i have a tell, that we can groom it to a better layout. So, here is my feed back about the layout sir! 1. title: too big and it is, as it touches the blogspot ad and looks awkward. so can be reduced a bit. All together the layout has got a funky look i believe. 2 Recent posts title is too bold and even the day and date is not appealing. All the fonts look coarse to me. no smooth finish it has got. cant we polish the fonts a bit? Cant we stick to one particular type of font, rather than experimenting with many number of fonts? 3. the box in which our blog content lies: Grey background is good, but the letters touching the margin looks as if we are trying to stuff more in less space which can be avoided by giving enough padding. 4. Switch styles is not working and so pls. do look into it. Infact i dont use it much, but then since i wasnt that impressed by the layout, i thought lemme switch to different style, but to my dismay it dint work. 5. Since the archive section is a weekly one, its taking a long space and cant we switch to monthly archive from now on. Anyway we have search blog option which will help us to retrieve required info based on date or content and so i dont feel it necessary to maintain the archives to be done weekly. Monthly will do. 6. no links under blog rolling. what happened to that? i cant switch between the blogs just i do before. i want that back now immediately. how can u remove it without asking us? atleast me! 7. And the box of declaration can be had in the side bar as its now. it looks good! 8. y contact alone is not in pink as other links like home, about etc in the menu bar below the title? Hmmmmmmmmm........ as such only this much i have to say about the layout, fix these if u feel they ought to be else, ......... And sorry guys for not being active for the past few days. Got some work at our office and these days i am spending my time in reading a fantastic novel........ Yes its by a famous russian author! can u people guess it?Yes, its Anna Karenina. Really if i say i have read a book worth a read all of my life time, then this is going to be one of them. Yes, i am in Part two and its so huge and its so alluring that its the only entertainment for me at office these days. yes, i dont own that book, but read it online! Its so so interesting that i have almost given up the art of mailing or blogging, except if needed. My thoughts about the book, yes ofcourse i am planning to post a review of each part from next week. Its a big novel which runs into 9 parts and so many pages. Let me see if i can or not! Since i am not a pace rider on books like jax, i cant finish off in a week's time and i read it online in between my work to relax myself. but then, coz i love to read this book, i dont want to finish off soon too........ Ok meet u all with reviews and my new year resolutions in forth coming blogs. bye for now!

 After Sachin Tendulkar held a catch at deep square leg he had just run a few paces when he stopped and with a hitherto unseen uniformity started clapping his hands... and so did everyone in the Indian cricket team and so did the entire 40,000+ audience at the Sydney Cricket Ground... for, he had just sounded the final gong to draw to the close a legacy... a legacy called Steve... Stephen Rodger Waugh had a rather ordinary start to his career with 18 runs in his first test.. little did he think that he would play for that many more years to come... He was not a naturally gifted batsman as his brother Mark, but he had his own imaculate style and an indomitable grit that won many a lost match for his team. The world called him the "ice man" when as a young 21 year old lad he bowled splendid emotionless spells to help his team win the '87 World Cup... But the real steel in him came out in the 1995 away series in West Indies.. where he braved some fierce bowling and stood ground with a finely carved century to beat the Windies in a series for the first time in over a decade... When he took over the mantle from Mark Taylor, he had already a strong team at his disposal... all he had to do was to continue the momentum set by his predecessor.. but he had a rather sombre start drawing against West Indies... his captaincy drew flak from the media... but it was not before long that they had to eat their own words... He has always been seen by the cricketing fraternity as a man for the crisis... The unbeaten 120 against South Africa in the '99 World Cup, is probably the best One Day innings I ever watched live... and his famous words to Gibbs when he dropped him in the middle that innings "mate, you've just dropped the World Cup" is still etched in every mind.. Steve could never have been so true.. Gibbs did drop the world cup... He was class apart from his other counterparts.. his personal definition of the so-called Aussie sledging was different... neither does he have the theatrical histrionics of Brett Lee when he takes a wicket nor has he ever been as noisy as their "famous" slip cordon... When Ganguly was hit on the head by Lee... amid a lot din from the slip cordon he went close and asked "Are u fine Saurav..?".. He also did his bit of parenting too... when the little kid, Parthiv Patel's typical adolescent gimmick at him made him softly tell "Learn to show respect, Parthiv. You were in nappies when I started playing"... just like he would advise his son... The greatness of this man is not just on the field... But he has done his bit with the Udayan foundation in Kolkota that takes care of the orphans and children of lepers.. one could see the glow in every child's eyes there as Steve pays his routine visit.. the banner "We love you Steve" held by a small girl when he stepped in, says it all about him... A cricketer par excellence and a human beyond the ordinary... The sun might have set.. but the shine remains...

 Here are a couple of books I read last week. "Along Came A Spider" was my first James Patterson novel. It was also his first novel featuring Alex Cross. Though the novel was not that great in terms of the storyline, the characterisation was impeccable. Those characters were totally real-life. I loved it. The book was an amalgam of a kidnapping story, multiple murders and psychos with a few insanely infuriating twists thrown in. It was made into a movie, starring Morgan Freeman as Alex Cross. Now I am looking forward to meeting Alex Cross in "Kiss The Girls". David Morrell's "Testament" began with the line,"It was the last morning the four of them would ever be together." After that it was one of the most shocking story of what it means to be hunted. For journalist Reuben Bourne the nightmare begins when he breaks a promise to cast a paramilitary white supremacy group in a favorable light-a fateful decision that will shatter his life. A basically peaceful man with a paradoxical attraction for violence, Reuben suddenly faces an enemy driven by an obsessive, unrelenting hate. Now to survive this ordeal, he must lead his family on a desperate flight into the wilderness-a world as harsh and unforgiving as the fanatics who hunt him. The story has a totally unexpected shocking ending. I really did not expect the novel to end like that.

 The desert is never dead. Life is always present. Thouugh it may not be visible on the surface, it is ever present beneath it. The seasons keep changing but the order in which they arrive never change at all. Some planters might have left, some biding time. As they should know by now, there is a time for sowing and a time for reaping. And there is always a time between reaping and sowing. Perhaps it is that time now... awaiting the rain to fall...

 It was an interesting patch of land. Initially, there was not much to say about the lengthy strip.. no one knew it could ever be of some use to someone in the first place... then, time moved on and there were some early planters who observed this barren patch could be of some use to them.. and they started planting.. but with a little caution at first... It did not take much time for them to realise the potential that lay buried underneath this scratchy surface... they just had to wait a little longer to see the richness in their hands.. just as the good people that they were... they took this exciting discovery to the outside world.. and soon there were more planters and more richness coming their way... people learnt the secret of differentiating wasteland from rich land.. and inturn succeeded in finding more such lands and more planation and more cultivation and more richness and more prosperity... As the days moved on.. the initial patch of land seemed a sensation no more.. for it was not the only thing around now.. there were many such... the people sure were growing richer but this land that was the first of its kind and a noble servant for a handful of planters now seemed to be losing its lustre.. its initial discoverers have seen more of its kind and have too much already to think about and are in no big ideas patting this patch as they did in the early days... It now needs some real "change" to make this already semi-arid desert into the lush fertile terrain that everyone loves... If u understand what I'm talking......

 It felt that someone had hit the replay button. Last year started in sickness. This year, it was a repeat. Spending the day at home sick is no fun indeed. The beginning of a new year, the air abuzz with enthusiasm and eagerness for the new year. The first time I went out in the new year was to relatives’ and friends’ homes. That was my only sojourn for the next couple of days. By late evening, I was sick and bed-ridden. Memories of the previous year flashed across my mind. It was ironic. New Year’s Eve, I was standing in the church braving the elements, while my friend nearby complained it was cold and wore a jacket. Twenty hours later, it was my turn to shiver in the cold. The next couple of days were spent indoors. Unlike last year, I didn’t have to suffer much. Just a feeling of frustration on not being able to go about my regular chores pervaded my thoughts. For the first time in almost three days, I emerged out on Saturday, planning to spend sometime in the sunshine. It was not meant to be. The skies were gloomy and dark. Rain looked certain. So I returned home with a mood as black as the skies above. Another day gone in the new year. I had not even done anything worthwhile yet. Is it the shape of thing to come this year? Three days later, yesterday was really the first day of the year for me. I went out to play early morning in the cold, protected from the chill by a thick windcheater. A good couple of hours play brought back the vigor for the new year. Somehow, I have put the past few days behind me. Now let us see how the new year is going to turn out to be.

 It was a wonderful new year day for me. Simply because, I did nothing all day.. and yet did a lot of things...!! The previous night, I went to a hotel with my house-mates and we were up there at the stroke of new year.. and came back home around 1.30AM... slept a few minutes later and woke up early in the morning at 9AM... It was a holiday for me... Everyone else had left for work... and there was no cricket on TV to bring out the couch potato in me.. I was all alone at home.. all to myself... I relished the sound of a staggering silence... there was a calm I never experienced in a long time.. the solitude was ecstatic... I spent time in bed introspecting on my recent past few years.. sequels of my disappointments, successes, promises, thought-waves reeled in front of my eyes... I praised my triumphs, thanked for my achievements, prayed over my failures and chuckled my naughty nit-wits.. I sat with the "Speedpost" book and started reading a few pages... and that only added to the already brimming delight... the way Shoba De had described her childhood and the comparision to her children's childhood sent ripples of thought of my childhood... its amazing how mothers could be so similar... we do owe a lot to this gracious species called mother... It was late in the evening when I finally decided to peep into what the idiot box had in store for me... as I switched on... MTV was up, and I saw a black-and-white picture of a railway station, where Palash (of Euphoria ) was standing with his guitar... that brought a wide smile to my face.. one of my favorite songs was just starting... "Mai Re" by Euphoria ... and the song kept up its hum all through that evening as I looked up to drawing the line on one of the most blissful days of my life... How better to start a new year...!!

 Wish you an extremely prosperous, recession-controlled, economically-stimulated, interest-rate-reduced, employment-filled, portfolio-rebounding, debt-free, bonus-filled, war-free, air-safe, terrorist-free, friends-filled, family-growing, healthy, joyous, cheerful, and most importantly, a Business-generating, Revenue-rich New Year.

 Hi, I had an sudden impulse to redesign QSS. Tell me how the new design looks. Also I find some funny behaviour by the site. Once the page is loaded, you might find that the right side bar has a lot of padding. Just move you mouse over any link on the page. The extra padding disappears. When I checked, this particular behaviour appears only in Internet Explorer. In Firefox, the website appears normal. Anyone else having such problem, send me a screenshot and the browser version you are using. If possible, send the screen resolution also. Bye, P.S. Bala, you left out Russia. There are more millionaires in Russia than Hong Kong, when compared to to ecomoic scenario prevailing in the country. (Compare thier GDPs)

 Good to see to 2 stepouts from Harvard and Stanford enjoying the richest business tycoons in the global as well as in the Indian Arena as per Forbes 500 . Looking at their past, and reviewing their present their growth is Sky scrapping. Dirubai Ambani Sold garments as a cycle dukanwala in the 1950's.

 -- In the mid of the hottest discussion.... Hottest..??? Ain't I missing anything...?? Whats hot in the discussion.. was there a discussion in the first place...?? just strings of yarn that feather the sweat amid some work and etching between the words an "I'm still alive" kind of an awful trub... and u call this "the hottest discussion"...?? Uh..!!

 In the mid of the hottest discussion, Have a Break... Have a Kidnap... A man received a letter and it said " If you don't pay us $100,000, Your wife will be kidnapped from the 3rd day of receipt of this letter." The poor man replied back to the letter " I am afraid! I can't keep your promise! But I hope u will keep yours!"

 Thank you so much Jax, Its a well written article on RSS & NA, Not more than this one could ask from a Content developer, Gud and thankx. Yeah sure, I have to install a news aggregator in my system for segregating web articles... will contact you soon regarding that, slightly busy nowdays. I think, u were regularly visiting "my urlLink Thoughts " page, and got fed up with out any updates and ultimately found out a tool for automatic request for viewing modified webpages... Cheers

 All of us might have been visiting the blog on a regular basis, maybe once or twice a day to see if there are any new posts. Probably you might be opening up your favorite web browser and typing the url to visit the blog. Similarly there might be quite lot of things you might be accessing regularly everyday like news headlines, site updates, blogs etc. Let me explain with my own experiences. I visit almost thirty-odd websites every day. The list contain websites, magazines, news headlines, and web logs. It is difficult to remember each site. So I bookmark these sites and visit them. Most of the time, I find that not all sites are updated regularly. A couple of sites are updated more than once in a day and some sites once in two days. There is no way of knowing which sites are updated and which are not. Imagine opening up nearly forty websites and finding that only four or five of them have been updated. Consider the costs involved in terms of time and bandwidth. It is huge. News Aggregators: This is where aggregators step in. My news aggregator helps me keep up with all my favorite sites by checking if they are updated and displaying the new items from each of them. Now I find that my news aggregator can find and classify them so that I get to read the latest items. I thereby get to save my time and bandwidth. There are several type of aggregators available. Web based aggregators like urlLink my Yahoo! and urlLink myFeedster collect information and display them in a webpage. Aggregators are also available as standalone applications. They are also integrated into e-mail clients and web browsers. A search on Google reveals numerous aggregators. You can choose one that suits you. I use " urlLink RSS Reader Panel " with urlLink Mozilla FireFox 0.8 . Since the aggregator integrates into the web browser, I find it very easy to find sites that have been updated using it. How do aggregators know which and when sites have been updated? The answer is through an XML-based format known as RSS. What is RSS? RSS is an XML-based format that is used for syndicating news and the content of news-like sites, including major news sites like BBC, news-oriented community sites like Slashdot, and personal weblogs. But it is not limited to news alone. urlLink Mark Pilgrim says that "anything that can be broken down into discrete items can be syndicated via RSS". He cites examples like the "recent changes" page of a wiki, a changelog of CVS checkins, even the revision history of a book. Once information about each item is in RSS format, an RSS-aware program (read aggregator) can check the feed for changes and react to the changes in an appropriate way. RSS feeds: An RSS feed is an XML file that is available on the webserver just like a HTML page. Once a feed is available for a website, and aggregator can visit the file and perform the required action. A feed contains a list of items, each of which is identified by a link. Each item can have any amount of metadata associated with it. Metadata usually consists of a title and a description about it. It can also have infomation like the publisher of the feed, the date it was updated and other metadata items. Versions of RSS: There are several formats of RSS currently available. Lots of heated discussions have been going on about which format is the better format. Even the expansion of RSS is a bone of contention among various people. Atom, the new kid on the block: Recently, several people have been pushing forward for a better and enhanced RSS format called Atom. This project has gained acceptance among major CMS and blogging clients, including Blogger and Movable Type. Several RSS aggregators have begun supporting Atom and the list is expanding regularly. In case you have more doubts, urlLink this tutorial will help you to understand the basics of RSS. Several real-life examples of RSS are given in urlLink this website . In case you want me to choose a RSS aggregator for you, I can help you out. Your comments and feedback are welcome.



 Rini, can you enable the Atom feed in all the blogs you post? Just like I did for 'All in a day's work!' You can find it in the blog setting under feeds. Since you don't mention that you have posted in them, I have to visit each one in sequence. If you enable the feeds, I'll know whenever you update them. And I can visit them. What do you say? Ram, I'll reply to your query on RSS soon. I am collecting info on them.

 Though chefs in most hotels are men, household men seldom take to cooking.. Why is it so...?? I got an answer... may be, its because of E.G.O. after all, how can the man - the head of the family, the god of small and big things of his family - take up something as measly as cooking... ----------------- sometimes I wonder, why I wonder… the more I wonder why I wonder, the more I wonder… I again wonder but this time I wonder not why I wonder… But how much I wonder why I wonder…

 Chennai to have Infy's largest development centre The campus, being pegged as the world’s largest development centre by official sources, will be built on a sprawling 129 acres of land within Mahindra City. A press release from Mahindra City said that Infosys will invest Rs 1,250 crore in phases and ultimately build the facility which will occupy 25,000 employees. Read urlLink full-story .

 Fee-cut will weaken IIMs: Narayana Murthy, Banga Murthy was speaking to the press along with Hindustan Lever Chairman M S 'Vindi' Banga. The two corporate stalwarts, along with marketing consultant Rama Bijapurkar, said that IIMs are not elitist. Banga said: "Nearly 18 per cent of the IIM students are from the families whose annual income is below Rs 150,000. Another 60 per cent have a household income of below Rs 500,000. Only 22 per cent of the students come from families whose annual income is above Rs 500,000. So to say that IIM is catering to only the elite is wrong." "The government should not spend more on students who would be earning much more," Murthy said, adding that the average salary of an IIM-Ahmedabad graduate was about Rs 825,000 and the loan for fees could be repaid by the student easily in a couple of years. Describing the Union HRD ministry's decision as unilateral, Banga said there were a number of stakeholders who should be involved in the process. He noted that IIM-A was promoted by the central government, Gujarat government and corporates. "There are 45 million children in India who don't go to school. There are 350 million illiterate people and in every rural school of our country there is just one teacher for two classes. So instead of reducing IIM fees, we should pay more attention to those things in our country. I mean we should not rob the poor and pay the rich," Murthy added. Read urlLink full-story .

 How often have u thought of times in your past when u had a habit.. a trait... that drew a lot of attention from ur peers... things that used to be so natural for u but very unseen for most others and that had even become a mark of identification for u... sometimes you were known more by those acts rather than yourself... Years hence, it would look as funny for ourselves as it was for the others in those days... How often have u tried re-enacting some acts... that blows an inexplicable air of nostalgia taking us back to our "good old days" for a few moments... and at times becomes a revelation to us about ourselves as to how we have changed over the years... and may be teach us a lesson or two... Sometimes.. it pays to ponder the past...

 Nice Rini, to hear these info. regarding your Co's (ofcourse ur progress) attempt!! Hope u reach the milestones on time...along with quality... It is a very good opportunity to raise high (Grow with the growing organisation)... Do well, All the best... hmm! open for discussion any time. yeah, ur link about PGSM @ IIMB, I am already aware of.. and thanks for remembrance... but not now!!! Any plans for you? Ofcourse Kicha is right.. but moving as per the standards is quite difficult.. after proj. delivery for the sake of maintaining the level one completes the process on time b4 the actual Audit... (ha ha ha) Anyway its really really helpful during future review...!!! :) Cheers

 Good to see Rini involving in a lot of non-technical aspects of work.. these "paper-work" are so much important in the paperless offices of these days... there's really so much to gain in defining a proper methodology and standards and sticking to it during the various phases of a project execution... It sometimes feels a nuisance to do a lot of homework for a seemingly trivial task.. but in the long run when XYZ needs to work on something that was done a few years back.. such standardization is going to be a boon to that guy... Such models do not just provide an organized way of working but also a sustainably efficient process that aid in optimized usage of time and reduction in cost...

 Actually we are going to implement it soon and our road map shows that we will be level 3 certified , 9 months from now. But it reaaaaaaaaallly needs lots of sweat on our part to stick to the road map, coz that road map is for organisations which are having enough resources and are following some processes atleast. But in our case, since our department is not full fledged and is in a developing stage and also not many process areas identified, i mean u can consider we dont have ODSP at all which CMM suggest. So just imagine about starting from scratch, where in i was even asked to prepare a template for making a proposal for a project and need to prove the rational behind every element in the template. Ofcourse, we do have some standard templates like those provided by IEEE (Institution of Electrical Engineers) but then still, it needs to be customised to our company and thats where the entire work goes in. Atleast i am happy that we have some references like that of IEEE. The next few months is probably till mid April, its going to be Process definition and the rest to follow is process implementation. and mind u, this is additional work, which we have to perform along with our regular work load. But then as all transition demands exra work, we see to it with new hopes of much regulated and consistent way of working, to deliver a quality product. Ofcourse i would also like to talk to you people about the kind of exposure to certain project management issues too in course of time. Yes, i will also keep you updated of how a company moves in different stages when it tries to reach further. Esp. a small company like ours which has a very meagre or no presence i can say in pure s/w projects, must have proper vision to see where we are heading towards. And i think, our seniors have thought over it and so we are getting equipped ourselves to meet any kind of project in railway signalling domain in forthcoming days. Ok guys will share more in days to come. but then what happened to other bloggers? Looking glum for quiet sometime........ Anyway, if u people are taking a bit of rest, before u shower us with all kind of posts, then i wait for it with glee. till then bye!

 It has been some time since I had posted anything here. I had been caught up in work, both at office and at home. Somehow I managed to get some time to try and structure QSS. One thing I have done is to remove the movie and book information from the main page. So now visitors will not see posts that are about the movies I had watched and the books I have read. They will instead be listed under 'Recent Reads' and 'Recently Watched'. But even this might change soon. It is really a pain in the neck trying to fit all information in a single page. Maybe urlLink this might help. Rini, Your post was a refresher course in CMM. So when do you plan for CMM? Till the next post,

 Rini, that was a nice info regarding CMM... gud to hear that u r empowered to bring changes!!! keep it up Jax, went thru ur naration... seems u enjoyed the day to the most... Cheers

 Yesterday was one of those days you wished would never end at all. Vijay, thanks da for awaking me at 12:05 am. Read more about how I spent the day urlLink here . I wanted to post this earlier. But I had some network problems and an urgent work to do.

 The Capability Maturity Model for Software (also known as the CMM and SW-CMM) is a model for judging the maturity of the software processes of an organization. A process, which involves all the operations in an organisation dealing with software projects starts from the time, a quotation or proposal is made for acquiring the project to the end/closure of the project. A process is sequential, and is also augmented with parallel flows of operation across various process areas (popularly known as Key Process Areas or KPAs shortly) of an Organisation's process. There are Five levels which are talked about in CMM. Each level indicative of the level of evolution of the process in terms of its maturity. Maturity here by means, the ability or capability (how well )of the process to handle the variations in the process. Hence forth CM stands for Capability Maturity in the Model. The first level is " Initial " level, where in the organisation is not having any define process. The second level is " Repeateable " level, where in there are some best practices followed or process is defined, but its not same for all the projects. These processes, since are found to be effective, are repeated for the forthcoming projects, but remember, still its not a standard ( means, a process which is used across the organisation). If a company is in level three, then it means, they have a defined ODSP (Organisation Defined Software Process) which can be understood from the very expansion of it that, there will be only one process, with enough flexiblity to contain any kind of project the company wishes to undertake. Once this ODSP is defined, then PDSP (Project Defined Software Process) is tailored from this ODSP. Obviously level three is about " Defining " Defining a process i mean here, is to write a set of procedures for handling the KPA's in a process and create the necessary templates like a Quotation template, Project plan template, Requirement Analysis Report template, Architectural Design document template, Detailed Design Document template, Design plan template, Code review report template, Test plan template, test report template, Acceptance report template etc. and so on. Along with this, guidelines which help us in taking decisions regarding the design like different life cycle models, and others like different project estimation techniques, and guidelines for good coding, standard coding practices etc. are also evolved and they are bundled together to form a process. And traceablity of all these across the process is also maintained. Traceablity here by i mean the ablity to tell, what gave rise to what. Yes, for eg. Software Requirement Specification will be derived from Customer Requirement Specification . similarly, Detailed design is made of Architectural and Requirement specs, etc. So a link across all the affected documents is also made explicitly known, for the sake of maitaining consistency and hence quality of the product deliverded. Since we have a process defined now, its tailored or customised for a project. for eg. we might have a maintenance project where there is no development phase at all. so we will tailor the ODSP to contain parts which will contain maintenance related KPAs and ignore others. This is about an organisation at level three. Now in level 4 and 5 we try to do what?yes, we try to improvise on the process defined. Yes, in Level 4 which says about " manageable " process, we try to enhance the process by using some statistical tools like control chart for measuring the deviations, Use CPM / PERT method for detecting the critical time required for completion of project , what guys if u were attentive in some OM classes, i think u can easily track what i am talking about, if not dont worry, u can always learn them once u start managing projects. In level 4, these tools are used to fine tune, what are called " Assigned causes of variation ". These are variations, which are explicit and whose causes can be assigned to one particular cause and is static. Obviously in level 5, they try to attack " Random Causes of Variation " (a clear pciture of which i can be able to give, when we get level 5 i believe) and hence " optimise " the process! ........................................................................................................ wondering why i wrote this? yes, last week i was in CMM training, since we are aspiring to be in level three, few months from now. And since we dont have a ODSP, we (a team of just 8, with, to be honed skills) are trying to evolve a process. Surprising isn't it? And so, will be busy in writing procedures, creating templates, gathering guidelines and what not, which is going to be absolutely interesting as i can see. Thought would give u guys a flavor, how Level 5 companies work and what they did to achieve this. To learn more about this, click urlLink SEI-CMM Ok then, back to local settings, yes, Jax, wish you a very happy 25th b'day! And hope to see u guys giving some inputs on latest Technology too. Bye for now

 Who says to who... - I dont know.... but after saw this, i thought abt it... what i say to god.... it is something like, I know he's good... He knows everything I know... and he knows everything still I need to know... He's up.. he's my god... I need his blessings... I do my duty... for that is my only happiness... I removed the not s, down s...from the original content. i personally feel that, if i really believe in god, then first i shld believe in myself and shld not use those words... ---------- sriprasath - machan unakku ennada achu... yeen da ippadi yellam post panra... ennamo podaaa... --------- Belated birthday wishes to our blog...

 Many More Happy returns of the Day ,Jax. Last week I was expecting a call from you. What happened? Enoy your Day!!

 Oh! My dear Enemies! Why r u trying to kill me?! Plz tell me the reason! Because this is Sultry Summer Season! Oh!My dear Enemies! Plz excuse me!



 I know I'm not good.. I know he's good... He knows everything I know... and he knows everything I don't know... He's up.. I'm down... he's my god... I need his blessings... I need his orders... I shall not fail in my duty to obey him... for that is my only happiness...

 Y do u think... spirtuality would not come with splendour??? Moreover, Meditation coincides with Divinity... coz.. both leads you to Bliss... Jax, gud... when can we have our Annual day celebration?... coming to Excellent effort by our HRD ministry: Although the right to speech / express ur views are allowed in a democratic nation, I dont think coming out with points like kicha has mentioned is _____ ....... It seems to be very hypothetical... Before commenting something we should take into consideration of what really we are meaning... May be / Not IIM Fee cut reduces its quality output / input... Actually coming into consideration of loans... Banks provide loans only if u do have a high security... And, Let us know first what the IIMs really do with the huge amount it receives now from the students as well from grants... and how the fee slash is going to affect its performance .... after that let us start our arguements / discussion... if u see, CDAC, C-DOT, ISRO, DOS, Military (Most of the PSU) are paying less for their employees compared to outside private units... do you feel any quality lack in it???

 Meditation is just a process that leads to a state of consciousness that brings serenity, clarity, and bliss... And just that and nothing more than that...!! It has got no direct correlation with God or divinity, but only that the meditater could use his new-found bliss for any good things that he may ascertain to take up... and in his views "good things" may encompass spirituality... The reason why meditation finds links to Godliness is more because the "teachers" of meditation find no other better way to attract people to this amazing art... after all, in the name of God, people are even ready to do things non-sensical to the common sense... this stems from the homegrown "fear" of God... and the attitude of bargain - get me passed in the exam and I would break 108 coconuts (as though God asked for it)... Often, meditation also finds links with religiousness rather than spirituality... and these days the former takes root at the expense of the latter... A reason for the Srirangam tragedy (where 40 people, mostly women and children, were burnt in a marriage hall) was given that "the temple failed to perform a vital ritual and such a tragedy was always on the cards" ... Rubbish..!! Would the "holy" person dare utter this line if he was a victim's kin...!! He would rather be better off trying to help the victims if he can or else keep his mouth shut...!!!! Another classic example of spirituality lost in splendour is the ISKCON temple in Bangalore... that seems to be growing into a market place rather than a spiritual avenue... The contemporary "teachers" of meditation are no different... they use this "fear" of God to inculcate this practice... except a few organizations, quite a few are more interested in the business of teaching meditation rather than the service of helping people find peace...

 A year of blogging. One year! I cannot believe it. Exactly 12 months ago, I came across this new phenomenon that was spreading across the web. The phenomenon was called blogging . Actually, I was searching for something else. The concept of blogging seemed wonderful. Posting one's thoughts to the web immediately. It was a kind of a diary/journal. Online, accessible from anywhere by anyone. Then I took some time to understand what it was all about. I came across several wonderful blogs. The concept had been taken to great heights by several of those I had come across. Then came an idea of having a team blog. But before that I needed to have a sandbox to play around. 'All in a day's work!' became that sandbox. For a couple of weeks, I made myself comfortable with the concepts of blogging. Soon by the end of last February, ' All in a day's work! ' was let loose with the help of three more members. Soon others joined, the ranks swelled. Overall, it has been a tremendous year with lots of things learnt and discussed. What was your experience? Tell me what was it like?

 A Doctor approached his patient and said "I have a Bad and Worse news for you" Patient Cried in fear "Plz tell me the Bad news first!" Doctor replied "You're going to live only for 24 Hours!" Patient Screamed and said "How a news can be worse than this?!" Doctor said " I was trying to contact you since yesterday".

 It was ghost&rsquo;s time on Saturday night when I called up Sumathy and told her &ldquo;I am planning to go to Dhianalinga temple tomorrow morning&rdquo; . As like you, she was also taken aback. With sumi&rsquo;s perseverance I got up by 4&rsquo; O clock. When I started my vehicle it was 6 sharp. Except 2 or 3 milk vala&rsquo;s and five to six buffaloes I am the only awaken living being. Filling my tummy with a tumbler of milk and my bike with 3 litres of fuel, I raised my throttle. Dhianalinga was erected at the foothills of vellingiri. Mind started expecting too much as it does always. I Imagined myself driving in to the deep woods with BSA Slr advt lion crossing the other side. Cool breeze ended up in drizzling.I became a bit confused when I was unable to select BPL Mobile, my home network itself. Later I realized it was BPL Mobile, Kerala and not Tamilnadu. Only when I quivered, I found tat the road beneath is of stones and not tar. For sure I am out of Coimbatore.Other than twice to reaffirm the direction, I gave my victor no chance to have a deep breathe. Thou enthused by the travel, &ldquo; IS IT WORTH IT? &rdquo; clouded my mind. The second my wheels touched the mud road, the environment was immediately painted with green. At one moment a big crow crossed my head from left to right. Only after applying the brakes to check how big is the crow, I found tat it is not a crow but a peacock. &ldquo;Peacock and lion both are wild animals&rdquo; I told myself and added more value to my travel. When I stopped by a tea shop and asked for &lsquo;dhianlinga temple&rsquo; eyebrows raised and exclaimed &ldquo;who sent u in this direction?&rdquo; Annoyed, I was about to turn my way back. Bulb glowed in my brain when I heard &ldquo;only Siva temple is 2 kms away&rdquo; and rolled my wheels towards Shiva temple (As) &lsquo;Dhianalinga&rsquo;. There were sacks tied to every tree and with markers it read &lsquo;please use dust bin&rsquo;. Good to see people had followed. Between the leaves of the trees, like a smaller sun was the yellow doom of the temple. A security in uniform, dressed like that of a corporate one welcomed. After verifying if this is my first visit he conveyed the same to some one over the phone. He also asked me to wait until &lsquo;ji&rsquo; comes. Ji (must be in his later 20&rsquo;s) greeted and took me to a small museum kinda room. He xplained me the history of Dhianalinga. Dhianalinga was erected by Sadhguru, who claims to have attained divinity. He guided a virtual tour of the temple thru a portrait. He then took me to a tank of water filled with Lotus and wanted me to take and offer to Dhianlinga, if I wish. After showing me the places of needs he left me at the entrance and posted me a constraint of maintaining silence.My first sight inside the temple landed on four to five symbols of various religions. &lsquo;only Hindu&rsquo;s after this line&rsquo; in Madurai Meenakshi temple flashed in my mind. Steps were not enclosed by copper, instead it gave me the feeling of being massaged. Ji have quoted me that the steps would open the inner valves of the foot. The temple was built encircling the Linga. The roof was a semi spherical structure built with bricks and dust from the forest. If true, that it is built without concrete it is a miracle then. Interesting, to see mother forest worshipped. The chamber where Linga is placed is the temple by itself. Except a mercury lamp hanged high, there were 9 oil lamps . No poojas, no iyer, no bells but an appreciated temple of Coimbatore. At the point where the spherical roof ends, there were hovels to comfort a 6 feettall or a 3 feet fat person. They are meant for practicing meditation. Though I was unable to talk to Linga as conveyed by ji I understood &lsquo;meditation soothes&rsquo; . An hour have passed when I completed meditation!!! and examined the temple sculptures (hardly 3 or 4). When a team of college gals wondered how good the temple is, a girl in saffron rushed to keep them silent. The weather was as pleasant as it begun for the day. My travel, the environment, the linga, the nature, the meditation thou unable to make out which, something has given me peace and a sense of accomplishment. Supplied with handful of pamphlets and information on the forthcoming Shivrathri events I walked to the parking lane. Once I turned up to see the yellow doom might be to convey &ldquo;I will be back&rdquo; To my surprise I had 4 idli&rsquo;s and 3 dosas on the way and they collected Rs.10 for tat and that is a different story. I am mulling over a question and want you also to. The question is &ldquo;Meditation is always associated with God, isn&rsquo;t that different from divinity or is it not?&rdquo; Anbe sivam Balachander click Dhianalinga for more

 Now that the fee cut for the elitist IIMs has been announced... after careful thought and consideration the following steps need to be urgently announced.. 1. Do away with the CAT, GD and Personal interviews... After all higher education cannot be the choice of just the intellectual few... Every Tom, Dick and Harry has an equal say to it... And since CAT, GD, and the Personal interviews were separating the elitist from the non-elitist, they have to be discarded... 2. Introduce a new quota for the kith and kin of Government employees... they are the most underprivileged of the lot... 3. Decide the curriculum... Mr.Joshi being a Ph.D. himself... who better a person to decide the curriculum than the erudite Dr.Joshi… 4. Day-1 companies during campus interviews should be the PSUs... and there need to be a rule that the top 50 brains in the IIMs should necessarily stay in PSUs... after all, isn't the country losing the best brains to the MNCs..

 I dont know how to formally begin for a book review. Particularly a book from such a distinguished scientist and Honorary President of India. In this book, Dr.Kalam provides insights about his interaction with young minds of India. Dr.Kalam has taken case-studies from almost all spheres of India to illustrate how the young people in particular the students think about their dream to live in a developed Nation. Dr.Kalam see his Role-model through celebraty leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Albert Einstein etc. Dr.Kalam has spread the message of National Integration in every page of this book. One important message Dr.Kalam points out in this book is that amalgamation of Science and Religion would make an enriched nation. "When A.R.Rahman sings Vande Matram, he is seen as an Indian not as a Muslim". This statement made me to think about a scene from the Movie Kovil(Although it was a comedy scene, the message was very powerful). Dr. Kalam assures only the young Indian People can make the dream to happen "India 2020" (a developed Nation). A developed Nation can happen only when a country is self-sufficient in education, defence, non-poverty and social scenario. India is rich in natural resources. Only if we tap and use the natural resources in an effective and efficient way, we can able to become a powerful nation. An example, Dr.Kalam points out is the Jamshedpur Steel Plant. Instead of me saying all those points, I recommend all the members to read this book compulsarily. This book is not just to Ignite the young minds, but our minds(all the Indians) too!

 Dont worry about its an election ploy or its the real truth.... Even last week BW had a cover story!!! But I feel, one should think about what he/she has done to make INDIA shine!!! only then he is eligible to criticize others... Superb designs.. man.... will Rank Three soon..... (when time permits) Cheers....

 Ok Ram, I guess that shows how the laws work. Ha ha ha... Since you had asked for it, here are the five basic laws of stupidity. Always and inevitably everyone underestimates the number of stupid individuals in circulation. The probability that a certain person be stupid is independent of any other characteristic of that person. A stupid person is a person who causes losses to another person or to a group of persons while himself deriving no gain and even possibly incurring losses. Non-stupid people always underestimate the damaging power of stupid individuals. In particular non-stupid people constantly forget that at all times and places and under any circumstances to deal and/or associate with stupid people always turns out to be a costly mistake. A stupid person is the most dangerous type of person. Confused, read a more detailed explanation urlLink here . When I had siad, i'm looking out for designs, I meant something like urlLink this urlLink list .

 What do you think of the latest " urlLink India Shining " ads by the Government or now the caretaker government? Is this an election ploy or is it the truth? Interestingly, there has been a lot of criticism over the ads from various sources. This week's Hindu had an thought provoking urlLink article . What do you think about it?

 U havent provided link for the urlLink Laws of Stupidity ... what do you mean by RSS reader? dont worry Manny, Ithuvum kadanthu pogum.... ha ha ha Cheers

 Hi all, A blog from kavi and that too saying that she is free from work... Wonder but true... Could this also happen...immm...

 I read an interesting article on human stupidity. It is a pretty much long article, but it is kind of interesting. Read "The Basic Laws of Stupidity". It is been a couple of weeks since I posted some laws. So consider this as a continuation from where I left off. So urlLink Friday the Thirteenth . And Tomorrow is urlLink Saturday the Fourteenth . urlLink Valentine 's day. Wonderful. I am looking out for new designs for this blog and urlLink QSS . Anyone having any good color schemes, send them to me. BTW, does anyone else use a RSS reader?

 Friday the 13th...!! Any takers..??

 Jax.. I am not able to see the latest blogger lay out. I am using windows 2000 . Why is that so... You all know I am bit free from work. See you

 If you look at this urlLink site You will remember Dr. P. C. Sekhar. Cheers

 Return of the King... !!!!

 Sri Prasath, Take a magnifying lens or use Search options from Windows to find out ur name in this bloggers group! Hahaha!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

 Its ok, if its a tedious work leave as such... and as I was bit relaxed, I thought of reading ur links... (Branding etc... ) since I couldnt find in the current page, hence had a look in to the archives as usual... but noticed its upside down... Thatz the reason I bugged it today instead of the same during ur layout review...... Gud Man, that urlLink blog has grown a lot with large no. of posts... its around 3 weeks back I had a look when u categorized things over there.... yeah, there I noticed the archives are in normal way... r u using Javascript over there? coming to "Thoughts", I have to think later!!! Then info_logs shows the frequency of visitors is getting to average level this month, isn't it? Cheers

 Sorry Ram, I thought about and also looked. Blogger does not have an option. It can be worked around. But that means I would have to dirty my hands with Javascript, which I don't want to. There are already too many scripts running in the blog. One for the blogroll (which I have plans of replacing), a couple for the "recent posts" section, another couple for the website visitors and referrers. I think everyone should visit the logs. Click on the image. You'll get to know find amazing information from it. If you want, I can sort and put the archives listing in the descending order, I'll add it to my to-do list. No posts on your "Thoughts", Have you forgotten it? BTW, if anyone is still linking to my Quod scripsi scripsi blog hosted on blogspot (http://jaxsays.blogspot.com), please update it to the new one ( urlLink http://jaxsays.weblogs.us ) and I have deleted the blog hosted on blogspot.

 Jax, Just 2day I noticed that it would be nice if we have the current archive's list in the reverse order... Thats recent in the first row towards the actuall_first in the last row... Others, Any thought? coming to kicha's Know (K)not, I feel its just for a companion sake... (moreover its a well to do & decent job only)... Only for company's sake means No brandy shop owners will get a bride!!! and other gender-specific roles also? Its similar to finding wouldbe's in the local sorounding itself instead of geting from 50000 miles away although they are of same caste, creed etc.... I think, its better not to think about these things... Rini, while reading ur splendid summary I can visualize what all could have occurred... but sorry anyway missed the event, let us c a year later... Cheers Ram

 Valli - Cyprus Semiconductors Sinduja K - Wipro Ramya R - don't know Vinitha - healthcare company Ranjini - Wipro Ramya P - Deutsche s/w No prizes for guessing what they are... But if this is any indication, there seems to be a minor inclination on part of the parents to getting their daughters married to someone who has had a similar education as her... Irrespective of the girl working after marriage or not, there seems to be a mindset that there might be a better understanding if the two have learnt similar things in their "student" life.. or is it..?? I'm saying "similar learning in student life" because in quite a few cases the girl may not work post-marriage or after some period after marriage... So, the case of having relatively "similar job nature" and "similar work pressure" and "similar timings" cannot be made generic... So, what could be the big idea... does learning similar things as students got to do anything with better understanding in marital life... If so, which kinda parents would get their daughters married to the umpteen marketing professionals, does a financial consulant necessarily need a wife who did something sort of MBA Finance, so that they understand better in their life... or is it all only confined to the big fella called "Information Technology"... ??? PS: Only arranged marriages are in the purview...!!

 Vasanta Habba! If North India is known for celebrating the Arrival of spring with colours, Bangaloreans have found a novel way of inviting it with Arts. Yes, its VasantaHabba, the popular "Festival of Spring". It is a dusk to dawn programme with Dance and Music forming the glory of the time. Celebrated every first Saturday of February, this was its 13th year. The first half of the day/night starts around 6 o'clock, filled with stunning performances of some professional and some to-be professional ensembles of three different dance schools and goes on till midnight. The next half sings about music and only music. This year the performers who stole the stage were stalwarts in their own schools. It was like all under one roof or u can call it as a Dance and Music supermarket, where in they hosted a variety of concertos to pickup, which no other event can boast about. Nrityagram, the Dance school which hosts Vasantahabba, aims at not only bringing Classical / refined forms of art to public, but also the basic forms such as folk dances into the premises of the public. So did it start with patronising "Dollu kunitas" where the Dancers do dance and create a pattern of music with their big drums, which they carry. Full of Raw energy, really it was amazing to see them perform with good beats and heats of sound with uniformity. Then on the line-up awaited us, the Village Ensemble, where in the children, belonging to the nearby places of Nrityagram, did give a really impressive program. Yes, first was the school of Odissi students on the go. The uniformity, the costume, the expressions were something so good, that one would really fall in love with Odissi, at the very site of its performers. Kathak, is one more form of dance which was displayed with village children, is unique in its own way with lots of twists and turns and as any dance form, needs to have a subtle expressiveness more in account and so did the performance too was. Bharathanatyam - Bha - "Bhava", Ra - "Raga", Tha - "Thala". So, there were all the three elements of dance in the presentation to us. Village Ensemble did prepare us for the heavy dance feast waiting for us. First, started the Bharathnatyam performance by Priyadarshini Govind, who took us to various moods under different themes of her performance. While she went from her Main act on Devi's Samhara of Demon, It did kill the demons out there, and as a symbol of victory, brought in rains too. Rain was the pleasant surprise visitor and she did invite it with a dance of inviting Krishna to a devotee's consort. She did insist on dancing in Lord Varuna's(lord of Rain)abode and so, the visitor had to get back, when she performed an excellent piece on Lord Shiva. The tailpiece of Vande Mataram, did tie everyone to the motherland! Nevertheless the audiences were the most enthusiastic of all times. In Odissi, The movements are so graceful that, it gives a feel that, its more feminine. It was hard to believe the All-male Odissi performance of Dasavathara-The ten incarnations of Lord Vishnu by the native performers of Orissa. High spirits that had risen was then subdued by a martial art and classical contemporary dance mix up performance by Astad Deboo. Of course, initially, it was not so legible, to much of the audience, coz of the subtle and fragmental movement, but its the high degree of control to exhibit such movements was the one which kept the audience tied up to the show. Oops, a Bhangda then to make u smell the wheat after harvest......... It was a surprise act and so did the audience liven up to the performance. Meanwhile a trailor of what’s going to be the performance in 2005 from Odissi dance school was played to lure the dance enthusiasts, the next year too. Oh, lots of variety in dance and the time now has flew to Midnight and was time for Music concerts to start. The first artist in that section was the all time audience favourite, Bombay Jayshree. So calm and composed was her concert, with few beautiful embellishments like Nannu palimpa, Krishna nee begane, and et al. Of course how would the audience leave such a sweet artist who hasn’t fussed to get herself booked at a midnight slot, without asking once more? yes, they did so, and so did she sing one more thillana to quench their desire! Then was a Sitar-Violo cello duet concert which was a feast to the audience ears. The music of Sitar is so vibrating and it, blended with the customised coarse sound of Violo cello, kept the audience awake till the end. "mile sur mera tumhara" is what the artist told and started playing once again, when the audience asked one more! Followed by it was Kadri Gopalnath's Sax concert where in he really lived up to the audience by playing lots of familiar pieces like Alaipauthey, Kurai ondrum illai, Brahma mokhate, Krishna nee begane et al. Antaragini was a Bangalore local band, gone to international level in their performance these days and they were the ones to touch the audience next. Great was their, effort to keep the audience live by giving some enthuse pieces of music. Ya, they were also, no exceptions to audience' "one more" request and had to abide them by singing one of their most sought after piece, "Mysore se". Last in the line up was "Indian ocean", a kind of fusion music which we dint find time to witness, coz of time constraint. Oh, how many performances and all performances were not less in anyway and unique in their own way and my god, i can't imagine how they managed to organise and coax performers for midnight and after midnight slots in the chill weather of Bangalore. Whistles and applause were some of the best gifts, which all artists would never, forgot to take from the audience. For all those artists, who were accustomed to disciplined fans, these kind of casual fans must have been a different ambience altogether. And the audience were one of the most unique, with people thronging from all parts of B'lore and from villages near by, climbing on wall, near by trees and what not, to get a glimpse of what’s going on..... With a fond memory of having witnessed an excellent event, i await for the next year celebration too.

 Right jax.. thats the one...

 Thatz a gud story on alms... But our famous Thirukural (more than 2000 yrs old)... has info on anything... Just v left as a school day literature without imbibing its contents to our nature.... Then how was the dusk to dawn programme? Cheers Ram

 hi friends, caught up with some training. so couldnt blog. Kavi is blogging??!!!!! Sri that was a good and interesting piece of info. And here is one small story on gifting which i would like to share with u .......... **************************************************** Hatim Tai had a great reputation among the Arabs of old for the lavishness of his gifts and alms. “Have you ever met anyone more excellent than yourself?” his friends once asked him. “Yes,” replied Hatim Tai. “Who was he?” “One day I had forty camels sacrificed and I offered a feast to whoever would like to come and share in it. Then I set out with several chiefs to invite guests from far and wide. On the way we came across a woodcutter who had just cut a bundle of thorns. This was the way he earned his livelihood. Seeing that he was poor, I asked him why he did not go to the many feasts given by Hatim Tai. `Those who earn their living,' he answered me, `have no need of the bounty of Hatim Tai.' “ Why then did Hatim Tai declare that the woodcutter was a better man than himself? It was because he thought it nobler to work and to provide for oneself than to give others gifts which cost no effort or sacrifice and which, moreover, discourage them from being self-reliant. Of course it is quite natural that friends should give presents to their friends; it is good that strong arms should come to the help of the poor and the needy; but an able-bodied man should work with his hands, not hold them out for alms. Of course this implies no reflection on those who consecrate themselves entirely to the contemplative life and the search for wisdom. ************************************************* will be back with a tale on Vasantahabba -a festival of spring celebrated @b'lore to which i had been this weekend.



 Oneday Philip Kotler took classes for IIM - A students and Illustrated the marketing concepts by means of a live example under different real time situations. You see a gorgeous girl at a party. You go up to her and say, "I am very rich.Marry me!" That's Direct Marketing. You're at a party with a bunch of friends and see a gorgeous girl. One of your friends goes up to her and pointing at you says, "He'svery rich.Marry him." That's Advertising. You see a gorgeous girl at a party. You go up to her and get her telephone number. The next day you call and say "Hi,I'm very rich.Marry me." That's Telemarketing. You're at a party and see a gorgeous girl. You get up and straighten your tie, you walk up to her and pour her a drink. You open the door for her, pick up her bag after she drops it, offer her a ride, and then say, "By the way, I'm very rich.Will you marry me?" That's Public Relations. You're at a party and see a gorgeous girl. She walks up to you and says, "You are very rich.." That's Brand Recognition. You see a gorgeous girl at a party. You go up to her and say, "I'm rich.Marry me" She gives you a nice hard slap on your face. That's Customer Feedback !!!!! You see a gorgeous girl at a party. You go up to her and say, "I am very rich.Marry me!" And she introduces you to her husband That's Demand and supply gap. You see a gorgeous girl at a party. You go up to her and before you say, "I am very rich.Marry me!" she turns her face towards you ------------ she is your wife ! That's competition eating into your market share.

 Hi all, Continuing my previous post on urlLink "Soft Drinks & Hard Truths" ... Hope you all would have heard about the JPC's report and the aftermath... Now its time to act... take from nature than from coke and pepsi.

 Please mark my attendance in blogger rajeshPrabu.G

 Here's another silly wonder that we could ponder on.. just like the 'hotel' thing that bala sent... "Why do (generally) women grow long hair.. while men prefer to keep it short." I put that 'generally' in bracket because these days women also tend to keep their hair short.. at times as short as men, if not shorter... and while there are men too who like to keep their's as long as women, if not longer... But having said that, its been a norm down the generations that as we utter the word "girl", "woman" and any of its sibling synonyms we visualize a homo sapien with a longer hair... When would this ever have begun..?? Stone-Age humans would never have thought of cutting their hair... in fact, they started dressing with leaves and twigs only after quite a while as their 6th sense of civilization began gradually to take root... But this case happened for both men and women of stone-age.. but how did the "cutting the hair short" thing held on only with the male species... I do have my explanation for this.. but would like to hear from u too...

 Ctrl+Alt+Del Inventor Retires Today The engineer who invented the Ctrl+Alt+Del keystroke combination is retiring today from IBM, leaving behind his legacy as an inexorable part of the PC experience. David Bradley developed the key combination while working on prototypes of IBM's first PC. He needed a way to quickly reboot the buggy machine because a hard reset--which involved flicking off the power switch and waiting a few moments before retoggling it--took too much time. "The intention was to be cryptic," he said. "It was a key combination that was the moral equivalent of turning the power off and back on again, so it was not an action to be taken lightly. It wasn't something you wanted to happen accidentally." Today, many people use the keystroke combination on a regular basis and not always because the machine has become unresponsive. Microsoft adopted the keystroke combination for use in Windows; today's Windows versions use the combination to let people log on to the system and to bring up a diagnostic screen. "I might have invented Ctrl+Alt+Del but, as I like to say, Bill Gates made it famous," Bradley joked.

 Nice links on various types of personalities. It was interesting too. I have added more urlLink book reviews and a urlLink movie review at urlLink QSS . BTW, I have not enabled comments on many of my recent posts. What is your opinion, should they be enabled or disabled? I would like to enable them, provided they are used. No use in enabling comments and no comments are present. Rajesh had come home last evening. Vijay had called. Watched a lot of movies, (reviews soon) and books (reviews urlLink here ). Other than that the last week has been spent deleting hundreds of virii infected mails. Still deleting them... That's why I could not mail/reply to anyone. On the work front, a coupe of days absence has precipitated a lot of pending tasks. I am striving hard to complete them asap . Rini, the colors were nice, but the best thing I liked was the use of asterisks in the title. It was fabulous. Hope to see a lot more posts in the future on flowers. BTW, any snaps of your garden available. Manny, the link you gave didn't work. Send it to my postmark id. Any luck with FrameMaker tutorials???

 To know about yourself... visit urlLink Enneagram and let your views... on the same... over here... Cheers...

 Its human psychology that we prefer to maintain a distance from a stranger... Here's the actual theory behind it from a urlLink psychology source ... People surround themselves with a "bubble" of personal space that they claim as their own, and they tend to become stressed when other people invade their "bubble." Ashton and colleagues found that when they asked pairs of friends and strangers to stand at various distances from each other, both men and women felt more comfortable when an opposite-sex friend stood close (about 1.5 feet) than when a stranger of either sex stood at that distance.



 CardCaptor and Pokemon are the modern cartoons strips running very successfully world over in both print and visual media..

 Since you believe that Sun's heat causes evaporation of see water and produces Rain during a particular season because EaRth revolves around it.... similarly if you believe saturns movement decides your success... THEN IT will FOR SURE HAVE a DeEp IMPact on ANY1 wHo BeLieVes.....!!!! Cheers

 It was an interesting piece that rini has shared with us... one thing is that the measurements used to arrive at the supposedly precise date of Lord Ram's birth is based on planetary positions... And this has been the very root of any astrological theory... horoscopes are mainly based on 12 (if I'm not mistaken) objects that constitute the planetory standings... Now my question is how does it really get to affect our lives... if at all it does... How does a saturn moving from a left to a right have an impact on whether I would succeed in an exam or not...

 bit rot n. [common] Also bit decay. Hypothetical disease the existence of which has been deduced from the observation that unused programs or features will often stop working after sufficient time has passed, even if `nothing has changed'. The theory explains that bits decay as if they were radioactive. As time passes, the contents of a file or the code in a program will become increasingly garbled. There actually are physical processes that produce such effects (alpha particles generated by trace radionuclides in ceramic chip packages, for example, can change the contents of a computer memory unpredictably, and various kinds of subtle media failures can corrupt files in mass storage), but they are quite rare (and computers are built with error-detecting circuitry to compensate for them). The notion long favored among hackers that cosmic rays are among the causes of such events turns out to be a myth; see the cosmic rays entry for details. The term software rot is almost synonymous. Software rot is the effect, bit rot the notional cause. More such interesting computer jargons can be found urlLink here !

 What are ur plans for the day? Chennaites wake up and catch kavitha for a treat and i give u all rights to have my share of treat too! Have fun!

 here is some more news about new locations(both mine and srini's too)! My new office is in a laneadjacent to the old building and both buildings are connected by a staircase at the terrace. so my office address is still the same! And ram, u gave the caption, but only when u define, others will know what the caption means. so Kavis words were self-explanatory! About Srini's location, SanJose is his destination for the next 45 days. Its popularly known as Silicon valley and located in California. Its situated in the West coast where temp. is moderately cool, unlike east coast areas which is very cold , where our valli and vinitha reside! Nearest big city is San Francisco. He is going for a KT(Knowledge Transfer) session regarding his Cisco project. Hope this info. would suffice! ok then , got to do lots of packing and shopping. so bye for now.

 Kavi, I know where San-Jose is located "its in USA, :)" But I asked Rini, About where her new office is located???? Too confused ah... have some more... what u have conveyed in a para for about 4 - 5 lines I have conveyed in just 2 words (by furnishing ur earlier selfs with a new caption ) Cheers

 Rini, basically the difference between both is How you want to project yourself, in other words how you want others to perceive you irrespective of your actual nature and what you are. When you do something for your outer self, most of the times it's all to do with what others will say, what they will think, all possible kind of pretention. Innerself is what you think, what you hear from you, who you are...... Being myself is the time when I can express my innerself without having the fear of being rejected for anything. Ram, I din't mean the outer look or heart feeling. Rini..Give us more update on what kind of work srini is going to do at onsite? Even I don't know where it's located. Then..Today I stayed in office itself. We are having an audit for CMMI in April. My PL is going onsite this weekend. So we sat all through the night and finished something. Buy..see you then

 Rini I think, By inner self Kavi means ones-"Heart feeling" and outer self she talks about ones-"outside look"...... Is it rt? Gud.... Convey my wishes to Srini!!!! Then... where is it located? Cheers

 what do this inner self and outer self mean? can u elaborae a bit on it for me please.... btw, anybody interested too can help her and me too in discussing things about it! i would love to read 'em all!

 Hei guys, our company is in the expanding phase, which i have told u before. so now we have leased a new building and now i am into that building! So every thing is new and fresh! feels good except for the absence of AC, which will become operational in a day or too. provided with a new phone too. but what is the use, when i needed it before wedding, it wasnt there, and now..... hardly we talk over phones. Only thing is, naan mundhi mathiri o.p. adikka mudiyathu, coz my cubicle is just infront of my PM's room. How bad!Ok, atleast from now on, let me start working.......... Hei one more thing guys, ya, Srini is moving to Sanjose on 2nd of next month and will be there for 6 weeks. will be back by may 3rd week. so till then, i will have to manage things all alone. Hope to do a good job! not a pretty tough job i believe! y, these days, there arent much posts guys? Post more!

 Since My exam got postponed, I am not coming to banaglore tomorrow. They haven't mailed about the reschedule. So I don't know when it will be. To Rini's question, My answer is When I can do whatever I want to.. without giving a second thought about it . When I am not bothered much about my outer self . It's the time for anyone to hear more from their inner self. Being with anyone who can accept you as you are. See you guys... Kavi

 That was the headline in today's Deccan Herald. I switched on the TV this morning... MTV was showing the song "Hum ko hai pura yakin..." - a song made for the World Cup '03 to motivate the team.... [V] was showing the latest hit "Jeet Lo Dil.." the official song of the Samsung Cup... NDTV shows y'day's press conference... If u thought that's passion for the game.. then here's more.. Infy is broadcasting today's match Live in the big-screen...!! So much for being passionate... Its amazing to notice how a sporting event raises so much nerves bringing the entire country on its toes.. Lets get to the other side of the whirlwind... there have also been scattered deliberations of the "unnecessary" adulation given to cricket when there are innumerable people just down the street who wouldn't care for who plays or who wins as long as they find enough to satiate their hunger... or sparing a thought for the jawans on the border who are eating bullets for breakfast and dinner... There have been occasions in the past when the fans themselves have gone overboard.. a case being the burning effigies of Indian players when they lost to Australia in a preliminary World Cup match... Where was this "anger" when coach S6 was burning in Godra... where was this "anger" when Fr.Staines was burnt alive... this list would never end... There is a very thin line between just being passionate about a game as an individual and seizing things to the deepest of emotional depths... Being passionate is not wrong... as long as we believe that its just 11 guys playing a sport and trying to give their best... But monitization and politicization by the media and politicians does go a distance in fuelling phony emotions that is far from the margins of "love for the game"... Its the "love" for the game that is important and healthy.. and not an irrational, emtionally inflicted passion...

 I want all the lyrics of ayitha ezhuthu... the one who sends it first will win 1000 por kaasu... and all u people.. make sure u listen to the songs.. haven't heard Yuva yet.. but the tamil version is very good... a really different Rahman... in particular he has outdone himself in Jana gana mana.. I'm eager to see this film...

 Very interesting question by Rini... "But what makes u feel urself.." let me try to make an exhaustive list.. When I do what "I" like to do.. when I have the freedom to do everything "I" want to do... when I have my dear one(s) near me... when I see that smile on the face of the special someone... when I can express myself with a wide genuine smile... when someone cries for me.. when someone smiles for me… when I know I have one, to do these two for me… when that person is near me.. when someone tells me "I miss u"… I may not be exhaustive.. this is all that I could manage at my level of spontaneity… but this does make me a point... a lot depends on the companion you are with – parent or friend or spouse... depending on what stage of your life you are in... its that companion and that companionship that imbibes a sense of belonging.. to instill an "all is not lost" feeling when all seems lost to you.. to re-instate what you are composed of.. and to make u feel yourself..

 Hi all, Seeing the last couple of posts by urlLink Rini and urlLink Kicha people might think that I have given up blogging. They seem to speak in the trend of pre- and post- eras. Hmmm.... I think Kicah has been doing too much reading and Rini too much thinking. As Kicha has pointed out, I may not be able to blog as much as I usually did in the past, you can blame the lack of net access at Manny's company for that. But if you had noticed, I had posted a few posts at urlLink QSS in the recent past.

 Good to see a flurry of activity... I guess jax might not have access to net... so activity is likely to decrease on his part... so its up to the others to make up for that.. I had been to madurai this past weekend... I too have to take up the exam Kavi is referring to.. though at a later date... But considering a few other things coming my way and considering my limits and priorities.. I'm not one bit confident of taking up this exam in the next 2 months or so... still counting my options... But this is mandatory for everyone in our dept... and I become answerable to my heads in this aspect.. lets see...

 Oh, atlast some body new had cared to blog ! But still so many thoongu moonjis are yet to awake! oru hi koodava solla mudiyaathu? Ithula Rajesh vera, mulichittu irukaravanayum, thongattumgraan.... and kicha, konjam overa illa, un blogging saga post? ellarum konjam busy aayittanga, odane....... I could see the vacant space created mostly coz of Jax's absence. but then, i think we will revive soon once he is back. Hmmmmm so busy with ur life kavi?!! Ok then, take care

 Yes, yesterday's match was so good! Though i got little time to watch, since i was held up cooking for more than half a dozen guests crowded at our place, i enjoyed watching it! Ofcourse, it was not a thrilling match, but the way we enjoyed it all together, cracking jokes, what will happen, if an announcement is made that, the next match winner will get Kashmir! If such an announcement is made, then......... The story reeled on and on , containing Musharaf as opening batsman in Pak. team and Vajpayee as Opening bowler and what not comments and arrikais will be there and who would umpire them? None other than Bush ofcourse! Really, socialising is always a vibrant task esp. when it comes to people of same circle or simply speaking among friends. This I realise, every time when there is a small gathering of friends at home. It gives me the energy to live with for the whole week and no wonder i anticipate weekends like anything and start planning for the next one, the very second its over! I have seen people enjoying themselves, if they could feel the belongingness and if they feel "themselves" at home. And if, somebody is not able to coz of his/her own constraint or due to outer constaints, then every moment u spend is like spending it in hell though u grin all the time outwards! But what makes u feel urself is a question which always pops up in my mind when i see such events. Can anybody help me in finding an answer?

 After a long time..I read a book. 'Tuesdays with Morrie' by Mitch Album. I liked this book so much. Mitch narrates the final days of his professor Morrie . This book talks about human values, Regrets,Emotions,Marriage & lot more. Had a good feeling after reading this book. What happened? No blogs for long time. I am preparing for my exam now. Since my project itself taking lot of my time.. It's tough for me to find time to prepare for the exam. But anyway I sent an confirmation mail. But ????.I will be coming to bangalore this thursday to write the exam. Bangalorians send me your contact numbers to my infosys id. I have to come back to chennai on friday itself. So I think i can meet only kishore & Ram @ infy. I will talk to others over phone. Okay...bye guys..see you.. Sindhu..where are you? It's been so long since you posted anything.. Cheers....Kavitha

 Hey goodbye Nanba are the words hummed by today's Yuvans and Yuvathis(Yuva's). The Maniratnam classic has done it again. The trio comprising Mani, A.R.Rahman and Vairamuthu has been success from Roja. I bought the CD of Aayatha Ezuthu with a roughtough fight on March 15, the release date. The cost of the CD is Rs.125/- released by Sony Music. Mind you the CD is copyprotected. Don't try to Pirate the cD. Lets get into Business 1.Hai Goodbye Nanba By Sunitha Sarathy, Shankar Mahadevan, A.R.Rahman, Karthik All of us know about Silmisam. What is Kalmisam? if Anybody know the meaning plz explain me. This song has a touch of youthfulness with a low pitch female Voice and staggering high pitch male voice. This song distinguishes the difference friendship and love. Siddarth and Trisha will choreograph for this song. 2.Janaganamana By A.R.Rahman, Karthik This songs rises the youthfulness in today's yuvas. I thought Rahman might have replicated Vande Mataram. But he did not. This song emphasises the youth capabilities, their strengths their ability to chop down the social and political bottlenecks. (Vairamuthu may get national award for this song) 3.Sandai Kozhi by Madhusree, A.R.Rahman In Tamil poetry there is a term called "Oodal". Themed in folk, this song well explains the love feelings of soulmates after pink ponk fights. 4.Dol Dol By Blazee, Shaheen AKthar This is the theme song of the film. The English verse of Blazee and Electrical Percussion of Shaheen Akthar is good. But this song is as good as "Yennendurum Punnai" from Alaipayuthey. 5.Nenjam ellam Kathal By Adnan Sami, Sujatha Adnan Sami tamil fame started with Shankar's Boys and now he sung for ManiRatnam. This song focusses on the difference between love and love's destination. Vairamuthu clearly explains the destiny of love. 6.Yakkai Thiri By A.R.Rahman, Shalini Singh This is a typical "Marapu Kavithai" song. It can't still find the answer what does this song mean?! I will award 8 out of 10 for this film's music.

 Might be vijay's info... but mail was forward to 'you 2 people (u & Bala)' by me... Gud Morning!!! Cheers

 hi all bloggers, read the blogs after a long time. i was not able to read the blogs for a long time.i think it was due to some s/w error. since there r not much browsing centers in kumbakonam i had no choice but to live with it. but today i tried my luck with opera & it worked. but it was alsobecause of vijay's mail i tried it today. anyway nice to see so much blogs ina variety of topics. i will try to be a regular too. bye good night.

 End of Part-1.

 the ears begin to see... I reached Bangalore at 9AM today morning... 2 hrs behind schedule.. and reached office just in time for lunch... the bus travel y'day was the best one could ever hope for... I felt I was travelling in a rocket... in fact, even better... even a rocket wouldn't have trembled that much... nor would it have been so noisy.. that bus provided a feel of both... Even though it was an AC Sleeper bus, in theory, it was a typical Govt bus in reality... Sometimes, I wonder if handing over the entire roadways to private players would make more passenger-sense...

 When the lion sleeps, don't think it is not doing any thing, it is noticing everything. Have a nice sleep lion.

 Having a nice time... sleeping in the training... not enough time to roam around the city... just went to see charminar y'day night though couldn't spend much time around that place... will be starting tonite and be in Bangalore tomorrow morning...

 It may sound strange but this is a truth, that mind is not your intelligence. Mind can be intellectual, which is a very poor substitute for intelligence. Intellectuality is mechanical. You can become a great scholar, a great professor, a great philosopher ? just playing with words which are all borrowed, arranging and rearranging thoughts, none of which are your own. The intellect is absolutely bankrupt. It has nothing of its own, all is borrowed. And that is the difference between intelligence and intellect. Intelligence has an eyesight of its own, a capacity to see into things, into problems. Intelligence is your born quality. - Extract from some mail..... **************************************************** Few more insights into the difference between an intellect and intelligent is given by writer J.Krishnamoorthy. Here is it! Intelligence, not intellect: There is a vast distinction between intellect and intelligence. Intellect is merely thought functioning independently of emotion. When intellect, irrespective of emotion, is trained in any particular direction, one may have great intellect, but one does not have intelligence, because in intelligence there is the inherent capacity to feel as well as to reason; in intelligence both capacities are equally present, intensely and harmoniously. ***********************************************

 Am going to Hyderabad tonite on an official visit for a training.. Its a short 2 day trip... and I'll be back on friday...

 "Just like a child goes through various stages of education before he reaches the University a person goes through several changes in his musical tastes before he learns to appreciate classical music. Rock, Rap, or Pop, are smaller schools of music and the very fact that somebody listens to this music means he has an ear for it. Classical music is like a university. You need to graduate to it." "Throughout history different forms of music have gained popularity but these have not taken the place of classical music. Thirty years ago if we got an audience of fifty it was considered great. Today, we can expect even 10,000 people. It is wonderful that in today's fast-paced life people do find the time for a classical concert. What is more heartening however, is that the audience is made up of young listeners, the so-called Rap generation. Does it really indicate classical music is losing out?" - Pandit Jasraj

 Rini, I'll tell u how u forgot... First, u woke in the morning... hoping to get back the feel of the good old days of going office... "old" because ur holidays almost seemed an eternity... then, u started on all ur daily chores thinking to continue as u do normally in any other week day... Then, u came to office... and as u glared at ur anti-glare monitor, thoughts of sharing ur experiences started treading the noble path to ur mind... and u started off with a quoty post and followed that with a posty post.. all the while wondering if the comprehensive mechanism for detecting if any Vital Information Resource Under Siege cases could occur on "Hi"ing at the blog subject... and a gush of the nobly treaded path of ur thoughtwave began to overflow as ur fingers started typing out the frills across those paths... and as u typed them u didn't notice what was present in the otherside of the fence in the middle of the road... As u didn't notice it u didn't put it in ur posty post.. quoty post was not supposed to have it... and posty post missed it.. And this is how u forgot... If I'm wrong.. then I'm wrong.. otherwise I'm not...

 ya, i forgot to tell u guys, that i listened to two casettes last week. Exquisite. Both were, simply exotic! One was "The best of Pandit Jasraj" and the other was Venkateswara Panch ratna mala vol-3 by M.S. These days i am falling in love with the voice of Sangeeth Maartand (as pandit is popularly known!). Especially i listened to one particular piece, "Om namoh bhagavate vasudevaya" and i felt like, he was singing it in the most beautiful way possible. yes, the flow was something so natural and true that i felt so pleasing! Ofcourse, since its a hindustani devotional kind, its rendered like a bhajan and it gave me a feel that he was teaching his followers how to sing, by profusing the rendition with more music and devotion. The other one was by M.S. Subbu lakshmi and needless to say about her for any kind of carnatic lovers. Every piece in the casette was a gem. i was attracted to all songs equally and no wonder would be my favourite for the next few weeks, till i get them by heart. Apart from this, we also bought a casette of BombayJayshri with songs on "Kashi". Need to hear some more time, to get lured by that casette. Hope i dint forget anything else. bye for now.

 Hei guys, take a look at this very good site on photography! urlLink Acclaim Stock Photography - Stock Photos, Pictures, Photographs

 Ranjini, it is good to have you back again after a week long hiatus. Ram, the site you suggested was nice. Did you suggest them for its design or the information in it? It is good to see everyone moving into newer areas in terms of opportunities. For the past one month, I seem to notice a drop in the number of posts and an increase in the number of mails. Is it a sign of the blog outliving its usefulness as a communication tool? People usually have the idea that only women ought to take care of thier skin. But the skin is really an important organ for men also. I came across an urlLink article today. Though the products specified may not be available in India, the articles anyhow gives several tips.

 Yes everybody, here i am back to work after a beaming off for a week from my work. Yes, i claimed my LTA last week and so applied leave for a week. So couldnt check blogs and update it frequently. Hei guys, Congrats on Manny's and Bala's new ventures! Good going guys. BTW Bangaloreans, did ramya priya contact any one of u guys? since i wasnt in town, i got a news that she called me up. so if u people have contact no. do pass it on to me! Would love to chat with her! Had a great time at home, finished reading Anna Karenina at last, and also one more book, a subtle humourous play by Oscar Wilde, "The importance of being Ernest". Also half way thru' "Mahabharatham". Excellent book full of life i can say, but then, its a very brief version by kirubananda vaariar and ya do u guys know any author, who has written Mahabharatham in the most comprehensive way? If so do pass on the info to me, i would like to purchase it and read it once. Or guys like kicha, ram can enquire elders in your family and let me know! Meanwhile, i too would keep my search on. Got so many other books on shelf and feel like reading them all at one stretch, but adhukkula leave mudinjiruchi. enna panrathu. anyway will finish them off soon too. ok guys, got some work, so will update later.

 ......spirituality is not a high intellectuality, not idealism, not an ethical turn of mind or moral purity and austerity, not religiosity or an ardent and exalted emotional fervour, not even a compound of all these excellent things; a mental belief, creed or faith, an emotional aspiration, a regulation of conduct according to a religious or ethical formula are not spiritual achievement and experience. These things are of considerable value to mind and life; they are of value to the spiritual evolution itself as preparatory movements disciplining, purifying or giving a suitable form to the nature; but they still belong to the mental evolution,—the beginning of a spiritual realisation, experience, change is not yet there. Spirituality is in its essence an awakening to the inner reality of our being, to a spirit, self, soul which is other than our mind, life and body, an inner aspiration to know, to feel, to be that, to enter into contact with the greater Reality beyond and pervading the universe which inhabits also our own being, to be in communion with It and union with It, and a turning, a conversion, a transformation of our whole being as a result of the aspiration, the contact, the union, a growth or waking into a new becoming or new being, a new self, a new nature.

Just came to check my mails and thought of saying a Hi to u all... Ok then....Will get back whenever possible...But why is that there are no posts from a majority of the bloggers except a few.... right...take care. Mahendran Jayavel

 My favorite Techno Director Shankar has incepted his new project with Seeyan Vickram as the hero in his film "Anniyan". The film will come out in Oscar films V.Ravichandran's Banner. Shankar has tied up with Harris Jayaraj for the Music and Background Score for the film.(A.R.Rahman gone). With Manikandan Behind the Camera, Sujatha will write the dialogues for Shankar's screenplay. Peter Hein will compose the action, while Raju Sundaram will make the Choreography. Sabu Cyril will make haste out of waste.(Art direction). The film story is made for Kamalhaasan(ROBO!), but Shankar is quite impressed with the acting of Vickram in Samy. The story is said to be an action thriller, while Vickram playing the duo role. But the questionable part is Shankar has made Jayam Sadha as the heroine of this film. (Irresistable!!!!). The film is expected to release on this year Diwali(Shankar don't make it for next year Chirstmas). For more details logon urlLink Anniyan

 By way Jax, Hope u like urlLink this site Others, quite busy!? Cheers

 Just when one begins to think that the lustre is lost... he comes up with a beaut. Meenaxi - A tale of 3 cities is nothing short of an AR Rahman magnum opus.. MF Husain's (the painter) directorial second with Tabu playing the lead role, Meenaxi is a masterpiece creation of 8 exquisite works of art.. certainly Rahman's best in Hindi.. after Taal and Lagaan. 1. Yeh Rishta (Singer: Reena Bharadwaj) Turning out as another of Rahman's revelation, Reena's debut song would have pleased many a heart. Her opening line, and the opening of her career, is as soothing as running water and just bewilders you.. Her rendition of the entire track is superb, and in particular the feeling with which she sings the title line "Yeh Rishta Kya kehe laata hai" (What does this relation signify?) could not have been more perfect... 2. Chinnamma Chilakkamma (Singer: Sukhwinder Singh) My favorite. Rahman and Sukhwinder team-up again to bring out another foot tapping number... This song is based in Hyderabad and is a blend of Telugu folk with a Punjabi twist... The song opens with a flute rendering coupled with a mild "women folk" chorus of the title line and moves into a rhythmic percussion... 3. Do Kadam aur sahi (Singer: Sonu Nigam ) A melodious melancholy... its beauty lies in it's vocal-musical melding. Rahman doesn’t add a single hard beat, yet he creates an evenly symmetrical rhythm that flows smooth... 4. Dhuan Dhuan (Singer: Asha Bhosle) There is more of Asha than Rahman.. the vocal genius of Asha coupled with the synthesized music gives us another ever-green creation... 5. Cyclist's Rhythm (Instrumental percussion: Shivamani) How do u feel when u hear the sound of 10 distinct bicycle bells going off at the same time... noisy nuisance...?? For Rahman and Shivamani even that rings musical tunes... this is the height of musical creativity... 6. Rang Hai (Singer: Alka Yagnik, Dallinda) A Rajasthani folklore... the most unusual part of the track is the very beginning, opening with a mysterious voice of the Lebanese singer Dallinda.. It is said, Tabu danced with 4 stitches in her leg to this song and on asking how she managed.. she repied "It is the music of the film. It just did something to me. It's almost divine." 7. Potter's Village (Instrumental percussion: Hossam Ramzy) This one carries an Arabic feel to it, most probably because of the extensive use of the guitar throughout the piece. 8. Noor-Un-Ala (Singer: Murtaza Khan, Quadir Khan) A Qawwali composed by MF Husain himself... Rahman continuously provides us with the quick-paced beat of the tabla and the flowing melody of the harmonium, characteristic of most qawwalis.. another catchy composition...

 Kicha, you were spot on when you spoke of certain aspects related to the economic factors. It is true that a political rethink is necessary. The feel good factor has generated such a lot of discussion even before the elections are underway. The growth of a country is to be applauded but the politicisation of the growth is an area that has to be avoided. One party says it is instrumental for the country to achieve great heights. But did the party do it on its own. No, it just ramped up the prevailing growth. For that cause it is to be congratulated. The other party says that the government is a failure and that they would have brought greater laurels to the country. I feel that the development of a nation should not be handed over to a bunch of political parties who change idealogies and partners faster than a formula 1 driver changes gears. Instead, the plans foir the nation's growth have to be decided upon and the government must be able to execute that plan, regardless of thier party manifesto. Such a growth is a true growth of a nation. So what do you think? Should the plans for the growth of the nation (say our five year plans) be constant with each government working towards achieving it or should each government bring out thier own five year plans? P.S. This was to be posted yesterday morning. Due to some problems with Blogger. It is being posted aday late. Manny, congrats. I'll call you tonight without fail.

 Hi all, Hope everyone is doing fine. One good news for u all. I have joined one of the Inc 500 Hall of fame companies...A CMM Level 5 company too... Yes I am now a part of US based HTC Global Services Inc. in its Global Development Centre, here in MEPZ, Chennai. Joined today as a Technical Communicator... There is a long and interesting story in my past one month's life. Yes! It was a situation when my company (Vannet Techloggix) went bankrupt and one fine morning I (not only for me but to all my colleagues too) got a notice from my company that the operations are going to be closed by Feb 15th... I was left stranded and till feb 13th I did not have any other options at hand. But on 15th morning.... I submitted my papers and got the relieving order and in the same evening I got the offer letter from HTC. Yep!!!!! I did not believe it at the first place, but its true...ha ha...somewhere I should have done some good at some time in my life...and finally everything was sorted out and I joined HTC after all joining formalities have been completed... I am now in my induction program and will be kicked off with the project in another couple of days. Thats it. And one more news. Hope some of you might be knowing that Sandil is here in chennai. Now he is working as the Distribution Manager at Grandix Pharmaceuticals and has rented a house near CMBT. We are used to meet once in two days atleast and we enjoy riding the roads of chennai... And I am also expecting one more good news, which I know but waiting for that person to tell u all and take that pleasure himself...everything well and good. And yes...This is why I was not able to participate in the blog for the past couple of weeks as I was preoccupied with hell a lot of things... Ok then, bye bye and take care friends. Mahendran Jayavel. Note: Jax can you give a call to me at this number: 044-55384745. Its urgent and make the call without fail tomorrow after 9'o clock in the night tomorrow. I have a message for u. Dont fail to call me da. ok.

 It is not very surprising that we don't have many to speak of in that Forbes list... its just that with the kind of economy that India is, its really hard to produce more such people compared to the likes of European countries and some others... The EU believes in growing up together.. trade barriers are very flexible... travel regulations are tourist-friendly... once u get to some European country, travelling to other European countries is very easy.. remember, sindhuja has already visited Scotland and Wales.. so tourism improves and adds to the economic kitty and now-a-days the EU (except Britain) trades with the same currency too... But in the case of India, the dependency on the developed economies is so large that we seldom get to call the shots... further, the ASEAN exists just for the sake of existing... there is immense unrest between the neighboring ASEAN countries... and most delegate meets are spent languishing over the political instability... While EU has very relaxed and cooperative trade norms... the Asian "giants" China and India are considered to be competitors... in this age, growth is only possible with a cooperative and liberal sharing of selective core competency.. that is the whole raison d'etre of the concept called ECR (Efficient Consumer Response) which is still taking roots.. George Fernandes asked in the '70s, "Why do we need a Unilever to make such measly things as a toothpaste".. Unilever did enter India.. and the rest is history... Georgian socialsm has no place in this era.. the "feel-good factor" in the economy is just a fog veiled over the election atmosphere... India has a long way to go before it could become a force to reckon with... and it would require a revolutionary political re-think..

 It has been a month since I came to Chennai. I expected to roam around urlLink Chennai during the weekends. I was wrong. I had spent only one weekend in Chennai. Every weekend, I find myself spending the weekend out of town. I had been to urlLink Madurai , urlLink Bangalore , urlLink Coimbatore , and coming weekend, Bangalore again and then to Coimbatore next weekend. I wonder when I can get to visit the sights and sounds of Chennai other than commuting to work. Kicha, expecting a treat from you for getting a new mobile and Rini, expecting your birthday treat. My plans for a mobile are posted urlLink here . Leave your suggestions/comments for my mobile there.

 Ram linked about it. So i got myself a Gmail account. Somehow Gmail seems to be associated with a lot of controversies recently, mostly privacy issues. Anyway, I am trying it out to see how it works. So kindly cc your mails to xavierroyatGMAILDOTCOM. I am at Coimbatore for the weekend. I'll be starting to Chennai tonight. More on monday.

 I know its been a long time since i blogged something... but yenna panrathu periya alunganna apadithan...adjust madi pls! About a month back, on a friday evening we went to A R Rehman's concert at Symphony hall in Birmingham...it's one of the best halls in UK...it was jam packed with 70:30 ratio of Indians to English...he's quite popular in UK as his english stage play 'Bombay Dreams' was very successful which won him acclaims among British...and his next project 'Lord of the Rings' stage play to add to his credit...it was no 'singing dancing' show..but very professional with orchestra comprising of local english people belonging to Symphony hall group. I wouldn't call the show a great one...according to Rehman it was first of its kind from him...so for a start it was good and made it one of my memorable evenings! hey kishore...ticket varathu kulla sollitiya...but as he said, on may 3rd hopefully nan india manna thodauven....Right now im in a shopping spree...dont know if i'll be able to stuff all the things under the permissible weight limit. Coming weekend we are going to London...to pay a last visit before we leave! already Ram has promised me a red carpet welcome ;-) Ranjini sonna mathiri virundu pottudu yenakku... Looking forward to seeing you guys in India... Cheerio Sindu

 Hi all, felt bad that I could not join the get together. Had to be in Chennai for our Branch Training Program for 3 days.It was enjoyable on all the 3 days. Managers & supervisors from all over kerala, karnataka, andhra & tamil nadu were present. After all the training program during the day the evenings & night were the most enjoyable. The first evening saw us celebrate with a model named Malaika and a AJ named Ashok. It was full of "Kuthu" dance if thamizh songs were played. With drinks also available in the hall u should imagine the fun. Right from the branch manager, regional manager & district manager danced with us. The second evening had swimming pool games followed by casino with drinks and dance(ellam dapankuthu thaan). Also met many of my UG friends after a long time. Had a busy week after the program. On satirday went for "Ghilli" movie. Vijay babu wanted me to tell about the movie in the blog. So here are my views. RIGHT from the start to finish it is so fast & enjoyable. Director Tharani like his previous movies follows a single line story but makes it so much enjoyable with his screenplay. The story is Vijay protects Trisha from her uncle Prakash Raj who wants to marry her any cost. How he does it is shown with lots of twists & turns. Songs are for the masses.The whole theatre dances for all the tunes..As usual Trisha is Ravishing(hihihi) and Vijay has acted in style. The chasing scenes have been taken in style. It will be a good entertainer for all. Bye

 Poet-seers who have achieved the highest realisations and have endeavoured to share that experience with the rest of humankind.The teachings and very utterances that spiritual masters of this calibre offer to the world come from the most sublime realms of consciousness that human beings can attain to. Their poetry transcends the page to become mantra, an invocation to the transcendental consciousness. Do you think we know any poet seers? or have any of us come across the works of poet seers? Discuss please!

 A couple of days ago, I had the opportunity to visit the urlLink Namma MTR foodchain. My cousin, his roomate, his roommate&#8217;s friend and me decided to go to a movie, urlLink Ghillie that afternoon. Since the show was scheduled to start only at 16:30, we had the afternoon to while away. We decided to visit Commercial Street. On an impulse, we chose to visit Namma MTR instead of urlLink Caf&eacute; Coffee Day . We were in for a surprise. This summer, Namma MTR has launched an unlimited urlLink icecream buffet scheme. You pay 50 ruppees and you can eat as much icecream as you want. You can choose from various flavours, additional items like sauces, dry fruits. It was a good bargain to beat the summer heat. So those in Chennai and Bangalore, rush to the nearest Namma MTR outlet and enjoy this offer. Rini, I tried calling your home. But no one picked up. I guess you had gone out to browse as I got your message on my mobile. Kicha, I called your office. You weren't there at your desk. Ram, sorry da, I didn't know your extension number. I tried to call Bala, but I could not reach him. Anyway the next time, I come to bangalore, I'll meet all of you. maybe we ca have a treat at namma MTR.

 It was a grand celebration of the billion dollar day.. All members of the board along with Don Liles, the first customer of infy, NS Raghavan, the first employee of infy with employee number 0001, Steve Pratt the CEO of Infosys Consulting Inc., and many many more dignitaries... The messages of the President, PM and CM of Karnataka were read out... Kumar Sanu and Alka Yagnik made the night colorful with their gracious voices... and to top it all there was a grand dinner...

 It is good to see atleast one get-together taking place. I think the experience was very rich on seeeing the number of dollar signs in Kicha's posts. As for me, this Easter went off well with my relatives, just like Christmas. I guess I've stopped celebrating festivals at home with family. I hope it is not the sign of things to come. I know I haven't been posting much here, unlike urlLink there . One reason is that most of my posts were either links to other sites I had come across during my browsing. But since I don't have that opportunity now, I find it difficult to post anyhting. BTW, there seems to be any discussion at all, both in the blog and the group. Any way here is urlLink http://www.goodtyping.com/" title="Surely you'll benefit through this site.">one link I came across while watching television. Nowadays, it keeps me company during evenings. But due to the stupidity of the government (CAS), I cannot get any movie channels. I have to manage with music channels and news channels. Sri, nice to read your post. It kept me and Manny laughing for quite some time. Any way can you call me on my mobile (09840171578) asap.

 There was soemthing interesting that happened in the past week... As I was racing against time to finish some work.. valli came online.. and then jax and then ram came out of his invisibility and we started a conference... though I didn't take part much because of work.. I followed the talk.. and then sindhuja joined in too.. it was nice talking with all at one go... and then I felt a bit naughty... I asked sindhuja for her number and called her up from office... through VoIP... just the inspiration of making so many calls to UK everyday (my current client is in UK) made me that much naughty... I don't know if I'm allowed to reveal.. but still I do (I continue to be naughty)... Sindhuja is likely to land in India on May 3rd.. and go to Madurai etc., for a month before returning back to Bangalore... sindhu, would still like to hear this from ur mouth in this blog... And there is going to be a get-together of sorts this weekend... some of the guys will be in blore this weekend for a day's bash.. while some are not able to make it... we'll plan something bigger soon...

 Quiet is a condition in which there is no restlessness or disturbance. Calm is a still unmoved condition which no disturbance can affect—it is a less negative condition than quiet. Peace is a still more positive condition; it carries with it a sense of settled and harmonious rest and deliverance. Silence is a state in which either there is no movement of the mind or else a great stillness which no surface movement can pierce or alter.

 Dear friends please note that this election is not going to do anything with TN.The results are noway going to influence our Honourable chief minister Dr.AMMA. this is parlimentary election and so dont fall inside the trap of thinking locally . If you are satisfied with the nadional democratic alliance and support all the hard steps taken by AIADMK government in ensuring financial stability and uniform growth among all sector of people ,if you want them to continue in power VOTE FOR BJP/AIADMK alliance(which is a natural alliance). if you are not satisfied with the performance of NDA and still believe that DMK and alliances who where with BJP till yesterday and blamming it as an religious party today,a party with a symbol of rising sun and with a policy of rising son and rising grand son ,a party which always beleive that acting against Hindu beliefs is called as secularism, can give better governance along with Mrs.Antoniyo meno of ITALY ,then kindly vote for thier alliance. always note that inspite of all critisism and blames Tamilnadu has almost reached the first position in all sectors as promised by our CM. also note that Majority can not be right always. ready for further discussion Note: Kicha : - can you please copy this mail and put it in blogger for me?

 Long time since i blogged!!!......But,i was always in touch with all the posts...... My trip was fine...Had a great time, with my parents & a few of our friends too.....Most sickening part after a long trip, is the catch-up work!!......My brain was squeezed beyond it's capabilities, for the first few weeks......Now i'm back to stream.... Congrats Manny, Bala & Xavier for your new jobs!!!....(Though late, not too late, right???) Rini, great that Srini, has reached safely.....Is there any plans for him, about flying to the east?....If so, i can invite him to our place, for a weekend.......BTW, I live in the middle east.....there's three hours time difference, between mine & Srini's place......Sanjose is the head quarters for Cypress......it's a very nice place....place ought to be visited in US......You could have made up for this trip Rini....can't you take an absence of leave or something like that? Kavi, Do you ever check your off line messages?.....I've been sending you messages every now 'n then....but no response from you at all...... ok guys, see you later

 Hi ram, regarding ur doubt of East/West coast, i got a mail from vinitha which answers ur queries. here is it! "Regarding your doubths in the blogs whether Valli lives in the East Coast. Well, I live on the East Coast. Valli lives in the east but not on the coast. She follows Eastern timings as well like me. She lives in Kentucky. You can check that out in the map. The four timings followed here are Eastern, Central, Mountain followed by Pacific. Srini will be following Pacific Timings. It's actually split into four areas longitudinally. So, one full long side is East and then followed by the rest. That's about it." hope ur doubts are clear now! And to all of u, Srini reached Sanjose safely and he is merrily spending his time, relaxing, cooking, visiting places and preparing himself to go to office tonight(it will be day for them)! I am also having great time with my inlaws, though they will be moving tonight to Madurai! but never mind, my cousins are with me (en uyirai edukka)! ok bye for now all of u!

 In the blue of the sky, in the green of the forest, Whose is the hand that has painted the glow? When the winds were asleep in the womb of the ether, Who was it roused them and bade them to blow? He is lost in the heart, in the cavern of Nature, He is found in the brain where He builds up the thought: In the pattern and bloom of the flowers He is woven, In the luminous net of the stars He is caught. In the strength of a man, in the beauty of woman, In the laugh of a boy, in the blush of a girl; The hand that sent Jupiter spinning through heaven, Spends all its cunning to fashion a curl.

 A tech cold war comes to an end Calling a truce in one of the business world's loudest and longest-running rivalries, Sun Microsystems on Friday settled its legal feud with Microsoft in exchange for nearly $2 billion in payments and a 10-year cooperation agreement with its former nemesis. The two companies will collaborate over the next 10 years to make each other's products -- notably Sun's servers and Microsoft's dominant Windows PC operating system -- work together well. McNealy said the deal with Microsoft would make Sun's products more valuable because they will now be able to work smoothly with products running Microsoft's software. Read urlLink full-story .

 A legal notice has been issued by GOI to Wipro that it should pay Rs.261 Crore Income Tax for the fiscal year 2003-2004. This Income tax does not cover Wipro's other portfolios like Healthcare, FMCG etc, but covered only Wipro's IT and ITES. Wipro will have only Rs.13 crore as profit, if it agrees to pay Rs.261 Crore to GOI(Profit in III Qtr of Wipro Rs.274 Crore). According to STPI laws and amendments, Software companies which are registered under STPI are exempted from I.T. for the earnings and profits which comes under software exports. It doesn't make any sense for a company like Wipro to come under Section 10A of Income Act, 1997. What I feel is such amendments of I.T will affect the morale of a company like Wipro. Any arguements and criticisms for the above point are most welcome.

 Yeah, it was a kind of obligatory post I had to make because I liked urlLink this approach . Just in case you didn't know, many people I know read my blog. It keeps them in touch with me. I could've easily posted everything here and asked them to view it here but somehow I felt it wasn't the best solution. So when I have an alternative, why don't I redirect them there? As for my participation in this blog, don't feel that I am abadonning this blog for that. Each one serves its purpose and neither shall one replace the others. Obligation is not to taken as 'something you do because you are indebted to it'. And I also feel that obligation is a first step towards internalisation. So unless and until I start fulfilling my obligations, do they become closer to me and as a result, internalisation occurs. That's all from me for now.

 Its been a while since I posted something substantial.. not that I don't have time.. but that I don't know what to post.. I do get my so-called "breaking news"... but a series of that would be just posting something for the heck of it... jax, even though u told some days back in reply to my "post-jax era" post etc., that u would always be around.. its kind of going to be hard for u now.. understandable.. but as rini pointed out, it would have been more heartening for all of us if u had kept a fraction of that gusto to this blog too... all we got was something that u yourself acknowledge as an "obligatory" post... that was the saddest part of it all... I was just fearing this... posting in this blog need not be an obligation.. but it must be an internalised exertion.. obligation is the last thing anyone would want... Anyways... rini.. keep pondering about the question.. I too will... some riddles (if I may call my question one) are difficult to be solved... but riddles need not be solved to be enjoyed..!!

 Since our company's performance was good last year, we have been given an incentive. Quiet a good amount! Ofcourse, i was worried a bit of how to save money to buy gift for srini's birthday. That problem is solved now. good na! Yes, Srini left to SanJose yesterday without any hassles! (all becoz of my proper preparation plan) summa sollikka vaendiyathu thaan! Hope i dint have any leak holes in them..... Waiting for his call from there. Jax, this is very unfair, to leave this days work job like this and keep updating only QSS. come on, we all need u, in this blog too. this is highly unfair ya! About ram's question, Vinitha only told me that both of them live in East coast and he is going for his ERP project only! About kicha's question, Astrology is more on beliefs and to answer questions on, first we need to believe of which i can hardly help u out in describing what it is! so sorry i think, i may not help u in answering it, probably lets ask my senior to help u out with this regards. Really a complex question for an not fully formed individual like me! ok guys will blog u all later!



 This is just an obligatory post to make known that I keep in touch with the blog. More details about my job, read urlLink QSS

 Language and its achievements (literature) are nothing to the mind worked up by the modern trend of moneymaking and position-seeking. Such a condition makes our mind so poor in understanding, inferring, and stating, that we are beings now without the force of real thought and feeling directing us. Usually our present state is that we are in an emotional mess. Emotions and sentiments of a cheap sort are our prop. Noisy verbal expression of musty ideals and appealing exhortations is the limit of our mental power. If we imagine that we are right, and that those whom we admire are 'really' great, we are well contented. If you look carefully at our writing, you will not fail to see that we scarcely realize that we have a mind whose function is to think. It has not been possible for us, since the inception of modern education to master a text and comment intelligently on it. This condition leads us to dependence upon Western resource, of intelligent application of mind. It means subordination, as long as we do not acquire any ability to keep ourselves independent. Suppose we attempt now to do some writing independently without this ability, we produce hogwash only. It has this effect, namely, that we see clearly the superiority of the Western mind, but there is no stimulus to improve our mind just because mental improvement does not strike us as worthwhile beside planning and acting for bourgeois success . Let us be quite clear that there cannot be mental improvement without concentration on language and its classics&quot;

 Good going! Wish you a bright future in career. Any hike? can drop in to bangalore to give us a treat along with jax! when do we plan guys.....

 It is the happiest moment to share. Starting my career as a Biz Development Executive - Trainee in ANGLER, I have been promoted as Biz Development Executive in the month of December 2003. Today, is the day that I would like to celebrate, I have been again Promoted as Senior-Executive Business Development , a milestone in my career path. I wish to cherish this day with U all. I thank all of you for your wishes and prayers for my success in all the endeavors, which I am involved in.

 Imagine you have applied for a job. You are awaiting the results of that interview. One day you get a letter saying that your application has been rejected. What do you you do now? Sit and sulk or take it positively and move on? Both of the above approaches result in you not getting the job. Try this approach , you will be amazed at the result. You can use the same approach to any other situation in your life, but I cannot say the result will be successful every time.

 These Blogger profiles are quite interesting. It gives a lot of information that is quite interesting to read. Details like no. of posts posted, no. of words posted give an interesting statistic. When you fill up the profile, you can search for bloggers who have the same interests. For example, I had quoted Alaipayuthey as one of my favorite films. When someone views my profile, they can click on "alaipayuthey" to see who else have listed the film as their favorite films. Similarly you can click on locations, say you want to know how many bloggers are from Tamil Nadu or perhaps Chennai. So why don't everyone update their profiles. It is going to take only a few minutes.

 I think it would really be useful if you can give a gist of the article whenever you post some links. Maybe a kind of teaser preview. Just keeping in mind the principle of AIDAS. Anyone remembering what that means. Just plain links alone is not useful to anyone. I&nbsp;recieve any new posts through email. And all I can see is just a couple of links.&nbsp;It is not usable. I guess everyone knows enough HTML to add a 'title' attribute to any hyperlink you post. If you can give a small note on the link, it is fine. But if you feel that it might spoil the surprise, atleast give a hyperlink title to the hyperlink so that people can know what they are clicking. That is if it is not too much trouble for you.

 My first thoughts on reading the article were : "What was Francois Gautier trying to convey?" Is he ranting about the obsession with white skin? Or is he commenting upon the political scenario? I cannot comphrehend. He started off with politics, somewhere in the ensuing paragraphs, he moved on to the image of india in the western world and then later on to bollywood and then accusations and then ends again with politics. I don't know whether what sort of image he wants to project in the minds of the indian readers, an Indophile or an Anglophobe? I doubt if a majority of the educated people in India have ever heard of the aryan invasion theory, nor is it taught in schools as history. It has always been a bone of contention among historians, not the common man. I feel that this article is mainly targeted in arousing confusion in the reader. I wonder how the editor of the newspaper let this nonsensical article get past his desk. BTW, since when did Ouest-France overtake Le Monde as the largest circulated French daily. BTW, why don't we reply in the comments section, instead of posting it individually.

 "The fact that an opinion has been widely held, is no evidence that it is not utterly absurd; indeed in view of the silliness of the majority of mankind, a widespread belief is more likely to be foolish than sensible." Right! In the outset let us see Who said this? Again a white skinned man called "Bertrand Russell"... Why this quote when there are too many satires quoted by intellectual Indians? why this obsession? Do you need a white man's quote to authenticate your stand point? and this is what Francois Gautier has qutoed in his write up as ... "Obviously, colonisation has frozen the Indian mind in certain patterns and the British made sure, through Macaulay's policies, of leaving behind an enduring inferiority complex among Indians, by constantly harping on the flaws of Indian culture and inflating them. That is why today Indian intellectuals repeat like parrots what their masters had said before them..." In retrospect, this is infact the mind set that has been sowed deep inside the indian minds...And I won't agree that Francois is a racist...had u read the writings of Francois, you might not be in a position to brand him as a racist and as a constant follower of his writings I wont agree upon the facts put forth by kishore that he's a racist. I dont want to further quote some quotes as if quoting some IPC sections here now as it makes this discussion more like a court script...Instead the objective of francois was to discover the unknown inferiority of the majority of the indian minds (if not the whole of indian minds)...right! :: Mahendran

 It has been a week since I joined. I wouldn't say that the past one week has been somewhere in the middle of interesting and boring. Since I have found a way to keep in touch with the blog (via email), you can expect me to be posting more than often As for the recent discussions , I would like to read the original article. (Manny, why don't you post the link to the article. That would lead to any copyright issues, I hope.)

 Manirathnam disappoints... no story-line... no punch in characters... no choreography... no nothing... These were some of the comments I read before watching the movie on sunday... Ayitha Ezhuthu is another Manirathnam classic... But for those who expect to see another love, another duet, another dance with a scenic beckground, another fight, another suspense and another happy ending.. this is not the kind of movie to bet ur money on... Manirathnam spends ample time with the flashbacks, which is the only way he can stress on the ingenuity of the characters he wants to portay... The screenplay is awesome.. There is not much choreography.. but given the positioning of the songs in the film it is not logical to spoil the flow by inserting unnecessary choreography... You cannot expect creativity in "yakkai thiri" nor can you expect special effects in "Jana gana mana"... the songs must be seen in the context of the film and a scenic choreography would have made no sense... No wonder that all songs put together comprise not even 30 minutes... The way the characters are handled is very unique only to the Mani style of films.. from the unpredictability of Inba (Madhavan) to the endearing expressiveness of Esha Deol the actors fit their roles very aptly... The most impressive part of the film to me was the screenplay... though a shade in the style of alaipayuthey, Mani weaves his magic once more and does not disappoint... The songs are already a hit so there's no repeating that... Rahman shows he is still in form... Watch the movie if u want to see something beyond the ordinary.. For the rest of the lot this isn't your piece of cake.. so just wait until the next movie with a lot of "masala" stuff comes your way...

 Thalai Ezuthu!

 I'm referring to that article "The white woman and India". Its a pity that people are influenced by the senseless scribblings of a "White French man".. if I may call you that way sir.. his racist mentality is evident from the way the "colour of the skin" becomes the only theme in the article. More than politics or history his words are an offence over the skin of people. I don't understand why the feeling that the image of India is "harmed" by images of our poor. USA has a significant population of "native americans" (or the so called "red indians"), who have been overthrown by the "white skinned" European settlers for their own selfish motives... The native Americans live in valleys and ridges and many unaware that there is another world and that there's something called technology... Are we Indians more selfish than such a ruthless American lot..?? Indians respect Mother Teresa not because she's white-skinned, not because there's no one else "brown-skinned" in India to take care of poor but because we respect every human and honour his/her good deeds irrespective of his/her skin color... White people spend hours on the beach and put on a hundred creams to get tanned. And in winter they even artificially lie under infrared lamps in beauty parlors to get brown! Why this obsession for the Indian woman to have white skin? I ask the same question to Mr.Gautier, why do your people want to become brown like us Indians... Isn't white beautiful enough for you..??? Why this obsession to become brown..??? You are that sect of perennially irrational ideologists for whom grass is always greener on your side... Junk can never be junker than this...!! --------- The fact that an opinion has been widely held, is no evidence that it is not utterly absurd; indeed in view of the silliness of the majority of mankind, a widespread belief is more likely to be foolish than sensible. - Bertrand Russell, Marriage and Morals (1929) ch. 5

 hi friends, for the first time in mumbai i went to see a tamil movie in theatre. it turned out to be a great occasion. the movie was perazhagan and i got a chance to see three suriya and three jothika. yes, i saw 2 suriya & 2 jothika in that movie and remaining 1 jothika and 1 suriya in person...... they came to see how the movie was going in mumbai. totally around 10 people only knew that they r in the admin room of the theatre. so we went there and meet them, i was just standing nearer to jothika.... wah what a beauty...... machan ganja, nee miss pannittada.. that time only i understood y u r telling her as ur thalaivi.....hmmmmmmmm.... we had only few words with them, a4 that they left from there. in that movie comedy was really good, vivek + suriya turned out to be very good combination. atleast for the comedy and suriya/jothika, film lovers can see this movie once. - vijay

 Hope all of you are busy in your respective schedules. After Jax left ANGLER, there seems to be not much response in this blog. Only a few members have the enthusiasm to participate in this blog. Moreover, this is a ideal time to work(idle time of work). Pats to Kavitha, for such an wonderful article on lead management. We already have a software called ANGLER CRM, a part of the software already focuses on lead management. Today, I had my ISO internal audit, out of the 15 parameters I got 5 Non-Compliances(NC's) in which 3 goes to my team. I have to prepare my corrective action report within a day or two. I am crewing up with my team to discuss the ways for eliminating the NC's. Nothing much to discuss, Tomorrow I will be in Erode and tomorrow night, I will be watching Mani Ratnam's Aaiyatha Ezuthu. I have been told that the hindi version of the movie Yuva is not much to expectation. More Comments will follow through after seeing Aaiyatha Ezuthu....

 Just have a look at this article about Lead Management. http://www4.gartner.com/DisplayDocument?doc_cd=110551

 Sachin Tendulkar took 79 matches to score his first ODI hundred... by the next 79 he had got a dozen of them.. Zaheer Khan had not taken 5 wickets in an innings for a long time.. Srinath quoted once "Let him take his first five wicket haul, and u'll see him take many more soon after that"... Zaheer took his first five wicket haul against New Zealand in 2002... and ended up as 3 successive hauls in that series... I had not spent night-outs at office in all of my 18-month career.. Then it happened at last on May 6th... 5 days later, today.. am here again sitting at office late at night... and probably many more to come...!!

 There might be few changes in the template as and when I get some time to fiddle with it. As before, I would like your help in doing so. Since now, there is an option for comments, I would like everyone to use it as much as possible. Also I would like everyone to update and share thier profiles. I have updated mine. There were some interesting statistics on my blogging. Check out my urlLink profile . As a first case, i would like you to leave comments on what items do you want to have in blog like search, frequently visited sites and so on. leave your comments...

 The blog layout is very good.. hope jax gets net access in Wipro and the blog comes back to life...!!

 Ram told me that Blogger has been updated. Thought I would have a dekko at it. It was true. Now the interface looks beautiful. Traipsing through the site, I found a lot of changes. A huge set of templates were given. I chose one to test it out. A new set of tags have also been added. Rini might know about the importance of those tags. Well, once you have read this, log into urlLink Blogger and check it out for yourself.

 In 1883, a creative engineer named John Roebling was inspired by an idea to build a spectacular bridge connecting New York with the Long Island. However bridge building experts throughout the world thought that this was an impossible feat and told Roebling to forget the idea. It just could not be done. It was not practical. It had never been done before. Roebling could not ignore the vision he had in his mind of this bridge. He thought about it all the time and he knew deep in his heart that it could be done. He just had to share the dream with someone else. After much discussion and persuasion he managed to convince his son Washington, an up and coming engineer, that the bridge in fact could be built. Working together for the first time, the father and son developed concepts of how it could be accomplished and how the obstacles could be overcome. With great excitement and inspiration, and the headiness of a wild challenge before them, they hired their crew and began to build their dream bridge. The project started well, but when it was only a few months underway a tragic accident on the site took the life of John Roebling. Washington was injured and left with a certain amount of brain damage, which resulted in him not being able to walk or talk or even move. "We told them so." "Crazy men and their crazy dreams." "It`s foolish to chase wild visions." Everyone had a negative comment to make and felt that the project should be scrapped since the Roeblings were the only ones who knew how the bridge could be built. In spite of his handicap Washington was never discouraged and still had a burning desire to complete the bridge and his mind was still as sharp as ever. He tried to inspire and pass on his enthusiasm to some of his friends, but they were too daunted by the task. As he lay on his bed in his hospital room, with the sunlight streaming through the windows, a gentle breeze blew the flimsy white curtains apart and he was able to see the sky and the tops of the trees outside for just a moment. It seemed that there was a message for him not to give up. Suddenly an idea hit him. All he could do was move one finger and he decided to make the best use of it. By moving this, he slowly developed a code of communication with his wife. He touched his wife's arm with that finger, indicating to her that he wanted her to call the engineers again. Then he used the same method of tapping her arm to tell the engineers what to do. It seemed foolish but the project was under way again. For 13 years Washington tapped out his instructions with his finger on his wife's arm, until the bridge was finally completed. Today the spectacular Brooklyn Bridge stands in all its glory as a tribute to the triumph of one man's indomitable spirit and his determination not to be defeated by circumstances. It is also a tribute to the engineers and their team work, and to their faith in a man who was considered mad by half the world. It stands too as a tangible monument to the love and devotion of his wife who for 13 long years patiently decoded the messages of her husband and told the engineers what to do. Perhaps this is one of the best examples of a never-say-die attitude that overcomes a terrible physical handicap and achieves an impossible goal. Often when we face obstacles in our day-to-day life, our hurdles seem very small in comparison to what many others have to face. The Brooklyn Bridge shows us that dreams that seem impossible can be realized with determination and persistence, no matter what the odds are. Even the most distant dream can be realized with determination and persistence. Be the Change YOU Want to Bring About

 Ever thought of spending a good part of the night at office...?? its been long time I posted something... and I finally felt like posting... a simple way to celebrate my presence in office at 2300 hrs... its kind of different to work with that tinge of sleep lingering on the corner of the eyelid... and u keep trying hard to pull up ur eyelashes to keep the eye open for just a little while longer... when u feel like a pillow would be more than a luxury to let u have a good night's sleep... and amid all this u keep doing that little piece of thing called "work"...

 The QSS blog got spammed yesterday. Some bloody @&*&%# spammer had posted comments yesterday. It took me quite a lot of time in deleting them and closing all the open posts. So I have decided to close all comments after a week. I still don't know if I had deleted all the spam comments. But to a hectic schedule, I missed out watching the Euro 2004 Cup matches in tha last week. But thanks to urlLink BBC , I was able to watch the goals scored.

 We have seen Spiderman swinging from American monuments several times. Now we can get to see him on Indian monuments soon. We wont't be seeing him in a complete body hugging suit. Instead our friendly Indian neighbourhood spiderman will be wearing an Indian traditional kurta with a mask ofcourse. No, I am not talking about a Bollywood version of the Spiderman blockbuster series. I am talking about Spider-Man India, the comics. Marvel COmics is bringing out a Indian version of Spiderman. "Spider-Man India interweaves the local customs, culture and mystery of modern India, with an eye to making Spider-Man’s mythology more relevant to this particular audience."

 urlLink FireFox 0.9 has been released yesterday. Due to heavy traffic, the Mozilla FireFox site is swamped. I found it very difficult to connect to the website. The latest version is smaller than the previous versions (around 4.8MB). Anyway any one of you wants it, I can mail it to you (i.e if your mail server can handle 5 MB attachments).

 We were topped a Rupee a day for that additional service... Nothing comes for free.... Somebody is incurring the cost for the benefit that other guy is receiving!!! Even if it comes to ration / free elec or anything... it will cost the tax payers / national fund etc... Coming to Anonymous rubbish SMS, those who ought to send will do at any COST... More lessons have to be learned.

 Airtel raised the local sms rates to 30ps for Aitel-Airtel... which was free until then.. and national sms to Rs.2 from 30ps... If the latter was accepted with a squeaky frown by the users (including yours truly), the former was a shocker... How the hell can they charge for something which was free until now.. After all, in Chennai/TN people enjoy free national sms.. We could find a couple of unpleasant things about the mobile services that I hope would change sooner than later.. but when it comes to charging I feel Airtel (and other service providers in Karnataka) has set the right example which ought to be tagged on by others as well... My queston is.. Why do u want something for free..?? Businesses are not here to give something out for nothing... Talking of a capitalistic economy which forms the order of the world, its as simple as 'if u use something, pay for it'.. Freebies make people take things for granted... atleast.. in the case of sms its very true... There are umpteen girls who get some rubbish sms to their mobiles from anonymous numbers... Just because sms is free some unscrupulous idiots resort to such insane mischiefs.. Lets see how much of this comes when sms is charged at Rs.2. Besides this, with such freebies the means outlives the purpose... phone/mobile/sms/mms are primarily a means of communication and not for teen hijacking... there are many articles in papers where parents of teens worry about their child's addiction to sending messages which cost absolutely nothing to the parents in terms of money but costs a lot to their peace of mind... and not to mention unnecessary distraction for the teens for whom the "interesting" anonymous guy at the other end always adds lots of "glamour" to their living... The moment u add a price tag.. its intersting how things change rapidly... teens need to go back to parents if they want to dole out some currency for their mobile.. thereby giving parents an idea of their usage and hence a constant check... the mischievous jacks are sure to find spending 2 rupees for every mischief they do become harder by the day.. after all, if this is their only occupation then they are likely to run out of money soon... and for the other "professional" users this would make their hair sit up and use the means within the boundary of its purpose... In the age when we talk of removing all subsidies and a no free electricity for farmers syndrome et. al., why should the salaried class be spared with freebies..??? A lesson learnt..!!

 Friends and supporters of Tejas Parmar, a programmer with SysMind, say he's in urgent need of rehabilitation after sustaining fractures in his neck region and paralysis of the lower body. ....the situation, she said, points to an extreme double standard in America's health care system.

 Narayana Murthy on BBC... We believe that if India has to solve its problem of poverty, we have to embrace capitalism, ensure that jobs are created, and make sure that market-driven policies are accepted," he said. "However, to do that, the people who are the evangelists of capitalism, must conduct themselves in a manner that will appeal to the masses. "People must be able to relate to them easily. They must lead a normal life, a simple life, and people must be able to say, 'look, if these jokers can do it, we can do it better'." Read urlLink full-story

 John Grisham's The Last Juror kept me company during the journey back home last night. Heavy rains and traffic kept me seated for almost three hours.

 Heavy rains brought traffic to a standstill last night. I had been enjoying my nap in the bus while my mobile rang. It was someone from Citibank. The executive wanted to know if I wanted a credit card. I noticed I had a new message waiting for me in the inbox. It went like this: "Hi Xavier, r u stil n office? Sorry it took me so long 2 contact u. no excuses! Forgive this poor girl". I was surprised to see the name at the end of the message. It was Sinduja. I called her back. We decided to meet. There was a blackout at Koramangala. It took me some time to find her place. She is enjoying life at Wipro's guest quarters. Three people at her beck and call. Hmmm. I should have utilized the services when I had the chance. I spent a couple of hours chatting with her and catching up on the latest news on everyone. Today, she is attending an interview in some software company. She promised to give us a treat once she moves into a new house(she is shifting this weekend in Koramangala).

 I think it is up. Some people say that an index page is visible. But I still get a Server error. Funny, I am unable to view my website. :-)

 The day of the first budget of the new congress Govt... And there are hopes afloat.. on what Mr.PC would unveil to the billon people of the country... surprisingly, he would also be more worried about pleasing a few tens of people rather than this billion.. the few tens I'm referring to are the noble-hearted, people-minded, kind, generous, compassionate lot called the communists... How far would it be a dream budget in the lines of what Mr.PC presented in 1997.. his only other budget... that won him laurels across the salaried and waged class alike... VDIS was touted to be one of the revolutions he envisaged.. so much as the concept of competition postcards.. This time however, Mr.PC is facing a brand new India... economies are at an unseen height... Forex is plumpy at $119bn.. all he needs to do is to continue the good work that has been happening in the country... Hope Mr.PC springs up another one just like the good ol' fella that he is...
