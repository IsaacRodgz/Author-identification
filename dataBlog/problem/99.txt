 Um. Gosh, okay, how do I start this? Things have happened. Strange and spontaneous and wonderful things have happened. Yesterday I sat here writing that I had no one to go out with. I debated going out by myself and as the day wore on I realized that it is so not in my style to do such a thing. As I said, I need my friends around to give me the confidence that I wouldnt have if I were on my own. So, knowing this, I decided to email my friend Joanna to see what was going on with her. About two weeks ago, Joanna and I went to a party that was incredibly fun. We met some new people and flaunted ourselves around the scene. In fact, I am pretty sure we owned the party since we had people coming up to us left and right. We met these two gay guys there and to be honest, I dont even remember what their names were. However, after the party, they told their friend, Ahmad, about me. Supposedly they went on and on about how great and cool I was and that I would be perfect for him. A compatible match. A week or so after the party, Joanna mentioned to me that this Ahmad was interested in meeting me. At the time, I kinda let it drop and didnt give it much thought. So yesterday, when I didnt have any plans, I decided to ask Joanna about him. With very little effort on my part, an email exchange began between Ahmad and myself. I found him to be charming and polite and I even detected a sense of humor, which is always a plus. After a few emails to each other, Ahmad and I decided to meet up for dinner. After work, I rushed home, showered, had two glasses of wine and prepared for the first blind date I have ever had. My friends told me that he was dark colored and that he was very successful in his line of work. I have to admit I was pretty nervous about the whole dark thing as I have never actually dated a black or Latino guy before. I decided I was up for anything as long as he turned out to be fun. I showed up at the corner of 44th and Lexington around 7:30pm. I waited for about 5 minutes and suddenly, out of nowhere, Ahmad showed up. I was shocked! I meanSHOCKED. He looked so handsome and dashing. He was wearing a very expensive looking pin stripe suit and he was carrying a briefcase. We exchanged quick hellos and then went to a very nice French restaurant. At dinner I was able to scope him out a bit better. He has the most beautiful brown eyes and his skin is flawless. Not a blemish anywhere. Not like my pizza face. Sike. No one I know has pizza face. I feel bad for pizza faces. pizza face pizza face. Ahmad is 27 years old and is about 510. He says he weighs 175#, but I get the impression that he weighs a bit more than that. He has big and strong arms and his shoulders are solid slabs of beef. And we know that I like the beef. He has a great chest he totally outclassed me with his suit and overall exterior. I was incredibly nervous as we sat down to dinner. I found myself stumbling on my words. Sitting in front of me was a complete man and I have never felt so balanced by someone in my life. He took incredible care of me. He was polite and a gentleman and treated me like gold. Without being overbearing, Ahmad gave me quite a few sweet and kind compliments. During dinner, which I ate none of, Ahmad and I talked about numerous things, ranging from religion (hes Muslim, which I found incredibly intriguing) to jobs to family to our passions in life. I opened up immediately to him and found myself detailing the struggles that I go through on a daily basis. He listened to each and every word I said with interest. He opened up to me as well; talking about the loss of his grandfather, the fact that his family doesnt know that he is gay, and about the fact that he has never truly been in love. As dinner progressed, I found myself wanting to be in his arms, laying there, being held and protected. After dinner, Ahmad and I went back to my apartment to smoke a bowl. (yes he smokes pot, folks! Hes a keeper!) We blasted Monster Ballads (a collection of the best hair band songs from the early 90s) and sang along to it together. At the end of To Be With You by Mr. Big, Ahmad asked if he could kiss me. I said, please do and he stood up, put his hands on my waist, I wrapped my arms around his neck and he gave me the softest and most tender kiss I think I have ever received. I get kind of shy in those situations, so I pulled away before it was necessary. I enjoyed the kiss, but I couldnt stop thinking that I was cheating on my boyfriend. The reason I thought this was because I loved everything that was happening. I loved it too much. Ahmad invited me to go back to his apartment in Queens. He lives by himself and despite the fact that he still hasnt unpacked all of the boxes from his move, he wanted me there to talk to, to hold, to spend the night with. I packed my overnight bag and we took a cab to his place. Once in his apartment, I was blown away by the numerous pieces of art he had displayed on both the walls and his countertops. He is definitely an aficionado of fine things. The kid has worked hard to be where he is and I was proud that he wanted to share some of it with me. We smoked another bowl and watched a bit of an old James Bond movie. We discussed his future goals as well as mine and we kissed on and off throughout the rest of the evening. At 2:30am, we both decided that it was time to go to bed. I slept in his college gym shirt and a pair of my boxers. He slept in just boxers. He does not have a 6-pak and thank goodness, cuz I dont have one either and thats always an awkward moment. If one guy has it, the other guy always feel like an ass. I guess its a gay thing. But looking at him half-naked, I began to sport the biggest hard on ever. While not huge, he is solid and strong and totally man. He asked if I wanted a massage and of course I said yes. His hands were like iron. Seriously this guy has the strength of a thousand men in those hands. I melted completely. I didnt have to do anything. He paid for dinner, he hailed all of the cabs, he opened doors for me, he made sure I was happy at every moment. And then did I ask him if he wanted a massage? No, I just took mine and loved it. hahaha. But its nice to be treated like gold sometimes. I fell asleep lying on his chest, his arm wrapped around my back. It was kind of a rough sleep, new environment and all. The last time I saw the clock, it was 3:30am. We were up again at 7am. Needless to say, I feel very worn out today. On top of getting no sleep, I was completely swept off my feet by a man. A MUSLIM man. Who wouldve ever thought? When I got out of bed this morning, I found that he had gotten up a little earlier and ironed my clothes along with his suit. I mean, is this guy for real? He irons my clothes?? Goshhe was pretty great. I showered and got ready and we commuted together this morning. As in typical gay style, he kissed me before we left his apartment so as not to get ourselves beat up on the way to work. It was a long and sweet kiss. To be honest, I am getting hard just thinking about it. So thats that! He has emailed me a couple of times this morning and it is pretty apparent that he is smitten. I done good! So we will wait and see. I did tell him about Paul, but I explained it as though Paul and I were pretty much over. Truth is, Paul and I are not over. Not by a long shot. Usually I would tell Paul about me going out and meeting other people. But this time, Im going to hold it in for awhile. It will just upset him and I dont see any reason to upset him unless it turns into something a lot more serious. I was very well behaved last night. I didnt hook up with him at all. He simply kissed me a few times and treated me the way my current boyfriend should be treating me. Im still very much in love with Paul. But I am tired of having my heart broken daily. I am tired of not feeling special and I am tired of being with someone who is more concerned about their job and their friends then they are with me. I want a real man. A real man takes care of his woman. Or in this case, his gay. Ahmad showed me an incredible time last night and I am still reeling from it. I am very lucky to have met someone with such class and dignity; someone who, despite his intimidating financial status, is down to earth and real. Man, what has happened?

 Ok, ok, okI am back. SO SORRY TO HAVE SOME TIME TO MYSELF! Sike, never. I wasnt in work yesterday so I decided to take the day and do things that I like to do. Unfortunately, that didnt involve being at the computer. But alasnow I am back where I belong. Sitting in front of a piece of shit PC, bored out of my mind, and literally counting the minutes until I can bust out of here at 5pm. Damn my life. And damn my vagina. I hate being a hermie. Hermie = hermaphrodite. Hermaphrodite = sadness SO! Friday night! Hmmmmmmmm.. After work on Friday, I jetted down to the SOHO area of NYC and met up with Mariah. She took me shopping for some new pants. I thought it best to make myself look as hot as possible, considering that I was going out to meet the man of my dreams. After an hour and a half of trying on different styles and sizes, I finally found the pair of my fantasies. Of course they were more money than I can afford, but at the same time, I needed them. Both for aesthetic reasons, as well as confidence reasons. None of these reasons need to be explained any further. Theyre just reasons. Kelly and I rocked out at my apartment until about 10pm and then we went over to SBNY, otherwise known as Splash Bar, otherwise known as the place of all hotness. Since we got there pretty early, we sat at a table near the bar and talked for awhile. 3 vodka tonics later, and with my groove on, we went upstairs to do some dancing. Unfortunately, the crowd was a mix of the ugliest people I have seen in a very long time. Now, I have no problem with ugly people at all. In fact, I really like ugly people. They usually possess extremely witty senses of humor. (wow that came across so smarmy)(ehappropriately smarmy) Kelly and I danced for about 10 minutes as I checked out the scene. To be frank, the scene consisted of losers and whores and I was really not interested in anyone. Kelly and I debated giving up and leaving. I was a bit crushed as I had my heart set on meeting the man of my dreams. Or at least the man of my evening. No such luck. Before heading out, Kelly and I decided to get one more drink at the bar. We made our way through the crowd, pinching, clawing, and biting when necessary. Finally, we reached our destination and that is when I met HIM. THE man of the night. Thom. WowThom. His beauty was absolutely stunning. He had a very masculine face and a body like I have never seen up close. Im talking cuts, and ridges, and valleys of muscle that I didnt know really existed. He had dark blondish hair, was at least 61 and weighed in at an estimated 210#. My kinda man! So, Kelly starts to talk to the bartender and he eats her up right away. They were talking and laughing and making everything totally comfortable for me. Kelly is really good at hooking me up with the men. Every guy I have dated has gone through Kelly in some way. Thom and I talked for a couple of minutes and he served us our drinks. Kelly and I chilled at the bar and watched Thom run around and do his thing. Eventually he came back over to us and offered us some shots. We took them with him and he kept smiling and winking at me. When we had another moment together, this is the conversation we had: Thom: So, are you from NYC? Me: Yes. I live in Midtown right now. Thom: What do you do for a living? Me: I work for a university and am kind of like a glorified RA. Its a fine job, but I am actually here to be an actor. One of the million. (Thom bursts out laughing and points to a tatoo on his right shoulder. I take a closer look and see that he has the dramatic mask symbols emblazoned on his massive shoulder.) (I smile back at him and continue to bat my eyes and try to look as cool as possible.) Thom: Do you come to this bar a lot? Me: Not nearly enough. This is where most of the hot guys go, so when I am in the mood, I try to sneak on over and catch whats going on. Thom: What do you think of the crowd tonight? Me: Honestly, is there another night I should be coming here? Cuz most of the guys here tonight are busted. I dont see one potential guy in the whole room. Thom: Really?? Well tonight is the night that you would want to come here. You dont see anyone that you like? Anyone at all? Me: Well, from what I can see, the only guy I want to talk to is you. And I know better than to get mixed up with a bartender. Thom: (laughs) Oh yeah? Why is that? Me: (laughing as well) Why do you think? Come on man, no guy should ever spend his time at a bar falling for the bartender. It is a waste of effort. Thom: Its not necessarily a waste tonight. I think you are really cute. Probably one of the cutest guys in the place. So stick around a bit longer. Me: Cool. I will. Kelly and I talk and I explain to her that, although against my better judgement, I am falling quickly for Thom, the bartender. She is excited for me, but also reminds me of the No bartender rule. I agree with her and we decide that we want to leave pretty soon. Thom: Did you guys want another shot? (I glance at Kelly and she seems willing) Me: Sure. What are we having? Thom: Its up to you. Whatever you want. Me: (beginning to panicwhats the cool shot to have??) UmMaybeI dont(wellI suckand I have NO PERSONALITY!) Kelly: Why dont you make us your specialty shot? Thom: Cool. Will do. Me: Kelly, thank you for saving my ass. Eventually Thom returns with our shots. We all clink glasses and down em. Thom and Kelly talk for awhile and he asks her some questions about me. I was definitely peaking his interest. My stomach was tossing and turning with anticipatory excitement. This guy was fucking BEEYOOTIFULL. Eventually they turned their attention back to me. Without going into even more unnecessary detailThom offered to give me his number, but I gave him mine instead. We talked for about another half-hour or so. He put his hand on my face numerous times and leaned in and kissed me twice. It was simple, yet sweet, and my god, the boner I was sporting was fucking huge. My hand barely covered the rock bicep of his upper arm. I wanted him and badly Eventually Kelly and I had to leave. Thom asked if I would be coming back the next night and I told him no. I started to want to marry him and Kelly had to drag me out of the bar. He mentioned to her that he thought I worried too much about everything. I guess I was being a bit overbearing toward the end. Its just that I wanted to set a wedding date before I left that night. I mean, I knew that he was the man of my dreams and I didnt want him to bail on the details of our big event. You know how it goes. Guys never want to help plan the celebration. When we got outside, I begged Kelly to let me go back in and talk to him one more time. She said never and I am so glad she did. Rita always said that I have no game and she is right. When I get drunk and fall in love with a guy, it is almost impossible to pull me away from them. No. Thats an understatement. It IS impossible. I went home with Kelly and we had a good rest of our evening. I couldnt stop talking about Thom. He was so beautiful and funny and sweet and exactly the kind of man, that after one night of knowing, I wanted to be with. Gosh. Saturday, Thom didnt call and I felt fine about it. I mean, he didnt like me as much as I liked him. Or once againnever go for the bartender. On Sunday, Kelly and I went to see X MEN 2 . It was fucking awesome. Then, that night, Kelly went out to a dyke bar with a bunch of friends. Around 11:30pm, the phone rang and I thought it was Paul telling me what time he was coming over. I picked it up and heard a strange voice on the other end. Me: Hello? Strange voice: Is this Joe? Me: Yes it is. Paul? Strange voice: Hahaha. No, its Thom. Do you have a lot of different guys calling you? Me: (FREAKING OUT!) Uh, yeahyou know. You were Friday night, Paul is tonight. Thom: Hahaha. Well, I was wondering if you wanted to go out tonight. Maybe get a drink together? Me: I would love to. Thanks for calling and asking. Unfortunately, I have to work in the morning and I am just about to crash for the evening. (Now I was pissed that Paul was on his way over) Thom: Well thats too bad. Maybe another time then? Me: Definitely another time. Let me know. Thom: Will do. Enjoy your rest. Me: Thanks Thom. Talk to you soon. And that was it! Um! He actually called! Damn! I must be like the hottest ticket in town! I get a bartender to call ME!?!? Sweet. That made me feel fucking excellent. I hope he calls again. Thom is definitely someone I would love to run my tongue down. Did I mention that he is 34? Well, yeah. Hes 34. So he is really only interested in me for sex, but that works fine for me. I will make that decision if it ever comes down to it. But what a high I am on!!! I want so badly to go tonight too, but everyone is working. I am debating going by myself, but thats risky. Paul and Mariah go out by themselves sometimes, but its just not my style. I need to have that friend in the corner that I can turn and run to if things get hairy. But then again, do I want to pass up a night meeting hot guys at Beige? Hmmm.I dont know yet. The weather outside is beautiful and I feel great! I want to enjoy it as much as possible. And Paul, well Paul Paul is great right now. We are getting along well and we are being very open and honest about the demise of our relationship. Not that it is over or anythinghe just needs time to figure things out. He wants me to go out and have some fun and I am not about to sit around and wait for him any longer. If you know someone who is really great, gay, and overly masculine, send them my way. I am so ready to meet and get to know new guys. Its about fucking time.

 FRIDAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY! YEAH! So excited about tonight. I am leaving immediately after work to go buy myself a new pair of pants and a shirt for tonights escapades into the city. Kelly and I have plans to go out to one Lesbian bar and one gay bar. We are both hoping to do it up to the extreme. I want to be WANTED tonight. I want guys all over me. I want drinks bought for me. I want to DANCE and I want to be kissed. Oh MAN I want so many things. I will not go home until all that I set out to accomplish is completed. Who knows? Maybe I will even bring someone home. (gasp!) Paul says that he is going to stay at my apartment tonight to make sure that I dont bring anyone home. Funny, cuz he NEVER has EVER once stayed at my house on a Friday night. Hes just too tired. If he shows up tonight just to bust up my plans, he will be surprised when I make HIM leave and tell my boyfriend of the evening to stay. In all honesty, I probably wont bring anyone home. But I love knowing that I could. Its like I forgot I could for so long. But nownow I feel strong and ready. I have had a great week and I want it to end with a BANG! Bang = cum lovin. sike. sorta sike! Last nights viewing of Urban Cowboy was just about the MOST fun. The boys were beautiful, the dancing was ON POINT, and the experience was totally memorable. The show wasnt my most favorite of all time, but it was good. I am not a big country music fan and you would have to be to really get into the score. I thought the leads were a bit weak, but the chorus was so good that I found myself watching them even when the main characters were on stage. Overall, I feel so lucky to have been there. I had a blast. I wish I could have nights like last night every week. I felt so high profile with my comp tickets. Gosh, it was great. Paul and Mariah had a blast too. And did I mention that the guys were HOT?!?!?! SO HOT. Cowboys are fucking sexy. They pack themselves into denim in a way that I have never seen on a city boy. I saw (and loved) each and every cock package I saw. The bodies on these boyswho hoooooooo! Thank you Kambri Crews. Thank you thank you thank you and oh yeah thank you. Time for the Filthy Friday Five ! Have you ever attempted, even once, to perform oral sex on yourself? Yes of course. I swung my legs up and over my stomach and I tried in vain to stick that cock of mine in my mouth. It was very unsuccessful and I managed to do nothing but give myself horrible muscle cramps in my chest. Its not like I have a small dick or anything. It just wouldnt reach my slurping lips. Ok, sick. Magine I swallowed my OWN cum when I said I wouldnt even swallow my boyfriends? sick again. Tell us about your best sexual experience to date. My best sexual experience was with a guy named Berry. Yeah, his name totally sucks, but his body and his sex appeal was fucking off the hook. He was the quarterback of his high school football team and he did some time in the military. He had red hair (the bad kind), but he was still so HOT! He and I hooked up off and on for a couple of years. (whenever I would visit home (Albany) during college breaks.) One time, I met up with him at our local gay club and he and I immediately fell into each others arms. I didnt want to go back to his place after the club, but I wanted his dick in my mouth more than anything I had ever wanted in my mouth previous. He took me out to his land rover, which was sitting in our local park, and we climbed into the back seat. I sat on his lap while he kissed me and ran his hands all over my body for a very long time. Eventually I couldnt take it anymore. I ripped his shirt off, exposing his amazing pecs and arms. I licked every inch of him and then worked my way down to his huge erection. To date, Berry had the most incredible dick I have ever been lucky enough to suck. Big and strong and virtually hair free. I sucked and sucked and sucked and he begged to suck me. I let him for like 5 minutes, but I really just wanted to finish him. (I had to get back to my friends at the club afterall) Eventually he finished and yes I did swallow that load. He, unlike most of the men I have been with, was deserving. So I drank it down. He held me with one arm around my back and the other exploring the rest of my body. I jerked off for a bit more and blew my load right onto that beautiful chest of his. I then cleaned up and went back to the club. I masturbated to that experience for the next couple of months. Berry was beautiful and if I had the chance to do it again, I would. What physical characteristic turns you on more than anything in bed? More than anything, I love big, strong arms. I love a guy who has biceps on him. I love to feel them, squeeze them, lick them, and have always wanted to put my dick in the elbow crevice of a bicep and forearm. Ever fucked an arm before? Probably not. But I imagine it would be so amazing. MMMMMMMMMM.maybe I can do THAT with someone tonight. Body hair: what's your take on it, both your own or on your partner? I am down the middle on this one. I like smooth or with a light trickle of hair. Too much of it grosses me out. And never back hair. But a nice, ripped up body, with a trickling of black chest hairoof DAH! That is the stuff. Very manly and very sexy. The scent of love: does your partner's own particular "funk" turn you on or off? What do you like to smell in the sack? I LOVE the smell of cologne. If a guy has a nice fresh smelling cologne on (none of that old spice shit) I am immediately smitten. I love to breathe it in deep while we kiss. I love to suck on a nice neck that smells GOOD. I can also get down with the smell of fresh gym workout. Meaningsweat. Manly sweat gets my cock hard in two seconds flat. I guess I have somewhat of an armpit fetish. But it has to be the right guy. I wouldnt stick my face into the pit of someone nasty. That would make my fetish turn into a nightmare. As far as cum or sex smell is concernedit (yet again) depends on the guy. Certain peoples funk is a turn on cuz it smells raw and animalistic. But some funk smells sour and that makes me gag and spew out bile. I guess I will have to let you all know after tonight. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Can you tell that Im excited!? ROCK! I hope everyone has the kind of night that I hope to have. Heres to all of us horny people! I love how the filthy five is always on Friday. Gets me pumped up and ready for a night out in the clubs. Be safe everyone. Lets make this a good one!

 You're a playful lesbian! Life is all fun and games, right? urlLink What Kind of Lesbian Are You? brought to you by urlLink Quizilla Thanks to urlLink The Nord for this one!

 I so need a new format for this site. I want a new template so badly. Everywhere I go, everyone has the same template as me and when I return to my own site, I want to puke all over it. I am so bored with it. It might be time for a change. As with the human body, the body of a journal should evolve as well. Body BODY body. Body. Fucking body. Now I hate the word body. Bodybodybodybodybodybodybodybodybodybody. Not YOU hate the word body. Body. After work yesterday, I ran over to meet up with Miss urlLink Kambri Crews to pick up the tickets for Urban Cowboy . When she came out of the elevator to greet me, my jaw hit the floor. I forgot what an absolute KNOCKOUT she is. My god! Seriously, I gagged on myself in pure intimidation. And why is it that she is so incredibly sweet and wonderful? Total package my friends. Totally total package. The tickets she gave me are in the orchestra! I immediately went home and looked up the seats on the Urban Cowboy website and was shocked to find out where I am sitting. I tugged on my penis in pure joy. When Paul arrived at my pad, I explained that I had a surprise for him. He was like Oh great, cuz every surprise I give him is pretty lame. Sometimes its a candy bar, sometimes its a coupon for free french fries at Burger King, sometimes its a whack in the nuts. So when I pulled out the tickets to the show, he looked at me in pure shock. But how Joe? HOW? How did you get these? Did you buy them for us? No Paul. I got them through my online journal. This really nice girl who works for the show was giving them out and I jumped at the chance. Holy shit thats great! I KNOW! And you hated my journal up until now. No, I still hate it. Oh. Cool. After giving him the surprise tickets, I took us out to dinner at this place called DinerBar in Spanish Harlem. Paul peed in his pants from fear when he saw the neighborhood that the restaurant was in. I told him to walk fast and make no eye contact. Instead, he rips a huge fart in front of a group of ghetto dwellers. They immediately turned in our direction and I just picked up my pace, praying that we wouldnt hear them call out to us. Luckily they didnt. The food at the restaurant was fucking amazing. Paul enjoyed himself thoroughly. We ordered two entrees as appetizers and then we ordered two entrees as entrees. The waitress looks me directly in the eye and says Are you SERIOUS? I look her back in the eye and go Have you ever seen the face of serious? Cuz this is definitely it. I think she got the point. One of our appetizers was their homemade macaroni and cheese with chicken cutlets in it. um!?! YUM! It is just about the best thing I have ever put in my mouth. Or rubbed on my chest for that matter. I could have bathed in it all night long. When we were eating our entre entrees, the chef walked over to us and in a VERY loud voice says: I need to meet the two gentlemen that are eating me out of house and home. I am VERY impressed with you two for eating all of this food. Ive never seen anything like it. Are you going to finish it all? At this point everyone in the restaurant is staring at us. I reply No, actually I am getting pretty full now. Im going to have to take it home, I think. (I glance around at the rest of the customers and kind of half smile)(They stare blankly back at me) The chef responds Then youre a pussy! My jaw hits the floor. A pussy? um..A pussy? I lower my head in pussy shame and Paul responds Im going to finish mine. Dont you worry! I secretly kick Paul under the table while giving him and the staring crowd my most impressed and supportive look. My boyfriends a fat hoss! I am so proud! But at least hes not a pussy. A FUCKING PUSSY? Come on now. As we ate our dinner, we discussed our relationship problems a bit further. He was surprisingly supportive during our talk and was very open to suggestions as to how to improve our current situation. I explained again that I have a strong desire to go out and meet other guys, especially since he wont be physical with me. He told me that while it hurts him to know that I am going to meet other men, its only fair that I be allowed to do what I want to do. He asked me to not hook up with anyone that wasnt a bodybuilder. He understands that I want to be with a man like this at some point in my life and he respects that. He would not, however, respect me hooking up with just any guy off the street. Im down with that. I dont want to hook up with any guy off the street. I want to hook up with BIG. Thaz it. Paul agreed to work on himself a bit more. He agreed to try and take a step back before judging me and my life. He agreed to delve deeper into himself to figure out what the problem is with him and sex. He also agreed to be more available to me and to not be as unnecessarily cruel as he has been over the last few months. He was a sweetheart last night and for the first time in a while I wanted to be with him and only him. The one thing I love about mine and Pauls relationship is that it is based on honesty. There is no fear about holding anything back to spare each others feelings. There is no worry that one person will secretly cheat on the other. We are very vocal about what we want. We may fight a lot, but ultimately, everything gets said and then put to rest. I am very lucky to have him during this whole growing process. Its hard to be 25 years old and in a committed 3 and a half year relationship. Its hard for both of us for different reasons. But I never worry that we wont do what is right for us, whether that means staying together or breaking up. Our relationship is a job that we are both committed to seeing all the way through. A couple of weeks ago, I took some seeds out of my bag and put them in two of Pauls plants. Now, if you dont know drug lingo, let me translate that for you: A couple of weeks ago, I took some marijuana seeds out of my marijuana stash and put them in two of Pauls plants. Ok, that translation was totally unnecessary. Pennyhow, I didnt (lol pennyhow) tell Paul that I had put the seeds in there, thinking that nothing would happen anyway. Well, since Paul is Scientist/Gardener extraordinaire, the seeds have grown immensely. At first he was pissed that I just stuck old nasty Mary seeds in his beautiful Armarillas. But when I promised to take care of them on my own and to transplant them into a new pot, he agreed to go along with the process. The day I met Paul, he was getting ready to go to court for having been busted with growing Marijuana plants. He was having a party and the cops broke it up and found him growing four plants in his closet. They had just bloomed too. Getting Marijuana plants to actually bud (the bud is the part you can smoke) is like impossible, but Paul did it. Gosh, he makes me so proud. So my seeds are growing and fast! They are already 6 inches tall! They are pretty weak and Paul thinks they will die soon. He says that they definitely wont bud, but they may spawn better seeds. So we will see. But how fun! My own little illegal project. I love myself. YAY off to Broadway tonight. Two shows in one week. I am a SUPERSTAR. But without the smelly pits. Bodybodybodybodybodybodybodybodybodybodybodybodybodybodybodybodybodybody Bodybodybobodybananafannafofadi. I had a friend named fadi once. Ok, Im done.

 Spring has spa-RUNG dawgs! Wow. I know its only been 24 hours since my last post, but what a day it has been! So, last night was fucking amazing. I mean, last night was fucking HOO RAH amazing. It was the perfect start to a summer of gayness. Heres what I like to call The Deelio: Kelly and I showed up at Beige around 10:30pm. We immediately secured ourselves a spot at the bar, which is an incredible feat in itself. We werent there for more than 10 minutes before the bar tender comes over and says, A friend of yours has bought you a drink. I turn to Kelly and say, Wellity, wellity, wellitylooks like we are going to have a very lucrative evening! I then go to check in my coat at theumwellyeah the coat check. My turn comes in line and I realize that I went over there without any money. (Why do I embarrass myself at every possible occasion?) As I turn to walk back to my spot at the bar, I notice that Paul is talking to Kelly. He is with a girl I have never met, named Dierdra. I give him a quick peck on the cheek and turn to Kelly. Fuck Kelly! Paul is here and we just got our drinks bought by a potentially hot guy. Kelly smiles and says, I know! Cept the potentially hot guy that bought the drinks is Paul. Nooooooooooooooooo! I respond. And I thought that I was a stud or something. My friend Will showed up a couple minutes later and we all hung out for awhile. Now, I dont know if its the new pomade I am using or what, but I was getting more attention than the alcohol was. The boys were all over my shit. But the worst part about it was that I couldnt enjoy any of it cuz Paul was standing next to me the entire time. At one point, he and I went to the bathroom and this guy in line (who was ba ba ba BUILT) was checking me out. When Paul entered the bathroom before me, I hung back and said hi to him. He smiled and we made polite conversation before I had to take my piss. I know that I could have had his number in two seconds flat if I was alone. Suddenly Paul comes out of the bathroom, walks right over to my new boyfriend and me and says, Hes taken. He then put his arm around my shoulder and pushed me into the bathroom. Paul had every right to do that had he not already pissed me off by treating me as his property all night. He had his hands down my pants all evening. He kept putting his left hand in the back of my pants and kind of playing around in there. I asked him to stop and he refused to comply. Eventually I pulled his hand out, informed him that I am not his property and changed my place in our circle. He got offended and asked me what the problem was. The problem, Paul, is that you wont even kiss me when we are alone. Yet you see me getting all of this attention and now you realize what youve got. You have your hands all over me only because you know I am going to meet someone else tonight. Do you want to meet someone else tonight? Paul asks. I WANT my boyfriend to make love to me and to treat me like a human being. But since that doesnt seem to be sinking in to you, I am definitely going to do my best to meet someone else and get my sorry ass some physical affection. Then you would be cheating on me. And I wont stand for that. Yes I AM going to cheat on you and you dont have to stand for that. I am tired of this shit with you. I am a 25 year old guy that is very capable of meeting other attractive people. Joe, you are MY boyfriend. Paulact like it then. Otherwise deal with the repercussions of being a neglectful boyfriend. I am not going to wait around for you to improve yourself in this relationship anymore. Either fix it or let me go. After that brief yet poignant conversation, Paul and I hung out for a bit more before making the trek home. I decided to stay at his place since he lives right around the corner from Beige. On the way home we began to debate our relationship again. Joe, you are not going to cheat on me. Im serious. Paul, figure out why you havent touched me in the last 4 months or yes I AM going to cheat on you. If you cant handle that, then break up with me. I am in love with you and am not going to break up with you, but I refuse to deal with this shit any longer. I am absolutely exhausted by it. If I wasnt at the bar tonight, would you have met someone else? I think its very apparent by the attention I got tonight that I would have met somebody else. Paul, you dont own me and Im tired of having low self-esteem because of you. You are slowly destroying every bit of confidence that I have worked so hard to build. I have not. You have destroyed it yourself. You think you control this relationship. You think you make every decision regardless of how I feel. Then make the decision to let me go. If you dont want to be with me, then LET ME GO. At this point we began screaming at each other. We called each other every name in the book and our voices woke everybody in the apartment building. Finally we calmed down. I am not doing this with you anymore Paul. Im not. Either fix your shit or get out of this relationship. I know you moved to NYC for me. You have rubbed my face in it time and time again. But I am tired of living in a dead end relationship. I am tired of you not acting as though I am a priority. Basically, you have destroyed me. You have destroyed me too. You have torn me down, you have made me feel ugly, you have hurt me irreparably. Then we need to break up Paul. Who cares about the Bahamas vacation? Who cares about the plans for Memorial Day? Who cares about anything right now except for us being happy? And if being happy means that we have to be away from each other, then that is what we should do. Do you want to just be friends for awhile? Paul, we will never be friends. I have never been friends with anyone that I have dated and I have no plans to start with you. If you wont put in the effort to fix this relationship, then I have nothing else to say to you. You have broken my heart time and time again and I dont think that I want a friend like that. Thats fucked up Joe! You are saying that you will never speak to me again? That is exactly what I am saying. You dont have any more chances Paul. I am warning you now. Fix this or let me go. Fine. Lets get something to eat and go to bed. And thats what we did. We ate and went to bed. He did his best at kissing up to me and I wasnt having it. I didnt speak for the rest of the evening and I went to bed facing the wall. As we all know, I have had just about enough of Pauls shit. I know he loves me, but I cant hold his hand anymore. Its not fair to me. He held me all night long and when I woke up, he leaned over and kissed me. It was nice and it started my day off on a very positive note. If Paul puts in the effort, so will I. But I am going out on Friday night and I am planning on doing it up the way I want to do it up. I dont have a boyfriend on Friday night. I will be open and honest with Paul about everything that happens, but I will not hold myself back any longer. I see no reason to stick this out with him if he wont work at improving himself. We will see what happenswe will see if he can turn it around. Overall I did have a wonderful time last night. I love Beige. Its just about my favorite. The guys are fucking HOT(!) and they have a patio out back that is crowded with smokers. It is hella great. Also, one other thing has happened today that is absolutely terrific! Ari alerted me this morning to news that urlLink Kambri Crews was giving out free tickets to see Urban Cowboy . I wrote her an email and lo and behold, Paul and I will be going to see the show tomorrow night for free!!!!! I cant believe it! He and I have been talking about the show for months and now we get the chance to actually see it. The guys in it are supposed to be HOT HOT HOT! Kelly and I were talking about the show last night. She went to a big, expensive dinner on Monday too and saw a bunch of numbers from various Broadway musicals. She loved Urban Cowboy and couldnt stop talking about it. YAYAYAYAYAYAY! Paul is going to be so excited tonight when I tell him the news. Its my turn to take us out to dinner, so I have picked an incredible diner in Spanish Harlem. He will complain that its just a lowly diner as opposed to a five star restaurant, but once he tastes the food, he is sure to jizz all over the counter. We are supposed to talk about our relationship tonight. Imagine he breaks up with me and then I tell him Too bad, cuz you could have seen Urban Cowboy for free! I hope things work out with us. I really do. But I am thru begging and pleading with him. Its time for hard ball. Shape up or ship the fuck out.

 Wellity, wellity, wellity The dinner sucked my nuts. I hate smarmy people who have lots of money and dont give a shit about anyone, but themselves. I hate people who think that they are higher class then me and in turn act like it at every opportunity. I hate people who shove into me and knock me to the side as though they dont even notice me standing there. Our annual dinner was full of people who have more money than class. And for that, I drank my free wine and bolted before they even served the main course. Fucking assholes. Some day, when I have lots of money, I am going to make sure that I am nothing but sweet and INTERESTED in WHO other people are, regardless of their ethnicity, culture, or economical status. I am going to introduce myself to people that seem like they have something to say. I am never going to stand around and silently judge everyone else. I am fond of having a big and sensitive heart and I am not going to let the amount of money I have get in the way of my kindness. I am not going to be condescending and rude in order to make myself feel more important. I will rely on my own achievements to exemplify my character. I am not going to treat other people the way that I hate being treated. Take your chicken dinner and shove it up your ass. I think the moment that pissed me off the most was when one of my own co-workers snubbed me at the reception. I walked up to her to congratulate her on a job well done and in the middle of my compliment, she turned her back to me and walked away. Its not as though she had someone or somewhere to walk to either. She just walked away. GOD. In the real world, this woman would get her face beat in. She is a leach, always trying to tag along with people who matter in order to make herself look and feel important. But when you have Rosacea on your face and you wear a read suitlets just say that its best that you dont snub anyone, especially those that help you out (on a daily basis) in the workplace. Doris, you suck my dick. I dont know why I had such a problem with last night. During the event I remained very positive, laughing with Ari and a few others, joking about how I possess no class when I go to galas of any kind. I paid little to no attention to those around me and shoved my face with as many hor'doerves as possible. But when it came time for the main course, I found myself looking around at a room of people that could have cared less whether I showed up or not. I found myself supporting something that was based soley on financial status. And I didnt like it one bit. I turned to Ari and told her I was leaving. I was bored and I was annoyed. I cant stand rich people who dont have an ounce of respect inside their fickle bodies. I have had rich friends before and I have never felt as though I am any less of a person for the amount of money or social status I possess. Frankly, I feel better being who I am because I know I am real and that what comes out of my mouth is based on kindness and honesty. I dont use people to my advantage and I dont disrespect people because of who they are. My friends have always been the same way. But as I saw last night, it is a very naive world that I am living in. A world where celebrities and politicians are king. Those of you who are anything less better have a million dollars in your bank account or dont even bother trying to open your mouth. You clearly have nothing interesting to say. All in all I am glad that I went. I did get to eat some wonderful sushi and I downed at least 5 glasses of wine. The waiters were incredibly cute and I found myself trying to make eye contact and conversation with them at every moment. My boss paid for my cab home and Ari and I smoked a bowl before the whole thing went down. So there were good moments. Its just that these moments were overshadowed by a room filled with a bunch of smarmy smarms. Tonight I am off to Beige, one of the cities most respected gay bars. Brittany Spears and J. Timberlake have been known to frequent this place. But tonight I am going to have a drink with people who are in my league. I am going to scope out the other boys and be judged purely on my looks alone. That I can handle. My goal is to get at least one drink bought for me. Last time I was there, the fashion editor for Allure gave me his number. That was cool. Cept I dont DO fashion editors. I do sports editors. You understand. I feel so much better having bitched and moaned about all of the ridiculousness in the world. Now its time to go be with people just like me. Ahhhit feels good to go back to the real world. BTWthe pants I wore fit perfectly. I worry for nothing. SLURP!

 MAMMA MIA! MAMMA MIA! MAMMA MIA LET ME GO! I saw Mamma Mia this weekend in the Winter Garden Theater. Same place that Cats used to be in. I must say, this show was just about the best thing I have seen in forever. The music is absolutely wonderful and the show, itself, proves to be the most uplifting and upbeat piece of theater out there. During a time when most of us cant seem to put a smile on our face, Mamma Mia shows up and allows you to laugh and more importantly, be comfortable in laughing. I dont want to go into too much detail about the performance because everyone should have a chance to see it firsthand. But if you are looking for a way to cheer yourself up or to end a bad week on a really good note, this show is the way to go. Gosh, I just loved it. (my mom bought me the soundtrack as soon as we left the theater)(Im such a queen sometimes) Had an absolutely incredible weekend. Went to a house party, a club, a Broadway Show, a famous restaurant for lunch, and basically had a smile on my face the whole time. Being able to see my mother on Saturday made my entire weekend. I rarely get to see her on Mothers Day, but this year, I spent it with both my granny and my mom. Well, my dad was there too, but hes not special until mid-June. My granny is getting super old. On the outside she looks great, totally healthy and vibrant. Shes deaf-ish, but has been that way for as long as I can remember. But on this visit, I noticed that she was having a really difficult time walking. Im talking so difficult - that because of her foot pain, she wasnt able to see my apartment. Too many flights of stairs. It took us about a half an hour to walk four blocks. She was very positive during the entire trip, but at the same time I could tell that she was in pedestrian anguish. When we got to the theater, we quickly took our seats and my dad double checked to make sure that we were all in the appropriate places. I glanced at the seat numbers and assured him that we were. As the show is about ready to start, these two assholes show up and accuse us of sitting in their seats. My mom whips out our tickets and my granny starts in on my father about how he should have checked the seat numbers. The three of them stand up and the usher comes over to explain that we cant just move over one seat. She wanted to see the tickets and since the show was just about to start, she was very aggressive and obnoxious. My dad hands the usher bitch the tickets and while she is glancing them over, the couple starts complaining that they want to sit and look at the playbill before the show starts. This is turning into the biggest hassle, the woman said. Then dont show up 34 seconds before the show starts you fucking asshole! Anywaysas the chaos peaks, my dad yells out in the middle of the Broadway Theater I dont know where the hell you want us to sit, but make a choice and stick with it! Everyone in front of us turns around and glares at my father. I immediately bury my head in my hands and feel the embarrassment cover my face. There is murmuring in the crowd as to who the crazy man is in the back. I stand up, move over one seat, and tell my family to shut the fuck up. Just ignore these assholes. Its not your fault, I say to my father. Finally it all got straightened out and when my dad and I were having a cigarette during intermission, I gave him a hug and told him that I was sorry that I had gotten the seat numbers wrong. He wasnt angry with mejust frustrated with three women bitching in his ear. Fortunately the second act started without a hitch. snores. Tonight, my office is throwing their biggest event of the year. Its an annual dinner that we hope will raise close to 2 million dollas! Basically the entire thing is fucking boresville, but there will be free champagne by the gallons and a free dinner as well. I plan to leave as soon as my plate is clean and right before the speeches start. I figure that I can be at Pauls apartment before Mr. Personality starts. Yes, you read that correctly. I am bowing out of a million-dollar dinner before the speeches so that I can rush home to watch the lamest show on the planet. Dont judge me. Dont EVER judge me. So Joanna and I went to a house party this weekend. Well, more like an apartment party. At first I was very skeptical of us going, cuz I hadnt met anyone there before and Joanna and I are still new-ish friends. Butturns out that the party was AMAZING and I had the best time ever. The people were all doctors and lawyers and straight straight straight. So, as soon as I was done schmoozing and realizing that there was no chance of me ever landing myself a surgeon, we phoned up Mariah and took off for some gay fun. Gay it was. Well, that is if gay means fucking lame. Mariah and I hated the club we went to, so instead we went in and out of bars all over Times Square and then set off on a trek to find a 24-hour McDonalds. No such luck, but after wandering around for 45 minutes, I realized that earlier that day I had created my own special version of homemade macaroni and cheese. It was so fucking bomb that Mariah and I ate the entire batch in a matter of 6 minutes. I mean, we ATE and ATE and ATE. And then we fell asleep on my couch. But not before blaring Debbie Gibsons Electric Youth album at speaker breaking volumes. It was the funnest. Fuck you for thinking that I really use the word funnest.. Fuck you man. Yeah. yeah. Just found out that there may be a donor giving us a 3 million-dollar gift tonight at our dinner. UM! That is so good for so many reasons. Most importantly being that raise time is coming in July and I am so in need of some cold hard cash. If the gift is announced at the dinner, there is no way that my boss can tell me that there is no money left for a substantial raise. heh heh heh! Oh please let us get this money I am wearing a suit jacket and tie tonight. Kind of excited about that. I never get to dress up. The only thing is that the pants I am wearing are getting pretty tight. I was sure that I wouldnt fit into them this morning, cuz a month ago, I couldnt. But when I tried them on this morning, guess who looked fucking fly in their slacks?!? Well, not me, but I was still able to get the button shut. When I told my parents that I might not be able to wear my nicest slacks cuz of fatness, they burst out laughing and explained that I shouldnt have grown out of my pants at the age of 25. But Im not fat!, I exclaimed. Then you should be able to fit into your slacks, my mom said. Oh, then Im fat, I added. Cept I do in fact (in fat) fit into them now, so rock! Its pretty disconcerting to grow out of clothes. Especially when summer is right around the corner and I want to be able to show off my hotness at the beach. Yeah right, like I ever go to the beach to show off hotness. I go for the hot dogs and burgers! Cuz Im fat! All righttime to go beat one in the bathroom. Hope I dont get caught this time

 Work is too busy today to talk about much. In which case, I will only be doing the FRIDAY FILTHY FIVE! Im loving this shit. It gives me a chance to put my brain to rest and let my innards do the talking. Have you ever experienced female ejaculation, either as a participant or an observer? Not personally. Well, maybe. One time I fingered this girl and all this wetness came out, but I dont know if that counts. HOWEVER, Kelly and I rented this movie once called The Art of the Extended Orgasm. In it, one woman lies on her back while another woman (wearing surgical gloves) manipulates her clit to the point of ejaculation. But to Kelly and my shock, the womans ejaculation wasnt just cream. It was spurt after spurt of cum and it flew across the room, no less than 5 feet away. WE WERE SHOCKED AND I STILL CANT GET THE IMAGE OUT OF MY HEAD. So ladies, if you are not happy with the current load you are blowing, rent this flick and you can be shooting like a guy in no time! Does male ejaculate turn you on? If you are a guy, does it/would it turn you on to cum on someone, and if you are a girl or a guy, does it turn you on to have a guy cum on you? As a gay man, I should love to swim in cum. However, the taste, smell, and sight of it makes me want to vomit. After I ejaculate, I wipe off the cum or shower immediately. I really want nothing to do with it. Paul prefers to cum on me as it turns him on. I prefer to cum on no one as cum is from the inside of my body and I dont do well with inside the body things. the end. If you have tasted cum, please liken its flavor to something. If the guy is deserving, I have been known to swallow. Yet, most guys are not deserving and thats when I either spit it onto their stomach or run across the room and spit it into the garbage can. I cannot stand the taste of cum. I will wretch and puke immediately if I dont pretend as though I am tasting something other than jism. If I had to liken this nastiness to something, I would liken it to bloody boogers on bread. With a side of throat coat. Anal intercourse, yes or no? Have you tried it? Good? Bad? At 25 years old, I have yet to have anal intercourse. Paul and I have been together for 3 years and 4 months and we have yet to dive into this aspect of our relationship. At this point, we both want it to be special and we are waiting for that special time. Most people tell me just to DO IT(!) already. But clearly Im not ready. It will happen. Just not sure when yet. I think we are close to doing it. Last night I was jamming my erection into his ass crack while he laughed and tried to escape. (escape? ESCAPE?!!? escape.) Sometimes I just want to grind my dick into any surface. It just feels so good! What is the most socially taboo thing you will admit to being turned on by? There is very little that I am turned on by. But at the same time, that which turns me on, gets me going to the point of combustion! As we know I like huge muscles. I also get turned on by mens cologne, sweat, gym equipment, suits, cop/fireman uniforms, and scruff. Anything that exudes masculinity gets my cock blood boiling! I like my men big and powerful, confident bordering on arrogant. None of this is really taboo, but it can be if you choose to have a conversation about it at the local synagogue or cathedral. If my granny was here right now, the last thing we would talk about would be anal penetration and cum loads. But that again, she does have a third nipple, so she might be open to discussing tits and cunts. Who knows My answers are really suck today. I am just way too busy at work to expound further. Have a FUCKING GREAT weekend everyone! Keep in mindits the lusty month of May!

 First and foremost, I have to take back some false information that I posted on here a couple days ago. Luther Vandross is NOT dead. Someone at work told me he was and I immediately posted the sad news on this site. But after a week with no news about the event, I did some researching. Luther Vandross is still in rough shape, but he is alive. I apologize for posting incorrect information. Stupid Joe. Stupid, stupid cunnilingus stupid. If you are not watching DZO on Sorority Life or their Brother Fraternity (Sigma Chi somethin or other) on Fraternity Life , then you dont know what you are missing. I am a sucker for MTV reality TV. They are the original and the best. (Do I even have to say it again?) Last night, I was lucky enough to catch the new episodes as they premiered - rather than sitting around all Saturday afternoon catching up on my missed moments. The shows are essentially Lois Lame, but I am nevertheless addicted. Especially because the shows take place at the University of Buffalo, which is 2 and a half hours from where I went to college. Its weird watching these kids, cuz I feel as though its a complete flashback to my college. You knowthe nails on a chalkboard accents, the keg parties, the late night drives, eating lunch in the Unionif you were ever wondering where Joe CuttheShit went to college, tune in to MTV on Wednesday nights at 10pm. These boners make me feel all nostalgic and shit. Ahthe dayz. A week from Saturday, I am going to The Quiet Party . Joanna and I discovered this party when we were playing on Craigs List . The premise of the party is simple. There will be no loud music and no craziness. No screaming and no yelling. From what I imagine, there will be candles lit and light jazz playing on the corner jukebox. A place where singles can meet and get to know each other without having to scream over the top of unnecessarily loud speakers. In the back room (and this is the best part), there is no talking AT ALL! It is a silent room where you can only talk to other people via paper and pencil. If you have something you want to say to the girl sitting across the room, you must write her a note on a piece of paper and pass it along to her. If you want to buy a good-looking guy a drink (me!), you write that offer on a piece of paper and pass it to me. Fun, right?!?! Joanna is excited to meet some interesting single guys and I think that this would be a great opportunity for her. I also invited Ari as I think she could benefit from a night out with good people and mature men. No psychos allowed. I anticipate it being a very good time. As long as I can keep my mouth shut for more than 5 minutes. Tidbits of Today: -I have taken a literal shit every half-hour since 8am. This means that I have shit 7 times so far today. 7 times sitting on the toilet and 7 times wiping my asshole raw. -I ate an Odwalla bar and absolutely hated it. -I spent 20 minutes looking at muscle pictures when I got to work. Making sure to minimize the screen when the housekeeper emptied my garbage can. -After leaving Aris apartment last night, I ate a huge cheeseburger and French fry dinner. It tasted so damn good, but wasnt totally fulfilling. When Paul showed up at my apartment an hour later, I faked that I hadnt eaten all day and he ordered me a sandwich from Subway. I ate that too. (ahhhis this the reason for my chronic shitting?) -My hair is so spikey that it breaks the sound barrier. Sound barrier? Yeah, sound barrier. -I almost got caught masturbating in the bathroom. -I have a nugget of pot in my cigarette pack for when I go to Pauls apartment later. -Am eating pizza for lunch because I am sick and tired of eating fruit every day. I need a break from all this healthy nonsense. -I put on both deodorant and AXE Body Spray and still reek of sour BO. -Tried to buy my mom a Teddy Bear from Vermont Teddy Bear Company, but found out that they were $100 each. Then decided to make her a teddy bear card. -Bit off one of my fingernails, which caused a hangnail to form, after which, I ripped out the hanger and now have blood dripping down my right ring finger. -Smelled fart in our supply room at work and in turn made sure to blame it on anyone and everyone around me. I didnt lay the fart bomb, but wasnt at all willing to take the silent blame for it either. -Realized that by writing these Tidbits I have made myself sound like the most stank, disgusting boy on the planet. In other news Nell Carter is still dead. The agency that I auditioned for last week still hasnt called me. I guess they didnt like my thank you note that much. For the first couple days of this week, I would run up the stairs to my apartment, burst through the door, and look at the answering machine with hopeful eyes. As of yesterday, I just gave up. Fuck them. If they dont want my hot ass then I certainly dont want their snores filled asses. It was a good first start. Now I must find a new agency to audition for next week and then another and another and another. yeah. YEAH! But then again, maybe they will call me tonightpwease? pwease and carrots? Because I am a broke bitch, I wont be able to see Justin Timberlake and Christina Aguileras tour this summer. I mean, its the hot ticket of the year. Everyone who is anyone loves Justin and Christina. I hear all this talk about Radiohead and Ben Harper and Jack Johnson and I think, Sure these people are wonderfully talented, but they arent Justin. No one is. Not even Justin. Oh great! I have to poop again! What IS this?!?! Did I eat a bowl of dysentery last night? I mean, fucking for real. I am going to have permanent creases on my ass from sitting on the bowl all day. Alright, outtie. Peace out my little ghoulies.

 If its broke, you can always fix it! Okayso I will be the first to admit it. I make a big deal out of nothing. I can be overly dramatic, I can blow things out of proportion and I definitely take everything way too personally. I have been this way for as long as I can remember and changing it seems about impossible. The reason I am writing all of this is because last night I had a wonderful evening with Paul. Oops. I have this problem of opening up and laying all of my shit on the table with both my friends and this journal whenever anything goes wrong. Or at least when I start to get deeply upset about the problems I am facing. Over the last 72 hours I have broken up with Paul in my head a number of different ways. In one such fantasy, I arrive at his house, enter via the keys he made me, grab all of my shit, stuff it in my backpack, and finally turn to tell him that Its over. Once and for all. Thank God there is a part of me that calms me down and forces me to get advice from my friends and family. If I didnt do that and I acted completely on impulse, I would be sitting here most likely regretting my hasty decision. Paul called me at work yesterday. He was very sweet on the phone and when I informed him of my plans for the evening, he asked me to break them. He wanted to see me. Against my better judgement, I obliged and told him that I could be at his pad by 6pm. When I arrived at his front door, he was nowhere to be found. I let myself in and walked to his bedroom. When I opened the door, there was nothing but a pile of blankets. I immediately ripped off the pile in one fell swoop and exposed my naked boyfriend. He screamed and started hysterically laughing. The sound of his joy was so contagious, that I immediately forgot why I was angry and jumped on top of him. We wrestled for a bit, laughing and pinching and acting as though our relationship was based completely on shits and giggles. After we calmed down a bit, we started talking about anything and everything. I had decided before arriving at his place that I wasnt going to bring up the problems of our relationship. I was just going to have a good night with him and encourage him to talk to Mariah. This plan worked for the first hour we were together, but out of nowhere, we began arguing over something stupid. Having debated breaking up with him in my head over the last couple of days, I felt all of the anger, hurt, and frustration fly back into me. I told him that we were headed down a path of destruction and that if things didnt change soon, we would be forced to go our separate ways. It was at this moment that I realized that I am overly dramatic, blowing things out of proportion, and taking things way to personally. Paul stared at me blankly. He asked So, you want to break up? I explained that I didnt want to break up, that that was the farthest thing from my mind. I told him how deeply in love with him that I am. But then I hit him with the reality that we might be better off as people if we took a break from each other. I suggested that maybe we should take a month off from seeing one another, just to get perspective. The look of horror on his face said it all. But Joe, you are the only one I want to see. If I cant see you, I dont want to see anyone. My heart melted. I told Paul that I simply was not happy with our relationship. I explained that I am not comfortable with the way he talks to me, that he can be condescending and cruel. As I continued to explain my position, he got very defensive. We decided to drop the talk altogether and go to dinner. Once we had arrived at probably the worst restaurant either of us have ever been to (the food was fucking nast), Paul brought up our Bahamas vacation. I informed him that I had talked to my mother and that there were ways out of the trip. Once he saw that I was serious, his entire demeanor changed. We discussed at great length about the way we treat each other. He was verbal with me and open about how he perceives me in the relationship. Going into the conversation, I was just as closed minded about my wrong doings, as he has been in the past. I found the anger building in me when he was laying all of our issues on the table. I bit my tongue and I sat there and gave him a chance to speak his mind. Fortunately, it was the smartest thing I could have done. Once Paul explained himself, I felt a release of all of the pressure that had been building up inside of me for the last week. We then had the most productive conversation that we have had in the longest time. Its funny how everything can change in the matter of minutes. He became this beautiful boy again and not the monster that I had been envisioning. When he reached across the table to touch my hand at a delicate point of the conversation, I knew that I had lost the battle again. We would not be breaking up. We would be giving our relationship yet another chance. The one thing that I was not flexible on was our lack of intimacy. He tried to explain to me why he doesnt want to be physical and it made some sense. SOME sense. I still feel as though there is no excuse for using sex as a weapon in a relationship and I explained that to him in great detail. I also told him of my fear of us never actually having intercourse, as we cant even kiss on the lips these days. He then did a typical Paul thing and said, Lets have sex (anal sex) tonight! I burst out laughing and told him Never. Because Paul can sometimes be a clueless moron about things, he made me discuss why it wasnt normal for us to have anal sex for the first time when we dont even suck each others dicks anymore. Eventually he backed down and agreed to start working on our physicality. By the end of dinner, we were back in love and ready to grow. We laughed all the way home and when we got back into his apartment, he turned to me, kissed me on the cheek and said I love you Joe. THATS EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED. To feel appreciated, to feel loved, and to feel wanted. All of the things that any guy would need to get from his boyfriend. I have learned quite a few lessons over the last couple of days. Mostly about how I am as a boyfriend. I am lucky to be surrounded by people who care about me and love me so much that they want nothing more than for me to be happy. Although Paul and I exist within the same group of friends (a very dangerous thing I might add), we are both blessed to have surrounded ourselves with people who dont take sides except when needed. They are objective and understanding. They are a true support system. Engineered and designed specifically for nut cases like Paul and I. I know it seems like I deserve better and that may be true. But until I fall out of love with this guy there is no hope of me ever moving on without him. His happiness is my happiness. I dont like to give up on anything. Especially not something like this. If it takes more work, I am willing to put it in. We could have the opportunity to achieve emotional levels with each other that I never thought was possible before. I dont want to lose him or give up on him until I am sure that we have hit our plateau. I need to keep in mind that Paul struggles with his own issues too. I am not the only one in this relationship who is suffering from the trials of life. My mom told me yesterday that I need to make sure that I am not projecting my current misery on him. He is not the answer to all of my problems. Yet it is so easy to sit in here and write about how badly he treats me, when I really should be sitting here focusing on fixing my own shit. I need to be there for Paul just as I want him to be here for me. I am not the center of the universe. I am just a star. Ok, that was a lame ass analogy, but you get the idea. Thanks for putting up with my struggles over the last couple of days. If I didnt have this journal here to release everything that is in my head, I would certainly make some irreparable decisions. Starting this thing up was the best idea Rita ever gave to me.

 If Cinco De Mayo is translated into English, the definition must be Crazy, Intense, Day of the Ludicrous. My gosh, if last night was anymore dramatic, I think my head would have exploded into a thousand miniscule pieces. Let me explain Paul called me at 4:30pm yesterday to see how I was doing. Having had a day of hating our relationship, I was very weird with him on the phone. He asked me what we were doing for dinner and I quickly said that I already had plans with the girls. He responded with No one called me. I did my best to be polite and tried to get off the phone as quickly as possible. He wanted to know what was wrong with me and I briefly explained that I wasnt very happy with the conversation we had on Saturday. He gave me the same old excuses for his meanness and I just sat there quietly. Eventually we got off the phone and as I sat at my desk, I started to feel really terrible for upsetting him. I called him back and we spoke for a couple of minutes about whether or not he was going to meet us out. He said he would think about it. For the rest of the night, I called him over and over (because my number is blocked at home and he wouldnt know it was me calling) to check up on him. He never answered the phone. Mariah, Joanna, Rachel the fuckface, and Mariahs friends Anne and Trevor, went with me to a bar called Cacti Jacks Cantina. When we walked into the front doors, my anxiety was working over time. I knew that we were going to a straight bar, but I didnt know that it was going to be one big frat. party. At first, I was ready to bolt. I was pretty uncomfortable and I had no expectation of fitting into this sweaty and loud and obnoxious environment. The girls were kinda busted, but did their best to wear the hoochiest of clothing in order to make them somewhat attractive. The guys were kinda busted too, but were exuding testosterone and masculinity all over the place. And for that, I loved it. Then after 3 margaritas and some of the worst music I have ever heard in my life I started to fall in love with the place. Of course I found both a boyfriend and a girlfriend within the matter of an hour. Girls, finewe are in a straight bar. But a guy hitting on me? How does that happen? But it did. He was a bit too girly for my tastes so I ignored him completely. A guy with broad shoulders and a rippling chest walked in and he was the one I wanted. But of course I didnt go up to him and say anything. I like having a full row of front teeth afterall. Joanna left the bar at 8:30pm and I decided to stay for one more margarita with the rest of the crew. We danced and drank and watched two girls pretend they were lesbians and make out on the top of the bar. The guys were hollering and cheering them on and I felt like the entire thing was so Lois Lame and overdone. But whatever I decided to leave the bar at around 9:30pm. Mariah offered to walk me to the door and she and I had a few cigarettes before saying goodbye. I dont know how it happened, but I started sobbing about how Paul and I are headed for a break-up. SIDE NOTE: Back when I first met Mariah, I went through a very hard break-up with her and her then girlfriend Kathleen. They had been together for 5 years when Kathleen decided to break up with Mariah. Stupid, stupid mistake for Kathleen, but I stood by Mariahs side throughout the entire ordeal and I understood every time she went running back to her. But now, Mariah is over Kat and although Kat still calls her and begs for a revival of their relationship, she has moved on in a more productive and positive direction. So Mariah stood with me in the drizzling rain and hugged me and talked to me and made sure that I was okay, before sending me home in a cab. She was a God send last night. Especially since when she went back into the bar, Rachel threw a fucking tantrum because Mariah had ignored her for a matter of 10 minutes. Rachel ripped me apart behind my back and told Mariah that she is a terrible friend and that gay people are always so dramatic and a waste of time. Rachel is a fucking cunt that deserves to get her smarmy face punched in. I am about on my last nerve with that bitch and if she makes Mariah feel unnecessarily bad about one more thing, I am going to ruin her life. When I got home, I began to feel incredibly lonely for Paul. I thought a lot about our current situation and I started to really question myself and my reasons for wanting to break up. Truth is, I am still very deeply in love with him. I hurt when he hurts. Making him angry or upset really brings me down. I feel terrible inside when he gets sad or lonely. If this were the perfect world, Paul would turn into the best boyfriend ever and we would have a wonderful and loving relationship. We would make love and he wouldnt throw past shit in my face. We would go to movies and he wouldnt tell me to watch what I eat. We could spend all day in bed, just because we love being with each other so much. But this is not the perfect world and none of this is currently possible. As I was running all of this through my head, the phone rang and it was Mariah calling to check up on me. When I answered the phone, she was crying. I asked her what was wrong and she said that she was just so upset for me. She hates to see me cry and she said that she had been running our conversation over and over in her head throughout the rest of the evening. We cried a bit together on the phone and I felt so loved. Mariah has been the third wheel to my relationship with Paul for as long as I can remember. She is very good friends with him and wants nothing more than for us to be in love. And happy. It breaks her heart that we arent happy right now and she wants to help fix it. I told her that as Pauls best friend, I think that she needs to sit him down and explain to him what is happening. He wont listen to me, but he will hear everything she has to say. And maybe that will be what it takes to get he and I back on track. But if notif not, then I am going to have to trust in my friends to help me heal my heart which has already started to break. Do whats best for Joe. Make Joe the first priority. Re-discover who you are as an independent person. So much advice has been given to me and so much love has been shown to me. But its up to me to make the decision for myself. And right now, I am still completely confused. And I miss Paul so much. After calling Paul a few times with no luck, I fell asleep. It was pretty lonely lying in my big bed all by myself. I positioned all of my pillows around me to pretend as though I wasnt alone. To my delight and surprise, when I woke up in the middle of the night, Trey, Kellys baby boy (our cat) was curled up inside my arm. I was so shocked that I jumped out of my skin when I saw him there. He immediately ran away and I chased him through the apartment trying to get him to come back and lay with me. All of this happening at 3:30am. Finally I gave up and went back to sleep. When I woke up this morning, there was little Trey again, curled up in my arm. This is the first time that he has done this and I have never needed it more in my life. When I left to go to work this morning, it made me so upset to have to leave him behind. He was so sweet last night and I wanted to stuff him in my bag and carry him to work. Mariah offered to take me out to dinner tonight to get my mind off of everything serious. I am not sure that I am going to go yet, but the offer is still on the table. We are also going out to a busy and overcrowded gay bar this weekend. I am so overdue. I need to feel wanted and I will surely get some attention from the ridiculous boys at one of the local clubs. Plus she offered to pay, since at this moment I have $8 in my checking account. Yipes. Seriously yipes. Time to go enjoy a bout of diarrhea. Knew I had one too many margaritas last night

 Happy Cinco De Mayo everyone! I am very excited to leave work and go meet up with Joanna and Mariah at a very famous Mexican Place in the city. At 6pm, picture me chugging down some Coronas with Lime and maybe even chowing down on a plate of nachos. You may even imagine me wearing a sombrero, but that would be foolish. This cat doesnt do shit like that in public for fear of ridicule. But you can definitely assume that I will be wearing my burro costume. What kind of mockery could come from that?!?! After allit IS CINCO DE MAYO! AY YI YI! Paul and I are quickly going down the tubes. Ive about had it with him. Yes, I know I say this a lot and yes I know I have broken up with him twice before But this time when we go our separate ways, we do it for good. I am not playing games with him anymore. Honestly, I feel like I hate him. I dont know what it is. Maybe I was pretending for too long that things were going well, just so I didnt have to deal with the fact that I was stuck in a dead end relationship. Maybe, deep down in my heart, I believed that he and I would eventually iron out the kinks and end up successful and happy. Maybe I just didnt want to confront the fact that I have dedicated three years of my life to someone who makes me completely unhappy. Very often I write in this journal about how great Paul is and how much fun we have together. Sometimes its true. But please understand that I am definitely STRETCHING the story as best as I can to make him come out looking all right. If I came into this journal every day and bitched about how terrible he was the night before, the entries would get old and played out and hella fucking boring. Truth is, Paul has treated me with little to no respect since I have known him. And I am not someone to sit around and complain every day about how terrible everything with him really is. I constantly write how in love with him I am, but thats because Id rather say that then get into what is really going on. It used to be cute when he was tough on me. I used to like the challenge of being with a guy that doesnt really like me. I get bored in relationships easily and I drop them without even a second thought. But with Paul, there was something deeper, something holding us together. What that was, I dont remember anymore. All I know now is that Paul treats me like shit. He isnt kind to me and he never treats me with any sort of gentleness. In fact, so much of our relationship has been tainted that I am not sure if he even likes the sight of me anymore. Paul has quite a few intimacy problems, as has been discussed at great lengths in this journal. He wont kiss me, he wont touch mefuckhe wont even hug me without holding one hand against my chest to push me away. Of course I have tried to have numerous conversations with him about all of this and when I am asked what the results of these conversations are, I am left to shrug my shoulders and say I really dont know. Paul isnt a communicator. I will talk and talk about what I think we need to do to fix the relationship and he will just stare at me blankly or wait for me to finish what I am saying and then counter with a rude and insensitive remark. A remark that is totally unrelated to what we are discussing. I give him every possible opportunity to treat me better. I am very vocal about what I want out of our relationship and of the expectations that I have of him. Basically, Paul just must not care. Or he has fallen out of love with me and is afraid to let me know. Maybe thats it. Maybe he simply doesnt love me anymore and doesnt know how to go forward with breaking my heart. But I would rather have my heart broken once and for all, have it heal, and move on from there; get away from him before he completely destroys my faith in other men. I DONT KNOW! I am completely confused as to what to do. Its not like he has cheated on me or like he beats the shit out of me. Its not like he has done anything wrong in specific that would cause the end of our time together. I just dont know. The thing that perplexes me the most is that we have a vacation to the Bahamas planned for July. I dont have any money saved up for it and going on the trip would just put me further in debt. If he and I were in a good place right now, the debt wouldnt bother me at all. But the idea of spending $800 on a trip to be with someone who wont even kiss me seems absolutely ludicrous. I just got off the phone with my mom and I explained the entire situation to her. Basically we have to go on the trip or we will still be forced to spend all of the money for nothing. Here are our options: 1) I can go on the trip with someone else. I can have the name on the plane ticket changed and I can bring a friend with me. 2) Paul can go on the trip and I can pay $100 to change my ticket, but allow him to use the condo on his own with a friend of his choosing. 3) Spend the $400 for the condo and plane ticket and just throw the whole thing away as a stupid mistake. Besides that, there is nothing left for me to do. The biggest part of this whole problem is that if we dont go on the trip, he and I are definitely done. The advice I have been given from numerous people is Dont stay with Paul just because of the Bahamas vacation. While that makes sense, I know that deep down, if we dont go, we are done. Forever done. So part of me wants to go on the trip because that part of me doesnt want to face this break-up. Goshjust so confused. Do I really want to break up with him? Is there no other solution? If I talk to him about all of this again, will he respond in a beneficial way or will he do what he has done in the past and shut me out? If he shuts me out again, it is going to be hard for him to come back to me at any point in the future. Paul and I havent talked since Saturday because during a phone call that afternoon, he said something to me that was pretty horrible. I didnt hang up on him, I didnt yell at him, I simply got off the phone and thought about what he said. Instead of having him come over to my house, I told him that I was going out with other people, locked the door and didnt answer any of his calls for the rest of the weekend. We usually spend Monday nights together, but tonight I have made other plans. I am not calling him to tell him that I have made other plansI am just going. He has yet to call me today at work and I am pretty much hoping he doesnt. I want to avoid talking to him for as long as possible. We have a lot of anger built into our relationship and I dont know if any conversation we have could fix this. I am left not knowing what to do. Would I be better without him? Or Am I giving up too soon?

 Disclaimer: I hate leaving disclaimers, but I think I should for this entry. If you are offended by gay, graphic sexual conversation, then this is not the post for you. I suggest you check out a more boring and bland site, such as www.imaclosedmindednofunloser.com I have yet to participate in Pussy Ranchs Filthy Friday Five questionnaire thing, but today I figured I would give it a shot. Here we go: What did you think about the last time you masturbated? The last time I masturbated, I thought about a male bodybuilder. (no one in particular) I have always had a very strong fetish for guys with a lot of muscle. So EVERY time I masturbate, thats what I am thinking about. I mean, what girl doesnt want to be picked up in a strong mans arms, then carried into the bedroom, only to be fucked by a guy that smells and feels like MAN!?!? GoshI think I might have to go rub one out in the bathroom at my work. These questions are getting me HORNY and I am only on the first one! How often do you masturbate? This depends. Definitely every day. I really try not to let a whole 24-hour period go by without an orgasm. I find that it soothes and relaxes me. The most I have jerked in one day is 6 times. I want to try for 7, but my dick has like zero skin left once I pop off number 6. Most of the time I am a two times a day type of guy. But like I said, it depends. Do you prefer visuals, literature or any other kind of stimulus? GREAT QUESTION! I prefer a photo of the guy that turns me on for that day sitting next to me as I read a hot piece of erotic literature. I am huge into muscle fantasies and find that there are quite a few really good stories on the net. Of course I have a couple of videos, but I dont get turned on by anal fucking, so its hard for me to find that right video that has kissing bodybuilders. Of course I have a dildo. Well, actually, I have two. One is little, probably the size of my middle finger, and the other is quite large and in order for me to insert that bad boy, I have to lube up and get myself all hot and bothered. Soin conclusionI prefer erotic literature combined with a photo combined with the dildo of my choice. ROCK! When was the first time you masturbated? What was your "method?" The first time I masturbated, I was 14 years old and home on spring break from highschool. I had been trying to masturbate for a couple of months and with no success. So, as was previously mentioned in this journal, one day I was watching Gilad: Bodies in Motion and I noticed that Gilad was looking extrawellGilad-like that day. I stood in front of my television and pulled on my pud for at least an hour with no luck. After pulling and yanking and pulling and yanking and pulling and yanking, some white stuff flew out of my cock and gave me the SHOCK of my life. I think I screamed when it happened. It felt like something I have never experienced before. It was so unexpected. My heart was pounding out of my chest and I felt like I must have done it wrong. It felt so overwhelmingly good and strange and I kind of panicked. Eventually, like 20 minutes later, I began tugging and tugging again hoping to repeat the process with the same outcome. Unfortunately, at the time, I didnt realize that it takes a while to build up a new supply of cum, so I would pull and pull for hours before it happened again. From the moment of my first orgasm until now, I have yet to stop pulling on my cock. I just love it. Do you enjoy watching others "love themselves" or is it a purely solo act? I HATE watching others please themselves. Ok, I dont HATE it. But it does nothing for me, but make me bored. Problem is that I am not attracted to 98% of men. I need them to have TONS of sex appeal or I need them to be BIG and STRONG. If they arent one of these two things, then I have no interest in seeing them whip out their cock and balls and go to town. Unless I am in the midst of a mutual masturbation session, I am completely bored by another guy gratifying himself. My own personal question: What do you do during orgasm to make the experience even that much better? Try out these wonderful little tricks to extend or intensify that orgasm: 1) At the point of creaming, tighten every muscle in your legs. 2) If comfortable with inserting objects into your anus (sick, I hate that word anus), take your finger and stick it in only slightly into your asshole and curve it like a hook. At the point of orgasm, use this hook to stretch your asshole. Once you get comfortable with poking around in there, you will find that there are quite a few erogenous zones in that area. Good luck in discovering your own! 3) At the point of orgasm, hold your breath and dont let it out until the orgasm is over. The overwhelming body sensation is probably dangerous, but it feels pretty good. 4) When your dick is about to explode with cum, slow down the jerking technique that you use and try to make the orgasm last as long as you can. Slow jerks will make the orgasm extreme and wonderful. This process might take a few tries before you can get it down to perfection. 5) At the moment of orgasm, pinch the vas deferens shut (thats the tube that the cum flows out of). It hurts, but you can still experience an orgasm and return to jerking off 10 minutes later because you havent spent all the cum in that one moment. Plusthe next orgasm you have will be BIZOMB! And I guess thats it! If youve got any other suggestions, leave them in my comments. Always interested in trying out other peoples techniques! Have a great weekend yall. Im going home to play with myself!

 Luther Vandross has passed away. Why are we losing so many of our fundamental artists? God rest his soul. It's definitely a loss for all of us.

 WELL! The audition went very smoothly. I arrived at the agency at 3:40pm for my 4pm time slot. The receptionists were a bit aggressive and I have to admit that they did nothing but add to my heightened level of stress. They handed me my audition piece and it was pretty difficult. I expected something much more basic and easy to read than what they handed me. But for about a half an hour I went over and over the lines and came up with the interpretation that I thought worked best for me. At 4:15pm I went in and was greeted by a very professional man named, Richard, who told me not to overact and not to be too loud. (I have a feeling that most people that do this reading for him go into it full force and end up way off mark) (Plus, he must hear this reading every day, all day, and was probably tired of people coming in and treating the piece as though it was to be the next Oscar winning performance) I handed him my headshot and resume and he commented on how I have zero film experience. I explained that that was my reason for auditioning for his agency. They are well known for placing both Union and Non-Union actors in bit parts for upcoming commercials and films. After my reading, Richard told me that he liked what I submitted to him and that I should call today at 10:30am to find out how we were going to go forward with all of this. I did call this morning and was told by a different Richard (one of his fellow agents) that they were still reviewing my submission and that they would be in touch soon. I find these people to be very intimidating, but I figure its my place to be humble and to do whatever they say. After I got off the phone with the second Richard, I typed up a quick thank you note and am planning on mailing it to the agency this afternoon. Just to keep me in the forefront of their minds. So who knows? Basically, if they decide not to go with me, I am fine with that. My biggest accomplishment was actually going TO the audition and not bailing like I have done in the past. So YAY! Regardless, I have a few other agencies that I will be checking out over the weekend and I hope to make appointments with them next week. I hope this is the start of a very wonderful career as an actor! We will see MY BROTHER CALLED ME THIS MORNING! Imagine my shock when I answered the phone and heard his voice broadcasting loud and clear from somewhere in the Middle East. He sounded good overall, but I could tell that deep down he wants nothing more than to toss in the towel and come home. He has definitely lost the passion for the military and is doing his best to complete his required service time. I can tell that he misses his family and his girlfriend too much. I did my best to be as supportive as possible and I encouraged him to do the best job he could possibly do. And I have no question in my mind that he will do just that. I wasnt allowed to know where he is stationed right now and we werent allowed to discuss anything military oriented for fear that the line would be cut off. At one point I asked him if he had told anyone in his battalion that he was a homosexual and after he burst out laughing, he asked me not to say anything that could be misinterpreted again. There are military people listening to everything you say during this phone call Joe. Be careful. I reply with Yeah, but have you found yourself a boyfriend? He laughed again. When we were talking there was a delay in everything he said. Damn Satellite phones. Kind of like what happens when news correspondents from Baghdad broadcast their information to the CNN news reporters. On TV the delay isnt as funny as it is when you are on the phone. I would say something like Last night I took a shit that looked black and blue. Then before he could respond I would say Mom is still pretty upset about you being gone and then he would laugh out loud. It took me a minute to realize that in order for us to have a normal conversation, I would have to slow down and wait for his response. I got the hang of it towards the end. In any case, talking to him made my entire day. He is safe and he sounds good. As long as that remains, so will my sanity. Last night, Paul and I had our date night. He picked a restaurant off of the internet called The Hour Glass Tavern. When we showed up at the restaurant, I immediately thought that the experience was going to be a disaster. The crowd looked very stuffy and straight-laced and if youve read my archives, you know that we have had bad restaurant experiences before. But we went in and sat down at a table anyway. Turns outit was the best restaurant that either he or I have been to in the city. We got our usual three courses and we also received a free batch of their homemade bread and a free vegetarian casserole appetizer. Both were excellent. We had filet mignons and a glass of wine and the food was so fucking good that I ate my own poop this morning, just to savor the taste one more time. The ambiance was wonderful and the waitstaff was incredible. We are so heading back there some time soon. After dinner, Paul and I walked around the city for a bit and then got some ice cream. We laughed, we debated, we had a great time. Overall yesterday was an excellent day. I felt like a normal kid again. Not anything like the depressed sad sap of last week. This is not to say that I still dont need to find myself a doctor and counselor, cuz I do. It just felt good to live a normal life for a day, without worry as to whether or not I was going to start crying over something lame. OH! I keep forgetting to write about this ridiculous thing that happened last Sunday night. Paul and I were sleeping together in my bed and it was one of those nights where we both tossed and turned throughout the entire evening. Well, around 4:00am, I was having this dream where I was trying to smash something. I kept taking my hand and slamming it down on a counter. I remember repeating this process over and over. Suddenly I wake up with a start and Paul tells me that I have been slapping my stomach repeatedly. I told him that was impossible, that I would never slap myself while I slept. He turned on the light and to my shock and horror, I had welts in the shape of my handprint. My stomach was bright red and there were finger marks. What the fuck? I told him that I was sure he took my own hand and slapped it against my stomach and then blamed it on me. Cuz why would I slap myself while I slept?? Needless to say, I am sure he didnt force me to hit myself. But it still perturbs me to think that I harm myself while I sleep. Now, every night before we go to sleep, Paul tells me to behave myself. I always laugh when he says it, but then turn over and face the wall worried. Joe, please do behave yourself, I say over and over in my head. Since we have been together, I have done quite a few random things while sleeping in bed with him. The biggest and most horrifying thing I have ever done was pee on him. Yes you read that correctly. I peed on him. We had been together for exactly 3 weeks and he came to visit me at my college. I woke up one morning and thought My God, I sweated my ass off last night and then as I shed my grogginess, I realized that I had sweat ALL OVER THE BED! I ripped open the sheets to discover that both Paul and I were covered in my piss. It took me weeks to get over that experience. I have never pissed the bed before and I definitely wasnt drunk before we had gone to bed. Not that I have ever pissed in my bed when I was drunk, but I have heard of it happening. His little joke after that incident was Joe, please dont pee on me while we sleep. MAN! I STILL CANT BELIEVE I DID THAT! In any case, it hasnt happened since. Alright, time for lunch. Am going to the park to celebrate the fact that it is absolutely beautiful outside. (Did I really just write about how I pissed on my boyfriend?)

 Wellity, wellity Gay Pride was a complete success! I got out of my mood the second I left work. Figures that that was what was bringing me down! We did and saw and participated in so many events that it would be impossible for me to list them all. But I will say that the best time we had was at the Gay Pride Parade. There were tens of thousands of gay people strewn about 5th avenue screaming and chanting and being one. The floats were incredible, the music was PUMPING, and the costumes were lavish and fun. There were gay babies, gay senior citizens, gays with one leg, political representatives, famous musicians, playwrights, body builders, strippers, dancers, etc. Standing among this massive crown of people filled with me so much pride, I almost started to weep with joy during a couple different moments. There are very few times in my life when I feel an identity towards a specific group of people. This weekend was definitely one of them. I felt so much happiness and joy in my sexuality. Who wants to be straight when you can be GAY? Surely not me. The lesbian places we went to turned out to be a lot of fun and totally welcoming to gay men. I was shocked and relieved that I didnt have to split up with my friends. We drank from 5pm on Friday straight thru to 5pm yesterday, only stopping to sleep during 4-hour intervals here and there. I thought I was going to die on Saturday afternoon, but somehow I found the energy and pushed through. Thank God that I did. I feel so happy that I was able to attend everything that I wanted to and that I didnt let my exhaustion get the best of me. Here are some highlights from the weekend of GAY: 1) At the lesbian party on the Hudson River, I decided that the bathroom line was WAY too long. I asked everyone to give me their empty cups and to form a tight lesbian circle around me. With my friends protecting me from the thousands of lesbians at the party, I whipped out my dick and filled up two glasses with piss. Two minutes later, Mariah bumped into my friend, Angie who was in the process of holding one of my piss cups. It spilled and drenched everyone with steaming hot urine. We laughed and laughed and smelled like booze piss for the rest of the night. 2) In one evening, we stumbled across at least 4 different groups of people smoking pot. They ALL included us in their smoking sessions and for the first time in forever, I didnt have to bring or pay for all of the pot we smoked. Everyone was so generous and wonderful about it. 3) I hooked up with Ahmad twice. Once when we crashed at my place at 4am, Saturday morning, and once more when we woke up at 9am, Saturday morning. He came the first time, I came the second time. After I wiped up my cum, I told him to Go home, which he did. I had a great time with him on Friday night, but needed some space after the hook-up extravaganza. 4) We all crashed at Pauls place on Saturday night and ended up passing out at 5am. Each one of us was up by 11am the next morning with a Bellini (champagne and orange juice) in hand. We drank the biggest bottle of champagne I have ever seen in my life and headed out to the parade. The old hangover cure of having some of The hair of the dog that bit you is totally true. I can attest to it first hand. 5) I finally saw A Beautiful Mind and loved it. Russel Crowe, although not my most favorite actor in the world, is truly brilliant. Jennifer Connelly was excellent too, but should she be allowed to win an OSCAR for that part? Does she even get NOMINATED for that part? I thought she was VERY VERY good. Dont get me wrong. But the part was rather weak for an OSCAR nomination. Then again, what do I know? I just got into the first play of my NYC career. Snores McSnorsersons. 6) I got my first letter from Baghdad! My brother finally got a note out to me and it made my day. 7) Saw two of my favorite Gay Bodybuilders at the parade. They were HOTTTTTT, cept kind of femmy. Now I dont think I can masturbate to them anymore. The faade was totally ruined. At first I was like OMG! Look who it is! urlLink Caesar and urlLink Tom Katt ! But after they flexed their huge bodies for all of the adoring fans, they proceeded to skip and prance around the float they were supposed to be posing on. My jaw hit the pavement and I looked away in disgust and embarrassment. Dont be BIG and HOTT and then go be BIG and fag. Thats just not appealing at all. 8) We came up with so many new saying and jokes during the weekend. Despite a few arguments and bouts of tears, the group managed to stick together and laugh throughout all of it. When you have so many different personalities working towards a common goal (Gay Pride), there will, of course, end up being some disagreements. Yet, I was pleasantly surprised to see that everyone got along. The one thing that I will carry away from this whole experience is that we all laughed and laughed and laughed. So much laughing that my vagina is aching today. I cant believe the entire thing is over now. So much anticipation and so worth it. But now we have to wait a whole year in order to do it up again. We all commented on how there should be Gay Pride at least 5 times a year. None of us like the idea of the city only turning uber friendly towards gay people during one weekend of the year. As the parade ended and we finished up our beers and burgers, we were all very sad to say goodbye to the freedom and the fun that we were collectively a part of. While saying goodbye to each other, we hugged a little bit longer than usual. But I will see you this week for my birthday party!, I called out. But its not the same. We wont get to do this whole gay weekend again until next year, Mariah said. Yeah. Yeah, I know, I admitted. The fantasy world ended and Kelly and I boarded the subway for home. Tonight I am going over to Ahmads after work. He is making me dinner and a cake and giving me my birthday present. I have NO idea what it is, but I was given this clue: My gift is not extravagant (NUTS!), but it is something that will show you how good of a listener I am. And I know for a fact that you will love it, He says. Thats a lot of pressure you are putting on yourself. I reply. Im confident that you will love it. He says back. So we will see! I am nervous and curious and hmmmmmmmm.I dont know. We will NOT be hooking up tonight. I need to slow us down a bit again. He told Mariah on Friday that Joe is a good boy and I am willing to wait as long as he needs for him to be able to open his heart to me. Mariah immediately reported this information back to me, along with some other comments that warmed my heart, but made my nerves shatter at the same time. What ever happened to just Playing it by ear or Taking everything one day at a time? The kid has some serious feelings for me. I have serious feelings for pizza. You understand. Thank God this Monday is almost over. Two more days until I am @^! Oops. I meant 26!

 Well, it's officially Gay Pride Weekend and I have started it out in a foul mood. Last night was ok. Nothing special. I didn't end up going out to the Meow Mix, with the rest of the girls, cuz I was having a day of hating lesbians. It's a little overbearing to hang out with a group of 8 girls, all of whom want to go to every lesbian bar in the city. I wish we had some gay guys in our group. And by gay guys, I mean gay friends. Not the variety of boys I have been known to date at times. I have been such a bitch to everyone I have talked to this morning. I am having one of those days where I take out my mood on everyone else and it's not fair. I have to go home and take a nap and get ready for a weekend of fun. It's going to be whatever I make of it and I must make it a good time. I think I just need some rest. I surprised Paul by staying over at his house last night. It broke my heart to see how happy he was to have me waiting there for him. But the guilt I felt inside, knowing that I was seeing Ahmad tonight, made me act all weird and detached. Paul wants only me. And I don't know what I want. I want Paul, the way he is right now, but how do I know that he won't revert back to his old ways? As he fell asleep last night, I lay staring at him for a long time. He looked so beautiful laying there. He looked so real. I thought for a moment "I know him better than I know anyone else on the planet. He is the most real person I have in my life". Then I got increasingly more upset that behind his back I am still dating Ahmad. He doesn't deserve that. Not when he loves me so much. I need to get my mood in gear and enjoy this gay pride to the fullest. It's my first one in NYC. I have tons of plans, including: house parties, bar hopping, a kegger on Chelsea Piers and the big ass parade on Sunday. There is no reason why I should feel the way I do right now. It's not the gay events or the lesbians that is really bothering me. It's the confusion, guilt, and anger I feel towards myself over the whole Ahmad/Paul situation. As often as I say that I just want to live my life for me and to do what I want to do, deep down it is a very difficult issue for me to deal with. I am always upset because I feel as though I am hurting other people by living my own life. Congrats to my fellow gays on the Supreme Court's Ruling Against the Ban on Gay Sex! It is a victory that I know a lot of you have been hoping and praying for. Here's to our equality! And to a beautiful, pride-filled, weekend.

 Guess whos famous? MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! Me. This morning I gave an interview to the Daily News about being a twentysomething Manhattanite that finds a way to survive living a life without a cell phone. My friend, Joanna, was interviewed yesterday and she gave my name to the columnist and I was contacted this morning for the interview. It was SO much fun. She asked me numerous questions and my opinion on cell phone usage in todays society. When I get nervous, I speak fast and throw way too much information into the conversation. I hope she doesnt cut and paste things I said in a manner that would make me humiliated. I can just imagine the article coming out and it saying: Joe CuttheShit believes that cell phones are impersonal and straight from the depths of hell. He believes that if you (sic) use a cell phone, you should go to hell too. Hellbound fuckersI like cheese a lot. The interviewer said that she might even take a picture of Joanna and I and put that in the paper next to the article! YAY! How fun! I will make a hundred copies and mail it out to anyone who wants one. Or you could just look at it online. OH! One more funny thingthe interviewer lady person asked me what my girlfriend thought of me not having a cell phone and I was like DOH(!), girlfriend?!?! So, I said Yes, I have a girlfriend and shes cool with it, blah blah blah. Oh, how long have you been together?, she asked next. For about 3 and a half years, but now Im dating a Muslim and he has a really good body. OOPS! Sike. But I did tell her that I had a girlfriend. All I could think about was that if I told her I was gay, it would eventually come back and bite me in the ass in the future. So I lied about my sexuality. Which I HATE HATE HATE to do. Whatever. I need a publicist ASAP. Last nights auditions were AMAAAAAAAAAAAAZING. Holy shit was it so much fun. We auditioned about 11 or 12 guys and out of all of them, two were great! Megan decided to have call backs next Tuesday, so that we can see the guy, Brad, from Tuesday night, alongside the other two boys from last night. I have a personal favorite that I hope gets the part. Brad was excellent, but after seeing this guy, Ian, I immediately realized so much more about my character than I had previously. Ian embodies the role of Jim. But I am not the director and I am confident that Megan will make the right choice. Brad was too pretty to be Jim, I think. Ian has this inherently masculine, confident, aggressive nature that seemed to work wonderfully. Plus, he was one of the only two that read the play before the audition. A total MUST for any aspiring auditioner. I got home around 9:30pm and was up until about 2am running the lines in my bed. The fire in my belly was pulsing with the passion of a thousand actors. It was such an invigorating feeling! I couldnt stop running the scenes over and over. Trying out new ways to say the lines and inventing different circumstances for my character. It was SO fun and all consuming. Welcome back to acting Joe! YAYAYAYAYAYAYAY! Yet, I am pretty tired today from staying up all night playing around. I gotta try to keep my passion a little bit under control or I am going to end up being a gay zombie. And gay zombies have been known to eat brains. And I dont mean brains from your headI mean brains like your bag of balls. crunch slop gulp. Tonight I am off to the Cubby Hole for happy hour and then MAYBE over to the local dyke bar for a few drinks and dancing. I am doing my best to bail out on the lesbian nonsense, but I dont know if I will be able to. My friends seem to love having me stand there fending for myself. And every time I go, I get into a fight with one angry dyke or another. No lezzies seem to like cute and harmless gay boys. (okay, maybe not so harmless.) (but definitely cute, right?) So far Ihavent been able to find many fun things to do for PRIDE weekend, despite getting trashed at the clubs. I was hoping that there would be a gay boat cruise or a gay picnic or even a gay man lazar tag. But it seems to me that the only genre of people that do events like that are lesbians. And lesbians are mean. Ok, sorry. I digress. Lesbians are not the devil. I dont want any of my lesbionic readers to think that I hate them. I am just tired of not being included in their little events. And I am VERY tired of getting into confrontations with them every time I step into one of their bars. Gay men very rarely treat women like this. So why the double standard? Oh! And I found out something totally weird! Turns out that lesbians consider fingering a girl more personal than eating a girl out. TWAT? I was SURE it was the other way around. But no. All of my lesbians say that eating a girl is like nothing. But fingering is like fucking. Interesting. I learn something new every day about those vagina eaters. Ah wellin any caseI am very excited to spend Pride weekend with my girl friends. I just wish there was a place that we could all go where everyone felt comfortable. One would think that gay people had a natural kinship with each other, but its just not true. Boh well. Happy Thursday my gaylords!

 Theres just so much. No introduction to my post today. Last night was such an insane evening that I must immediately jump in and try to explain why every time I go out with my group of friends, drama follows us and slaps us in the face. First offthe audition. Last night, Kelly and Megan (Co-Founders of the Theater Company that is putting on Stupid Kids ) and I met up with this kid named Brad to audition him for the part of Jim. You get all that? So many names. The real auditions for the part of Jim happen tonight, but Brad couldnt come so we met him last night just in case he was right for the part. And thank God we did! Cuz, umhe is PERFECT for the part. First off, the part of Jim has to be played by a very masculine, Rebel Without a Cause type of guy. He must also be comfortable with homosexual kissing. During last nights audition, Brad and I had chemistry that blew everyone away. His acting was top notch and his sex appeal was off the charts. He has blond hair, steel blue eyes, and a ripped body. He is taller than me and manjust looks SO good. Guys with lean, muscular bodies do not turn me on, usually. I go for BIG and BEEFY. But Brad has so much charisma and appeal that I know I speak for both Kelly and Megan when I say that we all wanted to drink his cum. Once we had finished, the three of us went to have a drink at a nearby bar. We were all FLOORED by the amount of talent this kid has, combined with the chemistry that he and I had during our reading. It was a bit overwhelming. Tonight, we audition 10-15 more guys, but I know we all breathe a little easier knowing that if none of them work out, Brad is a shoo in for the part. He is currently doing an off-Broadway show and just finished shooting a film on Sunday. Impressive, but intimidating. I left Kelly and Megan at the bar and went over to Pauls place to get ready to go out. However, the whole audition experience left me a bit shaken. I felt emotions that I havent felt in 3 years. The passion in my gut for performance was lit up. I started to realize that being an actor is who I am. And for the last 3 years I have been doing everything in my power to run away from that. I started to cry. Kelly arrived at Pauls apartment an hour later and I immediately pulled her into the bathroom for a quick talk. I told her of my fears and doubts of becoming an actor again. I told her that I felt as though my world was turning upside down and that for the first time in my life, I was truly SCARED. You see, I am a good actor. I know it. I feel real emotions when I say the lines. I BELIEVE in what is happening in the scene as though it were real life. Its a lot to be confronted with after such a long hiatus. Kelly hugged me and told me that she understood and that she will be with me throughout the entire process. But for the rest of the night, I was off. I was confronted with my old life and while part of me wanted to run away from it, part of me wanted to grasp onto it for dear life. I dont want to be Joe CuttheShit pseudo-actor, man-eater, smoker/boozer. I want to be Joe CuttheShit focused actor, hard worker, honest soul. Anysnoodle, we all arrived at Beige/B-Bar/Bowery Bar, etc. at 10pm. Tons of different names for the same place. Joining me in my first Gay Pride outing was Paul, Kelly, Mariah, and Pauls roommate Jen. B-Bar has a patio in the back that allows smoking, so we immediately started walking back to that area. As we rounded the front bar, I bumped my arm into one of the waiters arms. He turned around and dropped one of the drinks he was carrying onto the floor. Somehow, he thought that Kelly did it. He looked her in the face and then launched the other drink on his tray right into her face. It landed on her toes and then smashed all over the floor. We were SHOCKED. Suddenly there was an uproar. Mariah, Paul, and I all started freaking out. What the FUCK do you think you are doing? You dont THROW drinks at customers! Are you fucked up in the head?!?! It was crazy, chaotic, and rather exciting. A manager ran over, talked to Kelly about what happened and then told the waiter to go upstairs and change his clothes. We are pretty sure he was fired. The manager then gave Kelly 7 free drink tickets and apologized profusely. Kelly handled it all with style and grace. But Mariah and Paul were furious for a long while after. The whole situation was really fucked up and I just stood there saying Why is it that EVERY time we go out, something completely out of control happens?!?! We downed some vodka tonics and talked our faces off. Paul was absolutely adorable. I bought him a rose and he about burst into tears with sheer joy. As Mariah and I were taking a trip to the bathroom, this is the conversation we had: Mariah: Paul is so in love with you. He was just telling me how he is so glad that you are giving him a second chance. Joe: Mariah, I dont think I want to be with Paul anymore. Mariah: What do you mean? You just gave him a rose! He is really trying hard to be the boyfriend you want him to be. Joe: I know I keep saying that if he just changes his ways, our relationship will be so much better, but the truth of the matter is that I dont know if I want a boyfriend at all anymore. Its not Pauls fault. At this stage in my life, I think I just want to be single and free. Independent and able to do what I want. Mariah: What about Ahmad? Joe: Ahmad is a great guy too, but I dont want a relationship with him. I want to kiss and date and talk to lots of boys. I have never really had the opportunity to do that freely and I think now is the time. Mariah totally understood where I was coming from, but it was hard for both of us to watch Paul work overtime trying to make me happy. Fortunately, that didnt last too long as Paul and I got in a screaming match at Rays Pizza and I left to go back to his apartment alone. I remember calling him ugly and reminding him that the friends that we went out with were my friends and not his. It was a terrible scene and my acid tongue got the best of me again. Paul was a dickhead back, but he is never as cruel as I can be. I arrived at Pauls apartment before Mariah, Kelly and Paul did. When I got to his pad, I had another glass of wine and hung out with Jen and Lisa. Eventually the rest of the group showed up and we smoked and laughed and had a good time. It was as though the whole Rays Pizza confrontation never happened. Everyone got ready to go to sleep at 2am. Paul was already passed out in his bed. Without saying goodbye to him, I packed up my shit and went home. It wasnt that Paul had done anything wrong. In fact the only person that had a big fat mean mouth last night, was me. I am in a place of confusion right now and I find myself doing and saying things that seem so out of character for me. Yet, I do them because I feel as though I need to start trusting my instincts a bit more. I have to allow myself to grow and change and make mistakes. If leaving Pauls place at 2am without saying goodbye is what I needed to do, then that is what I needed to do. If I was unnecessarily mean to him, then I was unnecessarily mean to him. I am not saying it was appropriate at all. But if thats how I felt in the moment, then I resolve to be confident in my decisions. I am so hard on myself every day for stupid shit and its time I started LIVING. People fuck up all the time and I want to stop criticizing and watching my every move. As I have said over and over for the last couple of entries, I need to focus on me and stop worrying what everyone else in my life is going to think about it. I have a great group of friends. Its time I started trusting in them. Tonight is the big audition! Hoping it goes as well as last night. Wow. Look at me acting again! Baby steps. Baby steps all the way to fame.

 HAPPY GAY PRIDE WEEK! YAY! This is one of my most favorite weeks of the year. Its like the one time when you can truly be proud to be a gay and also get away with drinking yourself into an oblivion every night. And all in the name of gayness! ROCK. Tonight I am off to Beige, one of the citys gay hot spots for a Tuesday night. Also, they have a patio in the back where you are allowed to smoke cigarettes. That is like unheard of these days. So, tonight around 11pm, picture me kicking back with my fellow Homos, toasting to a week of cruising, drinking, and full out debauchery. Slurp it up baby! SLURP-IT-UP! This weekend with my parents was fucking fantastic. We laughed so hard and so often. They were overly generous with my birthday gifts, as usual. I mean, I know Im going to be 26 and all, but I love opening my presents as though I just turned 8. I think they also get a kick out of seeing me revert back to my childhood, when everything I said was Just what I always wanted or Oh cool! Can I play with it now? The weekend flew by and I was pretty sad to have to say goodbye to them on Sunday. If I could have had the birthday present of my dreams, it would be for them to live much closer. I still look forward to the day when my entire family can get together every Sunday for a big family meal. But until Winfield comes back to the states, there is no chance of that happening. We did talk about him a lot this weekend and for the most part, it was very positive. Only a few tears were shed. And they were cleansing, good tears. It was really nice to be with two people who know what it truly feels like to have Winfield away. As much as my friends are there for me, its impossible for them to fully understand how I feel. But with my parents, they get it. I dont have to say anything about the situation as its always on all of our minds. And if you need a hug, you dont have to ask for one. There are arms around you before you even get the chance to let the first tear fall. In total, it was a beautiful weekend with them. So..we may have a bit of a problem. Ahmad has returned from his conference. While he was gone, Paul and I had a really great week together. He is being extra adorable and putting in overtime when it comes to our relationship. We arent fighting nearly as much and when he senses that I am upset, he immediately works on correcting the situation. He has gotten more time off from work so that we can spend time together and he doesnt act as careless with my feelings as he used to. I am floored at the change in his attitude. And mostly, I am happy being with him. But As I said, Ahmad has returned home. He had a great conference and came back ready to continue where we left off. When he e-mailed me yesterday morning, my stomach immediately clenched in worry and dread. I had forgotten how close he and I got before he left. Now, granted, he was only gone for 10 days, but in that amount of time, I have been known to have full blown relationships and moved on to my next conquest. Unfortunately for Ahmad, the relationship I had in the last 10 days was with my boyfriend. The one I have been with for 3 and a half years. The one that I am still in love with. Right before Ahmad left, we had the following conversation: Ahmad: Joe, I want to bring something up to you. Joe: Sure. Whats up? Ahmad: Sometimes when I am with you, I feel as though I am the other guy and I dont know how comfortable I am with that. Joe: You feel that way because you ARE the other guy. There is nothing more I can say about it. Ahmad: Am I always going to be the other guy? Joe: As of right now, yes. Who knows about the future. Ahmad: Do you not want to talk about it anymore? Joe: Not especially. Ahmad: Then we wont. After having this quick dialogue, I could tell that he was a bit upset. But there is nothing I can do about that. I cant give him any false hope that he and I are going to jump into a relationship. I still want Paul. And even more than I want Paul, I want to be single and independent. Most people take months or years to bounce back into their single life. I feel like I have been bouncing back into it slowly for the last year. The last thing I want to do is have a relationship with ANYONE else. Ahmad included. Sure, time can change that, but for now, I am putting the focus back on myself. Paul can come along for the ride, but no one else. At (almost) 26 years old, its about time to put the focus back on me. When Ahmad and I spoke on the phone today, he asked me what we would be doing together for Gay Pride Week. I explained to him that I am already booked up for the most part, but I could fit him in somewhere this weekend. My biggest fear is that he is going to show up at one of the bars I am at. This is my fear, because most likely, Paul will be accompanying me wherever I go. At least until Friday night. Then he has to work all weekend. I told Ahmad where I was going out tonight and IMAGINE if he shows up there while I am with Paul? I will probably have a heart attack while spewing vomit out of my mouth and diarrhea out of my ass. Im in no way ready for THAT confrontation. Plus, in some ways, I want neither of them to go out with my friends and me. I would LOVE to meet a new guy tonight. As we all know, I am in the midst of a game called Sluts or Bust and I am not getting many points hanging out with these two bwahs. Tonights bar should definitely net me some hotties. But not if my ballS and chainS show up. ManI am a pathetic, selfish, asshole. And I love it. Ahmad got me presents while he was in Vegas. He had mentioned to me that he was going to try to get me a robe from the Ritz Carlton (where he was staying). When he told me how much one of those robes cost, I told him to NEVER EVER spend that kind of money on me. (knot in my stomach) I think he still got it for me. As much as I am excited to see what he is going to get me for my birthday, (knot in stomach) I wont accept anything too extravagant. Cuz then I would feel as though I owe him something. And I aint owing anyone shit just because I am cute, adorable, and fun. Right? Right. Wish me luck, my people! One more word about the donation thing THANK YOU to everyone who sent us a payment. You MADE my day yesterday. And are totally helping us reach our goals. We will be taking donations until the first weekend of October, so dont worry that it will ever be too late for you to send us a gift. Howeverpleaseand I mean PLEASEunderstand that no one in any way should feel guilted or obligated into giving us a dime. I am given so much love from this journal daily and I appreciate that more than anything. I just figured that, while I have the outlet available to me, I might as well try and take advantage of it. Right? Sassy sends mugs, Eelnahs sends CDs, Joe begs you for your money. It really is a nice system we got goin. I just appreciate all of your love and support so much. The donation thing was just a long shot. And of course I will keep everyone posted as to how it all goes! The auditions are tomorrow night! YAY and also HORK! (a bit nervous) Enjoy the sun! And if its raining where you live, you probably deserve it. Its been raining in NYC for weeks. YAY GAY PRIDE!

 We interrupt the regular scheduled blog posts, to bring you something of the utmost importance(!): During the first two weeks of October, Joe CuttheShit will be performing in his first show EVER in NYC. The show is called "Stupid Kids" and will be done by the theater company owned and operated by my housemate Kelly. Considering that this is a new theater company, they have to do massive amounts of fund raising in order to rent a space, pay for royalties, pay for lights, pay for music, pay pay pay. There is so much paying it makes my heads spin. (heads meaning my big head and my little head Big Joe and little joe) We have already written a fund raising letter that is currently being mailed out to everyone we know. The letter details the mission statement of the company, the process that took them through their first production, and it also promotes the upcoming shows. And I must say, it is PRETTY classy. Keep in mind that this company put on a production at the end of April that was a smashing success. We are hoping that this next show will outdo the first one by leaps and bounds. As Kelly and her partner gain more experience, the shows will blossom into even more extravagant pieces of theater. This time, I will be helping them out as much as I can. My focus is on the show and on the company. I want us to be able to put up an excellent work of art. And I am confident that we will. SO On the right hand side of my page, there is a Make A Donation button. Yes (load groan), this post is soliciting you for money. Please understand that I would NEVER EVER ask anyone for anything unless I felt that it was a worthy cause and also impossible for us to achieve our goals without it. The royalties alone cost $360 ($60 per performance). This is just one of the many costs we will encounter over the next couple of months. I came up with the idea of placing a PayPal button (It is the safest and easiest way to donate money on the net!) on my site in the hopes that we would raise (even) a measly $20 from it. Now, I understand that everyone is strapped for cash and I understand that most of you have never met me in person. So why would I think that I deserve any of your money? Well, frankly, I dont. And part of me thinks its rude to ask. However, theater is my passion and hopefully my inevitable career. You would not only be supporting the company, you would be supporting my dream. Any amount of money is GRACIOUSLY accepted. That means if you donate $1.50, I would jizz all over myself in excitement. If you donate $550, welldont. I would drown in the amount of jizz that would come out of my cock and balls. I dont have much to offer you as a thank you for donating your hard-earned money to this endeavor, but I can promise you that if you donate over $10, I will put your name in our program as a PATRON OF THE ARTS. And I will even mail you a copy of the program so you can hold onto it as evidence that you are a caring and supportive person. And most importantly, you will take some of the worry and stress away from planning this whole process and replace it with happiness, love, and excitement. Please understand that you dont have to donate a single cent. Please understand that no amount is too low. And most importantly, please understand that I would never ask for anything I wasnt desperate for. Its not like this site is urlLink Save Karen and Im asking you to bail me out of my over-spending immaturity. Although maybe I will do that during my next post. (snicker, snicker) No donation is small enough. If you are offended at all by me coming onto my site and becoming a beggar, please know that this is the only time I will ever do something like this. Its just very important that we get this show off the ground. Not only for the company, but for me. This show is the platform I need to jump start my career. Thank you to everyone for reading this. Youve already done a lot by sitting through this whole thing. BLING BLING dawgs! (ok, never bling bling) Adios.

 So, I've spent the majority of the morning thinking that urlLink Cati Fabulous was hurt by me. I would never intentionally hurt any of you bloggers. I don't even know most of you, so I can't see how hurting you is even possible. But when I thought that she was upset with me, I wrote this whole sad, introduction to my post today. Then I had to go back and fix it, cuz she swears that it's not me that hurt her feelings. Can I just tell you how relieved I feel now? The pit that was resting like a rock of despair in my stomach has finally eased up. And phew. I take things so personally sometimes, it's scary. Ive been known to have a bad temper. Actually, it doesnt flare up very often, but when it does, it consumes me in a way that I am totally embarrassed and uncomfortable with. Last night for instance, Paul and I had plans to go to a nice dinner. We hadnt been out to dinner in over a week and I was really excited to sit and have a nice, quiet meal. He and I arrived at the restaurant at around 8pm and Mariah joined us for a bit, but had to leave by 9pm due to a rehearsal for an upcoming show. Its very rare for Paul, Mariah, and I to have any time for just the three of us and I cherish those moments greatly. While ordering the appetizers, the three of us got into a discussion about how important it is to spend some personal time with the people that you love. At that moment, Pauls roommates, Jen and Lisa, were walking by the restaurant and Paul got up to go say hi to them. (Keep in mind that we hang out with Jen and Lisa ALL the time, cuz they are constantly at his apartment) I say to Paul as he is leaving to talk to the girls, Please dont bring them in here. The three of us are doing our own thing tonight. Paul nods his head and leaves. Five minutes later, Paul enters back into the restaurant with Jen and Lisa in tow. Mariah pinches my leg, cuz we had JUST had the conversation about how it was nice that the three of us were having a mealjust the three of us. As they are all taking their seats at our table, the fury of the INCREDIBLE HULK, fills me and instead of busting out of my clothes into a mass of green muscle, I kick Pauls chair HARD from underneath the table. In fact, I kicked it so hard that the glasses and silverware made this upsettingly loud clinking noise and I realized that I had exposed my anger to everyone at the table. Paul handled it very well and didnt make a comment about what I had just done. I sat there, frustrated at him for bringing them into the restaurant and frustrated at myself for getting so irrationally worked up about it. Within 10 minutes or so I had squashed the fury and we all had a good time. As Paul and I were walking home later on in the evening, he grabbed my arm and apologized for what he had done. By that point, I had realized that I had gotten angry over something very stupid. I explained to him that I was confused as to why he brought them in and that I was also sorry for kicking his chair so violently under the table. He kissed me on the cheek and told me that It was okay. But in my mind, it wasnt. I try not to screw up often and when I do, I carry it with me for a long time. I just hate making myself look like a psycho. So whatever, it was over and done with and no one was any the wiser. But it reminded me that I still have work to do on controlling my reaction to things that I dont like. Trust me, I have come a long way in curbing my acid laced tongue. No one is perfect and I have to understand that I have made some progress. But it sucks to know that I still have more progress to make. BUT WHY DID HE BRING JEN AND LISA BACK IN WITH HIM?!?! Just cuz. Thats why. Just cuz. argh. ErI meanyay! Barf. I guess thats all I have to say today. I am excited to go home. I am excited to get out of the city for a couple of days. I am excited to just get away. Next week is GAY PRIDE and we have so many plans for it that I think I will fall into a homo-induced coma by the time next Sunday rolls around. Hope everyone has a nice weekend. Drink too much, eat too much, stay up late, and be thankful for the friends you have.

 ***Also...concerning my post from yesterday...why does my comment section say "one comment" when there is CLEARLY more than one comment listed? Grrrrr...the Klink family must want me to klink them in their vaginas.

 We will begin with the disturbing dream that I had last night. (Ritayou may want to avoid the beginning part of this entry as it will be all too familiar for you) (No, seriously) and (Kelly, another horrifying dream about the cats) In the dream, Paul and I are hanging out at my apartment in Times Square. I remember the TV being on and that we were sitting on my bed. We had been commissioned to watch over Kellys cat, Trey, and our friend Angies cat, Alex. Paul and I were goofing off when all of a sudden we heard a loud crash come from out in the living room. I jump up and run out to the living room to find Alex laying on the ground with his body all twisted and mangled. Trey, was sitting next to him and crying. There were little cat tears coming out of his eyes. I run over to Alex and see that he can barely lift his head. It looks to me like his spine is broken. Paul comes running out of the bedroom behind me and gasps when he sees Alex. Trey starts to pace around Alex and he licks him on the face. Alex just turns his head from side to side, whimpering. Paul says: What happened?? Joe: I dont know. I think he fell off the fridge or something. It looks like his back is broken. Is he going to die? Paul: I think so, Joe. But probably slow and painful. Joe: Should we take him to the hospital? Should I call an ambulance or something? Paul: Joe, its too late. He would die before we got him to the hospital. Joe: Then what do we do?? I cant stand to see him suffering like this. Paul: Ill take care of it. You go back in the bedroom. Joe: No. I will stay here with you. Trey is crying and he needs me. Paul: Fine. But turn your head. Paul goes to the bedroom and returns with a baseball bat. Joe: What are you going to do?!? Paul: I have to end his suffering. I told you to walk away. Joe: I cant! I cant leave him! Paul: Its your choice. And with that, Paul raises the bat in the air and brings it down right on top of Alexs skull. Brains and blood splatter all over the walls and on to Treys face. Trey starts to cry even harder and it sounds like the voice of a baby. I fall to my knees next to Alexs smooshed head. Paul returns to the bedroom with the baseball bat. Trey walks over to the couch and begins to lick off the brains and blood from his fur. I start to cry while sitting there looking at dead Alex. END DREAM. I woke up to my alarm and Paul asking Whats wrong? Youve been thrashing about on the bed all night. I told him about my dream and he said SNORE. (Damn me for ever teaching him that word) He scratched my back while I had my first cigarette of the morning and I tried my best to get the image of Alexs smooshed head out of my mind. Overall I feel much better today. I spent last night hanging out with Kelly and puttering around in my apartment. Paul came over around 11:30pm and brought me french fries from McDonalds. They were really good and gave me an exceptional shit this morning. He was so adorable last night and I realized (once again) that I love him dearly. I want only him. I have to break up with Ahmad again . Somebody slap me in the nuts please. One day I want one thing and the next I want something different. Ah well. Im sure Ahmad will give me a super nice birthday present, so I will keep him around long enough for that. Sike! And if you thought I was serious, then you dont know me at all. Gold digging is so pase. Very excited to go home this weekend. My parents and I are celebrating Fathers Day and my birthday all in one! Friday night we will play cards and drink and smoke pot, as per our usual Friday night plan. Saturday we will go out to dinner at an all you can eat buffet. (NYC doesnt have those and I LOVE them) (Whos up for a plate filled with french fries piled to the ceiling?) After dinner we are off to the harness track to drink some beers and bet on horses. Back in the day I used to be the biggest advocate for animal rights and wouldnt have imagined EVER supporting an equestrian track. Now that Im older, I love drinking beer and hanging out with my parents too much to give a damn about the horses feelings. Sure its tough to be whipped all day and to run around a dirt track. But do they ever have to deal with being called a fag? I think not. Faggot horses. I am totally saying that to their faces when I see them on Saturday. Auditions for the show I am doing are next Wednesday. Remember that the show is called urlLink Stupid Kids (brief synapsis at this link) . Kelly and I are playing Kimberly and Neechee respectively. We still have to cast the role of Jim. This is a big deal on so many levels. Most importantly for me, its the guy I have to make out with in the show. So, of course, I hope he is motha fuckin hotttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt! Hot with 37 Ts. My part in the show is that of a little, flaming, gothic, emotionally tormented, 17 year old boy. The part of Jim is a rebel, overly masculine, macho, ego driven, 17 year old MAN. My character falls in love with him and wants to form some sort of a love-based relationship. Jim aint havin it. Cuz hes a straight. Or IS he? Thats the beauty of the play. And I get to tongue him on stage. Amazing. My parents and friends of my family will have a heart attack. But that makes me want to do it so much more. SHOCK VALUE. Guess what everyone? Not only is Joe a homosexualhe kisses and humps boys on stage too! What TALENT he possesses. Rock. Alrightoff to my daily nap. Gonna grab a bite to eat, shit it out in 10 minutes and go lay down for a nice summers catnap. Snore me a river.

 My brother called me at work this morning. Its been over a month since I last heard his voice and I was overwhelmed to hear it today. He called me a couple of weeks ago at 6am at my apartment, but I had spent the night at Ahmads and unfortunately missed that call. Every day when I walk into my apartment and see the answering machine light blinking, I get a tinge of worry that he has called and for whatever reason, I have missed it. But today, I got to talk to him. He was calling from a satellite phone somewhere inside of Baghdad. Knowing that I only have a few short moments to talk to him, I tried to ask as many questions as I could, questions that I know my parents would want the answers to. He only had 10 minutes to be on the phone with me and for most of it, the reception cut out and I couldnt hear what he was saying. There is also a major delay on everything that I say to him so he has to pause in the conversation to wait for my response. It is frustrating and exciting and upsetting all at the same time. In the last four months my brother has lost 22 pounds. He entered Baghdad weighing 173 and currently he is at 141. His skin is pasty white, but his hands are the darkest tan he has ever had! He is both physically and mentally exhausted. When I asked him how things were going with his men, he said, Weve lost a few in combat. But Im still okay Joe. No need to worry. No need to worry? People are dying around you and Im not supposed to be freaking out? I maintained as much composure as I could. I tried to be upbeat and I tried to sound as though everything with my life is fine. And comparatively, it is. As our conversation came to a close, something inside of me broke free. The tears started flowing out of my face as I realized that I wouldnt be talking to him again for a while. He says he will try to call me on my birthday, but you never know. As I started crying, so did he and he kept saying over and over Ill be home soon. Be happy. I love you so much. Everything is fine. My sobs began to take over and it took every ounce of strength in my body to give him an audible I love you too. I hung up the phone and left my office building. I walked up the street and crouched in a doorway to smoke a cigarette. Eventually I was able to get myself under control, but as I type this, I still feel this sadness sitting directly on top of my heart. A huge lump resting in my throat. I have tried so hard to put Winfield out of my mind. My parents have let this thing take over their life and I refuse to do that. I can barely find the energy to get out of bed in the morning, much less sit around thinking about, worrying about, and missing my brother. He is everything to me, but I dont have the emotional courage to focus on it. I have worked so hard to make the last month and a half of my life happy. Then a 10-minute talk with my brother turns my world upside down. Gotta put him out of mind, as much as I hate doing it. Im going to go get a drink of water and smoke another cigarette. Maybe say a prayer for him. Maybe shed one more tear in order to feel the release of all of this pent up sadness.

 Its funny. When you work at a University job, the summers are filled with mindless projects and hours of utter boredom. So, in order to occupy my time, I have decided to find myself a urlLink Prison Pen Pal . urlLink Kambri Crews had the link on her site yesterday and I decided that that was just about the best idea ever. So for the last two hours I have contacted my favorite prisoners and let them know that I want to be their friend. Upon telling my mom about my new venture, she said, Why dont you take that time to write to your brother in Iraq. I replied Nah. The two guys I picked as my pen pals are buff and HOT. One of them is bisexual and the other is straight. One is in jail for robbery and the other is in jail for homicide. Yesthis was the best idea I have ever had ever. I can only hope that these boys will get out of jail, come find my family and me and brutally murder us all. HOTT! In other newsI began using urlLink Trim Spa today. This product is supposed to increase your metabolism while fighting to decrease fat pockets. The bottle also said that it is an appetite suppressant. So this morning, I took one pill (instead of the recommended 2) and have found myself more ravenous than usual. Maybe its my metabolism speeding up. Or maybe its all in my head and I just spent $40 on horse pills for nothing. HOTT! My birthday is on July 2nd. (I am a die-hard cancer-through and through) I am going to be 26 years old. YIPES. I thought 25 was bad, but 26 is like 30 which is like 50 which is like death in a body. In all honesty, I have yet to truly care about turning another year older. Maybe that anxiety will come in time, but so farI could care less if I am 26 or 57. As long as I always have baby smooth skin on my face and on my ass. And as long as I can always jerk on my penis as though its made of rubber. Hairy rubber. Each year my friends do something amazing for me for my birthday. Up until 2 years ago, I was always thrown a surprise party. Tons of my friends would get together and we would rock out in one way or another. Sometimes it was booze filled, sometimes it was cake and ice cream filled. Okay, it was only cake and ice cream filled before I turned 21. Two years ago, once the parties stopped coming, Kelly and her ex-girlfriend, Angie, in conjunction with Paul, took me to the Crown Plaza Hotel for the night. I snorted lines of coke the entire time and we all had a blast. I have to admit the only part of the night that I wasnt too fond of was the coke. And I have yet to touch the stuff since. urlLink Last year , Kelly and Rita planned the day and we all went to dinner and drinks and opened tons of presents and I even went to a psychic during the day. It was one of the best days that I have had in my entire life. I remember sitting at dinner and saying: I dont even want to drink alcohol! I am having such a good time being sober with all of the people that I love! Mariah was there, Ari was there, Angie, Kelly, and Rita were there, and it was wonderful. But this year is going to be different. Everyone is kinda poor now. And our group of friends has split into so many different directions. Since it is now June 17 and no one has mentioned my birthday to me, I have decided to take the matter into my own hands. It is up to me to plan the celebration. And you know what? Thats okay. For years I havent had to plan my own birthday, so Im due. I decided to work at my job during the day of my birthday. Usually I would take the day off, but I had such a great time being in the office last year that I figured why not do it again? I have off the 3rd and 4th, so no need to take the 2nd as well. Wednesday night, the day of my birthday, I am going to spend the evening with Paul. I am leaving the entire night up to him, which is probably a very risky thing to do. Paul is terrible with planning ANYTHING and I am hoping to high heaven that he doesnt fuck this night up. It means the world to me to be able to spend the night with him. I havent spent a birthday alone with him since the year we first got together. It could be a beautiful night or a terrible night. Its all dependent upon how much he truly cares about me. Thursday I have off from work, so I am hoping that Kelly and Angie and maybe Mariah will plan some fun stuff for us to do during the day. (HINT,HINT GIRLS!) Thursday night I want everyone to meet at my apartment for a few drinks before we hit the town! Im talking going out to some fun gay bars! So probably Splash bar and maybe The Roxy or something. I want us to drink a lot, stay up late, smoke the pot, and have a wonderful time altogether. In my wildest dreams, I want all of us to crash at the same location, whether thats at Mariahs apartment in Brooklyn, a hotel room, or crammed into my tiny apartment in Times Square. On Friday, the 4th of July, I hope that we will all wake up together and have some breakfast while laughing and giggling about the previous nights activities. Some time around 2ish, I hope that all of us will go to a local park to have a picnic. Im talking hamburgers, hot dogs, cheeseburgers, and if Paul is theresome of his famous BBQ ribs. I want to cook and lay out in the sun, drink some beers, and be with the people that I love the most. (cept for Rita, who wont be able to come. But more about that in a sec.) After our picnic is over, I would like our little party to continue to the fireworks. This is the first 4th of July that I have spent in NYC and I am pretty excited about it. I have spent the last two 4ths in Boston with Mariah and Paul. This year, I dont have to leave the city to see themthey are here with me! After the fireworks and a beautiful day together, I hope that we will all slap on some smiles and go back out to the bars. And thats it. Saturday and Sunday of that week will be meant for detoxing and masturbating. Doesnt that sound like fun? Do you think people will want to come to this get together? Its always hard to plan things for my birthday, cuz a lot of people go away for the 4th of July weekend. But I am hoping that people love me enough to stick around this year. Time will tell. The only downfall is that my Rita wont be able to be with us. But she has offered to buy my bus ticket to Syracuse for the following weekend! That way I can finally see her again and be with her in her new home. And it will be just us! Hanging out, talking and laughing and singing and being best friends. If it werent for her offer of a free visit, I would be extremely saddened by her absence at my party. And thats that! Sorry for the very informative, not really entertaining, post today. I had to get all of my ideas about my birthday down on paper so that I can get it straight (ergay) in my head. Invitations will be going out by the end of today. YAY! HOORAY! BOOM BALAY! SNORE McCRAY! ANY OTHER WORD THAT RHYMES WITH A! Thats it! I hope everyone has a nice Tuesday. Two weeks from tomorrow, the extravaganza begins! What are YOU going to get me?

 Your smell intoxicates me, The yellow of your skin, the freckles of your spice The luxury of gripping you in my hands. In moments of sadness you are there In moments of elation you are there An object of desire and dependence. Years have passed; your body has changed, Your flavor and variety Has only grown with age. My children will know you as The father they never knew A life made complete by your inexistence. Lovers will come and go Flitting in and out of my life through fickle hopes Driving me back to your consistent smile. It is only now that I can see The ramifications of loving you too much. The reality of letting you run my life. Pizza, today I say goodbye to you. This Weekend Had an incredible time. So much fun in fact that it was 8pm Sunday night before I realized that the fun was finally over. Went out drinking on both Friday and Saturday nights and was up until 5am each evening. Slept very minimally, as I had to get up and go to brunch on both Saturday and Sunday mornings. Man, it was serious fun. Today my eyes are a bit swollen shut from lack of rest. I plan to catch up on that this week. Ahmad Is away on business until Friday. Since I am going home to Albany this weekend, I will not see him until at least Tuesday of next week. I miss him a tad bit, but definitely needed to get some perspective while he is away on his trip. Got an email from him this morning and he sounded pretty good. I got hard when I read some of what he wrote. Paul Has been pretty exceptional over the last couple of days. It doesnt change how I feel about anything right now, but it was nice to know that he could treat my friends with respect. He hasnt always been so congenial in the past, but Saturday night he was a gem. And last night, he was more than a gem. He was funny, patient, helpful, kind, and more than a boyfriend. He was my man. Kellys, Ex-girlfriend, Angie Had an AMAZING time with her this weekend. Her 6-month trip to Mexico fucked her up a bit. She is slowly acclimating to her old life again and it was good to see that she hasnt lost some of the wonderful things that make up who she is. She is growing and changing as an adult, but I do feel very lucky and proud to be a part of it still. Cheeseburgers Had one for brunch on Saturday, one for dinner on Saturday night, and one for brunch on Sunday. My Shoes Are on their last legs. There is no suspension left in the heel and I am almost embarrassed to be seen tripping all over them. I found a pair at Payless for $20, but decided to wait and buy them this week. Now my right ankle is starting to hurt. If it rains, my foot gets soaked and then makes SQUIT, SQUIT, SQUIT sounds every time I take step. Phlegm Gallons of it resting comfortably inside my throat. $10 The amount of money I had to pay to get into Jeckyll and Hyde (one of the WORST bars in Manhattan) because the hostess refused to believe that I am a homosexual. Amaryllis Bought one for Paul yesterday as a Thank you for his generosity when taking out my friends on Saturday night. 463 The amount of drinks I had this weekend. 3,249 The amount of cigarettes I smoked. 4 The number of joints I took part in. All of them The number of joints that I took part in that were rolled from my pot. Not Another Teen Movie Saw it again last night and decided that I MUST own it. So funny. SEW SEW SEW funny. Rachel Told her roommate, (and one of my best friends) Mariah, that she was fat and ugly and that she Wouldnt be caught dead with Mariah if she didnt change the outfit she had on for the Spooky Ooky Pub Crawl . Rachel was SO mean and cruel to Mariah that despite a very determined effort on her part, Mariah ended up bursting into tears in front of the entire group. Then I started to cry, because I cant STAND seeing Mariah cry. Then Rachel got angry that we were both crying and took off her costume and refused to go out with us. After an hour of coaxing and 10 minutes of me begging and pleading with her, Rachel agreed to go out. Of course, an hour into the evening, Rachel threw a HUGE temper tantrum and refused to drink or dance or talk to any of us. She sat in the corner for the rest of the night. Must I say it again? I fucking hate that bitch. So, my birthday is coming!! WOOO HOOOOO! Will definitely get into that topic tomorrow. So much planning to do and so much fun to be had. I have already planned out the entire thing in my head, minute by minute. Tune in tomorrow for the great and exciting details. Have a fast fucking Monday!

 boodnight.

 i don't really hate myself.

 that was a joke.

 i hate myself.

 I just re-read that post in my typical anal style and thought: Please Joe don't write when you're wasted anymore. Please Joe? Please? You make no sense and your mind wanders please? Member about please? You said one time you would do it please? Please goes very well with carrots. Cuz pweas and carrots. For a long time I please fucking please PLEASE Did you say please? please. Yeah man. Please. ***I call this "Waiting for Gadoot". I mean...is there a reason to get it? I mean...is there? (I run away now)

 HOLY SHIT WOW! Joe is posting during the weekend! It is late late late on Friday night and I am way way wasted. So many drinks, so many conversations, so many snores. Which leads me to the reason I stop into this journal tonight. I always check my site. We all do. Right? I mean, we do. You click on it, you check your comments, you get in those modes where you stop by your sitemeter account every 10 minutes. I mean we all do it and I am the first to tell you that I never have. Cept I always do. Tonight when I came home and happened to GLANCE by my site...I was a little shaken up. You people care. You do. And you know me. I've never met (almost) any of you and the things you write to me are so in tune and on point. It blows my mind. I have two types of readers. I have those who leave comments, the way you all do (the people I am writing this post to). And I have those that for the most part, have been with me from the beginning, but never make their voice known except through emails. I cherish both aspects. So much so. The point of all of this is ...er...this: (this this and this) You all made me feel really great about myself tonight. You made me feel important. I am gushing and it's unsightly for a woman to do that...but...well...(boner sticking out)...I love you all. T-bone signs "Latas" and "Snores" on my site and I smile HUGELY. April comes by my site and leaves a comment that is different than any I've gotten from her so far. I feel like I know her a little bit more by reading her site in depthly over the last week. And I love it. April...thank you for laying it out there. It's brave and it's rare. Good for you. And thank you for including us in your recent loss. It rings true with me. Rose, Tina, Keol, Meegan, Daisy, Ahmad's Cheerleading section...you understand. I mean....hahahahaha. None of you know me and now I feel like king. Well, gay king. Don't worry...I still know my place. Okay...I have so gone overboard. That's what happens when you "stop by your site" after a few hundred vodka tonics with extra lemon yum does anyone have a vodka tonic with extra lemon I am going to eat the donuts I bought I promised myself I wouldn't eat donuts anymore, but guess what I have powdered AND chocolate fuckin c ya

 At 11:30pm last night I was taking off my clothes to get into bed with Paul. Once naked, he and I sat in his living room to have our last cigarette before bed. We talked a bit and discussed the next days activities. I finished my cigarette first and went into his bedroom. There were no lights on in the apartment and the curtains that hang over his open bedroom doors were blowing back and forth grasped in the clutches of the fans oscillation. I decided to pull a little joke on Paul. I climbed onto his bed and jumped into a doggie style position, my ass humping the air. Behind me I hear Paul say Very funny Joe. Put that ass away. But to me the joke wasnt over as I stayed in my all fours position. Eventually I realized that the joke was beating itself into the ground and I scooted back off the bed with a jolt. The next thing I knew, a lit cigarette was shoved right into my asshole. I SCREAMED in pain and started feverishly rubbing my rosebud. The pain was unbearable. Behind me I hear Paul apologizing over and over and over. Im SO sorry Joe. I didnt think you were going to back up so quickly. Why did you scoot backwards like that?? JOE! I am SO SORRY!? Why the FUCK would you stick a burning cigarette near my ass, PAUL!? WHY?!?! Oh my GOD you fucking ASSHOLE! My ass is on FIRE!!! Joe, pleaseI am so sorry. I am so so so sorry. SORRY!?!?!? What possesses a person to stick a lit cigarette into someones asshole!? How could this have ever happened?!?! I didnt realize you were going to back up. I didnt mean to hurt you at all. Then what DID you mean to do? What was the master plan in your head when you thought I am going to stick a lit cigarette in between Joes cheeks?? I am sorry. Can I do anything to make you feel better? Yes. Get me some Neosporin so I can slather my asshole with it. In no way was this story exaggerated. I sit here right now with the most tender butt hole on the face of the planet. Paul and I have a history of playing jokes on each other and once in a while a joke goes awry. In this case, it went very awry. In fact, its rather ironic that on Wednesday night, Ahmad was sticking his finger into my asshole and I was loving it, and on Thursday night, Paul was sticking his cigarette into my asshole and I was hating it. A true representation of the relationships I got goin. Paul felt terrible about it and didnt mean to hurt me. But this morning as I was taking my shit I cursed the day I ever met him. I feel as though I shit out a hundred Ginsu knives. Sheesh. In other news Tonight is my friend Joannas birthday. She has planned an event called The Spooky Ooky Pub Crawl. Everyone dresses up in spooky costumes and we go to bars like The Slaughter House and Meat Cleaver Mamas and Chop off my pussy spooky place. Okay, so maybe I made up the last one. Personally I dont know if I will dress up at all. I need to get some balls. I am nervous about dressing up in make-up and a costume and going with a bunch of girls to a bunch of straight bars where no one else will be dressed up. I knowget some fucking balls Joe. But I just cant. Most likely what I will do is put some blood on my mouth and say that I am a gay vampire. Or maybe I will dress up in my nicest outfit and when people ask me whats so spooky about me, I will whip out my dick and say Suck my scary dick. You know how it goes. Joanna has no idea that I am going. Initially I had to go home to Albany this weekend, but then found out that I had the wrong weekend booked on the calendar. Jo was very disappointed when I told her that I couldnt attend the spookfest, but she handled it all with style and grace. Mariah and I decided to surprise Joanna and not tell her that I can go afterall. It was going so well until Kelly called Joanna yesterday and told her that Of course Joe is going. Hes been talking about it all week! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Kelly didnt know that I was keeping the secret from Joanna. I never told Kelly about the plan. I didnt think I had to, since they very rarely talk. Luckily, with a little bit of acting skills and a lot bit of guilt, I was able to re-convince Joanna that I am not going out with them tonight. Crisis averted. It wasnt Kellys fault at all. It was mine. Also, Kellys ex-girlfriend (Angie), who is also a very good friend of mine, is coming into town for a visit! She has been in Mexico for the last 8 months on an internship. We are both very excited to have her back in NY. This weekend is (hopefully) going to be non-stop hilarity and fun. But also spooky . Spooky fun . Gosh, the inside of my butt is sore. Good thing Ahmad is going away on business for the next two weeks. Gives me time to heal. Paul just called me at work to apologize again for burning my insides. He also apologized for being a brat last night. Although Paul has begged me to give him another chance, last night he took every liberty in making me feel like a douchebag. But when he called this morning and actually apologized for being that way, it made me feel all mushy inside again. DAMN HIM. And DAMN ME for falling into the trap on a more than consistent basis. Kbefore I sign out for the weekend, I want to say two things. 1) If my comments arent working when you come by my site, refresh the page and they will eventually appear. I have gotten numerous emails asking me what the problem is and all I can say is that Blogger doesnt like me very much. I hope you can forgive them as well as me for not upgrading to a more appropriate server. 2) Whoever is leaving me the comments from Ahmads Fan Club, I LOVE you for taking the time out to be so creative and adorable. Yall make me laugh so often, its like I wouldnt be complete without having you there. This site has taken off into such a wonderful direction and I have you, the reader, to thank for it. I bless you all with a beautiful and fun weekend. And I bless me for being so smart, talented, and good looking. Arent I just the most humble and deserving kid you know? Yes, Joe! Yes you are! (cheering and applause echo throughout the room as Joe takes a bow and leaves.)

 Get to know urlLink Tina and urlLink Rose . I guarantee you will LOVE them. And yes urlLink T-Boner , I realize that you already know them. Everyone knows you. I find your little face all over the internet. And yes urlLink T-Bone , I love you more for it.

 Last night I came up with the best idea for a journal entry, but now I have to scrap it and go in a different direction. I will save my idea for a day when I have nothing to say. But today I have so much to say that I should just get into it. This is me getting into it. 1) I am doing this part time work for a lady in my office. Its basically data entry work, but the good thing is that I am getting paid $10 an hour for it and alsoget thisit is work I can do from home. AMAZING. Its mind numbing work, but when I put in 3 hours of work, I can say that I put in 6 hours of work and who hoo-----payday! In any case, the woman who is monitoring my work is what I like to call the most terrifying beast from the inner depths of ugly hell. She has absolutely no social graces whatsoever. On numerous occasions I have opened her office door and banged her in the head. You seeit makes sense. She lies down on the floor when things get too stressful. Doesnt EVERYONE do that at work?? Anyhobblelast week when she was showing me what to do with my data entry, she horrified me worse than usual. You see, beast had bitten her cuticle too short and proceeded to smear stripes of blood all over every piece of paper that she touched. I watched in HORROR as she smeared and wiped and gushed blood all over my work. I gagged on myself and was shocked that at no point did she seem embarrassed or grossed out by her blood smearing. She just wiped and leaked all over the place. On Sunday, when I pulled out the packet of work, I saw that the blood had turned from bright red to brown. I re-gagged on myself and vowed to never EVER be in the same room alone with this woman again. I also cut out the pieces of blood from each page of my work. It was hurting my feelings. 2) I went to get my hair cut today. I HATE getting my haircut, but it is imperative that I participate in such an activity. Cant be letting my pretty face be hidden by my pin straight Asian hair. In any case, when I sat down in the barbers chair, I looked at the mirror and noticed that I had a HUGE whitehead zit resting delicately next to my nose. WHEN DID I GET THAT?!? It was SO big and intimidating and I kept thinking Stupid Joe. Next time look in the mirror BEFORE you go out in public. When the hairdresser walked away, I took my fingernail and tried as quickly as I could to scratch off that disgusting imperfection. Unfortunately, the hairdresser returned before I could fully take care of the problem. For the rest of the hair cut I had blood sitting idly next to my nose. It was a trashy experience and I left with my head hung low. Is there a reason why my first too stories are blood filled? No, but my next story is about how I bled when breaking my hymen. SIKE. sorta sike. 3) Last night I had the best sex of my entire life. Seriously. Ahmad came over and although I was sick as a dog, he looked so PUMPED from the gym that I immediately had my hands all over his shoulders and arms. I just couldnt stop myself. He pulled away a few times, I think because he was trying to hold us back from going farther then we should have. Unfortunately, when I see a big playground of MUSCLE in front of me, I can do nothing else but climb the monkey bars and take a slide down thewellyou see where this clich is going. In any case, we made out for over an hour and we stripped each other naked for 20 long and enjoyable minutes. At one point, Ahmad looks at me and says I have never felt anything so good in my entire life. I want nothing more than to pick you up in my arms and make love to you. Ironically enough, I have never had anal sex in my life, but after knowing Ahmad for only 3 weeks, I came so close to doing it with him last night. When I kissed him I felt pure and utter electricity. I felt like he was making love to ever inch of my body. The sweat that poured off our bodies was a sure sign that we had truly let go of our sexual inhibitions. I rubbed his dick all over my ass region and gave him a taste of what its like to be SO CLOSE to an asshole that you cant fuck. Over and over he said: You are so warm. You are so warm. I love being this close to your body. And I loved it right back. Instead of inserting his dick into my ass, Ahmad inserted his finger. It takes the right moment and the right guy for me to allow anyone inside of me. I let Ahmad in because he is so MAN and I felt so erotically wonderful in his arms. After 15 minutes of expert fingering, I exploded (!) in one of the most intense orgasms of my entire life. Not only do I not cum in hook up situations, if I do, I do it only while I am submersed in fantasyland. I stayed focused on Ahmad throughout the entire experience and I realized, for the first time, how good sex can really be. Raw, powerful, and real. This week I have had amazing sex with both Paul and Ahmad. Pauls was very emotional because of where were at in our relationship. Ahmads was sexy and hot and unlike anything I have ever experienced. Can you see why I feel as though I am a kid in a candy store? But can you also see why I am nervous to be that kid? How much longer are both of these guys going to give me their all while I sit back and only give half of myself to each one? In a selfish way, Im glad. Its about time that I thought only about myself. Its about time that I have a little fun. Its about time that I get to know what its like to be a healthy, sexually active male. At 25, Ive yet to get to know this side of my personality. And as I have said over and over in the last paragraphits time. Its funny. I havent masturbated in a couple of weeks. There has been so much touching and kissing and jerking in my life that when I am by myself, I have no desire to play around with my ding dong. Fucking ding dong. What I meant to say wasplaying around with my Venus De Milo. Remember when I was all depressed and suicidal a month or so ago? What a fucking crybaby I was! I wish I could go back and slap myself in my crybaby face! I so deserved some slaps. sike. That was a test. If you agreed with slapping my crybaby face, then now I know that you dont really believe in depression as an actual disease. Thanks a lot you . Thanks a very lot. Im going to go pull my dick in the bathroom for a bit. Lord knows I havent had nearly enough action in the last 72 hours. PEAYCE.

 Hi everyone. I am a sick kid. I very rarely get sick and when I do, its like the world falls out from underneath my feet. Although I had an amazing weekend, I contracted some sort of food poisoning on Saturday night and the sickness rode with me until this morning. Talk about vomit. Ive never seen such an ugly color of bile in my entire life. Over and over I threw up and when I got up to go to work yesterday morning, I realized that I had pulled every muscle in my back. Thats what retching uncontrollably will do to a person. Ah well. I think the best part is that I kicked the stomach thing by this morning, but now I have severe head congestion. Im talking sneezing every five minutes water eyes head congestion. GAH. I am exhausted with being sick. No more please. Since last Thursday, so much has happened. Ahmad has proven himself to be a superstar when it comes to the way he takes care of me. Manif I say jump, the kid literally jumps. When standing looking at his boxes of cereal (all of which are healthy chunks of granola snores) I say I want Cookie Crisp, Boo Berry, or Fruity Pebbles. Ahmad says he is going for a run and returns with Cookie Crisp, Fruity Pebbles, and Franken Berry. Wellhe was close. I ate one bowl of Cookie Crisp and havent been back to his apartment since. I mean, AMAZING that he went out and surprised me with these little treats. But oopshe doesnt eat those kind of cereals. Now hes stuck with them rotting in his kitchen. The part that stood out to me the most though is that he listens. When I speak, he hears every word. And thatI love. Butuh-oh. Paul came over to my apartment on Sunday night and in the midst of my vomiting and rolling on the bed in agony, he bursts into tears and asked me to Please take him back. I sat there staring at him and let him continue. Paul: Joe, I love you more than I have ever loved anyone in my life. I dont have anything in my life that compares to you. Not my family, not my friends, and not my jobs. I want you and only you, Joe. What can I do to make us better? Joe: I have told you repeatedly what I need from you Paul. I am not going to sit here and tell you again. I am pretty sure that the only reason you are telling me this shit now is because you finally realize that I am moving on without you. Paul: Do you even want to be with me anymore? Joe: I really dont know. Paul: Do you have any forgiveness left in your heart? Joe: I dont know. Paul: Joe, I am willing to work on our relationship. I am willing to call you more, be nicer to you, work on our sexual relationship. Joe, I am willing to be the boyfriend that you deserve. Joe: While I would have killed to hear those words months ago, right now I cant allow myself to trust you. I have put in so much effort into this relationship and I am tired of doing it now. I realize that other people treat me better than you do. And most importantly, I feel better about myself when I am not with you. Paul: (sobbing) Please Joe. I need one more chance. I will work on what I need to work on. I promise you. Joe: (sobbing as well) You dont need to promise me anything. If it is important enough to you, you will fix it on your own. Obviously the conversation went on much longer and in much more detail, but this was the highlight. Since that talk, Paul has been incredible. He has been sweet, kind, and supportive. Monday afternoon, as I lay in bed sick as a dog, Paul woke up and made love to me. The way that I have wanted him to make love to me since January. It was a beautiful time together and I enjoyed every second of it. It was the only time over the last couple of days when I havent felt like complete shit. As easy as it is for me to fall back into the routine with Paul, I am doing my absolute best to keep a level head and to not count on the fact that things with him will improve. In all honesty, I really hope it does, but I am so used to being disappointed by him that I cant count on it anymore. I am still hanging out with Ahmad and I plan to continue doing so. But so far so good. Paul has asked that I try to work with his schedule and to be as open minded about us as I can be. If Paul is willing to put in extra effort, I am willing to make him my first priority. But the second I see him slipping back into his old ways, I pull out. Until I am confident that we are in a better place, this will be how things go in our world. So yeah. Wow. I am SO pleased that he has made these small steps so far. Now if I could only kick this fucking head cold. I got a big weekend coming up and HELLS if I am going to miss out on any more activities. HELLS. BELLS. So many bells. Latas.

 Haven't posted cuz I had food poisoning. Poisening. Poisen-ing. So sick. Will be back tomorrow.

 For you, its Thursday. For me, its Friday. Tomorrow is the Shavuot holiday and I have the day off from work! Woo hooooo! Considering that I want to take as much advantage as I can of the time I have off, I have been hastily making plans to fill up my days. Usually I like to have a block of time to myself as welljust to rejuvenate and get my shit back together. However, this time around, I will be continuing on the little sleep that I have now and dont imagine that I will be resting much before next week. My mom is coming to town on Sunday! She has a business meeting in the city and will be staying until Tuesday. We have plans to go see Dream a Little Dream , the new off-Broadway, Mammas and Papas musical. We have plans to have some wine and a nice dinner. AND we have plans to buy my ass some new clothes. My mom is overly generous with me and has been known to sacrifice whatever she has in order to make my life a little bit easier, especially now that my brother is somewhere in Iraq. She has been talking about this trip to NYC for awhile and I am going to do whatever I can to make this trip wonderful for her. I am so lucky to have her and I try to take advantage of this fact whenever I possibly can. I love my mother more than I love most anyone I have met in my life. Tonight I am going out for drinks with Paul. Tomorrow I am spending the day with Ahmad. Saturday I am hanging out with fellow bloggers. Sunday and Monday I am with my mom. Tuesday, I die. Goshdating two boys at once sure can take a lot out of a gay. ErI mean, guy. But I am excited. Its a lot better than sitting at home miserable and depressed. Yesterday I received my mug from urlLink Sassy ! Gosh, I cant go on about this girl enough. Its my first present from a fellow journaler. And can I say that it is the coolest mug I have ever had? Its so manly and full of punkin love. So, THANK YOU Sass. You made my day yesterday. Im using the mug to hold my jizz loads. Anyone want a Joe baby? Twelve bucks a pop. My hair has been so good lately. It falls right into place and to be honest, looks like some sort of movie star hair. That is until TODAY. For some reason it is a HUGE poof of nonsense. I resemble a cross between Tina Turner and Weird Al Yankovich. Okaywowis this ALL I have to write about today? Lets play a game. The game is called My Bloodiest Booger. We start by putting our forefinger up our nose. (Pausing for you to put your finger up your nose) No no no. You must put it way farther up there than that. Im talking FAR. All set? Now take your fingernail and scratch the inside of your nose with all of your might! OUCH!, right? Well, do it again. Good job. Pull your finger out and look at it. How much blood and booger did you find? If it covers your whole forefinger, you get 5 points. If you find nothing, you get a punch. If you get a huge piece of bloody messyou are the winner! Eat it and declare yourself the King (or queen) of the Bloodiest Booger contest. End game. SOMariah, Kelly, and I came up with a fun activity for ourselves this summer. We dont have a name for the game yet, but I think it will be called SLUTS or BUST. This is how you play: When you are at a bar, it is imperative that you find a man or woman of your dreams and get them to fuck you. That is really the essential point of the whole game. You get 1 point for every kiss that you get. You get five points for every time someone goes down on you. You get 10 points for staying over at that persons apartment AND getting them to go down on you. Obviously there are points that are given for varying degrees of sexual escapades. It is up to the other two people, not involved in the hook-up, to determine the amount of points dolled out. I started the game with 10 points because of my experience with Ahmad. But since I was so confident that I would accrue more points, I let those 10 drop and am currently at zero. Once you hook up with someone, they dont count anymore. So, as far as this game is concerned, Ahmad nets me zero points. But dont you worryI will get me some more. Mariah currently has 5 points. She stayed over at this 35-year-old chick, Patties house, but she didnt do the whole hook-up. So she only gets 5. Kelly is currently at zero. But you waitthat girl will strike the minute she feels ready. Fun game, eh? I am hoping that by the end of the summer, I will have 95 points, the Clap, and a mild strain of the herpes. Goshthen I will be the WINNER! Alright my ghoulies. Please rememberif you didnt eat your bloody booger, you will have to wipe it under a countertop somewhere. Not everyone is as fond of the game as we are. PEAYCE!

 If God brings you to it, He will bring you through it. The last few weeks have brought so many changes into my life. At times it felt as though the changes were too dramatic and a bit daunting. But I am starting to settle into the new and hopefully improved, Joe. I havent had a down day in a couple of weeks. My emotions have been much calmer and easier to control and my head doesnt feel nearly as cloudy as it has since I moved into Times Square. I am starting to achieve the seemingly impossible task of becoming focused on both my personal life and career. I am trying to learn how to take things day by day. I am trying not to stress so much about unnecessary bullshit. I am trying, more than ever, to be the best Joe I can be. Last night I spent the evening with Ahmad. We didnt end up going out to a nice dinner because we were having way too much fun drinking wine and smoking the Gangia. We hung out at my apartment for awhile and then we went back to his place to talk and hang some more. The night went more smoothly than it has in the past. There wasnt pressure on me to like him as much as he likes me and we both took everything very slowly. We treated each other as friends and that was it. I laughed with him and I shared with him. It wasnt until we went to bed (3am - ugh) that we began to kiss and touch and become intimate. The problem is that Ahmad has an unbelievable body. While I know that I need to avoid physical intimacy with him right now, it is very hard to do when I just want to squeeze and feel his amazing pecs and arms. And can I say again how amazingly this kid kisses?? From his lips to his hands, he is gentle, but strong. (I am getting hard just writing about it.) He holds me and I feel safe with him. In bed, he is total man and I couldnt ask for anything more. But I also have to keep in mind that his feelings for me are progressing a lot faster than my feelings for him. I have to remember that or the last kiss I will have with him will be us kissing our friendship goodbye. When Ahmad showed up at my apartment last night, he brought me a present. It was a book called The Muslim Jesus . On our first date, we had discussed the differences between Islam and Christianity and I was surprised to find out that they have a lot more in common than I previously thought. The only HUGE difference is that Muslims believe in Jesus Christ as a prophet. I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. While Ahmad is a semi-practicing Muslim, I find him to be very open-minded when it comes to listening and understanding other peoples religious points of views. I have a lot of personal conviction when it comes to discussions about God and Jesus and heaven, etc. He totally respects my opinions and has an honest interest in what I have to say. Gosh, he is a wonderful conversationalist. At no point did I think about Paul last night. Ok, maybe once or twice, but it wasnt nearly as heartbreaking as it was for me two weeks ago. I like the direction that Ahmad and my relationship is going. It feels easier now and without any of the previous pressure to fall in love, get married, and have 16 gay babies. One day at a time. Or something equally as generic. I am out of the office for most of the day today due to our annual staff lunch. Ari and I are both dreading it. We would rather have our own lunch break and do our own thing. I think the part that pisses me off the most is that over the next two weeks, our contracts of employment are up for review and that means Raise Time. Ari and I are both asking for more money than we will get. And the worst part about it is that the money we are asking for is not out of the question at all. If anything, we both deserve it, hands down. But instead of giving us a good raise, my bosses will do as they have done in the past. They will give us a 3-5% raise and a lunch out at a cheap Middle Eastern restaurant. Rock! And also, Fuck! Whatever. I am eating my weight in hummus today. Thatll show em. I missed the premiere of The Real World: Paris last night. I will have to catch it this weekend in repeats. I did find out, however, where they are filming the NEXT Real World . SAN DIEGO! Now THAT will be a great house. Finally some place new and some place interesting. Mary Ellis Bunim and Jonathan Murray can take Las Vegas and shove it up their ass. E gads. I hope they dont Google their names and find out that I wrote that. I just love those two. What does a cannibal call a phone book? Well? What is it? Alright, be lazyI will tell you. A menu! A HAR HAR HAR HAR. A YUK YUK YUK YUK. A snore. I like my new template. It makes me feel clean and pretty. And if you put your nose up close to your computer screen, it smells like Bubblicious. Go aheadtry it. Yum, right? Total yum. But not Bubble Yum. Bubbalicious! AlrightI have to go be Jewish now. The Rabbis are ready to go eat some Babaganoush! Shalom to you and yours.

 First, I would like to introduce a blog that I found earlier today. Please welcome urlLink Not So Simple . I noticed that she had me linked to her site and I went over and visited her this morning. I was stuck on her site for quite a while. The girl has some serious talent when it comes to writing. I began with one of her past posts called Her Body is a Map of Scars It was excellent. So honest and bold. I enjoyed it immensely and because of that, I had to give her a little plug in here. She is good. Please check her out. Last night, as Paul and I were wiping the cum off our bodies, we flipped over to the Style network. (yes, you got that rightPaul and I hooked last night! Fucking finally) -(More about that in a minute) The Style network was promoting this new reality show in which they take homeless people off the street, give them makeovers and new jobs, and help them fix their life. While watching this minute long preview, I immediately got choked up. What a wonderful concept! After I regained my composure and slapped myself in the nuts for being such a crybaby over stupid reality TV, I got immediately angry at our society. Why is it that we broadcast dozens of reality shows about people trying to marry fake millionaires or people trying to marry guys with ugly masks on or people trying to compete for their dead grandfathers will? And WHY do we reward these people with a million bucks? For the love of the Lord. Seeing the preview for this Homeless Life Make-Over show made me see how wrong we all are in supporting these other cheesy and useless shows. If we are going to sit around and watch reality television every night, why dont we want to watch shows where people with AIDS finally get the treatment they need? Or a show about foster kids finally finding a family that will love them? Why the FUCK are we sitting around watching Joe Millionaire FuckFace lie and slander women in order to win himself some cheap fame and cash? I just dont get it. And as of right now, I dont support it. I mean, sure. I will still watch MTVs reality programming cuz I have said in this journal time and time again that they are the first and the best. And no ones getting a lame ass reward out of the deal. But as far as watching The Bachelor or For Love or Money or Insert the unclever name of an unclever show here, Im done. You can take my nonexistent Nielsen rating and shove it up your ass, corporate conglomerates. You dont have my support any longer. I originally thought it was bad enough that people preferred reality TV to scripted sitcoms based on the fact that so many actors are going out of work. Now I just think its sad that as a society we prefer watching people suffer more than we prefer watching people get the help that they need. And that we financially support these boners. Im done. So yesPaul and I DID hook up last night. I had to play with his limp penis for 20 minutes before I could get him in the mood. Then he wouldnt even kiss me until I had him lubed up and ready to go. I was happy that we shared this time together, but of course irritated as fuck that it took so much effort on my part to make it happen. One of these days I am going to go down on him and bite that lazy dick of his right off. ORone of these days, I will find someone who actually gives a shit about sex. And about me. SNORE A LICIOUS. Tonight, Ahmad is taking me out to dinner. I think we are going to the the urlLink SoHo Grand . He told me to dress up really nicely and to be ready for a good time. I checked out the Grand online and to be honest, it seems a bit out of my league. Ok, a bit? It is HELLA out of my league. I dont think I have any clothes nice enough to wear. I am calling him a little bit later and I am going to do my best to change his mind about our dinner destination. I am a diner type of kid; not a glamorous restaurant type of kid. Money means nothing to me and the possession of it means even less. Kelly would kill me if she knew that I was giving up the chance at going out to dinner at a place like The Grand. She has been dying to find someone to take her out to dinner. I understand how she feels, as I have been there before. But she wants to go out classy and expensive and I just dont care at all about classy or expensive. We have completely different tastes when it comes to dining out. She is rather elegant and I am rather down to earth. But if someone doesnt take this girl out soon, I might have to mortgage my entire life and do it myself. Its getting to that point. Too bad Ahmad doesnt like pretty blue eyed ladies. He could take HER to the SOHO Grand. But then Id have to cut his dick off for leading me on. Okwhat is WITH me and the mangling of dicks today? I need to get fucked. Thats probably it. Off to take a nap for lunch. Cuz when you make $30,000 a year at a shit holeyou get to take naps during your lunch break. And this bitch is ready for his! Latas lovahs.

 So as we can see, I have a new template! I have no idea what I did to my page last Friday, but whatever it was, it fucked up my shit royally. Since I am HTML illiterate, I did what any blogging amateur doesI chucked the whole thing and started over. Honestly, I like it better now. All of that dark blue was hurting my eyes. And the print was small and everyone had the same template and wellthis is a much more grown up looking site for my shit slinging entries. Here are two conversations that happened today. You figure out which one was had by a four year old girl and her 6 year old sister and which one was had by a 26 year old Paul and a 25 year old Joe. First Conversation: Why do you always hurt my feelings? Cuz I hate you. You shouldnt hate people. I cant help who I hate and I hate you. Then I hate you too. I hope you die. YOU DIE. I hate you and I hope you die. You are not supposed to tell people that you hope they die. To me you are already dead. Second Conversation: Why do you always hurt my feelings? hahahaha. Do you think this is funny? Stop acting so stupid. What did you just say to me? You get so mad over nothing. Who do you think you are talking to? Who do you think YOU are talking to? I hate you. Dont say you hate people. But I really do hate you. Do you want me to lie? Youre a jerk. Im a jerk that hates you. Oh yes. I love looking at my conversation compared with childrens conversations and not being able to tell the difference. Just love it. Paul has been a fucking prick all day. Ahmad has been a gem all day. Do I need to be slapped in the face every day by senor douchebag in order for me to remember that one of these guys is much more worth it than the other? Its totally ridiculous. And I am totally bored with writing about it. In other news, I am going to be in my first show EVER in NYC. The show is called Stupid Kids and it is extremely cutting edge and powerful. I have already been cast as one of the lead parts and my stomach clenches in excitement every time I think about it. Today I am going to the park on my lunch break to re-read the script. Since I have moved to NYC, I have been waiting for the moment when I could go to the park and read a script of something that I am working on. Could this be the start of Joe CuttheShits acting career? Yes, I think so. In two weeks, we are auditioning for the last role of the production. Unfortunately, it is a very hard role to cast. The guy who has to play the part must be overly masculine and comfortable with onstage homosexual kissing (kissing ME!). Its a lot to ask for, but it is a wonderfully challenging role if the right person gets cast. Considering the fact that I am not directing this show, I am a bit nervous as to whom is going to play this part. It is my job as an actor to work with whatever I am given and that I will do. But it would be a much better experience if the group could cast someone who not only fits the part aesthetically, but talent wise as well. Gosh, I am so excited to be working again! Can someone explain to me why it is has rained every fucking weekend since February? And can someone else explain to me why it is beautifully sunny on every Monday? It is so fucking annoying. I would kill to have a sun-filled weekend. And the person I would kill is you.

 This will be my last entry until after I return from the Bahamas. I leave work today at 5pm and will not be looking back once. I dont have to come to this place for 9 whole days. Its like the best thing to happen to me all year. Its not that my job is so bad, per se, but just knowing that the next week and a half is for meah yes. Freedom in its truest form. I just finished reading urlLink The World of Normal Boys . Ahmad let me borrow it before we stopped hanging out and I just finally got around to reading it. There are very few books that have impacted me the way this one did. The story was captivating, the characters were beautiful, the emotions conveyed so honest and real. The book sent my entire world into a free fall. As I closed the book, I sat staring at the trees in the park and contemplated my existence. How lucky am I to be who I am? How blessed am I to have the family and friends that I have? Gosh, some people dont have it nearly as good as I do. I cried and let the tears flow down my face, unashamed. Reading this book was one of the best experiences I have had all week. I feel touched in the most incredible way. A mixture of happiness and sadness balled into one. Because so much is going on around me right now it is hard to exhibit any sort of control. I feel good, but I feel anxious. So much to do, yet none of it is negative. I dont necessarily like feeling this way. I like to have control over my life and over the emotions that result. Unfamiliar feelings scare me. At times, I think that I should avoid books like this, as it brings so many delicate topics right to the surface. However, I always walk away a stronger and better person because of it. In other newsI am petrified of the upcoming flight to the Bahamas. I am sure that everything will be fine and that there wont be any problems. There hasnt been an airline accident (in the US) in over a year. But the unknownthe wonderingthe time that I have to sit and fantasize about my horrible death. Please God let this flight be smooth. Calm me down, relax me into it, and let me enjoy it for what its worth. I have been waiting so long for this moment. Dont want it to be ruined by superficial fears. Trust in God. I will miss all of you while I am gone. Miss the routine of it all. If there is any chance that I can find a computer in Freeport, I will stop in and give a quick hello. But if not, I hope that everyone has a painless and enjoyable week. Do something for yourself. Tell someone that you love them, even if they are driving you crazy. Take 20 minutes out of your day to spend thinking and analyzing yourself, your situation in life. Do this and find some peace. Gosh, next time I write in here, this whole trip will be over. If for some reason I dont make it through the flight, I need my Rita to take care of my friends and family that I have left behind. Kelly, you are in charge of disposing of my dildos, porn, and anything else that would otherwise embarrass the other people in my life. I trust in you two the most. You know everything about me. Alright, that is it. I am leaving for a trip that will hopefully bring a moving and life changing experience. Be good everyone! And Dont forget about me.

 I came home tonight and sat down at my computer. Alone in my house. Alone, in general, for the first time in a long time. It's weird cuz back in the day, 2 months ago, I was spending every night alone in my room. Upset, sad that I had nothing to get me out of bed. Here I sit now, busy and happy. The two seem to cooperate so perfectly. Remember this moment Joe. Remember the introspective nature of this feeling. There are times when everything slows down for a moment and you are given the chance to truly experience it. Seemingly for the first time of your life. But you've been in this place before and your concious knows that. Yet, this time it feels different. This time it feels real. It's rare to experience peace like this. It leaves faster than it comes. But the sheer exhiliration of it all makes these moments worth the wait. Worth the sadness and worth the frustration that is commonplace. Still I wouldn't trade it for the world.

 Much better mood today. Thank the goodness. However, my comments are PISSING me the fuck off! I have tried adding Squawkbox in an effort to get some sort of comment system back, but instead, all I got was a SquawkboxTV icon. No comments. RAWR! Ari is having the same trouble, so at least I am not alone in my problem. Why oh why is my blogger so gay? Dont answer that. 72 hours until I leave for the biggest trip of my life! Woo HOOODLE! So thrilled. Boneriffic! Supersplendific! Cumonmyfaceeriffic! Ieatmyownshittastic! enough. After my rehearsal last night, I was shocked to find Paul waiting for me in my bedroom at home. After the night we had on Monday, I was sure I wouldnt hear from him again until the trip, but there he wastotally brightening my mood. We had a good rest of the night together. We watched Queer Eye for the Straight Guy . Its pretty good. And thats about all I have to say about that. (can you tell that it made quite the impression on me?) HOWEVERPaul introduced me to a show called urlLink Da Ali G . Its this one-man show on HBO. I dont really know how to describe it, without ruining it, except to say that it is the funniest shit I have seen in my whole entire life. While watching back to back to back episodes the other night, I couldnt contain my howling laughter. I mean, seriously. It is SO funny that I would give up sex with Paul every night if I could just watch 10 minutes of it. Oh. Oops. Ive already given up sex with Paul. Yeah, even trade. Please please PLEASE take 27 minutes out of your day to tune in and watch it. I promise you will not be disappointed. The end. I did, in fact, cancel my plans with Ahmad for this evening. He handled it very well, as he is porking his new gay boyfriend, Leo. Ahmad called me to wish me a Good trip and I brought up the Leo thing. Just to know what was going on. He got all uncomfortable and was like I cant talk about this at work. Yeah fucking right. So I pushed him farther. How long have you and Leo been dating? About a week or two. Have you hooked up? Yes, but it was very minor. Kissing here and there. (Then I found the opportunity to zing him) Do you realize, Ahmad, that in the last 7 weeks you have had 3 different partners? (Like I give a shit at ALL about that, but I KNEW that it would make him a bit upset) Yes, I realize that Joe. But I would settle on one partner if the guy was just interested enough to continue our relationship. OOOPS. Pushed that one too far. No, you definitely should pursue things with Leo. UmI gotta go now. I laughed it off and got off the phone slapping myself in the head. Why do I DO things like that? Am I really that immature? Dont answer that question either. I am about to leave to have lunch with Mariah. I am taking a 2-hour lunch today. I just decided. I also decided that I love candy-coated candy. Yum, right? UM! I just got back from my lunch with Mariah. You are NEVER going to believe what happened! We were casually sitting, having a nice lunch, when chaos broke loose! People go RUNNING down the street, cop cars are everywhere, and there is tons of screaming. Everyone in the restaurant gets up and walks outside. Mariah and I pick up the baby she is the nanny for and we join the crowd. Down the block, we are told, there is a GUNMAN shooting people in City Hall! UM!!!!!! We all duck back into the restaurant as the police scream to everyone Get off the street! Move into the buildings! We rush back to our table and one of the bartenders turns the television to urlLink CNN . We watch as they do a live broadcast, telling of a crazy person shooting people in City Hall. Councilman James Davis was killed and as of right now, we don't know who else was killed. It is RIGHT OUTSIDE the spot that we chose to have lunch! We barely finish our meals and grab our shit to go. She and I barrel through the crowds and make it to the subway. It was absolutely NUTS! And it also figuresthe day I take a 2-hour lunch is the day that I end up in the middle of gunfire. (ok, so not so in the middle of gunfire, but CLOSE ENOUGH!) All in all it was great to see Mariah and I love that every time she and I get together, there is madness. It makes hanging out with her so exciting. BTWamidst the chaos, the baby wanted nothing, but to eat my french fries. Stupid baby. OkI am almost done with work and THANK HEAVENS! This week has been an udder beast. Yes I meant UDDER. Its been a beast with teets.

 My job has been the demise of my existence today. I have a ton of shit to do, the people are driving me up the fucking wall, and there is no reprieve, ever. It figures. I should have expected that it would be like this. Every time I have some extended time off from this shithole, everything seems to fall apart right before I leave. And I even detect some guilt being thrown my way. As though I am not totally deserved in going away on my vacation. Twatmothafuckingever. Paul and I spent the majority of our evening, last night, fighting. Well, in all honesty, he was amazing for the first three hours, while I was a bitch. I couldnt shake my bad mood and every time he opened his mouth, I wanted to kill him. He wasnt doing anything wrong, but the fury and disdain I was feeling manifested itself into an incredibly horrible attitude. Finally I broke out of my bad mood around 9pm and Paul picked up where I left off. At one point, he got so angry with me that he threw my pillow at me and told me to go to bed. By then I was done with my pouty, selfish, bullshit, and looked at him as though I couldnt possibly figure out why he was so angry. He screamed and screamed for awhile and I just got into bed. We fell asleep on opposite sides of the bed. I woke up, in the middle of the night, and kissed him on his forehead. He smiled and said Thank you and thats the last thing that we said to each other. Im just in one of those moods. Im stressed out about the vacation, about my job, about how much I have to do. I dont have time to see the people I want to see and the people I have to see are pissing me off to no end. I feel angry inside. And there is no reason for that. I am about to go away on the best vacation of my life, yet I cant find a way to get through this fucking irritating week. GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAH! I had pizza for lunch today. Its been weeks since I did that. You should have heard the debate that was going on in my head about this stupid decision. Dont do it Joe. Youve come too far to ruin your diet with two slices of pizza for lunch. Oh just fucking do it. Two slices of pizza will do nothing more than make your mood better. So I ate the pizza and then got angry at myself when it was finished. Why did I think that drowning my attitude in grease and fat was going to cure anything? Now Im angry AND bloated AND I have to wear a bathing suit in less than 5 days. Wonderful. Ahmad and I are supposed to go see Terminator 3 tomorrow night. However, we had a short e-mail exchange today in which he exposed the fact that he is dating a new guy, named Leo. Deep down I want to be happy for him and I want to be happy for me. Ahmad is moving on and it looks as though I wont have to confront our break-up conversation again. But the petty and ridiculous side of me is pissed off that he is dating someone else. I know its not fair and I know that he has done nothing wrong, but with the way I have felt over the past few days, I feel like I could jump on the subway, ride over to his office building, and spit in his face. Obviously I wont be spitting in anyones face. But I will be canceling our little trip to the movie theater tomorrow night. I just cant help it. He should ask Leo to go with him. God, I suck today. Alright, back to work. I think there is some data entry calling my name and its probably best that I take out my aggression on that, rather than on the people in my life that dont deserve such nonsense. Hey, were all allowed a bad day every now and then, right?

 Take two minutes to make sure that urlLink I am allowed to get married .

 This morning as I took my shit and read my Entertainment Weekly , I found myself staring at a picture of Jason Mraz. Now, we understand that I have a new obsession with his music, but as I sat atop my toilet, I realized that it wasnt the music I was thinking about. His skinny little body, dressed up in his jeans and hoody, made me incredibly horny. I wanted to kiss him. I wanted to unbuckle those jeans and feel his girth while he held the back of my neck and kissed me. SICK! Hes skinny! What was WRONG with me?!?! Maybe I am growing up after all. I leave for the Bahamas on Saturday! AY YI YI! While enduring some pretty heavy constipation earlier, I sat and thought about the flight. Within minutes, the nerves in my stomach broke up my packed up bowels and the poop exploded with success. Basically that was my disgusting way of letting you know that I am nervous as all hell about the flight. When I told Paul that I was pretty scared, his response was You know Joe, if its our time to die there is nothing you can really do about it. Thanks Paul. You totally squelched my fears. I had an absolutely INCREDIBLE time with Rita this weekend. Swear to God, the visit flew by so fast that I sit here shocked that I went to Syracuse and back. We had so many drinks, so many conversations, so many laughs. I spent some quality time with her fiance and he asked me to be in the wedding. On the grooms side. Rita and I thought it was best for me to wear a tux, rather than in my beautiful bridesmaid dress. You understand. Rita introduced me to the world of moisturizing. I have been battling this eczema/psoriasis thing, on my face, for years, but for the most part, it is under control. However, I woke up on Sunday morning to discover that both of my cheeks were COVERED in dry skin. Im talking lizard-like scales that made me look as though I was preparing for Halloween, 3 months early. Rita gave me a bottle of sensitive, Clinique lotion to use until my face gets under control. Well, wouldnt you know it? That little genius of a Rita has given me the gift of healthy moisturized skin! It looks MUCH better. Just wish I was smart enough to figure that one out on my own. Sometimes I am such a boy its ridiculous. I havent seen Ahmad since my birthday. We spoke on the phone once. So last week, I sent him a forwarded email questionnaire thing-a-majigger. One of the questions was What did you do last night? Ahmads answer was Had an awesome date with a great guy. We had two bottles of wine and a nice dinner. Funny, cuz I thought he and I were still dating, but clearly he is with someone else. Another question was Do you like the person who sent this to you? Ahmads answer to that one was Sure. My initial reaction was What a cunt smeller! Im not complaining that Ahmad is pulling himself away from me. Its fine. I want him to pull away from me because I dont know how to tell him that he and I are totally over. Unfortunately, I would still like to be friends with him and I am unsure if that is going to be a possibility. We are supposed to go see Terminator 3 on Wednesday and I am already trying to come up with a way to cancel. But if I do cancel, he will surely hate me forever. I dont know. I just dont want to deal with any of this until I come back from the Bahamas. Thats fair, right? Actually I dont care if its fair at allits whats going to happen. Everything is my life is going pretty well these days. Rehearsals are great, work is hectic as fuck, but fine - my parents are good, my brother is doing well, and yeah. Overall I feel great! I get nervous when I have this feeling. Like I shouldnt enjoy the relaxed nature of everything. It is so rare for there to be any calm in my life, that when it does happen, I feel as though something is surely going to show up and turn everything upside down. I am perpetually stuck in the dropping of the other shoe theory. Then again, maybe I should just stop it and allow myself to feel good. 4 more days until I leave for my trip. I dont think I have ever been this anxious and excited about something in my life. I am leaving the country for the first time! And my first question to my mom this morning was Will our condo have cable? Ah geez Joe. Cut the Shit.

 Have an AMAZING weekend everyone! I am off to Syracuse to visit the love of my life: MISS RITA LOVELY! Be back on Monday with tales of raunch, gore, and love.

 Having good hair is extremely important to me. That is why I absolutely hate going to the hairdresser. My hair is pin straight and if not cut correctly, will stick up to the ceiling, despite any amount of gel or pomade I use. So imagine my surprise when the lady spun me around in my chair today and I was like YAHOO! That is a do after my own heart! No joke, I hugged her as I was leaving. Then I stiffed her on the tip. Sike. I decided, while walking the streets of the Upper West Side, that I LOVE the male body. I love the way it looks, I love the way it feels, I love the way clothes fall on a man. Gosh, I love it all. Like seriously in LOVE with man body. The more muscle, the better. To me, it exemplifies masculinity and strength. A real man takes care of his woman. A real man works hard at his job and just as hard in his personal life. A real man should embody everything beautiful and spiritual in the world. I love men. My favorite body part on a man is the arms. I love big and strong, built up arms. I love when a guy flexes for me and I love when he is confident during the flex. A love a man that will pick me up. I love a man that wants me to sit on his lap. I love a man who can do all of these things and not emasculate me in the process. I know, sounds like irony in its truest form, but as a gay man, this is how I feel. A man who will pull his shirt off and get under his pick-up truck to do some manual labor wins my heart immediately. I much prefer blue collared men to the Wall Street banker world of white collared snore. I like a man with dirty hands. I like a man who has bulging forearms, with veins snaking up the interior. I like a man that smells of sweat. I like a man that works for everything he has and refuses to accept pity. My man also has to have a sense of humor. He has to be able to keep up a conversation, to read people, to stand by me even when I am wrong. My man will put his arm around me when I cry as well as when I have accomplished something important. When I feel low, it will be my man that cheers me up. My man will understand me because he will love me. I dont care what my mans face looks like. I have enough face for the two of us. I do, however, care that my man is physically fit. He must work on his body and treat it as though it is his temple. He must exercise, eat well, and keep on me to do the same. (pizza binges excluded) My man will take me to the gym with him. He will teach me new and improved ways of keeping myself fit. My man will be my mentor and my supporter in all of these endeavors. I think that this is a pretty good description of the ideal man. Obviously, when you fall in love, some, if not most of these requirements, become unimportant. You fall in love with who someone is, not what they look like or how many times they have been to the gym. I just hope that the next time I fall in love, it is with someone who has more of these qualities than the men I have been with previously. I just wonder what it would be like to be in a loving and nurturing relationship with a man of this nature. I guess Ill keep wondering.

 Im gay. So this morning I woke up at 6:30am to go to the DMV downtown. I dont think I have gotten up that early since I was in high school. I thought it was going to be a lot more of a pain in the ass than it was. I woke up before the alarm, which I always tend to do, but not when I have to get up an hour earlier. In any case, the DMV was mostly painless and I was able to keep my old drivers license! WOO HOOOOO! Now I dont have to worry about only having the temp. card for when I go to the BAHAMA MAMAS. That took a LOAD of pressure off my back. When I was waiting to get my picture taken, I fell in love with the most beautiful specimen of a man that has ever existed. Seriously, no contest. This man wins the awards for best body, best face, best hair, best clothes, best sex appeal, and the clincherbest voice. He opened his mouth to read the eye chart and this deep and sexy voice came out of his manly throat and I literally gaped in awe of him. He and I made a ton of eye contact and I hoped with every being in my life that he was gay AND also attracted to me. And also attracted to me enough that he would approach me and ask me out to dinner. Then he did. He strolled right up to me, took his shirt off and picked me up in his arms. I stared into his dark and deep brown eyes as he kissed me on the forehead. I started to cry. Im in love with you, he said. Im in love with you too, I said. He carried me out of the DMV and down the street. People were staring at us, but I didnt care. I had finally found the love of my life. He walked us down into the subway and stood there holding me, waiting for the train to come. You can put me down now, I said. I dont think so, he replied. But Im getting kind of embarrassed, so you can put me down any time you are ready, I said back. This man of my dreams held onto me even tighter and I finally released into him, cuddling as close as I could to his awesome chest. I could see the lights of the train coming down the track. Ok, put me down please so I can get onto the train. No, fucker. he said. Fucker? I thought out loud. Did he really just call me fucker? Sumptins up. I looked into his eyes to see if it was possible. He just smiled back, holding onto me with every muscle in his arms. As the train approached, this stud kissed me on the forehead again and tossed me into the tracks. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! I screamed. But it was too late. The last thing I remember is the blinding glare of the headlights. After that, there were doctors and hospitals and snores. Now Im back at work, but a little wiser than I was when I woke up this morning. Gosh, what a weird day it has been so far. Tonight I am hanging out with a friend of mine from high school. Her name is Hannah and she and I have known each other since I was a freshman. Thats the longest I have known any friend. She and I dont talk or see each other often, but every time we spend time together, I enjoy it immensely. It will be great to catch up with her and she always makes me laugh so hard. Im looking forward to it. Last night was our first official read through of Stupid Kids . I am falling madly in love with the cast. Everyone is smart and funny and seemingly talented. (Will get a better feel for that as the weeks progress). There is no problem making conversation either and no one is a show off or name dropper; which in acting, is a rare find. Ian, the guy who plays my partner in the show, and I get along very well so far. Last night he and I talked quite a bit about our lives. He is easy to talk to and pretty interesting. He also exudes so much sex appeal, but is (fortunately) so not my type. I am really hoping to develop a true friendship with him through this experience. Especially since he is straighter than straight and has to make out with me for the next 3 months. It is going to be so weird to kiss a straight boy. I mean, as I have said in this journal, I have been known for kissing my fair share of straights, but this time, I really believe that he is. I wont be trying to turn him gay and thats new for me. Plus, if I start to develop ANY feelings for him at all, I have to do Kellys laundry. Fuck you Ian. I aint doin no motha fuckas motha fuckin laundry. YEAH. yeah. Kelly and our friend, Angie, are going to see Ani Difranco perform tonight. That was a boring story. Want to see where Paul and I are staying in the Bahamas? SHO you do. Here it is: urlLink Bahama Trip! Fun, right? Oh please, you dont even KNOW me. Im getting my gut something to eat!

 My comments are acting like a bitch. I have just about had it with the entire Klink family. What should I use instead??

 Just got back from having a wonderful hour of sunbathing in Riverside Park. I figure that I really have to start getting myself a base tan if I am going to be heading off to the Bahamas in a week and a half! UM! YAY! So I had a minor freak out last night when I realized that not only do I not have a Passport, I dont have my Drivers License renewed. When you turn 26 in NY, you have to get a new license and re-take the eye test, etc. Whatever, I kept putting it off cuz it costs $50. Now I have to get up at the crack of dawn tomorrow and go to the DMV in order to get it taken care of. Most likely I will not have the actual license until after I get back from the Bahamas, but I will have the temporary one on me at all times. I hope that works for Bahaman bars. I called the travel company today in a panic when I thought that I needed a passport. They informed me that I only need my birth certificate and a picture ID. Since I wont have my license by then, she said that my work ID would be okay. I hope she was right, cuz otherwise, I will be spending my time at the Bahamas, fighting with the John F. Kennedy airport security. Can anyone calm my nerves on this and re-assure me that all I do need is a birth certificate and a picture ID? For some reason the travel agent didnt squelch any of my fears. OohI definitely got some color today. Rock. So I boofed just now and poop almost came out. Maybe I should go take a little shit. Paul and I are doing extremely well these days. We actually got up a little early this morning and talked in bed before we had to leave to go to our respective jobs. We have never done that before. Usually I have to leave a lot earlier than he does, so I just let him sleep. Last night we were up laughing so hard for so long that I almost burst with happiness. We had a discussion about the Ahmad thing and about future hook-ups. He said that he is totally cool with the fact that I may want to hook up with other people besides him. (Especially since we are still not hooking up these days.) But he is really uncomfortable with me dating anyone else or pursuing any other type of relationship. I told him that I understood and that I thought that was fair. It was the first time in as long as I can remember that we had a conversation of this nature and didnt end up slicing each others faces off in the process. Are Paul and Joe actually becoming a real couple afterall?? I mean, it has been 3 years, 7 months, and 6 days. Bout motha fuckin time. So I am quite the celebrity at work what with my HUGE face in the paper. My boss wants me to photocopy it so that he can put it up in my building for when the students return. I told him that I thought the idea was CRAZY, but he insists on me doing it. Ugh. Hi students! Welcome back! Look at my fat head in the newspaper! How was YOUR summer? Oh yeah, theyll just love it. My dad is CONVINCED that I could get a commercial deal with Sprint out of this whole thing. I tried so hard to explain to him that it just doesnt happen that way. He refused to believe me and said that my situation is just like Jareds. You know Jared dont you? The Subway sandwich loser guy. But Joe! Look at Jared. He wont have to work another day in his life! Oh yeah dad? Well, I hope that I dont become Jared for a number of reasons; mostly being that I dont want to be known as the fatty who became skinny from eating Veggie subs all day. Oh Joe, I figured you wouldnt make the most out of this opportunity, but what do I know? Yeah dad. You are right. Ill think about it. NEVER. My parents seem to think that if you are blessed to have your picture in the paper, you should consider it an open opportunity for fame and fortune. I tried to explain that if that were true, there would be no regular people in the world. Everyones been in the paper at some point, for some thing, and we dont have a gazillion celebrities running around. But nooooooooo.Im lazy and missing out on my chance to make it big. Achoo. Scuse me. Hes just trying to help and I LOVE him for it. But I just need an agent. Then they can deal with my dads great big ideas. He wants me to make it so badly he can taste it. And so do I. But the subconscious pressure that comes from all of this makes me want to call up the Daily News and have them retract the whole thing. Sike never. But you understand. Turtle head turtle head how are you today? Very very well my friend, can I come out to play? Turtle head turtle head why do you hurt me so? Well you trap me inside your bowels, you fucking little ho. Turtle head turtle head, are you trying to hurt my heart? Let me out your sphincter, or Ill juicify your fart. Turtle head turtle head, you have won this round. I will win them all and here comes poop with sound. Peace out yall!

 One more thing... I am working on a blogger for my past theater performance pics. For my resume, etc. I started it in April and am really using it as a place to store the links I find, until I have some time to organize the page. But for now... If you want a good laugh...click here . (sike...the link has been removed now. It was only there for ONE day. If you missed it, you missed it. SORRY) Could my mouth BE any bigger? shut the fuck up chandler. Shut up now and forever.

 Drop it like its hot, drop drop it like its hot. SO! The Daily News article came out yesterday. I dont know if you read down after Fridays post to see me freaking out about the preview they put in Fridays paper. Well, yesterday morning at 7am, my phone began ringing off the hook. I stayed in bed not answering, so afraid that I was going to hate the picture or that even worse, they wouldnt use it in the real article. Eventually I got out of bed and walked to the local convenience store to buy a couple copies. I got home, I sat, and I opened up the paper and my eyes BUGGED out of my head. Not only is the picture IN the paperit is the COVER of the Lifeline section! HAHAHAHAHA! No for real! It was a FULL-page picture. I pooped my pants immediately, then I burst out laughing, then I almost cried, then I went in to my bedroom to think about what had just happened. God, how could I have pooped in my own pants?? I smoked a cigarette and stared at the picture for about 20 long minutes. It doesnt look like me at all? I thought to myself. I must weigh close to 350# in the picture I worried to myself. This is so surreal I finally decided. The article was pretty good too. I was happy with the quotes she used and yeah! It was a complete thrill. Supposedly, they sell the Daily News around the country, so my dad went out yesterday and bought every copy they had in the local CVS. My uncles did the same in San Francisco. I bought two copies and plan on laminating them so I can stare at myself for the rest of my life. LAME! Okay, thats it. Do you want to see it? Promise you will be nice to me about it? I dont really look like I am pregnant in real life, but as you know, sometimes the camera adds babies to your otherwise non-baby filled stomach. Whatever. Here is the internet version of the article. (sike, the link has been removed. YOU missed it. I'm sorry.) In other newsI am off to visit my friend Rita this weekend. Really looking forward to it. ROCK. More newsI leave for my Bahamas vacation a week from Saturday. UM! Still some newsmy niggle has healed. There is still a tiny bump, but it doesnt hurt at all anymore. Sorry for freaking out about itits justwellits my niggle. And I dont like when niggles hurt. And finallyI am going to get a new checking account today. Thats pretty fun, since Chase Manhattan Bank sucks a fatty. They charge you fees for everything and I am TIRED of that nonsense. Alrightthats it for now. urlLink Now and Laters . Yum.

 Okay, so I know I don't post on weekends, but tonight is a big deal. Regardless of the fact that I'm wasted and already typed this post once, I will continue to do it up. It's just that I have to tell you something. I AM IN THE Daily News paper today. Do you have any idea how hard it was to put the HTML of italics in just now. So hard. Anyhow... Kelly and I went out for a few quick drinks tonight with Mariah. Well, Joanna shows up and she's like"Joe, have you seen the newspaper today?? I'm like "Hells no." Cuz well, hells no. She then opens up the paper and there under "Coming Sunday" is MY PICTURE about not having a cell phone. No seriously. (I am dying laughing as I type this). And also so wasted. But I am trying my best to be serious. HAHAHAHAHAHAHA! My picture is in the fucking Daily news. Fuck italics. Right under Cameron Diaz's stupid plug is MY fat ass being like "I have NO REGRETS about not having a cellie in the city". Like I ever said that I have "No regrets". Like I would EVER say that. Cuz honestly, I WANT a cell phone. I'm just poor and can't get one. But the PREVIEW of the article makes it out like I am so happy to not have a cellie. In the pic, I am gazing off into the sky being like "Oh thank God that cell phones don't exist in my world." Sick. They made me out to be such a loser. But whatever...hahahahaha I'm in the newspaper. This is why it's cool: colon and then explain sorry, speaking out loud. Joanna said to me tonight: "Joe, they interviewed like 4 or 5 people for this article, including me, and they chose YOUR picture out of all of them to put into the paper." Now maybe she was saying that only because when I saw the picture I vomited on myself twice, but she made it out to be the biggest deal and you know what...to me it IS! AY YI YI! The minute I got home from the bar, I called everyone I loved. My parents Rita Paul. "Guess what??? I'm in the fucking paper!" They chose MY pic! However sick it is, they chose my PIC! Do you have any idea how AMAZING I feel right now? Gosh, so amazing. Thank you lord Jesus. I know that seems ridiculous, but to me.... the wannabe actor to have his picture in the paper...and like a HUGE REAL picture...to me...it's God. Giving me the little boost that I need. snores. Done. But really...YAY. I miss my Reets. I called her immediately after I called my parents and actually I am calling her again right now. I just want to share this with her. SO badly. Joe is in the paper. Can I be more obnoxious about it? It's just the biggest deal to me. Wow. Look...I have no idea how jumbled all of this sounds. I am typing, for the most part, free style. I am not about to go back and edit out my bullshit at this point. I'm in the paper and what up. If you don't like this entry, then you don't like that I'm in the paper and I don't know how to be friends with you if you don't realize that this is a big deal for me right now. hahahaha. sike. But totally sorta sike. Cuz, I'm in the paper. Under Cameron Diaz. OKAY! So I just had a very long talk with Mariah. It was probably one of the best "phone talks" we've ever had. Basically cuz Rachel was in the room while we were talking and it was all "Is Rizzle listening?" "Yes, shizzle is hizzle." "Okay, so let me ask you this", I say, "Is rizzle being a bizzle?" "Yizzle your quizzle." HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA cuz shizzle. It was funny and great and I'm in the paper and way too exicted about it. Alright, I'm outtie. Sike...major diatribe coming... I want to thank the following people: (Look my first famous speech) Rita. Cuz without Rita, there isn't a Joe. For rizzle. Kelly. Cuz without Kelly, I would be totally alone. Mariah. Cuz without Mariah, I wouldn't smile, laugh, or grow nearly as much as I did tonight. My parents. They are everything. Paul. For never being around during the important events. ARI. For being the first person I called to share my news with. I know that she is an avid reader of the DAILY NEWS. And when I called her to tell her that I was in the paper, she was tired, but proved herself to be an incredibly important friend of mine when she immediately asked: "Are you going to send the picture to Winfield?" WOw. Thank you Ari. Now my journalers...I love this. How fun. A Girl Named Bob...for being the first journaler I fell head over heels in love with. You know Bob, my friend Rita got me into this whole journal thing. Hence my thanking her for me being Joe. But her first big journal inspiration is/was PAMMIE. PAMMIE.Com is pretty big now, but hearing the way she talked about Pammie, reminds me of the way I talk about your journal. It's what I want mine to be. Okay, I know I'm drunk and gushing ridiculously about you, but honestly...at some point a forum needed to be presented to me so that I could explain my profound love for your journal. You're exactly what I want my journal to turn into. The end. Drowning Fish...You captivate me more than anyone else. Your stories peak my interest in the way a dirty soap opera would. I know it sounds like a half-compliment, but the truth lies in this: You choose to do an online journal, like the rest of us, but your story is real and intriguing. You instigate feeling and opinion in your journal. Sometimes I walk away from your writings thinking that you are wrong to be doing what you are doing, and sometimes I walk away thinking...thank God she IS doing what she's doing. You instigate opinion in me. And for me, that is rare in online journalers. I LOVE your journal. Sassy...cuz you are the pioneer of women when it comes to this whole thing. You took a journal that wasn't known and in the process of 6 months turned it into an icon. Yes, your writing is good. Yes you are honest and true. But the thing that stands out most about you, is your sincere care for your readership. Most people want the numbers, as do you and I, but you make sure that each number is respected. You send out mugs. You give sass love. You are making a name for youself and I think that if you keep up with this journal thing...you got yourself a copywrited, full fledge novel on your hands. Damn girl. You got fired, cuz you are too good. T-bone. T-bone is my internet crush. I know we talk about them. Well, I don't really. I love you all. But of course I am gay, and I have an internet crush too. And it's a boy. Buv course. But I am not crushing on T-bone in a physical way. I mean, is he a bodybuilder, cuz I don't think so. He's not about that shit. He has a wife and a cutlet and he comes across like the most PERFECT husband and man any woman would want. He truly cares about his life and he is happy with it. Very rare to find that. He reads all of our journals every single day. He takes time and puts in the effort to be that guy and I, for one, truly respect it. It seems that every time I go to post a comment on someone's site, T-Bone has already been there and said a wittier comment in his three minutes than I could come up with in my 37. Whatever. T-bone, I have a crush on your journal. As I am sure that quite a few others do. But guess what? I bet I'm the only guy that crushes on your journal. So whatever, you're a gaylord. :) Chevy Valentine. We don't visit too much, but I will always consider you my original sister blogger. We started together and in my opinion we finish together. You are Joe's girl. No matter how insignificant that may seem. Jedi Nord...you straight ass brotha. Tango me again and I might fall in love with you too. It's just cute when a straight guy is really sweet and supportive of a gay guy, no questions asked. That's all I need to give someone the AOK. I'm tough on people, but when you're the Nord, you're in. Cati Cati Cati...my sweet and darling Cati. Of everyone I read, you're the one I want to know the most. YOur emails, your posts, your every being...I wonder about you. If there weren't such a thing as online journals, I feel that you and I would have crossed paths at some point, regardless. I have no idea what you look like, but I picture you to be one of the most beautiful creatures that has walked the earth. I know, lame. But really, you are my internet fantasy. Not that I would want to do you. Obviously. But I would want to be your friend. Badly. It takes quite a lot for someone to upset me over the internet, but when I thought that you posted something about me being an asshole, I got literally upset. I stressed and checked my journal every five minutes for some sort of clarification. You are cool. Very cool. And we think exactly alike. I don't want us to ever fight. Especially since some day, I know we are going to be real friends. I just know it. Okay...I will end this soon...but I'm finding it to be so much fun. April - You make me laugh so hard. You are my subconcious. Sometimes I read your journal and I'm like "Is she serious? Did she just say that and really mean it?" Cuz HAHAHAHAHAHA! You get away with it too. That's the best part. You are my subconcious. You say the things that I want to say so badly, but instead I'm like "LYLAS!" and "BE GOOD!". I like you. I like you as my partner in crime. I think we could do some serious damage. Okay, serious note... Keol, thank you. For changing my life. You've been through alot and gosh I don't know what to say that sums up what I think. Girl, get comments on your site and keep writing the way you do. Everyone...read her journal and take it for what it is. She's got alot to say and so much of it will blow you away. Not so simple - Are you serious? You are the best writer ever and I hate you. LOL!!! (okay, what am I...12?) (kinda) (I really wrote "LOL") I love your journal and you have such a nice site with writing samples and snores! Why can't I have writing samples and pictures and stuff? I want my site to be respected like your site. I think it every day. Every time I click on "Not so Simple", I'm like "How is she going to be upstaging me once again?". Sike. I just really like everything you do and say. You're funny and real and honestly, an excellent writer. Rock. WINDOWSILL WENDY...how could I possibly not write about her until now?!?! Holy shit I love the wendy. FIrst of all...have you seen a picture of her? Cuz YOWZAH! The girl is a knock-out. And the best part of it all is that she is self-effacing and real. She is non-stop support and non-stop love. I read this girl and I think...Am I gay? No seriously...am I gay? Cuz having someone like her in your life must be the greatest priviledge. I don't know too much about her relationship with THE JOKER. (And I just LOVE that Joker) She just comes across as like the coolest and most chill prom queen you ever met. As I said, she is a knock-out. But so real and introspective and cute and am I serious? Wendy, go away. It makes me think that online gayness isn't hereditary. Indigo Steve, I love you. I smile at your pictures and I will be your best friend always. You are my boy. If there was ever a fight, I would scratch and claw anyone's face to make sure that Max Casella was safe and sound. You know how it is. Okay, I've got to stop now. I could go on and on for hours, but my buzz is wearing thin. I just typed and typed so much love that I feel like I could puke in my garbage can. Okay, maybe that's the 307 vodka tonics I had tonight. I just feel like I don't take my journaling community as seriously as I should sometimes. I've had this site for a year and a half and it really wasn't until just recently that I felt truly affected by the support system that comes about from this whole thing. I remember writing Indigo Steve one time saying "I don't really read other people's journals and write them e-mails". Cuz at the time, I didn't. But now, my mind and my heart is so much more open to this whole experience. I am proud of my journal and I am SO PROUD of my readership. I mean, you guys gave me money for my upcoming show. You guys sent me e-card after e-card for my birthday. You write me the nicest stuff when I am feeling like shit. Seriously...fuck. Wow. Thank you. Look, if I act all gushy sometimes, it means that things are going well in my life. And when I feel good, I want nothing more than for my friends and family to feel good as well. I think you understand. But sorry that I couldn't put links to each of your sites when I spoke about you. I don't know HTML and I copy and paste the code every time I do it on my site. And when I'm at home, I don't have the code. So stop being so concerned about publicity and take a true compliment for once. hahahahahahahahahaohmanI'madick. So if tonights entry was "too long" and "full of drunken ramble" then fine. For once I didn't look at this journal as "my next post". I looked at it as a way of saying everything that was in my mind and in my heart. And if that's overbearing, then put your fingers in your ass and love it. hahahaha. Always end on a fingers in the ass reference. It's really the way to go. Goodnight my babies.

 The old Joe vs. The new Joe Lets begin. You seeI went to a very STRAIGHT man college. There were like 5 gay people there and they were scary as fuck. And without exaggerating at all, I was the ONLY gay male in the theater department there. I know, I know. Theater? Filled with gays! But not at my college. At my college, even the gay kids were straight. So, since I couldnt really date anyone, I would meet straight guys that I thought I could TURN gay with just a little bit of coaxing and a lot bit of patience. Through my last two years at college, I attempted to change over 4 different guys. 3 of them ended up making out with me and staying in my bed. Pretty great accomplishment if I do say so myself. But once I left school and moved to big cities (ie: Boston and NYC), I realized that my days of turning straight people gay were over. Thankfully. There are enough gays in these cities that it would be foolish of me to still find the need to mess around with pseudo straight guys. Why bother? For the most part, this change has happened without incident. That is until last night. We had our first cast meeting at a bar called REVIVAL . It went wonderfully and I drank way too much, as my nerves were brittle and breaking. Ian, the guy I have to fall in love with during the show, revealed himself to be a very opinionated, extremely intelligent, chauvinistic, hottie. At one point, he was quoted at saying Halle Barre only won the Oscar for Monsters Ball because she laid down and put her feet up in the air. Um. Yeah. But for some reason, Ian can say this nonsense and still come off like a stud. During one of our cigarette breaks, Kelly bet me that I would, at some point, have feelings for Ian. That I would go for him, regardless of my belief that straight men are a waste of my time. The minute we started talking about it, I got a bit nervous inside. What if I DO end up having feelings for him? What if I cant help it and the old Joe comes forward and takes over? I know it sounds ridiculous, but old habits die hard. In any case, the bet is on. I will do WHATEVER it is I have to do in order to avoid falling head over gay heels in fake love with Ian. Wish me luck. Oh by the way, if I win the bet, Kelly has to do my laundry. And in a town where doing laundry is the biggest inconvenience, I am surely going to LOVE watching her cart my huge bag to the cleaners. Heh heh heh. We also made another bet about whether or not Evanescence sings Bring me to Life. She thought it was T.A.T.U., I knew she was wrong, shook her hand, and now she has to do my laundry even sooner than was expected. I was like Kelly, youre NOT GONNA GET IT! hahaha lamest lyrical reference of the day. What else? Have you ever stopped to think that other people are masturbating about you? This morning as I sat on the subway, this random guy kept staring at me. I would look away, fake yawn, do a little cough, only to see that nothing deterred him from staring at my face. He stayed that way until I finally got off at my subway stop 50 blocks later. During the walk to my office, I thought about the chance that the guy who was staring at me went home and feverishly jerked off his penis. I am sure it has happened to all of us at one point or another. Hells knows that Ive jerked off about people Ive known or just seen on the subway. But when its the other way around, its kind of violating. Cuz its their fantasy, not yours. And you are left to wonder if they are closing their eyes and making you pee all over yourself while they lick your armpits. You understand. So I keep getting these credit card applications saying that I am pre-approved. Yet, every time I send in the forms, I get this horrifying letter back telling me that there is a delinquency on my credit report that prevents them from issuing me a credit card. So I finally wrote a letter asking for a free copy of my report. Now I sit here in FEAR that my statement is going to come and there is going to be an overdue bill on there that I didnt know about. What if its like $1,000? Or a million dollars? Or even worse, what if its for $400 and I have to actually pay it? I dont have $400. I didnt even have $50 to buy a new pair of shoes. Oh the woes of being a poor actor in NYC. At what point do I just give up and move away to a financially stable home in suburbia? Yuckowitz. I hate money. But I love yuckowitz. Thanks for that one Reets. OH! If you sent me an email over the last week, I have lost it. There was a problem with my Hotmail account. Virus or something and I was forced to expunge all of the emails in my inbox. So please dont hate me if I didnt write you back. I dont remember who I owe emails too and I dont want anyone to think that I ignored your PRECIOUS little writing to me. PRECIOUS golum golum. ONE LAST THING Please welcome the urlLink Renee Chronicles ! She is one my new loves. Alrightlove ewe. And also love pizza. Can my belly go away now so I can have some? Have a great weekend yall. Im going to stick my fingers in my ass I think. You do the same.

 Yeah. Three weeks ago, we auditioned this kid, Brad, for our show Stupid Kids . The script calls for the other character to give my character a titty twister. Purple nurple, tune in tokyo, whatever you wish. Well, the kid who was auditioning grabbed my tit and twisted it so hard that for the last 3 weeks I have had a yellowish bruise around my nip. Fine. I can deal with that. Its ugly, but I can deal with that. BUT THEN! This morning I wake up to find that my entire left nipple is swollen and there seems to be a rock hard substance beneath the skin. It is incredibly painful. I have run my fingers over the nipple about a thousand and one times and I cant figure out what the solid deposit could be made of. urlLink Ari has inspected the nipple and she seems to think that its just a bad bruise. But do bruises get pregnant with hard deposits? I dont know. Either way I could kill that fucker right about now. Good thing we didnt cast his violent ass in the show. Otherwise I would be severely scared of the scene that calls for him to knife me in the gut. Sike, there is no such scene. But still, Id be scared of him twisting and hurting my innocent niggles. Yes I wrote niggles. Love it. Anyhoodles, tonight is our first cast meeting! AY YI YI! We are all meeting at a bar at 7pm to get to know one another. I am kind of nervous, kind of excited, but also dreading it. I dont want to spend any money on this event, but even moreso I dont want to get to know these people WITHOUT alcohol, so I guess the best decision was made. Can I just NOT be so poor? I couldnt even buy myself a new pair of kicks. Luckily Ari came to the rescue on that one and got me a pair for my birthday. Do you think they sell nipples for a reasonable price at Walmart? I could surely use a new one. To me, Nick Lachey is really really hot. He has a new reality show coming out called Newlyweds and supposedly it chronicles his and Jessica Simpsons first year being married. Okay, I HATE Jessica Simpson, but mostly because she gets to have Nick Lachey in her vaginer. The show itself will probably be LAME CITY USA, but as long as he takes his shirt off every time hes in front of the camera, I dont care. Id watch him take a shit if he had his shirt off. (HORK!) Its just that he is so damn phyne. And I am so damn swollen from that jerkoff dickhead that twisted my niggle. Do you think if someone looks up niggle on Google, they will come across my site and think that Im a facist. Er, I mean racist? Cuz honestly, fuck you. Dont judge me. Today I bought a three-pack bar of soap. Big news, right? Well kinda. Cuz I bought urlLink Coast bar soap for the first time in my life. Supposedly it wakes you up with its refreshing deodorant smell. I only bought it cause the commercials seem so convincing. I figure, why not try out a little test of my own. Okay, I guess not such big news, huh? Oh IM sorry. Are you BORED? Yeah, well fine. I didnt know that this journal was called For your interest only! Shit. Im spicey today, right? I dont know why. I dont feel spicey. In all actuality, I feel ricey. You know, cuz of my Asian hair. Okay, should I have called this post Doing my best to offend all ethnicitys? Cuz really. I need to stop. Im 26 now and we dont make jokes like that when we are 26. At 26, we make jokes like this: What do you call a fly with no wings? Well, A WALK of course! HAR HAR HAR HAR HAR. Okay, wanna hear the most ridiculous part about that joke? I am so braindead to jokes that I had to look up Lame Jokes on the internet and thats what I came up with. I did find one kinda funny one. Wanna hear it? Fuck yourself then. Here it is: What do you call a person with leprosy in a bathtub? Stew oh THATS rich. Righty Oh. I am off for today. Enjoy your Thursday evening. Whatever you decide to do with it. You stupid niggle.

 By the time you teach her Rappuhs Delite, she gone fuhget Juicy. By the time you teach her Juicy, she gone fuget Rappuhs DeLITE! --- Babs (Making the Band 2) Guess whos back? Back again. Joeys back. Tell a friend. HI!!! Totally my bad. Who do I think I am anyway? Someone with a real life? Never. Lets immediately get down to business, since I dont have an excuse big enough to make up for my lazy lack of posting. Here are the things I need to discuss: The present from Ahmad. Yeah. Well, Ahmad came to have lunch with me LAST WEDNESDAY (wow, been a long time) and brought my present with him. After lunch, we went down to the auditorium in my building so I could open up my gift in private. He wrote a beautiful card and the present was wrapped up all nice and shit. Now remember, the present was supposed to exemplify how well Ahmad knows me. I was nervous, excited, and totally curious. When I opened up the gift, guess what it was? No guess. No really Hells, youd never be able to guess. It was the urlLink Pasta Pro . Do you know of the Pasta Pro? Its the pasta pot with a built in colander. The second I saw it, I looked into his eager eyes and said Oh wow! The Pasta Pro! My parents got me that for my birthday too! Ahmads face fell and he said Why didnt you tell me that? I wanted my gift to you to be something that you really wanted. I reply No I DID really want it. And I love that you listen to me when I talk. I just didnt think to tell you that my parents had already given it to me. I feel terrible. Im sorry. We hugged and I thanked him over and over. Then I said goodbye to him and offered to give one of my Pasta Pros to Ari. I was a bit disappointed in the gift, but I really shouldnt have been. How dare I? Ahmad has known me for a month and he really went out of his way for me, what with making me dinner and baking me a cake and all that jazz. But, I thought maybe he'd get me a new car or something. Ah wellwill have to work on my gold-digging skillz. NowPaul on the other hand. I showed up at his apartment at 5:30pm last Wednesday. I was told to get there as soon as I could. When I walked in the door, Paul was standing in the bathroom door, butt-naked, shaving his face. I looked at his cock and said Is that a drip of CUM on your cock? Paul quickly looked down and goes Oops. Yes. What is WRONG with you? Its my birthday and youve already made sure to masturbate so there is no chance of us hooking up tonight. How could you start the night like this? Im sorry Joe, I was horny. Wipe up your dick and lets do whatever it is you have planned. When Paul got out of the bathroom, he told me that we would watch The Simpsons until 8pm, cuz that is when we had our reservations for dinner. Wait. Do you mean to tell me that we are going to smoke a bowl and go to dinner for my birthday? Yes Joe. Is that not good enough? Honestly Paul, its not. Thats what we do EVERY night. I thought that maybe you would plan something fun for us to do. Dinner is fun and you are being selfish and greedy. WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA? Its my birthday! How could I even BE selfish and greedy? Just stop it. Lets watch TV and get ready for dinner. 10 minutes later I started to cry. WHY ARE YOU CRYING?!?!?! Because I decided to spend my birthday evening with just you and you havent planned shit for us. In fact, I am SURE you waited until this afternoon to plan dinner. I should be seeing my friends, who I know would take me out and plan something fun. But it is so TYPICAL of you to forget about the entire thing and to quickly throw something together. Im going home. Dont be so dramatic. (Tears flowing out of my face) You are the WORST boyfriend on the planet. I will never forget this day. FUCK YOU JOE! We are going to a show at 8pm, but you had to go and ruin it! silence. huh? We are going to a show and if you could just wait an hour without freaking out silence. oh. Yeah. Well now I feel like such an asshole! Why do you have to hurt my feelings in order to surprise me? After that we started the night over. We had some wine and got ready to go see urlLink De La Guarda . The show was fucking mind-blowing. I shouldn't explain to you what it was about, but if you EVER have the chance to go see it, you would be FOOLISH to miss it. Definitely the best and most surprising thing I have seen in years. After dinner, Paul took me to Brasserie on 52nd street. It was by FAR the nicest and most expensive dinner I have ever had the pleasure of taking part in. We had numerous appetizers, bottles of champagne, and I got the swordfish for dinner. The price of dinner came to $255. UM. He even stopped and bought me dessert on the way home. It was an absolutely wonderful evening and Paul secured his spot in my heart once again. It wasnt about the money, but rather the fact that he actually planned something, wrote me a nice card, and made sure that I was happy all night long. We laughed and laughed and laughed until we went to bed, happy as gay bugs in a gay bed. The birthday party I had planned went off pretty smoothly, but to be honest, was my least favorite part of the weekend. The highlight of our night out was that Kelly got a bodybuilder to pick me up and give me a hug. Mmmmmmthat was the hottest. Also, Mariah and Joanna gave me wonderful gifts and everyone treated me really well. It just wasnt the night I had originally envisioned. The 4th of July was amazing! We drank beers and margaritas all day and smoked tons of the pot. We hung out on Mariahs rooftop in Brooklyn and got ourselves a sweet tan. We were also able to watch the fireworks up there. The whole day and night was excellent. There are more details, but why bore you with them? You only care about dicks and vagina. And thats that! I feel very lucky to have the friends that I do. They made the whole weekend special and fun. At no point did I want to be anywhere else. I loved my birthday, although anti-climactic at the party. In other news, I got a letter from my other urlLink prisoner pen-pal . He wrote me the nicest letter and I have now decided that the only friends I want to have in my life are people with jail terms. They have nice bodies, are confident and strong, and will take care of me always. Theres just that little detail of them wanting to slice off my face, but whatever. Ill risk it. I already wrote Carlos back. I hope we fall in love some day. I havent talked to Ahmad since my birthday. As each day goes by, I start feeling even guiltier than I felt the day before. I am convinced that he hates me now. I plan on calling him this afternoon to touch base, but I think he is going to spit on the receiver and put it near his ass so he can fart on me. Why wouldnt he? I took the present he had for me and never called again. Its just that Paul and I are doing really well now and Id like to give our relationship another chance. I told Paul that I would make a decision about Ahmad before the Bahamas trip. He says that I should make my decision now. Although I know that Ahmad and I need to call it off, I am not so sure I want to call off every possibility I have of meeting someone else. Im doing my best to just play it by ear and to take it day by day, but that shit is boring and nothing ever gets solved that way. Secretly I must love the drama. Oh please, openly I must love the drama. OkI think thats it! I hope this entry will serve as my penance. Work has been a nightmare lately, so I havent had the chance to catch up with all of you. But I will make SURE to find time to do so in the next couple of days. I can PROMISE you that. And I can also promise you that I will not eat pizza. Mariahs birthday card to me had a picture of she and I on the front and I had a HEART ATTACK when I realized how humungous I have gotten over the last couple of months. It used to be funny before. Not its just plain sick. urlLink This is the size of my belly. AYUK AYUK. Peace be with you my friends and lesbians.

 WAAAAAAAAAAAAAY to busy at work to write today and will not be home later. Sorry for the lack of postness. Promise to fill everyone in on all of the fun tomorrow. Please dont hate me. And Please dont miss me too much. I love you with the love of a thousand corpses.

 SO! I have just finished getting ready for my sweet 26th birthday party. I am MAD excited, to say the least. The John Mayer CD is playing in the background while I type this and I am wearing the new shirt that my friend Angie got me. I must say, I look pretty fly tonight. Love handles or not. I am currently chugging down a Corona Light and getting my mind ready for the next two days. Only me would plan a party that spans over 36 hours. I hope everyone is in for a raging good time, since I am in a raging kind of mood. Last night Paul showed me the TIME of my life. I have so much to say about it, but will be forced to explain at a later date. Let's just say that I was treated like a prince. He was the most perfect gentleman. I felt so lucky to have him last night. Gosh, it was beautiful. Today I bought myself a new pair of shoes, thanks to my dear friend Ari. They cost me only $5 more than what she had given me and they are FUH FUH FUH FLYYYYYYYYYYY! I am happy. And my feet have finally stopped screaming at me. So I guess all is good in that area. I got my picture taken for the Daily News today and it was less than fun. He showed me a few of the pictures after he took them and I was like "SICK! WHO IS THAT FAT ZITTY GAYLORD OF A FREAK PRETENDING TO BE ON THAT PAYPHONE?!?" So, needless to say, if they come out poorly, none of you will be able to see it. I am not about to let the first time my face is shown to be ugs. You understand. Kelly got me the most amazing gift ever! She is taking me to see the show Take Me Out . It's a Broadway play (my first!) about a gay baseball player. Not only have I heard that the show is incredible, there are naked boys throughout the entire production. YAH HOOOOOOO! We go at 3pm on Sunday. She's the breast. I am just loving my birthday. I always get so worked up about it in my head. You know, like it's not going to turn out exciting or fun. But every year it does. And this year is no exception. My friends are all showing up at 9pm to have some champagne and then we are off to the bars. There is only one thing I wish I could change about this evening. I wish my Rita could be here. It's times like this that I miss her the most. Whenever something big happens in my life, all I want is for Rita to share it with me. Luckily I am going to visit her next weekend in Syracuse. Her birthday present to me is a free roundtrip ticket. I mean, who could ask for a better gift? Not only do I not have to pay to see her, I get to spend a whole 48 hours with her. It's unreal. It's surreal. It's how I wish we could spend every day. Just like old times. Gosh, I miss her. Alright...off to put the final touches on my makeup. The lipstick I got just isn't working. I might have to run out to Sephora real quick and grab a new color. SIKE! LATAS LOVAHS! YAY BIRTHDAY!

 YAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAY AYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYA YAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAY AYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYA YAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAY AYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYA YAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAY AYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYA YAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAY AYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYA YAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAY AYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYA YAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAY AYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYA YAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAY AYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYA YAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAY AYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYA YAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAY AYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYA YAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAY AYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAY! HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO MEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! WOOOO HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Today has been AWESOME so far! I feel naturally happy and excited about what is in store for me. Everyone at work has been incredibly sweet and they even got me some cards and presents. urlLink Ari gave me a gift certificate to buy new shoes, which if I havent said it enough, I desperately need. The sole on my right foot is almost completely ripped off. urlLink Ari , in her divine wisdom, and motherly care, thought to get me a gift that I really NEEDED. Thank the Lord. I would have had to spend my day with one shoe on and one flapping in the wind! Also, member how I did that interview with the Daily News about living in NYC without a cell phone? Well, the reporter called me this morning and told me that they are INDEED going to take my picture to put with the article. YAYAYAYAYAY!!! Tomorrow at 1pm, I get to go stand at a pay phone in Times Square, pretending that I am making a call to all of my friends. HAHAHAHAHAHA. I am hella excited. My picture is going to be in the paper a week from this Sunday. As soon as I know the link to the article, I will post it so you can all see what I look like. Unless the picture is terrible, in which case, you can keep wondering. I got cards from my uncle and granny, both with money in them. My brother called me from Baghdad to wish me a good day. That was probably the best part of the whole day so far. It meant SO much to me to hear his voice. We had a great talk and I felt very positive when we got off the phone. It was the first time that I havent cried after talking to him. So thats a good thing. Paul is being overwhelmingly sweet today. I stayed at his place last night so that we could ring in my b-day together. I didnt tell him that I was going to stay there, as I wanted to surprise him. Ironically enough, he went to my apartment with a bouquet of flowers, only to find me missing. He then jumped on the subway and found me in his apartment watching TV. In order to make up for me missing out on the flowers, I told him that he could buy me McDonalds. Heh heh heh. It was a pretty sweet deal. I shoved a Big Mac meal in my mouth at 1am. Nothing like making yourself extra blubbery for the birthday celebrations. Paul let me wear his clothes today, which he never does. He is supposed to call me in a bit to let me know what he has planned for tonight. I am pretty excited to spend the evening with him. Honestly, he is the only one I want to be with tonight. Its the first birthday of mine that we have spent together since we met. In the past he lived in Boston and could never make it. But this year I get to spend the actual day with him. I am thrilled. Ahmad is coming up to my office to take me out to lunch. He is bringing his present for me. I have no idea what it could be, but the anticipation is definitely killing me. Remember, he says that the gift will showcase what a good listener he is. Eggselent. I want to thank EVERYONE for sending me E-cards. I couldnt believe my eyes when I opened up my Cut the Shit account this morning and found all of those cards. You all care! You really really do. It makes me want a hot dog REAL bad. Snicker snicks. You are all the BREAST. Thank you from my little gay heart. Rebecca Gayheart. So last night we had the callbacks for the show I am in. They went very well. We cast the guy I wanted and I am bubbling over with nervous excitement. Our first cast meeting is a week from tomorrow. The guy I get to kiss is so adorable and manly. We didnt go with the super hot guy from the first night of auditions. Thank God too. He was a bit scary last night. So scary, in fact, that he made up a full script during our audition. He did like half the lines he was supposed to and completely made up other lines and said them. I just sat there thinking You know, you are so beautiful, but if I ever have to act in another scene with you again, I am going to pee on you. Dehydrated birthday pee, no less. The end. Tomorrow night is my big party. ROCK! Everyone is pretty excited, including me. Well, I HOPE me. It is MY party, afterall. And I will surely cry if I want to. I have no idea what I am going to wear. Ah geezso much to do. We have a huge BBQ planned for Friday. I have to go tomorrow and get the food with Mariah. Damn, so much to do. I am starting to stress a bit. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! So much fun and so much to do. So much to do. Lets all say it one more time: SO MUCH TO DO!!! AY YI YI!! Okay, thaz it! I might not be in here for a couple of days. I am off from work tomorrow and Friday. I will try to stop in this weekend, but if I dontHave a WONDERFUL 4th of July my friends! Thanks again for making my birthday extra special.

 One more day until my BIRFDAY! YIPPEE SKIPS! Last night was the official start to the birthday fun. Ahmad invited me over to his place to celebrate the occasion. We had great conversation, laughed so hard, and we shared things about our lives that we had yet to disclose. On the subway over, I felt anxious about seeing him. Whenever we have intense hook-ups, I always want him out of my life. I dont know how to enjoy sex and Ahmad gets penalized for that. Once we got to talking, I brought the subject up and we had a very enlightening conversation about us and about the relationship that we are pursuing with each other. My anxiety took the back seat after that. Ahmad not only had two bottles of really good Chardonnay waiting for me; he had a bottle of champagne. He made me a birthday dinner, which consisted of cheeseburgers, cheese fries, and Caesar salad. He also made me (from scratch) a carrot cake with cream cheese icing. (All of this and the kid doesnt eat cheese!) At the end of the night, he came into the bedroom with the cake all lit up with candles and sang to me. From his trip to Vegas, he brought me a Ritz Carlton bathrobe, some phone cards, and candy. Tomorrow he is meeting me for lunch and that is when he is giving me my actual birthday present. Although I consider the robe to be my birthday present. I saw the price tag and it was $125. Yikers. I had SO much fun with him. We didnt hook up last night, but we did kiss and hold a lot. I finally went to sleep around 2:30am and had to wake up at 7:15am. Needless to say, I am very much looking forward to my nap this afternoon. Ahmad and I talked at great lengths about my brother and I showed him the letter I got from Baghdad. He is the first person I have shown the letter to and he was the definite right choice. He went on and on about how beautiful my relationship with my brother is and how he cant wait to meet him. He was so supportive and it was nice. I am glad that I showed him the letter first. In other news Member how I wrote two pen pal letters to urlLink prisoners ?? Member how I am crazy and I do shit like that? Well, yesterday I got a letter back from one of the prisoners: urlLink Trent . UM! It was a really amazing letter and the guy was totally cool. He did refute the fact that he didnt kill the person the law said he did, but I dont care either way. This guy is HOTTT and it will be fun to have a pen pal that is beautiful AND dangerous. He has been in Playgirl three times and in the letter he says that he is "bigger and tighter now". Bigger is always better for me. He's too lean in this other pic. The one thing that stood out to me about his letter was how starved he is for human contact. He was honest and straightforward, but thanking me over and over for writing him. I guess jail can be a very lonely place. Who wouldve thought? Tomorrow is my 26th birthday! Here is a little tidbit I bet you didnt know about me: I was born on 7/2/77 at 7:27pm and weighed 7 pounds 2 ounces. Also, my social security number is XXX-72-XXXX. Also, I have 7 fingers and 2 toes. Ha. Sike. But the rest is true! I wonder what that all means. Some day I will have to figure it out. But for now, its just a nice little conversation piece. Right? For example: Hi Barbara! Do you want to know a strange little tidbit about me? I would ask. No., Barbara would say. But Babs, I really want to share something about my life with you. I would say back. I asked you not to call me Babs. Barbara would say firmly. Well you see, I was born on 7/2/77 at 7:27pm and I would begin. **Gunshot** Oh thats real nice Babs. Now Im bleeding. Barbara exits through the window on the left. Seemingly in a hurry. I spent the majority of the morning putting the final touches on my birthday party. YAY! I hope everyone is excited and not too burnt out from Gay Pride Weekend. I also hope people bring me presents, although they totally dont have to. But I also hope that people pay for my drinks when we go out, although they totally dont have to. And one last thing I hope for is solitude. Sike! Imagine I wanted solitude for my birthday? Thats just quazy. Let me introduce you to my FAVORITEST NEW ARTIST! urlLink Jason Mraz !!! (Please take a listen. "The Remedy" was the song that got me into him. But the rest is so good too. He's better than John Mayer. snicker snicks) I adore this kid. His voice is GREAT and I just LOVE his music. I have been playing some of the songs from his new album this morning and I am LURVING it. He does a remake of Kermit the Frogs Rainbow Connection and it is INCREDIBLE. Please spend a minute acquainting yourself with Jason Mraz. He wants me to call him Razzie, but I think thats a bit lame. He will always be Mr. Little Guy Jason to me. You understand. I guess thats it. The next time I write in here, it will be my BIRTHDAY! AY YI YI! (Come on Razzie, lets go get a drink) (No Babs, you cant come)

 VMAS! I will give a detailed recap of the awards show as soon as I can. But for now? For now I go to the Poconos with my ladies of love. Have an amazing Labor Day weekend yall! As usual, engage in tons of debauchery and lusty adventures. Heres something to think about while I am gone: Smelly fish douche! See you on Tuesday!!

 TONIGHT IS THE MTV VIDEO MUSIC AWARDS! Rock. The show goes way too long, but other than that, I am muchly excited. My friend Angie is coming over to watch them with me. She stopped by my place last night and we talked for awhile about her grandmother. Pretty much, things are not going well. There isn't much hope left. I feel terrible for her. Its the last living grandparent that she has. Angie has been in complete control of the situation and I told her that if and when she needs to release some of the pent up emotion, I am here for her. She asked if I would watch the award show with her tonight and I immediately felt like that was the right thing to do. Poor thing. Last night Paul ran lines with me for my show. He was so adorable during the whole thing. He asked me tons of questions about my part in the play and made me laugh over and over. Things are going so well for us right now and I wish I could be with him every day. Im not going to see him again until after Labor Day and that totally blows. I wish things were different and that he could come with me to the Poconos this weekend. I live for the day when my boyfriend will be able to go to events with me, as not only my date, but my lover. Sicklover. Some day maybe. Thank God that Ritas fianc isnt going to the Poconos either. Rita and I have already planned on jumping on each other and French kissing the second we get together. I am going to impregnate her with my tongue. Since Rita planned the trip, she, my friend Erica, and I get to sleep in the big master bedroom at the condo. It sounds AMAZING! We will be like three bugs in a beautiful looking rug. Beautiful because Erica and Rita are Hot City, USA. Actually all the girls are Hot City, Usa. For some reason, these 5 beautiful women wanted to be MY friend in college. Its pretty great. Im totally getting some. Lick my cunt. I have been a VERY bad boy this week. I ate two slices of pizza on Tuesday and today, after I promised myself that I would be healthy, I ate another slice. The grease dribbled off my chin as I stroked my cock in pizza heaven. It was the most erotically disgusting thing that I have ever done. Oh man it was so good. And just to piss Angela off, I had TWO diet cokes today. Take your egg smelling farts and leave me with my oh so delicious soda pop. Ok, can I stop writing like a fucking weirdo today? Last night when I was hanging with Angie, she told me that when she was in Mexico a couple months ago, she was walking down the street and bumped right into a man that was taking a shit on the street. She bumped into him just as the long dook was hanging out of his ass and ready to break off. Startled, she took a step back and saw (with her own blue eyes) the poop string break off and fall to the ground. It was long and nast. I burst out laughing and we decided that the new term for when poop falls out of your ass is breaking point. Angie and I had a good laugh and then I horked all over her face. Think of me tonight as Justin Timberlake performs on stage. Also think of me when Britney and Madonna pretend theyre friends and sing Like a Virgin . Madonnas voice is so weak and destroyed at this point, that I wonder who will be the tighter lip-syncher. MTV says that they ban lip-synching at the awards show, but these two bitches couldnt belt out a tune if you paid them. Oh yeahMTV IS paying them. Be ready for sweet, melodic whispers to come out of their mouths. Do NOT think of me when Kelly Osbourne does anything. Unless she falls flat on her doughy face. Then think of me dying laughing. Do NOT think of me when Christina Aguilera is eating 17 cheeseburgers and wiping the melted cheese all over her sweaty, stupid body. And for the love of Georgia, please dont think of me if any more late 80s, early 90s metal heads jump back into the scene with their rendition of Paradise City. You understand. I gotta take a crap. Enjoy the show!

 After posting Ahmads letter yesterday, I began to feel really guilty about it. It wasnt a very classy thing to do. He didnt deserve that. So in order to put my mind at ease, I decided that I would delete the letter from my journal as soon as I got to work. But then, when I woke up this morning, I decided that I wanted it to stay. Sure, its not classy, but its real, and Im not going to start censoring myself even more than I already do. So, the email stays and I will learn to deal with having no class. Not like I had much to begin with. The end. I never made it to rehearsal last night. Looooooooong story and I would just rather ignore that topic of conversation for now. Instead, I went to Pauls apartment to run lines while he was at his job. I worked on the script for a couple of hours and then finally had to pull myself away from it. Sometimes I get so wrapped up in my acting that I look at the clock and realize that the evening is almost over and I have spent the entire time with my nose in my script. Its the one time of day where I feel passion. Its all encompassing and its a beautiful thing. After I was finished working on the show, I decided to completely re-do Pauls living room and bedroom. The two rooms are connected to each other and were in need of some serious work. I ripped the place apart, vacuumed, dusted, and re-organized everything. I then moved into Pauls bedroom and did the exact same thing. I hung pictures on his walls, folded and organized his dresser drawers and closet and basically sucked the room free of dirt and nast. It wasnt the most fun project of my life, but I knew that he would be surprised when he got home from work. And he was. He was thrilled. Sometimes I am such a good boy. So, while I love the housekeeper at my job, she tends to drive me a little crazy. She considers me to be one of her children and attempts to take care of me as such. She brings me juice and fruit almost every morning and whenever I need anything, she goes out of her way to get it for me. For example, one day I needed toilet paper, so, Angela, put a few rolls into my backpack. One day I needed chocolate syrup (heywe all need certain things at certain times) and Angela got some for me and surprised me with it. In return, I try to take care of anything that she needs: photocopies, postage on her letters, translating broken English into broken Spanish. Its a good balance. However, she is now starting to get on my nerves. First off, she talks to me non-stop. As anyone who has ever worked with me before knows, I dont really like to have hour-long conversations at work. I have a lot to do and I hate wasting time on insignificant banter. Or, I have my work done and really need the extra time to read online journals or play around in gay chat rooms. You understand. And to top all of this offshe now told me that she doesnt want to see me drinking soda anymore at work. Angela: Soda is bad for body. Joe: But Angela, I love soda. I need to drink soda every day or else I lose my mind. A: No Joe. You drink water. J: But I dont like water. It tastes gross. A: Grrrrrross? (she trills rs cuz she is Spanish) J: Water tastes like nothing and I just like drinking some soda during the day. A: No more soda. No more. J: (okayback off!) Fine, I will drink more water, but can I just have a soda once in awhile? A: NO SODA! I have had no soda for years. Some time I have soda, but only one time year. J: (laughing) So you can have soda, but I cant. A: You have soda one time year. J: I have soda one time day. A: No Joe. No soda. J: Fine Angela. I wont drink soda. A: You drink Seltzer soda. J: SICK! Never. I hate seltzer water more than I hate regular water. A: You drink water. J: Huh? A: YOU DRINK WATER. J: Fine. I will. But just cuz you make me drink it. A: No, you go get water now and drink. J: But Im not thirsty. A: OK. Then I get you water drink. J: (ARGH!) No, Ill get it. Thanks Mami (mommy), I will drink water from now on. A: (Smiling and so happy with herself) So now Im stuck drinking water when Angela is around and sneaking up to the soda machine for a quick fix when she is at lunch. Man, it sucks working with your mom. Plus, to be honest, I dont see whats so wrong with soda. Despite the sodium, what else is wrong with it? Theres no calories, no fat, no carbs, no nothing. Its tasty water is what it is. Fucking yum and fucking yum. The only part of the story I left out is that Angela ripped a huge egg fart at my desk as she walked away. She eats tons of vegetable, so her farts are totally rank. I had to breathe through my nose for a good 3 minutes. Its pretty sick. My friend Angie is at the hospital because her grandmother is dying. There is no hope for her at this point and they are currently trying to figure out when would be the most appropriate time to let her go. From what Angie said, her grandmother is completely doped up to decrease her suffering. Its incredibly sad and I feel horrible. I wish I could do more for her, but at this point, I think she just needs to be with her family. Ive been there and my heart breaks for her. Oakily Doakily. Off to lunch. I am so hungry and so in need of pizza, but that just cant be a possibility. I scarfed two slices down yesterday and am not allowed to scarf any down today. That is unless nobody sees me. Then it doesnt count. HO YEAH!

 The most upsetting part of my day Good Morning Joe, This email has been long overdue, but after seeing you on Friday and thinking about our situation a bit more in depth, I concluded that I had to finally be completely honest with you on how I had felt and how I am feeling now. From the day we met, I have felt an incredible connection with you. As you know, I very seldom open myself up to anyone, but with you it seemed easy. I enjoyed spending time with you and looked past and at times ignored your situation with Paul. In retrospect, that was a huge mistake on my part because all it did was confuse you and I even more. I never wanted to listen to what you had to say about where you stood on Paul because always in the back of my mind I figured you would break up with him and we would end up dating and it would all fall into place. I underestimated the extent of your relationship with him, even though, in fairness to you, you tried to tell me in the most delicate of ways. But all I heard and listened to was how much you two were not getting along. All I saw were the little notes you would leave all around my apartment. All I heard were the optimistic things you would say about you and I, the hope that you displayed about having some sort of future with me. All the times we were with one another further made me feel like there was an honest chance that we would end up together. Sex was never as intense, it seemed like there was no one else in the entire world when I held you. No one. Yes, Joe, I fell in love with you. But now, I need to look out for myself. I need some serious time away from you. I know that I said I was ready to be your friend, but I am not. I can not afford to invest anymore time into something that has caused so much confusion and heartache for me. I need for my heart to heal. And during that time, I cant see you or talk with you or be in touch with you. Because if you were part of my life, even in a small way, I would always think of what could be. I would always think of having the chance to introduce you to people as my boy. I dont know when I will be ready to see or speak to you again, only God knows. I do this because it is the fair thing for both of us. I dont want you to always be cautious around me, I do not always want to be thinking that there is a chance of something, because there is not. You and I are too far apart in this period of time in our lives. If God deems for us to meet again, than it will happen and I have all the faith in him to guide our lives in the best of ways. But, I have to say goodbye for now. I do this because this is the best thing for us both. I have to walk away from this and go on with my life without you. But mainly, I do this because I love you, with every fiber of my being. I will always keep you in my prayers along with your brother and loved ones. Amahd While I completely understand where Ahmad is coming from and while I know that he needs to do what he needs to do for himself, it still sucks that no matter WHAT I do, I cant secure any gay male friends. Without sounding like an ego driven asshole, this type of thing happens to me all the time. I dont always hook up with my potential gay male friends, but regardless, they either hate me or love me too much to be my friend. Fuck. Well, such is life. I have to let Ahmad live hishowever he feels most comfortable.

 My head is spinning so fast on its axis that I feel as though I am coked up. Man, I have been running around the office today as though I am on a SPEED high. The day has flown by, but damn, Im actually TIRED from working so hard today. So many things to talk about First things first My visit with Ahmad went wonderfully. At first he was really upset and angry with me. I gave him about an hour to tell me how I hurt him, destroyed his faith in love, and ruined the trust that we had worked so hard to build. When he was finished, I explained my side of the scenario and apologized for hurting his feelings. At the end I gave him the option to either pursue a friendship with me or to cut me off entirely. He decided to keep our friendship. After a couple of hours at the bar, I took him back to my apartment so that we could smoke and chill. I thought that it would be the true test to see if we really could be just friends . It worked out fine. When Ahmad was leaving he told me If you ever feel as though you want to try things out with us again, let me know. But Ahmad, you are dating someone already. Yes, but hes not you. I kissed him on the cheek and he left. It will take us time, but I am sure that if I handle this relationship maturely, I very well may make friends with someone that I have hooked up with previously. Its never happened before, but this time I am determined. SOthere is this girl and her name is urlLink Shy Lux . Turns out that Lux and I went to high school together. Also turns out that she did the high school choir and musical and graduated a year after me. It is IMPOSSIBLE for Lux and I to not know each other. I mean, I was in choir for all 4 years of high school and I just about ate, shat, lived, and breathed the high school theater department. I am positive that we were friends in school. I know it. ButI still dont know who she is. I have put my detective hat on with this mystery and I am bound and determined to figure out who she is. Oohthe suspense is killing me. Luxif we figure out who each other arewe have to promise to keep total anonymity. Promise? Promise with your whole heart? Paul and I had an incredible dinner on Saturday night. He took me to one of the places he works at and everyone treated us like GOLD! We were served just about every entre and appetizer they offered and all for free. Everyone wanted to meet me and I felt as though I was a mini-celebrity. The food was SO GOOD! I had crab cakes and lobster salad and calamari and oysters and filet mignon and champagne and french fries, and my God there was so much more. My stomach was completely distended from all of the food I shoved into my mouth. I kept making Paul poke me in the belly cuz I was totally pregnant. Paul treated me so well, paid for everything, and we laughed and snuggled all night long. I wasnt going to tell him about Ahmad as I thought that it would be inviting an argument. Yet, as Saturday nights dinner progressed, I found the right opportunity and threw the information into our conversation. His face fell when I first brought it up, but I promised him that Ahmad and I are fully over and that I am overjoyed with how well his and my relationship is going. He kissed me on the lips and I knew that all was well. My brother is fine! Of COURSE hes fine. God is taking such good care of him. He called us all on Saturday morning, just in time for my parents to salvage some semblance of their weekend. He was on the firing range when the fatality occurred, but he said that he is okay and that he is dealing with it, just like he is dealing with everything else thats fucked up there. He is making me so proud that I cant even put it into words. My brother, the solider. Weird. I am going to the Poconos for Labor Day weekend with my best friends from college. There are 5 girls and ME! Baby Joe. Everythings all planned and as I get closer to Friday, I get more and more excited. It is the only time of the year that we are all together and it is non-stop hilarity and fun. For some reason, our 6 drastically different personalities blend so well. Man, it will be a weekend to remember. Off to stay the night at Pauls apartment. Now that things are going so well with us, I actually get EXCITED to spend the evening with him. He makes me laugh so hard. And thats that!

 For some reason I was so excited about today being Friday that I couldnt fall asleep last night. I was working on my lines for the show until 2am and then I lay in bed staring at the wall with weekend jitters. It was so weird! Like it is my birthday or something. Man, it should TOTALLY be my birthday again. That shit is fun. Our rehearsal last night went well. Actually for the first hour or so I was in a pretty horrible mood because I was starting to feel the stress of not having a full cast, the pressures and inconveniences of a new space, and the fact that we havent had a solid rehearsal in two weeks. Sure, weve HAD rehearsal; they just havent been intensive. Ian, the guy that plays opposite me in the show, is fast becoming my new best friend. He is such a tough guy, but for some reason he and I have a great rapport with each other. When Megan and Kelly were auditioning the girls last night, Ian and I went to another room to work on our scenes. Ian could tell that I wasnt in the best of moods and he asked me what was wrong. We both discussed our fears, the changes, and our excitement about the upcoming show. He had some great advice and we both walked away from the conversation feeling much better. I asked him to go out with me and have a beer in order to get to know each other a little bit better and he was all for it. I just love this kid. I couldnt ask for a better partner in the show. My parents are crazy today. There was a report on CNN this morning explaining that a soldier in my brothers unit was killed yesterday at a firing range exercise. My brother was supposed to be at the firing range yesterday, so my parents are convinced that he was the fatality. I tried my damndest to calm my mother down, but my dad had already pushed her over the edge. I understand that they are worried and scared. Every day is a living nightmare for them. I wish there was SOMETHING that I could do, but unfortunately there isnt. I tell them that I am positive it wasnt Winfield who was hurt and that they have to trust and believe that God will keep him safe. But it doesnt matter. My parents are going to worry themselves into an early grave regardless. I fucking hate the war and I fucking hate the fact that my brother is in the ARMY. There isnt much more I can say about it. I fucking hate this shit. Heres a funny little story to get our Fridays off on the right foot The summer before my senior year in college, I dated this guy named Kevin. We dated for a month, 2 weeks of which he spent in Florida on vacation. I dated a number of guys while home in Albany for my summer breaks from college, but Kevin was the only one that I stayed with for more than a week. And even him I couldnt stand after 9 days. (reason number one why Paul is so special and important to me3 years and 9 monthsI have never committed to a guy for even half that amount of time) One time, Kelly and Angie (her ex) and I were at Kevins house hanging out, drinking some wine, and playing Balderdash. Out of nowhere, I had to take the biggest shit. I snuck out of the room and used one of the bathrooms that was off to the side of the rest of the house. I remember that the bathroom was salmon colored and that there was a washing machine and dryer in the same room. (it was a huge bathroom) I squirted out my typical diarrhea-esque shit and when I went to stand up and flush the toilet, I accidentally knocked a clean stack of washing clothes into the pool of shit resting happily in the toilet. I let out a yelp and immediately tried to fish the cloths out. They were covered in poop water. Mortified, I panicked as to what to do to solve this situation. Once all of the wash cloths were retrieved, I flushed the toilet and stood there, sweat pouring from my brow. Then it hit methe washing machine! I threw the dirty shit covered wash clothes into the washing machine and decided that I would turn it on and clean everything up. Then it hit meif I turned the washing machine on, Kevin would know that something was up and he might figure me out. And thats when I got an even better idea! I opened up the dryer and noticed that there was a pile of dry clothes sitting inside. Cover Up Time . I shoved the shitty washcloths to the bottom of the clean clothes and then shut the door and exhaled a huge sigh of relief. I exited the bathroom and no one was ever the wiser. Cept for the lucky person who took out the clothes to fold them and found 15 different washcloths covered in diarrhea poop. Hahahahahaha oh God, why did I think that was good idea. In any case, I was never busted for it and I broke up with Kevin a week later. Whats done is done! Okay yall! Have an EXCELLENT weekend! And remember Pussy is best eaten with a little Tobasco sauce and a ton of salt. Yuuuuuuuuuuuuuuum!

 Oh thank the Lord that it is almost the weekend. This week has been so crazy that I feel as though I am going to collapse in exhaustion. Too bad that I have a ton of shit to do this weekend. Luckily, some of it is fun and not centered around errands and chores. Damn those errands and chores. I saw Freddy Vs. Jason last night and I LOVED it. Yes, it was campy and yes, the acting was horrific, but it was such a wonderful throw back to the originals that it would have been impossible for me not to love every second. Freddy is definitely getting older and Jason seems to be getting bigger (new actor playing the part), but they can still hack up bodies with the best of them. I never realized how hard Jason swings his machete. Man, he rips through bodies like nobodys business. I almost got hard watching him sling around his brute force. On Friday night I will be hanging out with Ahmad. He was originally supposed to go to Albany to visit a friend, but the trip was cancelled. Now, he and I are meeting up for drinks so that we can get some closure on our past dating relationship. I have promised myself that I will not kiss him, hug him for too long, or insinuate in any way that he and I should ever date again. I want him as a friend and realize that it is up to me whether or not we act out on our physical attraction. No matter how drunk I getI REFUSE to kiss his mouth. Okay, maybe once. Okay, maybe twice, but I SWEAR that I will never touch his dick again. Never. Ever. Whatever. I just love Paul so much. Although he wasnt thrilled to go see Freddy Vs. Jason , he went willingly and was a gem throughout the entire experience. After the movie was over, I wanted to stop and get a bite to eat and he wanted to go to the local grocery store and make dinner. At first I was irritated because I didnt want to have to MAKE dinner at midnight, but I gave in and put on my happy face as we did our shopping. When we got home, he decided he wasnt hungry. At first I wanted to rip his face off, cuz all I wanted to eat was a fast food hamburger and maybe some fries. But I didnt yell, I simply explained that he wanted to go food shopping and now I was stuck without anything to eat. Without question, Paul got up, went into the kitchen made me two grilled cheese sandwiches, a salmon plate with cream cheese and crackers, and poured me a glass of soda. It was amazing. Usually we would fight over something like this and would probably go to bed hungry and angry. But now we have this new communication thing going and instead of yelling, we talk and fix the problem. I went to bed full and happy. Mariah invited us both to go see Tori Amos on Saturday, but I had to say no because I simply dont have the money. Paul really wanted to go, but he and I had plans to go to dinner on Saturday night. When I heard him tell Mariah that he would go to the concert anyway, I bit my tongue and shut up about it. Later on in the evening, Paul surprised me by saying that if I dont have the money to go to the concert, he wont go either and he will still take me out to dinner. I looked him in the eyes and smiled. We kissed, then we hugged, then we kissed again. Its like I have a REAL relationship now. And I am thrilled. When things are going well with Paul, everything else in my life seems to fall into place. I am SO glad that I didnt do anything irrational and break up with him. Yes, I have been upset with him for a long time, but deep down I just knew that we werent ready to end what we have going. Love requires patience and understanding and Im not convinced that I gave him enough of that when we were having our problems. It takes two people to fight and it takes two people to have a loving relationship. It is very possible that I was a huge part of the problem as well. I am relieved that we are giving this one more chance. Even more of a reason why I cant do ANYTHING with Ahmad when I see him. Self-control, self-control, self-control. Tonight we are auditioning two new girls to replace the one that had to be booted from the production. I PRAY that one of these girls will work out. We are six weeks away from opening night and we desperately need a ton of work. At this point, I am the only one who is memorized for the show. I understand that everyone has a lot going on in their lives and that we dont have to be fully memorized until Monday, but I would be lying if I said that I wasnt a bit concerned. It is impossible for us to run whole scenes if there is even one person who is still working off of the script. It is inevitable that the new girl will be working with the lines in her hand for the first two weeks, which is even more of a reason why Kelly, Ian, and I have to have our shit together. It is our responsibility to pick up the slack. So yeah, Im a bit concerned. Tomorrow is Friday! FUCKING YAY. It really couldnt come fast enough. (I love you poodle!)

 Wellity, wellity, wellity Its Wednesday! YaHOOOOOOOOOOOO! Tonight I am going to see Freddy Vs. Jason !!! Its like my favorite day of the year or something. I heard the movie is super good and I cant wait to sit there and watch two of the classic monster men of my time battle the fuck out of each other. I dont know yet if there is a winner in this match of doom, but personally, if there is, I want it to be Freddy. That fucker gave me nightmares for years. I was obsessed with him. I remember one dream in particular. I was waiting for the school bus at night with some friends. The bus pulled up, we all got on board and started driving to school. We hadnt gotten a mile from my house when Freddy appeared outside the bus windows and was like Ill KEEL you. Of course we all screamed and then everything goes a bit fuzzy. But I do remember that somehow Freddy fell inside of the bus engine and was turned into green puree. We all cheered and then got boners. Or something. It was a long time ago. We also came up with a game that we would play all the time. My brother and I would have friends over and we would play Freddy. Yeah, original name, I know. The details of the game were this: Everyone had to go into one room and pretend that they were sleeping. You would have to fake go to sleep so that you would wake up in the dreamworld.duh! When you woke up, you had to search through the pitch-black house for the kid who was playing Freddy Kruegar. We would all stick together and detail search the rooms, convinced that somehow the child playing Freddy would be able to hide in places that were just not possible for a little kid. But Freddy had POWERS, so you never know. It is the dreamworld after all. He could easily turn himself into the family dog and when you went to pet himWHAMall of your fingers get sliced off. (Children and their imaginations. SIKE. Adults and their imaginations.) Once Freddy jumped out of his hiding spot, it was up to all of us to run as fast as we could back to the room that we started in and jump back into our designated sleeping positions so that we could wake upalive. When you woke up, you would notice who was killed and who wasnt by how many people were left in the room. The missing people obviously became helpers of Freddy until everyone was slashed and brutally murdered. It was just about the most fun game we created when we were little. My brother and I were never actually allowed to watch the Nightmare on Elm Street movies when we were younger. My parents deemed them too horrifying for our fragile little minds. So we would wait until my parents went to bed and sneak down to watch them. I specifically remember sleeping on the very outermost edge of my bed, SO terrified that Freddy was going to stick his knife-wielding hand up through my mattress and into my gut. I slept that way for a year I think. Sometimes I still wonder if hes coming for me. Needless to say, the day cant go fast enough. I want me some Freddy Vs. Jason and I want it now. Ahmad and I are back in touch as of this morning. I called him during the blackout and he wrote me an email this morning. We have been exchanging notes back and forth all day. He is fully dating someone newthis guy Leo, whom I have mentioned before. When I asked Ahmad to describe Leo to me this morning, this is what he wrote: Leo is around your height, but looks nothing like you. He has blond hair and big blue eyes. Things are not serious, we are just dating. I have only known him for about a month so we will see. He is a little pit bull since he wrestled in school. It is weird, because you call me Mahd, and he calls me Mahdy Mahd. I cant escape this nickname. Perfectly acceptable description right? This is what I wrote back about Leo: Mahdy Mahd, eh? SNORE. sike. I will stick with the plain old "Mahd". He's a little pit bull? I don't picture that as being your type, but what do I know? You look way past the physical anything and go for the personality, so I am sure that he is a sweetheart of a guy. Good luck with him my man. I hope Freddy Krueger slashes his ugly face. Ok, so I didnt say anything about his ugly face, but I tried to be as open minded about it as I could. It was me who brought him up, so I couldnt justifiably be too much of a dick about it. Either waya wrestler?? I am kind of jealous. Cuz I want to date a wrestler. And I want Ahmad to like me still. Yes, I realize that this is completely selfish. But this is my journal and I want him to like me. Sorry, I just spanked myself for acting like such a spoiled child. Baby Joe can do no wrong. --That was what all of my girls in school used to say about me. I have a big mouth and I do some fucked up things sometimesyet Baby Joe can do no wrong. In any caseI will try to be as mature and responsible with Ahmads feelings as I can. Yeah right. I live for me man. Dont we all live for me?

 Holy shit. Its been such a chaotic last five days. I seriously feel as though the world must be blowing up. Otherwise, why would everyone and everything be so far out of my hands? Lets break it down: 1) Work is a mad house. I have so much to do and no time to do it. SO MUCH and NO TIME. 2) There are now auditions on Thursday to replace the girl that had to be booted from the show. 3) My friend, Jessica, came into town for 5 days. I saw her Saturday night and was unable to see her again due to the fact that the world is pretending to fall apart. 4) I got a KILLER migraine yesterday and put myself farther behind with everything. Instead I lay clutching my head for about 11 straight hours in a warm, completely dark room. 5) The power came on for me on Friday, but because of the outage, I was unable to go to the dermatologist, I lost all of the food that I just bought, AND my office was closed. Thus making the world start to fall apart. 6) My apartment was a revolving door all weekend. People in, people out, people all about. It was nuts and eventually I had to run away from it all. 7) The Theater Company has decided to lease their own rehearsal/performance space for the next couple of months. This is GREAT news for them, but it totally adds to the chaos. Kelly is thrilled with the space. I have yet to see it, but know that I will be spending the rest of the next two months there. The only thing that I wasnt thrilled about is the fact that the space is in Brooklyn. Luckily it is only one subway stop into the borough, but my travel time to and from rehearsal has just increased by a half an hour each way. We will start going to this new space a week from today. I should climb in bed now and sleep, cuz Lord knows I wont be sleeping again for the next 8 weeks. So much! Eh? Also, I am so broke. Like, penniless. It has been so hard to survive this month for some reason. While I am THRILLED to be going to the Poconos over Labor Day with my friends from college, I still dont know how I am going to afford it. I have to talk to my friend Rita about it. My heart is pounding with debt fear and I dont yet know how to handle it. She will make me feel better. She always does. Now that I have spit all of that out The power outage, while being slightly irritating, was just about the coolest thing to happen in a while. NYC was drenched in blackness for a whole day! I ended up going over to Aris, drinking a bottle of wine, and catching a cab to my house around 12:30am. Talk about SPOOKY! Times Square was completely empty of both cars and people. It was like 28 Days Later cept with less human brain eating. You understand. Everyone banded together and treated like one big holiday. I wasnt afraid for a second. It was an inconvenience for me, but was cushioned by the fact that everyone, regardless of economic status, race, sexual orientation, was stuck in the same position. Its like the one time during life when we are all one in the same. Since I had no power, I called everyone I knew when I got home, but no one was around. Probably in bed, since it was close to 1am when I finally made it into my apartment. I was convinced that there would be a killer hiding in my apartment when I got inside, but there wasnt. Just rotting food and a freaked out cat. I threw both in the garbage and made my phone calls. Hope everyone else is doing well. I feel so out of the loop. Time to get my work done and jump back in. GAH! Oh. And also ACK!

 WHY is it that EVERY time we all go out to the bars, there is an excessive amount of drama?? I just dont get it. It literally follows us. Mariah and I showed up at The Hangar around 7pm last night and were unimpressed from the get go. The bar itself was very dark and covered in red lighting. The people were no younger than 47 years old and each of the guys made sure to wear their dirtiest wife beaters. Too bad the amount of wrinkles and flabby arms deterred me from staring at all the bodies. The one good thing is that the happy hour goes until 9pm and it was 2 for 1! I must have downed at least 5 vodka tonics in 2 hours. I was drinking so fast that I had to switch to Baileys. Embarrassing yes, but worth it not to puke? Yes again. The MINUTE Mariah and I walked into the bar, the bouncer (bouncer? hahahahahe had flames shooting directly out of his ASS) gave us a hard time. He stared at us throughout the duration of the evening and at one point, followed us into the bathroom. Mariah asked him Why are you watching us and following us around the bar? His reply was Cuz I know that you two are going to have sex in my restroom. WHA?!?!?! Fucking toolbag. It seems that every time Mariah and I go out, we have such a hard time dealing with the other people at the bar. Either they cant stop putting their hands all over us or they are unbelievably cruel to us because they think were straight. Its fucking frustrating. I was always told that gay men were SO accepting. Fuck that noise. The straw that broke Mariahs back was when the bouncer came over to her and asked her to Stop dancing. When we burst out laughing IN his face, he got the manager and we were told that dancing was prohibited. What a fucking LAME place! A bunch of people met us at the bar, I ended up dropping my empty glass on the floor and smashing in right in front of the bouncer, Mariah got yet ANOTHER reaming by the fuckhead manager and we knew that it was time to go. On the way out, I looked the bouncer right in his ugly face and told him that he "was a disappointment to the gay community while Paul spit on the floor. Yet, I still dont know why poor little us come in contact with so much drama. hahahaSnarf. Needless to say, we will NEVER be going back to The Hangar . Things that I am excited about: Going to the dermatologist tomorrow! Finally my face will be BEEYOUTIFULL and free of rash-like bullshit. Starting a semi-regular routine of going out to the gay bars with a group of gay guys. My friend Ian and I are organizing the group and I am so happy to finally be able to have some gay guys to hang out with. I mean, every good gay needs a group like this. Paul and I are treating each other with respect and kindness. Things are going better than they ever have before. Line of communication = fully open now. Getting SO much work done at my job this week. The fact that I am already fully memorized for the play. And as far as I know, the first one to do so. Got to talk to my brother yesterday for a HALF AN HOUR! The conversation was incredible. Things that I am NOT excited about: The back up for Robyns part in the show, Ingrid, will be unable to do the role. Now the company will have to re-hold all new auditions because the rest of the girls that had tried out are either not good enough for the part or dont fit into it in any way. Had grilled cheese and fries for lunch. It wasnt my fault though. I promise. I went with my friend, Ian, and he told me that I should get it. I blame him for my jelly rollserbelly rolls. Well, thats a short list! And surely a good sign that things are going well. Before I goI am going to give a brief synapses of The Osbournes season finale so that if you dont have cable or live on another planet, you will be filled in on what happened Tuesday night. If you dont want to know, then now is your chance to leave my page and move on out. SYNAPSES Seems that Jack Osbourne has a sleepwalking problem. He explains, for the first half of the episode, that he has been having violent sleepwalking attacks where he hurts anyone that wakes him up, etc. This is further proved by film documentation. Kelly gets into a HUGE fight with her mother that results in the two of them parting ways as manager and client. There is a ton of screaming by Kelly culminating in her HYSTERICALLY dramatic exit from the Osbourne household. Picture her wearing a black wig, tons of make-up and sunglasses, all the while throwing her packed suitcases down the stairs. The entire time, no one notices, although Kelly is pouring her soul into the performance. One night, Jack is sleeping in his bed. He seems to wake up and notice Minnie (Sharons favorite dog) standing next to his bed. Without any hesitation, he grabs Minnie in his arm and pulls her into his bed. At that point, we see him struggle ( slightly out of view of the camera) with Minnie and we hear the dog crying for help. Jack twists Minnies neck and kills her. The next morning Jack wakes up to find Minnies dead body in his bed. He responds by saying whoa. He gets out of bed, somehow wraps up Minnie in a blanket and shoves the dead body in a duffle bag. All the while, Sharon and Ozzy are running around the house screaming Minnies name. Minnie where ARE you? MINNIE! Jack is seen running down the stairs and out of the Osbourne house, duffel bag in tow. A couple of minutes later, the phone rings and Ozzy answers. Jack: Dad, Ive done something really fucked up. Ozzy: What is it? You know you can tell me anything. J: Dad, Ive killed Minnie. O: Whawha(jumbled ex-heroine addict talk)Iuh J: Dad, I killed Minnie while I was sleeping. I dontIdad O: You better not be pulling my leg Jack. This isnt funny. Jack J: Dad, Minnie is dead. Dont tell mom. Please dont tell her. O: But I have to tell her. Jack I have to tell your mother. J: Oh god dad, Minnie is dead. They hang up and the next scene is Ozzy confronting Sharon: Ozzy: Sharon, I have terrible news. Sharon: What is it Ozzy? What is it? O: Sharon, Minnie is dead. Minnie is dead. S: Youre just trying to round (wind?) me up. Youre just trying to wind me up. O: Sharon, Minnie is dead. Jack killed Minnie. Minnie is dead. S: Minnieeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! O: (Crying and shaking uncontrollably) Sharon, I am so sorry. Sharon, Minnie is dead! S: MINNIE! Next scene Sharon packs up everything that reminds her of Minnie, kisses Ozzy on the forehead, while hes sleeping, and leaves the house. The phone rings and Ozzy answers: O: Sharon, where are you? S: I had to leave the house. Everything there reminds me of Minnie. I need some time alone. O: Sharon, come home. Sharon please. S: Ozzy, I need to be by myself. I need to be away from the house right now. O: (borderline hysterical again) Sharon dont do anything dangerous. Sharon dont do anything dangerous. S: I need to be away from the house. O: Sharon dont do anything dangerous. Sharon I love you. --click So, we, the audience, sit staring at the television in complete horror. It was like a nation-wide moment of horrified silence. Everyone processing it in a different way. After Ozzy gets off the phone with Sharon, he attempts to change the television station. He is unsuccessful and goes to walk up the stairs. Thats when the director calls Cut!. The camera pans around and Kelly and Jack are there and Minnie is being held by Sharon! (Although Minnie looked like she had grown by 50 pounds) The show was over and it was all a hoax. But you tell ME that you didnt believe in it as it was happening. Personally, I think that they did this episode, not to make everyone think that the whole show was faked, but to let everyone know how influential the editing of a TV show really is. We, as members of the watching audience, are convinced that everything we see is for real; that we are seeing directly into their house, into their lives. That couldnt be farther from the truth. We are only seeing what MTV wants us to see, what MTV wants us to know about the Osbournes. It was their way of reminding us that it is still a television show, afterall. I LOVED the episode. It was, probably, the most ingenious 30 minutes of television that I have seen over the last couple of months. The whole thing was SO believable. I heard that Sharon, Jack, and Kelly were playing a joke on Ozzy and thats how the idea of the show came about. Interestingespecially since I took so much more away from it than that. You must see it in person. But if for some reason you are unable to, I hope this synapses did the episode justice. It was so unreal. The whole thing. Happy watching!

 Kelly and I hung out last night and had a few drinks together. We havent done that in a long time and it was pretty fun. It gave us a chance to catch up on things that have been on our mind. And it gave her the chance to tell me of something horrible that happened with our show. Turns out that the girl that we cast in the show, Robyn, is a member of Actors Equity. This means that she is in the theater union. Actors that are in Equity are not allowed to do any show that isnt sponsored by Equity. There are a million rules and guidelines when an actor is in this union. Usually its a great benefit, but in this case it is not good at all. Our director, Megan, had to call Robyn at home last night and tell her that she is no longer in the show. Robyn told Megan that she had to get off the phone because she was going to start crying. We all felt horrible for Robyn and horrible for ourselves. I mean, we have rehearsed for a month together and now we have to cast a new girl in her place. Robyn should have known of the Equity rules before she auditioned for the play. I am absolutely stunned that she was unaware of the guidelines. Kellys friend, Ingrid, is going to take her place. Hopefully. Ingrid is an excellent actress, although not the first choice for the part. She will do a great job if she decides to take it, but its going to be crunch time trying to catch her up to speed. Honestly, having to recast this part is about the last thing any of us want to deal with right now. Stupid Robyn and her stupid Actors Equity card. Did you SEE The Osbournes last night?? I mean, did you??? Holy FUCK! In my opinion, it was the BEST episode that I have seen over the last three seasons. I so badly want to tell everyone what happened, but I dont want to give it away, just in case there are a few people slow on the uptake. Everyone that I have talked to about it has a different opinion on what it all meant. Personally, I think that the family wanted everyone to see how influential the editing of a show really is. You cant always believe everything you see on TV. And how often do we all take this for granted? I certainly do. If you put a slice of cheese on television and tell me that its actually a slice of dark chocolate, well, I would believe you. Why wouldnt I? And how dare you lie to me. My favorite part of the episode could very well be Kelly Osbourne packing up her shit to move out. With her wig and sunglasses on, she looked like Judy Garland post alcoholic breakdown. It was unreal and fucking awesome. Especially when the truth was revealed. WHAT A GREAT SHOW! Joe CuttheShit gives it four dicks straight up! Meeting up with Mariah after work for some drinks. We are going to place called The Hangar . I have yet to go to this gay bar and to be honest, am slightly scared of it. When I checked it out online, it looked like the crowd was compiled of ex-cons who decided to dedicate their entire existence to the leather lifestyle. Yikes. Here comes Joe and Mariah, two of the prettiest, most UNTHREATENING people on the planet to have some vodka tonics. Wish me luck. I plan to be either raped or murdered in the first five minutes. Ehas long as the drinks are cheap. And as long as the fucks are long and hard. Why I Love French Fries You go so well with crumbly bleu cheese. You look so cute sitting atop my knees. You taste so good slathered in Mayo I laugh out loud when you say Heyo! My friend, my love, the dear french fry, The hope of marrying you could make me cry. Your truthful nature, your loving embrace, Fruits and veggies vanish without a trace. I aspire to your incredible heights of glory I knew a girl in school named Dory. Dory was a nice and ugly lesbian Who didnt eat french fries, so the end. Man, I gotta shit. So bad. I love you, you love me, homo-sexu-ali-ty! Enjoy whatever the nighttime brings.

 I was minding my own business, taking a casual stroll to get my haircut My discman was blaring TLCS latest disc, 3D , and I had a cigarette in my mouth. Out of nowhere, this psycho scumbag steps in front of me and goes Give me a cigarette. I didnt even see him approach and it took me off guard. I replied No man. Sorry. I never broke stride once, yet the man followed on my heels and said forcefully Give me a cigarette. When I kept walking and ignoring him, he took his hand and smacked me extremely hard on the back. Without even thinking, I whirled around and shoved him hardright on to his ass. Dont EVER fucking touch me mother FUCKER! He stared at me, eyes gaping, while lying on the ground. I turned and kept walking. Unafraid. For the next 5 blocks or so, it took all of the strength I had in my body to keep my hands from shaking uncontrollably. I dont like physical confrontation of ANY kind, but fuck if I am going to let ANYONE shove me around in this city. I feel bad for knocking this dickhead on the ground, but I also feel justified. God, I dont know what came over me. One minute I was jamming out to TLC, the next minute I knocked some dude on his ass. Damn, Im ruff and tuff with my afro puffs. Had a very uneventful weekend. Sort of. I did see The Hours , which blew my mind. I also saw Punch-Drunk Love , which solidified my belief that Paul Thomas Anderson is the BEST and most INGENIUS director out there. And finally, I saw Deliver Us From Eva and was horribly disappointed that LL Cool J only took off his shirt once. AND he was covered by the bedsheet the whole time. FUCKING LAME! Oh yeah and I attempted to watch Wes Cravens They but I got so frustrated with it that I didnt even finish watching it. Now, besides all of the movies I saw this weekend Paul came over on Saturday night and we had our talk. The minute I told him that I thought we should take a break, he said Fine and got up to leave. When I grabbed his arm and made him sit down to talk about it all, he burst into tears and sobbed for awhile. He told me that he hates himself right now and has for a very long time. He admits to treating me poorly and knows that he doesnt deserve me. He talked long and hard about his parents, his life in NYC, his failure at our relationship, and his imploding restaurant career. When he was finished, I held him for a long time. I told Paul that I am very much in love with him, but think we should take a break because we are slowly destroying each other. Paul acknowledges this and said that he understands if I need to be away from him. I told him that I didnt want to do that at all, that what I really wanted was to have my boyfriend back, the guy that I fell so hard for 3 and a half years ago. Paul promised to work harder on making me happy. He promised that he will do his best to make me first priority and to treat me with nothing less than kindness. Paul promised that I wont have to wonder if I should be with him anymore. I took all of what he said with a grain of salt. While I would love to believe him, I know how unlikely it is that he will turn it all around. And if he doesnt, he is now prepared for me to leave him. The rest of Saturday night went very well and when we woke up on Sunday morning, we made beautiful love to together. I KNOW! 3rd time since January! Cept that this time, I felt it. Our kisses were real and not forced. His touch made me melt and his arm around me made me feel like he really loved my body, my heart, and my soul. I came within minutes. So, the Paul and Joe saga is far from closed. We will continue on together, cuz thats what people in love do. But I have definitely learned some lessons from this whole thing and I am a bit less scared about having to leave him, if the time for that should come. I appreciate all of the support that my friends have given me throughout this rough time period in my life. Without that support, I might have done something totally irrational. I have been known, you know? Tonight Paul and I are celebrating our talk with a bottle of champagne and a nice dinner in the East Village. I am pretty excited. Pedro was right about us communicating better. Even though we talk all the time, we dont necessarily talk all the time. I have to work on keeping that line of communication open. As long as he keeps working on himself. The two boys, together again.

 The reason I'm in love with Paul is simple. I know him. I can read him. I have learned what there is to know about him. I can predict his moods, his words, his thoughts. I know what makes him happy and conversely I know what makes him sad. I know what Paul is capable of and because of this I am often disappointed by everything I have come to know. What do I love most? There is no fear with Paul. I'm 100% convinced that Paul is in love with me. I'm completely sure that Paul has found the guy he wants to be with for the rest of his life. There is no doubt in my mind that Paul would do anything he could to hold on to me. It took me a while to catch on to this, for me to figure out his pattern. Paul has always been a challenge for me. I was never sure what priority I was in his life. It made me have to work for the relationship. It forced me to forego all of my previous stigmas. No one before Paul has made me want to sacrifice my happiness. No one before Paul has made me as obsessed as I have been in the past. Obsessed with being the perfect boyfriend. As much as I'd like to believe that Paul and I have an open line of communication, I am now starting to think that it's just the opposite. We have so much anger in our relationship resulting from numerous bad experiences that we have encountered along the way. Mariah told me today that Paul said that "the Bahamas trip was the best time that Joe and I could have ever had. It was the time of my life." If he believes this way, then how can I sit here and say that Paul deserves to be dropped on his ass? Why do I think that I'm at all justified in causing this breakup? Yes, I am unsatisfied. It's been 8 months since we've made love and I can't even begin to explain how much that hurts me. He doesn't shower me with praise and he never surprises me with fun things. He doesn't ask how my day was and he doesn't verbally support me in any of my endeavors. Paul does not put his arm around me when I am sad. I can't cry with Paul and feel comfortable about it. He doesn't buy me a pair of shoes when the soles of my shoes are completely deteriorated. Paul is inconsistent with his attentiveness to our relationship. He can go a full week without calling me once. It's common for him to go away for a weekend and never call me once. Paul doesn't like to get out of the house or do anything spontaneious. He doesn't want to party with me. He doesn't want to do anything crazy. And worst of all, he doesn't have fun with me when we are in a group of people. Paul and I aren't a team. Never have been. These are the things that I need to say to Paul when we have our final conversation about the future of our relationship. I am ready. I am ready to be single. I am ready to live my life for me now. I am ready to be the Joe CuttheShit that I meant to be when I graduated from college. I have dreams. I have hopes and desires (luv u reets) and I have things that I want to do and experience in my life. I didn't move to NYC (one of the BIGGEST cities in the world) to sit around and not enjoy it. To sit in my room at night and be afraid of the good things that are coming my way. I don't see how any conversation with Paul could save our relationship. There isn't much that he can say that will give me a new perspective on...us. I don't see how there is any difference between our relationship and our friendship. There is a popular term in the gay community for lesbians who stay together too long, much longer than was necessary for either person. This term is Lesbian Deathbed . While Paul and I aren't lesbians (surprised?), we are stuck in the worst "deathbed" I've ever seen. We are destroying eachother. Not helping or changing. Fucking lesbians and their damn deathbed. I always thought that when I broke up with my first "real boyfriend" it would be because one of us fucked up; that one of us would have cheated on the other person or killed their mother or knocked their teeth out. But it's not like that all the time. This time, two boys who are very much in love with each other can't figure out how to have a stable, supportive, and edifying relationship. It's very sad. More than that, it's heartbreaking. These are all of the things I need to say to Paul when we have our conversation. The reason why I haven't wanted to confront it up until now is simple. As simple as me being in love with him. I love Paul more than I want to hurt him. Yet, there is truth to the theory of living for oneself. Loving yourself so that you can love someone else. If the person you're with doesn't make you love yourself, then it's time to rethink the whole situation. It could be time to find my roots and move on.

 Here's to hoping that all the dicks and pussies in the world have a great weekend! Enjoy!

 I got advice today from the most unlikely of people. I was outside having a cigarette during my morning smoke break when the front desk attendant of my building came out and sat next to me. At first I was a little irritated because I just wanted to sit by myself, smoke my butt, and clear my head. When Pedro came out he sat down and lit up his smoke. Whats wrong Joe? You dont seem like yourself lately. What do you mean? Im fine. Oh come on, you cant fool me my man. Your face is dragging on the ground. Things with Paul ok? I looked at Pedro for a minute and instead of replying with my usual No, everythings fine, I decided to tell him whats going on. I think Paul and I are going to break up. Things havent been going well for a while now and Im afraid that I am going to have to cut things off with him. I explained in further detail as he listened to me with complete interest. After I finished speaking, Pedro told me a story about he and his wife, Marilyn. He explained that although they have been married for decades, they have had numerous moments of calling it quits. But the one thing that always seemed to save their relationship was the fact that they could sit down and have a serious and open conversation about their problems. He advised me to sit down with Paul and to talk to him. At least one last time. You never know what could come out of the conversation, Joe. He could surprise you. But Pedro, I have had numerous conversations with him about our problematic relationship. Why should I have to do it again? Because you committed 3 years of your life to him, Joe. If you truly love him or did love him at one point, you owe it to both of you to have one more open conversation before you call it quits. He may not fully understand why you are so hurt. I appreciated Pedro sitting with me and giving me the advice that he did. I took everything he said and digested it throughout the day. Since I have always been someone who needs to make a decision about things as quickly as possible, I have had unending ahgida over confronting this head on. I feel a bit better now. It was nice to have someone tell me that I should give Paul the chance to explain himself. I am very influenced by my friends and most of them have told me to cut Paul loose, which in all reality is probably what will happen. But I liked having someone give me the other perspective. I will be going into this conversation with Paul with an open mind. And thats whats most important. Rita called me yesterday, despite my vain attempts to hide from her. She always senses when Im not doing well and yesterday she broke through my wall and got in touch with me. As soon as I answered the phone I opened up my heart and told her everything that was bothering me. Luckily I only started to cry once. Rita has this way of pulling everything out of me. I just open up and spill my guts. She is so good with me too. She supports me in everything that I say and helps me come up with different solutions to the problem. After talking to her for 40 minutes yesterday, I felt somewhat healed. God I miss her so much. This break-up situation wouldnt be nearly as difficult if I had her still living in NYC with me. Paul has Saturday night off from work. I am going to call him tonight and ask him to have dinner with me. It will be then that I have the conversation with him about our relationship. Worst case scenario, I throw my drink in his face and storm out. (oh how part of me would LOVE to have that happen) And now for my dear friend Wahini: Peanut Butter Goodness There was a day when I grew up And left my peanut friend behind. He waved goodbye with solemn tears Chewing on a melon rind. Why dont you love me any more? I heard Peanut say. Cuz you make my belly fat and gross, My ass and teeth decay. But I taste good with chocolate kisses, Peanut begged me Please. Begging is unsightly jerkoff. I have to take a pee. There is no reason for you to yell You hurt my feelings bad You fucking talking peanut man My goals to make you sad. With that last word, my peanut friend Turned his back and left. He walked real slow and bowed his head I left him sad, bereft. You see peanut man and his butter wife Had stole my lively hood. I once was pretty, thin, and cute Like most true gay boys should. But after years of spreading them All over my sand-whiches Peanut man and butter wife Became my nemesisses. Today I stay away from peanuts Salted or cashewed. Cuz saturated fat aint nice In fact its rather rude. ------written and copyrighted by Joe Cut the Shit. Have a great night yall!

 Sew Kelly and I have bugs in our apartment. Lots of them. Big ones. Gross ones. Ugly, scary, horrifying ones. According to everyone we have talked to, they are water bugs. They are MUCH bigger than cockroaches and they look more evil. When I got home on Saturday night from my vacation, I was lucky enough to have one jump on my leg. It was about the most disgusting and terrifying thing to happen to me since I have lived in NYC. Kelly found a bug in her bedroom on Sunday night and since then she has not slept at the apartment. Our exterminator came yesterday to seal off every hole and crack in our walls and near our pipes. Today they are supposed to come again and spray the fuck out of the place. Please God let these bugs either die or crawl back to the hell they came from. It is SO nasty to live in a space that is infested with creepy crawlers. From what Ian (the guy Im in the show with) has said, these water bugs live in the walls of the buildings. They feast on cockroaches (which is a good thing) and very rarely come out of the walls. He said that if you step on a water bug right after they have eaten, a full cockroach will pop out of their mouth. Fucking yikes. If I ever have to experience that shit, I will vomit on myself and let it dry. Just to take my mind off the situation. Kelly just called me and told me that the exterminator has come and taken care of business. Phucking phew. My mom got me some new CDs! I am now the proud owner of TLCS final CD 3D, among others. When I played the album this morning for the first time, I almost started to cry as I walked to the subway. I hate the fact that Lisa Lopez is dead. I hate it. Almost as much as I hate that Nell Carter is dead. You understand. The Truth About Dicks and Balls (Loosely based on The Truth About Cats & Dogs ) My dick is hard From all the jerks. My balls are tight Its filled with spurts. Dicks are nice Hard and firm When tugged on lightly It makes me squirm. Finger the hole And get a slap Why would you do that? Do you like crap? My cum is salty It tastes like cream You just need cookies A dessert and dream. This poem is Lame Yet caused me to smile Not talking about Paul At least for awhile. Off to rehearsal! Thank GOD I have acting back in my life. Just when I needed it the most.

 Another day I have been so productive at work, its almost scaring me. I usually like to get in as much play time as possible, but lately, I havent had a free second to do anything. My journal reading has decreased to a bare minimum and my e-mail responses have stopped altogether. This is one of the busiest times of the year for me. The students return in 3 weeks and everything must be completed and ready by then. Really, the only relaxing thing I do during the day is write in my journal. Well, lunch is pretty relaxing too. Unless Im fighting my pizza urges. Then things can get quite hairy. Orcheesy. Depends on how you like your pizza. I prefer black and curly. I got a letter from my brother today. It was kind of smarmy. I had sent him some of my journal for leisure reading and he writes, I dont know how you can divulge so much personal information on the internet. I find it funny because I know you. I guess these strangers find you funny too, although Im not sure why. Do they get off on stories of burning assholes? Ok, prick, I know you are in a war and all, but back off. EVERYONE that I know loves stories of burning assholes. Maybe military men are too serious for my sense of humor. Snore. I wrote him back as soon as I got to work and told him that if he would rather sit and read ARMY paraphernalia all day, thats fine with me. I will save my journal for people who dont have sticks shoved up their asses. Or burning cigarettes for that matter. Ive thought long and hard about what to do about my situation with Paul. Ive come to this conclusion: I have no idea what to do or when to do what I should do, but I cant do it now. Nice having closure, huh? Ive gone from anger to sadness and every time I hear his voice on the phone, I feel as though I am holding back the biggest secret of my life. He knows that I am not happy in the relationship and I have mentioned breaking up a couple of times, but I dont think he realizes how serious I am this time. Maybe because I have already broken up with him twice before and took him back after a month of begging and pleading. Paul is very much in love with me. I know this. ErI think I know this. He doesnt want to make love to me, but at this point, I dont want him to touch me either. We have a great friendship going, but the minute I tell him that I think we should break up, our friendship of a relationship will fall apart. I know it. He wont be able to be my friend and in some ways, I dont know if I will be able to be his either. Ive never been able to be friends with my exs. It seems virtually impossible. With so much residual anger, I dont see how either one of us could tolerate the other person. They say that it takes half the time youve been with someone to get over them. Paul and I have been together for 3 years and 8 months. Does that mean that I have to wait until 2005 before I can fully put this to rest? The idea of it makes me vomitous. I have said repeatedly in the past that I am not scared to be single, that I am not afraid to be alone. I have wonderful friends and a full support system through them. But as the reality of all of this starts to clear up in my head, I am starting to recognize how scared I truly am. Its not like Paul and I are a team, the way that most couples are Its not like I only have Paul in NYC to be around and to hang out with Its not like Paul does much besides tear me down But there is something to be said for being in a relationship. No one in my life knows me the way that Paul does. Sure my friends know more details about my life than he does, but only he knows my behavior. Only Paul knows me when my guard is completely down. And he takes advantage of that. But at the same time, I trust that whatever comes out of my mouth with Paul will be taken with a grain of salt. I could never destroy him with my words. I am allowed to be myself without regard for anyone else. I can be selfish. I will miss this aspect the most. Boyfriends/girlfriends/husbands/wivesyour partner knows a side of you that only love can bring. I dont want to lose this familiarity. I dont want to lose this luxury. Yet, its quite a toss up. Whats more important? This one simple luxury or a world free of antagonism, anger, and frustration? It will be a while before I can confront this conversation with the people in my personal life. I find myself lying to those around me, telling them that everything is fine. I want to deal with this alone right now. I dont want to talk about it. I dont want advice and I dont want any pressure from anyone. Not that I have gotten any of that, but I cant figure out how to talk to my friends about this, without having them tell me what I already know. Do whats right for you. I know. I know. I know. I know. But if I break up with Paul this time, there is no going back. We will be done forever and I will have lost someone that I have dedicated 3 years of my life to. The answer is simple, the execution is impossible. Selfishly, I just need more time.

 WELL! I am home. Safe and sound. And with a pretty great tan, if I do say so myself. I worked hard at it. Spent every day on the beach. Ate lots of food and even gambled a bit. I won $150 one evening at the casino and that was quite a highlight for me since I am usually living a life based on poverty. Overall, it was a VERY relaxing week and I feel truly rested and rejuvenated. I should be able to sit here and type for hours about all of the adventures I had and all of the crazy shit that happened to Paul and me while we were living it up. Unfortunately, that isnt the case. As the plane landed in the Bahamas, Paul decided that he is no longer a drinker. Funny, since he blacked out from too much vodka on the Thursday before we left. Paul also decided that he is no longer a pot smoker, cept that he smoked every bit of the pot that I bought while there. Paul also decided that he doesnt smoke cigarettes, cept that he smoked every pack I brought down with me. Gosh. While the trip was totally relaxing and while Paul and I didnt fight barely at all while in the Bahamas, the trip wasnt that much fun. I was in bed by 11pm every night. Paul didnt want to do ANYTHING. He wanted to go to the beach, make dinner at home, and watch TV. And thats what we did. I catered to his every whim while we were there. I didnt want us to spend the week arguing, so I sucked it up and did whatever he wanted to do. However, now that I am home, I hate him for it. I hate him especially since he has spent the two nights since we have been home, drinking. Yet when I drank a few beers each night of the vacation, I got an ear full of reprimands. Hypocrite fuck. Paul and I barely even kissed on the mouth while we were there. Romance was not even a factor. It was like two boyswaittwo BORING boys hanging out in the Caribbean, catching up on episodes of Will and Grace and Friends . I know I said that I would do whatever I wanted to do on the trip, despite what Paul had to say, but when it came down to it, I just couldnt. The native people were pretty aggressive and did everything in their power to rob us of all of our money. They were mean and nasty. Freeport (the island of Grand Bahama) is a third world country and the people are direct products of their environment. It was scary to go out and tool the island by yourself and even more importantly, I dont understand why Paul couldnt take the step down and do what I wanted to do. At least to get out of the room more than we did. You ask him if we had a great time on the trip and he will surely say yes. Basically because he did everything he wanted to do. Go to the beach, make dinner in our suite, and be in bed watching TV by 7pm every night. God, I so dont want to talk about it anymore. Ive barely told anyone about the trip. I think Im not ready to confront it yet. Still stings a little. Dont get me wrongI didnt have a terrible time at all. It just wasnt the kind of trip that I get off on. It was very relaxing . What else can I say? Paul just came and had lunch with me at work. It made me sad. Knowing that we are cruising for a heart breaking break-up. Its inevitable. Im sure of it now. And I just cant talk about it at the moment. Got a week of rehearsals and work ahead of me. I was in a great mood before Paul came for lunch. Now, I feel like I could burst into tears. I dont want to hurt him. I dont want ME to hurt either. But how long can I keep this relationship going? Is it really time for us to call it quits? Im confused about love and Im confused about relationships. After this one, I feel like I never want one ever again. Ive been living on the theory that I just need to take everything day by day. But does an answer ever come that way? Am I just putting off something I need to take care of? Should I let it continue to see how it turns out? God, my head is swimming with confusion. Work is over now. I should go home.

 My life is complete chaos right now. I will try to post tomorrow. THE SHOW IS IN 3 DAYS! YAHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

 Well! The show opens in 4 days! I could puke all over myself. I am that nervous. I woke up yesterday and turned to Paul and said I dont think I can do this show anymore. It was a bad idea and Im not ready and I have to back out of it and I am not an actor and ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!! I started to shake and freak out. Paul was amazing. He immediately calmed me down and held me for a couple of minutes. I leaned into him and allowed him to take away the stress. Thank God for his comfort and assurance. We were able to work everything out between us on Saturday night and I am very happy with the outcome. We both listened to each other and he took some of the blame for the fight that we had. It was very comforting to know that we have gotten so far into our relationship that we can listen to one another and understand where the other person is coming from. Its taken 3 and a half years to get to this point, yet it has been well worth the wait. I have three more rehearsals until the big opening night. I couldnt be more excited or more scared about it. I am in a horrible mood today and hope that I can get out of it before I go there tonight. To be honest, I really hate my job and its been wearing down on me for the last couple of weeks. There is nothing I want more than to ditch these shitheads here and move on in my life. I have had just about enough of their smart mouths and lazy fucking attitudes. Being the administrative whipping boy has taken its toll on me. I fucking hate my job. FUCKING hate it. Fuck fuck fuck wish I could find a way to get out of here fuck. My friend Angies grandmother passed away this morning. The funeral is on Wednesday. I feel terrible for her, but we all knew this was coming. She has been incredibly strong throughout this whole process and I am very proud of the way that she has handled herself. Instead of shoving all of these emotions out of her mind, she has dealt with it head on. Im not sure if I would have done it that way if our situations were reversed. I hope she realizes that she has Kelly and I to lean on, should she need to take us up on that offer. Alright, thats it for today. Time to go get out of my shitty mood. Seriously, I feel like I could kill someone today. Grrrrr.I fucking hate Mondays.

 I just bought my costume for the show! AY YI YI! It cost me $50 and that pisses me off, since I will never be wearing these clothes ever again, but it was something that I had to do. Theater careers are so expensive! I think it looks pretty good though. Its just a couple of t-shirts and some REALLY lame jewelry. The one good thing, though, is that one of the t-shirts for the show is going to surprise my housemates from college. The picture on the front is an inside joke with me and my girls. YAHOOOOO! So Paul called KELLY yesterday. Not me. He called her to let her know that he is coming by my apartment on Saturday night to talk about our relationship. When Kelly told me the news, I was immediately pissed off. He calls HER? I have called him twice this week and he hasnt returned any of those calls, but he feels that its appropriate to call her and tell her that he is coming over. Thats fucking lame and Im still angry about it. Too bad for him that I already made plans on Saturday night, so it doesnt seem as though we are going to get together to talk. I just called him again and left a message and told him that I would be willing to change my plans if he could give me a definite time of arrival at my place. I'm still thinking about it. If he doesn't take this seriously, he can go fuck himself and I wont deal with his nonsense until after the show. The thing isI totally fucked up last Friday night. I have dealt with that and have admitted it over and over. Paul deserves an apology and I am more than willing to give it to him. BUT, and this is a BIG BUT(T), he needs to understand that he is in a RELATIONSHIP with me and with that comes certain responsibilities. SUCH AS calling back your boyfriend, no matter how hard it is. I know for a fact that he still wants to work things out and be with me because he said all of that to Kelly on the phone yesterday. However, calling my best friend to ask her if she can make arrangements on my behalf is not only offensive, its fucking immature. Needless to say, I am very much not in the mood to talk to him right now. I was, but Im not anymore. I dont know whats going to happen with us. Yes, I want to be with him, but he needs to make much more of an effort to be a normal human being. Not a selfish baby, like he has been for the last 3 years. Im through with kowtowing to his every need. I am supposed to be dating a MAN, not a little child. GAH! He pisses me off more than anyone else in the world does. Maybe thats love or maybe thats hate. Im not quite sure yet. Rehearsal last night was incredible. I was able to reach a few new levels and I even shocked myself with some of what came out of me. It was an invigorating and monumental rehearsal for me. And it made me even more excited for the showif thats even possible. Okthaz it fo today! I got a ton of shit to do at work and I have to get my ass in gear for rehearsal tonight. TOMORROW IS FRIDAY! Please God let it better than last Friday.

 Since I have had a horrible couple of days, I have been unable to write about all of the shit that has happened since last Friday. Here is the quick low down: 1) On Saturday night, I met a guy named Joe at a bar that we all went to. He is 39 years old, kinda cute, but kinda nasty at the same time. He had nice pecs and I was in the mood to be wanted, so after talking to him for a little while at the bar, Kelly, Angie, Mariah and I went over to his high-rise building in Hells Kitchen to have a few drinks and hang out. He has the most unbelievable view any of us have seen in the city. It was absolutely beautiful. After hanging out there for awhile, the girls left and I stayed behind to get to know him a bit better. Within minutes of the girls leaving, Joe asked if he could kiss me. My immediate answer was No. He proceeded to beg for the kiss for about 10 minutes and I finally was like Fine, whatever. Big mistake. Instead of giving me a nice, manly kiss, Joe came at me and started to lick my lips. I was like Wha? HORK!. He licked them for like 30 seconds and then I pulled away. His question was Did you like the kiss? My answer was I have to go now. I used the bathroom and bolted from his apartment. But waitdont you want to exchange phone numbers? I replied Sure, but I cant call you for at least a month. I am in a play and dont have any time for anything else right now. I gave him my number and took off. He called yesterday and left a message. I laughed and deleted it. That will teach YOU to lick my lips in an indulgent and grotesque manner. 2) As we were walking to Joes apartment that night, something absurd happened. Out of nowhere, I feel something slam into my back. My first reaction was Someone through something at me cuz Im gay! (Damn, I can be so lame) I turned around to see what was thrown at me and what did I see? A pigeon (!) lying on the ground next to me, totally disoriented. I saw the girls, walking farther behind me, laughing hysterically. Turns out, Kelly had tried to pull a feather from one of the wings of the pigeon and scared it so badly that it flew directly into the center of my back. Um. 3) Things with Ian and I are going very well. We are starting to settle into a real friendship now. He talks to me about things going on in his life and vice versa. I feel much more comfortable around him now and I can tell that he feels the same way. He told me last night that he is going to burn the new Dave Matthews disc for me. Well! I mean, if youre giving away presentsbring em on! I just love this kid. I hope we continue to get to know each other after the show ends. 4) I sent out 50 headshots and resumes to talent agencies in NYC. I have yet to receive a single phone call in response. I am following up my letters with a reminder postcard about the show. There isnt much more I can do beside that, except pray. The headshots and the postage together cost me about $100. Last night at rehearsal Ian and Sarah both announced that they have gotten interviews with commercial and film agents from the letters they sent out. I did my absolute best to be a good sport about it, but deep down it hurts. I put in so much effort into my letters and so far it seems as though I flushed all of that time and money down the toilet. All I can do is count on God to guide this endeavor as well as the rest of my career. If this performance is not meant to net me an agent, then thats fine. I have to trust in him and not get upset if other people get a better response. 5) I got a new hamster last night! Right after work, I went to the local pet store and picked up my new baby. He looks exactly like Neechee, cept he is a bit bigger. The employee at the store told me that it wasnt a good idea to put a new male into the cage with an existing male, but I told him that I wanted it any way. When I got home, I introduced Jim to Kimberly and they hit it off immediately. When I returned to the apartment after rehearsal, they were sitting together having tea. It was the most adorable thing I have ever seen. Them with their little mugs and cigarettes in their hands. Tre cute. Cept not so much tea and cigarettes as them eating sunflower seeds. You understand. 6) Paul still hasnt called me since our fight. Although my friends tell me that he misses me and loves me, I still feel a bit concerned about the whole thing. I am going to let him take as much time as he needs. But with the next 3 weeks of my life being an emotional and chaotic roller coaster, I could really use his support. I suppose I did this to myself. But I would feel much better about everything if I had the boy that I love there with me every step of the way. 7) Although I havent had any agents call to reserve a ticket for the show, my friends and family have reserved 60 tickets! Considering that the space only holds 40 people at a time, this is a great accomplishment. I have the most wonderful and supportive people in my life and everyone wants to come. It makes me feel incredibly loved. Especially since I havent done a single thing in this city since I moved here back in 2001. So maybe its okay if no one from the industry comes for me. It is most important that I have those I love around me. 8) I have been on the most strict diet for the last 3 weeks and guess what? Its WORKING! I have lost 10 pounds at this point and I am hoping for another 5 by the time the show opens. I feel so much better in my skin and my clothes fit me better than they have in years. What have I done to lose this weight? Eat MUCH less and when I do eat, it has to be healthy. Low calorie, low fat, high protein. Who knew? Everyone in the world, but me. Now that the excess weight is coming off, I never want to return to the days of pizza and McDonalds as my staple food source. Well, except for when I am drunk. Cuz what is better that pizza and McDonalds when you are wasted? NOTHING! And thats it! Thank you to everyone for the kind words yesterday. I really needed it. I felt so horrible about what happened with little Neechee. But today is a new day and the sun is shining and I feel ready to continue on with everything that I have been working on. You are all the breast.

 As if things couldnt get any fucking worse I woke up this morning and noticed that the top to my hamster cage was left open last night. I had fed them before I got into bed and somehow forgot to close the cage. When I got out of bed this morning, I noticed that hamster Neechee was missing. I immediately started to panic. I looked all around my room and couldnt find him. I thought maybe he got out of my bedroom and was walking around the apartment. But if that was the case, our cat would have made some commotion to let us know that something was going on. I looked everywhere for the little guy and I couldnt find him. Finally I decided to get into the shower as I was already making myself incredibly late for work. I walked over to the broken box fan that sits on my floor and turned it off. (I have to be careful not to slice my fingers off, because the grill of the fan is busted and hanging open) It was then that I found my little guy. He had somehow walked into the blade of the box fan, clipped his nose on it and bled to death on my rug. Neechee is dead now. The second I saw him, my heart went into my throat. He looked so little and sad anddead. His body was perfectly intact, but his nose had dried blood on it. After I took a moment to compose myself, I went into the living room to get Kelly. She came in with me and saw poor little Neechee dead on the rug. I was just standing there shocked. Kelly immediately went and got some paper towel and I wrapped him up in a plastic bag and she disposed of him. Then I came to work. Once here, my boss proceeded to send me one obnoxious email after another about how my voice is too loud on the phone. He says that I talk to my mother too loudly. I immediately freaked out and wrote him back, basically telling him that of all the petty shit he could have slung at me this morning, this had to take the cake. We wrote nasty emails to each other until I just stopped communicating with him altogether. I just cant do it today. Why the FUCK should I have to put up with this stupid stupid shit? I work too hard at my job to be criticized as though I was in fucking middle school. I cant get the image of Neechees dead body out of my mind. God, I hate today. Why the hell was I so irresponsible as to leave the top off of the cage? Mother fucker. My friend Mariah called this morning and told me that she saw Paul yesterday. According to her, Paul misses me and is very upset that we are not speaking right now. Truth be told, the entire fight was my fault. I took it to a level that was not at all appropriate and I have been feeling terrible about it ever since. Paul shouldnt want to be with me after what I did. Yet he does. Want to be with me. He told Mariah that he loves me very intensely and wants nothing more than for us to work through the issue we are dealing with right now. He is being very level headed and fair about this. I wish he was here right now to give me a hug. God, I feel like I could burst into tears.

 I had one of the most random, most horrifying weekends of my life. Without having to get too deeply into the logistics of it all, Paul and I had a huge fight on Friday that ended with us breaking up. It was a drunken brawl and I am still unsure as of right now if the break-up was for real. He hasnt called me since then. And probably rightly so. I acted like a complete lunatic and hurt him pretty badly. I havent been feeling the same since. Last night I had a terrible dream that kind of sums up my entire weekend. I was in my bedroom playing with my hamsters, Kimberly and Neechee. As I was playing around in the cage, I noticed that there were tons more hamsters resting under the shavings of their cage. I put the lid back on the cage and as I turned around I saw that there were hundreds of hamsters milling around my bed, my dresser, my computer, etc. There were also big hamsters that look like chinchillas. It was absolutely terrifying and gross. I looked back into the hamster cage and saw that it was filling up with more and more of them. I opened up my bedroom window and started throwing them out the window. As I tried to grab them off the floor, they bit me over and over and I specifically remember the pain I was feeling in the dream. It was their teeth chewing on my skin. I then grabbed a bath towel and started picking them up and breaking their necks and throwing the dead bodies out of my window. I couldnt move nearly fast enough. They were all over my room. The lid on the cage started to come off as the hamsters filled it up. As I tried to shove the lid back down, I sliced through a couple of their bodies and there was guts and blood all over the place. I started calling for someone to come and help me, but no one did. Eventually I just stood in my room and watched as the hamsters started to take over everything. It was fucking scary and it was fucking nasty. I woke up and stared at the wall for like 10 minutes, wondering why I had such a horrible dream. Figures. Perfect representation of my weekend. I feel sad today. I fucked up over the weekend with Paul and now I carry the guilt of our fight. I have so much to do this week. Our show opens a week from Friday and today I just dont feel excited. Instead I feel sad and alone. I wish I hadnt screwed up so badly with my boy. I have rehearsal every night this week and at this point, it seems as though I will never make it through to Friday. I also go to the dermatologist at 4pm today to see if I can get this dry skin/rash thing on my face taken care of once and for all. I hope tomorrows a better day.

 oh YES! It is ALMOST THE WEEKEND!!!!!!! I couldnt be any more excited. Back in the day when I used to go home every day after work and get drunk cuz I had nothing better to do, I felt as though I never really earned my weekends. Now, it is the ONLY time that I have to do my errands, have some fun, suck down a vodka tonic or 11 and stay up past 2am for pure ENJOYMENT! My boss told me today that I look really run down. Thanks boss, but also, he couldnt be more right. So tired, so worn out, so EXCITED to perform this PLAY! (ok, calm down a bit Joe) I just farted I got so excited. My mom just called. She is coming to the show THREE TIMES! Not only is she coming down for both Saturday performances, she is taking a train down with some friends of hers from work to go to the Thursday night performance as well. She is so damn cute, I feel like I could die with love. UM! One of the students that is a member of the organization I work for just came in and told me that she and a couple friends of hers are coming to the show too! They just made reservations. AY YI YI! I feel so supported and loved. Man, I better do a good job. OK, change of topic, Im getting so nervous my bowels are starting to bubble up! So last night I got home to find little hamster Neechee sitting on TOP of his rolling ball. (I bought him this little plastic ball that he can use to run around my room.) When hes not running through my bedroom all willy nilly, I put the ball in the cage so he can continue his exercise routine. Well, last night I found him on top of the ball with his hands pressed against the lid of the cage. He was totally trying to get out. I took the lid off and he crawled right into my hand. I then let him run around my room for a bit inside his ball of love. Kimberly, the gender-bending hamster, decided she wanted out too and when I picked her up, she immediately crawled into the crevice of my neck and went to sleep. It was so fucking cute that I almost started to cry. But then I realized that crying was a bit over dramatic, so I settled for eating her out. You understand. About a half an hour later, and after I smoked myself a bowl of the pot, I realized that I had forgotten all about Neechee running around my room. I went to find him and noticed that he had escaped from the ball. Frantically I looked everywhere for that little guy and guess where I found him? Inside one of my dirty socks! I knelt down by the sock and when he peeked his head out, he got so scared by my gigantic head staring back at him. I picked up the sock and put him back in his cage. He had had enough fun for the evening. Ok, so when I was at lunch today, I almost ran into a blind lady being guided around by her Seeing Eye dog. I stepped around her as she breezed past me. Suddenly, and without any warning, the dog stopped moving and took a huge crap on the sidewalk. Right in front of the local food market. I watched her, wondering what she would do next. Without hesitation, she grabbed a plastic bag from inside her pocket, squatted next to where the shit was and felt around until she found the huge smelly pieces. She picked each piece up, wrapped it together, and threw it in the trash. My first instinct was to doubt that she was blind, considering that she performed the whole exercise with such expertise. But no, she was truly blind and she cleaned up after her dog more efficiently than 85% of this cities dog owners. It was a sight I wont forget for a long time. What else, what else Last night as I was coming home from rehearsal, I walked right by the Making the Band 2 folks filming some sort of promotional video. It was so cool. I very rarely stop and gape at things that happen in Times Square. (that is just sooooo tourist) But when I saw Babs and Fred and Chopper chilling out, I had to stop and be as lame as possible. I just LOVE those guys. I am SO buying the album when it comes out. Cept dont tell anyone, k? I dont want anyone to think that I am turning all gangsta style. Fucking gangsta be droppin mad hits yo. snore. urlLink Ari just got into a HUGE fight with one of my co-workers and it was (by far) the best moment of my whole day. urlLink Ari screamed out You are a PSYCHOPATH and then proceeded to mock her until her face turned a shade of beet and she was forced to walk away and stew in her office. It was HILARIOUS! And also, it was EROTIC. Cept not so much erotic. Ah the days of working with oil and vinegar. I will surely miss them when my theater career takes off. Alrighty oh! Tonight we are painting the theater space while running lines. Someone had mentioned that we could drink beers during it and although no one has mentioned it since, I have decided that it is my personal responsibility to pick up a case and bring it over. Cuz, if you are going to offer up the possibility of having beer at rehearsal, then you can count on me to take that offer and make sweet, sweet love to it. HOT! Friday, Friday around the corner I couldnt be(!) any more hornder. I will eat and drink and smoke away my life, And cut on my genitals with a super sharp knife! What will YOU do this weekend?

 IMPORTANT NOTICE If you sent me a donation for my upcoming production (you know who you are), please send me an email indicating the following things: 1) How you want your name listed in the program 2) What your home address is so the company can send you a thank you letter 3) If you like Chocolate Cake. (just cuz I am curious) If you can, do this ASAP. I want to turn in your information tonight at rehearsal. Thanks again to all of you who donated. Without you, this production would never have happened! Much love.

 So it figures. Now I dont like Ian anymore. I just thought about what I was doing and decided that I needed to put an immediate halt on it. Whats the point in sitting around and fantasizing about something that could never happen? I was just getting wrapped up in the whole I am in a show with a cute boy syndrome. Usually I NEVER have crushes on guys that I am in shows with. I prefer not to date people in the entertainment business cuz they tend to be incredibly selfish, emotionally erratic, and overly dramatic. Basically, all of the qualities that represent me. So why would I want to date someone exactly the same? Answer: I wouldnt. Ian is SO not my type. I dont know why I let it consume me yesterday. I think its because I have a real problem with wanting guys that I cant have. UGH! At 26 years old, I should REALLY be over that petty shit by now. Ah well. Maybe at 36 it will be different. Rehearsal was ok last night. We were all a little off, not totally focused. I found Ians performance to be better than it has been in the past, but I found his attitude to suck big time. I dont know. Its hard to explain. He is a very aggressive, macho type of person, so its hard to read him all the time. He is usually sweet with me and lowers his guard within the first couple of minutes of us being together. But last night, something was off. Our subway ride home was filled with weak conversation and to be honest, I felt like some of it was strained. He was telling me about his girlfriend and how he doesnt know if they will end up together. I tried to be as supportive as I possibly could, but after awhile, his attitude was bugging me so much that I had to just ditch the whole conversation. We sat in silence for a couple stops and then I was like See ya later. He realized that I was pulling away, so he tried to step it up a bit, but it was too late. I turned my back and walked out the door. Gosh, so much game playing that its making me want to puke on his face. In any case Tonight, Kelly and the other owners of the Theater Company are going to meet the playwrights best friend to discuss everything that is happening. He will tell them what nights he is coming to the show as well as what night the playwrights parents are coming. It is SO exciting for us and I know that everyone involved in this production is completely thrilled. We are going to be performing for people that KNEW John Russell! Wow. Its totally unreal. In the show, Kelly and I have to carry around notebooks that we store our poetry in. My character is often described as a tortured poet and Kimberly is quoted at saying I have all of these feelings, I need to get them out somehow. Its quite an ingenious concept, considering that when I was 17, I carried a notebook filled with poetry and thoughts as well. To delve further into our characters, Kelly and I have been writing daily entries into these books. Here are two sample poems that I have written. Now remember that I am writing as a 17-year-old closet case that is in love with a 17-year-old straight boy (interesting parallels, eh?): TRUTH Truthfully I adore you. Your eyes so beautiful So intense So focused. So real. Why does this hurt so much? Deep aching from the inside out. I shouldnt love you. But I do. LIES You fucker. You lied to me. Why do you hurt those that love you? Why do you make me cry? You do it on purpose. Asshole! You see me follow you. You see me trust you. You see me want you. You see me give my heart without question. And you dont care. Its done. Im walking away from you. Im leaving you behind. No more tears will be wasted on you. No more nights spent sleepless. Goodbye. Forever. Hilarious, right? I love writing like a little kid. Not that this journal is much different. I just call it little kid writing so you wont judge me. Fucking stop judging me. Fucking judgers. And I will leave you with that. Its so sunny in NYC today. Im thinking its the calm before the HURRICANE! ISBABELLA SNORES! I wont care about it unless it sucks the subway system up into the eye and then spits it out over Jersey. Then I wont have to go to work! YAHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOpth. Peace!

 Stupid Joe. Stupid stupid stupid. I have been SO good with my eating habits lately. Im talking seriously good. I have cut fast food completely out of my diet and I have limited my portions to an amount that is suitable for the not so growing boy that I am. That is, until last night. Paul got to my place around 9pm. I had already eaten dinner and was working on a bowl of Fruity Pebbles when he surprised me at my apartment. At 11pm, he wanted to go to McDonalds to grab a burger and I thought that since I have been so good lately, that I could have some Donalds too. Well, I ate a grilled chicken and some french fries and for the rest of the evening, I lay in bed clutching my stomach. At 5am, I finally got out of bed to rid myself of the garbage and now at 11am, I sit at my desk burping up puke filled hatred from the depths of my stomach. Why oh WHY did I eat McDonalds at 11pm?!?!? Fucking stupid! A waste of calories and even worse, my stomach is RAGING today. I feel like shit. There is a reason why I am typing this entry so early today. I have to get some things off my mind. Things about Ian. Fine, I admit it. I like him. I like him a lot. I have a HUGE crush on him. Theres nothing I could doit just happened. There is no doubt in my mind that I have lost the bet to Kelly and that I will be doing her laundry. At this point, I cant even hide the fact that I am swooning heavily over this straight boy. GRRRRR. I had a feeling it was coming, but now there is no denying the fact that I want him for my own. On Friday night, Ian and I went out for drinks so that we could have the chance at getting to know each other better. We started at a sports bar and after one drink, I moved us over to a gay bar that was down the block. I just felt more comfortable with him there, rather than competing with the rednecks playing beer pong at a nearby table. Ian was very open to moving to a gay bar. Ian and I talked about everything. Our families, our past relationships, our thoughts on the show, theater in general, hopes, dreams, and desires. He is an incredibly interesting person and he is a lot of fun to talk to. The play flirting continued throughout the evening and I finally just had to ask him if he was ever bi-curious in his life. I was very shocked at his answer. And I wish that I could dive in and explain it all in here, but its not fair of me to do that to him. Everything I was told was to stay in complete confidence. So I will keep it that way. But lets just say that Ian is open to the idea of having a gay relationship, with the right guy. Ian told me that I was incredibly good looking. He told me that I am unlike any of the other gay people he has met. He told me that he likes hanging out with me and talking to me and that he wants us to get together this week to spend more time with each other. Ian also told me that he has purchased an engagement ring for his girlfriend and that at some point over the next couple of years, he hopes to propose to her and begin their life together. After hanging together for a couple of hours, Ian asked me to go to his apartment so that I could see his pad and meet his girlfriend. I did go and was a bit overwhelmed. His girlfriend is AMAZING. She is pretty and sweet and a bit shy. Ian talked about me to her as though he and I have been friends for a really long time. He showed me numerous pictures of his family and friends and when it was time for me to go, he and his girlfriend walked me to the subway. It was one of the most thoughtful things any new friend has every done. Ian and I spent a great deal of the night talking about our friendship and about the little quirks that drive the other person crazy. He says that sometimes he feels like I want to be his friend and sometimes he feels like I want nothing to do with him. Thats a fair assessment. When I mentioned that I was unhappy with the way our kiss went last Thursday, he said that he felt the same way and that we should practice a bit tonight before we start the rehearsal. I was all for it. (obviously) We made tentative plans to go costume shopping this weekend and also to get together one night before rehearsal to work on character development and line memorization. Both his ideas. The reason all of this bothers me so much is two fold: 1) I really like Ian. I like him a lot. Definitely more than I should. Im not like in love with him or anything, but I do have a serious crush on him. Physically hes not really my type, but conversationally, I cant get enough. Sometimes, when I think about him, it makes my stomach hurt. Sometimes when I know that I wont see him again for a couple of days, it makes me frustrated and a bit sad. Cuz I KNOW I cant just pick up the phone to call him and see how hes doing. To do that with a straight boy would bewellgay. I have a boyfriend and things are going well. Im not at all in the place to be looking for other guys. But why does it seem as though every guy I meet, I fall for. ESPECIALLY if they are straight or committed in another relationship. Even more especially, if theyre both. Ian does not want to date me. He does not want to drop his girlfriend of 3 years for me. I dont want to do that with Paul either. But why do I feel so intensely about this? Why? 2) Ian has worked very hard at his relationship with his girlfriend. He has never cheated on her, although she has cheated on him. He is dedicated, caring, sweet, and kind to herall parts of his personality that no one else in the show has seen, beside me. They have a wonderful rapport together and it is very clear to me that they are deeply in love. It is not my place to make Ian question his relationship, his sexuality. If I see a loophole in his theory, it is not right for me to capitalize on it. This is one person that I cant have and I have to understand that. It isnt fair for me to do anything to jeopardize any of this. Ian and I have the potential to become really good friends. It is totally possible that we will get through this experience and become incredibly close. I want that. I really do. I want to have a straight guy friend that I can talk to and learn from. But why do I ALWAYS fall for them? Its because I cant have them, right? Its because it is the ultimate challenge and I am bored unless I try to go for it. But its not like I am doing it intentionally. The feelings I have for him have happened against my better judgement and there seems no way for me to separate reason from logic. Fuck. I dont know. All I do know is that I am really excited to spend time with him at rehearsal tonight. I am excited to kiss him and I am excited to help him in his part for the show. I am excited to talk to him, be around him, and for him to make me feel important. I am majorly confused as to why this is happening to meagain.

 HOLY FUCK! I just got the biggest and most wonderful news EVER! Are you sitting down? Cuz if not, please do so. Kelly just called me at work and told me something that is BLOWING OUR MINDS!!! Ok, here is the quick backstory: The guy who wrote the play we are doing, John Russell, died of AIDS before the show debuted off-Broadway. Due to the circumstances surrounding his death, the play had a very short run and closed a month or so after opening. Now, in order to get the copyrights for this production, Kelly and Megan have been talking directly with friends of John Russell about the guidelines for doing the show. WELL! Kelly just received a phone call from the guy who handles the copyrights and he told her that not only is HE coming to see the show, so are the PARENTS of John Russell! And not only are THEY coming to see the show, but their BUSINESS INVESTOR is coming as well and if they like what they see, they are going to talk to us about INVESTING IN THE PRODUCTION!!! UMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM! This is HUGE news. HUGE. I mean, of course, it could mean nothing. It could just be a really big compliment to us by having actual friends and family of John Russell be at one of the performances. OR it could go as big as Broadway. Really, the possibilities are endless. Its dependent on a number of things, but I cant BELIEVE that we are going to have the honor of having these IMPORTANT and INFLUENTIAL people in our audience! FUCKING YAY!!!!!!!!!! This is especially good news since last night we rehearsed the ending of the show for the first time and let me tell youit is GOOOOOOOOD. By the last scene, Kelly and I were both sobbing on stage and it was incredibly powerful. And it was only our FIRST time through the scene. We all left rehearsal a bit overwhelmed and absolutely stoked about the progress we are making. Holy shit my head is spinning off its axis right now. God is so good. He gave me this show to do and all of the wonderful experiences that have come out of it. And now hes giving us the chance to take this show to the next level. I have never been so excited for anything in my entire life. Could this be the start of my career?!!?!?!?!?! Ian and I are off to drinks tonight. We kissed onstage for the first time last night and it was incredible. He handled it with style and grace and we grew even closer as friends. We also discussed the possibility of putting up a show together after this one is done. Ok, I have to go. I have to call my parents immediately!!!!!!!!!!!!! Everyone have a wonderful weekend. Mine is already starting out in the most life changing way. THANK YOU GOD!!!!

 In reverence to all of those innocent lives lost on September 11th, 2001, this journal will have no post today. Instead, please take a minute out of your day to pray for the souls of both the victims and the perpetrators of this horrifying act of terrorism. Aside from that, do what you need to do to get yourself through the day. And No matter how angry you may still be, please remember that God judges each human beings heart. Not us. I thank Jesus that no one close to me was hurt or killed as a result of this tragedy. Peace.

 I screwed up the links yesterday, so I am going to give another shout out to my friend over at Inya Head . Loving you already my man. Everyone else should jump on board with him. urlLink Inya Head

 Last nights rehearsal was groundbreaking for me. I have a monologue in the show that requires me to invest a lot of emotion into it. Until last night, I wasnt able to bring myself to the point that I needed to be at. Ive been working on it for quite a while and have hit a few obstacles. Last night, by the end of the monologue, I was able to bring myself to tears. I cried!! Its exactly where I need to be for the monologue. It felt so exhilarating and good! Crying on stage is just about the hardest thing for any actor to do. It requires full investment in the subject material and confidence in yourself in order to allow true tears to come forth. When rehearsal was over, I felt emotionally spent, but I also felt like an actor that could conquer the world. Having not performed in over 3 years has given me quite a few doubts within myself. But last night changed all that. I am the actor that I used to be. On the flip side, Ian and I are getting closer as friends, but the relationship is taking a turn for the irritating. We have this thing where we bust each others balls from the beginning of rehearsal until the end. As each rehearsal comes and goes, the ball busting gets more and more intense. I guess this is what straight guys and gay guys do to each other when they are trying to form a friendship. I dont know. I havent had a straight guy friend in a while. Also, Ian wont keep his hands off of me. Last night we took rehearsal pictures for the website (btw, they came out great!) and I was wearing a pair of suspenders. (My character is a loserI wasnt wearing them because I thought they were fashionably acceptableplease) Ian kept running his hands up and down them and snapping them on my back and blah blah blah. It was flirting in its purest form. Then, while the cast was sitting and discussing the show, Ian puts his hand on my knee and starts massaging my leg. I acted as though I wasnt paying attention, assessing how long he was going to continue the rub down. He rubbed for a good 20 seconds and then I looked at him and he smiled. My response was Take your hand off my leg or I am going to take this to a level that you wont be comfortable with. His response was Try me. Yeahok Ian. Kelly and I discussed this for a bit on the commute home and we both agreed that Ian just doesnt know how to be around gay guys. At least not gay guys like me. Ian has numerous gay acquaintances, but he, according to him, has none that are like me. Meaning, that he has none that are as easily accessible as I am. Meaning that I am pretty straight acting, good looking, and cool. Hows THAT for a mid-entry ego boost? I do think Ian wonders what it would be like to kiss me. I do think Ian wonders what it would be like to use his friendship with me as an opportunity to explore some of the thoughts and feelings that he has dealt with in the past. However, he is 24 years old and in a relationship with a girl for over 3 years. Hes not gay. But he is curious. And why wouldnt he be? I represent the straight mans outlet for sexual exploration. I dont say this in a cocky way at all. I say this in a I have been in this situation with straight men dozens of times before way. Ian doesnt realize that I know every move hes going to make before he does. This shit has happened to me with so many guys before, that basically I could predict his next move. At one point, Ian called me a bitch. Now, as urlLink Ari knows and as most of my friends know, I do not accept that word as a description of myself. Sure, I can be a bitch. What human being cant? But for a straight man to call me a bitch is totally emasculating and it is something that I refuse to tolerate. I didnt ream him for it, but I made my point clear. Dont call me that word. You wont like the bitch that I can really be. He laughed it off and called me it again 20 minutes later. Friday night we are going out for drinks and all of these issues will be addressed. While its fun for me to have a friend crush on Ian, it is nothing that I take too seriously. Ideally, Id love to walk away from this experience with a straight guy friend. A guy that I can hang with, bullshit with, explore different aspects of my personality with. But this is all to be determined by the way we treat each other over the next couple of weeks. We shall see NOW! In related newsRita, you are never going to believe this The last time I performed in Stupid Kids , my friend Mark played the part that Ian is currently playing. I had a HUGE crush on Mark during the show and although Mark is straight, Mark is one of the guys that I coincidentally turned gay for a little while. Mark and I have spent nights in each others bed, we have kissed each other, we cried together, we became very close. After I graduated, we continued to keep in touch, but the relationship was strained because he is straight and I am gay and we crossed the line. (see what I am saying about having been through this situation before? And Mark is just the tip of the iceberg) I emailed him to let him know that I was in Stupid Kids and he just wrote me back and told me that he is going to come! I have only seen Mark once since I graduated from college, so this is a pretty big deal to me. Having him in the audience is a thrill for me and will give us a chance to get to know each other again. I will always have a soft spot in my heart for Mark. He is one of the most immature and beautiful men I have ever had the pleasure of knowing. He just joined up with the grad. school program at the university that employs me. I have a feeling that Mark and I have a lot more history to make together before we move on to different parts of our lives. Look at me with all of my boys splayed out. If Ive said it once, Ive said it a quadrillion times, I am boy crazy. I will be 85, and done with 2 wonderful marriages and will STILL be talking about how I made this guy gay, this guy cry, and this guy want to kill me. Its just the way that it goes in the life of Joe CuttheShit.

 Welcome to two new friends! Most importantly... urlLink Inya Head and second most importantly is: urlLink Cornsmut

 YO YO YO! YoYo Ma. I have just finished going through our Clothing Pantry at work in order to find a costume for the show. My character is a huge loser, so I figured that a clothing pantry would be the best place to try to find my character something to wear. I have chosen a pair of green pants that fit pretty well, but are totally out of style. They remind me of an Old Navy-esque khaki from like 1996. Perfect. The shirts I picked are both button downs and of a sickly color. AND, the find of the daya set of 3 Stooges suspenders. Now, hows THAT for loser? Im not sure that this will be my final costume, but its a good start. We are taking some rehearsal pictures tonight to put up on the Theater Companys brand new website! Its all pretty exciting. We are in the process of sending out reminder postcards to everyone that received a mailing about the show and let me tell you.the postcards are AWESOME! I am SO excited. From what I hear, the website is going to be PRETTY bomb. Working with this company was such a good idea. Dont forget that we are still taking donations for the show. Just in case you wanted to throw a couple bones our way. I am so blessed to have had my friends in NYC throw me some cash, as well as a couple friends of mine from school. One friend, in particular, sent me $25 and I was shocked! Of all of my girls from school, this girl and I arent the bestest of friends, but she totally supported me in my theater endeavor and proved to me that she really does care about what Im doing in NYC. I was overwhelmed by her generosity. I sent out an email yesterday telling everyone to make reservations for the show and you would not BELIEVE the response I got. The theater space that we are using only holds about 40-50 people at a time. At this point, I have already reserved 30 tickets just for people that I know. And more are on their way! I love that the space holds such few people because it makes the performance so intimate, and allows the audience to really be a part of the production. The only downfall is that once all of the tickets are reserved for a certain night, we have to turn people away or offer them standing room only. Im a bit nervous that some of my friends who let things go to the last minute will not be able to go, or at least not on the night that they would prefer. Gah! I worry about too much. God will take care of it all. I just have to let it happen. Had another horrifying dream last night. In the dream I was in the house I grew up in. It was nighttime and my parents, brother, and I were watching a movie. We see a flickering light outside and I go over to the window to see whats going on. About a block away, I see a friend of mines house totally engulfed in flames. I can hear people screaming from inside. I call out to my parents and brother who run over to the window and we all stand there watching the house burn down. There seems to be no one else on the street. All I can hear is the crackling of flames and people screaming to be helped. I lean against the window and realize that its hot. My parents grab me by my shoulders and pull me back into the depths of the living room. Without warning, the windows blow in and flames shoot all over the couch, walls, carpet, etc. My brother and parents open a door and run into our basement. (A basement that we didnt have while living there. I dont know WHY I created that in my dream) When I went to join them in the basement, the stairs collapsed and fire spread all over the entrance. I called out to my parents, but there was no sound. They were gone. I ran through the house trying to find an exit, but couldnt. My heart was pounding in my chest as I started to realize that I wasnt going to make it out of the house alive. I found my bedroom door ajar and ran into the room and barricaded it. I sat down on the bed, knowing that I was trapped, knowing that I was going to die. After a few moments, the bedroom door burst open and flames went everywhere. I backed up against the wall and it was then that I woke up. I woke up from the dream around 6am this morning and was unable to fall back to sleep. All I could hear in my head was the screaming from my next door neighbors begging to be helped. And I couldnt get the image of my parents disappearing into the basement out of my head. The clock ticked by until the alarm clock eventually went off and I got out of bed. It was horrible. I dont know why I keep having these bad dreams. Some people say that nightmares are a sign that things in your personal life are in upheaval. That is true for me. Everything is so hectic, crazy, and unstable for me right now that it makes perfect sense that my subconscious would be going nuts. It would just be nice to wake up one morning and NOT feel like I am going to burst into tears. Ah well I am so excited for rehearsal tonight. Not only are we having people take pictures, we are going to have a mini-audience. YAYAYAYAYAYAYAY! Everything is starting to come to a head and I couldnt be more thrilled.

 To all of the obsessed Real World/Road Rules people: For reasons that I can't explain... The information about Colin and Melissa from The Real World has been removed. Sorry to disappoint!

 Happy Monday! Sick. Never. But I did have an incredible weekend! I was so busy that I never had a chance to sit around. I love weekends like that. I felt so productive and important. It was such a wonderful change of pace. And I came out of it a father. But I will explain that in a minute. Friday night I had drinks with my two loves, Angie and Kelly. We had planned to go out with some friends of ours, but ended up having such a good time the three of us that we opted out of it and partied in my apartment. After hours of drinking and singing and playing games, the three of us went out to a nice restaurant and spent the money we WOULD have saved on dinner. It was terribly fun. After we were finished eating, Kelly and I walked home and ran right into the star of urlLink Take Me Out . (Kelly had taken me to see this Broadway play in July and we were thrilled to see the lead guy!) Saturday was the day to end all days. I got up at 8:30am to talk to my brother. We spoke for about a half an hour and then I showered and went down to the rehearsal space to knock down one of the walls. Yes. You read that correctly. Little gay Joe put on some work gloves and joined Ian in ripping down the kitchen area that was taking up too much room in our space. It was so manly and fun and I had plaster in my hair until this morning. I think everyone was a bit surprised at hot strong and aggressive I can be once given the chance. It was hot. At around 1:30pm, the owner of the space came in to check on our progress and freaked out at the fact that we were sawing one of his countertops in half. (Needless to say, we had gotten prior permission) This joke of a man (weighing easily 2,359 pounds) screamed at all of us until I basically told him to go fuck himself. He stormed out and came back 20 minutes later to continue the verbal berating. I went out to have a cigarette to calm myself down. (I cant STAND people belittling my friends, especially when it was clearly not justified) When I came back into the building, fat fuck was still yelling at everyone. I joined the rest of the group in trying to explain to him that he was acting like a psycho. Suddenly Ian, who remained quiet during most of it, BLEW UP! He started screaming at the owner, in the same way that the owner was screaming at the girls. It got way out of hand. Before we knew it, Ian and the owner were standing in the hallway, screaming at the top of their lungs, spit flying all over the place. Their chests were puffed out against each other and then Ian screams: Go ahead! Hit me fucker. Hit me once and Ill knock you on your ass! (told you Ian was MAN!) I immediately ran over, put my arms around Ian and took him outside. (Side note---I thought Ian might shove me aside, but instead he wrapped his arm around my shoulder and let me take him with me---it was very sweet and wonderful) Once outside, Ian and I talked about what happened and I was able to calm him down. Inside, the owner was freaking out, but the girls eventually calmed him down as well. Luckily it all worked out and everyone left on decent terms. It was fucking crazy and the closest I have ever come to getting into a fight. Although, clearly I was not in the fight. You understand. After all this shit went down, we all went for some food and beverages at Applebees. Ian and I both ordered a mug of beer, which turned out to be a pitcher each. He and I sat next to each other and play flirted the whole time, while the 5 of us talked about the days adventures. Ian and I moved our date to this upcoming Friday. Man, I just love hanging out with this kid. Instead of going home, Kelly and I went over to see our friend Mariah who is going through a life crisis. She asked me not to write about whats going on with her in this journal, so I wont. But basically, things in her life have gotten severely out of control. Kelly and I hung with her for a couple of hours, until we were sure that she was going to be ok. After that, we headed home. When we got to the front of our building, we noticed that somebody had abandoned an adorable hamster on the sidewalk. It had all of the food and bedding with it, so we thought that maybe somebody was moving out and that they were going to pick him up soon. We spoke to our landlord about it and he said that the hamster had been sitting there for most of the day. We immediately picked up the cage and brought him inside. Once we got up to our apartment, Kelly and I ran around trying to get everything set up for him. Out of nowhere, Kelly starts screaming for me to join her in my bedroom. When I arrived there I immediately saw why she was screaming. Instead of one hamster, there were two!!! We BURST out laughing and named them Kimberly and Neechee (Our character names in our show). We cleaned the cage and set them up in a lap of luxury. And let me tell you, these little boogers are so friendly and CUTE! I have no idea why somebody would have dropped them off on the curb. They love to eat out of your hand and when I woke up this morning and turned on my light, they woke up too and stood with their legs pressed against the side of their cage. They were saying Good morning! I rewarded them with some hand fed sunflower seeds. We think Kimberly is pregnant. She doesnt run around as much as Neechee does. And Neechee caters to her every whim. Kimberly always sleeps in this little tin can that came with the cage and last night, when she got out to get something to eat, Neechee ran inside the can and tried to go to sleep. Kimberly walked around for a little bit and then crammed herself into the can with Neechee. I watched closely as Kimberly shoved Neechee out of the can and took it back as her own. It was hysterical! And reminded me a lot of guy-girl relationships. Or guy-guy relationships, considering the fact that I am SO Kimberly in mine. I still havent decided what to do if Kimberly gives birth. I will probably just let the babies stay in the cage so that Neechee can eat them alive. I dont know what else to do. I cant have 35 hamsters living in my bedroom. Plus, babies are probably a really good source of protein. Neechee will grow up to be big and strong. I just love them. I feel like Kelly and I rescued them from dying and now I want them to be my babies forever. I went to K-mart yesterday and bought one of those little hamster ball things so that they can run around my bedroom whenever they want. They just love it. So yeah, what a great weekend it was! I am a proud father of two beautiful hamsters, I got to spend quality time with Ian and Paul, had a great time with Angie and Kelly, and even got to sleep in late on Sunday. Ahh, the life. Now, back to a weeks worth of intense rehearsals. But Im excited about it. Everything is going so well and I am truly happy.

 Administrative Assistants shouldnt work nearly as hard as I do. Nuff said. So, yesterday was the most chaotic day of my life. Among other things, I was once again reminded that not only is this journal popular, its way too public. A good friend of mine was hurt by something I wrote in these pages after she stumbled across the site. Then I was asked to remove certain items from my journal that was destroying someones very guarded privacy. I didnt want to remove this stuff, but since I care so deeply about the people in my life, I thought it only fair to do what was asked of me. Could this journal BE any more censored? Its sad, to say the least, and I feel terrible about what happened. Reason #1 why I dont give out this journals web address to my friends. There is always the chance that someone will read something and not understand the way in which it was intended. This is MY journal. No one elses and I hate having to make excuses for it. But I guess thats the problem you run into when you post thoughts and information in a public domain. Fuck it. Its over. I dont want to think about it anymore. Rehearsal last night was INTERESTING. I have been writing lately about how Ian, the guy in the show with me, is becoming my new straight man crush. Well, let me explain a bit better. I dont go for straight guys unless I have just cause. In fact, I am so over the whole straight boy thing at this point that I find it a waste of my time to flirt and play around with this type of ridiculous activity. Thats why this thing with Ian is throwing me for a loop. Its been a long time since I have had a straight guy flirt with me for no apparent reason. For examplehere are some statements that came out of Ians mouth in the last 48 hours that have lead me to believe that he has some sort of special connection with me. (Aside from the fact that we are actors together in the same production) To the director and Stage Manger, he said: "Sure, I will come and help out on Saturday. Make sure to bring gloves, hammers, beer, and.Joe." To the director he said: "We need to figure out a way to get down the stairs before the next scene. Why doesnt Joe give me a piggy back down (them)?" I responded with "Ian, YOU should be the one that gives ME the piggy back. Youre the man in this relationship." He responded by winking at me. To me he said: "I was thinking about you last night and was going to call. But then I thought that you would think that was fucking weird." I responded with "Yeah, that is fucking weird." On top of these little blurbs that come out of his mouth, he is consistently paying more attention to me than he is anyone else. He is constantly wrestling around with me and punching me and staring at me and Without sounding like a total egocentric idiot, he is acting the way that all of the other straight guys I bedded have acted. I am still a firm believer that Ian is straight and I have worked very hard at not giving him any reason to believe that I have a friendly little crush on him. I find him to be so adorable and fun. Thats all. But I do like the fact that he shows me this extra attention. Its just so reminiscent of the days of college. The days when I would make straight guy friends discern if they could be even partially gay and then have them kiss me and hold me in my bed. I just have this way . Ask any of my friends. So, I am pretty excited to spend Sunday afternoon with him, drinking beers and getting to know each other outside of rehearsal. Dont get me wrong, Im not looking for a new BOYFRIEND or even a HOOK-UP. I am very happy with Paul and how things are going between us. Its just FUN to have this type of thing going on. Ians an awesome guy and I hope to be proud to call him my friend. Friend that wants to hold me in my bed. Sike. So thats it. I gotta go home now. Its already 2:15pm and I am STILL at work. But I didnt want to leave without telling everyone to have an EXCELLENT weekend! So..have an EXCELLENT weekend!

 When I was in the Poconos this weekend I had the most horrifying dream about my brother. In the dream, all of my friends and family and random people from my life were staying at a condo together. (not much unlike the condo I was at while away this weekend) My brother was home from the war, but he still had on his fatigues and other ARMY getup. We were all having an excellent time together when my brother announced that he was going to step outside for a minute. He left the condo and I went to the window to watch him walk down the stoop. He turns and puts his head against the wall and out of nowhere, this Iraqi looking person runs up behind him, puts a gun to the back of his head and blows it right off. Right in front of me. I burst into hysterics, but after that everything gets a bit fuzzy. Everyone surrounds me and comforts me and I cry and cry and cry. Moments later everyone goes on with their weekend as though nothing has happened. Every time I think about my brother, I begin to cry again. I can still remember the heartache I felt in my chest. My friends gathered around me and told me that I just needed to get over it and to move on. When I kept sobbing, they got a little more forceful about it and said Its over. Hes dead. You need to let it go. The rest of the dream was spent with me sobbing and nobody doing anything to make it any better. It was horrible. When I woke up, I was still in the Poconos. I immediately told Rita and a couple of other people about the dream and they were incredibly supportive. But still, I have a hole in my stomach when I think about it. Oddly enough, my brother called while I was getting my haircut today. I hate when I miss his call. Especially after that disgusting dream. UghI gotta try to let it go somehow. Thank God it is almost Friday. My job is wearing me the fuck down. I have NO time for play and it is driving me MADDDDDDDDDDDDDD. Mad with 14 Ds of course. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! 19 As. I have been in an excellent mood all week, despite the chaos that is my life. I think I am most happy when I am busy. I have no time to sit around and think about what a sad sack I can be. I work best in overdrive. But eventually the stick will burn out and I will need a break. But for nowI push through with a smile. Ian, the guy in the show with me, asked me to go out for drinks with him this weekend. I had mentioned it to him a couple of weeks ago and he loved the idea. Last night he says Joe, do you want to go out this weekend? Elated, I say Yeah, sure (still trying to play it cool). He responds with It will be our little date. Immediately I had to shut him out. Dont be cute with me Ian, or I will immediately fall head over heels in love with you. God, it seems like no matter how old I get, straight men will always be my lust men of choice. They are just so inherently MANLY! Ian also has this new thing where he pinches me and punches me and slaps me all the time. I guess thats what straight guys do with other straight guys, but umI like it too much. Next time he slaps me, I am going to wrestle him to the ground and kiss him on his man mouth. You understand. Did you hear that Justin Timberlake is the new spokesperson for McDonalds? The commercials will air in the US starting on September 29th. Get ready for major overload of the Timberlake. Hes going to drive his career right into the ground with this shit. Can anyone say over-exposure? Britney did it to herself and now she is lovehated by everyone on the planet. So when Justin starts with his Im lovin it (his catch phrase) nonsense, make sure not to shit directly onto your television. Thats just a mess to clean up. Peace out jiggaz. TOMORROW IS FUCKING FRIDAY! FUCK! (fuck in a good way)

 Holy fuckin fuck! Work has been a madhouse for the last two days! I thought I was busy beforeOMG! Im not kidding when I say that I broke a sweat about 15 minutes ago. I decided that sweat was totally unnecessary and that it was time for me to start taking my job a little less seriously. In which case, I write a quickie entry in my journal. Unfortunately, due to the craziness of the office place I am going to be unable to do a VMA recap. This is what I will tell you: The show basically sucked, with the exception of the over-hyped Britney/Madonna/Christina kiss. The performance by Beyonce was decent until it exploded with energy and excitement right at the end. That bitch can dance AND sing. She was amazing. Justin was too high on his britches for the entire show. (Bitch didnt even peform!) He acted like such a cocky asshole and I think I might be starting to lose my interest in that playboy. He is SO getting on my nerves. Humility, anyone? Thats about it. The rest of the show was chock full of the same people up for the same awards (50 Cent, Justin, Beyonce, Snore). I was just glad that I had a bottle of wine while watching it. Made it a bit less painful to watch. Based on past years, this VMA show totally blew. And you KNOW how much I love MTV. It MUST HAVE sucked for me to have nothing to write about. Last night I went to Pauls apartment after an INCREDIBLE rehearsal. I saw the space that we are using for the show and within the first hour, I fell completely in love with it. There is a TON of work that needs to be done there and I wonder how its all going to get finished in time, but I can see why Kelly and Megan would have wanted to go forward with it. Its pretty busted, but the playing space is PERFECT! And SO much fun to do the show in. Im pretty excited. And honestlyI dont give a shit if people feel weird about the building. Theyre there to see a show! And a damn good one at that. So, when I got to Pauls apartment, I found a HUGE basket filled with all sorts of presents for me. The note attached explained that Paul went out and bought me food for dinner, medicine to get over my cold, and juice, candy, and gum just to make me happy. There was so much to choose from and I was elated! When Paul walked into the apartment after work, I tackled him to the ground and covered him in kisses. I just LOVE him so so much. He is really trying and we are doing so well. I am proud of him and I am proud of our relationship. I love being in love. This weekend at the Poconos was awesome! I played so many card games, including a PITCH tournament that Rita and I won! (we each got $20!) We also played our annual Housemate Trivia game. Rita won that too! We played kickball and I pulled every muscle in both of my legs. (I am currently hobbling everywhere I walk) We went out drinking, stayed in drinking, drank with dinner, drank for breakfast, and drank our own piss. You know, just to savor every bit of alcohol possible. So much partying. No WONDER I felt like garbage on my way home Monday. Being able to have all of us be together was wonderful. There was so much gossip and talks and loveman. I loved every second of it. It was like none of us ever graduated. So little has changed. At least not with our personalities. 3 of the 6 girls (yes, I AM one of the girls) has gotten engaged, so there was a TON of wedding talk. One of the ladies, Jessica, asked me to be in her wedding. Now Im in TWO! (Rita asked me first and of course is the most important to me) The thing that stood out to me the most about the trip was that everyone took such good care of me. All of the girls know that I have very little money, due to the overly expensive nature of living in NYC, and they EACH pitched in to make my time enjoyable and on par with everyone else. I contributed $60 towards food and wine, while everyone else put in way more than that. I only paid $50 to stay at the condo, while everyone else paid $150. See what I mean? At no point did I feel embarrassed or like I was slighting anyone. My Rita took good care of me and everyone else followed suit. I had one of the best weekends ever. Cant you tell?? Alright, I gotta go. Work is kicking me in the nuts every chance it gets. Latas!

 Hi EVERYONE! What a weekend I had! Holy mother fuck it was amazing. But unfortunately, I am too busy at work to get into it right now. I will tell all stories tomorrow as well as do a mini-yet extremely important recap of the VMAs. In order to give you something to read, I have decided to answer the interview questions selected for me by my new and wonderful friend urlLink Lux . Here are your 5 Questions: 1. Who would you cast in a movie about your life? What an amazing question! Okay, if I had the choice, I would totally cast Leonardo Dicaprio. To me, he is one of the most genius actors in the entire world. He is believable and truthful in all of his performances. I could watch Leo read a Biology textbook and still find it fascinating. He finds a way to incorporate aspects of himself into every script. To me, that is the key to an honest performance. He is good looking, edgy, and possesses more talent than the Olsen bitches have money. Leo has been my favorite actor for years and I would be PROUD to have him play the part of Joe CuttheShit. 2. If you had to give up pizza or soda, which one would you choose? Impossible to answer, but since I mustI must. Goodbye pizza. Goodbye. Soda is a complete staple in my life. To me, it is sugary, carbonated water. And from what I know, people are supposed to be drinking gallons of water every day. Works for me. But I would miss pizza (EXTREMELY) for the rest of my sad existence. In fact maybe I will get a slice today just to remind myself how lucky I am to not have to make a choice. 3. How did you discover blogs and why did you start blogging? My dear friend Rita had a blog that was very successful and encouraged me to do so myself. In January of 2002, when she moved into our apartment in Queens, she sat down with my housemate Kelly and I and explained to us the fun involved with keeping an online journal. I started mine that evening and have been blogging every since. Most times its an excellent release for me. Sometimes its a creative way to express myself. And some other times its a pure hassle. But I have found that the benefits of blogging clearly outweigh the benefits of NOT blogging. So I still plug away at mine. At least until something else in my life replaces it. 4. Would you rather French-kiss Britney or Christina? Britney. I would rather HORK on Christina. 5. Where is your favorite place in New York? My favorite place in New York would have to be my bedroom. But if I couldnt have THAT as a choice, then I would say that it is a bar called SPLASH. Its a gay bar and I have never seen so many muscle bound men in my life. I very rarely get to go there, since I basically have no gay male friends. But on those nights where I get to dress up, have a vodka tonic and go meet the men of my dreamsoh man, there is nothing like it. Sure, most people would pick their favorite restaurant, or their favorite sight to see, or a place that makes them totally relaxedJoe CuttheShit picks the place that has the most muscle. YEM. THE END! The Rules: 1. If you want to participate, leave me a comment saying "interview me." 2. I will respond by asking you five questions - each person's will be different. 3. You will update your journal with the answers to the questions. 4. You will include this explanation and an offer to interview others in the same post. 5. When others comment asking to be interviewed, you will ask them five questions. Have a great night all! Be back tomorrow with full details.

 After freaking out about my lack of Halloween plans yesterday, I pulled a typical Joe move and planned the entire evening minute by minute. I made numerous phone calls and did much researching on the web to find out where we would all want to go and what we would all want to do. Here is what I came up with: 6-8pm: Kelly and I get dressed up in our costumes while singing show tunes and drinking our pre-party drinks. 8-9pm: Kelly and I go to Pauls apartment to pick him and Jen and Lisa up. We will surely pause to have another drink there. 9-10pm: The five of us go to a house party on the lower East Side in order to meet up with my friend Mariah and her entourage. 10-10:30pm: Snore ourselves to sleep at a party filled with all straight people. 10:30pm: Decide we have had ENOUGH and jump in a cab to the West Village. There we will meet up with my friend Ian from work and a bunch of his other friends. 10:30pm-12am: Hit every hot spot in the West Village looking for cheap drinks and hot boys. Goal: get as liqoured up as possible. 12am-?: Go to the Meow Mix (a hot, yet sometimes scary lesbian bar) for dancing and yet more drinks. Once one of us has taken a fall or thrown up all over the wall, we will pile into cabs and move out. Kelly, Angie and I will go home (possibly with Paul, assuming he isnt the person falling down and throwing up ehone can always hope) to eat food, smoke some bowls, and watch The Rocky Horror Picture Show . 4am: Can I go to bed now? Thats it! Now, lets see how much of this we actually get done. I always come up with these very strict time lines and we never seem to follow it. But tonight I am determined to do everything I have planned for us. Its not fun being the guy who has to keep everyone to plan, but someone has to do it. And that someone might as well be me. Especially since I tend to be the most anal-retentive person in our group. But hey, as I saidsomeones gotta do it. I thought long and hard about what to do for a costume. I usually cop out on dressing up cuz I feel so embarrassed and utterly uncreative. But this year, I decided not to go for a FUNNY costume or a CLEVER costume. It never works out well. So tonightI will bedun dun DUN!an accountant. Hahahahahaha and also zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. But its a functioning costume and it will work out. I am going to part my hair on the side, and slick it over. Then I am going to wear a really cheesy tie with a shirt that doesnt match, throw on a pair of slacks and a suit coat, and fill my shirt pocket with pens and a calculator! ROCK? ROCK! I am sure I will end up looking like a dork or a dweeb or snorey McSnoresalot, but in any case, I wont look like me. And thats the whole point! ALRIGHT! I am outtie 5000! HAPPY HALLOWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEN!

 Do you have any idea how GOOD it feels to be on vacation for a week, only to come back to a work week that started on a Wednesday?!?! I woke up this morning and thought Yay! The weekend is coming already! Its just about the breast feeling in the world. I went to bed as soon as I got home last night. I literally passed out the second I put my bag down on my floor. I slept for an hour and a half without interruption. Then I woke up, made a sandwich, and turned on Sex and the City for an hour. Although I had seen both of the episodes a couple of times, I found myself sobbing to the point of embarrassment. One of the episodes dealt with the death of Mirandas mother and my tears just flowed and flowed. Ive said it before and I will say it againit is truly one of the best acted and well written shows ever to air on television. It doesnt matter what walk of life you are on, the characters on Sex and the City enable you to identify with everything they go through. Its a rare find in a TV program. God bless you HBO. And God bless you chewy Sprees. I chomped on them for a good hour last night and loved every second. Tomorrow is Halloween. Usually this is my favorite holiday of the year, as there are really no expectations. No one to buy gifts for and no one to visit. Just a good wholesome feeling and tons of vodka tonics. How could one NOT enjoy the day? Well this year, we have been really struggling to put together some REAL Halloween plans. In the past, the holiday fell on a weekday, so it was totally acceptable to go out for happy hour, grab some McDonalds burgers and go home for a viewing of the Rocky Horror Picture Show (a tradition that Kelly and I have been taking part in 3 years in a row). But this year, the day falls on a Friday, so we wanted to make a bigger deal out of it. Initially we were going to shroom. For those of you who dont understand the drug world, this means, eat magic mushrooms. Its been years since we did that and it looks as though it will be years before we do it again. As the day got closer, no one really wanted to spend the evening acting like maniacs. Paul has decided to have a Halloween blow out in his apartment. It could be fun, but it could also be the most irritating function on the planet. I had the luxury of going out with some of Pauls friends from work a couple weeks ago and although everyone jumped all over me when I walked into the bar, they then proceeded to give me advice about my life and tell me what to do in order to be an actor. Listen people, I just went out for a casual drinknot for help with my fledgling acting career. Sheesh. So either the party will happen and everyone will be extra spooky, or the party will happen and everyone will be extra douchey. Its really a toss up. Afterwards, we will go out for some drinks in Gay Chelsea. I am dying to see the different costumes. I mean, its like a night worth of jokes that I dont even have to TRY to make. I have already decided that if I see more than one gay boy dressed up as an angel, I am going to rip those fairy wings off andrun away as fast as I can. Shit manI want a pair of fairy wings too. The role I play in my group of friends is Party Organizer. Usually its easy. Pick a bar, call everyone up and tell them to be at my apartment at a certain time. But since its Halloween everyone has something they want to do and no one has any ideas that everyone will agree to do. I will probably end up staying at home and dressing up my hamsters in super cute outfits. I mean, its not the WORST Friday night a guy could have. Since returning from California, Paul and I have been getting along famously. We have spent quite a bit of time together and I have never laughed so much in my life. He has been increasingly more affectionate and kind. I decided to reward him with a little bit of sex. It all worked out nicely. I spoke at great lengths with my uncles about Paul and my relationship. As I mentioned they gave me excellent advice. They asked me if I had ever considered couples counseling. I almost burst out laughing when they said that (and so did my friends when I mentioned it to them), but on further analysis, I believe it to be the best idea I have heard of so far. I mean, it makes perfect sense. Most people my age would never consider something like couples counseling. But I also feel like most people my age arent as committed to working through their problems within a relationship as Paul and I are. It may be a little hokey to pursue this avenue, but I also think that if we are really serious about figuring some of our shit out, counseling may truly be the way to go. Since returning we have been getting along great, so I havent even mentioned the idea to him yet. Who knows. If it gets to the point again where I have to bring it up as an option and he shoots it down, then I will. And at that point, I dont want him to think that he isnt making some major improvements. Home Improvements? ERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRUH! (that was my best Tim Allen/Home Improvement impression) Enoughs enough. Eight is Enough . No more cheesy Television sitcom jokes. I have to go figure out Halloween now. Im starting to have a nervous break down.

 Whats UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUP? Back from my trip to the beautiful state of Cali! Dammit what a good trip it was. One of the best I have ever had. My Uncles treated me so well and took complete care of me. I mean, from the wonderful food to the 150 drinks I had, everything was top notch and laden with class. I felt like I had stepped out of my economical strife and into a world filled with beauty. Their house is unbelievable and comes with a fully functioning hot tub! They have an incredible dog named Sundance. They have a wine cellar and a fully refurbished kitchen that puts the ones one MTVs Cribs to shame. They own Playstation 2 and the biggest television I have ever sat in front of. Really, being at their home was one of the most incredibly fun experiences I have ever had. They took me all over the city. We saw Lombard street and the Golden Gate Bridge and City Hall and the Opera House. We frequented the Castro district and quite a number of the other famous sites. They took me to see Beach Blanket Babylon and out to the most luxurious dinner I have ever eaten. We went to a gay bar and played cards for hours. And most importantly, we talked our faces off and really got to know each other. Saying goodbye to them was very difficult. It was a whirlwind trip and I fell into the trap of loving SF too much. Of every place I have ever been blessed to visit, San Francisco is, by far, the most beautiful. I could definitely see myself settling down there. The whole city smells like flowers and the people are so relaxed. At no point did I feel intimidated or uncomfortable. I love it there and am desperate to go back again next year. My uncles treated me like a princess. They did my laundry for me, made me fantastic dinners, and offered everything they own to me as though I live in their house with them. They even had a gift bag with tons of fun stuff in it waiting on the bed for me when I arrived. They are so sweet and funny and smart. I spent a great deal of time discussing my relationship with Paul and they gave me better advice than I have gotten from most of the outlets that I have pursued. I left California feeling refreshed and ready to tackle my life in NYC. Yet, nothing could prepare me for the strong smell of piss that I encountered after exiting the airport. (Some things never change) So now I am back. I had dinner last night with the cast of Stupid Kids . Everyone, except for Ian, showed up. Meaning, see ya later Ian. Nice knowing you. Im actually not upset about it at all. I tried to be his friend and he just doesnt seem to care. It happens. I have other friends. Like 3. Please. I have at least 7. Anyhow, I spoke with Kelly at great lengths about the next project that the Theater Company is planning. I am very excited to continue with them over the next couple of months. Details will surely follow. Now, I have to plan for Halloween, look into auditioning for something in the city, and clean out the hamsters cage. But other than that, I feel pretty good about being home and in my own bed. I will surely miss the life of San Francisco, but I will just keep the idea of visiting there again next year very fresh in my mind. Time to go take a huge dump. You understand. Peace!

 Wellity I am off to California! What am I? The luckiest kid on the planet? My uncles are flying me out to San Francisco for a week of gay FUN! See, my uncle is gay and his husband/wife is gay too and I love them both! I have never spent any time with them alone since I have come out of my stuffy closet, so this is my chance to show them who I am and to get some familial gay love. I know its going to be just great! I am a bit apprehensive about taking a plane by myself, but I think I am ready. I mean, if God wants me to crash and burn and not continue with my acting dreamsthen sobeit. But I am pretty sure that God has big plans for me, so I am just going to get on that flight and deal with it. Non-baby style. I have yet to pack. I have yet to even THINK about this trip. The whole time, I was like, "Wellsomeones going to Cali. this week, but surely its not me." Imagine my surprise when I woke up this morning and was like OMG! Its me! So tonight I go home and pack. I have already told all of my girls and boyfriend that I will call them as soon as I get there and well make plans for next week. I meanam I serious? Can I just go on vacation and not think about my normal life? Hells never. Halloween is coming and my trip to SF aint gone fuck up dat! Anysnoodle(What?Microsoft Word dont recognize that as a real word? Fuck YOU Microsoft word) I will DEFINITELY write in my journal while I am on the West Coast. So please, keep coming by and checking in on me. I will know by my sitemeter tally if you care or dont care. I will KNOW! Sorrytoo much wine on my lunch break. Have a GREAT week everyone! The next time I write in here, I will be hanging out in the Castro district with my fellow gays and shooting the shit with the two coolest homos this side ofwellthis side of! Peace out yall!

 Pretty good, but pretty snorific weekend. I did see Texas Chainsaw Massacre and loved it. Soooo gruesome and I thought that Jessica Biel was amazing. She cried so many real tears that her performance was utterly inspiring to me. And I must say that every time I heard that chainsaw start up, chills ran up and down my spine. Maybe the best part of the whole experience though, was the fact that the theater was crowded with people. Every time someone got brutally slashed, everyone screamed their heads off. It was hilarious and made the experience that much more worth it. I also hung out with my friend Hannah on Saturday. She made us homemade chicken wings and we each downed a 6 pack of beer. It was terribly fun, but by the time I got home Saturday, I was exhausted. I decided to avoid alcohol for the rest of the weekend. Probably a good idea. My bowels were very grateful. I leave on Wednesday to go to San Francisco for the week. I couldnt be more elated. My job sucks so hardcore that being able to get away is like the most wonderful thing on the planet. I will not miss it in NYC for even a second. When I was walking to the subway this morning, I thought One more time to do this before I go away on a fantastic trip to a place thats WARM! Its so cold here in the city these days. And I cant find my winter jacket. Grrrr. While in SF, my uncles are going to take me to see urlLink BEACH BLANKET BABYLON ! It is supposed to be the most amazing show ever. It started as a very small theater production over 30 years ago and due to popular demand, it has become a staple as a San Francisco Must see. On Friday night my uncles are taking me out to the gay bars. I am most excited about that I think. I want to see what gay people look like in SF. I picture them with really muscular bodies and handlebar mustaches. I am going to jump on one of their Harleys and take off for a midnight ride. You understand. Theyve offered to take me wherever I want to go, but I told them that all I really want to do while I am there is drink tons of vodka tonics. They loved that idea. I am SO going to party it up. And eat lots of good food and sleep and rest and ride in a car and not have to wear a jacket outside and go in their hot tub every five minutes and meet their gay friends and play tons of card games and and and and, man, I cant wait. Off to get my hair cut for the big trip. Unfortunately, I have so much pomade in my hair today that the stylist is totally going to yell at me the minute I sit in her chair. I am going to tell her to go fuck herself up the twat and then leave. Its going to be great. I just know it. Happy Monday!

 Whoa. Drank way too much last night and puked the second I ate my first cheeseburger from McDonalds. Cant believe that I actually made it into work today. Gonna go home and lay my head down before I have to do it all over again tonight. Heh. Ouch. My stomach holds the fire of a thousand vodka tonics. My bowels hold the weight of everything that is ugly and scary about the world. Help me help myself.

 Welcome to a new friend! urlLink Booby Trapped ! Just love that title. Cuz of boobies. Obviously.

 Today, I was sitting on a park bench, reading my book and smoking a cigarette, when the most horrible thing happened. I took the last few drags from my smoke and then tossed the butt on the ground. Within seconds a pigeon ran over and scooped it up into his beak. A couple of moments later, the pigeon freaked out and spit it out onto the ground. Then, I SWEAR he looked at me in the eye with hatred and flew off. It was bizarre and I felt terrible. And then I laughed and laughed. Yeah, its MY fault you ate that butt. My fault. Myyyy fault. Ok enough. I had pizza for lunch and now my belly bubbles with anger. Yeah, its MY fault that my belly is bubbling with anger. MY fault. Ok enough. Last night I went home and surprised hamster Jim and hamster Kim with some fun new toys for their cage. Since they currently live in an aquarium, I was able to buy a new top with maze-like tubes sticking out of it. Now they can leave the cage and run around the tubes for awhile. Its great and amusing and they seem to really love it. I also bought them some fun new treats and some new yarn-like bedding. Of course Kimberly has stolen all the new bedding and put it on her side of the cage. Poor Jim sits, frozen, in the corner of the cage, naked. That selfish Kimberlyshes such a cunt. I am busy making my Christmas Wish List for my mother. She has been on my ass about getting it to her as quickly as possible. She likes to shop for months before Christmas. I think it takes her mind off of the bad things going on in her life. This time aroundmy brother not being able to be with us during any of the holidays. When I asked my mom what we were going to do for Christmas this year in order to make it specialshe said Your father and I were thinking about taking you all out to dinner and then to a movie. Thanks momthe typical Jewish Christmas. The ARMY offered my brother a two-week leave package since he is going to be in Baghdad for over a year. Instead of taking the leave time, my brother gave it up to one of the men in his unit. According to my bro, the guy he gave it to just had a baby and was unable to be there for the birth. When this story got back to me, I was so proud of my brother that I literally burst into tears. My mom cried too, but her response was How could he DO that? Doesnt he know how badly I miss him? Babies dont have the recognition of whether they see their father or not?!!? Ok, maybe she didnt go that far, but she was puh-retty upset. We are all proud of Winfield, but it totally sucks being on the other end of all of this. We miss him so badly. Sometimes I sit around and fantasize about the day he will come home. I think about what my face will look like when I see him walk off the plane, or if I will cry or not. Often I picture myself running up to him and tackling him to the ground, pinning his skinny, Iraqi weakened body to the floor. What will we have for dinner the first night he is home? Will he look as different as he must feel? War changes people and I wonder what kind of change will have taken its hold on Winfield. Will he have nightmares? Will he cry alot? Will he still want to get out of the ARMY? I spend every day living as though I am an only child. I talk to my parents every day; I go about my normal activities. It is only when he calls or I get a letter that I am truly reminded of the fact that one of the people I love most in this world is half way across the planet. Maybe its wrong that I dont carry him in my mind wherever I go. Or maybe its justified. Either way, there is no right answer. And either way, I have to get through this whole ordeal somehow. It sucks that he has missed my birthdays for years, or that he wasnt able to even get a glimpse at the first show I did in NYC. It is heartbreaking that even when he has completed his time in Baghdad, he will move back to Germany and not to the states. Part of me will always be angry with him for this. Part of me despises the fact that he chose this path. But most of me worries that he wont come back alive and that I will be stuck living the rest of my life with a memory of my brother at 24 years old. Its not fair and I am just about so sick of this whole fucking thing that I could fly out to Iraq myself and drag him home by the scruff of his neck. But until then, I will continue to pray and trust in Gods divine mercy. I will also continue to throw cigarette butts onto the ground and hope that every pigeon in the city will eat them up. I meanfuck. I gotta take out my aggression on SOMETHING.

 Welcome to a new friend! urlLink C'mon Really It's Me Whatcha Expect

 Okaythis poem is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO lame as I didnt have much time to do it. But I hope you all feel a bit special because of it. I just love you all so much. The Strangers That Became My Friends There was a time when I was lonely starved For friends, for love, for support. Words were scrambled in my brain, Fumbling, falling inside the depth of my person. Then there was Rita, the one who saved my thoughts from destruction. Her intelligence and creativity guided me through The process, the chance to formulate my internal struggle. I met Blogger and began to compose My new persona, my opportunity to turn my life Into something more interesting. Joe CuttheShit was born. The long, introspective trip began. Along the way, Joe has been blessed by many, Those looking to offer support, encouragement, love. Shocked and in awe of the power of words, Joe moved forward deeply touched and affected. Altered for the better. The characters he has met along the way - There is urlLink Indigo : So little and cute and sentimentally sweet, Calm and collected and truthfully adorned There was Bonaroo and London and stories Of the past. Moments that have made him The stud he is today. There is urlLink Wendy : The most beautiful creature on the planet, Delicate, spontaneous, bursting with life, Filled with sincerity and kindness and moments Of insanity, moments that change her into a smarter, More fulfilled human being. There is urlLink Lux : The girl I never knew, but always knew. We share so much in common that starting our First stage of love has been easy, based on trust. The future is bright and surely holds much for Lux. There is urlLink Julia : The woman that makes me laugh, makes Me smile. Makes me happy. Makes me relieved That I started this journal. If it werent for her and Chesa, I would be dead inside. There is urlLink Drowning Fish : The most captivating and honest journaler I know. Her stories move me to laughter and tears. There is Simplicity to her truth. There is honesty behind her every Emotion. She is an inspiration. And then there is urlLink Rose : A Pagan, a daughter of craziness, and one of the Most powerful people to ever sit at a computer. She is compelling, bold, and full of challenge. She Is the one you want on your side. She is the one you want Next to you in the time of battle. The pride and love I have for these six people Cause me to burst with happiness and joy. They have made me who I am. They have instilled strength and courage When it once was lost. And for all of this, I am grateful.

 Hi. So I just got back from lunch. I spent my hour reading a book that my dear friend Rita gave me, entitled Running With Scissors . So far so good. At first I was like This book is base and lame. But then I got to page 8 and it was much better. I am so impatient sometimes its ridiculous. My name is Joe. AnyhowI hung with Paul last night and we had a GREAT evening together. We had a nice dinner and watched the movie Very Bad Things , one of my absolute favorites. We laughed and laughed together all night long and when we went to bed, I pulled a huge practical joke on him. (I cant believe I am going to write about this now) As we were in our spooning position, ready for bed, I decided to rub my asshole on his leg. I was tickling him in the process so he didnt realize that my butthole was suctioned to his leg. About 5 minutes later, Paul says I smell poop. I reply: Maybe you farted. Paul: I didnt fart and it still smells like poop. Me: You did fart. I heard you. Paul: Joe, I did not fart. I should know if I farted. I tell him to go to bed and we curl up again and I suction my asshole to his leg again. Paul: Joe, it REALLY smells like poop. Me: (unable to contain my laughter anymore) HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Paul: You didnt. Me: I DID! You poop smelling, motha fucka. Paul: SICK! Joeyou dont rub assholes on boyfriends. Me: Ohsee I thought that was what boyfriends were SUPPOSED to do. Paul: You are disgusting and now I have to go wash my leg. Me: Snorego to bed. And thats what he did. He went to bed. I woke up this morning and could smell nothing. So snorseville Paul. There was never poop on your leg. Or was there I have to piss. Annoying. Lets play a game If you can answer these three questions about my life, I will write a poem about you. You may submit answers via email or via my comments: Here we go: 1) What is the one thing about men that turns me on the most? 2) My brother is currently living where? 3) The name of my character in the play I just completed is (Ariyou are not allowed to play. Ritaneither are you. Kellyno dice. You three know way too much already, its scary. ((of course you know the most Reets)) Alrighty Time to go rub my asshole on anyone who will let me. Peace.

 The show has officially come to a close. Yesterday morning when I woke up, I immediately began to feel depressed. It took me hours to drag myself out of bed and once I finally did, I spent most of the day sporadically crying. Not only was I upset that the show was over, I was upset that I wouldnt be seeing Ian and Sarah (two of the other people in the show) every day. And above all of this, I was most upset that I had to say goodbye to my character, Neechee. It is quite difficult to spend 3 months pretending that you are someone else, knowing that eventually you will have to just stop and never be that person again. At 26 years old, I find it very hard to believe that I will be playing this 17-year old character again in the future. I think I could be getting a bit too old for that. It was a very emotional evening for all of us. The show was a complete success and the audiences seemed to be really affected by both the plays content and the performances we gave. All of my friends from college came on Saturday night and for me, that was the best performance I did. The tears flew out of my face easily and I felt completely focused the entire time. Afterwards, they popped open a bottle of champagne for us and then we hit some local Manhattan bars and ended up partying at their hotel for awhile. It was an amazing night. One of the absolute best. As we said goodbye and got into the elevator, I started to cry. I miss my Rita so much that seeing her for such a short time really broke my heart. I wanted her to stay forever. Now that the show is over, I am pretty excited to have some time to myself. It will be great to get some real rest and relaxation as well as be able to go out with my friends and party it up! For instance, this Thursday, I am going out with 8 fellow gay men for an event that has been dubbed Gay Sex out in the City. I only know three of the guys that are going to be there, but I am SO excited to be able to get together with a group of gays for a night out at the bars. YAY! I am SO going to fuck all of them in the ass. Ok, sike. They are so going to fuck me in the ass. Ok, sick. Anyhoodle, Paul took such good care of me yesterday. I called him around 4pm yesterday very upset and he immediately calmed me down and made me feel better. He was going to bring two friends of his to the show, but I asked him to come alone cuz I really wanted to spend the evening with just him. As we were leaving, a few tears escaped my eyes and Paul put his arm around me (in the middle of Brooklyn!) and walked me to the subway. We got back to his apartment, smoked a bowl, and then he took me out to a wonderful dinner. It was exactly the way I wanted to spend the evening. Sometimes Paul really does come through for me. Let it not go unnoticed. Tonight we are planning on going to dinner again and then cuddling and watching TV. I am SO excited to have the night off and to be able to spend it with him. We are going to watch The Simpsons together and just enjoy being in each others presence. Just like the olden days. You know, the days when everything was covered in Sepia. You understand. Some tidbits about this weekend: On Friday night, in the middle of a performance, I went backstage to get ready for my next scene. While there I realized that the gun I have to pull at the end of the play wasnt in its appropriate spot. I immediately start to panic and look at Kelly and go: THE GUN IS MISSING! THE FUCKING GUN IS MISSING! She was so calm and was like I will find it. Just focus and dont worry about it. In turn, I responded BUT THE FUCKING GUN! HOW COULD I BE SO STUPID TO NOT CHECK ON IT?! I CANT DO THE SHOW WITHOUT KNOWING WHERE THE GUN IS!?!?!?! I forced myself to shut up and after the next scene, she found it and took my heart out of my throat and put it back into my chest. Last night, the video camera that we use for the live feed, fell down and crashed right at the end of the performance. Kelly and I didnt even wince. We just continued with our dialogue. Also, every person who drank a beer during the performance managed to drop it 103 times during the show. It was like performing for a bunch of wasted Frat. guys. Also on Friday, Megan, the director, was holding on to Kellys cell phone during the show and wouldnt you know it? IT RANG IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR PERFORMANCE. Ironically enough, the caller was a guy that was in the companys last show. On the message he said: I think you are in the middle of a performance. I hope you remembered to turn off the ringer. HAHAHAHAHAHA. No. Kelly did not remember. The financial investor never showed up. Nor did he call. Bastid. BUT, the parents of the playwright came and it was such an unforgettable experience meeting them and being in their presence. They fully enjoyed the show and had some powerful things to say to me after it was over. I hugged them a couple of times and felt completely fulfilled. Things with Ian and I ended on a high note. He and I have plans to hang out at the end of the week or early next week. I am going to miss him very much. Although a bit difficult to work with, he has taught me a great deal about myself. This experience wouldnt have been the same if he and I didnt form the bond that we did. I feel so blessed by all of this. The show went well, everyone I know came out to support me, and I fully believe that all those in attendance were moved by my performance. Now. On to bigger and better. God willing.

 YAHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! The show went incredibly well last night. We had a full audience, we were able to ride through any random mistakes and there were tears shed by numerous people at the end of the performance. I could not have asked for a more wonderful start to a long run. God is so good to me. He truly does reward hard work. My only hope is that he will stand by me throughout the rest of the performances. I am sure he will. :) So. The one thing that did not make me happy was the way Ian acted before and after the show. He barely spoke a word to anyone in the cast and as he did last Saturday, left immediately after the performance. He didn't even stay around to tell me that it was a good show. I don't understand what is wrong with him, but it hurts. I have spent so much time trying to get to know him and to support him, yet he has completely pulled away from me. It's like he wants nothing to do with me anymore. Maybe he has some shit going on in his personal life or maybe this is how he deals with a show ending and I can accept any or all of that. I just wish he would clue me in to what's going on in his head. Part of me thinks he is unhappy with the way my performance is being received by the audiences. I get a lot of support from the people who attend and I think he may feel a little left out. But truthfully, most of the people that have come to see the show are people I know and got tickets for. If he had spent more time getting people in the seats, maybe he wouldn't feel so overlooked at the end. I work really hard to give the performance I give and part of me thinks that his jealousy is getting in the way of us being friends. Maybe I'm completely off base? I hope so. Cuz if this is how he feels, I don't know that we will ever be able to talk again once this experience has come to a close. It's just a sad, sad thing. As for the other shit going on in my life? My hamsters, Jim and Kimberly, are becoming so scarily attached to me. When I get home at night and turn on my bedroom light, they immediately come running from their beds and try to climb out of the cage. I take the top off and they (Jim especially) crawls right into my hand and runs up to my neck to snuggle in. They are totally in love with me now and it makes me want to have them as my babies forever. They are so fucking adorable I can't stand it. Things with Paul and I are going smoothly although I'm still not convinced we are going to be able to work through our many issues. Some things just never change. Some days I love him and some days I hate him. It's not healthy, but it's the way things are. And the way things are going to stay for awhile longer. I'm just not ready to say goodbye to him yet. I don't know if I will ever be ready. My mom came to the show again last night. She is so adorable and supportive. I miss her so much. She is my favorite person in the world and I am so blessed to have someone like her as my mother. She is coming AGAIN on Saturday with my dad and some other people we know from way back. Gosh, my parents. A kid couldn't be any luckier than me. Okay! The next time I write in here, I will be done with Stupid Kids . I can't believe it's almost over. How depressing. Now what am I going to do with myself?

 Another Openin, Another Show. Another Openin, Another Show YAY! Its that time again. Time to go put a gun in my mouth and bring everyone to tearshopefully. Oh, does that sound weird to you? Well, to most people it would. But to meevery time we do a show, I know going into it that I need to attempt suicide at the end of every performance and bring myself to hysterical tears. It takes a lot out of me, if you can imagine. When we first started rehearsing, I would put the gun in my mouth and scream my way through the entire scene. Since then, I have been working extremely hard on taking each moment as it comes. Some nights, all I do is scream and yell, and some nights, I become a blubbering mess on stage. But on all nights, I sort of wish that I was playing a different character. A character that gets to stand by and watch the events transpire instead of having to be the one that forces them towelltranspire. Its a lot of pressure to put a gun in your mouth on stage. If it comes off looking fake or hokey, the whole thing is for shit and people leave thinking that the play was goodexcept for the guy at the end that was fake shooting himself with a gun. You understand. What I do now to prepare is put the whole thing out of my mind. According to my character, Neechee, there is no need for a gun-to-mouth experience. Neechee, although a bit filled with lunacy, is still a focused and together guy. But when Jim, my love interest, shits on me one too many times, thats it. I lose it. So, I spend the whole play pining and pining for his acceptancehis love. He uses me and abuses me and by the end, if I believe in everything that has occurred between us during the show, I am ready to either blow his head offor blow off my own. Its a beautiful thing really. And lucky for me, the audiences last weekend fully believed me. Lets hope for the same during this 4-day run. The only real downfall to playing a character such as Neechee is that at the end of the show, all I want to do is crawl inside a box and cry my eyes out. I have to get myself so worked up in order to go psycho at the end and just because the lights have gone down and the curtain call is coming, it doesnt mean that I can just turn off the sadness and anger that is coursing through my veins. What usually happens is that I finish the last scene, go to my spot for the bows, cry a bit more, chug a beer, and slap a shit-eating grin on my face. Once the lights have gone down completely, I go into a corner, change into my normal clothes, cry the rest of the tears out, if need be, and force myself to go shmooze with the people I know in the audience. Its a very bizarre experience and hard for people who arent actors to understand what its like. Most of the times, non-actors tell me how lucky I am to have an outlet for my underlying emotions. If I were an actor that had to cry on stage, I would love it, cuz I would be able to get out all of the emotions that plague me during the day. But its not like that. Its more likebringing up all of the stuff that hurts you and then once you are finally releasing all of the pent up emotion, you have to turn it off immediately and move on. Its not at all a healing process. But if it works and the audience cries with me, then it is surely a fulfilling experience. So, as I prepare to take the stage again tonight, these are the thoughts that run crazy-like through my head. I want to give an honest performance. I want people to listen to me and to follow my character. And most importantly, I want people to identify with Neechee and truly feel it when he is happy or when he is sad. Thus affecting the audience member in a powerful and moving way. I am so blessed to be able to play a part that has such range. It gives me a chance to really showcase my talent and to teach people something about homosexuality that they may not have previously thought about in the past. Thank you God for this opportunity.

 3 more days until I see my ladies from college! They are hastily making plans to come down to see Kellys and my show this weekend. I talked to Rita for awhile today and her excitement got me all nervous and pumped! Not only is she coming with my friends from school, but also with her sister Jeannie, who I havent seen in almost a year! What a thrill this weekend is going to be. The thing is Part of me is really depressed about the show coming to a head this weekend. Saturdays performance will be quite the thrill, but then Sunday comes and the show is over. I forgot how upsetting it is to finish up a show and say goodbye to everyone involved. Remember when I was in love with Ian for like 10 minutes? Well, after Sunday, I pretty much doubt we will stay in touch. I mean, things are going very well between us and we have gotten much closer as the show has progressed. But Ian and I have different lives and I am sure our connection will die with the closing of the show. Thats ok. I would prefer that we stayed in touch, but Im bad with that and I know he will be too. I have decided to direct a show with this company as soon as Stupid Kids comes to a close. I havent picked the play that I want to direct yet, but I will need to do that soon. I have one week off after the show and then I leave to go to California for a weekso time is of the utmost! As soon as I return from Cali., I am going to have to begin rehearsals immediately. We will only have 6 weeks to put the next show together and while the task seems pretty dauntingI am ready for the challenge. FUN. So, despite what certain people have to say about my starting my career at the age of 26, I am pretty stoked to have two different commercial agents in the audience this coming Saturday night. Cuz I meanwhat if? What if they see me and are like We want to represent you and take you away from your miserable existence as an Admin. Assistant! What a dream come true that would be. Most likely, they will come see the show, gush to me about what a wonderful job I did, and then high tail it out of there as though they have never met me in their life. Either way, its fine. The only person I trust to guide my career is God. All of this is in his hands, really. I made the decision to dedicate my life to this dream based on his guidance and it will only be through him that I succeed. I will keep my eyes pointed upwards and my patience level intact. Until thencan I fax something for you? I am wiped out today. I am definitely going to have to take a quick nap during my lunch break if I ever plan on getting through my touch-up rehearsal tonight. I feel like the walking dead. My brain is all mushylike rotted potatoes. Or squash. Or pudding. Or swing sets. You understand. Here are a few artists that I love these days: TLC Nine Inch Nails The New American Standard Kelly Rowlands OutKast Beyonce Dave Matthews Band (Welcome back brother manyoure new disc is JOOD! Finally!) Christina Aguillera (Two Lsone for each labia) Here are a few artists that I am embarrassed to love these days: Hillary Duff Simple Plan Lillix Here are a few artists that I cant stand(!) these days: Ashanti Sean Paul (Just gimme the lie din don dih bo oh oh.) Sugar Ray Avril LaSnores Here are a few artists that I want to shit on these days: Britney Spears Madonna Pink Kid Rock Sheryl Crow Wellthats about it for today. ENJOY YOUR WEDNESDAY CUZ TOMORROW IS THURSDAY! YIPEE KAY YAI YAY MOTHA FUCKA!

 HO YEAH! The opening weekend of the show is over and I have to say that it could not have turned out any better. All of the months of rehearsing and stressing has truly paid off. The show was received wonderfully and I think that everyone who attended walked away touched by both the content of the play and the performances given by the actors. urlLink Ari was in the audience on Friday night, along with two of her fellow blogging friends. Everyone was so supportive after the show and it made me feel so good to know that I had them there for me. On Saturday night my parents came and my boss from work and a bunch of other people from my life and it was a slamming good show as well. I was walking on clouds until I woke up this morning and realized that I had to come back to my daily 9am-5pm hum drum of a life. The friend of the playwright, David, came on Friday and he had some wonderful things to say to me. He told me that John Russell, the playwright, wrote my character based on his own perspective on life and that he would have been beaming with pride to see the work that I had done. He said that my performance was powerful and emotional and honest. He said that I made him cry. When he was talking to me about the similarities between my character and Johns life, I began to cry as well and we ended up having a very meaningful hug after all was said and done. At the end of our conversation, David asked me if I had any representation. I explained to him that I sent out over 50 headshots and resumes, but that I never heard back from a single agent. He told me that after the show he wants to sit down and have dinner with me so that he can help me out in whatever way he can. The smile on my face was huge and I told him that I would contact him as soon as our run was complete. This weekend was one of the best theater experiences I have ever had in my life. Both shows were successful and the audience raved about the final product. When I saw my parents after the show on Saturday, my mom was in hysterical tears. She said: I had no idea that the show was going to be as moving as it was. Your character ripped my heart out at the end and I still feel as though I cant get myself under control. Both she and my dad went on and on about the performance and as I put them in the car and sent them home, they both hugged me and told me how proud they are of me. It was a beautiful moment that I wont forget for the rest of life. I feel elated with how well everything went. The audiences really seemed to enjoy the production and more importantly, I think they felt affected by the body of work. I cant imagine anything that could have gone any better. I am a real life actor again and it feels SO good! Now I have one more night off before I have to jump into 5 more days of complete craziness. Tomorrow is a brush up rehearsal and then we have 4 evenings of performances in a row. My best friends from school are coming on Saturday, including the love of my life, Miss Rita! They are all staying in the city after the show, so I will be able to hug them and love them all night long. Last weekend was a great opening and preparation for what is coming up. I have to make sure to get as much rest and relaxation in now as I can. I dont think there will be any of that before next Monday hits. I wish I could make a career out of acting. Its all I have ever wanted. Some day. Some day soon.

 Well! Tonight is the night. After months of preparation, it all comes down to this evening. It is the opening night of Stupid Kids and I couldnt be more pumped about it. Last nights preview went very well. We received a wonderful response from the people who were there and even a few tears were shed. It was excellent. As a crazy actor, I still believe that there is more that I can do with my performance and my focus during the run can be a bit better. I have to remember to use the dialogue to my advantage and to try my hardest to stay in the moment. Live on impulse! urlLink Ari is coming to the show tonight as well as some great friends of mine from college and high school. I am performing solely for them. Well, and also for the dead playwrights best friend and ex-therapist who are coming as well! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! I so hope they like the show. Thank you to all of you for your undying love and support. I feel so blessed to have this online community in my life. You all make me feel so confident and secure in my ability. And a special thank you to urlLink Amaryllis , who sent me the most beautiful virtual bouquet I have ever seen. What an incredibly sweet thing to do. BREAK A LEG --- GOOD SHOW --- FUCK YEAH! The time is now. And I am ready.

 HORK! OMG! Tonight is the preview of our show! We have 5-10 people coming to check it out and give us their thoughts. AY YI YI! Tomorrow is opening night and I am terrified, excited, and totally ready for it. BRING IT ON BABY! BRING IT ON! This journal will return back to normal after this weekend. I promise. Right now, I have no time. I LOVE YOU ALL!

 HAPPY THANKSGIVING! Well, almost Happy Thanksgiving. One day to go! I woke up really excited about the holiday. When life gives you lemons, you have to make Country Time or some shit. Right? Today is my brothers birthday. Whenever it crosses my mind, I get a twinge of sadness that eats away at my insides. I hope that his fellow soldiers are doing something nice for him today. I am big on birthdays and it kills me to know that my brother has to spend his in Baghdad. Then tomorrow he has to spend Thanksgiving eating under a tent with his fellow ARMY brothers. It will be a horrible couple of days for him, but he will get through it and so will we. I told my mom that I am going to arrive at home in a good mood, with a positive attitude. It is up to me to make sure that we all laugh a lot and enjoy the time together. I will do my best. Tonight we are going to party it up at the urlLink Albany Gay Bars . I always look forward to going out gay in Albany. I get to walk in and act all NYC-ish. Plus, I am fresh meat to them, so the guys tend to dote on me a bit. Heh heh. Always feels good to be doted on. Then on Friday night we will go out and do it all over again. Saturday, my parents are driving Kelly and I back to the city. That night my parents are taking me to see the urlLink Christmas Spectacular show at Radio City Music Hall. This is our third year attending and each time it is such a thrill. Its definitely the way to start the Christmas season. Very much looking forward to it. So you see? Although the holidays are not nearly as wonderful with my brother being gone, there are still events to look forward to. I just have to remind my parents of that by being the best son I can be. What do you eat for your Thanksgiving dinner? Our menu consists of: Turkey (obviously) Mashed Potatoes (yem!) Peas (sorta yem!) Broccoli and Cheese (my personal favorite) Yams (sick) Coleslaw (sickest) Rolls (slurp) Pies usually blueberry and chocolate Ambrosia (weird marshmallow dessert-esque food, but its actually pretty good) There may be a few other things thrown in there, but I really only care about the turkey, potatoes, and broccoli. You understand. Every Thanksgiving, my mom and I always watch urlLink Planes, Trains, and Automobiles together (the quintessential Thanksgiving movie). When I spoke to my mom earlier today, she said, Are you bringing home any of the good stuff? By good stuff, she means Mary Jana. Hahahaha. I say Yes mam! And we will be sure to toke some buds together! My mom replies Toke em thuds? I laughed and said, Yes, toke em thuds! You love that! She couldnt BE any more adorable. I feel so grateful for so many things. Among the list are: My family especially brother, granny, and uncles! My boyfriend Paul My friends especially you Rita Lovely! My job Theatre Our US Troops My hamsters Jim and Kim NYC Pizza and French Fries urlLink The Real World/Road Rules Gauntlet My dashing good looks ha! My health and the health of those I love. And most of allI am grateful to God for giving me all of this. Thank you to Jesus for dying on the cross for our sins. And thank you to those who work so hard at bringing God into other peoples lives. Happy Thanksgiving to all of you lovelies. Make the best of it and eat your face off! I lovel u.

 Today I am exhausted. I dont know what it is. I did nothing last night, but shove my face with food and hang with my boyfriend. Yet, I walk around in pure zombie form this afternoon as though I was out all night partying it up with Paris Hilton and Nicole Ritchie. You understand. I made the dyer mistake of eating two slices of pizza for lunch. I dont know if its the cold weather or because Thanksgiving is around the corner or whatbut I am starving. Always starving. Always ready to cook up a quick ham and shove it down my gullet. Probably follow it with a 32oz glass of gravy. And maybe a spoonful of peas. Sike. Like I even like gravy. That shit is so nasty. Cept on french fries sometimes. That can be good. For some reason my house phone is disconnected. I think the wind knocked the line dead or something. Either that or a killer is plotting my grisly death. Eh. This has been the longest week of my life. I am not really looking forward to going home, although I know it will be enjoyable once I get there. Of course I want to see and spend time with my parents. Of course I want to go out to the gay bars in Albany. Of course I want to play with my parents little pup. And of course it will be so nice to be out of NYC and in the clean, fresh smelling air of Albany, NY. Its really beautiful up there. When I was home a couple of weeks ago, I marveled at how gorgeous Albany really is. Its so simple and calm. The anxiety just runs out of my bones and I settle in to life there so quickly. The only downside is that I am allergic to my old cat. So by Friday morning, my eyes will be swollen and I will be breathing through my dickhead. Theres no way to avoid it. Just have to deal with it. I do love my shower at home though. So much water cascading over my pizza-laden thighs. I may even take a bath. I havent done that since like early 2000. I could use one. Calgon take me away or some shit. Only two more hours to get through before I can go back to my apartment. Gotta pack and clean the hamster cage and do a conference call with the Theatre Company. After that, to bed I said.

 Updates The weekend was great! I am FINALLY feeling better. I woke up this morning and was actually in a good mood. Who would have thought that could happen on a Monday? I still have a residual cough, but my aches and pains are gone and I dont feel nearly as cranky as I have felt for the last two weeks. Just in time for urlLink Ari to catch it. She is home now and doing her best to keep her sanity. Poor thing. The fundraiser was a major success. We didnt raise as much money as we had hoped, but we did fairly well. Everyone that came had a blast. The entire space was turned into this raging cool dance club. The music was tight and the decorations were fucking phenomenal. I met a slew of people and drank half the keg myself. (I forgot how TASTY keg beer really is) I am very pleased with the way it turned out. And I also have the best friends in the world. Almost everyone I know in the city came down to support. My brothers best friend in Iraq, Lou, was in a horrible accident this weekend. From what I have been told, Lou, was on a mission when a wall crumbled and fell on top of him. Both of his legs and pelvic area was smashed in the accident. He was flown to Germany where they are currently trying to put his lower body region back together. It was a horrible, horrible thing, and my brother is on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Not only is he upset that Lou got so hurt, but also that he doesnt have him in Iraq with him anymore. They didnt get to see each other very often, but it gave him piece of mind to know that he was right around the corner. Winfield called my parents in tears yesterday. Only the second time he has cried since he has been there. My dad called me in tears this morning to relay the news. Ugh. And Thanksgiving is in 3 days. In other newsKelly told me the funniest story on Friday. She was babysitting for this 2-year-old boy. While he was sitting with her, she signed online and a picture of Michael Jackson came up on the screen. Gus, the baby, looked at Kelly, looked at the picture of Michael and said That lady looks like you! End story. Busy week ahead of me. Paul and I are going to go to dinner at urlLink Rocco's tonight. You may remember that place from the NBC show The Restaurant. I cant wait to try Mamas Meatballs. YEM! Off to lunch now. Gotta clear my head for a bit.

 I have seen the face of death and I have shit right on it. I am finally back at work. Much to my dismay, I have spent the last 72 hours in bed - alone, sick, and miserable. Sometimes its nice to have a day or two off. Sometimes it SUCKS. This time, in particular, I hated it. The flu is an ugly disease that, in the past, I have been lucky enough to avoid. Looking back on my history of illnesses, I cant remember actually getting the flu . I have had bad colds and the like, but never an actual case of the influenza. I still feel weak and cranky and have no appetite to speak of. My cough still scares small children and my breathwellPaul has no eyebrows left on his face due to my breathing on him all night. Tonight is our big November Fundraiser for the Theatre Company. Thank God that I feel somewhat okay. There is a lot of work to be done and I have just enough energy left to do it. We hope to raise upwards of $1,000 tonight. I dont see any reason why we wont. We have 4 DJs rotating music until all hours of the night and many have RSVPd. I dont plan on staying there any later than 12am, but you never know. Sometimes beer helps one to feel better when they have the flu. (snicker snicks) Thanks for all of the great advice everyone gave me. I do have a new toothbrush and I am constantly washing my hands. I am drinking lots of liquids and I am eating the healthiest of healthy foods. I have never wanted to beat a sickness so badly in my life. Stay healthy yall. The flu makes no exceptions. Except for bodybuilders. Who DOESNT make exceptions for bodybuilders?

 Well, it's official. I have influenza. Or something equally as ugly. I am leaving work now to go home and die in a corner. Love me. But don't get too close or you may be loving me out your ass for the next two weeks. Over and out.

 Back from my weekend with the parents. It was an exceptionally good visit this time around. No tears were shed and although we did talk a lot about Winfield, most of it was positive. I am much relieved that there were no emotional outbursts. I really needed this weekend to clear my head. And that I did. Now Ive got my nose back to the grindstone. This Friday is our November Fundraiser for the Theatre Company. I am nervous as to what the attendance will be. Considering that we need a lot of people to come in order to raise money for Decembers rent, our fingers, toes, and tits are crossed. The fundraiser is essentially a Record Release Party for the guy who did the sound for Stupid Kids . He will be debuting his new album and we are fortunate enough to keep all of the profits for the company. It is really hard to anticipate the level of attendance since most of our patrons will come because of him. I was incredibly stressed about it this weekend, but now I have calmed down. At this point, there is no need to worry. If its a flop, its a flop. I have too much going on to worry about it anymore. Worst case scenarioI drink a keg by myself and stumble home. Okayhow bout BEST case scenario, I drink a keg by myself and stumble home. I just spilled the toner for the copy machine all over myself and the entire supply room floor. As soon as it happened, I started screaming SHIT! SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT!. The students ran away in fear. When I looked at my jeans, I saw that they were COVERED in black shit. I just got the jeans Im wearing, two weeks ago. However, with patience and understanding, I was able to get rid of the black powder from my right pant leg without so much as a spot. (Thank the Lord in heaven above. Cuz I certainly dont have enough money to go out and buy a new pair of jeans) Now, our housekeeper is scrubbing the supply room floor to rid it of the huge mess I caused. I told her that I would clean it myself, but she just let out an egg fart and refused to let me help. I havent spent any time with Paul over the last week. In fact, I havent seen him since LAST Monday when we hung out. Because of this, tonight he is taking me out for the night. We are either staying in a hotel or going to an expensive dinner. He wont tell me exactly what it is. But I am tre excited. We will not be partaking in any sex type adventures as my dick has some sort of rash on it. I used a very frilly type of lotion last week and my dick exploded in irritation. I am not happy about it, to say the least. In order to allow it time to heal, I have had to completely refrain from masturbating. But then, late last night, I tugged on my dick for 5 solid minutes. My insides were exploding with cum and I just had to release it. When I woke up this morning, my dick had become an innie instead of an outie. I now have an infected vagina. Looks like I wont be playing with myself until early December. I am now leaving to get my hair cut. As you know, I HATE getting my hair cut. But I love being pretty, so I must go. Latas lovahs!

 Its Friday and I am off to Albany for the weekend. Im going so that I can spend time with the moms and the dads. They are in dire need of some love. I know Thanksgiving is only two weeks away, but my parents are hella depressed these days. I am hoping that my visit will lift their spirits a bit. And mine. The other night Mariah took a couple of us to see Little Shop of Horrors on Broadway! It is like my favorite show of all time. The whole experience was wonderful. I have to admit that I was not a fan of the girl who played Audrey. I thought her performance was weak and that she made some pretty bad acting choices. Seymour had a couple of nice moments, but irritated me and the rest of the audience with his inexperienced physical comedy skills. Thinking back on it, it could be the direction that was way off and not the actors. Its hard to tell. Some of the show was brilliant and some of it was terrible. Bad direction should have led to the whole show falling on its face. But reallyI only found Audrey and Seymour to be the ones falling on their faces. Ah well. However, the show was not a total wash. Not in the least! The Doo-Wop girls were sensational and the dentist stole the show. I also thought that the set and the lighting was out of this world. To sum it up, I think Kelly hit the nail on the head when she turned to me and said: Thank God there is a talking plant in this musical. It is so much fun to go to the theatre and I always walk away with a deep aching to be on the stage. Oh how I wish I could have the chance to play the part of Seymour in this musical. Oh how I WISH! Last night I ate a whole bag of chewy sprees. I woke up with no teeth in my mouth. I had to gum my first cigarette of the day. I also tuned in to Friends for the first time in years. That Monica Gellermanshe puts me in stitches. Is it wrong that I want to grow up to be just like her? She is everything I want to be as a girl. Alrightyhave a great weekend everyone! Its time for me to go hug my mom and dad.

 Ever have one of those months where you are so stressed out that you feel as though you could burst into tears at any moment? Well, consider this my month. Since my trip to California, nothing in my life has been smooth. I have filled my evenings by becoming a full time active member of the Theatre Company. (more work than I could ever explain) My mundane and totally unsatisfying job is slamming me with project after project. I have recently found out that one of my co-workers is leaving us in December and all that does for me iscreate more work. On top of this, I have been struggling with the flu of death. I have had the shits, a fever, a horrible head cold, body aches, and borderline hallucinations. However the hallucinations may be a result of shitting out everything that lives inside my body. Paul and I are good, but I am having a hard time fitting him into my schedule. My friends are good, but who has time to make everyone happy? And as I mentioned previously, I am throwing a Murder Mystery Party. GOSH! Who am I KIDDING?!?! I think the reason all of this is getting to me today is: This is the first holiday season that I will spend without my brother. For my entire life, my parents, brother and grandmother have gotten together to celebrate the holidays. This year it will be just my parents, myself, and my grams. I am dreading the whole thing. If possible, I would choose to fast forward right to January. Bypass the whole thing and pretend as though it never happened. Its sad really. For us AND for Winfield. He will be sitting in a steaming hot building on Christmas, having dried out SPAM with his fellow soldiers. The whole idea of it is enough to make me start crying, from now until New Years. As strong as I have tried to be with my parents about my brothers absence, and as strong as I have tried to be for myself, there are days like today when I want to throw in the towel and lock myself in my bedroom for weeks. I just love him so much and I need him right now. Winfield has missed out on so much of my life and vice versa. He was unable to see my first show in NYC. He will be unable to see my next two shows, at least. There are few phone calls, few letters, and even fewer moments of honesty between us. How you holding up out there? Same as always. How you holding up in the city? Fine. Same as always. I miss you. I miss you too. And thats about it. Arent I supposed to be growing up with my brother still? I understand that we are both in our twenties and that it is natural for us to be in different places, doing different things. But its been this way since he went away to college. While I stayed within hours from home, Winfield went to school at Wake Forest, in North Carolina. While I graduated and moved to NYC (still within hours from home), Winfield moved to Germany to be in the ARMY. My brother and I didnt become close until the summer before I left for college. Since then we have only had summers and school breaks to be together. He tricked me into allowing him into my personal life. He tricked me into trusting and leaning on him. He tricked me because he moved away and did his own thing. But what about me? What about us? What about Christmas? Its days like today that make me feel as though there is nothing to look forward to. I am working my ass off every day and yet, at the end of it, I dont have Winfield here to share it with. I dont have his friendship. I have a phone call every 5 weeks that results in us making sure the other is okay. Well, I am not okay. I am sad and lonely and understand that it only gets worse from here on in. Come home already. God, I dont know. Its just hard

 I promise you a post tomorrow. Been impossibly busy. Thanks for your patience and homoerotic understanding! Peace.

 (Sheepish grin) Hi. Its me. Your old friend Joe. Where have I been? What have I been doing? Not much, but so much at the same time. Lets seequick recap: Halloween was kind of a bust. We ended up going to that house party and dying there. We were there for hours and went home afterwards. It was one of those nights where Paul got wasted and caused 137 problems. We actually had to pull him from the apartment, as he was about to get into a fistfight for calling a friend of ours a cunt. Yeah, I was really proud of him that night. Also, there was the guy that when introduced to Paul and I responded with Faggots! How you doing? Here is how the conversation actually happened. Mariah: John, I want you to meet my friends Paul and Joe. John: Faggots! How you doing? Joe: WHAAAAAAAAAA?!?! Paul: What the fuck did you just say? Mariah: Johns gay too, he didnt mean John: Chill out. Were all a bunch of faggots. Paul: You smell like shit. Did you just shit yourself? It smells like shit now. Joe: Oh God, here we go John: What are you talking about? Paul: YOU SMELL LIKE SHIT! Shit smelling John! At that point I walked away to let Paul and John finish their retorts. Mariah apologized profusely for Johns comments. All I could say was Who SAYS something like that? I was legitimately shocked. And that was Halloween. Since then I havent done much beside hang out with people I havent had the chance to see. Work has been a beastmaster and Ive been a little down without having a show to work on. That will change, but not soon enough. The Theatre Company has made the decision to throw an AIDS benefit in December. I will be performing a monologue and a scene at the cabaret portion of the event. On Tuesday I plan to sit down with the company and discuss my future role as an active member. I hope to get as involved as possible. In other news, I am throwing a urlLink Murder Mystery Party ! I have mailed out the invitations and am excited to be the host of this event. So far people seem really pumped about it. Now I just have to figure out what to serve for dinner! Ive become a raging huge fan of the new urlLink Real World/Road Rules Challenge - The Gauntlet . I have also become somewhat addicted to urlLink Rich Girls as well. Something is clearly wrong with the way I choose to live my life. I havent talked to my brother since mid-September. He has called twice and I missed him twice. His birthday is at the end of the month and Im starting to get those I cant deal with him being gone anymore feelings. Its making me hecka sad. I have asked Paul to spend Christmas with my family. Although his relationship with his own family pretty much resembles shit on toast, he still feels as though he should be at his parents house for the holiday. He is making a concerted effort to be a part of my Christmas though. The plan is that he will come for Christmas Eve and leave early Christmas morning to go see his family. It would mean the world to me if he were at my house for the holiday. It will make it slightly less lonely since Winfield will be gone. This weekend I plan to spend as little money as possible. Thats really my only goal. Im kinda broke right now and I need to start saving my money for Christmas presents! Or bags of pot for myself! Ora big fat steak that I can shove into my mouth right now. Im veddy hungwey. Have a great weekend and make sure to look both ways before diving into a vagina.

 Have a beautiful and healthy New Years Eve celebration! I am looking forward to starting a new year with all of you. Much love. Joe CuttheShit

 Christmas has come and gone. I couldnt be more relieved. This year the holidays have been extremely difficult for my family. I think we all just went through the motions of opening presents and engaging in past traditions because we felt like we had to. As much as I tried to keep my positive attitude, 4 days in Albany definitely stripped that out of me. My parents, as usual, went overboard with the presents and I walked away with (basically) a new entertainment system. Dvd Player, bigger television, Cd burner, Playstation 2, etc. I was overwhelmed and really excited. Other than that, this Christmas is one I would prefer to never revisit. New Years is this week and I must say that I am dreading that as well. Maybe its because I have had a horrible month, or maybe its because my life is need of some major changes, but either way, I hate everyone and everything right now. During the month of December, my friends have managed to turn my life upside down. I hate fighting with my friends and will usually try to do whatever I can to fix the situation so that we can all be a tight knit group again. But this time around, I feel like I have no group. The group has turned into something I dont like and worse, something I dont feel comfortable in. My closest friends in NYC are Angie, Kelly, and Mariah. In December I found out some secrets that they were keeping from me; secrets that were hurtful and did major damage to my trust in them. I thought that I would be able to get over it with time and that I would chalk this ugly situation up to a growing pain that a group of friends goes through. But it seems like as time goes by, I become increasingly more angry and upset. Its almost to the point where I feel as though I want to pull away from the group entirely and make all new friends. These feelings are all very new to me. I have had girl friends my whole life, but Ive never felt so hurt and betrayed by any of them as I do now. Ive never felt so lonely, so out of the loop, and so angry. I can honestly say that I have gone overboard in making sure that these three ladies were happy and comfortable and included in everything that I was lucky to be a part of. The problem here is that my close friends are all lesbians. They can go out to the bars with each other and have the time of their lives. Unfortunately for me, the lone gay man in our group, they are not nearly as interested in going out to the places that I would prefer. Its not that they WONT go out with me, cuz they will. But if I dont organize the outing, it wont happen. Yet, they dont need me to organize a lesbian night out. That they can do completely on their own. I cant seem to come up with a solution to the way I feel. I have had numerous talks with Kelly that I thought were really positive. Unfortunately, none of them has changed the way that I feel towards her right now. I dont like who she is dating (Pauls dud of a roommate Jen) and until I can either get over it or accept it, I dont see how I can be around her. At least, not around her at Pauls apartment. I dont like that she is there without me, yet I cant be there when shes there, cuz I just know I will lose my temper. I tend to be very guarded about places and relationships that I have claimed as my own. Its a very immature trait that I have, although it never usually comes to the surface. Now, with Kelly dating Jen, its on the surface of my skin every day and I find myself spending most of my free time angry and irritated. Dont get me wrongI love Kelly. She is one of my best friends and always will be, but until her and Jen break up, I dont want her at Pauls apartment. I just dont. Its selfish and close-minded of me and unfortunately, nothing she can say will change the way I feel. Kelly and I have had a rough month together A month that has left me wondering who she has become. It seemed to happen over night, but here it isthe new Kelly. And sadly, its a Kelly that I feel has hurt me very deeply. I am almost nervous to talk to her everyday, for fear that she is going to throw yet another curb ball in my direction that is going to push me over the deep end once and for all. But, if you cant talk about something and fix it, how do you move forward? This is not the way to have a best friendship. But this is where we are right now. I guess the main reason why I am so frustrated is because no matter how many talks I have with these girls about the way I feel, I still walk away angry and hurt. Sometimes worse than before the talks. Where is Calgon when really you need it?

 Addenda I must be doing SOMETHING right. Or wrong. Or...ugh. Today I have spoken (at great lengths) with the following people: Paul - My boyfriend Michael - the guy I met over Thanksgiving Brad - a guy that I used to date back in 1999. and the clincher: Ahmad! Ahmad just called me to tell me that he is finally over me and willing to be friends. I haven't spoken to him since he cut me off back in August. Remember the story? He was in love with me and was no longer interested in just being friends. Well, well, well...look who came around? I told him that I am "apprehensive" to talk to him again and that it will take some time before I feel as though I could be a part of his life. He understood, but informed me that he misses me and would like to have me in whatever capacity I could allow. Truth is, I am not interested in Ahmad anymore. That whole situation gave me agida for months. But friends? Maybe down the road. I gotta process this whole thing first. Okay, one question. Am I an uber stud? Or Am I a love hatin playa that gets his kicks off of making other boys love him? Probably the second one. But...ahhhhhhhhhh! How did all this happen? I need to go home for Christmas now and think about all of this. You know, if I were single, this situation would be something that I would revel in. But since I am not single, I just feel ugly and guilty. Just have to remind myself that everything happens for a reason.

 (I don't understand why...but I couldn't get rid of all of the weird little symbols in this post. Consider it a Christmas/Chanukah present!) At last! The 3 Weeks of Chaos is finally over! What an incredibly awful and wonderful time period it was. Lets briefly recap. Shall we? 1) My hamsters are still alive and running around although Jimbo has one foot thats dangling by a tendon. 2) One of my co-workers is leaving our office at the end of the month and I have been inundated with so much extra work, my brain is completely fried. 3) I took Kelly to see the The Ricki Lake Show on her birthday. It was the thrill of my life. On top of having an amazing time while watching the taping, I yawned at one point and Ricki points at me and says “Hey you! Wake up!? It made my whole life. (yes, I will tell you when the airing of the episode will be) 4) After seeing RICKI, Kelly, Angie and I went to eat at a restaurant in the area. We were the only people in the restaurant except for this guy sitting by the window. When he got up to pay his bill, he walked by our table and I notice that it is Ethan Hawke! UM! He walked over to us, talked for a bit and then Kelly shmoozed her way into getting her picture taken with him. It was hecka fun. 5) With all of the money I spent this month, I somehow came up with enough to buy everyone presents, send out 30 Christmas cards, and make 100 cookies to give to people in my office. My budgeting skills impress even Donald of the Trumps. 6) Had a huge fight with my friends that is just now being worked out. Picture it as a complete upheaval of everything that is understandable and acceptable in the world. I basically lost my mind and am just now picking up my gay marbles. 7) My family got word that my brother could be home for two weeks in January! God willing. 8) Developed a weird rash on certain parts of my body. Finally healing! My skin is so uber sensitive. It makes me feel sad inside. 9) Had an amazing month with Paul. Also had an amazing month with a guy that I am talking to online. Met him in Albany over Thanksgiving and have yet to give him up. Ah the life of being 26. 10) Saw an amazing one-man show, Addicted , thanks to my dear, generous friend urlLink Kambri Crews ! 11) Saw a guy have a seizure in the subway. 12) Ate about a hundred bags of CHEWY SPREES. YEM!!! And now it is time for all of this to come to a close. With the New Year comes a fresh beginning. I am going to make the best resolutions list ever. I will post it as soon as it’s done. This year, I am resolved to at least TRY to keep my resolutions. For Christmas, my parents have decided that it would be in our best interest to go out to dinner and to a movie. They think that doing things differently this year will make the holiday go more smoothly since my brother will be in Baghdad. It’s the first Christmas where we will not be all together as a family. It is extremely upsetting, but we will do our best to make it work. I’m just going to feel like such a dumb ass opening up all my presents on Christmas morning, while everyone just stares at me. And what if I don’t like something? I won’t have my brother there to make fun of it with me. Ah well. As I did on Thanksgiving, I will go home with a positive attitude and do my best to save Christmas. I am excited to see my parents, to open my presents, to eat Japanese food for dinner instead of roast beast. I can’t wait to sit around the Christmas tree and to listen to Christmas music. Paul is actually driving me home tonight. He is going to spend the evening with me at my house in Albany. It’s pretty sweet of him and I am very much looking forward to being with him tonight. We have been spending so much time together as of late and I am very happy with our current relationship status. Who knows what the New Year will bring, but 2003 is definitely ending with us a good note. So that’s it. I hope everyone has a beautiful Christmas! Enjoy it to the fullest. Be with family, be with friends, be with lovers. But most importantly, Be happy. Much love.

 I have a few extra minutes right now. Minutes that I didn't think I would have. So, tomorrow is Kelly's bday. I have planned the entire thing. Right down to the second. I know she is excited and so am I. It's going to be a great day. My nose is all sorts of jammed up. It's leaking fluid all over my tits and ass. It's driving me up the fucking wall. My boss just handed me an Allegra . Snoresville. I want something stronger than that shit. Anyone got some Valium? Last night, while at my apartment, Paul picked up the phone at the most inopportune moment. The guy that I had the date with during Thanksgiving was calling me and instead of reaching me, he got Paul. Before Paul could give him a piece of his mind, this dude hung up on him. LAME! Problem is, this kid calls me at LEAST 3 times a day. He will NOT leave me alone. No matter how rude I am to him. Probably going to keep calling me until I move out of my apartment. Luckily that happens in March, so not too far off. Ah geez. Okay, my free minutes are gone now. Latas.

 Happy 23rd Birthday to Kelly!!! I'm about to show you the time of your life! Get ready!! To all the rest of you...be back Thursday with MANY stories to share. Until then...peace.

 Have a great weekend y'all! I know I will! Or at least try to... PEACE OUT YO!

 In keeping with the tradition of the 3 Weeks of Chaos Here is how my day has gone: Spent a good portion of the morning fighting with my friends. Its been a rough go as of late and there doesnt seem to be a reprieve in sight. All I can hope for is Christmas understanding from everyone in my life. While I was on the phone with my friend Mariah, urlLink Ari reaches over to me, with tears in her eyes and asks me to get off the phone. As I go to tell her to hold on for a second, she doubles over in horrible pain and loses it completely. I immediately get up and ask her if shes ok. All she could do was shake her head no. I ran to get my boss and we decided that it was best that we call 911. I had never made a call like that in my life and needless to say it was pretty terrifying. Ari was moved into one of my co-workers office to wait for the ambulance to arrive. Within 15 minutes, 3 paramedics and 2 police officers showed up. They asked Ari a barrage of questions and then decided that it was best to move her to the emergency room. I collected our stuff and we both piled into the ambulance, me up front, her in the back with the paramedics. Instead of going right to the hospital, the technicians decided to do an EKG reading and give her an IV. On top of being scared to death, she was forced to deal with the pain of getting poked and prodded with various needles. As she cried, I started to cry in the front seat. There is nothing more heartbreaking than going through an experience like this with one of your closest friends. And there was nothing I could do to make it better for her. Eventually we arrived at the hospital and the nurses took some readings and moved her into a room. I made a bunch of phone calls for her and then sat and talked with her on her bed until both her mother and brother arrived. While it saddened me to have to leave her, I thought it best that she be with her family. I didnt want to be in the way. As of right now, we are still unsure as to what caused this reaction inside Aris chest. It is possible that she had an allergic reaction to the medicine she is taking for her asthmatic bronchitis. The doctors were running tests and asking her all sorts of questions when I left. I am sure she will be fine, but its the not knowing that scares me. All I can do is pray. While I was sitting with Ari, waiting for her mom, we both got to have a good laugh. The woman (a 280# black woman) was passed out next to her on a gurney. During our stay in the emergency room, her gown slowly crept up to the point that her big black bush was exposed. Ari kept saying Look at that Joe! And I would fall for it every time. My eyes glued to the bush of doom. I am always in awe at how strong Ari is as a person. She has constant humor about everything, even while being led away in a stretcher. She is an inspiration to me. When things go wrong, she has such a positive attitude. Thats why it hurt me so badly to hear her crying in the ambulance. It must have been overwhelming for her to cry. And for that, it makes me cry. Please keep her in your prayers and I will do the same. She will get better. Its just scary for right now.

 Quick update on Hamster Jim and Hamster Kim Things arent going so well for my deal little boy Jim. Last night I went home and played with him for a little while. The cut on his back leg has turned into a full out hole now. I can see his intestines I think. The wound itself smelled like fucking garbage and I gagged at least 3 times while I cleaned it. I held him for awhile and then I allowed him to run around my room. His energy level is where it should be, but one of his back legs has curled itself up into his body. He is essentially walking around on three legs. After he had worn himself out, I put him back in his cage and he immediately went back to bed. He is eating and drinking, but I fear that he wont survive for that much longer. My dad thinks I should drown him or suffocate him to ease his suffering. But the idea of that makes my skin crawl and my heart go into my throat. Unfortunately for Jim, he is just going to have to ride this one out. And I am not totally convinced that, minus the gaping hole in his back, he is in that much pain. He is handling this whole ordeal like quite a trooper. I just feel bad that I allowed this to happen. I adopted him from the pet store and then, due to my ignorance of raising hamsters, allowed Kimberly to rip his face off. I have learned my lesson, although maybe a moment too late. Kimberly is doing just fine in her new cage. I think she hates me though. She wont come near my hand when I put it in her cage and she hides when she sees me coming. If I am patient, she will eventually crawl into my hand, but I think she carries a lot of resentment. But honestly? Tough. She hurt my little Jimbo. So too bad that she is lonely in her new cage. Thats it for now. Taking it day by day.

 Reasons Why I am Going Out of My Gay Mind: My job is slamming me with end of the year bullshit. My boyfriend is becoming wonderful, essentially out of nowhere. My friends and I have been fighting with eachother for the past 3 days. I have the opportunity, thanks to urlLink Kambri Crews , to see two shows for FREE this week. But I also have tons of meetings/social activities to go to and am unsure if I wll make it to either of them. (Why does it seem like you can never do what you WANT to do?) I have a HUGE zit on my forehead. When that goes away, there are seven others vying for my attention. I have YET to think about Christmas, as well as Christmas shopping. I have to memorize monologues and work on the Theater benefit for January. I have to see the people I have neglected over the last two months. I have a birthday event to plan. There is a guy that likes me that is hounding me at every turn. I need to pay my bills. I need to flier the Columbia University campus for the Theatre Company. I need to CREATE the flier in order to, well, flier the Columbia University campus. I need to clean my apartment. I have to save money. I need to keep up with this journal. I need to write back to emails that are dying in my inbox. I have to do my laundry. I feel like I could cry today. I need to mail my brother something for Christmas, although it will surely get there much after the holiday, now that I have put it off to the last minute. I have to plan for a Murder Mystery Party that had been postponed. I am so tired. That is it for now. God, I could die from exhaustion and stress. But not until I complete this list! Ardios.

 My life at work SUCKED today. Will be back tomorrow with an entry. There is no question about that one. Until then...go finger your vaginas please.

 Happy Friday Everyone! If you are in or around NYC, enjoy the first big storm of the year! Yahoooooo! ~Back on Monday y'all~

 It is officially the 3 Weeks of Chaos ! Breathe it in deep and welcome it in with open arms. You see, when I was in college, my housemates and I came up with this theory called the 3 Weeks of Chaos . It is the one time period of the year when everything seems to hit the fan. If you think back to the days of yore, or at least as far back as college, you will remember that the time period between Thanksgiving and Christmas was always incredibly hectic. There were term papers to write, exams to study for, parties to attend, and professors ready and willing to use their red pen in a flourish of pure evil. When I was in school, we would keep track of the different events that would take place during the 3 Weeks of Chaos , so that we could look back in January and marvel at how lucky we were to have survived. There were times when relatives would die or boyfriends would break up with girlfriends; times when the local bar would burn down or someone would eat some rotten sushi and end up in the hospital for a week. Not that this stuff wouldnt normally happen during the yearit would. But imagine it all happening at the SAME time and there youve got the theory behind the 3 Weeks of Chaos . There were also times when strange and mysterious things would happen. For example, how did a handful of my laundry end up on our crazy, child killing, neighbors lawn? You should have seen my face when I came home to THAT little surprise. Things arent always BAD during the 3 Weeks of Chaos . Sometimes they are really good. Like I would find $45 on the ground and it would be mine! Or I would finally convince the buffed up straight dude that Im chilling with to take off his shirt and make out with me. And only during the 3 weeks of chaos would he do such a thing. And yeah, it was good. So here we are. Another year has gone by and the chaos of the end is in full bloom. It makes perfect sense that I would see someone have a seizure on Tuesday and that my hamsters would be close to death. It also makes sense that I have met a new boy and am still struggling to keep the old boy that I have been with for 4 years. Surely my job is hectic and my friends are bouncing off the wall with the excitement of the holiday season. But what is truly in store during this 3 Weeks of Chaos ? There is no way to know, but it can be expected to be a whirlwind of messy misfortune and marvelous memories.

 The bloodlust of Kim vs. The lovelust of Jim Over two months ago Kelly and I discovered two hamsters abandoned in front of our apartment. Our hearts grew to the size of watermelons and we immediately rescued them and gave them a new home in my bedroom. Although both were male hamsters, I named one Kimberly and one Neechee. The two hamsters lived happily in their aquarium until the day that I left the top off of the cage. During the night, Neechee escaped and was part of a tragic accident involving a box fan. He bled to death on my rug. I immediately went out to a pet store and bought myself a new hamster. He looked exactly like Neechee, yet I decided to name him Jim. The dude at the pet store warned me that the hamster that lives in the cage would most likely resent having a new hamster invade the dwelling. I felt so horrible about the death of Neechee that I went against his better judgement and purchased the little guy anyway. The second I introduced Jim to Kimberly, a fight broke out. Kimberly attacked Jim and threw his sad little body all around the cage. It scared me at first and I did everything in my power to separate them whenever they started fighting. I did this for almost two months successfully. When I wasnt at home, I am sure that they beat the shit out of each other, but I wasnt there to see it, so it was easy to convince myself that it wasnt happening. The day before Thanksgiving, I found Jim and Kimberly snuggled up together in the corner of their cage. It warmed my heart and gave me hopes about their future. I gave them some Thanksgiving treats and went home to Albany. Upon my return to NYC, I found Jims body torn about by claw marks. Kimberly must have spent the three days I was gone beating the fuck out of the poor little guy. The saddest part of the whole situation? Jim never fights back. All he does is sit there and put his hands up, eyes pleading for Kimberly to leave him alone. His mild mannered attitude just infuriated her more. I was so sad by what I found, that I decided it was best to separate them for good. My parents were visiting, so they helped me to fashion a barrier inside the cage, making it impossible for them to get at each other. Wouldnt you know it? They banged on the cage for hours, Jim doing his best to keep Kimberly on her own side. Late that night, I went to Pauls and didnt return for two days. While I was gone, Kelly noticed that Kimberly had figured out a way to get to Jim. She created a new barrier and hoped that this would keep them away from each other. It didnt work. Last night I went home to find Jims entire backside swollen and bleeding. Kimberly beat him so bad that Jim laid there gasping for breath. With tears in my eyes and anger at myself for being such an irresponsible parent, I separated them. Kelly arrived at home about a half an hour after I did. She and I worked together to make Kimberly a brand new home. Now, they live in separate cages and are seemingly very happy. Well, Jim is happy. Kimberly is furious that she has no one to beat up. That bitch has got bloodlust like I have never seen. And Jimmy poor, sweet, little guy, Jimhe has lovelust like I have never seen. All he wants is to be kissed and pet. And all I want more than anything is for him to survive. And at this point, I am not sure he will.

 What a day it has been! My morning started on a horrible note. I was waiting for the subway in Times Square, when suddenly a young man standing near me started convulsing and fell to the ground. He landed inches away from the subway tracks and to my horror, he landed directly on his face. People started to back away from him and I heard a few people shout for an ambulance. I stared at this man and watched blood ooze from the side of his head and thenhe began to pee himself. At first I was just scared that this was happening in front of me. I didnt know what to do or how to help. Immediately some policemen ran over to him and made everyone back away. I heard one of the cops say He has a medic alert bracelet on. The man just laid there, blood and urine surrounding his body. After a minute or two, the man began to wake up and he tried to stand. The cops helped him to his feet and I heard him say that he had to go. His entire head was scraped and bleeding and the front of his pants were soaking wet. A second or two later, paramedics arrived and had him lay down on a stretcher. I, along with a crowd of people watched as they began to carry him out of the station. Tears filled my eyes and I boarded the next train. When I got to work, I was pretty shaken up. I called my mom immediately to tell her what happened. Unfortunately she wasnt there, so I decided to go outside to calm myself down. When I returned to my desk, the phone rang and I relayed the story to my mom. I was crying and explained that I was most upset because the scene reminded me of my friend, Rita, who has been known to pass out due to epilepsy-type seizures. I couldnt stop thinking that it could have been her. It brings me to tears even as I write this. When I was finished telling her what happened, my mom said I have news that may cheer you up. She then began to tell me that my brother, Winfield, got word that he could be coming home in January for a visit! Now, nothing is definite yet, and the ARMY has a way of saying one thing and doing another, but this is the news that all of us have been waiting for! From what my mom said, my brother should get two weeks off in mid-January to come home to the States. After his visit is over, he will have to return to Baghdad until the end of April, early May. My parents are bouncing off the walls and deep down that is how I feel too. I am trying to stay realistic about it and not get my hopes up. But if he really could come homeit would make all of us feel so much better. We need the pick me up, especially during the holiday season. So keep your fingers crossed and the prayers coming. Winfield may be coming home in January!! Other than that urlLink Ari is out sick with Acute bronchitis and some sort of asthma related illness. I feel horrible for her. And also horrible for myself. The other Administrative Assistant, Michelle, called out today too and I have been not only doing my own work, but both of their work as well. Ari, I can understand and feel grateful that I can cover for her. Michelle of doomwellMichelle of doom is taking the number one slot on my shit list. Come to work sometimes why dont you? Lastly, Paul and I had a very honest and open talk about us. Afterwards, I felt so much better about a lot of the issues that we are dealing with. Truth is, no matter how much I get hurt or feel slighted by him, I am seriously in love with the kid. I want to be his rock, his best friend, and his lover. I want to be his boy. Its confusing and frustrating, and sometimes, its wonderful. But either way, its a journey that I am happy to be taking. After our talk, Paul gave me a gift, which NEVER happens. It was a $120 outfit that he bought for me during his day off. I opened the boxes to find a pair of beautiful slacks and a very hip button down shirt. I tried both on and unfortunately, Paul thinks that I have the biggest ass on the planet. (size 36 waist?!?! Since WHEN?!?!) The pants are fly and I am going to exchange them for the appropriate size when we go to the store this weekend. The card he wrote to accompany the present was the best part of the whole gift. I will save it forever. Other than that, the guy I hung out with this weekend sent me flowers. I had to write him an email this morning explaining that while I love the flowers and the thought that went into it, I am still involved in a relationship that I want to be in. Mark doesnt want to get mixed up with me. There is nothing but hurt waiting for him at the end of this whole thing. He hasnt written me back since. Ah well What a day, huh

 And back to work. Cept now I think I weigh at least 15 pounds more than I did before I left to go home. Luckily the weekend went pretty smoothly. My family did their best to keep a positive attitude despite the fact that my brother was unable to be home for the holiday. My mom only broke into tears twice at dinner and my dad only lost it once. I was really proud of both of them. I was the rock, though. I refused to cry at any moment and when I felt the wave of sadness start to take over, I did whatever I could to block the whole thing out of my mind. By doing this, I was able to get through the weekend with a smile on my face. My brother did call us from Baghdad on Thanksgiving evening. It was incredibly special for the four of us to be on the phone during the conversation. It was the one time during the holiday when we were all together. Thank God for that. He sounded pretty upbeat on the phone and it sounded as though he had a more comprehensive dinner then we had. So, at least he didnt miss out. Even if he did have to eat the meal with a bunch of hardcore military boys. (kind of sounds like my fantasy) I did end up going out on Wednesday night and wouldnt you know itran into a guy that I dated awhile back. He looked amazing. His name is Mark and he is about 6 tall and 200#. Totally my type. We talked a bit outside the bar and since he arrived sober, I asked him if he would take Kelly and I home, considering that it was 2am. He took us back to my house and he and I stayed up until about 4am, talking. And kissing. Oops. Yeah, I kissed him a couple times. I mean how could I not? Hes a BIG boy. And my day to day boyfriend doesnt kiss me that often. You understand. Friday night, Mark took me out to dinner. We had great conversation and I got the chance to get to know him a bit better. Afterwards, he drove me (in his truckhot) back to his house in Greenbush and we stayed up talking for most of the night. The rest of the night was spent with me in his arms. Minimal kissing, but lots of cuddling. It was nice and I really enjoyed having a big guy wrap his arms around me. However, when I woke up on Saturday morning, I remembered that I have a 4-year anniversary looming with Paul. I jumped out of bed and made him drive me home immediately. As always, I am confused. Paul and I are doing very well together. As friends. Breaking up doesnt seem to be an option at the moment. I dont think I will ever be ready to break up with him. I know we wont be able to be friends and Im just not ready to lose him yet. Everyone is encouraging me to be strong and has offered to stand by my side, should I choose to make the decision to become single. However, Im just not ready. And I need everyone to have patience with me. 4 years is a LONG time to be in a relationship. And its damn near impossible to just end it. (big sigh) Mark and I have been emailing this morning. I figured that there is no harm in keeping in touch with him. As long as he doesnt get too wrapped up in the idea of us. As much as I love the way he feels, the last thing I want is a new boyfriend. And there is one more thing Just a little catch. Last time I was with Mark, he fucked up big time. We ended up hooking up together and things didnt really go according to plan. Its a long story and it ends very nastily. Maybe someday I will have the guts to write about it in here. But until then, just understand that this boy will not be going down on me any time soon. Heh heh heh. Cept he wont be. Happy Monday!

 Yes I really DO live here If you saw last nights The Apprentice , you should know that you were staring into my backyard. I live in the heart of Times Square. Every landmark that you saw in that area I can see from my apartment. I have never lived in any place that has allowed me to see whats going on outside by just turning on the television. When TRL is on, I can tell if its raining or snowing or how crowded the streets outside my apartment are just by watching MTV. Its strange and wonderful all at the same time. (and for the record NOBODY who is ANYBODY eats at Planet Hollywood . Fucking terrible food and WAY overpriced) As I saw the contestants on The Apprentice running around the TKTS booth and in and out of Planet Hollywood , I kept thinking, I can be there in five minutes. WEIRD. Luckily for me, my apartment is on the inside portion of a high-rise. There is no noise in my place and no blinding lights. Conversely theres no sunlight either. Its kind of like living in a cave, only its a cave that smells like Chinese food. Thank you to Johns Shanghai restaurant for cooking soba noodles at 7am. Kelly and I are making arrangements to move OUT of Times Square on March 1st. Our lease is up and it is time for us to move to an area of NYC that doesnt cater to tourists. You cant IMAGINE how annoying it is to have to weave your way through hundreds of people taking pictures. While I am glad that you are spending money in my city, I am a little too busy at this point to stop and organize a group photo op. And also, if one more person stops dead in their tracks to stare at the colorful billboards and tall buildings, thus causing me to collide into their backs, I will probably scream bloody fucking murder. Yeah, its time to move out of Times Square. Its been a trip though. A 2 liter bottle of soda costs $3.52. The McDonalds across the street from my pad sells the two cheeseburger meal for $8.50. If you want a turkey sandwich from The Roxy deli, take out a small loan. They sell it for $24. And no, you dont get fries with that. I cant wait for the day when I can walk to the laundry mat without having to barrel over small children and groups of Asians. I cant wait for the day when I dont have to hear Free comedy show tonight at 7 and 11! Or Jenna Jamison is showing off her cunt and tits during $50 lap dances at Flashdancer! Or my favorite 35 t-shirts for $10! Cuz who DOESNT need 35 t-shirts that say I heart NY? Kelly and I currently spend $900 EACH on our apartment. Two bedrooms for $1800 and its the size of a huge walk in closet. Its not like we are going to spend less money on our apartment, but we definitely would like some more space and a more tolerable neighborhood. While it was cool to spend a year in the heart of the greatest city in the world, I think she and I are both itching to get the fuck out. So next time you see a picture of Times Square, stop and think how cool it is that Joe lives there and how fortunate you are for not. Have great weekends. Ill give Rita love from all of you.

 Why is it that every time I try to come up with a title to my entry, I always think The Truth about Cats and Dogs over and over in my head? Obviously this entry isnt going to be anything related to cats and dogs. Its just so weird that every time I create a title, I literally think The Truth about Cats and Dogs. My mind is being fucking wasted on pot and booze and endless hours playing with my cat and dog. Sike. I have hamsters you ballsac. Lets just hope this entry goes in a more focused direction from here on in. I have the most gigantic lip zit today. It is red and bulbous and looks as though it contains my new baby inside. The worst part? The lip zit I had on Monday is on the other side of my mouth and is in scar mode. Does anyone want to hire an actor that has lip zit scars all over their mouth? If you do, send me an email. Unfortunately, this amount of beauty cant last forever. Drink my cum. Sothis weekend Rita comes to town. I couldnt be more elated. I havent seen her since October and that is way too long. 2 or 3 weekends ago, I actually called her at 10pm on a Friday night and sobbed on her voicemail about how much it sucks to have her so far away. She called me back immediately and we just fell in love all over again. We decided that a trip was absolutely necessary and that leads us to this weekend. I know we have two whole days together, but its never enough time and when she leaves on Sunday, part of my heart will be ripped out and force fed down my own gullet. Which is probably for the best since Im gonna need that heart in the long run. As spring looms round the corner, so does Ritas marriage to her fianc, Drew. A day that I had hoped would never come. I mean, of course I want her to have a family and get married and of course I ultimately want nothing else for her than happinessbutbut its hard and a big change and shes my best friend and I wish there was a way for she and I to fall in hetero love and get married ourselves. She is the last link I have to the hetero worldat least as far as thinking I may still be straight. At 26 years old, Im not only positive Im gay, Im relieved. I mean, who wants to go through 20 years of being called a fag just to find out at the end of the road, that you really were straight? Talk about a fucked up life and a sad state of affairs. But with Rita, there was always that chance that we would really end up together. We are literal peas in a pod. We are THE perfect balance. If there was no such thing as vaginal/penile sex, we would have the quintessential love relationship. It would be nothing short of wonderfulness. But instead, I have to accept the fact that not only is Rita a women, shes not a bodybuilder. And we know how I feel about the bodybuilders. I am so proud to be able to be in her wedding as a groomsman and to stand by her side throughout this entire process. She will need me the most of everyone and I will want to be needed just as much. If there was a way to give someone your heart, Rita would have had mine long ago. Okay, I dont know where all of this has come from, but here it is. And I do feel a little bit more at ease about this whole situation, having written some of it down. Expect more posts like this in the next couple of months. Ultimately, I am SO excited for her and for the changes this wedding is going to bring into both her and my life. She will eventually have a baby (that I will steal) and she will have a house and a picket fence (which shell probably make me paint) and so many shit filled diapers that I will laugh and laugh and laugh. Pausing only to pop my lip zits. Ritas plane comes in at 6:05pm on Friday. I will be waiting there with tears in my eyes.

 Lying not down, through your teeth As I was falling asleep last night and saying my nightly prayers, I came up with a very interesting idea for an experiment. It occurred to me that I am one HUGE liar. Sometimes I wonder if anything I say is true at all because I am so used to spilling out nonsense from my mouth. I am not a liar in a bad way. Its not like I sit around trying to come up with grandiose stories to make myself look cool or to try and get under someones skin. Instead, I tell Caucasian lies. You know, little ones. Ones that will either get me out of trouble or spare the feelings of a friend of mine. But I do it often. Pretty much in every conversation I have throughout the day. Maybe its because Im too scared to offend people with what I really think. Or maybe its because Im nervous being myself. Im pretty sure its the former and not the latter, but without an experiment, how would I ever know? So I have decidedI am going to pick a day (Lets say Monday, February 2nd) and spend it telling the truth. When asked if I like your skirt, I very well may say Nah, its boring. When asked if I would like to spend the evening volunteering at a soup kitchen, I will probably respond with The only soup kitchen I work in is my own. If you are sucking my dick and I find myself unable to cum, instead of saying Its not you, its me, I will say Youre a bad blow and youre unattractive. Get your mouth off my dick now. As you can see I will be honest to a fault. I think it will be interesting to see how my friends react to my new attitude as well as the general public. Its said that most people prefer honesty as opposed to bold faced lies. But I have a hard time believing thats true. Now is the time to test this theory. So beware! On Tuesday February 3rd, I am going to conduct a similar experiment, but with a slightly different twist. I am going to keep track of how many times I lie throughout the day. I will carry a pen and a piece of paper with me and every time I lie to someone, I will make a slash on the paper. At the end of the day I will tally my results and figure out what kind of a liar I really am. If its more than 30 lies, Im going to shave my nuts and eat it. You know, as punishment. Thats what God would want. Check out this page on Wednesday, February 4th for the results to both of these experiments. MTV and ME As most of you know, I am a huge MTV junkie. I have been known to leave work on a Friday, go home and turn on MTV and leave it on that channel until work begins at 9am on Monday morning. I can pretty much quote every line of each reality series and if you want to know ANYTHING about The Real World or Road Rules , I am your man. Well, as of the last couple installments of The Real World I have been very disappointed with the casting. All Ive seen is a bunch of sluts and jugheads who couldnt carry on an interesting conversation to save their lives. But nowbehold urlLink San Diego ! I am so desperate for a decent Real World season that I am allowing these new 7 Strangers to live in my house regardless of the amount of drinking and sex that is sure to come with it. Last nights episode was excellent and I find myself falling in love with these people. BUTthe coup de resistance is surely urlLink The Gauntlet . It is BY FAR my favorite program on television. The show pits the two series against each other in numerous physical and mental competitions. The teams are comprised of past Real World and Road Rules stars. If you watch the series as regularly as I do, you begin to really know these people. You take sides in their petty fights and you cry when some of them get voted off and have to go home. I have loved this competition for years, but MTV has now done something that has made me jizz bomb. After The Gauntlet competition ended last Monday, I was disappointed to find out that there would be no reunion special. Instead, this Monday, MTV aired a show called Behind the scenes of the Gauntlet. They discussed every fight and every hook up that happened throughout the whole season. And talk about candid. Ive never seen a group of people attack each other so viciously. It was fucking brilliant. The best part? urlLink The Real World/Road Rules Inferno begins next Monday with some new characters and some old ones from The Gauntlet. Tempers are already flared, egos wounded, skin fragile. Its going to be a bear. And I cannot wait. If you get the chance, try to tune in to MTV at 10pm on Monday nights. The new season starts this week and you will be SO happy that you joined on. Talk about guilty pleasures. And kudos to MTV for always broadcasting quality and cutting edge entertainment. Theyve had a few slip ups, but overall, I am dedicated to their station. Bring on the fights and bring on the fun! I will make a bucket of popcorn and meet you on the couch.

 OUCH! My Skin Done Hurt Yesterday after work I went to the dermatologist to get a few things checked out. I was not pleased with the result of the visit. First off, she didnt get to my appointment until 45 minutes after it was scheduled. Then she rushed me through the whole visit and I didnt get a chance to ask her some of the questions I wanted to ask. It was very frustrating. Other than that, this is what I have been diagnosed with: Seborrheic Dermatitis Seborrheic dermatitis is a common skin disorder that can be easily treated. This condition is a red, scaly, itchy rash most commonly seen on the scalp, sides of the nose, eyebrows, eyelids, skin behind the ears, and middle of the chest. Other areas, such as the navel (belly button), buttocks, skin folds under the arms, axillary regions, breasts, and groin, may also be involved. This is exactly what I have. Not including the chest, breasts, or buttocks. But I do have it on my groin and it makes me embarracksed. With the cream I have been using, it has kept it under control, but there is no cure. Psoriasis Psoriasis (sore-I-ah-sis) is a common immune-mediated chronic skin disease that comes in different forms and varying levels of severity. Most researchers now conclude that it is related to the immune system (psoriasis is often called an "immune-mediated" disorder). It is not contagious. In general, it is a condition that is frequently found on the knees, elbows, scalp, hands, feet or lower back. Many treatments are available to help manage its symptoms. More than 4.5 million adults in the United States have it. Between 10 percent and 30 percent of people with psoriasis also develop a related form of arthritis. FUCKING GREAT. I was given steroid cream to get it under control. I have little spots of it on my elbows, my knees, and my forearms. You can barely see it at this point, but I notice it and it makes me sad. My doctor gave me 3 new prescriptions to try out. I really hope that they are effective in controlling this shit. It makes me nervous that some day Im going to be covered in scaly ugliness. My friend Rita used to know of this girl who had psoriasis all over her whole body. She had to bathe in like Epsom salts or something to ease the pain. Can this NOT happen to me please? Lastly, I told the doctor that my acne was increasing due to the medicine for the Seborrheic Dermatitis. She told me that this is a side effect of the cream. Well, that is just not acceptable. So instead of having scaly, itchy skin, I get to have a 16 year olds acne angst? She gave me a new cream to try and told me that it is experimental. Well, last night when I put it on my face, Paul told me that I smelled like a huge matchstick. Then the cream dried and turned my eyebrows white and best partthey started to fall out. Guess I wont be using that cream again unless I want to have a head with no hair on it at all. ERG! In case you are dealing with the same type of skin problems, here is what I have been given to treat it. Check it out and talk to your doctor as soon as you can. For the Dermatitis: Clenia - is an antibiotic and drying agent combination used to treat acne and other skin conditions. And Desonide - is a corticosteroid used to reduce itching, redness, and swelling associated with many skin conditions For Psoriasis: Clobex is a corticosteroid used to reduce itching, redness, and swelling associated with many skin conditions. If you have any further questions, let me know.

 You really dont want to piss me off I have been told that I come across as a very nice person. However, those people that know me well know that I am not nearly as sweet and kind as I may seem on the outside. I tend to be very manipulative, most especially if you wrong me in some way. But then when you try to figure out my manipulativeness, I look at you and wonder why you could possibly be attacking ME of all people. Here are some prime examples: I cannot STAND it when people cut me off in line for the subway. I also cant stand it when I am trying to scramble up a set of stairs and someone comes from out of nowhere and pushes me out of the way so that they can get up them first. This type of shit happens to me all the time. So, one day last week, this girl not only cut me off on the way out of the subway, but she did it again going up the stairs. Anger rose in my gut and I did my best to get away from her before I punched her in the back. On my way down another set of stairs, this girl showed up AGAIN and cut me off. I couldnt believe it. And what I couldnt believe even more is that without thinking about it, I deliberately kicked her foot and tripped her. She stumbled at least 5 feet and looked back at me. With the crowd surging behind me, I looked at her as though I had NO idea who could have tripped her. But deep down I thought, youre just lucky you didnt fall DOWN the stairs asshole. If I go to buy a pair of pants, shoes, gloves, dildos, whatever, it is in your best interest to be polite to me. I dont expect much and I dont need you to blow me. I just need a smile and maybe a thank you. If you treat me like shit and then hand me back the wrong change, I am going to take that money and laugh at you as you get fired for that missing $20. If you are a student that takes part in my organization and you talk to me every day like my college education means nothing in comparison to your Ivy League education, I hate you. I will also take every request you have and throw it in the garbage. When I am confronted on the missing paperwork, I will stand in front of you AND my boss and act like I have never seen you in my life. I mean, learn how to be respectful or understand that it will take you 12 times as long to get the paperwork you need processed. If I find out that you have said something bad about me to one of my friends or boyfriend, I will spend weeks coming up with a way to get you back. For example, were you wondering where that missing Metrocard went? Yeah, I saw you drop it on the floor and I stole it and I threw it away. Sorry that its 3am and you now have no way to get home. Did you call my office and ask for someone that doesnt work here? When I told you that you had the wrong number, did you huff and puff and hang up on me? You seeI dont like that very much and I have caller ID. Dont be surprised if I call you back periodically throughout the day using my blocked number and either blow a whistle in your ear or slam the phone down as soon as you answer. It really does pay to be polite. Its not that I am a jerk to everyone. In actuality, I tend to be a fairly patient person. I will not immediately hurt you. But if you come at me over and over or if you catch me on the wrong day, beware. I can be quite a psycho with no compassion. I have left many in my wake.

 All Work and No Play makes Joe a Straight Boy Work has taken over my life this week. I have had so much to do. I even stayed a little late one day (ok 15 minutes), but still. Although I have been busting my ass, I am still so behind and have even debated bringing some of the shit home. Don't worry, I've thought better against it. I mean, it's not like I make THAT kind of money. Saw 42nd Street last night. Quite an experience. Think I enjoyed seeing urlLink Kambri Crews more though. She is so sophicsticated and beautiful. I always get a little nervous when I see her cuz she comes across as totally together. When I hugged her, I accidentally got a piece of her hair caught in my mouth and I, unfortuantely, ripped it out with brute force. I swear I saw her wince and then I said "Oh, I'm sorry". But I said it quietly as I'm not sure if the wince I saw was because I ripped her hair out or because she saw the huge zit on my forehead. Either way... Had a wonderful evening with Paul. We giggled and pooped all night. It was great. Ate some subway, watched some television and spent the night tossing and turning. FUCK YOU NICOTINE PATCH. Today I am off to a wine tasting at Paul's job. First time I've gone with him. Afterwards we will probably get more drinks or dinner or see a movie. Tomorrow I am hanging out with my lesbians and getting new clothes. I am praying for a fun evening, but you never know these days... Super weekends to all!

 Things I Must Admit Since the early January wedding of Miss Britney Spears, I have found myself falling head over heels in love with Jason Allen Alexander. You know, her ex-husband. I dont know him personally and I dont think that he and I have much in common, but the feeling I get in my stomach when I see a picture of him is one of a kind. I think that he is the most beautiful man I have ever seen. In particular, I love his shoulders, his height, and his adorable face; which is new for me as I have never been attracted to someone because of their face. I spent a good chunk of my morning desperately trying to find a picture of him with his shirt off. I have seen glimpses in numerous magazines, but nothing I can really take home and make love to. If you are reading this Jason, please understand that I am falling in love with you and fast. Valentimes Day is just around the corner. Be mine? Hillary Duff has a new song that I just love. I have to say that I was a fan of So Yesterday and NOT AT ALL a fan of that do a crazy dance shit. But her new onemaybe its called Come Clean, Im not sure. What I am sure about is that when the rains fall down I smile so big and sing along. Clearly I am in fourth grade, with braces and pigtails. Does anyone have a pudding I can trade an apple for at lunch? I masturbate at work. A LOT. In fact, twice yesterday. I dont like chocolate or ice cream. I just dont. I used to be obsessed which is why I was Martha Dumptruck, but now the idea of it makes me cringe. What kind of American am I anyway? Willy Wonka would have slapped me right across my dumb face. I always look at my poop when I am done shitting. Sometimes I truly marvel at the outcome and am impressed with my creative design. For example, yesterday I took a shit that had a coil that could have been stretched for at least 4 feet. No breaks. If there was a Trading Spaces for poops, I would be in high demand. Surely. I would rather date a 50 year old man than an 18 year old boy. Hands down. When I was 16 or so, I thought that urlLink Gaston (from Disneys Beauty and the Beast ) was the most beautiful cartoon I had ever seen. Multiple orgasms on that one. And Im not even embarrassed by it. Go figger. I won my 5th grade spelling bee by beating out 200 or so other kids. I WON. My parents rewarded me with The Babysitters Club #9 The Ghost at Dawns House . I then moved on to the 5th-8th grade spelling bee and came in 18th. I spelled dessert as desert and cried when they told me to leave the stage. When I initially won the first spelling bee, they put a picture of me outside one of the administrative offices in the school. One day I was walking by the picture and heard a girl say Ewe. That kid is such a dork. I hate him. I was humiliated and ran away. Its VERY difficult for me to watch the Academy Awards and the Golden Globes. Most times I skip it and read the reviews. Deep down I truly believe I should be at those ceremonies and watching other people get their awards encompasses me in jealousy and sadness. I was so afraid to take a shit in a public bathroom during my first week of college that I went for 8 days without one. I drove home that next weekend and sat on the toilet for two full days. I was impressed with my control, but immediately had to figure out a way to poop at school. Turns out, no one uses the bathroom at 4:30am. Well, on that note, I am off. Probably to jerk off to urlLink Johnny Bravo or some shit.

 7 days in 24 Hours Yesterday was an incredibly long, yet wonderfully spontaneous kind of day. It began with me working for 8 hours at my job. I then dropped off my laundry, ate a bologna sammich and went to a 2 hour rehearsal. I must say that I am very pleased with the progress we are making for the AIDS Benefit, planned for February. We worked on our scenes, Mariah sang her songs and we were out of there and home by 9pm. Since I had decided to stay at Pauls apartment, Mariah and I shared a cab. On the way there, we decided that we wanted to go for a drink at the Bowery bar, one of NYCs hot gay spots on a Tuesday night. Luckily Paul lives right around the corner so we only froze our tits off for about 8 minutes on the trek there. Once inside, Mariah had a Cape Codder and I had a vodka tonic. We sat at a booth in an empty room and talked for about an hour; during which time we ordered 2 more drinks each. Eventually the bladder called and asked if we would release a stream of piss in his honor. We obliged. As Mariah was in the ladies room, this guy walks up to me and we have the following conversation: Scary Man: My name is Jonathan. Whats yours? Me: Joe Scary Man: Nice to meet you Joe. Do you party? Me: Yes and no. Scary Man: Well my friend Scary Lady and I have a bag of coke and would love for you to join us in the back room. Me: You know, my friend is in the bathroom, so let me ask her and I will get back to you. Scary Man: Its good shit. Come and join us. Me: Give me a couple minutes to talk to my friend. Scarey Man: Fine. Mariah exited the bathroom and I immediately told her what happened. We both decided that doing coke with Scary Man and Scary Lady was in no way the kind of evening we wanted to have. As we are laughing it off, the Scaries approach again. Scary Man: Hey you. (apparently he didnt remember my name) Come on. Bring your friend and lets party. Me: Mariah, this is Jonathan. Jonathan, this is Mariah. Scary Man: Hi Mariah. Do you party? (ENOUGH with the party shit already) Me: Actually, we are going to pass tonight. Its just not the---ohoksee you later. Without warning, Scary Man walks away from me and takes Scary Lady with him. ----End Scene---- Mariah and I decided to stand by the front of the bar and wait for Paul to join us. Now, without sounding like a total asshole, I must say that the guys were all over my ass. (I just know I am going to get a face full of acid for talking like that, but such is life) It got so bad at one point that I asked Mariah if she was ready to leave. She was ready, so we called Paul and told him to meet us at home. On the way to his apartment, she and I shared a cigarette and it was the best tasting moment of my evening. Upon arrival at Paul and Mariahs apartment, we ran into Paul coming down the stairs. He was in an incredibly pissy mood. We tried to be as positive as we could and told him that we would go back to the Bowery Bar if he was so inclined. Unfortunately, he was so inclined. Mariah, Paul and I then went BACK to the Bowery bar. At the entrance, we saw Jonathan (Scary Man) and his friend, Scary Lady, being escorted out of the bar by the bouncers. Obviously their coke wasnt THAT good. We then sat and had dinner. Paul was acting like a complete dickhead and eventually I exploded. I yelled at him for a good 10 minutes while we were eating our Shrimp Poppers. Mariah just sat there shaking her head. (She knew Paul was in for it after the way he acted) Eventually I let it all go and we finished our dinner. 4 drinks later, we trudged BACK home to the apartment, stopping only for McDonalds. As though we hadnt eaten enough already. When we got inside, we all collapsed and ate our burgers while lamenting the fact that it was 3am. We wiped our faces and threw ourselves in bed. Paul tried to snuggle. I told him to do as I did at the bar and let it go. I was not about to be snuggled after him ruining my evening. It just goes to show that when you try to have 7 days in 24 hours, its just too much.

 The Dream that Shook My World Last night I had a dream that really shook me up. You see, what happened wasI was hanging out with my friend Rita. Mariah was there too and the three of us were in Pauls apartment watching television. I remember us sitting on the orange sectional couch and discussing the fact that we couldnt find anything good to watch. I looked at Rita to make sure she was feeling okay. It was at that point that I had a dream blipyou know, its a moment where you knew something, but when you see it, you are reminded about it and shocked all over again. In this case, it was the fact that Rita was 9 months pregnant. When I noticed her protruding stomach, she looked at me and said Joe, its time. I asked her where her fianc (Drew) was and she said He cant make it. I need you to help me. I dont know what happened after that. I think Rita gave birth in the bathroom or something, cuz the next thing I know, Rita is holding her baby and Mariah and I are once again arguing over the fact that there is nothing good on television. Eventually Rita gets tired of holding the baby and puts him (thats right, it was a boy!) in a pet carrier. She puts him inside and locks him in via the little door in front. Side notethe baby looked EXACTLY like her fianc, Drew. We sit and watch television again, making some sort of conversation. I remember having the feeling of love for Rita as I watched her watch her baby. I also remember being really sad that Drew couldnt be there with Rita and their baby. She looked amazing, especially for just pushing a watermelon out of her vagina in the bathroom. After this nostalgia feeling wore off, I looked back at the baby and saw that the top of the pet carrier had been removed. And the baby was doing the creepiest thing ever! He was lying with his head propped up on one hand. He looked at me right in the eyes and said Pooey Doo. NO JOKE. Pooey Doo. I start screaming Rita, the baby said his first word! Pooey Doo! Pooey Doo! The baby winked at me and we all started to laugh. I remember having the specific thought of This baby is a super genius for saying his first word on the day he was born. I picked him up and held him for awhile with Rita on one side and Mariah on the other. They were coo cooing and I had a moment of full completeness. When I woke up, I was actually sad that Rita doesnt have a baby yet. But now that its 12:30pm and I have had some time to clear my head, I figure its best that she doesnt get married in May with a huge stomach sticking through her beautiful dress. I love you Rita. And I am so excited about the changes that this year will bring for you. Mostly, Im excited to be able to share it all with you.

 A Moment of Peace As night crept in, snow began to fall Lightly fluttering to the cold ground below Moods were high, wine being passed from mouth to mouth, Laughter erupting, cackles from above The covered earth. Memories created, lasagna baking in the oven Fresh greens to remind us of Spring Warmth, happiness, security A time when beauty grows Within yourself. A hug from a friend, a kind word shared The noble trust of years with you by my side. Your smile, your gaze, your sensitivity to my language Creating a wall that will separate your heart from your brain Allow yourself to trust in me the same. The television glows with comedic anger As we move from room to room Wondering if this moment will turn romantic Awaiting the time when we will be together As one. Standing by the window, we marvel at the blanket Of life, of time slipping through our fingers Caught in the breeze, held still by the streetlight Fluttering, for a brief moment Reminding us why stand in unity. An arm across a shoulder, cherished silence Intertwined with love, A signal of our future, the truth that brought us Into the lives of the one That we call our own. Winter will move forward, the snow will melt away But our strength, confidence in the choice we have made Will stay with us through the seasons Encouraging our happiness, blossoming with the new life That will begin soon.

 Welcome to my new friend urlLink Randyboy ! He is my new bud. Get to know him and drop him some comment love!

 Single People VS. NON-Single People This post should in no way reflect on anyone that is in my personal life. It just so happens that I know quite a few single ladies and I wouldnt want them to feel as though any of this is about them directly. Its not. This is all just something Ive been thinking about as of late. The other night I was sitting around and thinking why it is that I so often make Paul and my relationship sound like more of a hassle than it really is. Cuz the truth of the matter is that its not a hassle at all. Its a fun, obnoxious, wild, and often dramatic experience. Sure, there are moments when I want to slap his little face, but there are moments when I want to slap my best friends faces as well. Basically I just want to slap faces. You understand. Then it came to me. I always thought that I was making my relationship sound awful because it really was. When the truth of the matter is, I dont ever talk about how wonderful things are; I talk about how Paul did something fucked up or how he didnt keep his word, etc. Now I have realized that the reason why I make my relationship out to be so negative is because thats what I think other people want to hear. Those who are not in a relationship tend to give me break-up advice at every corner. Those who are not in a relationship tend to encourage me to drop it and be single. Its a freedom like you will never know! As though I didnt spend 21 years living single. A la Queen Latifah and Kim Coles. This theory was made very clear to me during a conversation that I had last night with my dear friend Karina. When telling her about my anniversary dinner and the gift that Paul gave me, I noticed a scowl creep over her face. Instead of saying how happy she was for me or how I am so blessed to have someone in my life that loves me as much as Paul, she said very haughtily Are you going to move in with him now or what? It was just about the nicest thing she could think of to say to me. I find that people who are in relationships tend to give advice like Have you thought about how HE feels in the situation? or Give it time and be patient. He will come around. Those who are single tend to be the ones that say You deserve so much better. or I would never tolerate something like that in my relationship. Its such an interesting phenomenon. As though these type of single people have either never been in a relationship or have been out of one for so long that they cant even remember what its like. I find that the girls that surround me in my personal life are very supportive of my decisions and my relationship. They love me deeply and because of that, they give me genuine support and advice based on the information I supply. But this is rare and I am lucky for that. As per my conversation with Karina, it is apparent that there is no way for her to be supportive when she is so lonely in her own life. Misery seeks company after all. I wonder what would happen if Paul and I were to break up. Would my mind and heart turn a complete 180? Would I automatically become the kind of guy that would try to make everyone as lonely as myself? In the past, I dont remember being the guy that wanted everyone to be single along with me. In fact, I think I preferred being the only single guy in a bunch of committeds. In this case, you are the one that everyone caters to; the one that everyone wants to take out and fix up. It can be hecka fun. I feel genuinely frustrated for those single people that date consistently and want nothing more than to fall in love, yet have a devil of a time doing it. If this type of person is able to keep a positive outlook and still remain supportive of their committed friends, they will be rewarded ten-fold. It takes quite a special person to keep up the momentum of dating while also allowing those around them to be in love and be happy. I know a few of these people and it warms my heart to be a part of their lives. But for those of you that are negative and bitter and make a concerted effort to encourage others to join you in your land of miseryshame on you. We have all been there and it is quite possible that we will be there again. Help us be happy if you want the same in return. When I ask you for advice on my love life, the first words out of your mouth should not be Are you sure you still want to be with him? I dont know. Its just something thats been on my mind lately.

 Updates and Lil' Tidbits Back in action! 1) Yesterday was my first doctor's appointment in the last 8 years. I mean, I've BEEN to the doctor since then, but I now have a real doctor in the city that's all my own. It feels GREAT to be an adult for once. The check up went perfectly. He said that I am in excellent health. The only bad thing he noticed was that I have a slight tremor (I was unable to touch my nose with my eyes closed). He said that it may be caused by my quitting smoking or by not eating breakfast yesterday morning. Either way, he's going to monitor it over the next couple of months to make sure it's not something serious. BTW, I can touch my nose with my eyes closed now that I'm out of the office. Figures. 2) My anniversary with Paul was wonderful! His gift to me was perfect. He bought us two handmade silver rings from a jewelry designer ( urlLink Jill Platner ) in the city. They are beautiful rings. On the inside of mine it says "APG loves JHC, 1/9/2004" and his says "JHC loves APG, 1/9/2004". We are both wearing them on the middle finger of our right hand. I was very moved by the gift. After this, Paul took us out to dinner at urlLink Lupa's and we had a great dinner. The wine was SO good and the food, although it was gourmet style and looked foo fooish, was excellent. The whole night was memorable. 3) I didn't end up doing the five senses gift. I am running VERY low on money and was unable to buy him a gift this year. Instead I remodeled his bedroom. I decorated it, organized it, and whipped it into shape. He was VERY excited and happy with the gift and I saved me some extra pennies, which I am in desperate need of. 4) For Mariah's Christmas gift, I overhauled her bedroom too. I wish you could see it. In the 4 years I have been friends with her, Mariah has never had an organized, clean bedroom. Now she does. I told her that I would be giving weekly inspections to make sure it stays that way. And I'm serious. 5) On Friday night we went out to Splash Bar. I think everyone had a blast. I know I did. BUT, there was one rough moment. There were these three middle aged queens hanging out in the bathroom at the same time we were and they would not leave Mariah alone. I pulled her away from them and they got pissy. I then asked them to leave us alone as we didn't want to hang out with them. This one guy got really angry and called me "bald", which I didn't like very much. I then told him that he was an "ugly 50 year old man that is obviously spending his night alone". He didn't like that very much and grabbed my shoulder. Now, I do NOT like when people put their hands on me and I tend to turn into a huge psycho. I started telling him to "remove his fucking hands immediately" and he kept pushing me and rubbing my head. Eventually the bouncer came over and asked me if this loser was bothering me. I said yes and proceeded to walk with the bouncer to the entrance. Fuck head got BOUNCED right out the bar. I felt so powerful and dared all of my friends to mess with me. 6) My brother is being nominated for a urlLink Bronze Star ! Read up on it to find out more. My family couldn't be more proud. 7) I saw Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King last night. I must say, this trilogy is by far my most favorite trilogy ever. I could watch it over and over and over. The last installment is surely Oscar worthy and will prove that point once the Academy Awards roll around. I won't give anything away, but dammit, it is rare to see a movie of such caliber. Thank you urlLink Peter Jackson for directing this masterpiece. 8) Ari informed me that there is a new remake of urlLink Dawn of the Dead coming. She showed me the trailer while we were at work on Friday and I still can't get it out of my head. FUCKING YAY! 9) I had one cigarette on Friday night. I caved and had it all by myself in my bedroom. I haven't had a single drag since and am still quitting the smokes, but I did cave once and thought I should be honest about it. Unfortunately, the Nicotine patch is giving me a horrible case of insomnia. I have to try removing it before bed tonight to see if that helps. I'm barely surviving on 6 hours of sleep for the last 3 days. That should be it. I have rehearsal tonight. We found a space for our February AIDS benefit. I am really excited that this is moving forward. I have to memorize another script during my lunch break today and I should be ready to go. Now, if only I could get myself an agent and make some money doing this acting thing. That's my next goal and it couldn't come sooner. Happy Stupid Tuesday!

 Its FRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIDAY! PHEW! I actually survived this full work week. When Monday began, I wasnt sure that was a possibility. With all of the holidays lately, I had gotten really used to sitting on my ass all day, watching tv, jerking off, eating boxes and boxes of donuts. Oh waitthats what I did LAST night. Tonight I am off to urlLink Splash bar. I havent been there in QUITE a long time. The lezzies in my life are feeling guilty, so they have offered to go out to a bar that would be of my liking for once. I thought it to be a nice gesture. Gesture. Gesticulation. Ation. Time for a new paragraph. Last night I was able to coerce Little Poop into being held for awhile. Now he is totally addicted to the man love I have to offer. Every time I put him back in his cage, he would either squeak to be picked back up or would sit next to the glass, with our heads looking lovingly at each other. I think Colby (who is the definitive leader of the group) didnt like all the attention that Little Poop was getting because at one point, he attacked the Little Poops and made him cry. I was NOT happy. If that happens again, Colby is going to be chilling out at Petland. He will NOT hurt my poopsie. SoSplash it is! This bar is usually filled with many a muscleman, so tonight I must look good and be ready to work my charms. Its always nice to have a big man to kiss and talk to for a while. Then tomorrow night is my anniversary celebration with Paul! He was a raging prick about it this morning, but my mood is too good to ruin. 4 years and he is still cunty. But that seems to be the way I like em. Dont treat me like gold, or I will surely show you the door. A la the guy that has been stalking me since Thanksgiving. urlLink Ari got me 4 new DVDs for Christmas! The selection is as follows: The Shining, GO, National Lampoons Vacation, 28 Days Later . WOO HOO! I couldnt BE more thrilled. I have so much to watch and I am proud to call these movies my own. My DVD collection is coming along just nicely. Thank you urlLink Ari ! Great gift! This is my 6th day without a cigarette. And wouldnt you know it? I forgot to put the patch on this morning. I didnt even realize until I got to the subway and then panic mode hit in. Well, now I HAVE to smoke today. I cant get through 4 hours or work with no patch and no cigarette. I was about ready to run back to my apartment or to hit the closest CVS for a pack when I realized that this is NOT a crisis. I only work until 2pm today and I have enough confidence in myself that I can make it without either. I am a quitter and I love it! The biggest challenge is going to come tonight when I get wasted for the first time since I quit. Definitely going to be hard, but I am ready for it. I wonder if Ill feel better tomorrow when I wake up, having not smoked 2 packs of cigs. Twill be interesting. Want to hear something sad? Yesterday, my brother called me at work, but I was on my lunch break, so we didnt get a chance to talk. Then he called my mother who was on a business trip, so he couldnt talk to her either. After that he called my dad, who was away from his desk, and his girlfriend, who was at the gym. 4 phone calls from Baghdad and everyone was too busy to talk to him. Insert overtly sad music. Poor kid. Just come home now please. Well, thats it. Leaving work soon to have an anniversary lunch with my boy and then off to see my theatre professor from college. Random day, but totally ready for it. Here comes the weekend! Breathe it in as deeply as possible.

 Ouch. It hurts to type today. Would you like to know why? Well, yesterday, I left work to go buy myself some new children. You know, hamster children. I had previously decided that I would be purchasing 3 or 4 dwarf hamsters to inhabit the cage that dear departed Kimberly left behind. I went over to Petland Discounts and picked up 3 beautiful new babies. Two of them are twins fluffy and grey, and from what I can tell, the supermodels of the hamster world. The third one looks like a tiny black cotton ball. When he walks, he looks like he is moving on tiny wheels. AnywayI named the twins Colby and Morgan. I named the little puffball Paul, but his nickname is Little Poops. I am in serious LOVE with Little Poops. He is so fucking cute that every time he came out from his nest I jumped up from my bed and pressed my big scary face up against the wall of the aquarium so that I could get a closer look at him. He is so adorable that I want to put him in my vagina and pretend as though I birthed him myself. I LOVE him. It almost makes me cry I love him so much. But then there is Colby and Morgan. These two fucking bitches are the most vicious animals I have ever come across. The only time they didnt draw blood from my fingers is when I was feeding them some lettuce. I figured that they were just getting acquainted with their new environment, so I left them alone for most of the night. This morning I woke up to find that their water bottle (which I have added an extension to, cuz the new babies are too small to reach it) was lying on the ground. I reached my hand in to readjust the bottle, when out of nowhere, Colby comes charging out of the nest and chomps right on my pinky. I jerked my hand up just in time to see a NEW welt being formed. I wasnt ANYWHERE NEAR him and he attacked me. I was furious. I pulled my hand out and noticed that Colby was staring me down through the glass. His eyes are beady and blood thirsty. Now, I have 4 bites on my hand and one substantial bruise on my knuckle. Little FUCKERS. My old hamsters never did that. If they nipped, they never broke the skin. These new little bastards have broken the skin by just LOOKING at my hand. I dont like them one bit. But then theres Little Poop who just rolls (remember, he is on wheels) around the cage being as adorable as he possibly can. Unfortunately, Colby and Morgan wont let me anywhere near him. I am glad that they arent fighting, but I am angry that they think that they are the boss. They better chill the fuck out or they are going to find themselves fending for their lives in the NYC subway system. Lastly, as I have said, little Jimbo is doing very well. He is healed up and acting like a brand new hamster. He and I have this new game. When I want him to come out of his little bed and play with me, I ring a bell and he peeks his head out of his hole. If hes in the mood to be held or play, he will stretch his weary bones and come out. If hes not he will simply put his head back in his house. Sometimes I want him to be held even when hes not in the mood. Ill stick my finger inside his house and he will gently nudge it out with his nose. I will keep putting my finger in there and he will nudge and nudge until I get the point. Its a very loving relationship and nothing like what I have with Colby and Morgan. In other news, thanks to my dear friend urlLink Jules , I have figured out what to give Paul for his anniversary present. I will be doing a Five Senses themed gift. INGENIOUS! And I am embarrassed that I couldnt think of anything that clever. Heres what I came up with so far: Sight: A book probably an Augusten Burroughs or David Sedaris. Sound: A CD that I will burn for him myself on my new burner! Taste: My cum. Well, my cum and ALSO a gift certificate to Starbucks. Touch: Colby and Morgan. He will LOVE the way they make his hands feel. Smell: A Q-tip that has been swabbed in my belly button. Okay, so obviously I have a bit of tweaking to do on this gift. But I love the idea. Im also thinking that I am going to take him to see a gay play in the city. There is tons of gay theatre here and he and I have yet to partake in any of it. Afterwards, he will take us out to a very nice dinner and we will spend the rest of the evening cuddling and in love. It would be nice if some sex was thrown in, but its been months since that has happened, so not counting on it. Ill probably just hook up with someone else on Friday night to get it out of my system. You understand. Its how EVERYONE spends their 4 year anniversary with their boyfriend. And that is all she wrote. Murder She Wrote.

 It is Wednesday and I must say that this week has flown by so far. I appreciate that. Thank you Monday and Tuesday. You are the sweetest. So, Im on my fourth day of no smoking and I must say that I am having quite an easy time with it so far. I always knew that when I was ready it would be something that I would WANT to do and not just something I thought I should do. I have some rough moments, but overall, I am in a very good mood. I feel healthy, I feel alive, and I feel like I never want to go back to being the person that I was, just last week. Quitting the cigarettes is something that changes your life in dramatic ways. You feel like a completely different person. Its almost like I decided to wear clothes, when I was morally opposed to it in the past. Does that make any sense? Fuck no, but I still like that I quit smoking! I had a horrible dream last night that resulted in me punching my mother in the face. It was very upsetting. When I spoke to my mom this morning and told her of the dream, she said Joe, dont punch your mother. That hurts my feelings. MOM! It hurts my feelings too! Dont get me all riled up or youre gonna get another punch. The dream sucked and I came in to work an hour late because of it. Or maybe because I wanted to lie in my comfortable bed for an extra half an hour. Get off my back will ya?!?! This Friday is mine and Pauls 4 year anniversary. He has yet to arrange for the day off from work. Yeahdont get me started on THAT one. In any case, I havent come up with a gift idea yet. Anyone have any suggestions? I dont have much money and I have about exhausted the creative outlet. One year I sang You are my Sunshine and gave him clothes. Another year I wrote him a letter. Another year I wrote him a poem and gave him a framed picture of the two of us. So you seeI think the last thing he wants is for me to perform a monologue or make decoupage. OMG. What about decoupage?! That could be fun AND adorable. Ok, stoppit Joe. Buy him a ham and be done with it. Our rehearsal went extremely well for me last night. My monologue is coming along nicely and I am excited about the decisions that were made regarding the February AIDS benefit. Afterwards, Angie, Kelly and I went for a couple of drinks and I was able to make it home for the last half of the new Real World. At first glance I thought I was going to hate it again (the last few seasons have REALLY tried my patience with Bunim/Murray Productions). But by the end of the episode, I decided that I love it. Of course the manimal Brad is extremely hot to me. But I must say that he is the ugliest hunk I have ever seen. His eyes are that of Sylvester Stallone and they look wildly inappropriate for his face. And hes a meathead. And I want to give him head. I also decided that I love the girl thats punk rock-ish, although why did the casting directors ruin her life by sticking her in that house. I dont think she will fit in well. And lastly, my favorite character is the girl who has jinormous boobies, but is built like a muscleman. She seems hella cool. Baright. I gotta go drain the lizard. Ok, since when do I use THAT phrase? EhI gotta go drain my cock. Thats the Joe we know and want to fuck. Enjoy the hump day!

 Over the last couple of years, I have been very lax about making New Years resolutions. This year I decided that it was imperative that I make a few and really try to stick with them. However, instead of forcing myself to come up with them and start on New Years Eve, I decided to wait until a few days afterwards, so as not to put any unnecessary pressure upon myself. As I said, I am serious about sticking to my resolutions. Sowithout further adieuadooraguI give you my 2004 New Years Resolutions! *Quit smoking. By all means, cut the shit and stop putting those filthy bitches in your mouth Joe! I am three days in and more vehement about quitting than I was 3 days ago. *Eat healthier. Pizza should be eaten no more than twice a week and there must be a serious cut down on candy. My teeth and my loves (love handles) need the break. *Complete 3 days of exercise per week. That means running or calisthenics or weight training. Jumping out of a plane counts and so does taking a really good shit. Ok, shits dont count, but if Im having a really hard weekyeah, shits dont count. *Put $25 a week into my savings account. God knows where I will get that extra money, but God also knows that I need that extra money, what with all of my friends getting married this year. $25 a week may save my ass in the long run. *Make one MAJOR jump in my acting career. This includes getting an agent or doing a student film for PAY or participating in any production that will get me closer to obtaining my Actors Equity or SAG card. *Work on having more patience, more self-esteem, more confidence, and better stress management. *Take an acting class. *Get my Passport. *Learn how to sew. *Go to the dentist. (Yes Ive BEEN to the dentist beforejust not since 2002. Im SCARED of it ok?!?!) *Be kinder and more understanding with Paul. *Go to church at least twice a month. No exceptions. *Create a recipe binder. *Organize my loose papers. (We ALL have loose papers, right?) *Develop my 25 rolls of film. *Hook up with a bodybuilder of substantial size. *Eat a vagina. Hork never. I think this list is fair and I have a whole year to complete it. To me, the most important item on this list, besides learning to sew of course, is to go to church. Over the last two years, my relationship with God has become strained and almost non-existent. I do pray on a daily basis, but its just not enough. I know that if I work on this relationship, everything else will fall right into place. Its time to focus on what is really important.

 Well, it is officially 2004! The last couple of weeks have been so hectic. I am relieved to finally settle down into some sort of a routine. I am such a creature of habit that the last month has torn me apart, both physically and emotionally. But now it is time to start afresh. It is time to move forward and to implement some new direction into my otherwise directionless lifestyle. Heres a brief recap of 2003s bitter end: New Years Extravaganza Kelly, Angie, my parents and I spent New Years Eve together. We went out to an overly priced, not very good tasting dinner. Afterwards, we played charades and a game that I had created all on my own. And yes, there was a prize for the winner. At 11:30pm, the five of us walked 25 steps to the center of Times Square. For a half an hour we were brutalized by the thousands of people that were crammed into the heart of the city, ready to ring in the New Year. It was a bit scary, but totally exciting. The jumbotron above our heads counted down seconds to the New Year and we all screamed and screamed and screamed. At midnight the five of us hugged and kissed as best as we could, and tears streamed down my face. It was one of the most memorable moments of my life. Luckily, we only had those 25 steps to walk to get back to my apartment. Upon arrival, we grabbed our bottle of champagne, went to the roof and watched the rest of humanity try to fight their way to freedom. It was completely overwhelming and Ive never been so proud to live in Times Square in my life. We were all part of something that we will (hopefully) never have to do again. But it was amazing to do it once. At 1am, Angie, Kelly and I went down to Pauls apartment and the night continued to be hectic and random. Initially we were locked out of Pauls apartment and we spent a half an hour drinking beers and smoking in his hallway. It was hilarious and awesome. Around 2am, Mariah came home and we partied until 6am. I woke up on New Years Day with a horrible hangover and the flu of death. I watched 4 hours of Punked with Angie and Mariah and went out to dinner. After that I spent the next four days coughing my lungs out and sleeping in my bed. Not a great way to start the New Year, but there was no other option. Im just glad that Im FINALLY feeling better. And much thanks to Angie who supplied me with enough Cranberry Juice and DayQuill to get me up and out of my bed on Sunday. The Sad Death of Kimberly On New Years Eve, my darling little hamster Kimberly walked over to the little car inside her cage, laid her head down and breathed her last breath. Over the Christmas holiday, she seemed to age at an extraordinary rate. Out of nowhere. I spent the days leading up to New Years with her sitting in my lap watching TV. I could tell that she was about to go. She received a proper burial in the garbage can on 46th and 7th. I plan on buying a new baby sometime this week. The Unbelievable Recovery of Jim Wouldnt you know it? Little Jimbo, who has had the life of misery since the beating Kimberly gave him, is now running around like a mad man. He is fully healed and is going out of his damn mind. He has learned to use his gimpy leg and runs so fast on his hamster wheel that I am convinced hes going to knock it off its track. I think he knows Kimberly is dead and he is surely celebrating. The little guy has a second chance at life and I couldnt be more pleased. All that TLC and hydrogen peroxide I used made him all better. My Biggest Challenge After 6 and a half years of smoking a pack a day, I have decided to give it up once and for all. I have made attempts at quitting in the past, but I have never felt so strong in my resolve as I do now. It has been 48 hours and although I am getting panic attacks and moments of tear inducing anxiety, there is no way that I am going to return to the life I once led. I want out and I want out now. I need the money, I have a desire to be healthy, and I dont want to be a smoker ever again. Enough is fucking enough. Be strong Joe. Be strong. My Lil Accident 8 hours after quitting smoking, I had a seriously bad moment. I was in the shower, radio blasting, when Paul decided to wash the dishes. I had shampoo in my hair, body all soaped up and was hit with an onslaught of scalding hot water. I backed away from the stream of pain and started screaming at Paul to stop washing the dishes. He couldnt hear me over the sound of the radio so I reached out of the shower to turn the volume down. Without any warning, my feet gave out from under me and I plunged headfirst onto the bathroom floor. I twisted my ankle and smacked my head against the wall. The pain was excruciating and the tears came immediately. Paul heard me fall and ran to the bathroom door, but it was locked. I reached up and unlocked it and he gasped when he saw my soapy body huddled on the floor in tears. He tried to move me, but the pain was unbearable and I began to throw up in the toilet. It was awful. Eventually he helped me back into the shower so that I could rinse the soap off my body and out of my hair. Some Bad News My brother called my family on Friday and told us that he will not be able to come home in January. His leave time was cancelled. We are obviously devastated. When he is released in May, it will be 13 months since we have seen him. The Theatre Company Rehearsals start tomorrow for our upcoming AIDS Benefit. I have yet to memorize my monologue and will be spending the next 24 hours doing just that. I am SO glad to have some acting to look forward to. A friend of ours is now doing guest spots on One Life to Live and the fire inside of me burns to be where he is right now. By the end of yearby the end of the year My Hair is wildly out of control. Someone grab the hedge clippers and meet me in the parking lot. The Real World Yes I saw Dannys boyfriend Paul and I have to sayWHA HAPPEN? Paul used to be HOTTTTT. But now Paul is scraggly and skinny. Wha happen? Also, thank you to MTV for showing The Real World: New Orleans from beginning to end. It was just what this sick boy needed. The Sims I got the Sims game for Playstation 2 for Christmas and I have already spent at least 56 hours on it. Its kind of an irritating game that is mind numbingly addictive. Someone help me help myself. Adios Thats it for today. Hope everyone had a JOYOUS and FUN New Years! Heres to a better year. For all of us. Peace.

 Ride or Die Wellity. Look whos back! Back again. Tell a friend. Fuck you Eminem. And fuck Kim Mathers too. Hi everyone. Long time with no shit cutting, eh? Well, dont you worry. Ive been stewing in a dumpster of my own shit for weeks. Unfortunately I havent been able to crawl out of my poop pile in order to write an entry in my journal. But here I am. Alive and kicking. So, why should we dilly dally any longer? Its time to jump right in with some updates! Work Ari and I have had quite a tumultuous ride over the last couple of weeks. It all started with a simple supply order mistake and ended up being World War 11. My boss scheduled a meeting with the two of us which had me sick to my stomach for days. When we finally sat down with him, he screamed like a bitch for 20 minutes until Ari shoved her foot up his fat ass. Eventually it all worked out ok, but I think I have had enough of my unprofessional, lackluster, waste of my time, job. The Big Move After countless days of looking at countless apartments, Kelly and I finally decided on a place on the Upper East Side. Yes, were movin on up. Its actually not too high up, 76th street. The apartment is gorgeous: Exposed brick on the wall, beautiful wall paper, cherry wood floors, and brand new appliances. Downfalls: 3 and a half avenues to the subway and the living room is a bit small. Its pretty much a trade off. A fantastic pad that is on the edge of the earth. But at least were still in Manhattan and the river will be beautiful in the summer. Picnic lunch on the Promenade anyone? Paul Weve been getting along, which is nice. But weve been getting along like friends do. Last Friday he and I had a very long talk about our future. I feel as though we are on the last legs of our relationship for real this time. He has quite a few issues that he is trying to work though and I have done whatever I can to help him along the way. Unfortunately I think there comes a point when you are no longer helping, only making things harder. I think we may be at that point. Wedding Showers and Bachelorette Parties My best friend, Rita, gets married on May 1st becoming the catalyst for a summer filled with weddings. I have only been to one wedding in my life, yet this summer I will be in two and attending a third. Clearly I dont have the finances for this type of summer, but all of my friends have been incredibly supportive and have offered to cover some of my costs. Some of the best times of my life have been spent with my girls from college. Our group consists of 6 very different people. However there is a clear balance to our love and an understanding like I have never been able to find in any other group of friends. I am in the midst of planning Ritas bachelorette party at the moment and it is fun and sad all at the same time. I want this to be the time of her life. More than anything. Theatre Company On top of everything else that I have going on, I am still an active member of the Theatre Company. Auditions for the next show are in two weeks and I couldnt be more excited and stressed by the whole thing. The Company has decided to do the play The House of Yes, assuming we have no problem obtaining the copyrights. If you have never heard of this play before, you may want to check out the movie starring Parker Posey. Freddie Prinze is also in it, but he sucks cock. And poorly. And he lets jizz dry on his face. And then he scrapes it off and eats it. My Brother In three months, my brother will be returning from Iraq. He is supposed to be making his flight reservations this week. My family has been awaiting this moment since he left for the war back in April of last year. Its been too long since we have seen him. Its time for him to come home to us. This Journal I have been so stressed out over the last two weeks that keeping up with this journal has been nothing but a hassle. Ive considered shutting it down. Its been two years of keeping this thing alive and it may be time to pull it. However, this morning I received an email from a reader in London who told me that she lives for my posts. That kind of encouragement makes me feel like I could never stop. Its emails like hers that gives me the fire to keep up with it. So, thank you to my new friend. Youve kept me writing for at least another day. In Closing We move into our new apartment on Monday. Please bear with me until then. Once I settle in to my new exposed brick apartment, I will be so relieved. I have a big weekend of packing and moving ahead of me. Im pretty much ready for it. But are my muscles ready for it? While I have 4 or 5 girls helping me out, being the only boy involved makes me a bit nervous. Paul has to work. Figures. Next time I need to date a big, strong, AVAILABLE guy. Then I will move every weekend just cuz I can. I hope all you readers out there are happy and healthy. Spring is coming. NYC is sure to smell like hot summer piss. Cant wait.

 I am very sorry for the lack of posts. My life is in complete upheival right now. As soon as things calm down I will be back with the whole story. Much love. Joe CuttheShit

 With everything I have going on right on, I will be unable to do a post. Have a great weekend. Be back on Tuesday.

 My boss is the Antichrist He has not only hurt my feelings and my pride, but he has proven himself to be a completely useless superviser. There is a line that a boss should never cross with their employee. And that line was definitely crossed today. It's the last straw. He and I will be meeting on Tuesday morning. After our meeting, I will be meeting with HIS superviser to discuss the way he treats his employees. You want to play hardball fucker? I'm ready. Be back tomorrow when I feel like I won't kill someone.

 What a Friend Does Today I had the honor of visiting my friend Angie during my lunch break. You see, I was having a super bad day at work and I decided that I would feel better if I jet down to Hells Kitchen to catch up with my dear friend, the Angemeister. Ora better nicknameor at least one that wasnt MUY LAME! It takes me 20 minutes to get to her apartment from work and then it takes me another 20 minutes to get back. I had previously warned urlLink Ari that I might be a few minutes late. Ha! Few minutesit was a full half hour. Thanks A-dawg! So, I arrive at Angies apartment and I immediately have to take a dump. Go figure. I had to shove my face with 3 pounds of Swedish fish last night and my punishment is tie-dye diarrhea. I sit on her can for a couple of minutes and then I flush, light a match and join Angie on the couch. She presents me with the tightest and most beautiful J I have ever seen and we proceed to wellJ it. You understand. Ten minutes later I am laughing my ass off and talking to her about all of lifes foibles. We discuss a number of things and stamp out the J. I ask her for a piece of nicotine laced gum and she obliges. With 6 pieces. Since I dont have the patch on today, the Nicorette gum saved my ass. I can now chomp with abandon and marvel at my cigarette free day. As I am leaving to go back to work, Angie presents me with a chicken breast sandwich that she bought for me at a local deli. I just looked at her with astonishment. Does she think of everything? Did she want me to pay her back? I didnt plan on buying a sandwich, but should I pay her back? She refused to take my money. Absolutely refused. I gave her a hug and a kiss and I took off for work. Angie gave me a few gifts today. The gift of J. The gift of Nicorette. The gift of chicken breast sandwich. But most importantly the gift of friendship. To be able to hang out with someone and have them change your mood completely in a half an hour? Thats a friend. To be able to talk to someone and have them listen and give you intuitive advice? Thats a friend. And finally, to be able to count on someone to look at you with understanding eyes and to take notice of how you feel deep down? Thats a friend that I am so lucky to have. Today will be better now. I just know it.

 Just Another Saturday Night? On Saturday night, the Theatre Company held a fundraiser entitled Aids. a benefit. The program consisted of 3 monologues, 2 poems, and 2 scenes. Also my friend Mariah performed 2 songs and we had a representative from Gods Love We Deliver give a short presentation about his organization. All in all it was a very tight little piece we had put together. Of course there were the usual panic attacks right before the show. Was anyone going to come? Did we have enough snack foods? What if we had more people than we had chairs? What if we forgot our lines? Why is the pipe in the back of the theatre spilling water all over the floor? It was completely nerve-wracking and hectic, but we pulled everything off with such grace. The performance only lasted about a half an hour, but the response was incredible. I thought that everyones performance was right on. I was also extremely pleased with the way my monologue went. I received quite a few compliments from those in attendance. After having in depth conversations with a few audience members, I was relieved to know that my piece was not only well done, but moving and powerful in its own right. I had stressed about my monologue for so long that finding out how much it affected people really made me feel as though the work I put into it was well worth it. We had about 35 people in attendance and we luckily made just over $400. We are donating 20% of the proceeds to Gods Love We Deliver and are using the rest of the money to get started on our spring 2004 production. We are wasting no time in jumping in to the next show as we are having our first production meeting tomorrow. It may be a little soon, since Kelly and I are frantically trying to find ourselves a new apartment in the next week as well. But I tend to work best under pressure, so I am lucky that there is a shit load of it on my back right now to keep me moving in high gear. After the benefit, I spent some time with a few guys who visited from my college. It was so nice to catch up with them. There were also people there from every aspect of our NYC life. Work, friends, lesbian bars, etc. The only person who wasnt in attendance was Paul. He got stuck at work, sort of. There isnt much to say except he broke my heart that night. And he didnt apologize either. As Ive been telling myself every hour after the showits fine. After schmoozing at the bar for an hour or so, 15 of us made our way to the East Village. We ended up completely taking over a local dive bar and drinking our faces off. It was a very eclectic group of people and for the most part it went smoothly. I am always perplexed by people who ignore guests of theirs. I mean, if you dont want to hang out with someone, send them home. Its irritating for everyone else to have to take care of your guest, while youre busy talking to who you want to talk to. And that happened A LOT on Saturday night. I dont think anyones feelings got hurt, thanks to those of us who took care of the problem. But if you ask me if I had a great time on Saturday night, I wouldnt be able to say YES! I would smile and walk away politely. I am learning to bite my tongue a lot more than I have in the past. I have tried being vocal about shit that bothers me, but to no avail. I have since learned that people would rather have smoke blown up their ass than they would to have a real conversation with someone. I guess all of this stuff is running through my head today because it is the first time I have voiced my opinion since Saturday night. I like hanging out with tons of people at once, but I like when I dont have to be the one that makes sure everyone is comfortable. I dont know if people expect me to assume that role or if I do it out of necessity, but either way, it is something that happens frequently. So yeah. The benefit was a raging success. The outing afterwards was ok. Kelly and I start looking at apartments this week too! AY YI YI! So much going on at once. We think we have found a really adorable place in Chelsea, but we wont know for sure until we see it on Wednesday. But could you imagine me living in Chelsea? ME EITHER, but I LOVE the idea! Keep Kelly and I in your prayers. Till tomorrow

 Have a good weekend everyone! I will miss you very much until we meet again.

 The Fall of Poopsie Last night I got home from rehearsal to find that there had been a coup detat in my hamster cage. As I entered my bedroom, I heard some loud squeaking. I flipped on the light and went over to the cage to find that Poopsie had Colby pinned to the floor of the cage. Now, if you remember correctly, Poopsie is the smallest hamster I have ever seen. He is a black cotton ball that moves on mini wheels. He is TINY, but as I found out last night, can pack quite a wallop. When Poopsie saw me looking into the cage, he backed off of Colby and put his innocent face on. I put my hand in the cage and he walked right into it. He can be quite adorable and also manipulative as I learned last night. I played with Poops for a while and then put him back in the cage. I went to get something to drink from the fridge and when I came back, Poopsie had Colby pinned down again. I decided to watch from afar to see what was really going on. Eventually Colby freed himself and I watched as Poopsie chased him around the cage, biting at his heels. Colby squawked and squawked and ran for his life. Morgan sat nearby shoving his face with everything he could get his hands on. I decided to clean the cage. I thought that maybe they were fighting because they were living in a cage filled with shit and piss. Once their new home was ready to go, I put them back in the cage. Poopsie immediately went over to Colby, grabbed him by the neck and shoved him to the ground. I burst out laughing, but also thought What the fuck is going on with my Poops!? Eventually the squeaking got so loud that I had to separate Poopsie from Colby and Morgan. I put up a divider in the cage. I fixed up both sides and made the cage into two little homes. Colby and Morgan walked around and decorated their new pad while Poopsie went CRAZY. He thrashed about, tearing through his half of the cage. The little house I built for him out of a cardboard box was destroyed within minutes. I went over to the cage and asked Poopsie what the deal was. He looked at me with his tiny brown eyes and I melted. But I was perplexedhow come these three hamsters have turned into vicious enemies? They were best friends and now they want each other dead. Who knows. But for now they must be separated. Jim, on the other hand, is doing so well. He sits and watches TV with me sometimes. Other times he walks around my bed and has little adventures. He loves crawling under my sheets and in my pant legs. He can fill a whole day by playing hide and go seek. I just love him and his sweet disposition. Tonight I will go home and love them to pieces. Maybe thats all their world needs. A lil bit o love.

 I screwed up. I was supposed to do a post today on the effects of lying and the such. But unfortunately, I lied about doing the experiments, so there will be no post about that today. Sike! I just forgot. Can you forgive me? Can we take a rain check on it and I will do the test next Monday and Tuesday? Or am I just lying once again? MWAH HA HA HA HA. heh. yo. InsteadI give you some Did you knows . So, did you know That I own 8 muscle man videos? They are kind of like porn except the focus is on the muscle and not on the dicks or assholes. I just love my men BIG and watching them on TV makes me blow my load over and over and over. The only catchone of the men in my videos died last year and I still masturbate to his video. Is that necrophilia? That I tried my first cigarette at the age of 20? I HATED it. When I turned 21 I decided I wanted to be a smoker because it would make me cooler. Now that Ive more or less quit, I have realized that being cool is what its all about. I should go buy a pack after work. That my favorite meal at McDonalds used to be the Big Mac? I loved it for years and would get it as often as I could possibly stomach it. Now, for the first time ever, I have moved on to the Big and Tasty (of course with cheese!) and I have never been happier. That I would rather be deaf than blind? That I have been writing this post for the last 5 hours? I gotta go. SWAK!

 Theatre brings me to Tears The theatre company that I work with is throwing their AIDS Benefit this Saturday. A month of work has finally culminated in whatever tonights rehearsal will bring. Although the event is 4 whole days away, we have yet to put all of the pieces into a concrete format. Leave it to actors to wait until the last minute. I know that everyone has worked on their monologues and I am very excited to put it all together. The production shouldnt last longer than 45 minutes, but it is our goal to make it as powerful as we possibly can. My monologue gives me the jitters. I have to talk about how I was in the hospital with AIDS and how I shit myself all the time. Its pretty graphic, but if done well can be very moving. During lunch today, I spent the hour running my pieces. At one point, I was sobbing while delivering my lines. Out of nowhere, I heard a knock on the door and was horrified to see the fire marshal walk in. (He was testing the alarms) He saw me crying and said Oh, sorry. I didnt mean to disturb you. I was so embarrassed and before I could explain myself, he shut the door and left. I sat there thinkingno one ever understands an actor. You should see me running my lines on the subway! Anynoodle, my friend Mariah is singing two songs and we are having someone from urlLink God's Love We Deliver speak about the organization. AY YI YI! So much to do and so little time. But thats how we all work best, so lets go! If you are interested in attending, the event will be at 6pm at a bar in Times Square. Yes, you can drink during the performance. Send me an email for further details. Other than that, everything is going pretty smoothly on my end. Paul and I had a wonderful night together. He made my most favorite dinner: macaroni and cheese (Velveeta style), sauted green beans, chicken cutlets, and Caesar salad. He is a wonderful cook and I ate as though I hadnt seen food in months. It was greedy and monsterish and I couldnt stop myself. I moved on to an entire bag of sour patch kids and Swedish fish and finally rolled my fat ass into bed. Dont worry, I took a huge dump this morning and was ready for pizza by 11am. Yeah, I gotta re-think this whole eating like a slob while not smoking thing. If you havent started watching The Inferno on MTV, you are really pissing me off. Get on the ball. Last night RUH RUH RUH ROCKED! Gotta jet. Not much time today. Must Must Must increase my bust?

 Rita and The Patriots and Pigs in a Blanket This weekend was a whirlwind of madness. As I sit at my desk this morning, I am reminded (by my sagging eyelids) how little sleep I actually got. I am also slightly impressed that I made it through the entire experience, from beginning to end, with a positive attitude and jubilant mood. Ritas visit was the shortest its ever been. We partied, we talked, we hugged, we laughed, and we spent every second trying to maximize the visit in whatever way we could. She was able to spend time with Kelly, Angie, Mariah, and even Ari hung with us for a bit! So many beers, so many bottles of wine, quite a few Malibus and pineapple. In total, I slept for 10 hours this weekend. And fuck do I feel it today. After sending Rita off in her airport bound cab, I took the subway to Pauls apartment. Sure, it was 7:30am and a Sunday, why WOULDNT he be expecting me at his front door? At first he was irritated that I woke him up, but after he had a minute to realize that I went over to be with him, he softened and even went late to work on my account. I then crashed for a 3 hour power nap. When I awoke, Mariah and I hastily through together a Super Bowl party replete with chicken wings, hot dog roll-ups and numerous varieties of vegetables, potato chips and dipping sauces. There was more beer, some red wine, some vodka tonics, and even a few bottles of sodayou know, for pussies. 8 people were at the party, only one of which was straight. Yes, gay people pretend to like the super bowl too! I think everyone had fun, although I didnt move off the couch for the entire evening. I just kept shoving my face with whatever I could get my hands on. It was sick and wonderful all at the same time. Then half time hit. What the fuck. Is something seriously wrong with Justin and Janet? I mean, I understand trying to push the envelope and shit, but at the Super Bowl? The event children stay up with their families to watch? Parents who allow their children to BUY Justins CDs? I just didnt get it and to be honest, I thought it destroyed their performance. It was bad enough that the Super Bowl performers were warmed up leftovers from years ago, but to end it with a jaw dropping removal of Janets right breast plate? Scummy. And lame. I was not impressed. And I was even MORE unimpressed that Justins reps are saying that it was a wardrobe malfunction. Give me a fucking break. You made a decision that was risky and it didnt work. Accept your consequences. Janets star metal pasty over her nipple? Clearly she wasnt prepared for the ripping of the costume. And alsowas Janets boob white? I dont see a lot of boobs in my travels so its possible that black girls have white boobs, but logic tells me otherwise. The game itself was really good. Very exciting. The guy who owns the building I work in also owns the Patriots, so the game meant a little more to me than it usually would have. The commercials blew, but Beyonce blewmy socks off! That girlshes the next Whitney Houston, I tell ya. Cept not Whitney. You understand. Afterwards, I stayed up to watch the Survivor: All Stars and the late edition news to find out what the hell happened with Janets titty bomb. Finally fell asleep at 1:30am. Crazy Joe. Crazy and stupid Joe. One last piece of info. for the day: urlLink Mary-Ellis Bunim (co-creator of The Real World/Road Rules) has died . I have to admit, this hurts almost as much as Nell Carter. Now I must get through the rest of my day as quickly as possible. I plan on climbing immediately into Pauls bed upon arrival at his apartment. It will be there that he will serve me dinner. It will be there that I will die until tomorrow. It will be there that zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

 Nelly + Taxi Cab Hike + John Kerry = My Life Where to begin? I was watching the local news last night and was pretty bummed to find out that the taxicab commission in NYC has gotten approval to increase their starting fare. Usually it costs $2 just to get IN a cab. Now, it will cost you $2.50. If you want to take a cab during rush hour on the weekdays, the fair gets another $1 slapped on to it. So, lets summarize, shall we? If you get in a cab at 4:30pm on a Wednesday and ask to go 30 blocks uptown, understand that before the driver pulls away from the curb, you will pay $3.50. Now THAT seems fair. But I guess if the cost of everything else goes up in NYC, so should the cab fares. Wish my salary went up as often as everything else does. Johnny boy (!) my new President. Last night I saw MTVs Choose Or Lose special on would-be president John Kerry. While I was exhausted and really didnt want to stay up any longer, I forced myself to sit through the brief half hour special on the Democratic candidate. I have to admitI was highly impressed. While he danced around quite a few major issues and never really took a stance on anything, I was impressed to see that he is a kind and smart man with a wonderful sense of humor. In my opinion, if you want to know what hes REALLY about, dont watch MTV, watch the news. But in any case, I was pleased to see him address the issue of gay marriage as well as the fact that most people that will vote for Kerry will do so on an ABB basis. ABB = Anybody But Bush. Kerrys hope is that the voters will not pick him based solely on the fact that Bush is his competition. Until last night, my feeling was the same as many other Americans. I am DONE with Bush and want him out immediately, but I want to have a reason for voting for the other party. Kerry does offer me that reason and I honestly feel like he will be the person that will bring the younger voters in our next generation of leaders. So as long as all you non-voters go to the ballot box, we will be free of Bushs bullshit forever! Funny, since I made the mistake of voting for Bush during the last election. Yet, what were my options? Gore? It really didnt matter. We were due for four years of garbage no matter how you looked at it. So John Kerrymy hat is off to you. You get my support and you get it with confidence. I trust him. Something tells me to do so. I believe he will be the candidate that will allow our nation to grow as a unified whole. Now, Nelly. And by Nelly (who Im usually not into), I mean, band-aid wearing, hot black guy that raps about it being hot in herre. You know him, we all know him, and now I want him as my own. Last night I had a dream. Similar to Martin Luther King, except I didnt nail anything on a church door when I was finished. Ok yeah I did, but it didnt have the same effect. In the dream I am sleeping in my bed. My bedroom door was locked and I was watching TV. Much like my usual routine as I go to bed. Suddenly, Kelly knocks on my door. I roll over and try to go to sleep, not in the mood to answer the door. She continues to knock and knock and knock and I start to feel as though I should let her in. As I am mulling this over, she unlocks my door and comes in. I am immediately irritated and I say to her Kelly, you dont just WALK into my room when the door is locked. She responds I have a visitor to see you. I spit back Kelly, no visitors, Im in bed! The door opens and Kelly moves to the side so Nelly can enter. I immediately sit up and am like OMG. Hi Nelly. How are you? Kelly leaves and shuts the door behind her. Nelly walks over to my bed and sits down. He is wearing a greenish t-shirt and cool jeans. He crosses one leg and begins to ask me how my day was and what I want to do for the evening. Without hesitation, I realize that Nelly and I are actually in a relationship and he came over to check on me. He looked devastatingly handsome. In fact, he looked more than devastatingly handsome; he looked more beautiful than any man I have ever seen. As the dream continued, I started to ask myself some very odd questions. 1) Why was I dating a black man? I had never done that before and it still seemed kind of odd as I am usually not attracted to guys of color. 2) Why was I dating ANOTHER skinny guy? I had resolved in my head that after Paul, I was NOT going to date skinny ever again. It just doesnt do anything for me. 3) How LONG have Nelly and I been dating? I felt clueless as to the factors surrounding our relationship. Above all of these questions, the thing that stood out to me the most was that I felt so happy and fulfilled for the first time in a while. I felt sexually charged and relaxed. I wanted Nelly to wrap his arms around me and to hold me for as long as both of us needed. It was a feeling that I dont get with Paul, nor have I gotten with any guy I have ever been with. As soon as I started to notice and enjoy this feeling, it was gone. I was ripped from the dream and left empty. Obviously there is no obvious meaning to this dream. A couple of years ago, I had a dream about P-Diddy that made my legs quiver and I had a crush on him for a month or so (sick, I know). I figure that this Nelly thing will be just about the same. The only real difference between the two dreams is how I felt sitting next to Nelly. There was nothing physical, no chance at hooking up, just an overall feeling of satisfaction. How do I find that in my real life? Definitely something to ponder after I vote for John Kerry and take a cab home.

 Do you know what she did? Your cunting daughter? Its FRIDAY! YAHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! I really dont have that much going on this weekend. Have to run a bunch of errands and have to play my new videogame see urlLink The Suffering . Other than that, I am going to try to find a way to enjoy the nice weather. Maybe bring my book (see- urlLink The Davinci Code ) to the river tomorrow afternoon and relax for a bit. Ooohthat sounded like such a wonderful idea when I wrote it. But odds are I will end up lying in my bed with my dick between my legs. Last night I rolled around in my bed with my lil guy Jimbo. He and I have become incredibly close over the last few months. He is so fucking cute that when hes near me I turn into a puddle of gobbery goo goo daddy goo. Gobble goo. Paul remarked on how well Jim knows me. When he would go to pick him up, Jim would scamper away and crawl inside the crook of my arm. He would then peek his head out at Paul and then bury himself away in my arm again. It was super really awesome really hella great cute. I love him and am actually looking FORWARD to going home and loving on him for a couple of hours. Umcan anyone say urlLink The Apprentice ? LOVE it. I was so nervous last night because I thought that my little urlLink Nicholas was going to get fired. I ultimately believe that Amy will win the job, but that Nickyhe is so fucking cute that it makes my legs quiver. The show rocks and I eat up every second of it. Paul tends to talk a lot through the show and I actually had to tell him to Shut his gay mouth a bunch of times. He then proceeded to tickle me ad nauseum. Did you like the way I used the phrase ad nauseum? I learned it recently and I vowed to use it whenever I could. I never knew it was spelled AD nauseum. Thats PRETTY cool. I love you, you ridiculous English language. What else, what else I guess not much. I had a fart this morning that was boiling hot. I think it burned the back of my leg. I now have a blister there and when it pops it will smell like eggs. Yumfree breakfast! Alright yallenjoy whatever it is you got planned. You best expect that this hot bitch will! Smooches! And also Booches.

 The FAT of It Last night I was watching the local news, which has become my new favorite thing by the way, and they did a special on a new diet craze. At first I was pretty excited as I am always looking for a new and creative way to shed a few excess pounds. I was introduced to urlLink My Pet Fat . Upon first glance, my pet fat looks pretty cute and lovable. I mean its like a little friend that you can carry around in your back pocket. I immediately wanted to buy one for everyone I knew. But as the news story continued, I became increasingly grossed out and ultimately offended. And as we know, it takes A LOT for me to become either grossed out OR offended. My pet fat is actually a plastic blob that is supposed to represent the fat gunk that resides in your legs, ass, or in my case, the mid-section. The blob is yellow and looks like the fat particles you pulled out of that frog you dissected in 11th grade. It is absolutely disgusting. The best (worst) part is that the yellow fat has bloody veins running through it to remind you that what you are looking at is essentially your own body. The purpose of this product? To remind you that when you are shoving Snickers Bars and Donuts in your face, those delicious treats are eventually going to become your own Pet Fat, cept it will be resting idly on your body. This product is supposed to gross you out and remind you that you shouldnt be eating anything that tastes good. The idea itself is not totally ridiculous. I mean, some people might really like to buy the 1 ounce Pet Fat to leave at their computer; its beedy eyes staring at you every time you take a bite of that greasy (wonderful) cheese pizza. I am sure that if I had a 5 pound glob of lipids in my lap, I might vomit everything that I put in my mouth. So you seepet fat could really work. If youre into that sort of thing. The end of the news segment is what really pissed me off. On top of advertising this repulsive product, the reporter included various clips of obese people walking around the city. And yes, they showed their faces. In the background the voiceover was saying something to the effect of If this is you, you may really want to consider buying yourself a pet fat. The summer is coming and its time to put on those bathing suits. The best way to look good in that suitcarry a pet fat with you as the constant reminder of how lazy your eating habits have become. Excuse me? Im sorry, but in my opinion, its about fucking time that we lay off the weight issue. I mean, McDonalds is cutting out their Super Size meals because America is too fat. Airplane services try to charge overweight people two fares because they claim the seats arent big enough for their ass. Atkins, The South Beach Diet, liquid diets, Trimspafucking enough! Truthfully, obesity is the number one most preventative killer in the United States. But does that mean that America has to go to great lengths to make overweight people feel bad in the process? Carrying a few extra pounds sucks for the individual as it is; combined with the fact that everyone else can see their issue as its displayed prominently on their body. They have no way of hiding this problem. I want everyone to mind their own fucking business. Its not like overweight people dont KNOW that they are on the heavy side. Its not like overweight people are ENJOYING being on the heavy side either. Lets take a collective agreement to let people be the way they are. If overweight individuals want to lose weight, let them do it on their own. Lets stop making judgments on everything and everybody. Lets stop criticizing. Its like none of us can be happy unless we point out the misfortune of others. It makes me sick. Sicker than when I was looking at My Pet Fat. Now, time to go plunk down $100 so I can have the urlLink biggest pet fat available! Hes going to look so cute dressed up as a sailor on Easter.

 ImImIm just being honest. Is it wrong that every day for more than an hour, I bring my blanket and pillow and sleep in the student lounge with all of the other kids sitting around me studying algebra, thermonuclear dynamics, and philosophy? Is it also wrong that when I wake up, I yawn and stretch my bones as though working at my job is one of the hardest and most physically demanding jobs I could take in this city? And lastly, is it totally inappropriate for me to lay there, with Jewish kids around me, imagining musclemen whisking me away to a land of rough, yet passionate sex? Eh. Just wondering. Cuz its my life. This week has been pleasantly uneventful. The weather is finally getting nicer, my co-workers moods have improved (slightly) and my apartment looks so beautiful bathed in the glow of warm sunshine. Makes me want to walk around singing Pinks God is a DJ. And I hate Pink. Unless its a pink vagina. Now THAT I can get down with. (running to the bathroom to vomit) Ok, now that Ive wiped my mouth of the excess puke, I can think about more important issues. Like, well, why does Jessica Simpson have a man face? And if she does have a man face, does that mean that Nick Lachey is gay? And if THATS the case, does he really mean to be married to me? Or how come Ryan Seacrest is 5 inches tall? It seems to me that every time I switch on my TV, he gets littler and littler until he is SO yiddle that all of the 14 year old American Idol Contestants are bigger and stronger than he will ever be! Theres also the plaguing dilemma of Rudy Huxtable in that Chingy video! I meanscaring me Rudy. Maybe, instead, I will discuss the difference between poop and pee. You see, poop consists of a solid while pee consists of a liquid. No, that cant be right. My poop is often classified as a liquid. They do come out of different holes though and that is very important in discussing the truth behind the poop and the pee. But is a stream of yellow corn and one is stream of peas and carrots. But both taste like vegetables and are good for you. On the other hand I think tha Gotta go.

 The Last 36 Hours Over the last 36 hours I have had quite a few random experiences. It all started on a stormy St. Patricks Day evening. I met up with my friends Angie and Mariah and my little ghoulie Paul was there. We had some drinks and played some music and danced around like idiots. Finally at 10pm we decided that we couldnt spend the whole evening inside. I mean, it was St. Paddys day after all. We trudged out into the cold and hiked our way to the Boiler Room . Once there we downed a few vodka tonics and played a few games that I learned in acting class. Anyone up for a round of BUZZZZZZZ? The crowd was lifeless and lame, so we THEN decided to go over to Urge for one more round of green vodka. Upon walking in the door, I noticed a familiar face sitting at the bar. I glanced at him a few times and I kept thinking, Thats urlLink Randyboy ! I just know itthat looks like my old friend urlLink Randyboy ! I turned to my friends for confirmation and Paul was like No way. Thats not him. But I just felt that it was, so I turned once again to that familiar Randy face and mouthed Are you Randy? His face looked confused, so I marched right up to him and asked him up close. Are you RRRRANDY? (Always trilling my Rs) His face lit up and we proceeded to have hot passionate sex on the floor of the bar. Well, the clothes stayed on and the tongue within the confines of our own mouths, but it was pure joy seeing him. The last time that Randy and I were in the same place, it was about two years or so ago. My friend Rita and I met him at a bar, while he was visiting from Chicago. He was a faithful reader of my journal and I always liked what he had to say. We seemed to click really well. That night at the bar was a blast, but in typical Joe style, I threw the wall up and never returned his calls. Now that our paths have crossed again, Im sincerely hoping that he and I will become fast friends. As we decided, hes supplies the gay boys; I supply the entertainment of lipstick lesbian hotness. It all works out in the end. So to my urlLink Randyboy : Lesbee friends! Very much looking forward to hanging out with you soon. After a couple of drinks, we left the bar so that Paul could make us all English muffin pizzas. They were burnt, but kinda good. Yesterday I decided to invite my old friend Mark (from Albany) to visit me in NYC. Mark is someone that I kind of dated a few times at the end of last year and we have kept in touch since then. Paul doesnt want me hanging out with him because he has a super good body and treats me like a princess. Its not that Im cheating on Paul by having Mark downwe never hook up. The most we do is hug a little and lay in bed with our t-shirts and shorts on. Very G rated. So Mark showed up at my place and we drank some wine and talked about our lives. It was really wonderful seeing him in person again. When he wraps his big arms around me, it makes me feel uniquely differently than I do with Paul. Its not like Im falling for Mark or anything, but(heavy sigh)hes definitely a breath of fresh air in my otherwise stuffy world. Mark and I ate some pizza and watched a movie and slept for about 3 hours. He left promptly at 9am and then I came to work. Feeling a little out of sorts, but also really satisfied. Nice combo for once. Upon arriving at work, urlLink Ari and I ordered some breakfast from the local deli. I took a huge dump and then we left to pick it up. Right before we walked out with our bounty, I looked in the window and noticed that urlLink Dan Futterman was sitting there. Who is urlLink Dan Futterman you may ask? Wellclick on his picture and you will see! He was very very adorable sitting in the window reading a script and drinking his coffee. I hope to one day say to him I think its very cool that we are in the same movie. Especially since I have been stalking you since that day in the deli. You didnt know I was there, but I knew you were there and I blew my load on myself. Glad we can be actors together. urlLink Ari was upset that we didnt give him our boobies when we had the chance. I was upset too. Other than that, my 36 hours have been a cake walk. Sometimes I hide in my bedroom for days, only emerging to piss and shit and occasionally brush my teeth. Other days, I run into my Randyboy, have an encounter with a past flame, and rub elbows with the acting elite. Now back to my bed. Have a great weekend everyone!

 I Answer Your Questions For my entry today, I have decided to go through my old emails in my CuttheShit account and to answer some of the questions that have been asked of me. I tend to be really lazy when it comes to email correspondence, so I thought that by posting my answers, I would at least be doing something half ass, rather than no ass. When did you realize that you were gay? I first knew that I was gay when I was in 8th grade. It suddenly occurred to me that when I thought about Arnold Schwarzenegger, my dick would spring to life. I remember specifically picturing a woman and having my dick go lifeless. Then picturing Arnies hulking body my dick would become rigid all over again. Now, to be honest, I didnt think I was Gay. I thought that I was normal; just not normal enough to discuss my desires with anyone else. As time progressed, I just hoped and prayed that I would start to like girls like everyone else instead of the array of boys in the weight room. It didnt happen that way and I finally came out the closet when I turned 21. If you could be anything besides an actor, what would it be? Honestly, there is NOTHING else I would want to be. Whether I make it big in my 20s, 30s or 70s, I dont think that I will ever pursue anything else as a career. The acting bug is ingrained in me and I dont have much of a desire to be anything, but a performer. The biggest fear I have is that I will be 75 years old and still an administrative assistant. I refuse to take on a new career until I have made major leaps with this one. Why are you still with Paul? Paul and I have been together for over four years. Not a day goes by when I wonder if we are supposed to be together. This is conveyed in every post I do and in every conversation that I have with the closest people in my life. Paul is a wonderful person and has a lot to offer, but Im unsure if what he has to offer is what I need. I find myself sad a lot with Paul because I know that if we break up, there is a very distinct possibility of me losing him entirely. I guess I keep hoping that by holding out, things will just get better. There is a lot more to this story, but not having Paul is my life is the biggest inhibitor to me making that change. What is your favorite thing to do in New York City? My most favorite thing to do in New York City has to be sitting outside at a restaurant with a glass of wine in one hand and a cigarette in the other. I could take or leave the food, no matter what restaurant we are at. Chilling with a friend on a beautiful New York afternoon, sun shining, both of us laughing, smoke coming from our nostrilsits a beautiful thing really. I am muchly looking forward to Spring. When I come visit, can I stay with you? No. If you could live anywhere else in the world, where would it be? If I could live anywhere in the world, it would be on the beach in California. I have been having a major gnawing at my insides to move out West. I dont think Im ready for that kind of change yet, but it is definitely in the cards for my future. I love New York. Always will. But I prefer the warmth and I prefer cars to public transportation. Mostly I just want to be in a place that is a bit more relaxed that the bitter, fast paced lifestyle of New York City. I thrive on being busy and do my best work when stress is involved. However, I dont enjoy the stress when it involves going to the corner food mart to get a soda. Everything here is a hassle. An addicting hassle, but a hassle nonetheless. Are you angry at your brother for joining the army? I wouldnt say that I am angry WITH my brother, but I am definitely angry at the situation. While my posts dont always reflect my respect for the US ARMY, I definitely have it instilled in me. My father served in the ARMY Reserves for over 25 years and he always taught his children about the importance of the military. Some days it gets a little too hard for me. Hence my post yesterday. But most times I am overly proud and in awe of what people like my brother do on a daily basis. The selfish side of me wants my brother back for me. He and I are incredibly close and not having him near me over the last couple of years has definitely taken its toll on my heart. I just want him back. We can discuss the ARMY and his role in it after that. Are you going to close down your journal? Not just yet! I will give ample notice, I promise. OK! Thats it for today. I hope I didnt offend anyone by answering these questions in a public format, but I kept everyone anonymous so that it was something we could all share equally. I appreciate the email feedback I get and hope that everyone understands that I am truly horrible with correspondence of any kind. Ask any of my friends who live out of town (please dont bother my friends). Have a great day yall! Much much love and respect.

 Winfield My brother called yesterday and we spoke on the phone for almost an hour. There isnt that much going on with me at my job this week, so I was really able to give him my full attention, which he truly deserves during every phone call. I was hoping I would hear from him yesterday and like he could read my mind, the phone rang at 2:30pm and we got to have our talk. Overall, my brother is in very high spirits. He has handled his tour in Baghdad with such grace and positivity. It always astounds me that he has such strict control over his emotions. I can barely keep a smile on my face for one full day and I live in NYC with my friends and crack whores all around me. But Winfield very rarely cries about being in Baghdad. Yesterday, he even told me that he is so happy that he has been able to have the experience of being in a war. It has given him quite a lot of perspective. It was at this point that he and I discussed his future career with the military. When I was in Syracuse this weekend, I had the opportunity to discuss my brothers return from Baghdad with Ritas mother. She has quite a bit of personal experience in this area as Ritas dad has been in the service for over 25 years. He has been all over the world and as she told me this weekend that they have encountered many obstacles once he returned from his tour of duties. Expect Winfield to be kind of cold upon his arrival. It will be hard for him to return to normal life after being submersed in a war zone for over a year. It felt so good being able to get advice from someone who actually knows what it is like to be in this type of situation. During the conversation with my brother, we mostly discussed our plans for his visit in May. He wants to do everything, from seeing Broadway plays to sitting around watching corny TV. Once I found a lull in the conversation, I asked him about his future in the ARMY. Usually my brother responds I am done as soon as I get out in May. I cant wait for this whole thing to be over and to be able to pursue a different path. However, yesterday he said the opposite. I dont know what I want to do yet. Im thinking that I could remain in the military and pursue a different path with them. I about lost my shit. Now, with all due respect, my brother has achieved quite a bit during his short time in the service. He moves up in the ranks very quickly and he has always been at the top of his class. As was written a couple months ago in this journal, he has even been nominated for a Bronze Star. He must be doing GREAT things there for this to have happened. The second he mentioned continuing with the military, we launched into a very in depth conversation about the effects of this kind of decision on both his girlfriend and family. While my brother thinks that he needs to do what he needs to do, I was very clear in reminding him that his decision does not effect him alone. He has always done what he thinks he needs to do, without any regard for the consequences on those that love him. I explained that while we may never know what it was really like for him to be in Baghdad, he will never know what it was like for all of us to be here; worrying and crying and freaking out every day over the fact that he is in consistent danger. In my opinion, his life may be more physically dangerous, but our lives have been emotionally crippled by his choices. It will be impossible for me to ever understand a personal calling such as his. I feel the same type of calling, but its for performance, and it doesnt worry my family that I would be killed in my pursuit of this dream. While I may wholeheartedly disagree with his thought process in continuing with the military, I will always be here to support whatever decision he makes. BUT, I will put him through emotional hell before that happens. And I will enforce the fact that he and I will never be as close as we could be if he made the choice to get out. I drove my point home yesterday and I know he heard me loud and clear. Stay in the military if that is what you wish, but the daily support will not be as powerful and understanding as it is now. My parents are VERY strong in their resolve to see him out of the ARMY. When I called my mom to tell her about my conversation with my brother, she was like He does not want to come home and tell me that he is staying in the service. Ill kill him. While this may seem a bit ludicrous to some people, I agree with her completely and will do whatever I can to keep him out. Ultimately supporting him in his decision the best I can. Not everyone is cut out for the military lifestyle. My brother is good at everything he does. He has talents that have yet to be explored. For him to continue in the same vein only limits his talents and leaves all of us in constant fear. By the end of the conversation, I could tell that he was happily influenced by my words. Sometimes its hard to remember that you have a life that is very fragile back home. Sometimes its hard to forget where your priorities really lie. All I can do at this point is to be as understanding as I can be. But the truth of the matter is, he better not decide to stay in. We will ALL be against that decision and it will tear our family further apart. I am excited, but also filled with anxiety about his impending visit. Who will he be? How will he act? What decisions will he have already made? I pray to God, cuz thats the only thing I really know how to do. God will take care of it and will lead my brother in the right direction. I can only hope that he will soften our hearts to this in the process.

 A Wonderful Weekend That Ended In A Nightmare This weekend I was an honorary woman at my best friend Ritas wedding shower. Picture 25 women and me the superGAYstar of the group. To be honest, I thought that I was going to feel more uncomfortable than I did. In fact, I loved being the only guy. The girls totally treated me like a man (despite the amount of estrogen) and I really felt super special. I was the one that got to help Rita open her presents. I was the one who held the pole during the piata game. I was the one that spent the most time with Ritas family. And I was the one that Rita would look at to find that feeling of home. At one point I pulled her aside and I said Usually I would need you to reaffirm my friendship with you and its importance during this type of event, but this time I feel it automatically. I feel like its happening to you and I at the same time. I feel it and I couldnt be happier than I am right now. Ritas sister, Jeannie, planned the most amazing wedding shower. It was catered by urlLink Dinosaur BBQ which supplied delicious pulled pork sandwiches. I ate 4 within a couple of hours and boy did I enjoy every burp that I had for the rest of the afternoon! Rita raked in some pretty incredible presents as well. It made me totally want to get married. I mean, I could SO use a new set of wooden spoons. I took my friend Angie with me on the trip. She and Rita have known each other for a couple of years and I thought it would be good for her to get out of the city for awhile. Well, I didnt expect her to get along with everyone as well as she did. I mean, she was without a doubt the star of the weekend. She had the best jokes, the best hugs, and made it comfortable not only for me to spend time with everyone alone, but as a group as well. At one point, Ritas family started chanting Angie for President 2004! I cant tell you how proud I was to have her by my side. If I needed anything, Angie was there with support. From talks to favors I needed, she never complained once. In fact, she obliged with nothing but love. Muchly impressed with her. I also got fitted for my urlLink Tux ! It looks SO handsome and I could see the joy all over Ritas face. The wedding is in 7 weeks and I couldnt be more excited. Her wedding dress is the best I have ever seen. Simple, yet SO elegant. If it werent for her fianc, I think that she and I would look AMAZING standing next to each other at the alter. Except for the no sex on the honeymoon part. Too short of a weekend for my tastes, but arent they all? Last night when I got home, I immediately climbed into bed with Paul. We had some nice talks and laughs and shoved our faces with pounds of Italian food. Maybe it was the amount I ate before bed or it was the fact that I have so much swirling around my mind, but in any case, this is what I dreamed: My parents, friends and I were hanging out in my house. I was trying to feed the hamsters when I noticed that they were multiplying. (You may recall that I had a similar dream to this a couple of months ago) There were the cutest little babies and I remember my mom and me playing with them for what seemed like hours. But thenthe inevitablethey started coming out of my closets and out from under my bed and they began to bite me over and over. My parents and I ran away from them and got into the car. Along the trip I became enraged with anger. It felt like an intense burning in my stomach that I couldnt release in any way other than with physical brutality. I began kicking the door from inside the car. It wouldnt break off so I began screaming at my mother while repeatedly kicking at the hinges of the door. I remember wishing that I could cry and release the anger that way, but it was physically impossible. Eventually I broke the door off the car and got out. I then turned around and began kicking the doors to my parents car inward. My mother was screaming for me to stop and I continued to let the fury out threw kicking. It was awful. The whole time I was dreaming I tried to make myself calm down, but couldnt. When I woke up at 5am this morning, I was covered in sweat and shaking. I immediately lit a cigarette and sat there trying to erase the dream from my head. When I fell back to sleep, I noticed that the hamsters were still multiplying in my head and the dream began all over again. My alarm went off at 7:30am this morning and I just laid there upset. Why am I so subconsciously angry? It definitely gave me a lot to think about today. Especially after having such a beautifully calm weekend with my best friends.

 Rolling Eyes Emoticon There are two people in my office today. My boss and me. Everyone else is either out on vacation or home sick. Its quite nice to have absolute silence in the work place, but I have to admit that Im also tremendously bored. Theres only so much playing a girl can do! I wasnt going to go out for Mariahs birthday event last night, but at the last minute decided that I had to push myself through it. I showed up at urlLink Pop Burger at 9:30pm and for the next two hours fit in as many conversations with old friends as I could. It was quite productive as far as catching up with people goes. If you have never been to Pop Burger before, you must understand that the front of the restaurant looks like an extra hip McDonalds. The back part is a lounge/bar. Its totally Metrosexual, which makes me cringe with irritation, but a very chill and laid back crowd overall. The cheeseburgers are mini-sized and taste like heaven. Well, if heaven were made of cheeseburgers. At one point, I am sitting talking to my friend Joanna, when Kelly comes out of nowhere, puts her hands around my throat and shoves me against the wall. Now, this may seem a little violent to the average reader, but as soon as Kelly did that, I looked at her and said What now?!?! (Knowing that someone or something huge had just happened. - See, Kelly and I communicate via grabbing each other by the throat. You understand.) She looks at me with huge eyes and says Ahmad is on a date with a guy in the restaurant next door. I was like BOH!? I immediately threw my jacket on, made sure Paul was out of sight, and hightailed it out the front door with her. Kelly, being the gem that she is, went in to the restaurant and pulled Ahmad from his date. I talked with him for about 10 minutes, the whole time him saying how SO OVER ME HE IS. We made tentative dinner plans for the next couple of weeks. But I still believe that if you have to tell someone that you are over them, you clearly arent. He did look good. Very solid and pumped up. However, I just dont get the fire for him anymore. He is a sweet kid and always treated me with nothing, but respect. Yet, I dont feel any sort of chemistry with him any more. Also, the guy he was on the date with? YIKERIFF! When his date looked away, I looked at Ahmad and I go Umno. Ahmad and I laughed at the fact that he was on a date with a nasty gay boy and then he left with him. Figures. I left with Kelly around 11:30pm so that I could get some sleep before the big weekend of Ritas wedding shower. Mariah walked in to the apartment at 1am and told me that Paul was completely missing. She and my friend Angie had put him in a cab and paid for his ride home a half hour earlier. Of course they had to peel his drunk ass off the ground before doing so. But when she arrived at home and Paul wasnt there, we both started to panic. He walked in around 3:30am. When I woke up this morning I asked him where he was all night. This was our brief conversation: Me: Where WERE you all night? Paul: I have no idea at all. Me: Did you go back out to another bar by yourself? Paul: No I walked home when Mariah left. Me: No you didnt. You fell on the ground and hit your head and Mariah and Angie put you in a cab and sent you home. Paul: Then why was I walking for hours? Me: Thats the whole point. Why did you get out of the cab and then just walk for hours? It doesnt make any sense to me. You went to another bar. Paul: I have no idea where I was or what happened. Me: So you are saying that you lost two hours of your life. You have no way of figuring out what happened between 1-3am? Paul: I have no idea at all. Me: You know who else loses hours of their life after falling down and slamming their head on the pavement? Paul: Who? Me: Alcoholics. Then I left for work. Ill deal with that sorry shit on Sunday. Im REALLY glad to go to Syracuse this weekend. I definitely need some time away from this whole scene. It will feel so good to be in the open fresh air of Suburbia USA! Nice change of pace. Get ready Rita! Im on my way!

 What a Difference a Day Makes So yesterday when I left work, I was remarking on how things seemed to be going very smoothly in my life. I mean, chaotic as fuck, but no real surprises. Since everything has been so nuts over the last month or so, I was happy to have a couple weeks without wondering how my apartment burned down or why the cat was speaking English. You knowno real surprises. Well, then I got home from work yesterday. I walked into my brand new, beautiful apartment, to find that my little guy Jimbo wasnt in his cage. I tore his home apart looking for him and then noticed that one of the tubes that connect to his cage had become dislodged and fallen to the floor. Jim had escaped. My heart stopped in my chest and I kept thinking Why? WHY is this happening? Jim is the hamster love of my life. He is so smart and kind and gentle. He is also very generous with local charities. Hes the total package really. Upon noticing that he escaped, I prepared myself for the worst. I hadnt been home in a couple of days, so I was positive that he was dead. It was only a matter of finding the body. I lifted up my bed, tore apart my closet, and had a long talk with our cat, Trey. I was sure that if I couldnt find Jims body, Trey would have stashed his corpse somewhere in Kellys bedroom. So I looked there for a while too. Then I just started to get really upset. Tears started to fill my eyes and I realized that Jim was just gone. One day there, next day gone. I lay on my bed with no TV or radio playing and I just thought about where he could be. THEN! I heard his little squeaking. I jumped up and ran over to my dresser. Underneath, I found little Jim cowering in the corner. He was shaking and making peep like sounds. I reached my hand in and he immediately walked into my palm. THANK GOD! I noticed too that he had fashioned some sort of makeshift bed under there. How LONG was he out and running around? Who knows. I cuddled him and loved him for hours before putting him back in his cage. I immediately removed the faulty tube and secured the rest of his cage. No more disappearing acts. Im not going to lose ANOTHER hamster due to my irresponsibility. Now, aside from that, I received a phone call this morning from my friend Mariah. She was EXTREMELY upset and crying. I told her to calm down and to tell me the whole story. Detail by detail. She explained that her girlfriend of 7 months has been cheating on her with like everyone in the city. Not only has she been fucking her ex-boyfriend, but just last week she engaged in a threesome with a friend of hers and a random dude. Um. AIDS anyone? Now, the reason why this is SO fucked up is because Mariah was at the hospital a week ago with some unknown virus. They quarantined both she and her girlfriend and asked them numerous questions about their sexual activity; to gather as much information as possible. Even as that situation became increasingly more intense, Mariahs girlfriend lied straight to the doctors and said that she hadnt been with anyone other than Mariah. Fucking liar. And also, fucking WHAT? Mariah was SO ill! In any case, there is a hunt out for the head of Mariahs EX-girlfriend. It should be easy to track her down, considering that she has fucked everyone in the state of NY. I cant believe this shit. Poor Mariah. And to top it all off, its her birthday today. Lastly, my boss told us this morning, via email, that he will be leaving our office tomorrow and never returning. There is a whole lot of shit going on at my job and this kind of move was expected, but not prepared for at all. There was chaos with everyone running around trying to figure out what to do if he actually does leave. Turns out, he misspoke in his email and hes not leaving after all. AH GEEZ! So much for no surprises, huh? With this kind of shit swirling around my head, I am SO glad to grab my friend Angie and to head upstate to spend time with my Rita at her wedding shower. Calgon? Yeah thats right. Bitch, take me away.

 What do you get when you cross an archer with a gift-wrapper? Well, Ribbon Hood of course! Wasnt I surprised when I woke up this morning to find it snowing outside my bedroom window. UmI thought it was March and that the temperature in NYC on Saturday was 63 degrees. But ok. My parents made their annual We must decorate Joes apartment with brand new furniture trip this weekend. They brought me a new TV stand, a beautiful bookcase, lots of groceries, and many other little trinkets that I needed. My bedroom is now fully furnished and gorgeous. They are so generous with their time and their money. I am very lucky to be a 26 year old kid that still needs his parents to fix up his new pad. I finally feel like the stress of moving is over. Do you know how GOOD that feels? Man, to have two weeks of your life in complete upheavalit makes it SO worth it when all is said and done. I just love my new place. So cute and pretty. Just like me. Cute and pretty. This weekend is the wedding shower for my Siamese twin Rita. I couldnt be more excited. I am taking my friend Angie up for the visit and I expect to see all of my oldest and greatest friends. Its going to be a busy and crazy weekend, but it is SURE to be filled with love and fun. And hopefully with some major card playing. I am SO overdue for that. Also, the actual shower is happening in some sort of hall. Like a room that you rent for big parties. I just LOVE parties that take place in buildings like this. Im so used to going to my friends apartments for parties that being able to go to an outside place is super exciting. I saw some enjoyable movies this weekend. One was The Sweetest Thing with Cameron Diaz. Im not huge on romantic comedies, but this was one was a bit shocking at times and didnt totally bore me to death. And I have to admit that I just love that Christina Applegate. Shes supa good at everything she does. Especially when the babysitter was dead. The only thing that I couldnt figure out was how skinny, tiny Justin gets his little penis inside Amazon Woman Cameron. It took me the whole movie to imagine all their different positions and I still couldnt get a clear picture. Maybe its because his dick needs to be in my butt. Huh. Now THAT makes more sense. I also saw the movie Thirteen . I just love that Holly Hunter. She is supa sexy and talented. The teen girls were pretty good too. Overall I thought that the movie was made out to be more shocking that it really was. I mean, did anyone see Kids or Bully ? Now THOSE are some shocking teen movies. But overall, the story was decent and the acting was pretty good. And I would definitely watch the first scene of the movie over and over. I mean. HIT ME AGAIN. HARDER! Booooooooowaaaaaaaaaahahahahahaha! Yeah, that was fucked up. So one funny thing that happened this weekend My friend Angie rolled a huge blunt and brought it over to my place on Saturday night. My moms eyes grew hugely wide and then she lit it up and smoked it. Seeing her sitting on my bed with her ghetto lips wrapped around a blunt made me pee all over my new rug. It was a sight that I will never forget. Oh momyoure so HARD. Core that is. For some reason I miss my Paulie today. He and I hung out last night, so its not like I havent seen him in a while. But last night he made me laugh so hard and for so long that as soon as I woke up this morning, I wanted nothing more than to spend the day with him. I am literally counting the hours until I get to his place tonight. Its weird that after four years I can still have the same kind of addiction to him as I had when we first got together. Most times I dont feel it as strongly as I do today. But when I doit makes me feel all warm inside. Well, lunch time is around the corner, which means that naptime is around the corner which means that I can get off my lazy ass and do something productive. Sleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep. Till tomorrow!

 Being Lucky Well hello! The chaos is slowly coming to a halt. I can breathe again without my chest hurting. My stomach doesnt feel as though its twisted up in a hundred knots. And my muscles are finally starting to unkink themselves from carrying box after box after box down four flights of stairs. The move was a pain in my ass, but it went smoothly and it is OVER. Who could ask for anything more? The new pad is looking mighty spiff! We are in the midst of organizing and decorating and personally, I am loving every second of it. My parents are coming to visit on Saturday and they are bringing a shit load of new furniture for me. They even agreed to pay for it all as a housewarming gift. They are so generous and wonderful to me all the time. I am so lucky to be their son. If it werent for them, I would be sleeping on shit covered rags in my brand new apartment. Last night I chilled with urlLink Ari for a bit after work. When I had to go home, guess what? I walked! She and I are now neighbors and I can walk home from her apartment! WEIRD. I havent had a neighbor friend since I moved into this city, so its pretty exciting to have one that is such a good friend of mine. My most favorite part about the new apartment? My bedroom. Its very big and spacious and I could roll around naked on the floor all day. If it werent for my squealing hamsters, I would probably get a good nights sleep as well. Gonna have to let those little bastards go in the subway I think. (Just so we are clear, I am not talking about Jim or Poopsie they are my loves) Last night I woke up to find Poopsie brutally murdering one of the other bastard hamsters that lives in his cage. I scolded Pooper and told him to leave the other hammies alone. He looked at me with the cutest eyes I have ever seen. How could I resist? I told him to beat the fuck out of whoever he wants and I will dispose of the body. He owns me. My least favorite part about the new apartment? The fridge. Its like mini size. I mean, its a full fridge with a freezer and stuff, but its tiny size. I tower over it by a good foot. I didnt even know that they made fridges so baby sized. Guess Im going to have to walk on my hands and knees all day to get used to it. Not that Im not on my knees all day to begin with. I mean please! I blow everything I see. But I never swallow. Hork. Th e sexiest part about the new apartment? Well, me. How could you be so ignorant as to even ask? The smelliest part about the new apartment? The litter box for the cat that lives with us. But of course! There are a ton of great looking restaurants in our area and I canna wait to try them all! On our first day in the new pad, urlLink Ari ordered a pizza and soda and had it delivered to our place. I mean, how AMAZING is she? I ate every slice thinking how lucky I am to have a friend like her. We also found another pizza place that serves super thin slices. Its like eating pizza on a cracker except that it tastes like pizza and not crackers. You understand. And you love it. So here we go! A new apartment, a new lease on life, a new chance at starting over. Bring it on baby. Bring. It. On. (its already been BROUGHTEN !)

 And BOOM! Well, I am off to the wedding! I will be back on Monday with a ton of stories to share, Im sure. Have a wonderful weekend everyone! I am sure to have one of the most beautiful and emotional weekends of my life. I cant wait until I see my Rita. Be good!

 Today for Lunch Today for lunch, my friend Angie came up to where I work so that we could spend the hour together. Most days I take a nap during lunch and it has become a time that I look forward to from the moment I wake up. But today I knew that there was to be no nap. I had to shove the sleep back into my body and have some fun with Angina. Once Angie arrived, we went to the local market and got grilled cheese sandwiches. The weather in NYC today is a tad chilly, but otherwise gorgeous. I got a diet coke with my sandwich and Angie got a bottled water and a bag of chips (which were eaten before we even left the store). We smoked a cigarette and walked a block to local Riverside Park. We found a comfortable grassy spot on the lawn overlooking the Hudson River. Luckily there was few to no people at the park today. Once situated, Angie sparked up her joint and we relaxed and smoked it down. My stomach has been bothering me all day; I think mostly because of my anxiety and excitement about this weekend. The J eased up the nausea and we lit up another cigarette to cap off the high. Once baked, we talked about our lives and our friends and our relationships. We discussed the wedding in full detail as she and Kelly will be joining Paul and me on the trip. We just talked and talked with the sun beating down on our faces and the wind blowing a crisp breeze through our hair. Angie immediately housed her grilled cheese sandwich and I nursed my diet coke. I noticed a cop car driving through the park, but at this point we were just about finished smoking. As the cops drove directly in front of us (their necks craning to get a good look at the druggies), Angie stubs the rest of the joint out and opens her bag of pot and puts it inside. I was a bit stunned that she did this in front of the passing patrol car, but with her confidence and my ability to talk through the experience, we gave the cops no reason to bust our asses. About 45 minutes into my lunch hour, the two of us smoked one more cigarette together and discussed her birthday. We all had such an amazing time, regardless of the fact that some lesbians dont know how to handle their booze. I wish every weekend could be as spontaneous and fun as this last one was. We then cleaned up our area and walked out of the park. A block later and I was kissing her on the cheek, saying goodbye. Another successful lunch with Ange. Having lunch with Angie today was so much better than taking a nap. I feel a bit refreshed and my stomach certainly feels calmer. I might even house that grilled cheese now. Its been a beautiful day so far. I can only hope it continues throughout the week.

 Drunken Perspectives If you want another perspective on how the big Lesbian fight of last Friday went down, visit urlLink NYC.TwentySomething ! Kelly wrote about the evening as well and it's interesting to see how another drunk person perceived the fight. Otherwise, go fuck yourself. No one said you HAD to read it. Shit. Some people are so fucking ungrateful.

 The Calm Before the Storm Soooooooooooooooooooosew. My best friend, Rita, is getting married on Saturday! As each day gets closer, the knot of excitement in my stomach gets bigger and tighter. I cant wait to see her and hug her and say goodbye to her single days. Although she has only been engaged for a year, it seems as though she has been engaged for a lifetime. She has been with her fianc for YEARS. Like 80. Its time for her to make the commitment and to start having me some babies. This boy wants to be a Godfather like you wouldnt believe. Rita is going to look so beautiful in her wedding dress. She has the most beautiful red hair. The good kind of red hairnot the transparent/do I even have pubes kind. She asked me a while back if she should wear it up or down and I dont think she ever told me what she finally decided. Either way, Im going to be hanging with her all day on Saturday getting ready for the big moment. I am so happy to be a bridesmaid, its ridiculous. No, I wont be wearing a dress. What did youjust start reading this journal today? This weekend will bring all of my best girls from school together. As has been talked about numerous times in the past, our group consists of 5 girls and a Joe. All 6 (notice how I included myself in that) are gorgeous and all 6 have amazing senses of humor. While that may be the only similarities we all possess, its quite extraordinary that we work so well together. Having the 56B (our little group nickname based on our address in college when we lived together) girls together for any event is sure to be a memory filled, mind blowing good time. Now, in order to go away for this wedding, I have a ton of shit I need to do. I have a theatre meeting tonight. I have to pack tomorrow, have dinner with my friend Mariah, make a ton of phone calls and at some point, eat a bagel. The bagel is more important that it seems upon first reading. Ok, no its not. Paul has rented a car for the trip. At first it was an economy style piece of bullshit. Now, he has upgraded to a convertible Mustang because he feels that that is the only way that Joe and Paul travel. While we were in Florida two years ago, we upgraded to a convertible Mustang and he hasnt gotten the taste of it out of his mouth yet. Whatever makes him happiest. Its been so nice to see how huge his smile has been lately. Hes been so wonderfully cute these days. I couldnt be happier. Last night Paul asked where we were going on vacation this year. He has mentioned it a few times in the last couple of months and I always kind of blow him off. For the last two years I have planned every detail of our trips and on each trip, its been slightly less than good. So this year I told him that if he wants to go anywhere on a trip, he needs to pick a place and plan it. Who knows? Maybe well go and maybe we wont. But if not, Ive already been propositioned by an old flame of mine to go away for a long weekend at some point in July. Heh heh heh. Either way, I gots no money, so it will be a free trip, no matter who I go with. Just have to wait and see on that one. In any case, Ritas wedding is almost here! I think I just blew my load by accident. Now Im going to have to go to the bathroom and clean my ass up. Unfortunate really, since I was planning on wearing these jeans to the wedding. Ah well. Rita will understand. She always does. BESOS! Y ABRAZOS! Y suck my cock.

 That Bitch Made Me Bleed On Myself! Last Friday night was my friend Angies birthday. Kelly, Mariah and I began the night by joining Angies parents for dinner at Carmines in Time Square. I was very nervous going into the dinner based on past experiences with Angies parents. Ive known Angie for years, but have never been allowed at her house or out to big events that her family is throwing for her. Basically, Angies parents used to think that Kelly and I turned Angie gay and got her addicted to pot. Needless to say, as far as I know, you cant MAKE someone gay. Trust me, Ive tried. In any case, Friday was supposed to be the first time that all of us sat down (civilly). I brought Angies mom a bouquet of flowers to break the ice. I think she really appreciated that. We all ate dinner together and talked and talked and talked. I had such an amazing time and by the end of the dinner I truly felt as though I was accepted by Angies family. Its been a long time coming, but it has been worth the wait. After dinner, the four of us (parents went back to their hotel) went over to Angies to open presents and get our drink on! We left around 11pm to go to a bar called Stingy Lulus. The bar was empty save for the crazy ass bartender who made shitty drinks with an attitude. I honestly think she was on massive amounts of drugs, cuz she was a fucking nut case. After depleting all of the fun out of Lulus, we went over to our regular dive hangout The Hole. Since it was Friday night, the bar was full of lesbians. Usually its gay men, but they have one lesbian night just to keep it all fair. Well, we were drinking and dancing and smoking (yes, you can smoke both pot AND cigs in this bar regardless of Bloombergs decision to kill the smokers good time) when all of a sudden, WW3 happened. Paul pulls on my arm and says, We have to go now. I look over and there is a psycho hosebeast lesbian yelling at Paul about how he bumped into her friend. I look over at this friend and notice that she is so fucked up she can barely keep her eyes open. The hosebeast kept screaming at Paul. Now, usually Paul does cause the problem and we get thrown out because of him, but in this case, I saw most of what happened, and Paul was innocent. I turned to the hosebeast and I say, Worry about your drunk ass friend and leave my boyfriend alone. The bitch proceeds to scream and scream about how Paul bumped into her wasted friend. She then walks over to me and I turn around and push her away from us with my shoulder. Next thing I know, she launches her drink right in Pauls face. Now Im fuming. I turn to her and Im like What the FUCK do you think youre doing you ugly bitch?! She starts screaming for us to get booted from the bar. Eventually the bartender comes over and is like Get the fuck out of this bar! Now Im livid. I turn to the hosebeast and I call her a number of things. Ie: Ugly cunt bag, dyke bitch, fat ass. Whatever I could think of to make her as angry as she possibly could be. She then launches her nasty self at me, clawing and scraping at the sky. I scream and call her names while she claws at my face. At one point, she connected with my cheek and I turned to belt her in the face. As I raised my hand to punch her, Kelly swiftly puts her arm around my chest and starts pulling me out of the bar. We are in a group of 8 or 9 people and everyone starts screaming at this bitch as I am being literally thrown from the bar by Kelly. As we get to the door, I look down at my hand and its covered in blood. I turn to Kelly and I say That bitch made me bleed on myself! Kelly sees the blood and freaks out. She pushes me out the door and goes back to pound the girls face in. Unfortunately, security stopped her before she could get to her. We all stand outside waiting for everyone to catch up. Im half laughing, half screaming about how much I hate that stupid girl and how much I love Paul for being the sane one for once. If it werent for my friends, Im sure I would have ended up in jail that night for beating the fuck out of that he-she. I am not a violent person by nature. Im really not. But after Ive been drinking and after some stupid bitch thinks she can get away with whatever she wants, just because shes a girlfuck that. It would have been a huge mistake to hit herhugebut I should have hocked the biggest fucking loogie in her hair. If only my initial anger hadnt clouded my otherwise mean and manipulative mean streak. Dont EVER throw a drink in my boyfriends face. EVER. And dont ever call us names and demean us in a bar that WE are regulars at. Please. Whatever, it was such an ugly situation and Im so glad that its over and behind us. The night ended very well. We all went back to Pauls apartment and had more drinks and fun times, laughing over and over at the bitch that freaked out at the bar. Overall Angie had a great birthday and Im glad I was able to be there for her. I think it will be a while before Paul and I go with her to a lesbian bar again though. Truth be told, lesbians are NASTY to gay men that enter their bar. Paul and I get kicked out of lezzy bars all the time. They hate playing second fiddle to us when were with our beautiful girlfriends. Its easier to remove us from the bar, then to have to watch us hang with someone that they can never get. And its not like we are going to tolerate any of their shit. If you are going to step up to us in a barmake sure you get your shot in while you can. Otherwise WHATEVER. Fucking lesbians. I really gotta get me some gay guy friends. Hanging out with these girls is going to get me killed.

 The Fall of Jerome Please, like this post has anything to do with a guy named Jerome. The title popped into my mind as I was thinking about this entry and I figured I had to use it. Cuz I meanthe fall of Jerome! The other day I was watching the news and they did a story on a five legged calf. Now, this may not seem too strange as we know that nuclear waste can do anything out of the ordinary with just a little prayer and faith. Anyway, there was this five legged calf and the strange part about it is that the fifth leg was casually tossed over the calfs back. It was just relaxing there. A relaxing fifth leg. Immediately I thought that they should have removed that fifth leg cuz it was so lazy, but the farmers didnt do that. They laughed and called the newspapers and said Come here and see the funniest thing. A calf with a lazy fifth leg! And I laughed. In other newsas most everyone knows, I have two sets of hamsters. I have Jimbo, my love, and three other mean and nasty dwarf hamsters. The dwarfs live in the same cage and are constantly bickering over one thing or another. I havent cleaned their cage in three weeks and when I got home yesterday, they looked at me with the saddest, most pleading eyes. Please help us escape our filth! In any case, I went to pick them up, cuz they looked so cute all covered in shit and piss. As I cupped one of them in my hand, the other two snarled and latched their teeth on to my thumb. Two sets of teeth on one thumb. I yelped in pain, dropped the other hamster, and told them to enjoy their poop and pee dinner. You want to bite me? I dont clean you for another day. Here are words that rhyme with shitbag: Titbag Cuntbag Dishrag Saggy tits Bored of that game now. My best friend Rita is getting married next Friday! Yahoooooodle! I get to wear a tux and stay in a hotel and I will be in all the pictures! I might even get my haircut with the rest of the bridesmaids. Paul is going to be my date. It is the first time that we have ever attended a function as gay boyfriends. I am so proud of him for having the courage to go through with it. He has been so supportive lately. I could kiss his face. Oh yeah, I do kiss his face. Kissy face. Kissy face nelson. Rita and I had a very long talk last night about the upcoming event. She is doing pretty well and from what I can tell hasnt gotten a severe case of cold feet. I did tell her, though, that if for any reason she wants to hightail it out of the wedding and drive to Canada to escape, Ill charge up my credit cards and we will slip away! A true best friend always gives you the out. Thats about it for me. Today is my friend Angies birthday. Celebrating with her tonight. Tomorrow night Im supposed to go to a roller skating party, but Im sure that I will bail on that one. I just dont see how its cool to go roller skating at 26. Especially with a bunch of straight people. Now thats just uncomfortable. But then again, if you are a straight guy and you go to a roller skating party, Im not so sure that you are so cool that I would feel like a loser. I dont knowroller skating is for gay babies. Did this post melt your labias? Did it blow your nuts right off the sack? If not, go here: urlLink Royal TIT watching ! Have great weekends everyone! Much much love and sex.

 Rough Week Hi all! Sorry for the lack of posts. Will be back tomorrow with a post so extraordinary that your nuts will be blown off. If you don't have nuts, then understand that your labias will melt from sheer joy! Peace out.

 Baby and Daddy Not Baby Daddy Last night, Paul and I tucked ourselves in bed after the premiere episode of Queer As Folk . We talked for a little while and at about midnight, I drifted off to sleep. At 1am, my little hamster guy, Jim, started running on his wheel. I fed him quite a few vegetables yesterday so I think he had tons of restless energy in his body. He ran on that wheel for hours without reprieve. Finally at 3am, I had enough of his tireless legs and I removed the wheel from his cage. I hate doing that to him, but I surely needed some sleep. I crawled back into bed with Paul and we went back to sleep. Around 4am, I awoke to little feet walking on my face. I immediately sat up thinking that there was a mouse running all over my bed. When I flipped on the light, I saw little Jimbo sitting next to my pillow looking at me. I was like Whaaaaaaaaaaaaa? I immediately woke up Paul and we marveled at how Jim had gotten out of his cage, crawled across the carpet, climbed up my comforter and got into bed with me. Are hamsters that smart? Did he really want to get into bed with me? Was he just lonely? Baby wanted to be with daddy. I kissed him over and over on his little head and put him back into his cage. I noticed that one of the attachment pieces on the top of his cage had come undone. That was how he escaped. I am still in shock that he made the choice to get in bed with me rather than walk out the crack under my door and into the mouth of our housecat, Trey. It is very possible that I would have woken up to see Trey making a meal out of my baby hamster. I have had quite a few scares with this hamster. I need to be MUCH more careful about keeping him in solitary confinement. In other news, the weather is amazing. I had a beautiful weekend with my girls, Kelly and Angie. Then I read some of my new book The Poisonwood Bible (by Barbara Kingsolver) while eating a bagel and sitting by the East River. It was a truly wonderful hour of my life. I watched some movies, made Paul and I a great dinner and did my best to maximize my time off from work. I have a very busy week ahead of me what with theatre rehearsals, birthday dinners, and my parents coming down for brunch. Then the following weekend is Ritas wedding! YAY! Busy busy busy. Enjoy the weather yall! We are SO overdue for some sun.

 What a Difference a Day Makes I woke up this morning feeling much better than I have felt in the last week. I think my body was ready to give up the depression and allow me to move forward in a more positive light. Since finding out last Thursday that my brother was going to be staying in Baghdad for at least a few more months, it has been very difficult to even crack a smile. Ive been so angry and sad and frustrated and worst of all, Ive felt really alone with my feelings. Sure, my friends in NYC are doing whatever they can to get me out of the apartment, but sometimes you just need to wallow in self-pity for awhile. I did that and now I may be able to return to my regularly scheduled program. Its been awhile since something has knocked me on my ass so hard. As someone who deals with (at times) pretty severe depression, I always get nervous that the one thing to push me over the edge will be the thing that keeps me there forever. As long as my brother comes home alive, I dont think we will ever have to confront that one thing. For his first year in military combat, I was pretty confident that my brother would make it through ok. I was the one telling my parents not to get so worked up. I felt the presence of God in my body and he told me that I should just have faith; that it wasnt time for me to lose my brother. When I got the horrible news of his delayed return home last week, I felt all of that built in faith flush out of my system. Most of the tears I shed were based on the fact that I didnt trust in his safety anymore. With much prayer, I have slowly found my way back to the place I was before. My brother may have to stay for a few more months, but he will surely be ok and he will make me even more proud than he has already. That kidserving our country so bravelywow. I couldnt love him more than I already do. And he WILL come home safely and we WILL have a wonderful family reunion when he does. Only a matter of time. See how positive I am being now? SO positive! I have found solace in my hatred of George W. Bush. Not really hatred, but complete lack of interest or understanding in anything he does. Its actually to the point where I burst out laughing in peoples faces when they tell me that they are going to vote for Bush. I mean, the vote is all about personal belief so I dont begrudge them that. But at the same timehave we been living in the same country for the past 3 years? And have you been MY friend during that time? Not sure that you would still be able to vote for Bush after that, but Ill take that as a sign of intelligence on your part. HA! Look at me getting my fire back! God, I feel so much better. Thank you. To all of you that have sent me emails and left comments on my site: your support has not gone unnoticed. Rose, your offer of a phone call is incredibly sweet and open hearted. Thank you. To the restyour sensitivity to me over the last week is something that will stay with me forever. I have some really wonderful people in my life, without which I would have surely lost my mind completely. Here comes Friday!

 Nothing has Changed I wish I could say that I was coming back to this journal refreshed and ready to go. Unfortunately, Im still pretty sad and am having a really tough time breaking out of the rut. I went home this weekend to be with my parents and the visit didnt go as smoothly as I had hoped. There were a lot of tears and my dad and I got into a couple screaming matches on Friday night. Im still kind of reeling from that whole experience. The stress that my family is under right now is almost impossible to describe, yet feels all consuming. My brother is not doing well at all. Its too hard to get into it any further. I feel really lonely and like no one understands. I feel disconnected from some of my friends and I cant seem to find any sort of joy in either their lives or my own. I feel completely defeated. I dont care about the bullshit that was plaguing me before. I could care less about my acting, my life in NYC, or anything else that used to make me happy. I know that this will pass. But it hasnt yet and my nerves are shot. The only thing I do know is that I hate Bush and I hate this war and I feel like I live in a country that is based on false democracy. The system doesnt seem to work, so why do I try to be such a big part of it? Eventually I will get my fire back, but for now, there isnt much else I can say. Ive been beaten down and its really hard to get back up and fight the good fight.

 Sadness Last night, as Paul and I were putting on our jackets to go to the grocery store, my phone rang and my dad left a message on our answering machine: Joe, this is your father. I have a question I need you to ask your brother when he calls you tomorrow. Its incredibly important. My jaw immediately clenched shut as I thought about what my dad was going to say. I was so shocked by the message that I told Paul that I didnt want to call him back, at least not until after we went grocery shopping. We finished getting ready and stepped out the front door. As we walked to the store, Paul handed me the phone and before I could resist any further, he dialed the number to my home. My dad answered immediately and we had the following conversation: Dad: I have some potentially bad news. Me: Oh no, what is it? Dad: There is a high chance that Winfield will not be coming home for his May visit. There has been an uprising in Baghdad that has caused leave cancellation for many different military personnel. Me: You mean, hes not coming home anymore? Dad: Its very possible. (choking on sobs) Winfield told us that he will call you tomorrow. He will not be able to tell you details, but you need to ask him one question for us. Have the plans changed? Me: I dont understand. Hes just not coming home now? Dad: That seems to be the case, but we wont know for sure until he calls you tomorrow. Me: (shocked) Ok. I will ask him that question when he calls. Dad: (crying hard) Thanks Joe. Call me as soon as you know. Please. Me: I will. I hung up the phone and stood in the middle of the street for a minute. I felt as though my world totally caved in out of nowhere. Paul was waiting for me on the corner and he asked what was wrong. I told him what my dad said and he offered to go sit somewhere to discuss it. I refused and told him that we should continue on with our night as best as we could. We began walking around the grocery store and when we ended up in the bread isle, I lost it. The sobs came hard and fast and I felt as though I was going to pass out. Paul immediately wrapped his arms around me in the store and we both stood there and cried for a couple of minutes; neither of us saying anything. Just hugging and crying. Eventually we got ourselves together and finished our shopping. This morning I woke up at 4am with a pit in my stomach. I laid there for hours thinking about my brother and how upset he must be. I didnt know how I could go to work. I wanted nothing more than to stay home and stare at the wall. I felt horribly depressed. When I got to work, my dad called and told me that Winfield had called him at home this morning to tell him that he is definitely not coming home in May. His tour of duty has been extended for at least another 6 months. He will be leaving Baghdad as scheduled and will go on a field mission for a while. As far as I know, he will be unable to contact us during this time. (For the news story relating to this post, urlLink click here .) My brother has been in Iraq for 13 months. I have not seen nor hugged him in over a year. Now it seems as though I wont be able to share these moments with him for quite a bit longer. We had planned his entire visit, reserved hotel rooms, bought theatre tickets, and put our hearts into it. Now, its just not happening. Theres not much else I can say about it except that I feel as though my heart has completely broken. My parents have left work and are sitting at home right now bawling their eyes out. I am supposed to go home tomorrow to be with them for Easter. It is sure to be a miserable trip. I am not angry at the military right now, nor am I angry at anyone. I just feel defeated. As I said to my mom this morning There is only so much one family can take. And now we continue on as we did before

 On a Mini-Break Due to the wonderful world of Judaism, I am leaving work in about 10 minutes, not to return until Thursday morning. Passover of my LOVE! This weekend rocked on a million levels and I feel pretty wiped out. I have a ton of shit to do this week, so this time off couldn't have come at a better...well...time. Too much fun makes Joe unable to type a coherent post. I hope everyone has a great week! Try no to miss me too much, k? Cuz I will be sitting at home, masturbating to every inch of your body. I'll make sure to clean up the spooge. Promise. PEACE OUT!

 Free Thought on a Friday I was sitting here staring at the computer for a solid ten minutes, with complete writers block, when I decided to do a quick and concise entry in the high school style of free thought. I dont really know what I want to write about, so I thought it might be fun to spend five minutes writing only about the different things that float in and out of my mind. Hence, wellfree thought. Today my teeth feel funny. I dont know why. Maybe Im still reeling from that nasty nap dream I had yesterday. Either way, part of me wants to punch my own teeth in so that they stop irritating the fuck out of me. Last night I sat around and watched all of my programs. Survivor was the fucking best! Im telling you, if you dont watch this show, you dont know whatcher missing. Rob and Amber? Mmmm.Rob. and Amber. The Apprentice was great as well and I muchly enjoyed seeing that tool bag fake ass southern boy Troy get the boot. His accent is like nails on a chalkboard and his hair could definitely use a different kind of gel. Every time he comes on the TV screen, his spikes poke me in my beautiful browns. ER sucked a dick, but I had to watch it based on years of commitment. Next week may be good though as Carrie Weaver can do no wrong in my eyes. If the episode is about her, then I will sit there in silence and pay attention to every line. I love her and her crippled leg. I had eggs and a hash brown for breakfast. It took me 2 minutes and 38 seconds to shove it down my gullet. It wasnt the best breakfast I have ever had. But then again, the best breakfast I ever had was at Bobbebbins and it was a cheeseburger. SO! A friend of mine from college did my taxes the other night. He was going to do them for free since I offered to reward him with some of the pot. I was really nervous that I was going to owe a shit load of money this year. Last year I had to pay the IRS over $800. However, since I have been putting so much into my retirement package, my taxes are CHEAP this year. In total, I owe the Federal $36 and the State $48. Rock out. Ill take it with a smile. My tax friend offered me a bunch of deduction options to lower the payments and even receive a refund, but I opted out. I didnt want to do anything that I felt could be illegal. But paying my tax guy in pot surely isnt illegal. You understand the difference. Also, while I was on the phone with my tax friend, we had this conversation: Me: Can I ask you a personal question? Tax Friend: Sure. Go ahead. Me: Its a pretty bold question, are you sure you dont mind? Tax Friend: Not at all. What is it? Me: Are you gay? I mean, I know its a blunt question, but something was telling me that you are gay and I just had to ask. Tax Friend: HAHAHAHAHA. Joe, you are too much. Yes, Im gay. How did you figure it out? Me: Let me just say, I have my ways. Truth is, I knew when I ran into him a couple months back that he could be gay. I can always tell if a guy is gay or straight by the way they interact with me. I am a very accessible gay man and sometimes even the straight boys have been known to do a little flirting with me. All in all I was pretty impressed that I figured out the sexual orientation of my tax friend. Wowmy free thought theory has actually been a bit more organized than I imagined it to be. My typos have been few and far between. Im becoming quite a professional secretary, arent I? I remember when I was little, I actually WANTED to be a secretary when I grew up. I thought it would be fun to answer the phone and to take messages. I should really be thankful. Cuz if I think about it, my dream has come true. Not everyone can say that. I wanted to be a secretary and now I am. Thank God I dont have any loftier goals. Alrightpeace out shelly. Hope everyone has a safe and CRAZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZY weekend! I hope to! BOOCHES!

 (Big Breath) FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK! Ever have one of those days when you want to punch someone in the face? On top of being in a generally bad mood today, I was extremely happy to find out that Paul left my apartment after Kelly this morning and because he doesnt have a set of my new house keys, the door was left unlocked for the day. Kelly assured me that everything would be ok and if it wasnt for her, I might have cabbed it down to the East Village to scratch Pauls eyes out. Just one of those days Anywaylast night I had the pleasure of watching urlLink Extreme Makeover . The episode focused on an engaged couple who was having a complete physical overhaul. The got facial reconstruction, tummy tucks, liposuction, and even new porcelain veneers. They didnt see each others new looks until they met at the altar at their wedding. It was highly interesting to watch, although I tend to squirm during the operation scenes. I mean, can you NOT take a chisel to someones nasal bones on national TV please? Paul ended up arriving at my house at 10pm. He had to cater a party at a restaurant near my apartment so he came over after he was finished. He was fucking wasted and he irritated me almost the entire time. I hate when he drinks. He acts like such a fucking tool bag. He grabs at me and says obnoxious shit. His face takes on this different lookhis wasted look and it makes me INCREDIBLY uncomfortable. Needless to say, hanging out with him last night did not do anything to solve the problems that we are having in our relationship. In fact, I went to bed wanting nothing more than to be sleeping alone. Whateverits hard to explain and no one seems to understand, so lets just move on. (can you tell that Im just NOT in the mood today?) When I was taking my nap at lunch, I had a really bad 30 second dream. In the dream I was looking in the mirror when all of a sudden my front teeth started to vibrate painfully until they vibrated so much that a chunk of my front tooth cracked out of my mouth and fell into my hand. There was a stream of blood that followed. I immediately woke up after it happened and lay on my back rubbing my teeth with my fingers. Today sucks, even dream wise. In other news, I am very much looking forward to watching The Apprentice and ER tonight. If that doesnt cheer me up, I dont know what will. I will be especially annoyed if my boy Nicholas gets fired tonight. Its hard to fall in love with someone, only to find out that they are a failure. hahahahaha sike. Ok, not so sike. I dont know if I mentioned it earlier, but my brother did in fact receive the Bronze Star for his work in Iraq! 750 soldiers were nominated and 12 received the award in a ceremony last week. My brother was one of these proud 12. My family couldnt be more in awe of him than we already are. He is such a superstar and so brave. I cant believe the greatness that has come out of him. Its really something else. I continue to sit here in NYC wallowing my life away with unimportant bullshit. Im not at all comparing my activities with those of my brother, but I would be lying if I said it didnt cross my mind a lot. A lot. Anyways, one more hour and I can escape my job and do something with myself. I need a change of environment, I think. Maybe that will cheer me up a bit. Go outside, smoke a butt, fuck a hot guy, and punch a beggar in the face. There really is no better way to spend a rainy Thursday evening.

 Going Home Bye everyone! Im going home this weekend to be with my parents and to see Kelly's parents renew their wedding vows. It will be tons of fun (!) and there are free drinks! I mean, who could ask for anything more? Not me! Have fun weekends! I surely will. LOVE LOVE LOVE YOU!

 Today Today I went to a staff lunch. We do this lunch thing about once a year and it is always a super boring event. This time however, I managed to drink 3 glasses of wine during the lunch and ended up walking out in a much better mood than I would have otherwise. Unfortunately, Ari and I had HIGH hopes to go home after our lunch event, but we were forced to come back to work for the last hour of the work day. We were MIGHTY pissed at that. But I realized that drinking wine during a work shift makes me a happier boy than usual. Ari is ready to kill someone right now. Time for me to shove some love down her throat before she puts my boss in a headlock. Thats all I have to say today. Super interesting post, right? I know! I am almost cumming in my pants from the sheer excitement of typing it. ADIOS MOTHAFUCKA!

 Yes, I Am Still Living Let me just say that this website is just about the biggest thorn in my side. It looks like diarrhea and I dont have the time or the energy to fix the detailssuch as the links and recent posts sections. So basically, I struggle and I struggle and I keep on keeping on. (okay, get a life Joe. Its a fucking blogger, not a Pulitzer Prize winning venture. Ok, yeah it is.) My hair is wicked out of control today. So, today when I came into work, I found a forward in my inbox asking me to check out what the Human Rights Campaign has accomplished in their efforts to get Massachusetts lawmakers to allow gay marriages. I quickly jumped to the site and saw some of the most beautiful pictures I have ever seen. In front of my eyes were gay people getting married; lesbian couples, young and old, gay males, young and old. It made my heart burst with excitement and joy. May 17th will be remembered as the day when gay people all over the nation came together for a small, yet significant victory. It just takes one to cause change. Thank you to Massachusetts for being that one. I needed this uplifting moment to combat the other moment I experienced on my way to work today. There was a poll in yesterdays AMNew York that asked Do you think that gay people should be allowed to get married? That was it. No fluff, no need for details. Just Do you think that gay people should be allowed to get married? All last night I kept thinking to myself I wonder how the people of New York will answer this poll. Now, I understand that its a stupid little poll done by a free daily newspaper, but I was very curious to see how the open-minded world of NYC feels about gays being allowed to get married. (Now understand that I use the word allowed which makes me unbelievably nauseous as I type this I mean, I dont remember having to allow straight people to get marriedbut then again Im inferior, I forgot) As soon as I woke up today I thought, I wonder how the poll will turn out. When I finally got my hands on the paper, I noticed that the poll wasnt in its usual spot on the front cover. I desperately tore through the publication trying to find the stupid little quiz that had me up during the night thinking about it. Finally, I found it tucked away at the bottom of the page. 60% of people in NYC believe that gay people should NOT have the right to get married. HURL. I was immediately crushed. I realize that I live in a fantasy bubble of a world since NYC is one of the few places where everyone has a chance regardless of race, religious beliefs, sexual preference, or the fact that you are an incredibly ridiculous weirdo. But obviously this is not true. The MAN will keep you down for as long as he can. In my heart of gay hearts, I hope that the PEOPLE will band together on this issue. I dont think that all straight people have to agree on this controversial topic, but I do think that if you disagree, stay out of it. Dont make my life worse because you have a belief on something that you will never ever understand. Its like me telling a woman that she cant have an abortion. I dont particularly believe in abortion as I do think its murder. However, will you see me EVER vote against a Pro-Choice bill? Never. Its not my issue and how dare I make that decision when Ill never carry a baby in my womb? I think it makes logical sense. For all of you straight supporters out there, thank you. Without your voices on this topic, the issue would go nowhere. Its strange how straight people are the only voices of reason in this whole case. Gay people speak out and its like Dont listen to him! He already HAS the disease. Lets hear from someone who is more objective! How about you Bobby McNeverHadaDickinhisMouth? YOU tell us whats its like being a gay man in 2004. Case in point. So there was an up to my day and also there was a down. If you would like to sign a nationwide guest book congratulating all of the new gay couples that were just married, go urlLink HERE .! If this topic irks you and you disagree with everything Ive just said, Shhh. Its about time we didnt hear any more from you.

 POST HAS BEEN PULLED

 End of the Week Tidbits I had the weirdest dream last night. I was hanging with some friends at a party when all of a sudden I had to take a huge dump. I went in to the bathroom, pulled down my jeans and sat on the can. I squeezed and squeezed, but couldnt get any of the shit out. As I pushed harder and harder, I actually felt like I had to go more. Eventually I got so frustrated with pushing that I got up and went back to the party. Shortly after that I woke up and discovered that I was covered in my own shit. It was random and kind of erotic. Ok SIKE. I did not wake up to find my body covered in my own shit. And if I did, do you REALLY think that I would find that erotic? Ok, some people do, but definitely not me. I have my own fetishes and they do not revolve around feces. They revolve around vomit. If you have met me in person, you know that I have a very spiky style haircut. Well, last week, Im sitting on the subway, listening to my headphones, minding my own lame business, when this big black woman walks by me and pushes down my spikes. Im like huh? She continues to walk out of the subway and doesnt look back. I guess it was funny that she patted me on the head, but it was also strange and made me feel a tad ridiculous. Luckily, I use so much pomade in my hair that it will take her weeks to get it off of her hand. Last night I went to happy hour with Paul and Kelly. It was a super good time. Paul wasnt in a great mood when we got together, but he ended up pulling out of it and I think he totally enjoyed himself. After a few chocolate martinis, we got into a cab and jetted back to my apartment. Once there, Kelly and Paul whipped up a feast of barbeque chicken and asparagus. Angie came over shortly after dinner was made and we all hung out at my new kitchen table for awhile. We smoked some fatty joints and drank some beers and then it was game time. Guess what we played? Wellit was GUESS WHO! Have you played urlLink Guess Who? before? Its a super easy, super fun game that revolves around figuring out the other persons character based on questions that are asked. Most people ask questions like Is your person a male? Or does your person have a bald head? When WE play together, we ask questions like Is your person a young pedophile or an old pedophile? I distinctly remember Angie asking Kelly if her character needed some more rouge for their face. After dying laughing, Kelly said no. After our game playing, I threw Pauls wasted ass in bed and watched the finale of ER . I kept saying that I wanted Ming Na to die in last nights episode. Fortunately, there was a huge cliff hanger that she was involved in, so hopefully she will bite it in the first episode next year. Its not that I have anything personal against her. I just think shes a crap actress that takes up too much screen time you knownothing personal. Bring on more of the Abby and the Sam! For a long time, I wasnt a huge fan of Abbys character, but she has since grown on me tremendously. I cant wait for her to finally be a doctor next season! ROCK! I guess thats it. I hope everyone has a super really great awesome super weekend. Do something fun and hug someone you love. Be back here on Monday! Peace.

 My Brother Was Supposed to Come Home Today Ive been dreading this day for weeks. It could have been such an exciting couple of days for me, but instead, Im doing my best to pretend as though Winfield was scheduled to stay in Iraq all along. I had a very long talk with him yesterday that resulted in 30 minutes of sobbing. It was not the way I wanted to end my day. Winfield is carrying a lot of anger with him these days. He is furious with the ARMY for extending his leave. He is furious with the soldiers who tortured the Iraqi prisoners. He is at his wits end and he is looking to take out this frustration and anger on anyone who crosses his path. I tried (as best as I could) to diffuse his fury bomb, but there wasnt much I could do. Eventually I just cried and cried and cried. The two of us decided that there are two positives that we can look forward to amidst all of this negative. 1) Winfield is, without a doubt, leaving the service next May. His time is done. He has served his country, succeeding in ways that we never thought possible. He no longer agrees with what the military is doing and he wants no part of it. He is exhausted and needs a break. As he said to me yesterday His life has been on hold for far too long. Its time to pick up where he left off over 3 years ago. 2) Each day of hell is one day closer to heaven. We are (VERY tentatively) planning his homecoming for early August. My family is very cautious about getting any sort of hopes up, since last time it took us weeks to get over the disappointment. In fact, none of us are fully over that disappointment yet. Its like an aching that never goes away. As we got off the phone, my eyes completely swollen, Winfield said I miss you so much Joe. You are my best friend and I know well pick up where we left off. I choked on my last remaining tears and told him to Be safe and to call soon. After that conversation I wanted nothing, but to leave work. I stuck it out for about an hour more and took off as soon as I could get the chance. What these soldiers do on a daily basis is something that I will never understand, although it consumes my thoughts throughout each day. I wish I had the bravery that these men possess. For the rest of my life I will live with the highest respect for our military and the families and friends that are left behind. Its an experience that changes lives forever.

 So, I got so frustrated with my fucked up blogger, that I decided to pick a new template and hope that it solved my problems. Well it did, kind of. I've lost my links now and the page looks like a literal piece of dog shit, but at least it's not listing the posts backwards anymore. It was driving me up the fucking wall. Sorry that the links are gone...I will put them back someday. Just not today. Or tomorrow, or maybe ever. haha. Some day. I've had enough of Blogger for today. And for tomorrow, and maybe forever. Sike! Just trying to accept my new dogshit template.

 help me before I develop a vagina and cellulite! Im super tired today. I have no idea why. I surely slept 8 hours last night as well as 12 hours the night before. I should be so rested, its ridiculous. But after eating my lunch (consisting of the mandatory two slices of pizza), I crashed hard on my way back to work. Im sitting here yawning as though I could fall over from sheer exhaustion. Lets seepretty uneventful weekend overall. Did a great deal of writing on the script that we are developing for our next theatre production. Watched a ton of movies, including Ruthless People , The Order , Spy Kids 2 (it really wasnt as bad as it seems), and It Runs in the Family , which is the sequel to A Christmas Story . I didnt know there was a sequel either! It was pretty good too. Nothing to freak out about, but definitely a must see if you are into that whole Ralphie and his Red Rider BB gun, thing. I also jerked off 4 times in the matter of 36 hours, but whos counting, really. Last nights Survivor finale was truly the highlight of all of my weekend adventures. It was three hours of non-stop joy for this Joe CuttheShit. Congrats Amber(!), although I totally wanted my boy, Rob Mariano, to take away the title. Ah wellthats what you get for falling in love, eh Rob? And did that boy look GOOD last night, or twat? In other news, I am slowly becoming a magazine whore. I cant stop buying People , US Weekly , and In Touch magazine. I am fastly turning into a full blown woman. Someone help! Is it wrong that after work I am going to go immediately over to Pauls, climb in to bed, turn on the 2 hour presentation of The Swan and call it a night? Ah shitI am FASTLY turning into a woman. Someone hand me the bon bons and do my nails. I prefer bright red or pink to match my pumps. Ever feel like you were going to cry for no reason? All of a sudden I think I just caught a sob in my throat. I swallowed it down and sat here a little stunned. What do I have to cry about? Get a hold of yourself, you menstruating asshole! I may need to go now. Its quite possible that the more I type, the more my feminine side takes over. At this point, Im craving long bubble baths and nights curled up on the phone, chatting with my closest girlfriends. Anyone up for a movie on Lifetime? Ill make the popcorn and meet you on the couch with a box of Kleenex.

 A Friend ly Retraction on a Fabulous Friday Well, my bad mood has passed, so now I can be totally honest when I say that I LOVED Friends last night! I was being a bitch yesterday and I didnt give the show the absolute credit it deserves. As the clip show aired, I started to get all sentimental. Monica, Joey, Phoebe, Rachel, Ross, Chandlerdammit Im REALLY gonna miss those friends of ours. In my opinion, the finale was done in perfect Friends tradition. There was the suspense of Ross and Rachel, the storyline filler of Joey and Chandlers breaking the fooz ball table, and the crazy Phoebe acting out in ridiculous ways to provide ultimate comic relief. As the show drew closer to 10pm, I felt really sad inside. If you were in front of your television last night watching this finale, you were a part of history in the making. When I woke up this morning, my first thought was Friends is truly over now. No matter how you feel about the show itself, its now off the air. An era, as we know it, has been completed. Unless you were in Cancun celebrating your honeymoon, last nights viewing is something that you will remember for the rest of your life. Where were YOU during the last episode of Friends ? In other news, my generous friend, Kelly, bought me the new urlLink Nelly Furtado CD, Folklore . I cant explain to you how fucking awesome it is. That girl is a musical genius. If you dont have it already, and you enjoyed the first album she put out, go and get the new one. Its much different, but totally top notch. I am big into most kinds of music as it is, but its very rare that I get a CD thats as exceptional as this one is. I mean One Trick Pony is where its at! So glad its Friday! Im muchly looking forward to going out in the city tonight for a raging good time. No lesbian bars thoughId prefer to go home in one piece. I have a lot of writing to do this weekend as well as sleep to catch up on. Also, if I go another weekend without seeing Kill Bill , Im going to cut my dick off. Ive been dying to see it for years and years and I never get the opportunity. Well, that all changes this weekend! Billhere I cum! That should be it for me! I hope everyone has a fun filled and relaxing weekend. I plan on lying around naked for longer than is necessary. And I plan to finger my cunt feverishly. Or at least until it bleeds! Love and hugs and kisses and slaps in the face! Peace out.

 Friend ly Irritation So funny. Ive been in the best mood all day. Then, I laid down for my daily nap and woke up in an irritated mood. Maybe its because the security guard in our building was screaming like a fucking banshee throughout the entire hour. Or maybe its cuz I was just not in the mood to sit back at my desk after the morning was a full bodied beastmaster. In either case, FUCK! I gotta shake this mood before I leave here. My job is not important enough for me to take any of the attitude home with me. Seriously now. Tonight is the Friends finale. Big news, eh? I mean, its all over the newspapers and television channels. Im super sad its going to be over and I just love those Friends characters to death, but enough already! How many goodbye specials do I have to endure? Oh yeah, thats right. Only one more! In a way, Im pretty excited that Friends will be finished. Its always exciting to me when the Television gets a programming overhaul. Some of the biggest shows of the decade are ending for good. Well, that is, if you really CARED that Frasier was going off the air. I thought those old farts kicked the bucket years ago, but I was wrong. Niles and Daphne and whoever else bores me to death will be finishing their run next week. Tune in and get your last dose of free sleeping pills! Gathering with some of my OWN friends tonight to watch the finale. It should be pretty low key and that is fine by me. I am going to cuddle up with a bottle of wine and sip away as Ross and Rachel fuck each other, yet dont actually get together, for the last time. Im also going to die laughing when Monica pretends to not have a baby in her OWN stomach as she pulls the baby out of Anna Fariss vagina. PRETTY hilarious. And Joeyyeah wellam I the only person in America who is confident that his break out show next fall will bomb miserably? I have the best wishes for him, but he was always my LEAST favorite character on the show. Does this mean that Im going to have to watch him be a stupid ass for a FULL half an hour next year? And what is this with Brad and Jen breaking up? Can they NOT? I guess there is no such thing as beauty queens finding true love in each other. Paul just called me to tell me that he has to work tonight and will not be hanging with us during the finale. This sucks because now I will be chilling out with the recently broken up/taking it slower Kelly and Jen. Thats ok, but when you combine it with Mariah and her slutty ex-girlfriend (who I do NOT speak to) as my only other compadres, it makes for a shady evening. I told myself that if Paul bailed, I would go home and chill at my apartment alone. But I will probably suck it up and go to the finale thing anyway. FUCK! I really wanted him to be there tonight. I guess thats it. So much for improving my mood. Im going to go punch my boss in the dick and nuts. If anything, THAT should bring a smile to my face. ENJOY your Friends filled evening.

 Dental DAMN! I was up at 7am this morning with my palms sweating and my heart beating out of my chest. I had been dreading my 10:30am dentist appointment since I made it. As the days grew closer, the pit in my stomach got deeper and my nerves began to fray. More than anything in the world, I am most terrified of going to the dentist. When I showed up for my appointment, the receptionist (Nelly) could see the look of fear on my face. She asked if I was ok and if I wanted a drink of water. I told her that I was just a bit nervous, but that I would be ok. I sat down and stared at the wall. Eventually, Nelly got up from around her desk and came out into the waiting room. She offered me a magazine and reassured me that the appointment wouldnt be as bad as I was anticipating. I truly felt comforted by her. I was called in for my appointment and I really felt as though I was going to vomit on the floor. I took my seat in the chair and the dental hygienist (Anita) came in to talk to me about the cleaning. I explained that I havent been to a dentist in over two years because of my overwhelming fear. She told me that that was common and that she would do whatever was in her power to make the visit as painless as possible. I did my best to relax as she took a full set of X-rays and began picking away at the tartar buildup. Anita was extremely kind and talked to me throughout the process. She said that there was an incredible amount of tartar buildup underneath my gums. She picked at that shit for a half an hour as I squirmed in my seat. Even with her being as gentle as possible, there were still moments of agony. Finally we moved on to the cleaning and then it was over! The actual dentist came in then and I was surprised to see that he was incredibly hot. He is very young and dressed well and I loved looking in to his eyes as he consulted me on the proper brushing etiquette. He showed me my X-rays and told me that my teeth are in excellent condition. I dont have any cavities and they are strong and healthy. Unfortunately, my gums are showing the beginning signs of subdermal gingivitis. The dentist explained to me that I would have to come in at the end of the month for a periodontal scraping. He described this procedure as a deep cleaning of the area underneath my gums. SICK! They are going to give me some Novocain type cream and then dig below the surface. The idea of it is enough to make me pass out, but when I talked to my mom she explained the procedure to me and it doesnt sound too complicated. After I was finished, I hugged Anita and proceeded to check out with Nelly. We made our next appointment and I was pleased to find out that I didnt even have to pay a co-pay fee. It was all covered by my insurance. Thank the Lord! As we know, going to the dentist doesnt only hurt your mouth, it hurts your wallet. I walked out of the office on cloud 9. Not only do I have teeth in good condition, the appointment is over! I dont have to deal with this again for at least another couple of monthswell except for that dreaded gum scraping thing. Blech. I prayed so hard that this appointment would go well and it surely did. If you ever think you have a problem that is too small for God, you are wrong. He is there with you; even when its for something as minute as having a bi-annual cleaning! Now I can eat my pizza in peace.

 THE Wedding of 2004 Wellity, wellityI am back from the wedding with about a hundred wonderful memories! The whole weekend was nothing short of amazing. In fact, it went much more smoothly than I had anticipated. Rita had put a LOT of work into the planning of her day, but there is always the fear that something will go incredibly wrong and send the whole wedding spiraling into mass confusion. Fortunately, there were NO scares, at least from what I noticed. Just people dancing and laughing and hugging and having an overall top notch good time. I showed up at the wedding rehearsal just in time on Friday. I had gone tanning the day before and my face and body was noticeably scorched. Paul rented a fire red convertible Mustang for the drive up, so needless to say, driving with the top down for hours left my face as red as a just ripe tomato. At the rehearsal, I met the other groomsman and reconnected with my wonderful ladies from college. The church was beautiful, and Rita looked like she was glowing with pure excitement and joy. No hitches at the rehearsal and off we went to an amazing sit down rehearsal dinner. We drank wine and vodka tonics and talked our faces off for a couple of hours. Upon returning to the hotel, it was much of the same, except for the half an hour Rita and I got to spend just the two of us. I gave her my special gift and we hugged for about 20 minutes straight. On Saturday, I had Paul drive me over to the mall so that I could get my tuxedo. My best girls (and also bridesmaids) from school decided to pull out their selfish bitch natures and refused to drive me to the mall themselves. Unfortunately, I missed out on Rita getting her hair done, but I did get to help her in to her wedding dress right before the ceremony. Her sister was there as well and the three of us made sure that she was the most beautiful bride to ever walk down the aisle. The ceremony itself was an emotional rollercoaster. There were many tears and I found myself chewing on my trembling lower lip for most of it. Staring at Rita in her contemporary, yet elegant wedding dress, standing before her unbelievably handsome fianc gave me feelings of joy and sadness that could only be summed up as intense. Their vows were part sentimental/part hilarious and when they looked in to each others eyes and said I do, the entire crowd swelled with emotion. The photographer took just about 2 hours of pictures. I am dying to see them! I have been told that Ritas mom will be sending us a copy of all of them via email, so I am anxiously waiting for them to come through. I think I looked good in my tux, although I felt like the jacket and vest they prepared for me was a tad too big. Makes sense, since the combined weight of the 6 groomsman had to be over 1500 pounds. You should have seen me standing next to all of the other guys. I looked like I was a 6 year old waif. The reception was one of the best times I have ever had in my life. The food was good, but was only eaten for about 10 minutes. As soon as the DJ started playing music, the dance floor filled up and didnt empty until the event shut down at midnight. Unbelievably, it was open bar until the last hour. We were all shocked by that one. The amount of money to keep an open bar for 4 hours is extraordinary. Rita knows how to throw a bash, thats for sure. Ritas selection of music for the night was just about flawless. Of course you had your classics, but she made sure to throw in some Justin Timberlake and Humpty Dance as well. I was able to make some new friends on the dance floor and I also had some very memorable slow dances with some of Ritas family. The whole night was just perfect. When we got back to the hotel, everyone got changed and met in the lobby for a few more drinks. I wiped out around 1am and went back to my hotel room to hang with Paul and the girls. I have to say, Paul was absolutely incredible through the entire trip. He barely drank any alcohol, yet managed to make idle conversation and keep a smile on his face throughout the evening. When I would look over at him, my heart pumped with feelings of love and respect. He was, without a doubt, the most handsome guy at the wedding, wearing his expensive suit and Versace tie. Saying goodbye to Rita on Sunday was a bit difficult to do. I was just about out of tears at that point, but I did make sure to hug her as long as I could. She is no longer just my Rita. She is now married and I will forever have to share her with her new husband. I couldnt ask for a better guy to share such an incredible girl with. He was so sweet and kind to me throughout the weekend and I truly believe that their wedding and relationship is blessed by God. There arent two people who are more right for each other. Rita is now in Cancun on her honeymoon. I hope she remembers to brush her teeth with bottled water. Otherwise, shes going to have runny poops all week! I am muchly looking forward to seeing her again in a couple of weeks. Now that shes married and all There have been few weekends in my life that have been filled with so much joy and love. I still get choked up thinking about it. I wish I could repeat it every weekend for the rest of my life. Or at least every weekend until I get married. I love you Rita! This is just the beginning. I am so proud of you for taking this step and I am here for you every day for the rest of your life. Can you have a baby now that I can love and keep as my own?

 GAH! Work is so crazy today! I haven't had a free second to do anything, much less play around and write in my journal. The wedding was incredible. I couldn't have asked for a more wonderful time. I have so many things to share about it and will do so tomorrow. Until then, wish me luck in getting through the rest of my unbelievably hellish day. SMOOCHES!

 The Things I Need to Tell You Over the last couple of days, I have dealt with quite a few crazy things. In no particular order, here is my summary of events: Lust I have been completely insatiable when it comes to my lust factor these days. I am jerking my bean pole at least 2 times a day. Often, its up in the range of 3 or 4 times a dizzle. I cant stop thinking about muscle men and how crazy horny they make me. I find myself whacking off in the strangest of places. Work, definitely. Home, of course. On Pauls couch, while hes sleeping. In Pauls bed while he is making dinner. On the floor in my bathroom in Albany. In the den of my house in Albany. Pretty much, anywhere I can take it out and whack it off, I will surely do so. Summer gets to me. Seeing all those bulging biceps stretching the sleeves of those manly t-shirts. OMG. I have to jerk right now. Omg. OMG. OMG! UH UH UH UH Oh NO. OH YES! OH OH OH OH OH. HANGING TOUGH! OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHyeaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Now Im covered in cum. great. Love Ive been so naturally happy these days. Most likely cuz of my impending birthday celebration this weekend. Ive been running myself into the ground by trying to attend every event thats happened over the last month. So far, the only get together I havent been able to attend was my friend, Staceys, bacherlorette party this weekend. I was pretty disappointed that I wasnt able to see my Rita this weekend, but I just couldnt make it out of the house. I woke up on Saturday and felt so burned out and like trashI had to stay home. But once I got my sleep on, I woke up totally in love with everyone I know. There isnt one person in my life that Im currently angry at or upset with. Im just coasting on good fumes and loving every second of it. Paul and I are doing incredibly well and Im excited to see what he has planned for my birthday on Friday. I just love everything and everyone right now. Its a very wonderful feeling that only comes around once in a while. Hate Of course, I cant totally lie and say that there isnt anything that I hate. Whats a life without some hatred in it? Pretty damn boring if you tell me. Be warned, when discussing hate, I never hold back. So here is who I hate and why I hate them, in no particular hating order: 1) The entire cast of Outback Jack . TBSfuck you. JustFUCKyou. 2) Avril Lavigne. If you dont choke on your smarm soon, Im going to wrap my girlie hands around your skinny neck and squeeze the fake coolness right out of your ugly Canadian face. 3) Ashlee Simpson. Please stop singing. You CANT and its hurting my ears. They are bleedy from you singy. 4) The entire staff at the University Food Market on the Upper West Side of NYC. You bitches are so rude to me and youre all 18 with latina babies in your stomach. Its not my fault that you got knocked up and have no education. Give me my Vitamin water with a smile or Ill rip those babies out of your stomach and hand deliver them to you. 5) Alfred Molina. You may win people over with your Dr. Octopus savvy, but you will never EVER be ANY sort of Tevye in Fiddler on the Roof . Be more Jewish or get out! 6) President George W. Bush. I never did have much respect for you, but now any shred of dignity you had is gone. You suck. You do bad things and hurt a lot of people. Your reign of terror will end and I will dance on your recently booted, shrivled up, close-minded, controlling bastard ass. 7) The Day After Tomorrow . Im still reeling from how much you sucked as a movie. Even hot ass Jake Gyllenhaal couldnt have saved it with his huge beautiful blue eyes. I was more excited to see this movie, over everything else this summer. You suck. You suck and you hurt my feelings for being so B-A-D. That spells fucking bad! 8) North Shore . Youre a stupid butthole. Brooke Burns? You are the wrinkle that surrounds the stupid butthole. Your acting skillz are SUPER good. 9) Britney Spears. Ive never seen a stronger argument for legalizing gay marriage in my life. 10) J. Loser. Ditto on the gay marriage statement. 11) Dick Cheney. You suck worse than Bush. You really seriously do. And I think you drool on yourself. Vice President of scaring me! 12) My Alarm Clock. I worry every day that you wont go off. You were made in 1972 and if it werent for your sentimental value, I would throw you out my front window. You are ugly and you are dirty. Andyou are ugly. And dirty. Pudding pies puddin. 13) Liz Phair. What happened? Why do you suck my balls so bad? Why are you licking and nibbling and sucking my nuts? You turned your back on your indie fan base and came out with one of the WORST pop albums I done ever heard. And I am a pop queen, so I know me some poppy. You havent impressed me more than Hillary Duff. And shes a blond donut. Murder It was a dark and stormy evening when I entered the old haunted house. In one hand I had a bottle of chloroform, in the other, I had a knife. I approached you while you were sleeping. Creeping on tip toes (Im gay, memble?), I inched towards your bed, knife raised high to the ceiling. With no need for the chloroform, I casually shoved in into your twatty frosting. You moved slightly, but didnt wake from the pleasant dreams you must have been having. I raised my knife high above your face and I brought it down with full and complete force. Once your last breath escaped from your chocolate mouth, I cut you up and gave you to everyone at my birthday party! You were a hit and everybody loved that your insides were made of ice cream! Haagen Daaz birthday cake, everyone loved it that you died in my honor! What? What. Did you think I was a real murderer? Shit. I have sensibilities. I only kill for fun. You know that. Guess what tomorrow is? The day before my 27th birthday! See you then bitches!

 Update Just letting you all know that Joe CuttheShit will be returning tomorrow with stories of lust, love, hate, and murder. Stay tuned for all the neurotic details.

 Happy Gay Pride(!) from Joe and Angie ! We are now off to the parade and to pimp ourselves out to the gay community. This officially marks the end of gay pride week for us here in NYC. Next up...my birthday! Heh heh. Let the games begizzle.

 Madonna? I laugh in your face! I did it! I am the first gay man EVER to give up FREE Madonna tickets! And do you want to hear the best part? They were VIP tickets and we could have gotten backstage! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA! I am the devil and you LOVE it! The thing is, Madonna has always made me snore. Of course there are certain songs of hers that I can tolerate and even a few I know completely by heart. But thats because shes a pop icon and I would never begrudge her that. However, with it being gay pride (and the concert swarming with people that irk me) and with Madonna changing her name to Esther and with everything she does making me want to cringe with overexposure, the idea of sitting in a stadium cheering for her made my insides curl up and die. I just didnt want to go. Im kind of proud of myself. All I hear from my friends is This is a once in a lifetime opportunity! And my response is For who? Me or Madonna? When my kids ask me if Ive ever had the chance to see Madonna in concert I will say I had VIP tickets and decided to go out to dinner with my boyfriend instead. They will respond But Daddy, couldnt you have gone to dinner with Daddy any other day? And I will say Babycakes, Daddy was the only gay man ever born that never had an interest in Madonna. Now, if it was Alicia Keys or Jason Mraz or Nelly Furtado or a piece of shit dangling from a red kabbalah string, I would have gone in a second. But to have Madonna attached to that piece of string totally ruined it. Daddy does what daddy wants. Not what others think he should do. They will then say Oh Daddywe love you. We will all hug each other and then we will all take dumps. Ah. Gay Pride is slowly winding down. Im off to lunch today with my friend Mariah. We will eat in Chelsea and cruise all of the boys while sipping on wine and chowing on some sort of gay themed food product (probably juicy hot dogs slathered in cum). Tomorrow Im to meet up with my friends from college (56B in da house!) for a bachelorette party. We will drive around the city in a limo and I will be the only gay man in NYC to attend straight bars during Gay Pride Week. But Rita will be there, so it will be all worth it. On Sunday, its off to the big parade! Then there will be lunch and much much much bar hopping. I will hang around as long as I can and then its home to bed with me. I hate going out drinking on Sundays, cuz I need to start my Monday feeling somewhat in control. And I have a huge week ahead of me. Two theatre meetings, my birthday and Fourth of July. YIPES! My dick almost shriveled into a vagina it got so intimidated by all these plans. I hope you all enjoy your weekend! If you see Madonna, tell her Im truly sorry I didnt have the chance to share a carrot stick with her after the show. I was busy picking nits out of Courtney Loves hair. She really needed my help. PEACE OUT!

 I am Eggsausted Last night we had a very intensive theatre meeting. Since we always meet in Manhattan, Kelly and I decided that we should be polite and trek out to Brooklyn so that the third member of our group, Meg, didnt have to do ALL of the traveling. It was such a beautiful night and perfect for the trip. On the way down to Brooklyn, the trains got fucked up and I ended up standing on some random platform waiting for a new train to rescue me from the clutches of the subway station. Out of nowhere, I felt someone pull on my bag and I whip around to see Kelly standing behind me. We traveled separately to the meeting and how she ever found me in the chaos of the NYC transit system, Ill never know. We ride to our destination and on the walk to Megans apartment, we run into her boyfriend, Jason. After talking to him for a few moments, we continue to walk and then bump into our friend, Anne. HUH!? Brooklyn is a VERY big place and how all of this happened in a matter of 20 minutes Ill never know. Craziness, I tell ya. Once at Megans we climbed up to her roof and did the read-thru of the script we wrote. Sitting up high, glasses of wine in hand, the landscape of Manhattan looming beautifully in the backgroundit was a very surreal and remarkable experience. It almost made the 60 minute subway ride to get there worth it. Almost. We are pretty excited about the headway we have made with this show. I mean its super good. And Im not one of those people to toot a horn unless its worthy of being tooted. Weve worked very hard and it shows. I just hope it pays off in the end. Leaving it in Gods hands, as I cant be trusted to leave it in my own. Last night when Paul got home, he found me eating a dinner consisting of potato chips and BBQ sauce. I put on a sad face and said Im hungry. His face fell and he immediately took me to get a nice and healthy Israeli meal at a new restaurant down the street. I mean, who DOESNT eat falafel at 12:30am? As we were eating our hummus and pita, Paul mentioned that he received two free Madonna tickets from a friend of his at work. Joe, we HAVE to go see Madonna tomorrow night. After I finished vomiting in my mouth, I told Paul that I had very little to no interest in seeing Esther perform her overrated hits. Its not that I dont respect Madonna for all that she has accomplished...Im just really tired and wanted a low key night; not a night of hanging out with fairy queens and 8 year old girls all screaming about how we are Material Girls for one reason or another. If it means a lot to Paul, Ill go with him and sit patiently through the concert. But if it was up to me, I would go immediately home after work, smoke a bowl, make a nice dinner and turn on repeats of Scrubs and ER . Whatever, Im sure my destiny is to see Madonna and I shouldnt complain. Many people would kill for this opportunity. I just wish they would kill me now so I wouldnt have to go. Why is Alanis Morissette marrying Ryan Reynolds? If youve seen National Lampoons Van Wilder than you know what a toolbox he is. Its too bad really. Ive always respected Alanis for her music and sing-song anger laden lyrics. But now, she is really turning into a big, soft, cornball. I mean, shes never had great taste in men. Dave Coulier anyone? I mean, she went down on him in a movie theater. CUT IT OUT! Although my thighs say no, my belly says yes. Pizza, I must run to you today. I must run and collapse into your arms and be your love slave. Pizza oh pizza, remember me on this special day. I decided long ago, never to walk in anyones shadows. If I fail, if I succeed, pizza knows that I believe. No matter what they take from me, they cant take away my dignity. Because the greatest love of all is happening to me. And to pizza. To pizza and to me.

 Gay Pride continues For me, last night was the official start to the gay pride week. We all met at Pauls apartment right after work and had some cocktails while talking and playing loud music. Luckily the old crotch from upstairs only came down once to tell us to turn the volume down on the stereo. She sucks, but maybe she had a point. But maybe she still sucks. We played a couple of rounds of one my favorite card games, Cops and Robbers. Its super fun and allows everyone the chance to break the ice with the other people in the room that they dont know very well. The game went well, but I have to admit that it took me 20 minutes to explain the rules. I mean, kindergarteners could pick it up faster, but I guess the combination of booze and marijuana made everyone brain dead to begin with. Paul and I had purchased a bottle of champagne for everyone to share on top of many bottles of liquor and beer. It was definitely a night for getting blasted and acting like a bunch of jackasses. But thats what you do on gay pride? Isnt it? Eventually we made it out to B-Bar. Although we got in right away, the place was jam packed with gays of all shapes and sizes. There were big ones, little ones, red ones and blue ones; all flailing the arms and talking a mile a minute. The crowd was so intense that we quickly snagged a table on the patio as soon as one opened up. Since we had been drinking heavily for hours, we all decided that it was time to get some appetizers. Mariah immediately ordered the chips and salsa and a burrito and Angie shared the Caesar salad and calamari that Paul and I ordered. At some point during the meal, Pauls phone rang and it was his co-worker and friend, Kimmy. Now heres why Kimmys presence in our life is funny: Last Friday on my way home to Albany, Angie and I had a discussion on how we desperately need to have new people in our group of friends. Unfortunately, we are all so picky about who we let in that its very rare for us to meet someone cool enough to chill with. Anyway, we decided that it would be best for all of us if we found a heavy-set black lesbian to be our friend. Since I dont travel in many ethnic circles, I thought it would be impossible for us to ever meet anyone that fit our description. Then enter Kimmy. Out of nowhere, Paul suddenly has this new heavy set, black lesbian friend. HUH!? And hilarious! I immediately told him to bring her to the bar. And that is exactly what he did. Kimmy showed up kind of late in the evening, but Angie and I were still happy to have found our new girl. Kims ordered a margarita pizza and I grilled her on all of the importants. Are you a lesbian? Where do you live? When did you come out of the closet? How does it feel to be one of the only black employees at the restaurant you work for? Yeah, I let nothing slide ever. Im a bit too straight forward for some people, but Kimmy took it all with stride and answered every question perfectly. She passed every one of my little tests. Eventually Mariah and her (slut) girlfriend had to go home and Angie followed them out (Angies got this new teaching position fellowship thing and she is swamped with work. But that didnt stop her from rocking out to the best of her ability. She stumbled home just in time to throw herself into bed). Paul and I stayed at B-Bar so that Kimmy could finish her pizza and drink. After some more grilling from me, I invited Kims back to Pauls apartment for a quick smoke. She gratefully accepted and we made our way home, not forgetting to stop for Big Macs along the way. Ay yi yi. We had a great time talking during our smoke and I decided that Kimmy is totally a new friend to have. She is smart and independent and real. And did I mention that she is a stand up comic? HILARIOUS. She fits every requirement that Angie and I were looking for in a new group member. Well see how it goes. Paul walked Kims out and I shoved the rest of my burger in my mouth. When he got back upstairs, we watched a bit of television and then I threw my drunk ass into bed. At first I had the ultimate in bed spins and really thought I was going to barf all over Pauls cute face. But instead I passed out, not waking until Paul rolled out of bed this morning. What a night. I was pleased to see that a group of us could go out and not have any drama. There were no fights, no yelling, no hitting, no nothing. Just a calm, relaxing evening on a gay pride Tuesday. Ahhhhvery nice. Tonight I have an intensive theatre meeting. We have finished our script and tonight is the first full read through. YAY! I cant believe that we are at this point already. Seeshit really does get done if you stick to deadlines and keep your ass in gear. Also, thank you to those people who sent me their ideas for the song that plays during the Summerland preview. Unfortunately, I had the show wrong. The song actually plays during the preview of the new movie The Notebook . It goes something like this: shumma shum shum wanta feel tonight. Shumma shum for the rest of MYYY life. Do you know it now? Im super good at translating songs into written words without music. You love it and you jizz over it. Now wipe up your cunty and lets have a good afternoon, shall we? Time for me to eat my sammich. Yem. I love sammiches.

 Tangents and Nell Carter (yes again) Today is rainy and annoying. But tonight is the official beginning of Gay Pride week for me! So on one hand I hate today. And on the other, I am totally turned on by today. And with my last hand, I pinch my nipples so hard it feels good. And milk came out. And I drank it. And it tasted good. As soon as this SLOW fucking day ends, I will go over to Pauls apartment to get ready to go to B-Bar. I super love B-Bar. Especially during gay pride week. Everyone dresses in their finest gay clothes and shows off their finest gay moves. Its all very trite and wonderful. Maybe Britney Spears will show up so I can puke on her knee. Shes been known to stop by there. If I see her, I will destroy her. I will destroy her with the puke in mah belly! When my webpage went (mysteriously) down a couple of weeks ago, I was forced to change my template in order to keep everything I had in my database. As you can see, it now looks like melted, brown poop. In any case, I lost my sitemeter in the process and I decided just to leave it off for a few weeks. To be totally honest, the amount of people that visit my site is really inconsequential to me. I just like writing bullshit every day and I get a real kick out of the emails I receive. Anysnoodle, I put the sitemeter back on yesterday afternoon and was VERY surprised to find out that my number of hits Ive been getting has increased exponentially since Ive changed over to my new diarhea colored page. I didnt realize that the world was filled with people who ENJOY looking at shit all day. I mean thanks for stopping by, but you may have a problem. Poop lover. There are places that accept people like you. Its called jail. I watched The Casino last night on Fox. Loved it. Nuff said. I heard Ryan Cabreras song last night for the second time. On both listens, I had hoped he would die. A horrible rotten death. SHIT SONG WRITER AND UGLY FUCKER. He is also dating Ashlee Simpson, who, as we know, is a brilliant artist. I mean, she writes the most beautiful poetry of BULLSHIT I HAVE EVER FUCKING HEARD! Ashlee, Jessicas dimwit sister, and her boyfriend, Ryan, are both managed by her father. And they are both hoping to take their careers to the next level by DYING! DIE DIE DIE! Fucking muscial wastepots. Okin other newslast night I was having my late night cup of tea with my good friend Nell Carter. She had just finished singing some bluesy, soulful medley of pieces when I realized that it was time to watch Who Wants to Marry My Dad? . As I went to change the channel, Nell reminded me that I am not a fucking LOSER who watches the SAME MUNDANE garbage on television every night. I told her that I thought the show might be good for a laugh and she retorted with Please Joe. Dont even PRETEND to think its funny. The show sucks my big black tits. I hugged her and we went to bed. While we were making black love, I heard someone outside my window talking to Frankie Muniz. They were being so loud and it was driving me CRAZZZY! I reached out the window and squished him with my thumb. Little fucking know it all prick. Do NOT interrupt my Nell love making with your Malcom in the Middle snore filled hijinks. I hate you and your little Cody Banks smarm. Nina SkyI love you. Ill move ya body if you want. Im sorry, but is Entertainment Weekly becoming my new porn? First Jake Gyllenhaal on the cover and now Christian Bale? YUMSICLE! Personally I want to look like Jake and have Christian inside my butt. I mean, I know Im an anal virgin, but Ill lose it to Chris. Hes so talented and beautiful. And the Batman Begins movie sounds like the coolest Batman to ever be made. Im pretty excited. And horny. Does anyone know who sings the song that plays on the Summerland preview? I think its Summerland that Im talking about, but I dont remember (all those new summer shows suck balls). If you have any idea what song Im referring to, please send me an email with your thoughts. I guess thats it. Time to go be gay! Enjoy the rest of your day my sweet little gaylords.

 And What a Weekend it Was Ive now officially had two weekends in a row that netted me 8 hours of sleep in total. Although this is gay pride week and Im sure to overdue it yet again, I am MUCHLY looking forward to sleeping in my own bed. It doesnt happen often, so I try to enjoy every second of it when it does. So! On Friday, my friend Angie drove us home to Albany. The trip flew by as we smoked pot and cigarettes and blared music. It was the fastest drive home Ive ever had. We pulled into my driveway at 4pm. My parents werent even home from work yet! I quickly threw a load of laundry in and made myself a drink. Once my parents arrived, there were hugs and kisses and a few more drinks and eventually we got our acts together and went out to a local restaurant for dinner. The weather was beautiful so we were able to sit in the patio area and smoke cigarettes! We had a bottle of wine, really wonderful food, and non-stop conversations about everything under the sun. Our waiter, although only 17, had a super amazing hot great awesome body and I flirted with him the whole time. Im pretty sure he was gayor he just liked the fact that I was drolling all over his arms and chest. After dinner, we went back to my house so I could open up my birthday presents. My parents went overboard as usual, giving me cash, the new Simpsons Season 4 DVD, a couple of cds and movies. You know, the staples to every gay mans collection. The clothes my mom got me were damn hilarious, so we took those back on Saturday afternoon. We ended up staying up until about 3:30-4am playing games. I was pretty wasted and tired by that time. On Saturday, I went tanning with my mom and shopping for new clothes. She is so great to chill with. We laugh and laugh and make fun of everyone else whos not having as much fun as us. You understand. We were supposed to go to Saratoga for the harness track races, but since the Phish show was going on, we decided to stay home and play some more games. Angie arrived around 9 and we had a beer together before heading downtown. Now, the funny thing about going out to the gay bars in Albany is that you always run into the same people. There just isnt enough variety. Anyhizzle, Angie and I ended up going to all three of the major gay bars. We had drinks at all of them, but only one of them had a substantial crowd. A bunch of Mariahs friends met up with us and we had a good time dancing and joking around. Eventually the night left just four of us rocking out. And of COURSE, I ended up run into a penis that I have sucked in the past. The penis has a name and its Barry and he lives in Syracuse. So why was he in Albany at Waterworks on the same night as me!? Very strange and over the top. He looked old and ridiculous and I hugged him and pranced out of the bar. It was super hilarious and man, I am SO glad that I am not still dating him. Bitch looked like shit. When I finally got home that night, I surprised myself when I threw up. Guess I drank more than I had intended. Ooooooooooops. I shoved a slice of pizza in my face and went to bed. 6 hours later I woke up and had lunch with my parents for fathers day. I cant explain how much fun I had with both my mom and dad this weekend. They are incredible people. And my dad surely loved the new CD player I got him as a present. Angie and I took the train home together and had some wine. We played hangman and talked philosophical about anything and everything. Eventually we arrived back in NYC and we went our separate ways. Upon arriving at Pauls apartment, I was overjoyed to find him in a great mood. He immediately gave me baby kisses and ended up taking me out to one of the best dinners ever! I eat out in this city at least 4 times a week and there are STILL places that blow my mind. Inos was one of those places. If you are ever in the mood for a bottle of wine and some excellent and creative tapas, Inos will be your friend till the end. You should definitely get best friend necklaces. You can be Be Fri and Inos can be st ends. It will work best that way. Finally at 10pm last night, I rolled into bed. My goodness, my eyes couldnt stay open for a second after that. I have to admit, I cant WAIT to get into bed tonight. I dont think Ill emerge at all. Well unless I have to take a shit. Then Ill do it on my carpet and clean it up in the morning. Get sleep now, cuz gay pride begins tomorrow! YAY GAYS!

 My Birthday has Officially Begun! I am muchly excited to go home to Albany this weekend. My parents have planned a weekend of fun for my upcoming birthday. Since I dont have a free weekend from now until the beginning of August, my parents decided to do an early birthday celebration with me. They are super cute when it comes to things like this. Tonight we will have a relaxing cocktail (as my mom called itand she doesnt even drink!) and open up my presents. After that, we will go out to a classy type dinner. And then after that we will return to my house to play some card games. Im pretty psyched about it. Since my brother wont call us at home until Sunday, I get to sleep in really late tomorrow morning. I cant explain how badly I need a day like that. Its been a couple of weeks since I had more than 7 hours of rest in one sitting. After I awake, my mom and I will go tanning since my body is a shade darker than a bottle of Elmers glue. We will have a light dinner together and then head up to Saratoga to the harness track! Last year when we went, one of the horses broke free and ran away from the track. When it reached the fence, separating the track from the street, it jumped it and smashed the harness that it was carrying behind it. The crowd gasped and I felt the tears rising in my throat. (Ive always hated any type of animal crueltyfuck you I still like going to the track) A few moments later we heard the gun shot and the horse was killed in front of thousands of cheering fans. Ok sike. The horse was never shot. I took it home and made a spot for it in my bedroom. In any case, the track is always fun when I go with my parents. We bet like three dollars on each race. Since none of us know anything about gambling, we always pick the horse that has the best name. I tend to go for the horse that I think is the gayest one of all of them. Probably why I never win any money. I mean, if it was a horse drag show, I would be sure to win lots of dough. After the track, my parents will drop me off at my friend Mariahs house and I will go trapsing in and out of the Albany gay bars for a couple of hours. I LOVE going to Albany gay bars. Even if Im extra fat and covered in teenage acne angst, Im still looked at as fresh meat and the guys will buy me drinks. Heh heh heh suckers. At some point I will stumble into my parents house and go to bed. On Sunday morning, my brother will call us at the house. After talking to him, I will go to brunch with my moms and dads for Fathers Day. Im hoping we go to Dennys. Its not very classy, but at classy places you dont get to order things like Moons Over My Hammy. Or maybe even the Play it again Slam! HILARIOUS. Ill probably get a cheeseburger. Thats what I ALWAYS get, no matter what restaurant I ever go to. But if we are at Denny's, I will order it like this: "Hi waiter. May I please have a diet kizzle and a cheeseburger in the sky with diamonds?" The waiter will say: "What's a cheeseburger in the sky with diamonds?" Me: "What's a moon over my hammy?" The waiter: "I see. One cheeseburger in the sky with diamonds coming up." Me: "Go fuck yourself." It will be great! At 2pm, my friend Angie and I will board the train and head back to NYC. Im sure we will have a couple glasses of wine on the train. I mean, its just what you do. God forbid we ever have a 3 hour period of our lives without shoving booze down our gullets. I mean, as I said, its just what you do. Then next week is GAY PRIDE week in NYC! Then the week after that is my actual birthday (July 2nd)! Then the week after that I DIE! It will be a crazy exhausting, but crazy fun couple of weeks. And it all starts today! WOO HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! I mean, yahoo. Im going to be 27, so I need to start acting like it. yahoo.

 NELL CARTER IS BACK FROM THE DEAD FO REAL! You are never going to believe how hilarious today is for me. I just opened up the mail at my job and there was a package for me inside of it. I mean, sure, my birthday is coming up in a couple of weeks, so its not totally out of the ordinary for some special gifts to come in the mail. In any case, I open up the box to find a cd of Nell Carter singing with the San Francisco Gay Mens Chorus! Now, if you know me at all, you know that I love and adore Nell Carter. Her voice, her presence on stage, her overall attitudeit took her dying for me to realize how much I love her. I also found out, post death, that she was a lesbian! AMAZING. I just love love love her. Unfortunately, it doesnt seem as though Nell made any solo cds when she was alive. However, I mentioned to my mom, two weeks ago, that I really wanted to find a cd that had Nell Carter singing on it. Today, I received that gift from my mom. Is she not the BREAST mom ever? I am elated and thrilled to be in possession of this wonderful treasure. Ill have to hug my mom extra hard when I go home this weekend. In other news, last night I drank a bottle of wine, ate a rack of ribs, and split a cheeseburger with some friends at Dallas BBQ. Needless to say, the pork slathered beef tasted SO good going down. Unfortunately, it hasnt come out my ass yet, so I am really wondering where it went to? While we were sitting outside in the patio, sucking down our TEXAS sized margaritas, a huge cockroach went running by and almost jumped on my friend Angies face. She screamed, I laughed, the cockie roach got away. Then on the way home, I was crossing the street, all full of ribs and happy, when a menacing Asian woman came flying down the street on a ten speed bicycle. I jumped out the way just in time and Mariah calls out in the womans face, I STOP FOR NOBODY! I died laughing and gave her the esteemed award of Joke of the Day. You really had to see the Asian womans face. She was unphased by my presence in the street. She was determined to speed away as fast as Asianly possible. When we got back to the apartment, Paul surprised us by getting out of work early. We had one last glass of wine together and then Paul and I stayed up for another hour talking about our plans to move in together. We are hoping to make this transition in early December. Until now, he has been fairly hesitant in discussing the details. But last night, we talked and talked and talked and I finally got him to admit how excited he really is. Its a big, yet totally necessary step for us in our relationship. Its time. And I am thrilled about it. I figure, if we get a one bedroom apartment, and we both pay what were paying now, we will get a PHATTY AWESOME crib in the best part of Manhattan. We can spend just about $2,000 a month on a place and that meansREALLY NICE PLACE! YAY! I really need to buy myself some summer clothes. I always move so slow on that shit and I end up having to wear sweaters in this awful NYC heat. H & M here I come! Open your vagina and let me in. I so loving shopping in vaginas.

 Plays and Naps I am here to say that the play we are writing for the theatre company is just about finished! We had a wonderful meeting last night and the ideas were flowing like blood out of a womans vagina. You understand. After the meeting was over, I wrote the ending of the play. It was so much fun to do. Using the character development that Kelly created, I was able to write a pretty cool ending for us using her work as a springboard. I am very happy with how it all turned out. This week, Kelly and Megan, will spend time filling in some of the holes and by next Tuesday, the entire script will be finished! We are hoping to have copies out to our friends by the end of the month and we will use their feedback and comments to fine tune any last minute problems. I am overwhelmed with pride and joy. We chose to write our own play, which is so sketchy. Any time someone tells me that they are writing a book or a screenplay, etc, I am immediately filled with doubt. However, this play came out really good. If people dont like it, I would be very surprised. Its smart, funny, intense, and totally appropriate as a contemporary piece of fiction. We have acomplished something great here and I cant begin to say how relieved I am. We are writers afterall! In other news, I must say that the cast of The Real World: San Diego has proven that the series is not dead. Last nights episode hit some soft spots in my heart. From Jaqueeses moms speech about forgiveness to Cameron and Robyn throwing themselves into the water to get out of work, I was impressed with how much I can still (at the age of 26) relate to these people. Lets pretend that The Real World: Las Vegas never happened, shall we? Heres to the hope that the series will continue to focus on the real issues facing the young people of America and not just on sex and booze. After the show, I made myself a nice dinner and settled in to bed. Yesterday took a lot out of me. But oddly enough, the cold thats been resting comfortably in my head for the last two weeks, subsided a bit. Ive always been of the theory Drink through a sickness. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesnt. The theory itself is pretty fucked up, but I have to admit, I feel much better today. Tonight I have plans to hang out with my friends, Angie and Mariah. Its been over a week since Ive spent some quality time with either of them and we are long overdue. June has been so hectic. There doesnt seem to be much of a reprieve in sight, but Im hoping that I will be able to find a day to sleep in at some point. If Joe doesnt have some time to himself, he becomes a very bitter girl. Alright, time for my daily nap. I dont know how I would survive without having that hour to myself every day. Lately, it just seems so unbelievably necessary.

 Bits and Tids: BitsTids Time to catch everyone up on a few of the bits going on in my life. Im sure EVERYONE has been waiting in EAGER anticipation to read about my tids. So many tids, so little time. 1) Paul has been sick for just about two weeks now. His cough and sore throat seems to never go away. At first it was driving me crazy cuz I couldnt sleep with him hacking his face off all night. Now, its driving me even crazier because I have a permanent cold sitting in MY nose and throat. Its not horrible, but its not pleasant. Every morning I must cough up at least 4 gallons of garbage before I can move on with my day. 2) I (somehow against my better judgement) became a fan of the WBs Superstar USA . For the last month or so, Paul and I have watched every episode faithfully. If you havent seen the show, the premise is this: thousands of wannabe singers (a la American Idol (snore)) audition for what they think is the next big talent show. Those who can actually sing get the boot. Those who embarrass themselves, but also think they possess unbelievable talent, move on to the next round. Eventually, there were 12 people competing (horribly) for the title of SUPERSTAR. None of the contestants knew the show was a prank until the final episode last night. Deep down I felt really horrible for each of these terrible performers. But it was sort of like watching a train wreck; you know you shouldnt stare, but you just have to. Last night they crowned Jamie as the countrys worst singer. Her face hit the floor when she saw clips of how terrible she performed. But then, against all laws of mankind and after hearing that she won because she sucked, Jamie says I am so excited to begin my career as a pop superstar. Britney, give me a call so we can put a video together. HUH? WHAAAAAAAAAAAA? It takes a special person to SEE and HEAR that they SUCK (and was part of a huge PRACTICAL JOKE), only to then turn around and demand Britney Spears to call them. I mean, Britney sucks too, but shes made a living on sucking. Jamie has done no such thing. I about puked with joy, although I wish she had cried when she found out she was a loser. That would have tapped into my sensitive side a little more. 3) Even though my 27th birthday isnt until July 2nd, I am going home this weekend to celebrate with my parents. In typical Joe style, my birthday must take place for two full weeks in order for it to be a success. I have asked for a home entertainment system as well as cash, cash, cash. My parents spoil me rotten, especially with my brother still being in Iraq, so Im muchly excited to rip into my gifts this weekend. We have plans to go out to a nice dinner, play a hundred rounds of my favorite card games, and up to the harness track in Saratoga. I mean, could anyone ask for a better weekend? The only downside is that my friend, Angie, invited me to see the Phish show at SPAC on Saturday night. Unfortunately I had to bail so that I could spend the whole time with my parents. I was never a REAL Phish fan, but now that theyre breaking up, I would so love to be there. Maybe in the afterlife. 4) Speaking of afterlife, I have found a way to summon Nell Carter from the dead. It will take about a pint of my blood and one of the hairs off her head. I think I can swing that. Ill do just about anything to get that girl back in my life. (Winkles!) 5) I had ANOTHER hamster multiplying dream the other night. Once again, they began multiplying within their cages and I had to throw them out the window. This time it was my brother trying to calm me down and help kill the monster hammies. He was so helpful, even though I was screaming at the top of my lungs out of frustration. I woke up feeling dirty and gross again, the way I usually feel after this maniacal repeating dream. 6) I LOVE the Next Action Star already. Last night was a contestant preview and I ate up every second of it. Im sorry, but any show that has hot guys running around and doing hot things makes me quiver with excitement. Who cares that none of them can put a sentence together. 7) Paul and I have a new favorite place to eat. Its called Bullys. For the last 6 months, we have ordered delivery from Bullys just about once a week. I always get the cheeseburger and fries and Paul alternates between the shrimp po boy and the Chicken Parm. Sub. The food is super good, pretty affordable, and always comes within 45 minutes. If I didnt want to be an actor so badly, I would SO want to work at Bullys. You know how it is. Cuz of cheeseburgers and all. 8) Its time to heat up my Lean Cuisine Pizza! Yem! And half the fat and calories of a normal slice. Svelt Joe, here I come! Ok, yall! If you have a great day, Ill have a great day. The weathers beautiful and my mood is good, so Ill do my best to keep up my end of the bargain.

 Friends: They Can Change the World with a Hug All I can say is that I had the most wonderful weekend of my life. I spent all of Friday night with my darling friend Rita. We sat down on her deck, with glasses of wine in our hands, at 6pm and didnt move from our spot (except to get more wine) until midnight. I would even follow her to the bathroom so we wouldnt miss a single second of talk time. If thats not a testement to our friendship, I dont know what is. Rita and I discussed everything from my personal relationships in NY to the upcoming show Im working on to our current favorite movies, music and TV personalities. In fact, we talked so fiercely and for so long, that we both ended the night with hoarse voices. I think I finally rolled in to bed sometime around 3:30am. On Saturday, Rita and I took a VERY long time eating our Taco Bell and watching VH1. Eventually we got our shit together and drove down to Utica to see our friend, Jessicle! After a tour of her house, she and her fiance supplied Rita and I with some beer and wedding tasks to complete. I got to help pick out the songs for the reception (which was so fun!) and I have to admit that I am very happy with the seating arrangements as well. As Rita and I said in unison As long as she and I are sitting next to each other, it doesnt matter who else is at our table. Around 6pm, the four of us headed over to Jessicas parents house for a big party. I have to say, I had the time of my life. Rita and I were attached at the hip and all of the guests at the party wanted a piece of our action. We talked a lot about our lives and goals and dreams, and everyone I met was so welcoming and friendly. Everyone already knew Rita from years of her being friends with Jessicle, so I was able to use her as my springboard when talking to all of these new faces. We chilled at the party for awhile only leaving to go back to Jessicas place for some cards and more beer! What was it? My birthday?! Rita and I stayed up after Jessica and her fiance went to bed and we talked and giggled some more. I slept a total of 5 hours this weekend, but every second of the trip was worth it. The only downside to the entire visit was getting on the train to come back to NY. I said goodbye to my wonderful friends and as soon as I sat in my seat on the train, tears filled my eyes. Lately, Ive been dealing with so much nonsense in my personal life while NYC has been weighing heavily on my shoulders. I dont get to hang with these girls often and I kept saying how happy and fulfilled I felt by being with them. The old days were so much easier than it is now. Everyone just seemed to have a lot more respect for eachother back then. Weird that as I get older, this level of understanding seems to fade away. But Ill take the peace and quiet, if only for one weekend. On to another brutal week, but I know I can do it! Sorry for the personal shout out everyone, but Im sure you dont mind : Thank you Rita. You know how badly I needed you this weekend. Your honesty and support has always been a necessity in my life. You give it to me straight and you give me the confidence I need when making hard decisions. I cant think of anyone else in my life that I need as desperately as you. I wouldnt have been able to come back here if it werent for you. I know it was hard to let me go, as it was hard for me to leave. Im counting the days until your next visit.

 Off on a Trip! Today I leave to go see my bestest friend Rita in Syracuse. As many of you remember I went to Syracuse on May 1st to be a part of Ritas wedding! Although its only been 6 weeks since Ive seen her, I have easily shriveled up and died without her presence in my life. I need to talk to her, to hug her, to LAUGH with her. Really, one night with her seems to solve any problem I have going on in my life. Most likely, we will sit on her deck and drink wine and smoke cigarettes and talk about everything thats happened in the last 6 weeks. I cant wait to see pictures from her honeymoon and wedding. I cant wait to show her the stuff Ive been working on for the theatre company. And I cant wait to play games! Although Rita loves to knit, she fulfills my gaming request every time I roll into Syracuse. Ok, that made Rita sound like the ultimate granny. Well, she is 65 so I guess that makes sense. Tomorrow, Rita and I will drive to Utica to see another one of our friends, Jessica. Jessica gets married in July and since Im a groomsman, I must get fitted for my tux before its too late. From what I hear, Jessicas brother is having a birthday party that night, so Rita and I will attend the event with big smiles on our faces and hopefully liquor in our veins. The last time I saw Jessicas brother he was like 10 years old and 5 feet tall. Now hes supposed to top 6 ft. Yipes! What if I want to do him while Im there? Overall, Im much in need of getting out of the city. I love going upstate when the weathers nice. Everything smells so good and people are in better moods. Also, the cigarettes cost $4 a pack and for methe trip is worth it just for that. Well, and also for Rita. Have great weekends! Drink a gallon of your favorite beverage and eat at least 4 slices of pizza. Otherwise, this weekend would be a bomb fo you fo sho! Ardios!

 My First Career Step So I did it. I went to my first big networking party in NYC. It wasnt as much of an audition as I had hoped, but it was definitely a good chance for me to meet a few agents in this city and to start building my list of contacts. There were hundreds of people at the event and because I attended by myself, I started to feel a bit uncomfortable, having no one to bullshit with while I was waiting in line. I mean, not kidding. Hundreds of people. I stayed for about an hour and in that time, I connected with five agents, three of whom took my name and info and gave me theirs in return. Initially, I was nervous that I wasnt going to be able to handle myself in this type of situation. But, everyone was very nice and helpful. I explained that I was currently working for a non-profit theater company in NYC. They asked which one and when they said they hadnt heard of it, I told them all about the mission statement and what we have done over the last year. The majority of the agents seemed pretty impressed with my desire to work, regardless of not getting paid or accumulating points to enter into the union. The hightlight of the experience was when a producer for the agency walked up to me and asked if I would be interested in reading for a role for an upcoming independent film. I immediately said yes and we sat down and talked for a few minutes. He (Frank) explained that he liked my look and resume and that, in a couple of weeks, he was doing an audition for the lead roles of his low budget movie. My excitement burned in my stomach as I listend to Frank describe the movie and the parts available. Then the clincher, they will be filming the movie during the first three weeks of August. NOOOOOO! Not that its set in stone, but my brother is supposed to come home during the first week of August. I explained my situation to him and he told me that I should still call him in a couple of weeks about the reading and if I found that I was available, we should definitely get together again and talk. Overall the party was too much for me. I felt out of place having no one to talk to during the down time. But on the flip side, I felt so proud of myself for taking the risk and goingall by myself. I definitely believe I was one of the best looking guys there. And although I saw hundreds of gay men, I was one of the few masculine ones. So, well see. I submitted my headshot and resume to two more producers for other upcoming roles that I found through Backstage. And next week Im planning on hitting up another agency for an audition. At this rate, Ill be on a soap opera in no time! Thanks for all the emails with well wishes. You are all so supportive. When I make it to the big time, I will make sure to tell you who I am, so you can say, I remember when he was cutting the shit five days a week for 2 years! Its all very wonderful and surreal.

 THE DENTIST: AY AY AY! This morning I went to see my dentist, as you could probably tell from the title of my post. I have been terrified all week about going because I was to have a periodontal scraping today; scaling if you will. Ick. Even writing those words makes me shudder. The people in my dentist office are just about the nicest and kindest people on the planet. Ive become pretty cool with them since my last visit. The receptionist, Nelly, gave me a huge hug when I walked in the door. I totally needed that as my hands were shaking like little gay leafs. They immediately called me into the recesses of the office and had me sit in the chair. The hygenist said My name is Paris, I will be your hygenist today. I responded with Hi Paris. My name is terrified. I feel like I could pee all over the floor. She laughed and put her hand on my shoulder. Oh Joe, Ill take very good care of you. I sat in the chair for over an hour as Paris scraped and proded all inside my mouth. She used some sort of hyper-intense spray that removed all the stains on my teeth. (Ritamember the stains on the inside of my teeth from smoking? Theyre gone!!!) After she was done removing the stains, I said Are we almost done? I dont know how much more of this I can take. She responded with Oh Joe, we just started. I have a lot more to do. Nooooooooooooooooooooo! I need more novocaine. Paris kindly obliged and then scraped so far below my gum line that I thought she was going to accidentally pluck every tooth out of my head. Needless to say, that didnt happen. Finally, she was finished. My gums were very swollen, but immediately looked much better. The dentist came in and said What a remarkable difference. Your teeth are in excellent shape and if you keep flossing and taking care of your gums, you should be back to normal in no time. Phew. Paris gave me a hug as I left (everyone hugs the Joe) and I made another appointment with Nelly for a follow up visit; just to make sure everything is healing appropriately. I have a cleaning scheduled for October as well and I finally feel like Im on track with my teeth. And what a smile I have! Im sure to get a ton of movie roles now. It will take a day or so for my gums to fully heal. I mean, you dont dig that low and expect there to be no reprocussions. But for the most partits all over. I am so proud of myself for being a big boy and getting this taken care of. I even went all by myself! Shit, you should SEE the size of my balls today. For all of you that prayed and wished me luckthank you. Why is it that journalers seem to remember big things in my life when no one else in my personal life can? By tomorrow I hope to have a gleaming, happy smile. And I owe it all to Paris Hilton and Nelly, the singer.

 I have had ENOUGH When I woke up this morning, I thought to myself I cant do it. I cant work another day at my unsatisfying, shit job. And with that attitude, I got dressed and got on the subway. Once I sat down in my chair at my desk, I decided that the only person who is going to change my life is me. I cant sit around anymore and wait to be discovered or wait for God to give me a handout. I need to be proactive and cause change in my life. It doesnt happen just because you want it more than anything else in the world. You have to actually go out there and get it. I immediately began pouring through various theatre publications trying to find information on how to obtain an agent, what auditions are available to Non-Union actors, and what I need to do to step out of my comfortable little world. Then I came across a casting notice for an independent horror movie, filming in September. There are 15 roles available, yet only five of them fit my physical description. All of the parts are paid and the production should be finished filming by the end of September. I immediately jumped on it and sent the company an email. In turn, I received an email back from them telling me that not only are they casting for the horror movie, they are holding a workshop seminar on Wednesday night from 6pm-midnight. At this seminar, there will be a variety of agents, producers, etc. that will be accepting resumes and headshots for potential actors. Usually these type of events cost a couple hundred dollars to attend. This one is free unless you show up after 8pm. I registered myself and one guest (anyone want to go?) and plan on dressing nice and heading over immediately after work on Wed. Who knows if anything will come of this? But at this point, I dont care. I need SO badly to get out of my hum drum job and to do what I came to this city to do. The worst thing that could happen is that I meet other people who are involved in the entertainment business. Coming from a place where I have NO contacts, the worst scenario seems pretty great. Please say a little prayer for Joe CuttheShit. He needs to get this acting career rolling in a much more profitable and productive manner. I have the talent, the look and some decent experience. All I need now is to accept the fact that rejection will happen and get my ass in gear. The only person thats going to make this dream come true is me.

 Figures Last night I went to see Shrek 2 with my mom and Paul. It was so nice to have an outing with my favorite woman on the planet and my favorite man on the planet. The three of us sat together like a teeny happy family. And I must say that the movie was fucking incredible. Puss n Boots? OMG. I dont remember the last time I laughed so hard at a character in a movie. He steals the show. Completely. Im sorry, but those CUTE LITTLE EYES! Pure genius. And that hairball? That scene brought me back to one of my all time favorite moments in a movie: National Lampoons Christmas Vacation . The dog coughing up the chicken bones under the Christmas dinner table? HILARIOUS! The movie itself flies by and before you know it, its over. What an absolute pleasure it was to see a movie of this quality. Im sure The Day After Tomorrow will pale in comparison. But then again, a tidal wave swallowing up NYC just might be the kick in the balls I need. After the movie was over, I suddenly started to feel awful. Paul and I put my mom in a cab and took the subway back to his apartment. The entire way I started to feel, as Paul would say, fluish. We got to the apartment, hung out with his roommate for a bit and then climbed into bed. I laid there wide awake and feeling like garbage until well after 2am. At one point, I said out loud I cant fucking sleep! I thought Paul was fast into dreamland, but he responds Me either! and we curled up into the spooning position and lay there quietly. When I woke up this morning my body felt as though a hundred dirty bricks had fallen on my face. My stomach was rolling with nausea and my body ached like nothing else. I slowly crawled into the shower and then slowly got dressed. I guess Pauls psychosomatic sickness wasnt so psychosomatic after all. Dont I feel sheepish? And like shit. Once I got to work, I started to feel a bit better. Im doing my best to fight through this beast of a cold/flu/typhoid fever. I have plans to go out with my friend Angie tonight and I would be MISERABLE if I was too sick to go. Im thinking a little nap after work and maybe a bottle of vodka will get me where I need to be. Unless Im vomiting out my ass, Im GOING out tonight. Come hell or diarrhea water. I just bought myself a chicken enchilada Lean Cuisine. That should SURELY make my touchy stomach feel much better. As Ari said, Ill be gone from work before that food hits your stomach and causes some damage. The meal itself is pretty good. Needs salt. And I dont have any. I guess thats it for today. Have super good weekends. Do something fun and laugh a lot. Thats what Im hoping to do, so long as I dont puke on myself before I get to that point.

 Tids and Bits: Tidbits Did you know that I wear two silver rings on my right hand? Both are gifts from my boyfriend Paul. But did you know that when I masturbate I have to remove the band on my ring finger and put it on the ring finger on my left hand? Too much metal on one hand doesnt lead to conductive masturbation. As though this is of less importance than my masturbation techniquesI received an email from my brother today that gave his TENTATIVE dates for re-deployment in the United States. God willing, he will be leaving Iraq by July 1st and home with my family by July 22nd. My heart leapt with joy and I experienced this moment of calmness that I havent felt since he left. Im not getting my hopes upbut LordI know youre out there. Please let this happen. Tonight I am going to see Shrek 2 with my mom and Paul. First we will head over to Ranch One (for those of you who are not NYers, Ranch One is a fast food chicken sandwich place that is an addiction that my mother and I share). Afterwards we will head down to see the movie. I had such a super great time with her last night. We ended up not going to dinner, but staying in her hotel room from 6-11pm drinking wine, smoking packs of cigarettes and talking about everything under the sun. And oddly enough, only a few tears were shed (Its hard to talk about my brother with my parents and not lose it as you could imagine). This has been one of the best visits with my mom that Ive ever had. I wish she could stay for a week instead of for just a couple of days. I saw someone wearing a Bart Simpson Underachiever t-shirt yesterday. Umwhat? There are so many things wrong with this style choice that I dont even know where to begin. Please, if you are reading this and you own one of these t-shirts, put it to sleep with your Jams and your Jelly shoes. Forever and ever Amen. I was able to rope my friend Angie into seeing The Day After Tomorrow with me. Of all the plans that I have for this weekend, going to see this movie is by far the highlight. I love Nelly Furtado. So much. Too much. More than a gay man should. Id eat her tits if she asked me to. I went home last night and played with my hammies for an hour or so. The whole time I kept thinking Please dont multiply and have babies. I dont want to have to throw you out of my bedroom window. Luckily nothing like that happened. But on the flip side, it took me 10 minutes to get my favorite hammie, Jim, to come out of his cage. He sat upright, with his back turned to me for a long time. I think he was pissed that Ive been out of my apartment for so long. But eventually he crawled into my hand and we watched TV together for awhile. He totally loves Blind Date , so I watched back to back episodes at his request. Sometimes I am wrong about things. I do enjoy Jake Gyllenhaals acting, but I have always thought that he was kind of ugly. Like in aI dont knowugly way. Anyway, he was on the cover of last weeks Entertainment Weekly promoting his new movie and Im not kiddinghe looked absolutely beautiful. Hes still not my ideal physical type, but I decided after studying the picture that I want to look exactly like him. He has great hair and eyes and I think I may have to reconstruct myself to look like him. Weird how this happens. One minute I think hes semi-busted, the next minute, Im going on the Swan Pageant to look just like him. I am in LOVE with the Lean Cuisine French bread Pizza. It is so super good. Low fat and calories and its microwavable. If you are looking for a light lunch that wont go right to your hips and thighs, this is the food to eat. Ashley Simpson, sister of Jessica Simpson, has a new single out. It makes me want to hurl with uncreative boredom. Come ON! Why are people still signing record contracts with these cheap and overused knock off performers? Enoughs fucking enough. I mean, I totally fell into the Vanessa Carlton, Michelle Branch, Avril Lavigne (although I hate that bitch so much) trap. But I have since grown up into a smarter woman and I refuse to get into Ashleys Pieces of Me bullshit. Take your rip off and shove it up your sisters dumb ass. And thats my tids and bits for this Thursday. Enjoy your day! I am surely going to try to do the same.

 The Hammies are at it Again! Last night I went to bed around 11:30pm. I took a couple sleeping pills since Ive had some trouble falling asleep these days. It was easy last week when I didnt have to work. But now that my schedule is all fucked up, Im like wide awake at midnight every night. Anywaystangent over. I took my pills and laid my pretty head on my pillow. Yes, its pretty. Fuck you for doubting. I fell asleep pretty quickly and immediately found myself in my apartment. It was like waking up in a Freddy Krueger nightmare. (By the way, Microsoft Word corrected the spelling of the word Krueger for me. I didnt know Bill Gates was such a horror fanatic) I woke up in my dream to find myself standing in my bedroom. Instead of my usual two hamster cages, I had three. The third one was broken and it had some sort of water slide attached to it. It made a lot more sense in the dream. When I looked further into the broken cage, I realized that my three hamsters had babies. I mean, theyre all male, but I rationalized for myself that even though they all have penises, animals will find a way to survive. You understand. When the baby hamsters started going down the water slide, I began scooping them up and putting them back into their appropriate cages. They bit me on my fingers the whole time. As I dropped them into their cages, I noticed that more babies had been born. As the dream progressed, all three cages began filling up with hamsters and I couldnt scoop them up fast enough. Next thing I know there are hamsters biting my toes and running everywhere in my apartment. I remember a distinct feeling of fear. Some of the older hamsters in the cages were huge. They looked like they were going to explode with more babies. I screamed for Kelly to come in and help me. Finally Kelly arrived and I yelled at her for putting the hamsters in the broken cage. Now look what has happened! Kelly laughed and thought it was pretty funny that there were so many pets running around our apartment. Suddenly there was a knock on our front door and our OLD next door neighbors, Don and Joan, came in and told us that there were hamsters all over the floor of my building. Were going to call the police if you dont take care of this mess! I ran back into my apartment to find hundreds of hamsters in my bedroom. I felt horrible, but I knew that the only way to get rid of them was to throw them out the window. As I tried to toss them out, they latched on to my fingers with their razor sharp teeth. I did one of those hand shaking wildly maneuvers, but the little bitches wouldnt let go. I distinctly remember the pain they were inflicting on my poor gay hand. I couldnt keep up with the hamsters reproducing and eventually I just sat down on my floor and cried. Kelly came over to me and told me to quit it. She called me a baby or something and I just sat there with hamsters biting my toes. Eventually I woke up and remained awake for the rest of the night. It was an awful dream and the weirdest part about it? I had torn skin on my thumb this morning. Maybe I bit it while I was sleeping? Maybe the hamsters jumped into my real world a la Freddy Krueger. In either case, Im going home and killing all of my hammies.

 BACK IN ACTION Well, I am back from my mini-vacation. It never is long enough and this time was surely no exception. I dont know how Im going to get used to getting up when the alarm goes off. Im so used to sleeping in until noon now. It feels odd to get up at 7:30am. I mean, who DOES that? Oh yeahme. Had an incredible week. Got to see Wicked for free on Wednesday night. Hung with a good friend on Thursday and again on Saturday. Made my rounds as best as I could. BUT the best part about the week was because of my (always surprising me) boyfriend. On Saturday night, Paul and I had some drinks with his roommates and then went out to the classiest and best dinner I have ever had in NYC. We were both a bit toasted from our cocktails, so we wanted to go eat locally. He had heard that urlLink Hearth was a good place and that it was rated two stars, which for NYC restaurants is a HUGE deal. We each ordered the tasting menu. We both had 6 courses, including duck, trout, sirloin, and chicken. We then had this amazing soup and dessert. Paul ordered one of the most expensive bottles of wine on the menu and we followed it up with a beautiful bottle of dessert wine. I mean, the kid spoiled me rotten and we had the best time of our life. The billwell, lets just say that it takes me two weeks to make that kind of money. Paul is known for spoiling me as well as his friends. But lately, he and I have been doing so well, that he has taken great liberties in treating me like a true princess. I mean, honestly, Ive never been happier with him. He has been sweet and kind and funny as fuck. I about shit every time he opens his mouth. The dinner was justextra. And what an extra it was! If it werent for Paul, I would never get to see this side of NYC. You know, the classy side. Lets seewhat else? Going into the weekend I hadnt seen Kill Bill . Now, Ive seen it three times. I ADORE Quentin and his movies are like guilty pleasures times a thousand. I have already asked for the movie for my birthday. I mean, I cant rent it EVERY weekend. This week is hectic as my mom is coming to town! Once a year she comes to NYC on business and we always have the time of our life. Tomorrow night we are sure to have dinner togethermeaning we will drink two bottles of wine and call it a night. On Thursday, Im bringing Paul and maybe a friend of mine to have a REAL dinner. Time to show her what NYC is REALLY like. Haha. You know Im taking her to the gayest restaurants ever. I mean, my moms a Gaylord, right? Other than that, its pretty quiet in my world. Very happy. Very healthy (although Paul and I got some sort of flu on Sunday). I am caught up on all my television programs and visits with people. It feels like I am on top of everything right now and I know that cant be right. Theres always some sort of drama right around the corner. So Ill keep you informed as it happens. It will make for a much better entry. Cuz reallywhats Cut the Shit without SOME sort of petty drama going on? I better go take ANOTHER shit now. You dont eat 6 courses at a fancy dinner and expect to get it all out in one dump! ENJOY THE DAY MY LOVELIES!

 16 Months Have Led To This Moment I'm leaving right now to pick my brother up at the airport.&nbsp; I'm excited, nervous, anxious, and overall...ready.&nbsp; The next two weeks will be crazy and fun and it will be the first time in a year and a half that my family has been all together.&nbsp; I feel so blessed.&nbsp; Winfield survived his experience in Iraq.&nbsp; Now it's time for him to come home so we can take care of him, rather than him taking care of us.&nbsp; I'll stop in while I'm away and give an update.&nbsp; But for now...Ardios!&nbsp; I gotta go to JFK! &nbsp;

 I Now Own a Cell Phone For the last three years, I have been cell phone free.&nbsp; I had one at one point as Paul gave it to me as a gift during our first Christmas together.&nbsp; I ended up going way over my alloted minute usage and he ulitmately had to pay about a thousand dollars in fees.&nbsp; Ooooooooops.&nbsp; It was after he paid that bill that the cell phone was taken away from me.&nbsp; Since then, I havent gotten a new one. WELL.&nbsp; For my birthday Kelly offered to get me a new cellie.&nbsp; Last night we went to the local wireless provider and I picked out a new phone!&nbsp; It has a camera and text messaging and Instant Messenger and it even plays the radio when I plug in my headset.&nbsp; UM!&nbsp; What is it?&nbsp; The coolest phone ever?&nbsp; When I woke up this morning I thought Fuck.&nbsp; Another day.&nbsp; And then I remembered!&nbsp; Another day, cept with a cell phone!&nbsp; I jumped out of bed, french kissed it, and got in the shower. &nbsp;I am very pleased.&nbsp; And Im finally and adult! This weekend begins my life of chaos.&nbsp; Tomorrow is the wedding, Sunday my uncles come, Monday afternoon my brother flies in from Germany.&nbsp; Its hard to explain how I feel about all of this.&nbsp; Obviously Im overwhelmed with excitement.&nbsp; The idea of going home and having my brother there with me is surreal.&nbsp; Ive been visiting home just about once a month for the last year and a half and its never been the same without Winfield there. On the flip side, Im pretty nervous to confront all of the emotions that have been buried since he left for the war.&nbsp; In order for me to survive the last year and a half, I have had to find a way to block my constant worry and upset.&nbsp; Now that he is safe and coming home, Ive started to realize how deep down Ive put all of this stuff.&nbsp; Its like Im just starting to deal with him being gone now.&nbsp; Like I said, its hard to explain. Overall, Im so happy and relieved that this moment has finally arrived.&nbsp; I cant believe that in 3 days, Ill be looking across the kitchen table at my brother.&nbsp; He will be eating his spaghetti and I will be thinking how much I love him and have missed him.&nbsp; For at least two weeks, my brother will be safe and sound.&nbsp; God has been so good to us and I do believe that since we have been so patient throughout this process, we have finally earned the reward of being a family again. Only 3 more days &nbsp;

 The Read Thru of Our New Play &nbsp; Last night at 7pm, we held the first read thru of our new play!&nbsp; 10 people showed up to be a part of the experience, including a playwright that we hadnt invited.&nbsp; We did our best at making the whole experience as professional, yet informal as we could.&nbsp; We distributed folders with a copy of the script, a ledger pad to take notes, and free pens for all!&nbsp; We also provided wine and beer to get everyone in the mood. &nbsp; We were all very nervous to show our work to these hand-selected folks.&nbsp; After two months of working very hard on our play, I think each of us was afraid that the play wouldnt be as mind-blowing as we had hoped.&nbsp; Overall, it went very well, but there were definite moments that made my face flush with embarrassment and frustration. &nbsp; First off, the girl who read the stage directions (which happens to be a HUGE part in our play) sucked ass.&nbsp; Ali barreled through the directions just to get them out of the way.&nbsp; Although everyone had a copy of the script in front of them, her lackluster performance caused everyone to tune out when she spoke.&nbsp; Because of that, I feel like they all missed out on some key character development moments.&nbsp; Ali used to work with us in the past, but since she quit the company, I have become so unimpressed with her level of passion and commitment.&nbsp; After last night, Im pretty sure I never want her to do anything for us or with us again.&nbsp; &nbsp; In any case, the reading went well.&nbsp; I have such high respect for both Kelly and Meg (the other people who co-wrote the play with me).&nbsp; They were such troopers throughout the whole night and at the end, when they could tell that I was frustrated and a bit upset, they did everything in their power to turn my attitude around.&nbsp; They have made working with them a highly enjoyable experience. &nbsp; But Im getting ahead of myself. &nbsp; At the end of the reading we held a talk-back session.&nbsp; We received some wonderful compliments as well as some very thought provoking questions.&nbsp; I was extremely pleased with the level of effort everyone put in towards understanding our play.&nbsp; But then, HE spoke, the playwright we hadnt invited in the first place.&nbsp; This is the first thing that came out of his mouth: I really love the concept of your play.&nbsp; However, I took 18 pages of notes that I would like to share with you.&nbsp; &nbsp; For about 20 straight minutes (during which I took a bathroom break), HE gave us criticism after criticism.&nbsp; Sure, some of what he said was definitely beneficial to us.&nbsp; But I think I lost all respect for him when he pulled out a piece of paper and said, Im going to teach you guys a very simple lesson on writing.&nbsp; He proceeded to draw a stick figure.&nbsp; Next to it he drew a box.&nbsp; In between the box and the stick figure, he drew a lightning bolt symbol of sorts.&nbsp; In every play you need to have a person, a goal, and a problem.&nbsp; Once you have that, everything else falls into place. &nbsp; WHAT?!?&nbsp; WHAT WHAT WHAT?!?&nbsp; I sat there as politely as I could, but who did this kid think he was talking to?&nbsp; Im sorry, did I just pick up a pen yesterday?&nbsp; Did I spend two months working on a script, only to forget that I must have some sort of dilemma within the story?&nbsp; Is the play about 3 people who just sit and stare at each other for an hour?&nbsp; UGH.&nbsp; I was immediately pissed off and furious.&nbsp; WHO did this kid think he was?!? &nbsp; With my face beat red from fury, I thanked him for his comments and we closed the meeting.&nbsp; Yes, we surely have more work to do on the script.&nbsp; As we learned last night, there are a few holes and a few things we can expound on.&nbsp; However, I can guarantee you that the protagonist, antagonist, and resolution were so blatantly obvious that all HE did was prove he wasnt paying nearly enough attention. &nbsp; Anyhizafter the meeting, Kelly and Meg pulled me from the dredges of my disappointment.&nbsp; I do need to learn how to take constructive criticism better.&nbsp; I also need to lower my exceedingly high expectations of myself.&nbsp; Ive been trained as an actor, not as a writer, so of course there is still a lot I need to learn.&nbsp; I just dont need someone drawing stick figures to explain the mechanics of writing to me.&nbsp; suckmyballs. &nbsp; Angie and I hopped into a cab after the meeting and spent the next hour discussing the show.&nbsp; She went through all of her notes with me and we worked out some of the residual issues that I was carrying with me.&nbsp; I eventually ended up drinking a bit too much, shoving my face with chicken nuggets and grilled cheese when Paul got home and collapsed into bed around 2am.&nbsp; I woke up this morning gasping for a glass of water.&nbsp; I guess a pack of cigarettes and a bottle of booze will do that to you.&nbsp; &nbsp; So, we continue to write and rewrite and we move forward.&nbsp; Im SO glad we did the read thru and I am muchly grateful to everyone for joining us on this special occasion.&nbsp; I think Ill go home tonight, pull out my dolls, and try to teach myself how to be a better writer. &nbsp; If Barbie wants to marry Malibu Stacey, what issues will they have to overcome in order for that to happen?&nbsp; No, THINK Joe.&nbsp; You must have an issue for them to resolve.&nbsp; You cant just have them make-out for two hours.&nbsp; THATS not a play! &nbsp; For good measure, suck my hairy balls playwright extraordinaire!&nbsp;

 Im Completely Overwhelmed &nbsp; God, where do I start? &nbsp; In the next five days, I have to do the following things (you tell me if this all seems a bit over the top): &nbsp; Tonight is the first read thru of our Theatre Companys original work.&nbsp; After 2 and months of writing and rewriting, we are finally ready to go forward with a read thru.&nbsp; The three of us who have collaborated on this project are all very nervous.&nbsp; To be an artist, you must be comfortable with risk taking.&nbsp; Tonights read thru is a prime example of that.&nbsp; What if no one likes our show?&nbsp; What if they think its badly written?&nbsp; What if the feedback is mostly negative?&nbsp; I am very proud of the work we have done, but until an outsider reads it, we wont know if its any good.&nbsp; Wish us luck please.&nbsp; This is a big night for the Company. &nbsp; As I write this, two friends of mine are crashing in my apartment.&nbsp; I adore these friends and am so happy that Im able to give them a room in Manhattan for a couple of days.&nbsp; However, with everything else I have going on, not being able to be in my bedroom, much less sleeping there, is stressing me out.&nbsp; These friends are not imposing on me at all.&nbsp; The timing is just unideal.&nbsp; &nbsp; On Saturday morning, I must get up at the crack of dawn and take a train to Long Island.&nbsp; I have yet ANOTHER wedding to go to this weekend.&nbsp; Luckily Im not in the wedding this time around, so I wont have to take three of hours of wedding party pictures.&nbsp; Since the ceremony is at 11am, I can guarantee you that I will be COMPLETELY plastered by 1pm.&nbsp; Its the only way I will survive, I think.&nbsp; That night, I will crash in a hotel, only to get up bright and early the next day to come back to the city. &nbsp; On Sunday, my wonderful gay uncles from California arrive in the city.&nbsp; I have plans to go shopping with them or out to a bar, maybe just walking around SoHo. &nbsp;In any case, that night, Paul and I will take them to dinner and out for yet more drinks.&nbsp; It will be a very fun time for all of us, if I can keep my eyes open during the experience. &nbsp; Monday, I work until 1pm and then head over to JFK airport to pick up my brother!&nbsp; He flies in around 3pm and will be greeted by both my parents and myself.&nbsp; We will surely make signs announcing his arrival and be screaming at the top of our lungs as he steps off the plane.&nbsp; Since we havent seen him in 16 months, the visit is SURE to be intensive with laughter and tears pouring out of our bodies at every possible moment.&nbsp; For two weeks I will be making the rounds with my brother; seeing friends and family that have missed him so much while he has been gone.&nbsp; &nbsp; Although I will be out of work for a good week and , it wont be as much of a vacation as I need.&nbsp; Its not like Ill be sleeping in late and lounging around.&nbsp; There are numerous parties and dinners that I need to go to, etc.&nbsp; Im sure it will be more fun and laid back than Im predicting, but at this point, Im almost ready to throw my hands up in the air and say I cant do any of it.&nbsp; &nbsp; My nerves are shot.&nbsp; I feel emotionally unbalanced.&nbsp; Im completely and utterly overwhelmed.&nbsp; How does one person juggle all of these events without having a nervous breakdown?&nbsp; If I dont find a way to have some time to myself over the next two weeks, Im sure to collapse into a very deep depression.&nbsp; &nbsp; I dont work the way most people do.&nbsp; I love to be busy, but I hate to lose control.&nbsp; With almost every event happening in the next few weeks, I have little to no control over any of it.&nbsp; That makes me nervous and uptight.&nbsp; I want to enjoy myself and I want to smile through the experience.&nbsp; However, in order to do that, I have to find a couple of hours here and there to either sleep, read a book, or stare at the wall. &nbsp; &nbsp;I guess thats it.&nbsp; &nbsp; Keep me in your thoughts and prayers.&nbsp; Im going to need the support.&nbsp;

 Good Ole Joe &nbsp; Will be back tomorrow with a new and fresh post!&nbsp; This week has been nuts, so he's asked me, his secretary of shit, to leave this note.&nbsp; &nbsp; He misses you all and will be back asap. &nbsp; &nbsp;

 Its FINALLY the weekizzle! &nbsp; I cant possibly explain to you how badly I need this weekend.&nbsp; &nbsp; I have had something to do every weekend since June 5th.&nbsp; From birthdays to weddings to gay pride to family visits, I have not had a Saturday or Sunday to myself since before the summer started.&nbsp; I could just about collapse with exhaustion.&nbsp; Tonight I will go out with my friend Angie, after which I will crawl into my bed and not move until Monday morning at 7am when I will get up and come back to work.&nbsp; Its like a fantasy.&nbsp; Could I really sleep for two whole days if I want to?&nbsp; Why yes I can! &nbsp; Last night Angie came over.&nbsp; We had plans to go to dinner, but ended up getting trashed in my bedroom.&nbsp; Of course I had to play the new Guster cd for her over and over and over.&nbsp; At one point she said Joe, enoughs clearly enough.&nbsp; Put Guster away and come over here and fuck me.&nbsp; I obliged and she gave birth to the most beautiful baby girl this morning.&nbsp; I put a pink bow in the little hair she has and came to work elated.&nbsp; Im the proud owner of a tiny baby girl!&nbsp; Her name is Cherie.&nbsp; Just like Punky Brewsters black friend who got trapped in the refrigerator during that deadly game of Hide n go seek.&nbsp; &nbsp; So there is this guy that takes the same bus route home that I do.&nbsp; I first laid eyes on him before I left to go to the wedding last weekend.&nbsp; He is about 6ft, thin, short blond hair styled sensibly but hotly, and deep blue eyes.&nbsp; He was wearing these professional looking glasses and a beautiful suit.&nbsp; Last week, he stared at me throughout the entire ride.&nbsp; I noticed that the bag he was carrying said Miller Thomson.&nbsp; I immediately went home and looked the name of the company up on the internet, but I wasnt able to find any information about him.&nbsp; Sadly, I turned my computer off and thought I had lost him forever. &nbsp; Yesterday, I was riding the bus home, as always, and I started to think about him again.&nbsp; What would I do if I saw him?&nbsp; Would I say hi or introduce myself?&nbsp; He didnt SEEM gay, but with the looks he was giving me, how he could not be?&nbsp; As I was mulling this all over, he steps on to the bus, walks to the back and sits next to me.&nbsp; My heart began beating out of my chest and my palms started to sweat.&nbsp; It must be a sign!&nbsp; &nbsp; I casually looked in his direction and he did the same.&nbsp; Our knees bumped into each other and lingered longer than they would have had he been a straight guy.&nbsp; My right arm and his left arm grazed one another and I thought that I was going into a sexually charged panic attack.&nbsp; We both get off at the same stop, so when it was time, we got up and stood next to each other waiting to be released from the buss clutches.&nbsp; The door opened, we both stepped off, looked in each others eyes one more time and went our opposite ways. &nbsp; I exhaled a huge sigh and started to think about why I was so intrigued by this guy.&nbsp; I never go for skinny guysthey have to be muscled monsters.&nbsp; But in this case, I find his look to be so hot.&nbsp; Very professional and dignified and incredibly good looking.&nbsp; He walks like a man and he carries himself with pride. &nbsp;I gave him a part of my heart and he has yet to turn it into the overwhelming love that I know it could be for the both of us. &nbsp; Why is it so easy to fall in love with somebody on the bus or train?&nbsp; If its someone that makes that powerful of an impression, why do you spend the next couple of days thinking about them and wondering what could be?&nbsp; (sigh)&nbsp; I dont know.&nbsp; Its not like any of this is realistic, yet sometimes it consumes me.&nbsp; Eh, maybe Im just bored on my bus rides and thats why I need to create these mini-melodramas.&nbsp; Either way, I just love a distinguished gentleman in a suit. &nbsp; I guess thats it for today.&nbsp; Im excited to go home and play with my new baby.&nbsp; Ill make sure to give her a kiss from all of you. &nbsp; Have fun this weekend!&nbsp;

 I Just Love These Things Six There are some things in my life that I adore beyond belief. Here is a small sampling of these things. These things Six. Like Six from Blossom. Or like 666 cuz of the debil. Or like-Fuck you then. 1) I adore Miss urlLink Rita Rudner . When I am up way too late or if its a Friday and Ive just gotten in from the bars, the first thing I do is turn on Ask Rita. I find this woman to not only be hilarious, but she is everything that I would want to be as an adult female. She is professional and classy and I love the way she talks. She began her career as a dancer. She had been in numerous Broadway productions before she married her husband and began writing and producing films. Her talk show is wonderful. If you find yourself awake at 2am sometime, tune in and check her out. Shes fabuloso! And she also reminds me of my friend Rita. Now you get the WHOLE picture. 2) It aint macaroni and cheese if its done with anything but Velveeta. YUMSICLE! I make THE best macaroni and chizzle. Its creamy, thick goodness and it has less fat than cheddar cheese! Have you read the box? Velveeta tells no lies. Cook up a pound of pasta, melt in a box of the Velve and you got yourself one extra special good dinner. It sticks to your ribs with satisfaction! I also eat a lot of tacos. Tacos are good. 3) Back in the day I used to love a band called Guster. Over time, I forgot about them, much to my embarracksment. This past weekend, Rita gave me the new Guster cd, Keeping it Together , as a birthday present. It is so super great. I cant stop from playing it over and over and wellover. So far songs #2 and #9 are my flava flave. You will love. And if you dont, then obviously you love pestilence. You eat it and you love it. 4) Im sorry, but The Simple Life 2 is even funnier and more enjoyable than the first. Paul and I have become addicts, which is nice since we dont usually share the same taste in television. Anything that comes out of Paris and Nicoles mouths makes me die laughing. Then, if they are bored, they dont give a fuck, and theyll ruin your life for jokes. Did you happen to see last nights episode when they were trying to find the two boys some girlfriends? Every girl bailed on these two guys and out of nowhere, Paris enters and sits a gay guy down at the table. The two boys looked horrified and had no idea what to say. I shit with laughter and then I beat my dick off furiously. What? I was pissed at my dick. 5) Paul and I have started to download a shitload of musicload on his computerload. Each song is 99cents and since Paul has a million 99cents, I can have whatever music I want! I have been souping up his PC with so much good shit. I found a Rufus Wainwright cover of Across the Universe that makes me so so happy. Im about to create the most amazing mix cd. And then, only then, will I have completed my life goal of burning a cd. I have a cd burner that I got for a Christmas present, but I have yet to figure out how to use it. Now Ill just use Pauls computer and let my burner sit quietly in the corner of my bedroom. Its very pretty when it sits quietly. 6) I love TV. Here is my opinion on the most recent shows to debut. The Amazing Race 3 ? The Amazing LOVE! The Ashlee Simpson Show ? The ashlee I fucking hope you die Show. The Next Action Star ? Eh. Not as good as I had hoped show. Newlyweds ? Ive had ENUFF! All Simpsons should go away forevel and evel amen. Except for Homer, Marge, Bart, Maggie, and Lisa. They are the only characters that give clout to the Simpson name. And theyre cartoons! The Ultimate Love Test ? Oh urlLink Diego . OH Diego. Im not kidding. I fell in love with you the SECOND I laid eyes on you. You are sweet and kind and that body! The show is complete fucking garbage, but Ill stare at you until the day I kidnap you and make you my love slave. HOT DAYIM! hot fucking dayim. For Love or Money ? NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO! Why do I keep watching you? Road Rules: Extreme Challenge ? Why is it that Road Rules has gotten SO much better than The Real World ? Answer: they do challenges which keep them very busy. You dont have to watch a half an hour of them getting drunk and fucking each other every week. And they just booted the gay guy from the show. GOOD! I fucking hate homos. Who Wants to Marry My Dad ? Y A W N. Im sorry, what was that again? Oh yeah, old ugly bitches trying to win the love of a toolbox. In all honesty, I feel as though zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Blown Out ? Jonathan Antin makes for GOOD television. Tune in and see what goes on when he opens a new salon and hires a bunch of primadonnas to run shop. Oh LORD its damn ridiculous. But also guilty pleasure supreme! Bands on the Run ? I didnt even LIKE these bands when they were out (Kajagoogoowhat?), but watching them try to get together for once last concert is just about the most addicting show out there right now. VH1, with this and I Love the 90s , you own me. MTV can SUCK it. Reno 911 ? Damn you for being the funniest show on television. Holy shit you are hysterical. Youre giving my Simpsons a run for their money. Back off or Ill have to break your legs Lt. Dangle. Last Comic Standing ? Sit down you unfunny assholes. I HATE unfunny assholes. I LOVE hairless ones though. PUKE! JOJOs Get Out ? Guilty pleasure #104. I guess thats it for now. Just had to get my opinion out there. You understand. You always understand. You are thoughtful and kind and your cock is huge. Stick it in my mouth and lets take care of business. But if you squirt in my mouth and you dont warn meIm taking a bite out as a keepsake. That will teach you not to dump in my mouth. Great Thursday all!

 Snore Me a River I am honestly in a coma. Its so figures that at 3am, staying up until 4am didnt sound like such a bad idea. All I have to do tomorrow is go to work and then go home and sleep! Lets stay awake forever! Stupid stupid stupid. As soon as I woke up this morning, I thought I had accidentally died and woke up in hell. My head pounded, my stomach churned, and I was NOT happy with the decisions I had made last night. I had a wonderful dinner with my friend Hans. I had the salmon, she had the lollipop wings. I drank a bottle of wine myself, she had a gallon of water herself. We played some games, caught up on old times, and then I hugged her goodbye. Hans is moving out of NYC in two weeks, so this was our goodbye for awhile. Not really sure when I will see her again. But such is life After dinner I went home and surprised Mariah at her apartment. She is leaving today for the Cape and I wanted to be able to spend some quality time with her before the trip. Spend quality time we did. We talked and talked and talked until Paul walked in the door at 12:30am. At that point, things got all sorts of crazy. We played some loud music, jumped around like lunatics, and ate tons of grilled cheese. At 2am, I started to get really tired and Paul begged me to stay awake a bit longer with him. Pauls parents are coming to visit him this weekend. This is the first time his parents have ever come to visit him that I know of. Paul and I have been together for over 4 and years and Ive only even met them once. Both Pauls mom and dad have no idea that hes gay, so Ive had to move my stuff out of the apartment for the weekend. Its a bit upsetting to me that he hasnt confronted this issue with them yet, but we can always hope he will this weekend! And if not, in due time. I may not see Paul again until Monday night, so he begged me to stay up as late as I could with him. That turned into a 4am evening for me. When I got to bed, I was so wired, I just laid there laughing and laughing until I felt the tears start to come. Clearly I was WIPED out. When the alarm went off this morning, my life shrivilved up and died. I clawed the sleep out of my eyes and threw my pimply ass (hork!) in the shower. I nearly fell down from lack of energy. Tonight the cable people are coming to fix my cable box. Fuckers came last Friday when Iwas away and pretended to fix it. Now Ive had to make ANOTHER appointment for them to fix it for real. Stupid bastids. My mom asked me why we have so many problems with our cable while she and my dad have none. I told her that NYC is just one huge hassle. She laughed and then I farted. It was a nice moment. Im making the nicest dinner tonight. Im having onion rings and salad and chicken. It should be pretty good, especially since Ive got nothing else to do. Maybe Ill play some cards online. Ive been horribly addicted to Yahoo Games lately. Im like a Heart playing machizzle. If I lose, my hand clicks the play again button before my mind can stop it. At some point I may need someone to stick my hands in a blender to teach them a lesson. Fucking hands fucking fucker zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. I gotta go.

 Wedding News and Moore First offI have officially completed two of the three weddings I was committed to this summer. Ive got one more in two weeks and then three of my closest friends will be married to their wonderful husbands! The wedding this weekend was beautiful beyond belief. It was very intensive as I met so many of the different family members and did it all on about 6 hours of sleep for the entire trip. The ceremony and the reception were both amazing. The whole thing was just absolutely perfect, save for the 3 hours of pictures we took after the nuptials. That was a rough gocuz I wanted to get my drink on! There was a Real World cast member in the wedding with me. At first, I was floored by the presence of this pseudo-celeb, but by the time Sunday came, the mystique had been destroyed. He was a nice enough guy, but nothing to write home home to mom about. So I wont! My friend Jessica made the most gorgeous bride. She was gracious and fun and made sure to spend some private time with everyone who joined her on her special day. At one point, the song More Than Words came on and Jessica pulled me on to the dance floor. We danced and hugged all throughout our song and it was one of the most precious moments of the entire weekend. I thoroughly enjoyed myself. I actually flew to Syracuse this time. Remind me to do that always. SO much easier. I did check in on urlLink Ari's site this morning and was surprised to find out that she has stirred up quite a bit of political controversy. What are her comments at now? 75? Awesome. To be honest, nothing of what she has written in either the comment section or the actual post offends me. And if it did, I find it hardly my place to jump on the bandwagon of angry commenting. In my opinion, urlLink Ari's site is her site, and it should be kept that way. If you would like to enter into a debate with her, by all means. Otherwise, keep the rude and hurtful comments away. And theres no need to email me asking me for my opinion on it. We obviously know who Im voting for this election. And his name doesnt rhyme with tush. Now, as for Fahrenheit 9/11 which I was overjoyed to see last week I have been a fan of Michael Moore since he first released Roger and Me years ago. His movies can definitely be classified as propaganda. But its GOOD and SMART propaganda and no one asked you to watch it anyway. Now true, Moore definitely has control over the editing room when putting together this movie, but it wasnt like he falsified anything. Bush HAS acted like an ignorant fool for the last 4 years and this movie showcased it. When I saw the video footage of our President sitting in an elementary classroom staring at the floor after he had been told about the first plane crashing into the trade towers, I just shook my head and thought This is the leader WE chose. The one I (personally) voted for. It was disgusting and proved how little control this man actually has over his country. I dont know what I would have done in his position, but then again, I didnt ask to be president. I think that Moore chooses wonderful imagery to reflect his opinion. And opinion is what this movie is. If you didnt know that before, then you are just as ignorant as the star of the movie. If you are someone who hasnt seen the movie, yet still feel as though you can talk in an educated fashion about it, well then, refer to my last comment. The truth of the matter is, everyone is entitled to their own views of the last four years. Moore has just offered his view in the form of a powerful (if not persuasive) essay titled Fahrenheit 9/11 . There is one thing we can all agree on and that is the way he chose to open the movie. Picture thisno visual (a dark screen in a dark theater), just the sounds of the tragedy of September 11th. I started crying at that moment and dont think I stopped until I walked out of the theatre 2 hours later. The truth of the matter is, Bush is not to be blamed for what happened on September 11th. He is a scapegoat just as Saddam was when he entered us into this horribly unnecessary war. But we stand by our president until we have the chance to oust him. Im not saying that Kerry is the ticket to success, but I do believe that Bush has had his turn. Its time for him to step aside and let someone else have a go at it. Whats the worst he could do? Start another war? Whatever happens in this years election, your ONLY responsibility is to vote. I dont agree with Bush supporters, but I am just happy knowing that these people are out there exercising their democratic right. If Bush ends up in the office again, the only thing that will disappoint me will be those people who sat at home watching Maury Povich on Election Day, rather than at the polls. If you want change, vote for it. If you want to debate it, go for it. But understand that EVERYONE is allowed their opinions and they are MOORE than allowed to express themselves. Lets keep it a clean fight, shall we?

 Winfield is coming HOME! On April 20, 2003, my brother, Winfield, was deployed to Baghdad, Iraq. With tears and frustration in my familys hearts, we said goodbye and resolved ourselves to a life of prayer and faith. Even with my dads extensive military background, none of us were prepared for what the next year and a half would bring. My brother was placed in charge of over a hundred men. It was his job to order supplies, keep team morale alive and to patrol the streets of Iraq, in a sometimes failed effort to keep the peace. He has had friends die, roommates die, and he has seen things that no one in my family will ever know about. Because of his incredible work ethic and ability to see projects through to their bitter end, he was promoted twice while there and even netted himself a Bronze Star. The phone calls home were infrequent. Most often my parents would hear from Winfield on a weekly basis. Since he was only allowed 40 minutes a week on the phone, he would spend 20 minutes with his girlfriend and try to alternate the other 20 minutes between my parents and myself. Once in a while I would receive a letter or an email from him, but more often than not, we have relied heavily on CNN and prayer. But now, after a 3 month long extension, he is finally in Kuwait out-processing. My brother called me on my birthday to let me know that he was definitely coming home. I was with Paul at the time, shopping in SoHo. I immediately collapsed into the doorway of a nearby store and just cried and cried. They were tears of joy, tears of exhaustion, and tears of frustration. But could it be over? Could he be finally coming home? On Tuesday morning, my brother called me to let me know that his return home had been pushed off again. With my parents on vacation, it was up to me to call them and let them know that this may not be happening anymore. For the last two days, Ive walked around pretty angry and upset. Its been 15 long months and he was told that hed be there longer?? But this morning, I talked to my parents and its confirmed. Winfield will arrive in NYC on July 26th. He will have two weeks here with us before he has to head back to Germany to fulfill his last obligatory year with the United States military. Its hard to explain how Ive been feeling over the last year. I think its suffice to say that Ive shed buckets of tears, worn away my insides with worry, and pretty much lost hope that Id ever see my brother alive again. Weve missed birthdays and Christmas and Thanksgiving. He hasnt seen a single show Ive done in NYC and I have yet to meet the girl he has been dating for the last two years. There have been memories that Ive had to make without him and laughs that Ive had to share with him from thousands of miles away. But now, I can finally relax. My brother is coming home to be with his family. He is safe. He is healthy. He is ready. Ive never known anyone that has gone through such a difficult challenge and come out on top. He has looked death in its ugly eyes and found the will and the strength to survive it. Not only is my little brother my best friend, he is my hero. Sure, we could sit here for hours and debate the worthiness of the Iraqi war. We could discuss the actions of George Bush and we could argue the rights and wrongs of all of his decisions. But at this point, I just dont care anymore. Winfield CuttheShit is out of Iraq and coming home. There isnt a need for me to analyze this shit anymore. And there isnt a reason for me to continue being angry. This last year of my life has been (by far) the worst. With the grace of God, I have been able to keep my head up, despite all of the sadness and fear that has been coursing in my veins. The tears that I shed now will be out of relief. I will never stop supporting our troops and I will never forget those men and women that are still stuck in the hell hole that is Iraq. My prayers will not stop. They will only change to fit the circumstances. If anything, Ive certainly learned the reality of being a loved one that is left behind during a time of war. It hurts and its scary and I will never ever stop supporting our country and its troops. No matter how difficult it may be. Thank you to everyone who has stood by me over the last year. Your constant prayers and emails and well wishes were exactly what I needed to get through this last year of my life. If there was a way for me to show you how deeply grateful I am, I would. But youll just have to take my word for it. But I can say thank you again, so THANKS TO YOU! Im off to a wedding this weekend. I wont be back until Tuesday. Until then, feel free to entertain yourselves. Or re-read this post over and over so you can actually get a glimpse of how overwhelmed with happiness that I am. My brother is coming home!

 Non-Stop Birthday! What a weekend it was. As you can tell from my lack of posting, I have just crawled out of my hangover today. I cant begin to explain how little sleep I got this weekend. Im still in Zombie mode, but at least the wine headache Ive been carrying around as my baby has finally died. I buried it out back with the other babies Ive killed after the last couple of birthdays. My birthday began on Thursday evening. Paul and I decided to eat sushi and attend the 8pm showing of Farenheit 9/11 . The sushi was incredibly good and I was in the mood to try new things, so thats what I did. If they had a mini-birthday cake made out of seaweed and rice, I would have gotten that too, but alas After dinner, Paul and I walked to the local theatre. On the way there, I heard someone scream You fucking faggots! I looked at Paul and said They couldnt have been talking about us. Were not even walking next to each other. Paul glanced back and saw the guys who were now screaming louder You fucking faggots! Get over here! Two blocks later, I was very upset to see that the scumbags screaming at us had followed us down the street. I stopped walking just in time to see scumbag number one get out of his child molestor van with a CANE. He was in his forties, but hobbled his way over to where I was standing. You motherfucking faggots. I looked him right in the eye and said Do I know you? No, so get the fuck away from us. He became enraged and his friend (Scumbag #2) got out of the van and started approaching us as well. I grabbed Paul by the arm and told him that we should get away as fast as possible. As we walked to the movie theatre, I heard this loser scream Faggots over and over and over. Under Pauls breath he muttered Crippled ass spics. I told him to shut his mouth and walk faster. Finally we arrived at the theatre. Paul and I stood inside and tears filled my eyes. Paul was so angry and I was just upset. It never gets easier being called a faggot by a stranger. The child molester van pulled up outside the theatre and parked. We had to wait 15 minutes for them to leave. After they took off, Paul and I walked home. I was too upset to see the movie. Eventually Paul got me out of my mood and we saw a different showing of the movie at a different theatre. The movie itself was one of the most incredible pieces of artwork I have ever seen. Ill cover that in a different entry. On Friday, Paul took me to buy a new outfit. He spent too much money and it shows. The clothes are beautiful. We had some drinks together and played some games before heading out to a nice dinner. I had the swordfish and Paul had the steak. After dinner, Paul and I had a few more drinks before heading over to My Big Gay Italian Wedding , this new off-Broadway show. I had wanted to see the show and was overjoyed when I found out that we had second row seats. Long story short, the play sucked ASS and we left (along with just about everyone else in the theatre) at intermission. What a grand old piece of stereotypical garbage the play was. The only time I laughed is when the guy from Boy Meets Boy , James Getzalf, tried to act his way out of the cardboard box they placed him in. SUCK SUCK SUCK. SUCK. On Saturday, my friend Angie took me out to brunch and then played a scavenger hunt with me. She had written up all of these clues and I got to run around the city like a crazy person. It was so much fun. At the end, she gave me my presents and we popped a bottle of champagne. Afterwards, we met up with Mariah and Kelly and walked down to the local Lazer Tag place. OH MAN LAZER TAG is so LAME and so FUN at the same time. You arent allowed to run, so we walked hella super fast and shot every little kid we saw. Of course I was yelled at for speed walking, but I didnt care. It was my birthday and Ill speed walk if I want to. After a few rounds of the tag, we all had some drinks and went out to dinner with Paul and a few friends. The food was great, the drinks were great, the conversation rocked. It was an amazing dinner. After THAT, we went back to the apartment, played a few more games (I LOVE games) and went out to Splash bar in NYC. I think we lasted 30 minutes there until I convinced everyone to go home with me to play a few rounds of ASSHOLE. I TOLD YOU I LOVE GAMES! I rolled into bed sometime around 3am. On the Fourth of July, Kelly, Angie, Paul and I went over to our friend Megans place to grill and watch the fireworks. I have never seen a more beautiful fireworks display in my life. From where we sat, atop a rooftop in Brooklyn, I could see all three shows. I held onto Paul as tight as I could and we watched explosion after explosion. Being with my boyfriend for the whole weekend was by far the best part of my birthday. When I got into bed on Sunday night, I collapsed into a coma. All of the drinking and pot smoking and staying up late definitely took its toll. Paul and I had a VERY low key Monday and then on Tuesday I went back to work. PHEW! I finally got all of it down. I must thank everyone that made my day so super special. I have the best friends and boyfriend a guy could ask for. Now I have to wait 360 days until my next one! Ah geez. That is it for today. Ill be back tomorrow with a funnier and more entertaining post. For now, this is all you get. Get it and love it.

 I am now 27(!) Happy Birthday to me! Happy Birthday to me! Happy Birthday dear ever lovable totally gay and cute guy Joey! Happy Birthday to me! Have a great Fourth of Julizzer everyone!

 Haikus of Life For todays post, I have decided to write about some mainstream societal issues that are plaguing our country. In order to do this effectively, I decided to explain myself in Haiku format. If you dont know what a haiku is, let me give you a quick tutorial. The first line must consist of 5 syllables. The second line must consist of 7 syllables. The third line must consist of 5 syllables. Thats it! The last rule of haiku is to have fun. So please enjoy and please follow the rules. The first issue I will be discussing is that of teenage pregnancy: Killing babies fast In time to go to the prom No blood on my dress My next haiku will be on the subject of drug addiction. Put it up your nose Inject it into your arm A life of bullshit As we also know, Michael Jackson is in the midst of a mess involving pedophilia. Its sad really, especially for someone who has accomplished so much in his life as a music superstar. He will fight and fight to clear his name, but I thought I could share with you how I feel about his innocence. You did it, did it. Did it did it did it did Did did did did it With the presidential race looming in the background of our lives, I might as well express my feelings via Haiku. Heres one about the current douche bag in office and heres one about the future douche bag in office. George W. Bush Makes poor decisions all day Unemployment calls John Kerry is nice John Kerry is really nice John Kerry John Kerry nice Were you wondering what I thought about Paris Hilton and Nicole Ritchie? Sure you were. Here gizzles: Why are you famous? Skinny, drug addled goof balls I miss the Ledings Saddam Hussein is now on trial for all of the torture he has caused the Iraqi people over the last couple of decades. It is only fair that I give him his just desserts. You cleaned up real nice But your heart is black and cold Soon you will die, yay To make sure that this post is fair and balanced, I should do a very honest and self-effacing haiku about myself. Here it is, for your viewing pleasure. Why are you so cute? Funny and Sexy and gay You used to be fat Tomorrow is my birthday. I will be 27 years old. My friends have planned a weekend full of activities and my boyfriend (aside from yelling at me for no reason this morning) will be spending some quality alone time with me. I hope this haiku describes my birthday to a T. One year older now You are the boss of your day Hurt someones feelings Isnt everyone a birthday tyrant? I hope I can make everyone happy by running my birthday as a dictator. Dictator Hussein. Cept that I wont get the CHAIR for my tyranny. Unless thats the surprise my friends are talking about. They did tell me to leave out my hair gel and to wet my forehead with a damp cloth before meeting up with them. Interesting So finally, I leave you with one last Haikooze. Ill be back next week with full stories about my weekend. Until thenfuck you! ErI mean, fuck me. I meanah fuck you. Long weekend starts now I will sleep and jerk my dick Birthday cum tastes sweet Say Peace Out everybody! PEACE OUT EVERYBODY!
