 Oh, Fais, I wonder why did you choose that picture? :)

 Exactly my point Vlad! Just like I have described, without trying to listen to the actual topic you are posting your opinion which is an insight about the author, i.e. me. I guess I can extend the list now to some men as well. Nonetheless, I think that a more precise categorisation of people having this kind of reaction doesn't lie in their sexual belongings. It rather depends on the level of self-persuation they have upon their understanding and analysing to a superior level of people they communicate with, and life situations they encounter. Moreover, I stronly believe that it doesn't relate to the level of their arrogance envers others. It may be more of a self-stating reaction, sort of "I too can see people/things". (I'm not trying to offend anyone here, god forbid). Nither I'm in a position of being dumped or insatisfied with my life. I just enjoy sharing some of my thoughts, hoping that someone could share, i.e. appreciate or criticize, my thoughts and observations. Oh, I do apologise if my comparison to "I too can see people/things" may sound shallow, I'm indeed a bit exagerating just to pass a point. Yet, again it doesn't mean that that point is right, so argue if you feel like anything on the latter. God, do you see how many irrelevant, to the actual topic that I have posed a few post ago, sentences I needed to add, in order to clarify my intention not to offend anyone during my discussion, to proove that my subject is actually the one I want to discuss and that it is not hiding my libido experiences according to Freud, nor any other inner problems or something like that. Now, did you already forget the real topic? I wouldn't be surprised if you did. That's how much of disturbing bla-bla I think I needed to add in order to convince, for instance, Vlad, that he doesn't need to do my psycoanalysis here; rather, he can say if he has noticed similar reactions in people or not, or, if he didn't pay any attention. Is that really that hard to believe that someone simply wants to discuss something without trying to proove a point to others?? Is that really that hard to accept that one may just want to hear your opinion on the subject posed, and not to hear you say that that subject is bullshit and that the author is having problems?? I know, that's the answer with no effort what-so-ever, and with lack of respect to the author as well. Finally, having said all that, you may think that I'm mad or upset. Not at all. I was just diverged into thoughts upon some reactions of people in some circonstances. If someone feels that I'm trying to describe anyone in particular, YOU ARE WRONG. Of course, the traits mentioned abouve are found in most of people, including ME and YOU in different instants of life. Don't take it personal, and don't assume that I'm generalising or categorising. Life is more compex than the single instanteneous pulsations I'm bringing your attention to here (duhh). Did I really have to say all that bla-bla?? I feel emptied and dissapointed since I have grearly diverged my self from the original interesting obserbation I have made, and since now it's impossible to continue the topic I wanted to discuss because you're probably eager to reply to what I have wrote here, which to me personnaly doesn't represent significant interest, because I feel I can anticipate the way it will uncover itself. (Or surprise me)

 Either the video was meant for russian non-blog posters, or, for all non-russian nonblog-posters in an attempt to leave them confused,dumbfounded and with a tiny tingle of guilt. Whatever the intention was, it was quite clever and successful.

 As for the people who don't post, I have urlLink one thing to say...

 urlLink Once again. Now that I re-read your post... did you get dumped again or something? Oups, sorry, I mean... she must have become boring in bed, you told her you didn't love her, she became depressive and you had to tell her to fuck off and stop following you... And now you have this gorgeous 26-year-old to take care of...

 Ya, school essay, good idea :)

 Hey, pretending being a philo has nothing to do with it. And Vlad, you didn't get it right. I'm just trying to describe to you an observation I made while talking with 19 to 26 year old women in France one on one, and who all had similar symptoms of holding a conversation. Moreover, it conserned only a certain kind of topics, where I would have to, at some point, explain to them some things that are in relation to their lives, or to lives of people they can relate to. During other topics particularly where one doesn't see a direct application of the propelled ideas to their routine, which would consist in an effort, the evoqued mind processes didn't seem to be an interesting matter for noticing, since during those moments, I was deeply absorbed by the actual topic of the conversation. Another thought: talking with men usually (or practically always) consists of being involved in the topic of conversation, which disregards the idea of thinking about something else meanwhile. In conclusion, an easy excuse not to continue the discussion upon my observation would be simply to call the topics resulting in answers in question "sentimental bullshit", yet, I would disagree with this statment, because it is based on a momentary logically derived generalisation. I promise there is more to it than that. As a future perspective, I could suggest to try to observe similar reactions in canadian women (or men), it's not really hard. An example could be the british lady writing feminist comments regarding Vlad's posts in January on his site.

 Fight, fight, fight... guys, don't you fucking pretend to be smart ass philosophers. What, you have nothing to talk about? What one can understand form this dialog is that two drunk idiots are trying to put two words together in an attempt of creating a school essay (not so hard on the punctuation, btw).

 Do you mean it's the idea that I'm willing to communicate to the public I'm referring to by approaching a point about morals in the audience? Or is it the audience that communicates an insight about the point I critisize that persuades the otherwise incompetent public? If any of the above is true, then the only insight I'm getting from your oral and written communications is that you can't build a normal sentence. And when my convoluted mind elaborates on the said insight, I tend to conclude that you can't think clearly either. People who can't think clearly should not be trusted.

 ... Some people have persuaded me that any communication (verbal or written) gives the person you are communicating to, first of all, an insight into YOUR being (your problems, belifs, wishes, morals, etc), especially if you're trying to approach a point about your audience, rather than the idea that you are willing to communicate to them. It somehow seemed that through entire monologues (short or long) they were thinking how to answer or critisize seldom points chosen in your idea, while being or permanently convinced in their proper opinion, or setting aside their opinion on the topic in question (related to your lisnener or people he relates to), or, sometimes, even ignoring that the existence of latter. Finally, their answer was composed of either comments on the seldom parts randomly assembled, either on introducing a more global opinion upon my seeing of the topic, yet all the time it ended in imposing their opinon (idea, long comment, etc) on ME, and in the worst case in suggestions of what I need, should, could, and must. I just find it an amusing and educating in some sort observation. Curiously, here I'm reffering to mostly women aged 19 to 26 of various backgrounds and nationalities, well brought up and educated, and with whom I had the chance to experince this observation more than once and on various levels. With men it may be a bit different but I can just make assumptions and pattern matching, since I haven't been in search of experimental data (except myself and rarely my friends). But I'm not denying anything. ...

 Cool; a part of it indeed touched some common references to myself and maybe to others while being an article for a large public. (Why do I feel that this sentence sounds pejorative). Anyhow, it's an interesting article.

 So what if people from your high school work at MacDonald's? Am I supposed to apologize or something? Are you some kind of a standard reference of "success" that we all ought to adhere to? Also, ANdrei, as I was skimming through some urlLink articles on a weekend, I remembered you. I don't know why, really.

 By the way, did you know that John Kiriakis (the smart dude from Mech eng.) is a manager at McDonnald's? As well as some other people I know from my ex-high school who are working as manages at some of those 'Fast places' mentioned, and who are keeping those jobs as the clean part-time good fast student cash. Anyhow, it's not a worthy topic of discussion (I find). Besides that, I passed all my exams and all my courses, exept one that I'm going to declare as "dropped" and to which I never went and doesn't count. I'm also quite sick. My throat is desguasting and I'm going to probably take some antibiotics. Later!

 Well, since everyone is so obsessed with comics lately, here's my masterpiece. I bet you liked the suspense with the door.

 Thanks Mulanda. I am pretty relaxed this semester. Timely studying is the best way to avoid stress altogether. I know it sounds hypocritical, but that's the way it is. It's all about will power. Waj, I normally allow those people to use their opportunity to be stars for a minute or two. You know, poor guy is a manager at Tim Hortons. What is he going to see in his life? Let the kid be the boss. I believe in the random act of kindness. Which brings me to my next useless monologue.. Those uber eager Tim Hortons (McDonald's, Dunkin Donuts, Second Cup etc.) managers are also very interesting from a rookie observational philosopher's (i.e. mine) point of view. The funny thing about these people is that those who they boss around will on average be far better off in life than them. Many of us here had done some shitty filing/serving/dishwashing at some point; and it's OK for a fast-cash temp student job... But if you find yourself "promoted" to be a manager at McDonald's, I suggest you be very, very scared. Arrogant as it may sound, we all think that way deep inside. Of course, all people fulfill their own very important duties in the society, but... you know... P.S. Wajdi, and Faisal, send me your pics please.

 ha! ha! ha! you guys are so funny you deserve an Academy award..Vlad, take a deep breath and relax, school is not supposed to be a burden but rather a flower in the sun- whatever that means (???)-- Wanna say hi to our french blogger and the concordia bloggers.

 Well Vlad, I completely agree with you. I am not going in to detail about my experiences. So we will leave that topic as is... Well, lastnight me and a few friends went bowling and daaaaaaamn it went nuts. There was a Harvey's there and well some of my friends wanted to eat, so they ordered food, and the girl at the cash threw the money back at them and said, "this is fake, I am not going to take it" and she went NUTS!!!! she ran to the back and wanted to call the cops, but the bill was real, we got it checked at another counter. The girl was MESSED!!!! and then some chump who decided to be the big boy in all of this, comes to "control" things, but ends up annoying everyone cause of his macho attitude. I took one look at him and just laughed, he was wearing a dress shirt, tucked in to his TRACK PANTS!!! (no offence to anyone who does that, but I just find it wrong). Yeah, so long story short, she refused to let anoyone of us order food and she would make a crying fit about it to not serve us. So yeah, that was GREAT!!!!!!!

 yeah right, you pathetic looser

 You suck Vlad. We gotta celibrate. Besides, who needs money to have fun?? I say, lets get together this week sometime to fool around. Something like on tomorrow, or on thursday. Meeting at Caf� l'Etranger (St-Cathetine in front of Cenre Eaton) at either noon (or 13:00) or around 16:00 o'clock. Then we'll take a walk or a ride to Vanier, or simply hang around downtown like in the old days. Cheers! See you on thursday! Oh, yeah, somene needs to call lazy bloggers like Doris, Viv, Hos�e and others. Happy Birthday everybody! For those who can't make it tomorrow or on thursday, then meeting this week-end (Friday, Sartuday or Sunday) again around noon, unticipating the heavy 20-&-something years weighting on our sholders and stopping us from partying at night, at something like Piano Bar!

 No, man. My entertainment budget is running kind of low. So, I'm out... Plus, there is this attention-dependent thing... what's it called... ah.. MOTHRFUCKINGSCHOOLPIECEOFATROCIOUSREPUGNANCYFUCKYOU. The minute I get my admission from C. (if ever), we will drink so hard -- our grandma's gonna feel it, as Audrey would put it..

 oh my god! when i read the 1st blog i was getting shivers. nice memories...yeah we should definitely celebrate.

 hm.... we should celebrate.

 Ait folks. urlLink March 31 is the official Lounge anniversary.

 Wow, Mr. Lion King, is getting closer to a warthy crown :) So is it a good place to research some breasts, the J.G.? :) And who is your 'assistant'? Somehow I get a feeling that not everything is cristal clear with your so-to-say bio study research intentions. :� vlad, remember you proposed to plot lounge's activity as a function of time on a year cycle? It seems to be quite constant from year to year.

 Yeah, it used to be the same in the former USSR. But you don't get 4 months off though... Heh, who do you think I saw today? The Lion King! He does breast research at the Jewish General, ya know. His "research assistant" was with him. Well, I shall say that Mr. Zagombe certainly has style when it comes to "research interests".

 I miss england and the english school system... Not only do you get break after each semester (or term as it is called in england) you also get a week ever half-term... great eh?

 so, are you all veging in Mtl? Danny, did how many orgazms did you get while yelling "Go States"? Did you know masturbation makes hair grow on you palms? Stop looking at them. Who is doing what this summer? How's preparation for finals? I'm going to have a 2 week spring break starting next friday.

 Ok folks, all is good now.

 I HATE people who persist in doing what they absolutely CAN'T DO! Or people who keep on slamming their heads through the wall knowing its painfull; actually it's their problem if they do, but pleeeeease don't whine about it!

 test

 Bear with me guys. Everything will be normal soon.

 GOOOOOOOOOOOoooooooo States!!!!!! :)

 I can't see anything more ironic than this. Pentagon claims that showing POW on TV violates Geneva Convention. Now, read that again.

 Of course, John. I was going to officially thank you when everyhting would be done :). But yeah, the hosting and all the magic I will be able to do here later is courtesy of John!

 And yet... no mention of the person who's making all of this possible.... MMMMMEEEEEEE!!!!! Typical Vlad style :P

 The site will be moving over the weekend. Some shortcomings are likely during the DNS record propagation. Nothing will change in the blogging process itself. In May, though, expect a complete upside-down. We will be converting to urlLink Movable Type , baby, yeah. Posting here will become more convenient, robust and centralized. No more blogger-dependence. There will be a login page right here on vladster.com. I know you're excited. By the way I've been to Vanier. It's still there, in case you're wondering.

 why ins't somebody posting some pacifist whining already ?

 Does anyone have any experience buying stuff from ebay? Like laptops?

 Wow, looks like my kind of fun. :) Well, here when I go to class minding my own business, people who pass by... pass by minding their own business. Pretty funky, huh? Political, cultural and general apathy reigns here despite the small group of people trying to imitate the non-existent ghost community of fun-lovin' beer-drinkin' song-singin' engineers. Mind you, living in an apathetic community is not necessarily a bad thing. Everyone needs to be alone sometimes. I actually enjoy this side of McGill. I have conducted a personal quest for public opinion during the past few weeks, and let me tell you, the results are somewhat surprizing. Many people here in the ECE are here for the glory. Most don't yearn to design circuits upon graduation. Some want to do MBA, others Law. The rest continues because it would be a shame to switch after 3 years. Of course, there are a few bright sonovabitches who do well no matter what. I didn't get any intelligible feedback from them due to the language barrier. I have yet to discover a source of such a strong drive to study. And then there is Ivan.

 Hey Vlad, just a little preview of what lies ahead for you in Concordia. This morning, I was going up to my class minding my own business when I see this naked guy running down the hallway, with "Art Matters" written on his chest. (And people with cameras taking pictures of him and everybody screaming). These arty manifestations are much better than the political ones.

 Yo, Concordia is featured on the russian urlLink tourist website .

 ok, ppl post wallpapers, hmmm.. ok, I'm gonna post some more media, that is mp3s I dug out last week, pretty cool stuff... urlLink >>>THERE

 ok, well not to be outdone by vlad... Here's the urlLink wallpaper I made for Jess and I. Feel free to use it as you wish

 Here's a urlLink wallpaper for the adventurous types among you. I made it for myself, but, no doubt, there are funky enough dudes and and dudettes that will appreciate the stylishness of ZAZ-69. Parental advisory is suggested.

 bHAHAHAHAH! HA.

 check this out! The lounge was found on google by someone, after typing this: You high, baby?Yeah...Yeah?(HUh-huh...I think you want me baby, I think I want you too...

 It took two years of frustrating self-persuasion and slippery studying habits. Lack of interest lead to surface learning and introduced my once spoiled elitist mind to the dreadful world of mediocrity. A desperate urge for a strong decision was amplified by maturing process and discovery of genuine interests in life. I hope that answers the question. :)

 Vovka! I have a question. What did it take you to decide to change programs? I mean pschologically...

 Hey yo, welcome new bloggers, it's been a while. Well, practically nothing new here, my mid terms start tomorrow. Read some really cool books. And I'll look into your recommendation Fais. Vlad, I'll try to send you some pic of mine, the one posted has embarrased me for long enough. Other news... I'm staying in France untill at least 1st of august. Last Sunday I visited the cemetory of St-Genevieve de Bois. Saw tumbes of Ivan Bunin, Rudolf Nureev, Tolstoys, Iusupovs, cadets of Tcar, Trotckih, etc. Makes me realize what we (Russians) have lost. Also met some Russian people in Paris. Lyed that I'm Canadian-Russian and spoke French to them. Disgracefull. Vlad, if you feel like switching out of Engineering, I say go for it. Jeka, congrads, hope to see you do the same at Bercy. Later.

 The Art of War as in The Art of War ? Or is it the reinterpreted "modern" translation of Sun Tzu for American homemakers ?

 Lecture recommand�- The Art of War by Sun Tzu , The Dancing Wu Li Masters by Gary Zukav and Fermat's Enigma by Simon Singh

 Don't worry Vlad. Let me handle my business :-P Most likely I will still have the p2 tower around. The sooner the better with the money... I owe McGill too you konw... catch you on MSN later.

 Other than that, how's everyone doing? It's been a long time we havent seen any school-related bitching. I guess it'll start pretty soon. How are the midterms and stuff? Mulanda, do you like your new pic? Jeka, I'll change yours soon. Irina, I'm still awating yours.. Bibi, Waj, vai no post so long?

 Wow John! That's real sweet! I'll email you. I would suggest you consult with your partners though.. As for the p2 tower, I'll be able to give you a price in May-June, if you still have it by then.

 After some thought. I decided that it'd be fine to host your domain Vlad. If and when you are ready to move. Let me know

 The lounge will stay as is for now. I will consider MT for my blog when I have some time to burn. Iframes is a good idea.

 Yeah... Decided to go with MT in the end. It's not that bad on server resources, probably because their code is pretty refined. Anyways Vlad, if you want, I can setup your blog stuff over on my site. You can use iframes to display the blog on your domain. It has a very nice admin panel and all that. Let me know.

 Yes, I'm still a proud owner of Satriani's full anthology, including "Strange Beautiful Music", as well as a couple of other virtuoso guitarists. Check out Vinnie Moore, Eric Johnson, check out Steve Vai, you might like it, there is also "Liquid tension experiment" if i'm not mistaken, it's an album written by some of the best guitarist from various bands, so it might be cool. Al Di Meola is nice too. there is a load of this kind of music anyhow.

 Yo, Roman, do you still listen to Joe Satriani? I'm rediscovering him over and over. Congrats to the Salsa Man!!! Way to go, John. So you use MT after all.

 Ladies and Gents. I would like to congratulate you with the 8th of March, I hope you had some good time.

 Hello all, just got back from Boston. Shit that place rocks. I met some really good people and had a blast. Oh yeah, and also i won 1st place beating a bunch of american college students (harvad, mit,...). Ok sorry, i'll be modest from now on, just really happy. later P.S. Vlad, change my picture please, tell me if you need another one...

 Seeing the sucess of Vlad's weblog, I decided to make my own (shameless, I know)... so here it is: urlLink http://www.revolutionhosting.net/john/blog/ It's just started so don't expect too much. There's only 2 entries so far. Feel free to make comments though (I have that function turned on)... I will add more link and for sure more entries as time go on.

 I just did urlLink this and urlLink this What do you guys think?

 OH NOOOO! Please send me another one! Pretty pretty please.

 haha, very funny Vlad. Well, since you already have this picture, you might as well use it.

 No idea. This blogger thing has been fucked lately. I'm looking into alternatives.

 Damn, man, where do you get mp3s fast ? I'm tired of looking for Therion albums (symphonic heavy metal muzax) are there any ftps or anything ? Kazaa sucks big time

 hey john, wassup boy! long time no talk, maybe sometime we can play chess again, kick ur ass!! muwahahah Faisal

 :) thank you Vlad... Anyone uses MSN? add me please. johnyu82@hotmail.com Although don't send anything there, it'd most likely gets deleted. Anything you want me to read, send it to johnyu@revolutionhosting.net

 Welcome John :) Andrei where are you? I want to hear your condemnation of my chosen life path. Seriously, I never knew I would have the guts to do this.

 Hey guys!! John Yu here... nice to see everyone around. Got my own server and hosting business. Decided to give Vlad some free hosting. Any of you interested (perferablly paying hosting) let me know. Anyways, got a new digital camera (well, Jess brought it for me for Xmas) and took some pictures. Including our trip to quebec over the spring break. Anyhow, here's the link to the gallery. urlLink http://www.revolutionhosting.net/john/gallery login: guest password: guest. Login is at the top right corner. If you login you see more galleries. Have fun :)

 ha! ha! ha!...looks like someone got his head hit by an apple pretty hard....Vlad, I always knew you were crazy...Mcgill to Concordia?! I am gonna have fun with this

 As an incentive for people to send me their pics, I will put this up for a little while:

 Wow, wow, wow. I'm not joining anyone yet, and easy there with super-duper. I'm not THAT converted yet. It takes time, you know. I'm still a McGiller. Yeah, Fais... a return to innocence . From a brand new spankin' scratch. Ladies and gents, it's time for an introduction... Please welcomen Irene as brass_monkey. A picture is to follow, I guess. Short summary: Comp. Eng., that other school, blond but sharp.

 motherfucker...you're gonna join me at the super duper cool John Molson School of Business. Well, i think that the most appropriate thing to say right now is "if you need any books don't hesitate to ask"...joke

 Hey, for all of you physics lovers: Isaac Newton, traditionaly viewed as the pillar of the age of Reason acually had profound metaphysical inclinations. In fact, his discoveries were born not of simple scientific curiosity, but a desire to unravel the mysteries of God's creation and God's Will. He spent over 50 years trying to decode the bible using elaborate time charts and even predicted the end of the world for the year 2060. So we still have about 57 years left :) . . . . . I say, that apple hit him pretty hard. for more details: www.newton-project.ic.ac.uk

 Wow! I can't believe what I'm reading! Don't worry Vlad, we'll take good care of you...but ( for your own safety) the McGill bag has to go.

 I hear sirens blowing, I see balloons flying as well as confetti floating all around. Could this be the return of the prodigal son?

 Well, my friends. Watch this. I have thought A LOT about my miserable situation. I have spoken to people from different domains of study and of different opinions. For now, I have come to the conclusion that it can't go on like this anymore. I feel like sharing this with you. The only person who knows about it right now is Audrey... Tomorrow I will fill out the online applicaion form to Management Information Systems Co-op at Concordia University. Yes. You heard it right. I looked at their curriculum, and let me tell you, that's just what I want. Electrical Engineering here at McGill is an excellent program, but I'm clearly not made for it. I don't want to stare at BJT's and FET's and God knows what else for another semester, let alone the remainder of my lifetime. I need change. McGill has been very helpful in discovering what I really want in most popular mathematical method: proof by contradiction. All of the above notwithstanding, it is not the time for the applause yet. Since I'm a little past the application deadline, I'm not sure if they'll consider me. It's a "competitive" program you know. What do I know about "competitiveness".. Damn, I feel old and weary. Thanks to all for support.

 Wow, Roman, you might wanna copyright that.

 i'll go eat some fucking poutine

 The Mongolian Spirit

 Just one more. One last mutherfucking exercise in surviving atrocity. One last faked comment to the prof. Just one more.

 Hristos voskres! Or Happy Easter orthodox blog population. It seems to be quite quiet here... One post per day... Anyway, I'll do as usual little news broad cast about my recent pass times. Last week got back to school, (which is not the same as back to study, :( , I can't concentrate on exam preparation ) . Nothing special happened through the entire week; just having a smooth relationship with my girlfriend ( a flash back: we're together since november and had time to break up 6 times, :), amusing). This week end worked, bought colored eggs and an easter russian bread. Also went to church on Sartuday night for the entire night for the mess. Sunday spent my day fooling around in the streets of Paris with a friend of mine; in the afternoon went to an Easter celebration to an Estonian girl's appartment; met russian speaking people, including an African russian speaking girl working at the Military-police division of national security - run away... (just kidding). It was a sympathic afternoon with 'pirojki', wine, egg hittings, dansing laughing talking, flurting and listening to various music. In the evening watched some TV, ate, experienced my girlfriend coming over, then after her leaving - slept, 7 hours. It's the maximun of time I have for sleeping since mid march. :((. Often it is more like 5-6 hours per night. I'm not complaning, just feel like sharing that I may be changing ... my habbits. Now, I'm supposedly working, but taking a break. So my leds and gents, I also think that I'm loosing my english (now I need to do spell check for many words while typing something this long of blog. A pity). Yet, since I'm not sure how often people read this page, then I guess it's not a big of an embarassement. Alrighty, take care you all, and Bon Courage ! Yours,

 On this day, 25th of April 2003, at this very moment, I am considering myself free again for another 4 months. Even though finals didn't go smoothly, i.e. I can already see my GPA dramatically decrease with an accelerating speed, I am saying this with all the pride: SCHOOL IS OVER!!!. Once everyone's finished, I am buying a nice and sexy looking bottle of Moskovskaia, so we can all enjoy the orgasm of having her (let's have a party that is...) So don't be jealous, study hard, and good luck my children. Amen!

 Read: 4000 childen working 16 hours a day for 10 cents a week.

 Ha, Viv. Funny... I mean congrads, etc; however, I still have one month of studing and then 2 weeks of exams. During these moments I do somewhat regret that I'm not back in Canada, slaking off from start of May... Oh, here a job offer I saw: Objet : recruitment Dear Sir, We �re looking for Chinese graduates for REXAM Beauty & Closures, which is a sector of Group REXAM.

 hm...

 aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A- A-A-A-A-A-A-A-A- A-A-A-A!!!!!

 hm...

 Hi, guys! Seeing as I am officially on vacation as of 4 pm yesterday, I feel it is my duty - being such a good friend, and all - to gloat about the fact that I am currently slacking off at home, while the rest of you slog through exams...^_- Anyway, just thought I would share that happy thought with you all! Mulanda - no te procupes, estoy disfrutando MUCH�SIMO de mis vacaciones. Buena suerte.

 Wow, this place is turning truly international. . . In the past two years, we have had our representatives reporting from France, Germany, Switzerland, Kazakstan, USA and what not. I really like the way it's going. What pleases my intellectual aesthetism * the most is the fact that we are now observing a drastic jump in semantic richesse of the posts. Let's keep up the tradition. It won't be too long untill we will all disperse in different directions. With due persistence and participation, this blog has a chance to become something unique. * this word is under copyright. vladster.com, 2003.

 Heh... Man, I'm coming to the end of my vacation, and the on the first day of back-to-school they're going to shove up my ass a math test. I'm really thankful. Anyway, let's talk about good things..:) Within last week I visited Verdun (by Bar le Duc and the battle fields of the 1st world war, impressive, sad and astonishing... wow). Then I went to Francfort for a two days. Looks like Montreal a lot. People are nice, speak German and English, and in other views very sympathic city. Then it was Geneva... and the Cirque du Soleil. I'll tell about it later cause I gotta run. Now I'm in Annecy and returning to Paris tomorrow afternoon. Cheers!!!!!!!!!! everybody! :*

 Got in my e-mail: "You know the world is going crazy when the best rapper is a white guy, the best golfer is a black guy, the tallest guy in the NBA is Chinese, the Swiss hold the America's Cup, France is accusing the US of arrogance, Germany doesn't want to go to war, and the 3 most powerful men in America are named 'Bush', 'Dick', and 'Colon'!" kifunda, the king

 hahaha...

 Hey caliente ! I can hear your bed springs going loose, boing boing. Exams will commence, people will die. Ye! After my first exam, I'll recreate a scene and tell you aaaaaalllllllll about it.

 hm... could you please list a few other teachers whom you had .

 And the finals shall begin, my children... God bless you and have the best of the most of the luck that you can only wish yourself, if you still believe in passing. Oh, I just remembered something that can be very motivating for finals. Once upon a time, the most amazing teacher I ever had, aka Krishan Bhatia, said: "You can't pass my friens, you can only improve your failing grade..." So keep it in mind!

 I feel so much relieved now. I feel like byuing a ninja sword and slaughtering you and anyone else who is also done with their finals . The thought is funny actually. If someone quickly and acurately chops youe head off, you will see your own body going down in convulsions on your head's way to the gound. I find that kind of fascinating and something one has to see before he is dead. Well, now you know how good I feel.

 I'm done with my finals. Three hardest exams are over. I feel so much relieved now.

 Andrei, I changed you pic, but it kinda sucks. I did all I could, but the original image has virtually no color, and the quality of scanning is not great... So, if you're not satifsied, send me another one. Good luck everyone on your respective finals.

 tuta tipa vsie spiat chto-li, A? Yo, a worthy discussion... Ye, I really feel inspired after stearing for 5 hours at this dull dell screen. Schiza, bitches! I'm outta hea, gotta go puke. Why? Have no clue. Shit.

 urlLink Things Andrew Had No Intention of Telling Hannah

 Well, I'm reading this book instead of properly wasting my time solving circuits. And, let me tell you, I'm learning a hell of a lot from the ideas of a Polish guy named Korzybski. Roma, you might have heard of this man when you read stuff on neurolinguistics. The book is called "Language, Meaning and Maturity". Despite the obnoxious title, it offers a diversified compilation of works on General Semantics (not to be confused with Semantics). I found this book discarded outside the Dawson College library, and I suddenly see the problem with the society throwing away such books, if you forgive me my elitist whining. Here's a quotation. Ladies and gents, please be so kind as to let me know what you think about it. This blog craves for a worthwhile argument. ... Our sanity is connected with correct symbolism. And naturally, with the increase of sanity, our "moral" and "ethical" standards would rise. It seems useless to preach metaphysical "ethics" and "morals" if we have no standards for sanity. A fundamentally un sound person cannot, in spite of any amount of preaching, be either "moral" or "ethical." (...) The abuse of symbolism is like the abuse of food and drink; it makes peope ill, and so their reactions become deranged. Alfred Korzybski.

 By the way, Russian pop, do you read www.irak.ru They have some inetersting analysis.

 Oh, yeah, I'm still in Paris, it was just some of April's first fooling around. :))

 I think in such issues more than 80% of the opinion depends on the listener.

 The Q92 radio station. A completely irrelevant entity with obscure marketing strategies. They play unpardonably corny music; so, even when they put something good, you don't take them seriously. Some people are like the Q92 radio station with the volume put to max and the dial missing.

 What's wrong? Are your balls to small to get that I'm visiting MTL?? :) I'm here for my spring break, staying at my parents house. Call me when you can. I came back yesterday and will be here for a week. Oh, yes, I'm meeting my sister today at 1:00 pm in the Second Cup, the one on McGill College street right near the McGill gate. So if you can make it there from 13:00 to 14:00 it would be very cool. Or call me at home. Cheers! See you soon! By the way, open your eyes Vlad, who is the looser? I didn't come here to have a fight with you. And I'm serious about celebrating.

 Ah, ok...funny

 hey vladmeister, toronto sounds so far so good. its not too bad here in yul. Hey when u guys are back, we must, no, it is instrinsically of the utmost importance that we have a get-together. been long time havent seen your sad faces. i have only my schedule to blame. in the meantime, montreal ppl anything this weekend?

 Well, life has been pretty hectic here in the Greater Toronto Area. Job search, interviews, more job search, more interviews etc. So far I have found nothing that would take my fancy. Ahem. I guess that means nothing at all. But (for once in my life) I am not giving up! Audrey is fine, but she has her own account here, so she can write for herself. I drove a Ford Explorer to the mall the other day, and let me tell ya: I understand the SUV owners now. The size does matter indeed. Coming back to Montreal is in the planning. Maybe two weeks from now. The car is doing good. I am almost in love with it. It seems that it works on air. I have only filled it once after arriving here, and the fuel indicator has hardly moved ever since. That's all the news that anyone would care about... I'll write more as the desperation progresses.

 Hey guys, just wanted to say Hi and wish everyone a Merry Summer..I haven't heard or seen a lot of you guys in a while, except for Viv.."let's not go there".

 Hello all! Viv, how can salsa caliente not be alive. Yes I am alive and enlyoing it all the way. It is great to see that there is still some action here. Let's keep this blogger thing a place of constant communication, like a hot news line... For example, reporting from Toronto this afternoon, the weather conditions seem quite favourable, whereas in Paris rain is dominant...like whatever. Oh Viv, it's really cool that you went to see Dralion, I'm going too. I have made some impossible plans for this summer like going to California and to Paris with a two week interval between the two trips. Today I'll go find out for the tickets and stuff, but it's not like I have money to pay them yet...what's new? So how are you people doing? Let's give each other news. Vlad, Adrey did you get settled in TO???? Alright, catch you later dudes.

 Wazzup, guys?! Haven't seen any of you in what seems like an aeon (no, that's not spelled incorrectly - check the Oxford!) - except for Mulanda...let's not go there...Salsa caliente, are you still alive?????? Andrei, glad to hear you had a great b-day. Are you sure it was only ONE bottle of champagne..^_-? Vlad, Audrey, I had NO idea you were leaving for Toronto so soon! I guess our karaoke night will have to wait - unless you plan on coming back for a weekend here and there. Things are good at the lab so far - haven't blown anything up, caused any major hazourdous waste spills or environmental disasters - yet...They don't call me Pyro-Viv for nothing...^_- Went to see Dralion (Cirque du Soleil) the other night. Absolutely amazing! If any of you can get tickets, it's a definite must see. Right, so that's about it from my neck of the woods - my German class does not bear mentioning. Audrey, you would be sooooo ashamed...Ich bin ein dummkopf... I'm sure Andrei would get great pleasure out of that statement if he had any idea what it meant.^_- Take care all,

 Had my b-day on the 24th. It was like a old style russian party: lots of food, drinks, and talking. The only things that were missing are the actual Russian people (except for me and my sis), drunk people, songs, candles on my b-cake (how could I forget to buy some??) So now I'm 21, and I think that it's the time to stop counting age (woooooooo-uuuuuuuu! some one could say) Well, that's how I feel. (it doesn't imply that I feel old). As gifts I got cloth, a bottle of good champaign, money, a book, and wird rules of playing chess... Alright. Later.

 finally accessing the internet after two weeks due to technical malfunction is like surfacing to the top of the lake gasping for air.

 Yo dudes, the "point de rencontre" will be my B-day in September...

 Ya, sua dude :) Just say when and where you'll come to Mtl, or maybe we can actually move our asses to Ottawa to see how you a doing :). Cheers!

 hELLO. Summer... wtf, you guys at least get to chill a little, i'm gonna be working my ass off in a restaurant as a cook's assistent (reminds me of god damned camp pripstiens) Well, at least I'll make enough money to pay my rent and prevent starvation. ' Cheers. P.S. How about we get together some time after this summer..? Anyone?

 Andrei, I'm still working on it, don't worry. I got your message, so I'll be able to confirm more details by the end of this week probably...

 Another thing, my sister is coming to visit me tomorrow!!! YAY! I never knew I would be so happpy to see my sister! :)

 Oh, yeah, does anyone read this thing anymore? Well, stupid question, at least I do. Who's what, where, when, why for this summer? I'm still here till mid-august, working, travelling, filming, but before all that doing my exams untill 15th on June...

 Jeka, so? Are you finally coming here in august?

 Alright dudes, I hate to do this, but... due to very technical circumstamces (which will be explained later) I won't make it to Cheers on Saturday. I hope everyone will have fun...

 I hope to get something more exciting.

 not a chance.

 Sounds like your future job description, Andrei. Reading about your career choices?

 E-eee-ee-uuh. Do you always have to spoil every thought and put it up side down?? here, does this make you feel like working hard to make your dreams come true? "Au sein de l'�quipe process, vous explorez, proposez et mettez en oeuvre de nouvelles technologies m�caniques de pr�cision, de soudure basse temp�rature, de collage et de moulage. Vous assurez le support technique des ateliers de production par analyse des disfonctionnements et production et mise en oeuvre d'autres correctives. Vous participez � la formation des op�rateurs de production, �laborez et mettez en place la documentation de production."

 Saturday it is then. Say, 10 o'clock? I like the quotation. It's a perfect justification for procrastination. I guess I'll wait for my "sunshine and light."

 Hmmm sounds very tempting for Cheers, I got my all marks back, finished with B+ average , my best semester so far, reallllllyyyyyy happy We'll try to do better next time.-----Woodrow Wilson - �We grow great by dreams. All big men are dreamers. They see things in the soft haze of a spring day or in the red fire of a long winter's evening. Some of us let these dreams die, but others nourish and protect them; nurse them through bad days till they bring them to the sunshine and light which comes always to those who hope that their dreams will come true.� -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Smile guys

 bummer. saturday night bad fo me. alright then, we'll meet someother time. until then , cheers!

 Let's make it Saturday night no? I heard Kato and Mulanda wanted to go to Cheers... So, I'm for that.

 np vlad, meh cant tuesday night, how about wednesday night? and also where? everyone come, we'll have a 'ball' of a time, pleh

 Thanks Fais. What interests me more, however, is the first question. How does the body know where the outer contour should be? Let's say there is an big openning in the skin, it will be reconstructed and levelled off with the rest of the body. How does the body know where to stop regenerating the tissue so it doesn't bypass the surrounding area? Is there some kind of comparison going on? The reason I'm asking is that I don't think DNA would contain that information. When the person gets fat, the DNA doesn't change, but the reconstruction of the skin will still undergo up to the level of surrounding skin.. Anyway, that's my lay Sunday-afternoon thoughts. Does it show the school is over for me? :) How about tuesday night? It's eldorado[at]vladster.com. Roma, I'll put your pic up soon.

 hello all. All exams are over about half a week ago so yes!! life is good! so vlad , ur question, well this is how it works or to the best of my knowledge. When u have damage on skin,such as big opening, it does amaze to see how come the body reconstructs that gap but can not reconstruct an amputed arm. It does seem logical that it should be able to do so, seeing that the only difference are the size of the wounds and the amount of reconstruction required. Well the thing is , the body works in different methods for different harms to the body. When there is cut on skin, a primal response is sent by body to send its defense around the wound to capture and destroy foreign elements. That is doable because the blood routes are still intact to the injury site, allowing also the proteins that reconstruct the epidermis (skin) to do their job right after coagulation has completed. Under that cut, other elements such as nerve cells, major blood routes and others(muscles fibers etc) are intact. Therefore, the body is able to asses the damage and heal the wound. When an arm is cut off, the nerve cells and blood vessels that were in arm are no longer connected to grand central (body and brain). Humans are unable to regenerate nerve cells, unlike the lizard and the goldfish for example. Why not? Our DNA aint programmed to do so! We lose nerve cells, ciao bye! cant get em back. That is why neurodegenerative diseases are permanent and are uncurable (parkison's, alzeihmers, etc..) The only hope lies in getting cells that by "training" can turn into new nerve cells which is stem cell research. Stem cells have to the ability to become any cell in the body. ok so thats it, guys u think i left something out or said someting wong wong, weally wong, tell me plz. vlad vat do you say we all had a get together and all somewhere.

 Vlad, which email do you check..? well, anyway, my current pic is here urlLink click here

 A have a question for the biologically-knowledgeable community here: Viv, Fais, Mulanda... Suppose I have a not-so-severe external physical damage to my skin. The organism will (I'll speak in lay terms for the fear of being misunderstood) heal the wound. How does it know where to stop regenerating the tissue? Does DNA contain information about the allowable "external bounds" of my body? Why then does the body not regenerate extremities? I am sort of confused on the whole regeneration process. Is the mechanism known?

 Roma, I suggest you stay. If your desperation is based solely on the current state of the industry, and NOT on your likes and dislikes, I strongly suggest you stick with engineering. You know how it is... just when you think of resigning yourself to hopelessness, the light in the end of the tunnel appears. If you really don't see yourself in the field, get the fuck out of there before you go insane. Investment banking will always be a safe bet. It's like Dentistry, I guess.

 Engineering was a bad-bad choice. Only 3 persons (not percent) found co-op jobs out of 2nd year students. All of them have near perfect GPA. This sounds like a signal to drop out and go do something more useful, fuck, should've gone into Finance. I'm thinking of working full-time next year at some stupid job, getting CFA level 1, and fucking switching into Finance or Commerce. Fuck this bullshit, engineering is in a lot of trouble.

 Ok, I am out, sorry. :)

 Yes, I have read Genesis two or three times in different versions, but, of course, I skipped some paragraphs that seem boring, like most of us. Besides, most popular publishings of the Bible represent shorter translated versions of the original, and that's probably the cause of the misinterpretation by many people of what's written there. It says, it was "DARK". Doesn't dark mean just the absence of light? Many don't think so, and it's the first deviation of the original sense. Also it says, there was water with living there creatues; doesn't this imply that there was a planet Earth with life on it before the creation. Moreover, I believe, it says, that the time of creation of Adam and Eve was not the first time God created life. Of course, I'm not saing that Mr. Asimov wrote the article on the spot. But as you mentioned before, he wrote it for dumb americans: he had to adopt.

 I'm not quite sure of what you're saying Andrei. Isaac Asimov does have a point. He tells creationists to go fuck themselves. That article is very nicely written. And, mind you, I am all for critical thinking and all, but did you just say that Isaac Asimov "has some misunderstandings"? Are you saying Isaac Asimov just got up one morning and decided to publish an article about Creationism without first reading the Bible? urlLink Genesis (which you clearly haven't read) DOES contradict the thery of evolution. No debate necessary here. According to Genesis (in short), it was dark, then the Big Daddy came and said: "Computer: LIGHT!". Then he created the Man, Woman, wild and livestock (!) animals. All that happened within six days roughly 6000 years ago. Do you find that in perfect agreement with evolution? Anyway, I hope I haven't hurt anyone's religious feelings. I have deep respect for any religion as a cultural component -- NOT as an actual theory of how things came into being.

 By the way Vlad, I've read the article on Scientific creationists and forgot what I wanted to say because the internet got disconnected for about 4 hours and I was busy doing other things. Anyhow, it was pretty boring to read with practicaly nothing new in it. I don't know what was the point of the author, it probably was meant for either scientists who permenantly regect any thought of creationnist in regards to their interests. Or maybe, the will to be extremely politically correct of the author made the article loose the opinion and idea behind it as well as all it's debatable value. What do you think? Also, it's quite clear that the author has some misunderstandings upon what's written in the Bible about the creation, because it does not contradict any theory of evolution and any age limit to the creation of Universe, the Earth and the animals. Moreover, it simply does not give any pertinent information about what was there/here before God created Adam and Eve. So I don't think that there should be any debate at all between the evolutionists and creationnists, since they are talking about intrinsicly (!) different time scales of things and things at all. :)

 When I was young, it seemed that life was so wonderful A miracle, oh it was beautiful, magical And all the birds in the trees, well they'd be singing so happily Joyfully, playfully watching me But then they send me away to teach me how to be sensible Logical, responsible, practical And they showed me a world where I could be so dependable Clinical, intellectual, cynical There are times when all the world's asleep The questions run too deep For such a simple man Won't you please, please tell me what we've learned I know it sounds absurd But please tell me who I am Now watch what you say or they'll be calling you a radical Liberal, fanatical, criminal Won't you sign up your name, we'd like to feel you're Acceptable, respecable, presentable, a vegtable At night, when all the world's asleep The questions run so deep For such a simple man Won't you please, please tell me what we've learned I know it sounds absurd But please tell me who I am Supertramp The logical song. 1979

 O"K"-- it is actually the time for me to write something here, first of all because i don't write a lot , second of all school is over, third of all summer is coming. Well , starting slowly, school was really hard , or maybe i worked a bit more , lot's of surprises during this year and many other that only the enlightened people should know. Well , now that finally it's all gone there is a funny emptyness inside. I'm really looking forward for this summer , and definetely if i gather enough money i;ll go somewhere at the end. Then, someone brought me a funny surprize by the end of the semester not saying who.......,Bliad(Pardon mademoiselles), by switching to Concordia.But i guess this is life , and i wish him good luck. Then the very anticipating return of the mighty Dronovitch is awaited in Montreal area around august and i'm happy hes going to be there at least with me. Now only for Dron:) : Nu ti psdes liad pisatelem stal , ia ag ohuel, bliad tebia tam v parige kakimi batonami kormiat chto bi ti tak pisat stal, romantica tut bliad , smooth relationships pisdes, ia smotru ti pisdes stal ni kak ranche , na kampuse kagduiu vtoroiu hotel, i begal i krishal chto u tebia s nei uge est kontack.

Wish you all good luck

 You guys are all lucky. I'm stuck doing summer courses... and I've planned to take 4 of them across 2 sessions... call me crazy. So now for this month, I have to learn the wonders of Greek mythology and write a paper on how the taxi market in developing countries can survive without regulation. Next month it's "Medicine in the modern society" and "World War I" On top of which, I have to do work and move out on the 18th 0.o The joy of life.

 yo! I likez dis knew blogger! Kewl shet! Andrei, I see you are a hacker enthusiast now :) Try that once again, and I'll show your blog to your mom. :))

 but it sucks that I don't have the "settings" and "template" buttons like vlad does.. :( That's not fair, I can't even check who're the members of THE team. I also don't like the 'preview post' thing. feels like I'm wasting my time, I'm still not going to change anything in my post, so why preview? It feels like they're thinking that I'm stupid or something and that I ablosutly need to see what I'm going to make public in a second and ensure that it is the POST I REALLY want people to see. Fewh! That's like important shit, man! Cheers!

 cool, it does :)

 I wonder if the new blogger publishes things...

 Alright. I'm free. Nothing else depends on me now, maybe just a possible arrangment (after a scandal and a long explanation) for one of my results but I hope it doesn't get to that point. We'll see in 2 days. So final standing can't be yet announced, but here's a provisionary one for this semester: 5 exams = 7 courses for McGill. Passed 3.5 exams = 5 courses, one failed, and one will know this week. Total 3.5/4, or for McGill validated 5. (Plus 80% of my nervous system almost scraped and probably 5% of neuros will not recover. Shit! It's a lot for a life time!!) Now I feel like getting out of an aquarium at last being able to breath. This school year was long and tiering. My exam period lasted for 24 days with 5 written tests and 3 orals. I'm still shaking. Oh well. Now it's time to work and have fun. I've got 2 jobs now (the data entry thing and the hotel) and looking for ways of making my filming ideas earning money experience as well (hopefully full time). Girls were on the fifth place of priority for me during last month and a half, and now are getting to third position (after filming and getting back in moral and phisical shape). Maybe, however, I'll get involved in some threesomes to relax a bit, since I have got friends at the student lesbian association. No, there are no guys and it is not possible, so don't make any jokes upon the subject. Oh, yes! I went to salon de Bourget , I'll send you the link to photos. There are some pics Vlad would really enjoy. Finally, I got to go. I don't know what exactly I want to do now, but probably will clean my room from the mess the exams left, then will say hi to a new cute female comer in our building, have dinner with a group of friends and sort of, and then working in the hotel's restaurent untill 2 at night (the latest I hope). Take care and lets try to keep in touch. Cheers!

 What's up Irene. My urlLink last post will answer your question.

 For stats: I've passed 2 now, for three others waiting results.

 Haha, you're such a funny bastard. So are you coming to Concordia or you changed you're mind?

 Interesting quotation. Here's a recursively wrong statement for you: All generalizations are wrong. I hope you see the irony. By the way, that Clarke dude would probably bar Sakharov, Bohr and most of the Nobel Prize winners from their labs. Alright. Andrei, have you ever thought about the source of one curious quality of your unique charachter, namely, the strong urge for controversy ? I find it very interesting. Do you know where it comes from? If I were you (oh Christ), I would try to explore the origin of that feeling. If you learn to control it (as opposed to being controlled by it), among other things, it could help you become a decent journalist...

 Arthur Clarke's First Law: "When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong." Clarke defines the adjective 'elderly' as :"In physics, mathematics and astronautics it means over thirty; in other disciplines, senile decay is sometimes postponed to the forties. There are of course, glorious exceptions; but as every researcher just out of college knows, scientists of over fifty are good for nothing but board meetings, and should at all costs be kept out of the laboratory". (in Profiles of the Future.)

 Not only. And I don't think that it's bad. (Did I need to write this?) Besides, 1st ...why don't all people think this way?... 2nd Tastes differ.

 Yeah, no shit man! If you only knew how low I feel right now. It's too bad that your "level" of self esteem is determined by certain sets of sounds that your mouth produces..

 Passed 1 4 to be anounced. Man, you don't know how bad I want to express myself just because I feel like it and I can't just because. Besides, I probably don't know how to express my self really badly. Isn't it sad? So now FUCK OFF and don't answer that question! Well, now I feel lower in my self respect. I find that swearing and insulting people makes brings the person doing that to a lower level of moral ranking then he was initially. Stange, why don't all people think this way?...

 Fuck off! The failure will not come. It must not come. It won't (exclamation mark)

 That "guy" might just be an HR secretary. You are a laughable sexist fuck-up, Andrei. OH YEAH! YO MOMMAH! Bring it ONNNN! BEHOLD the power of the final examinations! THE FAILURE COMETH!!!

 Why can't the guy making this offer take on the responsibility and do it him self? Of cource there are many logical answers, but I say: "he is just a lazy prick!!" Why do I think that it is 'He'? Because 'she' won't be able to do it anyway! Sorry, maybe it's just because I failed my fist exam. Yet, it doesn't mean I failed the course. I need to get 18/20 for my math oral and I will pass on the dot. Damn. Wish me luck, and let God be with me. Amen. P.S. 3 more exams to go.... + that one oral.

 mmmmmm...............barbecue and corona. (*drool*)

 maaaaan is it hot outside or what. i am fookin thawing. us be montreal next weekend saturday morning. party yes? barbeque? pool rugby?

 Alright, change of plans. I'm not coming back to Montreal on the 12th nor the 15th. Yet, I'll try to make it for end of august / beginning of septermber for sure. Take care.

 Ok Montreal ppl...stay tuned for an upcoming pool party, possibly sometime in June. More info is to come. And Vova, when are you planning your first visit back to Montreal?

 Looks like a groovey summer ahead of you!

 Montreal people?! Who's that anyway? And Viv,"Ich studieren deutsch mit Audrey, aber ich vergessen fast alles." Yet, I still remember what 'dummkopf' means :). Besides that, did my first exam today; It's always hard to break the ice without breaking the neck. Well, I'll see how it comes out. Also planning my summer and my trip in Europe. Alsmost last call for those who do want to visit me, and moreover, travel the Europe with me. For today my plan is: work June and July non stop, earn 1000euro extra to what I need. Meanwhile film short movies and funny subjects with a group of people (still to find). 1st of August leave Paris for Bruxelles- Amsterdam- Berlin- Prague- Vienne. (Or the other way around, + some other sity(s) may pop up. Originally Milan and Rome were included, but lack of fininces and time made me change my mind.) Then back to Paris (or Lyon), and Montreal on august the 12th (or 15th). But before all that, I still have 4 more exams to go, and an extra job to find. (Maybe I'll end up working close to double full-time for a two weeks or so. :) ).

O/ .. /V ... /\

 Probably has something to do with the content...^_-

 a question: why doesn't the blogger publish right away my posts?

 popped in to say hi! later!

 And Young man, are you listening to me? I said, young man, what do you want to be? I never knew that there are a lot of versions of that song. A kids one, an adolescent one, an adult one, and moreover, for different sexual denominations as well! :) So I said :)

 Evil twin, huh? Just how many personalities DO you have? You know, perhaps you should seriously consider seeking professional help...that grey Toronto air can't possibly be good for your health...^_- Audrey, I think you should make a break for it while you still can!

 Viv, what in the history of our relationship makes you think I am delusional? If you are referring to my Paralyzed phylosophy, it's not me, it's my evil twin, Vlad Tepes, the Impaler.

 I have no idea WHAT Vlad saw...but seeing that he's as delusional as you, Andrei, it probably doesn't amount to anything much...^_- By the way, how the devil do you manage to get yourself into these predicaments? I think it's time you head back home before someone finds you beaten to a pulp in a seedy Parisian alley...Dammit! You NEVER listen! Faisal, glad to hear that all is well - remember that bottled water is your friend (as are malaria pills, bloody noxious things...). Audrey, Vlad, the two of you just snuck in and snuck out of town...hmmmmm...makes a person wonder...Salsa, what are you up to? Wajdi - did they finally straighten up all that chaos with co-op? Anyway, must go back to the all-important job of lazing around my living room...^_- et on se parlera bientot, j'esp�re...(yes I know i'm missing an accent...stupid keyboard)

 Yo, people!! What did you see Vlad? A question... How would one feel, if he/she would have the oportuniny to seduce a young naive gorgeous and almost married woman? Moreover, while her almost husband (at his 40ties) invites that him/her for a 'friendly' dinner... And what would one do in that situation? ... :)

 I saw that :)

 Hello all from the Bangladesh, country situated right next to INdia, very tiny in size but dense in population. Got hold of an interent terminal and thawing the chunks of junks from the email. So so far, I have been to couple of hospitals and clinics and the things I can tell you and the experiences I have had are enormous , and its been only a week. I could do it right here, but I would be inflicting on people who are not interested, so I think a face to face convo would be better when I return to Mtl. And... I'm paying for the internet connection by the minute. So...bye for now. Oh..and eat and chew your food with more delight than usual, I certainly have learned to do so. longing to see you all in 4 and half weeks, specially ,viv :) (...sorry couldnt meet before me left..ill make it up )

 Yo! We did come to Mtl last weekend, but I have experienced some technical difficulties with my clutch. It turned out, the clutch cylinder liquid ran out, so I spent most of the weekend trying to get rid of the air in the system. Anyway, how are things? Andrei, I couldn't read your email. If you can send it in .doc format, that would be great. I can't wait. So why are you, being such a patriot, studying abroad? Are Russian Universities not good enough for you? Oh, I see, you don't want to go to the army. Whatever happened to a man's duty to defend his country... :) Here's some stuff about honesty, commitment to selecting real talent etc. in Russia's elite med schools: http://fakel.org/art.php?id=31&art_id=535

 Only you, Andrei...insert EXTREMELY exasperated eye roll here...Vlad, Audrey - what's the plan for this weekend? Give me a buzz when you figure it out...can't wait to see you!

 Finally some people are back on the web :). Ok, a funny story. I'm registered at some russian dating websites as a hot rich russian guy living either in States, France or Canada (on the picture we see a muscular blond around 25-28 years of age surfing). Consequently, I get lots of emails of ladyes wanting to meet me. For example: ������ �������, ��� � �� �� �������, � � ������, �� � ���������� � ����������� ���� ������� � ����������. ��� �� ����� ��������. ���� ����� ����������, ���� �� ��� ��������, � ����� � �� ������ � ����........ Basically she is asking for help learning french, and maybe other help as well... My answer was a patriotic style angry letter upon people in Russia. Well, she never wrote me back... Next young lady from Ukrane send me was very polite with me and sent me a dozzen of her photos, with a description of how smart she is, how nice and educated she is and that she is also a good house keeper, a cook and probably a good mother in the future, and that she is coming soon to Paris, where I could meet her. Well, I proposed right away. She still didn't answer and probably won't :). Other emails were not as interesting but I'm hoping for other funny onces. :) Yours,

 yo, that sounds like a plan...

 Hi guys. Thanks for thanks. Fais good luck! I am very rarely online nowadays. We'll be in Montreal next weekend. How about saturday night? Club/lounge. Suggestions?

 Hi viv, all plans are officially a go. I'm leaving on the 16. Really would like to see you before if possible. If not, well then, when I'll be back. :) Until next time friends, ce n'est qu'un au revoir.

 Hey, guys! Andrei, what the hell is this?!!!! I'm not even sure I want to know. I find that as time goes by, I'm getting more and more concerned about your sanity...Vlad, that was a lovely evening. I'm sorry I was so late - I don't think I've ever been QUITE that late for anything before...shut up, Andrei. ^_- Audrey, quand est-ce qu'on se revera? When are you two coming back to Mtl? Faisal, how go your plans for Bangladesh? I went on a massive baking spree today. Don't quite know what came over me. Before I knew it, I had whipped up two batches of banana muffins, a loaf of raisin bread and a double batch of brownies...geez...I'm going to main-lining insulin at the rate I'm going...^_- Anyway, must get back to my cookbook - no, I'm not baking anything else! Have you taken leave of your senses?! I'm compiling some recipes for a friend of mine for her birthday. Right, that's about it for now. Cu�dense, all of you!

 oopps

 hmmm...

 Yeah! I had an amazing time too at your place Vlad. It's too bad though that occasiaons of having these parties are now rare. Well, I guess that's what made it special last night, and spcial things are great for a birthday...

 I had a really great time Vlad at your place. Didnt get the chance, but thank your parents for their hospitality and Audrey and your Mom for absolutely exquisite food, especially the fish eggs.

 Thanks Andrei. Too bad you'll miss it man.

 happy birthday Vlad!!!!!!!

 Evgueny, sorry I didn't get back to u about the movie/Piano Bar business...I was supposed to meet up with some friends of mine who are back from Oman, India, etc. but that didn't work out...ended up staying home camped out in flannel pjs agonizing about grad school...we're still on for tomorrow, right?

 The night we saw "Le Declin de l'Empire..." was truly memorable. Let us see each other more often before we are off to tend to our lawn. Alors c'est tout pour maintenant, a la prochaine ! (thick andreish wannabe french accent)

 YO! We are not coming this weekend because I only have 1 day off. We will be coming for Eugene's b-day on the weekend of the 13th. How about we celebrate outside somewhere?

 Welcome back. Audrey, you'd better be coming up this weekend - or I may forced to take some desperate measures...

 Sup peeps, uh i do drive, but due to an event that occured about 5 months ago, I can not drive for some time, so sorry... My nomber iz 421-0660, im not too much on fishing but I suppose I will tag along if that is the case. I would propose meeting at a bar or something, anywayz decide and tell, talk to ya later.

 alright. Fais what's your nember? Vlad are you serious? If yes r u coming with Audrey? There has been a proposition made: somewhere in the nature..? I'm absolutely up for it. Moreover, how about going fishing? Don't laugh, I mean it. I know some very nice places where we can fish and have a picknic. We would need cars. Fais, do you drive? I have a car but no liscence. Anyhow, what do you say? I'll be calling all of the people tomorrow. Take care,

 yes it does vlad, yes it does, so where and when do we meet or is it still all in air at the moment?

 Damn, I guess that means I'll have to drive 1200km again next weekend.

 there was no sarcasm...andrei, do you have any cheese left

 thanx for the sarcasm, but i like the idea nonetheless

 I'm on for it.

 alright...i think this calls for another party

 its good to be back

 Idiot.

 Ooops, didn't I mean to say 769-2649?? My mistake.

 the way to get there is to get to metro Verdun, then either call 763-2649, either walk down the Verdun street in the ouest direction for 10min and turn left at the street called woodland (right on the coner there is a gas station the one with a canadian maple leaf) and search for number 279 on that Woodland street.

 So will I - probably will be a few hours late ^_- (not because I forgot the time, but because I have family over and I don't know when I'll be able to get away...shut up, Vlad - I'd stick my tongue out at you, but the effort would be wasted, seeing as you're not here to witness it). It would also help if I knew how the hell to get there - 'Verdun' is a bit too general for me - it's like telling someone you live in Toronto (granted, it's not as big, but the opportunities to get lost in the dark are just as many).

 I'll be there.

 hey pple, I'm back to mtl. this sunday around 5pm wine and cheese at my app. All of you are invited. See you then. Sencerely,

 YO! We are in MTL today and tomorrow. I don't know when we'll come back. It's becoming a pain in the ass to drive 1200km every weekend. Keep us up-to date what's happening though. Jeka knows our #. Fais, are you back yet?

 Oh, yeah, I didn't go to Corsica finally, but stayed all the week at Annecy with my sis, her b-f and his family. Did rock climbing swimming, and eating. My parents going to come here soon. Ye. just to say again, PLZZZZZZZ, b in MTL all of YA!!!!!!!!

 !!!! Listen EVERYONE! Make sure to have next week days free of any important plans. Vlad & Audrey, you better get your asses to MTL at least for a day! Fais, Viv, Doris, Dany, (Jeka you already know), I also hope that you'll be around this coming up week!!!!!!!! See you all! Hope I won't get arrested while transporting marijuana, and if not, ones of you who'll recognise me the fist day will get a real-life joint!! :)) Peace and luv! Truly yours,

 yo! how ya all doin'...it's been a looooooooong time. well life is great though somewhat borring, regardless of few things that make the summer special. let's see, the coolest one so far was dancing in a movie. there is a movie being shot in montreal with leonardo dicaprio...pays so well to do that. feel like a big movie star. andrei, we could probably figure out something fun when you're back, like going up north or to toronto (everyone is welcome to join). oh and guess who i ran into two times like almost in a row...californiachick. sarah if you still read this, what do you do at honore beaugrand so often? ok dudes let's keep in touch and stuff...catch ya later

 Man!! I just erased all that I have wrote, by an accident!!!!!!!!! I'm such a sloppy ass!! Anyway. VLAD, ARE YOU, LIKE, SERIOUS ?? Abouts the T.O. thing??? AUDREY!!! HELLO!! Can you give at least one comment on what's going on, PLZZZZ? DUDES, are we all drifting away or something?? Or is the world simply becoming a smaller place??? HEY-O! Jek, Viv, Fais, Dor, Waj, Rom, Dan and others (if there are) on this blog, do you also have Napoleon's or Colombus plans for living your life? Anyhow, I just hope to see you all soon and together as a bunch of having fun people. About me, well, in Paris it's 40�C during the day and 39�C during the night. (thank god I'm not there). For my trip to Holland and belgum I've spen 300 euros or so. That really, really sucks because I planned my budget for the latter around 100/150 euros. Now I still owe 100euros to my sis, and since my big plan was to go to Corsica, there will fly away 100euros more. But I sound to hipocrit counting about the money!! I should count how much fun I had!! But, knowing that in Amsterdam I've had a huge fight with my g-f, (despite all my love and respect for her, I think her hobby is to be unnoying, which pisses me off a lot). Too bad she couldn't come to Corsica with us (my sis, her fianc�, and me), and I still hope to see her in Paris before I leave. Anyway, a sad story; now I'm suppose to be a good boy untill my second trip to Europe to see her in winter. All right, see you all soon!! And PLZZ, be in MTL when I come back!!! Cheers!!

 Hi all. Sup Doris ma man! Viv: DUH. Jeka, did you say something or is it just my imagination? Fais, are you there? Andrei, I envy your traveling and stuff.

 Hey Guys, it's been a while, so I wanted to say Hi to everbody...Vlad, good luck in T.O...Andrei, Please get real and grow up....Yevgeni, tu salsa es muy frio el pasada dias...and finally but certainly not least, Viv, keep shining.



 Wait a minute...this appartment business...does it mean T.O. is going to be your PERMANENT residence?????? Am I the only one who finds this a cause for concern...? Andrei, glad to know you finally worked up the gumption to break things off with Agathe...^_- sigh...the saga continues...

 Visiting for a day. Girlfriend for last 7 month !! (+/- 1.5month of temp breaking up, or other..) Amsterdam! here we come! :) Cheers! Andrei

 Girlfriend for a day or visiting for a day? Probably both :). I will expect your blonde ass in Toronto before school. And everyone else as well. Take your sleeping bags with you: we have 860 sq feet with NO furniture :)

 hello from Utrecht, Holland!!! Visiting here with my g-f, Agathe, for a day, and tomorrow to Amsterdam! :) Then hopefully to Belgum. See you later!! Kisses, Andrei :)

 We found a gorgeous appartment! Updates to follow. Next weekend we will officially be living in our own lil place. Yo, Andrei, when are you coming back? Also, what is up with Doris and his breast research?

 THE MIDTERMS ARE COMING, THE MIDTERMS ARE COMING!!! Hate to say this, but I guess the studious hastle is on the horizon and is approaching with the speed of sound. (i.e. we can see it, but we still can't hear it. And we'll hear it only when it gets here, or as a resonnance when it will already pass, but that's BAD!!!) Shit! I aready had a one mid-term and many projects are due soon. I know that some people here are not is the same "stress boad" as most of us, but I'm sure that their time will come sooner or later :), and they'll feel again that dull inquetude before the test and the emplyness right after... So DON'T get too excited now! We're all still chained to one board, and the board is nailed to one wall, and the wall is a part of the same house, and the house is still being build!! Truly yours,

 Hey Viv, thanks for inquiring. It went pretty well, but could have been much better. That's obviously regardless of the fact that I got first in one of the cattegories...But thanks for your concern anyway

 Hi, guys! How did the competition go, yesterday? Sorry, I couldn't make it. I ended up staying home and working on my paper. What a way to spend a Saturday night! Anyway, hope it went well!

 RE: Silence. Fais, thanks. RE: AMT machine. Are you sure you're not? Jeka, did you seriously feel amazing? Well, let's say it didn't show in the end :)). No, I am not mocking you ma man. It's all good. Good life.

 Alright guys, I wanna thank everyone for being there. It was a great party and that's because everyone showed up. Seriously it felt amazing seeing you all... Thank you again

 I guess there's hope for all us dyslexics out there... Evgueny, it was nice to finally go out dancing with the gang - it's been waaaaaay too long. Audrey - y Vlad tambi�n ;) - estaba muy contenta de FINALMENTE verles despu�s de tanto tiempo. Espero que les ver� dentro de poco. No s� cuando podria viajar a Toronto, a ver...Cuidense (!malditos acentos!)

 Dear people, Evgueni is having a birthday party tomorrow. Whose b-day? Well mine. Adress... 6388 St-Hubert, corner of Beaubien, metro Beaubien. If interested, I'll be more than happy to see you there. It's called Nacho Night club, starting at 8:30pm. For more info call me at (514)815-1476. Fais I hope you can make it...

 Hi dudes and dudettes! Vladimir est a l'appareil. I am looking forward to seeing you all next Saturday.

 Casablanca was good :). But I'm not sure if I would have fallen asleep if I've watched it on a small screen all alone. Besides that the evening was fun, too bad noone else could make it. Evgueni, I'm sorry for calling you during your course, I somehow thought it was finished.

 Idiot...someone is DEFINITELY in denial...How was Casablanca?

 Hello then!! :) by the way, are we, like, into school year already? Huh?! Fais, Jeka, Waj?! :) I think I'm starting tomorrow, but I have to check... See you all.

 just marking my presence.

 Hi people, what is up with Mulanda? Why is he in the hospital?

 Hehe, I found a Russian translation of Byron's poem. I find it not quite the same, and a bit poorer. But judge for your self :) &#1054;&#1085;&#1072; &#1080;&#1076;&#1077;&#1090; &#1074;&#1086; &#1074;&#1089;&#1077;&#1081; &#1082;&#1088;&#1072;&#1089;&#1077; - &#1057;&#1074;&#1077;&#1090;&#1083;&#1072;, &#1082;&#1072;&#1082; &#1085;&#1086;&#1095;&#1100; &#1077;&#1077; &#1089;&#1090;&#1088;&#1072;&#1085;&#1099;. &#1042;&#1089;&#1103; &#1075;&#1083;&#1091;&#1073;&#1100; &#1085;&#1077;&#1073;&#1077;&#1089; &#1080; &#1079;&#1074;&#1077;&#1079;&#1076;&#1099; &#1074;&#1089;&#1077; &#1042; &#1077;&#1077; &#1086;&#1095;&#1072;&#1093; &#1079;&#1072;&#1082;&#1083;&#1102;&#1095;&#1077;&#1085;&#1099;, &#1050;&#1072;&#1082; &#1089;&#1086;&#1083;&#1085;&#1094;&#1077; &#1074; &#1091;&#1090;&#1088;&#1077;&#1085;&#1085;&#1077;&#1081; &#1088;&#1086;&#1089;&#1077;, &#1053;&#1086; &#1090;&#1086;&#1083;&#1100;&#1082;&#1086; &#1084;&#1088;&#1072;&#1082;&#1086;&#1084; &#1089;&#1084;&#1103;&#1075;&#1095;&#1077;&#1085;&#1099;. &#1055;&#1088;&#1080;&#1073;&#1072;&#1074;&#1080;&#1090;&#1100; &#1083;&#1091;&#1095; &#1080;&#1083;&#1100; &#1090;&#1077;&#1085;&#1100; &#1086;&#1090;&#1085;&#1103;&#1090;&#1100; - &#1048; &#1073;&#1091;&#1076;&#1077;&#1090; &#1091;&#1078; &#1089;&#1086;&#1074;&#1089;&#1077;&#1084; &#1085;&#1077; &#1090;&#1072; &#1042;&#1086;&#1083;&#1086;&#1089; &#1072;&#1075;&#1072;&#1090;&#1086;&#1074;&#1072;&#1103; &#1087;&#1088;&#1103;&#1076;&#1100;, &#1053;&#1077; &#1090;&#1077; &#1075;&#1083;&#1072;&#1079;&#1072;, &#1085;&#1077; &#1090;&#1077; &#1091;&#1089;&#1090;&#1072; &#1048; &#1083;&#1086;&#1073;, &#1075;&#1076;&#1077; &#1087;&#1086;&#1084;&#1099;&#1089;&#1083;&#1086;&#1074; &#1087;&#1077;&#1095;&#1072;&#1090;&#1100; &#1058;&#1072;&#1082; &#1073;&#1077;&#1079;&#1091;&#1087;&#1088;&#1077;&#1095;&#1085;&#1072;, &#1090;&#1072;&#1082; &#1095;&#1080;&#1089;&#1090;&#1072;. &#1040; &#1101;&#1090;&#1086;&#1090; &#1074;&#1079;&#1075;&#1083;&#1103;&#1076;, &#1080; &#1094;&#1074;&#1077;&#1090; &#1083;&#1072;&#1085;&#1080;&#1090;, &#1048; &#1083;&#1077;&#1075;&#1082;&#1080;&#1081; &#1089;&#1084;&#1077;&#1093;, &#1082;&#1072;&#1082; &#1074;&#1089;&#1087;&#1083;&#1077;&#1089;&#1082; &#1084;&#1086;&#1088;&#1089;&#1082;&#1086;&#1081;, &#1042;&#1089;&#1077; &#1074; &#1085;&#1077;&#1081; &#1086; &#1084;&#1080;&#1088;&#1077; &#1075;&#1086;&#1074;&#1086;&#1088;&#1080;&#1090;. &#1054;&#1085;&#1072; &#1074; &#1076;&#1091;&#1096;&#1077; &#1093;&#1088;&#1072;&#1085;&#1080;&#1090; &#1087;&#1086;&#1082;&#1086;&#1081; &#1048; &#1077;&#1089;&#1083;&#1080; &#1089;&#1095;&#1072;&#1089;&#1090;&#1100;&#1077; &#1087;&#1086;&#1076;&#1072;&#1088;&#1080;&#1090;, &#1058;&#1086; &#1089;&#1072;&#1084;&#1086;&#1081; &#1097;&#1077;&#1076;&#1088;&#1086;&#1102; &#1088;&#1091;&#1082;&#1086;&#1081;! 12 &#1080;&#1102;&#1085;&#1103; 1814

 Man, it's so freak'n hard to be responsible!!!!!!!!!!! (personal note to myself) Blin!

 That's why poetry is about the content and sharp imaging, especially the English one. Viv, I still don't get any information email upon events of the Club. But I'll try to make it. Are you going to be there?

 I cannot digest poetry in English. Nothing underlines it's inherent crudeness and structural poverty better than rhyme. Just my 2 ESL cents in. vt

 I can see why...After staring at this evil computer screen all day, studying for these vile GREs, that was quite refreshing. Are you coming to Twisted Tales on Thursday?

 She walks in beauty, like the night Of cloudless climes and starry skies, And all that's best of dark and bright Meets in her aspect and her eyes; Thus mellow'd to that tender light Which Heaven to gaudy day denies. One shade the more, one ray the less, Had half impair'd the nameless grace Which waves in every raven tress Or softly lightens o'er her face, Where thoughts serenely sweet express How pure, how dear their dwelling-place. And on that cheek and o'er that brow So soft, so calm, yet eloquent, The smiles that win, the tints that glow, But tell of days in goodness spent ,� A mind at peace with all below, A heart whose love is innocent. Lord Byron Man, I was high on this poem for last two weeks now!

 Thank you guys, I really appreciate your support. Vovka and Audrey, you guys rock. The supper last night was great and thanks a lot for all the hospitality. Let's all now figure something out for the holidays.

 F�licitations!!!!

 Congrads!!!

 I am here to be the first to announce Eugene's 2 (two) FIRST places in both standard and Latin!!! Kudos Jeka. Way to go. We will drink now.

 Good Fais... Good... :) I like to read some good quality English stories...

 Tygon's yearly midterm description It is still early in the day and the sun is still shy. A thick foul-smelling fog covers the dark and damp swamp. Not a creature moves and not a plant stirs for in this place, not even the wind dares to dance. The obvious presence of death himself swarms amongst the stream that flows silently throught the river bed. The sweet smell of the morning dew is now a smell of rotten corpses. Flames that have burnt the innocent bodies now sizzle amidst the remaing ashes. What remains of this river of youth is now a bog of bile. The very stench of the smoke brings tears to the eyes for not a single breath of life is whispered let alone present. As the mist slowly passes away, a very light shadow appears in the far distance. The emerging sun helps clarify this distant object. As the light starts to rapidly illuminate the location, the silhouette of a man appears distinct. He leans against his staff barely able to stand and each time he struggles to keep himself upstraight. Blood is trickling from every one of his junctures as he still fights to remain standing. His arms shake episodically as if they were almost out of strength but this man musters all that is left to remain alive. The clouds soon reappear and slowly hide the sun in a part. Water of the stream slowly recommences its redundant pouring through the ravines and an insect or two is heard whimping around. As the day goes into night, the man's faint murmur resonates through the bushes. He whispers "..its over..." "...its over...". This cyclic tantra continues far into the dark cold night until silence retakes its throne. ...midterms are done with...i have survived.

 Vovka, i'm coming either friday night or saturday... i'll give you a call today to let you know the details. But i'm coming for sure...

 Jeka, are you coming this weekend? Andrei? Anyone? Is anyone going to TO this weekend? I need to know when you'll be at the Central Station. You know the number.

 Cheer up everyone. I will finally get my DSL in 3 days and inject some life into this place. Jeka, I await your presence here. My fridge too. Anyone else: COME ON OVER! We will make one big parteeey!

 Evgueny, I don't think everyone's dead, they're just entombed in the library cramming desperately for a series of exams that are currently sucking the life out of them... Ahhh...isn't that a happy thought...Best of luck, guys! I have a feeling we're going to need it...

 hm...looks like it's become dead down here. do you people still exist...i try to. is it mid-terms times? what's hapenning to all of you? i'm starting to get worried. where are the toronto guys? vovka i'm still coming to toronto on the 24-26, but i'll give you a call. oh, and why am writing all this...ok bye... (p.s. the name of this blog is "..." )

 How is everyone doing? How is life? What are the plans for anything? Does anyone want to take a fight on a small plane for 35$ bucs? I do, but I need 2 more people.

 Vlad, remember my first mid-term? Well, I got a free ice cream at the Frost Bite... I really was thinking about throwing it in a garbage can in rage, but... I ate it... Fuck!!

 man, I've got internet at home now!! :) (just feel like sharing...)

 I had this screwed up dream last night. I am sitting at a desk in Chulich library (McGill) and seriously considering leaving engineering. And then EVGUENI comes up to me and suggests that he and I should write a paper on ballistics (?!?!????!) together. He says that he would then use it as a basis for his final-year thesis. Now what could be more strange than that? Anyone else dreamt of Evgueni last night?

 Whatever Viv, didn't want go there anyway.

 The approaching battle Light pierces the lengthy darkness that spoused the night all along. On the horizon, creatures that were dormant are still in slow mobility on their daily morning hunt. There is still a dew hanging from the leaves of trees, as a gentle wind slowly dances along, lifting up and down the fallen leaves of autumn. Very low crunches of footsteps are heard approaching. A man in his youth walks out to the open field. His cleanly waxed armour glitters in the morning sunshine and his freshly cleaved leather boots crunch at every step. He fixes for a moment his gauntlet that was passed on to him throughout his generation. After some quite reflexion he bows on one knee and prays. After he recites the last line, he stands up and and pauses a moment to stare at the stillness that surrounds him. He hears a rumble in the direction opposite to him approaching slowly but surely. He takes in a deep sigh, and remembers all those close to him that will miss him. Valinatly, a subtle smile comes on to his face and quickly disappears. He removes his sword from his shard and raises it high up in defiance as the rumble approaches with demonic speed. As the oncoming juggernaut drifts closer, our hero's fists clench tighter and his heart pounds faster... Here come the finals, good luck everyone.

 Small correction... The open rehearsal is cancelled - I think we're having it tomorrow (i.e. Friday)...as you can see, we're well prepared...this weekend is going to be interesting...

 Ooops! Almost forgot: Wajdi, Faisal - Eid Mubarak!

 Hello, again! All right, just wanted to let you all know that my dance group will be having a dress rehearsal Thursday night at 9 pm in the Ballroom (3rd floor) of the McGill Student Services Bldg. on McTavish. They're charging a $2 entrance fee to defray the costs of the trip. Yes, Evgueny, there will be some salsa. ^_- No, Andrei, you CANNOT, I repeat, CANNOT traumatise any of my friends - (read: FEMALE friends). There are a few first years, and I don't want you scaring them off - particularly not with that routine you pulled at L'Etranger when you got back from France... Audrey, I wish you were here! hopefully we'll see each other soon...

 yep

 Next week-end meaning 28-30th of november?

 We are actually coming next weekend, for my brother's birthday. I will also be giving the car a major tune-up, so that we can come more often without fear of freezing to death in the middle of the way between TO and Mtl. Good luck to Viv!

 As long as it's after dec 3 - Vlad, weren't u and Audrey supposed to come up one of these weekends? As long as it's not next weekend (I'll be in Ottawa - SoAsia, here I come!)...sigh...hope to see you all soon!

 must meet before exams start, so must meet before dec 6, howz that peeps ?

 thanks, but I'm afraid that I won't be posting there a lot. I actually have a blog for litterature stuff, and I don't really use it. I guess someday if i'll be writing a lot it may become handy.

 it will sign you out automatically after a few minutes. btw, Andrei, would you like a blog? I could build you one for your poetry and stuff... Although I hope that won't prevent you from posting here as well.

 hehe, cool. The only problem is that it doesn't sign you out when you close the window, so any person after who uses the computer after you will be automatically loged into your accout, once the goes to the blogger site. Actually, somehow even when I try to sign out on netscape through normal procedure on blogger, it doesn't sign me out, yet, as I turn off the netscape window, it does.

 ok, trying in explorer

 Why doesn't it work, Andrei? It works in Mozilla. Please let me know if there are any glitches in IE or netscape...

 My last post was: Blog This!! All money accepted!! The more the better!!! Just failed one test. I copied and copied wrong!! How miserable. I guess I'd have to fuck the TA; she is not good person (about looks), it may give me some bonus marks. Besides that, here is one of my poems: Saving Love (Suicide�s Diary) When certain substances properly mix, Wild explosions burst. When love and unfairness meet in a kiss, Tears see only world�s worst. But once all dries out, feelings remain Of unconditional you; Yet, stomach butterflies turn into pain As memories sting my heart through The world is a part, a part from our love Observed through the lens of our eyes; And quitting this show leaving costumes behind Will make those butterflies fly. So put some powder on your lips, I�ll light a fire on mine. Deadly explosion bursts as they mix When in a kiss we unite. Andrei Moskvitch (Copyright: October 2003)

 Blog this thing doesn't work!!!!

 ALSO please note that now you don't have to go to blogger.com to log in and post. Please use the urlLink blog this feature, which from now on will be conveniently located on the right side bar.. Enjoy.

 Andrei needs pie. I am for chipping in! What is your stance on Andrei's frustration? How is it affecting your life? Your two cents, everyone.

 It appears that our friend Andrei is suffering from sexual frustration. You know Andrei, we are your friends, we wouldnt mind if you went out and bought a warm apple pie... we would even chip in.

 sartuday 3:35pm. back to the library. Waiting for a strike of determination. 3 exams: tuesday, wednesday, friday. apporx. 5% of preparation done for each. Ooops...



 It appears that Andrei is suffering from sexual frustration. You know Andrei, we are your friends. We wouldnt think lesser of you if you went out and bought a warm apple pie. We'll even chip in, how bout that?

 yeah i got what you meant

 Man!! the girl in from of me has such a nice ass, I can't help staring at it!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaauuuuuuuuuuuu!!!!!!!!!!!

 Fuck; you got what I meant! yes, studY!

 Studding in the library? Hm... Born to stud can never study... I know what you mean.

 B-ha-ha-ha!! I AM in the library now... studing... duhh!! No prose, nor poetry will be posted on my behalf regarding the suffering period of exam preparation. And tomorrow it's time to for school at 8:00am!! Project shit to costruct, duhh!! I'm doing just fine, if you aks me. No stress, I'm just annoyed with the program: nothing breathtaking. I sometimes think: if " one born to crawl, will never fly " does it imply that " one born to fly, can learn to crawl "??? And if so, what kind of idiot, who was meant to fly would spend his time learining to crawl? And if he crawls finally, does it mean that he'll never fly due to his mediocricy, or because he has wasted his time and wings atrophied? Shit!! :) (but should be actually sad)

 Hello, hello ladies and gents. I here am dropping by to reassure you all of my existence and well-being. Viv, Andrei, Jeka: my brother and I sincerely enjoyed your company on Sunday. To everyone else, I eagerly await your pre-finals poetry and prose; end-of year school/love life and other masturbation achievements and ramblings. You may wish to send your masterpieces to me in private, and I will post them anonymously on this page. I am still El Dorado at vladster dot com . Yours very truly

 Alright, spanish pple. It's good to see everyone posting again. I guess I'll see some of you soon. Vlad, Audrey, are you planning to come to Mtl. any time soon? Yes? Maybe? Come on! We need to get together before the final examination period. Also, we've been talking about a new year's party, or a ski trip... Maybe it's time to start planning? I checked that most of the country houses are already booked the the time of the holidays, but there are still some left. Later!

 Gracias los amigos! I am feeling alot better now and I plan to spend the weekenk meditating on Life!!!

 Espero que te sientes mejor, chico. Si necesitas algo, ll�mame.

 Happy to know ur doing better Doris. Hope to see you soon.

 Happy you're fine Mulanda...

 I was losing sight in one eye as a consequence of a nose infection...'had to have immediate surgery that's what happened last Wednesday....I hope that's not too dramatic. Andreii I hope to strangle you once I get some energy back in these arms.

 Hey Mulanda, what thehell happened? Elaborate please

 Silly Andrei!!...yes I was in the hospital last week and I am still in convalescence for another week but I am fine and I am getting ready to face my six final exams...It's great to be alive.

 Doris ?! I've got a message from him yesterday morning... From his home. :) So if he is somewhere else now, I can only wonder how could the news get to Toronto so fast.. :) Mul, are you alive? By the way, I thought that the check ups with cute genecologist(e)s are usually in private offices :P Cheers dude!! And cheer up!! P.S. Does anyone have any " juicy stories " to convey? (I hope I'm not plagerising :P)

 What do you mean Mulanda's in the hospital????????????????????????????

 Well, I survived my evil GRE...so glad that's over with. Thought you'd like to know that I'm competing in an Indian dance competition at the Ottawa Civic Centre on the 29th of November. Audrey knows what I'm talking about... ^_- McGill has won this event two years in a row and we're hoping to make it a third. So, if any of you are interested, the website of the show is www.savari.com. There are video clips and photos of last year's acts. Hope midterms haven't treated you too badly...

 Thanks for coming over, dudes. Andrei, Maria says hi.

 Toronto rocks! (I mean Vlad's & Audrey's), We're chilling aroung with quite some friends, eating, drinking, dancing, etc... :) Went to Niagara falls today, pretty cool. Tomorrow heading back. Cheers!!

 Likewise, Viv. So is anyone coming or not?

 Merry Christmas everybody!!!!!

 OK, Andrei, here's the urlLink directions . When you get off the highway onto Islington, it's the very first turn to the left - across from CitiFinancial. Good luck. Make sure someone in the car has a cell phone. You know my number. We are expecting you guys on thursday.

 actually Andrei, that's quite a compliment, thanx :). All the stories I wrote so far are my impressions of the midterms and the finals. Sorry plans for new year's are holding somewhere else, unless its in Montreal, then yes presence will be made.

 so who's going to TO except me and Jeka?

 by the way are you in MTL?

 No, and I think we had something different as a subject.

 yep... right... By the way, do you still have your technology essay, Vlad? :)

 Andrei, I would suggest you erase/alter the name to avoid the unexpected search engine hits... Now sit down and write an excellent boring essay. Fais, don't worry, Andrei did not want to insult you.. :) So, in the end, besides Andrei and Eugene, who else is in? Fais?

 by the way Fais, did you write the story?

 oops, my comp is playing wired games with me... I like his "thanking you for your cooperation" part at the end :) this was my answer, I hope he won't be upset Dear Mr. N., The file I've sent you is my technology essay in verse. The topic for this assignement was to "write a significant personal essay on your views about technology, its relation to you, your career, your society. Speak in a personal voice about your own relationship to technology. Give examples and tell stories from your own life experience." It is what I did in the essay entitled "I - Engineer". ... I thank you very much for understanding. Sincerely,

 dude, seriously, twice ? you're hoggin all the attention off my story , cmon now ..hehe kiddn, but seriously why twice?

 Alright, this is what my teacher send me in response to my sending him the Technology Essay. (the poem one) Andrei, Hello and thank you for your message. I have verified the files attached to the messages that you sent -- and only the poetry works were included (as you can see in the file attached to this message). Could you email me a copy of your technology, and I will print out a copy for marking. Thanking you for your cooperation, Best regards, Mr. N. Lecturer, Communication in Engineering I'm shocked & lost ...

 Later on, after this glorious victory (and maybe others similar to this one) our hero became the beast himself, and new men went out to challenge him.

 Endgame ...so he may rest for a while. [...a Week ago...] The sun was merciless and the winds still, as the day continued on. Our hero had been tirelessly fighting with every breath that his lungs could draw in, however, the adversaries he faced were far smaller than he had expected. Nevertheless, he continued to shed blood, carefully noting that not one scar would appear by mistake. He would have to conserve his strength for an opponent of titanic state. Dusk soon turned to dawn, and our hero managed to catch but a few moments of shut-eye, when suddenly he was awaken by the clitters and ticks of little vermins. He knew that what he had expected and was waiting was now at his doorstep. As he continued fighting the minions, the earth trembled at faster episodes as the monster approached closer. Our hero could smell the stench of vile acid as the ground got warmer... And there it was, standing before our hero, high up in the sky, as it was using the sky as its ceiling. Our hero stared up, at the ghastly apparition of the devil. "so this is the end, that everyone was warning me about", thought our hero. Suddenly in a flash of a moment, all the memories of home appeared. He saw himself as a young boy innocently playing around ignorant of the problems he was about to face. He remembered all the friends that he had been with. He asked himself whether he would ever see them ever again. As the roar of the devil grew louder and the impending doom even more imminent, our hero decided to challenge this beast. And so the fight began. There was lighting and clashing of blades and flesh. The spectacle was blinding, for the location was filled with smoke and an outsider would not have deciphered the state of the fight. There were shouts and cries and roars and taunts, but the status of our hero or the beast were unknown. There was too much darkness and too much light. There was too much noise and too much silence. Chaos was everywhere, the creatures of the forest had gone into seclusion for a even a passerby risked his life. The sky went dark and lightning struck as fires erupted all over amidst the ongiong fight. All this time, smokes covered the location of the two fighters. Suddenly a giant roar gasped out of the monster's lungs as our hero bellowed a yawp of pain.... The smoke cleared slowly and our hero was found leaning on the monster's chest, his head slightly bent and his hand tightly gripped and still shaking around his sword as the blade was sunk deep into the chest of the beast. Our hero drew in more breath , lifted back up the sword and dropped it back into the body for the final kill. Our hero made his way to the river and slumped down near the bank, as the water washed away the blood from his leather bootcuffs. His breathing turned to smaller intervals, as he drew into a gentle sleep. At that moment, something happened. The forest grew silent. Birds stopped chirping and the little creatures stopped moving and the wind stopped blowing. The trees stopped moving and the leaves stopped falling. It was as if the entire forest had acknowledged the acheivement of our hero and had decided to become silent ...so he may rest for a while

 Yaayyyyy!!!!!!!! No more exams!!!!! Don't mind me - slightly ecstatic about this whole 'no studying' thing... All right, slight change of plan, my family is NOT heading down to TO (at least, I don't think we are, unless my parents change their mind at the last possible second, which is rather unlikely). As for New Year's, that's still up in the air, seeing as two of my closest friends are heading out to Las Vegas... Anyway, hopefully we'll all manage to get together somehow this break. Take care guys and DRIVE SAFELY.

 I can't wait for Tygon's final remarks...

 My exam period is over. Wow, it doesn't even sound as big anymore. Just now I was sitting in a test; I finished everything except for one problem and one bonus question. I still had something like an hour to go. I got so lazy, it's not funny. To start of, I wasn't even stressed for the test; I studied for aprox. 10-12 hours for it two days before, making sure I got my beauty sleep (and considering that this was suppose to be my hardest class this semester). I was way more stressed for the so-called 'easier' classes, I studied for them like creazy and felt exausted when those tests were over. Nonetheless, never I felt that I have acomplished something after I wrote those exams. It sucks in a way. Just for stats, the one problem I didn't do in the test that I have just finished was the one for which I felt lazy. It was worth 20% and I left 2 pages required for the solution more-or-less blank; I honestly didn't really know how to solve it. Niether, I solved right the bonus question - I wrote an answer that is obviously wrong, since it contains no relavent thoughts. I hope to still will get around 80%. But man!! Where is my 1st year's enthusiasm to get A's all the way?! I'm putting it this way now: 2.5 years down, 1.5 years to go. (hopefully with no failures). See you all soon!!

 With Andrei's car, it will cost you $30-35 one way. One thing I will ask you though: please switch drivers every now and then. Falling asleep is very real, especially when it's dark. People, come on, who else is coming?

 ok, I'm up for 27th, if my parent's car will get fixed by that time. (I'm fairly sure it will). About the new years celebration, I'd like to have a party at my place, or we can go out somewhere (not expensive) instead. Some people I know are throwing parties at some clubs as well as making private parties. (And I'm not thinking about Tif's one, sorry Jeka). So what do you say? Viv, Fais, Mul, Waj, Vlad, Audrey, Jeka? I'll be also inviting some more people if an all-nighter will be held at my place, or even if we'll go somewhere else.

 Ok guys, the w-e of 27th sounds fine. Andrei, I say we go next week no matter what... I could probably even go work on puli-sacs with you for a couple of days to get some extra cash. Whoever wants to come to TO with us is welcome to join.

 We work on the 31st. The only two days that we're off are the 25th and 1st. I am open to ideas for the weekend of the 27th. What I had in mind is you all come on Friday night, we have a little party at our place. On Saturday, we can all go to Niagara, take pictures and stuff, then we can go out on Sat night or just stay in and gamble (optional). On Sunday morning, there is a nice breakfast place nearby. And then you can go home... :) So, what do y'all say? Viv, Fais, Waj? I don't know how many people are still reading this site... so whoever you are.

 I'm good for the 27th's week-end, but what about the 31st-1st celebration?? Is it included in the 27th starting week-end period? Vlad, Audrey, do you have special plans for the 29th-30th-31st-1st :), or are you working during that time? (hopefully not). Also, if we all come to TO, I guess we'll be following party ideas of Vlad and Audrey... If so, what are these thoughts (if it's not confidencial). I also have some fun friends in TO region; I can call them up in case we'd like to see what's going on in downtown TO, student-party-wise... I don't really think that I need to, though. Basically, I'd really like to get together during this new year's with all of you pple, especially those whom I haven't seen in a while, so post your plans here, so we can get organized. Thanks!

 OK folks, here's the thing. If anyone is coming, it should be on the weekend of the 27th. We will be in Mtl on the weekend of the 3rd of January. Next weekend (DEC 20th) is reserved for my family. As far as quantity is concerned, we have matresses for 6 additional people. The place itself is pretty big, so if you bring your own sleeping bags, all of the members of this lounge will fit without a problem. Everyone who plans on coming, please let me know for sure by the end of this week. Thanks!

 alright pple!! how about we splan what we'll do for new year's and not orthodox christmas... I have my appt free for any party if we agree; then it's possible to go to TO, I can drive, but i'd like 4 more pple in the car. What else? Vlad, Audrey are you staying in TO for new year's celebration? if so, going out or having an in house evening? How many people do you want to invinte at your place? And who else except Viv, Jeka, and me is considering going to TO? Vlad, Audrey maybe you'd want to come here instead? Also, I thought to go to Toronto and Niagara falls (or maaayybe Quebec city) before new year's with two french friends and maybe Valeisha. Dates were around 23rd-28th or 2nd-6th (for a day or two in either case). Jeka, want to join? Anybody else wants to join? So, who thinks what? Plzz post some clear wishes, if possible, and santa will work on them!! :) I haven't seriously thought about anything yet; but probably I'd prefer that we celebrate new year's at my place and go to TO for either chistmases.

 Hello to you all. Vovka, I was actually thinking of coming over the following week-end. Not for sure yet, but it would be really cool if you're in TO that week-end. Anyone else is considering the same?

 I might...it's my great-aunt's 75th surprise b-day party and my family's considering heading down to TO...we shall see...

 OK, guys and girls. Who is planning on comming over on the weekend of Dec 27?

 Roman, did you get my e-mail? I've sent it to your ottawaU address ?

 I'm doing fine, thank you. It's really been a while, Andrey :) Roman

 I'm doing fine, thank you, it's really been a while :) Roman

 I hope the teacher won't fail that paper :). Yeah, Roman how are you ;)?

 one of searchengine queries that made blog pop up (on december the 2nd 2003) was ... gay porn lounge !!! Eat that people :) Cheers!

 Thanks. Brass-Monkey, it's been such a long time!! I don't even remember who are you! Roman?!

 Nice Work, Andrey. I wonder how the teacher is going to react :)

 *applause*

 Wow, Andrei, I think you're doing much better! I liked it.

 Ok!!! Here's my essay on technology for my "communicaiton & engineering" class!!!!!!!!! :)) (normally it was suppose to be 4 pages long, or 8 double spaced, on some dull sujbect I can't even remember, that has something to do with engineering). Well, I wrote this poem instead... The ending is, well, something I wrote just to finish the essay. I - Engineer I drive, I ride, I fly and I stumble Over the head of this beautiful night. And here I am: a child of world's rumble Astonished by still air's delight. Yes, I was born in the era of changes (That's what we always think) So progress and knowledge (like in all ages) Formed in my brain a link. I studied, and ripened my flower of reason Eager someday to pop. Yet, knowledge flourishing with no wisdom Gives birth to a dangerous crop. That could have been me - an engineer: Ready to build and get paid. Making for whom? I have no idea. My point is to create! Starting with simple, like ovens and showers, I would want to explore. Searching for limits, abandoning shallows Spurred to craft more and more. And justifications for my conscience, Upon ethics of things I build, Would deeply be crammed under life's daily problems And comfort would kill any guilt. So I could be rich: a dad or a pervert. As pervert, I'd die in mislead. As father, I�d want for my kids to be learned On aspects of wisdom instead. So how did come about this matter Such young and arrogant I? Well, here are some points upon the latter Taken from my own life. I praised technology as a child: My toys, my TV, my bike. And I disliked the rest at same while As "hows" replaced my "why". With "hows" as questions, life was enclosed In the dust of my thick school books. Soon beauty notions were disposed of And boy�s pride caught me in loops. Then I had a challenge: to each time be better In everything that applies, Like a hardworking robot, I made it happen, Encouraged by success� lies. My mind was torn between winks of young ladies And absence of real goals So I dug the knowledge to always be ready To ace, yet, another school terms. I rushed through my years surpassing the progress Being trained to lead it one day; So most modern concepts of recent tech borders Were closely packed in my brain. Laptops and cell phones, mp3 walkmans Protruded from my teenage dream, And world�s education was adopted To fit my flat TV screen. So all this technology, did it help me To be a better man? Or did my ardor vanish as sanity Ticked by some weekly plan? Answer these questions my dear reader. What good did technology teach? Typing and driving and some fixed idea Of a smaller world to reach? Now, life seems so easy compared to times That plumes in old books describe. Nonsense; our present we�ll always exalt For our self esteem to rise. History studying, reading and traveling Showed me other ways For happy living, calmer prosperity And prettier values to praise. Yet, I won�t tell you of life beyond matter, Of morals, of soul�s cries. A wallet teaches you how to live better, And acumen is in your wives. On dull silver streets made of asphalt and concrete You won�t notice me: Another reflection in still shopping windows, Plain furniture that you see. I might be coworker, your neighbor � but stranger; A reflex of �hi� at the most. Yet, nice pretty car would extract a major Expression of respect and boast. So age my friend, and once you�ll compile The wisdom of lonesome grief; You�ll learn to be free like thoughts of a child, But it might be time to leave. Andrei Moskvitch � December 2003

 Mother fuckers...can't leave you alone for a couple of days as you start dreaming of me. Well, I had a fucked up night as well, couldn't fall asleep the whole time and when finally did kept on waking up because of the same kind of weird dreams. Oh I know, that's why I couldn't sleep, someone kept my attention away from sleeping. Vova we seem to have mind communication. So when I dream of you I'll let you know...hope it won't be dirty(kidding). Alright enough bullshit, let's get ready for those finals, 'sti.

 Nope, none of Jeka in my dreams, but ballistics - All the time!! :) And in those cheerful colors!! :)

 Yo yo. Represent. I want to take this moment to dedicate a few words to mi hom'boys. Big up to my man down south for the invitation, big up to tha Smooth Operator who don't be chekin his mail and big up to all of y'all and big up to all them happy people down in the south enjoying warm weather and casting them shadows in the sunlight. Ya ya, I know some of you in person and the others I see your faces every day so I feel like I know you aswell. A year ago I would have taken my identification as an McG ECE as an insult but now that I have seen how crap education is here I only have respect ... Yeah, so Cash, tell us more about fitting 6D into 2D? Guys ang gals check out this cool urlLink bike game .

 Maria is our mutual friend, Vova... Hey, Vano; Welcome.

 By the way, please welcome a *new* member of this joke of a group weblog: Ivan Savov! Thou shalt put yer brain power to the good of The Lounge! A McGill ECE student, he will be posting from Bristol, UK, where he is completing his academic exchange year in Electrical Engineering.

 Who's Maria?

 Assignements...assignements...Fuck off!! Already!! BTW, Vlad, Maria's daugher's shoes have been forgotten at my place. I'll give them to you whenever you're in town so you can pass them on to her, thnx.

 I don't know. I've never met her. Vlad's friend. She is a Russian studing in Concordia, I bielieve, about whom some McGill engineering pple told me.

 What's up bloggers? I have missed two straight days of school and it feels so great! I think I should quit school altogether! Andreii, Who is Irina?!

 I dunno. Probably in 2 weeks. Maybe. Whenever I come, I am bringing skis!

 Vlad, when are you coming to Mtl next time?

 Irina, do you know Bella &/or Chiristina?!

 Don't we always? ^_- Vlad, Université de Montréal won first place for Academics and University of Western Ontario won first place for Spirit at the science games.

 Don't mess with me now !

 Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the future Nobel prize laureate: Andrei Moskvitch. God help him put this discovery to the good of all Siberian mankind!

 the latter. :)

 Yet, represented 6 dimentions in 2D Did you simply collapse the other 4 to get a flat shape, or did you find space to store information about the other four dimensions somewhere else? If the latter is true, send me an email.

 Stayed up till 6:30 am last night discussing with Ludovic news idea for solving quantum mechanic's present problems and trying to redifine aspect of four main fources in ANY other model than particle or waves one. Failed miserably. Yet, represented 6 dimentions in 2D which didn't lead to anything significant. Finally, influenced by hunger, phisical exhastion, mental excitment, fumes of marihuana and constant intake of tea and sugar, we've came up with an interesting concept of modification of Borh's atom in oder to account for wave-like & particle like beheavors of energy and matter. Fell asleep, desperately thinking about reparking the car in a few hours. Got up to repark it, realised that it wasn't necessary; oh well, time to go to class.

 Well, stop acting like an American then.

 hey, I'm Russian and proud to be one! :) Great job Viv, mind sharing those 'very special' experiences ... ?! I can't believe that my outside thermometer wasn't able to show the temperature this morning: it can't go below 30 degrees C! Shit!!! I LOVE Canada's cold (just because everyone else hates it :P )

 Andrei, quit with your Russian thing already. Congrats Viv. Who took the first two?

 Happy New Year to all of you. Just got back from the Canadian Undergraduate science (drinking?) games in Ottawa. McGill came in 3rd place for academics! Yaay! Lots of good (and very special...) times...

 Happy Old New Year!!! (Russian New Year!!) Best wishes. Today's resolutions are the onces that really count... There is no turning back anymore, 2004 will be in tomorrow! Do skorogo!

 wow, congrats dudes.

 tided for second-third at Canadian University Team Chess Champ Mulanda best player on the team 4/4 and best performance on the third board of the tourney. Good job!!

 Are there any FreeBSD connaisseurs on this blog?

 S Rojdestvom!!! (pochti nastupivshim!!) :) I'm going to St-Joseph's church for midnight mess. If any Russian or non Russian pple would like to join, call me 514-769-2649.

Also, afterwards, if anyone wants to come to my place for tonight's christmas dinner, please give me a call before 8:00pm and please bring some food with you, I'll be providing the alcohool. Actually, hmmm... wait... (!!) How about a dinner tommorow at my place, since it's the christmas day?!

 That's right Vova, you totally got it. Happy new school year to everyone. You and I, my friend, are now in the same boat for a certain time I think...But that's all good... Lots of love to you my children. Oh and for the Russians, s rojdestvom nastupaushim vas.

 Happy new school year to everyone. Keep it up, ladies and gentlemen.

 Well, happy new year pple! (Tipa) (back to school...)

 ANNOUNCEMENT: This Friday evening , first round of the Rock Festival where about 270 bands are participating. I'm going with some friends to a concert where 8 bands (of those 270) will be playing. The concert starts at 8pm somewhere on Ontario street. Tickets 18$ at the door, 10$ if you're friends of any band (which you are if you tell me by thirsday). At the concert we vote for the best groups who will make it to the second round. It will be great fun if you enjoy live music! So, Jeka, Vova, Audrey, Viv, Doris, Fais, anyone else who reads this, plzz contact me via here or email (@free.fr) or phone for your attendance. Hope to see you there.

 Yeah, right, no more news! And how about those two competitions that you participated in during last two weeks? I also believe that Viv has some portuguese blood, but Spanish might be easier to learn... As for Mulanda, well, basically, the girl to whom he has sent a dozen of roses for Valentine's was too overwhelmed with emotions about the flowers that she forgot about Mulanda... :( . My role is all that was much of encouragement for Mulanda, as well as being the delivery boy, who never went to deliver, since it was done by the store. A small detail to this story is that the girl is in many of Mulanda's classes and that they have many common friends :P. I don't know anymore upon this subject that all you now, so maybe Doris can spice my text up by some unexpected moves he ought to take to get the girl.

 Hello to you all. Feels nice to be back here. Andrei, I'm surprized nobody still knows about Saturday night adventures...like getting drunk (me that is) and driving on the mountain (you that is). Mulanda, what's up with all that, you seriously got a g-f or b-f or what? Clarifications would be much appreciated. Bibi, since when do you participate in here? Don't get me wrong it's great to have you back. Viv, sometimes I think there is something hispanic about you - es muy bien perque tengo que practicar mi espanol. Well, myself I'm doing alright... that's it no more news about me.

 busy, busy, busy

 This morning I went cross country skiing on the river near to my app. Very beautifull sights. Everything is covered in snow, the entire plane of the fleuve is white and shining under the sun's rays. In one place we can see the water, but everywhere else it's ice and snow. There were many pple fishing on the ice, some go as far as the middle of the fleuve (approx 50m from shore). They say the the ice is atlease two feet thick, but at one place when I went too far from shore, I heard cracking under my skies. I freaked out and rushed back. Hopefully noone will follow my ski trace and drown. Now it's time for Musee de Beaux Arts. Also yesterday we went on Mont-Royal to sliding on sldeges (one of my own design and fabrication from old downhill skies). :)

 hmmm... very interesting... Any other guesses?!

 Ok, I am thinking he got setup by Andrei, and now has a girlfriend. But from Viv's comment, this is not about a girl..." le moleste"...unless my spanish is getting rusty.

 You guys are SUCH pea-brains!!!! Mulanda, buena suerte, pero si hagas algo - CUALQUIER cosa que le moleste - te juro que te pegaré...

 Vlad, you statement is too vague. As they say in England: If you are givining it, you are NOT guay. My guess is it was a fight a la fight-club. Maybe with drugs and alcohol too.

 sounds like you guys have finally made gay love to each other.

 Leak?! that's not the nicest verb to use... I SHARE :) And don't you feel good and proud and alive (plus now you're the center of attention here). I'm announcing a contest: Guess what made Doris feel so great about his guts! (Viv is excluded, since she knows)

 Andreii, this is all your fault!!! I haven't had a decent sleep for a week now thanks to your extravaganza cheerful attitude.Had I known what it feels like to be...I wouldn't have dared it. I realize this is a community and the other bloggers have no idea what we're talking about (although I know you leak more stuff than the St-Laurent river) and I apologize but this is very personnal...ohhhh so personal I am irate. (Viv correct me on that word)

 Mulanda, may I elaborate on your bussiness, or will you inform the community yourself :P hehe :)

 Fine!! let's all babble about our troubles in this arena...Yes I admit I was more of a reader than anything else I apologize to the community, actually the reason I have been silent for so long is because, well I had to take care of some big business....Andreii knows what I am talking about. As for now I want to wish everyone a safe and happy spring break.

 yeah! That's the spirit!

 Man!! Does anyone write here anymore?! Or do we have a bunch of readers only?! I can't even complain about my mid-terms and be sure that someone will answer me! Or is this becoming a Vlad-to-Andrei-to-Vlad blog, sometimes visited by Viv, and Jeka?! Don't be shy pple, you won't look stupid no matter what you write! We all know each other here and our opinion of you won't change! Just don't be lazy hermits, community - that's the way!

 Wow, congrats Drei! What is the magazine? Can I subscribe? I hope the editor is not your sister :)).

 I got published!! :)) My translation of a poem got published in a magazine in France :). Here's the poem: Ballad About Nails Calmly, he finished smoking his pipe. Calmly, his smile left in a swipe. "Stand attention! Right turn!" Captain's gait - dry and stern. His words align with poise and force: "Weigh the anchor. Set the course. Those, who have a mother or a wife, Write to them - we won't come back alive. Yet, it will be a noble battle." And officers shouted: "Yes, capt'n!" As the most daring and youngest of all Thought, overlooking the horizon's wall: "Does it, actually, matter where? Lying in water seems calm and fair." In Admiral's quarters a report was done: "Mission accomplished. Survivors - none." Nails forged out of these men Would be the hardest in the world's ken. Original: N. Tihonov Translation: A. Moksvitch (copyright, January 2004)

 hmmm... so you guys did come up here this week-end and noone knew about it... Audrey called me yesterday, but these days email and blogger are the best ways to reach me, so plzz, next time you show up can you tell us in advance...?! Also, did Audrey start univesity this semester?! Alrighty, I'm going back to studing for my mid-terms.

 Well, how can I put this... Audrey could not find your cell #. Ridiculous as it sounds. We just went out for a beer at Brutopia and ate at Mikes. Not necessarily the most romantic evening ever, but I give little shit for the pop-holidays.

 Alrighty...what happened to you and Audrey????????? Weren't you supposed to drive up or something??? You realise I spent Valentine's up at the lab cuz you ditched me...sigh...yup, it was just me and my macrophage cells...at least they're low maintenance - something Andrei would appreciate. ^_-

 urlLink Yo-yo-yo check this out. The short answer is... to follow.

 are we going to see more of you this summer as well?!

 I dunno, maybe the site was offline. Viv, you'll see more of Audrey this summer :).

 Wow. By the way, why does my browser says that there is no connection to either vladster.com/lounge or vladster.com/sp ...

 I SPOKE TO AUDREY LAST NIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Sorry, just needed to share the joy... I'm sane. Really.

 O-H M-Y G-O-D.

 it's coming. Soon... :)

 Where's your poem, Andrei????

 So true...Isn't it a little early in the morning for deep thought???? Especially for you, Andrei! ;)

 Well, not really. I just wanted to ask again what's the purpose of life. ____________________________ presence of knowledge doesn't imply presence of thought, and surely not presence of wisdom or nalichie uma ne oznochaet nalichie razuma (Fonvizin) ____________________________ For example, we know all this, but we still don't live it.

 There is one thing about Andrei that everyone ought to admire: he always sounds as if he has just reinvented the bicycle. If I understand you correctly, then, yes, I agree that words and expressions can have different meanings. And I do not believe that any given word or expression has an inherent (or "proper") meaning other than what we assign to it. Socrates did 'start' as a sculptor, but so did a million other people...

 awwww.... Happy almost birthday... aw-m. :) growing further and older... By the way, it's you who's living in a different city :P. yet, you forgot to mention a neverending subject of you convesations. It usually starts like this: "Yaw! wow! Check that out!!" :) On a serious topic, as of a snap shot of my life... Well, did you know that Socrat started as a sculpter?! (well, I bet you did, since we learned it in school). Yet, I was thinking recently. Doesn't life remind you of a 'salle d'attente' in the moments when you're spending time, say with your friends, watching TV, relaxing, etc, etc.?! Don't the expressions: spending time ..., veging with..., chilling ..., etc, actually have a proper meaning than the ones we usually use?! Anyhow , (why does using this word seems absolutely normal in this context? What's the anyhow about here?!) I'm going back to studing for my mid-terms. (now, is there a possibilty of judgemnet & explanation given upon my reflections above, by the last sentence I used, or can be it just common way out from getting into my thoughts, avoiding submitting in a sense?)

 Hello, hello my people! Just when everyone thought I was dead, I make a spectacular comeback and breathe the life back into this place. Well, well, believe it or not, but somehow this peculiar webpage is nearing its 3rd anniversary. Which in itself is quite remarkable, if you ask me. Much has happened during these few years. We the inhabitants of this little weblog are growing further and further apart, living in different cities, acquiring new interests and loosing a lot of the things we used to have in common. I guess that's why anytime we get together for a drink at the piano bar, all we can talk about is Cegep, Bhatia, chessclub, hm... that's about it. Which is why I will continue maintaining the Lounge. And I hope you won't forget about it either. Be sure to post a piece of your life, a snapshot of your existence at least every couple of weeks. It's amazing what this project can grow into. I think some people on this team will make it BIG in life.. Rember my words, dudes and dudettes :). And this weblog can become the record of their progress, a time bomb of sorts.. That being said, I probably need to redesign this place to reflect the changes that have occurred in the most recent past. Once again, any suggestions about what this page's new look should be are more than welcome. Yours truly,

 Thanx guys! Surprisingly enough, I managed to make it through the day without be dumped in a snow bank or a recycling bin - first time in almost a decade...that in itself is a cause for celebration! Evgueny, I got your message on my phone, but, as you know, I was away this weekend and I didn't get the chance to get back to you. I would love to come on Thursday. It just depends how late my dinner runs (my friend, Andrea, is taking me out to Carlos & Pepe's). If I can't make it, 'merde' and break a leg. Congrats on your new title Doris! Hope your hipanic civ class is going well. Hasta luego chicos - y chica - Audrey, where the hell are you????????????????????????????????????????????????

 Ok everyone. First Happy Birthday to Viv. Now, since evryone is talking about going here and there, me too I just got back from Niagara Falls...ok, huh, alright? Also, muy importante. Some of you may have recieved already the email i sent. I wanna invite everyone to a Talent Show I am organizing at Concordia. It's gonna be held on Thursday February 5th, at ht e D.B. Clarke Theatre in the Hall building at Concordia. Doors open at 7pm, the event starts at 8pm. It's a $5 entrance ticket with which you also get a free beer (or another type of drink). There will be a lot great performances including myself and other dancers, singers, actors, jugglers, nunchuckers, cabaret acts, etc. You will not regret coming people, the show must be attended . If you have any questions do not hesitate to ask me. Ok so that's about it... Hope all of you can make it. Oh and Viv, if you come I'll pay your ticket. Later dudes

 tha's awesome, man!! Happy birthday Viv!! Congrads to Doris, as he is officially the top rated chess player of McGill Univesity (by the Canadian Chess Federation): Kayembe raiting 2305 Moskvitch raiting 2186 ...Yep, yep, yep...

 gee people, you're all over the place... well i went to this bar called Firkin and ate a lot of hot chiken wings. and it was fun.

 You'll have to tell us all about it...How many hearts did you break while you were there? ^_- I just got back from NYC last night. Sooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much fun! Now to catch up on all the work I didn't do while I was partying....hmmmmm.... ^_-

 few pple and I went to Quebec winter carnaval this sunday. It was a blast! :)

 Drunkeness? WHAT drunkeness???? I was tipsy once, ONCE in my life and none of you were there to witness it. So there! As for the conversation, it was about the existence of God, a topic I don't care to discuss on blogger. Humph...Andrei, I resent the fact that you are attempting to defame my character.

 I have no clue what the conversation was about (I wasn't really there at the time) but concidering level of Viv's drunkeness combined with Fais' 'wasted' sarcasm, Audrey's moodyness, Jeka's soberness, Valeisha's tipsy wittiness, Cleo's wasteness, Josee's " chyopornost' " and the rest pple's lound and unclear participation, the convesation may have touched a number of fetish subjects. The most likely outcome, however, I believe to be that niether Viv nor anyone else remembers what it was about. :) Yet, I recall very well that party finished (for me) at 7am with vodka and beer shooters with David's g-f (we had to finish the remaining alcoohol) and the kinky revealing (about David's g-f, and David himself) covesation that followed. Nothing bad was said, but it was quite stunning even to a wasted me. 'wink' 'wink'

 oh, come on! Andrei? Fais? Help me out here.

 Not bloody likely...

 hm.. hm.. excuse me, I did NOT pass out. My retiring to the bedroom was purely voluntary! I had to get some rest before driving home. What was the discussion about anyway? Can we continue it here?

 It was great seeing you all on Saturday/Sunday ;) I particularly enjoyed the fashion show...Andrei, I still have the article. Vlad, it's unfortunate you passed out so 'early' in the evening - we had an interesting discussion going. Audrey, feliz cumpleanos!!!! No olvides de darme tu direccion para que pueda enviarte tu regalo...I know you already know what it is, but for the sake of appearances, let's pretend you don't...

 Wow, it's been a while! Where have you been? Do you guys remember Amel? Well, she's ingaged. The lucky man is a ... FRENCHMAN de SOUCHE!! And I mean DE SOUCHE!! A christian nosy SURFER!! :) Wow, Amel! She doesn't sease suprising me after her journalism-oriented carriere decision. You go girl!! :)

 Heeeyy Im finally back!

 thanx bud, lookin forward to seeing u all there

 Fais! My address is 279 ave. Woodland metro Verdun. around 8pm-8:30pm later!

 I try not to Viv ;). Tonight is the first time this semester I stayed in the library untill (now) 2:10am. And it feels good. It feels just like the old times of freaking out every-minute-last-minute studing, except there is no more stress now. It's like early high school years: I know exactly for which grade I studied and what to expect.

 Good Lord!!!! Andrei, you NEVER give up! Evgueny, I wish I could have seen your tango - that piece is the most stunning part of Moulin Rouge.

 And news on my side. I was in The Gazette's this Sunday's issue (photo and name), while practicing for a dance for a fashion show held yesterday in Metropolis. :) The show was great! I and mean it. I danced Salsa and Swing in a group of 6 couples (there were: Jeka, David, Erika and other pple you don't know). It was the second dance show in my life (first one was with Audrey at a ball) and this time it was for a crowd of over 500pple! (thank god I had I couldn't see any of them because of the projector lights in my face and a good shooter of Vodka just before the dance, so I wasn't too stressed and simply prerformed the routine). The spectators were awesome too - it sounded like they loved us :). Yet, I know that I've screwed up a little at least in two parts of the dance. Of course, Jeka did more than one dance including a marvelous stunning Tango - "Roxanne" after which many the girls came to tell him how well, i.e. hot, he dances. Well, some chicks approached me too, but obviously, I didn't have time to flirt with any of them cause I'm a serious guy who doesn't have time for those silly amusements. (Nonetheless, those chicks were hot!! and I'm hoping to see one of them soon) . Besides that, yesterday also it was the first time when I entered my class room and acnowleged that my fellow classmates were writing a mid-term. Funny or ironic? I wasn't prepared at all since I thought that the exam was on thurday. The good thing was that it was open book and open notes, the bad thing was that my notes were at home and the book was in the library where I had to run to get it. Finally, I wrote the test and now I'm hoping to get at least 20%. Oh well.

 Vova, :)

 Just thought I would let everyone know how gorgeous Audrey looks lying in bed with her laptop screen projecting blue light onto her naked.. face. So, yeah. There you have it. "Audrey with laptop". Vlad (2004)

 Break a leg (or two) tonight, guys! Andrei, I have a copy of the article - sorry, I can't make it...these multiple McGill graduation balls are draining my bank account...

 its been a while... hope everyone's doin well

 Congrats, Evgueny! Andrei - my mom says to dilute the bleach 1:9 and leave your clothes soaking in it overnight before putting them in the washing machine. She also mentioned you were in the newspaper this morning...what's going on? Did you get arrested again??????

 Ok, hello all. Here are the updates on my TO performance. Came in 5th, competition was pretty heavy. Thanks to Vlad and Audrey once again for their hospitality. Later dudes...

 So, happy B-day to Audrey (once again) and to David who reads this blog once in a while. As for news, I'll be taking part in a danse in a fashion show in Concordia next tuesday (with Jeka and David in it). Also I'm attending Kong Fu classes 3 times a week (cool heh?!). I'll try to start filming a movie end of march. Anyone interested? I still need a light technician, a make up artist and actors (a variety of them, as extras and main actors). Decorations will prop be taken care by Cindy if she has time. Ray Phillips provides the equipment. Any pros in the field? Also my second mi-term period is coming up next week; final projects are due soon along with last minute assignements for the end of semester. Usual rush. :)

 HAPPY BIRTHDAY AUDREY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

 Actually, Viv, I can't make it. Have Fun! Vovka, I won't be able to come to TO this week-end either. Later,

 I'm interested, but I'll call you tomorrow to confirm. I'll also ask a bunch of friends tonight.

 Just wanted to let you all know that McGill is having a talent show on Thursday night at 8:30 pm at the Student Services Bldg. on McTavish in conjunction with Concordia. The money raised will be sent to underpriveldged and battered women in the Third World. Hope is the name of the charity organising the event and it's founded and run by a very good friend of mine (Anika, for those of you who know her). Tickets are $8 in advance, or $10 at the door. If you need tickets let me know, and I'll get in touch with the organisers. There will be several bands and dance groups performing and food will be served. Please come out and support a good cause!

 let me know where and when.

 Salsa, did you get a chance to speak to your partner?

 Hey peeps... Vovka, it was really cool you came to Mtl last week-end. It's fun reuniting with friends sometimes. I had a good time guys...and girls. See you in TO in about a week.

 "mie-mie-mie", someone has a vivid imagination ...

 Things I DON'T need to hear...

 I think he is lying about the pasta. I think he had the American Pie in that pot...

 Losers like me... ;) I'd been out late the night before for Holi, the Hindu festival of colour. In other words, it's an occasion that's an excuse to cover your friends in powdered paint and eat too many sweets. It was the dancing after that did me in, hence the early night. Andrei, you made a HOLE in a POT??????????????????????????? I'm surprised your house isn't a pile of ashes... Some people just shouldn't be allowed anywhere NEAR a stove...

 hi Viv! I did call you, but I thought I got a wrong number... Go figure. Sorry for waking you up. Hell, get a life anyway! Who sleeps at 2 AM on a saturday night? :)

 Just to copmlain: the cooking pot where I burned half a kilo of spaghetti for supper last week still has black pieces of the latter stuck to its bottom and I still can't scrub them off even with a fork after one week of dipping it in water mixed with many products including vinigar, alchool, etc. I'm afraid that I will have to thorw out this one of my mom's favorite cooking pots since today I have discovered that the its outer side of the bottom has something that rassembles a hole.

 Hi, guys! Vlad, did you call me from Evgueny's phone last night? Things are a bit hazy...I was asleep and a vaguely remember my phone ringing, but not much after that...Anyway, hope I didn't say anything rude and unforgivable. Ooopsy... ;)

 gee, look at this guy. he is all about extracurricular activities! we are coming to YUL late at night this Friday. well, actually I am coming for sure; Audrey might have to work this weekend... if someone wants to do something late on saturday night - I am (we are) up for it. and late means after 11-12, because we will be having dinner with my family on saturday afternoon-night.

 bragging: I'm going for a snowmobile trip in Quebec city thursday and friday and a ski trip on sunday :)

 So, anything for this week-end? Vovka, Audrey, when will thou have free time?

 Hang there Mulanda - the new Canadian Citizen!! Congradulations!! Don't warry, you'll be graduating this year (I hope, because I don't want to see you running after those undergrad chicks anymore, they'll all be left to me!! :P) This week-end party times sound great! My suggestions are: lounge like night at my place anytime (I can invite some of the stiptease girls I've met recently, Vlad, you'd like em :P). Also, creazy club dansing sounds good to me, or we can check out budda bar (for some reason it became a popular place amongst students) or if a very nice place is Go Go lounge, espesially if we'll reserve a table there in advance and get a bottle (around 140$-160$, so 20$/person or so). Who's in?

 I am home cooking steak and sipping on red wine after a rewarding but exhausting 11-hour work day. My first school day is next Monday. Needless to say, this calls for a partey! I am in town this weekend indeed. Audrey was not able to switch shifts, and she is forced to once again stay in the TO. I will call the smooth operator Andrei and we will get the ball rolling from there... The suggestions box is open!

 2 hard exams in a single day. I mut have failed one of them for sure. This was no doubt one of the worse days of the year for me and I have had too many already. Someone throw me a lifeline.

 MY THESIS IS DONE!!!! Handed it in this morning...never EVER want to hear about macrophages and mice ever again. Mulanda, how did your exam go?

 With GREAT pleasure! You really DO want to fail, don't you? ;)

 Hey Viv! I know you have so much energy left in you (well, you are in Micro), Perhaps, you could do my hispanic Civilization final on Friday, now that you have put me in this mess!!!

 LAST UNDERGRADUATE EXAM EVER!!! Yayy! Now, all I have to do is write up my thesis...Vlad are you coming to town this weekend?

 over, over my exams! I'm going party!! :) so long fellow students! so long library rats!! see you in 8 month for another intense ass working out session!!

 eldorado at vladster.com

 Hey vlad, what's your email address?

 Hey Roman, no it's not my server, it's hosted by revolutionhosting.net, courtesy of John. What up John. The job market in the greater TO area is tough. The funny thing is if you know French, it is easier to find any job, even the one in which you will never speak French. Andrei, you need to read urlLink this .

 vlad, is www.vladster.com your own server or smth..? or anyone, hook me up with a reliable shell

 man, it's the first time that I actually really miss my parents alot, especially, that I've just drove them to the airport. Yet, they'll be coming again to mtl in about two weeks. It's amazing how much I enjoyed their stay here for past two weeks!! It felt really like home... (the atmosphere)

 One down, two to go...NO MORE PARASITES!!!!! I had my parasitology final today. Spanish literature is tomorrow - maldito Garcia Lorca! Audrey sabe de lo que estoy hablando.

 Hey Guys... Long time no post ;) I'm just bored with all my economics shit right now... I have a game theory exam and a public sector economics exam tomorrow :( I'm about to go and shoot myself. How's everyone holding up during exam period? Hey Vlad, got any job openings in TO?

 Cash beware! Roth also takes down names but it is not to give them good grades... I have a shait Philosophy paper to write. I have forgotten what it is to have work to do. My exams are in a month -- all 10 of them. It is all idiot-level examination (the locals are not too smart) but when there are 10 of them at the same time it might get ugly. The plan is to come back on the 17 th of June I think I have a ticket booked but I am not entirely sure I ca trust their online system. Then it is either urlLink Honk Kong or Vancouver or just sitting around at home and smoking bagfulls of medical-quality weed. Peace

 ok, two down one to go. :) it wasn't too bad after all. This morning I went to see the teacher to ask him questions, and he took down my name, asking me how much I need in this exam to pass the course. I guess It's a good sign :P

 first of all it's LALA , like la-la-la-la, you know! and most probably we'll be seeing each other tomorrow night. now I have 11 hours and 39 minutes left before my test, and I still need 9 hours of problem solving (at least) to be able to get a good grade. well, motivation, here I go!! :P

 hey bloggers....been chilling in the library all day, can't get a single thing in my crazy mind. Hard to keep the mind focussed in the library these days. Enough about me, Andreii how is the good "LAILA" doing? what did u guys do, have dinner at Tim hortons? lol. Vlad, how are you doing in TO,I hope to visit you again this summer. Vivianne, vivienne, viv, how are those micro bacteria treating u these days? hope they are keeping u busy. Hasta la vista senores

 Vania, Ivanushka, how's Angliya ? So when back coming hea?

 ya ya! exam paranoia again is being shoved up my..! tss-tz! luidi vokrug, ya uchius'! (..., na perekosiak!) my favorite, dudes and duddetes, it's 00:23 wednesday, test in on thursday and I'm half way done. (first half was worked on since saturday). Chicks, chicks, chicks, why are you waving your buds around me? I not need your smiles now, I need'em in two days, better - a week! Jis! in a week I won't have the stressed up - fucked - up daring mood to slap the latter, and get your #! And now interest in either means another 500$ for retaking a course in a summer or next semester! A need a 65% to pass, fuck!! 65 per cent! no more time to chill. back to flattened, thin, dead tree pieces with scribbles of ink!

 Ivan, when are you back?

 hey Andrei, I don't know, I have not had any problems accessing it using IE, Mozilla or Opera. Does anyone else have similar issues (assuming someone actually reads this)? Or maybe McGill is blocking this website as detrimental to education :).

 /sp and /lounge dont work on netscape at mcgill and sometimes on explorer as well at mcgill.

 Andrei, if you are talking about vladster.com it is normal that there is nothing. Vlad has moved his blog to vladster.com /sp (semantic paralysis).

 man!! something is really wrong with vladster.com I can't login to it from any browser.

 she's been gone for only a week, Vova ... :) chill! :) But of course the lounge will not die out now. Valeisha and Ludovic also have blogs. Links to them are on my blog. Oki-do-ki (it sounds so gay, but it's commonly used at mcgill) Back to my books!!

 I very well might. But what would we compete for? Gee, everyone has a blog. What a bunch of self-indulgent losers we are. Everyone just needs to get laid and chill.

 Oooooo, Vlad - looks like you've got competition... ;)

 ok cerafin1.blogspot.com

 never mind, vladster.com doesn't work on mcgill's netscape. Who wants to study together? I'm pretty much in the engineering library everyday all day usually on 4th or 5th floor. Some times I study with some of my french buddies. Rarely with engi students.

 Happy easter everyone to whom it matters! Somehow vladster.com/ anything doesn't work anymore. Have fun studying pple! Take care,

 Happy Easter!!! Audrey, feliz Pascua - espero que estés disfrutando de tus vacaciones en Londres - no olivdes de sacar fotos!

 Happy Easter! Audrey, feliz Pascua - espero que est�s disfrutando de tus bellas vacaciones en Londres...no olvides de sacar fotos!

 hmm....in all the dreams? what could this mean , other than, you've run out of things to dream about, :P, no burn intended :P

 Doris, can you share the dream? was it on the night of Thursday to Friday?

 Congrats on your first project, Andrei!

 Hey my lovelies!! glad to see that every one is in a cheering mood.Andreii, 'm happy to see that you have finally begun to put your energy where it matters the most, don't get too passionate about school though the same way you get passionate about girlz; it's bad enough having you horny ali the time, I can't imagine what a nerdy Andrei would look like....ohhh boy. Vivian, vivian, vivianne, you were in my dream last night and the night before that. what does this all mean?

 yeahhh i finished the project. 50 pages with not a single word of bullshit everything is there - appendicies, references, tables. almost no pictures only a few small free body diagrams total 32 pages of actual analysis - equations, assumptions, results i'm proud it worked. total of approx 40-50 hours of work that's more than a fulltime week of any job.

 Yeah and I have his "mommy" to myself for 2 weeks. Andrei, library is good but you need to study in a group or else it will get to you. Find similarly paced individuals and work in a group. This is what studying is all about though. When you have to do it. Satisfy the real-time requirements of INPUT into brain STORAGE for a little while and OUTPUT on a sheet of paper. Music is also good for your life. Here is a urlLink little tune that will give you a boost. For best results listen repeatedly.

 guess what? mommy went to London, and I have the place to myself for 2 weeks!

 well, guess you're not then. :P still need the explanation?

 WHAT?????? Care to explain?

 No shit, Einestein's wife!!

 I think you're losing you're mind...

 Library is cool. Library is the place to be. It's the party place. The after-party place is either a computer lab where one 'concludes' with the project, or a final examination class room where many of us 'conclude' with the test, all at the same time...

 I'm choosing bevel gears for it now. Then it's going to be bearings. Holly-flaming-balls of Jesus. It all takes sooo much time.

 Yeah, I figured that Gringo will try to choose some kind of an impress-13-year-old-boys-cool name for this junk of metal.

 You DO realise that an osprey is a raptor (i.e. bird of prey)?

 yep, yep; the stupid useless osprey machine

 Hey Andrei, is it V-22 "Osprey" you're talking about? Other than that, I have to point out that the pre-loading and oiling processes are crucial indeed.

 Jeka how was the competion? What's the schedule for next week one? Ticket price, 30 or 40 I don't remember? Doris, how're studies? Vlad, what will you do once Audrey leaves for the trip? I'm in the library for a second frull day straight. I have to get used to being here for next three weeks as much as possible. Plus, knowing that my mid-term failing rate was near 50% this semester and the non failed onces were around 60-70% tests, I should know what to do. So once again, I'm getting stressed for a number of things, soon fatigue from lack of sleep and good food will accumulate, yet, a failure is not yet on the horizon as the number of cycles hasn't even reached it's midway value. I can also add some equations here about safety factors, preload and load conditions, maximum thrust, temperature limits and oiling and repare procudures. Yeah, stress and stain relations are not even being mentioned here since types of elasticity moduli are variable. Shit! I'm actually designing a some real shit for a V-22 US Airforce plane-helicopter hybrid!! Wow. Talking to myself outloud is the most important part of the project.

 Wow!! Congrads Viv!! You rock. I guess you're the first one (at least to annouce it!) Who else is a potential grad? Doris? Fais? Nope, my April 1st was very calm.

 I hope your prankster ambitions were fulfilled, Andrei - though I do pity the poor souls who were the targets of your scheming. On another note, my graduation ball is tomorrow!!! Yay!

 have fun in your april fools guys! I wonder whom am I actually going to get today :)

 Viv, I'm not trying to defame your charachter . Rather, now we at least know what the conversation was about :)

 No we won't be in town this weekend. But we will be in town Friday the 4th of June early in the morning. Please be free on the following Saturday and Sunday. Big Paty man!!!!

 Salut, les gars - et les filles ;) - happy birthday, Andrei, once again. Qu'est-ce qu'on fait ce samedi? Vlad and Bibi (j'adore ton profil - the photo was a nice touch), will you be in town?

 Happy B-day, Andrei best wishes.

 Yeeeelow! The glory days of the leather sofa are over. This is the preliminary layout, which will probably stick around forever anyway. I know it looks generic (I didn't design it), but the temptation of having someone do the work for you for free is overwhelming. I really have no time to play around with templates anymore. Please let me know what you think. Suggestions are welcome. Also, feel free to edit the profiles on the right and insert your pics! Knock youselves out, ladies and gentlemen.

 hapy bday cash johnny, so what is it now, 64 , 65? howz old age holding up with you?

 Happy B-day Mr. Cash!!!

 so there's my birthday is coming up :) so this week-end for a two day party. Audrey, I visited some places with jeka yesterday and they all see pretty good and not too expencive some of them, all drinks included. :) So I'll talk with you today. cheers!

 yeah right Audrey!! Like that's you!!

 wow!! I still have get used to this layout, but honestly, I do like the previous more. It was more of home-like place. I'll play with setting my profile later.

 hey, what's with the pessimism? cheer up my man. we all need another big party!

 Wow...blogger is all new now. At least something brings light to this whole boredom thing lately. Yeah boredom it is people, now that I'm jobless and my dance practices are gonna stop for a while, I feel like I'm on another planet. And it's really hard when you're not used to it. Well if anyone has suggetions of what to do this weekend, let me know. Or else I'll just go running on the Mont-Royal...hey that sounds loke fun.

 you can read urlLink cerafin for news on my trip (if interested) :P Yay!!

 first day in Paris: biked around Notre-Dame de Paris, looked at Seinne and the passing crowd realizing that I'm back here again, recalling many things. Then a dinner at my sister's: traditional Raclette, finally sleep. Day: got together with some chicks I knew here from school, heard the gossipis, flirted a bit, ate lunch with them. Then got a paper from a secretary here, telling her that I came to Paris only to pick it up since she didn't send it to me through out the year (she was pretty shoked). Around 4pm met up with two good friends of mine and spend the rest of the day with them changing bars and restaurents till we couldn't take it anymore... fweeh! Finally sleep again.

 This is a test email-to-blog post. 1, 1-2, 1-2-3!

 Yo Cash, if you have enough cash to get yourself to London you could come and visit moi in Bristol for an additional 3pounds. I am sure they have trains PAR-LON all the time. If you can teach me fluid mechanics that would be even better!

 Bon voyage!!! Have a safe and lovely trip - PLEASE tell me you've packed!

 ok, I'm leaving to paris in 4 hours! Take care pple!! All my love :P Hope to see you all soon. I'll posting on CERAFIN as well as here any of my extraordinary adventures.

 Hey, I'm always positive. And when is it that I felt bad... no names for now.

 O-oo. Mr. Una Salsa "feels good" again... What's her name?

 What's up everyone, how's life? Great stories and stuff, just dropping by to say hi. Man, does it feel good or what. I think we should all have some crazy party this summer... Ok I don't know what to say, ciao.

 That's a great idea!!! If you're referring to the middle logo ON THE RIGHT, it's the Ottawa U, Roman's school. I need to refresh my rusty photoshop skills.

 by the way, what's the middle logo on the left? And there might be another canditate of putting a logo on the right side of the sofa... :)

 *applause**applause*

 Bravo! Nice twist at the end.

 Wow, very very nice parable!

 La Petite Catherine Catherine vie dans une maison qui fut construite en 1901. C’est un bâtiment qui, grâce à une fondation solide construite uniquement de pierre et de marbre, aujourd’hui tient toujours. Catherine est fière de sa maison. Ses grands parents ainsi que ses arrières grands parents y ont vécus. Un après midi, lors de sa sieste, Catherine fut réveillé par une odeur qui venait de la cuisine. Elle connaissait bien cette odeur. Une odeur qui la fit sauté de joie. Catherine ne perdit pas une minute. Elle descendit les escaliers tranquillement en faisant, bien sur, attention pour que personne ne l’aperçoive. On lui avait défendu d’être dans la cuisine après une certaine heure, mais son estomac affamé depuis déjà six heures, lui ordonna de suivre l’odeur jusqu’à la cuisine. Elle due tout d’abord descendre le grand escalier de marbre qui menait directement à la cuisine. La première chose qu’elle vit sur la table était un grand morceau de fromage orange déposé sur une belle assiette de verre. Elle désirait tant y goûter. Elle se rappela soudain de ce que sa mère lui répétait sans cesse : « Ne soit pas si gourmande Catherine, ce n’est qu’un défaut qui n’attire que des ennuies. » Ça mère avait raison. La gourmandise n’est qu’un défaut. Mais elle ne pouvait se faire à l’idée qu’il était possible de s’attirer des ennuis par une si petite chose que celui de satisfaire son estomac de temps à autre. Ça ne pouvait quand même pas la tuer. Bien au contraire elle croyait que ce fromage lui ferait plutôt du bien. Elle pouvait déjà goûter l’odeur alléchante du péché mignon. La table était bien haute, et elle bien petite. Cela ne faisait qu’une semaine qu’elle puisse marcher par elle-même. Déterminée à obtenir ce qu’elle voulait malgré sa petite taille et ses courtes jambes presque instables, elle s’acharna à l’escalade. Après plusieurs échecs et de nombreux effort, elle fut finalement sur la chaise, et assez près du fromage pour y goûter. Les petites mains de Catherine brisèrent un minuscule morceau du beau morceau orange. Elle ne voulait pas qu’on s’aperçoive que le fromage fut goûté. Mais il était tellement bon, que son estomac lui pliât d’en prendre plus. Cette fois ci, elle en prit un, un peu plus gros. Ah! Qu’il était bon. L’extase lui donna quelques frissons aux doits. Soudain, un bruit la fit sursauter. Quelqu’un s’approchait de la cuisine. Elle devait partir. Elle ne voulait pas être grondé. Elle descendit rapidement sur le plancher de la cuisine avec un peu de difficulté. Les nombreux petits morceaux qu’elle avait pris lui avait remplit l’estomac et rendue un peu lourde. Au moment où Catherine, toute excitée de plaisir, avait atteint l’escalier de marbre, un choc la paralysa. Elle n’ut le temps de ne voir que son corps se détacher d’elle. On lui avait coupé la tête. Catherine ne sentait plus rien, ne voyait plus rien, mais pouvait encore goûter les miettes du délicieux morceau de fromage orange qui lui restait sur la langue. Son ouï coupé de vie détecta un dernier son qu’il lui était inconnu, un grondement horrible s’évanouir en même temps que ses pensés. « Maudite souris! ». Audrey Laurencelle

 I am sorry I was unable to go out last night. How about next weekend?

 Holly shit. Can you imagine how this might change the mankind? I can't.

 Good news everyone! I have just found out, that quantum teleportation was done with actual particles, atoms, for the first time in the history of mankind. Perhaps you've heard of this already, that it was done with photons, which hardly qualify as actual matter. However, it seems technological issues were resolved, and now actual heavy matter consisting of quarks can be teleported. The New York Times June 17, 2004 p.A21, reports that two teams, one from NIST, Boulder, Colorado, another from University of Innsbruck, Austria, have teleported atoms of beryllium and calcium, respectively, as published in Nature, June 17, 2004. The setup involves triplets of charged atoms (A, B, C) which are trapped in magnetic fields. 1. B and C are entangled. 2. C is moved away. 3. B and A are entangled. 4. The state of A and B are read, which affected C at a distance. 5. When a pulse of laser light was aimed at C, then C was turned into an A (but which destroyed the A,B state, by the no-cloning theorem) I got this off Wikipedia. urlLink Wikipedia Article

 This place looks different....the poem sucked.

 A Russian poem urlLink Blitz

 but I won't mind being the minister (if the nomination would have had any value in the European Union). I believe that I could make things better in the direction that I find to be the correct one for the moment.

 blah-blah-blah. sometimes you think in the wrong way.

 What a load of b/s. I think we should nominate Andrei for the position of the Immigration Minister of the new European united government .

 Well it suprises quite a bit. I'm not really rasist nor fashist, only against stupid, closed minded, and motivated crazy pple who exist in all religions, beliefs, and colors. But media says that France should have expected such things a while ago. Plus, it's only the beginning for Western Europe, as analysts say. Also similar stuff is happening in the States regarding color. And ANALYSTS and those who PREDICT things. Why don't they take a gun and go shoot down all the 'threats to society' instead of analysing actions of people and the consequences as well as response actions of government and consequences, at the end staying neutral and telling everyone: "we're just telling what is going on and will go on, we love you all, don't hurt us, hire us, we'll tell you what do to, and you'll take the responsability for your actions." Ugly donkeys they are! I loved a statistical research earlier this spring made by the new European united government. It says that with all the immigration and birth of certain kinds of nations in some European contries, places like Spain (in 30 years) will have a majority of Albanian/Arabic population. Germany in 40 years - asian/african. France today - equally arabic/asian/french in 20 years majority arabic/asian. Belgim in 30 years - african/arabic/asian/slavic(!). England, obviously, Indian in close future as well. The rest I didn't read. The only thing that dispises me here is that many immigrants (like most russsians in Mtl btw) do not find it necessary to be educated if a bussiness is going well. Or, even worse, become educated to do more bussiness and crush all the surrounds to make sure that you'll always stay. Some sort of this kind of mentality: urlLink Poésie

 O-Oh.

 One imam in Roubaix met Lille mayor Martine Aubry on the edge of the Muslim-majority neighborhood where he preaches, declaring it Islamic territory into which Mme. Aubry--the most important minister of labor in modern French history, the early favorite to win France's presidential elections in 2007, and the daughter of former prime minister Jacques Delors--had no authority to venture. Interesting. Is it really that bad in France, Andrey?

 hey viv, i do hang around at the corner of maisonneuve and mackay but not at the second cup, i hang around at the cafe depot. pass by sometime if uc an, my cell phone's stolen, so home phone functional at the moment.

 Yeah, you can count on my bringing my car along with me. I have 4 places free.

 The Oka offer still holds. Here's a urlLink permanent link to that post. Please post a comment whoever is interested.

 I was trying to post a comment on the old layout page, but it directly switched me to the new one. Well, I'm in for Vlad's idea for Oka if that still holds. Thanks for your SuperGlue offer Vlad. I'll see if having a car that day is a possibility, although I strongly doubt it. I'll get back on that... Anything new with you people?

 ha, ha. I was going for dinner with some friends of mine who happen to live on McKay and I was running slightly late.

 Second Cup is a funny place to be in when you're in a rush... Were you in a rush for a cofee?

 Fais, random question - do you by any chance hang out at the Second Cup on Maisonneuve and McKay? Thought I saw you the other day, but I wasn't sure (and I was kind of in a rush, so I didn't check...)

 Hello all, I got some some calls from Andrei about the old port, but I was at Winnie's at I had been there since 3 in the afternoon and after couple of multitudes of drinks, everything is hazy, including your decision making. I would have liked to see you guys, but there's always a next time, and I will make sure I get together with u (vlad and audrey mostly) . I long to see you guys, and in due time, I hope it will be so. Take care everyone.

 Just thought you might find it interesting. This blog ranked 6th in a search for " urlLink canada porn ". Also, someone asked for urlLink Andrei. Twice. Andrei, have you finally found yourself?

 NO WAY!!!

 It's ENlightening...

 Hm... I might as well go ahead and read that inlightning book.

 Satan was one of the angels of God. And he was the one who loved God the most, worshiped only God and lived only for God. So once God created men, he told to all the angels to love and worship men before him. But Satan refused to love and worship men as he loved only God. He told that to God and God became mad and told Satan to go to hell! That is how hell was created and Satan became the so called 'dark angel' of God. That was LOVE.

 The Power of Myth by Joseph Cambell (or Campbell) is a very inlightning book to read or CD/DVD series to listen/see. Wow, I didn't know that such scientists/philosophers existed in the states as recently as 30 years ago. If anyone of you will get your hands on his works, don't hesitate to spend some time thinking into them

 I've been meaning to write something for a few days now. Yesterday I wrote a large post, just to find out how irrepairably corny it was and delete it. So yeah, I have no drive to get personal on the net anymore. And this place will remain boring untill someone goes to some distant part of the world and posts from there.

 Oh man... it's being a long long time since I posted anything... oh well... Hi everyone! I've got my own blog too!!! :) so instead of me writing pages and pages about what's up with my life, why don't you all just jet over! It's at http://www.blog.jydesign.biz :-)

 arrrre you rrrready to rrrrumble!!!!!!!!!!

 it's hot, so you need to sweat to cool down and become like a sleazy ball lol&nbsp; :)

 The world is full of maniacs. Just check out www.reactOS.com and ww.CoLinux.com The first is a Windows 2k clone written by some kamikadze (at it's infancy, but actually runs...) and CoLinux lets you run Windoze & some linux distro _simultaneously_. No dual boot needed. Makes me feel like the geekiest geek of them all, hehe

 The HUNT for&nbsp;the only American World Chess Champion - chess legend of one of the greatest chess players of all times ended this week as he got arrested in Japan and will probably will get deported to the US while&nbsp;being accused&nbsp;of playing chess. &nbsp; urlLink The warrant for Fischer was issued by a grand jury in 1992 when he violated US sanctions against Yugoslavia by playing a match there against Boris Spassky&nbsp;&nbsp; ...&nbsp;&nbsp; He acted illegally when he violated an executive order signed by President Bush. Not a law passed by Congress. &nbsp; The&nbsp;order told him not to play CHESS in Yugoslavia (!!!!!)&nbsp;

 Trip to Gaspesie was great!! Here is a urlLink long review of the trip and a urlLink short &nbsp;one. Pictures and more impressions&nbsp;might be posted later on as well on two more blogs. :)

 How was Gaspésie?

 He is Laflamme who later became head of the quantun info institute in Waterloo.

 Hm... I guess I will stick with my Pentium 4 for now. I was going to get a newer machine, but since the quantum computer is about to hit the shelves at Future Shop, I will wait. Ir, who was that skinny guy who was giving the lecture about quantum computing at McGill the other day? Anyone of significance?

 The montrealer's name is Gilles Brassard from University of MTL. There is also quantum research in McGill with Crepeau (not sure about spelling), and Laflamme from the institute of quantum information in Waterloo.

 The article is geniune, don't be a fool. Photons were teleported in 1998. I was just waiting when something more tangible would be teleported. (What's a point of teleporting photons at speed of light, just beam the laser at something, done). Yes, full scale teleportation is far too remote, I don't even know why would one speculate about it, but there is nothing that says it is not possible. A quantum system can be teleported as long as no information is learned about that system, otherwise we are gonna have difficulties measuring it, due to the heisenberg principle. Who gives a damn about that. If those experiments were possible to perform, that means, that technologically, quantum computers are not that far away. Imagine chips operating at speed of light, and transmitting whole loads of information in one shot, that could mean rendering 3D images/video in realtime(or much faster), instead of weeks, as it is now. (This is how primitive my imagination is, yes-yes). (I also heard that quantum computing will enable us breaking pretty much any type of encryption available today) Who is that Montrealer...? I've only heard that Rutherford studied at McGill for some time, that's all. "Everyone should know that most cancer research is largely a fraud and that the major cancer research organisations are derelict in their duties to the people who support them," Linus Pauling, Nobel Laureate for Peace and Chemistry. (What's ironic about this, I've never met a single person who doesn't think Nobel Prize for Peace is a fraud, hehe)

 If you are doubting the accuracy of this article, you should check out the research team's web site. I don't see why it is not possible, similar experiments have been conducted successfully for years now.

 urlLink http://www.sciencenews.org/ is not bad.

 is there any other sources that describe the same experiment? I've learned recently that New York Times likes to post 'shocking' scientific stuff once in a while and then never come back to the topic again, so then everyone forgets about it since it wasn't 'really' true. I've seen Nature magazine before, but never read it so can't judge it's credibility. I also tried to find some info on the sites of the universities but couldn't.

 Yeah, this whole field is quite facinating. But I think that the word "teleportation" should not be interpreted in the Star Trek sense... It is not as if an entire particle has been moved at a speed faster than light to a far away location. In fact, it is two particles sharing a "special" relationship and one transmits its state to the other through a mysterious channel. I think it will be useful to transfer secret information rather than a bank safe. Did you know that one of the inventors of the theory of quantum teleportation is a Montrealer :) ?

 Actually, my comment it was genuine. I can't imagine how different the society will be. It's really beyond my imagination, and I don't know of any futurist who would attempt to describe a society structure that could result if ever teleportation is achieved for "large" objects. How about we make this thought experiment collectively and post our findings here? You may choose one economic institution (such as education or banking) and try to see how it could be affected once large-scale teleportation is possible.

 Vlad your contempt is out of place here. Just because you have severed off your ties with that part of science that has no immediate consequences to the real world does not mean it is not important. You are taking pot-shots at your old girlfriend just because you are not together anyore... True that we will never have teleportation of massive objects (anything decoherent will be damn tough to teleport) and massive in the sense of more than one or two atoms. In any case this field is sure to bring about some great new discovery that we will all benefit (or suffer) from. The fact that we can't see what that is now is no reson to stop searching.
